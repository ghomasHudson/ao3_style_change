“Yeah, he did.” Dean grins and clutches Castiel’s hands tight as he looks into his eyes, already anticipating the glow. “Even the fucking devil can see how much I love you, Cas.”
“I was just a construction guy. Worked for a contractor in Wichita. He went out of business while I was gone, guess they couldn’t make it without me,” Dean says, winking. Actually, Dean’s boss retired and sold his company to a larger firm, who fired and rehired everyone back at the bottom rung of the ladder so they could pay them less. If Dean had been around for that, he would have been pissed.
Jimmy, meanwhile, was just relieved. Relieved to know what had been going on in James’ mind all this time, relieved that this was a problem with a solution. Maybe not a solution he could wrap his mind around right now, but there was a solution out there, things he could do for James to help him… her…
“And good at his job,” Claire says, fiddling with her long, blonde strands. “What do you think, Castiel?”
It all feels like too much stuff, then not enough. Some of the things he takes, like his autographed Game of Thrones DVD box set, aren’t things he needs, just things he figures he should take in case he never comes back, or Tessa gets pissed and burns all his shit.
It’s nearly three weeks before Castiel gets what he needs to make the water and electricity function. After four long, patient explanations from Castiel about how it works, Dean gave up trying to understand the specifics. There’s definitely spellwork involved, but also plain old science and construction. Sam’s going to lose his mind when they eventually have the family up to visit.
The next several minutes are a bit of a blur, Dean is coasting on arousal and unvoiced feelings of love, some clothes get pulled off, Dean somehow gets lube in his hair, and then he’s on his side, holding onto his pillow while Castiel rocks into him from behind, and Dean is moaning so loud he
Dean nods and follows Castiel into his home, duffel bag in hand. Castiel’s house is… nice inside. Gentle, somehow, if a house can be gentle. The colors inside are a lot of muted tans and blues. It reminds him a little of the ocean. Not the vivid, bright ocean of his nightmares, but something calmer, more subdued. The Washington coast on an overcast day, or something poetic like that. Whatever one would call the color scheme, Dean finds it puts him at ease.
Castiel nods, leaning back against Dean. “I suppose I can wait. I am hungry, though. I was going to eat the rest of the soup you made me at lunch today, only to find the container empty save for a slightly damp ten dollar bill. I assume it was Gabriel.”
Dean’s sleeping indoors more now, though still not every night. Turns out the solution was pretty easy; nature sounds. Henriksen suggested a phone app that has sounds like “waves crashing” and “underwater” as options when Dean finally confessed his issues sleeping indoors. Dean can’t believe he didn’t think of it sooner, and Sam can’t believe
Before Dean can answer, he hears the sound of a hand hitting the table with force. “What the damn hell is that supposed to mean?” It’s Jo, she looks pretty irritated.
“I’m a Night Elf druid,” Castiel says matter-of-factly. “Well, I do have a Troll shaman on another server, but I don’t do raids with her.” He looks over at Dean, expression a bit embarrassed.
what I was suggesting. I was thinking you could come here for a weekend and fix… whatever needs fixing,” Castiel says, gesturing to the house in general. “I would pay you for your labor and whatever supplies you need, of course.” He narrows his eyes at Dean. “This is
The thought of running into Lisa or Pamela while he’s all bearded and sad doesn’t sound appealing at all, though.
There’s a presence at Castiel’s feet, and he smiles at the bundle of white fur shedding all over his slacks. “Hello there, nameless cat.”
“My brother’s dating a chick eleven years younger than him,” Dean says. Castiel looks startled and confused, and Dean smiles. “So we’re even with things we shouldn’t be saying about our siblings.”
Dean shakes his head, looking over at Sam. He loses focus a lot. “It’s fine, Sammy, really. Besides, aren’t you doing your role play thing this weekend?”
The sun sets early this time of year, so it’s already nearly dark out. There’s just enough light left for Castiel to see the large flakes of snow still falling from the sky when he can focus enough to open his eyes. Dean has him pressed up against the glass doors leading to the back porch. The door is
“Okay, well… Tessa’s dad owns a company that sells frozen mini deep dish pizzas,” Dean says, embarrassed. Castiel’s eyebrows go up immediately. “I work in customer service.”
“I actually don’t know for certain. I had my siblings and their spouses over, I heard a loud noise, and when I came to check, the door was messed up and no one would admit to doing it,” Castiel says, rolling his eyes. “I assume it was my brother Lucifer, he wouldn’t look me in the eye after.”
“I remember that song!” Dean exclaims, then grimaces. “Uh. My ex liked it. Before the… before. Open it.”
Dean wants to protest, but… honestly it’s good to have Sam pushing him to do this. If it goes badly, he can blame his brother, easy peasy. He fishes his phone out of his pocket, and thumbs his way to Castiel’s name on his painfully short contact list.
Castiel crouches to set his items down, and when he straightens up again Dean gloms onto him like an emotional octopus, holding Castiel tight. Castiel stands, stunned and still for a moment before he remembers to reciprocate. He puts his arms around Dean and hugs him back just as tight.
“I realized that staying married because I was supposed to wasn’t a good enough reason. All it was doing was stopping your father from finding a love that was a better fit, stopping me from being who I was, and stopping you boys from growing up in a house that wasn’t filled with yelling and anger.”
Castiel certainly can’t turn his nose up at an opportunity to save money. “Very well, I’ll give your place a try.”
“Cas, hold up!” Dean yells. Castiel nearly falls over as he stops, face splitting into a grin when he sees Dean.
oh my God can we skip this part? You don’t need to tell me about my changing body or talk to me about condoms.”
Claire is on her back in her bed, staring up at the girl straddling her; Kaia. Neither of them are wearing shirts.
“Sorry. Right. You don’t play. You should. I mean two of your favorite people play it, seems like a good reason to start.”
“Fix your creaky steps, not… wait, never mind, that one doesn’t work. Okay, how about after we eat I wander around the house and figure out what needs to be done?”
Castiel has never really been a fan of Christmas. As a child, Christmas meant getting into stiff, pristine clothing and going to churches and dinners with relatives he barely knew, and getting books for presents. Castiel loves reading, but at ten, sometimes a kid just wants some damn Transformers to play with. As a teenager, Christmas meant detached phone calls from his parents while Castiel sat in his dorm in London’s chapterhouse for the Men of Letters. He didn’t even have Hannah with him in those days; girls were sent to the much newer school in Paris. As an adult, Christmas often was forgotten entirely, there always seemed to be some mission that needed tending, some study that took up Castiel’s time.
“And I have the phone you gave me, with you right at the top of my contact list.” Although there’s only three other people on that list.
From Cas - 8/07/17 - 4:00pm: They said three weeks, in order allow for time to make script changes and have me back by midseason.
He lies there for a few minutes, just being comfortable, mind surprisingly and blissfully still. He should get up, though, find out what time it is.
“In that case, I’ve got tips. Remember to go easy with the makeup. My cousin Muriel is trans, and she used to go out with about a
Dean glances at the bike, which is locked to the back porch, and slightly rusting. “You see the way the back tire is bent almost in half? It’ll be easier to ride if it’s not like that.”
“We worked together at my old job. A design firm of sorts. Promotion time was coming for one of the two of us, and I was the favorite, and he… threw me under the bus, I suppose. Casually mentioned mistakes I’d made, the time I said I was sick but actually went on vacation with him, even mentioning I was on anxiety medication. Nothing to get me
But honestly? Dean’s fine with it. It’s just a thing that happens sometimes, and Dean’s stopped feeling embarrassed about it for the most part. He’s got his own air mattress in there now, a rechargeable lantern, and decorations. The decorations were sort of a joke from Sam, he pinned some old posters up with safety pins on the tent walls, claiming Dean’s second room needed some sprucing up. An AC/DC poster, a kitten in a field of dandelions, and a poster from the second Avengers movie. It looks silly, but Dean left them up, and even added one of his own; a picture of Dean, Sam, and Castiel at Dean’s favorite pizza place. It’s not great quality, the photo was taken with Dean’s phone and printed on a color printer at Sam’s job, but it always makes Dean feel just a little lighter to look at it.
Once in awhile Dean glances up from his work and he’ll catch Castiel watching them, with an almost indescribable smile on his face. It makes Dean’s heart go crazy every time. Castiel doesn’t offer to help, instead spends the day on crosswords, reading a book, then disappearing to make dinner. He practically has to drag Dean and Hael away to eat their macaroni and cheese, they’re very engrossed.
Castiel smiles at the card, then at Dean. “What made you hold onto this package, Dean? I recall reading that several of the packages you opened ended up containing things that helped you
it takes. Castiel’s fingers are fast, impatient, slick… but it feels like it takes forever for him to work Dean open. Meanwhile, Dean’s making all sorts of embarrassing breathy sounds, writhing on top of what looks to be a lovely hand-stitched quilt. When Castiel finally deems Dean loose enough he stops sucking a bruise into Dean’s inner thigh so he can roll on a condom.
in World of Warcraft, Dean.” Castiel sounds so offended, and it’s the tone of his voice mixed with Dean being slightly exhausted that has Dean laughing so hard they have to stop at a gas station so Dean can pee.
anything. After a moment he feels something small and cold nudge at his bare side. He tries to squirm away, and then he feels what is unmistakably a cat crawling onto his stomach.
Before too long Dean and Castiel are back in Ash’s battered and filthy truck, headed for a mattress warehouse at the edge of town.
At first, Dean just sits on the bed, trying to be calm. He has a date. No, not a date. Two friends hanging out. Maybe it
“Have a seat,” Castiel says, setting the package on the coffee table and disappearing through an open archway leading to the kitchen. Dean listens to the sound of the plastic bags being set down, then what sounds like a sigh, and fingers drumming against a hard surface. He sits on Castiel’s couch. He knows this couch. It’s a Crate and Barrel Lounge sofa, retailing at over fifteen hundred dollars.
“I had this whole bit planned about how I caught Lucifer about to eat the pie, and so I thought I should bring it to you right away before he ate the whole thing. But that’s very… dishonest of me. I realized that on the way over. Me having a little story prepared comes from me feeling ashamed and trepidatious about my feelings.”
The motel isn’t going to be winning any quality awards any time soon, but Dean’s baseline for comparison is a cave floor with a huge pile of vivid green leaves from trees and bushes Dean never learned the names of, so it’s still a pretty nice place.
Dean crouches to pick the mocha-scented shards of glass from the kitchen floor. “Just… you know, thought it’d be cool to have some new stuff.” Obviously in the time Dean was gone, much of his stuff ended up in the trash, or donated to charity, or in that fucking coffin. Most of what he wears now are things of his that got mixed in with Sam’s stuff and never got tossed out, or things that
“You really fucked Meg in the mailroom,” Dean says, shaking his head. Castiel’s mentioned this a few times and Dean’s always in disbelief. He thought Meg was gay, for one thing, and Castiel throwing caution to the wind and fucking a woman right in the damn mailroom is hard to imagine.
“I’m uh… waiting for someone,” Dean says, scrubbing a hand over his face as he wakes up a little more. “I think he lives here.”
Eventually Castiel gets up to dispose of the condom and hunt down a wet washcloth, and Dean finally gets a good long look at Castiel in all his naked glory. Holy hell, Dean wants to jump right back into the fray, even if certain parts of him aren’t quite ready for that.
“I just… don’t know much about beauty, and Claire’s mother isn’t in the picture… I need to know these things,” Jimmy says.
“Hey if I can stuff my face while you feel like a good caregiver, it’s a win for both of us, right?”
“They don’t view copulation the way a human does, Dean. To them this is no different than watching us pulling weeds or drinking a beer.”
He looks at Castiel, because Castiel deserves his openness, his honestly. “I like being around you. I like getting to know you, but I also like… this feeling that I’ve known you a lot longer than I have.”
Castiel puts his face in his hands, letting out a sad whimper when the action hurts his nose and moving the bag of corn back onto his face. Kaia comes over with two Advil and a glass of water, which she hands to Claire. She’s dressed to go, bag slung over her shoulder.
“I’m making you nervous, I apologize. The partners have gotten used to young, terrified college interns, they might treat you as such.”
hands are spread over Castiel’s hips, and every time Castiel feels Dean’s beard against his thighs he feels electrified. Dean moves back so he can pull at Castiel’s pants and underwear until they’re around his knees then leans forward again, doing something
and scared the shit out of us with all the fire and brimstone crap. I was scared to sleep for weeks, and you’d come in every night and read to me until I fell asleep. Every night until I wasn’t scared anymore. You remember?”
Castiel snorts. “Believe it or not, Dean, I’m not all that concerned with what others think of my masculinity.”
Or… less than perfect. The department store is on the other side of the mall, and Castiel is almost out of time. He takes a few seconds to wonder if maybe he really is fretting too much about this gift, then sighs and starts running across the mall.
Castiel lets out a soft little gasp; Dean’s heart does a backflip. “I… absolutely, that sounds like a good idea.”
Castiel hasn’t met the rest of Dean’s extended family, but that’s only because Dean still doesn’t see them that much. He’s gotten to a place where he feels safe and at peace with Sam and Castiel, but incorporating other people is going to take some work. It’s hard, though. When he’s with Sam, or Castiel, or both, he feels
“In the Man-on-Man World, it’s considered polite to go around reeking of sweat and come. If you shower, you’ll be dishonoring me.” Dean says it with such authority that for a second Castiel actually believes him.
want to know what’s inside, and now that I’m stateside I think I’d get in trouble for opening someone else’s mail.”
“Cool, let’s go,” Dean says, gesturing to his open apartment door. Castiel follows him across the hall, and notices Dean is wearing slippers.
“It didn’t… I healed. Sometimes though, it’s hard for me to be affectionate in public. It’s bothered some boyfriends, how sometimes I won’t hold hands or kiss in public spaces. Not always… but often. Sometimes it’s hard for me to come out to new people, too. My parents reacted poorly to my sexuality, but… it wasn’t until the attack that I worried about telling new people. Sometimes it’s easier to keep that to myself until I know someone better.”
It feels forward, brazen, but he pushes back against Dean, backside pressing into Dean’s groin. Dean lets out a soft, gorgeous gasp, nipping at the tender skin of Castiel’s neck, just above the collar of his t-shirt.
Dean tugs Castiel forward, away from the elevator doors which close behind him. “Tell me why you were crying,” he demands, voice even harsher. After a moment he frowns, relaxing his body slightly and releasing his hold on Castiel. “Please.”
“I’ll let you two talk,” Ruby says. She gives Claire a gentle punch to the shoulder. “See you later, slugger.”
“May I, Dean?” Castiel says quietly. His voice is a little softer than on TV, but still rough like Dean remembers from the few episodes of Halo Project he’s seen.
“I don’t even care, this is delicious. You make wonderful food. You should do this for a living,” Castiel says, diving in for another spoonful and making sure to get some of the strawberry swirl.
“Yeah, I gue—” There’s a tug, a pull on Dean’s being that has him looking at Lucifer in confusion. “Is that you?”
Dean almost puts the M&M’s back before he remembers he’s thirty-six years old and can do whatever the hell he wants. “You’re just jealous.”
From Cas - 8/04/17 - 5:22pm: I wouldn’t know. All my experiences with “let’s see other people” were “let’s break up and see other people”. Your situation is uncharted territory for me, I’m afraid.
“After a year working there, I can honestly say…” Dean grins. “No, it hasn’t. I fuckin’ love those things and I get them at a discount.”
Castiel pouts. “I didn’t get to go this year, since I’m off my show. It’s a fun time. Very chaotic, like being in a colorful fever dream for a weekend.” Dean steps back to make room, and Castiel comes inside. “I see you cleaned up for me,” he says with a coy smirk.
Illinois isn’t so bad, and Chicago is great, but… like I said a while back I really just want to go somewhere completely different. I always worry we might run into someone from my school, or our church, or
Castiel bends down to kiss at Dean’s neck. It’s cold as fuck out, but Dean’s warm all over. “I thought you wanted to shed some inhibitions with this act, beloved.”
is out there somewhere. They’ll cling to it for dear life, and when they wash up on an uninhabited island with nothing but plane debris, unopened FedEx packages, and a waterlogged corpse to keep them company, they’ll keep going for as long as they can. They’ll keep going until their body gives in or their mind gives up.
He pictured so many things in that package, ranging from things he thought were likely, to things that were too large or heavy to possibly be inside. He pictured books, weapons, clean socks, tubes of toothpaste, puzzles, seeds, more chess pieces, thumbtacks, an iPad… lots of things.
“I don’t have an exciting secret backstory, Dean. I was an ad salesman living with my wife and child in Illinois, now I’m not.”
“Don’t worry, Spring is only a few months away, then they’ll be out in the woods again,” Castiel says, nuzzling up against Dean’s jaw so Dean won’t see his smirk. Dean sort of grunts in response. Sometimes his silly posturing is for the sake of absolutely no one, and Castiel loves him for it.
From Cas - 8/25/17 - 9:22am: I see you attend the Gabriel Novak school of “Pics or it didn’t happen”.
.” Castiel wants more. After a couple of minutes he braces his hands on the bed, shoving back against Dean and forcing moans out of both of them.
It’s ridiculous how easily they’ve slipped into… whatever this is. Two guys with a mutual romantic interest. Dean likes it. He’s pretty sure he deserves something easy. There was a time when Dean would have been weird about it. Playing games instead of being honest about what he wants, or getting cagey about whether he wants to date a guy as he often did in the past. He’s not even worrying about his mountains of baggage from the island. Castiel’s spiel about the two of them not being broken really struck a chord with Dean. A good one.
Dean’s been complaining that the cats have been hanging out in the house more since winter started, sometimes spending full days inside. He grouses about the noise, and having to deal with a litter box, and getting fur all over everything, but Castiel knows he loves having them around.
Ah, the car. This is Jimmy’s last week with his car, actually. He’s trading it to a dealership on Friday for an older car and a boost to his bank account so they can afford furniture when they move. The car he’d settled on is forty years old and an appalling shade of gold, but it runs great, and that’s what matters. The important thing is they’ll have more money for a deposit on a rental and they can leave behind the terrible furniture they’ve been using since moving out of Amelia’s home. They’ve been sitting on folding chairs and sleeping on mattresses with no bed frames because in the back of Jimmy’s mind, he knew their time in Pontiac would come to an end. Claire has decided not to go back to school now that leaving is certain and her entire look is different. They’re going to leave, they just have to decide on
even better than the ones at Harvelle’s. They’re juicy, flavorful, they’ve been infused with gorgonzola, and the bacon Dean used is far, far better than the stuff Amelia used to buy for the house. The buns are toasted with a hint of garlic butter and oregano, and even the lettuce and tomatoes seem fresh and perfect. If Dean ever offers to show Castiel how to cook something again, he hopes it’s this.
“Right, this won’t be awkward at all.” Dean grouses as he makes the call, even though he honestly feels “safer” having Sam nearby.
They’re not back five minutes before there’s a knock on the door. It’s Dean again, holding two medium-sized tupperware containers.
Dean decides to give it another week in Wichita. He’s not really sure what he’s waiting for, but a week it is. According to his conversation with Charlie, Tessa and Ketch
From Cas - 9/01/17 - 5:24pm: Hannah has seized the opportunity and is off on a date with instructions for me to not “wait up”.
Castiel’s seen him without the beard, of course, in a few photos in both Dean and Sam’s apartments, but those were pictures, and old ones at that. Dean is crushingly beautiful with or without a beard, but the newness of this has Castiel’s brain short circuiting. He can’t even remember why he’s here.
Dean got back to Thailand, got to an embassy, got to someone that spoke his language, and eventually he got home.
Another Friday, this time not at Harvelle’s. Because Tessa wanted to do something different. Because Tessa thinks they’re in a rut. Dean
“Can do. You know,” Jimmy says, smiling, “your mother and I wanted to be surprised with your gender.”
“My ass is cold,” Dean says. He starts to pull Castiel down on top of him, but Castiel doesn’t budge.
Dean hits the button for the first floor. “Nope. Saw Meg bringing you home last night. She was giving you a piggyback ride, you were babbling about how you could fly.”
“I mean, there’s… seafood dishes, but it’s not a seafood place. Lots of chicken and steak and whatnot. But I suppose there might be someone nearby eating seafood…” Castiel frowns, pulling his phone out. “Maybe we could go somewhere that—”
Castiel glares. “Of course not, my own daughter is—” He slaps a hand over his mouth, heaving a great sigh. “Uh… Claire’s sexuality is not my information to share… you didn’t hear that, alright?”
“Commanding Officer. He died, and my dad was real torn up about it, so I came down to visit him. He was… fuck, he was mean about it. Ranting about what a good man Rufus was, how he’d made something of himself serving his country, not wasting his time learning to paint pictures for a living… some real vicious shit. He’d had a few beers, but he wasn’t drunk by any means. He damn well meant what he said.”
The only thing he’d remembered to grab was the one package he never opened, the one going from Thailand to Illinois, to Castiel Novak.
It took a lot of uncomfortable self-analyzing and long conversations to get here and feel secure, but Dean’s far happier than he was when he was living with Tessa, even though living with Tessa was definitely easier.
“It sucks to hear, especially as I start to distance myself more from the name, but I know it’s more of a… muscle memory thing. I’ve talked to Dr. Milton about it, she told me to remember that it’s not you disregarding my identity.” Jimmy nods, and Claire shrugs. “I’ve waited years, maybe my whole life for this… and it’s
Castiel squints his eyes, and Dean is nearly knocked on his ass by the wave of nostalgia it brings as the reaper looks
Castiel takes the bottle of Astroglide and the condoms out of his pocket, holding his hands out to show Dean.
Castiel in turn talks about his daughter, his new apartment, his former job, and his deep love for knitting.
“Gabriel called it a ‘signing bonus’. He’s in great spirits today, I heard it’s because you upset Lucifer.”
got him an eleven day stay in a psych ward, pumped full of drugs his malnourished body could barely handle.
He takes his Starship Enterprise bottle opener out of the kitchen junk drawer, and his old Hamburglar magnet from the fridge. His clothes get stuffed in a garbage bag.
Years of bland and gristly sea creatures to eat, years of thirst barely quenched by coconut or rain water, years of trimming his nails with his own teeth so they’d stop getting in the way, years of wearing scraps of fabric that used to be his clothing, and scraps that used to be boxed up in packages waiting to go somewhere; some place other than Thailand where they started, Wichita where Dean was headed, and the god-forsaken island where they ended up.
? Why haven’t you made a move? He fucks guys! Or he did in high-school, anyway. Not really sure how much
Castiel pays better attention after that but that doesn’t stop Lucifer from returning at five, flanked by the other three partners.
“Oh, yeah! I had a lot of fun, even though Sam beat the shit out of all of us in Smash Brothers. But he
“Dean, don’t stay in the relationship because breaking up seems too complicated, or because you’re afraid to be alone. Stay because you’re in love and want to build a life with the person. Stay because life without her would be an ugly thing. Stay because there’s no one you trust more. And if you don’t stay, keep trying until you find a love that’s right for you. Like your father.”
“Yeah, uh… Sammy hung them up when I was out one time… I decided I didn’t hate how it looked, so I kept em’.”
“Well then, I repeat; alright, cool. So… tomorrow the stove comes, and the elevator is getting fixed… you can move in on Tuesday, and we’ll get set up then. Sound good?”
Once in a while Dean will see Castiel and one of the animals in some sort of staring match, and he just
“Oh. Well, the point is, trying to force it isn’t going to fix anything. You’re just going to get more and more frustrated and eventually purposefully hit your head on the wall just so you can get out of it.”
Sam claps his hands together excitedly. “Hey, you’re looking for a place? That’s awesome! My brother
“Oh. Well, I don’t own my own place either,” Dean says. “Even the tent is Sam’s, really. I mean he bought it.”
“Fuck, I’m getting close, Cas,” Dean says. He slows his movements until he’s stopped entirely, then he pulls out. “On your back.”
“Yeah, and it’s stupid, because… by the time I stopped going to that school she was calling me a freak like everyone else so I have better reasons to be mad at her.”
“Well… you can find all that out, right?” Dean’s sitting next to Castiel on the bed now, and he has no idea when that happened.
going to name five women from Firefly. “Chloe Bennet, Jamie Chung, uh… oh, and Castiel Novak,” he says, smirking at Charlie.
It’s been three days. Dean’s still sleeping on the couch, and Tessa’s still not talking to him. Every time Dean says “Tess, I’m sorry,” she storms away. She hasn’t dumped his ass though, that has to be a good sign.
For a second Dean genuinely has no idea who the fuck “Arthur” is, and then a cold roll of nausea clobbers him. “When,” he says, voice so thin he has to repeat himself to be sure Tessa heard him.
“Oh, I get it,” Dean says, kissing his way down Castiel’s jaw, “I’m just a consolation prize at the end of a hard campaign.”
Right now, nothing sounds appealing. Going back to Lawrence, staying in this motel, even going back to the apartment with Tessa. He’s got this uncomfortable tension, like his life is the wrong size for him or something.
Sugar is resting on the back of the couch, and when she sees Castiel looking at her she yawns, stretches, then jumps right onto Castiel’s crotch. He yelps in pain, lifting Sugar up and dropping her on the floor. Dean comes out of the kitchen, grinning when he sees Castiel.
Castiel’s never been tied up before, but he’s certainly open to it. With Dean, anyway. Lilith had mentioned wanting to tie Castiel up, and the prospect had been legitimately terrifying. He looks from the ties in Dean’s hand to Dean himself and nods, lying on his back and stretching his arms out. Dean circles the bed, tying Castiel’s wrists to his bed frame, separately. If Castiel’s being honest, this is already arousing him.
! I’m so fucking excited, Dad!” Claire hugs Castiel, then pulls away abruptly. “Fuck, do I own anything red?”
It’s a little silly, but Castiel grabs his blanket and pulls it up over his lap. “Are you willing to pretend none of this happened?”
“Fine, fine. But e-mail me that video, okay? Donna thinks I made it up, she’s going to shit her pants when she sees Naomi writhing around to fucking Wrecking Ball.”
Sugar is sleeping on the bed, so Dean scoops her up, deposits her outside the room, and closes the door. He takes Castiel’s items and sets them on his nightstand.
“It’s so nice to smell food in the house,” Castiel says, grabbing plates out of one of the cabinets.
“Let’s hope so,” Castiel says, gasping softly when he hears the sound of the Astroglide bottle being opened.
“I know. Don’t eat the cookies before dinner. Either of you.” With that, Dean disappears back into his own apartment.
It’s snowing, which it sometimes does at this time of year in Oregon. Castiel had been looking forward to this part of living in the Pacific Northwest; he had visions of the gray skies, the big flakes of snow, and gazing out the window, curled up on his new couch with a big mug of hot chocolate clasped in his hands. It took a while to get to this point, apparently it
“Not a waste of time,” Dean says. “Discount, remember? I think you should consider one of the custom pieces, though… maybe an end table. Gotta support local businesses, Cas, and it’ll give your house some character.”
“Well, a bunch of us decided to go see a movie. So, we all got in Alex’s car and headed to the theater, and then we were in the parking lot and this woman gets out of her car, only she’s trans, and…” Claire sighs. “She wasn’t
Dean kisses him thoroughly, letting out a series of beautiful whimpers into Castiel’s mouth. Castiel is immersed in the kiss, in the feeling of their warm, slippery bodies moving together, so when Dean says “Touch yourself, Cas”, it takes Castiel several long moments to understand what Dean just said, and what he means. He nods, reaching down to take himself in hand.
“I want… he’s my landlord, and I just found out it’s his birthday, and he’s been so kind to me and my daughter, and he was the first friend I made in this town, I want to get him something special.”
bowl of ice cream, someone from the first floor calls with some sort of ‘apartment issue’, so Dean sends Castiel back to his own apartment with a pat on the shoulder and a tupperware container full of ice cream that Castiel won’t be sharing with Claire if he can help it.
“Oh! Wonderful!” the man exclaims, clapping his hands together. “He told me he had plans this weekend, but I assumed he was just spending it on his couch playing computer games. You know, he’s really let this place fall into disrepair this past year, not that he’s ever been big with upkeep. He’ll keep the inside of his house nice and tidy, but the outside ends up like…
Castiel strolls through his neighborhood awed at the differences and similarities to the somewhat wealthy, conservative chunk of Pontiac he lived in with Amelia. The most comforting thing he notices is how many people have LGBT pride decals on their cars, and even rainbow flags in some windows. The lawns are mostly dead and unwatered, which Castiel knows is for conservation reasons, but the homes are lovely and varied.
Castiel kneels next to Dean, smiling. He’s still in some clothes he borrowed from Dean, which should make him look more ordinary, but of course it doesn’t. “I have a few other homes. They’re all older than this one, and considerably farther away from California.”
Dean understands where Hannah’s coming from. He’s heard Sam having sex before and it’s just fucking horrific.
“Not yet… I just needed…” Castiel puts both hands on the back of Dean’s head, pulling him in for a kiss. Dean moans into the kiss, hips rocking gently, cock slowly sliding in, out. Their kiss continues as Dean builds a rhythm. He has one hand underneath Castiel, one hand braced next to them. Dean is everywhere.
Their hips press together once Castiel is on top of Dean, and Dean feels his lower half jerk with electricity when their cocks come into contact. Castiel is hard, and Dean wants… holy fuck does he ever want. He’ll even let Castiel keep those ugly fucking boxer briefs on while he fucks Dean if he wants.
You know, he used to live next door, in the apartment Chuck lives in. To be right there if I needed him. But then one day I heard what it sounds like when he has sex, and that was the end of
Dean lets his head fall back onto the lawn they’ve been cultivating in front of the house. The grass is fresh and vibrant, even though it’s December. Dean breathes in deep, the scents of sweat, grass, and coconut oil filling his head for a moment, distracting him.
It’s nearing the end of April. Number of screaming nightmares from Dean? Zero. Number of pointless dates Castiel has been on since March? Three. Number of times Castiel has walked in on Sam having sex in the basement laundry room? Also three, unfortunately.
It’s fun. Dean feels at peace, like he does when he’s at Harvelle’s with everyone but Ketch. At around three in the morning Sam and Garth crash on Sam’s bed, Benny goes to sleep on the couch, and Dean and Castiel lie next to each other on the floor. Through absolutely no orchestrating on Dean’s part. Really.
Everyone looks back over at Kelvin. He’s smiling and nodding, talking to a man in dark slacks and a tucked in white button-up shirt. Other than possibly someone who has a nice ass, Dean has no idea who the guy is. He and Victor scoot along their couch, moving closer to Ketch so they can get a better angle. Victor immediately starts laughing and nudges Dean hard.
thing. Castiel is done for. He sighs, slowly opening his laptop up as Dean comes over, tossing his jacket on the floor as he goes. He plops down on the bed, and the movement causes the barest amount of friction as the warm laptop jostles in Castiel’s lap. Dean leans forward, enough that Castiel can’t see his expression when he sees what’s on the screen.
They have things in common, which is nice. They’re both the only children of deceased parents, they’re both assistants to bosses that are a bit of a nightmare, they both prefer Raisinettes at the movie.
. So… please. Take a break. Stop trying to write. I can show you the ropes at the store, or you could hang out with Sam at the library, or you can hold Crocatta down while I give her that ear mite medication. Stop thinking about it for a while, and
“Got it in one,” Castiel says, firing a finger gun at Dean. He glances down at his fingers, mystified. “Finger guns. I’m turning into Gabriel.”
The further he gets, the more something stands out to him; he’s not bothered that Tessa has another man over, he’s bothered that it’s
After dinner they end up sitting on the couch drinking wine. Not much, since Dean’s not about to be some asshole driving while drunk, but it’s still pleasant. Dean doesn’t drink wine all that often, he’s a beer and whiskey kind of guy, but this is pretty good stuff. Dense and plummy, Dean would say if he knew anything about wine, which he really doesn’t. It feels classy, like they should have a cheese and cracker plate on the coffee table and maybe a crackling fire in the background instead of some baking show on PBS with the volume nearly at zero.
Dean seems to consider this for a moment. “On the one hand, kind of… because the only thing more horrifying than my boyfriend finding my fan fiction is my favorite author fucking finding my fan fiction, but on the other hand, you’re
” Amelia says, slapping her hand down on the brochure lying on the counter. “He’ll get better, and be
To Cas - 8/26/17 - 12:01pm: third of all ketchup is fucking perfect and i’ll be calling him that now thank you
Castiel is a bit surprised by the scene that greets him when he gets to his apartment. Kevin and Kaia are back, squeezed onto the couch with Claire and Sam, everyone holding a video game controller. Claire doesn’t own a video game console, so Castiel’s not sure where those came from. The game looks chaotic. Castiel’s not entirely sure what’s happening in it, but he thinks they might be battling each other.
Castiel startles, realizing someone is watching him from the porch. It’s the woman from earlier, this time holding a bottle of water instead of a dog leash.
Henriksen holds a hand up. “Look at the clock. Our session is over. You can escape your discomfort safely.”
“I feel bad for her…” Castiel looks up again, Claire’s crouched on the floor, petting the cat. “She had a family, and they up and left her…”
“I can do that,” Jimmy says emphatically. He’s overcompensating for Amelia, but it’s hard not to do what he can to show James that someone is in his… her…
The bus Dean’s taking this time leaves at around three in the morning, and since the idea of walking that far in the middle of the night kind of freaks Dean out, he gets a ride from Sam.
“Well,” Castiel says, tapping his chin, “normally during filming hiatus I fly my family up to Vancouver for a few weeks, or take them on a vacation, but… this year I thought I’d come home.”
Dean shakes his head. “Nah, don’t look at it like that. Don’t look at it like an obligation. It’s still up to you, it’s your decision.”
Castiel moves closer, teeth digging into his lower lip as he stares at Dean with absolutely undisguised want. These are good things, Dean doesn’t have to be scared. He grows bolder.
Dean deals with several tasks over the course of their Saturday. He fixes Castiel’s wobbly coffee table with nothing more than a hammer, a nail, and a piece of cork board, he fixes the leak under Castiel’s kitchen sink and gets rusty water all over his t-shirt and jeans and hair, then he takes a damn shower. After that, he goes to investigate the weird smell by Castiel’s back porch, finds and clears away a dead… something… and then takes yet another shower.
“Maybe. Talking to Samandriel made me think about how it might be good to meet other people like me.”
“You’ve been pretty unflappable since you started here,” Gabriel says, “we were just curious about what’s got you so rattled.”
Mary chuckles. “Mhm, dare you to say that to her face. You get it though, right? He’s happy now, because he didn’t give up when he and I didn’t work out. He’s got a wife he loves and
“I’m chill! I’m excited, but I’m chill. I’m the chillest. Chilliest? Most chill? How do I say that?”
“What job do you see me having?” Castiel asks Claire. They’re sitting on the motel bed, a five dollar pizza between them, some old action movie playing on the television.
, I think you need to give the people that matter to you an opportunity to get to know you as you are.”
His fingers drum against the keys of his laptop as he stares at the screen, considering. Castiel makes it a rule not to read fan fiction for his stories. Lawyers advise against it, one never knows if an idea will take root in their mind and they’ll accidentally plagiarize an author… or maybe they’ll find an idea that’s so good they end up cursing themselves for not having it and not being able to use it.
“Oh, so suddenly you’ve got all the time in the world?” Dean says, glaring while Castiel shoves a couple of pillows under Dean’s ass.
He was a ghost for so many years, he affected no one and nothing other than his little corner of the island and the sea creatures he killed for meals. Now that he’s back, sometimes it blows him away that he can talk to a person and have an effect on them. Talking to Sam about his divorce, bringing Gabriel’s package to Castiel, even making Jody burst into tears that one time. He’s not just some unbalanced asshole arguing with chess pieces anymore, he’s a person interacting with other people.
for me,” Sam says wistfully, staring at his beer with tear-rimmed eyes. “But uh… she doesn’t have patience for cheating, obviously, so that was kind of it. We divorced, she moved to Nebraska, I kicked the coke habit, spent a few months in therapy, got a job in IT, slowly pieced together a new life... and then you came back.” Sam takes a long drink. “And maybe I begged everyone we know not to tell you about how I’d leveled my old life while you were gone.”
with you?” Sam says when Dean comes out of the bathroom in yet another outfit; khaki slacks and a light blue polo shirt.
“I cried while watching Pretty Woman. At the end, when Richard Gere shows up to whisk Julia Roberts away. I guess I should be up front about that before we do anything.”
“You’ll find other stuff to do. You’ll read. You’ll buy cat toys on Amazon. You’ll learn to cook without using a microwave.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean grumbles, debating on getting up to get his hands on one of those damn strawberries, “don’t let it go to your head.”
“Oh. Good, I thought maybe you were entering the ‘I’m essentially an adult, so I’ll refer to my parents by their first names’ phase.”
There’s still a lot of typing and clicking from the other room, and Dean likes it. It falls under the category of “good” white noise for him. The soft, gentle clicks, the repetitive typing. It’s good, it’s soothing. Something Dean could fall asleep to, even.
Dean’s face breaks into a grin, and Castiel listens to Dean exclaim about pulled pork sandwiches while he waits for his heart to stop beating so hard.
“I have no idea if he’s gonna tell people. He has no reason not to. Especially seeing as I cold-cocked him.” Claire takes her hand out of the bowl, and sets it on a dry dish towel. “I’m not ashamed of who I am. I’m not. I might wanna do hormone replacement therapy down the road, maybe surgery someday, maybe not… but for now I’m good with
” Dean blurts out. Castiel stares at the frame a moment longer, then turns it around so Dean can see it.
Dean nods. It’s a little depressing to think about his own parents falling out of love, but Mary and John have both long moved past it. “How do you know whether you should fight for the relationship, or just let go?”
Castiel vanishes while Dean is working on washing the back of the house, and when he’s finished Dean finds Castiel at the front, holding up his array of paint swatches and squinting.
“Uh, hey, Cas. Castiel. Uh, it’s Dean. Winchester. We met the other day, like a week ago, remember?”
Okay, that’s true. Still, fucking out in the open like animals had seemed so much hotter before there were actual animals watching.
“Yeah. Two days, of… two days. It wasn’t Benny, just Alastair. Benny was a sentry. When Alastair was gone Benny was sympathetic, you know? But he believed Alastair, he believed
when I’m in full drag. Start small, work your way up.” Samandriel starts curling the ends of Claire’s extensions.
Claire beams. “You mean it, right? Don’t go with it because you don’t want to hurt my feelings, this is going to be your
stringing up one of your own men then trying to cut and burn the truth out of him… fuckin' unthinkable… out there, away from home, away from everything, even the rest of our unit… it wasn’t so unthinkable. Alastair had other ideas of justice… or what he
“Cool.” Dean takes Castiel by the hand that's not holding condoms and lubricant, pulling him toward his bedroom.
“Not really,” Castiel says. It’s a school day, so no one is home but Dean, Castiel, and Sam’s dog. They’re on Sam’s couch, watching daytime TV with the volume low while Dean gives Castiel a foot rub. Dean’s wearing Castiel’s red cassock, and Castiel is wearing Dean’s Batman boxers and Superman t-shirt.
Castiel Novak is sitting a few tables away, sipping at a drink while the two other men sitting with him appear to be fighting over the last breadstick in the basket on their table. Castiel seems to notice Dean almost immediately, and the amused smile he has grows to a grin as he raises his drink at Dean.
They finish the paperwork within a few minutes, just long enough for Dean to revert to what is likely his default state of surliness.
“I used to smell like Irish Spring, just like you, but then I got hooked on my ex-wife’s body wash.”
Christmas. That’s what he gets for buying decorations online, according to Dean. And Jo. And Crowley.
Amelia was inconsolable for days, crying at the sight of James, demanding he take his words back, threatening to sue Dr. Milton for perverting her son’s mind… all manner of hysterical vitriol that Jimmy would not have thought her capable of had he not witnessed it himself.
“Transparency is important,” Castiel says solemnly. His hand rubs up against Dean’s cock with more intent, and he smiles when Dean whimpers a little.
After a moment he sits on his heels, and Castiel realizes he’s come too, jeans half open, boxers damp.
There’s a transfer in Kansas City, and one in St. Louis. The worst part of the trip is the layover in Kansas City. It’s a nearly four hour wait in the bus station and a pretty active part of the day, lots of people walking by, chatting, impatiently waiting behind him at the vending machine while he decides what he wants to eat, asking to use the outlet he’s charging his iPod in. The stopover in St. Louis is easier. It’s nearly three in the morning, and the other people at the bus station are too tired to be chatty.
Tempting. There might be lube inside. Or condoms. Or both. “Nah,” Dean says. “We started this out here, I wanna finish it out here.”
It’s nearly midnight when Dean hears the front door closing. He’s building a castle on Charlie’s Minecraft server. Charlie and Mick are building a giant pink penis in front of it, but it’s fine. They’re using wool blocks, Dean can set it on fire when they log off.
Okay, this is new. The rabbit wakes as Dean stirs, and for a moment they stare at each other before it wriggles out of his arms to hop a few feet away. It looks at Dean for a few more moments, then bounds off into the forest.
“You can cook while you’re here, if that will make you feel more like you’re doing your fair share of work.”
“Alright.” Dean’s weight leaves the bed, and Castiel listens for the sound of his footsteps walking away, but instead he hears Dean taking deep breaths.
?” Dean asks, trying not to overtly gawk at Castiel and figure out where he’d lose weight from. He looks
They both fall silent for a moment, and Dean realizes that right now he’s a guy pinning his best friend down to a couch for no real reason. He might be too old for this shit. And yet…
“Thirty-seven years. But ever since we decided to leave, I feel like I’m in… stasis, like I’m waiting for my life to start. But I also get that this is your home, and that it’s hard to move and leave that behind.”
“I know. But… you’re important to me, Cas,” Dean says, and Castiel’s heart does a somersault in his chest. “I feel like I’m hiding from you, and I don’t want to.”
Castiel grabs a newspaper he bought yesterday and flips through to the classifieds. “Lots of receptionist jobs in here.”
for Idris Elba,” Tessa says emphatically. She’s a little chattery when she’s tipsy, it’s always cute.
“Okay, no problem. I think I’ll be able to cross off quite a few things over the weekend. Should I get there Friday evening or Saturday morning? Uh, I can’t sleep on the bus… because of… there’s a lot of people on buses... so I’m gonna need a nap.”
As far as Castiel’s family, Dean’s met just about everyone. He’d already met the siblings early on, but he’s also met Castiel’s nieces and nephews, and many obnoxious cousins. He hasn’t met Castiel’s mother, who lives in Europe with what Castiel calls her “new” family. Castiel doesn’t talk about her all that much, but Dean knows they’re not close and Castiel’s okay with it.
“Good, I brought my eatin’ pants,” Dean says, snorting when Castiel actually looks at his pants. “It’s an expression.”
second floor apartment was yours, and I had to find you through trial and error. Your brother seems nice, by the way.”
He could do that again, he supposes. He could move back to Lawrence, or even go somewhere new. Kansas City. No Ketch, no Tessa, no Castiel Novak. Way closer to Sam than Wichita. Dean should move to Kansas City.
Castiel practically shoves Dean in his haste to get up and he hurries out to the kitchen, Dean trailing behind him. He makes a beeline for the stove, lifting the lid from the pot with the sauce and breathing in deep.
Dean snatches the box out of Castiel’s hands and sets it down on the couch. “Oof, heavy. Love the bow,” he says, flicking the elaborate bow Claire made with several strips of newspaper and some tape.
He puts a one gallon tub of cookie dough ice cream in the cart, and a forty-two ounce bag of M&M’s. Two snacks.
There’s a morning when Castiel takes himself in hand in the shower, stroking himself to completion, thinking of Dean’s hands on him when he comes. He spends that day filled with shame; though whether it’s leftover religious stigma or guilt for fantasizing about a friend, Castiel isn't certain.
“I’ll assume that’s ‘smart guy’ talk for ‘kids shouldn’t play with knives no matter how many words they know’.”
Castiel jumps to his feet, shocked into action by Dean’s demeanor. He feels small, hurt, and frightened as he rushes out the door, squeezing past Dean and the newcomer, Benny.
“For once in my life, I don’t think I care,” Claire says, leaning against the back of the bed and closing her eyes. “Come on, that bedtime story isn’t gonna read itself.”
great with addressing the chessboard thing. He comes off awkward and coddling, like maybe if he says it the wrong way, Dean’s going to start screaming and pulling his hair out.
Amelia. Of course if I had to choose all over again I would do things the same, if only for Claire, but… at the time my actions were driven by grief. We were so
Henriksen usually has a pretty passive albeit friendly expression, but at this he leans forward in his chair, eyes keen. “
“A coffee maker, a radiator at my sister’s old apartment building, a doorbell, things like that… some things didn’t catch fire, some just emitted sparks. Or broke further.” Castiel sighs. “My reputation is deserved, hence the slight look of disrepair all over my home. If I try to mow my lawn, or touch up the paint, or fix the creaky step on the porch… somehow, it will all catch fire or burst into a shower of sparks.”
It feels weird, trying to dial back what they have while they’re still in sort of a honeymoon stage.
A minute passes, and Castiel realizes he’s still hugging Dean. A few seconds after that he realizes Dean is still hugging
“Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah,” Tessa says, looking back and forth between Dean and Ketch, “when did you see Dean’s
Castiel glares at Dean, resisting the powerful urge to bean him over the head with his shoulder bag. “You’re a large, strapping young man, shouldn’t you be taking the stairs?”
“This ain’t your damn floor,” Dean barks, and all three of them jerk away from each other in surprise.
He hasn’t cooked in ages and he’s craving his grandmother’s spaghetti sauce, a recipe he’s mastered if Sam is to be believed. He can already taste the marinara… his grandma’s secret was to throw a carrot in with the sauce to absorb some of the acidity of the tomatoes; it always makes the sauce a little bit sweet, too.
“I knew someone that said po-tah-to,” Castiel says. At Sam’s incredulous expression, he continues. “One of the regular directors for the show. Once we realized that’s how he said it, we always tried to find excuses to get him to say it again.”
“He sure as fuck never has before, but there’s a first time for everything.” Dean has an odd little smirk that Castiel thinks might be pride.
“The burger is wonderful. It’s a mixture of beef, pork, and bison… very tender and juicy. I often order one, cooked medium… it comes with fries, but I usually get a side to split if I’m here with someone. The poutine, or the homemade pretzels…”
Dean’s mouth tastes like cotton and death but he still pulls Castiel down into a kiss, letting out an involuntary giggle when he feels the cool surface of Castiel’s phone touch his side.
“Dick. Maybe I’ll just stay here and let you do all the work. Look at you, you’re not even sweating.”
“Twist my arm,” Dean says, coming to the couch. He plucks Castiel’s bear off his stomach, regarding it with a smile. “V-Day gift?”
Shivers work their way down Dean’s spine. “Agent,” he says, hoping his voice has some humor to it. He waits for Castiel to say more, but he doesn’t. He just sits back, watches the screen, and periodically holds his bag of popcorn over for Dean.
He rolls fully onto his back so he’s looking up at Castiel. “I guess it wasn’t a big deal after a while, not feeling that way. Even with what I went through, I got off light compared to a lot of people that go over there… but… yeah. I guess I kind of thought I was done feeling that way. I went on a date once in a while, but things never really went that far. And then you showed up, and… anyway, there it is. I’m in love with you. I have been for a while. I think it every day and it’s dumb that I haven’t told you. You make me happier than I’ve been in a long time, Cas, even if it doesn’t seem like it on days like this. And you don’t gotta… you don’t have to say anything. I just really wanted you to know.”
There’s no bus back to Wichita until tomorrow, so Castiel offers Dean his couch. It’s pretty early in the evening, but Dean’s drained, Castiel had seemed emotionally if not physically exhausted, there’s no reason for them to stay up. Dean actually wanted to talk to Castiel some more, but he figures they have time; they’ve already exchanged phone numbers, discussed compensation... this maintenance plan is pretty much a done deal, they’ll have time to talk again later.
I don’t mean that place, or the one with the creepy bigot owner… but what was wrong with that place by the train tracks?”
Dean’s voice is thick with restrained rage; Castiel can tell he’s the type to be fiercely protective of his family.
Lucifer doesn’t call again, but plenty of other people do. Castiel spends his day fetching coffees and lunches, filing, and playing computer solitaire. When five o’clock rolls around, he gathers his things and looks up to see Hannah from Human Resources ambling over, carrying a massive gift basket.
to live across from someone that has so many loud arguments that he has to warn his tenants about it?”
“Only until you start to see the cracks.” Castiel inhales the aromas from his bowl before taking another bite.
“Yeah,” Dean says, panting just a little. “I think he brought the Gamecube over. Ash is in there too… and Claire’s friends Kevin and Kaia. Video games bring kids of all ages together, you know. But uh… there’s no one in
He knocks on Dean’s door, muttering the line he wants to say over and over as he waits. “Dean, I want you. Dean, I want you. Dean—”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “I’m afraid I’ve got nothing scandalous, sorry to disappoint,” he says, digging through the plastic grocery bag containing his ties. He hasn’t owned items of a “vulgar” nature for a very long time; Amelia abhorred such things. Perhaps now that Castiel is single and settled in a new home, he should purchase adult items. Or he can get a bottle of lotion and some Victoria’s Secret catalogs like he did when he was younger.
Dean lets go of his arm and nods. “I’ll talk to you later, okay? Maybe tomorrow? Pizza? More Die Hard?”
After sending Sam a quick “I’m still alive” text and a short trip to the bathroom, Dean goes to the kitchen to get started on breakfast while Castiel goes back to the task he was apparently in the middle of in his game. He mutters something about having to “find a new tank”, and Dean has no idea what the hell that means, are there tanks in World of Warcraft? Dean thought it was about dragons and wizards and shit.
“It’s fine, I’m just being a bitch. You go on your date, man. I’ll be okay. My brother’s on his way, actually, probably to tear me a new one for not telling him sooner.”
Dean wakes slowly, as he often does, but when his eyelids flutter open he catches Castiel abruptly looking away and grabbing his phone from his nightstand.
I have my siblings… a close friend of mine that’s moved to Chicago… and so on. But I did end up with more free time, so… anyway. Computer games.”
“Rodents and small reptiles are fine, cats for an extra two-hundred on the security deposit, no dogs or birds… not even when you’re
Sam’s got this look on his face like he just got his dick caught in his zipper. “Uh… I didn’t think she was?”
outside the door. Dean’s so busy drying his hands on his pockets that he walks right into him and Castiel falls like a stone.
Castiel instantly feels a weight leave his shoulders. “That is… kind of a huge relief, Dean, thank you.”
Nope, Dean’s fucking hallucinating. Surely Castiel Novak didn’t just walk into his fucking motel room.
The elevator seems to take eons, long enough that Castiel’s about to take the stairs instead, then there’s a
Dean looks like he’s having the time of his life. “That’s not how I see it. Now come on,” he says, rubbing a hand against the front of Castiel’s open slacks, not quite touching where Castiel wants.
The night wears on, and two things become very clear to Castiel. He really likes Meg, and he feels no romantic spark. Having been on only a few first dates in his life, this is a new experience for Castiel. Then again, in all those previous first dates, Castiel was young, now he’s not. Maybe this sort of thing takes time. He wonders how insulting Meg would find it if he asked.
He’s not sure how much time has passed, but he’s no longer warm and sweaty, and his heart isn’t racing, so it must have been a while. Good Lord, Dean is heavy.
“Our own. If you want to do that… it doesn’t have to be permanent. We can try it for a while, we can come back. Sam has shown that we are very welcome here, but he loves you, I know he wants your happiness.”
Dean’s read a couple; they’re exquisitely terrible. Chuck and Marv have a passionate fanbase though, so Dean supposes taste is in the eye of the beholder.
“It won’t be just me trying, okay?” Jimmy says. “Your mother needs a little more time, and she’ll be right here with me. She’ll come around.”
Time passes, but not very much. Dean’s drifting, listening to the sounds of a late Illinois evening when he hears the sound of the back door opening and footsteps coming closer.
Dean’s eyes widen, and he licks his lips in a likely unconscious gesture. A subtle, but satisfying reaction. “Beardless face
They eat quietly for a minute or two, sipping on glasses of filtered water and making soft, happy noises at the flavors.
They finish loading the day’s purchases into the apartment, and then Dean is saying his stilted goodbyes, brushing off both Castiel’s thanks, and his offers to compensate Dean for his help.
Castiel chuckles. “Sure, you cross off some more of these, and I’ll think about letting you see me in my faerie costume.”
That’s a lie. Castiel is being ridiculous. He could have simply said he was going to take a shower, no one would have grilled him about why. He
Castiel gets onto his back again, biting his lip when he finally gets a look at Dean. His face and neck are flushed, he’s glowing with sweat. He looks incredible. Castiel gets the pillows back underneath himself so Dean has easier access, and then Dean is throwing one of Castiel’s legs over his shoulder and sliding back inside. Castiel can’t help but cry out this time as Dean moves inside him. He’s shocked and delighted by how much he’s enjoying this.
Castiel chuckles. “In another life, perhaps. I do like the idea of working in retail for a while, though… a bookstore or a flower shop. If I can find something like that full time…” He sighs. “But then there’s benefits and insurance to worry about, God forbid you broke a limb or something…”
“I can’t imagine what he was thinking, what did he… what did he do to you? Oh, Dean, I woke and couldn’t sense your soul at all, and I— I got to you as fast as I could.” Castiel clambers onto the bed and wraps his arms around Dean. He’s shaking.
Dean rushes ahead to open Castiel’s door too, then his hand stalls on the knob. “Can I uh… when can I… when can we see each other again?”
“Claire, that entire apartment smelled like sweat and dogs, I don’t care how big the bedrooms were,” Castiel says, glaring at the Craigslist listings on his phone.
Castiel narrows his eyes, looking a bit too astute for Dean’s comfort. “Are you sure you don’t want a ceremony?”
Dean sure does miss the days before he found at least one long cat hair in every fucking meal, but he can’t seem to permanently keep those beasts off the kitchen counter. Or the couch. Or the bed when Dean and Castiel are trying to have sex.
It’s hard, watching Sam sob, grieve, and stand alone in a corpse filled barn, but Dean does. After two minutes, though, Sam is straightening his back; face a mask of tear-plastered determination.
He’s not asleep yet, but he’s getting closer. There are tree roots digging into his shoulder, a rock under his ass, but that discomfort is still what makes sense to him.
There’s an instinct to lie, but there’s no point in trying to hide it, since Castiel’s caught him and all. Besides, Castiel’s been pretty cool so far. So, Dean nods. “Yeah, it’s a thing.”
Well, yeah. Kind of. I just… I know we’ve talked about this, and I’ve talked about it with Kaia, and Dr. Mills, but… there are still days where I feel like I kind of… ruined your life.”
Dean yanks open the door, and Castiel hears him make a noise of surprise. Castiel turns to look at the door. It’s someone he doesn’t recognize. Blue eyes, a bit older than Castiel, built like a bear. He’s wearing what looks a bit like an old fisherman’s cap, a black peacoat, and a deep frown.
Dean watches Castiel’s hand for a long moment, long enough that it almost feels like too much time has passed to respond. It’s a question he’s been asked by Sam, by Henriksen. For some reason he feels ready to actually tell someone why he never opened that last package.
“You really are full of surprises,” Castiel mutters between kisses. “You know… I haven’t got any gifts for you, I didn’t know we were celebrating Christmas.”
And yet, he abandoned them. Left them on the island the day fate shined a light on him and sent him a rescue in the form of a Thai fishing boat with a broken navigation system.
When Dean complains that he’s hungry, Victor smirks, reaching into his jacket pocket. “I knew you’d be wanting food.” He holds up a Snickers bar.
“Well you must’ve gotten tired out building this yourself way back when, didn’t it leave you with that happy ache-y feeling of a job well done?”
Already this position feels more base, more brazen. “Fuck me, Dean,” Castiel says, feeling silly with the words until Dean all but growls and grips Castiel’s hips with both hands.
“Yeah, you’re right, but…” Dean sighs. “I want to be somewhere that feels like home. Wichita doesn’t. Especially right
He doesn’t know that he’ll use them, but there’s a paper bag in the seat next to him with a new bottle of Astroglide and condoms. He has a fresh clean bill of health from his doctor. He’s going to go to Dean’s apartment, he’s going to tell him what he wants.
After a short wait at the bus station, Dean’s on his way to Champaign, Illinois. It’s a long trip. Dean spends most of it listening to his iPod. He wants to read one of the few Vonnegut books he brought with him, but he gets car sick after reading for more than five minutes every time he tries. He’s tired, but he can’t sleep. Not on a moving bus. He’ll take a nap at the motel when he gets to Illinois.
It’s perfect, and when he comes, perched on his kitchen counter, legs wrapped around Castiel’s waist, he’s powerless to look anywhere but into Castiel’s eyes.
The scrambled eggs are painfully overcooked, the bacon somehow looks burned on one side and raw on the other, and Dean’s toaster was apparently turned all the way up, so the toast is charcoal by the time it pops up. Castiel never should have tried this. He glares down at the two plates of awful food, wondering if he really wants to inflict this meal on himself, let alone Dean.
“Should I be scared for my virtue, then?” Castiel says, holding out a hand for Azazel. The dog deems Castiel either acceptable or uninteresting and disappears back into the house after a few sniffs.
“World of Warcraft? Really? What does he play as? What server is he on? Did you ask him what he thinks of the latest patch, because—”
“Keep going,” he mumbles, so Castiel does, sending warm, shuddering shocks of sensation through Dean’s body until Castiel comes into the thin layer of latex separating them.
“You could have called him a taxi, you could have let him go, you could have at least come back to the bar and told the guys you were leaving. But you didn’t. You just took off and did God knows what—”
Oh well, at least Castiel will have brand new, probably unopened decorations for next year. He’ll put them up early, too. As soon as December first hits, he’ll put all the decorations up and belatedly get his money’s worth.
Hael beams though, nodding. “Better than showing up sloppy! Whenever I’m at Daddy’s house, his friends always smell like old cigarettes,” Hael says, expression twisted with distaste.
“Well, now you do,” Dean says, voice a little grumpy again. “You think I go around making food and hauling furniture for just anyone?”
When Dean asked what happened, Sam had said “I don’t know, man… I guess I wasn’t cut out for that life.”
Castiel feels like his heart is going to shatter as he tries to force the next words out. Claire is his number one priority. Always. “Do you… want to leave again?”
“Well, I um…” Castiel looks a little shy, suddenly. “I got some groceries yesterday, if you’re still amenable to cooking? I don’t want to presume—”
Castiel resumes carding his fingers through Dean's hair, closing his eyes to savor the soft, contended sound he draws out in response. “I am too, Dean.”
“I know you don’t live nearby at all, but… if you’re amenable, perhaps I could… hire you for a weekend, sometime. There’s a lot I’ve neglected. Among other things, I believe my drain needs snaking.”
Murder is a sin. Murder is a mortal sin. Murderers get thrown in prison. Castiel will not kill this man. “That is my seventeen year old
“I borrowed my sister’s car for the weekend, in case we need to make more trips to the store. I thought it would be silly to not use it to pick you up.”
had been upsetting. Castiel had produced a blade Dean had never seen before; silvery looking, ridiculously shiny, then made a cut on his own fucking neck, so that grace could flow from Castiel into the jar. It felt wrong, seeing that beautiful light leech out of him like that. Castiel had assured Dean that it was a mere fraction of his grace, and that it would recharge over time, but… still distressing. It reminded Dean of what it felt like to see Sam with a bleeding head wound back when he still hunted.
“I’m sorry to have kept you waiting,” Castiel says gently, “I confess my nerves got the better of me for a while.”
“Come on,” Castiel says, grunting and getting off the bed. He wrinkles his nose and peels the condom off his thigh. Appalling. “We’re showering.”
“I’m fine, Cas. Honest. You should probably go get ready. Maybe we can continue the Marvel marathon tomorrow. Or Sunday.”
“I mean you’re cute and all, but I’m not putting out for burgers and a buddy cop movie,” Dean says, grinning.
Michael grimaces, while Gabriel and Lucifer both grin. Of course. It’s not the first time he’s seen the partners have some petty bet running. Bored, rich men are terrible.
The light is softer, dimmer, so it’s got to be late afternoon. It’s quiet, save for the sound of some fabric shifting. When Dean turns his head to the side, he sees Castiel is putting up the tent they brought. It’s fairly small, a one-person tent that Jess hadn’t used in years.
It’s incredible, which makes it all the more crushing when Dean’s oven timer goes off. Dean huffs out a laugh, resting his forehead against Castiel’s.
The only problem is that every time he puts it on, just for a moment he thinks about the fact that his father died thinking Dean was dead, and it’s a stone cold fucking bummer every time. Grieving that loss has been weird. By the time Dean found out, he hadn’t seen John in four years, and John had been dead for three of them. Plus, Dean received it in sort of an information dump right before the stay at the psych ward. All in all, he didn’t really grieve it “properly”, in his opinion, but he can’t just decide “alright, time to go through the five stages”.
Dean watches Sam drag over yet another young, felled tree. Kid’s going all out building this thing, even though he’s been awake for over a day now. “It’s hard to leave him for good. Last time we were both dead, our Heavens were connected. Will it be like that again? When he passes?”
. The bedrooms have clean, taupe carpets, curtains that look brand new, and decent sized closets. The view from the windows is pleasant if unremarkable, there are no weird smells aside from the paint and cleaning supplies, the rooms are both a good size… damn it.
! Anyway… the little pipsqueak won, so she got to paint my toes. You got kids…” Mr. Charleson looks at the papers on his desk. “You got kids, Castiel?”
“There might have been buyer information on the package before the crash, but it was gone when I got to it.”
“My apologies,” Castiel says, “a bit of melancholy over a former friendship. Remembering my best friend.”
After the drain, Dean wants to work on the lawn. But it’s barely after eight on a Saturday, Dean doesn’t want to be that asshole that wakes up a bunch of sleeping weekenders with the grating sound of a lawn mower early in the morning. Instead he decides to fix the back screen door. Dean doesn’t even know what happened with it, but it’s dented on the lower end enough that it won’t close properly. He spends about forty minutes fixing it. Instinct tells him to just bang it really hard with the hammer he brought, or the mallet in Castiel’s tool set, but he takes it slow. No sense in possibly wrecking the frame more. He’s careful and methodical, and takes the door off entirely before hammering it flat. He gets it almost perfectly flat before he puts it back on the door frame, and it closes great.
“What can I say, man? Sometimes talking shit out does in fact make people feel worse. Only one way to find out.”
“I thought…” Castiel sighs, looking up. “It’s such a lovely night out, I thought I might walk until I get tired and then find an Uber…”
“So,” Dean says, after he sets a shot of a slightly younger and very drunk Castiel as his contact photo, “I’m thinking of ditching the motel and staying with my brother.”
Castiel nods. “For now. Most of the current reapers are incredibly new. Too new to take on the mantle of Death. Later, Jack will choose one of us, if we are willing. That reaper will be slain and preside over Death.”
“Yeah, I guess. I’m looking forward to doing some work on this guy’s house, honestly. This is way better than showing up to haul lumber or slap a coat of paint on, I’m really going to fix this place up,” Dean says, patting the bag in his lap.
Castiel narrows his eyes. “You certainly had that option locked and loaded. Is this something you’ve done before?”
“Alright. Amanda Heckerling, junior year of high school. We used to go at it like bunnies in the janitor’s closet instead of having lunch. Record time was seven minutes from door close to door open.”
all that relaxed. Sometimes Castiel arrives well after midnight on Friday night, and then plays with Sam for hours instead of coming to bed with Dean. Dean would sulk, but he knows Castiel doesn’t really have many friends, and thinking about how well he gets along Sam makes Dean’s heart all gooey.
Castiel once again takes notice of the scar as Dean is trying to scrub the come off his hips, and he goes still, taking Dean’s arm in his hands, and looking up at him with those god damn soulful blue eyes.
Dean nods, flicking open the button to Castiel’s slacks. He tugs the zipper down past Castiel’s straining erection, yearning to watch but too addicted to Castiel’s kisses to look down. As soon as he has the zipper down Dean hooks his fingers in Castiel’s empty belt loops. He pulls Castiel’s hips forward and scoots his own body closer to the edge of the counter until their erections are rubbing together insistently, separated by two thin layers of increasingly slick fabric. Castiel moans, low and breathless and stupidly fucking hot. He pulls back, hands moving up to hold Dean’s face.
Apparently Dean has a tattoo. It’s on his left bicep, and though it’s partially obscured by the sleeve of his t-shirt, it looks to be a pile of skulls.
“Jiffy Cab? If Missouri is manning the phones tonight, tell her Gabriel says ‘wassup’,” Gabriel says with a leer. Dean’s actually met Missouri Mosely, she’d snap Gabriel like a twig if he so much as smiled at her the wrong way.
Claire rushes forward to hug Castiel, and he gives her a solid squeeze before Sam comes back in holding two plastic jars.
The problem is, the group is Tessa’s, not Dean’s. He may have known Charlie a little longer, but by the time he moved to Wichita she definitely had a solid group, and Tessa was part of that group. Mick, Ketch, Jo, Vic, Ash, even Charlie… they’re Tessa’s people first and foremost. And Dean likes them a lot… except for god damn Ketch, of course. Sometimes when he thinks about maybe ending things with Tessa, their group is what stops him. He doesn’t know what that would do to their dynamic. If people would pick sides, if he’d lose all his friends. He doesn’t want that.
“He was hard to please, growing up. I never knew if it was because of Mom, or if he was just… like that. He didn’t give out approval easily. It made Sam not like him very much, but it made me desperate for that damn approval.” Dean scrubs a hand over his face. “I’m going somewhere with this, I just… I’m trying to frame it, I guess.”
“No… Amelia was not fond of public displays of affection, she never would have been on board with…” Castiel gestures to where Sam is helping Brunette Ruby hook up her bra.
When he comes back out he’s in a pair of jeans, and a black t-shirt. His hair is toweled dry, his teeth are clean, and he has three condoms and the bottle of Astroglide in his front right pocket.
Castiel sighs. This is not his information to share. “I’ve mentioned my daughter… I suppose a background check will report me as having a son.”
sure of his own motivation. After all, why should he care if a grown man wants to have some fun? “Forget what I said, Cas. Just do things that make you happy until… until you feel better.”
sorry, Claire.” Every time he slips up, does what Claire has told him is called “misgendering”, Castiel feels like a failure.
“They’ll wait and thank me for the privilege. Glad you came, boy,” Bobby says in what passes for a warm tone.
sign a two year contract to get the deal. Claire’s excited, they haven’t had cable or internet since the divorce. Castiel’s glad Claire will go back to using her laptop and stop stealing his phone every time she wants to play on Tweetspace or Crushing Candies or whatever it is she does online.
“On the bed,” Dean says. His voice is soft, but firm. It’s inexplicably settling Castiel’s nerves. He obeys, crawling onto Dean’s bed. “Okay, first…” Dean pulls a paper out of his nightstand, and he hands it to Castiel, who skims it long enough to see that Dean is officially not teeming with sexually transmitted diseases. So he’s
Castiel would love to disagree, but it would be a lie. He and Amelia learned early on that their personal idea of what was “sin” didn’t quite match up. No marriage is perfect. Eventually they learned what topics were best left not discussed. Amelia wouldn’t begrudge Castiel’s more liberal beliefs so long as Claire was brought up in Amelia’s church. It hadn’t seemed so bad at the time, but if Castiel knew then what he knows now, he’d never have agreed to it.
“I found human remains in the living room. I thought we’d deal with it after a rest.” Castiel pulls a bag of rock salt out of his pack and begins making a circle around the tent. “The corpse has been there well over a decade, maybe even two.” He sighs. “I would understand if this… sullies the home for you.”
“Regardless, don’t let her handle any of the sharper implements while crafting. A high IQ cannot make up for undeveloped dexterity.”
“And… and our first kiss can always be this cute mistake we made, because we’re so comfortable with each other we didn’t even realize we’d done something… new?” Dean tries.
“I’m not supposed to laugh, right?” Dean says, grinning when Castiel’s expression sours. “Alright, alright. Where to?”
,” Castiel moans, toes curling as more of him goes into Dean’s mouth. Dean says something in response, but his mouth is too full of Castiel for the words to be intelligible. He has a tight grip on Castiel’s hips, but after a moment he starts smoothing his hands up Castiel’s sides, to his chest. His thumbs tease at Castiel’s nipples, just enough to have him squirming, cock twitching in the warmth of Dean’s wonderful mouth.
Even though he’s not as sore after hunts anymore, Dean still takes it easy. Often his mind needs a break, and part of it is that he’s simply used to operating this way. With Castiel fretting over him like he’s still actively dying, Dean hopes his rest period will at least be full of really, really good food.
Castiel smiles. “You needn’t look so uncomfortable, they’re wonderful. I’d hang these in my own home.”
“My grace flowing into you, our plants, occasionally your family and neighbors, that’s all fine. But a fetus is… there is a lot of growing and changing and even mutating happening, I’m concerned about what grace could do to that process.”
“Alright, well I won’t argue with that. But don’t turn into some possessive little shit, okay? I don’t want to be embarrassed to know you.”
It’s not all that hard to leave Pontiac once they get going. Castiel casts a few lingering glances at familiar sites he might not see again, particularly his boyhood home, but after months of drifting like a specter on the fringes of his former life, saying goodbye isn’t that difficult.
Dean spends the night watching TV. There’s a Dr. Sexy M.D. marathon on cable, and Dean’s pretty excited; this was his favorite show before the island. The only problem is that the episodes are from two seasons after Dean disappeared,
to be on purpose. “I’m trying to lose weight,” he says sadly before unwrapping the silverware bundle left at Tessa’s place.
“I’m flexible enough to put my ankles behind my ears. Not very comfortable… though maybe these are more tricks than talents? I could show you.”
Dean reaches over and smacks Castiel over the back of the head. “You know it’s not like that, don’t be that kind of drunk.”
Dean feels lighter than air as he bustles around Castiel’s kitchen, frying up bacon and slices of french toast. He supposes a good orgasm, a good cry, and a good shower can do wonders. Castiel doesn’t have a washing machine in his house and all of Dean’s clothes are dirty, so he’s wearing some of Castiel’s. A pair of faded jeans, a blue Marvin the Martian t-shirt, and a pair of comically orange briefs. Castiel for some reason owns a lot of orange underwear.
The mask of nonchalance collapses almost immediately, and Dean’s face cycles through so many emotions Castiel can’t keep up.
One would think Dean wouldn’t be able to feel adrenaline as a ghost, but maybe that’s just residual humanity. He turns away from where Sam is chugging a bottle of water, and there is Castiel, standing just in front of the barn. Judging by Sam’s utter lack of reaction, Castiel is currently invisible to humans.
“Holy fucking shit!” Claire yelps, eyes wide. She winces, catching Jimmy’s eyes in the mirror. “I mean… holy fudging shoot?”
Henriksen smiles. “You’ve been very good about keeping your appointments this month, another good sign of progress.”
Today is Saturday, and it’s nearing the end of March. Claire’s been out since early this morning, making the most of her Spring Break, so Castiel is on his own for the day.
They both order medium burgers, and decide to split an order of onion rings on the side. The food is good. Dean lets out a few embarrassing moans when he’s eating his burger, but so does Castiel. Dean’s tempted to have a beer, but Castiel says he hates drinking even one beer if he’ll be driving, and Dean doesn’t want to be the only one mildly intoxicated.
a total stickler for rules, Dean knows that. What was real to him on the island isn’t real outside the island.
Dean sighs, face mashed into his steering wheel. He’s parked under a street light outside Castiel’s sister’s house for some reason, he barely remembers driving here. The lights are off, it’s two in the morning after all. One of their neighbors is on their porch, though, giving Dean’s car the stink eye. The guy probably thinks he’s here to rob the place or some shit. He should give Dean some credit, if he was going to come rob houses, he’d show up in a quieter car. He waves, because why not, not sure if the man sees him until the man suddenly goes rigid and rushes back into the house.
Dean stands slowly, uncomfortable. This is way too intimate a moment for him to be witnessing, and Castiel seems like he’s gotten past the fear portion of the call. “I’m gonna—”
look nice. He’s not wearing anything special, just jeans and a green t-shirt, but he looks damn good. Dean probably shouldn’t have said anything, though.
“Okay, so… you probably know by now that my mom is dead.” It’s never come up specifically, but Castiel had pieced that together over the past few months. “She died when I was four… it was a house fire. I don’t remember it, really… I mean I was
From Cas - 8/14/17 - 11:10am: The problem isn’t so much deciding what to do if I go back as it is deciding what I’ll do with myself if I don’t.
confusing. Is it perhaps somehow narcissistic to be turned on by characters he himself created? He’s giving this some deep consideration when he hears “hey” from the doorway to his bedroom. He yelps, slamming his laptop shut and looking up at the visitor.
Lucifer shrugs and stands, grinning. “Sexuality isn’t always set in stone,” he says, giving Castiel a once over. “Let me know if you want any help sussing yours out.” Lucifer winks and walks away.
Dean goes to bed smiling, but it’s no surprise to him when he just can’t fall asleep. Over ninety minutes pass while Dean tries to relax and fall asleep on this comfortable couch. It just won’t happen. Wanting it won’t make it happen, won’t stop him from spending the night staring at the ceiling, or stop his back from aching slightly after he goes outside to sleep on the ground.
“No, I just… hadn’t really thought about that. I think it’d be a good thing to try, see if I can sleep if I’m outside but on a nice comfy bed.”
“Admiring is a strong word,” Castiel says, mouth faster than his brain. He grimaces when he realizes what he’s just said, but Mr. Charleson looks gleeful.
“I’m gonna be honest,” Dean pants, sweaty palm skimming to the front of Castiel’s body, wrapping around his cock, “I forgave you pretty much instantly, Cas.”
?” Now Castiel’s pain is giving way to irritation. “It’s not easy to steal souls, Dean, even for him. He truly went through the trouble of snatching your spirit like a thief to
By the end of the day, Castiel has assertions from all four partners that they did not send him a phony Valentine, though now they’re demanding Castiel find out who sent it and tell them. Castiel can only assume they already have another bet going. It must be wonderful to be bored and incredibly wealthy.
Castiel is staring at the ground. He wills himself to speak. “I spent days wondering who left me that gift on Valentine's Day, hoping it wasn’t some cruel prank, wanting to believe someone out there felt that way about me. And then I let it go. I was probably never going to find out who sent it, and for all I knew it was someone whose feelings I couldn’t return.” Castiel looks up at Dean, terrified by how neutral, how
Dean breaks their kiss to move his lips along Castiel’s jaw, his neck. He bites down and Castiel finds himself moaning Dean’s name, startled and unabashed. He feels almost feverish, dizzy with want. He slips both hands under Dean’s shirt.
Big, bright, illegal fucking fireworks, even. M-80s, bottle rockets, roman candles, the whole shebang. They fall into each other, lips moving with an eager tenderness, legs stumbling a little as they move; Dean thinks one of his toes gets stepped on at one point and he doesn’t care.
Tessa’s on the couch when he walks in, feet propped up on the coffee table. Her fingernails and toenails are painted blood red.
feel nice buried in his ass. For now, though, he ruts against Castiel, the drag of skin against skin making him shudder and tremble just a little. He kisses Castiel again and again, and each kiss is longer, deeper, dirtier than the last.
“That’s…” Sam scrubs a hand over his face. “I mean that’s sweet, but Dean as long as you don’t have swear words or naked chicks on your t-shirt I think whatever you want to wear is fine.”
Dean stares back at Castiel for a long moment, trying to fight the shame, the feeling that Castiel needs to go, that no one should look at Dean while he’s being
“Yeah,” Dean says, smiling when Castiel’s fingers trace over the tattoo on Dean’s chest; that odd reminder that Castiel was in Dean’s life long before he even knew there
They spend a few hours watching a football game on TV. Or, at least Sam and Castiel do. The three of them are all on the couch, Castiel in the middle, and Dean spends the entire game thinking about how Castiel’s leg is pressed up against his. By the time Sam turns the TV off, Dean’s not even sure who the fuck was playing or if they watched the full game.
By the time they’re finished it’s nearly eight, and they have a three story house complete with a yard and a garage mounted on the green posterboard. Castiel takes about a thousand pictures with his phone, and gets Dean and Hael to pose with it.
“Nah, I wouldn’t really want something that sounded just like James,” they say, picking at their sandwich. “I was thinking of asking you to pick one.”
Amelia’s eyes turn hard and angry, and Jimmy’s heart breaks at the sight of it. “We’re doing this, Jimmy.”
“Well… I’ve already shared my story about my boyfriend screwing me out of a job. Oh, I’ve been stabbed.”
“I like spending time with you, Dean. I wouldn’t change my mind if a six year old didn’t find you fun. Well… as long as you weren’t unkind to her. But it’s hard to imagine you being unkind to a child.”
“I’m glad to know Claire has found such compassionate new friends. Well… if you three get hungry, there’s leftover macaroni and cheese, leftover pasta salad, leftover meatloaf, and leftover mashed potatoes…”
uh… kind of a religious nut. You learn a lot about a guy when he spends two days carving designs in your torso.”
years ago, and Dean’s poor dick is fine now, thanks,” Dean says, crossing his legs and glaring when he hears Victor and Ash snicker.
“I got a job offer,” Castiel says tentatively. “An acting job, I mean. I’m thinking about taking it.”
“Uh…” Dean looks down at his clothing; a brown and gold flannel shirt and ratty jeans. “These jeans, and this shirt in blue…”

“Ah… a breakup. We… my ex and I... had many mutual friends. His group had become my group, but when we broke up, it became pretty clear that they were still
“Mhmm,” Castiel says, voice fond. “Though I have no idea how I’ll hide this in the meantime.” They both wipe their hands on Castiel’s shirt, since it’s already a loss. Castiel pulls the shirt and his jeans off while Dean tucks himself away.
“Hey, so, I hope you have fun this weekend, I’m so glad to see you being social,” Sam says earnestly. They’re idling at a red light, and there’s just enough streetlamp light for Dean to see the big sappy puppy eyes Sam is giving him. “I know Jo and I were trying to get you come to Bobby’s party, but that was us kind of making your issues about us, and not thinking about what
There’s this urge Castiel has, as he spends his Friday puttering around the apartment. He feels like he should go say hello to Dean, maybe thank him for yesterday. He did, after all, say he was Castiel’s friend. But Dean is also the moodiest person Castiel’s ever met, and he’s a little terrified of knocking on the door and being met with a scowl rather than a smile.
There’s something… odd about Castiel’s time at the store. There’s a strained dynamic between Dean and John that Castiel can’t quite put his finger on. There’s love there, certainly… but there’s also this energy that’s sad and guilty. Perhaps they have a past rift that hasn’t quite mended. Castiel is very curious, but asking about it is of course out of the question. Instead, Castiel asks about something that is equally none of his business.
“It had a burn on one side. Don’t really know how it got there. I mean there were no other signs of people on the island, so I don’t know what could have caused it other than lightning, maybe. Anyway it was just a little different from the other trees, which made it interesting, so it was my favorite.”
Vaguely, Dean is aware that his spirit has gone from wearing the clothes he died in, to wearing the clothes he last saw Castiel in, bloody handprint still gripping his shoulder.
“The guy from yesterday... that's Benny. He was in my unit. Out there, we were brothers. Out there, there was no one I trusted more. He was good too, just like me. Calm in a storm, never lost his head, smiled at the worst of times… always fuckin’ whistling, always had my back. Until the day he didn’t.” Dean laughs bitterly. “We got an order from our CO… and it just didn’t smell right. Building full of insurgents, gotta clear em’ out. No prisoners.”
“I just took it out of the oven,” Castiel says, stepping to the side to let Dean in. Dean gets hit in the face with a whiff of
Getting the mattresses into the elevator takes some finagling, they opt to move everything out by the elevator then take one mattress up at a time. Castiel smiles when he opens the door of his new home, and finds Sam and Claire assembling the dining table.
Dean sighs. “I mean… not everyone is open minded, this is a red state after all. Getting your jollies on the dance floor would probably be safer at a gay bar.”
“Good, that would have been fuckin’ weird. Anyway, Sam and Amelia sounded great on paper, they really got along intellectually, but holy
It feels like a big deal. This isn’t some minor bit of trivia like the day Dean realized Castiel sorts his M&M’s into separate colors and eats the piles in alphabetical order, this is a big piece of Castiel’s past.
“I suppose I did get carried away. Bartholomew and Ruby were nice though… but they wanted me to, ah… they were looking to take things further than I was interested in taking them,” Castiel says.
“I have one of these too,” Castiel says enthusiastically. He’d put the paper in his back pocket and completely forgotten about it by the time he arrived at Dean’s apartment. He hands it over to Dean, who glances at it for a fraction of a second before tossing it to the side.
closed off on Tuesday morning. They fill out paperwork and whatnot, and Dean mostly communicates through grunts and monosyllabic words. Castiel would love to trade places with Claire, who has taken her copy of the apartment key and gone to start moving their sparse belongings inside while Castiel sits in Dean’s living room, curious but convinced that if he takes in his surroundings it will somehow anger Dean. He thought he saw a glimpse of a painting on the wall when he came in, but other than that he’s mostly focused on the sturdy oak coffee table and the plush brown couch.
,” Dean says, voice hoarse. A minute or so has passed, he thinks, maybe longer. It can’t have been too long, they’re both still panting and sweaty. He feels Castiel’s tongue on his skin.
“You look beautiful, Claire,” Castiel says. And she does. They found her a lovely dress at the mall last night, an item with short sleeves and a turtleneck. Claire loved the style of the dress, but to her dismay it only came in pink, which she said felt like overkill. She’s paired it with black work boots and white socks, and the black faux-leather jacket she picked out at the secondhand store months ago. Castiel thinks the ensemble is very
It’s fine, though. Life is still good, Castiel is still very glad to be in Jasperville. Claire is doing wonderfully in school, despite the fact that she seems to spend all of her free time with her friends or on the phone with Kaia. Castiel’s branching out a little himself, too. He goes jogging with Meg some mornings, and last week he went to a movie with Sam, the Rubys, and Sam’s co-worker Jo. He had a great time, despite being at least five years older than everyone else. He went to a St. Patrick’s Day party with people from work and enjoyed himself… even got a great video of Gabriel doing body shots off the usually straight-laced Naomi. He went on another date, this time with Meg’s friend Lilith. It was terrible, because evidently Meg has terrifying friends, but at least Castiel gave it a shot. Plus Meg was eventually able to retrieve the wallet and keys Lilith stole from him, so all’s well that ends well, in Castiel’s opinion.
not there,” Dean says, exasperated. He gets off the couch so he can turn and show Castiel his back. There are no sigils there, no signs, no symbols. There are wings, though. They cover his shoulder blades and reach all the way down to the base of his spine.
Dean’s not exactly a morning person, but seeing Castiel in that state makes it easier to feel like one.
He rolls onto his side, and lifts an arm slowly, giving Castiel a chance to react, to back away, something. He doesn’t, and Dean curls his fingers around the back of Castiel’s neck, tugging Castiel forward as gently as he can.
“You’ve taken a big step in choosing to create a new friendship, and I’m proud of the work you’re putting in.”
Wonderful, now Castiel is thinking about Dean in pink panties. He clears his throat. “Ah… my p-point is… you don’t have to feel sorry. Like you said, you can’t control dreams. I’m just glad you’re okay.”
Who says "brewskies" anymore? “Yeah, yeah your highness, I’ve been out hunting evil for two weeks but I can see how going
“If you say so,” Dean says, because he doesn’t want to push. Sam says he’s too pushy, Dean’s trying to prove that wrong. “So why are you asking if I remember him?”
are still at the bar. His friends saw him staring at Castiel, and then Dean just disappeared. Fucking fuck, it’s been at least half an hour. Dean’s a fucking idiot, there’s no way Ketch hasn’t already told Tessa about this. Fuck.
“That can’t be good for the spine,” Castiel remarks as Dean comes out with two bowls overfull with ice cream.
Dean spent a long, long time without human contact on the island. He forgot what it was like to kiss someone, to be held by friend or lover, skin touching skin. Even now, he’s still a bit touch starved. He doesn’t like when people get too close, mostly he won’t hug anyone other than Sam, and if someone’s touching him these days it’s probably a doctor or a dentist. So this? Castiel lightly pressed against him, tongue barely flirting with Dean’s lips, fingers clutching Dean’s jacket collar? Awesome.
Dean looks away then, expression a bit ashamed. “It doesn’t happen that often anymore, and I’ll knock a few bucks off the rent for the month… kinda the standard procedure.”
Tessa definitely looks different, though. Her medium length hair has inexplicably grown several inches, and she’s wearing a soft, simple looking white dress that Dean’s never seen before. She smiles when she sees him staring at her hair.
Castiel narrows his eyes, looking back and forth between the partners. “You’ve made some sort of bet, haven’t you?”
“No. You’re going to finish your coffee, then you’re changing into your suit in the bathroom, and then you’re going to come tell all the kids about how fun it is to be an actor, and remind them to work hard, and take lots of pictures.”
“Go away,” he says, because there is no punishment for being curt to Lucifer, “this is my lunch break.” Castiel is ruder to Lucifer than he has ever been to anyone in his
“I know, I…” Castiel buries his face in his hands. “I don’t know what to do, I’ve never been attracted to a man before.”
Castiel sets his book on the floor and swings his legs out of Dean’s lap. “If you are concerned that I will find your desires humorous or worthy of judgment, please know you don’t need to worry.”
Dean’s server finally shows up with Dean’s steak tortellini and Tessa’s shrimp gnocchi, which gets set down in front of Castiel.
“I’m supposed to unclog 3B’s shower when he gets home.” Dean is still holding Castiel shirt, and Castiel’s fingers at some point found their way to the belt loops of Dean’s jeans.
Dean looks slightly more composed when Castiel comes back wrapped in the soft, blue robe he keeps hanging on the back of his bedroom door. Castiel hopes they can pretend the last few minutes didn’t happen.
They don’t talk about the night before. It’s not awkward or anything, but they’re not quite addressing it. They shared a moment, a nice moment even, but they’re not really picking at it right now. But, there’s also a moment when their ankles bump underneath Castiel’s little dining table, and Castiel doesn’t move his foot away, and neither does Dean.
The tears building in Sam’s eyes finally start to break free, and when Dean offers Sam a sedative he just laughs and pulls Dean into a bone-crushing hug.
Castiel relents and picks out a custom end table. It’s beautiful, it has the appearance of delicate, twisting branches coiling around each other, though there’s a sturdy pillar hidden in the center to keep the piece from easily toppling over or breaking under the weight of the drawer at the top.
There are long stretches of time where Dean feels not at all present, more distracted by the sound of Castiel’s laugh, or the scent of ginger and cinnamon that seems to cling to him. Twice Dean loses track of the conversation because he’s too busy wondering what conditioner Castiel uses.
“That sounds— AAAH!!!” Castiel yelps when he realizes Claire is standing next to the truck, peering at him through the window.
Castiel nods, resuming his eating. The meal mostly passes in silence. Dean knows what he said isn’t enough, that Castiel is having some sort of crisis of identity. He wishes he knew what he could say to fix it, but he’s had enough emotional turmoil to know that things don’t usually get better because of a few hopeful words. Especially since Dean doesn’t have the same artistic knack for words.
“Hey I do okay,” Dean says. Which is true enough. The divorce from Billie was four years ago, Dean’s had one serious girlfriend and plenty of dates since then.
a joke, Jesus fucking Christ. Just cause I’m bi doesn’t mean I wanna jump your bones for fuck’s sake.”
“I mean that alcohol might not be what she needs right now,” Castiel says. There’s an odd tone to his voice, like he’s trying to infer a point that’s sailing right over Dean’s head.
moved in before we start worrying about ID’s and school registration, and we probably shouldn’t get furniture until we’re
“Maybe your standards are too high. You can’t just step into a first date and expect to have what you had with your ex right away.”
As much as Dean wants to just crash in his brother’s dinky one-bedroom house in Lawrence, he has work in the morning. There’s no way he’s going to feel like waking up at six so he can be in Wichita by eight and work by eight-thirty so he can spend nine hours having his life force sucked away by people that think everything his company does wrong is his singular responsibility. Hard pass. At eight, he heads back to Wichita, Impala blasting AC/DC while Dean tries hard to forget about Castiel, actor on some terrible show that Dean doesn’t even like. Why couldn’t this at least be happening with the guy from Doctor Sexy? Now
“Still, it felt like I was… part of a group. I haven’t had that since the show wrapped filming. I’ve missed it terribly.”
“You look…” Dean trails off, because his first instinct was to say “smashing”, but that sounds like something Ketch would say. Or Austin Powers.
Dean smiles. “I have that one sometimes. Show up for the first day of class, big test, and I’m wearing nothing but my ex-girlfriend’s pink satin panties.”
“Okay. Uh… despite my liking a quiet building, once in awhile my apartment has… noise disturbances.”
The apartment still looks mostly the same, but Dean can see the holes where he used to be. For better or worse, this is his home, and now he’s supposed to go get in his car and drive away and leave his home.
child, with a lot of energy and a vocabulary probably larger than Dean’s. She takes to Dean instantly, and after a noisy lunch at a nearby pizza place, she asks Dean to help her build a structurally sound (her words, not his) popsicle stick castle.
Sam shrugs and shovels a forkful of spinach into his giant mouth. “Just wondering,” he says around his mouthful.
and every day I feel like I’m forgetting something, that there’s somewhere I’m supposed to be… but it’s only my body thinking I need to roll out of bed and into the makeup trailer.”
for a cooking novice?” Claire says as Castiel sets the box containing the slow cooker on their table.
Castiel has no idea if she’s calling him Clarence as a throwback to their earlier conversation, or if she’s legitimately forgotten his name.
“I just uh… want to get some new stuff with my money... clothes... and uh… I mean I know I could ask Jo, but I’m not really
understand what Castiel is getting at. Dean’s had artistic blocks plenty of times, it always passes. It can be annoying, even make Dean restless, but it’s never been like whatever Castiel is going through.
“I’ve been doing a lot of reading about the relationship between genitalia and identity, and I think—”
Despair and concern wash over Dean in waves; not his own, it’s Castiel’s. Castiel drops to his knees next to Dean, wings out and flapping in distress. They look odd… in fact all of Castiel looks odd. There’s this golden light… shifting and twisting like smoke… like those artistic renditions of auras Dean’s seen in books, only… this aura seems larger, it has its own shape… what is that?
“I’ll remind you,” James says. “It’s okay if you slip up, Dad. The fact that you’re willing to try, that’s… that means the world to me.”
He’s not surprised Dean is at home instead of with everyone else. Dean loves feeding people, loves taking care of them, but he rarely seems to want to stick around in the larger groups. When he does join in on their games, though, he wins every round. Dean has incredible hand-eye coordination.
battered and weathered and covered in blood. Oh, okay sure that’s fine, that’s not terrifying at all.
