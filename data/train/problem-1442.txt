When it came time to confront the younger brother, found behind a condemned building, Sherlock was so sure that he would confess and be led away without a fight that he reacted just a hair too slowly to the gun that the suspect pulled from his waistband. Fortunately, John knew better and leapt into action, quite literally, knocking Sherlock to the ground and just out of the path of a bullet. Lestrade and his team rounded the corner into the alley just then, took the brother down, and led him away without further incident.
Although John was initially fine letting Sherlock dictate the pace and nature of their relationship, he soon realized that he’d have to nudge Sherlock along in some ways. Sherlock rarely sought out affection or sex, but was enthusiastically amenable when John initiated it, so John began to initiate it more and more. Gentle touches in the kitchen, a kiss with a cup of tea, an enticing text whilst on the way home from the clinic. After a while, Sherlock began making his own tentative overtures. John found his hesitation endearing but resolved to make Sherlock understand that he was very much welcome to snog John whenever he liked.
For a moment, Sherlock considered continuing, saying the things he had been thinking for ages but never felt ready or able to say, but he heard the telltale shifting of metal that signaled a visitor. Moriarty’s face came into view over his head and the grin told him that they would be trying something new.
Mycroft deigned to look up from his mobile for a moment. He spoke quickly but enunciated as if he were speaking to a dull-witted child. “Moriarty never stays anywhere long enough to become truly established, nor does he invite those into his confidence who cannot be trusted, which is nearly everyone. Most of those in his employ couldn’t provide more information on him than you could. The name of the man most likely to have provided the brute force aspect of Sherlock’s abduction is Sebastian Moran, an ex-Army colonel who’s served under Moriarty for years. We know little of him after his discharge from service, but we do know that he is unfailingly loyal, disciplined, and capable of extreme violence.” He paused to see if John had anything to add. After a moment, he continued. “My people have already checked all CCTV cameras in the area and have tracked Moriarty’s vehicle to a multistorey car park two kilometres from here. It was abandoned there and video of all exiting vehicles in the time thereafter has not yet revealed what second car Moriarty might have taken. The first car has no viable fingerprints, shoeprints, fibres, hairs, or physical evidence of any kind. The vehicle itself is registered to a man who’s been dead for three years and had no criminal record. My people are currently using facial recognition software and a variety of other highly-classified means to look for any scrap of evidence that might provide us with the faintest clue where Sherlock is. Do you find this satisfactory or is there another avenue you would like me to pursue, John?”
“That doesn’t make me feel better.”
“So, have you got a girlfriend then?”
John felt himself sag against the wall for a moment. He grabbed Sherlock’s head more to steady himself than anything, but when Sherlock let out a rumbling growl, John wove his fingers into Sherlock’s curls and kept them there. As Sherlock worked John’s cock with enthusiasm, John had to force himself to let Sherlock control the pace. The urge to use his hands to allow him to fuck Sherlock’s mouth was strong, but he had manners. The sensations Sherlock was drawing out of him were unlike anything he had ever felt, despite having been the recipient of a fair few blowjobs in his life. He worried that this would all be over far too soon, so he closed his eyes and tried to will himself to last.
Before he knew what was happening, he felt hands on his shoulders turning him and pushing him back against the wall, where he was faced with Sherlock’s wild-eyed expression. Sherlock seemed to be searching John’s eyes, and he must have found what he was looking for. After a moment that stretched on for ages, Sherlock practically pounced on John, crushing his mouth against John’s in an artless kiss. John’s muffled noise of surprise did nothing to dissuade Sherlock, who gripped John’s head in both hands, his fingers splayed and curling around John’s jaw to keep him firmly where Sherlock wanted him.
“What?”
Sherlock sighed, apparently quite put-upon. “John, your concern for my wellbeing is duly noted, but I refuse to pretend this case isn’t at least an 8. Now must we continue this pointless bickering, or am I permitted to do my job?”
John met her eyes and nodded, simultaneously thanking her for the information, acknowledging that he understood her meaning, and ending the conversation. He welcomed the EMTs into the flat and gave them the rundown of what had happened, leaving out the part about the psychopaths who broke in and kidnapped Sherlock. A simple fall at home, not that unusual for an older woman. John nodded once to Mrs. Hudson to signal his departure, then stepped out onto the sidewalk and brought his mobile to his ear.
“Shall we begin?”
Both men hung up, and John felt a thrill go through him from head to toe. They were going to get Sherlock. They were going to save him.
Tears, unbidden and most unwelcome, sprung to John’s eyes. He turned on his heel and picked up his coat. He cleared his throat but the words came out rough anyway. “Well you needn’t worry about that anymore. I’ll let you get on with your pristine, emotionless existence.”
“Another one! Another me! A dead one!” Sherlock exclaimed, sharing the news as if he had hit the lotto or discovered a new element.
“Try. Harder.” And with that, John hung up, returning his full attention to the screen.
Sherlock was glad for the respite from John’s gaze, as even someone of average intelligence would have noticed the wounded expression that flickered across Sherlock’s features. He wasn’t sure what hurt worse – John saying that their life together wasn’t enough for him, or John believing Sherlock to be “unattached and emotionless.” It was silly, he knew, to take offense to that assessment given that he had worked hard to cultivate that persona his entire life. Nevertheless, he had hoped that John would understand, intrinsically, that Sherlock was very much attached and emotional. While he would normally be proud that his affect had fooled someone so completely, instead he found himself disappointed that John hadn’t seen through him. How could John not know? How could he not know how Sherlock truly felt?
who this looks like,” John stated, his voice low as though they might be overheard.
“What?” John inquired, squinting at Sherlock as if the answer would come to him if he scrunched up his face hard enough.
“Please, John. Please. I won’t break. I need you. I need you
Sherlock pounced on John and snogged him like it was the end of the world. John laughed and kissed Sherlock back, wrapping his arms around the consulting detective.
Two hours and thirty-two minutes after John learnt of Sherlock’s abduction, Lestrade’s team was leaving the flat. Mycroft had long since disappeared, but true to his word, had assigned one of his people to update John on the hour or sooner. So far, none of the updates had been of any use, but John was grateful for them regardless. Lestrade lingered at the door to the flat, apparently examining his shoes. John glanced over at him and nodded. “I’ll ring you if I hear anything, yeah?” he offered the DI, knowing full well that he’d have no reason to call. Lestrade simply looked at John, dipped his head once in acknowledgement, then left.
John’s mobile was at his ear before Sherlock even finished speaking. “You know where he is
He heard Moriarty move closer, his voice coming only inches from Sherlock’s ear. “I’m told this one is particularly dangerous. Do tell me if it gets to be too much, won’t you?” The scraping of the chair and rustle of movement told Sherlock that Moriarty was getting comfortable for this next show.
“Anything?” John asked him, agitated that Mycroft was being so reticent, but also knowing that Mycroft would tell him if something truly urgent or important were discovered.
“They were both white, and neither looked to be particularly old. One was large, muscular, the other one much more slight. Not quite so scrawny as our Sherlock, but a much smaller build than the other fellow.”
John sighed.
just wasn’t working. His brain still felt sluggish. He struggled to string two thoughts together, much less work out the brilliant deductions he normally produced with hardly any effort. The kinds of deductions that made John look at him like he hung the moon.
Sherlock couldn’t see all of the implements it held, but it was clearly a torture kit. Blades, blunt instruments, surgical tools, you name it. Sherlock idly wondered which one of those tools would be the one that finally broke him. Despite his elephantine ego, he was ultimately a rational man; he knew that everyone, including the great Sherlock Holmes, had a limit. It was just a matter of time before Ex-Military found it.
Entering the foyer, John felt anticipation building along his spine. If Sherlock were his boyfriend, surely that meant they would…kiss, at least? Maybe more? Desire bloomed in John as he tried to tell himself to calm down. Following Sherlock up the stairs didn’t help, not with
“Boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way.”
John found Sherlock in repose once again, fully immersed in his mind palace. John supposed he should be thankful that Sherlock hadn’t used the cover of darkness to slip away and chase after his would-be murderer alone. John bristled at the knowledge that Sherlock and John hadn’t truly come to an understanding the prior evening and that Sherlock was still very likely to do something astoundingly stupid.
John brought his hand to his face and wiped his palm from forehead to chin as if to clear his vaguely-annoyed expression. Nodding, he replied, “I know, Sherlock. You’ve been clear on that since the first case. But haven’t you ever…” John shook his head, knowing the answer to his question already and knowing how stupid it would sound to ask. He asked anyway. “Haven’t you ever wanted more than The Work?”
John held up a two-finger salute in various directions, hoping he would be facing the camera for at least a moment.
?” He pushed himself up from the couch and began pacing the room. “You people lead ludicrous lives. Being held hostage by one’s own emotions may not be a moral failing, but it’s certainly not a virtue either.”
John smirked and sighed, lifting his head from the couch and sitting upright. “You’re right, I should know better,” he replied, half to himself. He nodded, then patted Sherlock’s foot before extricating himself from the couch. Sherlock sat up before he could stop himself.
He ruminated on the possibilities for some time. When he heard a small noise come from the computer, he straightened up and blinked rapidly, noticing for the first time that the sun had moved quite a ways and it was now well into the afternoon. When John saw what Moriarty and Moran were doing next, he wondered if he would vomit after all.
John leaned forward and spoke to the driver, one of Mycroft’s minions no doubt. “I need to be there now. I don’t care what you have to do.” He sat back and dialed Mycroft, but unsurprisingly the elder Holmes didn’t answer. John sat back, staring out the window but seeing nothing, wishing that he were a praying man so he could get some extra luck on their side.
John’s dreams were not kind to him. He went from bleeding in the sand, certain that help would never come, to the alley where they had confronted the brother. His mind supplied him with a perfect record of the previous afternoon, except in his dream, he’s too late. He doesn’t push Sherlock out of the way. He doesn’t notice the gun quickly enough. He’s too slow, too slow, and the bullet rips through Sherlock like he’s made out of tissue paper.
“I know it’s not your
“’It doesn’t have to mean anything’? Are you serious?”
“The killer wants me in these places, he wants me out of my comfort zone,” Sherlock concluded, more to himself than to John and Lestrade.
“Worried I might not be presentable, John?” Deflection, of course. Always deflection.
John couldn’t remember making his way back to Baker Street, but he somehow found himself standing in the kitchen staring at the live feed of Sherlock on his phone. He forced himself to drink a full glass of water and eat a reasonable amount of food from the small haul he brought back from the shops on Monday. Yesterday? Was it truly only yesterday? It felt like years.
“Yoo-hoo! Boys!”
Sometime later, he surfaced into full consciousness with a scream in his throat. He found himself back on the table, restrained at the head, shoulders, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. The table was level this time. There was no sign of Moriarty or Sebastian. Now completely present, Sherlock could feel the panic and dread clawing at him more intensely than before. Tears pooled in his eyes, so he closed them. He tried to think once more of John.
John cut him off with a stern “shut up” and then met Sherlock’s eyes and offered a cheeky grin. When Sherlock’s face relaxed, John grasped the consulting detective’s cock in his hand. Sherlock’s eyes shut automatically and he arched his back, his head falling to the back of the sofa. John marveled at the feel of Sherlock in his hand, then licked his lips again and decided to go for it.
When he was sure that Sherlock was well and truly out, John delicately extricated himself and popped off to the loo. He wiped himself off with a warm, wet flannel, then returned to clean at least the bulk of the mess from Sherlock while he slumbered. Grabbing a blanket from the closet, he tucked Sherlock in and turned out the light, then laid down himself. He intended to sleep, but couldn’t stop staring at his flatmate. Best friend. Partner. Boyfriend. All that time spent dancing around each other and here they were, finally. He tried not to think of Sherlock’s abduction and the events that finally pushed them together, but he knew it would be ages before he could get the images of Sherlock from the live feed out of his mind—if ever. Sherlock’s screams of agony would likely haunt him until his dying day, even if he spent the rest of his life coming home to this absolutely mad, brilliant, infuriating man. An intense protective rage flared in John’s chest for a moment and he took Sherlock into his arms once again, burying his face in Sherlock’s neck.
something, but there was nothing for him
It wasn’t until John was already in the cab to head back to New Scotland Yard that he realised he hadn’t even examined the body.
Once the cool air became truly uncomfortable rather than soothing, John decided to get up and keep moving. Although he had no particular destination in mind, his feet began to carry him back to Baker Street. It would be a fair walk to get back, and he knew it would do him good to use that time to get himself under control. Maybe he’d even stop by Tesco to restock their pitiful cupboards. He wasn’t putting off his arrival at the flat, of course. Just being practical.
John searched every room in the flat for Sherlock but he already knew he wouldn’t find him. Flying down the stairs, he saw that Mrs. Hudson’s door was ajar. How had he missed that on the way in? How had he not noticed? Pushing the door open, John found Mrs. Hudson sprawled awkwardly in the middle of her sitting room. Rushing to her side, he found her barely conscious, but with a strong pulse and no signs of obvious injury. As he knelt beside her and tried to rouse her, she turned to John and began to sit up.
[I’ve never done that with anyone. –SH]
, but have you ever thought about being with anyone? Like that?” John asked, knowing that he wasn’t exactly being clear but also knowing that Sherlock would catch his meaning.
He let his head fall back to rest on the couch, his face pointed towards the ceiling. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply, deciding not to give one single shit. “I’m lonely, I guess.”
.” John pursed his lips and blew out a sharp breath through his nose.
, right?”
“We don’t have a strimmer.”
like you. Someone is clearly trying to intimidate you at the very least. This might as well be a death threat in neon lights for all its subtlety.”
A few hours later, Sherlock strode into the kitchen wearing naught but a dressing gown.
“I don’t really know, dear. I heard quite a scuffle coming from upstairs, and after the row you and Sherlock had earlier, I thought maybe he was having some sort of tantrum, you know how he gets.” John nodded sympathetically and gestured for her to continue. “Well I opened my door and saw two men dragging Sherlock down the stairs. I must have called out or screamed or something, because one of the men shoved me back into my flat, where I fell. I must’ve hit my head because everything’s a bit fuzzy until you found me.”
Sherlock swallowed. “No, no boyfriend.”
“Your assumption that my strategy would result in my death isn’t exactly a vote of confidence, John. You know I can solve this case more quickly by accepting a modicum of risk. Considering my track record of not yet having died, I think the odds are looking fairly good for me, are they not?
[23:00 and messaging me out of the blue about a man we’ve had no news of for weeks? It seems congratulations are in order. -MH]
“John,” he blurted out, more force behind the name than he intended. John stopped where he stood and turned to face the detective. Sherlock cleared his throat. "John,” he continued, infusing calm into his words, “I don’t mean to…to offend. My personality, my manner…it’s how I’ve always been, but it’s also something I’ve honed for The Work. You know that The Work has always come first.”
Sherlock seemed to go offline for a long moment. John waited patiently but soon became concerned when Sherlock remained unmoving and unblinking. He reached out and touched the detective’s hand. “Sherlock?”
John forgot how to breathe after hearing Sherlock’s words. It felt as though his heart were breaking all over again. The desperation he felt to find Sherlock somehow intensified. John continued watching Sherlock, his eyes burning with unshed tears. When he saw Sherlock’s legs give out and heard the cry that tore from his friend’s throat, John’s grief instantly solidified to a white-hot rage. He grabbed a paperweight from Lestrade’s desk and threw it as hard as he could. The glass between the office and the bullpen shattered and the officers nearby all stopped in their tracks to look at John.
Sherlock finally relented and John tore the item free from its wrappings with zero grace. Sherlock feigned offense. In the paper, John discovered a box containing a memory stick. John cocked his head in confusion and glanced over at Sherlock.
John simply inhaled deeply and nodded, clearly beyond words. He turned from Mycroft and ascended the stairs to check in with Lestrade.
[And this whole boyfriend business? Still interested?]
Sherlock lowered his voice in both volume and register. “Not half so ridiculous as someone whose emotions actually managed to give him a limp arguing that I should open myself up to those emotions.”
Sherlock made sure to put on his most neutral expression, forcing his voice to remain even. “If you already know it’s not my area, why do you ask?”
“When you first told me about the camera, I was furious. Embarrassed. Mortified, really. I don’t get embarrassed, John.” John’s mouth quirked into a lopsided grin but he said nothing. Sherlock continued, “But even so, I don’t think I’d take back what I said. It was…a relief, of sorts. To say it. I knew I’d never actually tell you any of those things, not really.”
“That’s—Sherlock—that’s not what I’m talking about.” John paused, trying with all his might to contain his annoyance. “There’s a dead man here who looks
John blanched and looked around in a panic.
Sherlock let out a shaky breath and wondered what John was doing at that very moment. Certainly he would know that Sherlock was in trouble by now, although the question of how long he had been in this room was still unanswered. He wondered if John, and undoubtedly Mycroft and Lestrade, had deduced the events of the afternoon based on the carnage left at the flat. What did they know? What evidence had Moriarty left, if any? Was there a trail of breadcrumbs for them to follow?
“Oh, John.” Again the condescension. “Don’t mistake my distaste for ignorance. I don’t avoid sentiment because it confounds or frightens me – it
Name your terms. I want him back.
Sherlock knew he was using this information to distract himself from the important things. He was bound with thick shackles fastening his wrists and ankles behind his back and attached to the floor. The length and arrangement of the chain was such that he was forced to kneel on the floor. His arms were drawn back taut, his shoulders under strain no matter how he tried to settle himself. He was naked except for his pants. He had no mobile. And there was a large drain in the centre of the floor.
[Some things are very difficult to say out loud but still need to be said. I’m improvising. –SH]
“Sherlock, there is absolutely no way that you still don’t know Lestrade’s first name.”
trying, John.”
John, afraid that he would scare Sherlock by either reciprocating or not reciprocating, was frozen in place. He had no interest in lying to himself about whether he wanted this, and his long-dormant
“Stop pretending that the emotional distance you keep between yourself and everyone else is some stroke of genius, and that everyone else suffers from either some sort of repulsive moral failing or a pitiful disability,” he fumed.
Although Sherlock was obviously trying to keep control of himself at first, the beating began to take its toll, and John watched Sherlock begin to crack. Sherlock’s closemouthed hums and groans broke free. John’s face contorted as he listened to Sherlock cry out in obvious agony. As the flogging continued, he saw stripes and welts appear on Sherlock’s back, some bleeding. Sherlock began to emit little choking sobs between strikes. His legs threatened to give out, wrenching his arms painfully and making him straighten and groan.
question apparently answered. Remembering the leftover curry in the fridge, John fixed himself a plate and went about the rest of his evening as usual. And so it went for the next several days, all business as usual, no drunken revelations or hangovers needing tending.
? Thirty-six hours in this room and
Sherlock shot him a look devoid of humour. “The selection of locations for the bodies,” Sherlock continued, “could be said to have a certain absurdity about them. They’re practically whimsical.”
John forced himself to take a deep breath and return to Sherlock’s side, where he found the man in question staring directly into the face of his doppelganger. Just as John opened his mouth to ask what Sherlock had deduced so far, Sherlock stood fully upright and turned to John. “I should like your expert medical opinion on this one, John,” he stated, the joy in his voice more subdued now but not entirely gone. John balked at the request for a moment, knowing full well that Sherlock would have already discovered anything John was likely to find out, but he very much wanted this case solved as soon as possible, so he leaned in for himself.
“Are you…is this okay?” John realised that he, too, was out of breath. Sherlock leaned forward and responded by tackling John to the ground and kissing him senseless. He palmed John’s throbbing erection through his trousers and finally broke the kiss.
John felt a sudden wave of nervousness. “What if you don’t like it?”
“You’ll tell me if I—“
John awoke hours later to harsh sunlight and a pounding headache. Grunting, he sat up far too quickly, then rubbed his temples to try to ease the throbbing there. When his eyes fell on the table in front of him, he noticed a glass of water and paracetamol next to his phone, which had miraculously been plugged in to charge. A blanket he didn’t remember grabbing last night was pooled around his waist. Realising that Sherlock must have, for lack of a better term, tucked him in last night, John shrugged and said, to no one in particular, “huh.”
An hour later, the pair found themselves back in a cab and headed out for dinner. Sherlock pretended to be annoyed that the Yard had called him all the way out to a scene for a case that he solved within minutes, but John knew he was secretly pleased. John rested his hand, palm down, on the seat between them, giving Sherlock the option of taking it or not. At first, John assumed Sherlock wasn’t interested, but after a moment, he felt the barest of touches. Glancing down, he saw Sherlock’s little finger ghosting along John’s while Sherlock’s expressionless face pointed straight ahead. John knew he shouldn’t be thrilled at such a minute gesture, but his heart leapt regardless.
“Sherlock, let’s get you in the ambulance. You’re for hospital.”
He moved to Sherlock’s back and removed the fastenings binding Sherlock’s wrists and ankles to each other and to the floor. Once released, Sherlock intended to stretch out his abused limbs and give his body some reprieve, but he found himself awkwardly falling to the floor instead, his muscles failing. A pained groan left his throat. Moriarty’s expression shifted subtly from intense interest to titillation bordering on arousal.
His dulled mind and the constant thrum of anguish throughout his body allowed him only the simplest of reveries before he either began to fade from consciousness or was seized by shooting pain, effectively curbing his thoughts over and over again. After an indeterminate amount of time, Moriarty and Ex-Military were back. Sherlock did his best to steel himself, although he feared that he had neither the fortitude nor mental capacity to do a good job of it.
"Why didn't you tell me about the play? She said most of the parts were gone already. Does it bother you?" John asked, turning his head to look at Sherlock, who shrugged and sighed again.
"We're going to go get your bag, obviously. Don't really know why you didn't bring it with you." He opened the door, and John realised he hadn't actually taken off his jacket yet. No need apparently.
Sherlock basically peeled John from his clothes, pushed him onto the bed and got on top of him, running his hands all over John’s torso and arms. He only had to brush his thumbs over John’s lower stomach to get him to harden, smirking to himself as he fixed his gaze on John’s groin.
The Nutcracker is a go, and Sherlock both loves and dreads it.
“There’s nothing material that you could give me that would be better than having you by my side.”
When the case was finally solved, they ate homemade pizza with Mrs Hudson and then settled to the living room, Sherlock on his chair and John sprawled on the sofa. After a few moments Sherlock got up and fetched an envelope from the desk, tossing it onto John’s chest before disappearing into the bathroom.
"Yeah. It was Afghanistan by the way, amazing that you can do that." John extended his hand and the detective quickly reached to shake it. To his astonishment, Sherlock noticed his hand was shaking slightly. He thought about pulling his hand back before John could notice, but then his hand was touching John’s warm and calloused hand and he almost didn’t want to ever let go, emotions be damned.
The detective sipped, for once agreeing to eating something, and took a second to taste the flavour. "Another red wine, French. Some kind of blend, mostly Merlot."
His thoughts were interrupted when the candies burst through the curtain, whispering and tossing ballet slippers off their feet. Sherlock was apparently a bit sulky since his last part had ended and there were still a few scenes to come. But at least he could come to where John was listening to the music and following the proceedings. The dancer just walked up to him and hugged him, sighing deeply and relaxing when John wrapped his arms around him in return.
"Oh, Sherlock. I know things have been quiet but we've been busy, you’ve been busy and I understand. Last year was last year, we’re here now and though we’ve been a bit distant lately and you’ve got a bloody cast on your arm, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else right now. Not even back to last year. Every Christmas is the best Christmas with you.”
He spotted Sherlock at one table, making his way there. Sherlock already had two cups in front of him, and as soon as John had sat down, one of the baristas brought a generous slice of chocolate cake to the table. John grinned at the cake which had holly decorations on it as well.
John lifted his eyes from the laptop screen, his eyes a little misty. “You sound like a sodden, mushy genius in love,” he managed to say, taking Sherlock’s hand in his and squeezing it. Then he added, with a big grin: “Now publish it quickly before you change your mind.”
Held on as tightly as you held
Years flew by and John found himself first in med school, then graduating and packing his pack for the army. Now he sometimes thought winters were easier, maybe it was just him growing up.
"Oh God, yes." Sherlock got up and pecked John on the lips as soon as he got close enough.
nicotine patches?" John congratulated himself on his brilliant icebreaker as the brunette tipped his head back slightly more and opened his eyes.
"Honey, if you don't want me to touch your index, you'll come and help me right now," John called out, peeking his head out of the bathroom.
"Well, I can't claim myself to be a professional Thai masseuse, but I know the basics," Sherlock muttered, clearly unhappy about having to admit he was an amateur. John grinned and looked at the card again, sipping on his coffee. "Mmm, alright then. When will this relaxation occur?"
Quizzing turned into a tickling match which then turned into snogging. Sherlock still tried to ask about chemical reactions in between kisses, and John giggled and answered every single one wrong until Sherlock gave up. In the end, they cuddled up on the sofa and watched the telly until John yawned and suggested they went to bed, where Sherlock still ran his tongue over John’s ear and neck, tickling him until they both fell asleep.
Sherlock was just about to consider the fear of accidentally driving John closer when he heard steps on the stairs. He quickly went to the window, and when the door swung open, he turned to face Lestrade.
By the time they got back to Baker Street, John was clearly ready to blow his top, and Sherlock was growing increasingly resentful that John had escorted him home like a wayward child. John said nothing until they entered the flat and the door shut firmly behind them.
Without a moment’s pause, Ex-Military (Sebastian, apparently) grabbed Sherlock’s left arm and pulled, an audible pop echoing in the room. Sherlock’s vision whited out at the pain, but it quickly faded to a dull ache. His entire body was still in agony, but that small bit of relief was intoxicating. The effect was short-lived, as Moriarty clapped his hands together once and grinned. “Wonderful! Now we can get back to it.”
John froze once again, his hand already on the doorknob. He took a steadying breath, waiting for something but unsure what exactly he was waiting for. When Sherlock neither moved nor spoke, John muttered, “fine.” Another pause. “Fine.” He exited the flat without another word and escaped to the street below. He impatiently wiped the tears from his face and told himself it was the cool air making his eyes water.
“And by ‘work’ you mean ‘murders’,” John offered.
Sherlock swallowed but kept his eyes closed, and John gently guided Sherlock’s head back to facing forward. John knew that the hair-washing bit was well and truly finished, but he couldn’t bring himself to end it. The intimacy was intoxicating. After another few moments of silence, he felt Sherlock trembling almost imperceptibly. The water was quite warm so John guessed it wasn’t from a chill. When Sherlock spoke, his voice came out in a hoarse murmur.
“I said ‘don’t,’ John.” Sherlock opened his eyes and peered at John, but otherwise didn’t move.
The problem of the lividity and rigor mortis was interesting but without more information about where the man had been killed and the conditions in which the body was kept before being brought to the church, it would be hard to puzzle out the exact timeline of events. Sherlock, annoyed at the lack of answers but still intrigued – perhaps more so – decided to spend some time in his mind palace organising the information about the case so far. He and John returned to Baker Street where Sherlock took up residence on the couch, lying down with his eyes closed, his hands pressed together under his chin as if in prayer. That particular position had never bothered John before, but after the events of the evening, the image was a bit too funerary for John’s liking. He decided to get some rest while he still could, and trudged up to bed.
Sherlock was fairly certain he had been in the room for many hours, although a lack of data was hampering that deduction. The position in which he was chained was initially only uncomfortable but was now causing his shoulders and knees to throb and his muscles to seize, with any movement sending shooting pain through his limbs. He had spent most of his time in captivity in his mind palace, but the pain was starting to make it challenging for him to retreat there fully. Without the stimulation of new information or the meditative focus of his mind palace, Sherlock began to wish for something more chemical to help him quiet the flutterings of panic that were seeping into his mind.
John had Sherlock face the spray, as his back was still not ready for the pressure of the water. Sherlock was positioned so that the water fell on his chest, and he needed to lean forward only slightly to get his head wet. Once the water was warm enough, John had Sherlock wet his hair, then stood behind him and went about working in Sherlock’s poncy shampoo. It was a delicate balance, trying to be gentle and soothing with his motions while also keeping things professional and pragmatic. Sherlock really did need his hair washed, and John wasn’t going to use this as an opportunity to come onto him. He didn’t even know if that sort of thing was in the cards for them at all. For now, the least he could do was help his friend.
“Oh.” Sherlock sat there looking gutted. “Audio?”
[Really, John. –MH]
When they arrived at the crime scene, Sherlock gave John’s hand a squeeze before they parted and exited the cab. John smiled to himself, wondering how Sherlock could claim to be uninterested in or incapable of romance. That simple gesture said so much.
Sherlock returned only a few minutes later, bearing a frankly disturbing amount of Italian food. “Angelo sends his fondest regards,” Sherlock called to John as he gathered plates from the kitchen. Sherlock seemed out of breath, almost as if he had jogged back from the restaurant. For a moment, John forgot to respond to Sherlock, too taken aback by the fact that Sherlock had gone out for takeaway, rather than having John do it, or having it delivered, or – most likely of all – ignoring the existence of food altogether.
Sherlock groaned and shook the dirt from his coat as he sat up. John’s rugby tackle was well warranted in this case, but Sherlock knew he’d be feeling it in the morning. “Well done, John, I knew you’d—“ Sherlock’s words died in his throat when he looked over and saw John’s face contorted in pain. Despite knowing that the bullet had gone wide and that John most certainly wasn’t shot, the colour drained from Sherlock’s face as his eyes darted over John’s body, trying desperately to determine what went wrong.
“Yes, I do.” Sherlock paused for a long moment, but John sensed it wasn’t for dramatic effect. “Why are you all of a sudden trying to make me into someone else? I’ve
Fortunately, he supposed, Ex-Military seemed well-versed in how to perform this particular type of torture without actually killing him, but his brain and his body were telling him that he was dying, he was dying right this minute, and he needed to get away. Every nerve in his body, every cell was alight with terror.
“Your body has grown noticeably tenser over the last few minutes. Your jaw is clenched. You’re squeezing my foot enough for it to be uncomfortable. I’d deduce something but I seem to be less capable of gathering data than usual. Hence the question.”
Of course, trying not to think of something – or someone – is the quickest way to have that be the only thing on your mind. When he realised that it would be impossible to ignore the direction his thoughts were taking him, Sherlock allowed it to happen. He took short trips to his mind palace, to the room where he kept John. A large filing cabinet for all of the times that John had surprised him. A thick file on John’s moral character. Shelves and boxes and drawers and pictures, ordered and re-ordered over time, the room kept tidy but clearly well-used.
Sherlock grinned, enjoying a dramatic moment. “Why, play his game right back, of course.”
[I can’t risk yours or Sherlock’s safety out of some sense of propriety. You’ll have to bear it at least until Moriarty is taken care of. –MH]
John embraced Mrs. Hudson, thankful that she hadn’t been hurt worse. “Mrs. Hudson, what did these men look like? Did you see their faces?”
John found the consulting detective sitting on the ground just outside the main building. He was covered in a blanket, berating the EMTs. John’s face broke into a grin as he couldn’t stop himself from running over to Sherlock. When Sherlock caught sight of his friend, Sherlock’s eyes shone like stars. He didn’t smile, exactly, but his body sagged with apparent relief.
When Sherlock regained consciousness the first time, the only thing he could sense was total disorientation. He didn’t know where he was, or even where his body was in space. He couldn’t be sure if he were still moving or not. His brain was malfunctioning somehow, the furious cascade of information suddenly turned to treacle. He hardly had enough time to panic about this realisation before he slipped into darkness again.
“Ah, so you
John rubbed his closed eyes with his fingers and thumb. He knew it sounded childish, but he asked, “What should I do, then? What do I
John continued to stare at the screen, eventually allowing his mind to begin to process things. Sherlock was being tortured. Right now. He was somewhere, probably not very far from where John was, and he was in total agony. He couldn’t move, he was soaked in his own piss, bleeding through open wounds on his back, and left alone. John’s heart hurt so much for Sherlock that it was a real, physical sensation. He was somewhat relieved to realise that Moriarty wasn’t just going to kill Sherlock as he apparently did with the doppelgangers in the church and the brothel. That relief, however, led immediately to dread – Moriarty clearly had plans for Sherlock, and they would be far from pleasant.
[Even for you]
Lestrade narrowed his eyes. “When you say ‘play his game’, what exactly are you suggesting?”
“Good?”
The rage in Moriarty’s eyes was snuffed out in an instant, his face returning to the cool amusement he so often effected. “Poor Sherlock, we really must’ve scrambled you. It’s a shame, you’re normally almost as smart as I am.” He nodded to Sebastian, who returned to Sherlock’s side, cattle prod in hand.
Sherlock sat there and scowled for a moment. John looked at him, attempting to remain neutral. When it became clear that Sherlock wasn’t going to continue the conversation, John got up to make some tea. Returning a few minutes later, he placed Sherlock’s cup in the consulting detective’s hands, then sat down with his own. He allowed the silence to stretch between them, sensing that Sherlock had things he needed to say. He could wait.
John tried not to feel overwhelmed as he was permitted to see and touch every part of Sherlock. He ran his hands from Sherlock’s calves up to his thighs, John’s thumbs caressing Sherlock’s inguinal creases and making the detective shudder. Sherlock’s hands fisted in the bedsheets. John continued his journey, tracing Sherlock’s sides and dancing the pads of his thumbs across Sherlock’s nipples. A sharp intake of breath told John he would be revisiting there soon enough. As he leaned forward over Sherlock, their cocks aligned and pressed together, pulling a groan from both men. Reaching for the lube and uncapping it, he hazarded a glance at Sherlock.
“Hats?”
With a sigh, John returned to the couch and sat next to Sherlock, mirroring his friend’s position. Forcing a smile on his face, John decided to go for humor to break up the black mood they’d created for themselves. “Well, it’s not all bad, I suppose,” he offered. “With both of us being so shit at relationships, at least we have each other to annoy endlessly.”
Sherlock was only awake and aware for some of what followed. There was an explosion of pain in his left hand, maybe struck with a hammer or repeatedly crushed under a boot. He was given water to drink. A few bites of something sweet, chewed and swallowed on autopilot. More pain, his feet this time. Water on his face, not like before. Probably tears.
[Yes. –SH]
“This is it, John. This is the case I’ve been waiting for.”
Sherlock was at a loss. John seemed to need comfort or reassurance or some sort of emotional support, but that wasn’t really what Sherlock excelled at. He hoped that levity would at least help. “There are well over eight million people in London. If half of them are women, and half of those women are of an age appropriate for a relationship with you, that’s still two million people. Even if you went on three dates a day, it would still take you almost two thousand years to get through every woman.”
at Sherlock. It was anger that came from betrayal and grief and, if he could be truly honest with himself, heartbreak, but anger nonetheless.
Sherlock shook his head minutely but said nothing.
John felt as though he might swoon like a proper Victorian lady. Sherlock’s voice had always been sinfully alluring, but suddenly having that voice directed wholly at him in this way was enough to make John’s trousers feel entirely too snug. After collecting himself and helping Sherlock get the jumper the rest of the way off, John simply said, “My turn.”
Sherlock hummed in response, then grabbed his mobile from where it had fallen on the floor earlier. He sat in his chair and typed for a moment, then John’s device beeped. John looked down.
Sherlock placed his hands over John’s and whispered, “Wait.” John immediately removed his hands, assuming that Sherlock wanted to take things slow. That would be okay. John could wait. Then Sherlock tucked his own fingers under the hem of John’s jumper and began to lift it off him. “The number of times I’ve thought about getting you out of these awful things…” Sherlock allowed the sentence to trail off, leaving both him and John snickering.
John discovered he was crying when he finally blinked. He immediately grabbed his mobile and phoned Mycroft, his eyes on Moriarty.
Ex-Military grabbed Sherlock’s hands and used rough cord to bind them together once again, then attached the cord to an anchor point more than two metres up the wall. Sherlock’s shoulders screamed at the stretch after having been in his previous position for so long, but at least he was standing this time. Sherlock could no longer see Moriarty or Ex-Military, but he heard movement and some shuffling, probably Ex-Military getting implements. Sherlock tried not to tense his muscles in anticipation of whatever was coming, but he was still having trouble controlling his body. Ex-Military stepped behind Sherlock and asked, his voice deathly even:
John normally avoided this kind of thing. Heartfelt conversations, emotional vulnerability, especially with Sherlock. He knew that Sherlock saw emotions as a weakness so he didn’t like to reveal his inner turmoil, both because he didn’t want to prove Sherlock right and because he didn’t want Sherlock to see him as weak. It was foolish and vain, but John never claimed to be otherwise.
Feeling uncharacteristically shy, John offered to help Sherlock take a shower, but Sherlock instead requested a wet flannel and some privacy. John nodded and left Sherlock to it. For a few days, John and Sherlock fell into a routine of pain medication, dressing changes, arguments over meals, and long naps. Sherlock slept more than half of each day, never got out of his pyjamas, and said little. At first, John chalked it up to the pain and the medication, the fatigue of healing, and the exhaustion of the entire ordeal. After nearly a week, however, John began to worry. As they sat across from one another in their usual chairs, John glanced over at his flatmate.
“I know…” John tried to be careful with his words. “I know you never meant for me to hear what you said. It should’ve been your choice. I’m sorry Moriarty took that away from you.”
John looked over at Sherlock, but Sherlock’s eyes were closed and an arm was delicately draped across his face. John closed his eyes for a moment and took a steadying breath. “Sherlock,” he began, “I am both infuriated at your characterisation of the women I’ve dated and…flattered? I think? That you think anyone isn’t good enough for me. We’ll call it a draw. I’m too tired to have a row with you, and this sofa is comfortable.”
Apparently it didn’t matter anyway. Sherlock let himself believe that he and John were together in every way that mattered, and that they would continue in this fashion until violence or old age did away with them. But John had managed to end that fantasy with three simple words – “It’s not enough.” – and now Sherlock was forced to come to terms with reality. He was preparing to enter a thoroughly self-indulgent sulk when John stirred a bit and spoke again.
the case, Sherlock? All you’ve said so far is that Greg found a body.”
“To the world’s only consulting detective, who managed to solve the case without berating the client,” John offered. Sherlock’s face twitched with the suggestion of an eye roll, but the pair clinked glasses and drank.
Sherlock tried to stay calm. He really did. But when the first stream of water poured over the cloth covering his nose and mouth, Sherlock’s amygdala took over. He thrashed about violently despite his restraints. When he wasn’t choking or coughing, he was screaming. He knew what was happening, objectively, but it didn’t seem to matter. His body wasn’t listening to him.
“Finally, that must be it,” John spoke at the same time, lifting his eyes to Sherlock. “Oh, sorry. What is it?”
“Of course you don’t have to, I just thought… You mentioned you weren’t progressing a few weeks ago, and I – well, I thought it could, um, help, maybe,” he mumbled, feeling hot and red already.
"Hello, I'm John Watson. So you live here? Sherlock told me he's looking for a flatmate."
John nodded and squeezed his hand briefly before turning to one of the dogs that was eagerly begging for John’s attention. “I wouldn’t have thought you to be a dog person, but it makes perfect sense,” he said, smiling up at Sherlock while petting the dog.
~’*’~
Soon he found himself laying on the couch, shirt off and pants pulled to his thighs, Sherlock's head bobbing up and down on his prick, and the detective thrusting two fingers in and out of him.
He also tried to come watch his lessons every week. It was lovely to see Sherlock get better every time, even though he had no idea how it happened since everything looked like the same sort of brilliant to him. John quickly learned that Mrs. Hudson wasn’t one to give compliments in class easily, but she did like to chat with John before and after Sherlock’s lessons, always praising Sherlock’s diligence. John smiled at Sherlock’s direction fondly, and always agreed with her.
That day’s card said ‘Christmas-scented bath’ and John was again baffled by how Sherlock had known John would be in need of a relaxing bath on just that day.
“You were holding your phone when you stood up and laid it on the table, screen facing down. That was probably just coincidence, you surely have nothing to hide. But it gave me a chance to see the engraving: ‘
John nodded gratefully, sipping on the coffee. “Wow, this is some sort of Christmas coffee too, isn’t it?” he asked, glancing at the chalkboard above the counter. “Cardamom, clove, orange and vanilla,” Sherlock reiterated, nodding. “I thought it would be appropriate.”
It was almost fun to watch Sherlock realise he had been so obvious with his pain that John had noticed. He immediately stretched his legs and gave a seemingly nonchalant do-what-you-want-I-don’t-care hum. John just smiled and went to the kitchen to get some water. He paused to take a look at the damage done to his dinner plans and decided to pop into the store just in case he could still find something. As he gave Sherlock the glass and the pill, he told the detective to not to try anything. Not that the cast would allow him much – he couldn’t even move his fingers – but John wouldn’t put it past Sherlock to find a way to make it worse if the mood stuck him.
"You know I'm seconds away from kissing you so hard you'll have bruises on your lips?" Sherlock growled into John's ear, making the shorter man's knees weak.
Sherlock gets an unexpected oppoturnity, and John's with him all the way.
But Sherlock looked determined and reached for John's trousers, sliding the button free. "You should probably guide me through, fiancé."
And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust
He heard John's awkward chuckle. Still, he didn't dare say anything, he didn't want to accidentally drive John away. It was disturbing how he was already so scared of losing this man.
The main thing now was John. He seemed simple and ordinary but as it turned out, he had a completely different side to him too. A dangerous side, though Sherlock couldn’t feel anything but intrigued by him.
Omg I'm so close to catching up on these :D I wish I could've stayed on "schedule" but oh well I actually have a holiday to have
After cleaning a good portion of his plate, John felt he was focused enough to have a bit of conversation. "So, what do you do when you're not... working?"
He wasn't sure if he wanted to go to Baker Street now though. Sherlock probably hadn't thought about anything when he dashed off, but John couldn't help feeling a bit hurt. The brunette had practically abandoned him here and John was sure he was going somewhere else than Baker Street.
~’*’~
~'*'~
"Jo-ohn!" Sherlock moaned brokenly. He was laying on the desk, his lower back hanging on the air, only holding up by sqeezing his legs around John's waist.
Sherlock chuckled, starting to put his skates on. John followed suit, and soon they both had laced up their skates. Sherlock grinned and gave John a pair of warm, knitted gloves, a knitted beanie and a helmet. John scowled at the helmet, but pulled it on as Sherlock showed that he had one too.
The candle was really doing things to John.
That was why, when Sherlock came back from Scotland Yard one especially freezing day, he found John decorating a real pine tree which he had somehow managed squeeze to the corner of the living room. He had actually asked Lestrade to give Sherlock something to do while he got all the supplies.
After he’d gotten out of the tub and dried himself, John pulled on a pair of boxers and his pyjamas. As he stepped to the hallway, he noticed that all the lights were off. Frowning, he made his way to the kitchen, stopping on his tracks under the doorway again as he saw the room. The lights were off, but the table was lit up by a gorgeous candle piece and the few extra candles that were scattered in between the dishes that were the source of the delicious smell John noticed only now.
(See the end of the chapter for
John nodded, trying to stretch his legs too. “Why stop? You seem pretty good at it, and well, your personality clearly is made for a demanding sport like this…”
And being the bastard he was deep down, Aziraphale leaned his head back, picked up the wine glass he had freshly refilled, and let out a small contented moan as Crowley started licking. Crowley couldn't even watch his face lest he blush furiously, all the hedonism ramping wild in his field of vision being too much to handle. A very happy angel, having his cock sucked while he enjoyed a good glass of wine. Yep, way too much.
Just as he turned the key of 221, Sherlock's brain suddenly came online and he realised where he was.
~’*’~
Sherlock? That he was dating his
But someone who had actually studied and taught ballet and knew about arts… He could ruin this in so many ways. So, he spent all his free time dancing and stretching as much as he could. Even before going to sleep he would practice his balance, watching his face in the bathroom mirror.
Sherlock then proceeded to tug John to sit on his lap. John complied happily. Then he took hold of Sherlock's face and led him to a more heated kiss. He took a good moment to explore the insides of Sherlock’s mouth, and pulled back when he really needed to catch his breath.
This seemed to catch Sherlock slightly by surprise. The brunette raised his eyebrows and then frowned somewhat, his nose crinkling in a way John noticed he really liked.
“I’m in the background, I can’t shine too much,” Sherlock mumbled back, zipping up his bag. “I’d distract the leads,” he added, sounding happier and lighter than before the practice. Then he twisted his head to look at John. “Now get off me so I can pull my sweats on, I want to get home sooner than later.”
A quick glance to the reason of his faux pas only made him more annoyed. Short, blonde and probably dull as a brick. A doctor, clearly someone good and proper like every idiot here. He could see the man starting to apologise but he looked strangely flustered. So he had to be quite embarrassed too, not that it mattered to Sherlock anyway.
HA guess who miscounted and then needed to fit all three days into this chapter.

Ever the steady doctor, John just calmly closed the front door after himself and went to hail the cab they were going to take anyways. Of course, instead of the murder scene they were heading to the hospital. John expected Sherlock to argue and say he was fine enough to solve the case, but the detective merely muttered unhappily. That alone told John how much the wrist had to hurt. The fact that by the end of the cab ride Sherlock’s talking had been reduced to mere grunts, cradling the damaged wrist protectively on his chest, was a dead giveaway that the detective was in pain.
"You seriously think so?" His voice sounded unexpectedly small and a tiny flutter of irritation at the lack of control crossed his mind. Even if this man was his soulmate it was no reason to start with
Sherlock quickly pecked Mrs. Hudson's cheek on the way out. "Yes, yes, I know that. Tea would be nice when we get back."
Sherlock scoffed, blushing a bit more. “Of course I made one. You’d complain about having to eat chocolate every day even though you like chocolate ridiculously much – stupid doctor habits – and the ones with the pictures are just boring.”
"Think about it, you could easily miss –" Sherlock started, but something caught his eye and he turned to look out of the window before letting out a satisfied chuckle. "There he is."
The detective moans and snaps the laptop shut, standing up. Immediately, John pushes the chair back and comes to stand right behind him, sneaking his hands to Sherlock's front and undoing his trousers, sliding them down to mid-thigh.
“Right now we have a killer to catch. Or not maybe, they did kill a serial killer after all, it was bound to be someone’s job.” Now he was rambling, how nice. What kind of trash did the cabbie use on him? He shook his head as they entered the living room. The rug was gone and someone had scrubbed the blood off the floor and the wall. There was a hole from the bullet and Sherlock bent to have a look.
“Want another painkiller? Just one though.”
Sherlock gave him a long-suffering look. “It wouldn’t be listed as a surprise if I didn’t put any effort into it. So I’ll try to be as positive and helpful as I can,” he mumbled, rolling his eyes. “Unless your gift ideas are utterly idiotic, but I’m sure that won’t happen. You’re the expert on socialising after all.”
"Oh fuck, Sherlock. I'm not going to last, sorry baby," he babbled and squeezed his eyes shut. Sherlock reached to grip John's waist and swallowed the doctor down as far as he could, his nose brushing John pubic hair. He kept the doctor on the edge for almost a full minute, swallowing around him a few times and breathing through his nose carefully.
“Umm, just sit over there, your back against the headboard,” Sherlock said breathily, getting off of John’s lap and fetching the lube. “Could you..?”
“Oatmeal with apple jam was always my favourite breakfast choice when I was a kid,” Sherlock mumbled, shifting on his feet rather nervously. “I thought that we’d do things that I like today. Not just the work or cases, but other things as well. Of course you’ll get a day too, I’ll need you to make a list of what you’d like us to do and I’ll make it happen.”
"Umm, well you know I'm not really a cook, and I thought you could help with the turkey's seasoning." She clapped her hands merrily. "Oh wonderful, you got a turkey! I wasn't sure what you boys wanted and totally forgot the meat in the fuss."
"Then do it," he answered, pulling Sherlock closer, squeezing his arse cheekily. "Come here."
When he woke up, John managed to get him to stay on the sofa and watch Doctor Who. Otherwise the dancer might have paced around the whole day, tiring out his feet and both of their nerves, which wasn’t a good idea. At least now part of Sherlock’s focus was on the show, no matter how much he claimed he didn’t care about such things.
The next day, there was no mention of that day’s surprise until the very evening, when John and Sherlock were sitting on their armchairs and relaxing, with the fire cracking in the fireplace. Suddenly Sherlock broke the silence and stood up, holding his laptop open.
The initial lack of medical concern did make him feel a bit bad, but well, after the horrible moldy liver incident from the very same morning, John wasn’t sure if there was some sort of karma at work. It was the day before Christmas Eve and Sherlock had been actively sabotaging John’s attempts at making a Christmas dinner for them, running to a case when John tried to plan the cookings and spreading his experiments all over the kitchen. The latest episode with the liver had ruined the roast that John “had been bound to burn in the oven anyways” as Sherlock had stated. John knew the brunet wasn’t doing it on purpose, but he couldn’t help the sour mood that had somehow clouded 221b for a while now.
Next morning, John found an envelope on Sherlock’s pillow again. He grinned and opened it, finding the card and a folded sheet of paper inside. Frowning, John flipped the card, and read it. ‘A list of all the things I love about you’ it said, and John felt his heart throb. He almost read the paper then and there, but then he realised he had work to go to, and he reluctantly put the card back in the envelope and took it with him.
Sherlock hummed again. “You know how expensive ballet lessons, especially good, private ones are, John, and you also know my parents refused to support my free-time activities after that incident with cocaine. Not that they had been very fond of the idea of me 'in a tutu' to begin with.” John could tell Sherlock was unhappy about the situation, every time he managed to mention it, and it made the blond slightly more sure of his decision.
“Oh, we definitely will,” John chuckled, pausing outside the door to kiss him. “You’ll be brilliant, just like you were today,” he said, kissing him softly. Sherlock kissed back, pushing John against the wall lightly as people passed them by.
John took his spot in his easy chair and opened the Evening Standard. “I thought Lestrade…and everyone else….was content with the conclusions we came to on that.
Sherlock sat down heavily in a nearby chair. “Of course, he doesn’t have to tell me his every move,” he shouted, indignantly, “but he was Christmas tree shopping for us as well as Mrs. Hudson. That, and he had borrowed a friend’s truck who was expecting it back by now. And Rosie isn’t with John; she’s spending a few days with Molly.”
And Mycroft. He would still have been in his teens when it all took place and they secured her away. And what…maybe thirty years old when Rudy died? It was a huge burden to be sure, but he wouldn’t have
“Why would you want to sit in the
And I said why the hell not?
“Oh…god,” she exclaimed as she dropped back down onto the pillow. She glanced over at the clock on the night stand. “Ten-thirty! Shit! Oh wait….it’s Sunday. Oh…my head. Where am I?”
“Alright, I’ve steeled myself up with several cups of good, strong tea, though god knows I could have used a nip of something in it. Go on then...”
orchestrate anything that elaborate. Sure, he was smart enough in his own right, but not when it came to being any sort of a mastermind.
“What?”
“Really? You think she’ll like it?”
” Sherlock shot back incredulously.
“But we’re in
John turned around and started out towards the area of the cafeteria that housed the tray carts and trash bins. It was only a distance of about fifteen feet, but John thought it felt more like fifteen miles. He reached Sherlock just as he was placing his tray on the cart. John threw his napkin in the trash and gave a little cough. Sherlock turned sharply in his direction.
Eurus thought throughout all those years? Especially at first when she was still a child? Did she wonder what happened to us? Did she ask for her mum or dad at all? Or Sherlock? Did she know we
Sherlock sighed heavily into the phone.

“John…John,” his mother yelled while knocking on his bedroom door. “Your friends are waiting. Quit fussing over your clothes…I know that’s what you’re doing. I’m sure you look fine.”
Sherlock sat down heavily and dropped his head into his hands.
He took her into his arms and loved her. He soothed her and…he helped her land. He helped her land and she helped him save his friend.
“Mrs. H.? It’s John”
“Wait,” John startled, “how old are you now?”
Sherlock shook his head. “Cartoons. Not really my area. Mycroft and I played with matchbox cars, but my favorite play activity was pirates. And I’ve never watched much telly, save for documentaries or crime investigation type shows.”
We returned to our table. Stamford and his dancing partner were nowhere to be seen. I could only imagine. Sherlock…I guess I’ll refer to him as Sherlock now…ordered one last shot for the two of us. The bar would be closing soon and I stated that I didn’t know if I should wait for Mike to show up or just assume he had made “other arrangements” and trod my way back to my depressingly dingy flat. I lamented the fact that I seriously needed to find other lodgings when Sherlock startled a bit. I gave him a questioning look and he hemmed and hawed around some seconds before speaking.
“That’s ridiculous.” Sherlock scoffed.
As time went on, darkness consumed her. She was convinced she was unlovable, foul, and would never be fit for society. No one cared for this girl who had done unspeakable things, and no one was ever going to come and help her land. Her young psyche broke and bleed and bouts of insanity possessed her.
“Couldn’t sleep? Why not? Sherlock, are you ill, or is something…. Ohhh…I know.”
“If you’re…you’re sure you don’t mind.”
. I just can’t…see what it is. Yet. What is it you were asking me? Something about Mrs. Hudson?”
He had to return…he had to.
“Ah, old Benjie!” Lestrade smiled. I know the bloke well. Cheerful little man. And yes, I believe I know exactly where that tree farm of his is. Out on the old tannery road. Shall we check that out first?”
“I really hope this is…appropriate,” he stated and encircling John in his arms, he bent down and claimed his mouth.
“Mycroft.”

The two laughed and continued on their way.
And that was how, at the age of sixteen, the weight of the Holmes family’s wretched world, came to land on Mycroft’s shoulders. After Uncle Rudy died, he carried the cross the alone. He kept watch all these years on Sherlock, ever diligent in case some word, or action, or remnant out of his own memory palace might awaken the sleeping demon. It was what kept Mycroft himself from forming any close connections with anyone. Why “caring is not an advantage” became his mantra.

worried that Sherlock might fall back on the crack again if someone wasn’t around to keep an eye on him. That business with Molly had ripped the detective to his core. It was the first time he had ever seen Sherlock act out of pure rage and despair because
That’s not to say she wasn’t scared half to death; it all happened so fast. Just…
They did, and Molly ordered another rounds of shots. Yes, mild Molly Hooper had every intention of getting hammered tonight; she was already well on her way, and the hell with where that might take her.
Ryan and Meera barely suppressed giggles while the others either rolled their eyes or had incredulous looks on their faces…except for John, who looked slightly embarrassed.
“Could your brother help?”
“Nonsense! We’d be delighted. And after all, you were kind enough to provide it.”
“I do not.”
Sherlock walked to and then opened, the fridge. “How’s the milk situation? Oh…there’s about two pints. That should suffice for now I’d think.”
More snickers and Ryan opened his mouth, no doubt with a smart-ass reply, but Suzanne pounced on his foot.
“That’s right, you clever girl. Now, let’s go change your nappy before he gets here, shall we?”
When the clock struck midnight and the place exploded with everyone singing “Auld Lang Sine”, Mike and I realized we were the only two in the place not getting kissed or groped. Yeah, it was a little depressing. I knew I was facing a bleak, lonely night…hell…lonely

He had considerably less than two pounds left, not even enough for a cup of tea. He was too disheveled to cross the doorway of any café anyway. Right. To Mrs. Hudson’s it was then. At least he could shower, shave, and get something decent to eat. He had left a suitcase full of what clothes he had salvaged from the apartment at the hotel, too. And he might even have to take her up on the offer of a bed for a couple of hours. Or a couple of days.  He started walking in the direction of the Hyacinth Hotel when another thought crossed his mind. He took his phone out of his coat pocket, and put in the number of Molly Hooper.
“Why the hell is it so difficult to find a decent, bloody Christmas tree?” John Watson sputtered after he reached the confines of the truck, leaving yet another miffed owner without a tree from his lot. “That was the sixth place! I guess that’s what happens when you wait until practically the last minute; all the good ones are taken. I don’t need perfection, honestly, I don’t. I’d just like something without bloody gaping holes on every side! And you’re not helping,” he yelled at the radio, turning the switch and effectively cutting Bing Crosby off in the middle of “White Christmas”. In doing so he glanced at the clock.
that would be agreeable. Although… just how do you propose to get two Christmas trees back here to Baker Street from a tree lot? They wouldn’t fit in a cab and you can hardly handle both of them on the tube.”
And then the phone rang.

I went back to my flat. But, a wink is something I could not sleep even one of for the rest of what remained of the night. Many….disturbing…but delightful…visions were running through my head.

“Now then, Carson,” she started, “what brings you here? You don’t seem the type to frequent his sort of place…no offense. I’ll tell you something, I don’t come here much myself. Not anymore. My fiancé brought me here….EX fiancé, I should say.”
She had no desire to start over. They would have to make do with leftovers or something from a tin for dinner. She really didn’t feel like eating anyway. The potatoes went down the garbage disposal.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and gave an exaggerated “No”!
In reply, Sherlock ran his thumb along the back of John’s hand. He looked at him, deep into his eyes, and felt his face heating up again. But this time, it was for a very different reason.
And then she learned about all that her brother had gone through to save the man named John Watson. Dr. John Watson. Widowed with a tiny daughter and sinking into despair. Sherlock had been willing to place himself at death’s door to save his life. Would he come, after all this time, and….
“Of course. I’ve had a couple of PE classes with Ryan. And, as you said, I know Elizabeth from the classes the three of us have together…and Suzanne, in passing. But, do you always go out that way? I mean the two couples and you? Sort of makes you a fifth wheel, doesn’t it?”
“You with him…Carson?”
Finally… “Well, I suppose I had better be getting along to physics class. It was good to see you, John.”
“Sherlock,” Molly asked, “are you still there.”
! I didn’t need it shoved in my face.
And when it comes to the chaps I did meet in service….well, I’m not faring any better there either. Sholto’s gone off and hid somewhere. Bilby, Fletcher, and Nannan have returned to their wives and children. Carlson’s mind is shot and Tulliver’s lost both legs. As for Behr, Gloski, Kurtmann, and Van der Hoff…all dead. The war is what glued us together. And the war is…over, at least for the likes of us.
“I ah…I ah..” and he gave a quick jab with his thumb in the loving couple's direction.
out looking for a little love on this festive holiday night? But deep...somewhere inside, I knew that’s not what I
He lay there looking up at a pale moon shining down through the trees and realized that it had stopped snowing; one blessing anyway.
That damned old relic, Dr. Sampson, had even hinted about the possibility of electroshock or lobotomy.
with the bright green shutters
“What’s that?” Sherlock probed.
“Um, yes. Yes I am with him. Why?”
Martha Hudson smiled as she carried a tray laden with various goodies for “her boys” up the stairs at 221B. They were the sons she never had, Rosie the “granddaughter” she loved beyond measure. The holiday season always found her especially cheerful and she had put together an extra-special lunch for Sherlock and John: her famous chicken salad on homemade rolls, pear and mandarin compote, and freshly baked scones with a pot of lemon curd from her own recipe. She’d send John down to fetch the tea tray.
“Wow, Sherlock, so much for not showing affection in public.” John teased.
And he did.
John wrinkled his nose. “Yeahhh… That’s romantic. Asking for a first date over the trash bin!”
Watson threw his hands up in the air and turned away exasperated. “Did you even hear a
you can give me all the awful details.”
“Two tickets for Ninja Turtles, please,” John told the cashier. They joined the other couples who were busy buying sodas and popcorn.
“So am I,” was the answer. “And I would love to go out with you again. How do you feel about museums?” Sherlock asked, shoving another chip into his mouth. These are excellent chips, by the way.”
She wanted to give some snarky comeback as to why it was none of the strange woman’s business, but something in the lady’s face stopped her.
John chuckled under his breath, and leaning over, cupped a hand around Sherlock’s ear.
to stay in this man’s presence…for a while….for the night….for as long as I could. I don’t know. What the hell?
Sherlock slowly made his way into a sitting position. He was stiff with cold and his head was pounding. And that dream…. Thank god that’s what it was…that last bit had scared the living hell out of him. He raised his head to see who had awakened him, and saw that it was old Tommy Gilroy. Tommy had been working here with Big Ben most of his life, and now performed only light maintenance and janitorial work… at the age of eighty-three. All of the caretakers knew that Sherlock occasionally “visited”, and they respectfully left him be, but, as Tommy explained, some inspectors were due here in an hour and they might not be so gracious, nor exactly delighted, to find someone using the area as a makeshift hostel. Sherlock thanked the old man and shakily made his way to the street.
“Love doesn't come with an on-off switch. It's made of too many threads of memory and hope and heartache that weave themselves into the very core of who you are.”
Sherlock sighed, “Alright, Mrs. Hudson, I’ll let you get back to your…nightly administrations.”
! I mean, I don’t have any children of my own, but I think I would be quite put out if I was Mrs. Holmes. What a
“Perhaps, but would we really want him any other way? I mean it’s what makes him…well….Sherlock.”
Their landlady stood, gathered the dirty things onto a tray, and carried them to the sink. “You’re most welcome, boys. What would I do without you?”
Mrs. Hudson gave the maid a generous tip and turned back to her guests.
“So,” Elizabeth said, slapping Ryan on the shoulder, “the balcony or the back seats?”
From the time she had been placed in this facility as a young girl, she had fantasized about being reunited with Sherlock.
“You’re seventeen, it’s high time you did,” was the curt reply.
Kindly put the correct amount into can here on the desk.
All lives connected to 221B have been radically changed. Some hopes have been shattered. Some prayers have been answered. Some promises have been kept. Many secrets have been reveled. One thing is for certain, none of them will ever be quite the same. They have learned to look deep....to trust...to hate...to forgive...to love....  To feel and know what it's like to be human.
Forty-five minutes and two glasses of Chardonnay later, Molly decided to progress to shots. Jägermeister was her usual poison of choice, but tonight felt more like a whisky night. She had just set the shot glass down on the table when a voice asked, “Would you like another?”
“And for you my little angel,” she crooned, addressing Rosie, “a sugar biscuit.” And she handed the treat to the child.
Sherlock gave John a knowing grin and finished his tea in one gulp.
They were ready to make a little night music of their own.
John looked up. Sherlock was smiling.
“John….
Lestrade knocked back the rest of his scotch before answering. “I’m still not understanding; what exactly do you expect me to do?”
“I look out into the water and up deep into the stars. I beg the sparkling lanterns of light to cure me of myself — my past and the kaleidoscope of mistakes, failures and wrong turns that have stacked unbearable regret upon my shoulders.”
The woman laughed lightly. “No real reason. I ah, just wanted to say he’s a good man. I dated him years ago, but we just weren’t that compatible. Nothing wrong on his part. I’m just more of a party girl and well, he’s more the stay-at-home type. I was quite surprised to see him here, actually. That’s all just…he’s a nice human being. Good luck.”
“I would think most of the places selling trees would be closed now,” offered Mrs. Hudson.”
She had been quite upset with him. Keeping his sister alive all those years…alive and hidden away. And all those people that
Mycroft stopped speaking and was met with more silence.
Molly Hooper dropped the phone on the counter and ran for the bathroom. She fell down in front of the toilet and lost what little bit she had managed to eat for breakfast into the bowl. When her stomach was emptied, bile followed, and then came the dry heaves. Mercifully, they finally subsided, but not before causing her head to pound, her throat to burn, and her abdomen to spasm in pain.
“Mr. Holmes, what can I do for you?”
.” Meera pleaded. Most of the others nodded in agreement.
888888888888888888888888
“You don’t mind, do you?”
then questioned myself why I was thinking that!
Mrs. Hudson sighed into the phone. “Just….be safe, John. Rosie and I will be fine. And if Molly calls, I’ll tell her you were asking after her.”
“I don’t know. Probably not.”
December 23
It was cold up here. Or maybe it was just him. He sipped his coffee, ate the crisps, and as the beginnings of dawn appeared on the horizon, he witnessed parts of the city coming alive for the day. Not that it was ever silent. But, bit by bit, he saw lights and people emerging from once darkened corners.
I decided to leave Mike to his own devices,
“So,” Suzanne began, “who else
She took in the rest of him before answering. Fresh-pressed khakis, a button down about the same color as her dress, expensive looking black shoes. The overall look just didn’t quite cut it and she couldn’t help but feel that either he over thought the dressing process, or didn’t think about it at all. He looked decidedly out of place and it was pretty evident this wasn’t his usual milieu.
And so, John gave her a condensed version of all that had taken place beginning with the girl who came to 221B claiming to be Smith’s daughter and the fake therapist and how they had both been Sherlock’s forgotten sister, and into the events at Sherrinford.  But…not of his texting affair with the girl on the bus. That unsavory business would undoubtedly come out someday. The old dear had enough to digest at the moment. She was looking rather peaked as it was.
. And it’s now after nine.”
“It is what it is. Anyway, do you need to use the toilet before I get in the shower?”
Sherlock looked at John, somewhat bemused. “Should I? A superhero movie then?”
it’s possible he took advantage of the situation and did some shopping. But he didn’t notify Stamford and that’s what’s nagging me. That’s out of character for him to do something like
“Yes. And I propose we skip the shopping centres and lots and head right to the tree farms. And if he is not at one of those….”
Eurus Holmes sat cross-legged in the middle of the tiny room…cell really…staring straight ahead. This was the place the residents of Sherrinford were put when they couldn’t be trusted to stay in their own room.  And even though Eurus had been in a virtual catatonic state since returning to the facility after her absurd fiasco, no one could be certain that she would remain that way.
“Hello, Gregory, yes. Are you busy? I…I was wondering if you could do me a favor?”
“Goodbye, Mycroft.”
88888888888888888
He quickly replaced the jumper and headed towards the boxes in the back. One, bulging and held together with duct tape, proclaimed “Christmas lights and things” written in red marker across its top. He grabbed the box and headed downstairs.
He tried again and with the same result.
Thirty minutes later, with Rosie fast asleep in her borrowed crib, John and Mrs. Hudson returned to the living room and took up spots on the sofa.
“Pathetic,” Molly snorted. “You don’t even
“Well then,” Elizabeth said, giving John a friendly punch on the arm, “you’d better come up with a plan. Where’s he at anyway?”
So then, it came back to Eurus. Always Eurus. The thorn in his side from the day she was born. Even as an infant she had been spooky. She sat in her baby seat watching...just watching. You felt like she was trying to peer into your very soul. She never cried, not even when Sherlock accidentally split a mug of hot cocoa down her back when she was eight months old. She grimaced a bit and gave him the evil eye, but uttered not so much as a whimper. (Which one is pain?) All emotion appeared to be foreign to her. Well, maybe not all. She obviously relished others' agony.
“I believe we were summoned for ten am. What, you didn’t receive one of mummy’s invitations?”
88888888888888888
“There’s an ax in the basement,” Sherlock started. “Better make sure you put it in its case. Mrs. Hudson would know about the saw. I may be up late. You don’t mind do you?”
“Ah, no, Sherlock….it’s Molly. Actually, I was calling to see if John was there. I’ve been waiting for his call before I put Rosie down for the night. He’s usually done so by now. Sherlock…is something…wrong?”
Despite his earlier statement about not eating for a day or so, he barely touched his food once he got it, and continued to impress me with his colossal memory and amazing powers of deduction. Within fifteen minutes, he had analyzed everyone in the bloody place and set Mike to laughing so hard I was afraid he might stroke out on me. Holmes acted slightly wounded that Mike found his analyses amusing, but I could sense he was actually relishing being the center of attention.
wouldn’t do that to Rosie…or you.”
! And then Mycroft had burst into her flat to rescue her, pounds of debris rolling behind him. His pants were tattered, his back was slightly burned, and his hands were bleeding, but he had literally swooped her into his arms and carried her out the back. It had greatly changed her perception of him, she could tell you that.
Mrs. Hudson picked her up and kissed her cheeks.
“It’s…ah…John.”
hurt her. That Christmas night…when he’d said those terrible things and embarrassed the shit out of her…she’d thought that was the worse. But this… Yeah…..this. “It’s for a case,” he’d said. What case could possibly force him to do such a thing?
Thompson wasn’t impressed when she saw I hadn’t written a thing for three weeks, so I promised her I would do over Christmas. Well, here it is and I still don’t have a damn thing worth saying. As always, nothing important happened. I tried phoning Harry, twice, but as I expected, she didn’t answer. Never answered any of the texts I left, either. I didn’t really figure she would, so why did she send me that bloody phone as she obviously doesn’t care about staying in touch.
John wasn’t really a praying man, but at that moment he had sent out a plea….to whatever deity would listen…that Molly would have the good sense to realize something was terribly wrong and get herself and Rosie the hell out of the flat and to safety.
And, a whole lot of people were extremely angry with him at this moment. Not least of all his parents. Bloody hell. They would either get over it…or they wouldn’t. That was entirely out of his hands right now. He’d have a good long talk with them… eventually.
----------------------------------------------------------
“Oh and, ah. I…I think I’m going to go back…to Baker Street, I mean. It got beat up pretty bad in that blast, though not as bad as Mycroft predicted.  Mrs. H has promised to put all to rights and fix up a nursery for Rosie if I want. I think I may do…if Sherlock still wants me, that is. If not, I think I’ll still move. Too many memories in this flat.”
“Oh, god…Molly, I’m sorry. It’s just that…well, John isn’t answering, he hasn’t gotten in contact with any of us, and…quite honestly, I am getting a bit worried.”
Lestrade rang off and addressed his feline companion. “Sorry my little one, but it looks like daddy has to run out again.”
In her closet: clothes she never wore. Never wore them, because she never went anywhere that warranted wearing half of what she had. She loved girly things, things that sparkled or glittered. She bought them and then wished she hadn’t. They only reminded her of all the lives she wasn’t living. And there wasn’t much call for shiny things in the morgue.
“Yes…basically.”
Sherlock began:
And he’d just… hung up...he was just…gone. He’ll explain. Of course he will. But do I really want to know? Can I even face him again? He knew. He knew anyway. But was does it matter. The day I filled in for…John. He already knew.
Sherlock scoffed. “I’ve tried him. He thinks I’m overreacting…apparently. I don’t know, maybe I am. But…no, I’m not. He might leave
He was bent over a counter, squeezing something out of a syringe into a petri dish. He looked up at us when we walked in and…
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. “Sorry…guess I was hungry.”
“I wasn’t aware you two kept quite such close tabs on each other now that he has a child. Is it really necessary he report to you his whereabouts at all times? Perhaps he took his daughter out for the evening and things are just running later than he expected.”
“Um…Sherlock.”
Sherlock drained the last of his tea and stood. “You suppose right. No…no, John, I’ll leave the tree fetching to you if you don’t mind. I’m sure you’ll bring one home to rival that of Rockefeller Center. I
“Sherlock….are you there?”
“Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little?” ―
Now, those fortresses had all been washed away. Sherrinford may have been forged of steel and stone and built on solid ground, but quick sand had lain, unseen, beneath it all.
They made their way back to their table.
“Sherlock,” she started, grabbing his arm as he turned, “you will keep me posted?”
“Gone home for tea….
“For the love of god, Sherlock, do you have any idea what time it is? Why are you out here playing your violin at… three-ten in the morning?”
“Bloody hell!” He bellowed, startling poor Mr. Whiskers. “I am sorry my sweet, but I had best see what this intrusion is about before I go bloody barmy.”
John picked up a napkin and stood. He took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. “How do I look?”
God bless and happy Christmas!”
science fiction. I take it you don’t watch much of that.”
Well, wonder of wonders. I ran into an old friend from my time at Bart’s, Mike Stamford, while doing a bit of grocery shopping yesterday. We agreed to meet up tomorrow night at the Lamb and Flag around nine. I guess we’ll chew the fat, catch up with each other’s lives, down a couple of pints, and perhaps a glass of champagne, to welcome in 2010. As I don’t see any other prospects on the horizon, I guess that’s as good of a New Year’s celebratory offer as I’m likely to get. Thompson should be pleased, at least; me stepping out of my “comfort zone” and all. I’ve decided to pass on the Xanax.

She looked underneath the blankets at her nakedness.
29 November 2009
So, she had shut down. Her mind in turmoil and screaming for her brother, among other things. Had she gone through all of that just to fold in on herself? Would Sherlock return and hold her once more, whisper in her ear how much he had missed her, how happy he was to be with her after all this time?
“You know, that sounds wonderful. I really could use a nap.” John stood and Mrs. Hudson with him. He embraced her and kissed her cheek. “Thank you, again…for everything. And I’ll see you in a bit.” He retired to his hotel bedroom.
“When everything goes to hell, the people who stand by you without flinching -- they are your family.”
scent? It was all so… confusing. There was obvious sweat on his brow, but out of nerves or exertion I couldn’t be sure.
Sherlock walked over and sat down in John’s chair. He ran his free hand down the length of one of its arms and felt the rise of tears in his eyes.
She’d never really got into the party scene. Too many drugs…and she abhorred
Sherlock turned to walk away and this set John into action.
“I was just, ah…thinking. What if something has happened that’s prevented him from coming home…or even communicating with us? If he was on his own at one of those tree farms… I mean….” He didn’t finish.
loved, and her jealousy over his friendship with Victor was something she knew not how to process in any rational manner. To Mycroft, she was…lost. Locked up in a mind that would not, could not, allow her to live in civil society. She would always be a threat to people, of that he had no doubt, but did she deserve to be buried away from all human contact? His young heart could not accept that, but his young mind could come up with no better solution.
For some years, she had been providing Mycroft with very useful information in exchange for “treats” of her choosing. Her request for the unsupervised time with Jim Moriarty was not one he readily agreed to, but Eurus became silent, refusing to cooperate with him and her doctors, so Mycroft finally relented. He had even remarked how he was afraid that that decision would come back to haunt him one day. How right he was.
"No, I was just... You don't have a boyfriend, okay. That’s fine, it's all fine, whatever shakes your... boat. I'm gonna shut up now."
“I know that,” John said fondly, leaning into Sherlock’s hug a little. “But the real question seems to be how did
"No, actually,
“Yes, please. Yes.”
*panicky noises*
When John was seven, they had spent a week in Thailand. It had been perfect but returning home - all rain and clouds - quickly killed him again. His parents said it had been expensive and that he had no right to sulk but it had made no difference.
"Then I definitely don't see what you're saying."
Sherlock looked up at him, rolling his hips slowly. “Yeah.”
"So what do you think? There's a bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms."
"You think they're stupid enough?"
Sherlock felt his nose crinkle in confusion. “What are you talking about?”
Now that Christmas was almost there, John found himself nervous again for the first time in a long while. He actually had no idea what to buy for Sherlock, but it had to be special. The detective had begun to get insecure about their relationship again, John could tell, because the amount of body parts in the fridge had been alarmingly low lately.
John took the shopping bags and headed for the kitchen. Luckily, he had taken the time to clean and put the liver away so that he now had a relatively clean fridge with enough room. Then he went back to the living room.
Before John knew, he was on his back with Sherlock on top of him, kissing him. He was about to push the other man farther, but then Sherlock pulled back.
Sherlock moaned and moved his hand underneath John's shirt, almost scratching the skin with his fingers. John sucked on the skin gently and pulled back again, panting heavily.
"You okay? That wasn't too much?"
Mrs. Hudson immediately headed for the kitchen and was tutting at Sherlock in no time. "Oh Sherlock, the mess you've made."
I know I'm
“Sherlock, most of the recipients won’t really pay attention. And besides, we won’t be there to see if they do, anyways,” John sighed while Sherlock tried to fix a card after “John had done it improperly”.
Sherlock didn’t even need to ask John to come with him, he pulled his coat on as if it was the plan all along, and maybe it had been. They held hands the whole way again, and Sherlock didn’t even think about letting go.
always made him a bit edgy, and he hated himself for not being able to control it. Before he knew what was happening, Sherlock was almost shouting at the short man. “Why can’t you idiots stop saying ‘hi’ and just shut up already?” He quickly snapped his mouth shut after that, not wanting to get into any real trouble. He would take it out on the wall later.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, lowering the jumper. “I made it myself, thank you very much. And of course it is hideous, look at it!”
“John,” he just said, stopping in front of the doctor’s armchair and pulling an envelope from the pocket of his dressing gown. John took it, and read the card quickly. “’John Watson appreciation blog post’?” he raised his eyebrows, looking at Sherlock.
“Of course you’re going to eat with us, Mrs. Hudson,” he said. “If Sherlock gets those books to the shelf, you can put the tray here.”
Sherlock thought about it for a second, then nodded and plopped down on the sofa next to John. They moved around a bit until Sherlock sat with his back to John, who then started to massage the tense muscles on his shoulders and upper back. He could feel the tension on Sherlock, but soon the dancer was soft and pliant, leaning into John’s hands until John had to move them to the bed.
“Mmm, merry Christmas,” John mumbled, kissing his neck.
"Yeah," Sherlock whispered against John's lips. As John started to tug at the string, Sherlock had to add: "Just the pajamas though, if that's fine."
“Well, I do appreciate the gesture,” John grinned, sipping on the tea and then picking up one of the sandwiches. “Do you think you could make this an everyday habit?” he teased, biting into the bread.
“You know, you still didn’t do my legs. I might need to stretch them first though.”
(I honestly considered making that sack contain bongade stuff, wtf... Maybe I'll write a caption like that on my ig page, lol.)
They got Sherlock patched up, a solid cast all the way to Sherlock’s elbow, the right arm – of course it had to be the right one, dammit, and it was a mutual decision that there would be no case after all. John didn’t have the faintest why Greg had decided that calling Sherlock would be a good idea, John had made it clear that the holidays would be spent without chasing criminals. But apparently murder still happened and Sherlock would’ve probably been perfectly content to spent his whole Christmas running from crime scene to crime scene.
The last days until Christmas Eve are filled with fluff, drinks and some sexy times.
"Oh, come here," Aziraphale mumbled, tugging him up gently and kissing him. He tasted of wine, and something that Crowley swore was the taste of angel post-orgasm. He ended up in Aziraphale's lap, the two of them sharing the last glass of wine until it was time for a round two.
~’*’~
John let out a laugh and, before he would change his mind, lowered his pajamas and pants a little, just enough to make room and got to work. Admittedly, the idea of Sherlock watching him made his excitement climb even higher as he put a hand on himself.
And then, finally hearing his Words, even though they were shouted at him in anger, made him feel high in a way he hadn’t been expecting. Of course he had envisioned this moment time and time again but reality still overpowered it all.
John had a nice morning with a good breakfast, a still-clean fridge (yes, he was still happy about it), and his laptop. He had read the news, made a few notes about their latest case and scrolled through a few interesting articles by the time Sherlock came home, carrying a big bag and a suspicious bucket.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, spotting the tag hanging from the puppy’s collar. ‘Iris’, it said. “It’s a yes.”
Even as he paid the cabbie he was half ready to turn back, but somehow he managed to walk to the door of 221 and knock.
to access some important evidence – which everyone else said didn’t matter but it did – and now he was trapped in a coffee shop, trying to pry his way out of the crowd that definitely hadn’t been there a minute ago. He already regretted ignoring Molly back at the morgue, he could’ve got his coffee there when he realised he wouldn’t be going home just yet.
Sherlock smiled and walked to the tv stand, turning on the dc player and putting one cd in. When he pressed play, the flat was filled with the first chords of “Jingle Bell Rock”. John laughed and shook his head, pulling Sherlock close and kissing him softly. “Alright, that’ll do it. Let’s just eat something first though, I’m starving.”
“I knew it was psychosomatic, as was the limp.”
They did catch the murderer the next morning when her supposed next victim called the police. Apparently the victim had grown suspicious about her brother's wife after the brother's two clients got killed and called the cops after the wife turned up at her door.
John woke up next morning as his phone started ringing. Sherlock just let out an unhappy sound and rolled over, so John escaped to the hallway to take the call. When he noticed it was Mrs Hudson, he frowned and answered. “John Watson.”
“You’re brilliant,” John grinned, kissing him softly. Sherlock kissed back for a few seconds and then broke away. “You haven’t seen the gift part,” he mumbled quietly, taking John’s wrist and guiding it to the small of his back.
"Oh, fuck off you smug bastard."
“Your toes are red and freezing cold, just get in there,” Sherlock retorted, getting a towel ready for him. “I’ll get everything ready while you soak.”
’?” He scoffed but picked up the fork and took a few bites. John ate his portion and watched Sherlock sip his tea.
"John, what is happening?" Sherlock eyed the tree with a look of realisation on his face. "What day is it?"
“The whole card? Yeah,” John nodded, smirking at Sherlock. When the detective just nodded in reply, sitting up and then biting his lip nervously, John smiled and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “If you meant ‘just the antlers’ as in with the robe, it’s fine. You know it is very much fine.”
“So how did you know about Afghanistan? Or Harry?” They had just got into the cab, but John really was dying to know. “And please don’t tell me you’ve been following me, I just complimented you.” The man chuckled, but John saw that he was slightly uneasy.
“I know I promised you could watch this one, but could you be so kind to give a rose to each of the lead roles before the final bow?”
"An expret- exeprim- experiment." Sherlock frowned at his pronunciation mishap and John almost fell over, laughing loudly. “Time for bed, Sherrrlock.”
“Why would I look at some random bloke’s tights when you’re there as well and much more interesting?”
Just when John's orgasm hit though, he pulled back to gather John's cum on his tongue instead of letting it flow straight down his throat. (John was always amazed and a little envious when Sherlock did that without choking, he hadn't even managed to deepthroat the detective properly yet.)
~’*’~
This is a place where I feel at home.
So, he needed a leotard. And that was what he told the girl at the counter of the ballet store Mrs. Hudson seemed to prefer. Of course he wouldn’t take chances with his store choices, it was going to be an investment after all.
“Okay, okay,” he chuckled and got to work. “Just say if I’m too rough, I might get distracted too.”
Sherlock kissed him for a while and then broke the kiss, nodding towards the fridge. “You were about to make breakfast. All this hard work is making me hungry,” he stated, sitting down at the kitchen table, which was still as cluttered as always.
Sherlock’s answer was to pull him into another, slightly more heated kiss.
And because I can't help myself, here's
"Alright, we can take a break," Sherlock grinned, taking John's hand and pulling him to the changing area. They changed into their shoes and got hot chocolates from Hotel Chocolat. They sat down to enjoy their cocoas and Sherlock drew a bee on the cream on John's drink, making the doctor giggle.
to have sex with you. I really wanted to give this to you. I'm hard to buy for, I know it, and I just thought this would've been a gift for both of us."
“Nope, husband,” John grinned, not caring if the cabbie stayed silent throughout the rest of the ride. He was left outside a small café, the front window decorated with fairy lights. As he stepped inside, he saw that the tables had candles and holly decorations on them, and all the workers were wearing Christmas hats.
“Is something wrong?” Sherlock shook his head and reached for John’s hand. “I lied to you when we met. I could’ve, I...” His voice broke for some reason. John just tilted his head slightly, suddenly looking nervous.
Sherlock shrugged and straightened up at the words. “I guess I should be happy that I got a role at all, given how late I auditioned,” he mumbled, tugging on the hem of the candy-shirt before lifting his head, nodding to himself and marching towards the stage.
After that, it was only a matter of time before he got sent home with a gunshot wound and a diagnosis of PTSD. John was almost happy for that. He didn't think he could work as a doctor and keep sane anymore. Even before Afghanistan he had been losing his night's sleep sometimes because of someone dying on their Words. Now he didn't need to worry about it, no hospital would employ him for a while. But the shift to civilian life wasn’t easy, work or no. There hadn't been a single night where he hadn't woken up from a nightmare, usually followed by a mild panic attack, and the lack of proper sleep only made his apparently psychosomatic limp worse. He got up every morning, stared at the blank wall for hours and still chose to go for a walk instead of shooting his brains out.
He wanted to laugh as he ran up the stairs. He pulled on his shoes and, without realising it, also tucked his gun to the back of his jeans. They were dealing with a murderer, after all.
The doctor closed his eyes and took a deep breath as Sherlock repeated the process of massaging every inch of John, adding more pressure with every pass from shoulder to ankle. John kept humming in agreement when Sherlock found a particularly soft spot, trying not to moan aloud as he only got harder and harder at the sensuous touch.
“Of course I’m sure,” Sherlock scoffed, starting to pull John to the bedroom. “I’ve had 24 days to reconsider after writing that card and not once have I had any doub–“
But there was something about almost bleeding to death on scorching hot Afghan desert that finally made winters bearable.
John chuckled, shaking his head and handing him the smaller bouquet. “Well, lucky for my secrets, you have your lazy deduction days too,” he grinned, kissing his cheek. Sherlock rolled his eyes playfully and poked him on the side before leading him off the stage along with the other dancers. “Well… how did you like it?” he asked as they walked to the changing rooms, hand in hand.
“So you had moved in well before me. I thought so,” he mumbled and laid his cheek above the brunette’s heart feeling the almost elevated, strong pulse. “It doesn’t matter, Sherlock. It’s all fine.”’
"No, you - you didn't. It's just..." The brunette was clearly struggling for words.
And I built a home
2) I thought it'd be nice to add the pics here, I've done quite a lot of visual research for this fic and I wanted to share some of it :) so there is a pic of the wine glass I imagined to the candlelight dinner, and the hedgehog cookies of course
John nodded, chuckling a bit. “Alright, I’m sure we can manage with six guests.”
John paused, breathing in a few times before closing the distance between them and pushing himself so close that his body head was seeping into Sherlock’s back. “Love, I would never…” He started, laying his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. “I would, and I will,
something for this...
That day’s surprise was ‘Christmas dinner preparations’, which meant baking and cooking and preparing ingredients for tomorrow’s party appetizers and tasting a few different versions of mulled wine to see which one was the best. Sherlock got clingy when tipsy, and after that they barely got anything done when Sherlock demanded they cuddle on the sofa for hours.
"Oh, it's nothing, I'll bring it all to 221b tomorrow. Poor Sherlock, he should take care with a weather like that. Now where's that turkey?"
“Oh, don’t thank me dear, I’d gotten a bigger role for him if they hadn’t all been filled ages ago. But I’ve got to dash, tell him I said hi.”
And just like that something just clicked. John was just sitting there on his chair, with the paper spread on his lap, tea cup balanced on the arm of the chair. It was a sight that greeted Sherlock almost every day, something utterly domestic. Only now the whole situation hit him in the face hard.
"I know it's... fine. I think I should point out now that I consider myself married to my work, so if you –"
More fluff, and actual date night, and some more sexy times.
When he got home, he barely had time for a shower and quick dinner before Sherlock was dragging him into a cab. They went to the same place as before, this time they arrived there a bit later so the Christmas lights seemed to be exceptionally bright. It was snowing again and the ground was covered in a thin layer of pure white snow and John thought it was wonderful.
"Three actually; it's a three-patch problem. Could you send a text, the number's on the desk," he mumbled, waving his hand on the direction of the cluttered desk. John got up and found a nametag on top of a wobbly pile of what seemed to be hand-written notes of scientific data.
"Mmm, but you love me."
John got a sudden urge to end the party and get Sherlock to their bedroom. But ignored it, keeping up the happy Christmas spirit. Sherlock kept glancing at him and grinning, and John knew the detective was enjoying himself despite all the protests and eye-rollings.
They got to meet one of the horses, cleaning her up and then equipping her so that Sherlock and John could try riding. John was a little rusty, but he quickly caught on but Sherlock had more trouble. For some reason, he just couldn’t get the horse to listen to him, no matter how good he’d been with the dogs.
When he’d taken care of his part, John found his way to the dressing rooms. As he was weaving his way through the other dancers making their way out of the dressing room, John realised he could very well get used to this, the buzzing and rustling of the costumes. Stepping inside, he found Sherlock in the dressing room, already in his usual clothes and his bag ready.
As the evening went on, the sky got darker and darker, highlighting the fairy lights hanging basically everywhere, and John had to admit it was pretty damn romantic. They went to the rink for another go after finishing their drinks, Sherlock got to show off the few skating tricks he knew, including an impressive pirouette, while John just circled around slowly and watched him.
John hesitated for a moment, but after seeing no signs of fear or nervousness, he kissed back and licked Sherlock's lips to gain access. Sherlock opened his mouth and moaned quite loudly.
Sherlock stared at him and then the stable, before nodding determinedly. They went inside, and John couldn’t help but smile at the familiar scent and sounds.
The noise of the passing train occasionally drowned Sherlock's words, and truthfully John thought the git deserved it. They had finished a case about twenty seconds ago, but the brunette was already complaining about how bored he was.
That took John by surprise again and he let out a tiny huff. "You really are brilliant." The blonde looked sincere, and that really confused Sherlock and his eyes widened slightly in shock before he could stop himself.
"We didn't even get a tree." Sherlock lowered his gaze to the cookies again. John put the plate to the coffee table next to their tea cups. "Did you want one? I don't mind, though a few fairy lights or something would've been nice."
"As I said yesterday, a string of lovers, she'd never leave her phone at home!" Sherlock stood up again and dumped the case on the floor, starting his pacing again. John was taken aback. "So you mean... The murderer? The murderer has the phone?" He was definitely feeling slow but then again things were getting a bit weird.
He took his place at the barre and got ready, starting his routine. He could feel the novel feeling of the silky fabric, the way it clung to his chest and hips as he lifted his arm to the third position.
When Sherlock decided they had done enough, John was sweating and shaking out his tired legs. “Okay, that’s actually difficult,” he admitted, even smiling a bit.
They ended up getting rather drunk, leaning into each other as they climbed the stairs up to their flat. As soon as the door was closed, John pinned Sherlock to the surface and then they proceeded to snog rather sloppily due to their inebriated states, ending up giving each other hasty handjobs on the living room floor.
“I had arranged the food days ago, I only needed to send a text when Lestrade fetched you from the boat,” Sherlock said, shrugging nonchalantly. “You can’t say my timing isn’t right on spot this time,” he added teasingly.
"Hang on, I'm still working on the number," John had to chuckle. Sherlock seemed a bit impatient as he jumped off the sofa and paced the living room.
“Hmh,” was the only answer he got and John tried again.
Sherlock smiled almost proudly, his cheeks turning a little pink. "I'm very stealthy... And it's a well-known fact that you're not very observant."
All the air left John's lungs as Sherlock practically jumped on him. "Mmwhat, Sh'lock," he groaned, opening his eyes. "Am I late for work?"
I swear I'll catch up before Christmas!
“You were much more nervous before the show on Monday than you are today,” John noted, stroking his arms. Sherlock’s nervous mood before the show seemed almost surreal compared to this moment, when they were calmly standing in the momentarily-empty dressing room.
“Should I turn around or-” the brunet stopped as he took in John’s no doubt beet-red face. “Oh.”
John tried to be present at every practice, first at the studio with only Sherlock and then with other backgrounds as well. Quite soon, they moved to practice at the site where the shows would be taking place. John thought the stage looked huge, but with all the dancers it wasn’t that big after all.
Sherlock settled into John's lap so that his back was leaning to John's chest. Then he tried again. "I just panicked. It felt so good, but I got scared. I always do. I can't... I can't think." His voice was soft again. John held him a bit tighter.
John wondered if the detective had done something to earn the insults. Donovan bit first, and Sherlock just seemed to defend himself. The Anderson guy was even worse, but again Sherlock definitely fought back.
“That's amazing, how did you do that?”
John had time to look around, and he chuckled at the Christmas decorations strewn all over New Scotland Yard. Greg had even stuffed a small plastic tree on the corner of his office, which John found funny for some reason.
“But Greg asked for a day off as well for Tuesday, and you know I’ll be at the show,” Molly twisted her hands as he looked at John pleadingly. It was her day off work, but she sometimes liked to come by for a cup of coffee and a chat.
“Piss off.” He smirked and gave another chuckle and John heard himself
(To Build A Home – The Cinematic Orchestra)
"Yes, love, whatever feels good." John couldn't help bringing his own pelvis up a few times when Sherlock continued his ministrations.
John was humming to himself when Sherlock wrapped his arms around his waist again, kissing the back of his neck. "John. The program lasts for an hour and thirteen minutes," he announced, and John rolled his eyes fondly at the clear hint. "You're really high maintenance, you know that?" Sherlock just sucked a mark on John's neck as a reply, making John's knees feel a little weak. "Damn, alright. You win," he grinned, turning around and kissing Sherlock deeply.
“Uh, why not? You clearly like weird-looking Christmas jumpers, and your favourite one is getting rather worn out.”
Ground had arose and passed its knees
John of course noticed how worked up Sherlock was, and somehow he felt almost guilty about it. He had had to practically demand Sherlock to sleep at least six hours every night instead of trying to practice in the dark of night. He definitely didn’t mind watching Sherlock stretch in the living room instead of doing his schoolwork, not with his leggings on, but he wasn’t going to give up sleeping because of that and neither was Sherlock as far as John was concerned. Maybe he was already more like a doctor than he had thought.
When he reached the police tape, the Donovan woman was by his side. "So who are you? Did the freak follow you home?"
At home, Sherlock cuddled John on the sofa and watched him study for a while before starting to stretch. He clearly tried not to bother John too much, avoiding pushing his feet or head on his face. He was always a bit worried about bothering John too much but John didn’t mind, smiling into his textbook.
"Do you have to grope me every time?" Sherlock gasps as John's hand slips to his trousers, squeezing his arse as the doctor bends closer to look at the laptop screen.
This time Sherlock didn't panic. He just closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths before answering.
John had woken up with no Sherlock on the bed, but as soon as he’d reached the bathroom to brush his teeth, the detective had rushed in and announced there was a case. So, John had ditched the thoughts about a warm shower and headed right to the kitchen to make a quick breakfast.
"I can't, my socks need indexing," Sherlock replied, kissing John's neck once more before pulling back. They tidied themselves up and then attacked the basket full of dry, freshly cleaned laundry. "I can't believe I've lost three white socks again!" John groaned, tossing a now-pairless sock back into the basket. Sherlock hummed, busy with his own pile of socks.
~'*'~
"It was broccoli not gai lan, John. The menu was lying." Sherlock hiccupped and reached for John. They were currently walking home from a Chinese place they were trying out.
"Yes, yes, just tap in the number and these words exact-"
“It sounds perfect,” John interrupted, hugging him tightly. “You daft git, how could I ever say no?” Sherlock chuckled against John’s shoulder, hugging him back. Soon though, they had to keep walking so they could catch a taxi and get back to the flat. Apparently Sherlock had one more thing he wanted to show John.
, but...”
Until it disappeared
John took his hand and let himself get pulled to the sofa. “Of course, love.”
John grinned thankfully. “That I will.”
"Angelo! Headless nun, if you don't mind."
“It’s okay, you haven’t ruined anything. We have both been a bit busy and moody, but it doesn’t mean the whole Christmas is ruined.” Sherlock lifted his gaze and John could see he was really feeling the strain of his injury and apparently the last few days too.
But when they were headed to bed, Sherlock noticed that John took a few more minutes in the loo than usual. John had brushed his teeth already and Sherlock couldn't hear the water running anymore, and when John finally emerged Sherlock could see how he slid his phone in his robe pocket before draping the robe over a chair. He pulled the edge of the duvet in a silent invitation and John slipped under the covers next to him, pulling him closer and nuzzling his neck before falling sleep.
“No, don’t apologise.” The man interrupted him, sounding agitated. “Don’t you fucking apologise.”
After they broke the kiss, Sherlock pulled the chair John had used and hung the tinsel and the mistletoe on the doorway leading to the kitchen. When he was done, he stepped down and was immediately pulled under the decorations by John.
"Um, just let me know if I'm too rough, or well..." Sherlock mumbled, and then John heard the massage oil bottle open. Soon he felt Sherlock's oily hands spread the oil on his back, warming up the muscles with slow, long pulls. Sherlock worked down John's backside, from his neck to his ankles, first slowly and then with more force and tempo, which caused John to make a few joyful noises.
“Sherlock?” he called out, walking to the kitchen, where Sherlock was cleaning up one of his experiments, dressed in one of his immaculate suits and the damn purple shirt. John stopped on his tracks, licking his lips and swallowing.
~'*'~
"I need to put this in the fridge. It's too big to fit it in my containers, and I can't possibly cut it," Sherlock said, pointing to the bucket. "It's airtight, and I promise I'll deal with it in a few days, but for now..?"
John Watson, his soulmate. Last night came rushing back and Sherlock almost yelped again as he realised he’s once again left John behind. Stupid cab driver, he should’ve known bet-
made John's skin positively itch, and not in a bad way. But after meeting the first person there – a woman called Donovan – and hearing the brunette's response made John realise there was much more to Sherlock than he'd seen yet.
And just like that, his annoyance reached the tipping point. Hearing
John kissed back until someone else nearly collided with them, and they had to break the kiss and start moving again. Sherlock rested his hands on John's hips from the behind and stayed close to him as they slowly circled the rink a few more times.
"You just said you remember nothing about trains. I didn't know you ever knew about them." The brunette looked around. John felt a funny trickle down his spine. Does he speak aloud a lot like that?
That woke him up completely and he rose up to his knees and elbows frantically, moving his groin away Sherlock's stomach. He was just contemplating getting off completely, going to loo or making tea, when a hand wrapped around his hip and pulled him back down.
John pulled back and looked at him. “Are you sure?”
He cringed inwardly at his sceptic-sounding tone, but if Sherlock got offended he hid it well on the nod of his head, and John quickly rushed to amend his words. "I mean, I'm not saying this isn't the most exciting thing to happen to me in a long while, but is this like your job or something? The police don't consult amateurs."
It was the first rehearsal with the costumes, and Sherlock was practically fuming at the puffy, pink-white striped candy costume he had been given as he pulled it on.
John just tutted at him and found a cold pack for his cheek.
When the dancers bowed for the first time, John excused himself and got to the stage, loosening the string of the rose bouquet. He started handing the roses, thanking all the leads and then letting them take their last bows as he himself subtly shifted to the back row, where Sherlock was already watching him.
The DI took a quick look at the room where his team was working. "Uh, yeah he does. And luckily it keeps him busy. Even Mycroft's worried whenever Sherlock gets too bored."
When he glanced at John’s gleeful smirk, Sherlock only groaned and buried his head on his pillow. “Oh please, John, just get on with it!” he managed to groan. John giggled and straddled Sherlock’s body again, this time sitting just above his arse.
Sherlock had to pause to take a breath and it was John’s turn to just stare. The brunette risked a glance at his direction, and John opened his mouth again. “That really is brilliant. You can do that with anyone?”
John could see the eyeroll underneath the blindfold and chuckled. Then he took the final spoon. "Okay, this is the last one. Open up."
“Well, this occasion needed it,” Sherlock shrugged, undressing too and then stepping into the tub, pulling John in there too. They found a comfortable position, cuddling in the warm water until it grew tepid, enjoying the romantic atmosphere and the lovely scents.
The next day John came home to find Sherlock about to bake something again. Sherlock got him an apron too and then they baked gingerbreads from a dough Sherlock had prepared earlier and drank eggnog that Sherlock had prepared earlier too.
“Yeah, what is it actually?” he inquired after a while. “It must have something to do with your deducting, right?”
“So, why breakfast in bed?” John asked, looking at the tray rather hungrily. Sherlock chuckled and leaned into his shoulder, shrugging again. “It’s romantic, and since it’s the first Advent Sunday I thought it’d be appropriate,” he mumbled, picking up a slice of apple and eating it.
Sure, as John looked at his phone, there was a notification about a new contact. It must be a feature that John didn’t know about. Of course Sherlock would be showing off like that. He saved the number and tapped ‘call’. As Sherlock’s phone started to ring, the brunette took a quick glance at it and smiled. John let it ring out for a second more before pressing red and tucking his phone back into his pocket. He smiled at the thought of Sherlock saving his phone number. A feeling of something more solid, more permanent.
After a short moment of internal struggle, John fetched the cane from under his bed. This whole thing made him feel a tad unsteady and having the cane with him was sometimes assuring, however much he hated the damn thing.
They practiced the basic positions and movements, John “catching on quite quickly but moving too stiffly” as Sherlock put it. John realised ballet was actually quite a demanding sport while he watched Sherlock lift his leg up to ninety degrees easily and he himself was barely managing forty-five degrees without losing his posture.
“Wait, what are you wearing? Is this one of my jumpers?” he asked, pulling back to look at the garment. It was rather short for Sherlock.
“Oh, he’s fine. And I’m sure he was just surprised, you know how he is… I’m sure he’s not going to pass this opportunity.”
“Alright, alright,” John chuckled, kissing back and pulling his fingers free, wiping them on his shirt as he pulled it off. Then Sherlock stripped him from his pyjama bottoms and boxers before straddling his hips again. “Now hurry up,” he pleaded.
John got up and laid on top of Sherlock. Folding his arms carefully on Sherlock’s chest, John laid his head on top of them and looked at Sherlock. “I have never thought of leaving. Sherlock, you’re the best thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn’t give it up.”
John laughed and without further thinking got up to carefully straddle Sherlock’s waist. He marveled again how comfortable it was for him to be with Sherlock, how easily intimacy just happened between them. He had never gotten anywhere with other guys before, too awkward to even try really. There hadn’t been any barriers with Sherlock, despite the fact that Sherlock lacked sexual drive most of the time. He did love to cuddle though, and that worked better than fine with John.
John nodded silently, examining the brown skates. "To be honest, I'm quite out of words right now."
Now he had Sherlock's interest for some reason. They had stopped and stood in the edge of the railways. "Winter? Why winter?"
With the tray safely on the desk, Mrs. Hudson scuttled downstairs to fetch
"So ballet is hard after all? Lucky you have a competent med student here and nowhere to go,” he said with a smirk. True enough, it was Saturday and they would have the whole day for themselves. With a gentle prompt from John, Sherlock lowered his arm and John started to massage his shoulders lightly.
“You know, there are two more mistletoe decorations in the box,” Sherlock mumbled, grinning at the ceiling.
Sherlock, who had walked over to the tree to stare at it, turned to look at him, looking slightly uneasy. "You mean like guests and all? We've done that before. Shall we exchange presents?"
John looked shocked and kept staring. Then he looked at his feet, and back at Sherlock.
Starting on the turkey, John spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out how to season it. He tried researching a bit but every site he found had different suggestions and John ended up knocking on Mrs. Hudson's flat, hoping she wouldn't be too bothered.
When he came down from his orgasm, John reached a hand towards Sherlock and tugged him closer, seeing him palm the bulge tenting his trousers. "Fuck let me, love," he groaned, opening Sherlock's pants and plunging his hands inside, cupping and fondling his length until the detective came too, moaning John's name through gritted teeth and leaning over John as he curled up a little.
As soon as the cab stopped, John handed the money and followed Sherlock inside and up the stairs into their flat. As soon as the door clicked shut behind them, Sherlock was pressing John against it and kissing him heatedly. John hummed and hooked one leg around Sherlock’s hips, pushing their groins against each other.
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
"Jennifer Wilson? That's the name of the woman, the murdered woman?"
And so, after eating the quick hash John put together they settled on the couch with the box between them. John grinned and opened the flaps of the box again, pulling out the first strand of tinsel.
“So, you think it qualifies as a Christmas calendar surprise?” Sherlock asked, pulling a slightly crumpled envelope from the pocket of his dressing gown. He gave it to John, who pulled out a small card with a huge number 1 on it. The other side said ‘clean, well-stocked fridge’. John had to chuckle, smiling at the card fondly and then lifting his gaze to Sherlock.
John was surprised when his neck wasn’t sore at all when they woke up. Sherlock on the other hand was complaining about both a sore neck and an aching wrist. John got up and produced a painkiller for Sherlock and a cup of tea for himself. “Did you want some breakfast or do you think you can hold on until the dinner?”
Sunday morning, John didn’t let Sherlock get out of bed for hours, cuddling him and kissing all over his face while mumbling sweet nothings.
Sherlock chuckled too and put on some Christmas music before sitting down on the floor as well. "Well, why not? I promised to surprise you every day, and since you're so surprised when I'm helpful..." Sherlock shrugged with a big grin on his face.
"Sherlock..."
"Mmmm, love?" John hummed, reading something on his laptop.
John was able to get up without waking Sherlock, the detective sleeping unusually soundly. "Probably the alcohol," John mused to himself. He had never actually been able to sneak out of bed secretly if Sherlock was still there.
“I doubt you’d serve time for this but keep the gun hidden for a while to avoid any trouble. I’m sure Angelo has kept your cane there, we can go and fetch it today. But now I need to sort out my mind palace.”
“We didn’t, those are actually an extra pair from Mrs Hudson, she didn’t need them all so I asked if we could borrow them,” Sherlock admitted, coming to stand next to John.
, written on the man’s left shoulder, on Sherlock's handwriting! Sherlock raised his gaze and looked at the man with his eyes wide. For a second he had no idea what to do. Then he felt himself tug his own sleeve up in a haze to reveal the simple ‘hi’ decorating his inner right wrist. Sherlock could see wetness in the blonde man’s eyes as they followed his movements. He took a while to stare at Sherlock's wrist. Shifting, the doctor then raised his eyes back to Sherlock’s suddenly smiling coyly. Sherlock cleared his throat.
Sherlock swiftly picked up the case and sat down on his leather armchair in front of John, planting the case wide open in his lap. "See, what is missing from this case?"
"Hmh? Have you seen your arm? No, you go rest, I was going to do this myself anyway." John pulled out the bag of wheat flour that he had managed to keep hidden from Sherlock so it was usable. As he turned to pick up the eggs from the cupboard, he nearly ran into Sherlock who was already holding the container.
