“How did you know that?” he asked.

"Tony Stark of Earth-12041. The stretchy dude over there is Dr. Reed Richards. We're helping your boy here get back to you so you can have your romantic reunion in the stars."
“Smuggling of exotic animals -- there’s a market near the docks no one notices. No one respectable goes near.” She dropped her shoulders. “My family knows ways to move cargo around without government involvement.”
On the day of departure, Tony arrived with his luggage, tools and other scientific equipment. Only the best for his team. Which now included Jane Foster, recommended by Mr. Odinson. She was an astronomer with a Club endorsement.
"He can definitely tell I'm smarter." Stark chimes in.
"We did not need to hear about your sex life, Tony." Clint groans.
Turrets rise and lock on to the shoulders of the haulers even as one of the others rushes forward with a whole strip of ammo.
"It's New York. There's always a place open somewhere," Clint reminds him.
For round one of Stony bingo, square 'tentacles' (Y3) on my card.
"We've had quite a few encounters with our other selves in the past." Stark leans back in his chair at the kitchen table, more relaxed than Tony is given the circumstances. "There's even a council of Reeds that deal with these shit everyday."
Steve looked over the gathered crowd, checking that everyone was there. “Good morning, we need to address the aims of this expedition.” He noticed the sudden perking up of several heads. Better than coffee to get their attention.
“This is Captain Rogers,” Sam explained to her.
“The same. I heard about your recovery -- I wasn’t part of the team but I know of the good people involved,” Rhodey replied generously.
“New person here,” Romanoff said to Rogers.
He settled down by the fire while Clint took over his tent. Something didn’t feel right, he knew it in his bones. He looked at each tent carefully, and saw that Tony’s seemed unoccupied. Steve went over to the tent and knew immediately that Tony had not returned from his walk. He flicked a match for light and saw gun and metal parts strewn across the bed along with traces of gunpowder.
Tony thought of the recent illustrations in the Club magazine. “Is he doing illustrations for the club magazine?”
the story: married!stony. steve misplaces his wedding ring as he goes about a normal day of washing dishes, reading, painting, and watching tv; freaks out searching all over for it, and after giving up, thinking he’s lost it for good, tony to the rescue, having found it somewhere steve left it and forgot by mistake! :3
Rogers blinked. “You are the best choice,” he said as if there weren’t any other choices. Tony could name over twenty scientists in less than five seconds who would jump at the chance to work with Rogers. He was not one of them.
"Why don't you show me how well you kiss and we'll work out the rest later."
Tony takes a deep breath and deflates. "I can't do this. I-- I'm sorry, guys. I just---"
“I’m here to find stolen Pym equipment.” Hope sat up straighter. “Has to be Stark. No other reason he’d be on this trip. He’s stealing our inventions for Justin Hammer.”
“Indeed not,” T’Challa said.
“Yeah?” Tony looks up at him hesitantly, “You were really- You’re not just humoring me?” He asks, and Steve huffs, nudging Tony with his elbow just a little.
Wanda blew a strand of hair out of her eyes. “I’ll have to train her then. Show her how to survive out here. Instead of begging for treats.”
“Tony --”
Miss Maximoff did not appear to be a woman of any means. Her red and brown clothes were worn and mended carefully, but otherwise she was presentable, brown hair tucked up under a wide-brimmed hat and her gloves were clean and without spots. Steve noted the unusual number of hat pins holding the hat in place and the way she wore the hat to obscure her face.
He went over to Redwing’s pen. She was scratching up the ground to pull up the last of the sweet grass. She bounded over to Steve, Tony and Sam and cooed merrily at them. Steve gave her a treat, opened the gate and walked towards the edge of the woods.
“Or not. My address is common knowledge if you have connections to the Club. I can ask Sharon --”
The New Explorers’ Club sent out regular expeditions and Steve knew the expeditions well. Actually he’d been familiar with the first Explorers’ Club.
But where? Ah, right, he was in a cave. Light flooded through the cave mouth, nearly blinding him. And his feet were wet from the last wavelet splashing into the cave. The AIM soldiers had stripped him down to his shirtsleeves and had ransacked his pockets as far as he could tell.
“You?”
It was one of the New Explorers’ Club expeditions that had found him and the sorcerer Dr. Strange had been the key to springing Steve from the void.
“They are all the rage back in New Timely -- dinosaur pets. You could fuel a couple of years of research if we brought back a boatload of the things.”
However, the instructions for this expedition were more extensive than in the past. He could see the favor to T’Challa but not for Pym. It made his head hurt to try and sort it all out.
“It’s an expedition. To the Savage Land,” Rhodey repeated back to Tony.
“I was asking about the crates -- what did you take out of them?” Barton asked Lang.
Tony blinked to try to clear his vision. “You’re blocking the view.”

He remembered the old building with crowded exhibits behind cloudy glass and the peeling exhibit labels. It was a Sunday afternoon treat from his mother. In their Sunday best (still worn and patched), they would walk to the old museum, buying a cookie or two. He remembered walking up the steps to the Gothic building with its spiked towers and multi-paned glass windows and the Cathedral hush in the galleries. Steve wanted to be like those dashing explorers featured in pictures in outside hallways.

“You’re enjoying this far too much,” Tony said.
Rogers nodded. “We need to keep this quiet. In case whoever is involved trips up.”
“Lord Stark,” Rogers said. “I am very sorry -- the crowd --”
Fill for square S4...
Steve was gorgeous under all those clothes and Tony couldn’t tear his eyes away. Steve had turned out to be a capable, strong, and intelligent man with unexpected fine qualities.
, ‘Oh Crap!’ on my card. I didn’t have the energy to do more than a sketchy comic, but I like it anyway. ^^
Worried, but knowing that Tony had to work through his anger, Steve retired to his tent for the evening. He sat in the office part of his tent, sketching. Redwing was nosing around one of her toys. She refused to spend the night in her pen and Steve didn’t discourage it, after having caught a far-off glimpse of a velociraptor. Besides, he missed her snoring during the night.
He passed by an annoyed Rogers on the way back to the table. Jan leaned over towards him when Tony sat down. “You could have left off the sarcasm in the last line.”
Look at them, they're adorable!
Overall, the expedition worked well as a team. They were steadily emptying the hold of their supplies and equipment. The ship would be returning to the Port City and would be back within a month with more supplies or to pick up the expedition if they were ready to return.
As Tony had already noted, most of the expedition crew had been given quarters on this airship. He had already met Wilson at the Annual Dinner. Bruce introduced him to Thor and the renowned Dr. Foster. Tony nodded good evening to Hope Van Dyne on his way to the bar. As he poured himself a drink, he saw Scott Lang, Van Dyne’s plus one for the expedition, peppering Captain Rogers with questions.
Tony fires up his thrusters. "You had me at paperwork."
“You worked with him years ago.”
Steve used a butter knife to slice through the seal on the back of the letter. Nothing inside the envelope. He carefully unfolded the letter, years of booby-trapped communications had trained Steve to be wary.
“No, it doesn’t. Not to me. That seems a lot like what HYDRA did with the Zeppelins back in my day.”
"It's not like they're hard to find. And there's not a lot of work for people like us in this place," the man defends himself, forgetting his fear in the name of science. Frankly, Tony can relate. Then seemingly, remembering his precarious position, he flinches. "Mr. Iron Man, sir."
“I’m not keen on that,” Tony admitted. He studied Rogers for any sign of his thoughts on the matter. Tony had assumed that Rogers would be dead set against any magic user given his years in the Void.
“Yes. We need to go to our seats, Rhodey. See you next week, Captain.” Tony steered Rhodey over to the stairwell that led up to their box.
I have a square on my board that says ‘Genderswap’, and I decided to fill that.
Until he met Captain Rogers, whose clear and instant disapproval of Tony had been broadcast the first time they met. Tony had grown up on the legends of Captain Rogers. Meeting the real thing was particularly challenging. Tony knew the real deal when he met him. So many people tried to bluff Tony or hide their true selves. But there was Captain Rogers, as real as it gets, solid confidence, unblemished courage, a true hero for the ages.
Redwing gave him an unimpressed look and went to beg Tony and Sam for another treat.
“Of course, Captain, let’s start -- Mr. Odinson? You offered to start?”
“You’re leaving me alone with Rogers. How can you desert me like that?”
, some steve/tony fluffiness :
"Rude. See if you get a blowjob after this." Stark calls after him.
“What about us?” Sam asked.
"We're just glad the pining is over."
"Leave me alone, I'm a senior citizen!" Steve calls after him. When Matt was out of sight, he sighs. "Looks like work interrupts date night again."

“Apparently not.” Rhodey checked his ticket and seat number.
Tony ignored the quizzical looks from the others as he walked over to Bruce. Rogers appeared lost for a moment until he found Sam by the window.
“Carol has a friend --”
“That it is shockingly common. Which animal?”
Tony says his thanks to Reed and gives Stark a quick hug. Then, looking up at the screen to his Steve and the rest of his team, he gives them a sloppy salute. "See you on the flip side."
Either way, though, he knew he had to go wherever Steve would send him, even if the man turned out not to be there. Because that's the type of person Tony was. He put his heart on his sleeve to anyone that showed him affection. His father had been horrible to him and now he sought out the attention he needed ever since he was a little kid. He had to go see Steve. He hoped it didn't end horribly. Honestly, he was kind of hoping the other man wouldn't show up.
"Steve, I-" he couldn't do that. SHIELD agents would want to be there. And they wouldn't take no for an answer. He wasn't afraid they'd hurt Steve. He was afraid Steve was gonna hurt them if he let this happen.
"No. He'll fly there." Harley looked up at him like he was crazy. "Peter, I'm gonna put you in my suit and you're going to fly back to the compound, alright? Dr. Cho will be waiting for you and she'll be there right away to help you." The boy grasped his hand.
"Okay," the boy responded, not understanding this situation. Tony walked over and sat beside the boy, unsure of leaving him. He was afraid something would happen and he wouldn't be able to get back. He wrapped an arm around the boy's shoulder. Peter was confused, but relaxed against him anyway, hugging him back. Whatever this was, it was important to Tony, so he would hug him back.
"I know," he said, rubbing his forehead. "I don't know yet." He was supposed to be on the board of judges for the fair. Peter had begged him to do it and he'd finally agreed. He didn't want to let him down now.
"You'd watch it without me?" a voice asked. Peter walked over and sat down next them. His eyes were a little red and he'd obviously been crying from a nightmare. Tony wrapped his free arm around his other son.
"I'm scared," he whispered.
As Tony slowly came to, he felt a little groggy and was taken back to years ago when he used to wake up with a hangover, but he wasn't hungover now. He had been drugged and taken somewhere by Steve. Steve. He loved him, but had no idea what to do about him. They wanted him to join them, but everyone else wanted him to defeat Steve and the others. He didn't know what to do.
He had a week. He would figure it out later. For now, he was going to spend time with Harley and Peter.
"He's right. We'll be here. Go to bed." He sighed and closed his eyes, asleep almost within minutes. Harley walked around the bed to stand beside his father. He hugged him around the waist, burying his face in the older man's shoulder, who turned back to him, wrapping his arms around the kid's shoulders. He pressed a kiss to the top of his head.
Slowly, the man walked over to the desk and looked at the package. Not much mail actually came to him. When it first was sent to him, he had someone that went through it. Then, it was sent to the secretary. Then, he got whatever she deemed was okay. Which led to this.
Tony landed near the building the boys were in and ran inside, finding them in the open area. He was instantly at their side, his suit falling away from him, so he could better assess the boy's injuries. Harley sat silently and watched as Tony looked over the welt on Peter's neck that was forming where the dart had hit him and the blood that was starting to pool from his side, along with assessing his arm that was definitely broken, maybe shattered.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Fine," he said. "But we're going with you."
"I gave Rogers a chance to convince you. Obviously, he hasn't or you would've called me by now or at least hacked into the system. He's telling you the truth. We need to get rid of SHIELD and build it back up. And we'll need your help. I'm giving you a week to think about it and decide which side you're on. I suggest you pick the right side. You wouldn't want your boys caught up in this." The phone went dead.
"I'll get the med bay ready." The hologram disappeared.
Tony knew the package had come from Steve. Steve-the man who had been done with all the crap SHIELD threw at them and took over Hydra. He was the bad guy now and Tony was expected to find him and fight him. He still loved the super soldier and was terrified for the day that would come when they would meet again, one opposite sides, and have to fight one another. It hurt his heart just to think about it. He could never hurt him.
"Harley, press the extra button on your watch. It'll send a location to my suit." Tony pressed a button his own watch, which called his own suit to him. The others wondered at that moment why he hadn't done it yet. Maybe he did still care about them. Maybe there was still time to get to him.
I am doing a sort of cleanse. And I need to work on my actual book more. For a month, I will not do anything related to fanfiction stuff. It'll probably help with school starting soon too. Sorry this wasn't an actual update. So, I'll see you in September.
"Go to sleep, Peter," he told him. "We'll be here when you wake up." The younger boy looked back at Tony. The man smiled reassuringly and ran a gentle hand through his hair, leaning down to press a kiss to his forehead.
"Harles," he murmured, moving to sit next to him. He rubbed his back soothingly, murmuring gentle reassurances and pressing kisses to the boy's head to help him calm down. It took a little while, but he finally stopped crying and his breathing evened out.
"You look beautiful." Tony looked up to see Steve standing there, smiling back at him. The engineer wasn't exactly happy to see him.
Steve gives Tony the details of where they want to meet. Tony's not so sure about it.
Tony sighed and leaned back against the couch, looking at the picture of him and Steve. Steve didn't know about Peter. No one did, except for Happy. He was the only one left, other than Pepper.
"You have one five hundred and eight new emails. There's a package on your desk. You have another meeting at three." He nodded and closed the door before she could say anything else, sighing heavily. The package on his desk stuck out, the brown packaging sticking out on the red and gold desk. Clint and Sam had decided to paint it for fun.
The jet landed and Harley and Tony were the first ones out, hurrying quickly inside and upstairs to the med bay. They didn't go in, though, waiting outside as Cho worked with a few other doctors. Pepper showed up later, eyeing the former Avengers before she stepped up next to Tony, looking into the hospital room. She glanced back at the father and son to see the tears on Harley's cheeks and the worried look deeply etched into Tony's face. That's when she noticed why he looked so different.
This wasn't going to end well.
Tony wasn't sure what was going to happen now. Were they going to take him back? Would they leave him there? Would they leave at all? He had no idea. But for now, he was going to hold Harley close and be happy that he could do that. They would figure everything out later. Together.
"Harley," he responded. "I was supposed to pick you up this morning, wasn't I?" There was a short pause and muffled talking in the background.
"Yeah, well, I thought about not coming." He'd seriously considered just staying with Peter, making sure the boy was safe and okay, but he knew he should come and talk to Steve. He was worried about him, anyway, and about all the others. He wanted to make sure they were all okay and alive. He was worried.
Sorry this one is short, but here you go.
"It's a long story. I'll explain later. We need to get you back."
The next few minutes went by agonizingly slow as Tony's suit showed up and he left, the others following behind in a jet. And then, everything was racing by and everything else was a blur.
Tony pulled his son into his arms, holding him close as he sobbed. It hurt him that he was in so much pain over this, but he knew it had been troubling. He'd been there when Peter had gotten shot. There would probably be many nightmares in the following nights and even days to come. For both of the boys.
"Yeah, but Happy picked me up. Peter told me you were busy. Anyway, Pepper says you're going to be late on your blueprints if you're not back by tonight. She was pretty sure you would be gone for awhile after you left, though. Peter said it seemed like you were leaving for awhile too."  Tony closed his eyes again, turning his head down.
Tony sighed as he sat back, looking at the machine he was working on. Peter had just gotten out of the med bay a few hours earlier and was fast asleep up on his room, along with Harley, so there was no reason he should be worried, yet he was. That's why he was working so late in his lab. He was trying to keep his mind off of the boys, while also trying to think over what happened with Steve and the others.
"Dad?" he asked, groggily. The man smiled back at him, hoping to reassure him a bit after he winced from the pain in his side. "What's going on?"
The super soldier walked into the cell and sat down in the chair that was sitting beside the nightstand that was beside the bed. They were both silent and Tony was sure the man was staring at him, but he was just looking back at the wall, rejecting even the thought to look at him.
"Peter got hurt on patrol. Someone anonymous texted him a location and a picture of some people who were hurt, so he went, but I didn't let him go alone. We got all the people out, but the person was waiting for us. He shot Peter after shooting him with something in a dart. I think his powers aren't working. He'd gonna die, isn't he?"  Tony looked back at Steve. The man sighed.
"We can talk about it later. Besides, that was mostly my fault for being stubborn. You know how I get." She rolled her eyes, looking back at the hospital. "He should be fine," he told her. "When he has his powers back, he'll be healed in a few hours." The woman looked back at him, a question in her gaze. "Whoever it was gave him something to block his powers."
Soon, the doctors all left and Harley came in, standing beside the bed. He took his brother's hand, squeezing it gently. Peter looked over and smiled sleepily at him. Harley smiled back.
"Yeah, I'm kind of busy with something, Harles. Peter knows what the blueprints are for. Why don't you two finish them? It'll be good practice for your projects."
"I'm not sure yet." He really didn't know if they were just going to leave him there until he complied or if they wanted to do something else. He hated that they had taken him away from the two boys. He needed to be there for them in case something happened. What if Peter called him in the middle of his patrol and was bleeding to death or something? He could die.
“Glad you found the place,” Mr Barton said with a wide grin as he swung the heavy gate open to let him through. “Worried you might fly too far, end up two farms over.”
Stíofán pulled a log free to reveal the kids underneath and breathed a sigh of relief as he realised the way the wood had fallen had boxed them in and stopped them being crushed. “Thank fuck.”
But that plan was dashed now, for he was nowhere to be seen. Odd, he was usually punctual.
Steve gave him a little salute and a dopey smile before he jogged back towards the hotel and the guys in suits. “Take me home, Happy.”
“Tony.”
Jan laughed. “How far off are you from just building a robot cat?”
Feeling awkward, Steve tried to backtrack. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to pry…”
Tony cradled the puppy carefully. He was adorable, all eyes and big paws, and he was looking up at Tony with a curious expression. He’d never had a pet before. His parents hadn’t wanted the trouble or the mess. Now he had a companion of his very own.
“He’s pinned beneath part of the cart, if we just try to pry it off, the whole thing could collapse. I’m going to use a horse and pulley over that beam to hold it steady and then disconnect parts of it so we can pull him free without shifting the weight of the load on the back. If we try to remove the load, the whole cart could collapse.”
Tony burst out laughing, waving a hand at him. “Jesus, don’t hurt yourself. It’s fine, I get what  you mean. It’ll be nice to see you again too.”
“I’m trying, Tony. Most of them only want it if they can charge an absurd amount for the appearance which we just don’t have in the budget, but I do have a nice lead on a three legged cat that saved an old person from drowning. I’ll do what I can, I promise, I’m calling in every favour I’ve got.”
He dismounted, setting down the stand and grabbing his kit off the back. He tried the usual fixes, adjusted a few things, but each time he tried the starter, the engine failed to catch.
“Welcome to
They sat down at the back, at a table tucked in the corner, Tony waving to the waitress. She took their orders, her disposition pleasant and bubbly, and eventually brought them coffee and sandwiches. Steve’s stomach grumbled. He hadn’t realised how long it had been since he’d eaten. He tucked into the food gratefully, watching Tony as he explained the cafe, pointing to a few of the cats that were apparently regulars. The way his eyes lit up, the tilt of his head, he reminded Steve of someone, he just couldn’t place it.
“I didn’t do anything! He was standing there and then he was on the ground,” Tiberius hissed frantically.
The ship rose in the air, carrying Steve with it, clinging to the rope with visible effort. Because of course he was there. He was always there, and if anything went wrong he was always going to be the first to step in and help because he was a stupid brave idiot. Dammit. Steve swang with the wind, and with each movement Tony felt panicked nausea rise his throat.
So why did doing the right thing hurt so much?
Tony huffed. “You’ve been acting strange -- strange for you at least. Did something happen?” He leaned in, lowering his voice. “Have you been dreaming about the cryo-chamber again? I told you, you should speak to the ship therapist--”
She pointed and Tony saw a tall, blond hottie, who definitely looked like he knew his way around a gym just as well as a paintbrush. He was wearing a nice suit - cheap though, Tony could tell - and clinging to a napkin of hors d'oeuvres like his life depended on it. Seemed like he enjoyed networking just as much as Tony did.
Stíofán leaned down to kiss him. “We have. You will have all the luxuries I can give you, I will wait on you hand and hoof. You shall want for nothing.”
He could've made it shorter, but he decided to take his time, stopping often along the way. He spent the night in Yosemite, walking the trails during the day and staring up at the Sequoias, feeling a sense of awe. The trees were older than him, by more than a hundred times over. They had come the long way around, seeing the world change around them with each passing year. All gathered together, the crawl of time nothing to them.
It was a Facebook post with the caption
“He’d love to!” Sam’s voice behind him said, a hand clapping down on his shoulder. Tony looked at him, betrayed, even as Steve grinned wide.
If Tony melted anymore he’d be a puddle. The man was so cute. He had the urge to maybe cuddle up, see if those arms looked as warm and safe as they seemed. But instead, he just gave Steve a smile and asked about the fair.
He would just relax for now. He had his boys with him. Everything was going to be just fine in the end.
"We need to talk," the other man repeated. "I know you won't let anyone get in trouble, so you'll come alone. I'll text you the details tomorrow night. I love you." Tony closed his eyes tightly, the tears slipping now. He loved him too, but wasn't sure if he should really say it. Thankfully, Steve spoke up again. "I know," he said. "I'll see you soon." The line went dead. Tony set the phone down on his desk and sat down on the opposite couch, his head in his hands. A sob wracked his body.
"No. I had a feeling you'd be joining us."
"You don't need to be. We're gonna be talking to you the whole time. We can even use a hologram, so you can see us. We'll be there only about five minutes after you, okay?" He nodded. "Harley." Together, the two of them helped get the suit on around Peter. Before putting the helmet on, Tony pressed a kiss to his forehead. "It's going to be okay." He nodded and then they slipped the helmet on. "Friday, take the suit back to the compound. Into the med bay." There was an affirmative and then the suit took off. Tony turned on a hologram and Peter's face showed up in the dark.
Things were going badly.
"Okay, sure. But when are you going to be back? Pepper won't let us finish your blueprints forever."
He couldn't take this. First, they had the fight with Ultron. Then, Steve left to take over Hydra with his old presumed dead friend. And now, he wants to talk to Tony. He couldn't take this stress.
"What are they doing here?" Tony sighed, hoping they had stayed in the jet. It was going  to be a very difficult story to tell before Peter probably even talked to any of them. Or stopped glaring at them for taking his father.
"Yeah," Tony replied. "It's probably not important, but I should take it anyway. You know Fury." They both nodded in agreement to that. The director was kind of crazy sometimes. Tony stood up and walked into the other room, answering the phone. He didn't even have to answer before the other man started talking.
Of course, there would be nightmares from the experience they had. And, of course, Tony would be there to help them.
"Yeah. We're coming." He and Tony stood up together and walked outside with the others, getting into the jet. They sat down on the ground away from everyone, talking to Peter until he got back to the tower. Then, they let Cho take over and turned the hologram off. And that's when Harley broke down, having lost all adrenaline keeping him going. His father was beside him, his brother was at the hospital. He was going to be okay. So, he cried.
"I thought you were coming alone," he said, even though he was starting to see black dots, leaning heavily against the tree now. Steve stepped up to him, leaning down to press a kiss to his lips. He gently caressed the side of his face, looking back at him. And Tony just looked back even as his vision started to fade.
"Tony," Natasha spoke up, walking into the hallway with the others. "Harley called." He looked up at that as she put the phone on speaker, telling the boy that the engineer could hear him.
"Really?" she asked. "That's not good. A scientist found that out. He could sell it to others." He took a deep breath, giving her a look.
Breakfast had already been made by the time they got Harley up and went into the kitchen. Tony suspected Steve had made it. Peter and Harley apparently didn't even think about it because they just started eating. The engineer didn't worry too much. Friday would've told him if there was poison in it or anything. And he still didn't think Steve would do that.
"Tony." He had to cover his mouth to keep in the sob that caught in his throat. "I'm glad you answered. We need to talk. In person. Alone."
Tony had been sitting in his cell for a week now. He'd only eaten enough to keep him alive, plus a little, but he wasn't going to act like he should be there. He was a prisoner, whether they wanted to admit it or not. So, he acted like a prisoner. He didn't talk to anyone that tried to talk to him and he kept his eyes attached to the wall, refusing to look at anyone that walked past. Eventually, Steve showed up.
Steve finally decides to have a private conversation with Tony. It doesn't go too well.
And he was gone. And Tony was alone. Always alone.
With those thoughts, the phone rang. The engineer looked back at it, holding it in his hand. Should he really pick it up? Maybe Steve would reveal something about his location. It would be best for all of them. He flipped the phone open, pressed the accept button, and put the phone to his hear. He was met with deep breathing and had to close his eyes. It was definitely Steve.
"It was a traumatic experience, Peter. Nightmares are expected. It's not wrong to have them. It's perfectly normal, alright? There's nothing wrong with you." The young man nodded, looking away. He felt embarrassed that Tony knew that he was thinking what he was thinking. "Peter." He slowly met the older man's eyes. "How about we talk about this tomorrow, hmm? Tonight, we can just watch Star Wars, alright?" He nodded and curled into his father's side, getting comfortable beside him.
"You're on your way?" he asked weakly. Harley nodded.
"You're not our prisoner, Tony. We had to bring you here to explain everything. You wouldn't have listened to just me. You would've just gone home and probably told SHIELD right away. I had to make sure you didn't tell them. It would ruin everything now. They think we're just targeting people right now, not them. I needed to listen."
"I'm sure, but you can't go to sleep yet. Harley's gonna keep talking to you to keep you awake." The boy immediately took over to talk to him. Tony pressed another button on his watch and a hologram popped up, something else the others were confused they hadn't seen when he was stuck in that cell. Dr. Cho popped up after a moment.
Tony had been at the Hydra base for two weeks now. He'd lost a bit of weight from not eating a lot-not enough for it to be concerning, but enough that you could start to see it. Steve tried to get him to eat more, but Tony just refused, barely looking at him and barely speaking to anyone. He wasn't going to live with this. Finally, something came up.
Thankfully, the others all left him alone. Steve was the last to go. And it hurt a little bit to see him go. He needed to just calm down and think for a little bit. Just for a few minutes, at least.
Tony drove a Prius to the park where Steve wanted to meet him. It was outside of the city, near the cemetery, and no one was around. There were no cameras, either, which made Tony anxious to get out of his car.
"Fury?" Harley asked, clearly confused as to why the man would be calling him. Steve had walked in then and looked at Tony. Fury was calling for him.
"Do you wanna talk about it?" Tony asked, causing Harley to let out a quiet breath, curling more into his father's chest.
"Harley, I need your jacket," he told the boy, who quickly took his jacket off, handing it to the man. He pressed it to the younger boy's abdomen as he checked his pulse. It was better than he was hoping for, which was good. "Peter," he called, squeezing the boy's hand. "Peter, can you hear me?" A quiet groan and the boy cracked his eyes open.
"Really?" he asked. Tony had known he was going to have a nightmare? How pathetic was that? Knowing that the boy had issues of self-deprivation, Tony looked back at him for a minute, hoping that he'd get his point across.
"Tony, come on. You need to stop this. You're going to starve yourself." He didn't even blink. "I care about you. I don't want you to do this to you." The engineer finally looked back at him.
"Any preferences?" Tony asked the younger man. He received a shake of the head in return. "Alright. Fri, turn on the first Star Wars movie, please."
"Hey," the man greeted, brushing his thumb along the boy's cheekbone. "Hey. I'm right here. I'm here. You're gonna be alright." The enhanced teenager locked eyes with him. Tony knew he was going to ask a hard question then. Whatever it was, he wasn't sure he'd be able to answer.
"This is for the best," Steve told him. "You'll see soon enough." Tony couldn't let this happen. He couldn't leave Peter like this, but he had no choice. His vision faded all the way to black as he heard Steve say one more sentence. "I love you."
"No, Peter. I was stubborn. I wanted to come back. I hoped they'd let me back if I didn't eat very much. It was stupid, I know. And it didn't work anyway, but I'm here now. With you. I'll tell you all about it later, but we're okay now." The boy nodded. They were going to be okay.
"Where have you been?" she asked. "You've lost more weight than you should if you were just on vacation or going to stay somewhere." Harley looked back then, realizing she was right. Tony sighed.
"Tony?" The man closed his eyes for a moment.
-Steve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When lunch rolled around, they made sandwiches, got some chips from the cabinets, and went back in to finish their marathon. They were all very happy to be with each other and were all in good moods. That is, until Fury called.
Tony glanced back into the living room to where Harley and Peter were sitting, laughing together about something that one of them had said.
After a moment of contemplation with his eyes closed, he opened his eyes to a stone ceiling. He was on a surprisingly soft bed for the material the room was made of. He sat up and fount that he was in a cell. There was a cell, a bathroom with a door and bars covering a whole wall.
And he got plenty of time to think. Natasha brought him some food throughout the day, but didn't say anything, leaving the room silently. And Tony didn't eat anything she brought him. He didn't want it. He wasn't hungry. He wanted to go home and see Peter and Harley and just know that they were okay.
Tony was surprised to find Steve, Natasha, and Bucky still awake, talking quietly in the living room. He decidedly ignored them in favor of focusing on Harley. They walked over to the couch and sat down away from the other three.
They kidnapped Tony. Now, they have to explain everything. It doesn't mean Tony has to like it.
"Peter, I need to talk to you." The boy looked up at Tony from where he was sitting in his room at the compound. "I'm going somewhere tonight. I don't know when I'll be back. Pepper and Happy will be around. You can try and call me, but I might be unable to answer."
"M'tired."
The engineer sat in the car for a moment before opening the door and stepping out. He closed the door behind him and walked over to the big oak tree in the middle of the park. And that's where he waited for about five minutes, thinking about how he had gotten himself there. And that's when a pair of footsteps approached him. He looked up to meet Steve's gaze.
"Don't you dare." After a few more seconds, he turned and walked back over to the bed, sitting down on it. He sighed, putting his head in his hands. He could sense that the soldier was going to speak to him, so he said something first. "Just leave me alone, Steve." He needed to think about all of this. He needed time to think this over. What if they were wrong? What if something or someone had done something to brainwash them or something? He needed to be alone.
This was crazy. Was he really going to go to Steve? He couldn't. Yet he couldn't stop himself from checking his phone every five minutes.
After breakfast, Tony, Harley, and Peter went back into the living room and started back onto the last movie that they remembered before they'd fallen asleep.
"Okay," he said gently, resting his chin on the top of the boy's head. "Do you think you can go back to sleep?" He shook his head. "Okay. Well, why don't we go downstairs and turn on a movie or something?" The boy sniffed and nodded, moving to wipe at his eyes before they got up and walked down to the living room.
Just as Tony feared, something happened to the kids while he was gone. Will the others let him leave to help?
"Let's get into the jet," Steve said. Tony shook his head, looking down at Peter. He needed to be there as soon as possible. The jet would take twice as long.
Tony pulled the tape off of the box and opened it up, taking out another box that was inside of it. And inside the box was a phone, a note, and black licorice-Tony and Steve's favorite candy. They'd shared at least that, along with a few other things. It was a miracle their relationship lasted.
The next morning, Tony woke up on the couch in the living room with Harley and Peter on either side of him. There was a blanket laying over them that hadn't been on them when they'd fallen asleep the night before. Tony knew Steve had put it on them. He wasn't sure if he should be letting them stay there or not. Steve had kidnapped him and taken him to Hydra, but he'd never hurt him and had even tried to take well enough care of him when he'd taken him. Maybe he was really telling the truth and SHIELD was really the one that was corrupt. He would still need to look into that more.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
They're going to make you fight me, aren't they? Can't see you that this is wrong? I really hope that we'll be together soon. Don't be afraid of me. I just want to help you. These people have hurt you so much. You deserve to be loved and taken care of. The phone I'll use to call you can't be tracked. Take care of yourself until I can. I do this for a good reason. I love you.
"Mr. Stark?" Peter asked quietly, causing the man to look back at him. He looked away as soon as the older man's eyes met his. "My dream last night wasn't about getting shot," he whispered, causing Tony to sit up a little more, turning towards him. Peter played with his fingers, not looking at his mentor. "It was about May." He finally looked back at him, tears in his eyes. "I could've saved her."
Announcement
He just hoped this would all end well.
"Did they try and starve you when they took you?" The older man sighed. Peter had been afraid for him this whole time. This kid was the epitome of pure.
Tony sat down with the two boys at the counter and ate as they talked a little bit with each other, mostly ignoring everyone else who sat in the kitchen. Tony just wanted to spend the rest of the weekend with the boys. After that, he could deal with everything else. But at that moment, he would only focus on the two boys that sat beside him. His sons.
"Tony?" he sounded distraught. Without even thinking, Tony was next to the bars, grabbing the phone from Natasha.
"Why did you bring me here?" The soldier looked back at him intently for a moment, seeming to study his whole face, his smile warming a bit as he looked at the man he loved. Tony wasn't sure about all of this. Steve had kind of kidnapped him and taken him hostage probably until he agreed fully with what they were doing and there was no chance of him leaving.
"Okay. Well, Pepper says it's time for lunch and we better get down there. Be safe. Neither of us want to lose another parent."
"I love you too, Dad." Usually, Peter called him Tony and still Mr. Stark, but when it was important, he called him dad. And he could sense that it was very important now. Tony wasn't usually this affectionate. After a moment, he pulled away.
"Tony?" a nurse asked, opening the door out to them. "He wants you." The engineer looked back at Harley.
"SHIELD is corrupt," Natasha spoke first. "Ross has been poisoning them for years now. Fury, Maria, and Phil are the only agents left that are still good. The others are poisoning them from within, which in turn, is hurting everyone else. We're here to stop that. We're still fighting SHIELD, but we're on opposite sides now." SHIELD was corrupt. Tony wasn't sure how he felt about that. Did he believe that? He wasn't so sure. What if they were just trying to get them on their side?
Peter didn’t want to leave, not when he was finally having fun. The kids around him booed and groaned when Harry suggested they leave, and that made Peter smile to know that these people care if you would leave. He was cool finally, even if it was only because he was drinking os much without completely blacking out. He didn’t want to leave yet. "Just a few more drinks! Harry, don't you want to have fun with me too?”
"Yeah...I still don't really trust that kid. I don't like Peter talking to him."
They were sitting at the kitchen table, getting breakfast ready in a comfortable silence when Tony finally joined them. It was normal for them now. Peter was just done setting the table as Steve placed food on the plates when Tony walked out, just like every morning.
Peter flopped backwards on his bed with a loud groan. This was going to be a lot harder than he thought.
Getting arrested would definitely ruin their cover.
however you felt. You're allowed to be something other than happy-go-lucky all the time."
“Oh, yes,
“Same thing with Evalyn, huh?”
"Kinda boring, don't you think?" Tony walked closer to the pool where Steve was lounged.
“Yeah…”
Tony said, pulling on a shirt.
Steve laughed. "Please, Miss Parker, I get that enough from your son. Steve is fine."
"Let's be a little easy on him, yeah?" Steve said as he pulled on a pair of sneakers.
Steve set his towel on a chair and sat on a bench in the pool against the wall so he could be submerged but still sit and relax without swimming. One of Peter's pool floats was roaming the pool, but Steve didn't like balancing in that thing. He usually ended up flipping over.
"I'd say how precious, but I doubt you think so when you have to wake up with him." Steve chuckled.
"Edwin, is that you?"
"My husband is Thomas," she said. "And this is little Thomas Jr." She gestured to the covered stroller.
“I’m sorry, what?”
Maybe this movie wouldn't be so bad after all.
Thank you to sha for the suggestions for steve's music!!
Steve and not Captain Rogers. Interesting.
He could just barely hear Harry talking to someone...his dad, he said? But his dad was dead...years ago. Maybe he thought Mr. Stark was his dad? Peter chuckled a little at that idea. He would make a good dad.
Flashbacks of Joseph Rogers, 6’ tall and 200lbs, raising his hand to smack Steve across the face came crashing to his mind. His hand was so big, it was like a punch to the face that threw him to the ground. The worst Steve had ever done was tell him to leave his mother alone, but he was always
"Neither is locking a child in a room without parental supervision or permission." Steve shoved past him and stormed into the small office. Tony followed after Klaus through a small open room into a room shut behind a closed door.
Peter made a small sound of discomfort too as Steve fixed him in his arms. Then he hushed him softly. "Shh, I've got you, bud. Go back to sleep."
Their bedrooms were too close to joke about that because Peter would probably be able to hear it, and then he’d have to bleach his ears and his brain and never look either of them in the eyes again.
He stormed after Steve, following him into the house and slammed the door closed.
“You don’t have a choice in that, little guy.” Steve kept his voice gentle as he carried Peter back from the way they came.
"So," Tony said, changing the topic of conversation. "What was this little concert for?"
“It’s fine,” Peter said. “I’ll see you later--.”
Tony was the only person he ever wanted to make love to, and he had been hoping that Tony felt the same way. Apparently, that wasn’t the case.
Peter wasn't supposed to confuse Steve and Tony for his actual parents when waking up, but he took over when I was writing and wanted it. I thought it was sweet but angsty so I let him keep it in the story.
The rest of the people around them immediately started gagging and yelling at him. So much for being normal and cool. Peter felt like shit, and it wasn’t just because of the alcohol. Despite everyone else leaving to get away from the vomit, Harry stayed to rub his back as he started retching again. God how much did his stomach hold?
“I wanted to see if you were gay or, uh, into that?” Harry said, sounding like it was ending in more of a question.
Peter froze. “Really?”
Tony and Steve both jumped apart as the record changed to the next song. Tony's heart was racing as he looked over to where Peter was watching them from the doorway.
Tony sighed as he ran a hand over his face, noticing the lack of facial hair again. "I don't get paid enough for this."
Steve turned around and narrowed his eyes. “
"I'll start making lunch while you two set it up?" Steve offered as a question, waiting for Tony to nod his head in agreement before heading to the kitchen.
With a sigh, Tony said, “I know, kid. He’s stubborn. Don’t worry.”
“But he’s living in the same house. He’s married to my dad, who is in a great relationship with his husband. Why would we not get along?” Peter asked.
Steve's eyes fluttered shut as Tony cupped the back of his head, threading his fingers through his hair. God, this was perfect. Steve just wanted to arch his hips ever so slightly and get some pleasure. Tony would be eager to give it--the man had straddled him naked.
"May I be excused?" Harry asked before Tony could reply, as he stared down at his full plate.
"I'm sorry, what?" Tony's eyes widened.
"Hmm?" He mumbled, not ready to be awake yet.
They were all having such a good time...and they all had a red solo cup in hand.
"He never left the premises with that ugly thing, so you have no case. Let him go or else I will," Steve warned.
"As ready as ever, Underroos."
Steve narrowed his eyes for a long moment before he turned around and headed back for the front door.
the bad ones. Why? Because we’re
I know I promised this fic would be friendly for both sides, so I hope that argument felt fair, even if Steve let a little more out. He's been keeping a lot down, guys.
show you how to dance." So, what if he was just finding another reason to be close to Steve? Anybody in his situation would.
Peter couldn’t help but laugh suddenly. Steve had it bad. He had it
“Oh, come on! How old are you, kid?”
"How about this...I'll make the call here, and after we're done, we'll put your music on, and
She was supposed to be
Tony threw the t-shirt to a chair behind him and before he was looking at Steve again, Steve tore his eyes away from staring. Then his hands went to the strings on his pants and he started to untie them.
There was a sound of feet scurrying down the hall before Peter and Harry were right there. Peter’s face was flushed, and Harry looked nervous too. He wondered if they heard the fighting from where they were both hiding.
"He said my face was stupid."
“Save it, Rogers.” Tony held his hand up. “I’m gonna help the kid settle in the guest room. Find your way to the couch tonight.”
He ran for over an hour, though he couldn’t keep up with his normal time because he was trying to blend in. He usually would have done close to 30 miles in the time, but that morning he only ran a little over 6.
After he pulled the sweatpants back on, he pulled out his phone from the pocket and picked up. He sounded a little frustrated, understandably so, when he snapped, "Hello?"
“This is your room.” Tony’s voice was still tense from speaking to Steve. “There’s a bathroom right next door. My bedroom is across the hall if you need anything.”
"You think someone's watching?"
“No,” Harry repeated, his voice firmer this time.
For a few hours, they would just forget everything and be together. It would all work out in the end, Tony was sure, but it was nice to take a break in the middle of everything.
Tony blinked back tears that threatened to fall. The night the soldier left had been horrible. He'd given Tony a serum that paralyzed him, so he couldn't stop him. Then, he'd said a few words, kissed him goodbye, and was gone. Tony couldn't move until morning and by then, he was long gone.
Sighing, the billionaire opened the letter and took it out of the envelop, unfolding it to read over it.
"I really wish you'd just be on our side and see, Tony. This is really important. SHIELD is corrupt. We have to get rid of them before they take over the whole world because they will. Just consider it, won't you?" He stood up and walked over to him, leaning down to press a kiss to his forehead. Tony moved, so it ended up just on his cheek. Steve sighed. "I'll be back later."
"He needs you. Go. I'll be fine." He pressed a kiss to the boy's temple before following the nurse inside and over to Peter, standing near the boy's head. Peter opened his eyes to look up at his father.
"Pfft. Don't get all shy now. Don't think I don't know how filthy your mouth is, Rogers."
“You trust them? Van Dyne and Lang?” Tony looked dubiously at the messenger bag that had clearly seen better days and was now held together by patches and pins.
Scott piped up. “I have an idea -- I just need wire, vibranium, and something to project sound.”
“You didn’t know?” Steve asked. “I am confused.”
Tony blinks. This is all going a little fast. “What?”
“Lord Stark?” Rogers asked, catching Tony looking at his watch.
"I'm sorry." Tony says again because he is. And he feels bad. But also slightly disappointed in himself because who turns down an opportunity like this? Him. He's so gone for Sheriff Steve Rogers that he can't even have sex with his counterpart because even if they're not together, he feels like he's betraying the man. Even if said man doesn't care. And there's not even any hope of them getting together. God, he's so messed up.
"It's okay, Steve," Tony reassures him. He's a bad person for feeling happy that Steve's somewhat worried about him. "They're helping me get home."
Somehow Steve Rogers seemed less legendary and a normal mortal when he was just a guy who slipped on his ass in the rain. In the dim light of the cabin, his eyes sparkled as he talked in a way that got under Tony’s skin.
“Tea,” Rogers replied.
Tony sold off his family’s home, fought like hell to remove and exile Stane, and went to New Timely to start all over again.
Tony was not particularly happy with his camp bed mattress. Not that he should complain -- he’d tried Bruce’s and he had no idea how Bruce was even functioning after sleeping on that thin cardboard. Bruce insisted that it was his choice. But Tony had tried out mattresses before he ordered his and he had to do something about the frame that was poking through.
“A disguise, maybe a hat and glasses --” Tony suggested.
Tony's mouth opens and closes in an attempt to say something but he finally settles on, "I don't want to be rude but I need to hear the whole story."
Redwing was eyeing his new boots as a possible food source. Tony took a step backwards. “No, I need to work on the inventory.” He turned heel and left.
“When did we have to put into place rules about that?”
Natasha added, “And Stark Industries motors and steam engines.”
Steve continued. “I value group cohesion and it’s important for us to work together. We’ll need to trust and have each other’s back in the Savage Land. If you have doubts about the expedition, arrangements can be made in Port City --”
They went through twisty paths through alleyways filled with crates and trash and warehouses which grew more dilapidated and rundown as they moved away from the main port areas. Miss Maximoff fit more into the setting, her clothes and odd manners a piece with the people they saw.
“Gatling guns?”
Steve nodded grimly. This felt like that war all over again, with the same players and the same missions. He didn’t want to dwell on the dark thoughts he’d had on the trip. That he’d fought that war for nothing.
“Mhm?”
I love how this turned out, it's not perfect but I'm very happy with it and am proud of it :)
“I’m willing to take that risk.”
Sam found Steve the next morning sitting at the kitchen table with the baby Aquilops on his lap. The dinosaur peeped at Sam when he came through the door. Steve had a dish of mixed vegetables on the table and was feeding half of a brussel sprout to the dinosaur.
“I would like that, Mr. Stark, um, Tony.”
“Smugglers.”
“Wouldn’t put it past him. He knows all sorts of obscure stuff.”
"I did not steal this armor! I made it myself!" Tony protests, indignant. All eyes turn towards him and he relents, slowly raising his hands to his head, "Don't shoot. I'm taking off the helmet."
It takes three days of going back and forth to the Baxter Building to find the right frequency and open a portal to the right universe. Tony has to be next to the portal fragments attached to Reed's portal for it to work, so he and Stark practically invade the Fantastic Four's house and stay several hours a day for the process.
“Do you know someone?”
“No,” Tony said with a smile. “I already have ideas for a dinosaur playground.”
Tony nods, grateful. "Thanks."
Stark elbows him. "Tell him you miss him."
Rogers announced that the expedition would set sail to the Savage Land within the week. The non-scientific members would oversee the loading of the generous supplies donated by the king of Wakanda onto the ship hired by the Club as well as the other preparations for the trip.
“Is that what this is about?” Pepper asked.
Rhodey blushed.
She peered at the tuft of baby feathers poking out of Steve’s unbuttoned jacket. “I have to. Please call me Wanda. It’s nicer that way.”
“Then I hope this expedition is everything you want.”
“I can anticipate that Captain Rogers will be the expedition leader?” Pym asked.
“Maybe. What about Lang?”
The coffee machine was something else though, a little miracle of gears and steam, a proud gift from its creator, Lord Stark. Steve had been completely unprepared when Stark made a show of revealing his gift at a luncheon at the New Explorers’ Club. He had not been at his best that day, being on edge all day since he woke up. Somehow, Steve thought he had escaped the performing monkey circuit when he fell into the void. But there he was, being shown off like one of the new exhibits at the Club. Then Stark threw the machine at Steve, clearly expecting Steve to be deeply enthralled and enthused.
“Tony sure knows how to throw a party,” Clint said as they arrived at the restaurant, filled with music and all kinds of food laid out on serving tables.
“We would be glad to have her along, your majesty,” Rogers agreed.
(can I do two bingos on the same card, btw?)
“You can take your boots off,” Tony suggested as he ushered Rogers to the armchair next to the radiator.
"Friend Tony!” a large booming voice comes out of nowhere. “It is nice to finally meet your counterpart. I am Thor Odinson, God of Thunder!"
Bruce said, “No, by the time I was hired, the semester had started and the department didn’t have lab space. So putting off the job until next fall won’t hurt anyone. Plus I expect to get a few papers out of this trip.” He had a notebook full of equations, drawing and snippets of writing set out on his knee.
originally i was gonna have tony saying ‘that’s a lot of snow…’ but decided to cut it ^^
Rogers rubbed a hand over his face as he pondered. “I can ask Sam to put that story out.”
"Let's not." Steve let out a laugh. But he turns serious again when he meets Tony's eyes. "I thought I lost you. And I never got to tell you how much you mean to me."
“You can say that again.”
Rogers replied, “T’Challa is supporting the expedition through a large donation and will be providing supplies when we go to Wakanda. He wasn’t keen on any Wakandans on the trip and neither was Fury. For now. That might change.”
and another of the art pieces on Tony's wall, art of Iron Man:
They took a cab to the theatre so they would not be late. Rhodey didn’t support Tony’s fashionably late tendencies. Tony opted for coddling his best friend’s insistence on being on time for everything.
"Do not joke about that!" Clint protests. "One of them will sell their soul to get the other one back and then we'd be in trouble."
“No one. I’ve been working on this promotion and it’s at a delicate point -- so, no, I can’t go traipsing off through the jungle right now. No matter how fun it sounds.”
Rogers answered a few questions from the audience. He said in conclusion, “Thank you for a wonderful evening. And remember, we as members of the New Explorers’ Club have a duty to protect the wonderful plants and animals of our world, to stop their exploitation and save their native environments.” He nodded and bowed during the audience’s thunderous applause.

"Oh Danny Boy… I love you so--"
Tony can hear fighting in the background. "The scientist in charge is Doctor Killian. Probably AIM's Aldrich Killian. They should've picked a totally different name if they wanted to hide behind a dummy corporation. No creativity at all."
While Rhodey inquired about the book he had seen in the window, Tony noticed that they had escaped in the nick of time as the dogs’ owner got into a heated argument with the girl’s father. Someone flagged down a policeman to intervene. Another person was holding tightly on the now revived dino’s leash.
“How can we do that?”
“That’s why you didn’t go to the police?” Steve asked.
Steve smacks a hand on his forehead muttering, "Idiots." But when he sees the growing wonder on Tony's face, he turns hopeful eyes at him. "Well?"
Cap weaves and dodges the beams, throwing his shield at AIM agents, catches it, then slams it so hard on the side of the hoverchair the metal dents and caves inward. Tony breathes out. "That is so hot."
“No time,” Tony said.
Grabbing a drink, Tony waited with his friend. “You won’t believe who I ran into back there.”
Clint nodded in agreement. “Hexagons. On all the crates.”
Fanart of Mer!Tony peeking over the waves :3
She yawned and settled down at his feet to watch the people pass by like colorful butterflies. Steve had been asked about his cat-sized dinosaur and how people could get one of their own. He only shook his head and said that Redwing was one of a kind. Besides, their team dismantled the smuggling ring so there would be no more stealing wild dinosaurs for the pet trade.
“Fine. Tell Fury I’ll be there.”
“Okay, I guess you’ll be a city dinosaur again,” Steve said. “But that means wearing a collar and leash.”
“You have people doing security checks?” Tony asked Rogers.
Both of them turn towards Reed.
"Miss me, Sheriff?" Tony asks cheekily.
Everyone had moved on. The Great Zeppelin War was in the past, the dashing Captain Rogers a legend that all the school children read about.
"Put her through, J."
“I’d say about a day. Last time I was here, getting into the harbor was tricky. There’s a reason no one has settled this land.”
The moment they see his face, Clint pipes up, "Ew. What is up with that hippie mustache?"
Steve was ransacking all the supplies for any bit of rope he could find. “Tie the rope together.”
Comic-fanart of a scene in
At first, General Phillips and his aide, Peggy Carter, were convinced that they were fighting against a pure scientific effort and the latest technology the world could show off. Steve had enlisted as soon as he could. He’d been found peeling potatoes by one of Phillips’s top scientists, Dr. Erskine, who talked Steve into trying an experimental formula. Steve ended up stronger and faster than he’d ever been.
“That should be easy, since it’s Rogers. Interesting expedition to Atlantis -- I’ve been reading the Club’s announcement.”
T’Challa looked thoughtful and then nodded slowly. “I would approve. Though I would of course, limit your people’s access to our borders.”
Rogers hesitated. His eyes dropped to the side and then he turned back at his papers, struggling over something. He huffed finally and said, “Yes. Do you want anyone else?” He pushed the roster over to Tony.

Steve joins in their fight with MODOK. The rest of the team is still busy with the AIM crew in yellow beekeeper outfits.
“Indeed, I have a great interest in the success of the expedition.” He sipped from a glass. “I am sure that Director Fury relayed to you my concerns, in case you find anything.”

“I made inquiries back in Port City,” Natasha added. “Turned up some information. Nakia has some additional ideas.”
so tony is like wtf im wearing metal and takes off his shirt to see what’s with that, and then they’re both ??? about the chestplate for a bit. after they get their memories back steve is all !!!! oh my g-d you’re ironman!!!! and tony freaks out bc oops…
Timely is a busy place that attracts all sorts of travellers and ruffians and people passing through on their way to a much livelier city. It’s what led Tony to it in the first place, when he left New York to get far away from his old life of building weapons. He never lacked for work in Timely and what little free time he had, he put into his personal projects.
or maybe they’re normal sized but the boxes/crates are giant sized?
“Not through customs or banks, no taxes, paperwork, or questions. It’s just my brother Pietro and I now -- we’re just a means of getting things from one place to another and we are very small cogs in the machine.”
Rogers sighed. “Long story. Redwing, come here.”

"It was either this or a car battery. And the way they were drowning me everyday wasn't great for survivability while holding a car battery."
Wanda’s shoulders relaxed. “You haven’t let me down,” she said. “It takes time to find the real criminals. I can be patient.”
“So is this what you do back in New Timely?” Tony asked while he held stakes for Sam’s measurements.

“It’s been a week,” Steve replied.
Rogers appeared doubtful. “I’m not comfortable with anything less than the truth here.”

Steve grinned. “To ‘magic sucks.’”
He steps into the portal.
"I believe she is calling her friend, Sir." J says helpfully even as the other two hauler exoskeletons bound over to the woman's direction, looking up and seemingly yelling. "You have been spotted."
"Iron Man, report," Steve barks through the comms.
this one gave me a really, really hard time, but I like how it turned out :D
“In that case --”
Before dinner, Sam reported to Steve that Tony had been stewing in his tent all day, refusing to talk to anyone, even Dr. Banner. Tony didn’t even come out to join the others for dinner or for the evening entertainment.
Tony is in good hands, so he doesn't know why he's so nervous. He chalks it up to excitement. He hasn't seen his Steve in a week. It will be so good to see him again in person. Maybe Steve will squeeze his shoulder and pat him on the back.

“Good, I have a plan to stop Killian -- he’s the guy running AIM -- and the dinosaur smuggling and the AIM velociraptor army.”
"Council of Reeds?"
“Of course, here,” Rogers replied, handing her a ticket from his pocket as she took the cape from his hand.
"We can get that over to Reed for analysis. It could be the key to get you back home." Steve smiles at him. "Not that we don't enjoy having you here, but I'm sure you miss your team."
Steve noticed that Tony didn’t argue with that logic.
"We had a bet on how those two idiots would get together. It grew through the years as the team added new members. Bruce bet it would happen after getting separated due to some catastrophic event. He won almost a thousand dollars."
Art for square Y1 for bingo round 1
Tony had a lot of talents, both specific and broad. And one of those talents was noticing solid scientific ability.
“Look down there,” Steve said. “They’re marching overland with the dino army, not taking the water route.”
There was a rattle at the door.
Stark smiles and accepts Steve's kiss. Then grins at Tony. "Never let it be said that I do not share with myself."
This piece is from a part of the story where Steve is waiting in Bucky and Tony's dorm room for Bucky - who gave him a key- and Steve is looking at one of the artworks tony has on his wall (fanart of tony's stories). Iron man and Cap fly together over the city, with Stark Tower and Grand Central Station visible. (Stark Tower is in place of the MetLife building, grand central is the green square in front of it. and I added the empire state building, because it's visible from there)
“If it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t be at all close to uncovering whatever conspiracy is going on.”
Tony was also attempting to get along with Miss Van Dyne. She was charming, smart and clever and completely refused to answer any of Tony’s direct questions.
"We're married, what's wrong with me being naked?" He was still standing outside of the pool. Why didn't he at least get in the water?
Steve glanced over his shoulder and saw Tony was leaning against the doorway with a messy bedhead in sweats and a t-shirt. He looked away before his heart could fall anymore in love with the man. “Didn’t think using yours or Peter’s would be a good idea.”
"I'm gonna step on your feet," Steve said, sounding nervous.
“Rogers will go around the neighborhood while we’re shopping,” Tony said, standing up too. “Get dressed and meet me in the living room.”
Peter frowned. He didn’t want to never see Harry again. They had finally
He and Steve aren’t close like that. At least, Tony didn’t think so.
“I gotta--...don’t wanna.” Peter turned his face towards Harry. “Wanna stay.”
"You're gonna love it," Peter promised him. "Hugh Jackman alone. You don't get to just stare at him, but you can hear him too. It's just-- perfect."
“Oh! Uh, yeah, I was just, uh, looking around,” He muttered.
Maybe they still had a chance…
Peter pouted but stood up with a little sigh. “Alright...I’m gonna go to my room for a few minutes.”
"He does, especially if you invited him to swim. Gotta warn him so he doesn't come out." Tony was finally stepping into the pool, right by Steve. He was so close that when he sat down, Steve felt his hip brush against his.
Tony was quick to nod his head. Was he supposed to give up on the chance to spend more time with Steve? "Yeah. Sure. Sounds good."
Steve glanced at him from the corner of his eyes. Did he really have to say what was wrong? No. Because Tony knew
I'm too exhausted to reply to comments right now. I'm about to hit the hay after I post this, but I will reply to every comment on the previous chapter in the morning. Thank you again!!
Staying angry at them was easier now with their plan in action. Peter didn’t care if Evalyn was a horrible person; she didn’t deserve to be deceived. And Peter thought Steve liked Tony! Why would he sleep with her if he liked Tony? Was he lying? Was he trying to hurt Tony again?
In fact, Steve didn't know. He didn't know Peter existed, let alone that Tony was having lunch with him. He left the house that morning telling Steve he was
name. Was this not a cover for him? Was Tony actually doing this for
“I just have to be angry at him,” Tony said after a long moment of silence. Then he was storming away to the opposite side of the house that Steve had gone to. Peter sighed. This mission was going to be harder to complete than their actual finding Hydra and destroying them mission.
“Don’t play coy, Rogers.”
Steve pulled a throw blanket around them, and even though Tony was hot from the temperature and Steve's body heat, he didn't complain. "Are we about to Netflix and Chill?"
This car was in better shape than May’s car, so Peter didn’t see a problem with it. He just shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t think it’s bad.”
Maybe Peter had just always been super lucky with parents. Three out of three sets were perfect. Harry didn’t have that same luck with only his one parent.
There was something different this time though, and it made Steve do a double take. When Tony walked out into the kitchen that morning, he was wearing one of Steve’s t-shirts. It was just a bit too big on him, slipping off one of his shoulders and stopping by his thigh instead of his waist.
Steve frowned. He'd love to call Tony his babydoll, but he didn't want that to be an undercover name. It was too special to play pretend with. "Anyway, I had an idea for our jobs and to explain why we're always home--."
Steve glanced over to the love seat and hesitated before he walked over and sat down next to Peter, sandwiching him between the two of them.
The intro was long as Steve hummed along to the music. When the singer began to sing, it looked like Steve wanted to sing along. He stayed silent though.
"I mean, at least you don't have to wear a baseball hat and sunglasses when you're out to lunch now," Peter provided unhelpfully. They were sitting on the middle of a Manhattan sidewalk, eating lunch at the restaurant's outside seating, and Tony didn't even need to wear anything to hide himself from the public, but it wasn’t worth how he looked now.
Evalyn turned to Peter then and smiled. “Well, welcome to the neighborhood, dear. I’m quite sure you’ll enjoy it.”
The two of them practically tripped over each other trying to get out of the room. They stopped in the kitchen, and everyone was staring. Peter knew
"I'm sorry if he was rude. He knows better than that." It sounded like she was about to hang up and call Peter to give him an earful. That's not what Tony wanted.
He was cut off when Harry surged forward and pressed his lips against his, holding him tightly by his biceps. Peter’s eyes were wide open the entire time as Harry kissed him. Though Peter wasn’t sure if it could be considered a kiss when all they were doing was standing there with their lips touching. He was pretty sure at least
"We have to eat lunch."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s heart softened a little at that. Of course, Peter would use his uncle’s name when given the chance.
He needed the bedroom to himself for just a few hours while Peter was out of the house with Steve-- or maybe he just needed Peter out of the house like he was now with Steve right there, so close, and so kissable--
"Oh, so
"If my son wanted to wear makeup, I would not be embarrassed. I would take him to the store and let him pick out what he wanted. I'd set him up with a professional so he knew what to do and feel comfortable," Steve said matter of factly.
dancing. You know, the dancing you do when no one's watching."
They pulled up as far as they could into the woods before the trees became too thick. Then they stumbled out of the car and found themselves in the middle of a party. Steve blinked a few times, overwhelmed by the smell of alcohol and the loud music. He wondered how Peter was able to handle it all, especially while drunk.
“You got yourself into this mess, Stark,” he replied. “Consider it a punishment then.”
Peter did not want to be i this conversation, but he wasn’t rude. “Fifteen, sir.”
“Harry, what’re you doing in here?”
"Of course," he said immediately. "Thanks for the reassurances that the kid doesn't hate me."
Peter crossed his arms over his chest and grumbled unhappily. That wasn’t fair, but he wasn’t going to argue it now. He’d wait a little bit until Tony was in a better mood. He didn’t need Peter arguing with him when he was in an argument with Steve already.
Harry's face softened as he continued to hold his face. “You don't need to be normal, Ben.”
Tony once saw Steve as family, one of his best friends. For him to do what he did, it felt like he stabbed him right in the back before spitting down on him. Peter wouldn't understand that and Tony never wanted him to.
Peter frowned. “Well, it is my bedroom.”
Tony leaned against the car seat with a deep sigh. “And I know I have no way of stopping you, so I guess that’s the best deal I’m going to come to with you.”
"Harry is not a suspected terrorist. Possibly his father but not Harry." Steve rolled his eyes.
Peter turned around in his dance and noticed Tony was home. Instead of stopping in possible humiliation, his grin grew as he danced over and grabbed Tony by the hand.
Welp, thank you for all of your prayers, but I hit a curb on my road test during a parallel park so I failed. I have my next test scheduled for June 15, so let's hope for that second time passing lol
Peter grumbled something under his breath, so Tony turned around to face him.
Harry shifted on his feet next to Peter. “It looks like a college party. We should get out of here.”
Peter was starting to get frustrated now. He frowned as Harry moved him away. “What’re you doin’?”
"He's always so polite," Tony said honestly. "He had an off moment. I brought up his bullies, and apparently he didn't want to tell Captain America about that."
Tony scrambled out of Steve's arms and out of the pool. Steve watched him run to his sweatpants that were on the ground. When he bent over, Steve shamelessly admired the view. Wow. He got to
"Apology accepted," Tony said. "Though you better not be apologizing for
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's why he's hanging out with a suspected terrorist."
After he was on his third serving, Peter was awake enough to engage in a conversation with Tony about how he slept. He said he slept fine, and Steve wished he could say the same, but he had a crick in his back from that couch.
“Uh huh. He told me we could take a ride together one day, but we never got the chance to.”
"Peter wanted to make sure you had good music too," Steve said, suddenly behind him. "He picked those out."
“No, because I don’t want Peter around this town longer than necessary. Not everything is always about you.” Then he was storming out of the house and slamming the door shut behind him.
Steve’s eyes darted to Peter anxiously. Oh, this was not going to end well. “Ben,” he said with a warning in his voice.
"I bet it's not a surprise," Peter said. "Because my parents are good. They love me."
"Then what is it about?"
He came back up, smoothing his blond hair against his head. "Don't worry, big boy. I wasn't peeking."
I hope u don't hate me for what's coming
"Don't act so surprised," Steve said, sliding over the phone on the table. "Fury gave us these phones to us."
“You got it, Dad.” Peter smirked.
"Grumpy and whining!"
Steve's shoulders relaxed as he walked away. It was a small step, but it was a start. And Steve was grateful for any chance of forgiveness from Tony.
"Uh huh," Tony said sarcastically, rolling his eyes. They continued their lunch in silence until a few moments later when Tony was finished and Steve was still working on his. "It feels weird to just be sitting around."
Tony scoffed as he began to pull down the sweatpants and immediately, Steve saw that he wasn't swimming in boxers. Steve averted his eyes to the water instantly. "I'm not wearing boxers to swim in."
Tony didn’t reply to that as he walked towards the coffee machine on the counter. He started the pot, and then grabbed a mug from the cabinet.
Peter stared at the young adults as they danced to music and laughed like a bunch of normal kids. Peter wanted so desperately to just be
So many comments from last chapter!!! I will try to respond to them all by tomorrow. I'm dead rn after work and just have enough energy to post this. But I love each and every review you send my way!!
Peter nodded his head, pushing himself closer.
"You're making this into a big deal," Peter grumbled, glancing at Steve.
“You worry too much, Mr. Stark. I’ll be okay.” Peter smiled, hoping it would reassure Tony even in the slightest bit. He was always worrying way too much. Peter was genuinely concerned for his cardiogram.
Steve seemed confused, and Peter didn’t blame him. He doubted that a kid was part of the plan when they were briefed on this mission. “Tony, I don’t understand. Why do you have a child, and where did he come from?”
Dream Steve froze for a moment before Tony whispered, "Goodnight. Love you."
Then Tony was grabbing both of Peter’s bags and dragging them down the hallway. Peter hesitated, feeling bad for Steve. “It’s nice to officially meet you, Captain Rogers,” he said, holding his hand out.
After a moment of hesitation, Steve answered, "I don't think they know who we are...I mean...if they did, they would have known the crash wasn't going to kill us. They would have had to come back and finish the job."
"Too heavy," Tony grumbled. He'd tried before when he fell asleep in the lab one day. Nearly pulled his back trying to lift him up.
She tilted her head, studying Tony's face. "What are you doing here then?" She turned to give Peter the same intense staring that she had been giving Tony. "What's your name?"
“I bought
"But Steve was watching, and unfortunately, so was I."
Peter sighed but stopped arguing with them. Tony glanced over at Steve, and even though he was still glaring at the road ahead of him, Tony had to fight a small smile. Steve being protective over Peter was a good thing. He could trust him with Peter, and that was a big thing. Especially when he had thought all of his trust in Steve was gone.
"Yeah…" Steve whispered.
“Why doesn’t he bunk with one of us?”
Read end notes for warnings on this chapter. I don't want to spoil anything!
“Oh.” Peter wasn't sure what to say about that he seemed to have a lot of people worried about him lately. Was he supposed to think that? Reassure them? Show them they have nothing to be worried about? Peter wasn't sure right now all he wanted to do was sit with Harry and get the pain to go away.
"Did he call you wrinkly again?" Steve asked with a small smile as he began to eat too.
"Ben, I really think you should cut it down. Let's head home before your parents see you're gone and wonder where you are,” Harry suggested nervously as he tried to stop Peter from drinking again.
Tony blocked his eyes with his hand. “Nope. Not happening. Now get your butt inside.”
Tony nodded his head and without another conversation starter, he said, "Peter fell asleep talking to Harry last night."
Funny that a fifteen-year-old from Queens had the purest heart he'd ever known. His good heart made him Spider-Man, not his powers.
Peter whirled around and knew his eyes were probably the size of saucers when he stared at Captain America himself. Though he wasn’t Captain America now in his khakis and plaid button down shirt. He looked just like any, well, suburban dad. He seemed even bigger in normal everyday clothing than he did in his uniform.
"Your
“Sorry.”
Peter sighed as they pulled up into the woods. "I'm sorry. I just had a big fight with my dad. I hate it when we fight."
Why wouldn't he though? She was gorgeous, and it was sex. What more could Captain America want?
Norman just huffed and mumbled, "Not a surprise coming from you."
“Peter, we only made the rule for your safety. We let you go places with Harry, but we just ask you to stay away from Klaus.”
If you're interested knowing if I pass or fail, I'll probably post an update on my instagram (@Parkrstark) before I post anything here. Thank you again!
Tony smiled as Steve twirled them around the floor. No more toe stepping. No more nerves.
"Anytime," she said before they exchanged their goodbyes and ended the phone call.
"I'm not teasing you," Tony said, and his voice sounded genuine. But why else would he be flirting with him while they were both naked if he wasn't teasing him about his virginity?
"I can't believe that
"Don't worry about that," Tony said just as Steve stepped on his foot.
Tony glanced over his shoulder and saw Steve staring at him from the doorway. “Huh?”
Tony wasn't, though Steve wished sometimes he would cut the kid some slack. He seemed just as miserable when Steve checked on him after dinner and invited him to the pool. Peter couldn't even look him in the eyes when Steve asked, so he wasn't surprised he declined.
Tony blinked a few times, trying to clear up his confusion and sleep, probably. “What? Where the hell are you going?”
Peter made a face at that comment because
"I'm sorry!" He said, looking down at his feet. "I shouldn't have-- I'll go--."
Steve yanked the keys from his hands when he pulled it out and quickly unlocked Peter. Steve pushed Peter behind him, and then he ran to Tony's side. He looked rattled, and Tony didn't blame him. Being accused wrongly of stealing and being detained was not a fun experience.
“Whatever you say,
“No such thing.”
“Peter,” Tony said because he wanted to make sure that Peter understood what he was getting himself into. “This is a serious and
“I mean it, Peter. If we mess this up, I don’t care about ruining the mission. I care about it putting you in danger. Hydra has no qualms about torturing and killing children.” Tony was looking him right in the eyes when he said that.
Please enjoy the final update of maybe love is the reason why (we're seeing it eye to eye)
Steve was a natural at being a dad, and Tony loved seeing him play the role. He wished this was how every night could end...the two of them curled up on the couch with their child as they watched a movie. Then Steve would carry the baby into bed, and Tony could watch him tuck them in and sing a soft lullaby.
far away from Tony's real life. "Evalyn, what are you doing here?"
"Tony, you're
Harry stood up and hurried down the hall to where the bathroom was. Steve sighed, watching him go. He didn’t have to imagine how he was feeling right now. He knew how miserable he was feeling from experience. Tony did too, so maybe that was why neither one of them wanted to keep poking the bear.
“That was one time during a fight, Mr. Stark!” Peter argued. “We were all fighting! That was kinda the point of everything. I’ve had much worse than a punch from Captain America’s shield.”
Steve kneeled by the two of them and tried to get a better look at Peter. He was covered in sweat and his face was pale. There was some vomit on his chin as well as the front of his shirt. Steve pulled him forward from Harry’s arms, but he immediately started to struggle. He had to be careful to not drop him on the dirt ground.
It was definitely Peter's music because he knew that kid loved his Broadway and show tunes.
“The kid’s right,” Steve offered, tired of just watching the exchange. “Why don’t the two of you go out and go food shopping? Though before you go, we should look into who lives in this neighborhood. Get to know who we’ve got to keep an eye on.”
Tony's phone started to ring, making him jump away from Steve. Steve stayed where he was, watching Tony closely. Tony tried to ignore his piercing eyes as he pulled out his cell phone.
people do. Host a welcome to the neighborhood party kind of thing. That way, everyone can just introduce themselves. They’ll come right to you. Whoever doesn’t show up, we can kinda cross off the list. Hydra will want to know who’s moving in on their neighborhood. They wouldn’t stay away.”
"Fine," Tony relented. "No yelling until tomorrow when he's hungover."
a problem," Klaus said. "I do not tolerate stealing."
Tony didn't care what movie they watched. He wasn't going to pay attention anyway. He was going to be thinking about Netflix and Chilling with Steve the entire time.
Tony cared about him riding unsafely on a motorcycle, and he cared about him falling into a trap of some Hydra goon.
to it.” Tony narrowed his eyes.
here. The Peter that was bullied and had no friends and had to pretend to wheeze after one lap wasn't here. It was pathetic.
Steve raised an eyebrow as he looked up at him. "Not really. It's relaxing. Right now, I think we need that most. I invited Peter, but I think you scared him to his room forever."
Steve didn't want him to get worked up about it again. They were supposed to be relaxing. "Just sit down and at least put your feet in if you're going to stay out here." He was breaking the silence Steve had been enjoying, but he'd much rather hear him than the silence. Tony was always the exception to everything.
"Okay,
also, yes, tony makes a comment about everyone experiencing sexual attraction, trying to reassure Steve, and I know that's not the case. This is necessary for the plot. I feel like sometimes I have to clarify that my characters say things that might not always be true, but it's what is necessary for the character/plot.
“He’ll get a helmet,” Steve said. “And I’ll make sure he’s wearing the right clothes. But you don’t ave to worry, Tony. I’ve been riding bikes since before you were even born.”
When Tony suggested he take a walk, he was a little grateful for the excuse to leave without seeming like he was running away. It was humiliating to hear Norman talk about him like that in front of Steve and Tony, and it made his eyes burn with frustrated tears.
Steve leaned against the counter, sighing heavily.
"Oh, this should be good."
Steve just grinned at him.
Norman narrowed his eyes at him, and Steve felt a sudden rush of protectiveness run through him. He had to bite back a growl.
“Sexuality isn’t a hereditary trait,” Tony said, standing up as well. “Did you sleep through school?”
Steve frowned as he looked over at Peter. Tony wondered if he was feeling that same surge of protectiveness. Like when a mama bear felt her cubs were being threatened.
"No, he needs more punishment for his attitude. The way he talks back is uncalled for. Harold would
Then suddenly, Tony was slipping under the water and Steve rushed to cover himself even though the water was dark enough that Tony shouldn't be able to see.
"Oh, good! I'm coming in!" Tony announced, opening the door and walking in. He watched as Peter turned over, dragging the blanket over his head. "Oh, gee. Where is my little Underoos? Is he hiding from his Dad?"
Steve had the audacity to look offended by the comment. “What?”
Getting some sounded really good right now, actually. Being underneath a big, strong man who had the ability to crush him if he wanted to but instead chose to be gentle sounded like the perfect way to release all of this pent up frustration. He wanted a hand-- like Steve's size-- to trail down his chest and caress his belly lovingly before wrapping around his member while he looked into this deep blue eyes and--.
No one seemed to notice two adults at their party, or maybe they didn’t care. These kids looked older than Peter, so maybe they were college kids. There was no reason for them to care if an adult caught them drinking...except for the fact this probably considered trespassing.
"Probably."
Tony didn't comment on it while Peter got the movie ready, and when Steve came back with three plates of sandwiches, it all made sense.
They held eye contact for a long moment, neither moving, just breathing heavily and staring before the ring tone continued and they were dragged back into the real world.
"Because your son could have gotten my son into trouble. I assure you that I've raised him to behave." Norman chuckled coldly. "I know you two might have dropped the ball, but--."
Peter, thankfully, didn’t have that same experience. Unfortunately, because of that, he didn’t know when to drop a conversation before it got worse.
“Obviously it’s a problem since you’re getting so worked up about it.” Steve took a step closer, and he crossed his big arms over his even bigger chest. He towered over Tony, and Tony knew if he wanted to, he could snap him in half without even trying. Maybe at one time, after Siberia and before this mission, Tony would have flinched if Steve had come so close to him like that. But now, there was another feeling deep in his gut when Steve invaded Tony’s personal space.
was the first thing to roll off of his tongue.
Peter shrunk in his chair, his cheeks flushing.
to be normal. It’s for me. Not just you. I want to have a normal life and a normal family and a normal body that reacts the way it should when my boyfriend and I are making out.”
Steve didn’t pay any attention to his absence and went about life like he usually did. Thankfully, Fury had stocked the house with some food before they had arrived. After looking through what they had in the kitchen, Steve cracked a half dozen eggs into a frying pan. He poured himself a glass of juice once they were scrambled well and dished the eggs on a plate. He sat at the island in the kitchen and ate his breakfast in silence.
Tony was a little more worried about Peter. The kid seemed off ever since dinner, and Tony wished he knew why. He thought maybe it had something to do with Harry and Norman, but Peter had video called him an hour after he went back home, and he was okay. Apparently, Norman was angry at them and not at Harry. Which was a surprise to everyone but welcomed.
“Hey, Spangles. We’ve got a new house guest. His name is Peter, though in this little charade of ours, he’s Benjamin.”
He'd have to do some more digging. And call May again. He loved gossiping about the kid to his aunt. Tony usually liked to do it on May's couch with a bottle of wine between the two of them while Peter was at Ned's house for a sleepover, but a video call would suffice.
He left his suitcase unopened next to his bed, and stepped outside, heading to the bathroom first. He could at least shower and brush his teeth. Of course, the shower was too small just like the bed. He could see over the top of the shower curtain and his head was close to the shower head.
Steve noticed Peter paused his scooping as he filled half of his plate with it. "I wasn't aware food had an age range."
Tony knew the comment would get him to respond if he called him that. And just like that, Peter replied, "I'm not a baby."
"Don't embarrass him more than he already is about it, Tony." Steve walked around to sit next to Tony, and Tony could feel the heat coming from his long sleeves. Tony smiled every time he saw Steve wearing the shirt he had made him.
"If he wants to be a little shit, then I'm going to embarrass him! That's just how it is." Tony shrugged his shoulders, lifting the sandwich to his mouth.
Steve was still just staring, and he couldn’t do anything else. Why was Tony wearing his shirt? He didn’t care if Steve slept with another woman, but he’d just walk out in Steve’s shirt without another thought.
Norman’s face pinched. “I didn’t want to say anything, but I’d prefer if it didn’t rub off on my son like it’s rubbing off on yours.”
“Uh oh. Seems like there’s some trouble in paradise.”
“Just-- Just touch me, okay? If you touch me, maybe it’ll work. I’ll like it. I promise.” Peter nodded his head, hoping he would like it. If he didn’t, Peter wasn’t sure what he was going to do anymore. He’d probably have to break up with Harry and spend the rest of his life alone because who wanted a boyfriend who had a broken dick? Nobody.
Peter turned to see one of their neighbors walking over. He was Thomas, the one with the boat that Tony seemed to be in an endless showing off competition with. Peter didn’t like him.
However, his frustration disappeared almost immediately. "He's what? Oh, my God-- I thought he was in his room. Okay-- we'll be right there. Hold on."
This is one of my favorite chapters and I am so excited to finally get the chance to share it with all of you!!! I hope you like it too.
Tony and Peter were both still asleep by the time he came back from his run, and he realized his predicament quickly. There was no way he could slip through the bedroom to shower in the master bathroom, and he didn’t want to use Peter’s shower just in case he woke up soon. Tony would probably kill him.
"I'm sorry. I'm sure you two will make up soon. I've seen you both together." Harry jumped off his bike and started walking next to it.
It was unprofessional, but so was trying to catch a glimpse of the man after his showers every morning. Tony wasn't about to change now.
“Do not threaten my son,” Steve warned. “Now leave.”
"And what do you mean by that, Mr. Osborn?" Tony asked.
"I took dance class for ten years."
“I’m fine,” Tony grumbled. “I do need sleep.”
Fun fact! Originally, Harry's mother was going to be alive and not know about Harry, but I decided against that literally as I wrote it and made Natasha (and eventually Bucky) his parents.
"Too late." Tony smirked.
Steve's heart was just about to pound out of his chest. What had gotten into Tony? Sure, they'd been close on the couch, but it was just innocent cuddling really. Tony curled into his side, and Steve wasn't going to turn him away. His mother raised a gentleman.
Peter frowned, glancing over to the desk.
"Why?" Steve questioned, genuinely curious.
“Come on, Harry. Let’s get you back to your house,” Tony said, following behind them.
Steve smiled at Peter’s idea. “That’s a good idea, Queens.”
"What's a matter, Cap?"
"Exactly."
"As long as he's having fun. I could just pretend he's at the summer camp I could never afford to send him to instead of being undercover to find a terrorist group of Nazis." She sighed heavily. "I can't believe my life."
“Exactly. He’s old about to know about sex. Hell, wasn’t he caught at the mall for stealing condoms. I think he know plenty about sex already.”
“Where are you going now?” Tony asked.
person. “Really?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony smiled. "You sure are acting like one."
“But, Dad,” Peter whispered, just in case Norman and Harry could still hear them. “He’s my friend!”
“You went for a run...and bought a motorcycle?”
“Just wanted to be...normal.” Whatever that meant.
I hope you enjoy!
Tony waited for her to be long gone from their table before he warned, “Not one word.”
Also, I've had the scene with the garage and wild sex comment written for over a year. It was 1/2 scenes I wrote immediately when thinking of this story.
Evalyn’s phone started to ring just then, and she smiled at them. “I’ve got to take this, but I’ll see you at home then. Toodles!”
"Yes, Captain."
He mattered and Tony hated it.
Warning for implied/referenced child abuse at the end of this chapter.
"Good afternoon, May. I've got you on speaker with Steve."
"Slow down, Pete," Tony said. He didn't want Peter to feel bad, and he also didn't want him thinking anything weird was going on. "You're fine. We were just practicing."
"Like what?"
Of course.
I needed to change it to fit the story now, but it wasn't much. It's nice to see one of my puzzle pieces in place.
"Alright, well, I've gotta run to work now, but tell Pete to call me later tonight please?"
"He was embarrassed," Steve defended him gently.
“I’m sorry,” Peter said. “I didn’t-- I’m not--.”
“That was my first kiss,” Peter explained, hoping he didn’t sound like a complete idiot. He was almost sixteen. He should have had his first kiss by now--.
"I'm glad you think this is so humorous, punk," Tony grumbled.
"You don't have to make excuses," May argued. "If he's old enough to run around the city and fight criminals, he's old enough to be responsible for his emotions and how he handles them."
It was so hard for Steve to keep his eyes down. "Tony, the entire neighborhood doesn't need to know. Neither does our son."
Tony wagged his finger. “Watch the tone, young man. You’re my son now. That means I can ground you.”
“I’m sorry again,” Harry said. “We just came out here to hide since he said he was grounded. We didn’t know there was a party. Ben wanted to drink...I couldn’t stop him.”
As they watched the movies, the others mostly left them alone, though every now and then someone would step in and watch whatever part of the movie they were on before leaving again.
