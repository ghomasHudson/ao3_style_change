“If you have to ask…” Dean muttered finally. He took advantage of Cas moving off of him and turned onto his side, facing the wall.
“What?” Castiel asked, suddenly self-conscious.
“That depends,” Dean replied tersely. He grabbed Sam’s arm with his free hand and twisted it back, forcing his grip to loosen and he shrugged himself free.
“What are you—?” Dean asked from the doorway, his voice trailing off when he saw what Castiel had in his hands.
“You have shamed us. Defiled us. Slaughtered us. And then cast the last of us from our home. There is no forgiveness after that, Castiel.”
“Is that what you want?” Cas asked and pulled on his shirt.
“Are you going to get up now?” Dean had asked with a satisfied smile; aware that he had full control over Castiel, and that the former angel was too stunned to fight back.
Dean traced the
Cas never noticed unless Dean pointed it out. It wasn’t in his nature to notice such things. He used to feel the eye of a predator on him—a natural instinct that came with being a warrior of Heaven. But an interested gaze? Never.
“In here,” Dean grunted.
“What’s the tragedy?” He asked.
It was the major details that somehow continued to evade him: like what it felt like at the exact moment he died.
“Like us. Look, I don’t know how to explain it to Sam. I’ve thought about it. A lot. And I still have no freaking idea. But that doesn’t mean we’ll be different.”
When Cas was reading in the library, Dean feigned interest in the collection of books that Cas knew he would never read. He knocked a book from the shelf and made a point of bending down to retrieve it, but didn’t immediately stand up again. Instead, he disappeared beneath the table, crawling on his hands and knees until he was between Cas’ legs. Castiel startled at the sudden and very present touch of Dean’s hands and his lips, and he gripped the edge of the table tightly in his hands, panting into the quiet room.
“I know how to paint a picture,” Dean beamed, “let’s go.”
Castiel whimpered quietly into the kiss as Dean’s hand was suddenly on his erection; warm and purposeful and practised as he stroked effortlessly along his length. Cas could feel Dean’s own erection butting up against him now and he thrust forward so it brushed firmly against his inner thigh. Dean’s breathing hitched and he turned his attention back to Castiel’s neck where he resumed biting and sucking.
And only now did Dean realise just how indescribable the feeling truly was. It was everything Sam suggested and more, whilst being nothing like those things at all. Dean couldn’t focus on any one distinguishing feature.
Kiss him because he loved him more than he had ever loved anything.
Castiel considered it grudgingly. “Have you at least ridden /a/ motorbike before?”
“What? No! No, this wasn’t a literal war, Cas. It was just high school.”
“I leave for ten minutes and this is what happens,” Sam shook his head in disbelief, “you’re behaving like children. Dean, you’re in your 30s, and, Cas, you’re how many millennia? Act like it.”
“You can’t even lie for me. Wow,” Dean remarked through gritted teeth, furious yet somehow unsurprised at how Castiel dared to be so awful. The immense fear struck Cas again as he cast his eyes to the floor, mortified—he resented himself for doing this to Dean. And for allowing himself to become so easily unfocused when his care and attention was needed most. “You know… sometimes you make yourself so damn easy to hate,” Dean grunted, shaking his head in disbelief as he finally resumed his tense pacing, “yet I freaking like you anyway. Like an idiot.”
When the silence became suffocating, Sam gestured to Cas and then wiped his hands clean of him. “That’s the last of the stitches. Things might still feel off for a while, but it’ll get easier with time.”
Castiel was alone in his head once more.
Dean looked out into the doorway, anticipating what would be waiting for him were he to step through it and down the hall to the basement. His dread intensified, leaving him hollow and unwilling to face his demons… or rather, his angel. But he couldn’t keep going this way, drinking himself into a stupor, forcing Castiel’s existence from his mind.
Then, for barely even a second, Dean’s eyes met his and he was still. And Cas froze too. In that instant, there was absolute horror and confusion at what they were doing, and both seemed lost as to how exactly they got there or why. Yet they both refused to let go first.
But with Dean he felt assured that he had a home here too.
The next thing he knew, he woke up to a dark room with nothing but the glow of the television illuminating his surroundings. He could only just make out the contents of Cas’ room, and he realised, still with some confusion, that he had fallen asleep there. It was hard to say how long he had been out for since he couldn’t read the face of his watch in the dark. Sitting up in the chair, he groaned and stretched out his back and stiff neck. Castiel was still sat at the edge of the bed, exactly where he was when Dean fell asleep. Dean knew without question that the angel hadn’t moved at all.
More to the point where it mattered not whose life he must take. More until that desperate plea for mercy no longer landed on deaf ears, instead fuelling his desire to kill. Until he wanted to hear the cries because they made him feel more alive. Dean had already begun to slip into this irreversible void from which he may never have returned. But that hadn’t stopped Cas from trying to bring him back from that edge.
Cas feared that he may very well wake to find himself incapable of climbing off that car seat. He could try and try and try and still find himself laying in that same position hours later, watching the sunset all over again. And Dean wouldn’t be there to help him sit up, to brush back his hair, and to soften the dread that existing sometimes brought with it. Cas would have to somehow do that entirely on his own. He would have to take this mission he gave to himself and use it as the reason to get up in the morning.
“That’s… an idea,” he agreed. He ran a hand through his hair once before slowly crawling over the seat into the back of the Impala. He lied down on his stomach, one arm hanging over the edge of the seat.
Dean was actually startled to be given an answer so easily, and pretended only momentarily to mull it over and purposely gave the creature the first glimmer of hope: he let the blade droop a little, the threat slowly retreating. Dean glanced back at Benny who raised an eyebrow, not willing to offer an argument for or against the oncoming slaughter. The vampire had become well-adjusted to Dean’s gratuitously violent antics after spending the better half of a year with him. There was nothing Dean could do to surprise him anymore.
“You’re just really light on your feet,” Dean shrugged dismissively, “it’s not your fault. Besides, I was off in my own little world anyway.”
The wolf swallowed hard and felt the sharp tip of the knife on his skin. As he tilted his head up, the blade followed. There wasn’t a chance of him getting out of this alive. The hunter knew all the tricks in the book, knew what risks lied in trusting a werewolf. “Three days' journey. Follow the stream… There's a clearing. You'll find your angel there.”
Dean shrugged dismissively, though his intrigue had genuinely sparked. Castiel had never asked for a beverage or meal of any kind—due to the fact he didn’t need to eat or drink—but he hadn’t asked for many any other luxuries either. The first time had been when he had requested a cassette on the drive home from the last portal. This was the second. And, again, Dean found it impossible to deny him. Dean realised, with some apprehension, that he would likely give Castiel anything he asked for at this moment. Dean was in no position to refuse any request, no matter how absurd or dangerous or downright idiotic. He was gazing at the angel through tunnel vision, his judgement impaired by the alcohol and the forever lingering desperation deep in the pit of his soul.
“No, Cas. We’re not meeting up with Sam.” It was clear that Dean was unwilling to negotiate.
“I am,” Cas agreed with Dean. It often felt easier to agree rather than argue, even if he felt worse for it. It wasn’t as if there wasn’t any validity to Dean’s comment. Lying didn’t come naturally to him, and he was slow to learn at the best of times. Now, with his mind elsewhere, all previous teachings had been forgotten.
For the remainder of the drive, Dean switched cassettes and explained the history of each band and song, having to try and raise his voice above the noise so Cas could hear. It was baffling to him how Dean could somehow retain so much information on things that Castiel himself had never actually heard of throughout his very long existence. It seemed like a lot to take in in such a short amount of time, but he tried to remember the facts in case he needed to recall them later. Mostly he just liked to see Dean get so animated as he talked, using his hands to emphasise the supposed brilliance of
Dean couldn’t believe that Cas would have the audacity to say such a thing, not after everything they’d been through together.
“Life on the road. Never settling in one place.”
Sam nodded his head and Dean shook his.
The longing to kiss Castiel came first when Dean saw him at the water’s edge. The sensation was strong, the allure of Castiel’s lips stunning Dean and his heart started to hammer in his chest. He just needed to be near Cas, touch Cas, hold Cas. He needed to embrace him and feel that he was really real.
“I dunno… just… start with what you think you want?”
“I’m not happy about it either, Dean. But it’s the better of two evils.”
Dean shuffled backward and quickly stood with the angel blade held before him. The demon hesitated, eyeing the blade with trepidation as if understanding they were dealing with someone that had killed hundreds of their kind before. Dean took this opportunity to scan the area, assessing the situation with the precision his father had forced upon him since he was a child.
“You know I tried to do that and it didn’t work for me. It’s just… it’s a good idea in theory but it’s far more complicated in practice.”
“Uh, what are you guys doing in here?” He asked, catching on too late that he had interrupted something.
Since Dean was trying to come to terms with the fact that the energy was there to stay, he ignored it as it intensified to the point of making the hairs on his arms stand on end. It was more distracting and raw than ever but Dean tried not to give it any thought and for the first time, didn’t look round.
make you feel better. I promise,” Dean said, again sounding sympathetic to Castiel’s alcohol-induced illness. “Don’t rush, yeah? Try to relax.”
“Well, I like you then too. Just a bit differently,” Dean explained.
“Isn’t that why we’re still driving? I caused a scene and insulted your hospitality and made you leave your food behind without finishing it.”
“Castiel didn’t answer again?” Sam asked knowingly.
“Dean? I need to ask… I… I have to know,” Castiel said, stopping him. He came closer, reaching out a hand as if to touch Dean, but stopped before he could. “That kiss. I, uh, ever since then I’ve been trying to understand more. To learn more… but I’m struggling.”
Dean can’t move. He can’t blink. Cas doesn’t seem to care.
“Oh, you are such a hot mess, dude,” Dean says, laughing, and puts the car back into park. Cas just looks at him without saying a word, but he’s still got a tiny little smile on his face, like he forgot to wipe it off, and Dean can’t fucking help it, he grins dopily back.
“I hope you’re right,” Dean says abruptly.
“Lose the vest, come on,” Dean insists.

true happiness could even look like.”
This kiss is a hello. Hello, forever. Hello for the rest of our lives. Hello every morning and every night. Hello for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Hello always.
Bang.
Maybe it’s because Dean is so worried about the guy lately. Dean doesn’t wanna be a dick to him, not when he’s just gotten back from friggin’ Purgatory, with missing memories to boot. Cas
“I can resupply the prophet, Dean,” Cas says. His tone is dispassionate yet deadly, leaving no room for argument. Dean is reminded, chillingly, of a Cas he met in a warehouse over the crumpled bodies of Claire and Amelia Novak, a Cas who said he served Heaven, not man, and certainly not Dean, a Cas who was resolute and inhuman and dangerous.
, and think about how maybe, yeah, maybe in a million years. Maybe in less than a million years. Maybe now. Maybe right now.
But he’s wrong, because then Cas goes, “Because if I see what Heaven’s become, what I,” he trails off, glancing away again, “what I made of it...” Cas turns his gaze back to Dean. “I’m afraid I might kill
But apparently Dean is just an extra in whatever fucking monologue Cas is working through, as Cas simply continues: “I always wondered, ever since-- I took that burden, that curse, I wondered…
Dean thinks, shellshocked. The realization pounds in his skull, thumping against the back of his eyes, and he feels sick from it.
Dean gives him a little salute, which Cas returns with two fingers, and then they’re off to complete their respective missions.

Dean laughs, because what else can he do when faced with
“Dean.”
Dean draws his brows together and swallows.
“Well,” Dean says, shrugging modestly, “this is true. But hey, I’ve been a guy for longer than you have. Can’t blame you for never having the chance to pick up the basics.” Then Dean says, like an insane person, without his mouth even checking to see if his brain is okay with it, "You do know how to kiss a girl, right?"
“That’s fine. And the sweetened condensed milk?”
Dean pulls back.
Dean crosses his arms over his chest, feeling weirdly exposed even though he’s fully clothed, feeling like he’s walking around with his skin flayed off and his heart visible through his ribcage as it pumps, way too fast. He can still feel Cas’ jaw underneath his fingertips.
“They’re
Cas just keeps on smiling.
Cas marches forward, and swings his blade down in a brutal arc.

seems about equally likely. At least
Right then, the bell over the door jingles, and Dean spins around on his stool. “Showtime.”
“Cas, Cas,” Dean rasps. Through his one good eye, he sees Cas raise his arm, a glint of light traveling down the length of his blade as he hefts it high. “I know you’re in there. I know you can hear me.” Dean has to believe Cas is in there. Dean has to believe Cas can hear him. “Cas,” he pleads, “
So when Dean gets back to his own timeline, he puts a hand on his Cas’ shoulder and says “Don’t ever change,” under the streetlamps. And at the same time, in his head, Dean says to himself,
human being… I will ever know.” And then, there it is, this, this wide, wet smile, unlike anything Dean has ever seen on Cas’ face before.
“No,” he says, brokenly. He failed.
“Your hand,” Cas clarifies quietly. “It’s injured.”
“You text Sam too much,” Dean dismisses. “I’ll get your gummies and, like, a shitload more painkillers, because we’re both old and creaky as fuck, apparently. And then we regroup here.”
Cas looks at him fully then, grinning wide. “Dean, I’m not an angel anymore.”
“Cas!” Dean yells, instinctively throwing the rock up like a shield to block the blow. The blade glances off, spawning a short-lived fireworks show of blue sparks. Thunder crashes loudly, coming from the skies outside and within the crypt at the same time. Apparently the tablet doesn’t appreciate being used as a shield, but frankly, Dean has bigger fish to fry right now.
“Do you mean…” Cas lets out a tired breath. “Do I think they’ll. Kill me?” He pauses, studying the liquor bottles lined up behind the bar. “Yeah, they might.” Finally he turns his face towards Dean’s. They’re shoulder to shoulder. Dean’s eyes rove over Cas’ face. Drinking him in. Last time. Last time. Last time.
, though
Dean slots the key into the ignition, feeling more than hearing his baby’s engine rumble to life. He’s got one hand on the steering wheel, ready to peel out, when he looks to his right and notices that Cas' tie is still askew.

Dean clasps his hands together loosely. “Yeah, poke around, see if the God Squad can’t tell us how you got out.”

sort of direct response to the awkward, halting speech Dean just made. What Cas says is: “You’re hurt.”
Cas’ mouth works like he wants to say something, but he doesn’t. Dean smiles hollowly at the ground. “All because I-- I couldn’t hurt Chuck.” He bites the name out violently.
And they're less than three feet apart on those separate motel beds.
He can feel Cas’ eyes on the side of his face, can just imagine his confused frown.
with his lips and his tongue and his hands and his hips. "Cas," Dean whispers into the other's chest, shirt buttons digging into his chin.
Cas smiles wanly, throwing Dean a glance. “Oh, but of course I did.”
Dean whistles as he comes around the side, and Cas turns around to face him. Dean raises his little plastic bag up, shaking it around, like,
Cas stands there before him, a thousand feet tall, a mountain, a skyscraper (
“Cas?” he whispers, barely daring to hope.
. He holds tight to Cas' lapels, knuckles white, drinking Cas in and allowing himself to be drunk in turn. Cas sips tenderly at Dean’s mouth and Dean feels like maybe if Cas wanted to eat Dean alive, Dean would let him. Like if Dean was gonna kneel at any altar, it would be this one.
Dean’s a few feet away from Cas and Dean’s in the Pacific, a fishing boat tossed by fifty foot waves. Dean is in the dungeon waiting to hear another bang on the door and Dean is adrift in the atmosphere, a balloon gone too high, waiting to pop, to crash back to the ground.
He braces himself. But the smiting never comes. After a few pregnant seconds, Cas’ fist unclenches and hangs limply at his side. Dean is about to scoff and make a biting comment when Cas drops to his knees, grabs Dean by the front of his shirt, hauls him up, and kisses him. It’s hard and angry and ungentle, antigentle as Cas licks his way into Dean’s mouth, devours him whole.
Dean laughs, more of an exhale than anything, and dips his eyes down to his fingers, twisting them together. “Look, man, I-I hate those flyin’ ass-monkeys just as much as you do, but--”
It’s not like the eighth kiss, which was a mistake.
Jack says to Dean.
“Cas,” Dean says, softer, and wraps one hand around Cas’ wrist, not pulling it away, just holding onto him. Cas’ face is miserable, but there’s-- there’s something else there, and Dean can’t tell what it is. He’s pretty sure Cas is back from whatever fucking episode he just had, but this is freaking Dean out. “You’ve gotta start talkin’, man, or I’m gonna--”
The fourth time is a fluke.

in the front seat of the Impala.
“What, Cas?” Dean’s blood pounds through his skull.
Dean feels as though his throat has been welded shut, and he has to pry it open with the jaws of life to get the next few words out. When they come, they’re rough and raw. “Don’t fucking do that. You can’t do that to me. That’s messed up. I’m not-- I’m not
Hello, Cas. Hello, Dean.
Cas is very quiet, so Dean picks his head up. Cas looks a little like he’s been smacked between the eyes with a two by four. Dean figures, what the hell, better keep up his momentum while he’s got it, so he goes on: “And listen-- I don’t care about the deal. I don’t care about the Empty, okay? If it’s coming after you, we’ll stop it. We’ll-- we’ll burn that fuckin’ bridge when we come to it, alright? We’ll figure it out.” He raises his eyebrows, catches Cas’ eye. “Cas. I promise.”

Dean thinks as Cas bites down on Dean’s lip, because Cas certainly wasn’t this-- wasn’t so-- well, it certainly wasn’t like
Cas shrugs, looks away, says nothing.
Dean stands up. Then he sits down on the other bed, next to Cas, and covers the nape of Cas' neck with his hand. They're so close that their thighs are touching. Dean raises his eyebrows, looks Cas in the eye, and takes a breath.
Dean nods, numbly. Cas hovers his other hand over Dean’s, fingers splayed. There’s the glow, and the heat, and the tingle, and then Dean’s hand is good as new. Cas lets go. Dean catches Cas' wrist as it falls, holding it between his fingers. “Cas.”
implied sexual content-- it’s a fade-to-black. honestly blink-and-you-miss-it.
“When I was… bad,” Cas starts, squinting as though even he knows that's the understatement of the century, “and I had all those things, the… Leviathans. Writhing inside me…” Cas still has his eyes zeroed in on Dean-- his demeanor raw, but resolute. For a moment Dean regrets pushing. He feels like what Cas is about to say might be too big.
“Cas,” he begs. “Cas.” He can’t say anything more than that single syllable. He can barely move his battered body. He’s too weak to push Cas away. So he grasps at Cas’ arm, clutches the fabric of his sleeve, and holds tight as the killing blow moves ever closer.
Dean has a very bad feeling about this.

What Dean says is: “Maybe take a trip upstairs.”
Cas nods slightly. He’s relieved, and trying not to show it. Dean is hit with a wave of-- something. Annoyance. Anxiety.
Cas tapers off the kiss, and Dean's bottom lip catches between his for just one aching moment.
Then Cas continues: “But without an army... “ He trails off, shaking his head, and averts his eyes.
Dean shakes his head, utterly overwhelmed. “Don’t do this, Cas.”

Cas turns his head to look at him. “No, Dean,” he says quietly. “You were always more than that to me.”
“Well, I just-- I know that when,” Dean takes a deep breath, “I got puked out of purgatory, it took me a few weeks to… find my sea legs.”
Dean lifts his head to find Cas’ mouth again, and Cas receives him hungrily.
There’s a loud bang against the door, and the sigil flares with light.
“Your father,” Cas comments, apropos of nothing, the first thing he's said in an hour, and Dean blinks. “Beautiful handwriting.”
Cas inclines his head.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m… I’m happy you’re back, I’m-- I’m friggin’ thrilled. It’s just this whole mysterious-resurrection-thing…”

, so he can translate,” Dean says carefully.
“So you’re human,” Dean says, unable to make it a question.
Dean stares back, and licks his lips, more out of nervousness than anything. Before he can chicken out, he leans in and puts one hand on the side of Cas' face and just gives him a slow, sweet, gentle kiss. Chaste and unthreatening, but just the right amount of intrigue, of desire. The kind of kiss you're supposed to give a girl on the first date, the kind of kiss that makes her decide to schedule a second date right on the spot. The kind of kiss Cas has never had before.

Cas, eyebrows trying for the gold medal in concerned expressions, takes another step forward.
Dean grits his teeth, and they drive in silence for a few minutes. The road shoots along beneath them in a dark, featureless blur. Dean digs his fingernails into his palm until it hurts, and then some. A sick part of him looks at this Cas going to his death and thinks,
Cas, with practiced nonchalance that he maybe should have practiced a little more, turns a page. “I’m fine.” A classic move, right out of the Dean Winchester playbook itself.

bury myself in decadence,” Cas says, slowly, forcefully. “Right? It’s the end, baby! That’s what decadence is for!”
Cas seems to understand that Dean’s not leaving without an admission, so he answers, “Long enough to destroy Metatron, I hope.” He levels his gaze at Dean, one eyebrow arched slightly, as if to say,
Cas obeys (“Okay,” Dean approves), perhaps too readily (“Th-that’s, that’s far enough, Tony Manero,” Dean laughs).

not Dean’s fault. Not entirely.
Yeah, there's an eleventh time. The thing is that death is cheap when you’re a Winchester, and in Dean’s book? Cas is a goddamn Winchester if there ever was one. Come on, he's come back how many times already?
Cas glowers at him. Then he raises two fingers to Dean's temple, and blackness floods across Dean's field of vision.
Dean tells himself, as his heart jackhammers against his ribs.
When Dean’s voice comes, it’s a dying man’s rasp. “Why does this sound like a goodbye,” he asks, knowing the answer already in the hollow of his chest.
“Totally sadistic,” Dean agreed lightly and leaned back on his elbows. He tilted his head back to gaze up at the sky. A gust of wind swept through his hair and ruffled the material of his shirt up his stomach.
And Dean thought:
“Oh, no you don’t. You don’t get to pass out just yet.”
Dean couldn’t take it anymore, and decided that if Castiel wouldn’t put up the good fight, then he would. But when he confronted the angel, he got a response he never expected to hear:
“Love it when you talk dirty,” Dean teased.
“Then why haven’t you?” Dean bit back smugly.
“Yeah,
It would follow him because it is him.
“You didn’t see anything,” Dean insisted, clearly embarrassed.
Dean was immediately breathless.
And yet Dean never looked at him that way. Never saw him as something lesser than himself.
The dimension in which Castiel truly belonged but Dean no longer wished for him to return to.
Cas felt that they may never have this again.
For once, Cas actually recognised the drone of sarcasm and he seriously considered hanging up. He thought of how satisfying it would be to cut Dean off midsentence with nothing but the dial tone ringing in his ear. The grip on his phone tightened slightly and a faint heat crept up the back of his neck. As Dean continued to ramble—lecturing him on the importance of eating at least three meals a day and the benefits of exercising (as expressed numerous times by Sam)—Castiel’s infuriation intensified.
“I’m sorry.”
He groaned painfully as he was put down, a little too roughly by hands that had little practice with tenderness in these horrid times. He knew this hastened help from a hunter. The knowledge pacified him, and then he felt some comfort at the familiar scent of the Impala’s aged leather seats. He could feel the fine cracks in its surface. Castiel sniffed the air and smelled the faint and secret wisps of lavender—the scent only he and Dean knew to even look for. It grew stronger as Dean settled down beside him and lifted his head gently onto his lap. Dean’s fingers carefully ran through Castiel’s hair and caressed his scalp, soothing him and distracting him momentarily from the pain.
Cas flinched at the suggestion. His heart was hammering. “I am
“Probably not. And I don’t think he has eaten in days.”
“Oh, you really don’t get roleplay,” Dean smirked and tossed the bloody shirt aside.
some miracle. This
Castiel groaned somewhat sullenly, but clearly incapable of actual anger. “Fine. Go get your helmet.”
“Touché,” Dean laughed flatly. “You know me far too well. It’s almost creepy.”
Castiel’s feet moved with him, away from Dean.
“Why?”
It consumed him.
“Are you stupid?”
“Then just dump him any old place,” Dean suggested. Sam sat frozen in place, startled by the venom in Dean’s voice. His shoulders collapsed forward when he realised he meant each and every word. That Dean was so far gone—too far.
But Dean couldn’t mask his dread.
“At a gas station in Sioux Falls,” Dean explained, “after the vamp nest in Marshall County we went to a suspected poltergeist case in Huron, which turned out to be a big, fat dead end. Then Sam insisted we check out an odd death in Baltic which turned out to be a genuine haunting. Now we’re stopping by Sioux Falls.”
“What if you get trapped someplace?” Dean asked weakly.
Cas turned around and saw Dean standing in the doorway. The hunter blinked sleepily at him, his eyes mostly unfocused and his mouth sat partially slack as though he had only just woken up. Cas straightened up and wrung his gloved hands together. For some reason he felt like he had been caught doing something he shouldn’t.
Dean hadn’t had a drink in three weeks.
The distance was hard and the threat of loss loomed, but these things were not the end. Right now, despite the difficulty and the anxiety, there had to be enough hope to tide Dean over. He would be no good to anyone inebriated or recovering from said inebriation. He was horrid enough to Sam as it was when he was sober and he felt bad enough for it. There was no good in worsening what was already next to unbearable. So, he simply agreed with Sam’s suspicions about his headaches and promised without conviction to drink more water and give him a turn at driving so he could sleep awhile in the backseat.
“But what if it doesn’t?” Dean asked, “what if it doesn’t and we sent him back for nothing? Could you live with that?”
“Don’t,” he warned.
Were he kind, he would tell Dean to stop. He would make him withdraw his warm touch and his loving kisses, and he would force him to say goodbye. Were Cas noble, he would gather as little as he could take and he would leave the bunker, stepping out into the wild, threatening world to accept whatever fate would befall him.
“You know… I think that’s the first time I’ve ever been used for sex,” Dean muttered sourly. He looked down in guilt. “I never thought much about how it must feel when I do it… but now I know. And it feels real shitty, Cas.”
He set his phone aside and clambered out of bed, his bare feet touching the cold tiles for what felt like the first time in forever. Without allowing himself much time for thought, he gathered up his sheets and blankets, stripped the pillows, and carried the dirty bundle to the laundry. He wasn’t much good with laundry. He’d accidentally dyed multiple pairs of Dean’s underwear a baby pink, not realising he was supposed to separate the colours from the whites. A few days later he’d seen a flash of Dean’s pink waistband as he bent down to retrieve something, and, had he not still felt guilty for the mistake, he would have laughed. Right now, he actually blushed to think that Dean likely still owned and wore them. Cas grinned, thinking how nicely they must pair in the dresser with Dean’s cheetah print boxers. Cas liked to think he had accidentally made an improvement on Dean’s usual layers of denim and flannel, even if they were obscured by the said layers.
As Castiel moved into the curves of Dean’s body the desire burned as strongly as it had the first time, with the touch of Dean’s skin like something electric and the scent of his usual shampoo like something exotic and the taste of his lips like something thrillingly sinful.
This was always the hardest part: getting to sleep.
Sam shifted in his chair, most likely kicking Dean’s foot under the table. Cas propped his elbow on the table and pressed his cheek against his open palm. It seemed that no matter whether he lied or told the truth, he would always disappoint them. He wished to do better. To be better. But he didn't know how. He couldn't think where to begin. Despite this, he was determined to try.
Were he there.
“What for?”
Dean’s leg hooked around Castiel’s, allowing him to thrust up against him, impatient to feel skin against skin. Cas trailed his kisses across Dean’s jaw and gnawed gently on his earlobe. Dean shivered at the sensation of Cas’ warm breath at the nape of his neck and his leg clamped down harder, pinning Cas in place.
Dean wasn’t sure what came first; the grief or the rage. It was both together that propelled him into action though all he could get from it was revenge—which would never make up for the loss. He whipped the angel blade out, his jaw clenched and his eyes manic with the need to kill this bitch for what she had done. As he ran forward to strike her down, he was thrown across the room with just a swish of her hand and his back hit the wall, disorientating him and everything seemed to move in a fast blur. He saw his brother being thrown forward into the wardrobe and the reaper’s back as she moved in on him. Dean tried to gather himself and he edged around the chair, eyeing the blade still protruding from Castiel’s corpse. His heart panged at the sight of Cas’ still body, his chest unmoving with all the air taken away from him.
Castiel truly felt. But he didn’t want to. Humanity had come as a curse to him, rather than a blessing—rather than a saviour from the apathetic and corrupt. Dean’s affections were essentially poisoning him.
“Ours or theirs?” Sam asked, immediately on high alert. He pulled the demon knife from his belt and held it poised and ready to use if need be.
As Dean grunted and panted in his ear, taking Cas as fiercely and forcefully as he could without inflicting pain, Cas continued to beg and urge for more and more and more.
“I think I’m gonna go for a drive,” Dean said and picked up the keys from where Sam had set them down.
“No. I don’t want you getting killed,” Dean interrupted, suddenly angry, “it’s a mess Metatron
Startled, Castiel forgot his initial plan to run and instead shoved the newspaper into his jeans, struggling to fit it into his waistband. The paper prodded uncomfortably at his thigh as he tucked his shirt over the top of it and turned around. Dean walked up to him with his hands tucked into his pockets, an easy smile playing cheekily at his lips as his eyes darted from Cas’ face to the very obvious bulge in his jeans and back again.
friends. Sometimes the complexity of it all was tiring, yet Dean had never found himself wanting it any other way. He never wanted Cas to change. Though maybe he had wanted
“Then we’re gonna have to haul ass and hope we make it in time,” Dean resumed cleaning the remainder of the dishes.
Castiel frowned and wiped his hands clean on a napkin before following Dean back to the car in a dense silence.
“You’re talking about pornography, aren’t you?” Cas asked finally.
“When you had your wings and harp, Cas. It’s different now. You have weaknesses you’ve never had before. I can’t risk my ass trying to save yours.”
“Oh?” Dean cleared his throat somewhat uncomfortably.
“Could you live with that, Sam?” Dean repeated firmly, pushing his younger brother harder.
“You left it on the table. I found it, I keep it,” Castiel argued.
“Dean, you’re disgusting,” Sam shook his head disapprovingly.
He found he had slept better in Castiel’s arms, comforted by the protective strength and the sincere affection of it all.
And, in his unwillingness to say goodbye, Dean drove Castiel home and didn’t ask him anything. He didn’t look at him again. He just wanted this hour, just this one, to pretend that things were the way that had once been.
“I hear you, chief.”
“Oh so I’m just something to do, am I?” Dean asked and ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair.
Dean left and kept the door slightly ajar, disappearing probably to the kitchen to start on breakfast as he originally intended. Cas didn’t have to watch him leave to know when he was gone. He could sense his absence. He could feel the emptiness in the room because his presence alone wasn’t enough to fill it. Cas kept his eyes on that flickering candle, holding his knees up to his chest, and he allowed the warmth to encase him.
“Sam assisted me.” Cas dusted the bench in flour. Despite his efforts not to, he shivered under Dean’s delicate touch.
“Yes. Yes, you did,” Dean said, amused.
Castiel’s eyes flickered down to Dean’s lips and he leant in that little bit closer but made no other approach. He wasn’t prepared to try kissing Dean without first knowing that the hunter wanted him to. It seemed that they had reached a point where Dean was once again comfortable being around him and Cas didn’t want to jeopardise that. But hope still lingered in Cas that maybe one day, in the distant future, they could be something more.
He sounded eager. Hopeful. Castiel couldn’t disappoint him.
There was evidence of angels in numerous headlines: unexplained miracles and an influx of missing people as the angels took on vessels in which to roam the Earth. Castiel’s chest felt heavy and his stomach started to churn as he had been reading the paper for far too long; forgetting his initial plan to avoid falling ill. But something felt different this time. It wasn’t just the travel that was making him unwell. It was guilt.
“You had no issue flaunting it to me a few weeks ago,” Cas pointed out, “I even recall you offering to lend it to me.”
He had never imagined being part of humanity in such a literal way. Thinking back, he realised that his musings had never involved his sacrifice. Castiel had always imagined himself whole, walking the Earth and being accepted for who he was by those that weren’t quite like him. Castiel wasn’t complete. He was nothing more than a shadow of what he once was, and he felt that the absence of his grace had taken so much else with it too.
Cas wanted to take Dean anywhere and everywhere; to kiss him wherever and whenever; and to love him anyplace and anytime.
“Dean? What are you asking me, exactly?” Cas leaned his elbow on his leg and rested his chin against his palm. He somehow couldn’t discern whether his heart was racing or if it had inexplicably stopped. Which was a sensation he hadn’t yet experienced. And he found he didn’t like it all that much.
Dean stood his ground whilst Sam again shifted from foot to foot. He should have suspected that Sam wasn’t so much troubled than he was furious, considering the goal had been clear all along: Get in, get Mary, and get out. They had agreed early on that they would avoid tampering with these alternate worlds wherever they could. After all they had been through, they knew by now that it was never wise to touch what they didn’t understand. And where other worlds were concerned, they didn’t need the Winchesters to intrude and change the natural order of things.
“He isn’t
“So if I were to check the trash I wouldn’t find more?” Sam asked knowingly, giving him a pointed look.
“This car is so much slower than flying,” he mumbled before opening the door. He ignored the sun as it continued to set at his back: the beacon slowly fading until it was no longer there to call him home.
The window was cool and fogging as the car became warmer on the inside than the outside from their body temperatures. He didn’t dare rub the fog with his sleeve, instead opting to view the world through a veil of mist where all the colours between the grey sky and black road blurred. But he recognised the stark red motel in which they were staying as it passed them by and he quickly turned to look at Dean who seemed oblivious to having driven straight past it.
Cas turned to his other side with his back facing Dean. The hunter’s arm was now so loose around him that Cas could move seamlessly. And even when he settled, his back cold and bare, Dean didn’t tighten his hold. Castiel closed his eyes, shifting awkwardly with the pillow suddenly feeling like a brick beneath his head. He felt ridiculous with his clothes in a messy pile on the floor, his vulnerable body like a vessel he simply couldn’t escape from.
Cas think of him? Dean didn’t even want to imagine.
How long before something else came along, maybe something even worse? What could Sam’s search for Dean bring down on humanity? After his trip to Hell pushed Sam straight into Ruby’s manipulative hands, Dean worried what his disappearance would mean for his brother this time. Because he would try anything and everything to find him, never mind the risks, just the way Dean knew
“Join the club!” Dean fumed.
“Dean?!” Cas dropped the blade with no regard for it or the dead body in front of him or the blood splatter staining his shirt and face. He cared only for Dean’s wellbeing, and the hunter was bleeding profusely now.
The three of them stopped before the fiery light could envelop them, caught by the steady voice that carried such a heavy question. Dean peered against the harsh light and saw the shadowy outline of six figures standing in the tree-line, but he suspected there could be more beyond his line of sight. They had flocked in an army, outnumbering them as if their strength didn’t already give them the advantage.
oddly human for the angel. But then again, Cas had become fond of trash television too over time. Dean had seen it happen before.
“I have nothing!” Castiel cried urgently. They knew. They had to know. Or were they so blinded by the fever of the mission that they didn’t even see the true driving force that made them sick?
It was more than he could withstand at once.
“Weird,” Sam murmured uncomfortably and cleared his throat. He looked lost standing there, his bag hanging open and half-filled at his side, his other hand still clutching onto a couple of flannel shirts. “I guess… let me know if it gets bad again?”
“See it wasn’t that I was weak. I was stronger than you. I pulled away. Nothing you could have done would have saved me, because I didn’t want to be saved.” Castiel admitted.
“I’ll go to you,” Castiel prayed, “just tell me where.”
“Don’t apologise. Dean asked me to give you some time and I agreed. I thought you’d be better off with Dean’s company than mine,” Sam told him. “And honestly? I thought maybe he’d be better off with your company than mine too.”
Sam did.
"If it's nothing then you'll just let me slap a band-aid on it so we can be done with it," Cas was determined. Dean rolled his eyes and pouted his lips slightly, but finally did as he was told and tugged his shirt off. He dropped it on the floor and then rested his elbows on his thighs.
“Yeah, but that was then. Now it’s just… well, I’ve got you now don’t I?”
“All of the above,” Dean insisted, feeling hopeful.
“I have no fucking idea,” Dean breathed, his body shuddering just at the pleasure of being touched through his jeans.
. But what was burned stayed dead, and his Cas was long gone—nothing more than ash in the wind. The spark of hope was tainted. The hope never paid off, and he was nothing but wounded each and every time. Though no matter what he did, he could never seem to douse that flame entirely. He had tried.
“No! I, uh… no,” Dean squirmed again sheepishly, “I was just warming up. Easing into it.”
Castiel brought his fist to his lips, swallowed his oncoming tears, and left the bunker much the same way he had arrived: fallen and fragmented, a once-been angel desperate to do penance.
Cas could barely hear him, but he tried to listen to the music the way Dean did. He granted that it was good, but then again, he didn’t know what exactly would qualify for bad. He near shuddered at the thought of Dean’s reaction were he to voice his complete ignorance about music.
Castiel did as Dean commanded, hitting that same spot over and over again until Dean was fiercely stroking himself and literally screaming Castiel’s name—almost as if he really had forgotten his own in the throes of ecstasy. Cas could feel a tightness inside him, like a coil ready to spring, and each thrust began to lose its sense of conviction as he lost pace. His rhythm stuttered, and his hands clawed at Dean’s hips, aware he was still holding on but still feeling as if he was falling away. The world was without an epicentre; it was just him and Dean, the two of them becoming one. The sensation within his stomach and testicles continued to tighten, the coil shrinking in on itself before releasing. He thought of it as his own personal earthquake—there was no stability to his being as he came inside Dean, his cock pulsing and entire body collapsing in wicked waves.
So instead of all that, he let the angel go and brushed his knuckles against Castiel’s facial hair. “Nice peach fuzz.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “A few times. I just… look, my Dad had some old-fashioned ideas. You know, like a comment here and a snide look there. I don’t think he cared that much. I mean, it wasn’t really his business you know? But I was his son. I guess that made it different somehow. I
“Sam and I are working on it.”
“You’re right,” Castiel admitted quietly. “I don’t want to hear about him. But you need to talk about him. You can’t keep burying him down, trying to force yourself to forget him when you and I both know you can’t.”
“Dean… you deserved a normal life. You still do,” Castiel said eventually and then gnawed a little on his lip. Dean truly did deserve a life of normality with a normal job and a family and house to call his home, but Castiel didn’t. He couldn’t have that even if he somehow found a way to one day forgive himself for the tragedy he had caused.
“Now you’re going all soft on me,” Dean teased, secretly thrilled.
“You’re right,” he agreed, scrubbing now more zealously with little regard for the water dripping off the metal and covering his arms.
Instead, he gazed up into the piercing green of Dean’s eyes, with the blue of his own dipped in insecurity. The hunter must have recognised this, as he offered a calming smile and leaned up to kiss Castiel tenderly on the lips; all heat easing for a moment into something calm and quietly intimate. Dean’s hand found Castiel’s and entwined their fingers, and only then did Cas feel comfortable enough to withdraw and slick the length of his erection with his own spit before guiding it back into position between Dean’s legs.
He didn’t know what was right or wrong anymore. He was finding it harder all the time to deny the things he wanted and the things he missed. And now more than ever, he thought it impossible to ever say goodbye.
Castiel sighed, finally easing and loosening the tension in his back and shoulders. “I know you only mean well. But I don’t want to be pitied, Dean. I don’t want you to parent me.”
There were only a few things Cas knew for sure. He knew he loved Dean. And he knew that Dean probably loved him too… but he also knew Dean shouldn’t.
“We don’t discuss Martha in this house,” Cas ground out pointedly, casting a troubled glare toward the recipe he’d copied off the internet. All that lost hope and misplaced faith was now abusing their once untroubled kitchen.
“No, you’ve got to shut your freaking pie hole before I shut it for you. Rather permanently, in a way I don’t think you’d like. It would involve this blade separating your head from your shoulders. Understand?”
Dean made it possible to feel lost in the purest way. A way in which he could decide for himself and live freely without corruption blinding him. Of course, it was terrifying. And of course, with all the power of free will, he had made mistakes—but those mistakes were not on Dean. It was Dean who was there to pick up the pieces.
And this time, Dean desperately wanted him to.
Castiel struggles to tell Dean the truth.
While Dean was in Purgatory, he’d hoped that the celestial energy would guide him to the missing angel, but the unfortunate truth was that Purgatory was just too big a place. Dean couldn’t imagine where the monster pit started and where it ended, or whether it was just as infinite as the universe itself. In which case, he was surely walking in circles in what was quickly becoming a suicide mission to find Castiel—preferably alive.
“I uhh… I don’t—,”
Before Castiel could say another word, they paused at the scattering of loose shingles sliding off the roof. They rattled and echoed into the empty air, dropping ceaselessly to the ground below. The sound travelled across the length of the unstable rooftop, one distinct pair of feet after another, toward the gaping hole above them. The angels turned their gaze to the dark abyss above, their eyes doused by the ungodly Heavens, and then suddenly drenched in fire.
was left unsaid but remained heavily implied.
“Cas!” Dean called out, his eyes locked on the angel that was crouched down by the water. Cas stood upright, his coat dirty and tattered, his chin coated with the beginnings of a beard. It was clear in the way he carried himself that Cas had gone through hell to get here alive.
Dean smiled and leaned into him, one hand moving to circle his waist. It felt nice to be cared about. With Sam, it was just a given—they would always care deeply about one another, doing whatever they could to keep the other one safe. It was different with Castiel. There was no obligation here, nothing familial, just genuine and deep-rooted affection.
“I don’t understand either, Cas—tiel,” Dean sighed, apologetic. He wished he had more to offer.
Even still, the cold bit at him and woke him up some, though he remained glaringly irritable all the same. But he could never begrudge Dean for it, and still sought to receive whatever affection he could get. As the hunter took to a rushed shower routine—shampooing his hair and lathering himself with soap—Cas mostly looked for chances to kiss him or to lean into a short embrace.
Dean tried not to hold it against his father; he really didn’t. He knew better now than he did back then, and he understood in ways he never had before. He knew now how desperate life could make you. How hard it could push and pull until you no longer knew where you stood or if the floor beneath your feet could even hold your weight. Dean knew just how good that drink could be on your tongue—the smooth medicine down your throat that made everything bearable for a little while. It didn’t matter much who the alcohol turned you into, as long as it was someone aside from yourself. It was easier to fall into the temptation of intoxication than to face the pain of complete consciousness.
Sam was lifted off his feet by the demon that somehow managed to tower over him. Their hand clasped tightly at his throat until his face began to turn red beneath his own blood. He struggled, tugging at the demon’s hand with weak fingers, his legs flailing and losing all sense of composure as his lungs became void of air.
“Earth to Cas,” Dean waved his hand in front of Castiel’s face and grinned when the former angel shook his head, startled. “You’re adorable when you daydream like that,” Dean teased, though he seemed half serious as he gazed upon Cas with genuine adoration.
“Lavender?” Cas asked.
Dean had nothing.
“There are some tapes in my room,” Dean said, “some artists and tracks I never got around to showing you.”
“And the kitchen looks great,” Dean interjected appreciatively. Glancing over, Cas saw that Dean had almost finished eating already, whereas he had barely even begun.
This would likely be their one and only chance to do what they had forbidden themselves from doing in the past. It was reckless and wrong and quite honestly inappropriate. But that’s what made it so fantastically wild and tempting. That’s what made it memorable. Cas took Dean’s hand in his and led him down the hall, pulling him in for more kisses as they neared Sam’s room. Outside his door, Cas pushed Dean against the wood and tugged at the material of his shirt, lifting it up and over his head. He took Dean’s nipple between his lips and sucked, licking the firm nub with the tip of his tongue, and nipping it with his teeth.
He honestly hadn’t known that he had been screaming into the night, but the news didn’t come as a surprise to him. Cas had, on occasion, woken with the terror still ripping from his throat, the sound so startling that it took a moment to realise it was coming from him. But neither Sam nor Dean had ever heard him before. Their rooms were simply too far away from his, and they were usually absent from the bunker anyway. It hadn’t ever been an issue until now.
“Do what by accident?” Cas tilted his head slightly to the side and puckered his lips a little, wracking his mind for answers. What had he done? Had he been trying to do something without quite realising what it was? How could he possibly know when and if he ever did it again in future?
come to it, eventually. Maybe sooner rather than later. Not that time would make it any easier. He wouldn’t be any better off losing him in decades rather than losing him today. Dean felt it was important Castiel knew that—heard the words pass his lips and saw the sincerity in his eyes as he said it. It would be no good to do it over the phone. So, Dean had bitten his tongue. Each phone call was without the honest to god fear of losing one another. It was a conversation they both sidestepped around, choosing to instead talk about everything else, even succumbing to entirely dull remarks about the weather.
Sam dragged Castiel out of the bathroom and sat him down, offering him food or drink as he paced back and forth, flustered; forgetting that Cas was an angel that didn’t need neither food nor drink. Dean reminded him of that fact in a quiet mumble and stood aside, leaning awkwardly against the wall as his brother took the remaining seat.
Dean opened the door to the storm, and the harsh wind ripped the handle clean from his hand and near sent the hunter to the floor as it smashed against the wall with a loud crash. Heavy rain gushed in through the open doorway, the wind making it more like a dense mist that very nearly drenched Castiel as he rushed forward to close the door. The hinges resisted at first, the wind too strong, but Cas didn’t need to exert much energy to force it shut.
Castiel shed off his damp clothes and kicked them aside with immense relief to be rid of them. He turned on the shower and waited impatiently for the water to get hot, but even then it barely reached warm and he realised it was the best he was going to get. And that it wouldn’t last long. By the time he stepped in and shampooed his hair the temperature had already dropped to almost freezing so he had little choice but to rush and then finally gave up when he started to shiver.
“He isn’t a danger to us, Sam. That’s all I’m saying,” Dean said timidly.
The angel had dressed down: stripping off his coat and likely hanging it up on that lone hanger in the closet, kicking off his shoes and setting them neatly by his bed, and leaving his tie over the armrest of the chair.
“No. It’s not fair to Castiel,” Sam interrupted, snarling.
Dean fumbled for the door handle, refusing to leave the kiss for even a moment. The door pushed open at his back and Dean stumbled inside, falling hard to the floor and dragging Cas down with him. They fell together in a startled, half-undressed heap, their lips red and swollen from frantic kisses. Cas planted one hand on the floor beside Dean and quickly propped himself up, gazing down at Dean with wide eyes. Dean stared up at him with equal shock, his brow raised and mouth hanging open in an unspoken “oh.” Then, he began to giggle, quiet at first but then suddenly bursting at the seams. Cas peered down at their feet and saw the strip of Saran wrap trapped around Dean’s ankles.
The realisation dawned on him and his steps slowed with growing dread. It had been so long. Too long. And he had done nothing to rectify his actions—he still had no idea where to begin… if it were even possible. He knew there was little he could do if there was actually anything at all, but he hadn’t even tried. Instead, he had shut himself off from the reality of what he had done, using Sam and Dean’s prohibition on media as an excuse to hide. In truth, there had been so much time between Sam and Dean’s departure to Dean’s return, and Cas had taken so little advantage of it.
But Cas? Cas was different.
“Indiana,” Cas said and peered at the map. Miraculously, it looked as though he was on the right track.
It was probably the most desperate he had ever felt. His every thought had been consumed by Cas, the memory of his death, and the undeniable urge he felt to drown it in alcohol.
“Sam has seen you watching it as well,” Castiel told him.
There was Cas… Cas who had only a few weeks prior been killed by Lucifer before his very eyes.
“They’re okay…” Cas replied, shrugging his shoulders, but then his breath hitched when Dean hooked his thumbs into the waistband of Castiel’s pyjamas and slowly traced them along his stomach before gently pulling the material back up over his hips—Dean’s calloused knuckles brushing against his skin all the while. Neither of them spoke and Dean’s fingers stayed hooked there at his hips for a few moments too long before the hunter finally took a step back. Dean cleared his throat and took the glass of water that Castiel forgot he was holding in his hand. The former angel was dumbstruck. His heart was hammering wildly in his chest and his mind continued to spin long after Dean had disappeared into the bathroom.
The blade tore through the flesh of his other cheek, starting just beneath his eye and ending at his jawline. The blood dripped down his neck and travelled the length of his collarbone. It wasn’t the worst pain he had felt. He barely so much as flinched. His body was still in shock from the strangulation.
“Or if it’ll take us to apocalypse-land,” Dean interjected. Without thinking he took a sip from his mug and spat the cold coffee back into it with a look of revulsion.
“And if we don’t make it in time?”
Cas dipped his head again and rested his chin on his hand, his expression heavy and his shoulders slumped. “We humans,” he agreed quietly. He pushed his unfinished meal away, his appetite suddenly and completely lost. Standing up, Castiel excused himself from the table and told Dean he would wait in the car. Dean stared up at him, taken aback and obviously hurt, but was quick to follow Castiel out.
“I’m confiscating this,” Sam announced, holding it—or rather what was left of it—up for them to see. He shook his head again and went back the way he had come.
Dean suspected they could have easily wiped him and Sam out of existence if they wanted to.
It was something Dean possessed that Cas didn’t.
—another species. Hell, you had wings for God’s sake,” Dean seemed utterly stunned at the idea though having known this all along. Castiel couldn’t help but agree and be equally as baffled.
Together they walked clumsily down the hall, leaving and forgetting their planted trap in Sam’s doorway.
Cas near choked on his beer, startled at the question, “Umm, I guess? She has attributes that are typically considered attractive by western civilisation, if that’s what you mean.”
So... it's been a long time since I last updated. I don't really have a decent excuse other than: life is hard. I intend to keep going until I finish this but I'm also writing non-fanfiction content so I won't promise fast updates. But I am so thankful for your patience and I hope you enjoy this chapter. :)
“I tried it, Cas,” Dean told him, his eyes a little unfocused as he too began to succumb to intoxication, but he was steadier in his movements as he was a far more seasoned drinker than Castiel.
“Pull over,” Cas said and reached forward to turn the music off completely.
But Castiel realised that these desires could not be granted by just anyone. It didn’t matter if someone was there to listen and touch and just
Dean approached the window with caution, and with a reserved hope, not wanting to be played the fool twice in one day. The lightning flickered again, casting brief bursts of light into the hotel room and it illuminated Dean’s face. He felt emptier than he had in a long time, looking out onto the world that was one angel short. And what’s worse is that nobody else seemed to notice that something important was missing. He had to carry that burden alone.
“It’s pie-like,” Dean assured him, inhaling the scent of ruined apples. He picked a slice from the pot between two fingers and winced at the heat, not even taking the time to blow on it before popping it into his mouth.
Cas was quiet, focused solely on his beer as he opened it and fiddled with the cap, rolling it slowly between his fingers. He suddenly felt Dean lightly kick his thigh and he apprehensively peered up at him. Clearly, there was something Dean wished to say, but Cas was almost entirely certain that it wasn’t something he wished to hear.
On occasion, a woman would pause to speak to him, often bending down and protruding their sizable bust in his direction, their eyes peering at him through their lashes, and he would reply awkwardly until they seemed to lose interest and walk away. Dean would slap his shoulder lightly, his eyes wide in disbelief, his lips actually parted in dismay.
“Don’t try to change the subject.”
Castiel opened the door wider and disappeared from the opening, slipping back into the depths of his harshly lit bedroom. Dean stepped cautiously inside and eased the door shut behind him, taking care to keep the handle turned until it was securely set in its frame. Castiel had already resumed his position at the end of his bed with his legs crossed and hands left sitting idly in his lap. He gazed tensely at the muted television, watching a poor excuse for a horror flick, the red gore resembling raspberry jello rather than blood or tattered pieces of organs and flesh. Dean knew Castiel wasn’t interested in it in the slightest. Perhaps he hadn’t even noticed what was on the screen, merely looking without truly seeing. Dean took the remote from the bedside table and switched the television off—something they hadn’t actually done before when they were alone together.
Cas hadn’t argued at the time, still startled by Dean’s obvious foul mood, but now he was a little concerned. The bags had been an indicator of a long journey, but it hadn’t occurred to him to ask where exactly they were going.
“Home,” Castiel tested the word, wondering how it would taste in his mouth. And when he kissed Dean, the hunter knew it must have tasted sweet.
It was simple, and it was peaceful.
“What happened last night?” Dean asked. He looked at his feet. The water ran down his face.
Dean hated to think that Castiel was there purely because he had to be—because he had no other choice.
“You’re such a dork,” Dean smiled.
“Dean,” Sam warned, eyeing the speed dial with apprehension.
“Not even a little.”
Dean knew he likely wouldn’t see Sam again for another hour or so, depending on how talkative Castiel was willing to be that day. He took a large swig of his own lukewarm coffee before tipping the rest down the sink. Dean stared down into it, watching the last ring of coffee draining out from the bottom, and he thought to himself: ‘
“I guess you would know what that’s like,” Purah granted and thumbed Castiel’s carved lips, “but… I never chose any of this. Do you know what I did in Heaven, Castiel? I was never like you. I wasn’t a soldier. I wasn’t a fighter. I never hurt anyone.”
“What the fuck did you eat?” Dean laughed breathily. He looked in the cart for the jar Castiel had opened before and investigated the label and contents. He laughed again, but this time with the faintest hint of disgust.
“Assuming we even need to kill him, Dean,” Sam sighed.
“So you think they’re gone?” Dean asked. He knew it wasn’t wise to be hopeful.
won’t feel guilty for using him?” Dean asked.
“No,” Castiel answered far too quickly, again offering just the one word. Sam shifted awkwardly in his chair and ran a disgruntled hand through his hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
He quickly gathered everything and went back outside, quickening his pace when Dean looked up at him. Cas silently vowed to hold his tongue and hoped that, with time, Dean would open up to the idea of discussing what had happened. For now, he had to practice patience, and he knew that wouldn’t be easy. Not when the evidence was right there on Dean’s skin—serving as a constant reminder and making him long for more.
“Oh, that one is for me,” Dean said, grinning like a silly schoolboy as he reached over and took it out of Castiel’s hands and tossed it into the backseat. “Though feel free to borrow it if you want.”
Castiel looked up, and his stare was piercing, “Too long.”
a pie.”
“You’re, what? A few centuries old? You are—
Dean had never given much thought to the state of Castiel’s wings before he had seen the shattering truth in the shadow beneath Cas’ back. He’d known they were broken and powerless, incapable of flight, but he had never quite understood the extent of it. Or even wondered if they hurt. It never occurred to him to ask, even upon seeing the damaged scorch marks left from the demise of other angels. And for that he felt ashamed. Selfish, even. Because it wasn’t as if he didn’t care—he cared more than what any friend probably should—but he still never considered the idea of simply turning to Cas and asking; “are you in pain? Do you miss it—being able to fly?” Though in retrospect Dean began to think that maybe he hadn’t asked because he’d always feared the answer Cas would never have forced him to hear, but knew to be true. That answer being that he was and he did.
Dean never dared decide what it was that he wanted.
“Just fifteen minutes?”
“I didn’t—,”
Dean considered it for a moment and smiled fondly. Castiel had picked up on his wily ways and his knack for spontaneity. The older he got, the more he mellowed out. Still, a piece of it stuck with him and had apparently carried over into their relationship.
Cas nodded approvingly. He rinsed the towel under the tap and tended to Dean’s injury with care, ignoring Dean’s illegible mumblings all the while. Once it was clean, he could see for sure that it was nothing to worry about, but he was still careful to bandage it nonetheless.
Lest Dean ever give Castiel enough information that would allow him to follow. Suddenly livid, Cas said through gritted teeth, “It was too warm though. Uncomfortable. Like I was being suffocated.”
Dean stood up from the table and emptied his coffee into the sink. He left the empty mug amidst the leftover suds from the washing Sam had just done. It was the most passive-aggressive he could think to be in that moment, with his head outright pounding like a jackhammer inside his skull and his stomach turning like he was inside a tumble dryer. He wasn’t in any position to say what he truly meant, and certainly not with any dignity. Dean was in pain, and it had blinded him.
“Sauerkraut,” Dean explained and showed him the jar. “That’s all I can taste on your mouth.”
He looked back over his shoulder and saw nothing but the way he had come. Listening with his unreliable human ears, he heard the wind, and cars in the distance, and the sound of his shoes on the pavement. He couldn’t hear beyond that no matter how hard he tried. Everything was a distraction. A mask for any lurking danger. He couldn’t trust himself to know what could happen or when. He could only keep going and hope nothing untoward kept him from his mission.
“Or was,” Benny pointed out with a casual shrug of his shoulders. “We’ve been looking for months, Dean. Perhaps your angel is long gone.”
showed. Always with hot cups of coffee in handmade the way Cas liked it— and occasionally with a new cassette he had made tucked into his pocket.
“Oh, you aren’t driving,” Dean replied quickly and placed his hand protectively over a lump in the pocket of his jeans.
Dean somehow knew that it
Dean had never asked, but he suspected Sam was awake too. Even when Sam was too young to know about hunting, he was smart enough to suspect something was amiss—that something poisonous lingered in the air. Dean just somehow knew that Sam waited for John with just as much disdain, breath bated and chest tight until they heard that familiar heavy tread outside their door and the fumble of the key in the lock.
There would not be enough time for goodbyes. Dean still hadn’t decided what he would say when the time came. No words seemed enough. There wasn’t a way in which he could encapsulate the life he had shared with Cas in a single sentence. It was his one chance to say everything Cas never got to hear—everything Dean now desperately wished he could tell him. But now that the moment threatened to appear, everything had been swept away from him. He was speechless. Dean brought his clenched fist to his lips. They were bone dry, just like his tongue, and his fingers felt cold as if all the life had drained from them. He felt physically sick. He feared he actually would be sick if he were to move even a single step. But then Castiel instinctively stood at his side, looming far too close the same way Cas often did. Dean was aware of his presence before he saw him in his peripheral vision, and somehow it helped—knowing he had an angel watching over him still. Dean lowered his hand and unclenched his fist. Sam gestured for the two of them to follow. Castiel remained close to Dean’s side as they all neared the portal.
And he found, with no quarrel about it, that his dreams were no different from his reality.
“Okay.”
“You and Sam… both hopeless with injuries,” Castiel sighed dismally.
What if fate knew this was truly the end and he didn’t miss it this time? And he would have to feel it alone without his brother or Cas at his side. He had to be ready, and he had already accepted it, but that didn’t dispel the fear.
“Oh, he knows.” Dean knelt down in front of the wolf, purposely placing the blade at the crook of his neck. The sharp edge served a very clear warning. “Where’s the angel?”
“It wasn’t useful at all,” Cas clarified though he felt that the sentiment stood for itself. “It was an effort made in vain and I understand now that you’re the only worthy cause I have.”
There was something troubled in Dean’s expression. He looked at Castiel as if the former angel could very well disappear at any moment. That maybe he wasn’t even truly there to begin with. Dean looked at Castiel as if he were something fleeting and unattainable. As if Cas was an idea rather than a reality. And Castiel couldn’t get past that glimpse of pain he saw in Dean’s piercing gaze and he had to wonder what it meant.
Castiel blinked in surprise and looked to Dean with a mystified raise of his brow, and Dean smiled back at him with a sly coolness that suggested a peculiar ease. Dean was comfortable with this new arrangement that had been thrust upon them by circumstance, and Cas was absolutely baffled by it. Until now, Dean had set the boundaries and moved into Cas’ personal space as he pleased; knowing the invitation was always open to him.
“Perhaps you shouldn’t try to drive in this kind of weather,” Cas suggested. He placed a hand gently on Dean’s shoulder though the hunter had already steadied himself and was standing solidly on his own two feet. And then Dean shrugged off Castiel’s hand and drifted to the opposite side of the room, wanting to put as much distance between them as possible.
Cas got ready in four minutes; terrified to think that were he to take just that one minute longer, he would find himself abandoned with the only trace left of Dean being the scent of him lingering on his clothes.
he used to say. One day changing it to
“Huh? What is…?” Castiel sat up and glared at the light streaming in through the open window. How could he feel so much worse waking the second time round? Where before it had been unfortunate, now it felt downright cruel and uncalled for.
“If you got your grace back, maybe. And look, Cas, I wouldn’t blame you.”
“It’s fascinating to think how far humans have advanced since then,” Cas continued. He had lost all interest in everything since Sam and Dean left, and somehow that interest just reignited. Talking to Dean distracted him from all of life’s irrelevances. He felt like he had valid things to say, and he knew Dean would genuinely listen.
Castiel hadn’t seen the waitress approach their table but Dean looked suave, confident and prepared as he leant his arms against the table, his head tilted to the side. Dean’s lips quirked into an easy smile and his eyes gleamed with an irresistible shimmer of misdeed, and Cas could only watch with a pang of jealousy settling in his gut.
“I’ll grab you something to drink,” Dean said, “I don’t know if it’ll help you much… you know, angelic super taste-buds and all that. But it’s the best I’ve got to offer.”
’ instead of
Then, for a long time, Cas had been there to help lighten the load. He’d sifted through thick tomes faster than the two of them combined, the hours passing like minutes as far as he was concerned—though Dean supposed that living for millennia probably made time rather irrelevant. Cas often found the answers for them in the end. That was only when he didn’t have all the answers already. Cas’ perfect angelic memory, as vast as it was, came in handy many times over the years, with the angel often able to easily confirm or dismiss the Winchesters’ theories.
“Sam’s still in bed, I think,” Cas said, trying to retain some sense of composure. It was difficult to focus his eyes where he knew it was polite to look. Since when had Dean owned cheetah print boxers anyway? And Cas couldn’t actually remember a time he had seen Dean wearing this particular shirt either.
“Right… sorry,” Dean winced, “Foot in mouth. Again.”
and know that Cas was the angel that had fallen for humanity.
He had found it strange when Cas suddenly announced that he was going to become a hunter, looking between the two brothers with a gratified smile. It wasn’t unusual for Cas to spend time with them, and Dean appreciated his company, and even yearned for it whenever he was gone, but Cas hadn’t really set out on a hunt with them before without being asked. Neither Sam nor Dean wanted to bother the angel with their problems though they still seemed to do so all the same, which was why they didn’t always call upon him even when Cas was sure to help them get the job done a whole lot quicker. So they certainly never expected him to make his presence permanent, though Dean figured that Cas turning off angel radio had something to do with it.
He hoped the sacrifice was worth it. He hoped it was better this way—that he could correct his mistakes, and that Dean could find solace without him.
This continued long into the night, the bottle emptying as each hour passed until he set the finished bottle aside. The room seemed to have blurred edges as anything and everything lost its detail, his heavy lidded eyes passing over them with disinterest. It was all his but none of it seemed to matter anymore. It was his home, yet it felt too cold and empty when it was one person short. His hand fumbled for the light switch and he clumsily shifted further back onto his bed and lied down. He stared into the dark abyss above his head and idly considered the prospect of it falling down on him—in a way, it very much felt like it had already.
“Hmm,” Castiel hummed distractedly. His burger had been left forgotten and the remainder of his beer sat untouched.
Dean shook his head and forced back tears he never wished to shed. He forced back his anger and his fear and his early onset of mourning. He knew something would go wrong. Something always did.
“That’s it?” Dean moved his hand from his knee and brushed his fingers lightly against Castiel’s thigh.
Dean moved to the driver’s seat and sat down to wait for Cas to get dressed and then join him at his side. There was something decisive in his expression; something akin to closure or ease, as if he had found that there were no more questions to answer. Cas observed the hunter as he gazed out the windscreen, and took note at the softness to his jaw and lips, and the delicate, almost imperceptible change to his eyes that near glistened with contentment.
“Hey, Cas, sleep well?” Sam smiled timidly. He threw a cutting look at Dean’s back, as though trying to say
At the same time, Dean said, “nothing.”
Dean forced himself into a crouching position despite the pain and swiped mindlessly at his broken nose with his sleeve, smearing blood onto the material, his hand, and down his face. The blood was hot and slick at his lips and chin and tasted of old pennies as he spat to the side. The demon he had cut with the blade was kneeling before him, clutching their wounded leg in their hands and baring their teeth menacingly at him with their black eyes dense with hatred.
“You’re bossy in the morning,” Dean commented, carefully holding Castiel’s hips in his steady hands, tracing his thumbs over the bones. He gnawed gently at the back of Cas’ neck, nipping and sucking at his skin, trying to elicit a moan from the former angel.
“Then why not just let me leave?” Castiel was quiet. He seemed to lean closer to Dean, leaving very little space between them.
Later that night, when Cas emerged bathed and dressed for bed, the lights were already off. He crept quietly through the dark and felt around for the edge of his bed and carefully slipped under the covers. He assumed Dean was already asleep as he could hear the hunter’s steady breaths coming from the next bed. He tried to settle down but couldn’t get comfortable no matter which way he turned or where he positioned his head on the pillow. Cas tugged the blanket right up under his chin and closed his eyes, trying to focus on nothing but his growing exhaustion. He didn’t see the shadow of Dean as he came over to his bed.
“Places I haven’t gone?” Cas tried, though there wasn’t really anywhere he wanted to go.
“Dean…” Cas looked to Dean, unable to express in words everything he wanted to say.
Castiel felt that all too familiar stinging in his eyes and he wiped furiously at the blooming tears before they could fall. There was no time for them. They didn’t have a place here. Forcing them away was easier said than done though as he wiped under his eyes again and blinked a few times too fast. They burned his lash line and blurred his vision, taunting him with what couldn’t fall but could still break him. He did what he could to ignore them and pulled a thread free from his jacket, pulling it and pulling it and wrapping it around and around his finger. The tip of his index finger began to go pale, and then red, and then purple as he pulled, wrapped and tightened. He watched the colours change and focused at the pulsing beneath his skin before the feeling faded into nothing.
Dean’s eyes sparkled with misdeed. “Not quite,” he granted, “but still awesome.”
“If you’re really so worried about these other dimensions, then why don’t we just kill him and be done with it?” Dean turned to face him head on, and took a long, purposeful drink of his beer.
But Dean made him wait.
“So we don’t tell Sam?” He suggested.
Dean stood behind him even though Cas insisted that he wait in the car. It was humiliating to have the hunter see him like this. Because clearly Dean had better control of his liquor intake and somehow still looked so put together and almost refreshed, if not just a little dishevelled from sleeping in the back of the car.
Castiel’s head was swimming, and both Dean and the storm that continued to rage around them became overwhelming. There seemed to be hardly any reason left within him. All the strength it had taken him to leave in the first place was breaking, leaving him tired and vulnerable to all his own desires and selfish ideas.
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you mean,” Castiel admitted. “Fiery doesn’t sound like a complimentary adjective to apply to a person.”
Castiel turned, his brow furrowed in frustration. Dean was trying to force back a grin as he grabbed the paper and tried to tug it free from Castiel’s hand. Cas held on tight and tugged back. The pages very quickly began to crinkle and tear as they pulled back and forth. Dean pressed his shoulder against him and tried to turn the other way, but Cas was too strong and his stance was completely unhindered. Cas pushed hard and Dean hit the wall with a quick thud, dragging the ex-angel with him until they were flush against one another with the wall at Dean’s back. The paper tore some more; pieces fluttering to the floor where they became trampled beneath their shuffling feet—it was a wonder how much of it would actually be left to read whenever they were done. Dean gritted his teeth, his eyes pointed and almost scary as he fought for control, but Cas wasn’t giving in, and, surprisingly, he was able to fend for himself even without his grace. The momentary shock of this unexpected strength had already passed, however, meaning Dean wasn’t any closer to losing focus. Cas pulled Dean’s arm in against his chest and tried to pin it there, hoping to loosen his hand and force him to drop the paper.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably and his eyes flickered upward to the cavernous ceiling. “The angels… but…”
“Isn’t that called prostitution?” Cas was confused and looked back at the television.
“Dean? The motel is back that way,” Cas said, breaking the silence finally and he sat upright in his chair to gesture back the way they had come.
As Dean knelt between his legs and took his erection into his mouth, Cas started to wonder if it were true. Perhaps the absence he felt inside would obliterate him completely once Dean parted from him. It was another of those irrational notions that he couldn’t help but dread.
“Castiel?” A voice said, surfacing above all the others.
“Is that so?”
This was Castiel; the man that had, only months prior, looked at Dean and said;
“Maybe you should give it a rest,” Dean suggested timidly and prodded uselessly at the pile of papers, trying to neaten them without much success. He glanced at the top page and all the words blurred into one another. How Sam still managed to read anything was beyond him.
“I don’t—” Cas started but, once again, Dean interrupted him whilst standing up;
Dean pressed play on the tape and grinned to himself when the music filled the dense room. Castiel seemed unsure as to how he ought to respond. It was impossible to tell whether he was enjoying it or not, and he probably didn’t know himself.
Soon the hunter’s hands were at Cas’ shirt, twisting into the neckline where he eased the material down and then kissed and licked at his collar bones. Castiel moaned softly, his chest starting to rise and fall with more erratic breaths. Dean’s hands slid down to the former angel’s hips, and Cas remembered Dean’s fingers tracing over his hipbones hours earlier, which caused him to shiver lightly in anticipation for more.
Really, it kept them both alive.
he was actually saying goodbye. The signs had always been there, but Dean had turned his back time and time again, refusing to listen, refusing to see what was so very clear. He hadn’t been ready to say goodbye then, and he still wasn’t ready to say goodbye now.
He handed Purah the angel blade and then stood back, watching and waiting patiently for his turn. Purah tested the edge of the blade with her thumb and then cut open Castiel’s shirt. He flinched at the sound as it tore. There was nowhere he could go and nothing he could do. He was hers to play with. She could do whatever she pleased with him, no matter how frightful and callous those desires may be. There was no choice but to sit and endure her until she was done, and then Tabbris would have his way, cutting and hitting whatever was left of his unmarked skin.
“Yes,” he promised, “I’ll do anything. Everything.”
“Of course not. He mattered to you.”
Cas nodded and offered to buy the next round. Dean dug more money from his pocket and handed it to him without comment. Cas hadn’t thought of what to get so he looked at the specials board and picked one based on what name appealed to him most.
He just had to hope that they’d show him mercy. If not some forgiveness.
“I think so,” Dean shrugged.
Dean nodded briefly and sat down, casting his eyes momentarily away to regather his thoughts. He saw no reason to lie. What use would it be to withhold the truth from him? To shake his head and pretend that the past was the thing of a horrific nightmare? That it was impermanent and rewritable, and that all those desperate prayers had never passed his lips?
Dean then shut off the device which left Castiel in a gasping, panting state. “You want to cum don’t you?”he cooed.
”Well, have fun. I’ll just do some patrols around the forest.”
Castiel whimpered, he loved how Dean always asked him what he wanted. It was something no one in Heaven ever asked him, it was always do as you were told, no questions. But ever since he met the kitsunes, especially Dean that went away. He was allowed to ask questions, to disagree with some of their opinions and to voice his own. Oh, father! He felt his vessel’s heart about to burst from the love he received from the kitsune.
“Remember Cas, you can’t cum unless I say.” Dean said in a sing song voice.
Castiel’s nails suddenly dug even harder in Dean’s back and Dean was almost sure he could smell blood, but he ignored it, instead feeling pleasure at the action. Castiel shrieked as Dean’s cock hit his prostate and continued to pound into him with no mercy.
“Anyway, I received a message from Bobby.” Sam then said. “He needs help managing the souls in his territory.”
Dean growled and Castiel shut his mouth, squirming silently in the kitsune’s arms. “Heaven can wait.” He said nipping at the skin.
Nope! He wasn’t going to be a part of this. He quickly teleported away letting Dean and Castiel relax in the feeling of after sex.
