THIS FIC WILL ONLY COVER THE FIRST YEAR OF MAEVE'S LIFE.
“You could have undressed.” Mycroft shook his head and stepped further into the bathroom.
John raised an eyebrow. He had just finished with his last patient of the day and was closing the file, which he placed on the neat stack on the corner of his desk. He huffed a breath and got to his seat, replacing the chair at the desk neatly as he reached for his coat and scarf. “Are they cute?” John asked.
“We were never not together. It was a
“Well, no but you could make me a coffee for once.”
“Doctor Green.” He returned, looking up.
“You are well informed,” the nurse smiled and picked up the baby. “Well, we encourage most mothers to do this with their babies but also fathers, it’s completely up to you, of course, but it does encourage bonding with parents.” Mycroft frowned. His eyes flicked over her, attempting to read her intentions. There were none. He nodded. She continued. “So, I’ll keep the blanket over her for now, so that she doesn’t get cold. You don’t have to take your shirt off, you can just open it and I’ll place her against your chest, we’ll leave her for about twenty minutes and I can come back and clean her for you.”
“I can be her father and mother in one but I cannot give her a female influence.”
“I assured my brother that I would not take her outside the flat.”
Maeve withdrew her chew toy to grin at her uncle and dropped it onto the floor. Mycroft rolled his eyes and picked it up, Mrs Hudson took it from him wordlessly. “I’ll wash it.”
Sherlock didn’t respond. He didn’t even turn around. His eyes remained fixed on his mother.
“I know.” He was looking at his hands.
“Oh, Mr Holmes, I’ll do far more than harm her.”
“I know but tonight is about us, the three of us.”
“Daughter, I didn’t know that you had a daughter.”
His uncle didn’t take him any notice. “There’s a lot of you in her but not too much, I hope.”
He bent down and picked up the case files with his free hand. He threw them onto the desk, not caring that some fell onto the floor.
“It’s safer.”
There was a knock at the door.
“Golden boy.” He supplied. “According to Harry.”
“I just wanted to see how you are,” Mycroft said with little conviction.
“That’s a beautiful name.” Carol beamed like it was the best news she’d had in days, it probably was after finding out that her daughter had been murdered. David managed a small faked smile, hand tightening slightly on his wife’s shoulder as she conversed with the consulting detective. “Where is she?”
Harry continued. “Where is he now? You’re looking after his child and he’s what, swanning around…”
Sherlock nodded. “Simply put, but yes, I observe and draw conclusions based on my observations.”
“Are you ok?” John asked, leaning over the corner of the table.
“She’s an angel, isn’t she?” Violet beamed, clapping her hands in front of her in excitement.
“About two hours, but it’s worth it, we’ll have a break before then make sure she’s fed and had a sleep.”
Jim rolled his eyes and answered, nonchalant. “I have no quarrel with children.”
“Pink, why pink? He knows how I feel about pink.” Sherlock muttered thoughtfully to himself.
“Irritable.” Mycroft supplied.
“Are you planning on joining us?” Mycroft asked, serious again.
The only sound in the room was their mingled breath as they stared through the window and the soft snores of Maeve, sleeping soundly on the bed.
"That's fine" John declared with a smile. He proceeded to check her ears, which were fine then retrieved his stethoscope, he warmed it in his hand before placing it on her bare chest, just above her tiny pink nipple. She reached for it and ended up grabbing John's hands and resting them there as he listened to her heartbeat for a moment. "Sounds good."
Sherlock gave John a stern look, considering it for a moment before his expression softened and he shrugged his shoulders. He reached down to scoop up Maeve and placed her gently against his torso, careful that her open mouth was facing away from his suit and instead facing out, cheek against his shoulder.
“I know.” It came out rather snappish.
“Yes,” John agreed, standing up straight. “I love you too, you idiot.”
-I have so much work to do :'(
“Wrong” Sherlock repeated. “The hospital may have called the police but this is not your department, this has Mycroft written all over it.”
“Wait,” John picked up the newspaper from the top of the pile that Mrs Hudson had left on the coffee table, and pointed to the front page, “Are we talking about this case?”
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed slightly but he nodded, accepting the small remorse from his brother.
“We suspected as much,” Greg nodded. “Did he say anything?”
Sherlock snorted. She was hardly big. Yes she’d grown slightly, putting on a healthy amount of weight considering that she was tiny when she had arrived wearing the new-born baby grow which was slightly too big. It fit her snuggly now and she would be wearing the next size up soon.
“Then why is my heart racing?”
“How did it go?” John asked.
“I have compiled a list of all the fruit and vegetables that Maeve likes and does not like.”
Sherlock gave John a pointed look. “See, you’ve upset her now.”
“And her nappy?”
“Homely.” Silvia finished
Sherlock stood up and left the room, looking back at his daughter and the ex-army doctor before leaving.
Sherlock nodded.
“Stop it.” Violet scolded playfully.
“Do…they know?” Sherlock asked, voice quiet.
“Fine.” The detective gritted.
“Don’t go wandering off again. I expect you to mingle.” Violet told them all.
“She ok?” Greg asked, stepping further into the room and perching himself on the edge of the bed beside Sherlock’s legs.
“Nothing.” Sherlock smirked. “Just imagining Mycroft pushing a pram around a park.”
“What’s the emergency?” Greg asked as he bustled into the living room of 221B Baker Street, out of breath from running up the stairs and confronted with the shocked faces of John, Mycroft and Mrs Hudson.
“I’ve had the room transformed somewhat since his last visit,” Mycroft sniffed. “It’s now a nursery.”
“Yes, well, couldn’t hide her away forever.” John smiled and looked down at Maeve.
“Self-harm?”
“It’s just a christening,” Mrs Hudson told him.
“I’m not sure upset is the correct word,” Sherlock started in his usual pedantic way. “Annoyed.”
“Just go, dragging it out only makes it harder.” She instructed.
I'm sorry this took so long. I swear I'm always apologising to you guys. I was meant to upload this chapter last week but I was so busy preparing and going on holiday. So, the end of this chapter took a bit of a back seat. But it's here now, I don't like it but I hope you do. You always seem to like it no matter what, so here it is and thank you for your patience. I will do better. I PROMISE.
Sherlock nodded. “We have a difficult past.”
“Nope,” Sherlock answered quickly, “it’s not easy to keep a two month old entertained for this long.”
“Right, that was brilliant.” John said quietly, “unnecessary but brilliant.”
“Some of the canvases may be wet,” Victor warned.
“I saw him with a young woman the other day, very pretty.” Beatrice continued.
“And you weren’t? Interested that is.” John said with a small smile.
“Nothing.” Sherlock snapped. He threw a file across the room. A few sheets of paper flew out but the majority of it hit the wall with a resounding thud before it fell apart and the papers floated towards the ground like autumn leaves falling from the tree.
“Imprudent?” John repeated questioningly, raising an eyebrow. This was the closest thing to admitting he was wrong.
“You do remember that she stabbed you a little over a week ago?” He asked.
“That’s on the list,” Mycroft admitted, shedding his jacket and unbuttoning his waistcoat. “I have to somehow make my home suitable to house a new-born baby for the night and care for her the entire time, I have been assured babies eat little and frequently, so I need clean, sterilised bottles. I have to push back my entire week, well, the foreseeable future and somehow add a baby to my already very busy schedule. I have three meetings tomorrow and a lunch with Lady Smallwood before meeting with the prime minister, all of which I can no longer attend. My paperwork will have to be fit in between looking after my daughter. Not to mention I have to somehow tell our parents that I’ve been omitting the truth for nine months and am now a father, a single father, it will be hours before they descend.”
“Sherly?” John repeated, chuckling. Sherlock glared at him.
“Use your words darling.” He said with a raised eyebrow. It was too early for words, as John kept telling him, but there was no harm in encouraging her to speak.
Harry nodded quickly. “Better now.”
“Thought you’d like them.” John’s lip curled into a smile.
“This is the south of France, not Paris.” Greg said.
The idea was rather appealing but that could wait till later.
“Didn’t.” John corrected. He placed both the mugs on the coffee table.
“In control?” He guessed. “Barely, enough to try and locate her but no more.”
“Later.”
Sherlock glared at him. “You’d find fault in whatever I'd have chosen.”
Sherlock looked at the ground and muttered, “Not anymore.”
“Both.”
Sherlock and John talk...and share a bed, don't get too excited, Maeve is there too.
Greg nodded and gestured towards the silver BMW.
Sherlock gave a curt nod and his brother in law handed John his tea before he reached into the purple car seat that was today acting as a buggy and not a pram which Maeve preferred, he unbuckled the straps and pulled out Maeve. The infant stretched her body, pulling her legs up in her light yellow baby grow as the D.I cradled her, one hand supporting her head and the other arm her body as he pulled her to rest against his body. He smiled down at her fondly.
“If you stop now, she’ll wake up and we’ll have to start all over again.”
“A free pass,” Sherlock informed him with a tight smile as his mother approached. She immediately hugged Sherlock, which he returned this time, placing his arms around her lightly. She let go quickly and set herself upon John and Maeve, kissing them both on the cheek.
Mycroft looked at the ground and John stepped round, behind Sherlock, his eyes fixed on the consulting detective’s back. “Your mum just wanted to spend some time with her.”
“I love you.” Mycroft said. He’d deny it later but a tear rolled down his cheek.
“Tomorrow we’re going to see Sherlock’s parents.” John answered.
“There’s no rush.”
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
“She’s developing a habit of crying whenever she wants something.” John sighed and scratched his chin.
Mycroft rose to his feet and collected a pile of papers from his desk. He crossed the room and handed them to Sherlock, only pausing when the younger Holmes hesitated in taking them.
“Hardly anything of her mother in her appearance at all,” Mycroft said simply, voice clipped though it pained him.
Sherlock snorted. “She woke me up.”
“Quite,” Mycroft inhaled deeply and ran his thumb and forefinger over his hot brow. “But work calls.”
“I’ll solve this mystery for you.” He picked his words artfully as he shifted Maeve slightly so that he could cross his legs and then place her back on his lap. She looked up at him as if to say ‘what are you doing Daddy?’ and he gave her his hand in apology.
Sherlock jigged Maeve slightly to keep her content, “the possible side effects.”
The hospital was crowded. John went straight to the girl at reception, allowed to pass through the usual Friday night crowd because of the baby in his arms, she pointed him in the right direction and he walked down the hallway. Maeve was cradled in one arm, almost asleep, wearing a pink bunny outfit to protect her against the cold. She had been asleep in the cab but the lights and sounds of the hospital had woken her, and now she was desperately trying to return to sleep. In John’s other hand he carried the car seat.
Sherlock glared at the offending item, holding Maeve tight to his chest as she snored softly against his neck, completely undisturbed. “Definitely not.”
Maeve released his hand and focused instead on his blazer. She grasped the fabric in her small fingers and lowered her face to the collar of his shirt. Mycroft didn’t react, this was her usual behaviour after all. It reminded him of Sherlock as a baby, always wanting to touch and put things in his mouth.
Mycroft raised his eyebrow but said nothing in response.
Siger nodded in understanding and lent forward to place a reassuring hand on his wife’s knee.
John shook his head.
John nodded and then frowned. “Wait, what?”
“Yeah,” John answered. He glanced at his shoulder at his landlady as he brought Maeve up against his chest and placed a hand on her back, rubbing it through the material as she cried into his shirt.
“Is she ok?” Concern flashed across his usually indifferent face.
John stopped and watched as he disappeared around the corner, hurt and protecting his child. He turned on Anderson ready to give him an earful when Sally asked, gently. “How could he not know that he had a daughter?”
“No, with her dressed as a rodent.”
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed with a small smile.
“I’ve got my first antenatal class,” Claire mentioned over lunch one day, a few weeks later.
Sherlock stood up in one smooth movement. “Thank God.”
“She’s getting big now.”
Detective Inspector Lestrade was waiting outside the house when Sherlock arrived. His hands were tucked into his trouser pockets and he looked mildly disturbed. His many years on the job had given him a thick skin when it came to crime scenes but there was no hiding how each call out chipped away at him. Sherlock could read that there was more to this case than met the eye before he’d even stopped and pressed down the break, halting the buggy on the path.
Sherlock nodded again, this time with his ‘stop being an idiot’ expression. John nodded and turned back to the road, “off we go.”
“Good.” Sherlock gave a curt nod.
“And you’re with the police?” Amanda Fowler’s father asked as he took a seat beside his wife. Sherlock was sat on the sofa opposite them, one leg crossed over the other and his hand resting on his knee as his eyes flicked over the room, returning to the couple every so often.
“Maeve is a brilliant conductor of light and without her near you struggle to think” John said as though he was reciting a script, he stopped the moment Sherlock glared and corrected. “No, sorry, you struggle to access your mind palace correctly when she is not near you.”
“You can call us,” he reminded his son, “whenever you need anything.”
“Sadists rarely are,” Sherlock sighed. “They’re desires grow and the severity of the sadistic act increases over time.”
“I would never put her in a situation where harm may befall her.” Sherlock was serious.
“Yes, it was done in the most delicate way possible. But she still lingers and well, I have a sneaking suspicion she’s trying to get into my house.”
“Do you mind if I read for a bit longer?”
“Everything ok?” He heard John call from the hallway.
“You know what I mean.” Violet frowned, it wasn’t an angry frown, and there was nothing behind it.
“Amanda Cole,” Lestrade read from the sheet of paper. “She came in about a suspected poisoning.”
“Eve,” Sherlock answered.
“Modelled?” John asked, notebook and pen poised and read.
Sherlock looked affronted and reminded him. “I have my hands full John.”
“Murder.” Silvia exclaimed at the same moment that Harold repeated, face drained of colour. “Kidnapping.”
She asked placing one hand on her hip.
Sherlock turned back to the window and John swung his legs out of bed, pulling a blanket over his body in the process and got to his feet. The rugs covering the wooden floor was cold and he wanted nothing more than to lay back down and sleep, but he stood up and walked towards the window.
John nodded and Sherlock left the room with Maeve, walking down the hallway and towards the bedroom. He closed the door behind him and went about getting her ready for bed, changing her nappy and putting her in a sleepsuit. They laid down on the bed together, her on her back and him on his side facing her. He read her a page of Alice and Wonderland and stopped, remembering the page when she was snoring gently. He placed the book on his bedside table and left her on the bed, with pillows surrounding her like the sides of a cot instead of using the Moses basket. He could place her in that later when she was sound asleep. He turned the monitor on and checked the volume before leaving the room.
“Right.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and got up from the bed, he stopped in the threshold and lent against the archway with his arms folded across his chest. “There’s no need for you to leave, she’s quite asleep.”
John jumped out of bed and wrestled the closest jeans and coat.
“Nothing.”
“I thought we could go for a walk.”
“She won’t harm Maeve.”
Sherlock found Maeve in her bouncy chair, the cat was spread out on the floor beside her fast asleep and John on the sofa, reading. He looked up at Sherlock and smiled.
Then he got up and changed into a pair of black swimming trunks and changed Maeve into a new swimming costume, it was black and yellow striped with a small ruffle shirt around the waist. He rubbed sun cream into both her skin and her, then picked her and placed her on his hip.
Maeve sneezed and looked shocked by it.
“It was kind of sudden, you jetting off to Paris.”
“Alright,” Lestrade clapped his hands together.
The pair looked utterly horrified and quickly looked forward.
John’s lip tugged up on one side.
“It’s uncanny.” Harold added.
Sherlock nodded and allowed Silvia to say goodbye to a sleeping Maeve.
“No, it’s fine.” Sherlock gestured vaguely with his hand. “No doubt Mummy and I, will be spending the morning together.”
Violet shot Siger a look that said ‘he’s your son too, tell him’. Siger held his hands up in defeat and told her simply “he’s right.”
“Fine Gregory.” Mycroft answered, scolding the older man. Maeve was completely content, wrapped up in her coat, gloves and scarf with two separate blankets snug around her body. He was surrounded by a group of worriers.
“Sorry,” Sherlock shuffled his feet slightly. “That was…wrong of me, I will endeavour to do better.”
“Hardly straying from your usual behaviour,” Mycroft commented.
The buzzing of his mobile phone woke him up. The offensive hissing of the mobile jumping up and down on the wooden dresser too loud in the silent flat, Sherlock growled and reached out blindly for the source before it woke Maeve up. He pressed ‘call’ and brought the mobile to his ear without bothering to open his eyes, his voice rough with sleep, “Sherlock Holmes.”
John’s attention snapped to his lover and his expression softened quickly. “Yes, of course they will. Why? Are you scared they won’t?”
He picked up a small torch and shone it into Maeve's eyes, she widened her eyes in response and quickly shut them, moving her head to the side and away from the onslaught on light as he face scrunched up in displeasure.
“Allow me,” Mycroft said, picking up the two suitcases and bag on top of it.
“Should we be worried?” Violet asked with an amused smile.
John closed his eyes and ran a hand through his hair. “Now I feel like a dick.”
“I would be if I were you,” Sherlock said beneath his breath.
Sherlock eyes narrowed in way that John knew meant 'fascinating', he often had this look when finding out new data. "So you're proud of me because of..." His eyes flicked to Maeve "how well I've adapted to having Maeve in my life."
“In the evenings mostly, after work, sometimes I’d come home and she’d be on my doorstep. Other times she’d come over in the middle of the night.”
Sherlock put his hands on his hips. “It was a team, her sister and the boyfriend are involved somehow. I need more data on the sister, my homeless network are following her. I need to observe her in person.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“Here?” Siger asked, glancing at the vast amount of Christmas decorations.
Good news is that I've planned out the next fifteen or so chapters, which also took forever because I'm having to do all sorts of research into babies, the important milestones e.c.t.
He stormed into the room, not bothering to knock. John startled awake, sitting up in his bed completely alert within a moment. Sherlock opened his mouth to speak but shut it again, suddenly very aware that it was early hours of the morning, he was holding his daughter and John wasn’t wearing a top. His eyes were glued to the ex-soldiers chest, he was tanned and muscular despite his time away from the army. The scar on his shoulder was mesmerising, still pink in the middle but faded into silver in the web of the wound.
“And what are you going to do?” John asked, surprised.
John smiled lovingly at his landlady. “Of course you can.”
Sherlock whispered.
” He giggled.
“Time for bed I think.” John said.
Siger managed an encouraging smile.
“You have her back?” Violet asked.
Sherlock levelled him with a look. “My middle name is Sherlock.
“Stop distracting me I’m working a case.” He said simply, not meaning it as he turned back to the mirror. Maeve whined loudly and Sherlock glanced down and told her. “You can distract me to your heart’s content.”
“Thank you.” Sherlock responded, those two words seeming alien coming from him and reeking of fake pleasantness. But he meant it, or at least meant the sentiment behind it.
“Sentiment?” Sherlock asked, tilting his head to the side.
“I’m failing to see the
“How bold?”
“Many.” Mycroft admitted, lips pursing slightly.
“You wanted to keep her safe,” his father settled on the sofa beside his wife with a lopsided smile.
“She knows her killer John.” Sherlock answered simply, eyes flicking to the sleeping Maeve before resting on John again. “There’s no way that a stranger could find a way into her house and singlehandedly nail her to the wall. She knew her killer or at least one of them, we’re looking for a duo.”
“I don’t want your fond memories. I want all of you.” John was careful not to raise his voice.
Mycroft was sat with his back impossibly straight on the uncomfortable plastic chair provided in the hospital waiting room, both arms clutched possessively over the baby pressed against his chest, sleeping soundly. A thin blanket was over her body protecting her from the strong lighting as she snored softly against his neck, warm breath tickling his skin with every exhale.
Mycroft cleared his throat and stood up, he carefully plucked the sleepy baby from his mother’s arms, keeping his eyes pointedly on Sherlock. He pulled Maeve close to his own body and allowed his gaze to drop to the top of her head for a second, checking that she was okay as her lip quivered threateningly and her head dropped onto his shoulder. He cleared his throat and fixed his brother with a firm look, the kind that left nothing to the imagination, Sherlock was not getting what he wanted, not this time. “Take some time.”
My Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram are all the same: @honeybeebatch
“You can work after tea.” She told him.
Sherlock released a small chuckle, “yes, he is a good one.”
This would require a lot more data.
Harry sat back in her chair and sighed loudly.
The ex-army doctor lent forward and craned his neck to look at the sleeping baby, her little nose scrunched in sleep and eyes closed, lips moving gently like she was suckling the air. “The result of a one night stand” Sherlock clarified.
“For me.” A deep baritone answered. Sherlock was approaching them, fast, looking slightly concerned but to the untrained eye he looked like his normal self, harsh expression in place. He pocketed his leather gloves and stepped towards the pram, into the gap as Lestrade stepped back, clearing room for him. Inside, Maeve remained asleep and undisturbed.
“I have included additional security to the property to make sure no other incidents like this occur,” he explained.
The doctor came back in, glancing around the room. He stepped into the room, followed by the same nurse as before with a bottle in her hand and small muslin. In his hands he held a file. “Miss Howards was discharged this morning” He informed them.
Sherlock looked up and turned to face his partner. John was sprawled lazily across his side of the bed wearing only an old top and his boxers, the covers pulled haphazardly over his legs.
“My mother called.” Sherlock placed his hand back on Maeve’s back.
“And her hair longer.” She rested her chin on her hand and watched Maeve. “It’s getting curlier.”
Sherlock allowed his eyes to flick over the many tired travellers, set up on the seats for the night, waiting for their flights. He was on his second lap when a flight to the coast of Greece was announced. A flood of people leapt to their feet, grabbed their bags and moved towards the gate. Sherlock moved his hand up to Maeve’s head and held her close, his large hand covering her ear. She frowned but didn’t wake.
The silence was deafening.
“I’m assuming they didn’t walk,” John thought aloud.
“Play nice,” John reminded him.
John raised an eyebrow. “Good.”
“Thrilling.” Sherlock declared flatly as he picked up the first bowl and spooned at the off-white mush. He made sure only a small amount was on the spoon before offering it to her. Maeve looked at the spoon cautiously before cracking her mouth open slightly. Sherlock moved the spoon forward and then placed it at her lips. She opened wider and accepted the spoonful. After a few seconds, her expression changed.
“She ok?” John nodded towards the infant.
“You’re always to blame.” John corrected.
The bath was the perfect temperature for Maeve. He stepped into the bath with caution and lowered himself into the water. There was enough that it reached up to her mid-belly while she was rested on his lap. His hand held her firmly against his chest so that she would not slip or fall. With his free hand, he picked up the little green ball he had left in a dish on the side.
“You’ve never got on.”
“So -” Mrs Hudson started, obviously excited and glanced around the flat, “Where is she then?”
“Hiding,” Mycroft answered.
“There is little of her mother in her.”
“Respect your elders,” Greg added, pursing his lips as he took the seat opposite John.
The attention flipped to him and Louise smiled at him, wickedly. “Mr Holmes, you’re awake.”
“Sherlock.” Mycroft said with a little more force.
“And what?” Victor asked, snapping out of his shocked reprieve.
“Louise exhibits the classic signs of narcissism as defined by Hotchkiss as Shamelessness, magical thinking, arrogance, and envy, sense of entitlement, exploitation and lack of boundaries.” Sherlock illuminated. “Louise feels debased by Amanda and felt the need to relieve her own low self-esteem by degrading her sister and reflating her ego. She has a feeling of superiority that Amanda challenged with her ‘perfect’ life and the sense of entitlement she feels means this was perceived as an attack on her authority and superiority.”
Sherlock shook his head, “I would prefer that she stay with me, to monitor her for further side effects and any raises in temperature.”
“I’ve memorised her body temperature and recognise when there is a change even through layers of clothing.” Sherlock informed him, running his hand down her face softly.
The odour of cooked vegetables and fruit still hung thick in the air. The window, which was ajar, had done nothing to get rid of the smell. He put Maeve down on her tummy time matt facing up towards the colourful archway with small soft animal toys. She was immediately captivated by them and started to reach up as Sherlock sighed and took a moment to brush his hair, keeping an eye on the infant in the mirror. Once he was finished brushing, he tousled the curls into their ‘natural’ shape, put down the brush and sat on the floor beside his daughter.
Siger was reminded of Sherlock as a child. “Fine.”
“Partner.” Sherlock corrected.
“This is the Matrix system stroller, it’s three in one. You can have it as a pram or attach the carseat, and it shifts into a buggy for when’s she’s a little older.” Emma explained, it was the best pram in the store. “There are various colours in stock.”
“Yes,” Sherlock cleared his throat. “Maeve is able to support her own head, she often has the motion of chewing, and a growing appetite and significant weight gain within the past weeks.”
“You don’t have to apologise for work, Gregory,” Mycroft told him.
“You’ve been thinking of taking Maeve to the country manor,” Mycroft answered, removing an imaginary piece of lint from his suit.
“He got her back and in return we gave him what he wanted.”
Sherlock turned to face his brother.
“Yes, because you’re her father.”
“Not anymore.” His smile was practically evil.
“Violet.” Siger pleaded, he continued to lay the table with a glance at his wife.
“I’m going to be out of the country.”
Christening day!
Sherlock frowned, “of course it’s ok. Why wouldn’t it be ok?”
Mrs Hudson was gone, back downstairs. She had sat while Sherlock explained, drinking tea and feeding Maeve left shortly after Mycroft’s arrival. Sherlock was back on the sofa, just sitting, still holding Maeve in the same fashion as John had found them in previously.
“As long as possible,” Sherlock responded in a clipped tone.
“You don’t have to watch her.” Mycroft smirked.
“And you managed to bring Greg down with you, what happened?”
“I didn’t want to disturb you.” John said.
“You don’t want it in the bedroom?” he asked, slightly confused.
“I just, we shouldn’t be putting her in harm’s way.”
“You were both fully aware of the situation going into this relationship but now you’re both giving up. My brother will never be with anybody else after you.”
He glanced around the living room, eyes stopping on the files of today’s papers; all plastered with photographs of Sherlock with Maeve.
John plucked one of three gels from the table and extended his hand to Sherlock. The consulting detective eyed him pointedly. John cleared his throat, “well…”
“Her mind is like a sponge, constantly absorbing information.” He said as though it were the most obvious thing, he turned back to the window and jiggled it.
“How was Paris?” Mycroft’s fingers tightened around the handle of his umbrella.
Mycroft swallowed. “It’s a lot.”
"Yes," John sighed, he lent forward and kissed the taller man quickly on the lips.
“Not anymore.” Sherlock articulated.
“Well, she’s like a headless chicken down there. She’s shouted at me at least three times, it’s best out stay out of her way until later, preferably after she’s had her first glass of champagne.”
“That’s, you make it sound easy.” Silvia said.
“Thank God you’re home” Sherlock muttered softly, throwing his head back against the back of the sofa exaggeratedly, hitting the wall with a soft thud.
There was a woman. Blonde, tall with tanned skinned and a French accent. She was visiting her parents in London and he met her at a bar, after a fight with John. It had only happened the once but apparently that was enough, going by the baby bundled in his arms.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded and stretched out on the sofa like a cat, he took one arm off of his daughter and place it on the back on the sofa. “I told Mike I was looking for a flat share and he returned after lunch with your son.”
“You’re taking her with you?” John’s eyebrows rose in surprise, so high that they were practically touching his hairline.
They tried various types of photos with Maeve. There were a few with her sat up, Sherlock’s hand supporting her underneath a blanket, then some with her on her front, between the small moments that she supported her head and attempted the push herself up. The best came from her being lain on a blanket and fighting off the throes of sleep. A couple of nice pictures were taken of her, gazing up at Sherlock, though you couldn’t see him, it was obvious by the look in her eyes –wonder, joy and excitement- that she was looking up at her father.
“When has our family ever been conventional?”
John woke with a long groan, stretching his tired limbs as he opened his eyes. The room was light, the sun flitting through between the parted curtains and illuminating the room in a soft light. He reached out, hand meeting Sherlock’s thigh. He blinked and turned his head towards the consulting detective, he had expected Sherlock to already be up and out of bed. He was reclined, head and shoulders on the pillows. He was tucked under the covers with Maeve on his chest. She was chewing at the exposed flesh of his neck, her head resting on his shoulder with his hand on her back keeping her steady.
“You don’t seem fine.” The blonde moved towards the back of the car to collect the bags as the driver did the same with a small reassuring smile.
“Merry Christmas to you too,” He was still smiling.
Sherlock smiled to himself. It may not be over but it was postponed, that was something.
“No.” John said firmly.
“You wouldn’t make it out of the street.”
Sherlock nodded.
“Yes.”
“What’s happening?” Mycroft demanded, his body a mere inch from hers, eyes scanning her face.
John placed two cups of tea on the table, one for Violet and the other for Siger.
“She isn’t but at least she has a protective instinct.”
“Who’s being childish now?” Sherlock retorted.
“It must be nice for you to be off with her, don’t you have to work?” She asked.
Silvia’s face lit up with an uncontrollable smile. “She is the spitting image of you.”
“Yes, it was nice of you.”
“Sherlock,” the voice said a little more forcefully.
Sherlock inhaled, “fresh air, it’s good for Maeve.”
“Right.” John frowned.
John nodded and Sherlock carried on looking around the room, not giving any indication that he’d heard the other man. Instead, he used his free hand, the one not currently stroking his daughter’s scalp, and moved one of the canvases at the front of the pile. He crouched down, weary of the infant attached to his front. Behind the painting, he’d moved was an unfinished portrait of a girl, well, young woman. He titled his head to get a better look at it, the girl in question was pretty, pale with freckles and straight brown hair that was only painted on one side and without great detail. The eyes were brown also and glimmered with an unspoken longing.
didn’t want to be involved?”
“You can continue to talk,” Sherlock answered, already in the process of entering his mind palace.
“Yes, yes, he could” John nodded. He looked back down at the book and spoke, this time to Sherlock. “Are you going to stand there all night?”
“Don’t get grumpy.” John chuckled. His eyes shifted in the direction of the cot. “
“Sherlock hit his head, he’s at the hospital. I’ve got to go and pick him up.”
Obviously not. The army-doctor could see as much.
The consulting detective climbed into bed and turned onto his side to face John.
Sherlock stepped into the living room and was greeted with the sight of his partner sat on the sofa, with Jade curled up in his lap, fast asleep, and his father in the blonde’s armchair nursing a cup of tea.
“No.”
“Good.” Sherlock stepped away from the car, leaving the door wide open and allowing the officer to get a good look at the sleeping baby in the carseat.
“I’m not the childish one, I’m involved” he mimicked his older brother, reciting his exact words from earlier.
“No you didn’t,” Sherlock muttered, placing his lips against Maeve’s forehead.
Harry looked up and met his eyes. “Don’t you think this is all happening too fast?”
“Right.”
“I’ll leave her,” he nodded his head towards the infant attached to her father’s chest. “She won’t be involved.”
John wakes up alone, Sherlock talks to the victims parents and has to organize childcare for Maeve.
“Later, yes.” Sherlock answered.
Sherlock hummed in agreement and placed the cup back in the saucer, he lent across the arm of his chair and placed the tea on the desk. He turned back to Mrs Hudson and crossed one leg over the other, and admitted with a wary smile, “recent events may have redeemed Mycroft somewhat in my mother’s eyes.”
“I’m concerned, just like your parents.” The blonde corrected, setting the buggy up beside the sofa and taking a seat in one of the chairs opposite Lestrade, he thanked Sally when she placed two glasses of water on the desk.
“My dear, you didn’t have to.”
“I’ll be back in twenty minutes.”
“Fine. Her first tooth has finally cut through and she’s on finger foods, so she’s on track.”
The tension in the flat sat heavy in the air as Mycroft sat with Maeve looking up at his brother and Sherlock breathed deeply, fighting the urge to rip his daughter from his brother’s hands.
“Leave the boy alone,” Siger sighed.
God, this was not going to be easy.
Mycroft placed the Moses basket beside his chair.
"Present" Sherlock called out from further in the flat like a child hearing their name in the register, he appeared around the corner with Maeve on his hip, supported by a long arm and holding onto his shirt. She was wearing a new baby grow that was pale yellow with small teddy bears. Her eyes fixed onto John and she opened her mouth widely in excitement.
“I’m cold.” John admitted.
“This is the place.” John gestured to the restaurant that they had reached.
“When he felt better, yes.”
“He does know that Halloween is the perfect time of year for weirdos on crime sprees.”
“I don’t know,” John admitted.
“No, of course, it’s not.” The older man assured him.
Sherlock stepped inside the large changing room and locked the door behind himself, he exhaled loudly, dropped his bags onto the small bench and brought Maeve away from his chest to look into her slightly sleepy eyes. “We’re going to go swimming.”
"You're more likely to get into trouble" John chuckled.
“You were jealous because I let him in.”
Sherlock said nothing, he only pouted as watched as John left the room giggling.
“She’s not crawling yet,” Sherlock spoke up in a distant way.
“Shall we?” John asked, gesturing to the guide waiting for them.
“Not really.” John admitted. “He just couldn’t turn off, couldn’t put her down or take his eyes off her. Pretty normal for the circumstances.”
“That I have to return to work,” Mycroft answered simply, brushing an invisible piece of fluff from the arm of his jacket.
Sherlock nodded and gestured his head towards the ambulance. John let go and lead him towards it.
The world was spinning.
The phone rang and Sherlock’s head jerked towards it. His eyes narrowed in confusion and he picked it up.
“She’s getting mobile now.” Mrs Hudson said fondly.
Sherlock stepped out of Baker Street, Maeve now dressed in a plain bodysuit with a soft white jacket over the top and a blanket wrapped around her bottom half, a matching hat covering her tiny head, tucked in against Sherlock’s chest in what looked to be his favourite way of holding her.  The length of her body resting against his torso, hand supporting her back, neck and head with one arm and the other holding her bottom, keeping her close and feeling the soft puffs of air against his neck. He’d kept his scarf off, in his coat pocket which he was now wearing.
“Understatement of the century.” Sherlock muttered to himself, rolling his eyes and leaning forward.
Sherlock blinked a few times, staring at John as he did so and when it became obvious that John was clueless, he scoffed. “If you don’t like the taste, I’m hardly going to put it in my daughter’s mouth.”
“Yes, I’m consulting on your case.” He informed him. “Do you know where he took you?”
The consulting detective frowned, the obviously was implied, and turned off the blow torch. He placed it on the counter and put the eyeball in the waiting kidney dish. He took of the gloves and placed them on the counter and finally removed his safety goggles. He raise an eyebrow in a ‘what are you waiting for’ manner.
“How long are you going to let her sleep?”
“Fine.” Sherlock frowned in confusion.
“Family? When was the last Christmas you spent with your family?” John deadpanned as he walked back into the room with two teas, not the coffee that Sherlock had demanded upon entering the flat.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly but held his finger out. John squeezed a pea sized amount of the gel onto his forefinger and watched as Sherlock rubbed the gel over Maeve’s gums as she frowned, her nose crinkled up and mouth trying, and failing because of the finger in her mouth, to draw into a thin line.
“Twenty minutes,” Greg informed him.
“Time?” Mycroft asked, eyebrows raised.
Maeve frowned. John offered her one of his hands and she accepted, holding two of his fingers in her small fists. Her face softened and she smiled, looking back up at Sherlock, not releasing her grip on his hand.
“I didn’t wrap them just so you could stare at them.”
“Then some lunch.”
“Yes,” she nodded and continued to look down.
“Aren’t you full of surprises today?” Greg asked, directing his question at the infant as he watched Sherlock bring her slowly down to rest against his chest, smile smaller but not fading in any shape or form.
Chloe’s nose wrinkled in disgust.
“Ten minutes.” Mycroft said
The three men ate in relative silence.
Sherlock shrugged. “I merely informed her that I was your partner and Maeve your daughter.”
The street smelled like burnt coffee beans and mince pies. Sherlock almost regretted picking a spot beside the small but colourful coffee shop. He was torn between wanting a mince pie and wanting to storm into the shop and tell them how ridiculous it was serving mince pies so far away from Christmas. There was still months until that dreaded time descended upon London forcing more people into the streets and an infinite amount of Christmas decorations. He frowned to himself, surely Christmas was still some time away. It wasn’t something that he took much notice of but now, with his daughter in his life and John, there was no doubt that it would become some big event and take up more room in his mind palace than strictly necessary. His mother would request his presence at some over the top dinner and there would be an innumerable amount of gifts. There could only be a little over a month until the dreaded day, it had crept up faster than he cared to admit. Maeve was six months old.
“What?”
“I am
His mother look horrified at the suggestion.
“It was agreed early on that I wouldn’t take an active part in the child’s life but things have changed now. I will be taking sole charge of her.”
“Anything to stop your mind from, what was it you used to say?” Sherlock sighed, his brother’s memory was perfectly fine. “
“Have you been out with your daddy?” He asked her before looking at Sherlock. “How was the music class?”
“Hey, you ok?” John asked as he found Sherlock again.
Sherlock mumbled, “I don’t want her to forget about me, ever.”
“The royal London.”
“No problem.” Sally managed. She walked away back towards the group of officers outside of the house.
“Well, you remember this party.”
“The cook.” Silvia gasped.
“That the body that came in yesterday morning?”
John bounced Maeve up and down gently and whispered to her, "did Daddy take you to the morgue to visit Molly?"
“You can’t get records?” Mycroft asked with a raised eyebrow.
Sherlock gave them one last look before heading towards the crime scene. John trotted to keep up with him. “Are you sure this is a good idea?”
“I always do.”
“Once.” He tilted his head slightly and continued to rub Maeve’s back.
It was a ceramics shop, more specifically the kind where you could paint your own pottery.
“You have a case.”
“I did though,” she flashed a smile.
“Has she eaten?”
“Scared?” Sherlock repeated, completely bewildered.
John stepped into the lounge five days later and was faced with Maeve, awake and kicking sat in a chair that was a beanbag with a strap to secure her to it. She was dressed in only a bodysuit with no sleeves or legs, red coloured skin on display as she stretched and jerked her limbs.
“I’ll make some tea” Mrs Hudson declared rising to her feet, John opened his mouth to protest but she shushed him, continuing “just this once though, I’m not your housekeeper.”
“If you recall, I was unable to calm her.”
Sherlock sighed. “Yes, any ideas?”
“A chemical defect. Love is a dangerous disadvantage.” Sherlock interjected.
Mycroft nodded. “My brother has taken it upon himself to chase down the criminal classes.”
“A cold case.” Sherlock explained. “Maeve gave me the idea, she is fantastic really.”
Maeve babbled on his knee. Her eyes were torn between all the twinkling lights and sparkling Christmas decorations that littered the living room.
“I never guess.” The dark haired man frowned and rose to a seated position. Maeve’s breathing faltered, he paused, then returned to normal and she remained undisturbed by the action.
“Fine”
Arabella smiled at him. “So you’re an uncle now Mycroft?”
“Then you’d never be able to rekindle your romance with my brother.”
“John has been aiding me.” Sherlock informed the other man.
John nodded. Maeve whined again and he twisted her around, so that her body was pressed against his chest and her head on his shoulder she immediately grabbed onto his t-shirt and started mouthing the fabric. He finally responded. “That’s good.”
Sherlock positioned Maeve to sit on his legs, with his hand beneath her chin supporting her sleepy head as he rubbed her back through the baby grow. Her eyes drooped lazily as though being awake was far too much effort but she continued to blink, as though the movement pained her. After a few moments, Sherlock pulled Maeve back to sit against his chest so that she was supported and her head was just poking above the table. Sherlock picked up one of the crisps on his plate and popped it into his mouth.
Mycroft cleared his throat. “She started crawling.”
“Yes.” She nodded with a small smile of relief.
Siger shot a look at his son. “He purposely makes things difficult.”
“Don’t blame her,” Violet said, plucking up a handful of wipes and moving towards her eldest son.
“When two people who like each other go out and have fun.” He sounded like a confused child. “You said it was perfect, me you and Maeve, you said it was perfect.”
“Isn’t it a bit early?” Mycroft asked. Of course, he’d been reading up on pregnancy and birth and babies and such in preparation, but it seemed early, even to him.
Sherlock knocked on his mother’s door.
Sherlock nodded.
“Sir” Donovan called out, coming out of the house with Anderson by her side. She looked confused and slightly amused by the sight of her boss with a pram. “Did you happen to sprout a baby?”
Mycroft found his father next to the buffet table.
She was lain on her stomach on her tummy time mat in front of the arch Sherlock had created, wearing nothing but a nappy with a legless and sleeveless baby grow over the top. Her blue eyes were wide and curious, stuck on him until she dropped her gaze back down to the colourful mat and gently lowered her head, face turned to the side to look at Sherlock. Her hair was longer now, not by much, and curling at the ends.
John sighed. He pushed himself up, face hovering above Sherlock’s for a moment and placed a chaste kiss on his plump lips. “Fine but you eat at lunch.”
“Last night.”
The sound of a cab pulling up outside the flat caught his attention and he looked up from his book, his eyes flicking first to the monitor. Maeve had not moved since he left the room. Her hands were beside her head, fingers curled and her mouth parted as she snored softly. Then, he let his eyes wander around the flat as he closed his book. He uncrossed his legs and placed the book on the left, with his right hand he smooth his right trouser leg. There was an unmistakable spot of baby rice close to his crotch and his jacket, which was hung over the door handle, baby vomit drying across the front and right shoulder.
“I’m a fan of your blog.” The newcomer admitted.
His mother plucked up the last of the many presents and began her routine again.
The rest of New Scotland Yard continued unaware of the explosive past few minutes in the conference room. The mundane sounds of footsteps, phones, officers chatting and joking around garbled like water dancing over a stone.
“I know you like to think you can take on the world but this is different.”
“Finished the nursery” John repeated. Sherlock had mentioned the nursery and Mycroft something about sorting it out, they must have been quick about it. “You’ve finished it already?”
Sherlock cursed inwardly and pulled the door. He left it ajar and walked down to stand beside Sherlock.
Sherlock glared at his brother.
His mother sighed. “She can have a normal plate.”
“Water for him” John said quickly before Sherlock could respond.
“And this is my niece,” the younger Holmes declared. “She looks…fully formed.”
He stepped in, one long elegant stride with the carseat held high in front of his torso and John a couple of steps behind him, legs and strides shorter than the taller man, carrying the baby bag on his shoulder. He smiled at Violet and placed the bag on the ground while he took off his coat, and Sherlock went straight into the house not bothering to take off his own coat.
“What are you doing?” John asked, voice rough from sleep but tone as low as he could manage.
“- is having with our three month old daughter. Shameful really,” he couldn’t suppress the smile. “Shameful.”
“Oh boys, what are you like?” Mrs Hudson asked the room.
“It seems that you haven’t had an easy run of it.” Harold said.
“About?”
“Not without its difficulties.” John admitted, “But Sherlock is…well, amazing. He’s just amazing.”
“This isn’t a question of your capability as a parent Mr Holmes, we are here to gather relevant information and come to a conclusion about what is best for Maeve.”
“Before you know it she’ll be too old to dress up, we might as well take advantage of it now.”
There was something calm about the flat.
“You’re a child.” John raised an eyebrow at him.
“She looks precious,” Violet announced.
Victor looked up, amazed and he admitted with a tone of awe. “You never cease to amaze me.”
“Want to head back?” John asked when Sherlock’s eyebrow twitched for the third time.
“No,” Sherlock shook his head. “I’m fine.”
Sherlock exhaled deeply.
Mycroft watched them all moved towards the back of the house and out of the patio doors. He then picked up the bags and took them upstairs, when he reached the top he pulled them towards the room. He tapped his knuckles against the door and pushed it open. Sherlock was lain on his side, eyes closed, with Maeve next to him. He placed the bag at the end of the bed and nodded once before leaving.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I’m sure that I can think of something.”
“Yeah, you’ll have to do with us.” He smiled and led his parents back towards Baker Street.
“Be serious Sherlock.” Siger snapped, losing his patience with his younger son. Not that he had much tolerance for him anyway. John looked wary. “You just stormed in to inform us we had a grandchild and left.”
Sunday lunch with the parents and a new topic for discussion arises: a christening.
“If it isn’t an inconvenience.” Sherlock muttered in distaste, hating that he had to ask his parents for something and the manners he was imploring.
Mycroft was not surprised. “Yes.”
“And?” John asked, taking over for Sherlock.
“Yes, we can see you.” He assured her.
“Do you need anything John?” Harold called after him.
“She’s not eating much,” Mycroft spoke aloud for the first time in twenty minutes.
Harry looked out of the window, then back at John. She smiled, and nodded towards the window. “That him?”
“And him, lucky to have you.” Harold confirmed.
“We don’t have anything except a night’s worth of supplies.” John added.
“The urine is a healthy colour. She has yet to do a stool.”
He handed her over to the consulting detective who had no choice but to take her, his frown deepened but Maeve smiled and moved towards his face as he brought her closer. He turned his face and allowed her to maul or kiss, his cheek. There was a trail of saliva left in her wake. He placed her on his chest, hand running down her back and over the small ridges of her spine. “Thank you.”
“Yet!” Sherlock snapped.
“It’s just that she’s what, seven or eight months?”
“Skype?” Sherlock sighed and looked down at the screen that was at the fair end of the table, pointed at him and Maeve, giving the government official a good view of them both from the laptop. He was sat at his desk, elbows on the desk and hands clasped together. He looked irritated.
Violet ignored the question and nodded towards her son’s scone. “Do you want me to cut that?”
Harry nodded. “Have you got much plans for the rest of your stay?”
“Sherlock Holmes” The doctor announced looking up from his chart sheet to the occupants of the waiting room, he watched as eight people stood up and turned their full attention to him. “Are you all family?”
“I’ll put her to bed.”
“Emily’s Instagram.” John guessed.
Mycroft stepped back to avoid the appearance of hovering.
“What have the doctors said?” John asked.
“Why does anyone do anything?” Sherlock asked.
Mycroft raised his eyebrow.
“Lestrade texted.” Sherlock said.
His shirt was wet with tears, saliva and snot.
A desperate attempt to clear his mind.
“You don’t have to believe me.” Jim said simply putting on an American accent.
They pulled up outside the manor a short time later. He stepped out the car with the car seat in one hand and his briefcase in the other. A security officer took the bag from the boot and opened the front door for him. He placed the bag inside the threshold and then shut the door behind him. Mycroft placed the car seat on the closest table and unstrapped his niece. When she was in his arms he stepped further into his house.
“I better get ready.” John announced and ducked into the hallway by the bedroom.
“It is a very real possibility.” John informed his dad. “I’m afraid there have been incidents already.”
” a sing-song Irish tone said, sounding put out, the pout coming across.
“Sherlock’s working a case at the moment. He was going over the file when I left, he’s probably coming up with a plan to catch the guy or something, now.”
“Why is it always me?” Sherlock asked. John snorted.
“I do.”
The scowl told him everything he needed to know. “Nothing,” he took a breath and hissed. “Isn’t it hateful?”
Harry’s frown deepened.
Greg nodded. “I’ll stop by after work.”
Maeve sneezed and looked affronted. He turned her around so that she was facing him, straddling one of his legs while he held her with two hands on her stomach.
“Yee-ah. He prefers the g-girls.” Robert answered.
The only sounds were the soft snores from the Moses basket against the wall in his bedroom as he closed the door, leaving his daughter shrouded in the bright stars of her nightlight. The monitor was on and already in the living room and John out, having dinner with Greg after work before returning to hear what Sherlock had discovered.
“Are you ok?” John asked, closing the door.
Angelo turned to John, the doctor smiled and said softly. “I’ll have the lasagne and Sherlock will have the carbonara.”
Lady Smallwood’s eyebrow rose slightly and she lifted her champagne close to her lips. “I was under the impression he wanted to you here for company, not to prove a point but what would I know.”
“Sherlock’s older brother,” John added.
And guys, please look for me on twitter and instagram because snippets do appear and I talk about my fic alot.
Sherlock widened his eyes but did just that, he held Maeve out to Molly and let her take her. She gave her glass to John and cradled the baby in her arms, eyes fixed on her.
Maeve gurgled and kicked her legs.
Violet took the opportunity to snap a few photos.
Sherlock scoffed, “you are far better at pretending but I have no need to pretend.”
“She’s so big now.” He continued.
“Yes, you marked that here.” The blonde looked back into the living room. “So, a productive day, was it?”
“Good behaviour.”
Sherlock nodded in agreement of the term.
“His mother, Margaret Ashcroft, married into money when he was ten,” Anthea informed them all. “He was arrested for assault at the age of thirteen but no charges were brought, his mother and step-father separated a week later, the divorce was finalised after three months.”
Mycroft said nothing. He sat back down in his seat.
“Greg.” John frowned. “Case?”
“Not semantics.”
The sound of conversation filtered upstairs but he ignored it.
“Shhhh.” Sherlock hushed his daughter, holding her tiny hand in his own. He was lain on his side, arm bent and supporting his head. John frowned in his sleep as he began to wake up.
Sherlock nodded and kissed the top of Maeves head again.
“I just want to give her breakfast.” Violet said, a little firmer, eyes flicking to Mycroft.
Sally was waiting by the door to Lestrade’s office with Anderson, not talking, just waiting and her eyes softened at the sight of him. Sherlock recognised the flashes of concern and relief, similar to the rest of the Yarders. “Coffee?”
“The papers mentioned Maeve,” Arabella broached out of concern for her oldest friend.
Sherlock closed his eyes and continued to rub his daughter’s back. “John has been in far worse situations, he is fully equipped to deal with an upset infant.”
“You boys have fun,” She told him.
Maeve jerked at the sound.
Sherlock attempted to moved his head and look away but Mycroft tightening his grip and kept his head steady. He continued, “If you don’t focus you will lose her.”
“I,” he cut himself off, “I saw it and couldn’t resist.”
“It was a non-verbal agreement but an agreement none the less. How am I supposed to trust you if you can’t keep a simple promise?” He sighed, “you uncle will hold this over me until the end of time. I know there’s no way that we can be here until the end of time but I’m exaggerating for effect, obviously.”
“You couldn’t have picked an easier gift,” Siger muttered.
“Consultant, for what?”
“Good morning Mrs Hudson.” John greeted, looking up from Maeve to smile at his landlady before looking back at Maeve and making faces at her. He’d seen Sherlock do it a few times in the hopes that she would copy, it was also a good exercise to learn the muscles in her face.
“Like you analyse or…?”
“That’s the point of Christmas,” John called back from the kitchen.
Sherlock, relishing in his new found freedom, sat up and moved closer to his partner. “My father is not an idiot, he was sure that she wouldn’t hurt Maeve.”
“It’s snowing.” He repeated.
“Sorry that took so long.” His father added with a lopsided smile.
“Thank you Mr Holmes.”
Sherlock tilted his head slightly, “you came back to London and didn’t ask for their help.”
“Alternatively, you could pick something mundane, like Chloe or Amy.”
“Yes, a case. Maybe another time.” Sherlock smirked at him suggestively.
The ex-army doctor frowned. “By ear?”
“Yes.” She looked down with a small surprised smile. “I knew you could read people like that but it’s a little unnerving when it’s happening to you.”
“It wasn’t the best of starts.” John concluded, managing a small smile. “But we are doing everything in our power to make sure that she is ok, more than ok, now. She needs us and we need her.”
“Yes.” Sherlock caught her eye in the mirror. “His partners may be consensual but the progression of his sadism would result in violent acts.”
“I do not envy you.” John told him as he stood up, “now I’ve got to get to work.”
“I’ve seen you in worse states.” Mycroft reminded him. He closed the toilet lid and sat on it. He decided to change the subject. “She likes the water.”
“How would you feel if Mycroft had done that to you and you were proposing to me?” His hands were on his hips now. That was never a good sign.
John sighed but picked them up.
“I’ve made dinner reservations.” Sherlock announced.
Sherlock lifted his head and nodded.
“But now he’s got John.”
“She wants kids.”
“No,” he said a little too quickly, he clarified in a softer tone, “she needs to be with me, I will talk to my mother.”
“Come on Sherlock, this is me you’re talking to.”
Mycroft grunted in surprise and grabbed the car seat before he could drop it (not that Sherlock would let that happen) and watched his younger brother stride into the house.
Mycroft spends his first Wednesday with Maeve and Sherlock takes some time away from her, it affects him more than he thought it would.
“Have you tried holding her?”
Mycroft pursed his lips. “You should talk to him.”
“This was an annual event,” Mycroft reminded him.
He wasn’t sure what he should do. Unsurety was not a feeling he was used to.
“Molly” Sherlock greeted.
“Sleeping.”
“You keep insisting that she is exceptional.” John reminded him.
“It is a bit Myc.” Violet said.
“They were out, at parties and Hope, was returning from studying late at a friend’s house, she left at eleven.” Sally told him, pausing only to look at files and clarify the information.
“I just-” Sherlock started as Mrs Hudson ascended the stairs with a ‘yoo-hoo boys’.
“Yes, you observe things are deduce from it.”
“I needed things,” he gestured wildly. His eyes narrowed. “She’s stopped crying.”
“And John?”
“I love you,” John told him.
John closed the bathroom door behind him and smiled at the sight of Sherlock stood in the doorway with Maeve in his arms, wrapped in a blanket, he was telling her about a case, an old one, something about a green ladder. His deep baritone low and rumbling in the quiet night air.
“She’s currently with a…” Greg trailed off unsure how to say it.
Sherlock looked up, confusion clouding his expression as his body remained focus on the task at hand, feeding Maeve. She drank eagerly as he asked, “For what?”
Violet looked up at her husband, not bothering to scold her son for his obscene language. Siger was having trouble processing the information, his eyes wide and not able to communicate anything at this present moment. His mother said, understanding. “And you’re sure that she’s pregnant?”
“I thought you were unaware of the slip.” Sherlock informed him, stabbing a piece of bacon.
Sherlock endorsed John with a small frown and quick words, “John worked as a doctor in the army, and he was a captain before he was shot. We were introduced through a mutual friend, they’d trained together at St. Bart’s hospital, and it’s where we met.”
“Her face lit up when you let her see Maeve properly for the first time.”
He looked up at the sound of someone approaching. The quick practiced footsteps told him that it was his brother and he turned to face him. Sherlock had calmed down somewhat but his expression was cold and calculated, his eyes flicked over them both in one intense flick. He stopped in front of them.
He handed John a wrapped up bottle.
“You have a right to know these things,” Sherlock informed him, “we are together.”
“Bunny rabbits.” He corrected.
“Well?” He raised an eyebrow expectantly.
Maeve looked up at him and blinked, blue eyes big and curious. She gave him a small smile which disappeared the moment Sherlock began rubbing the shampoo into her dark hair. She whined in protest but Sherlock continued, spreading the soap in small delicate circles while she fidgeted, unable to move in his hold but continuing to fight him.
“Princess.” He whispered to her. There were tears streaming down her reddened face and dribble pooling at the corners of her mouth. He gestured to the purple baby bag and John picked it up for him, he grabbed the muslin on top and wiped her face quickly and methodically.
Mycroft was sat at the table with his first coffee of the morning when his brother strode in as though he owned the place. Security had not called so they were unaware that he was here.
“What similarities?”
“He helped you?” Siger asked, confusion clouding his expression.
“And that’s adorable?” John asked, raising an eyebrow.
“What do we know about him?” Mycroft asked. He stripped himself of his suit jacket and placed it on the back of the chair to his brother’s immediate right.
“Yes, that’s better. A nice cool bath.” He ran his hand down her arm. She immediately grabbed his hand and craned her neck awkwardly to look at him.
“And what of Sherlock?” Beatrice asked. She was just looking for trouble now, she knew about the difficult relationships and that the younger Holmes had had some troubles. She was being particularly bitchy today.
Maeve gurgled and squirmed against him.
John nodded. “Whatever you need to do.”
“And your mother?” Harold asked.
"6lbs 10oz" Sherlock reminded him.
The three ladies were sat comfortably at the kitchen table while Violet hurried around the kitchen, putting the finishing touches on the soup that was being kept warm on the stove. “Everything is fine, Sherlock has been discharged from hospital and is recovering.”
A black car pulling up beside her pulled her from her thoughts.
“You didn’t have to go to any trouble.” Silvia told him. They’d settled in the armchairs, Harold in Sherlock’s armchair and Silvia in John's. Greg was now leaning against the desk, eyes glancing over his shoulder at the cat that was still behind him.
Mycroft answered with a simple nod and followed his brother, eyes flicking over the haggard blonde and reading everything of interest. It may come in handy later.
“Yeah,” Anthea agreed, “he’s a good dad.”
John nodded. “I reserved some books.”
“You changed her.” Sherlock observed.
Maeve eye’s seemed to be fixed on one piece of snow. She watched it fall and when it got too low she looked up and followed another piece with her eyes. Sherlock watched her with fond eyes.
The baby in question was resting over his shoulder after he had fed, burped her and decided the moment he removed the muslin to spit up milk over his shoulder and down his back. He wished it was only his pyjamas but he was freshly cleaned and dressed in a new suit, jacket hung over the back of the chair.
They started eating, Sherlock spinning his spaghetti carbonara around his fork and plopping it delicately into his mouth. John stabbed a piece of penne and ventured, “Do you mind?”
It was disconcerting. Sherlock had become accustomed to the stares as he strode through New Scotland Yard, the hard glares and muttered words as he ignored them, face harsh and coat billowing out dramatically behind him. Something he was not accustomed to the small smile of pity and flashes of concern then replaced by relief. The wide eyes of Yarders followed him as he strode through the building at a slightly slower pace, Maeve snuggled tightly against his chest between his shirt and open blazer, her quiet snores only audible to his ears as he moved with John close behind. The army doctor carrying the slack with the baby bag hooked over his shoulder and buggy, fixed with the car seat instead of the pram setting.
“My homeless network…” he trailed off at the confused look on her face. “I pay the city’s homeless to help me find people that have committed murders or places where crimes are going to be committed.”
“Its injections Sherlock, she needs them.” John shrugged.
Sherlock smiled despite himself, constantly surprised that John was able to extract such reactions from him.
“How could you not tell us?” Violet asked, hurt.
“Thank you Mrs. Hudson.” John called back.
The park was empty except for the occasional dog walker.
“Different companies,” John said, annoyed with himself.
Sherlock’s expression was thunderous as he looked up and noticed that his suspect was walking away from the diner. He cleared his throat and glanced at his sleeping daughter one last time before ducking away from the car and immersing himself in the crowds. Mycroft closed the door with his free hand.
“You Sherlock Holmes are a fun sucker.”
“I am perfectly capable.” He said, stretching his arms towards his mother, fingers twitching.
Sherlock nodded and continued to sooth his daughter. “Daddy’s here.”
“I fell backwards, pushed him back down, and then we bumped heads.”
“Yes.” He nodded.
“I do not plan on her leaving my arms for the foreseeable future.”
“A particular kind?”
“Is she usually good?” David asked.
“Mother’s friends are here” Mycroft observed, nose scrunching up in distaste.
“Yes, shhhh now,” he hushed gently, eyes carefully avoiding the two other men. “Daddy has work to do, so be a good girl, be a good girl for daddy.”
The notion of a family tradition at Halloween probably seemed ridiculous to most British families, yes it was celebrated but not to the same extent that the American’s seemed to celebrate. Sherlock had always thought Halloween was fascinating and his passion for dressing up as a kid, though long gone, was something he always remembered at this time of year. He had once gone trick or treating with his brother around the houses closest to theirs and now, that tradition was being repeated with his daughter thought they were not going to stranger’s houses. They were doing the rounds, so to speak, visiting the immediate family which in this case meant his mother and father. In the absence of sweets, they were gifting her with some toys.
Lunch consisted of a sandwich from a cafe down the road, a tea for John and coffee for Sherlock. They strolled through the park with disposable cups in their hands, John a little out of pace and Sherlock with one trained hand on he handle of the pram, manoeuvring it through the people as they walked. There was very little peace in London, the city was packed full of life and bustling with all kinds of people that worked in the city or were just visiting as tourists. The capital was never a quiet place, except at night and in the mornings but it struck John as odd how well Sherlock had adapted to include a baby into his routine.
Mycroft tapped his foot.
“I don’t know. He said he needed to get something and rushed out.” John admitted, stepping into the kitchen with Mrs Hudson a step behind him.
“She’s six months old.” Sherlock reminded him.
“No, I have some paperwork that requires my attention. But feel free to make use of your usual room.” Mycroft offered knowing his brother would decline.
John smirked. “You ok, Greg?”
.” Moriarty informed him.
“I am fully aware,” he sniffed and looked back down at the file.
“Yoo-hoo.” Mrs Hudson called as she entered the room. Her face lit up when she spotted Maeve on John’s legs smiling at the army doctor. She held a tray with a pot of tea, saucers and cups. It was her white set with butterflies on, a present from Sherlock a few Christmas’ ago and she only got it out when making the boys tea or for special guests.
There was a beat of silence.
I will update as soon as possible.
Sherlock nodded in acknowledgement but said nothing, he watched his mother and daughter as they settled down for their own photos. It started on the sofa, then moved onto a few of them by the fireplace. Kelly then had them in the kitchen, it was more often or not where you would find his mother and seemed fitting. Siger joined in afterwards, so that the three of them had some photos together and then the two of them alone, his father and Maeve. Sherlock stayed close enough to keep Maeve interested.
Mycroft nodded and they rushed down the hallway towards his office. The sounds of Maeve crying flooded the hallway, getting louder and louder the closer they got to his office. The desks in his reception area were empty and Anthea rushed through, opening the door for her boss. Mycroft stepped into the room, his eyes immediately settling on his receptionist Lewis, flustered and holding a very red and distressed infant.
“I never expected to see you with a kid,” Victor admitted, eyes flicking back to the consulting detective.
“No, that’s not what I meant. John’s a good guy, he’d help any way he could and he’s always wanted children.”
"John" Sherlock broke through his lightheartedness, tone severe and grey eyes like a storm. He watched Maeve entertain herself with the collar of John's shirt and softened his tone slightly, going as far as feigning politeness, something that didn't come naturally to the consulting detective. "If you wouldn't mind removing my stitches, it would be much appreciated."
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and turned to face and equally impressed looking Mycroft.
Mrs Hudson bustled in, looked around the room and then settled her gaze on Sherlock and frowned, “really, Sherlock, the mess you’ve made.”
There were a few supportive smiles from other parents in the waiting area. John lead him out, holding open the doors for his partner and the distressed infant. The car was waiting for them, the driver opened the door and stepped away to allow them access. Sherlock ducked into the car with Maeve and slid across to allow John room to place the car seat in there.
“We, us, this is new, it’s a bit early in a relationship for family photographs but you included me, you didn’t even think about it.” The blonde explained, looking down at the baby between them and fondly stroking her head as she drank. Her eyes flicked up to him for a moment, and then back to Sherlock with the realisation that it was John touching her and now some random stranger.
“Fine,” Sherlock snapped.
“I can’t.” Sherlock interrupted. His eyes flicked over the occupants of the room, Sally had lowered her head and was pretending (badly but with good intentions) to look at the case file while Anderson looked out of the window. “I can’t imagine what these parents are going through, and, I can’t, I won’t be able to think if she’s taken away from me.”
“Exactly, now you’re understanding.”
Sherlock looked vaguely amused and looked down. The pyjamas and dressing gown were black silk.
“A case?”
An employee had filled the car with the necessary items while Sherlock watched, hiding behind the netting.
“Fine.” Sherlock offered.
He walked her into the bedroom but left the door open so that Sherlock could see them.
Sherlock managed to roll his eyes. “Oh, please do shut up, I’ve got a concussion.”
“Thank you.” John smiled, put down his umbrella and stepped into the café.
“But she needs stability.” His mother argued.
John couldn’t help the smile that settled on his face at his partner’s words, Edmund noticed and nodded. Petunia asked, “And you help with Maeve?”
There was an audible click of a pistol.
Violet raised her eyebrows. “Shocked?”
It went against Sherlock’s aloof nature but he was once again at the New Scotland Yard in the midst of a party which meant that the majority of the staff were drunk. Sherlock cradled his daughter close to his chest, you couldn’t catch inebriation but you could stupidity, and there was no way he was infecting his daughter with the stupidity of the metropolitan police force. She was focused on the collar of his coat, her fingers roaming over the material as he swayed slightly from side to side.
“I regret letting you move in with me, you’ve become
“And you,” he returned. He could be polite and charming like Mycroft.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow but said nothing. The photographer looked uncomfortable but not nervous.
“I abhor repetition.” He threw his head back. “You can see her every Sunday, you can visit and we will drop in on occasion, you can watch her for long running cases, I’ll even spend a week with you during summer. I cannot raise her alone, alone I will ruin her. I want you involved, you and…father.”
“You’re getting sentimental in your age.” Sherlock looked horrified.
Maeve opened her mouth and Sherlock pushed the teething ring into her mouth. She grabbed at his hand and started chewing on the cold ring, her expression a mixture of emotions before settling on ‘this is probably ok.’ Her eyes flicked to John in a ‘look Papa’ way.
There were sounds of footsteps on the stairs and Mrs Hudson poked her head around the doorway. “Is everything alright John?”
“Worth leaving the house?”
in the morning.”
“The pinnacle of fatherhood, using your daughter as a protective shield against a mother,” John added.
Mycroft remained for the next hour, tea and biscuits provided by Mrs Hudson who then busied herself with cleaning the flat (just this once though) and Sherlock entertained Maeve will a session of tummy time. The flat cleaned, Mycroft and Mrs Hudson gone Sherlock spent the rest of the day reading to Maeve as they sat together in his chair, her sat on his laps looking at the book.
Maeve gurgled.
“I have a deal for you,” Jim announced.
John did just that, he watched. The pair of them waited, wrapped up together in blankets with baby Maeve sleeping soundly, until the first glimmer of light appeared on the horizon behind the shadows of the trees and long expanses of garden. They watched the sun rise with abundance of colour until the room was full of light and the garden shedding its coat of dew in way for another beautiful summer day.
“The next one.” Sherlock nodded towards the other box.
"Hello sweetheart" John greeted her, voice soft and full of affection. He reached out and took her from the consulting detective, lifting her high above his head, she reached for him with small hands.
“Time for something to eat then.”
Sherlock knocked on the door instead of just walking in, he wanted to make a good impression. A moment later the door swung open, his Mother looked shocked at the sight of him and the pram on the doorstep. She was dressed in a simple but elegant light blue day dress with a matching blazer. There was a flower pin on her collar and her hair was pulled back in a neat arrangement.
“So,” Sherlock turned to his daughter. “You started crawling.”
“It’s not fair and you know it.”
Siger put his hand on hers and squeezed. “It won’t be much longer.”
“You shouldn’t do things like that,” John managed between laughing. “She might copy you.”
“It’s Greg.” John corrected chuckling.
“Where is my baby boy?” She asked as she reached the top step and stepped into the flat, eyes falling of her son with an expression of pure joy, the kind that often got confused with sadness, as tears began to gather in the corner of her eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you have a big family?” She asked, her crying settling down now.
“Life.” Mycroft defined.
“He dumped the body there. In and out, nothing at the scene or on the body.” he confirmed.
Anthea seemed pleased with the answer. “Do we have to give her back? We could keep her.”
“I can’t take you anywhere.” He said simply.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. Why was John asking so many questions? Nerves.
Sherlock stepped closer to the body. The victim was on the floor, back arched with a leg caught underneath her body and arms flailed out messily, she was positioned as she fell then. Neck snapped, bruising around the throat obvious and her eyes wide open and glassy. She was underneath Whistlejacket, a George Stubbs painting of a horse of its hinds legs.  But, her head was looking back with her eyes focused (as much as a dead persons eyes could be focused) on The Fighting Temeraire, a Joseph Mallord William Turner painting.
“Your mother suggested some natural shots,” Kelly answered, glancing up from the camera.
“Did you want a drink?”
Greg nodded in his direction and stretched out slightly, Mycroft managed a small smile that was faked but well meant. “Good evening.”
The familiar faces of his army buddies littering the pub, all with pints in their hands and cheery grins on their faces. He sighed, bracing himself for the onslaught and was manhandled by two of the larger lads: Brian and Thompson, and pushed towards the bar.
“No.”
“The scratched on the doorbell,” Victor looked confused.
John steered Sherlock down the hallway into the bedroom with one hand on his shoulder and the other cradling Maeve as she slept. He commanded, “Bed.”
Violet came back into the room with a tray and one of his nice tea sets. She watched her so, blue eyes pleading. “I am not worried about you Sherlock.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I’m just…”
“Not entirely, there are factors which result in you having children.”
“She slept the whole flight.” John commented.
“And Mycroft will oversee.” Sherlock told her as he reached down to wipe some drool from his daughter’s face.
Claire shrugged and stabbed a piece of cucumber with her fork. “I don’t think it will ever be too early to learn how to push a baby-”
“No.”
Sherlock nodded and watched her leave. John appeared by his side, “shall we?”
Sherlock took her from him and immediately placed her against his chest. She looked up at him for a moment before settling happily against him and sighing loudly in content.
“Skin to skin contact is very important, she gets to explore my skin and knows my scent. She can touch unhindered and can see me clearly.” He answered, happy to share with his mother. “She cannot only hear my voice but feel it, she knows my voice and face completely.”
“I could take her for you, just this once mind you.”
“No.” John’s eyes were soft but unyielding, much like the man himself.
“For weekends and days off.”
Edward stepped forward and placed a hand on his wife’s shoulder. “Mycroft, if you have something to tell us, just say it. You don’t have to be afraid.”
“A child born out of wedlock, how mundane of you, brother mine.” The younger Holmes quipped.
“Thank you.”
Victor stepped back and sat down in the waiting chair. “So, the years treated you well.”
“I’m well aware.”
“I hate you.” He told her with no real bite. He sighed and crossed the room to stand in front of her, he ran his hand over Maeve’s head. Her eyes opened slowly and she yawned against his mother’s neck. He craned his neck and placed a single kiss atop of her head and looked up at his mother through his lashes. “Take care of her.”
“Right.” Sherlock managed.
“Formality.”
“You ordered take out?”
He ran his hand down her towel covered back. “Yes, I know.”
“It’s ok, Daddy is right here. I won’t leave you. Just close your eyes.”
“They didn’t give me a chance.” Sherlock argued.
“What?” Sherlock was lost.
“Yes, you do.”
Sherlock and Mycroft waiting until they left the room before relaxing. Mycroft stepped closer to his brother and ran his hand down the infants back. “Is she ok?” He asked.
Maeve still had her eyes closed but her face was scrunching up and she was now wiggling beneath her blankets. He reached in and pulled the covers from her, bunching them at her feet and pulling off her mittens. She wouldn’t need them inside. He then dragged his finger over her small red face in small soft movements. She pursed her lips. “Time to wake up.” He encouraged her in a low soft tone.
“No.”
“Mrs Hudson will want to hold, well,
Sherlock snorted in incredulity, eyes flicking swiftly from his brother to Maeve, “like you don’t already know.”
There was silence. Siger could only blink in response. Violet managed to mutter in disbelief. “You got somebody pregnant.”
Sherlock’s eyes focused on his daughter. He didn’t smile. He did push the soft bee toy closer to her. “No.”
“Her mind is like a sponge, constantly absorbing information.”
“Come, take a seat.” Mycroft offered politely gesturing to the empty chair on his right.
Sherlock shook his head. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
“She’s a baby Sherlock, you can hardly control her behaviour and nor should you.”
Sherlock shucked off his coat and placed it over the door. Without a word, he stepped further into the living room and picked up his laptop, a quick check for cases would take but a moment.
Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement. “Did you have a good day with your Papa?”
Maeve sighed in her sleep but didn’t wake up, her face scrunched up against his neck and her hands balled into firsts in his shirt. John turned and looked back down the hallway that they’d just walked down.
“You go get her,” Sherlock huffed, looking up at the ceiling.
Harry nodded towards Maeve, “and she’s ok?”
“Robert must not be playing,” Sherlock articulated.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at the blonde and then looked forward.
John opened his mouth to respond but simply shut it again, there was no point. When they reached a hallway Sherlock gestured to one on the right side, he then went ahead and opened the door, stepping into the room quickly. John followed. It was dark blue, almost purple with charts and medical posters tacked to the walls. There were books and notepads in neat stacks and a desk covered with pieces of paper. The bed was large and made, grey sheets with a comforter and pillows. Sherlock continued to bounce Maeve in his arms until she was almost settled, the only reminder of her shock a quivering lip. With a dramatic sigh the detective dropped onto the bed, landing on his back with a soft thud and his daughter tight against his chest.
John gave him a ‘of course you’re right’ look. And finished with the cream. He picked her up, leaving the towel wrapped her around the bottom half of her body and placing her in a sitting position on his lap, staring out at Sherlock. He lent down and kissed the top of her head.
“I’d be honoured Sherlock.” Molly smiled.
Sherlock arrived at 8:01, the case was finished and he wanted nothing more than to return to Baker Street with his daughter. The house was quiet, the door swinging open and bouncing off the wall loudly. John cursed and followed the taller man, carefully shutting the door behind him as he struggled to keep up with his partner. Sherlock was already off, eyes flicking over every room he passed.
The gardens were well-maintained: long expanses of freshly cut grass and vivid flowers arranged neatly in the border, tall trees and clean pathway that wove through the gardens. In the centre, as she walked from the house there was a large ornate fountain that hadn’t been switched on in years. They walked in unison, Sherlock taking slightly smaller strides so that John didn’t struggle to keep up, and at a leisurely pace. His left hand was placed on John’s lower back, clasping at the shirt beneath his fingers and leading the blonde through the garden. He had Maeve strapped into her papoose, body facing his and other hand cradling her head protectively as she slept.
Sherlock shook his head.
Maeve closed her eyes again.
Sherlock frowned and nodded.
“You do know how to feed a baby, don’t you?” Sherlock asked.
“John,” a voice called.
“Nothing?” John asked, “No hairs or fibres.”
Sherlock slid out of his seat and into the open air.
“You’re under the impression that she’s attempting to access your house for your work.”
“You shouldn’t do things like that,” John managed between laughing. “She might be copy you.”
“Yes, I suppose, if you like Satan’s pet.”
“There could be some clue to his location.”
“How old is she?” John asked, getting to his feet and looking down on the consulting detective.
He tilted his head slightly as they walked. “It’s not always that easy, there are normally various leads to follow and people to interview, I gathered all I could from the notes and compiled them into what I know about the killer, it was easy to track down possible locations on his previous crimes and victimology. The other possible locations I will make impossible to use, he will only be able to use the location that we will be waiting at and we will stop him before he hurts another person.”
Sherlock nodded and slipped the dressing gown from his shoulder, letting the silk material pool at his feet. He glanced at Maeve one more before slipping into bed, the side closest to his daughter, beside the army doctor. He was on his back, looking up at the ceiling. “My mother wants to have lunch.”
Mycroft sighed and pulled Maeve away from his chest. Sherlock placed his hands underneath her arms and pulled her close, she kicked excitedly, landing one or two feet in his ribs before settling against his, sighing in content and mouthing at his neck. He felt the tension melt away from his body but kept his rigid position and hard expression, not wanting to reveal anything to Mycroft.
“It’d been two years Sherlock, what was I supposed to think?”
Maeve gurgled.
“Yes” Sherlock responded, putting the phone back in his pocket and steering once again with two hands instead of one. “It’s just round the corner.”
His patience was wearing thin.
“Oh no, someone didn’t follow her routine.” John drawled sarcastically.
“Yes, I know sweetheart.” He cooed.
“This is no laughing matter, Mr Holmes.” Michelle snapped. Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
“And did it?”
“Is it?” Sherlock asked, once again, bros furrowing.
“Maeve was at the flat but the intruder was not alerted to her presence” Siger began to explain, he hated that he had to justify his son to these women, though he didn’t mind Arabella, it was the gossip Beatrice he loathed.
“If you have any ideas about the names or need anything, don’t hesitate to call for me. I’ll be just down the hall, it’s a quiet night, and you’ll be doing me a favour.”
“That makes two of us,” The consulting detective admitted with a lopsided smile in Maeve’s direction.
“She won’t sleep?” Carol asked, retaking her seat and genuinely interested in the conversation. She was deflecting of course, not wanting to talk about her daughter at this present time.
“With seven police officers. You are hardly at fault.”
“Right.” John nodded.
John chuckled and Greg sighed, Mycroft simply rolled his eyes. “She’s been fine.”
“What isn’t?” Sherlock asked with a sigh. He scooped up his daughter and stood up.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “I don’t have to be here.”
John hummed contently and Sherlock’s arms around his chest tightened pulling him impossibly closer. “How long will she sleep for?”
“Thank you, Mr Holmes.” Emma handed Sherlock the card back over the counter and began bagging the last of the items. John was waiting by the new pram, cradling Maeve in his shorter arms. Sherlock nodded and picked up the two bags on the counter – everything else was being delivered within the next few hours. The sales assistant added quickly. “If you ever need anything, you know where we are.”
“Yes, I’m heading back there now. Just came to get changed.” He explained.
“We have matters to discuss,” Violet announced, taking her seat at the head of the table and clasping her hands in front of her.
“She only woke up a couple of times.”
“So we look for clues at the scene, anything that can lead us to this…man!” John hissed the last word, obviously wanting to replace it with something more vulgar but stopping himself last minute with a glance at the snoring baby. “He must have tools of some sort that he uses and transports.”
He placed another kiss on her skin and didn’t bother to move his lips this time, he spoke against her skin, “I’m so sorry.”
“Can we just, stop this, for a moment?” He asked. Harry considered it but nodded slowly.
Sherlock merely raised his eyebrow. Jasper looked at the ground and walked away.
“I will take her home the moment the phone rings and I talk to him, you can arrange the meeting points and ransom drop, and I won’t come back until you call me.” Sherlock promised, grey eyes unwavering.
Sherlock felt satisfied. It was a simple pleasure, his nose pressed into his daughter’s hairline and inhaling the calming scent of his daughter. She smelt clean and like baby powder, her own scent lingering beneath it. He pushed open the bedroom door with his hip and stepped into the room. The light was out but the bedside table lamps were on, John was sat up with a pair of glasses perched on his nose and a book in hand. He looked up at Sherlock, a fond smile settling on his face.
“I was trying to help.”
“She’s tired.” John observed.
“It’s not all about the books.” Greg said quickly.
“She is your granddaughter.”
Sherlock flashed fake smile.
John nodded.
“No, don’t change the subject, your life is far more interesting. Have you thought of any names yet?”
He nodded and strode towards the bedroom.
“You landed on your back,” Mycroft deduced, “Gregory tripped over your legs, backwards, hit the back of his head and pushed you back down, you bumped heads and Gregory hit his chin on the wall when he untangled himself from you.”
Sherlock nodded and angled his head to face Victor once more. “Then, it appears we’d be delighted to join you for dinner.”
“I doubt she’d like dry flaky skin.” Sherlock said simply.
“I just didn’t feel like drinking” John dismissed, dropping the toy onto his lap and taking Maeve’s hands into his own. He moved them around in fast but not too strenuous circles mimicking dance moves.
“I wish,” Greg snorted, continuing to bounce the baby in small movements in an attempt to keep her content, “She belongs to Sherlock Holmes, our consultant.”
“Do you want to look for her?”
“Without intruding,” Sherlock ignored Greg’s shocked expression, “you’re both idiots.”
Maeve whined as she settled against his chest, not at all happy with being woken up as per usual. He jiggled her up and down slightly while whispering to her in his usual voice, just a quieter tone than usual. “Are you going to help Daddy solve a crime? Yes, of course you are, you’re a conductor of light, just like John, but better. You are far more intricate.”
“Yes, I want to see the lions too.”
When he was finished he let go of the sponge and picked Maeve up out of her seat, careful with the extra wetness to support her body completely. He positioned her in his favourite way, with her pressed against him, head facing his neck and hands sprawled against his wet chest. He picked up the sponge and ran it down her back.
So, they waited.
Sherlock ignored her. His eyes unforgiving as he focused on his father. “I am clean.”
Sherlock with his new found freedom scanned the room and gracefully sat down in one of the armchairs.
“You cook simple, comfort foods.”
“Sherlock, really?”
“Sherlock” his mother scolded, swatting at his arm as she reached to pick up a round soft bee toy that had somehow found its way under the coffee table. Sherlock caught sight of the toy in his mother’s hand and reached towards her with his free arm, missing the toy but the intention clear. She sighed and handed it to him, “you’re such a child.”
He picked up the small owl toy from the floor and handed it to her. She took it in both her hand and smoothed it against her face which she simultaneously dropped her head to rest on his shoulder. He walked to the bedroom and picked up the small white nike trainers, that John called stupid, and then back into the kitchen, pausing in the threshold. He sat her on the side, keeping his eyes on her as he put on her shoes, wrestling them onto her small feet. Jade jumped onto the side, meowing loudly, and rubbed herself against Maeve, who in response dropped her toy and clutched at her fur and dropped her head onto the cat. Maeve meowed loudly and continued to rub her face against Maeve’s, purring as she did so.
Mycroft recognised the imitation and smiled at him. He kissed the top of Maeve’s head, lips lingering on the spot. Sherlock pried the bracelet away from her, kissing her fingers as apology and fastened the bracelet around her wrist, Maeve looked at it, frowning before smiling up at him.
“These are looking good,” Kelly informed him as she moved around and continued to snap pictures.
“They would be thrilled, a grandchild at last.” Mycroft told them, glancing at John, the only one who hadn’t yet met his parents. “Of course, they wouldn’t let her end up in care, we Holmeses stick together, they would be quite content raising her. Thrilled really.”
It was nice to hear his son happy again.
Sherlock was playing the violin when John walked in with Maeve.
Carol smiled. “How old?”
“Till then” Sherlock said in farewell.
“Everyone ok?” He asked
Sherlock did, he turned to face his mother and waited while she took photos.
They fed the cat on the small breakfast bar. It a precautionary measure; once Maeve was able to move around on her own, she would be able to reach the food and possibly eat it, instead they would get Jade into a routine from the start. The cat gobbled down the food in the small pink ceramic bowl, occasionally pausing to look up at the two men in the kitchen or lick her lips.
“It’s not exactly appropriate is it?”
“I will do my utmost to bring your son back to you,” he promised with a forced smile.
“Help me to.”
He heaved a sigh and walked down the hallway towards the living room.
“I’m just making conversation Sherlock.”
He continued with a prayer and verse from the bible. Then, he invited Sherlock and the godparents to stand with him, close to the font. Sherlock stood begrudgingly, forced to peels Maeve’s hands from John, which she was no happy about, she whined loudly which caused a few laughs in the pews. He pacified her by rocking her gently in his arms. He took his place between Greg and Molly, the former looked amused at how out of place Sherlock looked.
“And what will you be doing darling?”
Sally nodded and got to her feet. She left the room.
“You know something?” He deduced.
“Gregory, what is wrong with you?” Mycroft asked, setting down his knife and fork.
“Do you know why?”
“Thank you.” John stood and he took the phone from his partner’s extended hand. “You came all this way to give me my phone.”
“I can feel my brain rotting,” Sherlock grumbled.
“Go for walks in the park, spend all day on the sofa, is this what you do?” He asked, specifying. “Is this being a parent?”
“Mummy is looking for you,” Mycroft informed him.
“My arms ache.” Sherlock admitted. He lifted the sleeping baby away from his chest and handed her to John, who took her and placed her in the same position. She stirred but did not wake.
“Do you need anything before I go?”
"She's put on just under two pounds" John looked happy, "that's exactly what we're looking for at this stage of her development. 1-2lbs per month in the first six months."
“We should go back in,” Mycroft said with no inclination to move.
“Where is he?” John asked. The worry in his tone was sharp.
Greg came out of his office and placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Alright?”
“No.” John answered, eyes flicking up to meet Sherlock’s stormy ones. “Is this the victims?”
“Can I get you anything?” A barista with a bleach blonde pixie cut asked as he shook off his coat and took his seat, putting his blue scarf into his pocket.
“She’s so much like Sherlock,” There was awe in her voice.
“But, what about Moriarty?” Sally asked. “There’s no way that we can trust him.
“So, what is this gift?” Siger cleared his throat and smiled at his granddaughter.
John rolled his eyes. “Maeve, come to Papa, let’s leave these two to mingle.”
“Did you want her back?” Greg asked.
Maeve stopped crying almost immediately, sniffling as he placed one large hand on the back of her head and gently forced it against his shoulder so that her face was angled towards his neck, body pressed against his chest. Sherlock relaxed but only John noticed, trained in noticing the unnoticeable in the consulting detective. His neck was less strained and his back, still straight seemed to go a little more lax like his arms, which were strong but comfortable, holding his daughter like she was the most precious thing in existence. It pained him to let her cry but she had to learn, he might not always be there and though that thought made his stomach drop, he needed her to be ok.
“No,” Sherlock raised one eyebrow and reminded him, “I cannot read your mind.”
Lestrade met them at the corner with a small smile and lead them towards his office. “Good to see you.”
“No, he’s well, he’s his usual charming self.”
Sherlock looked up at him with a neutral expression.
I've had some absolutely lovely comments, so thank you!
He’d discovered very little and Lestrade was expecting enough evidence to convict both Louise Fowler and Howard Lewis of murder. The duo (he suspected this was due to Louise) had left no fingerprints or fibres on the body or at the scene. It was rather brilliant, though as John would say ‘a bit not good’ and the good doctor was right, a team capable of getting away with murder was rather…bad.
Sherlock placed the fork on his plate and placed both his hands on his knee. He sighed, “Well, this is tedious.”
“Thank you” John said, taking the seat beside the consulting detective.
Mycroft paused at the sight, his brother was lain out on the bed on his side, body angled towards his sleeping daughter. She was holding one of his long finger and his other hand absentmindedly running over her shoulder and down her arm. He was in his mind palace, completely focused on something else but he was completely aware that Maeve was there.
“One hundred and seventy-one days,” Sherlock articulated.
“I didn’t.”
“And is she moving?”
Mycroft hummed thoughtfully, “yes, bigger and stronger.”
John shrugged. “Same difference.”
Maeve grinned at him.
Maeve whined loudly, a warning that she was upset and more would make her cry. Sherlock’s attention was on her, watching her face for any change and he jiggled her softly. John twisted to check that she was ok, cleared his throat and turned back to Harry. “You want to be in my life; fine, but you need to accept that Sherlock will be in my life-“
John shook his head slowly. “We made different choices, Harry’s was alcohol.”
“Thank you.” John said, stepping back to allow him into the room.
Everyone is worried when they finds newspapers with Sherlock and Maeve on the cover and fear that the consulting detective is gone, but really he's just taken Maeve swimming for the first time.
“For who?” Greg pursed his lips and didn’t answer. He ignored the pointedly looks he received from the pair of them. Anderson repeated. “For who?”
His eyes flicked to the bathroom. His father nodded and stepped into the room, closing the door behind him.
“Well, she’s going to get messy. It’s unavoidable.” His mother continued.
She shook her head. “He wasn’t on the line long enough.”
“Because the little terror would never spit up on her papa.”
“No, I’d rather not.” He admitted.
The scene before him could only be described as anarchy, complete anarchy. There were police cars parked at all angles across the street with officers controlling the scene and two ambulances parked beside Gregory’s silver BMW, one empty and the other with two paramedics waiting eagerly by the open doors.
John sighed and stood up, bringing Maeve with him with one arm wrapped across her torso. She hiccupped and glanced around in confusion, her cries stopped for a second. She looked up at John, eyes wet and face covered in tears, dribble and snot, then looked back down at the bath. She hiccupped and started sobbing.
The door creaked open and Violet walked into the room, she practically sung. “Don’t mind me.”
“Yes.” Sherlock looked down at his daughter. “She’s very strong.”
“Gregory has been decorating the house with his kids today.”
“Cheeky?” he repeated sounding surprised and disgusted. He looked down at Maeve, her eyes were shut but she was not yet asleep again, only attempting to sleep. “Do you think I’m cheeky?”
“Don’t get grumpy. People are allowed to have crushes on me.”
Greg’s cheeks reddened and he smiled, that perfect smile that Mycroft adored so much. “That was extremely romantic Mr Holmes.”
“I need to see your house” Sherlock said with a smile.
John shrugged. “He is a man of many talents.”
“And you wouldn’t have slept if you went down there, in fact, you would have found something, anything else to do.” John raised an eyebrow.
“I know.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed.
“I’m going to kill Mummy.” Sherlock said to Maeve, his tone soft.
“Oh.”
It was obvious they didn’t get much visitors with prams.
A floorboard creaked that made him pause in his track, stopping mid-step and eyes darting over the darkened flat in search of the source. The doorway connecting the hallway to the kitchen was ajar, the glass doors of the kitchen open and living room seemingly empty. He glanced over his shoulder, Maeve was sleeping and Mrs Hudson out for the night.
