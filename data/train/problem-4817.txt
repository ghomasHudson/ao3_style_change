“Yes!” Castiel flung his arms up to get his point across. “If I don’t hate you—if you’re not like every alpha in the world, then it means maybe I’ve been wrong about myse—“ Castiel’s throat closed before he could finish and he had to swallow several time before he could talk again. “It means I’ve been wrong about other things in my life, too.”
Dean bolted up and stared at Castiel in offense. The fact that he would even
‘...so I request your arrival at the quickest pace possible…’
“Thank god for fairy magic,” Benny said. He and Sam sat down, not looking at Cas as they each took an oar and started rowing.
“The future. It’s not great, by the way,” she said, and Gabe laughed.
“Okay, well, Jack is taken care of and my other kids are with Krissy... I don’t know what we should do,” Dean said, “I can’t teach a lesson, Krissy isn’t here.”
“Uh,” Dean hesitated, “Yeah.”
“No!” Castiel didn’t stop fighting.
“Sam helped me find this place and test the water. He’s a huge science-enthusiast,” Dean waded over to Cas, “Water fight?” Cas giggled and attacked first, shoving water into Dean’s face and swimming away. He heard Dean’s laugh and then splashing water as the pirate swam toward him. Cas realized he was
“Breakfast,” he mumbled, trailing his eyes down from Dean’s face to his chest in an almost longing way before snapping himself out of it. “We’re coming,” Cas called as he grabbed Dean’s hand and pulled the man with him to the door.
Charlie nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, Adam suggested he be brought up to be with you during this time.”
“You’re so pathetic,” she spat, “You think you’re something amazing but you’re not. You’re just a fucking worthless omega! You couldn’t even protect your alpha!”
Jo said at the same time, “Number Five?”
Cas laced his fingers into Dean’s hair. “Forever.” He held the pirate close to him and clung onto his body. “I want you for the rest of my life.”
“Dean… Ben and I finally have a home; a family that loves us,” Lisa sighed sadly. “What if Michael catches you and Castiel together? What if
“Get your shirt off,” Cas whined, sitting up. Dean looked over his shoulder with an amused smiled as he got off the bed. He pulled his shirt off, shaking his head, and grabbed a small circular piece of leather.
“No, while you are in heat, this room will be omegas only. No alphas or betas,” Ellen said.
“She hasn’t said much,” Garth spoke up, his voice happy despite where they were. “It’s been great actually. I love having someone to talk to.”
“You need to leave,” Ellen’s voice shocked Castiel back to reality as she whispered harshly.
me every step of the fucking way!”
“Fuck, Cas!” Dean almost shouted, Cas gasped and barely registered the feeling of Dean squeezing his hands through the deafening pleasure flowing through him with each beat of his heart. He whimpered and hung onto Dean with blinding strength until he was able to think clearly.
“You little bitch,” Alastair said, his words more of a growl than anything else. He drove his foot into Castiel’s side, snarling as Castiel cried out and wheezed. Alastair grabbed Castiel’s jacket and pulled him up so he could knee Castiel in the stomach. He did it a few times before dropping Castiel back to the floor and kicking him again. “I’ll put you in your place,” he said, pulling Castiel up and shoving him into the wall so he was facing it and his backside was exposed to Alastair.
“It’s not a ‘phase’, Gabe.” Castiel said tiredly, “I’ve been eating like this since I could purchase my own food.”
“Take your drawers off, as well, Dean.” Cas glared at the pirate.
“But how—for
“Um, yeah, it’s a door. Why—?”
“Mark me!”
on the back and when I woke up, all he told Alfie to tell me was
“Food?” Castiel asked, and his voice sounded at least five octaves deeper than it had yesterday. Screaming in ecstasy apparently had that effect on a person, and Dean’s chest puffed out with pride.
Dean shook his head to clear it, replacing his thoughts with solely Cas. Thinking of anything other than him would defeat the purpose of being alone at the moment.
“Well, I mean, they’re not saints. They did kinda deserve it.”
“What?” Sandover asked. Benny came up behind him and yanked his head back to expose his throat. Dean turned the fork around in his hand.
feel.”
“You’re telling me to calm down?!” Dean yelled. He pounded his fist on the table Cas was on, rattling the wood and sending vibrations throughout Cas’s body. “I'm going to rip his lungs out! I’m going to
“I’ll give you a moment,” she said, and then she was gone. Dean stood up and moved in front of him, wrapping his arms around Castiel.
Castiel planted his feet and closed his eyes. He tried to keep calm as reached out to the people in the Roadhouse and dug deeper through their thoughts again. When he couldn’t find anything that said Dean was there or where he might be, he reached over to the little gas station Dean got jerky from on their way back from dinner one night next, but Dean wasn’t there either.
“I...” Dean’s voice wavered and Castiel fell to his knees at the sheer cruelty of the alpha before him. Even after being exposed, the young King was continuing this charade that he wasn’t his father’s son.
Oh, my
“Okay,” he whispered. “I love you, too.”
Dean reached down and ghosted his hand over Cas’s length. “You can do better than just ‘I need it so bad,’ Cas” He ground out. He slammed his hips into Cas’s and pulled himself back out in one swift movement. Cas cried out, arching his back into Dean and pushing his forehead into the mattress.
“I wanna come so bad,” Cas whimpered, the hand he didn’t have on himself gripping onto the sheet beneath him. “Dean, please?”
He slumped back onto their bed, moaning softly as he came down from his high. Dean kissed over his face and neck tenderly, waiting until he knew Castiel was finished coming. And once Castiel sighed deeply, he knew Castiel was alright to continue.
share with anyone. Things I don’t even admit to myself.”
” He massaged the inner parts of Cas’s thighs with his thumbs. “You’ve been spoiled, haven’t you?”
“Hey,” Cas said, smiling and looking at Benny with blurry eyes.
“Well met, Castiel,” the person said and judging by their voice, they were a man, “My name is Dean. Dean Winchester. I am... I am the—” he cleared his throat, “—the King.”
“Aye,” Dean said, nodding and turning around to descend onto the main deck in waiting. “Our anchor is set, I take it?” He asked, looking around at his crew in position.
He snapped his head up to see three people all standing together looking at the line of people tied up by their carriages. Two women and a man. All three of them had dirt or paint on their faces that made it hard to tell what they truly looked like, but Cas knew that the taller woman was Gilda. He could feel it. And upon further instruction, the man standing next to her was definitely Benny while the other woman was Jo.
“No,” Cas interrupted again. “Listen to me, and if that's not enough, feel my touches.” He stood up, keeping his hands flat against Dean’s body. “Every time I touch you, Dean Winchester, it's like the first time all over again. My heart stops and all logical thought vanishes from my mind.” Cas grabbed Dean’s wrists lightly and guided them to his hips before he moved his own arms back up to press against Dean’s chest.
“I love you, too, Dean,” Cas said. He leaned up to give Dean one last kiss. Dean surprised him by pulling Cas into his body roughly and kissing him passionately. It was enough to effectively take both their breaths away.

He’d almost lost this, he’d almost lost everyone. It was laughable that not even two hours ago he’d been fine with that. Fine with never seeing any of his family again. Never seeing Dean again.
“Oh,” Cas breathed, “Oh my gods… Dean, oh my gods...”
Dean didn’t say anything and pushed the ringer again, taking a step back and turning to face Amara. He waited for what felt like hours before speaking again.
can make me feel like
“So fucking sorry,” Jo whispered, coming up and hugging them all, too. Castiel looked at his siblings one at a time before he let his tears fall.
Cas’s mouth twitched as a centerpiece was passed in front of him. Begonias, candytufts, yellow carnations, and rhododendrons. Red-orange, white, yellow. Those were the colors Ruby picked out for Meg to dismissively wave a yes to for the wedding. The colors were beautiful, Cas would admit that, but he knew what all those flowers meant. Begonias meant beware, candytufts meant indifference; yellow carnations meant disdain, disappointment, rejection; and rhododendrons meant danger you should flee from. The combination of all those flowers were in no way anything but deliberate. He didn’t think it was Crowley or Meg’s doing, though. Neither of them knew what the flowers meant—neither cared to learn. Cas thought it more the universe telling him that he was in danger.
“Hello,” someone said out of nowhere, making Castiel jump. When he saw who was there, he immediately was on edge because twenty feet in front of him, blocking his path was this tall, broad shouldered, light brown-haired, topless man that looked like he could probably snap Castiel in two without breaking a sweat. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you,” the man said, “I just… You’re Castiel, right? Arkangel’s pilot?”
“Aye, I will take care of you. Calm your heart,” Dean whispered, placing tender kisses all over Castiel’s face.
Jo scoffed and Castiel snapped his eyes to her.
“Thank you.” Cas’s voice was warm against Dean’s neck. The two of them stood in the Captain’s cabin for a long while, embracing and comforting one another. Neither of them were really sure what they were being comforted for, but that didn’t stop them.
“Sure it did.” Cas rolled his eyes again, looking away from Lucifer’s smirking face.
First thing Dean did, after he overthrew his father, was, in short, change everything. He got rid of all the alpha guards who didn’t share his view of equality. And then he replaced almost every official in the entire kingdom with someone he trusted with his life. His council members were almost all omegas, and he let them move about the castle and have all the privileges an alpha had.
“He called me his dad?” Dean asked, he couldn’t believe it. He felt like a hole in his chest had been filled. “He called me
“You deserve happiness,” Cas whispered, “You deserve to get what you want.”
“Big or small?”
. You may not send your soldiers to our havens, you may not send your soldiers to any of our villages in any corner of Winchester. We will not extradite your subjects back because as of right now, they are not your subjects anymore. They are first generation subjects of Winchester.”
no price,” Castiel said, “There’s nothing you could give me in exchange for me taking a dive in my next fight.”
Dean smiled as he reached Castiel’s mating gland, giving it a kiss before he slipped his arms under Castiel again and carefully rolled them over so the omega was sitting on top of him.
Ava nodded, “Yeah. I saw his ship dock earlier today.” She strode over to him and grabbed his wrist with impressive strength. “Let’s go. You’re getting me on that ship.”
“Let’s go,” Dean whispered, and leaned down to wrap his arms around Castiel. “Fly us home, sweetheart.”
“Shut up, Dean,” Cas interrupted. “We can talk about that later. It’s been far to long and I want to feel close to you again.”
“Good night,” Castiel said, “I am going back to my chambers. Dinner was delicious, thank you.” He walked away from Dean, ignoring his calls until he couldn’t hear them anymore.
The Pirate King was out of words. Michael Novak… The Governor of the city of Heaven, and the most adamant citizen Dean knew of for
“Yes.” Castiel nodded. He cupped Dean’s face and leaned down to rest his forehead against Dean’s. “You are my true mate,” he said softly, “and I don’t want anyone but you.”
“You don’t have—"
Castiel could barely hear his name over the sound of his crying.
Anyway, today was different. It’d been one of
“But nothing!” Castiel said, surprised to hear how manic he sounded, even to himself. “Whatever was there—whatever you
“Dean—?”
“Dean,” Cas protested, “These aren't exactly the conditions I was hoping for when I said I wanted to talk to you.”
Dean cut the girl off with an incredulous and harsh laugh. “You’ll what?” He asked, “You’ll kill me? You’ll tell everyone about Cas and I?” Dean laughed again before seeing red and looking her straight in the eyes. “You won’t be telling anyone about Cas and I.”
Dean said softly, and Castiel closed his eyes to savor the moment for just a moment.
“You don’t need to work there anymore. I can take care of us,” Castiel said, “My inheritance is more than enough to support us. And Sam.”
It's my birthday so here's an extra special birthday chapter!!
Cas felt his breath catch and his cock twitch. “Yes.”
“Ahoy!” A female voice from the other ship yelled across to them. Dean slowly made his way to the opening where they lay the plank before responding.
Dean pulled Cas in closer to his body, “I don’t like seeing you hurt.”
“Hello, your Royal Highness,” Cas greeted, standing up to give a quick nod of respect. Meg stepped passed Alfie, glaring at him.
The pirate shook his head. “No.” He kissed Cas tenderly, “I won’t fuck you.” He reached his hand down between them and took Cas’s length in his palm, stroking him lovingly. “We aren’t going to
“What?” Castiel took a step back because that stung.

Dean took another step forward when Castiel looked away. “Why?”
I felt for you is gone. In fact, it was never even there to begin with. It
“I still think you’re cute when you sneeze, though,” Dean mumbled, making Cas smile shyly.
Absolutely, yes; he
“Fuck.” His hips jerked, making Cas smile as he opened his eyes to look at his lover. “I’m not gonna last long,” Dean said. Cas let go of his bottom lip and took a big breath.
is Dean?” Castiel snapped.
“Dean,” Cas gasped, digging his nails into Dean’s shoulder blades as the last shock of his orgasm made him shiver. Dean answered with a low moan, pulling Cas against him as he pushed forward one last time. He pulled back to look at Cas, smiling as a warmth he’d only ever feel when Cas was with him spread through his chest.
Castiel took a deep breath, and something in the air made him feel comfortable in the presence of Gilda, Charlie, Meg, and Jess. He could feel that everyone here agreed with Jess’s sentiment.
“Hey, wait!” Dean called after him. Castiel turned around, arching a brown in question. “What did you mean when you said I ‘think’ you’re a beta? Are you…not a beta?”
“For now,” Cas closed his eyes and brought Dean down to kiss him. “For now we’ll agree to disagree.”
“Rain check?” Dean asked, before Castiel could even say anything, and Castiel’s heart leapt. His face broke out into a smile, and he nodded, blushing when Dean smiled back. “I’ll call you?”
“Fuck!” Dean gaped, grabbing onto Cas’s thighs. “Oh my gods, Cas. Fucking hell!”
“Bullshit,” Dean said, and Castiel almost looked back up at him. “You are special. So what if your siblings could play the piano by age three or do long division in kindergarten or whatever. My brother is technically a genius, but does that mean I’m not unique, too?”
off. Four inches is barely the average for betas,
“But—”
Dean groaned, “Tired.” He rolled onto his stomach, turning his head so he could crack an eye open to look at Cas. “What time is it?”
Castiel wanted to say no. What was the point? But he found himself nodding. Castiel looked back to Dean and frowned as he got ready to apologize.
“How soon is soon?” Cas asked, rolling his eyes.
that he wasn’t the best dad in the world, but we had each other. Even if you didn’t know it, you
“Cas, alas, I do not have my blockers on!” Dean yelled through the door. Castiel shook his head, even though Dean couldn’t see it.
“I’m not attracted to women, but I’m not attracted to men either,” Cas explained. Meg raised an eyebrow and pursed her lips. She was quite for a long while, only moving her eyes up and down Cas’s figure. She looked to be contemplating something intense and important. The way she studied him unnerved Cas greatly.
“Please,” Cas whined as his release built agonizingly slowly.
“I’m going to be honest with you all,” he started, “we’re not sure how vast of an army is waiting for us once we reach Lawrence. So far we can see eight major crews, and we haven’t broken horizon yet, so we’re very much in the blind with how many ships we’ll have to take down.” A small hush went through the sailors and Dean let it die down before continuing. “As per usual, before we go into a major battle I give every sailor the option to leave. To go home and not have anything held against them. I ask that anyone who wishes to go, go now because once we start fighting, if you abandon ship… When we win you’ll be on our list.”
“I’m going to let you get changed,” he said. Cas swallowed and shook his head.
One day, Dean came back from his torture, bleeding profusely from an extremely harsh whipping and raping. Benny tended to Dean and when the monster came back again, he went in Dean’s place. When Dean came back from the brink of death, Benny told him that they were getting out together. No matter what, they were getting out.
Dean was just finishing up his story when Gilda came in. “Did he drink his water?”
we get married’?” he asked. Dean’s face paled and he smiled nervously, showing his teeth.
Dean rolled his eyes lovingly, “Okay,” he said. “I see what you did there.” Cas laughed and slid his arms around Dean’s neck. “Very funny.”
“Dean—”
They put their bodies on yours.” He pumped his hands on Dean’s shaft a few times, making Dean groan quietly before he took the head of Dean’s cock into his mouth.
“Get out of here,” Charlie stood up with an empty pitcher of what used to be Benny’s grog.
“You’re my future, too,” he said, his voice muffled.
Cas threaded his unoccupied hand into Dean’s hair and nodded. Dean smiled softly and kissed him, sliding his tongue into Cas’s mouth at the same time he slid a finger into his heat. Cas gasped softly, and pushed down onto it, tears welling up in his eyes...
“As cheesy as this sounds, I don’t want to hurt you, Dean, but I will,” Amara said, “I can find another you if I have to.”
“Okay, we’ll be there in a minute,” Rachel said, and then turned back to Castiel, about to continue her story about her year in Spain when Benny hummed to get their attention again.
‘I do,’
“Missed you so fucking much, baby,” Dean muttered, sucking one of Cas’s nipples into his mouth and swirling his tongue around the sensitive bud until it was hard. After that, he moved to the other one.
“You are not good at espionage, love,” Castiel said, laughing as Dean winced.
Castiel reached out and grabbed Dean’s wrist, stopping them both in their tracks as something electric rushed through both of them at the contact.

“I’m already dressed,” Castiel said, looking to the door as Dean’s head popped into the room.
“Right,” Benny said quietly. “I don’t agree with Jo, but I see where she and Rachel are coming from because if mom’s hardware is malfunctioning… The smartest thing to do would be to turn her off.”
!” Cas’s mouth hung open as he panted.
When he reached his trailer, he locked the door behind himself and dropped to his bed. Some kind of comfort came from the lumps and dips he could feel in his hundred-year-old mattress. It gave him a little piece of his mind back, and Castiel took it gratefully as he laid back on his bed and stared up at the ceiling.
“It would confuse them, at the very least. And we need every advantage we can get.”
“I’m still cold,” Cas complained, trying to pull Dean up from lifting each of his feet to slide into a fresh pair of drawers and trousers. Cas was dazed and sleepy. He was cold, too, and wanted to snuggle into Dean to get warm.
“Okay,” Dean said, breathing out shakily. He gripped his member and lined himself up, pushing in slowly.
“Where’s my bossy angel gone to?” Dean husked into Cas’s ear. Cas whined loudly as Dean let go of Cas's member, trailing his hand up to flick and pinch at Cas's nipples until Cas was writhing under him.
“Did I hurt you, Cas?” Dean asked, coming to sit down between Cas’s legs and rubbing them soothingly.
“For fucks sake, Cas, stop traumatizing him,” he said, tightening his grip around Castiel and making it so he had to put his hands back against his sides. Castiel tried to say something again and Dean rolled his eyes. “I’m not letting go unless you’re going to apologize.”
“You’re going to see Dean again?” Rachel asked, and Castiel didn’t like the edge in her voice. “I mean, you’re going to his
“Baby,” Dean soothed, coming to sit between Cas’s legs. He reached into another drawer of his nightstand and pulled out a small can of lotion. “I’m gonna take care of you.” Dean opened the bottle and tapped the opening on his palm. Once there was enough he dropped the bottle beside him and rubbed the lotion onto Cas’s stomach.
“He is real! Dean’s true mate is real,” Cain yelled over his shoulder. A few seconds later Castiel heard some clattering and the next thing he knew several heads popped out from the wagons, all looking at him. He saw them gasp and giggle before vanishing again. Cain turned back to him, smiling still as he continued, “Dean has been talking about you since he was a pup! He told anyone who would listen about his true mate.”
“Cas—!” Dean stood up and took one step closer to Castiel. “Please—”
Castiel didn’t even want to
Let me know what you think about the chapter, my thoughts about the new version of this fic I'll be writing. :P
“How long?”
“Stay calm, for starters. You will be okay, you simply need listen to what your omega is telling you. Listen to what you truly want, because that is what our inner wolves are. They are us in our truest forms.”
“Why not? His Majesty—”
Dean called out to Cas, too. Just as much; maybe even more.
Castiel blew out the breath he was holding harshly and lunged forward, closing the gap between him and Dean. He braces himself with his hands on Dean’s chest and rose onto up as much as he could to press his nose rob Dean’s neck, breathing in Dean’s scent for what he thought to be the first time, but as he did, he realized he already knew this scent. This was the scent that was on the pillow and blanket he’d been given during his heat, that rich burning wood and calming air after a rain smell.
“Yes, your Majesty,” Castiel said, even though he wanted the opposite.
“Of course,” Jo said, hiding her smirk into her glass. “You’re going to
By some chance—maybe it was boredom or the fact he couldn’t sleep—Dean found himself getting up and opening his door to find a young omega standing on his porch. He looked like he’d just rolled out of bed by the state of his hair, but he was wearing jeans and a brown bomber jacket with fingerless gloves.
Castiel clenched his fists in fury, because how could Zachariah do this? He knew more about what Castiel and his siblings were and what their powers could do, and he
“I assumed you had, Dean,” Castiel said, and Dean laughed nervously.
“Yeah, don’t mention it,” Dean said, and he brought a hand up to rub at the back of his neck, like he was nervous. “Look, I, um, I haven’t had lunch yet and I know this great burger joint just a few minutes away. Would you… Would you want to join me? My treat.”
“No,” Cas mewled, still breathing as if he’d just run a marathon. “No, please, I can’t take it.”
Every step resulted in a jolt of stinging pain. His thighs were sore from riding Dean, and his abdomen right above his groin was sensitive to the touch. Not to mention his throat was pretty dry and scratchy.
“It is not because you are busy with your royal obligations,” Castiel interrupted, “I am unsatisfied because I want to do more with you,” he clarified. Dean raised an eyebrow in question as he brought his wine up to take a drink. Castiel rolled his eyes at his alpha’s obliviousness. “I want to be naughty with you.”
“Touch me,” Cas gasped. “Touch me, please!” Dean obliged him, smoothing his hands over Cas’s sides and the tops of his thighs. Cas cried out, moaning wildly and uncontrollably. Like every nerve in Cas’s body was on fire and when Dean touched him, the fire was doused.
Castiel nodded, because he could relate to that. He wanted to be a writer and writing little stories in the moonlight was how he escaped when he was younger. “I know what you mean,” he said, “Wanting a way to escape. When I was younger,  I would write those typical short stories about an omega prince saved by the dashing alpha prince from the evil queen who locked him in a tower, or the charming thief who freed the omega from a curse.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas pretended to bow, “Thank you. I try.”
“Okay, continue,” Castiel said. Dean gave a few careful thrusts, still watching Castiel and debating as Castiel huffed out a small puff of air every time Dean pushed forward.
Castiel couldn’t help but smile at Jess. She continued on about Sam as they made their way through the castle and towards the exit that lead to the garden. Jess was in the middle of talking about how beautiful his eyes were when she stopped abruptly.
“Cas,” Dean moaned, his head thrown back and his knees bent slightly. “Cas, Cas, Cas.”
“I get it, I mean,” Cas said in hopes of dissipating some of the awkwardness in the air. “You’re the only one who could really understand what he’d been through. I… I would’ve done the same thing, in your place.”
Dean laughed against Cas’s neck before sliding his hand from Cas’s groin to his other thigh and carrying them to the bed. He dropped Cas down and let him giggle as he bounced a little before spreading himself out on the sheets; a moment later Dean was between Cas’s legs and his lips were on his neck.
Castiel couldn’t help but feel a little miffed that they didn’t know his name. If he were an alpha, they would be talking in depth about how cool his name was and how badass it sounded for a beastie pilot.
. It was made from bone. Bobby said it was from the jaw of a donkey from ancient times he just had lying around, but Dean wasn’t entirely convinced of that.
“With you,” Dean said.
“Mh-hm,” Cas nodded, “Tonight’s going to be fun.”
“Don't mention it,” Charlie said, “Turn around though. Benny made something special for your birthday.”
“I want Dean to take me with him the next time he leaves from Heaven,” she stated. “I can’t take this shit town anymore.”
“I...” Castiel frowned. He needed to talk to someone. Gilda and Jess had become his closest confidants, but they were unavailable. So was Charlie, and Alfie would be asleep. Castiel knew if he asked for Alfie’s time, he would get it, but he also knew Alfie worked hard. And he would be getting up again tomorrow to work hard. He needed his rest. So, that left Meg.
“It’s for when my brother and his girlfriend visit,” Dean said, “I keep it around in case Jess needs or wants it.”
Two months short of ten years. Dean spent
Cas saw Gilda smiled. “I think you’d be a great pirate.”
“For eternity,” Castiel said, looking deeply into Dean’s eyes, “I will.”
“Sh,” Dean grunted, “You don’t want everyone to hear us do you?”
“Flip over, omega,” Dean said, sitting up and pulling out of Castiel. Castiel whined in upset at Dean as he slipped free.
“Spare us the usual spiel,” Kevin said.
your heat—we help you
Dean shushed the young man by pushing an oiled finger into his hole. Cas moaned and threw his head back; he gasped out frenzied words that turned into only sounds seconds later. Dean added two more fingers in rapid succession, watching as Cas’s eyes screwed themselves shut and his hips jerked down to meet Dean’s fingers.
“His Majesty spent quite some time perfecting the room, too, so I would wager it shall be a comfortable heat,” the second guard said.
“Oh,” Cas gasped, “That’s tight.”
Number Three was Rachel, the only other omega besides Castiel, and she could persuade anyone to do anything. All she had to do was say,
of being special.
When Castiel had practically jumped out of the Impala before Dean had even put it in park, Dean knew it was because of some furry or fuzzy creature. After he’d brought in all the groceries and Castiel waltzed in with a small black kitten in his arms, Dean knew
Dean let out a strangled moan, moving his hands down to grip Castiel’s thighs. He tried to roll the two of them back so he was on top, but Castiel growled at him. Castiel felt this surge inside him and the next thing he knew, Dean’s hands flew up above his head and pressed into the bed.
His father was already in his own carriage with a random man Cas had never seen before. That took him by surprise and he stopped, looking into the bigger carriage in confusion.
A handful of thrusts into Cas’s prostate later, Cas snapped his eyes open and his mouth fell open in a silent scream. Cas’s hole clenched around Dean and he had to stop his hips from how tight Cas had gotten. Dean’s eyes widened as he realized what was happening. Cas’s eyes rolled up in his head and he convulsed around Dean. The pirate smiled and waited, letting Cas calm down.
Dean brought himself out of his head as he ran his thumb over the slit of his cock.  An image of Cas with his mouth open in a perfect little
“What? No, it’s not that, I…” Castiel sighed. “I’m getting dinner with Dean tonight. He’s teaching me how to cook a meal, and we’re going to the grocery shop together, so… I want to get to that.”
“Huh.” Meg leaned down to study it more and smirked knowingly. “I’ve seen that flag before.”
Cas tested the restraints and shook his head. “No, it’s perfect.”
Castiel pulled Dean back and kissed him until his lungs burned, and even then when he couldn’t breathe he didn’t stop.
“Of course, Cas,” Dean said and leaned down farther. Cas got the hint and stood up on his toes to connect their lips. Dean was gentle and sincere in his kiss. Cas opened his mouth and tried to push his tongue into Dean’s mouth, but Dean pulled away.
Castiel saw movement from inside the store and looked up just as Dean came rushing over to open the door.
‘knot all the omegas down there!’
be just like all alphas are! He
Cas bit down on Dean’s shoulder, muffling his sobs. He wanted to come so bad, but he didn’t want this to ever end; because when it ended, it meant Dean had to leave again and he was back to falling asleep in his own bed every night and feeling empty...
“No, no. You’re right, I need to apologize,” he said, and Dean thought he was being genuine for a moment so he lowered his hand. “You’re right, Dean. I’m sorry, Sam, I misspoke…” Dean
“Damn, Cas,” Dean said breathlessly. He rolled off Cas, dragging him across the bed into his side. Cas curled up into him and threw a leg over his waist. “I love you, angel. I can’t say it enough, squarely,” Dean said, turning his head to nuzzle into Cas’s hair.
“I did,” Hannah said, “and I agree. It’s delicious.”
Dean smiled and let go of Cas, scooting up on his bed. Cas came and sat down next to him, but Dean pulled him into his lap, legs on either side of Dean’s hips.
“Huh.” Dean moved his fingers back to tease Castiel’s entrance, smiling at the way the omega’s legs jerked open wider. “No condom, because you…‘don’t like how they feel’…”
Castiel looked at Gadreel for a long moment, contemplating answering him. Instead, he shook his head, chiding himself for falling for Gadreel’s tactic. “Stop it, none of that matters.”
“We are not going to hurt you,” the blonde said, “My name is Jessica. People call me Jess. We are just here to help you get through your heat.”
“Ah.” Gilda said.
“I-I guess from the beginning,” he said, “I remembered the day I hurt dad. The day he decided he was going to hide my powers, but I don’t understand
Castiel gasped and opened his eyes, breathing hard and heart racing. Tonight was the night of his match against Lucifer, and the alpha knew what he was doing.
“Put my life on hold when Dean’s here?” Cas interrupted, looking at Gabe incredulously. “Gabe, I don’t know if you noticed but when Dean isn’t here I am just going through the motions. If anything, when I put my life on hold is when Dean’s not here.”
Dean sneered at him, “You shut up, too, Benny.”
Castiel yipped in surprise and excitement, but he nodded, grabbing a handful of Dean’s hair and tugging the alpha’s head to the side. He buried his nose in Dean’s neck, taking a deep breath before he felt that feeling of ecstasy overtake him and he sunk his teeth into Dean’s neck, riding out the waves of his orgasm with his teeth firmly in Dean’s neck, not letting go until he felt it right to let go of his alpha.
“When we got to the island, Alastair had two of his men drag me into the dungeons. I thought for sure I was going to be a whipping boy. But once again:
Dean scoffed, “There’s nobody that I can name that thinks that other than for selfish reasons.”
Thank you everyone for your kind comments on the last chapter. I still haven't decided whether or not to make the new version ABO or not, but I think I'm leaning towards making it ABO.
He tried to calm his omega, but he could tell it was still seething silently at him. He didn’t want it to throw a fit again, but he wouldn’t let it dictate how he lived his life. He turned to Meg and looked into her eyes.
“Yeah, it happens to true mates. Saw it with my sister first hand. When her mate was overseas and she’d call him, afterwards, she’d get cranky and irritable for months. And then the moment she was able to scent and hold her again, she was all better,” Gadreel said, like it was no big deal.
Gilda looked into Dean’s eyes, “You’re scared.” She said, “You’re scared that when you do take him with you that he’s going to wake up one day and realize he doesn’t love you. That he could do better than you.”
Castiel felt tears come to his eyes. “I am!”
“Yeah,” Cas nodded. Dean leaned across Cas to grab it. He opened it and immediately dug into the food in it. “What’d he make?’
“Aye.”
Dean smirked and replied without missing a beat, “On the Impala 67.”
“It’s not your fault,” he whispered, pulling his family in tighter. “It’s not any of our faults. We were all kids, and dad should have been better. He shouldn’t have done any of what he did. I was wrong to blame you, any of you. It was unfair and unkind, and
“Are you alright if my brother comes with us?” He asked. Castiel had heard so much about Sam from Jess, and he felt like he already knew him. Sam was an alpha, but he was raised by Ellen. And even though he was an alpha, Castiel felt a tad more comfortable meeting him after he’d been told Sam had only ever met John twice in his entire life.
“Yeah?”
“I wish I could say something to make your pain go away,” Dean said calmly, “I know there isn’t anything I can say to make what you’ve been through any easier, but I need you to know, Cas, that you don’t have to go through it alone.”
“Dean,” Cas said breathlessly. “You have to go.” Regardless, Cas still let his head fall to the side to expose more skin. Dean nipped at the spot where Cas’s jaw ended before moving down and sucking a bruise into Cas’s neck.
love. And you think you can just try and apologize?” Dean scoffed. “Not gonna fly. Not with me, not with Cas, not with anyone on this ship. You’re
“Color?”
dysfunctional superpowered family that’ll come after your ass, you hear me?” Gabe jabbed his finger into Dean’s chest once more, and Castiel rolled his eyes again.
Castiel was looking forward to dinner. Both because he wanted to see Dean, and because he wanted to tell Dean about the writing competition his creative writing professor announced during his lecture. Castiel was practically running across campus when classes ended to get to that café Dean was at as soon as possible. He was so distracted in his haste that he almost missed Rachel when he passed her. The only thing that stopped him was hearing his name called in her voice. It stopped him dead in his tracks and made his blood run cold.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean whispered, “I love you so much.”
“Did you ask him to do that?” Dean asked, smiling as he walked over to his dresser.
!” Cas felt his hips lift into Dean’s.
“How did the dream start?” Cas asked, squeezing Dean’s hand for support.
After he heard murmurs of agreement, he nodded and put the movie on, settling back in his seat as it played.
Gabe interrupted, “Oh, possessive are we?”
“What’s more special than his
“Rosewater and lavender drink are made the same way. Petals are soaked in water overnight and then sweetened with honey,” Charlie explained, “Apple drink is different. Apples slices are boiled in water for a while and then cooled and the slices are taken out, then the drink is sweetened with honey. Lemon is made by squeezing the juice from lemons into water and you add as much sweetening as you like.”
“Aye,” Dean nodded. He looked at Jo as she came to sit down next to him.
“Do you think any of you have the right to ask anything of me? After everything this family has done to me?” Castiel seethed. “I was abandoned! First by dad when I didn’t have powers, and then by all of you! You just stood by and let me be forgotten and ignored!”
Cas gasped and pulled harder at his bonds. “I have! I have! Please, I have!”
“Zachariah was always scared of the day Castiel stopped taking his medication. He was worried Castiel would figure out about his powers, and eventually wouldn’t be able to control them,” Ellen said, “He knew the day was going to come at some point, and he knew that he needed everyone together when it happened because he figured Castiel could rely on his siblings for guidance.”
Cas whimpered brokenly as Dean pushed his finger into him. He moaned and tried to fuck himself back on Dean’s fingers. “Oh god, I love you,” he gasped, “I can never make myself feel like you do.”
Plus, my writing isn't... Great. It's very underdeveloped. I've come so far since I began this fic, and whenever I sit down to continue writing, I fall back into the headspace I had when I first started this fic. It's a dangerous place to be because you get more dialogue than description when more description would be better. Not only that, but this fic is also all over the place. I've put in useless scenes that don't advance or help the plot and it's just... Wow. Not great. (And all the historical inaccuracies???? Oh man, I want to slap myself. Some of them were intended because I didn’t want to have to write  about the realities of this time period, but still. Not good.)
Castiel reached out with his powers, wrapping a careful tendril around each of them.
“Do you like it?” Jess asked. Castiel nodded and Jess smiled at him. She took the knife and cut into another pale yellow cheese, but this one had holes in it. “This one is emmenthal. It is a hard cheese,” she explained as Castiel put the piece into his mouth. It was fruity, but also acidic as he swallowed.
Dean groaned in defeat, giving Cas’s neck a quick kiss before hauling himself up and off Cas. “Fine. You make a good point,” Dean huffed, sitting back on his heels. “An annoying point, but a good one,” he added as an afterthought. Cas pushed himself up onto his elbows, smiling and giggling softly at Dean.
“Cas,” Dean started, turning his head to capture Cas’s lips with his own. “Are you sure? We can wait a little longer, baby. We don’t need to rush.”
What really made things noticeable was how Rachel was acting. She had always been there to support Castiel, but now it was like she couldn’t even look at him. Something had changed between them, and Castiel couldn’t help but feel like it was partly his fault. He’d always had an inkling Rachel wanted more from their relationship, but he also knew he never wanted to be in a relationship with her. He didn’t want to be in a relationship with anyone. Castiel told himself he just didn’t want partnership, but really it was a combination of a lot of things he wasn’t ready to try and decipher. Either way, Castiel just didn’t want anything more than friendship because even that was hard sometimes.
Dean asked, and Castiel looked up to see a black muscle car pull over and then Dean was rushing out and over to him. “Hey, I’m sorry, I got in my car as soon as I heard the gunshots and looked up the address of the academy.”
“Cas?” Dean sounded amused, and Castiel looked up at him to see that Dean was smirking. “You okay?”
“I’m yours,” Dean echoed. “I’m
Dean smiled and kissed Cas. “I love you, too, angel.”
Memories from earlier surfaced at that name and Castiel groaned again, bringing his hands up to cover his face. How touchy he was with Dean, how he felt like he would die if he wasn’t close to the alpha, how he practically turned feral when Rachel said Dean needed to leave… Castiel was stunned at how he acted. He hated alphas, but he’d practically just thrown himself at one. What the fuck was wrong with him?
“Cas, the world is going to end in ten days, and I don’t know how or why it ends.” Meg shook her head like she was ashamed. “All I know is that we need to stop it.”
“Oh,” Abbadon laughed. “No. I would never threaten, Dean Winchester.”
I hoped you liked this chapter!
“Yes,” Cas moaned; both from the feeling of Dean and in answer to his question. “Harder.”
as she and Ben passed.
“Let’s go,” Castiel said, grabbing Dean’s hand and pulling him outside. He felt this spark shoot through him at the touch, and when they were safe from being in the way of people outside, Castiel was reluctant to let Dean’s hand go. But he did, and instantly missed the sparks he felt. “So, um, anyway,” he said, looking at his coffee to keep Dean from seeing him blush. “I wanted to say thank you, because you’ve really made the past few days bearable.”
“Daddy!”
“Ph-phallic shaped dowels...” Alfie trailed off. Castiel looked up at him, surprised to see Alfie both blushing and paling. “You mean...” Ellen nodded. “For—”
... I love you.”
As they got into the room, Dean picked Cas up and pushed him against the door, making him gasp in surprise. The pirate moved to nip at Cas’s neck while on of his hands came to palm at Cas’s groin while the other supported some of his weight under his thigh.
“Yeah, it… Causes a lot of trepidation in a person when they present as omega,” Castiel said.
“Yes, please, I want your cock,” Castiel whined, letting go of the bed sheets and reaching down to grab at whatever part of Dean he could. “Please, Dean, I’m ready.”
Castiel snorted. “Well, mine were full of plot holes and bad grammar,” he said as butterflies punched themselves into the walls of his stomach.
“I have a few moments.”
Castiel didn’t know! Everything was so confusing! Castiel didn’t know what he felt, or what he wanted anymore.
“He’s… He’s an angel?”
“I’ve also hurt and killed so many people, Cas,” Dean said, turning around and sighing in annoyance. “You’re making me out to be some hero when I’m not.”
“Okay!” Jo interrupted, “While, yes, this is all cute—in a weird, gross, and definitely inappropriate way, and the picture of domestic bliss, I thank you to remember that Dean is like my brother and you’re talking about your sex life.” Jo looked from Dean to Castiel. “And we’re about to eat. I’m about to eat.”
“What does that mean?” He asked.
“Yeah, angel?” Dean said quietly, pressing kisses into Cas’s hairline.
“I’ve always been alright when Sam was happy,” Dean said, “As long as he didn’t have to deal with the world I lived in, I was okay.”
“What’s your first four?” Someone asked from the back of the class.
“Oh,” Dean drawled, sliding an arm under Cas’s neck for support. “I’m okay with that.”
Dean said, pulling Castiel down again as he thrust up. Castiel cried out as he felt Dean’s knot inflate.
“Let you
“Dean!” Cas gasped, arching into the sensation. Dean thumbed over Cas’s other nipple a few times, getting it hard before he rolled it between his fingers. He pinched and pulled at the bud, reveling in the little gasps and whimpers that Cas was letting out.
“Just fuck me, Dean.” He tried to growl, but it turned into a coughing fit. Dean laughed under his breath as he reached over to grab another tissue for Castiel.
“Can you sneak away for the day?”
“Yeah, I guess… What about you?” Castiel asked.
Castiel wouldn’t do it, though. There was a big part of him that really wanted to, that wanted to know what it felt like to be held by the alpha...to know what Dean sounded like when his guard was down...
Minutes passed before Dean finally broke.
“Wakey, wakey,” Cas whispered. It was the morning of Dean’s twenty-ninth birthday. The first one Cas got to celebrate with the man. Needless to say, he was excited. But Cas didn’t want to do anything too fast or too soon and freak Dean out. He was going to take things slow today. “How are you feeling?”
“Oh. That’s cool. I’d still love to hang out again. You’re good company. Maybe we can just get coffee or something.”
Gilda smiled sadly and rubbed more cream on Cas’s back before closing her eyes and mumbling some words. Cas felt his back become warm and the pain went away. “I’ve used a spell to make your cuts heal as two times faster than normal, so it should be about three days until you can really be able to move without any pain,” Gilda said, opening her eyes and looking at Cas again. She nudged Cas to flip onto his back and he followed through.  “I wish Dean would just take you with us when we depart again.”
“What?” Castiel gaped at Gilda. “Dean thinks he is in love with me?”
Meg’s last husband… He hadn’t tripped. He’d been pushed. Murdered, because he wasn’t able to impregnate Meg. And the same thing would happen to him when he wouldn’t be able to provide an heir for her either.
“I’ll tell you, Dean. I’ll tell you each time an alpha ‘wouldn’t keep their hands to themselves’,” Castiel spat Dean’s words back at him, “at least, the times I can remember. Because like you said, I’m an omega in a world where alphas don’t even try and keep their hands off.”
“Gabe and I had a fight… He’s
“That’s good,” Cas mumbled, pushing his hands through Dean’s hair and smiling at the sighs Dean exhaled through his nose.
“Thank you,” he said, following Charlie.
“Dean,” Cas whined, leaning his head back against the man’s shoulder. “Please.”
“I’m here, Cas,” Dean said, running his hand through Cas’s hair. “I’m here.
The older man looked up at Cas and grabbed his hands. He brought them to his mouth and kissed the palms gingerly. Cas smiled at him and tried to sit up, hissing when he was met with a dull ache in his back. Dean stood up and grabbed Cas’s clothes after pulling his own trousers back up. He got Cas back into the articles of clothing before helping Cas up into a sitting position.
“Okay. And?”
“Really?” Dean asked, and Castiel felt his face heated up and he looked back to the little figurines to hide the blush.
“I know.” Cas made a show of licking his lips; Dean’s eyes flicked down to them to watch. “Dean, kiss me?”
“You okay for me to move again, Cas?” Dean asked. Castiel nodded frantically, moaning as Dean started thrusting; slowly at first, but before long, Dean picked up his pace and it made Castiel start climbing. Castiel could barely move as Dean set up a quick rhythm, and he stared up at Dean with wide eyes because the feeling of the alpha pumping inside him like this was incredible. It felt like fire was coursing through his veins and lightning was sparking through every nerve.
“What?”
“Gonna take that as you forgive me,” Dean said, laughing as Castiel rolled his eyes and pushed at his head to get him to move down.
“He is not what I expected.”
“Dean,” Jo said, slowly coming over to put her and on Dean’s shoulder.
Cas risked a look behind him but couldn’t see Dean. He stopped and treaded water, looking for any sign of his lover. There was no sign of him, though.
Dean said. Castiel smiled to himself and blushed again.
“It’s not a bad kind of sore,” He blushed again, “I kinda like it.”
Cas continued to look at him with an amused grin. “You’re cute when you’re nervous.”
“No, no, I think it’s nice,” Dean said. Castiel heard him move closer and his heart started to thump against his rib cage. “I wouldn’t mind reading a story like that, ya’ know? They sound pretty interesting.”
“God!”
“Fu-u-uck!” Cas whimpered between thrusts, his voice gone hoarse. Dean breathed out a laugh and kept fucking into Cas.
“Okay,” Cas heard himself answer. “Tomorrow we’ll go to the garden.”
“Oh.” Dean’s face scrunched up into a wince. “Yeah, she was a mistake.”
than your ol’ uncle Gabe. I see how it is.”
Castiel leaned back in his seat. “So, I either lose my next fight or something bad happens?”
“You need to go, Amara,” Dean said. Castiel felt the change in Dean’s demeanor and moved over to him, turning Dean to look at him. He made Dean look in his eyes and smiled for him, trying to let him know things would be okay.
Dean took a moment to collect himself and look down into Cas’s eyes. “What…”
“You bet,” she smirked, dropping her eyes to Cas’s covered lower half. “Is it normal for guys to be so small?”
“No,” Cas said, pushing at Lucifer’s arm and feeling a wave relief that he was able to get the man off him. “For as long as I live: never ever. And not even after that.”
~  ~  ~
“True mate?” Castiel shook his head. “What do you mean? What is that?”
“I like stories.”
easy when I put it in him. Slicks like a fucking water slide—thank god for mattress protectors, am I right?” Dean smiled as a small blush spread over Castiel’s cheeks. “He was a virgin yesterday but isn’t today. Oh, and he has the name of an Angel. Preferably the Angel of Thursday.”
Dean started the conversation with Cas about him being descended from angels; with Gilda’s help, of course. Cas didn’t believe it at first. But then Gabe appeared, almost out of nowhere, and confirmed the claim. Apparently, Gabe had been researching this since he was a kid; it’s part of the reason that Michael hated him so much. Gabe was like Cas: he had more Grace in him than Michael. And Michael was not happy about that.
“Shut up,” She hissed, spinning Cas so his back was against her side and she had a firm grip on him. “You better not fall,” she said and grabbed onto one of the ropes and climbed up onto the ship. They stumbled, almost falling over the edge. The knife Ava had jabbed into him, cutting through his clothes and the tip stabbed into him.
Castiel smiled, looking down at his feet as he worked up the courage to speak again. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Judging by the way you’re walking today, I’m guessing you already know Mr.
“What are you sorry for?”
can tell
“What about my mouth?” Dean prompted, flicking his tongue across Cas’s slit and collecting the precome that had started to bead there. Cas arched his back before spreading his legs and tugging harshly on Dean’s hair. Dean took Cas’s length back into his mouth and bobbed his head, drawing moan after moan from the young man. Cas pulled at Dean’s hair, making Dean grunt and moan around Cas’s cock.
“Maybe I’ll just keep riding you until you come,” Castiel said, and the way Dean’s cock grew a little harder inside him made him gasp through a small orgasm. “May-maybe I won’t give you the option to pull out.”
“Now, Castiel, how do you feel?” she asked. Castiel glanced up to Alfie, frowning as Alfie wouldn’t look at him and his face still was tinged pink. He took a deep breath and then nodded his head, smiling at Ellen as he answered.
“Chuck will keep us informed, too,” Sam said, stepping closer to Dean and putting a hand on his shoulder. “If there are too many more, though, Dean… I don’t know what we’re going to do. We only have so much man power and there are some pretty substantial ships out there. I don’t know if—”
After hesitating, he had decided to follow his gut and pursue his will to become a teacher. Law school was his past self’s dream and after years of fighting, he had realized that he wanted to pass on his knowledge and connect with other people. At the same time, he had developed an app with the help of Charlie, that was reuniting hunters in the same virtual place and allowing them to share precious informations about their hunts, the supernatural spots, informations and datas about the creatures they had fought, the places and dates of their hunts. Every case that was solved was signaled as such on the app.
“Even if it was, it doesn’t matter,’’ he said sadly.
“Cas! Hey, Cas! Wake up. I need you to wake up.’’
“I know, but… a part of me is still afraid that everything is going to be taken away from me, you know? We lost so much since our childhood, I’m just… not yet used to things being so simple. I don’t know if that makes sense?’’ he said, looking at his brother.
While he was speaking, Cas opened the bag again, pointing out the weapon in question.
He handed a nougat bar to Jack, who took it with a smile, and put the rest of the supplies at Cas’ feet.
He raised his beer in Sam’s direction.
He stopped talking for a few seconds, and slowly shook his head.
When he fell on the ground, Dean’s heart skipped a beat. "CAS?!!"
Dean and Cas exchanged a look.
Seven years had passed after Dean’s death when one morning, while Sam was off to his daily jog, he had found Jack on his porch, waiting for him. He was looking unusually worried, which had led the Winchester to believe that something very serious had happened. Little did he know, by this time, how much his life had been about to change. The Nephilim had then explained to him that he was about to break the divergent timeline Chuck had created and in which he had locked them in. The trick was ingenious, but Jack had been more clever. He had perceived a breach while moving from one world to another —he and Amara were rebuilding the parallel dimensions Chuck had meticulously destroyed, in order to preserve the Balance of the Universe.
"Look who’s talking!" the angel said in a defensive voice.
With a snap of her fingers, she teleported him to Cas. Dean landed harshly on the floor of a cold room, only to find himself surrounded by four walls. There was no door, no way to escape. The place was dark and he had a hard time seeing where he was, but after adjusting his vision to the place, he discerned the presence of Cas, who was lying down, facing the floor, unconscious. He wasn’t physically hurt, but the pain on his face was very telling about the hell he was emotionally experiencing in whatever the Empty was putting him through in his nightmares. His face looked worried and scared.
“But if things go wrong… I don’t know if I’ll be able to step in. There is a new balance, I’m not the only one ruling on the Universe, and I have no power over the Empty. That’s why I didn’t have a chance to bring Cas back myself.’’
kind of strange— activity in the past few weeks and the eldest Winchester had decided that it was worth to take a look at what seemed to be a ghost case. Three rash people had died at the place and some survivors had reported violent attacks.
“You have to do it, Dean,“ Cas said. “The urge to kill is coming back.“ He was struggling. “I’m… I’m feeling it. I might leave you right here, right now. We have to do it now. I… I don’t want you to have to fight me to put me in it.“
“Our training helped me to improve.’’
She was about to throw herself at them but the portal leading to their world appeared again on the wall of the room they were in. Dean put Cas’ arm around his neck and led them to the breach, which they quickly got aspired by. In the next second, they were on the Bunker’s floor, catching their breath.
will. You’re coming with me.’’
’ve tried everything.“ That was true. They had gone in almost every little corner of the World looking for a solution. “In the meantime, people died
“Again, I’m not sure it matters,’’ Cas said in a cryptic voice.
“Tell me where he is,’’ Dean said, once more.
He took the blade at his belt and showed it to the angel, who seemed lost in return. He didn’t understand.
Sam took a deep breath, visibly upset. “You have to be the one to do it, Dean.“ Sam hated himself for having to say those words. “You’re the only one left who has a chance to get close to him without getting killed.“
“You know… I’m gonna propose to her,’’ he finally said.
“I am. I promise you. I’m sorry it took me so long…’’ His voice broke. He kept the angel’s face between his hands, looking deep into his eyes, trying to convince him it was really him. “I’m gonna get you out, okay?’’
Dean and Jack looked at each other, uncertain. The timeline had been changed, distorted, rebuilt. What had represented a few days for Dean had been seven years for Sam. And they didn’t even know how it was for Cas. It was a difficult question to answer.
“You’re… you’re not going to cry, right?’’
Cas was broken-hearted to see the Winchester like this, to know he was the reason of his pain, and he was now silently crying too. Their faces were so close that he just had to lean in a little to finally meet his lips and kiss him slowly, putting as much tenderness as he could in it.
“And Cas…’’ Sam added gently. “You seem to be doing great together. After all these years… you deserve it.’’ He tried not to push too much, knowing how bashful his big brother could get on this kind of topics.
He had taken a new step towards the former angel, hesitant. His eyes had been fixated on the floor for a moment, before he had brought them back on him.
“Yup, we did what we had to do.’’
. By my bare hands. I refuse to let that happen any longer.“ Tears had started to flood his eyes, even though he was trying to contain them. “Please… I trust you, Dean. I… I know I’m asking for a lot. Maybe too much. But I can’t keep going like this.“
was in the garage!” Dean said, “He’s in all the family photos we have in the hallway!”
“Dean!” Cas screamed, bucking his hips wildly and roughly into Dean’s. Cas shook his hands out of Dean’s and wrapped them around the man’s neck, clinging to him tightly.
“Soon,” Cas agreed in an echo, releasing Dean and smiling as he made his way back onto his ship. Cas held his hand over the middle of his chest, right here he kept the pendant Dean gave him, and continued to smile as the ship sailed away. “Soon…”
Not beating around the bush, Dean spoke. “You’re the son of Michael Novak?” Cas looked startled for a second before gripping the towel around his waist and nodding. Dean closed his eyes in frustration. “Why didn’t you tell me?” He looked into Cas’s eyes.
“I can feel my face when I sneeze and
“That’s not your fault. We all left because we were adults and needed to make a life for ourselves. Jo is just bitter because she never wanted the crime fighting to end.” Rachel said. She smiled softly at him and hugged him again. “And I’m glad you’re here. I’m really glad you’re here.”
that it isn’t cute,” Cas said matter of factly. “It is quite weird looking.”
Abbadon rolled her eyes and sneered. “I wouldn’t have taken your second chance even if you’d offered your ship, crew, and gold with it.”
He’d been trying to talk to Dean about it for weeks, but every time he wanted to sit down with Dean, Dean was either not available or he was called away. It was infuriating!
Cas moaned, pushing into the man’s touches. He heard Dean let out something that sounded like a growl and he trembled. “Oh, Captain.”
“You sure you want to be doing this right now?” Dean asked, “I don’t know if sex is the best for a sick person.”
“It’s past already,” Dean said, swallowing his pie before shoving another bite into his mouth.
“I think I’m luckier to have you,” Dean said, kissing Castiel with so much tenderness and love, it took his breath away.
“What do you want to know?” He asked, his voice clipped and tight.
He could hear footsteps coming down the hall and the next thing he saw was principal Harvelle dragging in a tall kid with hair that couldn’t decide if it was light brown or dirty blonde.
“Dean, please,” he whined, wrapping his legs around Dean’s waist and pulling their hips flush together.
Dean gaped. “What do you mean you—
as his voice got higher in pitch with each word. Dean smiled and bit down where Cas’s shoulder and neck met lightly.
Vocabulary you may need:
“Yeah,” Benny said, not looking at Cas.
that is how you
...Was it?
“You were supposed to be married to Meg right now. And Heaven wa supposed to have been taken into the Royal Kingdom.”
He’d almost died last night. And Jo was right, he could have gotten any of his siblings killed… He just wanted to help, but maybe it
"De-e-ean!" Cas moaned brokenly. Dean felt himself getting close to his own release; he quickened his hips only slightly, but it was enough to make Cas gasp loudly and push himself onto his elbows to look into Dean’s eyes.
“You’re a
Castiel looked up to see Rachel. She came to a stop in front of him and Dean and smiled as she looked at him. Castiel couldn’t even make himself do anything but stare back for a long while. And then she darted her eyes to Dean for a second before she cleared her throat. Castiel shakily startled into action.

~  ~  ~
Dean smirked and oiled up his manhood before teasing Cas’s rim with the head of his cock. “You want me to just fuck into you?”
“Please!” He cried, trying to control his breathing. Dean pulled his fingers out and kissed up to Cas’s face.
Castiel laughed, watching as Dean disappeared into the kitchen and then waiting for Dean to come back.
Crowley’s face soured and he swirled his newly replenished wine. “I tried reading that book,” he said, “but I couldn’t finish it.”
“Yes,” Cas gasped, “Inside… Please, Dean… Please?”
“I’m making a pie,” he said. Dean squinted at him.
“You broke in?”
“Just,” Dean pushed him back slightly, “Just rock your hips.” Cas gasped as he felt Dean’s cock shift inside him. He moved his hips in the same way Dean had pushed him in and felt like he could faint.
“I do not want to wait,” Castiel said, “I want to do this now.”
“I’m sure you did,” Charlie muttered before grabbing a pair of scissors and cutting the nylon suture thread Gilda had invented. “All done.”
Dean couldn’t help the swelling sensation he got in his chest for Cas. “You’re special talent is being the best partner a man could ever ask for.”
“That’s a really great mindset,” he said. Dean stared at him for a second and smiled. He opened his mouth to speak again when the principal’s door opened and principal Harvelle called Dean in.
Cas loathed Heaven. Everything about it left a feeling of something to be desired deep inside his soul. It was an itch he’d never been able to scratch until he’d met Dean. He couldn’t wait until Dean took him and whisked him away from this wretched place.
By the time he got to the café Dean was at, he could barely keep a coherent thought, because he felt so… Alive. The whole day, it had been like the air was easier to breathe, the sky was a brighter blue, and Castiel didn’t feel like he was going through motions. He felt better than he had in years. And he knew that part of it was due to Dean, but the other part? It had to be that he hadn’t had his medication.
“What do you mean? She said that you guys dated for almost a year.”
“Omega,” Dean growled, making Castiel shiver.
“Just us, Captain,” the red-head woman said.
“Don’t worry, angel,” Dean said as pulled Cas back again and snapped his hips forward, causing Cas’s legs to give out. “I got you.” Dean held Cas up while still thrusting hips.
to get free.
“Mh-hm,” Cas hummed. “I know.” He kissed Dean’s chin. “I love you, too.”
“Cas?” Dean questioned, smiling as Castiel giggled.
“I do not want this!” Castiel cried, breathing deep to gain some semblance of control over himself, but it only made him cry harder, “I do not want to be your omega slave!”
“What? No, I’m coming with you.”
Dean sighed as he began putting groceries away.
Chapter Six
“I know so,” Dean chuckled, pulling Cas back against him roughly. Cas turned to give him a cocky smile. Dean grinned back at him and shoved his hips forwards while pulling Cas back. The movement had Cas gasping in surprise and gripping onto the sheet beneath him.
“Yes,” Cas answered. “Don’t talk so loud, though, Gabe. What if someone were to hear?”
“Of course, Your Majesty,” She said quietly. “I’ll be waiting for you in your chambers.”
“No,” Cas said. “I really liked it. I just… I want to try riding you, again,” he rushed out, resisting the urge to turn his head away from Dean to hide his blush.
Meg smiled and chuckled, “I know.”
Chapter Five
Castiel smiled fondly at the idea, but he really couldn’t. He had homework to do and all of his schoolwork was at his apartment.
“You want it harder?” Dean asked, a hint of disbelief in his voice.
love me. I-I…I’m not worthy of it. I’m not worthy of being loved. Not by anyone.”
Dean looked down at him and smiled warmly. “It was. But we we’re a little tired. So we’re just going to head in.”
Cas wailed, “Please fuck me,
“I’m Dean,” Dean said, sticking his hand out, “Cas’s friend.”
“May I take these off?” Dean asked.
“The summer before my freshman year of high school, I went to a summer camp for two weeks and while I was there, I met two older boys. An alpha and a beta. Back then I thought we were friends, but they were really just bullying and abusing me.” Castiel took a deep breath and squeezed his eyes shut. “They said rude things to me, pushed me around, and cruelly pranked me. The worst was when they forcibly undressed me and made me walk through the camp naked while the counselors we’re away in a meeting or something. I had to stand there while everyone laughed at me for twenty minutes before anyone came to help me.”
Cas yawned, stretching his back before rolling over and looking into Dean’s eyes. “I’m so exhausted.”
“Dean.”
Dean smiled, “If you want me to,” he said. “But you can also wear it if you want.”
“I’m about a block away from my apartment,” he said, and Dean’s smile faltered.
“You don’t get it, do you?” Gadreel said. “This isn’t about money or fame or pride.”
Dean smiled and said, “Since you asked so nicely.” He made quick work of undoing Cas's trousers and quickly swallowed his length down. Cas gasped, moving his hands to grip Dean’s hair firmly for leverage. He closed his eyes as Dean's tongue flattened against the underside of his cock — just the way Dean knew he liked — and threw his head back. Dean hollowed out his cheeks gently and flicked his tongue across Cas’s slit a few times.
“Is it on your way?” he asked slowly, and Dean gave him a lopsided smile.
“Feels so good,” Cas moaned, bringing his hand up and pushing his fingers into Dean’s mouth. Dean closed his eyes, moving his tongue between the digits and sucking the taste of Cas off them. There was a sweetness to it that made Dean shudder in appreciation.
“I do so swear,” Castiel said firmly. Bobby gave a slight nod as he turned to Dean again, too.
“N-no, it’s not—there’s no way. It’s not actually…”
“Please father, I’m sorry! I’ll do better!”
“Um, well, I… My father passed away a few weeks ago, and we held the memorial today,” Castiel said.
Dean closed his eyes, remembering what had happened that day. “It all happened so fast,” he said, opening his eyes to look at the ground. “The other ship was so fast at reloading their cannons.”
Cas smiled happily, “Bed,” he whispered, snuggling into Dean farther. “It took longer than I wanted.”
“It’s nice to see you never grew out of that stutter,” she teased.
“Oh,” Cas blushed again.
“Yes, I-I already prepped myself,” he said, “I’m ready to just… Have sex. You could literally bend me over right now and fuck me.”
Michael turned and walked swiftly out of the kitchen. Cas sighed and dropped his face into his hands.
"Please?" Castiel whimpered. He made a noise in the back of his throat that sounded like a sobbing whine a moment later. "Please, Alpha?" Tears streamed down his face as his hand not in Dean's hair pumped over his little cock furiously. Dean felt Castiel's hand clench and unclench in his hair. That was Castiel’s tell that he was close.
Dean nodded, picking up his pace and power behind each thrust. He could feel his orgasm approaching, but willed himself to hold it off. Cas’s legs squeezed around his hips and Dean groaned at the feel of how powerful Cas’s legs were. He leaned down to Cas’s neck and kissed over the unmarked skin. And at the first touch of his lips to Cas’s soft skin, he whined and bared his throat to Dean.
“You don’t have to hide anything from me,” Cas whispered, rubbing his thumbs over Dean’s eyelids. “You don’t have to pretend.”
“O-okay,” Castiel said, cursing himself for everything that was
“Y-yeah,” Castiel said, pulling the strap of his bookbag into his body to keep it from sliding off his shoulder. “Well, I don’t mean to inconvenience you further, so I should probably get going.”
“He’s in back digging through the hard candy I got.” Benny smiled.
“Toys,” he gasped, “I’ve used t-toys. That counts.”
“We don’t care about Dean!” Rachel said, and she sounded close to tears.
is going to happen.”
“No,” Cas said, “The medication isn’t talking right now; I’m talking.” Cas’s words were slurred and came out slow.
He was able to get to that place where he was almost asleep, but not quite, when he was woken again.
“He’s not here,” he repeated.
“Well… That’s… I doubt I could just bend you over and you’d be able to take my cock,” he said. Castiel took another step forward, nodding his head towards the inside of Dean’s house. Dean pushed off his door frame, stepping aside to let Castiel in.
Dean laughed in Cas’s ear. “You get such a dirty mouth when you don’t get what you want,” Dean whispered. “But that’d be too easy for you, angel. I want you to
pirate.” Cas sucked in a shaky breath, closing his eyes and tightening his legs around Dean’s waist.
“Morning, babe,” Dean said groggily, rubbing his eyes and smiling at Cas.
Cas was just getting home from observing a debate with his father. It had gone later than normal, and Michael was exhausted.
Castiel groaned and stomped his foot, but nodded. Dean slowly took his hand off Castiel’s mouth, hovering it close by in case he tried something.

“Right,” Dean breathed out. He took a moment to breathe in and then out in an attempt to ground himself. “What about… I… Thirty.”
“Oh, no, no, no. Cas is high maintenance,” he said, giving Jo a serious look.
’.” Castiel sat back in his chair. “Fucking ridiculous.”
“You… You’re going to walk me to school?”
“Oh…” Lucifer breathed out. “Dean, I had no idea. He didn’t tell me his name or anything and—”
“We were not supposed to say anything about that,” Charlie said in a rushed whisper. Meg winced at her tone, but shrugged as an apology still.
Cas had been on the brink of orgasm for the past
“What is happening to me?” Castiel asked, taking a long, deep drink of water. “I just lose it around Dean. One moment everything is going fine, and then I’m so angry and worked up, and then we get close and I’m fine again. I’m… So open with him. I share with him things I would
So how had the King known?
“I think that’s the right decision,” Gilda said. Cas smiled out at the water in agreement, keeping silent before he remembered what he’d seen in the mess the same night.
Dean kept his arms tight around Cas. He pushed his hips up to meet Cas’s movements as best he could. Cas was huffing out small breaths of air as he moved. Both had a warm and tender smile on their face. A smile they would only ever share with the other and never anyone else. A smile they’d never even share with themselves.
A few minutes later, the breach was open. A dark circle had taken place on the Bunker’s wall, undulating and growing second after second, the same way it had the day it came to collect Cas. Dean took an inspiration and with no hesitation, threw himself into it.
Dean instantly regretted opening his mouth. He rolled his eyes, trying to look casual, but his look awkwardly drifted to the angel sitting next to him.
When he finally came back to the bunker, he never mentioned what happened again.
“I’ve been thinking about it for a while now… I’m confident that what we have is what I’ve been looking for my whole life. Everything just… clicks, when I’m with her. I didn’t think it would happen again, after Jess.’’
Sam frowned. “You got a serious lead on that?’’
“I’m coming with you,’’ Cas signed.
“Well… the last time I thought about marriage, it was with Jessica… and I lost her. In the worst possible way.’’
A beat.
“Cas, you’re okay?’’
He had then given him an earnest answer. “Can’t. Won’t.’’
The young man seemed thoughtful for a second. “But what if they were mutual? Wouldn’t it be better if…’’
They had stayed silent for a moment, staring at each other from opposite sides of the room. Dean had felt his hands become sweaty, his breath racing. He had taken a new step inside the room, had closed the door behind him. He was now standing near the entrance, his eyes fixated on Cas, who was next to his bed. The silence of the room was only troubled by the sound of their respective breath, which added some kind of weight to the moment.
“You’re gonna what? Yell at me to death?’’ she said mockingly. “You can do nothing against me.’’
— a part of him was going to die with Cas.
Cas came closer to him again and slowly kissed him, trying to convey all the love he had for him. Dean had put his hand on the angel’s cheek and was now tenderly caressing it.
“Dean…“
Cas stuttered, which usually never happened. “I… yeah… I mean… this is usually how it worked. Love is the most human feeling of all, and only humans could inspire an angel to feel it.’’
“Of course I love the Winchesters. They are my family.’’
Dean took a few steps in his direction and threw himself into his arms, in a tight embrace. Cas responded with the same intensity, closing his eyes. For a short moment, they allowed themselves to put everything aside.
“How are you holding up?’’ he asked to the former angel, his full attention on him.
“No bad surprises? During your hunt?’’
“Clearly, me neither…’’
Cas took a moment to process what Dean was trying to say. He didn’t dare to believe it, but Dean was breathing heavily now, and everything was pointing in that direction. The angel’s heart was pounding really fast in his chest. It left him speechless for a few seconds.
When Dean had come to his door that night, to make sure Cas’ wound after their hunt didn’t need more care, their conversation had derailed incredibly fast.
Dean looked deeply confused. “Huh?’’
much. I don’t even remember a time I didn’t. In spite of the mark, but even before that, you kept me closer to humanity —as human as an angel can be. I’ll never thank you enough for that,“ he smiled through his tears. “But Dean… don’t waste your life carrying a torch for me. You deserve so much better than that.“
“Have you ever been in love?’’
"I’m not blaming you, I’m just telling you that I need you to be honest with me because I love you!" he yelled in an angry voice.
Cas sighed. “Like I said, it doesn’t matter. Dean doesn’t deserve that kind of weight to be put on his shoulders. My feelings are my own, he shouldn’t have to handle them.’’
Dean and Cas came down the stairs and walked in their direction.
Sam appeared in the hall, coming from the corridor. “Hey,’’ he said to the couple. An intrigued look appeared on his face. “What are you up to?’’
"We had so many things going on, you and I, and I never wanted my feelings to be a burden. I never had the courage to believe -not even once- that you’d feel the same way. Because the truth is that I always loved you, Dean."
Little did he know about the inner battle that was currently raging in the eldest Winchester’s mind —battle he had lost many times in the past few days, actually. Hesitation, fear of doing everything wrong, of the unknown, of giving his life a new turn, of experiencing his feelings in a way he never had before… all of this was holding him back. The love thing wasn’t something Dean was comfortable with. Not because he didn’t felt it —he felt it
“Life is short,’’ Cas said with a shrug. “There is a lot of different forms of art, I don’t want to limit myself to only a few of them.’’ He smiled and teasingly nudged Dean, who looked disappointed.
