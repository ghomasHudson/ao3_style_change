John pulled out Sherlock’s plate after heating it. He took both of them into the sitting room and put the plates on the coffee table before sitting in between Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock adjusted himself so that he could curl his right leg behind John’s back and let the other hang off the edge.
“I shouldn’t have said that,” John said from the doorway. Sherlock kept himself tall and continued to stare straight at the faucet. John stepped in and sat on the toilet with a sigh.
“Swallow it all.” Sherlock gulped it down with his mouth open, savoring the bitter warmth of it. John tilted Sherlock’s chin up and reentered Sherlock’s mouth for him to clean off with his tongue. The sensitivity was almost unbearable as the detective lapped up the cooling cum off his cock and kissed it wetly. John thrust again, reluctant to leave the warmth of Sherlock’s mouth, but watching the haze in Sherlock’s normally razor-edged stare reminded him that his turn was over.
Sherlock suddenly faced him, splashing water onto the floor. “We would never get anything done!” John chuckled and kissed the side of Sherlock’s mouth.
John followed Sherlock’s line of sight to the dresser. The last time he dug through it, he had noticed that a particular jumper had not been folded properly, or at least not to military standards, but he had thought nothing of it and simply refolded it. Looking at the lost gaze in Sherlock’s eyes, he grabbed Sherlock’s hand and led him carefully to the drawers.
John withdrew his cock and tucked himself away despite Sherlock’s whine. He stared down at Sherlock’s lax body, mouth red from use and gaze far-away.
Down in the morgue, the icy eyed stranger took a riding crop to a dead man. He was panting hard by the end of the thwacking and rolled his shoulders. His hair was a mess of dark curls when he turned to face the window, jotting down notes in a little black notebook. He looked up and met John’s stare instead of Molly’s. John was finally able to get a good look at him. The man was tall and svelte with sharp cheekbones and perfectly defined heart-shaped lips. He had reasonably dark circles under his eyes, stark against his pale skin. John decided that his features were hawk-like, and wondered if the man was as predatory.
“Yes, well, let’s remember the last time you said you could care for yourself.” Sherlock lowered his head and glowered at Greg through his eyelashes.
“Brilliant,” he whispered into Sherlock’s ear. Shivers ran up Sherlock’s spine and prickled his skin. Heat warmed his stomach.
Sherlock sat quietly tapping away at his phone in the corner of a Vietnamese restaurant. A bowl of chicken broth steamed in front of him. When eating felt like too much of a chore, he settled his anxiety with broth rather than cocaine.
Sherlock’s mouth twisted in a bitter scowl. “I say, Lestrade, your ex-wife must be really irksome that you believe you can speak to me that way.”
“I’ve brought you some of your favorite sweets. I don’t want to see a single one left when I come to check on you later.” Sherlock nodded into his mug. Mrs. Hudson gave his arm a gentle squeeze before leaving the flat, casting one more warning glance at John. Sherlock went into the sitting room, threw himself onto the sofa, and began picking at the tray Mrs. Hudson brought up.
Sherlock reached out to him with a quivering hand. John shoved it away from him. “Look at you. You are just a bloody addict. I don’t even know you. I am a
He picked up his mobile, wrapping his scarf around his neck. “Got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.”
As Sherlock straightened himself and put his magnifier away, John went forward and placed his hand at the small of his back.
John rolled his eyes and took a sip of his. “Thanks,” he chuckled sarcastically. He watched as Sherlock’s hand quaked when he brought the cup to his lips.
“To recover my initial data and delete what it was that was causing the corruption.” Sherlock adjusted himself higher on the bed and finally faced John. His weary face softened at Sherlock’s gaze, hand tightening around Sherlock’s.
“My last patient cancelled, so I thought I would raid Sherlock’s takeaway rather than order my own.”
John corrected mentally. He may not know how John hesitated to call emergency when he passed out, but the wounds on his hand were obviously from fighting. There was only so much John could keep from Sherlock.
Vomit splattered onto the hospital floor. John jumped for one of the spare bedpans under the bed. He held it up toward Sherlock’s quaking body, rubbing circles into the back of his clammy neck. Sherlock let his head loll forward. John put down the bedpan and gently lifted his head, easing him back against the bed by the shoulders. Sherlock eyed him intently.
“And it was there, outside of Bart’s, that I met Mary. I thought it was fate’s way of saying that it wasn’t my time yet, and I went with it.” John pressed his palms into his eyes, trying to shove back the memories of a false marriage. “But then you turned up again, and God! I should have known that you would not leave me. I wanted to believe in the long glances you’d give me or the gentle way you would touch me when you weren’t watching your movements. I was furious for a few days, but all I could think about was that crooked smile of yours and how you get less and less funny the more uncomfortable you feel.
Sherlock didn’t care for the absurdity of romance; he’d always managed the sex easily. Just actions of the Transport. But this was different. There was unfamiliar sentimentality attached to all this that made him blush, made him feel weak. Sherlock was quick to fall to John’s feet to satisfy the other man. Anything for him. Anything to repay him for the pain he subjected him to and for the pain he caused others on his behalf.
Sherlock lifted his hands to cup John’s tanned face. Oh how beautiful he was- the man that anchored him. Every line, furrow, freckle, and pore was perfect under Sherlock’s scrutinizing gaze. Those awful jumpers made him look soft and meek when he obviously knew otherwise. Of course, Sherlock could deduce him. John wasn’t a difficult man; he wore his life story like he did those jumpers. What made him so unordinary- even by Sherlock’s standards- was John’s natural ability to deceive everyone with his appearance. A middle-aged ex-army doctor with a proclivity for unassuming clothing was hardly worth a second glance, but underneath all of that was a man who craved excitement, adrenaline. He could shoot a man with unwavering quickness and steady hands. He was solid, earthy, and real. John was something to hold onto when Sherlock disappeared into the confines of his own mind.
During the entirety of dinner, their eyes never wavered from each other’s except to look down at their own food. They sat across from one another, feet rubbing against each other accidently. After a while though, those “accidental” touches were becoming blatant caresses, sometimes trailing up their pant legs.
Lestrade tried to ignore the obvious in front of him. It wasn’t very long since he’s known John, but Sherlock? He knew something had changed in his old friend. With every new deduction, Sherlock’s eyes would glitter with John’s praise. The touching was slight between them: shoulder nudges and grazing hands. The rest of Lestrade’s team exchanged expectant glances. They had noticed the change in the detective’s demeanor as soon as John Watson entered the picture. He was still a huge pain in the neck, but the insults he hurled at them had weakened, and were more annoying than hurtful.
“I don’t want you to make it up to me,” Sherlock barked, finally facing John’s tired face. “I want you to never say that word to me again. Learn from this error, John, as I will not allow it to happen again.” Sherlock’s firm voice took John by surprise. Sherlock was more sensitive, but this wasn’t what he expected. He forced himself out of bed to calm a possibly teary-eyed Sherlock, but this cold-stare man was what he got.
Sherlock was required to take it easy and keep up with his medication. John had hoped that the next few days after his discharge would be quiet and boring, to say the least. Sherlock would be able to actually go through the stack of cold case files Lestrade brought him a while ago, but the familiar
John turned against Sherlock and pressed his mouth into Sherlock’s softly. Their kisses quickly became more urgent, pressing their bodies harder into each other. John reached in between them and cupped Sherlock’s aching cock. Sherlock gasped into the other man’s mouth. He slid away from John’s lips and licked and mouthed at the spot behind his jaw. John continued to palm Sherlock through his bottoms.
“Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty.” Sherlock’s head swam. It was so difficult to look at him, to see the fear contort his sun kissed face into confusion and pain. He glanced away to swallow hard against the rising sob in his throat. Moriarty’s cooling body grinned at the sky.
“Only if I was equally so,” Sherlock laughed. “I wouldn’t want to be caught solving cases with an old man.”
“Do you want to know what we did together? Do you know how he likes it?” John grabbed his good arm and dislocated that shoulder as well.
John greeted the other men before pausing at Sherlock’s stall. Sherlock’s heart beat rapidly. He tried his best to keep his breathing calm, but he could feel John’s presence thick in the air, predatory and intoxicating. Sherlock’s trousers were tighter across his lap with his cock half-erect. With just enough sense, Sherlock considered how pathetic he must look, waiting for John to violate him in the loo of a cheap pub. Sherlock’s breath hitched as he watched John’s feet shift with movement just as he opened the stall door and stepped in as if there wasn’t a grown man taking up a majority of its space. John had Sherlock’s coat in hand and hung it on the small hook on the back of the door, just covering the crack between the door and the frame. The coat fell just an inch away from the floor, and Sherlock thanked whoever would hear it that his favorite (and expensive) coat wasn’t subjected to the bacterially hazardous floor.
“Welcome to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, Doctor Watson. You’re expected in the morgue downstairs. Just follow the signs.”
Sherlock leaned back against John’s chest with a satisfied hum and rested the back of his head in the crook of John’s neck. John rinsed off his hair with water gathered in his cupped hands.
, even after he came down, and John’s suggestion had piqued his interest. Sherlock shivered at the thought.
. She remembered the brothers bickering on the plane and still wonders what was written in that list.
He was just sitting there fidgeting with the plate of biscuits when John could be thinking about God-knows-what! Sherlock pushed away from the table and entered their bedroom. John was snoozing quietly with the covers over his head. The sunlight streamed in brightly, bathing John’s sleeping form in grey light. Sherlock moved quietly to sit at the edge of the bed. He carefully eased himself along John’s side before lying beside him. John stirred when Sherlock pressed into his back.
When John pointed his Sig at Victor’s face, he expected the gun aimed back at him. What he didn’t expect was the cheerful look on his face.
“That’s because you say everything on that bloody mind of yours.” Lestrade sat back in his desk chair. “I know it must’ve been hard for you to share that with me, and I really appreciate that you came to speak to me about it, rather than going off on some binge or getting yourself into alleyway chases.”
“Sherlock,” John whispered. “I don’t know how I can possibly make up for my mistakes. I won’t remind you of what it was I did, especially if it was deleted, but I know exactly what poisoned that amazing brain of yours. I can’t forgive my actions, just like I don’t expect you to, but I am going to do my best. That also means that I can’t allow you to destroy yourself like this. I can understand why you did it this last time, but I refuse to let you kill yourself. I have no problem forgiving you for lying, but please, Sherlock, don’t do this again. I can’t let you die from something so beneath you.” John leaned forward and kissed Sherlock’s cheek.
“What happened with Sherlock?” John couldn’t sit there any longer and bolted out the car. Lestrade jumped out after him.
Lestrade sighed, “Unfortunately.” Sherlock whipped his head toward John with a glimmer of excitement in his eyes. John narrowed his gaze at him.
Sherlock and John rested in the tub together. John massaged Sherlock’s scalp gently with his expensive shampoo and carded his fingers through his hair. Sherlock rested his head on his raised knees.
“My shoulder,” John smirked. Sherlock looked away embarrassed; he never wanted John to learn that Sherlock considered his shoulder a point of weakness. Physiologically speaking, it had been compromised, but he never expected to reveal that knowledge.
Their height difference was solved with Sherlock seated, but even though Sherlock had swallowed John down plenty of times in the past, the aggression by which John shoved into his mouth was new. John held tightly onto Sherlock’s throat as he fucked into his mouth. Sherlock tried his best to keep eye contact with him. That was one of Sherlock’s major requirements in their relationship: that he got to see the changes in John’s facial expressions when they were together. Sherlock wanted to file away every crease and muscle twitch in his Mind Palace for future use, whether it be to determine John’s mood, or to just wank off to when John was away too long at surgery.
He didn’t. He didn’t want to do anything now. It was so tiring to move. Why couldn’t John just let him sit there silently? Couldn’t he see that the world was spinning too fast to catch up? John sat down. He sounded tired. Was he sleeping? Sherlock couldn’t tell. He didn’t really want to look at John. John’s beautiful face would crack and split in sadness if he faced him. He didn’t want John’s face to change. Not because of him.
John finally said goodbye to the last patient of the morning and threw himself in his chair. He ran his hand through his hair, feeling a migraine coming on, and checked his phone. There was only a message from Greg asking if he wanted to get together after work for a pint. John answered back with a “God yes.”
Sherlock wrapped the belt around his bicep and tightened it with his teeth. The state of his veins may not be the best, but he had some that could still withstand the cocaine. He stuck the needle into the vial and pulled the plunger back. Tightening his fist, he took a deep breath, opened his palm, and pressed the needle in. The sharp pinch hardly bothered him anymore. He pulled back, drawing blood in, and pushed, releasing the belt. A slight burn crawled up his arm and spread across his skin. He recapped the syringe and laid back on the bed, vision tunneling.
against his head. John tucked his gun into the waist of his jeans and stepped on the man’s knee with his whole weight. Bone cracked and ground beneath his trainer. Victor’s eyes widened and his lips tightened, but he never let out a scream. John felt three times as larger than the man below him. It was clear who was in charge, but Victor dared to challenge that.
“Be sure Ms. Hooper checks on the last row of corpses within the hour. I don’t need her botching one of my experiments.” The way he spoke was both elegant and clipped in baritone.
John had his eyes closed against the idiotic and regretful situation he had just placed himself in. He didn’t mean for it to come out; a thought like that would just normally stay hidden away in his head, but with Sherlock being so. . . Sherlock, it just slipped.
“Don’t ignore me, Sherl.” Victor sat down in the chair across from him, gently lifting it by the back so it wouldn’t scrape the floor.
“Yoo-hoo,” Mrs. Hudson called gently from the doorway. She held a tray of fruit tarts and biscuits. “I’m glad to see you’re finally settled in.”
Sherlock’s face was splotchy with broken blood vessels and bruises. John released Sherlock and bent down to observe his face closer. Sherlock tried to turn, to hide his face again, but John held his chin and bared his face to the light.
, he’d say, but when his sister came out, his family had not received it all that well. How would they have reacted if their veteran son had come out as being interested in both men and women? He kept his relationships with men mostly quiet, and when he went away to Afghanistan, he didn’t expect to meet a man like Sholto. He was incredibly stoic and soft-spoken despite his profession. He and John fit so well together, but they knew that it wasn’t going to be anything long-lasting. There was no room for relationships in war.
Neither of them had brought up how Sherlock had gotten the straight open wounds that cross-hatched his body. Sherlock was thankful for that as much as he was for John’s gentle hands now. The bamboo switch Victor had used on him left bloody red welts across his skin. Every time he would hit the same spot again, Sherlock’s skin would split and burn, but with the cocaine coursing through his system, every hit felt intensely orgasmic.
But then again, he had never known someone like he knew John. There was Mycroft, but that was purely out of blood relation and not something he would have been willing to develop if not for that minor fact. He observed John while he stared at the birds.
“You have yet to eat.” Sherlock wrapped a soft hand around John’s shoulder. “You are constantly badgering me to eat, and yet you’ve done nothing but lay here,”
“Before you roll your eyes at the commonness of this gesture, I want to you to know that it’ll always be you and me against the rest of the world.” John opened the box to reveal a multi-metal ring settled in more black velvet.
The DI listened to Sherlock spout off his observations at lightning speed. “The bullet they just dug out of the wall’s from a hand gun. Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon – that’s a crack shot you’re looking for, but not just a marksman- a fighter. His hands couldn’t have shaken at all, so clearly he’s acclimatized to violence. He didn’t fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You’re looking for a man probably with a history of military service.” Sherlock glances around the area and sees John watching him from behind the police tape.
Ahead of him, a homeless man huddled in blankets under a shop canopy with an upturned scraggly hat next to him. John reached into his pocket for some loose change. Just as he was about to bend to drop it in, the man glanced up at him with a steely glare.
Sherlock chided himself. John was waiting; the concern on his face was growing. John was never really good at pretending to be patient.
“As opposed to other times?” Sherlock glared at him with a disgusted scowl. John turned his cheek to Sherlock to ease the pain of that look.
Those razor-edged eyes were dark when Sherlock leaned into John’s ear with a devilish twist of his mouth.
John nodded and helped Sherlock toward the sitting room where he collected their spare medical kit and water that Sherlock immediately gulped down. Sherlock stumbled up the steps, but John held strong to him.
John shook his head. “You had every right to be, but let’s move on from that. I forgive you, and I’ll do everything in my power to deserve the Great Detective.”
He couldn’t go with him. Sherlock would figure out that John hesitated once he was treated, so John walked away from him.
Sherlock hovered in the doorway. John was staring off into space, eyes lost in the pattern of the carpet. It had hit him so hard. This domestic bliss was short-term, just momentary peace while Sherlock was too weak to go out on his own, jumping across rooftops and tackling men twice his weight; all this was just a ruse.
Sherlock snapped his eyes open. Sweat drenched his curls and back. His stomach twisted hard, and he vomited all over the floor. He hung his head between his knees. Sherlock should be relieved that his mind palace was reset, and John was his excellent self again, but he felt like he had been beaten and thrown into the Thames. Sherlock touched John’s jumper to find it sweat-soaked. He found his mobile and opened three messages from John.
“Open.” John released Sherlock’s mouth to let the taller man drop open his mouth. John undid his jeans and pulled out his thick cock. Sherlock swore to himself. A lot of people might agree that Sherlock Holmes has a big mouth, but for John’s dick, it was hardly enough.
John slid his tongue into Sherlock’s parted lips and was glad that Sherlock had the same idea. Their tongues danced together, sugar and tea sweetening their mouths. Sherlock pressed forward. John’s lower back pushed against the edge of the counter. He could feel Sherlock’s hardening erection against his hip. All Sherlock could hear was the sound of John’s breathing mixed with his own. He could feel it against his face every now and then when the good doctor remembered to breathe.
Sherlock recognized the situation he was in. He had been in it before many years ago. Victor had threatened to out his drug use to his family, and the only way out of that was to keep his mouth shut and do as Victor pleased. Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat. He never wanted to go this route again, especially not with him. Sherlock tried to smother the panic that tightened his chest, but the more he tried, the wider Victor’s smile grew. Victor reached into shirt pocket and held a small parchment package between his fingertips.
“Are you man enough to hear it?” Victor yelled. Finally, a reaction other than sick glee. John stuck his thumb in his eye until Victor begged for him to stop.
“Um, Sergeant Donovan’s just been explaining everything, the two pills. Been a dreadful business, hasn’t it? Dreadful.” John muttered.
“He is,” Mrs. Hudson confirmed with a pointed look toward his direction. “I’ll be out of your hair in a few, Sherlock. I just wanted to see how you were doing once you were up.”
Sherlock stepped into his mind palace where Mary didn’t exist and John would press against his back in bed, laying gentle morning kisses into his hair. John would nuzzle into Sherlock’s neck, sliding his hands into the waistband of his pajama pants and caressing the spot where his hip met his thigh.
John’s hand tightened around his throat and pushed him until the back of his head met the tile. Sherlock hollowed out his cheeks and kept as still as possible while John kept up a punishing pace. Saliva flowed freely from the corners of his mouth, coating his clothed hard-on. The head of John’s cock was threatening to choke him as he gagged and coughed around it. Sherlock’s arse was slipping from the toilet. He reached out for the bar on the wall to keep himself up, other hand scrabbling for purchase on John’s straining forearm. The tight grip on Sherlock’s throat was making the loo around him swirl and drag; his strained breathing sounded muffled to his own ears.
“I was going to ask what it was about, but I figured Sherlock was not in the know.” John nodded, turning his body to keep an eye out for Sherlock. Lestrade crossed his arms.
John shook his head and accepted the tea from Sherlock. As he drank, he considered that he had almost tried to find an answer to that question. He had been on the edge and gave too much thought to the idea. It was a dangerous path to continue down, and he had to be more careful not to venture down there again.
“Please,” John pleaded, eyebrows furrowed softly. “I just need to make sure he’s well.” The woman sighed and allowed him in. John raced up the steps and burst through the flat he knew almost as well as his.
He and John had sat there in silence for what felt like hours. Sherlock thought that maybe John had fallen asleep at the table, and he could hole himself up in his room for the rest of the weekend, but the moment Sherlock looked like he was about to move, John stood.
“I would do it again. I would hear you call me a machine time and time again if it meant you would be safe at 221B.”
“How about I try again?” Sherlock jerked his head up. John pointed to his own head. “Think it, and I’m going to try to read your mind. Keep saying it over and over.” Sherlock didn’t understand what fool thing John was trying to do, but he closed his eyes and thought over and over, chanting in his head like he was reciting a prayer. John smiled to himself. Sherlock’s hands moved at his sides. His thoughts never managed to stay in his head; John just needed to wait until they reached his mouth.
Sherlock straightened his back and lined up his feet. John kept his breathing even. Sherlock’s various poses were like an instruction manual full of boldly typed warnings.
“We need to have you tested.” Sherlock frowned. “For my peace of mind.” Sherlock agreed and pressed his forehead to John’s.
He placed the gun in the top drawer of the side desk with the loose pens and paper. The warmth of the metal left him feeling cold when he slid the drawer shut. He took a seat on the small bed with clasped hands. How he had managed to get himself here was beyond him. John didn’t believe in a god, but he couldn’t help but feel that he was being punished for all the lives he had taken and all the lives he had failed to save. The room was quiet save for the noise outside the window, but the silence felt deafeningly loud, and he could feel the pull toward his gun again. It wasn’t the first time he had felt it. So many nights listening to the groans of agony from his fellow soldiers in the infirmary made him wish that he could taste the gunpowder and oil from the muzzle. He had wondered if the death would be instant, or how much blood would be splattered across the wall. Of course, he knew the answers to those questions. He had seen it countless times. Bullets ripping through the air to pierce his friends through their foreheads. John had run over immediately, dodging enemy fire, to discover that they were already dead, but in that hospital bed, he thought that maybe it would be different for him. He knew otherwise. He was a doctor after all, but the thought remained until he was sent to London.
Lestrade gave John a stern look. “What do you want with him?” John glanced over to Sherlock’s room where his shadow danced across the floor beneath the door.
Suddenly, the bathroom was just too tight. The air had been sucked out so fast, his head spun. Darkness circled the edges of his vision. He reached for the door handle, calling out for Sherlock. His words sounded slow and slurred. He just managed the door before collapsing into Sherlock’s chest. The other man held strong and gently lowered John to the floor. Sherlock quickly bent John’s knees and placed a hand under his head. He had spent a good portion of his youth fainting. Ignoring his body’s need for food usually came at such a price.
Sherlock radiated arrogant strength despite his thin body, but he knew that the man was a lithe predator under all that coat. John had treated stab wounds and stitched Sherlock enough to know what that lean muscle felt like under his fingers. How he craved to know how his skin felt when it was hot with arousal, writhing under his hands.
John leaned against the table in the kitchen as Sherlock pulled boxes from the bags. “Being predictable isn’t always a bad thing.”
“I’m afraid John is just frustrated, but return to your biscuits, Mrs. Hudson. I will handle it.” She stared at Sherlock. The sound of fabric tearing and angry sobs filled the flat as John slashed his armchair. “Please,” he whispered. Mrs. Hudson reluctantly stepped back onto the steps and rushed down. Sherlock turned back into the sitting room.
“I want to spend the rest of my life making up for all the terrible things I have done to you.” John pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s. “Let’s make up all the time we wasted pretending that we were just flatmates.”
When Sherlock didn’t answer, Victor dipped his head to meet his gaze. “I’ll ask my original question then. What have you come to forget, Sherlock?”
Arms wrapped around his body and two hands pressed their palms to his chest. He tensed up against them. A familiar body pressed into his back. Relief washed over him. Lips grazed his neck.
Sherlock growled through tight lips. John hurried to hand him the cup of ice chips that the nurse had just recently brought before Sherlock decided to make a mess of the floor. Sherlock greedily swallowed down the entire cup. John had left the room to alert the nurse of Sherlock’s consciousness.
The other man was breathing deeply, trembling slightly as John pressed his fingers in for his pulse.
The next time Sherlock had a few hours to himself, he could do it. He would have enough time to fall from his high as well. Hopefully after that, he would be able to look at John without seeing his own blood spattered on his fists.
“Your wife needs surgery immediately, Doctor Watson. You will just have to wait until she is stable, and your baby has been delivered.” They left John behind the double doors. Sherlock stood from his sprawled position in the waiting room. When they had first arrived, there had been a whole other family, but they were gone. Sherlock must’ve scared them away.
“It wasn’t deep enough to require stitches, but I get the sense that he wasn’t aware he was doing it.”
Sherlock wanted to see John’s face change, of course, but for good things like a solved case, fresh warm bread at Angelo’s, and when they would kiss. He wanted to see what his face would look like twenty, thirty years from now, wrinkled from laughter and worry. Sherlock wanted to see all that on John’s face, but without a doubt, he did not want to witness the sadness and disappointment he would certainly see once he faced him.
Sherlock popped his medication after hearing John nag at him for the past three hours. He continued to pick at the sugar-free biscuits Mrs. Hudson had brought up earlier. John had the day off from work and was pestering him to eat, despite not eating himself. Sherlock thought that John would have learned that he didn’t always have to eat, but Sherlock simply complied. Sherlock took note of the time- ten past one in the afternoon. Normally, it was Sherlock who spent his days off lazing about, but John was still in bed under the covers. He had risen long enough to irritate Sherlock, but then it was straight back to bed. Sherlock wondered if his emotional instability was returning. He had hoped that their new sexual relationship would keep it at bay, but with John seeming unlike himself, Sherlock had reason to doubt.
At the next floor, Sherlock threw his body into John’s door, but it did not budge. He rattled the locked doorknob. John reached the top step, not a single hair out of place.
They stood there in the middle of the parking lot, letting John’s words sink in. Lestrade was grateful that he was called. He was certainly aware of the illegal acts both he and Sherlock did, but without any concrete proof, there was no way he could even consider them suspects. It was a perk of having a friend in law enforcement. So, for John to call him after what had gone down with Victor Trevor, he knew that John had taken it as far as he could. Lestrade thought back to Sherlock’s bruised and cut up face. Was that what John was referring to?
He hadn’t aimed his gun at someone other than himself in a while, and the fact that he was doing it to protect Sherlock made that trigger that much easier to pull. He watched as Detective Inspector Lestrade approached Sherlock about what had happened. He had a shock blanket wrapped around his shoulders, and John could not help but snap a faraway picture of the brooding man.
Sherlock slid the buttons out and let the shirt slip to the floor. His heart hammered against his ribcage. John stared at his front, eyes grazing over the familiar stab wounds and bullet grazes he had stitched up himself. Sherlock could tell there were questions forming in his head.
Sherlock sat quietly, desperate to figure out why John was so upset, especially over things that were not true. He had always valued John. Since the moment he passed his mobile to him after just meeting him, he had known that this man was someone he could trust. His loyalty was written on his weathered face. Sherlock never just dragged him along, as much as it might have seemed that way; John was invaluable to Sherlock’s deductions, and he provided a perspective that Sherlock was not familiar with. John was the reason why so many people approached him; he gave him warmth. Of course, as much as he felt that John romanticized his work, it was because of him that he even had the mass amount of cases to sift through. Sherlock knew that he did not express these thoughts well, and he had difficulty articulating anything without an air of arrogance, but John was the closest thing he had to a friend. He missed the long hours of sitting together in their flat, John nagging over his inability to sit still and keep from walking on the furniture. Sherlock would watch him from the corner of his eye and marvel at the different ways John’s expressions would change, even the slightest, while he watched crap telly or read the newspaper. Sherlock could admit that he might not be a good man, but John made him better, and isn’t that what made partnerships work? Making each other better? All Sherlock wanted was to lay next to John and memorize every inch of his person. Every freckle, scar, birthmark, he wanted to file away in that warm room in his mind palace where he kept everything that reminded him of John. Everything else was placed in their respective rooms and left there to gather dust until he thought it necessary to bring them out again, but John, he had free reign over his mind palace. He would march through the halls, peering into rooms with his Sig tucked into the back of his jeans. Occasionally, he would pull files, and ask Sherlock what things meant, and despite the lack of patience he had in reality, he would spend hours in his head, following John around and answering his questions. It had never bothered him; John was genuinely curious about the secrets he held, and he never judged him when he revealed them. He loved John as much as he thought he could, but Sherlock knew that he could do more. It had just been such a long time.
“I researched you. Before we met, I discovered everything that I could to impress you. It’s a trick. Just a magic trick.”
“I already said yes to your proposal,” John whispered. Sherlock straightened out of his slouch. “But I wanted to give you something to show the rest of the world that we’re more than just a team.”
John had moved the last of his belongings back into Baker Street a few days later on the condition that Sherlock present any and all cocaine in the flat to him first. John sat on the sofa with a prepped vial held between his fingers. There was nothing on it- no label, no markings, nothing. It may have looked harmless to others, but as John stared up at Sherlock’s healing marks and the sickly pallor of his face, he knew otherwise. Sherlock hadn’t gone through the worst stages of withdrawal yet. The body aches and sweats had already begun. He and Sherlock had to do the washing twice already since they decided that John would be returning to Baker Street, because Sherlock had sweat through most of his lounge wear.
people might’ve found this odd, but it was the best thing to do between them, breathing each other’s air and seeing their own reflections in the other man’s stare.
“How can my doctor guide my recovery when he does not care for his own wellbeing?” John’s mouth quirked. John settled on the couch while Sherlock made tea.
“Well, we all can’t be idiots like you, John.” Sherlock froze immediately after the words escaped his lips. “My apologies,” he placed his hands over John’s on his chest. “I’m trying to lessen my insults toward you.”
“Enough!” John hurled the cup. It shattered against the wall in hundreds of ceramic chunks and slivers. Hot tea splattered across the bookshelves and back onto John’s skin. Sherlock remained still in his seat. It was the most energy he had gotten out of John this week. John’s hands shook; tears lingered at the corners of his eyes. Sherlock sifted through his data, just something that would help in this situation, but there was nothing that would come across as genuine. The last thing he wanted to do was harm their friendship because of his lack of “people skills.” John would have said it was just common decency, but Sherlock found that in that moment, he had nothing that he hadn’t already used for a case. John would see through his ruse immediately.
“When I found Sherlock strung out in a dirty alleyway all those years ago, the only thing he asked for was this guy named Victor. When he sobered up, he refused to say any more about the guy, but when he placed his call to bail him out, I copied down the number he rang. I’ve had that number saved in his file for years.”
“I,” Sherlock choked out an octave higher than intended, throat suddenly dry. “I never thought I would hear that from you.”
Hands gripped the sides of his face. His chest ached so much. He reached up and felt those familiar steady hands.
“What is it,” Sherlock growled in frustration. John gently touched the skin around the healed bullet wound. It had healed better than his own. The infection that had struck him did not happen to Sherlock, and John was grateful for that. He didn’t think he would be able to forgive himself for letting him got shot in the first place.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I just got a little bit dizzy is all,” he soothed. “You’re just perfect. Come here,” he motioned over. Sherlock sat on the arm of the chair, leaning down into John’s neck. John ran his fingers down Sherlock’s neck and whispered sweet words in his ear.
Greg had to clear his throat to get their attention once more. The scene in front of him sent a jolt straight to his crotch, making him yearn for the passion they had.
“I’ve not seen him enough lately to tell you what I think,” she blew on her tea. “But it has never struck me that John would be the destructive kind of angry.”
John stepped into the sitting room when the front door slammed shut, dressed for work. He had heard Sherlock cursing to himself in his regular flurry of motion downstairs as he hovered around his bedroom door, wondering if Sherlock could stomach being around him. John went into the kitchen to find it unsurprisingly cold and busied himself with making tea and tipping out a couple of Sherlock’s favorite ginger biscuits. He settled into the sofa and flipped through channels aimlessly.
“I am a bloody doctor, and I refuse to let my friend wake up to a bunch of strangers.” The man weighed his options and decided that it would be better to let the doctor ride with them if it meant avoiding a fight.
fuck me.” Sherlock swearing was a rarity, but for him to speak so candidly about their sexual relationship? That was a shock to John’s system, but one he welcomed greatly.
“I will consult when Lestrade notifies me regardless of my own personal health. Besides, this is just a vessel.” His hand motioned to his curled up body lazily.
He held the cup to his lips when something struck him in the gut. A sharp pain ran its way up to his sternum. He looked down and thought he might see a bullet wound or something of the kind, but he saw nothing. Nausea rolled through him and he couldn’t catch his breath. He still doesn’t know what made him look over into Sherlock’s flat, but he doesn’t regret it.
Victor had no time to react. John slammed his wrist against the wall and disabled his arm with a grueling twist of the shoulder. John turned and swept out his feet from under him. Victor fell to the ground with a heavy
Sherlock brushed the crumbs off John’s jumper and sat down. The shift of fabric over his chest gave him chills. One day he hoped that John would caress his chest just like his jumper, gentle and warm. Heat gathered in his lower belly. His eyes fluttered closed.
John was more than certain that he loved that great git in the other room, and the fact that Sherlock had a drug problem didn’t change that, but it certainly disappointed him. A man with such a big brain thought so little of what it would do to him in the long run. John worried at his lower lip. Maybe he had put too much stress onto Sherlock. Flaunting his marriage in front of him while stealing kisses in the flat during lunch breaks must’ve upset him. And if that didn’t do it, John pummeling him on the floor did the trick. John rested his head on his hand.
“Not really,” John said flatly. Sherlock was easy. The moment he thinks you’re not that interested in what he has to say, the more likely he is to spill. Sherlock whispered something from the sitting room, but John was too preoccupied opening a bag of crisps to drown out Sherlock’s attempts to get his attention.
John leaned in close to Sherlock’s ear and breathed in his clean skin. He wondered if it would have been best to call up Mycroft so that Sherlock could get proper treatment, but he knew that if he had gotten the elder Holmes involved, the fragile state of their relationship would be rocked yet again. John wasn’t sure he wanted to go through that, and it wasn’t like he couldn’t manage some withdrawal symptoms and treatment; he was a doctor after all. He had gathered enough paracetamol, nausea suppressants, and ice packs to last them a few months, even though he hoped that Sherlock would be much better within a few weeks, it wasn’t like it would go to waste considering how often they get themselves into trouble on cases.
He was no longer in their flat, but in one of the many halls of his mind palace. John stepped out from one of the rooms. Fear struck Sherlock’s chest like a hammer. He had let himself get wrapped up in a fantasy and forgotten why he couldn’t trust the John of his mind palace. Sherlock got to his feet. John was not in his jumper and jacket anymore, but a finely tailored blue suit with a cheery grin.
John shook his head. “No. All right, stop it now.” He started to walk toward the entrance, but Sherlock’s pleas stopped him once again.
“You might want to ease up on the drinking,” Lestrade suggested. “At least while things with Sherlock are a little rocky.” John rolled his eyes, and Greg had to push his smirk away. That eye roll was Sherlock personified.
John rolled his eyes and put it out in his already cold tea. “I’ll get you patches.” He walked into the kitchen and pulled out the breakfast that Mrs. Hudson had brought them. John began to reheat the other plate when Sherlock said he wasn’t hungry.
“And nerves of steel...” He trailed off. John looked back at him innocently before turning. The realization hit Sherlock. Lestrade followed Sherlock’s gaze, but he turned back to the DI before he could question anything.
“I want you to rest today. No cases or crime scenes for you.” Sherlock was about to protest, but one look at John’s face said otherwise. He was right, really, so he nodded once and went back to his biscuits. John kissed his cheek gently and said he would be right back before running to the linen closet to grab a spare duvet for Sherlock to keep around his thin body. John made sure Sherlock was still devouring biscuits before he pulled out his phone and texted Lestrade.
John could only see an image of a strung-out and withering Sherlock curled in on himself by the wall, shivering in a dirty sweatshirt. His hair would have been long and stringy after going unwashed for so long. He would smell of vomit and sweat. John glanced down to see scattered used needles and broken glass bottles.
It was definitely such a strange meeting, John thought to himself. How odd that he would be walking in Russell Square Gardens the same time that his old mate, Mike Stamford, was taking a break there. Mike had always been a cheery fellow, and it was a relief to see that not everything had changed since he’d been gone. John had to repeatedly tighten his hand around his cup of coffee to keep it from shaking. Mike hadn’t changed, but he could see how he had changed in Mike’s eyes.
“This in’t the pawn, friend. If you’re lookin’ for the cheap shit, it in’t here. I suggest you leave.” John frowned. The accent in which the man spoke with sounded forced, almost what most people associate England with- just slightly comical.
John caressed that gorgeous face and lined his cock up with Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock mouthed “please,” and it was everything he needed to hear before pushing in. Sherlock’s hands gripped the edge of the workbench so roughly his knuckles popped. A red flush painted his sharp cheeks and his chest. John bottomed out and let the both of them get adjusted. John pulled out slowly, leaving just his head, and reentered faster. He let Sherlock’s gasps and murmured pleas set the quickening pace. Sherlock was a mess of half-spoken words and breaths as John drove into him without mercy, hands gripping his hips to the point of bruising, but if he was hurting him, Sherlock made no move to mention it. John cocked his hip just so and brushed Sherlock’s prostate with every thrust. The detective was reduced to mindless babbling.
“No,” John bellowed, pulling away from Sherlock’s body and orgasming hard into his fist with a growl. His jaw was clenched so tight, he thought surely his teeth would break. When the aftershocks eased, John reached for his undershirt and wiped his hand. Sherlock stepped out of the binds of his pants and straightened up to see John side-eyeing him.
Sherlock’s tongue encircled his glans, teasing at the slick slit. John whitekuckled the armrests; his chest rose and fell quickly, quivering with every swipe of tongue. Sherlock took him whole without warning. John had to fight the urge to buck up into his mouth when the head bumped the back of Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock hollowed out his cheeks as he drew back. John glanced down to see Sherlock gazing up at him with dark hooded eyes. Sherlock loosened his grip on John’s thighs and guided John’s right hand to the back of his head, never releasing John’s eyes. John furrowed his brow questioningly, but when Sherlock dove back down harder, gagging rough, John got the message and tightened his fingers in Sherlock’s curls, gently rocking into his mouth. Sherlock moaned, saliva dribbling down his chin and onto the carpet below. His knees ached and burned, but it only added to the airy, dizzy feeling he had as John cut off his breathing in short intervals. John’s pace quickened, and his grip in his hair tightened and pulled as John pumped into his throat. The heat in John’s belly was rising. He wasn’t going to last much longer. Not with Sherlock looking so debauched. Tears clung to the corner of Sherlock’s eyes as he coughed on spit and lack of air. John was climbing fast. He didn’t think he could last much longer.
and without pause, took in John’s stiff cock. John gasped loudly at the sudden temperature change and dove his fingers into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock sucked on him with one finger teasing the tight pucker of John’s arsehole while his other hand wrapped around the base of John’s hardness and followed the rhythm of his mouth. John didn’t want to reach orgasm so soon, but Sherlock’s tongue was absolute sin around his cock.
He could feel his own head fluctuate between numbness and a ghostly grating. John didn’t know which was worse- not feeling anything at all or feeling every signal scratch against the inside of his skull. It was almost like razors rattled in his head, not hard enough to cause much damage but enough to nick and itch. John sighed and went upstairs to put on a pair of decently cleans jeans and his trainers without socks on. He grabbed his jacket on his way out.
Sherlock had plenty. When didn’t he? But seeing John’s jaw working tightly, he kept quiet and shook his head. John reached down and gripped Sherlock’s cock. He leaned forward into Sherlock’s ear.
“Mycroft may have helped me on that part.” Sherlock reeled in disgust. “But,” John continued, “he didn’t say anything other than congratulations.”
“And I’ve yet to hear one.” John opened his mouth to speak again, when Sherlock spoke over him. “I have reached my limit when arguing about my leave. I cannot possibly explain why I left those years ago anymore.”
“The door is still open,” he sniggered. “Imagine if Mrs. Hudson had walked in!” John joined in, feeling light-hearted and drained. When they stopped laughing, John tucked himself back into his pants and helped Sherlock stand on wobbly legs. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock.
“It’s not just me anymore.” Sherlock kissed John back eagerly. They kissed for several moments before Sherlock pulled away. “Even though, I hope you are fully aware that time does not stop,”
Sherlock left the couch and grabbed his coat and threw it on, tying his scarf on hurriedly. He left a very confused John in the flat. Sherlock was almost down the stairs when he stopped, considered something, and went back up.
“It must’ve taken him a lot of effort not to make snide comments. Maybe he is learning self-control after all.”
Swears mixed with his name as Sherlock panted and groaned, arms shaking under him. One last pull had the man below him forcing out a moan that sounded both pained and utterly blissed. Warm wetness spilled into the doctor’s palm as Sherlock shook under his body.  Sherlock dropped his body to the floor with a hard
John took a seat in one of the stiff chairs in the corner. Mrs. Hudson rested her hand on Sherlock’s pale wrist. He tried his best to keep his eyes on Sherlock’s long dark lashes, but Mrs. Hudson’s cold gaze made it so much harder. John laid his head against Sherlock’s forearm and closed his eyes against the beeping of the monitor.
John took it upon himself to make Sherlock the biggest fry-up he could manage and a nice steaming cup of overly sweet and creamy coffee. He had gone downstairs to ask Mrs. Hudson if she had any fresh sweets to Sherlock’s liking.
Mrs. Hudson did not attempt to hide her glare when he entered the room and stood opposite from her on the other side of a sleeping Sherlock. John pushed back Sherlock’s loose curls from his forehead and caressed his temple. The doctor came in quietly.
John unfolded the piece of paper Lestrade had given him with the address. He quickly dressed in a new undershirt. As he dressed, his hand did not waver. John smirked to himself and went to retrieve his Sig from the side table next to his bed.
“I don’t think I will be needing to hold onto this any longer. What do you say, John?” She set the gun beside the tray.
Sherlock finally turned to face John with a blank face. “But you did.” John looked away. How could he look at him knowing that he disappointed him- that he hurt him?
“Since you broke my tea set,” she remarked. Sherlock took the mug in both hands and kissed her gently on the cheek.
When John finally removed all three of his fingers, the emptiness he felt almost overwhelmed him, and the sadness he long fought to keep away threatened to overtake him again; but John, perfect as he was, peppered Sherlock’s sweaty back with kisses, tracing his sides with loving hands.
John made no effort to help her with the tray as she placed it down on the coffee table. She withdrew Sherlock’s revolver from the waist of her skirt.
To see it being snuffed out by his own hands made Sherlock’s throat dry. Whatever it was that was afflicting his friend, he had to do something about it, because it was destroying him. He noticed the slight splotchy red skin on John’s head where his hair had been ripped out when he had turned to watch the birds fly away when a biker rode past. Anger bubbled in Sherlock’s chest. How could someone so perfect do that to himself?
When John had stepped in front of Sherlock at the pool, Sherlock’s heart sank. How had he not deduced that it was John behind everything? He must’ve missed something. He had been letting his attachment to the army doctor get in the way. John’s heart beat in his throat. He hoped that Sherlock would find a way out of this, out of the Semtex vest. It felt as if his heart would set it off it beat so hard.
Sherlock pressed his forehead to John’s. The height difference was shorter this time with him sitting on the armchair.
Lestrade let out an exasperated sigh. “You know, you’re just as bad as him. I’ll trust that you won’t do something illegal?”
“Not now.” He huffed through gritted teeth. Greg frowned at him before finally noticing John’s shuffling form as he tried to escape the awkwardness of this situation.
“Sic’em, boy,” John growled. Nails skidding over the floor, Redbeard shot toward him. Sherlock raced to the key. The dog leapt over it and clamped his teeth around Sherlock’s outstretched arm. A cry slipped out of Sherlock’s lips. He twisted around to grip the key with the other arm as Redbeard dragged him toward John. Tears stung on their way down Sherlock’s face. He dug his nails into the floor, but it was no use as they were ripped out of their beds. He grasped helplessly for the walls, leaving a bloody trail behind.
John soothed Sherlock’s hair with his fingers and let Sherlock press his cheek into his shoulder. Tears left a wet spot in John’s button-down. Sherlock turned to look at him, eyes alight. John swiped his thumb over Sherlock’s cheeks.
“Send Mr. Holmes my thanks for the job,” he waved off, walking across the street. John stared after him for a few more seconds before frowning to himself and continuing.
John quickly ran out, struggling to get his jacket on, and hailed a cab. When the familiar black door came into view, he jumped out, shoving bills into the cabbie’s hand before flying up the seventeen steps.
John was about to lower his pants, when Sherlock whispered, “Wait,” and dropped to his knees at John’s feet.
“Oh, Sherlock,” she crowed, throwing her arms around the slender man. His head swirled in fog and sickness when she moved away. John noticed Sherlock swaying unsteadily and wrapped his arms around his ribs firmly.
Sherlock sat up. “But couples in sexual relationships do not usually require separation from their significant other, so I am concerned,”
But right now, there was something more important than his need to shoot that person between the eyes.
“What is happening, Sherlock? Are you okay? John?” She attempted to step around Sherlock. He placed a gentle hand on her shoulder.
Sherlock flinched away. John kept his hands near Sherlock’s face and placed them slowly on his reddened cheeks.
Victor had made sure that the damage to his skin would not go unnoticed. The marks to his body weren't that obvious, especially hidden by his coat and shirt sleeves, but there would definitely be some prying eyes looking at his face. John had held gel packs to his face to reduce the swelling, but the rest would have to go away with the healing process. He stared down at the deep purple-black tracks on his forearms. Those were the worst, Sherlock thought. John had always seen Sherlock battered and bruised, but these were a different set of bruises- not the ones to bear with pride after a long chase.
“I’m sure she means well,” John smiled. Sherlock threw a look at him and stood. John quickly grabbed his elbow before he could fall over. He yanked it back with a huff.
John yawned hard, trying not to let the woman in front of him see. She kept spouting off different symptoms, none of them really indicating an exact disease and just mostly sounding like someone who just jumped off of a medical website. John nodded and opened her file. Everything seemed normal except for the beautifully handwritten note taped to the inside of the manila folder.
At this point, John wasn’t ashamed by the fact that this total stranger could see the tenting in his pajama bottoms. Sherlock splayed a large hand to his stomach and slid it underneath his pants, the other hand making quick work of his belt. John cupped himself through his pants, reveling in the pressure. Sherlock tugged himself out his black trousers, long even strokes on his own cock. John imagined those delicate fingers leaving soft touches on his hard-on. The doctor gripped himself tight. A deep moan escaped his lips. It would have been a sight to see had anyone looked up from the sidewalk: two men tugging on themselves in front of one another from different sides of the street. John started to stroke with increased fervor, using his own pre-come as lube. Sherlock threw his head back a little and let his curls fall away from his sweat dampened skin. John came first, spilling himself into his own fist, and breathed heavily as he watched Sherlock follow suit. His brain was too foggy to question what the hell he had just done. Sherlock held John’s gaze once more, lifted his hand, and sucked on his fingers down to the knuckle.
“A couple days ago, but I’m his landlady, not his housekeeper. I don’t keep my thumb on the boy.” John turned away from the landlady and held his gun firmly as he approached the door. He sucked in a quick breath and pushed through, aiming it at the open room.
Sherlock couldn’t bear the cruelty of that John as well. His only hope to rectify the John of his mind was to take the time to find that moment and properly delete it. To place it downstairs with Moriarty would mean that it would still be in his head- the deep recesses of his mind, but there nonetheless with the Napoleon of crime.
The intensity of Sherlock’s gaze made John’s cock twitch. Those eyes were undeniably beautiful. John wanted to wake up to those gorgeous eyes every day for the rest of his life. John smiled to himself at the thought.
John sprinted out his flat and across the street. He knocked on the door labeled 221B hurriedly. The knocker crooked to the right. The woman he saw before opened the door.
“And nerves of steel...” Sherlock trailed off. Suddenly, he could picture John standing with his gun raised, not an ounce of trepidation as he steadied himself and fired. John stared back innocently.
John stood suddenly and was startled by Sherlock’s presence. He hadn’t realized he had been standing there.
Sherlock lowered his head a little and with a sigh, went to the fireplace, reached into it and produced a dark wooden box. He handed it to John while facing the windows.
Instead of flicking through questions and “cases” on his blog like he had originally planned, Sherlock held the computer on his lap and stared at the infomercial on the tele. The feeling of John’s laptop slipping from his fingers woke him from his unsuspecting drift. He placed it on the floor and threw himself onto his side on the couch. With his eyes closed, his mind palace materialized, and John sat in his chair with a knowing smile.
“What a happy coincidence,” Lestrade sighed, blue and red lights illuminating his face. “You save the day even without Sherlock.”
John let his eyes close. “What if I tell you that it doesn’t matter how you say it as long as you do say it?”
“With you,” Sherlock said confidently. “Never.” When John didn’t say anything, Sherlock flattened his lips and bobbed his side to side. “Maybe I’ll bring some cold case files along.”
“Doctor John H. Watson,” he recited. The nurse smiled at him sweetly and typed away on her computer.
John wrapped his fingers around Sherlock’s and gave a gentle squeeze. “I’m not. I’m hurt that you would do this to yourself, but I’m more worried about you and what this man has done to you. My feelings are not important right now.” As John spoke, Sherlock looked away toward the wall and tried his best to contain the heart-wrenching sobs that threatened to rip through his throat. John placed his other hand over their joined fingers, and it broke him.
Before the strain between Sherlock and John distances them too far, they've been forced to work out their feelings with one another. There isn't enough whiskey or cocaine to hide behind now.
Before she could even get to who it was, Sherlock barged past her and stood by the patient chair. John looked between them and thanked Sarah before Sherlock could say anything rude. Sherlock stood there with those goddamn cheekbones accentuated by that bloody coat collar.
“Well, you’d know,” Sherlock smirked. John gazed up at him, still trying unsuccessfully to not look guilty.
“I know who you are. You’re the army doctor that lives across from Sherlock. Your little public displays of affection hardly go unnoticed.”
Sherlock sighed heavily. “Fine, but I’m going to complain about it back at the flat.” John kissed the corner of Sherlock’s frown.
is what Sherlock had told him when they first met, but this was no war he had ever fought. This was mental torture. There was nothing he could do in the real world that would stop what was going on in his head.
John padded down the stairs to retrieve his water and the bottle of paracetamol for his possible hangover. He had certainly sobered up, but was still feeling unsteady and sluggish as he stepped into the sitting room. John passed the kitchen and bent to get his water when he noticed that their door was closed. It was rarely closed. The front door downstairs was always locked by Mrs. Hudson before bed and by Sherlock if he made it in too late, and they both had guns and plenty of combat skill to ward off intruders, so they really had no reason to close the door…
“You look better today,” John smiled when he sat in his chair, propped up by the Union Jack pillow. He just wanted to get off the topic of his leg. Sherlock had his elbows on his knees and his hands in those beautiful curls. He peeked at John through his pale fingers.
John woke with a start, heart pounding out his chest and sweat rolling down the back of his neck into his pillow. He gripped his shoulder as the crack of the rifle echoed in his ears. He remained still, breathing deeply as to calm himself. The last thing he needed was to have a panic attack right before he went to his first day of work. Just a few more breaths and he stood to take a quick shower. The water soothed him as it trailed over his short hair and muscled back. He dressed in a white button down, jeans and gun in the waist, and his brown shoes, which he despised because they were uncomfortable after a few hours but he wore them nonetheless. He grabbed his cane and jacket and left down the street.
Sherlock’s smile was wicked as he locked eyes with those of Scotland Yard and licked a wet stripe along John’s jaw with a final nip of his earlobe.
The nurse rolled her eyes. “Dr. Watson, even if that may be the case, Mr. Holmes is currently being treated and hasn’t been given a private room yet, so until then, you can wait patiently right over there.” John grit his teeth, but stalked over to a chair and settled.
“If anyone is being irksome, it’s you.” Sherlock pressed his lips together and wheeled around on his heels, coat flaring out like a deathly cloak behind him, and stomped toward the main road.
“Oh, dear, you’re in such bad shape, Sherlock. How about I make you a cuppa? Maybe it will settle you.”
John didn’t say anything to that, just turned back around and walked. He had hoped that Sherlock would say yes, just so he could imagine meeting up with him in the afterlife, doing and saying all the things he wanted to now, but can’t find the courage or energy to do. Sherlock stacked his case files and placed them under his arm.
“Don’t you recall, Sherlock? All those delicious times we spent together playing pirates, solving mysterious cases of dead chipmunks, and hoping that your mummy wouldn’t catch us holding hands in the garden. Please tell me you remember, because if you don’t, you must not be the “Great Detective” everyone has made you out to be.”
Upstairs, John had the windows to the sitting room open, a humid breeze flowing in and warming Sherlock. John had lent him an older jumper that he didn’t mind getting salve on to save Sherlock’s posh silk clothing, but he was still cold. The bath he took was painful. His body ached as he sunk into the warm water, feeling every lash on his body sting. John was hesitant to leave Sherlock alone in the bath, but Sherlock assured him that he could manage by himself. It would give him time to thoroughly wash himself of the dried semen between his thighs and cleft of his arse.
“John,” Sherlock whispered. John met Sherlock’s concerned gaze. “I am not particularly well versed in asking about the welfare of my friends, but I have noticed that you do not seem well. My blogger has to be at his best.”
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock growled with a dramatic twist of the wrist. “I don’t require the entirety of the Yard to watch me, George.”
John pulled him closer, faintly aware of the eyes on them from the center of the crime scene. “I know that you need to take a breather. Lestrade doesn’t seem to be in the mood to let you steamroll over him.”
After being released from hospital, Sherlock should be resting, but an unwanted visitor makes doing so difficult.
Then Sherlock had pulled out a pistol, and John fell horrendously in love with the madman. That brilliant arse was not going down without a fight.
“I know you’re an Army doctor, and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.” John looks down at his leg and cane, readjusting his feet.
“I’m going to overlook that considering how bloody gorgeous you look lounging over there like some Greek statue.”
“You do know what that kind of responsibility entails, Doctor Watson, correct?” John nodded. Mycroft huffed loudly. “Fine then, but do keep in mind that I have constant vigilance when it comes to the life of Sherlock Holmes.”
The two were left alone, accompanied by the even beeps of Sherlock’s heart monitor. The detective picked up his cup of ice and swallowed some chips to ease the constant scratch in the back of his throat.
When Sarah knocked on the door to ready him for the next patient, he slid his phone in his pocket and put on his polite smile.
“Right. Okay. I will dispose of it then.” John grabbed Sherlock’s clammy hand. “Is that it, Sherlock?”
Sherlock and John try to enter a new stage of their relationship, but Sherlock has managed to make everything more difficult.
Sherlock stood to leave when Lestrade leaned over his desk to grab his wrist. “Listen, Sherlock. I know you’re mad at John, and I don’t blame you. I think you should definitely make him work to get back into your good graces, but I think you’ve got to help him understand. I know we always tell you that, but with John, I think it’s best. You two are good for each other when you communicate well.”
John traced Sherlock’s jawline. The detective sighed into his firm hand. His body felt like it was hovering over clouds, just barely being touched by wispy tendrils. Sherlock memorized every indent and callous on John’s hand: the very spot where the handle of his gun presses; the steadiness of his trigger finger; the rough patches of scarred flesh.
John had difficulty falling asleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he jerked awake at the sight of the hot Afghanistan sun. He gritted his teeth and hoped that exhaustion would take over.
WARNING: I added the Non-con/rape warning specifically for this chapter. I did not want to upset anyone, so I thought better be safe than sorry. There is drug-induced sex implied in this chapter, and Sherlock's decision to get in bed with a person may not have been done fully sober.
“Get up and go to the loo. Enter the first empty stall and sit on the toilet with your clothes on.” Sherlock cringed at the idea of ruining his fine tailored clothes on the bodily fluids of the common drunk.
Every step had a metallic echo as he made his way down the steps, needle and vial held in his palm. He climbed the desk again and knocked his papers to the floor with a muttered curse. Sherlock slowly put his bare feet to the floor again. The rug felt itchy under his toes. He wrapped loose newspaper pages around the used needle like a neat little package, stuck his arm in the kitchen bin to clear some of the garbage and wasted mold cultures, and threw it in. He covered the needle with the rest of the rubbish.
Back on the main road, Sherlock stood with his hands behind his back, and when John approached, he smiled sunnily at him.
Moriarty had the board set and the pieces where he wanted them. John was beyond irritated that Sherlock played along. The obsession with Moriarty was unbelievable- all because he was
Sherlock waited what felt like hours before the sound of a familiar set of booted footsteps entered. He only wore his boots when they were playing out in public. It was a reminder to Sherlock of his current place when he felt particularly verbally abusive.
Sherlock jumped down and closed both doors to the flat. He was just about to enter his room when he stopped. The vial was growing warm his hand. He wanted to be rid of that violent memory of John, but maybe he shouldn’t. That rage was part of John, and he wanted to remember every piece of him. The smell of his own blood overtook his nostrils. Nausea washed over him. Sherlock pressed his forehead to the cool wall. No, he didn’t want to remember John like that, he decided, and swallowed the bile rising in his throat. His grip on the vial and syringe tightened as he turned for the stairs to John’s room.
Sherlock turned to John, realizing he was sitting hunched in on himself like a scared child. He pushed back the thoughts and rose to his feet. John stared at Sherlock’s lithe figure, almost predatory in the warm glow of the lamps. Sherlock stood with his hips forward and stomach slightly concave with a razor-edge gaze. The sudden shift from soft to…

“No John. You don’t give yourself enough credit. You think I would bed a man that was imperfect? Just because your intellect does not even come close to mine,” John rolled his eyes, but Sherlock continued. “Does not mean that you are as perfect as they come. I could have anyone, John, but there is only you.” Sherlock pressed his forehead to John’s and whispered again.
“Sherlock, I’ve seen you arse naked. I need to see what else has been done to you.” Sherlock looked away toward John’s dresser. He wanted to rummage through it again and find that wonderfully scented jumper. John probably wouldn’t let him.
Surely he’s alive, John thought again. He closed the panes, hands hovering over the drapes, considering whether or not he should go over there and make sure the lad wasn’t comatose. Right when his decision was made to march over there, the dark haired oddball jerked up into a sitting position and an older woman came in, tray in hand with biscuits and tea. They spoke briefly before he stood and took both the cup and the plate with a roll of his eyes. John thought that maybe he lived with his mother, but the way he frowned around her dictated otherwise. The man put down the biscuits by his laptop and was moving to press the cup against his lips when he glanced up toward John, bright eyes piercing right through the air and the glass. Startled, John let go of the drapes and let them shield him from that sharp glare.
Sherlock released John’s hand and gazed sharply at him. “I do not want to be completely,” Sherlock glanced away.
“Can you explain to me what had happened when you last sat over there?” John followed Sherlock’s gaze. “Where were you going so abruptly? What were you thinking?”
“Sherlock,” John sighed. “I am so sorry. I am such an idiot.” He pressed his palm to Sherlock’s warm skin. “You shouldn’t have gone through this alone,” he said over his flesh.
With his coat on, John wrote a quick note for Sherlock and left it on the coffee table where he hoped he would find it. It wasn’t that late that it would raise suspicion, but John definitely needed a good excuse to disappear for a couple hours, and Sherlock knew how much time his trips to Tesco took. John made sure his mobile and handgun were tucked away before leaving the flat.
“I just revealed that I’m clear of diseases, sexually transmitted or otherwise, and rather than taking me home and fucking me raw, we’re standing in bloody
John had trouble hiding the smile that pulled at his cheeks, but he glanced down at his feet to recover his thoughts for his heart was swelling so much it hurt his chest, and by God, it was distracting.
he thought to himself. Frustration rising to the surface once again, he ran his hands through his mussed hair and pulled roughly. His nerves screamed. He let go and stared at the clumps of hair in his palms.
He hadn’t felt the shift in the air or the light breath against his hair, but Sherlock was there, taking his left hand in his and carefully taking the letter opener from his now pliant hand. He gently urged John to sit on the couch while he got their med kit from the bathroom. When he returned, John was staring at his open palm with glazed eyes. John was still waiting for the sting, but it never came. The bloody lines cut through the natural paths on his palm. All he saw was the blood from Mrs. Hudson’s face where the American agent had struck her. He sat in silence while Sherlock cleaned and bandaged his hand. Sherlock glanced at him, but John’s eyes were still faraway. When he finished, they sat there quietly. It was only when John’s breathing grew heavy and slow that Sherlock draped an afghan over his sleeping body.
“But I am,” Victor purred, reaching for Sherlock’s hand across the table. The clammy coolness of his palm made him flinch before it enveloped the top of his hand.
John spent most of his wedding watching Sherlock from his peripheral as he gazed into his new wife’s eyes. God how he wished it were those beautiful multi-colored eyes he was looking into. The violin piece he had composed for them said all the things he never did. John’s heart squeezed at the end, and all he wanted to do was embrace that brilliant madman.
Lestrade shook his head. “Cleared off before we got ’ere. But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose. One of them could have been following him but…” He shrugged. “Got nothing to go on.”
as he pulled the fingers slowly out of his mouth and then ran his tongue up the inside of each one, his eyelashes lowering to half-mast.
Sherlock jerked forward. “Don’t you bring my work into this, and you know exactly what I think of the press.”
“But I can,” he purred, breath hot and smelling of tea and sugar. He pressed another soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips, cupping his face with both hands. Sherlock felt wrapped in cozy blanket. They separated once more and pressed their foreheads together.
“Doctor John Watson, and that’s quite alright.” Before anything else could be said, John quickly took off toward the grocery.
Sorry for the time in between this update. With Hurricane Harvey and a death in the family following right after, I've been busy and not really in the mindset to write. But, I'm back now! I hope you like the new update!
John made another half-strangled sound and took his fingers back. He bent forward and kissed Sherlock softly before turning back to gently stroke Sherlock’s arse cheeks with his slicked hand.
John’s daydream cracked at the sound of Sherlock’s voice. Remembering where he was, he sprinted out from the back alley and slammed into the panting suspect. It only took a couple of movements to subdue the woman despite the gun she attempted to withdraw from her blazer. John pushed it out of the way and sat up to watch Sherlock jogging over with Lestrade in tow.
Sherlock’s head was far away. His body felt loose and light, but he gathered enough intelligence to look at John adoringly and smile.
And with that, Sherlock dove down again and took John’s mouth into his. He pressed his erection into John’s, and a deep moan vibrated out of John and in between Sherlock’s lips. The feel of it struck him right in his center. Sherlock pried himself away and trailed his swollen lips down John’s neck and nipped at his collarbone. John’s hips jerked up into Sherlock’s. His body searched for the sweet spot against the detective. Sherlock held John down with delicate hands before sliding down further. He inhaled the scent of sweat and soap. He laid kisses against the soft skin stretching over his hips. John’s breathing was ragged in anticipation.
“I like you, John, so I’m going to give you a chance to right this wrong,” Victor said behind his gun. “Return back to your home and forget about this alleyway.” Victor neared John, keeping his sights trained on the center of John’s forehead, “but when I want Sherlock, I’ll have him. He’ll always be mine as long as I’ve got my coke and my cock.”
John glanced up into the mirror at the corner and almost laughed at the lack of injury to his person. Victor lost the fight as soon as he withdrew his gun. Hell, he lost the fight as soon as John showed up.
John remembered. He recalled the sickening twist in his stomach, the itch underneath his skin. He sat on the coffee table with his elbows on his knees.
John huffed, “I’m harmless.” Lestrade stared at him, but said nothing more. He trusted that John wouldn’t take whatever it was he was doing to the extreme, but to walk the battlefield with Sherlock Holmes meant that he was just as mental as the detective. He hoped that he wouldn’t have to answer a call because of the ex-soldier.
John sat in his room cleaning his gun in only his sleepwear and robe. He thumbed the dark pistol, still learning the different textures on it. Oh, how many times he held it to himself, wondering if he would ever get himself out of the rut his life had fallen into. He never could pull the trigger though. Not because he was scared of dying.
When John finally left the front door, Sherlock went to the window to watch John walk down the sidewalk, fists tight at his sides. Sherlock glanced at the stack of cold cases Lestrade had given him to pass the time during his recovery from a “stomach virus.” He and John had decided not to let Lestrade know of his little slip, lest Mycroft get wind of it. Sherlock stepped onto the desk carefully and removed the bison skull. A spare needle and his usual seven-percent were taped to the inside.
Sherlock reached back in search of John’s solid hand on his hip. He was feeling lightheaded from the pleasure and needed the reassurance that he was still here on earth with the man he loved. John’s fingers interlaced with his. Even though Sherlock struggled to keep his balance on one arm while John thrust his fingers into Sherlock’s arse, Sherlock memorized the ridges of John’s calloused trigger finger against his skin and inside him and the way John chuckled to himself when Sherlock told him that he had a bottle of lube in the pocket of his coat.
Behind him, John held Sherlock’s sides with kisses to the base of his sweaty spine. Sherlock was still wearing those goddamn expensive trousers of his. How Sherlock moved as he did in them was a mystery to John, but God, did his arse look just delicious. John reached around to the front of Sherlock’s hips and undid his trousers. John cupped Sherlock’s erection through his undone trousesr, eliciting a strained sigh from the taller man. John yanked down both Sherlock’s trousers and pants in one swift motion and left them to gather at his ankles. John eased Sherlock’s legs as wide as his trousers would let him and caressed the bruises across his back. Sherlock’s breaths quickened as John’s hand hovered over the worse of his whippings.
Sherlock slid off the stool. “The cabbie I shot? I had that bullet casing melted down into this ring.” It was a black band with a thin steel strip running through it, simple yet lovely, just as John was. John held out his hand for Sherlock’s and slid the ring on.
“Anymore and Lestrade might just keel over.” Sherlock turned in John’s arms and leaned in for a kiss. John happily obliged, gently taking in his lower lip between his teeth. Sherlock pressed his hips into John just above his belt. Their kisses grew more fervent as their hips ground against one another, erections brushing underneath too many layers of clothing. Sherlock slid away from John’s lips toward his neck, mouthing at the hot skin just below his jaw. John had no hope in stopping the sounds he was making, but Sherlock didn’t seem to mind at all. It was rather encouraging. John let his hand drift down Sherlock’s torso to rest firmly on his erection. A moan escaped Sherlock’s mouth that went straight to John’s cock. Sherlock released his iron grip on John’s back and followed John’s belt to the front. He leaned back to meet John’s eyes, hands hovering over his buckle.
John stepped closer to him and pushed down his collar. Sherlock was too weak to fight, to push John’s hands away. His own breathing sounded too loud in his ears. John gently cupped Sherlock’s jaw, fingers softly pressing into the sensitive flesh behind his ears, and lifted his face upward.
John twisted his arm out of her grip and heading the opposite way of the ambulance. Mrs. Hudson climbed in with the paramedic instead.
“You needin’ somethin’, mate?” The hair on the back of John’s neck rose on end. John looked toward the direction of where the voice came from and squinted at the man in the hoodie leaning against the wall, mostly hidden in shadow. John realized that he had come to a drug spot, and normally someone coming here would have every intention of buying drugs…
“Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don’t suppose you’d serve time for this, but let’s avoid the court case.” John cleared his throat and glanced around nervously. A pang of worry struck Sherlock.
“I do forgive you. I forgive your treatment toward me, your marriage to Mary, your ignorance toward my feelings for the majority of our flatshare.” Sherlock sat up properly, drawing his legs back toward him. He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. John admired the ease in which Sherlock moved.
John stared into Sherlock’s cool stare. He loved the way the ice in Sherlock’s eyes warmed in these little moments between them. No one would ever get the pleasure of seeing Sherlock’s unadulterated warm heart. He wished he could get a taste of Sherlock’s mind. John always wondered what it was like inside his head. Is it beautifully organized like Sherlock makes it seem, filing data away like a large hard drive, or what is as chaotic as he was?
“Little brother,” he began just as John and the nurse came back with another cup of ice and towels. “It isn’t spying if you’ve both got the windows open while you hand yourselves.” The nurse paused a moment before turning back to the floor with quickened movements. John’s ears burned.
In front of 221, Sherlock hurriedly threw some notes at the driver. John would have made a smart comment about him finally paying for a cab ride, but he was too busy whipping the door open. They were just about to sprint up the steps to their flat when Mrs. Hudson poked her head out her door.
“My chest,” Sherlock started quietly, leaning against the wall. John turned to him, holding the skull by the horn in his right hand and the vial in his left.
“I love you, Sherlock. I’m going to worship every inch of you in our bed.” John fixed Sherlock’s hair and made sure his coat was buttoned enough to keep his tented trousers from causing a scene out in public. The World’s Greatest Detective had a reputation to uphold after all.
They stood in silence, Sherlock finally breathing normally again. John began unbuttoning his shirt. Sherlock watched him curiously. He lifted his white undershirt over his head and threw it into Sherlock’s chair. His healed bullet wound was pink compared to the rest of his body. Sherlock admired his only major wound. John had always been more careful.
“Cocaine-induced acute myocardial infarction,” he had explained, “most likely caused by very recent cocaine use. We gave him a benzodiazepine to reverse the cocaine’s systemic effects and nitroglycerin to aid in reducing vasoconstrictive properties. We’d like to hold him for the next forty-eight hours for recovery and observation. He will feel much better come morning.” They shook hands. “He’s quite lucky to have been brought in so soon.”
“I have never been good with expressing my feelings or emotions. I think that’s why I made such a good army doctor; my emotions had to be pushed away to save people. I wasn’t ready for civilian life, I know that, and when I met you, you threw me back onto the battlefield. I couldn’t have been more grateful for that.”
Sherlock stood quietly and pressed the front of his body to John’s back. His partial erection pressed into the base of John’s spine.
John watched as Sherlock’s thoughts flitted across his distant eyes. Footsteps bounded up the stairs heavily. The Detective Inspector from outside St. Bart’s burst in and froze. Sherlock whipped his head toward him excitedly.
“Sherlock,” he rasped. “I need to sit down.” Sherlock jerked his head up to see the unsteady look in his eye and quickly rose to guide him to his own chair, quickly yanking away his shirt. John plopped down with his legs splayed. Sherlock stood nervously off to the side with his shoulders hunched inward and hands in front of his erection.
“I’m just not as hungry as I thought I was,” he sighed. They took all of John’s food back home with them. John immediately went upstairs to his bedroom, not bothering with his jacket. Sherlock went back downstairs and knocked on 221A. Mrs. Hudson opened the door.
“Fine, fine. We shot up together. I tied him up, whipped him, and fucked him. Every time I thought he was sobering up, I shot him up again. Is that all you wanted?” Victor was yelling at the top of his lungs now, so John covered his mouth with his hand and bent close to his face.
John woke to gentle fingers carding through his hair. He lifted his head to see Sherlock staring off toward the wall sadly. Mrs. Hudson must have gone to get herself some tea while he slept. John gently squeezed his fingers around Sherlock’s arm.
“Right,” Lestrade dragged out. He could seriously use a smoke right now. “I hope they collected all his teeth. Do you know anything about that?” John turned his bloody hand over in his lap. His knuckles were torn on his left.
Sherlock was snapped out of his mind palace when John snatched the cigarette out of his mouth. He pursed his lips into a hard line and frowned up at the smaller man.
The flat was cleaner than he last remembered and his armchair was gone. He blinked the haziness out of his eyes and stood. Across from him, the wall around the mantelpiece had patches of wallpaper missing. John felt exhausted as he walked over to investigate. He traced the thin holes in the wall. The letter opener, normally piercing several letters to the mantel, was lying at the edge. The memory hit him like a bullet to the head and shame washed over him.
“John,” Sherlock called. “Can you hear me?” Only seconds later, John’s eyes fluttered open, dazed and unseeing. Sherlock soothed his hair until his eyes focused on the man over him.
.” Sherlock fought the urge to glance at John, but judging from Moriarty’s smirk, he made it easy for him.
“I thought you were incredibly handsome when we first met, and I fell in love with you the moment you pulled out that gun at the pool. I have only ever wanted to be with you, but I never knew how to express it right, or hell, how to treat you right. I am so sorry I ever raised my hands toward you out of anger. I’m fully responsible, and I don’t expect you to forgive me or even like me after all I have done to you, but I just want you to know that this is how I feel. I have never once regretted becoming your flatmate.”
He pushed it away and crossed his arms. John spoke again. “You aren’t going to be doing any of that while I am here. You know that, right?”
Sherlock pulled off John’s cock. “What is it,” he rasped, lips swollen red and slick. John urged Sherlock up by his arms and kissed him hard until he was dizzy from oxygen deprivation.
John didn’t need any more urging. He took Sherlock’s mouth and bit at his full lower lip. He pushed Sherlock back against the benchtop, letting his lower back dig against the edge. Sherlock placed a palm behind him to steady himself. Watching John in front of him, eyes wild and dark with arousal as he rained kisses across Sherlock’s face and neck, Sherlock could only think of how lucky he was at that very moment for the way things turned out with his life. He had never guessed, never even imagined being in this situation with someone he actually liked sober. This man, this wild man that smelled of gun oil and Tesco soap…
The bright lights of the store buzzed loudly in John’s ears. Lestrade said he should probably pick up a few things for another long night at the Yard and went his own way. John was thankful for the ride, especially after exhausting himself so much. He flexed his tender forearm as he held the basket at his side. John went straight for the milk that always seems to run out way too soon in their flat. The dried blood on his knuckles glowed under the fluorescent lighting as he reached out.
“Arrogant bastard, you knew we’d be doing this.” Sherlock teasingly swayed his reddened arse in front of John.
“All of my files had been corrupted by Moriarty’s poisonous web. I had to enter my mind palace fully focused on the task at hand, and the only way to sharpen myself was to use again.”
“Remember when we were such happy lads, Sherl? The world was just another adventure for us. What happened to that?” Victor Trevor smiled lazily at Sherlock from the shadows. Half his body leaned into the light Sherlock was in. Sherlock looked down at his own feet. He never could remember when he was happy. His past was always blurry with images of raised fists and mocking laughter.
“Oh dear, is the bedroom locked? I always did hate when you would barge in without knocking.” John reached into his breast pocket and tossed a key into the hall.
In his sleepy haze, John sighed to himself and wondered what the hell he was doing. Wanking to the thought of a violinist’s hands? He did enjoy that lasting effect it had on his body. He felt devoid of pain, nothing but loose limbs.
With blood-stained hands, John can't think of anyone but Sherlock, even Lestrade can see it. Sherlock comes to the realization that he and John will always go into battle hand-in-hand, so why the wait?
There was something magical in their handshake when they had met outside 221B that next day. He had never met a more electric man. Sherlock buzzed with contained energy, and it wasn’t until he had moved in with him that he realized that this contained man was all a ruse: he was a lightning bolt in the flat and on cases.
“You were gonna take that damned pill, weren’t you?” Sherlock turned back to him, heart-shaped lips scowling again.
Sherlock frowned to himself. Of course there was no rush. Spending years thinking about these sort of precious moments with John, pushing the moans of the women he would fuck upstairs out of his head, and even giving a best man speech meant that he was in no rush. Time was all they had apparently. Of course. Sherlock rolled his eyes at the faucet. John must think that he has never been in a physical relationship like this. That might be partially true. Victor never held him like this. Instead, he would leave the bed if Sherlock’s comedown was intolerable and leave him to deal with the dopamine depletion alone. The only thing Sherlock wanted was to make up for lost time, but how could John see this when Sherlock was suffering from cold-sweats and migraines. He probably looked like a bloody addict.
John panted in front of the fireplace, robe in tatters along with the stuffing of his chair, trembling in his boxers and tee. From behind, John looked small. Sherlock would never describe the man that way normally, but with his shoulders slumped and quivering, he looked almost fragile.
Sherlock’s mouth quirked. “They always are.” He turned the gun in his hand; John slid it back into the waistband of his jeans, warm from Sherlock’s grip.
They kissed slowly, hands splayed over their backs and holding one another tightly. After a while, however, Sherlock couldn’t catch his breath and sagged a little under John’s hands. The blond man held him closer and whispered to walk to the couch. Sherlock turned to John’s side so they could walk appropriately. Sherlock sat down roughly. The cocaine was stripped so suddenly from his body the previous night after being heavily ravaged, and left him unsound. He pressed his cheek into the cooler couch fabric. John carded Sherlock’s hair with his fingers.
“Placing sentimentality in inanimate objects now?” John narrowed his gaze at him. Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, I’m aware. This is where Stamford introduced us, and you passed me your phone.”
Sherlock took his hand away and stood, facing John with shoulders pinned back. “So then,” he said firmly. “How do we address this?”
“Did he hurt you?” Sherlock’s eyes sharpened, unsure of the question. John wrapped both his hands around his. “I mean, mind palace John. Did he hurt you while you were in there?”
“For a brilliant man, you sure are a pathetic piece of shit.” Tears began to well up in Sherlock’s eyes. The clouds underneath him turned hot and rose around him, threatening to smother him. He wanted to ask John why he was being so cruel, but his throat hurt so much he couldn’t even swallow.
“John.” Sherlock’s baritone reverberated through his spine. Tears sprung back to his eyes. He squeezed them shut.
They sat in silence while Sherlock mulled over what Mrs. Hudson had said. He went through the files he had on depression and like mental illnesses, but most of his data involved prescription drug names.
“Can I look at you, Sherlock? I want to see how bad it all is.” Sherlock watched John’s mouth move. It moved so beautifully around his words. He could watch John talk forever.
