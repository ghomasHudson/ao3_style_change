Just the thought that Cas thinks at flowers like that has Dean's lips curling up. His nerves are pretty shot to shit, but there is something so calming and mesmerizing about seeing Cas handle a flower this gently. He cares so,
Dean gapes at her, his thoughts scattering in all directions, and she doesn't give him time to make sense of literally
Dean wishes Cas weren't here for this, but he is. There's a small stand-off, the two of them lingering across from each other in the graveyard, looking at each other. Dean thinks about the flower in his closet, thinks about how it will remain long after he's gone, possibly preserved forever. He tells Cas to stand aside, robotic and unmoved.
"Oh shit," Dean blurts out, popping up on his elbow to peer down at Cas from above, his eyes open and clear. "Jesus, Cas, you must have been so—I mean, I saw how pissed you were. Why didn't you just hit me? You should've kicked my ass."
"Oh, hey, that's—" Dean blinks, a rush of delight pouring through him so abruptly that he laughs a little. "You've still got it. I didn't know you kept it."
"I have no desire to touch you, Dean," Castiel lies. It's an outright lie and they both are aware of this, but he's hoping that Dean will be kind enough not to mention it. All the times in the past that he's let Dean exist safely in his lies, surely he can grant him the same just this once in return.
Dean's angry in a heartbeat, true anger, even more than he had before. It comes with the surge of hurt and something that stings like rejection. He drops his hand from Cas' trenchcoat. "Well, I'll do what I have to do to stop you."
sounds like an accusation, so Dean is whirling around and jerking a hand towards Cas as his anger spikes. Finally. "You're a freaking child, you know that? Just because you can do what you want doesn't mean get to do
"I'm sorry," Cas murmurs, heaving a sigh as he drops one handle of the bag. "I know I only just got back, but…"
to calm him down, especially in light of the last conversation they had. Dean's an asshole, but he's not
They're at the end of the world, probably about to die, and they're still fucking playing mind games with each other. It makes Dean's stomach cramp to think about it. All it seems like they know how to do is hurt each other, like the fact that they can is the only way to prove they still care. It's fucked.
It's easy after that. Urgent, but easy. Dean feels the intensity of it like it's flooding his veins. And this wasn't the plan. There wasn't really a plan at all, just that constant clawing on the inside of his chest, like a hook buried deep reeling him in. He didn't stand a fucking chance, in retrospect. Cas was back, and Dean wanted. Plain and simple. That's all there is to it, and if Cas is agreeable, then that's perfect.
Castiel stares at the message, not quite understanding why this is supposed to make him feel any better. He decides to ask.
"I'm fine," Dean interrupts quickly, waving a hand lazily. "Fucking around with cars are dangerous sometimes, man. You know how it is."
Castiel squeezes Dean's jaw, adjusting his grip to slide his fingers into the hollow of Dean's cheeks, pressing in until his mouth is forced open with a very tiny
to be asleep, but coffee will do," Cas grumbles, blinking finally and lifting his head from the pillow. It displaces Dean's finger, and Cas blinks a little harder. "You're touching my face."
Shuddering out a short exhale, Dean checks his phone again. Just under thirty minutes. His heart turns over in his chest, stomach rolling, a weak sensation trembling in the muscles of his legs like he's not going to be able to stand for much longer.
Cas pauses, his voice low and melodic, words from someone else rolling around in his mouth like he's tasting them. He picks it right back up, and Dean listens, sort of helpless to do anything else.
"Well… Good." Dean clears his throat, surprised he's not getting more of a fight on that. Cas is an argumentative bastard. Whatever, it's better this way. He sighs and reaches out to grab Cas' arm, tugging on it. "C'mon, up and at 'em."
have been doing these last...oh, eleven years? Twelve, now? Almost? Yeah, I don't know what to call it, but
"Keith. Yeah, that was his name. Anyway, you two always hung out and smoked cigarettes behind the bleachers until, one day, Keith's dad came beating down our door. He told Dad that you turned his kid gay, like it was
"But, like, when? I mean, since we met? Was it a 'love at first sight' kind of thing?" Dean eventually says, the words escaping him all at once.
"I told him, Sammy. I told him, and that's why the Empty came. All 'cause I told him," Dean mumbles miserably, feeling his itchy eyes start to prickle yet again. "He died for me, for this whole goddamn world, and I didn't want him to. I wasn't gonna let him. But he
Sam teases, flipping the mixtape between his fingers. "You're being very defensive right now, Dean. Wonder why. If you won't tell me, you know I'll have to guess, right?" He tilts his head a little. "Actually, since
"Hey!" Dean and Jack burst out at the same exact time, in the same exact tone of reproach, then they stop and stare at each other. "No Baby slander," Dean mutters, and Jack says, "Exactly," and Claire looks mildly disgusted.
So, yeah, Dean knows. He just—he wishes it was different. He wishes there was some kind of magic available that could do it. All their lives, they've made deals and dabbled in things they shouldn't, doing everything—absolutely
"Glad we're on the same page." Dean clicks the lid of the thermos back into place, fixing Sam with a scowl. "It'd help if you'd
"We could just—" Dean lets that sentence hang there, the implications clear enough. A quick kiss, maybe. That's all. That's not too much to ask for.
"You're gonna run the car thing by him?" Sam asks, leaning on the railing of the porch, his beer cradled loosely in his hands.
A part of Dean wants to go back home. He can't just show the fuck up at Cas' door, especially after last night. Well, he
Castiel looks at him for a long moment, his face softening in increments. "I am more concerned about you at the moment, Dean. Are you ready to go home yet? I'll get your keys."
"Still nothing?" Dean asks, narrowing his eyes just a small bit. "Okay, casanova, we're going to have to work on your wooing skills because this—"
He comes to a screeching halt so suddenly at the mere thought that Cas actually bumps into his back because he's following so closely. Dean whirls around pretty much immediately, and he knows he must look as hot and bothered as anyone can get, his breath too short and everything about him sending
it had on me? I can barely sleep without worrying that something bad has happened to you. You're on my mind twenty-four fucking seven—where you are, what you're doing, if you're okay. I spend half my time staring at my phone, just hoping I'll cross your mind at some point, and maybe,
"Ah, yes," Cas says, joining him in looking at the mixtape, lips curling up. "Well, you told me to keep it, so I did. I thought it would be good to listen to on the road."
Dean—someone who he liked. He forbid you from hanging out with him again and made stupid comments for
Dean shoots him a sharp look. "Because calling got us into this mess in the first place. We're better in person. Face-to-face. This phone tag bullshit hasn't helped either of us. Just caused problems. So, I'm gonna go ask him to his goddamn face, and
Dean exhales shakily and rips his gaze from Castiel's, blinking down at his bedsheets. He's just now realizing how hard his heart is thumping in his chest. His face is very hot. This is somehow worse than the compliments because he doesn't even have the luxury of understanding what the fuck is going on during this. There's just Castiel's intense
and Dean dreads the thought that he may one day change his mind. He has all rights to, and Dean just—
Dean doesn't know why this particular question, above all that they have talked about so far, is what gets to him. He scours his brain for an answer, then finds none. It's such a simple thing. Something you know about someone as an offhand thing, maybe even one of the first straightforward things you learn about someone.
It's selfish of him to want to hear it again, and more. He can't reciprocate, so it's just—it's very fucked up of him, actually. So, he just stands there, aware that he's blushing like a goddamn idiot, flustered more than he ever has been before. Trust Castiel to be so blunt about it, so open and so fucking
Sam generally does have a good head on his shoulders, so Dean can't exactly blame people for automatically wanting to follow him. It's slightly weird because, to Dean, Sam is sometimes still that little kid following Dean around everywhere. Not all the time, but sometimes. But hey, to each their own. No offense to the rest, but Dean's looking forward to other familiar faces.
what this is. He doesn't want it. The panic scrambles for purchase within him, and he wants to beg it to stop. He's almost frantic with it, needing it to slow down, feeling like he's thrashing around, even if he's standing stiff. Every muscle is tight with tension for what's coming, because he knows.
Shawn clears his throat, blinking rapidly, even as he stares at Castiel like he's the next coming of Jesus or something. "No. I mean, uh, some of the horses are, but some aren't. I don't really know why."
There are moments where things are so fraught with tension between them that Dean can barely stand it. He's already painfully aware of the fact that Cas has not touched him in a long fucking time, but he didn't give much thought to the idea that Cas is doing it
Castiel steps forward with an arched eyebrow, testing Dean's limits. It seems Dean has a lot of them, because he rips himself backwards and slams into the bookshelves behind him. Castiel watches, interested despite himself. Dean's eyes have gone wide again, glazed over, throat bobbing. It's not fear, exactly, but it's something. Discomfort, perhaps?
And one secret. Just one. That's required, apparently. Something that they've never told anyone else, no matter how big or small.
It takes him a few moments to realize that his phone is vibrating against the bar, but he eventually does. He blinks when he sees Castiel's name on the screen, then fumbles to answer it.
"Oh, this should be good." Zoey lifts her hand up to signal for more drinks, then focuses on him steadily, waiting. "Well? Go on. I love drama I only have to hear about, instead of being a part of."
A grunt escapes Dean's mouth, and he can feel his shoulders cranking down one stilted movement at a time, his breath going short and his eyes fluttering shut. Without even fucking
Well, he doesn't until he realizes that Pamela is just some projection that Michael has planted in his mind, not missing out on the chance to get a few barbs in, even when keeping Dean comfortable. Michael's a pretty shitty guy, as it turns out.
Sam drops his head, releasing a deep sigh. He reaches up and braces his hairline with his hands, shaking his head back and forth. After a beat, he even groans, very dramatically. Dean scowls.
Speaking of Lee, he comes into the bathroom behind Dean a few minutes later. Dean glances up in the mirror, in the middle of washing his hands, and he raises his eyebrows in question because Lee isn't heading for one of the stalls. No, Lee is just leaning back against the door, his hand wrapped around the handle, a lazy grin on his lips.
in some instances. He's fucking hot, in others. He's cute, too. Adorable. All that and more, which isn't really fair, but so be it.
"Cas…" Jack trails off, shifting, his shoes scuffing against the floor. He opens his mouth, then closes it, then closes his eyes. After a beat, he opens his eyes and proceeds to explain.
Dean feels his heart drop when he notices the tire tracks. It clearly comes from a deep tread, a truck of some kind with mud tires, flattening two wide paths through the grass. He picks up his pace, blood pumping as his heart starts thumping hard and fast.
"No, I know, but it's still… There's some shit you can't talk about to the person you're in love with. Maybe you could talk to Sam, but that's gotta be kinda weird, I think. So, there's me. It's me paying it forward, so to speak, so let me. I don't do shit like this very often, Cas. Thank me right now or I'm hanging up," Claire says.
It doesn't surprise him when he blinks awake in the middle of the night, rubbing his face and smacking his lips. He has one second not to feel that sharp pulse tucked under his ribs, at least until he remembers. But, in that second, Cas is suddenly standing right there. And Dean forgets. Just that easily, he forgets how he's supposed to feel, forgets that he should be tense or worried, forgets not to instantly trust him. It takes a second for him to remember, and having to shove everything that comes so naturally to him just pisses him off.
When they break apart, they don't go very far, foreheads resting together. Dean twists Cas' coat between his fingers, breathing hard. He keeps his eyes closed and basks in this. He's not going to lose him again. He won't let him go, come Hell or high water, and they've already endured Hell. They're off the hamster wheel now, free to stop spinning, and Dean wants to settle into it,
Castiel's next words fall out sardonic and dry, and they're not exactly a lie. "I don't know. I think I'd rather that. Eternal rest in oblivion seems better by the moment."
"It was my purpose, even from the beginning. I do not mind. Everything is okay now," Jack tells him, sounding all for the world as if he truly believes that, as if he has made peace with it.
"You can go back to sleep after you've taken this. Stop arguing with me about it, Cas," Dean tells him, raising his eyebrows as he holds out the pills more insistently, along with a cup of water.
and his mouth must taste like morning and coffee, but Dean wants so badly to lean forward and kiss him anyway.
"Water," he declares sharply. "That's—you needed water. Or, we have flavored water with sugar—it's called kool-aid. Or, we have—"
that he doesn't wanna have shit to do with me, and I can't blame him, really, but I have a question I need answered, so I'm gonna go ask. I don't hear you fucking
"I think it'd be helpful if I used both hands," Cas announces as he pulls back and plants himself between Dean's legs like he owns the spot. He widens his stance a little, using his own legs to push Dean's knees further apart. "One for—"
Dean ducks his head, staring at the beer, the heart in question lurching in his chest. He exhales shakily, his voice escaping heavy and rough. "Yeah, I would. Might as well, right? If they've already got it."
No, Cas, I'm fucking livid. Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? You waited until the last possible fucking moment to tell me that, and then you just—you made me sit there and watch you die! Do you have
Is that what Dean thinks? Does he honestly believe that they've been okay since Castiel returned? Is this just how Dean wants to carry on for the rest of however long they're around one another? Castiel doesn't think he can do that.
Dean says nothing as Castiel wrangles the situation and gets his keys from the bartender, eventually ushering him out the door. He gets settled in Baby and thinks about offering something then.
He says, "I raised Sammy, you know. But he's my responsibility. He's my brother. I had to, 'cause Dad sure as shit wasn't gonna stick around to do it. Jack? I didn't sign up for this. You can't just dump fucking kids on me and then
Castiel stares at his phone, his face slowly falling flat, a surge of annoyance hitting him in the chest. They're doing fine?
Cas does something with his teeth, a scrape over the most sensitive parts of Dean's bottom lip, and Dean feels like his legs might buckle. Weak-kneed. Jesus fucking Christ, he needs help.
Things get really, really still within him. His mind is quiet. His feelings are muted, numb. There's just a low thrum of anger and determination that exists in his every inhale and every exhale. Their options are limited, and something's got to give.
"Yeah, sure, why not?" Dean rasps, face slowly relaxing, eyes fluttering before settling shut for good.
In regards to chapter one, it's just straight (heh, not straight, let's be honest) grief. It starts with the Widower Arc, and goes from there.
Castiel is left to entertain Claire and Kaia, though that doesn't seem like much of a task. They're both apparently very happy to drink their beers and talk, usually bickering with each other in a way that feels oddly familiar. Dean, on the other hand, is left to handle dinner. It's no small task, considering he has to feed six people, accommodate Sam's aversion to anything greasy,
at you," Cas breathes out, his voice rough and rumbling in his chest. "I forgot how startled you could get, Dean. I haven't had this effect on you in a long time."
Finding Cas turns out to be something of an issue. Dean expects him to be with Jack, but only Sam is.
It's like he sees it as the ultimatum it is and wants to know if Dean will push back, even when they've done this, even when it's complicated.
"Get up," he says gruffly, then blinks and clears his throat. He offers both hands. "I apologize. Here."
Dean clenches his fists and drags them off the table, hiding them in his lap. His jaw works. "Well, if Dad was here, I'd probably be raked over the coals again for having a friend who's in love with me."
There are more text messages on his phone from Claire and Sam, but also surprisingly from Eileen. They have no text threads, even though they traded numbers back when Sam nearly died and Eileen held a grown man up against the wall by his throat. He had liked her the moment he met her, but in
Before they go, Shawn smiles at Castiel and says, "If you're ever around again, you should stop by and see me, angel. You're welcome anytime."
I had Death—the leading expert on the subject—tell me I wanted to die, like killing myself wasn't clear enough."
"You're the most beautiful person in this room," Castiel repeats instantly, flicking his gaze over Dean's face like he's appreciating it, like it's something beautiful. "In the world, even."
he is right now. Excited, too, despite himself. He just has to get his shit together, get in there, and get it done. That's all.
"Oh, how polite," Dean teases, satisfaction flaring in his eyes. He's awful. He's lovely. "What are you going to do if I don't? Stand out here all night?"
"M'gonna shower," Dean mumbles, then proceeds to wrap around Cas like a vine, clingy and dazed. He's so out of it that it's insane.
if he's dealing with heartbreak, if he's happy, so on and so on. He spends pretty much every waking moment thinking about Castiel, or smothering in guilt, or both, and he's just….tired of doing that.
In the end, the perfect solution is breakfast for dinner. Pancakes are simple, and he even digs into Sam's stash of fresh fruit to steal some blueberries, to give that option as well. He has chocolate chips hidden away for a rainy day—meaning they're stashed away from Cas, who enjoys them, just waiting for the next time Dean has a horror movie marathon. It's a little bit of a sacrifice to use it, but chocolate chip pancakes are too good of an opportunity to pass up, really.
"Yeah, maybe," Dean allows as he starts for the back door, his face hot. "Plus, there's not really much normalcy. Even our normal is a little weird. Kinda like that better, I think."
he's going to be feeling this one for a while. A quick solution would be to just get drunk again, but he's pretty sure he heard Sam talking about a case yesterday. Something to do with kidnapped kids and mask-wearers. He wonders vaguely if he can talk Eileen into coming, because he thinks he remembers saying she had something to handle in the opposite direction. Cases are always more fun with Eileen tagging along, but one with just him and Sam wouldn't be so bad either.
kitchen down?" Dean snorts and steps back. "I don't think so. Get dressed. Meet you at Baby in five."
By the third week, Dean's pretty settled. He's comfortable. He knows the house in the dark. He has a routine that he falls into, rarely deviating from it, at ease with it. He figures out most of Cas' quirks and does his best to accommodate them, because Cas has always accommodated his, even in the beginning when he was just an angel and didn't actually understand them.
It's quiet for a long time after that, but not the whole time. They talk. The conversation doesn't come anywhere close to Cas and Levina for a while, and instead, they talk a little bit about themselves. Their family. Favorite movies. Books, songs, food. Best friend things, Sorine insists.
He goes to his room and slams the door with a low sound of fury, resisting the urge to punch the wall next to it. He won't. It would do little good. He whirls around and glares down at the traitorous part of his body that seems perfectly happy to fixate on the way Dean felt against him. Now is
Dean sucks in a sharp breath, his fingers tightening around their grip on the little ledge. His stomach swoops stupidly. "I don't get it, Cas. I don't know what's going on with you, man. You can't just…"
He doesn't go very far, his whole body going rigid when Cas' eyes dim to their usual blue. They look at each other. Their noses brush. Dean isn't breathing, and Cas' eyebrows twitch together in confusion, though the rest of his face is blank. A soldier for Heaven, an angelic warrior, and Dean's sharing the same pocket of air with him. It's such a small pocket, too. Tiny. Close.
"We could—we could have sex fully, if you want to," Cas offers through a bitten-off moan, his head rolling to the side on the pillow.
"Would you have told me if you could have? I thought I could, and I still never did. Turned out to be a good thing in the end, but…" Dean shakes his head, swallowing. "No, it didn't. Not really. You're still gone. I'm sorry I told you, Cas, I really am. If I could take it back to save you, I would. That has to count for something, right?"
by the way. Because it's a cosmic being, and you don't just...get out of those. We don't have the kind of power to get him out."
"Oh, uh, I—I—" Tim blinks, looking chagrined in a second. His gaze trails to Sam. "Sorry, I didn't know. Is this your husband?"
thing, which wasn't his best moment but also absolutely was at the same time—it features in many of his best dreams, in any case. So, respecting Cas' choice hasn't exactly gone over well, regrettably enough. To be
"I know." Sam sighs and stares down into his beer like it'll give him answers. "I'll leave it alone. It's not really my business anyway."
And then, all at once, it slows down. It softens and goes sweet, all the intensity seeping out to be replaced by an odd sense of intimacy and emotion. Cas' hand moves back to his cheek, cradling it, thumb stroking under Dean's eye like he's touching something precious. Dean releases a small sound he didn't even know he could make, a whimper, feeling cracked open and laid bare.
"Mm, I see." Cas looks faintly amused, shaking his head as he moves further into the kitchen. "I thought I heard someone up. I honestly didn't expect it to be you and certainly not in such high spirits."
When Dean wakes up, he does so alone. The shower is running, so he gets up and changes back into the clothes from the day before. He's assuming Cas has already gotten his work clothes from the trunk.
would know that I know things, and then she would either use it to drive me crazy or just flat out cut me. She's a wild card, man," Dean tells him with a theatrical shudder, chuckling when Sam rolls his eyes—he doesn't see him do it, but Dean knows that he is.
"Hm." Castiel's lips curl up, and he slides his thumb along the line of Dean's jaw, tapping when he gets at his chin. Dean's eyes open, brighter than before, darker as well. "What did you enjoy with other partners, in terms of—roughness?"
"Okay, okay," Dean rasps the moment Castiel's fingers slacken. He blinks rapidly, his cheeks rounding out as he releases a shaky breath. "Jesus. So, like that. You can—you should do shit like that. It, ya know, kinda works for me, or whatever. But wait, about—hear me out, okay? About Anna…"
Dean nearly trips over himself to get to Cas' side, unable to wait another second. Sam darts forward, too. Whereas he helps Jack to his feet, Dean just hits his goddamn knees and joins Cas on the floor.
But Jack—well, the kid hits him with some wisdom that nearly strangles him. He'll miss the people, the time together. He'll miss Dean.
Dean heaves a sigh. "Nah, I'm not. We were friends, then we were almost more, then we tried to go back to being friends. And now...now we're nothing."
Cas sighs and shakes his head, looking incredibly fond. "I love you, you know. I truly do. Despite what that may imply, it doesn't actually make me blind to your sometimes very ridiculous actions. I still see them. I don't love you any less, but I see them."
There is something to ponder about doing this outside, though. Are they going to fuck against a tree? In a bush? Now,
Dean has just enough time to gasp in a shuddering breath before he's being wrenched unceremoniously off the piece of rebar that's holding him together at the moment, and that hurts like a bitch. His vision whites out. He crumbles forward into Castiel with a grunt, cursing under his breath, his whole body awash with agony. He's pretty sure he's dying.
Dean opens his mouth, then closes it. "Yeah, okay, you got me there. Well, point is, you and Claire have a complicated history, right? Kinda like how Jack and I do, and that's on us. We're the grownups, so that falls on us to either fix or leave alone. I won't lie, I've got it a lot easier than you. Jack's a lot more, uh, emotional than Claire is—or open to showing his emotions, at least. Claire? Not so much." He shakes his head, snorting quietly. "She really is a little too much like me, huh? Dude, you've got your work cut out for you—have for years when it comes to her—but I think you're doing alright."
"I understand that you're trying to insinuate something here through obscure metaphors, but frankly, I have no idea what you're talking about, Dean," Cas tells him, still blinking.
Claire grunts, a displeased sound. "He reached out to me after you—well, after. Thought I'd want to know, I guess. Dean and Sam usually tell Jody, and then she tells me. Never really heard it straight from the horse's mouth, if you know what I mean, so I don't always get the full story. Jack was pretty upset about it, so it makes sense that he pulled you back out. He said…"
"Never better," Dean admits, and it's not even a fucking lie. He pushes to his feet, always struck with the urge to stand when Cas comes into a room.
His brain's ability to function goes from severely depleted to absolutely hopeless when Cas' leg slots between his own. He chokes out a groan, mouth opening wider, and Cas licks into it like he's meant for it, unnecessarily skilled for an angel who has only kissed Dean and a demon before. Probably. Dean is pretty sure, anyway.
He walks across the grass because there's no path, moves up each step slowly, then halts in front of the door. For a long moment, he just stares at it. It's kind of an off-white with a pewter door-knocker and a peep-hole that could use a shine. He holds his breath until he can't anymore, giving himself that little bit of time, and then he knocks.
When he gets back inside, the room is dark and Cas is laying down with his back to the door, on top of the cover. It's cold in the room. Dean turns the heater on, grimacing at its loud clanking sound. Cas doesn't so much as twitch, not even when Dean hesitantly approaches the bed and sits down on it, not even when Dean sprawls out.
stop. Don't do this to me, Cas," Dean chokes out, because he knows. Deep down, he knows what comes next. He has never been more terrified for anything in his life. He was less afraid when being dragged to Hell.
Dean's room has not changed since Castiel last saw it. He goes right for Dean's clothes, unwilling to linger in case Dean comes in here. He steals a t-shirt, as well as jeans, though the jeans look fairly new and mildly stiff, as if they're not worn often. Castiel decides to break them in himself.
So, Dean does. He slides his hand underneath Cas' shirt, barely noticing the tremble in his fingers as he does it, pressing his warm palm into Cas' cold side as he slowly drags his fingers to the small of his back. Their mouths meet again when Dean yanks him closer, their legs tangled, hips shifting against each other. It's not going to be enough, not with where this is heading, but Dean's as close as he can get without taking any clothes off.
Three months, three weeks, and six days—one day out from four months—after Castiel comes back, Dean wakes up in the middle of the night with a jerk, flailing out of a dream that he has been trying to outrun for a long time now. It's all for no reason, however, because he doesn't remember the dream at all. He just wakes up with an odd sense of panic and the sudden urge to make sure Castiel is still here.
it is. Dean won't ever have a last night of his life again, because an eternity of agony awaits him, but this counts. It can count, because Dean wants it to. He wants the excuse.
"You need to go to...Heaven," Castiel says, staring at Jack with a wash of confusion sweeping through him. A mounting sense of dread joins it. "Jack, why would you need to go to Heaven?"
benefit. Like I said, he's really cool about it. He wouldn't say a goddamn word, even if he did know, but I just—I don't want to—"
It's kind of daunting to meet it head on, because Dean has too much to say and none of the words to explain it.
Cas' lips twitch up into a growing smile, and he ducks in to kiss him again, almost like he can't help it. Dean's happy to go along with it, his eyes fluttering shut, palm squeezing the back of Cas' neck. It's a kiss made of leisure, as if they have a long stretch of time before them, no rush and no urgency. When Cas' smile grows too much, the kiss breaks off easy as you please.
Dean holds his breath until the ache in his chest is overtaken by the burn bred from lack of oxygen. Right now, passing out seems like a better alternative than facing this. He stares at Cas' face, into his eyes, and he knows that—once again—Cas means what he says. He just...knows.
invested in the movie. It's stupid. It's about a human falling in love with a bee, and there's nothing interesting about it. Still, he misses most of whatever Castiel is talking about to
"I'm really—" Dean's words cut off the moment he backs into the door, and he's got that look again, the wide eyes. "Ah, that would be the door."
Dean makes an embarrassing, high noise that he'll forgive himself for, considering the circumstances, and then he leans back. He braces himself on his hands first, but Cas keeps pushing into him until his arms buckle, so he has to prop up on his elbows in the end. Cas bends over with him, then straightens up minutely and starts kissing and nipping down his chest, his destination clear.
"Ya know," Dean grits out as he evens out the next portion of the ground, "it's really stupid to come back alone to a man with a gun. You could get killed, you know that? Something even worse, maybe."
Another day. Castiel can do another day. If things don't calm at all, he'll just quietly go. He's almost sure that that's what Dean wants and doesn't know how to ask for. Perhaps he's worried about coming off as an asshole more so than he already is, in a definitive way that would lead him to be guilty. Castiel thinks if that is the case, he shouldn't concern himself with it. He's very aware that it's not his ability to feel romantically and sexually for men that's the problem. It's that he feels that way specifically for
of the implications, not until Lee's fingers latch around the lock on the door handle to turn it. Dean hears the click in his head like an echo, his fingers stilling from where he's drying his hands. Slowly, he arches an eyebrow. "Someone might need to take a piss, you know. Not very respectable bar-owner of you to lock 'em out."
Jack doesn't talk about Cas—or Kelly—to Dean, and Dean has to wonder if Sam warned him not to. He can't imagine how that conversation went.
In truth, Dean doesn't really know where he's going. He's searching, maybe. He doesn't know what he's looking for, and he's not sure why it feels like he's trying to outrun something. There's nothing to run away from. This—what happened—is not something he can escape; the worst parts of reality never are.
That is good. That is better than Castiel could have hoped for. The more time he has to adjust, to gather the shredded tapestry of his embarrassment, the better. Surely, given the opportunity, he can stitch that tapestry back together to hang it up and away once more, unhindered. He has survived worse things than mortification. He just needs time.
Exhaling, Dean opens his eyes and goes back to scrolling through headlines. He clenches his jaw and mutters, "I'm fine."
For one, horrifying second, Dean forgets to breathe altogether. Just for a stretch of one moment, all Dean is doing is pressing his lips to Cas' cold, chapped lips with no goal in mind. These aren't even Cas' lips. They're some poor bastard's that Cas has taken and filled up, just a vessel, and maybe they're both dead right now. Dean's got death on his lips.
Two months after Castiel is back, they're in the Dean Cave, watching the Bee Movie—because Dean made the mistake of letting Castiel pick what to watch this time—when a phone starts ringing in the middle of the courtroom scene. Dean's not invested or anything, not at all, but he cuts an annoyed look at Castiel anyway while he fumbles for his phone.
Dean hangs up on Sam's response, which starts out as, "Well, no surprise th—" because he's terrible. He shoves his phone back into his pocket and heads back to the room, feeling like an idiot. He's almost hesitant to go back in, but he forces himself to do it anyway, trying to convince himself that it's fine. Not a big deal. It was just—it was
"So uncomplicate it!" Dean shouts, flinging both hands out. He feels like he's about to explode. He's fucking shaking. "You don't get to do shit like that, Cas! You didn't even
Dean strokes the soft petals of the flower, noting the ring of brown starting to creep up around the edges of the red-tipped yellow petals, making it begin to shrivel and wilt.
He always makes it up crisp and without a wrinkle in place. He told Castiel once that it was something their dad made them do, withholding breakfast or even the chance to use the bathroom first thing in the morning until it was fixed perfectly enough that it would pass—as Sam said—military inspection. Sam had confessed, lips twisting and oddly sheepish with just a touch of shame, that it's a habit he does instinctively when leaving somewhere for longer than a day, as if perhaps John Winchester will suddenly show up in his absence and be furious that it's not done correctly.
As he showers, he makes the mistake of thinking about what other human experiences he enjoys. It starts innocently enough. He is hungry. Enjoying food, enjoying the sensation of a hot meal to fill him up...it is nice in a way only being a human can make it. As an angel, it never was. As a human the first time, it was a luxury he came to love, when he could sometimes afford it.
Hastily, Dean looks to the side, taking in the oval form of the Empty, black and insidious. A small gasp of air pushes from his lungs like he's short of breath, and he is. Everything feels like it's shattering apart.
It's a tempered kiss, more slow and deep than fast and urgent. It makes Dean sigh into it, his hand crawling up into Cas' hair, thumb cradling the small mound of his skull behind his ear. Cas slips his hands into Dean's jacket and flannel, sliding around to cup his back and tug them closer together. They lean into each other and kiss, and that's all they do, and it stretches on and on until Dean's lightheaded.
Dean huffs out a breath from his nose like a furious bull, then he leans in and kisses Cas because he literally can't stop himself. It's another one of those things that
Cas, however, is not. Dean tells him to get on board or walk away, and it is both a surprise and not when Cas walks away. Dean watches him go and feels precisely nothing.
"We are?" Jack's eyes light up immediately, and Dean winces. "I didn't know that, but I think you're right! Cas' body used to be a vessel, and that was her father, and he cares about her a lot. We sort of
Dean's eyes snap back towards Castiel's face, and he nearly bites through the inside of his bottom lip from where he's been worrying the gum between his teeth. Castiel's face is cracked open, raw, naked with unhindered
Another joke, surely—this time it is far more painful than Jack could ever know, no matter if he is omnipotent or not. How could he think Castiel will ever be happy? He has only experienced that feeling once, just once, and it was in the brief breath of a moment where he could simply bask in loving Dean Winchester openly, without the risk of losing everything. He had the promise of death to save him from that at the time, and now, he does not.
"Um. When—well, I almost told you after Dodge City, right before you left to go find Jack. And then, I had planned to tell you right after Jack came back to life. You know, when I found you outside and you said we were only ever going to be friends," Dean admits, raising his eyebrows.
Castiel rolls his eyes. "The point is, Dean, those are just—words. A stranger can say them and not mean it. Words only have the power we grant them. You tell me you love me in your every sentence, and I know to listen for it now. I hear you love me when you breathe."
missed Cas and was always going to. He remembers his tunnel theory and how he's on the outside of it now, how he's sometimes called back towards the comfort of it when things get rough, how things on the outside are better than he could have imagined.
"He—wait." Sam blinks rapidly, looking like he's been overloaded with information. "Okay, so wait, you two were actually...together at one point?"
"Did he?" Dean blurts out, laughing a little at the ridiculousness of it. "Like, he just sat down and started crying? Please tell me he screamed until the Empty gave in. That would—Cas, I think that would genuinely make my day."
"Don't be a dick." Dean jabs a finger at him. "So what if you're gay and in love with me, or whatever? Fine, okay, awesome! That doesn't mean you can just—just do a whole one-eighty to try and make it go away! It's out there now, Cas, and that's all there is to it."
Dean is so fucking tired. He doesn't even argue. He just watches Sam leave with tears of frustration in his eyes, and he doesn't say goodbye when Chuck gives him Jack's location.
There's the sound of something slick and oily from behind him, making him pull back, his breath freezing in his lungs. He turns, craning his head, unsure what's happening
Anyway, Dean has a great time, needless to say. Cas clearly hasn't done this before, but once he gets the hang of it,
though!" Dean yells, resisting the urge to reach out and ring Cas' goddamn neck. Cas drives him fucking
"You'll resent him," Zoey tells him. "You won't mean to, but you will, because you'll be holding yourself back from things for his benefit. He's going to have to buck up and get the fuck over it, or your friendship won't survive. Trust me, I know."
Dean's eyes flutter shut, and he sags like all of his strings have been cut. He doesn't try to back off anymore, choosing instead to shuffle in closer, his dropped hands raising to cling to the lapels of his coat and drag them closer together. Cas makes a small sound of approval, a hum right against Dean's mouth, and then his fingers are pressing against Dean's jaw, urging him to part his lips.
"Yeah," Dean whispers, closing his eyes so he doesn't have to see the rush of the world outside flying by.
ways he'd like to get reacquainted. He likes not thinking too hard about the things he doesn't want to, and it's only better with someone he's at ease with. Someone he doesn't have to explain himself to. Someone who
more," Cas hisses, his eyebrows drawing down. "That is a very bad idea. It's a terrible idea, and I—we will
the asshole that he doesn't even bother fighting. He can't figure this out. He doesn't get it. "I don't understand why you believe I'm being an asshole," he admits as he moves towards the bed.
"Claire and Kaia are coming over. Jack's going with them for a few days on a case. You gotta get up and see 'em," Dean says, grinning when Cas' groans a little pitifully. "Hey, that's the price of adopting kids, man. Ain't no rest for the wicked, or parents."
Dean releases a quiet breath and lets his head drop forward against Castiel's side, leaning into him and shutting his eyes. He
"Dude, Cas and I have been playing tonsil hockey at least once a year since we fucking met," Dean tells him, raising his eyebrows.
"Jack needs my help with something," Cas says softly, searching his face. "He needs my assistance in reconstructing Heaven."
Jack nods, beaming, and then he leaves the way he came. Dean watches him go, chewing the inside of his lip, wracking his brain for any excuse to come up with that will give him the few extra hours with Cas he so desperately wants. He comes up with nothing, and he glances over at Cas, hesitant.
With that, he reaches up and grabs Cas' wrist, twisting his arm until he hears something crack. His fist connects, and Cas' head wrenches to the side, swinging back up with blood on his lips. Cas reaches out with his other hand to grab Dean's other shoulder, snarling, "Dean," and getting another punch to the face for his troubles.
"Is it gay chicken? I bet it's gay chicken." Claire releases a scoff. "Dean Winchester would play gay chicken. He's so stupid."
Dean's fingers tighten around the wheel, leather creaking ominously under his palms. "I can't see anyone else."
sam really said, "gender? don't know her" and i love that for him. also, i love eileen so much, and her friendship with dean is so important to me. also also, not dean going off to live out his life with his male best friend and being like "hm, whatever could this mean? ah, yes, i am a slut. sounds legit" i hate him, your honor.
"Right, 'cause he's great at shouting what he wants from the rooftops. Dean Winchester? Oh yeah, he's like open mic night when it comes to his feelings."
Dean does not get to do this to him. Not about this. Castiel will tolerate a lot from Dean, but not this. If he's—if this is… Castiel doesn't
That doesn't mean Castiel won't ask for it, anyway. Desperation tastes like the way blood smells, metallic in the back of his throat. "Fine. I do not
Dean announces as he shuts the door behind him, crossing his arms and nodding when Castiel pauses halfway across the room to look at him incredulously. He can't be serious. He
is happening. He feels stretched out and stripped, someone plucking at the threads of him. He feels numb. "When you said you want me, you meant—you meant that you—"
Dean is fidgeting. Strangely enough, Castiel wants him to go away. He wants Dean to never leave, of course, but he wants Dean to walk out the door, count to ten, then come back. Maybe re-enter the room and jog his memory, so he can recall that this isn't how things work. Except, apparently, they do.
Castiel frowns, but he dutifully says, "Castiel," and allows Shawn to shake his hand, not seeming to notice that the contact lingers for a beat too long.
He has to breathe through his nose, and sometimes he forgets because he's so goddamn taken with the feeling of—of… Well, Cas is just fucking his face with fingers, isn't he? That's what this is. And Dean
Dean manages to lift himself up on one elbow, taking the water and drinking it down quickly, more thirsty than he expects. Probably all that drooling. At that thought, he can feel his face getting hot. Suddenly, in the aftermath, he's a lot more humiliated by the things he did and said than he was while doing them. He hardly knows who that person he turned into
Things are silent between them for a while. Dean does his best to ignore her. It's nice that she wants to help, he guesses, but he doesn't particularly want her to be here. This place—it feels private. Claimed already. It's not hers. It's not even Dean's.
"If roles were reversed, you would not feel the same. You would prefer to avoid it, shove it down, and act as if it never happened."
He does not remember falling asleep, and it feels like he has only blinked when he's yanked unceremoniously back to wakefulness. He's immediately annoyed by it, his eyes watery and scratchy in the way that lets him know he hasn't rested nearly enough. Someone's knocking on his door. Banging on it.
This time, when he cuts himself off, he actually tells the bartender, who agrees with a simple nod. He stays there at the bar, trying to sober up a little, cheek in his palm and the image of Zoey's dreads swinging playing in his mind a little wistfully. He turns in his seat to watch her flirt with the woman, and she's doing a really good job of it, too. It's mildly entertaining, and he's weirdly rooting for her. She deserves orgasms, he thinks fuzzily.
"Fuck you," Dean says again. "But uh, you can relax. I'm fine. More than fine, actually. But you—I mean, you're back. I feel like I should reach out and pinch you to make sure you're real, dude."
Finally, Dean exhales and puts one knee beside Cas' waist and swings the other over, hands sliding along his bare shoulders to rest against the sides of his neck. Cas' hands move around his sides, settling against his back, keeping him steady. Dean's getting a little too old to be throwing himself into people's laps, but gingerly finding his way there doesn't seem to be an issue. They're so close like this, warm skin overlapping, faces hovering across from each other.
Dean has lost a lot of different people, all across the many categories. Parents, friends, his brother. He's lost loves, he's lost
"Yeah," Claire agrees, "but it's whatever. Jack plucked us all right back and put us where we were supposed to be, so that was nice of him. I know you're not happy about it, but that's one good thing, at least. Kaia says we gotta look at the brighter side of life, or whatever the fuck."
"No, listen to me. Do you remember when we were staying in that bumfuck town in Georgia? You were fifteen. I was eleven. You had that friend. What was his name? It was—"
Castiel resists the urge to curl his lip when he thinks of Crowley. "Sometimes, I could not tell if my dislike for Crowley existed out of jealousy, or simply because I never liked him, or both." Cas holds up a hand when Dean's mouth drops open. "Before you add your comments, I'm not insinuating anything between you and Crowley—though, I am aware that he likely took advantage of your time as a demon. That being said, Crowley had feelings for you and absolutely no shame in expressing them, complicated as they may have been. I'm not suggesting he was in love with you, but I wouldn't count it out. He wouldn't have turned away the offer to have sex with you, at least."
If the kid is responsible for this, Dean's going to throw him Baby's keys and tell him to have the time of his goddamn life. He's going to let Jack have any-fucking-thing he wants. He
With that, he opens the door and slips away without waiting for a reply, and Dean watches him go in utter silence. He closes his eyes, that earlier surge of joy tempered now, because of this, but Cas is still back. He's still here. That's a big goddamn win, and that's the story that Dean's sticking to. Everything else gets firmly shoved away.
Cas flicks his gaze between Henry and Dean for a second, then recognition brightens his eyes. All at once, there's a tiny smile at the corner of his lips as he looks at Henry. "Thank you, but Dean will handle it. Apparently, he insists on it. Will you and your wife be alright through the storm?"
If Cas has just decided that, fuck it, sex isn't for him, then cool. Will Dean miss it? Undoubtedly. Yes, of course. Is it the reason Dean's out here risking life and limb to come clean about feelings of all things? No. No, it's not. Sex and love are two very different things, and though they often go together for some people, they rarely do for him. He doesn't need one for the other to exist. Dean's still going to be head over heels, regardless if Cas ever touches his dick again. So, if that's all it is, then cool. Awesome, even, because the alternative isn't looking so great.
Castiel stares at him. He...doesn't know where to start with that. He's not sure where it's coming from, or why Dean sounds so—bitter about it. Dean's usually the last person to judge anyone for what they like when it comes to sex, and Castiel had the idea that Dean liked Tabby.
Cas wrenches back with a gasp, stumbling and looking dazed, his hand coming up to press against some of the blood on his temple. Dean feels guilty immediately for doing something as stupid as that when 1) Cas is clearly fucking injured, and b) he
As the last words fade out, Dean has to pull over to the side of the road. He slaps the radio off and leans forward to press his face against Baby's wheel, breathing. It comes out wet, stuffy, crying and always goddamn crying. Dean feels like that's his constant state, even when no tears flow.
him with a beard?" Sam challenges, the attitude coming out with an ease that suggests he's so very thankful that he gets to argue with Dean and fuss at him again.
Dean lets that sit there for a moment, suddenly realizing what that solid weight bearing down on his chest is. There's a sensation like a fist made of ice grabbing hold of his intestines and twisting them. Dread freezes through his veins, making him go cold and prickle all over, as if this moment is going to haunt him forever. He wavers, uncertain, because maybe… Maybe he's just...making assumptions.
For a long time, Dean thinks they're just going to stand opposite of each other and stare at one another, but then there's a distant clanking from inside the house that shatters the tension.
"Feeling good?" Dean asks. His eyebrows fly up his forehead when Cas' head snaps up and around, staring at Dean with wide eyes. "About going to Dodge City, I mean. Excited about it, ya know? That's—that's what I meant, Cas."
Sam cracks up instantly, wheezing a little as he curls his arm over his chest. He's probably got some bruised ribs. Because he's a little shit, he picks up where Dean left off, his imitation somehow even
Dean rides it out, moaning against Cas' throat, tightening his hand around Cas as he jerks his hips faster. He knows when Cas is about to find release, because Cas turns out to be fucking
That's not who he is, and he'll be damned if he starts now. Fine, so Castiel wants to do things you can't repeat in church, what the fuck ever. It's not like Dean hadn't
Slowly, Dean peels open his eyes, not sure when he closed them. Castiel is staring at him, pupils too large to be anything other than blown with his own arousal. He doesn't seem to know where to look, Dean's eyes or his lips, and there's a joke in there somewhere, but Dean's too mentally fucked to even remember what it is.
So hard, in fact, that he curls in on himself a little, fumbling with the beer until it slips from his grasp and sluggishly starts pouring out on the ground. He stares down at it, eyes burning, searching for some kind of answer. It's such a juvenile question, something that doesn't even really matter, something he'd roll his eyes at and scoff about, because they're not kids. And yet. And
"Well, there usually comes a point where two people who are together figure out if they're going to want to make a
This is not punching Cas, though that's what Dean claimed he would do not even five minutes ago, but he's not going to hold it against himself. Dean doesn't think he's been less angry about anything in his goddamn life, like what has always existed in him has all but evaporated on the spot. It's a glaring absence that feels like it will remain, like he'll never have reason to get angry ever again.
"You deserve it, though," Dean says softly, pressing in against Castiel's hand. He backs him up against the counter, closer, closer. "Let me, Cas.
you, going off and doing that? I'm the dumbest choice you've ever made, and you've made some real dumb choices in the past."
Dean's so damn proud of him for that, for being unlike any other angel, for adapting and learning to bend when others might break. It's Dean's fault, and he hates it, but Cas is so goddamn
"He, huh? You know you'll fall in love with some dude? So, you're just, like, fully gay?" Dean blurts out. "Like, you've committed?"
"First of all, that was—I was...delicate, at the time, so shut up," Dean mumbles defensively, hiding behind a swallow of his beer as chest twinges. "And second, I'm not the one who—well, I ain't really arguing with you, Sam. I'm just telling you what I know, what's been made
"I want—I want—" Cas' shoulders hitch around a shuddering breath as he kisses a path down Dean's neck, seeming to get lost in his skin.
"Cas," Dean mumbles, slowly laying down on his side, facing the sleepy lump across from him. He gets no response, so he scoots in a little closer, reaching out to tap his finger to the end of Cas' nose. He pokes it lightly. "Cas. Hey, Cas."
"You seriously asking?" Dean mumbles, his eyebrows jerking up. "I don't—I mean, I know the Anna thing was kinda—"
"Ask him about it. That's not my whole point, anyway." Sam waves a hand and turns toward him, heaving a sigh. "Look, losing you in
Dean exhales heavily and mutters, "Can I just—" as he shuffles closer, and Cas whispers, "I really hoped you would," and then they're kissing, just like that.
ah, here we are again, back at the dumbassery. im well aware that we are steeped in it, in this fic. i apologize in advance. that being said, i will warn for some inebriation again, as well as a pretty intense argument, as well as discussion on dean being unhappy in/with life.
"What, you don't wanna scrapbook with me?" Dean smacks his teeth. "But what about the glitter glue, dude? I was really excited about the glitter glue."
"Okay, bigger words, got it." Dean clears his throat and takes a deep breath, as if he's bracing himself for something. "I love that you love me, how about that?"
because I think—I think he doesn't believe he can have you in any other way. Every time it seems like he can, it's great, right? Should be, because it's what he wants. But then, if he gets to have it, only to lose it later… He's afraid to have more, because it's a lot more to lose."
"Do I—" Cas cuts himself off, and he stares at Dean with a very peculiar expression. Dean raises his eyebrows, and Cas exhales softly and shakes his head. "No, Dean, I don't mind. I—thank you. I appreciate it. Very much."
it can't be pretty. It likely spells out everything he feels, which can be reduced to a few, simple words. Devastated, resigned, and
Dean taps his thigh, taps the wheel, taps the seat. He looks at his phone—thirteen minutes—then very firmly doesn't look at his phone. He holds his breath, only to force himself to breathe. It's okay. He's being ridiculous, but it's fine.
"Sometimes." Dean closes his eyes and breathes out, slow and steady. "Not a lot of people make it this far in my line of work, and I never expected to see the other side of thirty, let alone forty. I used to want that, to go out loud and swinging. But then, life got so—it was how it was, and now we know why. And it was just so
"It's slow," Sorine says. "No medicine in the world can cure it. You either see the other side of it, or you don't. And that's—that's all there is."
Cas gives in quickly enough, sinking back into the kiss and being remarkably pliant. The moment he'd agreed to Dean doing to him what he did to Dean the night before, he has been so relaxed that he's practically flowing like water under Dean's hands. They get as far as Dean working Cas' shirt over his head before the phone rings again.
"No. You can't take it just yet, as I use it to do my job, but you're more than welcome to it once Dean has replaced it for me," Cas tells her.
Dean purses his lips, then clicks his tongue. "I mean, why not? I don't exactly, uh, mind. And, well, you said it would solve a problem."
The kid doesn't stick around because he has things he has to do, apparently. Well, he's God now, right? Trying to be a better one than Chuck was. Dean doesn't know if anyone with that kind of power can be good, but after everything, Jack has definitely earned the benefit of the doubt.
be. "First, you know how much it fucking sucks for me to have to watch you die. I hate that shit. It fucks me up. But, on
particular one actually gets to him. He almost can't breathe around it, so he needs a second to relearn how. He closes his eyes, ignoring the heat in his face, trying to gather his scattered thoughts.
He's dragged out of his thoughts by Zoey suddenly plopping down on the stool beside him with a sigh. A dejected one, by the sounds of it. Dean frowns.
Another curious response comes from Dean, and Castiel finds that he likes it. Dean's breath hitches and escapes him, and then he's groaning, reaching up to cover his face with both hands. Castiel can see the tinge of pink on the other side of his fingers, and he wants to reach out and peel Dean's fingers away. He wants to bask in it, utterly delighted.
Dean makes a weak sound and reaches up with both hands to cover his face, resisting the urge to scream. There's that burst of delight, right along with the sharp pang in his chest, now joined with the instinctive desire to tell Castiel that he doesn't
the kid. Cas nearly trips over the goddamn trashcan Dean left right in the middle of the floor, and Dean winces in sympathy before chugging his coffee, willing his heart rate to go back to regular. Also willing other parts of himself to calm the fuck down.
Sam is the one up and making all the racket. He's tackling breakfast today. Dean resists the urge to go over and take full control, but it's very hard. Sam's a grown up; he should know how to cook, and he
"Yeah, I know, but like...your sister, man," Dean mumbles, grimacing. He still looks mortified, for some reason. "That's—you know what? That's completely fair. Uh, anyone else?"
Castiel does not, but Kaia makes a faintly alarmed sound and hisses, "Claire," so he's going to assume it was inappropriate somehow.
"Hey, Cas," Dean croaks, staring at him and staring at him and staring at him. He can't stop staring at him. "I'm not running at you like a goddamn damsel this time. That was a one time deal."
"Oh, wow, you really say the nicest things," Dean says flatly, running his tongue under his top lip. "I'm sorry that I'm such a tempting distraction for you. Really, I apologize for being so hot that I've made your life so goddamn
Neither happens, but Dean does get an idea. It's mostly selfish, just a needy little desire to tell Cas what he should get to hear before it's too late. If it's not already.
But making snide comments about your kids—not that I would, to be clear—is like my, uh, thing with Charlie, Lisa, and my parents. You can talk about them, but there's certain shit you don't say."
Castiel's eyebrow lifts yet again, but he means for it to this time. "You'll have to be more specific. If you want anything from me, Dean, you need only ask.
"It's a nice thought, but I find that very hard to believe," Cas says a touch dryly, his lips twitching. He looks very pleased at the moment. He flicks his gaze over Dean's face, humming. "If you're willing to listen now, the way I returned is—"
"Yes." Castiel hadn't actually planned on it, admittedly, but now he's quite sure that he will be doing it for the foreseeable future. He wants to know if Dean will let him, if he can get away with it. Does it make Dean uncomfortable? Would it make him more uncomfortable if Castiel walked around with no shirt at all? He reaches down to test it, getting ready to take the shirt off. "Unless, would you like it back, Dean?"
"No, I left Cas with the codex, so I should—" Dean chokes, coming to an abrupt halt in the mouth of the hallway, staring at the dim living room without really seeing it. "Oh, shit."
"You bleeding?" Dean waits for Cas to shake his head and lift his hands, showing that they're fine, and
"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Sucks for you, though, 'cause I'm not giving you the excuse. I'm doing just fine, and I'm living
And now, Cas has something. Dean's not sure what, exactly, but it's something that might not involve death, or harm, or asshole best friends who make you leave. Cas deserves that something. He should be safe. He should be—
Dean's looks triumphant immediately, a spark entering his eyes, something beautiful that makes a part of Castiel want to lose. It's unfair. It's cheating. Dean doesn't seem to care as he shamelessly replies, "Liar. You sure had a lot of shit to say before you fucked off and died."
Dean blinks hard and turns his head away. "I lost so much so quickly, but losing you? That was—I couldn't handle it, man. I didn't know how to. I didn't
his thing, then that just means he's got good eyes and shitty taste in guys. Dean can be perfectly normal about this.
He is not quite sure how what happens next even happens next. He knows it is a terrible idea before he even does it, but his self-control has fled him. His mind provides him with the image of Dean's eyes flashing, that small grin curling at the corner of his lips, and then Castiel is touching himself with a hot, wet hand. It unravels from there.
good right now, but I'm old and lazy, so." He leverages himself up, settling on the table, his legs swinging as he grins. "See? An improvement. Now I don't gotta worry about standing while I fight with your fucking belt. Come here."
Dean grits his teeth, his chest tight, an ache of an unfamiliar origin threatening to surge forward within him. "I get that you're scared, okay? It's scary for everyone, Cas, especially when they're fucked up. It's just a part of being human. When you love someone, you're going to be scared to lose 'em; that's just how it works. I've been terrified for
"Like what you see?" Dean asks, raising his eyebrows pointedly, very aware that Benny's eyes are latched onto his neck.
Dean makes it to his room, bursting in like he's bursting for air. He gasps as he stumbles through the door, then immediately starts finding shit to do. It's automatic. He goes straight for the bed, messing up the sheets just to remake it, his hands shaking as he resituates the pillows. He's grinding his teeth, barely able to see shit with the stupid film of tears in his eyes spilling over and running down his nose.
"Huh." Lee drops his hands from Dean and examines him for a long moment, curious. "Damn, he's got his hooks in you deep, doesn't he? He must be heaven in bed."
Cas works his finger down further, and Dean can't stop himself from fixating on it immediately, his lips parting in response to the feeling of the pad of Cas' finger circling his entrance—he massages it, mostly, adding a little pressure but never pressing in all the way. His finger is cool from the lube for a split second before it starts to warm up.
"A crimson this dark," Missouri murmurs as she opens her eyes, staring at the flower sadly as she gives it back to him, "it represents a deep sorrow, Dean. Did you know that?"
So, Dean begs off for a shower. He actually does need one. He leaves reassuring Sam that he's okay, yet again, and then he goes to his room to fight his way out of Michael's stupid clothes.
"I missed that, too," Cas rasps, his voice wrecked, but not to the point that the teasing amusement threaded through isn't audible.
"I'm gonna, uh, go grab something for us to eat. Why don't you get a shower? I'll bring in something from Baby's trunk, and you can see about getting those clothes washed in the laundry room. Lady at the desk said it's still open, and you—" Dean cuts himself off when he realizes that he's rambling.
"Mm, I'll mention it to her when I call her and let her know that she doesn't need to cause you injury."
It's insane how good at this they are. Dean's slightly in awe, waiting for any part of it to be awkward or hard, and none of it is. It's a little mind-boggling, actually, because Dean's never given a lot of serious thought to what this would be like. That was dangerous. He knew better.
"That's reassuring," Cas tells him bluntly, slipping his finger in slowly, up to the first knuckle. "I read numerous articles and watched a very clinical video on how to do this properly, just in case."
him, his hand rocking and his wrist rolling, keeping his fingers in Dean's mouth through the whole transition until he's done. He settles again, naked.
Anyway, Castiel is soon guiding a horse out of the stables, while Dean is just staring at him with something really fucking weird happening in his chest. But Shawn and Castiel don't linger, and it isn't long before the horses are picking up speed to gallop across the pasture and away.
This is a terrible time to have this revelation, because Cas doesn't wanna have anything to do with him. All he wants is Cas, and Cas wants him to stay the hell away from him, because they suck at being friends. And shit, that's even more Dean's fault than it was originally because Dean's been, quite literally,
From Claire, there's a picture of her and Kaia sitting on a beach, hair wet and sand sticking to their necks. They look very happy. Castiel's lips curl up, and he sends back a smiley face because it seems appropriate. It also confirms that he is, in fact, still alive. He's sure she appreciates that.
"I...demanded it," Jack says slowly, finally. He lifts his gaze, lips twitching down further. "I never wanted to interfere, but so many have failed you, Cas. I couldn't leave you there. I didn't the first time, and I couldn't this time."
It's like Billie said. He's changed. It has happened somewhere between everyone dying in one fell swoop and now. Dean can't quite pinpoint what the exact moment was, the precise time that it settled in just how genuinely exhausted he is, how he thinks it wouldn't hurt to breathe if he didn't have to.
Dean coughs so he won't laugh. "Well, I'm not sure you get to judge, Cas. Remember when you became God? I do."
He leaves with that prickle under his skin, fully in control, distantly aware that he didn't actually miss at all. He just hadn't been able to do it.
"Yeah, you know, your groove. Settling in. You know what I mean." Sam rolls his eyes and waves his hand around carelessly. "Anyway, listen, get this. So, I've been getting into contact with a lot of Hunters because of my codex and stuff, and do you want to know what one of the leading issues a lot of them have that keeps them from taking on cases?"
doesn't settle in right, and it doesn't even matter. Dean doesn't know what this is, what they are, what they're even doing. He just wants it to stop, wants Cas to trust
He's not sure what's wrong. Is it really that Cas is genuinely that terrified? What, like Dean isn't scared, too? Like the only reason he's brave enough to do this at all is because he knows how awful it is on the other side of it? Like this uncharted territory is
Dean scrunches up his face and huffs as he gives Cas a light shove. "Go away. Get outta here. You didn't miss me. You missed being a pain in my ass."
"It's fine." Castiel turns his head and looks at Dean with a tiny frown. "Dean, do you think I could be compared to a furby?"
Castiel sees the movement out of the corner of his eyes, catches the way Dean starts forward, and he's moving away before he's even made the decision. The knot in his chest is tangled, pulsing hot. He wants Dean to stop, to back away, to leave him alone. He wants Dean to get closer.
They don't go very far, as it turns out. Cas just pulls him in a little closer and slowly leans back, turning over to lay Dean out on the bed beneath him. It's not completely graceful, and it involves a lot of limbs knocking awkwardly together before they finally get situated, but when they finally do, Cas leans over him and kisses him so,
"Me instead of Jack. The Empty would take me, but there were...modifications to the deal. The Empty would only take me when I felt a true moment of joy. When I was happy. When I, as it said, forgot and moved on with my life and let the sun shine on my face. That was when it would take me."
Castiel is back, and Dean stops counting for how long. When he wakes from dreams he can't really remember, he doesn't have to go far to reassure himself that Castiel is still here. He just turns over, and there he is, right next to him.
Dean figures it can't hurt just to feel it out. It still bugs him, and Cas seems to sense that, because he spends a little longer thinking about it. They decide to go back to the codex and leave it alone, maybe think about it later. It's unsatisfying, but that's life for you. Dean kinda hates not having a solution, and it gets under skin more than he likes, but he picks up his phone and starts sending Sam a long stream of approval through text.
"Lean back," Cas tells him, kissing a path down his throat from just below his ear. His voice is low, almost with a growl to it, and it makes Dean's whole body tingle just hearing it.
"No, no, I'm not. I can make assumptions all day long, but that's not what I'm doing. I'm saying you don't know until
Cas hums in easy agreement, no judgement. There's the sound of the lube top popping, and Dean closes his eyes, forcing himself to breath out calmly. Relax. He's supposed to relax; he knows that much.
Claire makes a small sound, amused. "That's what I like to hear. Now, go forth and live out your big gay dreams. Wanna hear my theory on how it goes?"
want to have sex," Cas states, slowly pulling his thumb out of Dean's mouth to the very tip before deliberately pushing it back in. Dean does what feels natural, which is swirling his tongue and tasting the salty-skin of Cas' thumb, and he gets two passes before Cas is slowly pulling his thumb back.
Dean shuts up because simply hearing himself makes him want to crawl under the floor and never resurface. Words aren't really working in his favor right now, so he just decides to act instead. He steps forward, pushing off the counter to turn and wrap Castiel in a hug, which isn't very like him, but he can't exactly stop himself either.
"Stay in touch?" Dean checks, moving further into the room, clearing his throat and stuffing his hands in his back pockets.
"Cas, come on, he turned out mostly alright in the end," Dean says lightly, then immediately clears his throat and starts shaking his head when Cas cuts him a severe look. "I mean, he was a pain in my ass, so good riddance, really."
For a long moment, Dean ponders what the hell Cas would have wanted to do if he got the freedom he deserved. Maybe still be a hunter, maybe stick around in the Bunker, but what else? Dean's picturing little plants and haphazard stacks of books. Boardgames with Jack. Texting Claire, using too many emojis. Netflix; so much Netflix. And Dean. Soft smiles at Dean, stealing his coffee when he doesn't even drink it, the warm pressure of their arms pressing together, fighting and fucking and whispering
"Oh, good." Castiel hums and proceeds to flat out ignore him, turning to talk to Claire and Kaia instead, finding out why they're here, when they arrived, how long they'll be staying.
"Thanks," Dean says, yet again. He takes the water and drinks it, staring at the wall. The water has no business being that cold and good and refreshing, but it is. Doesn't help the awkwardness, though.
Dean clears his throat. "Right. Well, I mean, I've done some pretty kinky shit, man. I think my line is just—like, don't kill me, ya know?"
Dean nods slowly. "Okay. Well, that's—I mean, it all worked out for the best, right? Everyone's good. You're back. Jack's back. It's good, right?"
For a moment, he stands there and stares at Dean's mouth, thinking about it and thinking about it and forcing himself to stop thinking about it. Fortunately, Dean doesn't even seem to notice. He's too busy slumping, his breath caught, apparently having some sort of crisis. Castiel leaves him to it, wrenching away and stomping out of the garage.
Dean is teaching her about how most modern cars have release-levers inside the trunk that opens it from the inside in case she's ever kidnapped, because you never know, when Claire joins them in the garage. She says something to Kaia, murmuring low in her ear, and Kaia raises her eyebrows before shaking her head and moving back into the Bunker with a quick wince in Dean's direction.
"Yeah, out like a light. You know how he is. We were up late last night," Dean says, moving over to the coffee machine.
"I'm sorry," Cas murmurs. "I'll—I am so thankful to know you, Dean. Being your friend all these years… I will never be able to properly express what your friendship means to me. All of you—Sam and Jack, too. This family that we have, I am grateful to be a part of it. I want to keep it. I want you to get to have it for a very long time."
"There's this guy at the library who likes me a lot. He's really sweet, and I like him, too. But it's more serious for him than me. I don't—I can't really… Not for a while, I think. But I use him sometimes. Let him come over just to remember what a warm body feels like, and when I close my eyes, I picture Levina instead," Sorine confesses. "He's in love with me, and I let him be, knowing I don't love him back."
that, so I don't get—I can't get my head around it. But, fine, if this is the dumbass hill he wants to die on, we will abandon him there." He cuts a quick look at Dean, coughing. "Uh, metaphorically, I mean. Obviously."
Sam considers him for a long moment, running his hand over his mouth, then he exhales slowly and drops his hands. "Okay. That's—yeah, okay."
to leave me. Why do you always choose to leave me? You have no idea what that feels like, because I can't—it's not even an option for me."
"Continue," Castiel says, pressing his thumb harshly into the line of Dean's jaw. It twitches under his hold, flexing a little.
"Sammy, I gotta go," Dean blurts out, pivoting on the spot. Sam makes another alarmed noise, and he huffs. "No one's dead or dying. Everything's fine. Probably. I just did something stupid without thinking. Talk to you later."
Well, at least he's not dying anymore. In retrospect, he probably shouldn't have been so calm about it, huh? Bad sign. Just like drinking the nights away are a bad sign. And so is false cheer that makes him a little sick to his stomach. But hey, Dean is pretty good at ignoring bad signs.
Castiel's eyes are snapping over to Dean in an instant before he can think better of it, and that knot tightens in his chest so quickly that he's fortunate he doesn't have anything to heave up. Looking at Dean Winchester is a detriment to his health, clearly, and he doesn't know when these feelings will pass, if they ever will. It infuriates him. He can feel his face twisting with his anger as he looks away, unable to hide his displeasure.
Dean releases a harsh breath. "Okay, that's—I really wish that's not how you found out, though. I tried to tell you before then, Cas. A few times."
"Mm, good," Cas rumbles, a hint of smugness seeping into his expression. He flicks his gaze over Dean, slow about it, like he's savoring it. "That's good to know."
The truth is, Castiel is around a lot. While this is nice compared to him...not being around at all, Dean can't help but wonder if Castiel is
call me back until tomorrow," Dean declares, then immediately hangs up and cuts his phone off. He tosses it back on the nightstand, sighing as he looks down at his dick. Yeah, like a popped balloon. Brothers will kill the mood every goddamn time.
Sam looks at him, then takes a deep breath and slowly lets it out. "Okay, don't bite my head off or anything, but why are you so convinced that you
Dean moans into the kiss, opening his mouth wider, gasping. He gives, so very malleable, as willing to be covered with Castiel's body and kissed as deeply as possible as Castiel is to do it all. Dean is generally a giver—a caretaker, for all that he would deny it. But, in this, he takes. He takes, and takes, and takes, and seems so very eager to do so.
But after, there was nothing. Dean's guilty for shying away from it as well, but he's also bad about seeking it out. Cas hasn't really given him ample opportunity as of late, never staying around him alone for too long, never letting their touches linger and their gazes meet for heavy stretches of time. He's been careful, only wavering once after the deal when he kissed Dean about the Ma'lak box plan, but that hadn't exactly been a happy time for either of them.
After Jack is gone, Castiel sits at the table and listens to the far-off sounds of Dean cleaning up. It seems far off, at least, even if it's in the same room. He stares at his hands on the table, studying them, thinking about Jack on a constant loop.
