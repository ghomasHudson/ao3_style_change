They laid back on the couch. Two needed to comfort of each other’s touch. Steve rested his head on Tony’s chest, listening to his heartbeat.
"This will only get stronger as you get further along, so making trips between New York and California may prove difficult," said Edith.
Steve showered and dressed. He waited by the entrance for Tony. As always he came speeding into the driveway. Steve smiled, getting into the car. He kissed Tony as got into the car. They raced off in the direction of home. Steve had finally gotten used to Tony’s driving.
“It’s a platypus lovey. Any baby can have a unicorn or teddy bear one. I wanted her to have something unique,” said Peggy.
He was quick to change, knowing if he didn’t move fast enough there may be hell to pay. Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist keeping him close. They stay like that for most of the day.
He took the box of crackers from the cabinet and a water bottle from the fridge. Steve went to the bathroom and settled on the floor. Tony watched him from the doorway.
“This isn’t a conversation you want to have with sleeping pups so close,” said Natasha, before leading them to a nearby office. Steve slammed the door closed behind them. It shuddered violently in its hinges.
Tony worked with Piper sleeping on his chest. She started waking up. Piper yawned. Her fingers played harmlessly against the surface of his arc reactor.
"Thor, this is Stark. We've found a half Asgardian child. It’s not any child Thor. He shares fifty percent of your DNA. Maria and Pepper have taken him in. But we need to know what to expect here,” he said.
She started building. By three in the morning, she'd gotten a fair amount of the mountainscape done. Staring at it, she couldn't help thinking about Winter.
Norepinephrine - substance that is released predominantly from the ends of sympathetic nerve fibers and that acts to increase the force of skeletal muscle contraction and the rate and force of contraction of the heart. The actions of norepinephrine are vital to the fight-or-flight response, whereby the body prepares to react to or retreat from an acute threat.
“Sir it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalizing the Mark 42.”
A young beta couple came with a stroller and two older children. Tony didn’t know what Steve saw, but he saw a tired couple though they did look happy.
She left Daddy, believing he’d be okay, going to Papa’s studio. Turning the knob door only to find it was locked. She pressed her ear to the door, hearing nothing worrying. She took a pen from her overall pocket, unscrewing it and quickly using it to pick the lock. She quietly opened the door. Papa was asleep on the couch.
"I love that you are willing to go to such extents for Piper. But she'd prefer you, here instead of getting revenge she has no interest in. If you continue like this, I'll be forced to keep the promise you made me make," said Tony.
Lena emptied her pockets. She dropped several pens, some crumpled pieces of paper and a pack gum to the floor. From this distance, Piper couldn't see the language the ingredients were written in. She had to get closer if she wanted to get any idea of where she was. Piper took a breath before stepping out from behind Theodore. The alpha tried tucking her behind him again.
Tony nodded. An hour later they were on a private plane to New York. They slept the entire flight. When they got home they cuddled up in their nest. Steve struggled to get comfortable.
The relaxation brought upon by his touch allowed the anesthesia to take effect. Tony allowed some of the tension to leave his shoulders when Steve's eyes closed. Ever so often there was a clink of the metal pieces of shrapnel being removed. Every thirty minutes Steve would wake up in the same fearful state only for him to soothe it away. It went on like that for ten hours. The most draining ten hours of Tony's life. Finally, it was over. Blackwell started stapling closed the wound. Tony cringed as the tube was pulled from Steve’s throat. Despite the discomfort of the site he was relieved to see Steve was breathing on his own. Steve was wheeled back to his room. Tony caught his name on a piece of bloody shrapnel.
Piper smiled. It was the first one he'd seen all day and Tony relaxed. Seeing that single expression melted his stress and tiredness away. He put her down in the playpen. She didn't fuss, yawning softly. A small victory. Tony laid down on the couch. He only needed a few minutes to close his eyes, that’s all. In what felt like seconds later, Jarvis woke him up.
As Tony woke he was hit by the smell of Steve's slick. He pressed his nose against Steve’s neck. It was clear his heat was coming soon. He pulled Steve close. The omega sought his comfort pushing his nose into Tony's neck, seeking comfort.
She did as told, letting Lena take her vitals. Piper couldn’t stop herself from crying. She missed Uncle Bruce. He made going to the doctor fun. And Papa would be sitting in the corner chair if she got scared. She couldn’t cry! Piper sniffled, wiping away her tears. She was silent as the examine continued.
He threw off his sweater. Natasha picked it up and read over the label an Everlane. They ranged from anywhere one hundred to three hundred dollars. Steve probably didn’t know. It was nothing to Tony, but Steve would freak out. Steve deserved some spoiling. She smiled when Steve pulled clothes from a drawer.
"No, no, don't cry." Tony dabbed away the tears. Steve nuzzled against his neck, breathing his scent. He growled.
Despite the brutality of their fight, she didn't think he was the bad guy. Rune was like her and Winter, a person forced to do bad things. Winter was the result. They were likely meant to be the improved version of him. But there was something fun about the idea of fighting Rune. Someone on somewhat equal footing with her. But she had to get to know the potential ally.
Steve opened the door to a cozy office. The room smelled of lavender. It had large windows that looked out the surroundings. Hanging on the wall were black and white war photos. How many wars had he missed? A large cozy couch was pressed against the wall. On the coffee table was a plate of donuts. Sitting in an old leather armchair was an elderly beta. The man was slightly chubby and gave off a comforting aura. He had a thick mustache-goatee combination. His black hair was streaked gray and white. He wore a blue plaid shirt and black tie. A pair of large metal-framed glasses balanced on his nose. They added years to his appearance.
Winter’s jaw clenched. It was the most likely possibility. And if so, the danger level was even greater.
“It isn’t me, though! You don’t think I want to rip him apart for what he did. I’m not that strong of man, Steve.”
Distress leaked from underneath the door into the hallway, so Natasha picked the lock and let herself in. The unbridled scent of distress sent her reeling back. Taking a deep breath through her mouth, she steadied and pushed forward, shutting the door quietly behind her. No one else needed to see this. Steve was curled up on the bathroom floor, shivering. It was wrong seeing him in such a state. She'd seen many a broken man, but this was different. There was hope for repair.
"Her doing nothing this time, doesn't mean she won't do something next. Do not allow her to lull you into a false sense of security. She's dangerous."
Steve nodded. Tony had to be fine. He took a deep breath. He wouldn’t get worked up. Tony needed him, breaking down couldn’t be option now.
“I want you to handle the Zemos once I’ve left the area. Inform Fury, but have him hold off on taking any further action before I've told Steve and Tony."
, he had one now with a boyfriend who was asleep on their couch. By the time he got to the penthouse floor, Tony was showing signs of waking up. He placed the paper bags on the kitchen counter. Steve toed off his shoes. He poured Tony a mug of coffee. He handed the drowsy alpha.
He followed the large omega into the kitchen, where he was introduced to Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Pepper Potts, and Maria Hill. The collective IQ in the room was massive.
“You’re a smart girl. You know that’s not what I meant. Let’s start again. How did you feel before the incident?” asked Lena.
Tony climbed into the nearest car, speeding in the direction of the hospital. He pulled into the parking garage. The press hadn't shown up yet, but it was only a matter of time. He went to the front desk.
“You’re not one. I know monsters,” he said. That’s what he was. He knew how beasts behaved. She was not him, not yet.
“True,” sighed Steve, tilting his head back. He jolted when Tony’s hand slid up his shirt. The alpha turned his head to the side wordlessly asking if he’d done something wrong. “Your hands are cold."
Tony waited in the kitchen for Steve. A minute later, the omega came out.  Steve came out shirtless.
A helicopter fell from the sky. Its blades shredded through what remained of his house. Tony was caught in the falling rubble. His was work and possessions exploded around him. Water engulfed him. He sunk. Water leaked into his armor as he sunk further. He was powerless. Chunks of cement piled on top of him.
Steve nodded. He took Tony’s hand. Steve cringed when entered the hall. It smelled of his heat. He wanted to hideaway. Steve felt the eyes on him as they walked through S.H.I.E.L.D. Tony snarled at any alpha that got too close. They got to the car. Halfway through the drive, his heat started to spike. He squirmed.
“Shouldn’t we give this information to Rhodes. This won't help your current standing with your husband," said Jarvis.
Mark 5 came crashing through the door with a vial in hand. The helmet locked around his head. Even wafting in the smell would be enough to knock him out. Mark 5 clamped around Steve's wrists. It wouldn't hold him for long. Tony ran to Steve, tilting the content of the vial into his mouth. It was spat in his face, but it had the wanted effect. He caught Steve before he collapsed, lowering him gently to the floor.
The man ran off. He wasn't going to chase after the man and give a chance to take more photos. How had he even gotten on their property?  Steve was uneasy. It was rare to see anyone else on the beach. On occasion, a distant neighbor would jog by but never this. At most, they'd wave before moving on. This was their territory he didn't want strangers on it. He went back to the house. Once he changed he went to the lab.
Her cries turned to soft whimpers as he placed her in the car seat. Steve got into the back seat with her and Tony.
“You aren’t, Steve. She’s a confused little girl who’s suffered a great deal of trauma. Her brave front is only a mask. It will crumble, and when it does, you and Tony will be there to pick up the pieces,” said Barny.
"You said we're doing something new today. So what is it?!" she asked excitedly. No matter how many times she had asked yesterday, he’d refused to tell, saying she'd find out tomorrow.
“I was going to put a bullet through my head after I found a cure for Pepper. There was no reason to live without you or the pup. It would be that or I’d drown myself in the bottle.”
“He safe, Stark. We have a protocol set in place for events like this. Extra precautions have been taken”, said Phil.
Tony took a breath. Only sixteen days maybe less and they’d be parents. A pup could be born three weeks before or two weeks after the predicted due date. She could come any day now. It was a terrifying thought. Shit, what if she’d come during the battle. He hoped the pup had his sense of timing and would be late.
Steve ran through the alleys of New York avoiding the masses by climbing onto the rooftops. His heart raced painfully in his chest. The cold air wicked painfully at his tears. He easily jumped from building to building, stopping when he saw the Brooklyn Bridge.
The reintroduction of serum affected his pregnancy. HIs morning sickness was sometimes so intense it caused dehydration. He'd have to be hooked up to an IV so he wouldn't blackout. The pup's kick became a painful experience. She frequently broke his ribs and left large dark bruises on his sides and stomach.
“A hero? Like you? You’re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle,” he said.
God, he hoped that was all Steve needed, but he had a nagging sense it wasn't. Tony balanced Piper in one arm, taking off his shirt, and tossing it to the floor. "What the hell happened, Jarvis?"
She nodded. Lunch arrived. Winter brought the tray toward them, placing it the middle of the cell. Piper stumbled over, unable to walk a straight line, before sitting across from him.
Natasha climbed onto his back and Steve easily made the leap, even with her added weight. She slid off him. It took hours just for them clear the maze. Steve sighed knowing it would take days too clear this out.
They made their way to their room as she nosed against Helmut’s neck, taking in his scent. They maybe betas, but sharing their scent was still a comfort. The powerful scents of alphas and omegas were overrated. Lena and Helmut held each other through the night.
Fury uploaded the information relating to the bombing onto a separate drive. He would keep the identity of its maker to himself. He did not want Stark getting distracted by the news of his daughter before he'd gotten the information he needed about its production.
“That’s the question you’re going to start with? Why not dive into what you really want to know? I agreed to answer. I’m not going to go back on my word.”
He nudged Tony toward the door. When the alpha was gone, he picked up a pencil and started sketching. Then put down the first layer of paint. The rough image, staring back at him, was Tony's arc reactor.
The omega tackled him. While his attacks were sloppy with emotion, the few that struck were powerful nonetheless. Winter grabbed his knife, sinking it deeply into the omega’s leg, and pushed past him. He needed to get away but he didn’t want to permanently hurt someone Piper loved. An arm wrapped around his neck, trying to choke him out. Winter jabbed his elbow repetitively into the omega’s side, cracking ribs.
“How can feel safe with me around her?” He was a threat to his pup. The beautiful being he brought into this world. “You can’t say it isn’t a possibility.”
Three minutes later, she was out. He carefully pulled a blanket over her. She’d sleep for one to two hours. That was if she didn’t have nightmares. She had nightmares almost every other day. The pup didn't have to tell him what they were about. It was either about her being kidnapped or the men she killed. No matter which one, she was left emotionally drained afterward.
. His heart calmed. Alpha kissed him. He whined when the gentle touch was broken. Steve pulled the alpha into bed. He snuggled close, hiding his face in alpha’s neck. Steve tightly clutched his shirt.
Steve nodded. One of the agents showed him to a room, sitting on the table was a metal box. Inside was his uniform. He ran his fingers over the star. It had been so long since he last dawned the stars and stripes. He put it on.
Ten were in the penthouse. Another ten were making their way to his lab. Unwelcomed alphas had broken into his territory and were threatening his omega! The elevator doors opened. Men dressed in black came rushing in. Bullets deflected off his armor. He shot through the top of the elevator, cutting the cables. Half managed to slide through.
“It’s lead. More than we’ve had in a while. It will likely keep happening. I’m not going to ignore,” said Tony.
Piper came out of the bathroom feeling nice and clean. The room smelled less strongly of cleaner now than when they’d entered. She did the same as Winter, scenting the room while he showered. Piper climbed into bed, yawning ready for bed. Questions in her mind were making it harder to settle into sleep.
His hold on her scalp tightened. Her face was roughly shoved into a slotted muzzle, allowing her to breathe and talk clearly.
It was a safety for him. As long as that reactor was alight, his mate was safe. His mate would always be there, but it was a safety crutch for him. He couldn’t let his need for a crutch to affect his family.
Steve handed her over. The lack of hesitation caught Bruce off guard. Omegas were extremely protective over their pups, even more so in the first few weeks of life. So Steve giving over Piper, knowing full well what he was it came as a shocker. She stared up at him. There was something to those eyes. They were insightful like she was studying him. She smiled and tried reaching out to him.
Matt nodded. What had he done to earn seeing this side of Steve? They'd only met once four years ago. It was only by chance he discovered Steve so vulnerable.
Steve’s shoulders sagged in relief. Even, after all, he’d gone through his baby was perfectly protected inside him.
. Something from his past had to get in the way. If he didn’t help get the Tesseract from this Loki, there may not be a world to bring his pup into. He had no choice but to accept the mission.
She kicked against him and whined. He put her in a fresh diaper. She relaxed. Piper tugged his shirt.
Tony held his mate close as the pleasure of his release spread through him. Slowly releasing his hold. Tony licked his refreshed claim. He shallowly thrust into his omega, earning a soft tired purr. When his knot went down he moved from Steve. He lay next to his mate, running his fingers through Steve's hair.
Tony cringed as the red-headed omega appeared in the elevator. She stormed toward him, her heels clanking angrily against the floor.
“Your eyes glowed blue. There was a blue light under your skin. Waves of the stuff came off you. And you’re super strong, almost as strong as me.”
"I doubt I'll have to get it. The tearing was minor. I only have to take it easy for a few weeks," said Tony.
Steve woke in a cold sweat, screaming. His heartbeat in agony. Chilling fear strummed through him. The studio doors shot open. Tony came running in. The alpha's arms were around him. He pressed into Tony’s neck breathing in his scent. The smell of their pup was carried on his clothes.
“Okay, sweetie. Bath time and I'll have Jarvis order your favorite junk food. And then we'll watch your favorite movies. How does that sound?"
Now that the pup was free of distraction, it didn’t Lena long to repeat the process she’d begun during her first session with the child. She activated the child.
A bell chimed as the entered. The floor was a white and black checkerboard pattern. The seats were upholstered with a sparkly red and white fabric. They took a seat in one of the booths.
There was that smirk. Mechanical arms came out of the floor, unlocking his armor. It has been weeks since they last made love. He ran up the stairs to the master bedroom. Shedding his clothes as he walked to the master bedroom. Steam clouded the glass of the shower. He opened the door. Steam hit his face. Steve stood in the middle of the spray, with his back facing him. His arms moved around Steve’s waist. He ran his fingers over Steve’s stomach. The omega’s core muscles had softened. The beauty turned in his arms. Steve nosed against his neck.
Tony dug his fingers into the sand. He was a dick a merchant of death, but he would never force himself upon an omega. Tony nodded. His hand went to Steve, gently squeezing it.
"Yes, by the time to the machine is ready. He'll be stable enough to endure the process," said Hounsfield.
Tony finished he finished off the coffee. Natasha allowed him through. He went to Steve's room, pulling a chair close to bed before collapsing into it. Straightening up when someone entered the room, relaxing when saw Natasha with Steve's shield. She placed by the foot of the bed and took her leave. Steve whimpered his unfocused blue eyes open. There was only a slim line of blue.
“He can’t make us do anything. He knows that and isn’t trying to trick us into thinking otherwise,” said Piper.
Steve nodded. Tony draped an arm around Steve’s shoulder. He didn’t make any further move to touch him, waiting for Steve to relax. Steve took a breath and leaned tentatively against him. Tony closed his eyes and tried to unwind. He carded his fingers through Steve’s hair hoping it would serve to soothe his mate further. Eventually, the tension melted. When he looked at the man huddled against his side he couldn’t find the warnings of a mental break.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You worry too much. Piper is only three, Steve. She has plenty of time to make friends."
He watched the girl work through the task, trying to piece things together, unable to stop his mind from wandering. How long would he be allowed to teach her? She learned so quickly. How many years would it take for him to teach her all he knew? Once he was done teaching her, he'd have no further purpose in her life. They’d want her to master the skills only female operatives perform. He couldn't teach her those, nor did he want to. Winter didn't want anyone to. She should stay the way she was. He had never mastered the art of seduction. That delicate tool was beyond his capabilities.
“Right, and then you just said it by name, while denying having said it.” Tony struggled to get back up. He braced himself against the car for support.
A new flood slick dripped down his thighs at the sight of it. He grabs the toy from the box. The toy had a gentle curve to it. Steve whimpered as he pulled his fingers away. He spread his legs, pressing it against his wet aching slit. Steve gasped as it pushed into his tightness. It touched the places his fingers couldn’t. Moaning in relief finally being full. There was an awkward moment when he searched for the button. His slippery fingers found a plastic groove and pressed one. He jolted in wonderful surprise started buzzing against all the right places.
kidnapping. They never really discussed how he became Ironman. She seemed more interested in the tech than the story, not that he could blame her; the tech was amazing.
Pepper let herself into the room. She was greeted by Steve puking into a trashcan. Pepper quickly shut the door. No one outside of this room could see Steve like this. It would bring up too many questions. Ones that weren’t ready to answer yet.
Steve got up before Tony. Piper’s sleeping pattern was more difficult for the alpha. He tucked her in Tony's arms. It wouldn't be much longer until she would need to nurse. She hadn't displayed any signs of the strength that broke his ribs on a weekly basis. Maybe that power was dormant at the moment.
“We've searched a city of 1.629 million. We can find one man. I already have Jarvis looking. It won’t take long,” Tony said. Though, even an hour more was too long.
He’d been looking forward to speaking with Dr. Banner for multiple reasons. Banner was someone who could communicate with on the same academic field, so few were capable of doing that.
Piper sniffed, catching the scent of a new person. Was it another prisoner, or was it the visitor. Their exact location was unknown, but they were close. She closed her eyes, focusing on their scent. It was an older male alpha. The specific tones of his scent blocked by scent proofing in the walls. Who was it?!
“I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odin’s son, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract and when I wield it-
"My best inventions come out of getting out things I don't want to do. There has to be a better design," said Tony as he fumbled with the tool.
He walked through the penthouse straightening up things as he went. He ran his finger over the bookshelf, pausing on a photo album. Unable to resist he pulled it from its place. He touched the pale pink cover. It was Piper’s baby album. He should put it back. Looking through it would only hurt. But how much worse could it get? He went to the couch, setting the book on the coffee table. He stared at it for a while before finally opening it, smiling when he saw Piper’s tiny painted handprints on the first page. They were so small.
Once he was satisfied with his nest he huddled under the blanket. Purring as dug deeper into the soft fabric. He intended on sleeping through as much of his preheat as possible.
He walked down the aisle of cells, stopping in front of 1013, looking through the small bulletproof window in the door. Sitting inside on the steel bunk was a woman in a flowered dress, Dr. Lena Zemo. Her presence was oddity compared to her neighbors. He replaced her guards twice due to their sympathy toward her. The warden thought he was crazy for how he’d treated the beta.
“I have these trading cards. I was wondering if you could sign them if you had the chance. If it isn’t too much trouble,” said Phil.
“He did. It took a while longer for me to forgive myself.” He sighed. "What I’m trying to say, Piper, is you need to reframe your way of thinking. You aren't there anymore."
"No, I have to take the good with the bad. Those dark moments make the good moments shine all the brighter,”
“Looks like everything is holding steady, I think,” said Steve. Jarvis would have told him otherwise.
Tony looked up when he heard Steve. He wore a pale blue long sleeve shirt and dark blue jeans that hugged his perfectly shaped butt. The shirt was slightly unbuttoned giving a peek of his chest.
The glass wall sealed behind them. He put Piper on the mattress pulling the blanket over her. She should sleep for the rest of the day. When dinner came, he gently nudged her awake.
"I can do this myself, but stay close." He wanted to get an idea of the situation before he felt comfortable bringing Tony in.
She took in her surroundings. The walls were gray and the fluorescent light stung her eyes. Bars surrounded her every side.
A sudden wave of panic spread over him. The crayon snapped. He covered his face trying to work through the building panic.
His hold loosened. How could he think that? Father loved them both it didn’t matter that they weren’t blood.
"Sometimes the truth can come off as mean, but there was no ill intent behind it," said Lena, almost kindly.
Tony made room for him in bed, taking him into his arms. They touched their foreheads together. Closing his eyes as Tony fingers ran through his hair, Steve said, “I love you.”
Lena kneeled down, catching her four-year-old son in a hug. In his hand was his Ironman action figure. She held him tight.
“Piper will have to be coached in what to say. A very select few will know the truth of her story,” said Pepper.
“Our bond, when it was made some of the side effects of the serum must have been passed on. Well, that’s the theory. This isn’t my field of expertise. I’ll ask Banner about it,” said Tony.
He went in, taking stock of the bar audience. Country music was playing in the background. There was only one weapon he could spot, the sheriff's revolver. Toward the back, he found who he was looking for. She sat alone with a heavy expression, fiddling with some dog tags.
Tony still held it out. He sighed taking it. Steve left for the beach. He laid out a towel and sunbathed, closing his eyes. When he heard someone coming toward him. Their scent was unfamiliar. He straightened taking a less vulnerable position. A camera clicked.
Drumming forced her attention from freeing Winter. A large troop wielding shields, blocking her in. She straightened her stance as her opponents drew closer, falling back on her training successfully. Metal doors rose from the ground. She screamed slamming herself against the wall, but she only succeeded in disorienting herself and leaving a large dent.
Steve made swift work of the task. Once done, he sat at the island, watching Tony cook. It was a treat having an alpha cooking for him. He was used to it being the other way around. When he was growing up, he was expected to rear pups and cook for his alpha after a long day of work.
Steve breathed out the words his alpha seemed unwilling to say, but which neither of them could refuse to consider, “or if whoever it was decides to try again.”
He watched Steve process. Tony moved to give Steve his space, but Steve’s hand took his. The hold was gentle, so he could pull away if he wanted. Tony dared to come nearer. Steve embraced him. Tony was quick to follow respond wrapping his arms around Steve. Relief spread through him at the touch of their skin. Steve purred, seeming to take just as much from the touch. They move to the couch.
"I don't know." He remembered bits and pieces from different decades, but nothing was clear. There was no number he could put together.
The light extinguished from her and she went limp in his arms. Winter lost consciousness seconds later.
Thor landed on the cargo door. Aggression leaked off the large alpha. He tossed aside Tony. Thor yanked Loki from his seat before flying out.
They fell into comfortable ease. The two lay comfortably on the couch. Tony was bathed in Steve’s wonderful scent. The omega was sandwiched between him and the couch. He played with Steve’s necklace. Every now, his fingers ‘accidentally’ ran over Steve’s scent gland, causing the omega to sigh and shudder. Steve met their lips in a brief kiss. Tony cradled the omega’s face keeping, him from breaking in the kiss. He let Steve pull away, smiling. Tony ran his thumb over his cheek. They kissed a few more times as the movie continued. Steve fell asleep around twelve. Tony gently nudged the omega awake.
“There are already so many things that would get in the way. Two travel buddies won't make it any worse," said Piper. And, though Piper very carefully didn’t say this, it would be so lonely, or so scary if she had to make her way to freedom with someone else who was also trying to find a new home in the world.
"Soon enough, all those troublesome emotions will be wiped away. Once you're warmed up, you'll be erased. And hopefully useful." Rumlow smirked at the apparent fear twisting through Winter's expression.
He was thrown out the window. His suit crashed through the window, diving after him. It wrapped around him, moments before he would have hit the ground. He zoomed up the tower, facing Loki.
for his lab. His mate needed him and that gave him purpose. It was more useful than he'd been in days. Steve's muscles jumped. A wounded noise tore from his throat, loud and desperate.
The days before the missions were dull. It was filled with training going over the mission. There was one highlight of his late-night calls with Tony.
“I don’t want to think about that,” she said. She shook her head, trying to shake out the bad thoughts Winter put there. There were other things she had to focus on, like how they were going to get out.
“Have you ever heard the saying ‘don’t look a gift horse in the mouth’?” asked Lena, a little heatedly. Piper shook her head. “It means to find fault in a gift that has been given to you. Don’t be ungrateful, Piper.”
Bruce ran had through his curled hair. He flipped through the page. “How much of it did you understand?”
"Battle, I don't know where or when but I knew that much. It was dark. All I could hear was shell fire," he said.
“Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming,” said Fury pacing the room. He stopped between two heroes. As stubborn and problematic as they were still heroes. “Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number though because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea Stark knows this called the Avengers Inchoative the idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to fight the battles we never could."
"Yes, your frequent visits have drawn quite a crowd. Everyone hopes to catch a glimpse of you. But I set aside your favorites. Half a dozen cinnamon buns and half a dozen blueberry muffins," said Pray.
Press surrounded the tower. Flowers were piled high against its 30-foot windows Boxes of sympathy letters crowded the lobby. No privacy. The whole world was watching them. They'd done a press conference asking for their daughter to be returned but it was all for show.
Steve leaned back into the seat. Seventies music was playing. Tony had been introducing him to different musicians. He preferred the Beetles over the Rolling Stones, who were one of Tony’s favorites bands. It wasn't that Rolling Stones were bad he just preferred the gentler tones of Beetles. So far some of his favorite singers were Etta James, Elton John, Frank Sinatra, The Supremes, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, and Stevie Wonder. That was only the shortlist. He hadn’t given Elvis a good listening too but it was on his list of things to do. They pulled up to the S.H.I.E.L.D facility. He took some of the boxes and bubble wrap from the van.
“Three months. Yinsen became one of my closest friends. He helped me build the first Ironman,” said Tony.
He broke out of his suite and rushed toward the stairs. A soldier sped toward, he jumped from the deck to another. A suit flew passed taking care of his pursuer. He glanced back. Steve and Pepper were hanging off a ledge above him.
Tony picked her up and placed her on her blanket in front of a pile of blocks. He put a bottle in the warmer and Jarvis turned on the news. The toys seemed to catch her interest while Tony waited for the warmer to bing. He tested it against his wrist. When he tried taking her from her toy she cried.
“Certain instruments leave a distinct type of bruising. I thought there’d be multiple patterns present but there’s only one, a fist. He’s strong. Strong enough to snap grown man’s femur in half do you know how much force that takes to do that?” said Ballentine.
, he couldn't think like that! Attachment wasn't something he could afford. Starks weren’t the settling down type. Getting attached would only hurt. This was a short-term arrangement.
- from him like they took everything else. She would be taken away. It was only a matter of time. Piper would be wiped from his memory. He wanted to remember her. The pup pulled away. He wiped away her tears.
“Such an old man,” she teased. Nat plugged the flash drive into the laptop. Two files appeared on the screen one labeled male the other female.
He felt exposed. Steve took a breath reminding himself it was for his own good. He fisted the blankets as the doctor worked. He couldn’t stop a small whine from leaving his throat.
“Don’t be. You saved me the calories. I don’t need to add to this gut." Barny patted his belly. "Not everyone has such an amazing metabolism."
"Protective custody, exceptions can be made. Rules can be bent. Is there somewhere you like to go?" said Phil.
Her gaze locked on the man closest to Papa. It was Uncle Bucky. Even though she’d never had the chance to address the man as such. He’d been older than Papa. Every time asked Papa about it made him very upset. The alpha in the picture used to look such a stranger, but now he seemed vaguely familiar.
The woman tensed. “Isabella, you must be here to call in that favor. I don’t know why else you’d show your face here,” she said. “Let’s talk somewhere more private. Your alpha can’t come.”
Winter carefully lifted the pup, and she huddled into his neck. He placed her down on the mattress. Should he wake her? No, leaving while she was awake would only make things difficult. If she asked him to stay, he’d likely defy his orders, which would only put her in further danger.
“No, I’m getting my shield repaired,” he said. Steve smiled softly, but maybe it could turn into one.
“I can understand bottling one’s emotions and unleashing it on a specific day. I would want to hide that away from those I care about not inflict it on them,” he said.
This contact was real. It wasn't the meaningless academic touch of those who worked on him. This was different. He remained still as she slept.
“I love you, Tony”. He moved his hands away, giving the alpha a chance to escape, but he remained. If Tony left he wouldn't go after him. He wouldn't try and influence Tony's choice. “Sometimes you are the only thing keeping me sane. Until now I never thought I’d feel this way again."
Bruce followed Tony into the library, pulling a book from the shelf, causing it to slide away, revealing a hidden entrance; inside was a fully updated lab.
Piper got out of bed and carefully opened the door. The hall was empty. To avoid the squeaky step in the stairway, she slid down the railing, which was actually pretty fun. She would be doing that again. To get to the basement door, she'd have to walk past the gym. If she went outside and tried using the playground tunnel entrance, Jarvis would alert her parents.
“What?” She asked, breath still huffing, “No, I’m not.” She really wasn’t. Piper had given it her best try.
Those bright blue eyes were remarkable. That was part of the reason Howard was so obsessed. Rogers was the perfect male omega form. Most wouldn't see it that way, but he never understood the fascination with the delicate male omega. Jarvis pulled up the information.
Steve cried out. Deeply gasping for breath as he worked through the process. Tony was powerless. It was clear that the omega didn’t want to be touched, so he sat loyally the bed. He placed a cool cloth over Steve’s forehead. An hour slowly ticked by. Edith walked into the bedroom.
“Please don’t cry.” What had he done wrong? He couldn’t handle Steve crying. Before he could overthink it further Steve kissed him.
He stopped, not sure why he was doing this. Winter shook his head again, avoiding the thought. More questions kept popping up. Who was she? ‘Piper’ rung in his head; that was her name. What was she doing here? Why was she with him? Why did he want to protect her? He watched her sleep.
"Despite what a majority of people think, you have a heart. You’ll do right by the kid,” said Rhodes.
Steve undressed and wrapped a towel tightly around his waist. He laid on the table. Two beta females came into the room. Steve closed his eyes in relaxation as they began to work. After an hour Steve was completely relaxed. He was ready to cuddle up with his alpha. Steve slowly sat up.
"I've done this for a long time, Piper." It had proven difficult to hold back his attack. Restraint wasn’t something he was used to during a fight.
Steve quickly dressed. He grabbed his shield and followed Natasha to the quinjet. She got into the pilot’s seat.
"No! I failed. He injected me with something. I couldn't see it but I felt the needle pierce into my womb,” said Steve. It was such a violation. “I couldn’t protect her,” he whimpered over and over.
Soon enough it was time for him to leave for his session with Dr. Turner. Piper was too busy playing with Natasha to notice him leaving.
Steve settled in his arms soon falling asleep. Tony ran his fingers through the omega’s golden brown hair. Steve nuzzled closely to his neck. He couldn’t lose this. Tony ran his fingers over the fading bite mark on Steve’s neck. He smiled when Steve started purring in his sleep.
He nodded. She was on the verge of crying again. There were no words he could say to make her feel better, so he rubbed her back.
Tony sighed it was probably nothing, but he needed a distraction. He glanced at Steve, who was still dazed, hovering on the edges of his earlier panic.
“What's gamma radiation?” asked Steve. He knew radiation was terrible in general. It was poisonous, caused cancer, and most often lead to a slow miserable death.
“Let me see.” He snagged the alpha’s hand from behind his back. Steve had further damaged his alpha’s already broken fingers. “Get the first aid kit.”
Steve followed Jarvis’s directions to the lab. It was the same setup as the lab in New York, but bigger. He kept glancing back at the door, so tempted to return.
An extremely cute image of a five-year-old caught his focus. He had a button nose and deep brown eyes. His hair was light honey brown hair. He had a clever familiar smile.
Before Lena could add to the conversation her phone rang. Pierce's number appeared on the screen. “I have to take this. I’ll be right back,” she said.
Steve had at least an hour until Edith arrived. He reeked. Spraying off the distress would help him relax. Help his mind feel less frantic.
His inner omega screamed at him to return; to make sure that woman didn’t go anywhere near the sire of his pup.
Maya ignored him. "See we all begin wide-eyed pure science. Than ego steps in, the obsession and you look up you're a long way from shore."
Dr. Wong was a physiatrist who worked with the New York Special Victims Unit for ten years before retiring. He studied medicine at Howard University. Currently, he was volunteering at an omega shelter.
If they didn't keep up act the press would turn against them, claiming they didn't care. Such a turn would make everything more difficult, so the show went on. How much longer would he be able to keep it up?
"You don't want me to sing, pumpkin. Papa is the singer. Do you want to listen to some of the music from my time?" She smiled. “I’ll take that as a yes,”
Her hand slid away from it. She frowned. It was where she was from. But it wasn’t where she belonged anymore. Where did she belong?
Steve sat up leaning against the foot of the couch. That was the farthest they'd gone since his heat. Instinct urged him to lick bite mark he’d left. Tony smiled and ran his fingers through his hair. He scented the alpha breathing in that earthy, clove, and metallic smell.
He wasn’t giving up, not when he was this close! Steve ran to the stairs. The doors were reinforced only set to open in case of emergencies. Forcing it to open would set off an alarm. Steve returned to the elevator. He pushed open the emergency door in the ceiling and pulled himself. He grabbed the cables and scaled up. Only ninety-three stories. He jumped to the penthouse entrance, forcing the doors open. The penthouse was dark. His boots crunched on glass.
“He was a good patient man. You would have liked him. Henry didn’t stop me from pursuing the career. He supported me every step of the way,” she said. She loving stroked the image of her husband. Henry was a great man. He lessened the pain of her loss and swept her off her feet. She thought that was impossible after losing Steve.
A chuckle broke his focus. A very old alpha stepped forth. The boy had caught glimpses of him before, but not so close. The old man always kept to the background. People moved out of the old guy's way wherever he went. Why though? He didn’t smell special. The older alpha approached him, slowly circling around him. The boy kept his gaze low, unchallenging.
"Beautiful, look at me." Steve met his gaze. "I want you to show you off to the world, so every alpha will know they can't have you. There's too much going on right now. I think the world needs a breather before we announce. And I have a more selfish motive."
It was late, but Steve couldn’t sleep. Tomorrow was the big day. They were getting married. He sat alone in the master bedroom. Tony was out on his bachelor party. It would be a few more hours until the alpha returned. He trusted Rhodes to get Tony back in time for the wedding. Rhodes was well aware of the risks if he failed to do so. Resting by the side of his bed was his shield. When his alpha was gone he wanted it near. He knew it didn’t need, but it was a security. Steve looked up from his book when he heard someone enter the mansion. He went for his shield.
“No, Steve you clearly don’t want to this right now.” There had been no passion driving the motion. Steve was only doing out of duty to him.
Piper gave a bitter laugh, letting Daddy's mistake go. Pointing it out would hurt him. She'd already done enough damage to them today. It being unintentional didn't change that.
Steve was curled up in the fetal position shaking in pain. A thin trail of blood leaked from between his legs.
He smelled delicious. Claiming an omega of such standing would be a prize. She scowled, catching the scent of another alpha on him.
He fumbled with the car but finally managed to break into the cold winter air, stumbling to his knees. Tony couldn’t get air into his lungs. His breath came in heavy pants.
"I will always be here for you," he said. Tony leaned into the powerful embrace, waiting for Steve to relax.
Steve walked around taking the time to examine everyone. Each made him smile but left him with a bittersweet feeling.
In the back of his mind, he hoped it was something if it were nothing he came here for no reason when Tony may have needed him.
Tony left, grabbing the ring from its hiding place. He wasn't going to wait any longer to have Steve as his husband. The shower was still running when he came back.
Lately, her absence was being more felt. Carl was asking for her more often and it was starting put a strain on her relationship with Helmut. She wanted to make it open to them. Now that Hydra recently obtained Piper she’d be spending more time away from home. She prayed Helmut would be patient with her. He was the love of her life. It wasn’t like she could say no. Failure to meet expectation could put her family at risk.
Steve showed her the ring. It was a pale silver band, simple and beautiful perfectly suited to Steve's personality.
"Something like this has happened before with gamma radiation. I take it wasn't as easily handled as the bears."
"Piper’s issues don’t seem with be strangers. Cho doesn't even have to meet them in person if you’re not comfortable,” said Bruce.
Steve hesitated at the door. “Maybe we can go later,” said Steve, backing into the shelter of the room.
Gloria laughed. “No, you don’t. You love your work. But don’t lose track of what’s truly important,” she said with a wave of her wooden spoon.
“No, but I can do something,” said Tony. He pulled up a transparent screen. Moments later holographic orbs of white lights appeared around the tree. Steve smiled.
Steve nodded and returned to his room. On his desk was the mission report. He skimmed it over. Then he put it in the shredder. He took the weapon from his holster and cleaned it thoroughly. Once done he showered. By the time he finished everything, he needed to do it was noon. Steve took out his phone. Tony made it for him. Its voice command, which made it easy for Steve to figure out. The phone even explained how it worked. He called Tony.
"Don't apologize," said Tony. Steve rested his head against his chest. Tony ran his fingers through the omega’s hair. Steve apologized far too much. He thought he’d be the one constantly apologizing. "Was it as bad as the last one?"
He made it inside. The place was a mess. There was a passed out one sleeping on a Ping-Pong table. He maneuvered his way through the building. Tony slowed when heard another guard speaking. He shocked the man unisonous, taking his gun. The beta female there was too high or drunk to care that he was there.
"Your parents wouldn't give up on you. Don't give up on them." It was wrong of him to encourage that level of hope. But it was right in another sense.
Steve purred, hoping it would help relax the alpha. Tony unwound slightly. Telling Tony, it wasn't his fault wouldn't relieve the guilt.
"Tony, I never said you'd be a bad dad. You're a good man, and I think you're capable of raising a child with Steve's help, of course."
Their vacation couldn’t be more perfect. There was great food, great sex, and a great time. It was mid-April and Steve was enjoying the change into spring. He hadn't seen his alpha for three days. The man had locked himself away in his lab, giving him no clue to what he was working on. When asked the alway was vague or misdirected. Tony would likely make some big reveal of whatever it was.
“Okay, we can start on your nest,” suggested Tony. He didn’t want Steve linger on the thought that this shouldn’t be happening. It would be better if they both had a task work on.
Tony was forced to come up from his lab at two in the morning for a coffee refill. In a moment of frustration, he blasted his coffee machine. Poking at the debris on the kitchen counter, he heard Steve whimpering in their bed. He quietly crept into their bedroom, trying not to make any sudden sounds, and sat down on Steve’s side of the bed.
Lindbergh Baby - On March 1, 1932, Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, was abducted from the crib in the upper floor of his home in Highfields in East Amwell, New Jersey, United States. On May 12, the child's corpse[3] was discovered by a truck driver by the side of a nearby road.
Steve took her. He tensed when she nuzzled against him. Steve shook his head as his feral side threatened to take over. He was too tired to fight it.
Tony's suspicion of Edith would only grow worse as he got further along; it was the protective alpha instinct.
Steve checked Piper's diaper before buckling her into the car seat. In her hand was the platypus lovey Peggy made for her. Steve got into the backseat with her. Piper’s eyes widen when the car started. Tony had the Beatles playing on a low volume. Twenty minutes into the drive Piper was out.
"It's me, pal. Now last time I went missing if I remember correctly you came looking for me. What are you doing?"
“I can’t tell you, then it won’t come true. At least, that’s the theory behind birthday wishes. It’s movie time now,” said Piper.
“I thought we could make some fun of it. I didn't know what you liked so I got a bit of everything,” said Edith.
“If we’re going to launch product next year I need, Stark. He lacked a decent incentive he has one now,” said Maya.
Steve and the others watched from the ground. Chitaur fell around them. The giant war worms dropped. Steve searched the sky for the man he loved, but couldn’t find him.
They split up to cover more ground. The downpour was so torrential it was difficult to see. A small, motorize drone flew by Steve’s side. Tony likely sent hundreds them out to search for Piper. In the distance, he saw an old cabin. It must have belonged to groundskeeper at one point. Under the deck, he saw a flickering blue light.
"Survival instinct, your inner omega loves the fact that you have an alpha that is willing to go so far to protect your offspring. In freshly bonded omega alpha couples it's normal for them to follow this line of thinking. It only temporary," said Bruce.
This was about Steve. He needed to be there for him, be a good alpha. He wasn't important. Tony took a breath. He tested the water. It was perfect. He went to get Steve. The omega was exactly where he left him.
“You know, I’ve got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it. This little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege,” said Tony, gently tapping the arc reactor.
Raised voices woke Steve. He broke from the warmth of his bed. The scent of another omega touched his senses. It was floral and sweet. He was growling. Unlike other omegas, his snarl was low, resembling that of an alpha’s. Steve covered his mouth. This possessive urge was only due to his heat. It wasn’t his place to interfere. Tony wasn't his alpha, no matter how much his omega wanted him to be.
“So, can you cure me?” asked Piper. Maybe something good could happen from this horrible experience.
A movie was the perfect opportunity to get close to Steve and scent him. He had to make sure no alpha or beta had gone near his omega. Tony didn’t fight the instinct to call Steve his. The guilt was off his shoulders.
At four they got back. Steve ran out of the jet as soon as they landed. He needed to get to the security of his room. Steve fumbled with his keys. He felt someone behind him. He cringed. It wasn’t Kate’s gentle scent. No, it was powerful. It was a mix of gunpowder, red peppers, and earth.
He caught the man in a chokehold. Smith flailed against him. It took nearly a minute for him to pass out. Winter complete the assignment here. His usual tactics wouldn’t work here. They wanted Smith to disappear. Winter readied the room. Lining it with plastic. There could be no trace of him here. The room was it would be simple to end now. He was curious to why. Why he was sent here. Ever since the pup’s arrival, he questioned, not aloud though. His mission was the one thing he thought would be unaffected by her. But here he was lingering. This was dangerous. It was so uncomplicated before, yet he didn’t wish for it to change. He only had to keep himself in line.
Fury glanced up from his paperwork. Despite his position within the organization, he wasn't free of paperwork. A light blinked on his desk, announcing an incoming holographic call. Fury let it ring a few more times before picking up. The blue-tinted hologram of Pierce appeared in front of his desk.
He hurried to the bathroom, the babe pressing down on his bladder. After a quick shower, he went into the kitchen. Tony offered him a plate. Steve poked at it with his fork.
“No, she’ll never have any recollection from anything that occurs in this state. While like this, she’s cut off from the memories of her dominant mindset. I'll demonstrate." Lifesize holographic projections of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers appeared in the center of the room.
He spent an hour with his aunt before giving Happy a call. Aunt Peggy insisted on walking him to the door.
He had to prove that he wasn’t an omega insane with grief. Her posture changed as the message played.
Piper sat up her tossing off her blanket, revealing her blue fire truck pajamas; she refused to wear anything else since receiving them for Christmas. Becoming a fireman was her most recent career obsession. She'd talked about it nonstop for the last three months. Normally, her career interests changed from day to day, or even hourly. Steve nearly had a panic attack when she said she wanted to be a soldier. He wasn't sure if she’d caught his expression, but he was glad she never mentioned it again. A fireman was safe. No one would try and hurt her in such a profession. Steve shook his head; he was putting too much thought into it. She was only three!
By the twentieth verse, Piper fell asleep, so Tony put her to bed again. Hopefully, there wouldn't be any more disruptions. At six in the morning wailing resumed. So much for sleep. He went through Piper’s morning routine. Even after being fed and changed she wouldn’t stop crying. Maybe it was the teeth. He took her teething ring from the freezer offering it to her. She threw it and screeched.
Tony groaned. The last time he watched Dora the Explorer that damn theme song was stuck in his head for days. “Please anything else? Like Sesame Street or Bob the Builder?”
“We’re sorry, sir. It’s just that the design is so unique. We’ve haven’t encountered something like it,” said lab tech.
Steve flipped them, his hips rested between Tony’s legs. Again the blush returned to his cheeks There was something extremely erotic about the position. It caused a shiver to go through his spine. He got up before it could go any further.
‘I’m Still Standing’ was playing in the background. Steve hummed along with the song. Soon he started singing.
“You have to hold mine or Daddy’s hand,” said Steve. He needed one of them to have a connection with her.
Pierce smiled. “I don’t know why I doubted you, Dr. Zemo.” Piper was pure power in its most ruthless form. It only needed time to be harnessed.
The deep ache in his heart made him wish for the numbness of the ice. Steve wished he could be frozen until this was over; until they had their daughter again. He hated the unknown.
Give him a nuclear bomb to defuse, before comforting a crying omega. Instinct took control. He brought Steve close, allowing him to hide his face in the crook of his neck.
Steve tensed. A doctor was the last person he'd ever want to talk about his heat with. He took a breath. Edith was an omega. She was safe. Edith waited until he relaxed, before speaking.
Tony wrapped an arm around Steve, as Steve unwrapped Piper, checking her toes and fingers for frostbite from the short exposure to the frigid air. He wiped the blood from her hands. Her beautiful hair was jaggedly cut. He tucked her back into his jacket. Piper nuzzled into him and began purring. She whined slightly as the jet took off.
"No, simply a reminder of the power dynamic. You may be the adult here, but I'm the one with the power."
“Mr. Stark, if you can join us for some of those sessions. I believe that will be beneficial for both of you."
His mate pulled him close, resting his head against his chest. Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
They walked into the kitchen, where Pepper and Maria were working on the most recent project with Rune. Rune tensed when he saw the doctor and looked like he about to run and tell Piper that he was here.
Tony went upstairs to get Piper’s hairbrush, still hoping Steve would follow through in seeking help for himself. That was the problem with being selfless. It left little room for yourself. He picked up the brush he'd used on Piper. There were a few short strands of hair caught in its teeth. Then he went to the backyard where was Rune was playing with Pepper and Maria. As soon as Rune noticed him, his gaze focused on the ground.
Steve melted into the rhythm, winding his arms around Tony’s neck. Shivering when the alpha’s arousal pressed against his.
"Try not to make a habit of it." Tony yawned already lulled by the calming effect of Steve's relaxing scent.
He wouldn’t call it that, rather a general observation. When someone moved toward them, Piper straightened up and smiled. He’d seen the behavior so many times in Steve. It was meant to be disarming, so the person would lose interest. It was unsettling to see it in a toddler.
“That can be arranged. Call Happy when you’re ready to go. And I’ll have some toys for you there,” said Tony.
Maybe she would have something to help him with his cramping. He went to the office. Edith smiled up at him.
Tony spent several hours in his workshop every now and then he would look from his project to look at the footage from the master bedroom. Steve would be able to peacefully to descend into his heat, instead of being abruptly thrust into like last time. All that could be seen of the omega was a tuff of golden-brown hair. Around five he pulled himself away and went up to the kitchen to make Steve several grilled cheese. The smell of food wasn't enough to lure the omega from his nest. He grabbed the plate and quietly opened the door to their bedroom.
Steve groaned when the phone rang. Before he could destroy the bothersome device Tony reached over him and hung it up.
The drive home was too quick. They sat in the tower of the garage for several minutes. Steve grabbed Tony's blood pressure medicine from the back seat. It was a temporary prescription. He shook a pill from the bottle and offered it to Tony.
"You may call me, Uncle Steve," he said. Steve was sure that Rune would be involved further in their lives as a family. He couldn't see Piper letting go of him.
Steve helped Tony up. They ran down the hall. The others could handle themselves. He hoped. They had their orders. His job was to help Tony fix engine three before another was brought down and they fell from the sky.
Clint tossed at one of the dummies it deflected harmlessly off the target. Steve laughed. He took his shield from the floor.
Clint and Natasha watch them for a moment. He recognized what he was seeing. An alpha and omega very much in love.
"I've gotten a lot closer to it since I've been with you. The arthritis in my hands has gotten better."
"And you want to hurt him?" She picked up on the uncomfortable surprise in her parents' expressions. "Oh, you want to kill him."
“Fuck." Tony was grateful for Steve's feral state. He wouldn’t know how to explain this. “Jarvis, call Fury."
The pickle jar shattered. Tony quickly wrapped Steve’s hand in a dishtowel. He moved the towel and started picking the glass from Steve's hand. The small wound quickly healed over.
She pouted, but whatever they decided couldn’t be worse than what she’d already gone through. Piper knew their limits. Even if she pushed them to the brink, they’d never get physical with her. They could only take something away.
she couldn't cry! Winter wouldn't want that. She hoped that he was in a better place. Almost anywhere was better than back with those people.
Steve turned red but nodded. He poured Rhodes a cup of coffee, hoping it would help the alpha get through his current shock.
“Steve.” He lifted the omega's chin, forcing him to look up. “Our baby is safe. Both of you are healthy.”
Edith was shocked it was positive. With the level of birth control, Steve was on it shouldn't be possible. The test was a reliable brand. The chance of it being a false positive was one in a million.
“I’ll sum it up for you to save us both time. Mr. Stark is willing to pay off all your student loans and refund anything you’ve already paid in full if you keep this incident to yourself,” said Jeri.
The elevator door shut. That brief happiness they'd shared was zapped from Steve's expression. Steve had gone to that distant place again. Tony didn't know how to get the omega out of it. This new task was where his mind needed to be. It was easier than lingering on his relationship issues. Maybe the honeymoon period was over. Banner's studies caught his attention.
Steve got into the shower. He quickly bathed and went out to rejoin his mate only wearing a towel lowly around his waist.
Natasha frequently visited unannounced, seeming to find comfort in their company. Steve enjoyed it. Natasha's visits meant a chance to spar. It kept his skills sharp. She joined them on the couch, snatching the remote.
A car pulling into the driveway caught Piper’s attention. It was a beautifully restored Land Rover 1961 Series II. It was a pale, almost mint green. She was surprised when Dr. Barny come out.
“After whatever tortures Fury can concoct. You appear as a friend as a bond and I would cooperate,” said Loki.
“I know what it’s like to grow up without a father. I don’t want that for her. I don’t think I’ll be able to do it alone.”
Even with what he saw in the wormhole, he didn't want to erase what he had here. This was too good. Yisen was right; he had nothing before. Now he was getting closer to having everything. They stayed on the beach for a while longer before returning to the house.
She put the brushes back, wiping the paint on her hands off on her overalls. She slid off the stool and left, locking the door behind her.
The wheels of the car squeaked as he turned back toward the town. He parked near the town hall. News vans were parked around the building. He put on the cowboy hat he took from Harley and walked through the crowd of cameramen and reporters. He opened the back door of the nearest van and got in.
“Three broken ribs, broken collar bone, torn my left rotator cuff again, two broken fingers, broken cheekbone, and a concussion," said Tony.
For the first time in a week, Steve woke clear-headed. His head felt as if it were stuffed with cotton. His body was heavy. He groaned a sticky mess of sweat, slick, and cum from both his and Tony’s covered his skin. It was disgusting.
Steve woke hours later but wasn't ready to get out of bed. He reached out searching for his mate, but he wasn't there. Steve stretched out before getting out of bed. It was 10:30 pm. He went to his bag, taking out Tony's surprise. Steve put it on, enjoying how the feel of the lace against his skin. He got dressed.
They went to the bathroom. Steve undressed. Tony stopped, taking notice of the fading fingerprint-shaped bruises on his hips. He brushed his hand along the mark.
They finished their breakfast. Piper happily slurped up the colorful cereal milk, burping loudly after she did. Tony smirked and belched too, earing a giggle. He looked at her winter wonderland. And was surprised to see someone besides Elsa in the castle.
"If there were any negative results from the samples he would have told us sooner, not drop them on us now."
“Well, they can’t bank worth a damn. Find a tight corner,” said Clint, shooting down a chariot behind.
Her tears made him uncomfortable, but he didn’t regret not telling her the full extent of her actions.
“I want the damage to their cell repaired by the time I return. While you’re at it give them both a good scrub. Clean the cell too.”
His fingers landed on something paper. Steve's heart broke when he pulled out a hand made card. Piper made them for him or Tony whenever she felt they were having a bad day. Sometimes, she would hide them where she thought they'd find it, so it would be a surprise. On the front was a cow playing checkers with a chicken. He unfolded it.
Piper nodded. He scooped her up in his arms. She beamed up at him. and he could see her teeth were coming in.
She remained still. He pulled a syringe from his pocket and stuck her with the needle. Still no response; she was out. Jeff sighed. Safe for the moment. He wiped the blood from her forehead.
The two of them bundle up and got the car. The GSP showed the blue line of their path. Steve was surprised when a few minutes into their journey Tony pulled off the route and parked.
“Pull up Harley Davidson 42WLA for sale,” said Tony. The bikes ranged from eighteen to twenty thousand. A rusted bike beat up caught his interest. It only cost a grand. A project that Steve and he could work on together.
“It’s kinda funny. When looking for me, how many international privacy laws did you breach? And you’re giving me grief because I borrowed a key.”
He reached out and took Tony’s hand. Steve pressed it against his cheek. The ache his heart dulled at the contact. He had no idea what urged the motion, but the warmth of his hand was so right.
"No, but Theodore sat by Steve in his rocky nest and promised he'd always be there for Steve. As they grew up, they remained side by side. But soon, the time came for Theodore to leave the rocky shore and go to sea. Steve tried to join him but was too weak to swim. So, Steve waited and waited, growing stronger and stronger, hoping his friend would return. Eventually, he went to sea on his own, with his new found strength."
She spent hours observing him. It was all she could do to fill the time. She started sifting through his habits. From the way he made his bed she knew he was from some military branch. Clearly, he'd been through a lot: his skin was covered in scars, but they were pale. The latest ones were those along his arm. His scent was a mystery. There was something in it, which reminded her of home. What caused that?
Bruce stopped and stared at the tired man hunched over in the chair, bouncing an equally tired pup in his lap. There were bags under his eyes and he was unshaved.
"If I meet your conditions, I want a guarantee that you'll talk to me and answer my questions," he said.
Steve pointed to a black sportscar. The color drew him to the decision. It was the tamest color-wise. The drive was quiet except for the classic rock playing lowly. They stopped on the airstrip. A private jet was waiting for them. Steve took a seat in a cushy leather seat, while Tony spread out on the couch.
“I don’t think it's bad. But it makes for something interesting. He didn’t treat me like a kid,” said Piper.
Tony grunted as he cleaned the wounds. Steve tried not to rush the process. But if he didn’t get this cared for before the next wave, it wouldn’t be treated until his heat was over. Most likely, he wouldn’t come out of his feral state again. He wound the bandages carefully around Tony’s arm. The entire time the alpha’s gaze was focused on him.
“But what I can understand is your mind turning against. And how painful it can be to have the thing that makes you brilliant turn against you."
Tony's heart ached. The life of his mate was in the hands of another. He wanted to be with him. Steve would want him to stay with their daughter. Whatever his worries were he had to save them for another time. The room felt too large. He was alone with his daughter. Her small delicate form was huddled against his chest. Those newly opened blue eyes gazed up at him. They held such a deep fascination, unaware of the turmoil he was forced to endure by being here. Her head fit in his palm. He sired this perfect being. She stole his breath in the most amazing way. Nothing he'd ever created would compare to her. Her tiny hand wrapped around his finger. Tear sprung from his eyes. He kissed her softly on the forehead.
Bruce pulled up to the lavish mansion in the rust bucket of a truck he bought. The gas mileage was horrible, but it got him to where he was going. The front gates opened and he pulled into the driveway. Stark was waiting out front. He was surprised that his appearance did earn some sort of snide comment.
Steve groaned. Sunlight streaming through the blinds forced him awake. He pulled the thin blankets over his head, but there was no blocking it out. A gentle ocean breeze. Outside he heard waves lapping gently against the shore. Tony had taken him to the beach. He walked out into the living area. A large breakfast arrangement had been put out. The fruit smelled amazing. Some fruits set out he’d never seen before. Tony handed him a bowl of fruit salad. He took a seat next to him finally taking a moment to admire the beach view in front of him. The sand was white and the water was crystal clear.
Tony leaned over the edge of the tub. Steve was quick to brace him. He groaned when Tony vomited on him. Steve cringed but rubbed his back.
The pup obeyed slowly, taking deep breaths in out. Her body started to relax. Bloom’s word’s soothing words lead her deeper in to a state of relaxation. Piper’s brow furrowed when Bloom’s gentle word scraped painful against some unforeseen barrier. She wanted to stop!
There was a thud on the roof. Matt was surprised when Steve responded to it as well. How could he hear that?
On learning that Steve was coming back, Piper was finally settling down for him. She napped, ate, and played with little fuss. It had taken her nearly five days to accept the idea that Steve was away. He would catch her staring at the elevator door every now and then.
"Sure he isn't," said Clint, rolling his eyes. He laughed when Steve broke eye contact with suddenly more interested in the floor. Steve was acting like a kid with a crush. It was oddly cute. If it were anyone else it wouldn't work. For his age, Steve had so little experience in this area.
Steve blinked away the brief feral haze. He’d rarely called Tony by such a title. His inner omega wanted to call upon his alpha's natural urge to protect.
The fear and adrenaline from Piper’s shock leached away, leaving her exhausted. She was too distrustful of her surroundings to sleep. Her parents told her to run as far and as fast as she could if she ever encountered a feral alpha. That wasn’t an option. She needed someone on her side and he was all she had to work with. It was easier to focus on him than think about her situation.
“I can’t say I fully understand what you're going through. I won't lie to you. There's only one person here who can claim that, but I can listen. I will always listen, Piper, even if I don't like what you have to say."
“Peggy kept all old your inventions. Some of them still worked. Saw your toaster gun. You were quite a little firebug as a toddler,” said Steve.
“It worked on the simulations. I’m willing to use it on my mate that should be enough for you, Hill,” said Tony.
He changed and joined Steve. Steve sat by the fire warm light flickered over him. Tony froze when the omega sent a gentle smile in his direction. He tensed when At Last started playing:
“If you ever go rabid, remember Kevin was the one who hit you.” He strapped her to the examination table. It would be a few hours until their cell would be ready.
She wanted to take him with her. Her chances of escaping were less than 1%. And that was the generous estimate. Adding him in brought it down to zero. He was unstable outside of his given setting.
“None yet.” Honestly, he’d forgotten about. They just had a moment to clear their heads and relax after on the drama.
Tony didn’t want to tell Steve about the flash drive yet, not until he was sure he had something. He didn’t want to get either of their hopes up only to be let down again. If there were nothing only he’d be let down.
"Liking his voice doesn't mean I have a crush. It provided a soothing tone in a time of chaos. It was impressive for a civilian,” said Steve.
Tony was quiet. When he went to leave to caught him. Metal fingers gently wiped away his tears. “I love you, Steve."
Steve went to his room. He needed a shower. Steve went into the bathroom. The walls of the bathroom black and the counters were white marble. The fixtures were black or steel. One of the walls were glass, so a person could look out on the city from the tub. In the corner was a large glass steam shower.
He waved at them. She growled, flashing her teeth. She was stunned when he returned the gesture. It actually earned him some modicum of respect with Piper. She was sure Dr. Bloom had told him what she did. Most would be scared. His response was honest. It was how any grown-up omega would respond to a pup baring their teeth at them.
Steve joined her on the couch. He placed the infant pup in her arms. Piper had Steve’s gentle eyes, but she had her father's inquisitive gaze.
Rune stared at the man. That's all he wanted? And he was asking instead of just taking what he wanted. It was weird but a good weird.
"Oh, Steve sorry I've been processing all the new data from the Incident. This isn't even my field of expertise!" she growled.
Tony ran his fingers through his hair. He hated this. If he was there he could have stopped Steve from leaving the shelter of their den.
Carl became lost in the excitement, accidentally running into a woman, spilling his chocolate ice cream all over her white shirt. His dad ran quickly to his side.
Tony and Steve came clean all that had happened in Antarctica. To his credit, Dr. Wong kept a straight face.
She was brought to the classroom. Instead of the one lone child's desk at the center of the room, there were two. The other one was slightly bigger than hers. Two child-sized easels were placed at the front of the classroom with a fresh box of crayons. The door opened again and Rune entered, surprised. Neither had expected to see the other so soon.
Tony could handle himself against whatever that thing was. Steve joined up with Clint and Natasha, taking cover by a cab.
"No idea," said Piper. Something had caused a high level of panic. Too often had her hopes been crushed here for her to believe that it was good news.
“December is the anniversary of his parents' death is coming up. The holidays are always difficult for him,” said Peggy.
What did it stand for? Why were those letters of such importance that he’d carve them there? He pushed his hand into his pocket, not wanting to focus on what may be forever unknown. He traced over the splinter cracks in the glass. Feeling the camera in the perched in the corner, zooming on him as he did.
Seconds seemed to slow. Cold iron wrapped around him, lengthening to accommodate his growing stomach. His eyes were locked on his mate.
“I know you hate it, but we’ll bring things for you do. Maybe those books Uncle Bruce got you. And once I’m done we’ll go get hot chocolate,” said Steve.
“The crazy extents I’m willing to go to for my patients. But I was expecting something different,” he said.
“Thank you!” It was a Lego Ferrari F40. Daddy had bought her several of these. She would rip open the bags inside and dump the on floor then put them together without the instructions.
Stark having a mate would make him more manageable. If things worked out between the two, the end result could be something amazing. A child with Stark’s brains and Captain America’s physical ability created naturally. Fury smirked at picturing the womanizer known as Tony Stark, a dad. It was unlikely to happen unless by accident.
Steve woke late the next morning. His mind caught in the dense haze between awake and asleep. There was no rush to wake up.
Steve’s heat coiled form relaxed at the feeling of the alpha's chest behind him. Purring as those tender lips sucked, kissed, and nipped at his skin. Tony’s hand traveled past his stomach. His back arched, panting desperately at the touch. He thrust frantically into the alpha’s hand, trying to get more friction. The alpha's hands were working him so perfectly. He fisted the sheets as he came yet again. The release did nothing to relieve the consuming need. Tony gently turned him on his back.
Natasha took a small field computer from her pack. She plugged the binoculars into it. The images caught in the lenses were run through the S.H.I.E.L.D database. “Hm, doesn’t look like anything high level. Some low-level mercenaries."
Once they finished with the prep, they put everything in the pot and put it on a low simmer. They found their way back to the couch with a large bowl of popcorn. Playing the movie from where Jarvis paused it. Steve was pressed snugly to Tony by the end of the movie. A bowl of popcorn rested on the ground.
His hair looked like it hadn’t been cut for years. Same for the beard. When they finished their meal Theodore wiped the jam from her face.
“She’s done nothing to garter attention, sure. I’ve already sent the general analysis she’s taken to Bruce,” said Jarvis.
He swung barbell but she grabbed it mid-motion and tried to pull it from him. A game of tug-o-war started, neither of them willing to yield. The metal bar cracked, succumbing to that massive strain. They tumbled backward at the sudden give, both still holding a broken end.
Lena returned the observing room. She activated the rabbit. Piper's stats appeared on the monitor. The stuffed animal watched not her vitals, but rather picked up on her hormonal shifts. Secretary Pierce’s image appeared on the monitor.
She sat on the bottom step, watching them work. Watching them work was soothing even though she was the subject of interest. She’d always loved watching Daddy work. Often, she’d fall asleep watching him, trying to predict what he was making.
Tony gestured to a black leather couch behind him. Steve settled there. He watched as the man work. The alpha was so intent on his work as if everything else had fallen away. He wished someone would look at him with the same intensity. Steve sighed. That meant finding another alpha that could tolerate his scent. His omega was set on Tony. Stark could satisfy his urges. The thought was enough to make him slick. Tony's shoulders tensed in reaction. He needed a distraction. There was a pad of yellow paper on the coffee table. He sketched out alpha once done; he drifted asleep.
Steve quickly wiped them away. His chest grew damp. Piper licked her lips and whined. He took her to his chest, gasping when she latched. Steve purred.
“Seeing still working on believing. Where’s Banner? Has he shown up yet?” said Tony as flew next to the giant beast.
“Remember, you can’t have raw fish, deli meat, high mercury fish, or unpasteurized dairy products, and absolutely no alcohol,” said Edith. Steve nodded. “Oh, and you should know, it’s perfectly safe to have sex while pregnant,” she said.
"If you ever get a chance to get out, don't wait for me." Winter knew he would be sent to retrieve her. And he’d have to follow through on the
Piper didn't want to cry again, so she forced them back. She dragged the mattress over the drawing. Hiding them was one less reason for her to cry. She picked up a red crayon and started sketching out a diagram of Theodore’s arm. Piper focused all of her attention on it.
Steve joined him, quickly closing the distance between them. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve. He bringing him close, breathing in that honey vanilla scent. His hickey already left his pale skin. He had to repair that before going to sleep. He gently sucked a new mark on Steve’s neck, causing him to gasp.
Those metal hands were amazing against his heated skin. He purred as those deft fingers worked into his tired aching muscles. Steve moaned. Slick dampened his undergarments.
"They are with me. They've all been thoroughly vetted by S.H.I.E.L.D. and approved by Natasha. Introduce yourselves, ladies," said Edith.
"Don't be; he got what he wanted. He got to be with his family again. The man never planned on surviving. He was happy, that’s all that mattered."
"A few weeks after she went missing. I knew we would find her and that we’d need somewhere private for her to recover. We'll be safe there," assured Tony.
Steve nodded guilt still heavy in his expression. He took a shaky breath. Tony gave his hand a comforting squeeze.
As the alpha walked to shower he couldn’t stop his gaze from lowering. He loved the man’s powerful back. Steve went into the living room, gathering their ripped clothes. He tossed them into the trash. He still couldn't believe he did that. It was so unlike him. He took his sweater from the floor. The woolen fabric smelled of him and Tony. He pulled it over it his head. Steve settled by the fireplace. Tony finished his shower thirty minutes later. He looked at the bite mark on the alpha's shoulder. Wishing he marked Tony's neck instead.
Tony glared into those blue eyes. They pleaded with him to stay. He shook off Steve’s grip. “You going to stop me?” he asked.
She tossed open the trunk, pulling out a large deep green blanket. Woven into the fabric in golden script was the Asgardian alphabet. She wrapped herself in the large blanket. The fabric was so soft she couldn’t help rubbing her cheek against it. Green wasn’t her favorite color, but the softness and beauty of the pattern made up for it. She stuffed the blanket back in the trunk, dragging it into the shelter of her room.
He was exhausted. All he wanted to do was huddle up in bed with his alpha and sleep. Pepper took a bottle of mouth wash from her purse.
Rune settled back into the blankets. How could Piper not trust her papa? He smelled safe, and he was sweet. Even though he’d been tricked by that cover before, he lacked that bad feeling from the omega. It was the same with Piper's daddy even though Rune was more careful around other alphas. Uncle Tony's scent was sharp and dangerous but mellow to not be stressing.
"Pressuring me to pee isn't going to make it happen any sooner," said Steve. Them being just outside the door wasn't helping with his stress level. He finally managed to pee. Steve washed his hands, splashing some water on his face. He set the test on the kitchen counter. They watched as came up positive again.
Pepper moved toward the door. Rune raised his head from Pepper's shoulder. "Uncle Steve, Uncle Tony, she won't come if you wait for her there."
The nurse was likely placed there to keep an eye on him. He wanted space. Steve closed and locked the door to his room. He curled up in a tight ball in. Tears wetted his skin. He screamed into his pillow until his voice went hoarse. He was too wired to attempt sleeping.
"Okay I'm on it, I'll have security lock it down. If we need to we can have F32s in thirty seconds. Thank you, Colonel."
Winter was shackled onto a stretcher and loaded into the helicopter. There was a brief moment of warmth before he was thrown into the cold again. A familiar artificial frost climbed up his body. Winter closed his eyes, giving in to the cold. The frozen sleep granting protection for his newest memories.
He slowly sat up. Tony’s arm was lazily thrown across his waist. He was in a deep sleep and wasn't showing any signs of waking up. Steve pressed a gentle kiss on the alpha’s temple. His scent clung to Tony’s skin. Smiling at the fact that the alpha smelled strongly of him. He carefully moved Tony’s arm from his waist and moved from the nest, collapsing seconds later. His legs felt like limp noodles. He was actually sore. That took some real effort on Tony’s part.
To lessen the chance of being crowded by the press he went to a grocery store in Queens. Tony got out of his suit. It folded back into a suitcase. He put it in a grocery cart. As he walked through the aisles many looks were sent in his direction. He looked over Steve's list:
“By this stage in my career, I’d hoped to be doing more than babysitting a mental patient and a kid genius,” said Kevin.
“My boyfriend is having an episode. How do you expect me to be calm?! Tell me what the fuck to do!” snarled Tony.
“That." Same result. “Trust me you’re going to be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three, come on! Two."
"I can't say for certain but I assume it will further empower and strengthen the time it takes for her to regenerate. Extremis soldiers recovered from fatal in hours sometimes minutes and could regenerate limbs. If activated she’ll be able to do the same. I doubt it will happen at such a young age,” said Bruce.
"Hello, Steve, it's been a while. It's good to hear from you. Do you need to set up an appointment?" Turner had fully expected Mr. Stark to be the first make contact with after Steve suffered some sort of episode.
"I'm so glad the two of you are okay," said Pepper. She took several steps away from Tony when she saw the claim marks on their necks. "I only stopped by to see if the two of you were okay. And congratulations on the bond. I've already set Stark Industries as clean up for this incident. I'll start working on a plan to disclose your relationship."
I can’t keep doing this forever. I can’t keep us both from falling apart and be strong for Piper. Don't do this."
“She’s six. Anyway, it's limited edition. You should get used to Dora the Explorer. I'm sure you'll be watching plenty of it soon enough," he said.
“That’s his MO, isn’t it? What are we a team? No, no we’re a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We’re a time bomb,” said Bruce.
"I don't mind. It would be best if you were where you're most comfortable. I should get going. I'm sure two have packing to do," said Edith.
She paused at the use of her nickname. Before she could get off the bed, Daddy caught her. She tried pushing out his hold.
It's what she would do if placed in that position as a child. “It depends on how much she wants to get out of it. She’s not an easy child Steve and not the stereotypical way. Piper is aware she’s smart and isn’t afraid to use it to her advantage. That was part of who she was before being kidnapped. Now it’s more present.”
She rubbed her eyes. It was seven; it would be a bit of a challenge, getting her back to sleep, but he was willing to take it on.
He could survive the loss of their relationship, but truly losing Steve was something he wouldn't survive. Steve turned them over. He bent Tony’s gauntlets before the alpha could make another attempt to escape. Now that he caught him he wasn’t letting go.
“Piper, when a person experiences something traumatic it stays with them forever, haunting them. Sometimes it gets so bad a person relives those moments forgetting where they are."
"These only filter out the pregnancy scent. Your scent will start to change in a few days. Maybe less. So it’s important that you wear these," said Edith.
“Is there anything I need to know before it really gets going? I don’t want to do anything that may make you uncomfortable,” said Tony. After last night his urge to protect Steve was undeniable. He couldn't do anything that would potentially harm him. It wouldn’t fade until omega’s heat ended.
Distress was leaking off the omega. It was impossible to think clearly with that smell poisoning the air. Tony climbed into bed with Steve. He circled an arm around Steve, pulling the omega's face toward his neck, running his fingers through the beauty's golden brown hair.
“Why hasn’t she come?” Lena’s lack of appearance made her nervous. She wanted to know the location of a threat.
Steve wove his way through the crowded sidewalks. One of the things he enjoyed about being in the city was that he didn’t stand out in the crowd. When he made it to the park, Steve kept walking until he found an out of the way bench. He watched families pass by. Would he bring his pup here to play? He’d always loved the rare occasions he left Brooklyn with Bucky to come to Central Park. It seemed so big then. Families played in the distance. He wanted that. Steve began sketching his surroundings. At 4:30 pm he started the walk home, making it back to Stark Tower a little after five.
He nodded. Being poked and prodded was something he was used to. The sooner it was over with, the sooner he would be left alone.
He couldn’t protect her here, he could barely do it before, in their cell. His hands fisted. It was the only physical act of rebellion he could manage, and even that was a struggle.
Tony fell asleep again. He spent another twenty minutes in bed just holding the alpha close, studying his features. Steve sunk into the bed, allowing himself to relax. He closed his eyes listening to the breaths of the man he loved.
Kevin twitched. His hand stung, knuckles bleeding, and one of his fingers was clearly broken. He’d only hit the girl once, yet she’d caused him this much damage.
Steve chose Where the Wild Things Are. It was one of Piper's favorites - at least it had been. "May I sit with you?"
“How did you survive?” asked Steve. He tightened his grip on the alpha's hand, afraid he may slip through his fingers.
"Ninety-nine degrees normal. By your temperature, I'm pretty sure you're only having a single pup. Multiples normally cause omegas to run warmer. I won't know for sure until I get an ultrasound. Lay back on the table," she said.
“He’s still in REM sleep. Tony shouldn’t be waking anytime soon. You thoroughly tired him out last night,” said Jarvis.
Tony may not have a clear image, but he did have an artist husband with an excellent memory. He grabbed a sketchpad from his desk and went upstairs. Steve wasn’t in his studio. He pushed open the door to Piper’s room to find Steve laying on their daughter’s bed.
He let Steve sleep. It was only a matter of time until he blew this chance as well. Steve's heat might lean in his favor. If they made it that far.
“Who is just as stressed, tired, and scared as you. Both of you need a break from all this," said Rhodes.
There was no way Steve hadn't seen the news. He checked his phone. No voicemails or calls. Steve wasn't the type to vent his anger over the phone. No, he'd want to do it in person. He slowly pulled into the driveway. Two large twisted balls of brightly colored metal were displayed in the driveway. On closer inspection, he realized mangled heaps of metal were formally his Audia R8 and R8 Spyder.
They nuzzled. Tony coiled protectively around him. Steve savored the perfection. So protected so at ease. These had never been feelings he had during heat. He was safe. It took thirty minutes for the alpha to calm.
“Did her parents hire you? I could see Stark stooping to hiring mercenary, but I didn’t think Mr. Goody Too Shoes would allow it. I’ll tell you where she is if you let her go.” The knife-wielding alpha remained quiet.
"Its summer. No one has class," said Steve. He regretted saying that because it seemed to only stress the pups. They needed some level of order and schedule. "We'll figure out something to do. We can go swimming. Does that sound fun?"
“You don’t know that for sure,” Lena pressed, “What if you lose control and hurt him? It’s a likely possibility, and you know that.”
Instead of steering him toward the bed, Tony moved him to the shower. He turned on the hot water, letting the glass steam as they shed their clothes. Doing their best, they washed away the heavy strain they carried. Each gentle caress was a reassurance to the other.
Jarvis had pulled up the names of scientists working on similar projects, but their work didn't compare. It was basic and practical, limited by budget and not meant for warfare. The one that came closest was Rand Enterprises, but they were still testing prototypes. He had asked Natasha to check her more underground sources. They were currently waiting for her response.
Steve straddled his lap. His omega’s scent changed. The stress of the moment triggered Steve's heat fully. The ten surviving men were repelling down the elevator shaft.
He scooped her up into his human arm, then put her down in the corner. The chemical stench was agitating him. The cell no longer smelled like his territory. He rubbed himself against the walls, trying to make it smell more like his own. He returned to the corner, taking the pup in his arms again. Winter cradled her to his chest. His scent had to better than bleach.
"But you'll be able to take this with you, anywhere you want." Lena placed an iPad on her desk. Piper didn't touch it. Was this some kind of trick? Was she really being given a piece of tech?
By the time Steve was satisfied with the painting, it was one in the morning. His hands and clothes were stained with paint. He washed his brushes and went to the bedroom. Piper was tucked in her dad's arms. His inner omega refused to allow him to join them. He went to the couch. From there, he could look out on the city. Sleep proved elusive. The room was silent, protected from the sound of the city that never sleeps. All he could hear was the quiet breathing of mate and child from the other room. He moved to the floor, finding it more comfortable. Sleep eventually came.
He searched for injuries. Finding yellowish tinges on her skin, the fading marks of something more serious.
“I believe he doesn’t want to interfere or cause me difficulties by visiting. He thinks he’ll cause me pain by reminding me of what could have been,” she said.
It was secure here. Memories of last night came flooding back, causing him to slick. Tony moved his sleep. No, they both need time to recover after the previous night's activities. The growing warmth under his skin could be ignored for now.
Soon he was happily curled against Tony's side, his head resting on the alpha's chest. He purred as callused fingers traveled through his hair. The position allowed him to scent the alpha’s neck. Steve sighed, breathing in deeply the earthy clove scent of the alpha. He couldn’t pick up on another omega. Tony turned, so they were facing. Steve closed his eyes, waiting for their lips to meet. Tony’s breath brushed against his lips.
He wasn't of the sleepless nights that came with a baby. The battle had taken its toll. How much so he couldn't tell yet.  He'd seen the fearful expression crossing Tony's expression, moments before he fell asleep.
Piper groaned, fully awake. She felt better. A staff member came in. It was a female beta, but a new face, even though it was hidden by a surgical mask. Maybe she was part of the staff taking care of Rune. Along with food, the woman brought her clothes. How did the woman expect her to eat when she was locked up in a crib?
“Yes, I refurbished her myself. I doubt she’s as fancy as anything your daddy has though,” Barny laughed.
He raised his shield. If anything came at them he could handle it best. Clint and Natasha nodded in agreement. They slowly worked their way through. All there was old food rations and other boxes.
“The poor girl,” said Pepper. She looked at a photo of the girl. Catalina couldn't be much older than eighteen. She was beautiful. There were noticeable similarities between her and Rune. Rune had her thick wavy hair and complexion.
"Let's say you get out of here somehow. Do you think people will accept you now, Piper? You said it yourself, you're a monster."
Steve nodded but didn’t face him. He ran his hand down Steve's back. The painting was in its early stages, yet revealed a great deal. A frail being was curled tightly in the fetal position in a pool of red, facing the viewer. What could be seen of the subject's expression revealed the heavy sadness and fear of the moment, which would become more powerful as Steve added further detail. A hand was placed protectively over the subject’s stomach. Tony the exact moment in Steve's life the image depicted.
It was impossible to predict how Piper would react, but Steve was cautiously hopeful. The only people she’d shown any real level of distrust toward were he and Tony. But he was going to bring a stranger. She'd hardly spoken of what happened while she was gone, and he wasn't going to press the subject.
Steve didn't get a single phone call that day. He couldn't call home himself. This was something he had to get used to this. He would have to go on assignments, so both he and Piper would have to adjust. Steve tucked his phone into his back pocket.
“Steve, you’re dating Tony Stark there will be issues. The honeymoon phase doesn’t last forever. You will have a fight or something will. Whatever the result is it will show the merits of your relationship,” said Natasha.
Rune came over to her and hugged her. The boy was only mimicking Piper’s actions. Natasha greeted Piper's parents, knowing they’d have to talk, but it was about Piper for now. Natasha waited for a moment alone. It came when Piper wanted to show Nat her bedroom.
Steve closed the visor before speeding off. Tony waved goodbye. Would a motorcycle be too big a gift Steve’s Christmas present? Tony shrugged. That’s if whatever this heavenly arrangement lasted that long.
Jarvis had already started a fresh pot off coffee. It had become the majority of their diet. He'd lost his appetite. Steve glared at the fruit bowl on the counter. He took an apple, managing only a small bite before abandoning it on the counter in favor of checking on his mate.
“Steve and pup will be fine,” said Rhodes. He had no idea if that were true. But Steve survived worse.
"Can't afford it I can do a great deal over my Stark Pad. It's completely secure and I'll be able to run all simulations I need. Besides, I only need to visit toward the end of each of your terms. Things may get messy if I stay longer. That's the last thing we need," said Bruce.
Distress leaked through his bond with Steve. It knocked the air out of his lungs. He only ever felt this when Steve was verging on a panic attack. Shit, he wasn’t there to help his mate through this. He should have been there in the first place and now he was placing an unnecessary burden on his mate and their unborn pup.
An agent dropped off some clothing. The pups still smelled of that horrible place. It would do them both good to wash.
She was covered in blood. They hadn't even bothered to wash the girl. IVs were connected to her. He unstrapped her restraints, carefully taking the pup into his functioning arm. Winter undressed her, throwing away the bloodied, ruined clothes. He placed her in a tub, washing away the dried blood. He'd expected to find bruising, but there was nothing. She'd been stabbed and there wasn't a scar.
“Let that go. He forgave you. You can move on from that. Tony wouldn’t want you to linger on. If you want to be sure we can call him. And you or I could ask him. Whatever makes you feel most comfortable."
Steve woke at six in the morning. Last night Tony had tossed and turned in his sleep, jabbing him in the ribs until he finally woke up and held him in his arms. He kissed Tony’s temple. He went to the gym. None of the equipment could handle his strength or posed a challenge to him. He did several hundred pull up, push up, and sit-ups. Steve showered in the guest bedroom so he wouldn’t wake up Tony. When he got out Tony was in the kitchen.
"I was a fool to believe such an organization had been brought down. They found a way to survive," said Steve.
It was chilling how much she sounded like Steve at the moment. Tony took a breath. The wound had already closed. She yawned.
“Bravo.” She was bit shaky, but she’d gotten task done. He’d been expecting more a challenge. The pup growled.
Winter strained against the battering falling down on him. Trying so desperately to comply with her pleas, only for his body to fail him. He fought against the constraints of his mind. Tried to will his body to follow his own command, or at least obey the order of another worthy of its control.
Winter had paced their room for hours now. The only disruption came when a beta dropped off several large stacks of books. It had never taken this long for Piper to return. The rigidness left his form when he heard small familiar footsteps coming down the halls.
The idea was unappealing but he needed to store up calories so he could be ready for his alpha. He made several peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. From the fridge, he took two water bottles. Being this lethargic was so new to him. Before the serum, he was always on high alert and found it impossible to sleep. He managed to eat half of what he made before finally decided he was done. Then put the rest in the fridge. He went to their bedroom, crawling into his nest. He nuzzled Tony’s pillow, deeply breathing in the alpha's scent.  He hugged the pillow close to his chest. It wasn’t the same as holding his alpha, but it was the closest thing he had. He closed his eyes.
Lena arrived home late. It was one in the morning. She pulled the spare key from under the doormat and fit it into the lock. The door squeaked open to the home they shared with Helmut's parents. It was an old cottage that had been added onto and upgraded over the years. She dropped the key into the bowl near the door.
"Sorry, I don't know what brought that on." Steve cracked his knuckles, trying to return to their previous calm. But couldn't. It took longer to recover any perceived panic, while in or nearing heat. He was vaguely aware of Tony inching closer to him. First, the alpha's hand was running up and down his arm, slowly moving further upward. He slumped into the alpha when he started stroking under his chin.
“Like Christmas but with more me!” Tony exclaimed. He smiled when Steve's soft laugh came over the line.
They hadn’t published the information; it would be too much attention even if positive. Piper’s intelligence made her a bigger target, so Steve and Tony kept her out of the spotlight as much as possible. That didn’t stop the paparazzi from trying to nab Piper’s picture. Steve almost lost it when some desperate reporter crashed a family picnic, huge camera in hand. It scared Piper! She was too young to understand the greedy clicks and sharp flashes. Keeping Piper calm was the only thing that kept Steve from attacking. Fortunately, for everyone’s safety, most of the press was respectful.
He made room for Steve in the small hospital bed. Steve lay next to him. They were both too tired and too in need of each other to be angry.
He brought Steve into his arms. The omega hid his face in his neck. He ran his hands down Steve's back, earning a soft purr.
“You didn’t," he said. Tony slowly approached, not wanting to frighten him. He took Steve’s hand, placing it over his chest. “See, it's fine."
“Yes, it was awarded to you shortly after your death. The president wanted to make sure you received them,” said Fury.
Everything was out of her control and she could do NOTHING! Why did he have to suffer because of her? It wasn’t right!
Piper snuck quietly down the steps. Daddy was tinkering on one of his suits. Uncle Bruce was at a monitor, examining a DNA helix. Marking segments of it. Was it hers or Rune's? There was no way of telling from here.
He nodded. It was a ten-hour flight. The sooner it was finished the better. Hours later they landed. As soon as he got out he was hit a powerful dry heatwave. They landed in a small flat landed on small ledged that was barely able to fit the quinjet. Orange and brown cliff tops surrounded them. They would have to be careful. Dehydration could strike quickly with little warning if they didn’t watch out for it. They worked their way through dry landscape, each step kicking up dust.
“Isn’t that obvious they want him. They the thought this was an opportune moment to get him,” said Fury.
"That's a bit over your head, Piper. It's easier to just follow your commands. Winter has accepted that."
The others nodded. They swiftly retreated. Steve got a better look at the bears. The mother had lost most of her fur. Its skin had blackened was cracked, oozing green sludge.
“Last night. The packet Selvig’s notes. The extraction theory paper. Am I the only one who did the reading?” said Tony.
“You've watched it over a hundred times, Tony. If there were anything to find, you would have found it by now. All you're doing, now, is torturing yourself."
The coast guard was searching the water underneath his home. His gut told him they wouldn't find Tony. He called upon their bond, hoping for a response. There was none. But the connection was present.
The timbre of his voice sent a shiver down Steve's back. He hit back a moan. "Slick drenched shorts."
The strain of resistance appeared in his expression. There was resistance in his every step, scowl plastered to his expression.
After a peaceful lunch, Piper dragged Tony to the playroom. Steve left Tony to his fate, knowing the alpha enjoyed constructing whatever Lego structures she had in mind.
Those bright blue eyes stared up at him. They held an unconditional love he'd never experienced. It was heart-melting. He would do his best to be worthy of it. Nothing could be in the way of protecting her. The clump of shrapnel in his chest would always pose a risk. Why not remove a risk he controlled.
“Loki’s issues were caused by more than only feeling inferior because of his second gender status. What happened to him?” asked Steve.
He yawned. All he wanted was sleep but the cramping agony coiling down his back put an end to that hope. He whimpered, clenching down the mattress. Steve bit a pillow stopping himself from screaming. His eyes watered as the seconds ticked by.
"Yes, we've gotten all we needed from here," said Tony. They packed up their things and locked up the house. He got into the car. "Have everything?"
His unborn pup was healthy. He didn't need them to tell him that. What he needed was to know his husband was alive. That's all that mattered. She'd survived worse than this. She kicked reassuringly against his hand. He growled when the paramedics tried coming near him again. Flashing his teeth was enough to send them running. Steve sighed. He traced his claim mark. It tingled under the touch. At his feet was an ironman helmet. He struggled to reach it.
“That means a lot,” said Steve. He smiled. Tony had a vast collection of modern and abstract art. He didn’t think his simple landscapes would appeal to Tony’s taste.
Some of the tension left the alpha. He seemed more relaxed in their settings. They enjoyed a quiet lunch.
"Can I touch you?" Steve nodded. He sat down next to him, wrapping an arm around his shivering frame.
Piper had figured out the basic elements of Winter's arm with relatively little education. The complex parts were still unknown to her. It was impressive, but not surprising.
He looked to Natasha. She nodded. The ground shook under their feet. A massive building erupted from the sand. How many places like this did S.H.I.E.L.D. have? A stern, middle-aged woman stepped out. She seemed irritated. Her curly chestnut hair was tied in a ponytail. Her olive skin weathered from years of working in such terrain. She was dressed in lightweight clothes with her arms crossed. Her brown eyes only softening slightly when she spotted Natasha.
Steve knew Tony communicated with the surgeon over the last few weeks, but he didn't believe they were at that level of readiness.
Tony sat up, wanting a closer view. His arms wrapped around Steve, keeping the brutal pace he’d set. He met Steve’s motions with powerful thrusts. Tony connected their lips, pushing his tongue passed the omega’s lips into his sweet, warm mouth. His hand wrapped around Steve, stroking him firmly.
“Maybe, can you stop?” That edging panic was growing uncomfortably near it and the kid wasn’t helping. He took a breath trying to steady himself. “Remember when I told you I have an anxiety issue?”
“Just a little more, sweetheart.' Their fingertips just barely touched. A gleaming orange hand burst through the floor, ripping out the heart of his armor. Tony fell back. Killian emerged.
Tony unbuttoned his shirt, carefully easing it down his shoulders. She stared at the deep bruises marking his chest. The omega quickly took his vital, only touching as much necessary.
“Shh, she could be watching. Do you want to end up like her last tech?” Dr. Zemo had a terrifying reputation. Those who failed to meet her expectations frequently became subjects for her experiments. Almost no one survived. The few that did wished for death.
He picked her up. She immediately went limp against him. He wished he could take whatever she was feeling. He went to the bathroom, placing her gently on the ground, then turned on the spout. She flinched slightly as stray droplets touched her skin.
He tossed her into the air as she giggled, before setting her down. Piper scowled at the cucumbers slices on her plate.
Tony smoothed his hand over Steve’s arm. The omega quivered. Tony grunted, knocked back by a sharp elbow to his side.
“You saw what she did. That was the same glass used to build the Hulk’s cell. She isn’t a child she’s a freak.”
Tony’s knot expanded, locking them together. The sensation triggered another orgasm. Through the waves of pleasure, he vaguely sensed Tony’s seed flooding into him. Tony moved them, so they were resting on their sides. Those strong arms wrapped around him, keeping close. Purring as Tony licked his neck, he pressed further against him, not wanting to risk losing the security he found in the contact.
He followed behind her, keeping a respectful distance from the beta. Winter scowled with he saw the change in their cell. The pup was curled up tightly in a far corner of the cell.
He watched as the man was comically thrown around the room. The alpha managed to strike a dramatic pose before being sent to the ground by a flying ass plate.
Tony jumped out the back after them. Alphas and their egos! Tony was supposed to be smart. This needed be thought through! Steve yanked a parachute from the shelf. Now he had to go after them.
"It's impossible to make this not scary, but you need to put this in terms she can understand. You have the benefit of having a child that can understand how complicated this is. Tell her why you're going through this."
He had no idea on many fronts when it came to the idea daughter. With male omega, alpha, or beta at least he had a gender in common.
Whining broke Tony from his sleep hours later. Steve had thrown off the blankets and was completely bare. The shirt he once wore was tossed on the floor. A sheen of sweat covered his pale skin. He was panting heavily. His scent was even more enticing. Tony licked his lips.
Steve sat up taking the sketchpad. Slowly an image took form under Steve’s deft hand. The task seemed to free him from whatever dark thoughts he was lingering in. An hour later he had a perfect rendering of Winter’s arm.
“Fine.” He pushed the child's nose into his neck, knowing his scent had to be more appealing than the suffocating stench of her own distress. “Relax.” She had to, for both their sakes.
Steve tensed when ‘Ten Rings’ was mentioned. They had kidnapped he and Tony, mutilated his mate, and exposed his unborn daughter to a dangerous chemical. He had a dog in this fight.
At four in the morning his phone rang. He quickly answered, not wanting to wake the sleeping being next to him.
He struck her. She went quiet with surprise, processing the dull pain spreading across her cheek. Blood trickled down the side of her face. Never had she been hit. She cried - mostly out of shock- not knowing how else to react.
“I’ll make the call. Steve and I will want a full explanation of what you did find once pups are put to bed,” he said.
Tony was watching him get breakfast ready. The pups would wake up soon. It was nice having a full house. Pepper and Maria had adapted well and had made their wing of the mansion home. Rune and Piper would often play there. Bruce secluded himself to the lab, making an appearance every now and then.
He kneeled down, so he was at eye level with his omega. The omega’s skin was splattered with blood. His pupils were fully dilated; only a slim ring of light blue was visible. The smell of distress and fear was thick enough for him to smell through his helmet. Steve seemed to forget all of his power. At the moment, he seemed to think he was the omega from before the serum.
“Four hours, if he wakes up try to getting moving. It will help him dilate and move the baby's head into position," said Edith.
Edith would have to report this information to Fury. It wouldn’t take long for Dr. Banner to discover what she had. She could blame her lack of reporting such a discovery on her lack of knowledge on the subject. That would be believable enough. She left the lab.
Aunt Nat stood at the center of the large room, balanced perfectly on her toes. There no quiver of the legs. Classical music echoed through the room. Piper soon became entranced in the elegant movements. It wasn’t only the fluency of her motions, but the physics and math behind them. The sheer amount of pressure balanced on her toes was amazing. It wasn’t some dainty thing, but something that would require both intense mental and physical strength. She hadn’t realized how much she’d really longed for that till now. Piper was brought from her trance when the music stopped playing.
There was something unspoken between the two of them. It was too late now. He took the envelope from his pocket. Now was as good as any time. He took a breath before reading.
Tony rolled his eyes. Oprah tried for years to get an interview with him. Every time he declined. He was sure she would use this as a chance to use some of the questions come up with over the years.
Lighting cracked the dark clouds above them. Thunder roared after each glowing bolt through the sky.
He asked a random beta woman to dance. The hours ticked slowly by and finally, it was time for him to leave.
"Playing chess. But I know I fought. There's proof of that. Why do I remember something I know didn't happen?" There was so much pointing against the chess memory.
Natasha took a breath, calming her excited nerves. The call traced to Antarctica. As much as she wanted to call Steve and Tony to tell she’d discovered their daughter, there was a procedure that had to be followed; first was contacting Agent Hill. Nat dialed SHIELD’s international number, and on the third ring, Hill picked up.
"How bad was the attack? It must have been relatively minor if he's already back on his feet. But it won't hurt to keep an eye on him. From a medical standpoint you have no reason to worry about him," said Edith.
Steve couldn’t get back to sleep. He untangled himself from Tony somehow managing not to wake him up. Steve pulled a blanket over him.
Steve tucked silver orb back into its box. Tony was likey itching to take it apart. Steve carefully folded the blanket, sitting on the counter. He ran his hand over the soft fabric. He was fighting the urge to tuck it into the layers of her nest. He tapped his fingers against the counter. Steve gave in and brought it to his nest.
“Show me.” He looked at the screen. His eyes widened at the assigned user name ‘Pipes’. He touched the screen in disbelief.
He followed Steve open-air bathroom. High wall grantee, no one would see his omega. He joined Steve under the spray.
Rory’s expression was one of shock. He was expecting the perfect Captain America answer, but this was better this was human. Rory didn’t pick at why or who would earn the spite of the hero.
Lena peered at the monitor and was met by Piper’s piercing glare. It was an open challenge to her authority She heard their entire conversation. Lena laughed.
Natasha had arrived a week ago in Sokovia. She wanted some time to study the Zemo family dynamics. Even if their connection to Piper’s disappearance was as slim as it seemed, it was the only lead they had currently. Unless Tony’s research on Winter’s arm came back with anything. She rented an apartment that granted her a view of their property. From what she’d seen so far, they were a relatively normal family, with the exception of Helmut Zemo. He was the current commander of EKO Scorpion, Sokovia’s paramilitary death squad.
“I haven’t had a Christmas for seven decades,” said Steve. He realized his mistake. He caught the heavy sadness in Tony’s gaze, but it lasted only a moment before it was hidden away. The anniversary of his parents was only a little less than a week away. This month must be hell for him. He wouldn't want to celebrate either. “I’m sorry, Tony. I forgot. We don’t have to."
Tony smiled as Steve went lax. He’d worried that Steve might not have one. Normally, it was a certain place on the neck, but it could also be in other places. Pepper’s spot was between her fourth and fifth ribs. Steve’s was just below his belly button. The moment was ruined when Pepper came walking in. Steve’s purrs transformed into a snarl.
Rune went to the tunnel entrance, taking a breath before crawling in. The glow in the dark paint was a comfort. He followed her scent through the maze. Relieved when the tunnel opened up to a mini playroom. Piper was in the corner crying. He sat beside her, not saying anything. She rested her head against his shoulder.
Steve sighed again. He loved Piper more than anything in the world, but he wanted to do more than be at home with her. Following the daily baby routine wasn’t fulfilling anymore, not that he didn't love every intimate moment with her. He just wanted something more.
"You're holding something that happened in the first months we were dating against me? You forgave me! Have I not made it up to you? Shown you how much I care about you."
Hill knew she’d have to somehow explain this Pepper. They’d always wanted a child, preferably an omega or beta. She'd acquired a five years old alpha boy who was super abled. She didn't even know his name, but she'd fallen in love with the child. Hill texted Pepper to say she was fine but wasn't sure exactly when she would be back.
The days passed swiftly. On twentieth Steve woke to a damp spot underneath him. At least this time he could slowly ease into heat instead of being suddenly thrust into it. His alpha was asleep next to him.
“After.” Lena sighed. Her son's favorite animal was based on her lie. They settled down for the first true family meal they'd had in months.
There was only one more thing to take care of. Then they could go back to whatever brand of normal there was after this.
“A stunning woman with dazzling blue eyes and long blond hair. He seemed to form a type after meeting you. She was one of the few people who could handle Howard’s bullshit on a daily basis,” said Peggy.
Gunfire sent them ducking for cover under the bed. Rune covered his ears, trying to block it out. Piper closed her eyes, focusing on the sound. The sound was too rapid in succession to be a handgun. It had to be an automatic weapon. The only people who carried automatic weapons were Sir's men. Gunfire continued without break for some time, and soon the scent of blood invaded their enclosure. They pressed into each other, trying to escape the smell.
Jarvis pulled up the footage from the front door. From a box, Tony pulled out a goldfish in a bag. For the goldfish's sake, he would let the alpha in. He opened the front door. Steve took the box from Tony. Steve silently readied the small fish tank, ignoring the alpha. Once the fish was settled, he turned his attention to his mate.
Tony turned on the news. Arm and Hammer kept going back and forth between the bedroom and laundry room. Steve yawned.
Winter looked back. An omega was on his tail, forcing him into an alley. Their eyes locked. He knew those eyes.
, he even wished Howard was here. Rubbing his life in Howard's face even at this low point would be satisfying Tony got up; he couldn’t stay in this room any longer. The temptation was too much. The last thing he needed was to get blackout drunk. He went to the lab, hoping Bruce had something to distract his mind.
