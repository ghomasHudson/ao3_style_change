With his heartbreaking and his legs feeling weak, Steve swallowed down his scream of frustration. With a trembling voice, he whispered, “I love you too, love…”
“Why can’t we see it now? It’s my building,” Tony whined. “Visiting hours don’t really apply to me.”
Tony looked far from relieved by this news, in fact, he appeared downright upset. He closed his eyes and, with a pained whisper, stated with an eerie certainty, “No, he’s going to die…”
When he didn’t reply, Pepper stuck her head in and, when she saw he was awake, she slipped in the room.  She whispered, “Hey, Tony, you wanna get some lunch?”
He could not see Stark’s expression beyond the flat plate of Iron Man’s mask but Norman laughed either way as he imagined his despair.
“Peter, no!” Steve gasped, grabbing his son the best he could through the mass around them. Peter closed his eyes and leaned back into the writhing black mass. Steve tore at Venom and screamed, the sound tearing his throat, “
It was still years away. Peter was probably going to get his doctorate first and Wade was still establishing his new identity in the superhero community.
Peter shook his head and murmured, “There’s got to be a solution, Dad… There’s got to be. Spider-Man needs to be on the streets. I
Tony jerked to a stop and looked up to one of Jarvis’s camera. He gasped, “Why didn't you say so in the first place! Fury here? He drop off a package or-?”
He sped up the construction to that section in particular so, in a little over a month, he was able to fly his odd little family under the premise of checking on the building status and taking a weekend trip to New York.
“A moment of reflection,” Jarvis advised and stepped back until he disappeared into the shadows. The only clue to his continued observance was the glow of Iron Man’s eyes burning through the darkness.
The fire burned hotter and dug deep into him like thousands of bolts of white hot lightning. He knew this was it, he knew he would not survive.
Natasha asked to help going through the files and Tony gave her access and she started to read. She learned how to work it quickly and was adding to their lists at a fast rate.
His eyes were glowing red and a number of horns jutted from his scalp. On the ends of his hands he had jagged claws. He raised one of those hands and pointed it accusingly at Steve.
“He says it out of love,” Steve told the man beneath him and, to his best friend, replied, “Isn’t that right, jerk?”
They both went home to the Tower with their ties undone, Peter sleeping on Tony’s shoulder, and Steve holding a box of leftovers from the reception. They both paused in the living room. The last time they had been there was before they were married but everything still felt the same.
Tony grinned at him and whispered, “I love you too, you sap. What brought about this sudden declaration of love?”
They grabbed all four of his limbs and lifted him up with loud grunts of exertion. They moved quickly to one of the large tents. They were speaking urgently to him but he still could not understand them. More orange clad bodies were running toward them as the raised voices drew in the rest of the camp.
Jarvis did as he ordered and as soon as the sound stopped, Venom’s tendrils raced back to rejoin Steve.
Upon Steve’s suggestion, Peter looked speculatively at Tony. At first, he seemed to do it only to humor them but as he studied Tony a change came over Peter. He originally had his hip jutted to the side and was tapping his foot but he suddenly straightened and stopped tapping. He squinted his eyes as if to fix his vision and then he opened his eyes so wide his eyes looked like they would pop out of his head. Alarm flooded his features. He wrapped his arms across his chest and his knuckles turned white from the tight grip he had on his arms.
Tony woke to Steve's gentle kiss on his cheek. Tony stretched and cracked open his eyes. Steve was sitting next to him and he lay a comforting hand on Tony's stomach as soon as he opened his eyes. In his other hand, he held a mug of coffee.
Steve stopped in his tracks when he saw such an expression on Natasha’s face. He had never seen Natasha show anything more than feigned interest. Her eyes shot up and focused on him and just as quickly any affection on her face totally disappeared.
It was supposed to be brief, but…he lingered… and then Steve’s hands were in his hair and he was pressing Tony into the wall and Tony’s fingers were spreading across the muscle of Steve’s back and he opened his mouth and...
Tony gave Bucky his space for the rest of the day. He caught up on his lost sleep and then cleaned up his workshop. Jarvis kept him updated on Bucky. Mostly, the man was researching his past. He just did it in various areas of the house like he couldn’t get settled.
Before Steve could give an explanation, the machines came to life with Tony's presence and DUM-E, quickly followed by Butterfingers, raced over to them, chirping in excitement.
Steve grasped his metal hand and his fingers curled into his. In the years since he had lost it, Tony had improved the limb with extreme dexterity and simulated nerve endings…all so he could feel his husband’s touch and hold his hand like he used to.
New York was being devastated by the Chitauri and the council elected to destroy the city with a nuclear missile to save the rest of the planet.
Tony grinned his award winning smile that made the butterflies flutter in Steve’s stomach. Tony asked, “So tonight? After Peter goes to bed?”
Tony rose into the air, angled his body, and then the suit took off at top speeds, racing past the volley of helicopters in seconds.
It was normal for him to recover memories but he was supposed to ignore them. They only hindered the mission if he focused on them and, usually, they never were strong enough to distract him.
!” Steve spat then shot his hand over his mouth as if to catch the words that were already out. Tony looked as if Steve just slapped him and made him feel all the worse.
“Maybe they want to be the only ones with the knowledge?” Peggy countered and that was the final word on the matter as they hurried down the aisle and then found Maria and the others saving their seats for them.
Their winter wedding was glamorous, and the reception was insane but that was to be expected of anything hosted by Tony Stark. All their friends came and the only cameras to record the proceedings were their own since Steve expressly wished no reporters have any part of their wedding. His son, 5-years-old and their ring-bearer, had blast as he ran between the adult’s legs with Harry Osborn. Norman was invited too but had declined to come because of health reasons.
“Oh, I don’t think it likes me,” Wade replied and he coughed, clearing his throat of blood. “I think the number of times it shish-kabobed me shows how it really thinks of me. But I think it’s tolerating me, right
With his eyes still half open, Tony considered his soulmate’s words and the fear he usually felt did not come. He rolled it over in his mind and then lightly caressed his fingertips over Steve’s back in a few strokes as he considered his words.
Under her winter coat, were various weapons hidden but close at hand. She currently had one hand resting on her lap but the other in her pocket, holding a small pistol. She watched the park paths for activity. She surmised it was where her mate would most likely appear.
“He thinks Stark is dead and does not believe us when we tell him otherwise,” the psychiatrist informed him. They both paused and watched the Captain through one-way glass. Captain Rogers sat at an interrogation table, staring blankly at the table’s shiny metal surface.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and murmured, “That was before…” Before Tony confessed his true feelings and Steve did the same. It was before what they shared became personal and no longer fake…Before Tony wished for some privacy with Steve instead of public exposure…
Tony smiled sadly at his newfound friend and replied, “Technically…a few weeks. I kissed him the same day he came out to the world…and last night he tried to kiss me. But he keeps trying to deny anything is happening between us…”
The building was near invincible. The Avengers hunched over the blueprints and tried to figure out a way to get in without alerting Schmidt but were having little success.
The irony of the entire situation was not lost on the symbiote. It seemed he was fated to die if he stayed or left his host.
A week passed and then another. Steve fit into Tony’s life as easily as a puzzle piece and neither noticed the passage of time.
Tony observed, “No one is going to say this isn’t real! I can’t wait to see the pictures! Though I bet a few are going to be too naughty for daytime television,” Tony teased, cupped the back of his head, and rubbed the tip of his nose against Steve’s playfully.
Steve lifted his head and Tony moved his hand with him, ultimately resting his hand on the side of his face. Steve looked at Tony with sad and confused eyes. It looked worse with the shower water running down his face, imitating tears.
. They would debate constantly about the Avengers, politics, fighting styles, or who’s turn it was to do the dishes, but it hardly turned hostile or ugly.
Bucky’s steps faltered as he realized Steve wasn’t going to the Commandos’ area. He quickly returned to Steve’s side and said, “Ummmm, where are you going?”
. It was...it was where his new family was...but he didn’t know how to tell Tony this without it sounding like he meant more.
Tony awkwardly pulled away from Steve. Steve’s arms shot away from him. Steve rubbed the wetness out of his eyes and avoided Tony’s gaze.
Steve sat on his bed with a groan. He rubbed his aching legs and replied, “Bucky said he does better with me around. He remembers the good times more than the bad. And being around Natasha seems to bringing out the bad memories.”
“Right away, Sir,” Jarvis replied to Tony’s unspoken command and the television flickered to life. Music started to play and the familiar symbol of the multi-tiered castle of the Walt Disney Company appeared. Hulk focused on the screen and his shoulders relaxed.
Tony stared at Steve with shock. He eventually managed to garble, “R-Really?”  Before his hopes were dashed, he asked, “Like fake couple or real couple?”
Peter reached the door, looked at the two figures stepping out of the elevator, and his brain short-circuited. Peter’s legs gave out beneath him and absolute shock numbed all his senses.
“American Made? Hell yeah,” Tony replied with a smirk and Steve ducked his head to hide his automatic blush. Ever since yesterday, every time he looked at it, he remembered how it got there and it seemed a flush instantly stained his face.
. Peter was attracted to Wade but he also had self-control… or, at least he thought he did… Peter scratched the back of his neck, rubbing away a strange sensation.
“Yes, Pete,” Bucky sighed. “And I want you two to know it just in case someone uses the trigger words on me around either of you. But that is the only time you are allowed to use it. Don’t listen to Tony, this isn’t to be used as a prank.”
“I got it,” Bruce murmured and grabbed the nurse’s cart from the corner of the room. He dragged it over to Tony’s bedside and grabbed the intravenous needle from where it was hanging uselessly and dripping its precious contents onto the floor. As he searched the cart for a cleaning solution, Peter peeked from behind Tony’s torso and watched Bruce work.
He followed the footprints, planning dark revenge on Cap’s behalf. He trailed the footprints and knew they would lead him to where Cap had passed.
“Why did you take Peter?” Steve growled to Loki. He bounced Peter softly as he began to hiccup. Even with his body brimming with anger, Steve handled his son with the gentlest of touches.
Tony monitored the rumor. It hit the internet first. Starting in unknown blogs and eventually spreading to reputable news sources. The gossip rags speculated it for a few weeks until an undisclosed SHIELD source stepped forward and confirmed that there was a toddler living in Avenger’s Tower who was related to one of the team members.
He groaned and collapsed as a fresh wave of pain rushed through his body. Tony’s head snapped up and he hovered worriedly over Steve. He lightly pushed Steve back into the bed and gasped, “
May nodded and Steve had to pinch back tears of his own. He could not believe they so easily trusted him and believed in him.
“Listen guys,” Pepper said with a sigh. “The stark truth of it is, you need to be more than friends by the end of the week if you want Stark Enterprises to stay afloat.”
It was the faint smell of coffee that roused Tony and he crawled out of his tent with disheveled hair and a grumpy frown.
Carter!” Howard gasped. They’d called each other every once in a while, but he hadn’t seen her in years. Howard stood and exclaimed, “Look at you! You’ve barely aged! If I wasn’t married…”
Wade loudly cursed as the Goblin grabbed his arm and then ripped it from his socket in a showering arc of blood. Steve screamed Wade’s name and then slammed into the Goblin like a football running back. The Goblin went flying across the field and began to shrink.
Iron Man landed next to him a moment later and his face shield popped open. Tony snarled at the detective, “He just saved
May’s home was only 13 miles from the Tower and it only took him minutes to reach the location in his suit.
“Sorry,” he whispered. He turned toward the elevator and asked Peter, “So Animal Crackers? Which animal is the tastiest?”
“Steve thought they killed me, and they drugged him, with who knows what, to knock him out and kidnapped him!! They could be doing God only knows what they’re doing to him! I am not leaving him with SHIELD!”
“I don’t want to hear “sir” from you either, Bucky,” Tony commanded, moving on to removing the wires and unlatching the bars keeping him upright.
Peter pulled out the shield and tested out its telepathic capabilities. He had the beaker sitting on his lap as he let the mass lazily circle around him. It was cathartic.
“Reporters, screaming fans, etc. The public is going to want a glimpse of their long-lost Captain,” she replied. Natasha was to be his SHIELD liaison and keep an eye on him but her cover was that of his public relations assistant. She was currently on her phone answering e-mails ranging from senators to the local news stations.
Tony was actively pursuing him. He didn’t want the chemistry between them to fizzle out. He was interested in Steve!
Steve gulped back his nauseous revulsion at the thought and took a deep, steadying breath to calm his already frayed nerves.
Silence fell between them and Steve watched Tony as he drank from his coffee and halfheartedly tapped at his holograms.
He inhaled deeply taking in Steve’s pure scent. Beneath the cotton smell left by his shirts, he smelt the salty tang of the gym, the leather of his uniform, and the crisp scent that was innately Steve. A wave of ease washed over him. Steve was all around him, his warmth, his scent, his touch… He was everything to Tony and he probably did not know how safe he made him feel. It was one hundred times better than the allure of scotch.
“T-Tony?” Steve gasped, staring intently at his husband. His armor had been crushed all over his body. A gauntlet had been torn off one hand and the flesh revealed was bloody. His helmet was gone and his face was battered and bruised. His reactor still glowed but…
When the deli closed and the sky turned red with the end of the day, Steve left Brooklyn with a heavy heart.
Peter could barely keep his eyes on his webslinging as his eyes were drawn to Wade. He couldn’t see Wade’s face but his laughter was just as alluring as his smile.
Tony wasn’t sure how to remove Bucky nor exactly how’d he react to being removed from his frozen sleepaway. So, he moved the entire thing. The Mark 17 was larger And stronger than the other units so, once he got the container away from all the boxes leaning on it, he had no problem moving the bulky machine.
they still are there,” Tony reasoned. “We always scanned for them in the past and they still managed to get pictures of us without our knowing.” During the summer months, the Avengers always came to the mansion to relax and the paparazzi constantly managed to get pictures of them in their swimsuits to sell to celebrity gossip magazines.
“They’re in the pipes, Chewie. The fireworks distract people, make them look up, and the aliens come out and sink into your skin,” Solo murmured.
Steve nodded again, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth. He clenched his fists, wishing for the weight of his shield in his hands.
Steve realized his hand still rested in Tony’s hair and then drew away. Tony moved with him, trying to keep Steve’s touch with him a little longer. He stared at Steve with large, shocked, and disbelieving eyes and appeared completely captivated by him. His words were definitely having an impact.
Steve helped Tony with his bandages and he bit down on his lip every time Tony flinched from Steve applying too much pressure to his sensitive skin. His heart hurt from inflicting pain on Tony...but his resolve grew.
Tony removed the family photo from the wall and they both huddled over it. He and Steve stood together with a young man with a cap and gown. He was about Tony’s height with brown hair and a joyful smile.
They moved Steve to a new room and Tony went with him. He watched him as his head bobbed lightly as the bed was moved. As soon as they reached the new room, Tony sat down next to him and stubbornly continued his watch.
Before the couple reached him, however, Pops got to him first and enfolded him into his strong arms.
Steve leaned forward and quickly skimmed through the article about a would-be-hero stopping a mugger and then turning into a monster.
Steve’s smile widened and he even snorted. Steve shook his head, still smiling, and Tony felt victorious.
It didn’t help that the first time he had ever traveled by ship was when he and Peter had jumped onto Thanos’ ship and then promptly lost his then teenaged son to the dusting.
“Nothing happened,” Steve assured the former SHIELD agents as soon as they pulled away in an unmarked van. They promised him that someone would come by later to pick up his bike and he trusted their word. He needed answers but also had to set the record straight.
A beat of frustration rolled through Steve but he did not let it show. Instead, Steve clapped Bucky’s arm and said, “Thanks, Buck…We got any POW’s here?”
Steve winced and said, “Please, don’t let Tony know. You can do all the digging you want just…just keep quiet about it…”
Tony dropped his head and stared at his hands as he said, "That a day hasn't gone by since he was born, when I haven't thought about him...Even when I was in the hands of the Ten Rings, and thought I was going to die, I was thinking of him and the man he'd be.... I told myself, when I got out, that I'd find him and tell him everything. But I was too much of a coward to follow through." Tony sighed heavily and continued, "...And I wish I had fought for him...and I had helped raise him...It will always be the biggest regret in my life.
“It’s – we’re done?” Steve gasped, amazed by the fluidity of the hearing. He expected to be there longer than a few minutes.
“You weren’t far from the mark,” Peter retorted darkly. He quickly explained, “When I texted May last night, I may have neglected to mention that you were going to be here. So seeing you practically having sex with me may have been a little shocking… especially since I haven’t told her we’re dating… or I’m bi…”
Without him meaning to, a small smile tugged at Tony's lips. The merc was wise in not bringing it up with Tony sitting right next to him.
“Master Parker, may I inquire what it is you are doing?” Jarvis asked via the speakers in phone. Peter twitched. He had factored everything but Jarvis. His first mission was foiled before it even began, what would Aunt Tasha say?
. That was the only thing that really mattered in the end. They loved each other. He murmured, “I know right now I’m not ready but…one day…” He looked to Peter again and stayed with more conviction, “I will be with him for the rest of my life and that will entail letting the world know about us. So, yes, one day, but for now I’m content hogging him all to himself.”
He turned his hand beneath Wade’s and threaded his fingers between the rough fingers of the merc’s. In the darkness, he smiled widely to himself as that thrilling feeling shot up his spine again.
Tony nodded and sprinted to his workshop. Bucky didn’t move but watched him go with a forlorn expression.
Steve fell to his knees and stared blankly at the phone in his hands. The phone screen went black from no longer being used. It was his final connection to Tony and was now totally severed. He gasped, “He’s drowning.”
“T-Tony?” He gasped, resurfacing in the present with a jolt. For a few seconds, he was back in the crashed plane and drowning in the cold.
He shoved it on to his own hand and glared across the field at the hero’s ambling to their feet. He hissed, “Two can play at that game.”
“Oh my God,” Tony gasped. He’d never seen Steve so injured or so pale. He was unconscious and Tony desperately whispered to him, “Steve? Steve, baby, wake up.”
They both gasped for breath but continued to stare, neither willing to break eye contact…neither willing to stop sharing their silent vow of love.
“But why were so adamant that I didn’t see you and how the heck did you jump like that?? You were like a rabbit on steroids!”
Tony cocked his head in question and Steve chickened out. He could brave everything Hydra had thrown at him but facing another rejection from Tony scared him to his core. Instead, he said, “Good luck.”
“Bailiff! Remove Ms. Tyler!” The judge ordered. The bailiff ran forward followed by another uniformed court enforcer and they both pulled Tyler away from the lawyers. They dragged her out of the court, kicking and screaming.
Wade's nails dug into his palm and he looked to his boyfriend’s unconscious form. Peter's face was relaxed but there were bags under his eyes and his pale skin looked ominous. They had no idea what that thing was doing to Peter. Venom was never not in contact with Peter and mostly wrapped itself around Peter’s torso like a boa constrictor.
“We brought you here for a myriad of reasons but, mainly, we want to make sure you are alright,” Coulson replied.
"There's no 'probably' to that," Bucky said rolling his eyes. "I'll pick you up, Steve. I promise. Till the end of the line, right?"
It made sense…If Steve knew Tony was about to confess his feelings and change the game plan then he reacted accordingly…it was – but it was totally out of character of Steve.
Both men were scrambling to right their clothes and his dad gasped, “Sorry, Pete! I forgot you were coming back!”
Peter was the opposite. His identities as Peter Parker and Spider-Man both had separate reputations that the press would kill to get info on. Peter had been avoiding the headlines but Wade had been collecting them (he was making a collage with hearts). At first the press had been speculating who Peter was exactly and had made wild assumptions based off the strangest rumors. Eventually, however, after Stark gave his interview and others provided testimonials like professors, classmates, or friends. A picture was being painted of Peter, one that was of an intelligent young man who was making his way into a career as a scientist. In addition to his friendly and charismatic personality, he would be a perfect successor to Stark Industries. They loved him. He was the ideal image of the American male in his prime.
“So much for getting ideas off this,” Steve sighed. Natasha and Bucky’s relationship were vastly different than Steve and Tony’s. He did not think it would have worked but he was glad they still talked about it. It was a piece of Tony he never knew and now knowing it made him love him even more.
Tony raised his hand and pointed his repulsor at the monster’s head. There was no way this was Steve’s friend. Steve said they were so close that they were like brothers. A brother wouldn’t do this. It was an android or a clone and Tony was going to destroy it before it destroyed Steve.
“This way,” the leader stated. “The Captain should be regrouping with the rest of the Commandos in the command post.”
Mary and Coulson both shared similar expressions of uneasiness. Did Peter come here to yell accusations at her?
Tony grasped Steve’s hand and put it over his heart as he whispered, “You know why I’m such a grouch in the mornings? Because I was ripped away from you, my other half…I spend my mornings with your ghost lingering with me in my half awake state and…I’m not fun to be around until I’ve drunk enough coffee to get me out of it…”
He tore his gaze from Tony then unbuckled his cowl as he made his way into the building. The feel of Tony’s breath stayed on his hands and he tenderly ran his fingers over the skin of his palms.
“Adds to the cliché. Promise not to leave me for a dream job in another city? Or have some deep dark secret that can possibly break us up?”
The gold coloring was a little much compared to the Mark II’s more muted silver. Tony observed, “Little ostentatious, don’t you think?”
“We’re not done yet, lover boy,” Tony chuckled. “And don’t think you did nothing for me…Being able to hold you like this and touch you like this…” Tony flexed his hips, rubbing his erection into Steve’s penis, making Steve moan. Tony bit down on his lip and huffed, “This is the stuff of dreams and we haven’t even gotten to the fun part yet.”
Clint was right behind Steve and hit them with enough force to make both of them stager. Clint wrapped his arms around both of them and buried his face into Coulson’s shoulder.
Peter raised his arms over his head and wound them behind Wade’s neck, pressing their bodies closely together. He pulled Wade’s head forward and huskily whispered into his ear, “Jello Prince more like it.”
Steve rubbed his forehead then looked up to his son. He said, “Peter, you don’t have to do anything. It is very nice that you want to help your aunt and uncle but you might upset Auntie Nat very much and I don’t want anything to ruin the relationship you two have.”
Schmidt’s henchmen came in and grabbed him like they always did for his beatings. Steve kept his head raised to defiantly meet the Red Skull’s gaze.
Tony’s hand squeezed his thigh and he whispered, “I would very much like to get some practicing in. Right now is fine by me.”
All Steve had was his strength and his strength had failed Peter when he needed him most. He did not have the technological resources like Tony did to find him and he did not have the biological knowhow that Bruce would use in trying to cure Peter of this symbiote.
anymore. Steve probably wasn’t ever going to stop. He was too enamored with the time traveler and he doubted that was going to change anytime soon.
Steve wanted to push them all aside and runaway but he could not do that without hurting someone. These people may have been vultures but that did not mean they deserved to get hurt! So, instead, Steve slowly pressed through, going in the direction he knew the street to be and prayed a taxi driver would take pity on him because, if not, he would have to walk with these people for miles and he doubted his sanity could handle it.
Before she could reply to either question, the answer was indirectly supplied when the door burst open and men in tactical gear surrounded him.
He could not let Steve do this! There had to be another solution! Tony refused to live in a world without both
Both Pops and Uncle Tony looked at Peter with similar expressions of bemusement then they looked at each other and exchanged grins.
Sitting with Bucky in the kitchen the former KGB agents shared, Steve could see that Bucky was finally doing better. As the week passed, his friend improved slowly yet steadily. Now Bucky was talking again and asking what he could do to help.
By the time they reached their destination, Tony had no luck with SHIELD or Phil. That gut feeling Steve had was beginning to clench painfully. He didn’t like going into a possible hostile situation without all of the facts.
The shrill alarm sounded and Venom’s body expanded beyond what he thought possible then broke apart in many different directions with Peter at its core.
His mask was gone and Tony knew he somehow recognized him but he just assumed he was another undercover Hydra agent who had once posed as a SHIELD agent.
He threw a few bags into the basket and hissed, “Where we are does not change anything. We are still in the same era. We still can change the future…and we still have to save Stark’s life. You two interacting in this era can change that. You
“It’s okay, Peter,” Steve whispered, just barely keeping his voice from breaking. Steve stooped his head and lightly kissed Peter’s forehead. He repeated, “It’s okay…”
“No…It’s just…” Tony ran his fingers over the goatee he was growing in and he murmured, “I just hadn’t realized until now…but…look at you…”
Steve ignored him. He was completely focused on the phone call with Peter. Steve stated, "Tony wanted to meet you. He wants to know you. He doesn't care about media reaction. He cares about
Jarvis said nothing more so Fury must’ve been sent straight to voicemail. Tony already forgot about him as he wallowed in his memories.
Steve snorted as he looked at the photo on the phone and then he turned the phone on Tony and said, “Smile.”
How would Peter react if she walked through the door at that moment? Would he become more traumatized? Would he cry? Or would he yell? Or…worse, would he just stare at her blankly, his mind broken because it could not handle another shock?
But that was his life now and now that Peter had survived the fight with the Sinister Six and Tony did not disappear, he’d breath a little easier.
Steve nodded his thanks and ran to the team’s personal quinjet. Over the coms, Steve asked, “Clint, can you give me a ride?”
Pops stormed into the room, looking as angry as Uncle Bucky did. Uncle Bucky jolted to a stop and Pops tore Peter out of arms. He held Peter before him, his feet dangling in the air, and looked over him. Not a second later, did Uncle Tony step beside his pops and look with Peter with such worry that it made Peter’s gut drop. Uncle Tony reached out and grasped the side of his face and his fingers dug into Peter’s scalp as he searched Peter’s face.
He wasn’t ready for this. He didn’t even know there was a “this” to worry about until last night! And how concerned about “this” should he be? Did he just want to be friends with Steve too? He didn’t know if he could answer these questions yet! It was too soon!
He continued his pacing and, at first he thought Steve wasn't going to reply and have an end to the conversation but, after an extended silence, Steve stated in a quiet voice, “We may not be related but…Peter’s…He's my son too, Tony...”
Steve grasped Tony’s head and reclaimed his lips. Tony hummed with approval and slid his glorious tongue back into Steve’s mouth. Tony began to slowly hump his hips into Steve and Steve automatically met his movement with thrusts of his own.
Tony’s kiss was nothing like Steve had expected. He had kissed a few dames during the war and they were usually stolen from Steve as the women jumped on him unsuspectingly. Whenever he had imagined a kiss, it was usually just a quick warm peck.
Richard Parker had started his career in his second family’s business, Stark Industries. He moved up quickly in the biological sector and eventually became to head of the department. What made him so renown was when he partnered with Norman Osborn, bought out the department, and cut all ties with Stark Industries nearly two decades ago.
“CONGRATULATIONS!” Thor exclaimed, making Steve and Peter jump in surprise. Thor swooped in and grasped Peter’s shoulders. He stated proudly, “You are one step closer to becoming a man and a great warrior like your father! Revel in this celebration, my young friend! And may it be the first of many grand events to come throughout your lifetime!”
He had the relationship he dreamed for…but, now he had the additional price that came along with it.
Tony’s mouth slipped off him and Steve almost whimpered from the loss of that startling heat. Tony whispered, “Look at me. I need to see your face.”
With a mock gasp, Wade hissed, “What will it be a soliloquy? Or shall I compose a song about how great you look in this suit?”
Wade leaned into his side and ran his fingers over Peter’s skin. Peter was shirtless but someone had given him pajama bottoms to help preserve what little dignity he had left despite the fact that
She nodded with understanding and hugged him one last time before slipping out of the room. Howard sighed heavily and returned to the chair beside Tony’s bed.
“I never had a soulmate,” the Red Skull commented nonchalantly. He completed the circuit around his implant and turned his blade in Steve’s flesh, pushing the implant up at an odd angle. “Is it really worth all of this drama? It seems more like a tether, weighing you down, making you weak.”
relationships. It didn’t work with Pep. I’m just crap at them. This – between us – it’s just going to be casual, right?”
do, Peter, and because we have enemies you do as well. Being related to us isn’t as cool as your friends would have you believe…”
They did not notice Thor arrive a few minutes later on the screen and begin his fruitless search through the rubble of the house. The camera’s focused on his efforts and captured his frustration.
“Y-You can get me a new identity? M-Make it so people don’t know I’m Captain America?” Steve gasped.
“Was that why you got her the ‘I’m sorry’ – hiya flowers?” Peter asked with a pinched brow as he was trying to understand all of this.
As they waited for the trial, they gave a few “in-depth” interviews to some of the more supportive news stations. Mostly they wanted to talk about their stance on the case but always had to end off the interview with a little tidbits about their personal lives, namely their relationship. With the interviews, the tide was turning. Poles were showing more support for Steve.
Steve had hoped with Peter’s disappearance Venom might calm but it seemed to only agitate the symbiote further.
Steve tightly grasped his hand and whispered, “If I were alive, I’d be leading a team out into that desert to find you right now!”
Grinning cheekily, Clint replied, “No problem.” He sat at one of the barstools on the opposite side of the counter and Natasha positioned herself by the curtained off window in the living room. Turning to Steve, Clint asked, “So what’s the plan now, Cap?”
So Peter did just that. He pulled him father into a hard embrace and buried his face into the man’s shoulder. Tony's arms whipped around him in seconds and he also pressed his face into Peter's shoulder. He gasped, “I love you, son.”
He carefully stood and paused to let the water drip down his body and let the air dry him as much as it could. Tony heard him get up and turned on his side to watch him. He smiled flirtatiously and murmured, “What a view.”
“He danced up a storm at the reception,” Steve quietly retorted with a found smile as he remembered the little boy dancing with whoever he could to the music.
His mind kept wandering but he forced himself to focus. He needed to be all there for the current situation. He wanted his parents and Wade to get along and it has gone off with a disastrous start.
“I may have neglected to mention you have a roommate…” Wade chuckled as he slipped out of Peter’s arms and sat on the edge of his bed. He kept his hands on Peter’s hands and Peter unconsciously intertwined their fingers.
Steve’s brows pinched together in worry and he looked like he wanted to hold Tony. Bucky stepped in before Steve exposed themselves to a quarter of the 107
“Assumed?” Tony asked, his eyebrows raising a tick, on top of everything else, did he have to worry about Jarvis going Terminator on him.
Maybe it was the influence of the beer or maybe it was that utterly sincere look in Steve’s eyes, but Tony pulled Steve in by their connected hands and out of sight of the doors into the dark shadow of a corner against the building.
The caller apologized for not calling sooner and told Steve that he was alive and that, while he was unconscious, the suit had flown him to the last coordinates he had looked up right before the attack. He then randomly added he had stolen a poncho from a wooden Indian, probably to distract Steve from the fact that he had admitted to being unconscious and thereby hurt. He said he was sorry for making him worry and apologized again about not being able to come home yet.
Tony picked up his fork with renewed vigor and asked, "Really? Already? Are you going to be kissing babies too?"
Peter sat up, chewing on his lip nervously. He and Wade had been dancing around this since yesterday and Wade finally made his move. Now it was up to Peter to make the next. He gave Peter an easy out. Peter could ask to go as friends only but…
“I deny it all,” Tony joked. They chuckled together and another silence fell between them. Yet this silence was not as strange and, in it, Peter reflected over his and Steve’s multiple conversations.
When Steve moaned deeply in response, all the blood in Tony’s body rushed to his nether regions. There wasn’t a doubt in his mind that he and Steve were not going to leave that bed without making love vigorously and multiple times to release all of the pent up emotions they had for each other.
His eyes rose to meet Tony’s as he came to a quick decision on how to reply without drawing more suspicion. Taking a page from Tony’s book, he replied, “I’m Steve-Steven…Steven Edwards.”
Shivers went back down his spine again but, for an entirely different reason and Tony tilted his head back, tracing his nose along Steve’s jaw.
Peter let go of his baseball hat and knocked his sunglasses as he reached out to the bushes with both hands. Steve quickly readjusted his glasses to keep his face hidden. When he first was unfrozen, no one recognized him. After the attack on New York, the Smithsonian opening an exhibit on him, and the scandal he and Natasha were involved in, releasing SHIELD’s database on the World Wide Web, everyone recognized him. He did not mind when everyday people approached him to talk or ask for his autograph or a picture but the paparazzi were vicious. No one knew about Peter just yet and he wanted to keep it that way as long as he could.
None of them could hear him and Thor hit Venom with his hammer. Venom went flying, lightening covering its black body, and then landed at Hulk’s feet. Hulk slammed down both of his huge fists and Venom’s body exploded.
“Yes,” his target replied wetly. “He just doesn’t remember.” She looked at the Soldier with sad eyes and whispered, “Do you?”
Tony pulled Steve closer and cupped his face. He smiled sadly at him, making Steve bite his lip with an unhappy frown.
He lay on top of him and Steve’s arms folded around him as he murmured, “I’ve fantasized about this morning for years. So many years…” Steve’s fingers lightly caressed the skin of his back and he whispered, “Now here I am, it’s morning, we’re both awake, and I’m in your bed.”
Tony turned sharply in midair and hissed, “Believe it or not, the world is no longer so black and white as it used to be. We no longer just follow the lead of our leaders just because they say ‘go.’
”What did you find out what happened to Steve in the new future?” Bucky asked. He looked reluctant to come between them in such an emotional moment but his concerns for Steve’s future obviously overroad that.
Peter and Wade were too wrapped up in each other to notice Logan’s suspicions. He was happy for them, he really was…Those two had been wallowing in their loneliness long enough.
For the first time in almost a decade, Tony ignored the press invites and the media clamoring for his attention. It made them more curious, but Tony did not care.
Steve inhaled sharply and then looked back down at those lips. Open, ready, and willing. There was really no valid excuse for him not to do it so he took the plunge and separated the distance between them.
Bruce blearily blinked at Steve and murmured, “Steve? No, no can’t use Steve. Can’t sacrifice one for the other…” Bruce wearily turned back to his computer and Steve stared at hum dumbfounded.
Peter’s heart fluttered in his chest and he remembered threading his fingers through Wade’s during the wedding.
Chuckling, Peter rolled up his mask to expose his mouth and took off his gloves so they wouldn’t get dirty. He picked up one of the cheesy, tortilla wraps and the took a bite.
“I didn’t think that,” Steve murmured gently. He wrapped his arms around Tony and whispered, “I know it would hurt but Peter would have saved you…”
She shifted onto his lap and he leaned back to accommodate her…only to tip the chair back too far and have them both plummet to the ground in a swift fall.
The Chameleon had gone into hiding but Norman quickly contacted him through the usual channels and learned that the robot was not with him.
Steve bent down and kissed Tony. It was only going to be a quick comforting kiss but Tony pulled him in deeper and the next thing he knew he had Tony’s tongue in his mouth and his hands kneaded the muscles around Steve’s neck and shoulders.
Steve heard him but his mind could not process his words. He did not believe him and gasped, “S-show me a newspaper, something with a date on it!”
{No...He loves you, Wade and you him. You never knew the true meaning of happiness until you met our baby boy} the other assured him. {This isn't a bad thing. Even the Merc with a Mouth can find happiness, love, and other poetic crap synonyms that express how perfect you two are for each other.}
“I was never dat small,” Peter retorted, frowning like Tony would when he did not get his way. It made Steve laugh and he hugged his son close to his chest. The rest of his family watched the scene with a found eye…all except Bucky, who dropped back and slinked back into the shadowed corner of the room with a carefully constructed blank expression and dark, stormy eyes.
He wordlessly made breakfast as she was in the shower and had their customary oatmeal ready and waiting for her when she came out dressed in fresh clothes and with wet hair. She surprised him when she picked up her bowl and chair and moved the various items to sit beside all of his. Her chair was so close that she was able to lean into his side and he could just smell the cleanliness of the fresh soap on her skin.
Steve planted a firm kiss on Tony’s knuckles and then turned to Peter and beckoned him for another hug.
This was also the first time Tony would be going to the memorial since returning to the present and he wasn’t sure how he was going to react either…
The Red Skull stepped up to him and punched him in the gut, knocking all of the air out of his lungs. Steve gasped for breath and Schmidt stated, “The first step in destroying you is breaking your will. You will do as I command or I will hurt you…Say it.”
With a heavy heart, he moved on and went to the graveyard. Many new grave markers had been added in the meantime, but Steve knew exactly where to find his parents’ graves. He was happy to see them still there. He cleaned them both up the best he could, pulling away weeds and scraping off dust and moss. When he saw his apartment was gone he had developed an irrational fear that their graves would be gone too… He sat with them and caught them up with everything that had happened. From their spot on a grassy knoll, he watched the sunset and when it dipped below the horizon, he left but not before murmuring, “Goodnight, Pa…Night, Ma.”
The Tesseract would be in the plane with Steve so all Tony would have to do would be to grab Steve, then the creepy blue cube, then grab Bucky wherever he had him stashed away, and then they could all skedaddle back to the future.
Steve returned the embrace, but, from the corner of his eye, he saw the super soldier look questionably at Tony. Peter provided explanation and murmured into Steve’s chest, “Spidey’s identity almost got discovered.”
Peter's hand was indeed moving. It shifted across the floor slowly. Tony turned on the speakers and called out to his son, “Peter!?”
The following nights, Tony worked busily in his imagined workshop. He brought out scans and data on the arc reactor Stark Industries had built years prior and Steve finally asked, “What are you going to do with that?”
Mary’s steely eyes slid from Steve to Tony and the lack of emotion in her gaze made Steve want to take back his question. He saw something in her eyes that was off. It was the same crazed glint he had seen in many super villains’ eyes.
Tony thought on it and replied, “Nope, it’s his baby and I figured I’d give him some time with it before sticking my nose in it…” Tony flushed and added, “I’ve also been distracted by the fact he was dating Wade around the same time he created it.”
Natasha was frowning deeply but she burrowed into his side as if she were trying to stay there forever.
“Oh, you’re no fun,” Tony said, falling onto the couch next to Steve. He grinned cockily at Steve and Steve could not help but grin back.
Peter began to shake as he looked over the various wounds he’d inflicted on Wade. He’d seen people torn apart by aliens but looking at Wade like this and knowing he’d done it made Peter want to vomit.
Steve and Tony sat in Tony’s huge living room and Steve recounted the events that led to his reawakening in the 21
“Don’t move,” Bucky whispered, his voice was harsh like he was not used to using it. Steve’s jaw dropped as Bucky murmured, “You lost too much blood.”
Ben Parker has dropped Harry off when you and the other Avengers are too busy fighting. Not to mention, he looks just like Mary. How could I not know? Any rookie reporter could have discovered it by now. I’m surprised it isn’t in the headlines by now!”
Steve and Tony were never far from each other’s sides and, on numerous occasions, had publically called each other best friend and America fell in love with their rapport. Their friendship was being painted as the cornerstone to the formation of the team. People proclaimed them the dream team with Steve bringing the strength and old-school knowhow and Tony bringing the brains and modern tech. It was a role both men easily adorned. Steve had been the face of the American soldier during his USO tour and he simply adopted the same mindset. He didn’t have to kiss any crying babies yet but Tony still teased about the possibility. Tony too was able to handle the media as he had been doing it all his life. He confided to Steve that it was much more fun with someone at his side.
“The city also owns it and put a lot of effort into making it look nice,” Bruce murmured behind Steve but Peter did not hear him.
Despite everything that was going on in their lives, Tony knew for certain today was going to be a good day and nothing was going to spoil it.
The group around him dissipated, most ran but a few brave souls continued to film. None of them went close to Steve.
Tony’s stomach lurched at the sight and he remembered his friend vocalizing his fear of being experimented on.
Peter stopped the tear rolling down Wade’s cheek with a gentle wipe of his finger and whispered, “I love you too, Wade Wilson.
Steve continued to tell Bruce but he wrapped an arm around Tony and squeezed his shoulder. Their embrace was their silent way of apologizing to each other.
Hulk turned to Steve with an enraged roar. He did not hear Steve. All he knew was that Steve was hindering him. Steve caught the Hulk’s emerald green eyes and he begged, “Hulk stop. It’s Peter, y-your brother.
With that thought, Tony’s heart felt like someone had stabbed it and twisted the blade in his chest.
With these dark thoughts in mind, Steve clasped his hands together, strangling his fingers, and asked Jarvis, “Can you please play the video feed here?”
Eddie clapped his back and the tiny tendril on Peter’s neck quickly slithered beneath his collar before either of them noticed it.
Steve’s usual mixture of feelings toward Tony was now even more of an enormous mess of a blend after Tony broke the news to him. Tony appeared enraged by it, even more so than Steve, and he was pulling all out all the stops to get a handle on the situation. Steve was too shocked by the fact that someone would accuse him of doing this to react just yet. It was too unbelievable to him still.
“Kinda,” Bucky murmured, rubbing the side of his face. “It was the stuff they drilled into me whenever they needed to scrub my memory…I did not want you to think about Stark, I think that is why it came out…Sorry.” His face became blank again and he stared off to the side.
Steve sighed heavily and slipped out of bed. He looked at the digital clock at his bedside and saw it was twenty minutes before dawn. He might as well get ready for the new day.
The man twisted behind Tony and violently stabbed something into the soft space between the corner of Tony’s jaw and neck.
“I’m sorry but if you just witnessed what I did then you would be on the same page,” Clint gasped. He slid past Tony and said, “I have to find her.”
It was hard on Steve’s heart but Sam was always there knowing just what to say when Steve stumbled for words or Steve himself felt himself spiraling.
Captain Rogers buried his face into his hands and he whispered to himself, “I don’t want to be here…I died in World War II. I shouldn’t be here.”
Steve groaned and broke their kiss to gasp, “I love you so much. I can’t believe we’re finally doing this!”
and for them to stay in bed the rest of the day, letting Peter get the sleep he craved. Wade was happy to just lay there and watch Peter slumber.
Venom melted out of Thor’s hands. Thor tried to keep Venom in his grip and grabbed madly at his melting body.
Steve studied Tony for a moment and then replied, “If I call her ‘Susan’ then it sounds too personal and…gross.”
Coulson continued forward, grimly following the footprints in the ice. The footprints led out of the plane. There must have been another way inside. How did his team miss it?
And when he was finally able to slide inside of Steve…he never before felt so undone and complete at once.
“Wade,” Peter sighed. The hushed voice was like a siren, spurning Wade into action. He placed a protective hand on Peter’s head and then with the other violently pulled down on his body, throwing his boyfriend onto the hard ground.
“No, thank God,” Tony hissed and rutted his body against Steve, causing the blond to throw back his head with a mighty groan. Tony reached under the couch, where they had hidden the lube from Peter and buried his face in Steve’s neck nipping playfully at the flesh as he did. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony then stiffened. Tony paused just as his fingers brushed against the container then he pushed himself up and looked questionably at Steve.
“Remembered?” Steve tried again. He wanted to beg him to talk to him and tell him what it was that was plaguing him. What was he remembering?
He remembered the last time he fought Schmidt like this, kneeling beside Natasha for what he thought was the last time. He’d been able to defy him by mumbling one extra word but now he had to stop his entire body from moving.
“Maybe…It’ll be hard but I’m going to try. He has all of my attention now and, as soon as we reach the new base, I’ll be able to really concentrate on it. I’ll probably not follow the 107
Tony flew them there and when they landed Steve excitedly looked around. Tony took their bags into the living room and then went into the lab for his armor to disassemble.
Tony rolled his eyes and answered Bucky’s prior question by stating, “This thing in my chest is an arc reactor, it keeps me alive…” Tony slipped out of the bed and stretched his arms above his head. “It also helps keep my suit nicely charged…speaking of which, J?”
As soon as he saw Steve, Peter felt all of his emotions rise and tangle together in his throat all over again. Ever since he met the super soldier, he'd be the one Peter would go to when he was upset. He was there for Peter when he found out the truth about his parentage and he was still there for him now that everyone else knew. He ran to his step-father and embraced him tightly.
“I’m fine,” Steve whispered. He quickly gasped what he had been dying to tell Tony, he said, “I’m so sorry about everything. I love you, Ton-.”
Steve went to his room to shower, probably to get the filth of the paparazzi off of him but, upon cracking open the first magazine, Tony knew they were the first thing Steve needed to see as soon as he was out.
Tony was weirdly silent too. Steve had grown used to his voice as the man obviously liked to talk but he seemed to be taking the situation seriously and his eyes spanned the perimeter, looking around them and…above them?
Peter quickly calmed down in their presence. He unwound his arms from around the other two and let go of Tony as he embarrassedly murmured, “Sorry…”
“He did not contact any of us,” Clint retorted. “We only know he is alive because of the message he sent you. Jarvis tracked the call to a payphone and that is all we know.”
! You Goddamn, Star-spangled, beautiful idiot!” Tony pulled back just enough to mash his lips into Steve’s and he kissed him like a man starving for sustenance. Tony’s hands searched every corner of his body, checking for injury and touching him just to do it because they were both
“So fucking stupid!” Bucky cursed, “This will definitely change the future…unless, do you think he won’t remember?”
There it was. The emotion that had been in Steven’s voice, so similar to Pepper’s but…why did it seem like there was...more? Was it really just because Tony reminded him of his dead fiancé? Why would he care about Tony in the first place? He didn’t even know Tony… Or was there something more he was missing?
“Premature baldness?” Peter teased to try to lift Wade’s spirits. Inside, however, his heart broke with Wade’s words. He knew Wade had very low self-esteem. Before they started dating, Wade had kept it hidden from everyone, including Peter. But now that they were in a relationship, he was opening up to Peter and letting him see his true feelings about himself in addition to his love for Peter.
His friend did not reply and Tony cautiously slid closer to him. He must have been having a nightmare and Tony felt uneasy about invading Steve’s personal space in such a personal moment.
“Yup,” Tony replied dryly, he hadn't been the first to ask and won't be the last...well, Tony hoped he wouldn't be the last...
Tony grabbed the comforter and wrapped it around himself. He followed the cold and found half of his kitchen was missing and was replaced by a huge hole in the wall, exposing his home to the rest of New York City.
At this rate, he was probably devolve and give a pathetic excuse of goodnight kiss to Peter tonight where their noses would bump and their teeth would awkwardly click and forget any tongue nooo that’s for adults with nicely sized balls…
Natasha simply smiled and said, “After lunch, James and I were going to spar and I was hoping you’d join us, Peter. I’ve been told you’ve got a new defense that’s impenetrable…I’d like to prove everyone wrong.”
“Oh shush, Capsicle. I am going to be in an amazing mood the rest of the week, you better get used to it.
He remembered reaching out to “Steve” and praying to God that he’d catch his hand. He remembered praying to that same God as he fell to his “death.” He remembered blood trailing from a sump of flesh that was once his left arm. He remembered a lab. And he remembered pain.
“You haven’t aged, Steve…At this rate, I’m going to grow older than you…” Tony whispered, his voice filled with horror.
Steve ripped a syringe out of his neck and then raised his fists, taking a boxing stance. He grumbled, “You guys don’t learn, do you?”
Tony’s thumbs caressed the insides of Steve’s wrists and whispered, “It has been over a year since we started dating but we’ve known each other much, much longer…” Steve nodded and tensed, preparing himself for bad news. Tony continued, “We have faced death countless times and have even gone through God awful periods when we thought the other was dead…” Steve nodded again, biting down on his lip. What horror was Tony building up to? Tony continued, “What I’m trying to say is we don’t know when we’re going to go…It could be tomorrow or it could be fifty years from now but…” Tony inhaled deeply and opened his hands. He gently pulled the box from Steve’s grasp and popped it open. Inside sat two silver rings.
It had to once be a man. He had the correct torso, two legs, and arms but that was where the similarities ended. The muscles on this creature were even larger than Steve’s and he had to be over seven feet tall. With all the muscles, he had to weigh hundreds of pounds. He was probably thrice the weight of Steve.
Peter settled down quickly once he was in Steve’s arms. His crying exhausted him and he fell asleep in Steve’s hold in a matter of minutes.
Tony did not correct his AI’s assumptions for his staring but he did sigh heavily to himself. In the future, the Iron Man units were connected to the larger arc reactor that powered both his home and lab. They never needed charging from his personal reactor to operate separately, especially since he mostly used the suits while wearing them. As soon as he got back to the future, the first thing he was going to do was install arc reactors in
“He’s going to live,” Bruce stated, asserting the fact. And, yes, knowing Steve was going to live was immensely relieving but now couldn’t help but worry over the state of their relationship. Would Steve even want to speak to him after all of this?
“More than that,” Peter replied. His gaze rose and that glow Wade had seen last night was there again. Peter cupped his face and whispered, “I’ve never been happier than I am right now, with
Ms. Potts entered the room and jolted to a stop when she saw him. She stared blankly at him. Without Jarvis’s greeting, Steve would have still recognized her as being the woman Tony was always talking about. Steve awkwardly waved his sponge and said, “Hello.”
“Thank God,” Tony sighed. He carefully pulled his phone out of his pocket and pressed a few buttons before bringing it up to his ear. He kept one hand on Peter and said in a hushed voice, “Jarvis, get a cleaning crew to sterilize every corner of Steve’s floor. Make it snappy, we have an hour time limit!”
Peter let them lead him inside. He was half expecting the rest of the Avengers to be there, waiting for him, but, the living room was empty.
Wade nodded and Peter crawled up the rest of the wall to reach Wade. He pressed a kiss into Wade’s mouth one more time and and Wade returned the kiss with a smile curling his lips. For a moment, Peter's entire world was him, Wade, and their mouths.
“I know,” Peter sighed. It was the main reason Steve was put in charge of the team. His dad got a narrow vision when it came to what was good versus bad. Tony knew it too which was why he never fought for the leading role. Glancing at Steve, Peter pointed out, “You’re usually the one to show him the grey side of things.”
“No takie backsies!” Tony gasped childishly and tightened his hold on Steve’s hand, drawing a laugh from Steve.
Steve continued in a light whisper, “I know things have been bad since Bucky came into the picture. I know I messed up when I kissed him. I did not know who I loved more until I thought I had lost you. But, Tony, you have been one of the only constants in my life since I woke from the ice. Until that moment, I had not realized how important you are to me. I may have glanced Bucky’s way but you will always be a part of me. I don’t need Bucky. I lived without him for years but you…I need you. The world is a darker place without you in it…”
Steve tried to straighten out his clothing the best he could but between swimming in the ocean the day before and sleeping out in the elements in it, it was beginning to look worse for wear.
“No, Solo!” Steve got to his feet and Solo scrambled backwards, creating more distance between them. Steve continued, “I’m not an alien, Solo. It’s just me! Ste-Che-Chewie,
Steve’s soul cried out in pain at the unfairness. Steve wanted to be there for Tony in the real world. He wanted to help him with his homework or personal projects.
Tony stared back and watched his worst fears come true. Venom’s face melted away and Peter’s was revealed. Tony lowered his hands and Peter groggily blinked.
Steve sighed heavily and said, “Not good…I can’t believe Bucky would try to shoot me…” He reached out to Tony and drew his thumb across his cheek and whispered, “Or try to shoot you…”
“Especially with my sudden reappearance,” Steve added and finishing off the last of his sandwich. Tony got another cup of coffee and looked at Natasha with raised eyebrows.
“J, get a fresh pot brewing for me in the kitchen,” Tony asked. He could have used the coffee machine in the lab but he wanted to see how Steve was doing.
Steve fingers returned to Tony’s hair and returned to their petting. He huskily whispered, “Thank you.”
The former Commando couldn’t hide his surprise when the arm clicked in easily and he could move it within seconds.
“No, he didn’t.” Bruce easily slid out of his weaker grasp and turned to his computer. He opened a tab on his computer to an article entitled: “Vigilante or Villain?”
Wanda shook her head and assured them, “It’s the same as last time…We’ll probably be able to get it off the same way.”
Steve inhaled sharply and whispered, “I might have a few suggestions on where to start…” Tony stopped moving and his eyes flickered to Steve.
The doors opened as he walked up to him and he entered the Avengers’ locker room. When the doors closed, Peter automatically went to pull off his mask. He chuckled to himself for the move as Venom morphed into a plain black shirt and he needed to remove nothing. He’d get the hang of it eventually.
The symbiote looked weaker. It had shrunk since Norman last saw it in the sewers and its inky skin had a slight grey hue. Its cheeks and ribs were hallowed in, as if it were starving. It glared at Norman with calculating and clever eyes.
“G-Get it off! Somebody get this off! Let me see my implant!” Tony gasped as he tugged uselessly at his gauntlet and repressed sobs that were shaking his entire body. He seemed to know what he was going to see and he was already preparing for the worst.
Wade, meanwhile, squealed excitedly and sat beside Peter with a huge grin as he held one of his hands again. When Peter’s eyes were drawn to his, Wade smiled warmly at Peter and his loving gaze portrayed just what Tony alluded to…Wade loved his son and was probably going to spend the rest of his life by his side.
He planted one last, deep kiss upon those lips and then pulled up slightly, his face hovering over Tony's.
“I think I will stay clean shaven,” Peter replied with a slight edge. Now that it was out that he was Tony’s son, did people expect him to drop everything and be just like him?
It had been weeks since...the incident and Steve had thrown himself into his new life in the meantime and had barely seen his friend.
The others nodded and Natasha grabbed Sitwell’s other arm and they propelled him to the roof access door with Cling bringing up the rear. Sam and Tony took off, going to straight to their getaway car.
Peter grinned excitedly at Eddie and he forgot about everyone else in the lab. He gasped, “We need to expand the sample!”
Fury suddenly turned his ire on them and Steve and Tony both stiffened. Pointing at them, Fury hissed, “And you two, you’re going to get back into whatever you were wearing when you arrived and then you are going to stay in isolation until Cable arrives and escorts you both back to the past.”
Between the paparazzi and Peter’s relationship change, Steve hadn’t thought more about the bio-shield other than he was proud of Peter for creating it. Did he really miss something?
They walked at a quick pace. Tony was confident the AI was following them and he kept a mental counter of the minutes to make sure the suit’s systems didn’t not shut down in the middle of a busy encampment.
She finished her martini and placed the glass on the counter in front of her. She made no move to lift herself from his shoulder and Steve took another sip from the flask.
The Soldier lowered his weapon, stood at attention, and asked in a dead voice, “What are my orders?”
sneaking around without revealing himself was with the knowledge that the was the only remaining super soldier and thereby the strongest man on the planet.
Steve did. His eyes were glassy with fever and Tony wanted to reach through the screen and hold him but all he could do was watch, hypnotized by the fact that Steve was there and alive and he was so scared about what they were going to do to him. Because this was not a coincidence. This was a show, for Tony, the Avengers, or all of them. The Red Skull wanted to deliver a message and he was going to use Steve to hurt them more.
They both collapsed onto the bed and Steve groaned, “I have that meeting with the General first thing in the morning…”
Due to reactions to the prior chapter, I just wanted to elaborate that the suit is a reflection of the future. Just as in Back to the Future, items from the future changed based upon what they did. Change one thing and it can cause a butterfly effect to the future and their budding romance is definitely something that will attract a lot of butterflies;D
Bruce grinned shyly in reply. It was the first time Tony had seen a semblance of a smile on his face and it made Tony feel good.
Another cold reminder of how the world had changed. Steve stated, “This is not my era. This is not my war or fight.”
With wide eyes, Peggy looked down at Tony and her eyes seemed to grow larger as she made connections with this new information. Steve gently picked Tony back up and her gaze followed them as he stood up. Steve implored, “Peggy?”
Tony pulled out the wireless reactor and was glad to see the exterior looked fine. He had another five minutes until he went into heart failure to figure out what was wrong.
Tony winced but not because of the public reaction. He could handle the public’s outrage. He winced because he had no idea how Steve was going to react. Not only had Tony caused him immense physical pain but Tony had shot him when trying to kill the man Steve thought to be his best friend. Speaking of which…
The Soldier internally flinched as he did not remember what she suggested but instead remembered the pain. His master had tortured him within an inch of his life and repeatedly told him it was because he wanted something he was not allowed. It was one of the few memories that stayed with him and a constant reminder to never go against his master’s wishes again.
To those of you I told I was posting it on Friday, SORRY! I had no time to edit it as I got home late last night and I had to work this morning! BUT here it is and it's July 4th so happy birthday America and Steve Rogers! :3
“Boys, I have something serious to tell you and don’t listen to Uncle Tony,” Bucky commanded. He held out the skewer to Steve and he wordlessly took over the barbeque. As Steve turned the dogs again, Bucky folded his arms across his chest and stated, “You both know there are trigger words that can give someone temporary control of me?”
He felt Tony’s lips lightly brushing his cheeks and he realized he was kissing away his tears. Steve buried his face in Tony’s chest, let his courage falter, and unleashed it all. All his worry, all his fear, and all his pain came pouring out of him in the form of powerful sobs.
Tony leaned back and said, “Okay, let’s see…Well from what I deemed from my own research…You like science?”
They were stealing his memories and Tony with it. The love that had grown between them was being shredded and he was beginning to question his feelings.
“They’re Hydra,” Tony stated, interrupting him before he got into a speech about secret inteligence.
Steve only broke from Tony’s mouth when it became too much. His entire body tensed and Steve came, rising into Tony’s thrust one last time.
“Jarvis?” Tony weakly called out…but his AI was silent. Obadiah must’ve reboot the AI before entering the property. Tony hadn’t thought to restrict Obadiah’s clearance. He’d only been trying to prove Obadiah was in the wrong…and he certainly had all the proof now but…
Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, carding new strands with ever passing. He whispered, “You – You want to hear something crazy? I told the entire world I am Iron Man a few hours ago.”
with a man…or a woman for that matter. The man never discussed relationships with him so, for all Tony knew, Steve was still a virgin. Even if this was just a fling to Steve, Tony wanted to treasure him and not take away something that was probably precious to him.
Peter always stayed with one of the Avengers while his dad toiled away in the lab. They never left Peter alone anymore, before Venom he would have complained about being babied, now he was thankful for it. He hated being alone. The silence was the worst.
In Peter’s bedroom, Steve moved more slowly. He made sure to grab everything his son would need for a long stay away from the Tower. Clothes, toys, and other essentials were needed and he packed them all away in a second duffel. He huffed the bag, plus the bag filled with his own clothes, over his shoulder and was making his way out of the room when he paused by Peter’s bed.
Tony slammed his head on the counter from embarrassment as soon as the words escaped his lips. It sounded like he was quoting something from one of those old Captain America documentaries. Steve chuckled and Tony said, “Ignore me. I sound like an idiot.”
“It’s alright, Peter,” the dark haired woman whispered fervently. “Your father wanted me to give this to you.”
Peter bit down on his lip upon the reflections. He never saw what Uncle Tony had been doing as fatherly until now. Guilt instantly weighed heavily upon his shoulders.
Bucky slid into the bed and smiled at Steve’s slack jaw then settled down for the night, spooning himself to Steve’s side and wrapping his human arm over his side. It woke Steve. He placed his hand over Bucky’s, thinking it was Tony’s. But as he noticed the larger size of the body behind him and completely woke, he remembered Tony was gone and all the pain and shame came rushing back to him.
Tony sat Bucky in front of the TV and turned on the news to keep him from pacing through the house. The SHIELD versus Hydra debacle was the main story and Bucky was instantly fixated.
Tony kissed him one more time then hopped back and jogged into the bathroom. Steve lounged on the bed and contemplated napping until Tony returned.
When Tony eventually crawled out of bed, it was around noon. He found his husband in their shared office. Steve had a few holograms open before him and he didn’t look away from them as he greeted, “Good afternoon, sleepyhead.”
Uncle Bucky chuckled then snapped his newspaper to straighten the paper and continue reading. Uncle Bucky was charged with babysitting Peter until his pops and uncle returned and had not left his side since they left. Peter bet the man would even follow him into the bathroom after the stunt he pulled yesterday.
Pepper had come over with forms to sign and she’d started talking about a scandalous affair between a front desk secretary and one of the town car drivers. Tony only half listened but hadn’t noticed her stop.
SHIELD agents were trickling in and Steve motioned them over. He pointed them over to his husband and they nodded with understanding. Steve watched them until they reached Tony and turned his attention back to Hulk.
“No…” Steve whispered, slowly laying back down. He still appeared confused and explained to Tony, “It almost sounds like a commentator for a baseball ga –.”
A moment later, Peter’s heart pain stopped and his dad reappeared, laying exactly where he had fallen.
“Sir’s arc reactor has been damaged beyond repair and needs to be replaced immediately,” Jarvis stated from Iron Man’s speakers. “Do you remember how to remove it?”
! Unsurprisingly, Steve shared his views on the matter and, for the first time since they started fighting, they were finally able to agree on something. Fury was in the wrong and they had to put a stop to it.
It was after a few days into the fruitless search, Steve brought Peter and two cups of coffee down with him into the workshop. Tony was sitting at his workbench with his holograms. He had not shaved in a while and had a dark stubble growing on his jaw.
Even connected as they were, Tony bent down and collected Steve into his arms, needing to be closer, needing to hold him tightly to show him how much he needed him still. Steve wrapped his arms and legs around him and pulled him just as closely, probably needing the same contact for the same reason.
Steve inhaled deeply then made himself pretend this was a mission. He straightened his back and pushed back all his emotions. He was able to meet Tony’s eyes without flushing and a resolve built inside him.
So this next chapter is heavily influenced by Iron Man 3... Some scenes and lines I literally copied straight from the movie but there are major differences as well since Tony is in a relationship with Steve and not Pepper.
“What have I missed?” Tony asked gruffly. Now that he knew she was a machine, he was able to see the little things that differentiated her from living organisms. Her pupils were constantly the same size and did not change under the varying lights, her movements were not as fluid as a human’s, and Tony bet if he touched her, her flesh would hold no warmth.
“I did not know we were expecting guests,” Pepper dived in. she began to question the newcomer who called herself Maya Henson and Steve took the opportunity to question Tony.
Peter pulled himself out of Steve’s embrace and looked down at him with an extreme look of concentration. He suddenly puffed his cheeks, went cross-eyed, and stuck his tongue out at Steve.
He was still reading the article when Happy pulled them up to Tony’s Tower. They drove into the lower garage and Steve was surprised to see reporters outside the main doors.
“Tony…you’re too young to understand this right now so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you…and some day you’ll realize it represents a whole lot more than people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future…
The blue light disappeared in a snap and he fell forward, gasping air returned to his lungs and his suit began to recalibrate.
Tony clenched his jaw and nodded tightly. He turned his head to the side to press it against Steve’s and Steve nestled in closer to provide as much comfort as he could to Tony.
Since the Bifrost’s repair, his prince was busily helping bring order to the nine realms.  Many worlds were in peril after being cut off from Asgard for so long. Heimdall always kept an eye on Thor but his gaze was all-seeing and he could see the events on Midgard. He’d always watched Midgard, even before Thor had been banished to its lands.
Coulson saw his indecision and his expression hardened. He stated, "Captain, I'm sorry to say it like this but this is your job. You are needed right now, Captain. Your country needs you, her President needs you. The job is not life threatening and, if you did not have to go on Air Force One, I would have let you take Peter with you...I know this is hard, Captain but you knew it had to happen one day. Every parent has a job and must return to it at some point... But if you still won't do it...I will have to ask you for your shield."
Tony leaned in and kissed him, drawing a happy hum from the larger man as he enfolded Tony into his warm embrace.
Tony huffed sadly and rubbed Steve’s back as he replied, “I’d do anything for you, man…Now, come on. We need to contact my lawyers and start building your defense…”
Steve tightened his hold on Tony’s waist and took a long, steadying breath. He was the team’s leader and he embraced the persona as he stated with authority, “It will go away.”
“What’s Unca Tony doing?” Peter asked sharply, fear laced his voice. He looked up to Steve, his face displaying unmasked concern, and he clutched his toy tightly.
Tony drew away and Steve’s body instantly became cold. He dug his fingers into Tony’s sides and wrapped his legs around him, not wanting him to go. What remained of his once-best shirt hung dejectedly off his arms. Tony grinned down at him then drew off his own shirt. The light of the arc reactor was free to shine and Steve’s gaze was immediately drawn to the cerulean blue glow.
“Thank you…for everything. You saved my life in so many ways,” Steve said, thinking of his fate as the Winter Soldier. Had he escaped it or was he still running from the inevitable?
Bucky scooted next to him and bumped into his shoulder as he replied, “Oh, I think he did…” Bucky paused and then stated, “You’re a great father, Stevie.”
“That looks extremely dangerous and you are not even properly equipped to be handling that stuff upright!” Steve admonished.
He went early to the meeting spot for his date and was surprised to find Wade already waiting and decked out in his Deadpool regalia. He was sitting on the ledge of the twenty story building, with his feet dangling over the edge.
Steve smiled at him but, internally, his heart was hammering a mile a minute and all his mind could say on repeat at that moment was:
Steve exhaled loudly in relief and hovered worriedly beneath the rabbit. Peter was just out of reach and fairly high up. He gasped, “How on Earth did you get up there?”
Tony frowned at him and Bruce reached out and lightly touched Peter’s shoulder. He cajoled, “Peter. Wake up, Peter.”
we can do a weeklong celebration and include it all and I think I have just the perfect place to celebrate.”
After a while however, Wade started giving him this look and he knew they needed to return to his bedroom pronto or risk having his parents find them in a compromising position.
His body was heavily beat up and still aching from his fight with Killian and his heart was heavy from the loss of their Malibu home.
Tears were running down Steve’s face too but he was smiling at Peter. He shakily got to his feet and Vision assisted him part of the way. Steve gasped, “We have a trauma center set up. It – It’s this way.”
“Agreed!” Tony laughed and then paused to consider their options. He groaned, “This is hard! I want to celebrate all those days!”
His mind immediately fell to those who did not have long to live. But even then, it seemed cruel to fill the last moments of their lives with such horror and pain. He walked to the hospital either way. His brain came up with other victims: the comatose, those who were dying in pain, those who had no brain activity, or those who had not heartbeat…Yet he kept making excuses and Venom was getting antsy.
“Yes,” Steve gasped, his nervousness was being obliterated by the escalating build of his rising arousal. Losing nearly all inhabitations, Steve yelled, “Yes, please, yes! Fucking please, yes! Do it Tony!”
Tony’s hands were running up and down his sides and methodically cupping his ass with appreciative hands. Steve’s hands were everywhere. Cupping Tony’s face closer to his, sliding down his torso, and pulling his body up to meet Steve’s.
With the bandages back in place, Tony's reactor's light was hidden and they were free to move. Steve carried Tony to the medical tent and Gabe informed the other medics that Tony had an injury to his chest that Gabe was personally monitoring. Both Gabe and Bucky left them alone as Steve helped Tony settle into the cot and tucked him in.
Peter turned to face his boyfriend and really looked at him. A weariness had settled on Wade like he’d never seen before and he wasn’t smiling. Peter had grown used to seeing a smile adorn Wade’s face every waking moment they were together so it was strange not seeing it.
“F-Fuckin’ peachy,” Tony moaned. He blinked a few times and whispered, “I-I’m seein’ d-dark sp-spots.”
Hell, he was going to change the future to save him. It was a declaration of how strong his feelings were for the man.
“Later, Nat,” he said, side-stepping her to get to Steve. She mirrored his footwork, staying in his way.
The intercom on the President’s desk dinged and a voice said, “We will be taking off in just a moment, Mr. President.”
“Oh Captain, my Captain, why don’t you have a wholesome wife yet? You are just oozing responsibility! Ladies love that!” Tony gasped in mockery.
he also loved Bucky. He had smothered the feelings when he was younger and never reflected on them much other than that they had existed. But Bucky’s declaration had brought them back out in a driving force.
Tony got off his arm and leaned away. What was he doing? Why was he doing this to himself? He’d drunk too much if he was allowing his body to dictate his moves. He put the bottle down on the table behind him.
Coulson dropped them off and promised to come back tomorrow, a few hours before the detective, in order to go over Steve’s statement before the police officer.
“My number two OTP just became canon,” Wade whispered, almost in a dreamlike state as the shuffled out of the main hall with the rest of the attendees.
Tony grumbled nonsense in reply. Steve had been in a good mood all night and now it looked like it leaked into morning.
Dum Dum grabbed Steve's arm and started to do a bastardized version of the dosey-doe. Tony didn't have to have an excuse to watch him as they were now the center of attention, swinging around the tables without a care.
Peter stood up and grabbed his friend again. He started to drag Harry before he fully stood and Harry stumbled into the run. They ran over to the corner of the lab which Steve was very familiar. It was the corner Tony had dedicated to Steve and Peter.
came spewing out of Peter’s mouth as he recognized Steve Rogers, Captain America and the first Avenger. Of course Peter recognized him! Everybody knew who he was! He was a living legend and he was standing at his front door! Peter reiterated when he saw the shocked, confused look on the Captain’s face. “Yes,” he said, speaking more slowly and calmly. “Yes, I recognize you.”
He drove fast and wild, making it near impossible to be shot as he traveled. Eventually, he reached his destination, the street he and Bucky grew up on in Brooklyn. It had changed drastically since he last saw it. The old brownstones, which used to house dozens of families in small apartments, were now mostly storefronts. Some of the larger buildings still had apartments on the upper levels but there seemed to be only young couples living there now. The only families who were on the street were the ones who were shopping at the quaint stores.
Peter was clenching his fists so tightly together that his nails were starting to dig too deeply into his skin. He could start bleeding at any moment. He felt like his voice would be shaky but it came out clear as he stated, “I cannot go outside. I cannot talk to people about my mom. I cannot participate in my internship.
Tony could tell by the look Monty gave him, that he saw through his lie, but the Brit took it with a frown and had left him in obvious insult. Jim outright called him out on it whereas Gabe had been the most subdued and left Tony feeling like the worst human on the planet. Jacques tried to reason with him, reminding him how boring it was on Panzer’s team and Dum Dum…well, Dum Dum sat Tony down with his ration of alcohol and they didn’t talk about the Commandos. They talked about home and Dum Dum complained about how much colder it was here, even in the buildings. He talked about the strength of the American hearth and thick walls of most homesteads. At the end of it all, he left Tony with a nod and reminded him he was welcome back to the team at any time.
Steve followed Tony to his lab and let the older man lead him there by holding his hand. He felt like he was thrust into a dream.
Inbred instinct screamed at him to move forward. His muscles twitched painfully, wanting to move out of his immobile position. That memory of his past torture, which he’d been able to ignore earlier, hit him ten times worse than before as the actual man commanded him not twenty feet away from him. He nearly buckled under the pressure of not moving on Schmidt’s command.
“If we do not feed, I will take control and return to my original host,” Venom whispered in his ear and Steve flinched. He will
Steve replaced walking around the city with Peter to walking around the building. Peter became compliant about the situation. Steve promised to bring him to a larger zoo once the media circus died down.
“No, Jarvis! Call it back!” Peter let go of the wall and fell twice as far, going so fast that the glass in front of him blurred and his stomach became nauseous. When he reached out to the glass in front of him, his hand caught and slid but his body also slammed into the glass, breaking it. He heard a woman scream inside but did not get to see the damage he had done as his grip slipped and he fell.
Instead, he somehow found the strength to play it off as nothing. He chuckled to himself as he stepped away to act as if he had thought of something funny and wasn’t about to just confess his love to the man. Yet, on the inside, he felt like his heart was crumbling.
Steve nearly rolled his eyes. Sneaky was clearly programed with an unfiltered sarcasm chip. He grasped Gibbons’ shoulder and murmured, “Yes, this is it. It goes by Sneaky.”
“Sir, Colonel Fury demands an immediate audience with you. He wishes to know what you just brought into the house,” Jarvis stated. “…As does Miss Potts.”
Tony sat back down on Steve’s engorged cock and placed his hands on Steve’s chest, tweaking his nipples with his thumbs. Steve shuddered under his touch and Tony now knew it was from lust, not disgust. It sent a thrill of desire shooting down his spine and pulsated in his cock.
Tony’s grin slowly fell and then he whispered seriously, “Every time I close my eyes, I see Peter screaming at me.”
was off Peter, any unease he felt was gone. Wade had traced and tasted nearly every inch of Peter’s body but he still felt like he was opening his very first Christmas gift.
“Well, we don’t have to,” Tony reasoned with a frown. An odd pressure formed in his chest as he suggested, “Why don’t we pair you with someone you’re interested in? How about Sharon?”
“Okay,” Tony announced, getting to his feet. “You are no longer allowed to be a martyr. Give me Peter and let the doctors dig those bullets out of you or –
Peter picked himself up and met Wade’s eyes. The merc was smiling at him, his eyes sparkling again, and Peter replied cryptically, “Maybe…we’ll see how the night goes.”
“L-letting in water?” Bruce gasped. The sound of Tony gasping for breath replayed in Steve’s ears and his own memory of drowning in the Atlantic dowsed him back into reality.
Steve flushed furiously. He and Tony had done some heavy petting and dirty kissing but nothing more that even related to sex. It was a whole new realm to their relationship.
Clint was currently in there and trying to get him to answer his questions about Steve’s possible whereabouts but Barnes answered every question the same:
Steve too was on edge and had been in full Captain America mode since yesterday. Steve’s hands on his shoulders were comforting to Tony but he knew they were a comfort to Steve too. They naturally relaxed in each other’s presences. Tony leaned back into his husband and cupped his hand over one of Steve’s tense grip.
Pepper smiled sadly and agreed, “Yes, it all centered around Iron Man. But I know you blame yourself for our failed relationship, yet, I am mostly to blame for it…”
He’d grown so used to Steve’s constant presence that its sudden absence hurt as much as a lost limb. It had been love. He could say that now. He had loved Steve and he struggled with understanding it so he never told Steve he loved him and he was going to regret it for the rest of his life.
Everyone was laughing and jovial and Peter just smiled and smiled and smiled. Beside him Wade did the same and he joined in the merriment without hesitation.
Tony glanced at the image and then murmured, “A way to escape…much more dangerous than the reactor, but, I promise, I’ll be careful. I’ll always come back to you, Steve.” He reaches across the counter and grasped his hand. He promised, “I am here for you as you are here for me.”
are different. You can’t change what happened, but you now have control of your future. Hydra doesn’t have you. You’re safe now.”
Peter heart clenched as did his hands and he whispered, “Please don't talk like that.” He pulled Wade into a tight embrace and buried his face into his neck as he stated, “I don't want to lose you either, Wade. I don't even want to imagine it, so, please, don't ever say it.”
As soon as Steve had looked into his son’s eyes he loved him. Peter represented not only a different life but a family as well. When he woke in the 21
,” Steve cried, scratching at the mass on his son’s face. It covered Peter’s face, and it looked more like Steve was standing in a mass of lumpy tar than with his son. The mass fell from his hands and he could almost make out his son’s form laying at his feet. Steve surged down and screamed, “
His fingers then strayed to the red marks left by the bandages and whispered, “Does it hurt having such tight wrappings?”
He did the one thing he could do. He grabbed Wade’s hand tightly with the hand that had yet to disappear and murmured, “I love you, Wade.”
But Steve betrayed him anyways…and this betrayal hit him harder than anything other deceitful actions made toward him in his entire life.
Steve shook the robot’s hand and a smile broke across his face. He informed the machine, “It will take a lot more to impress me.
As they were pulling into the garage, Steve spotted a few paparazzi catching a few pictures of their car pulling in.
If you want to know what happened but you don't want to read Part 1, here's the super summarized, SPOILERS version:
Steve moved his crotch along Tony’s thigh and his breath hitched from the sudden stimulation. Tony’s free hand shot out and grasped Steve’s hip tightly. He gasped, “Steve??”
Tony had bought a small bed, made for a toddler, with tiny bars on the sides to keep him from falling over the edge. Peter only used the bed for naptime since he always slept with Steve at night. The comforter was red, the sheets and pillow were white, and the mattress covering was blue. When Tony first met Peter he treated Peter like a miniaturized version of Steve and all the original gadgets he gave Peter were always the patriotic red, white, and blue. Later, the gifts became more about Peter’s likes, like the workstation he made him or the action figures of the Avengers.
“I am picking up radio frequencies but the communications I am picking up are odd,” Jarvis continued.
Steve’s hold tightened on him just slightly and his face pinched as he reigned in a flurry of emotions. Tony easily picked out his relief and Steve bowed his head as he hoarsely whispered, “Thank you.”
Tony’s eyes became glassy and he gasped, “If you are bonded to Venom and keep killing th-then we will have t-to – SHIELD will –.”
“Please, call me Natasha,” the SHIELD agent said, holding her hand out to Bucky as he was the closest to her.
Harry shook his head then stared at the sealed doors. Without looking away, he stated, “He’s scarier when he’s sick.”
“Whatever child we end up adopting will love that about you,” Steve interrupted, shocking him silent. A sudden nervous excitement and the overall happiness for the future erased his shocked expression, replacing it with a big smile to emulate his true feelings. They could do it and he and Steve could raise an awesome kid.
He ate his apple breakfast as quickly as possible and, in the deserted elevator, he dropped all social graces and attacked it like a starving man.
Steve’s first reaction was to be impressed. He could count the number of villains on a single hand that had been able to completely overwhelm him like these ordinary humans just did.
Steve was humming happily to himself as he was getting dressed. His run, although emotionally traumatic, was physically refreshing; the hot shower he just took relaxed his muscles; and, oh, he and Tony kissed. Really kissed – not fake kissed – kissed-kissed. As in “Tony was not doing it for the cameras but only for Steve” kissed.
Steve gently took Peter into his arms and his son groaned slightly. Steve had to force himself from removing his mask and checking on him. Peter still had a secret identity and no one other than the Avengers knew Spider-Man and Peter Parker, the infamous, adoptive son of Captain America and Iron Man were one in the same.
Tony frowned deeply, surged forward, and grabbed Steve’s face. Tony pulled them together and they shared a second kiss.
Tony’s eyes flashed with anger and hurt. He stepped up to Steve so only inches separated them and Tony lashed back, “I am putting
He clenched his jaw as he too was overcome with emotion. He buried his face in her shoulder and whispered, “I love you, Aunt May.”
Tony hadn’t done or said anything since. It was further proof that it meant nothing…Not that Steve wanted it to mean something. He had never been attracted to men before, not even Bucky and Bucky was one of the most handsome guys he knew.
To Tony’s surprise, Wade’s cheeks flushed a bright red. He awkwardly replied, “It – um – it’s cool – I mean – thank you? Uh…” He flushed brighter and murmured, “Th-Thank you, Tony…”
Steve secretly watched him for a few seconds, cherishing the love practically pouring out of Tony’s gaze even when he didn’t know he was conscious.
“Wh-What do you remember of me?” Steve whispered, afraid to raise his voice. What little did he remember? Was it good or bad? Was it during the War or before?
Steve grabbed Tony’s face with both of his hands and huskily replied, “I love you too, Tony. I love you so much too.”
Tony swallowed the dry lump forming in his throat as he remembered Jarvis saying those exact words when they first arrived in the past.
! If this were real life, however, Iron Man would be the winner…Right, Steve?” He added when he spotted Steve.
Bruce stepped outside and quickly ushered SHIELD’s doctors inside before Steve could change his mind.
He’d done the one thing Cable had warned him not to do! What was going to happen now?? What was going to change??
Peggy nodded and patted Tony’s shoulder, saying, “You did good. Now don’t move unless you have to. I’ll send a medic to you as soon as I come across one.”
“He’ll be back before dinner,” Tony shrugged it off. Peter hadn’t been getting out in the field recently so Tony was happy he was finally doing what he loved. Tony hooked his arm through Steve’s and murmured, “Since Pete is out having fun and you can’t ask him about his bio-shield, you’re going to help me with finding a gift.”
Natasha knelt beside Bruce and helped him in removing Tony’s gauntlet. Her hands were steady whereas Tony’s were shaking.
“Sorry, is there something you go by?” Steve questioned. Despite its blank face, the robot seemed surprised as it tilted its head to the side. Could it have feelings? Did all the sci-fi comics get it wrong? Did it have emotion?
Steve smiled at him and then rubbed his thumb over the back of Tony’s hand. He leaned in and whispered, “I’m more than ready for it.”
Their host, Mars? No, Marston. He was supposedly one of the most watched talk show hosts in the country and one of the more open minded ones. Steve had never heard of him but apparently Tony had been on the show several times over the decades and they were great friends.
When Wade passed over the threshold, the thick door was slammed shut and several locks clicked into place. There was a loud boom as another door closed and hissing as more locks moved into place.
Steve rolled his eyes at his fiancé. Of course, of all of the the little tidbits of information to latch onto, it had to be that factor. Tony smirked at Steve and pinched his arm in the same spot they’d used in their secret flirtation during the War. Steve wordlessly carded his fingers into Tony’s hand and the nanobots needed no prompting to move so that Steve was holding Tony’s flesh and blood hand. Steve lightly squeezed his hand in a silent promise.
Had he not gone to the past, it would’ve taken him months, maybe even years to have noticed it. But, because he was forced to charge the suit so regularly, the poisoning must have been accelerated.
ask him that!!” Peter immediately hissed back with an edge of panic. He looked around them and groaned, “Where did Wade go? We need that time glove…”
Death caressed Wade’s cheek and felt his flesh grow cold and stiff. As soon as her boney touch left however warmth returned. She sighed heavily, clearly disheartened and crooned, “I was not here for your love but
