“I mean,
Dean pulls up at Singer's Scrapyard. The feel of the bumps and potholes in the road that Baby complains about are as familiar to him as he supposes any home would be; he'd spent years working in and out of this garage, from being a snot nosed little kid to climbing into his car covered in grease and sweat from a long workday laid underneath some old car that needed fixing while he finished his schooling.
John passed by the end of that day, and Sam and Dean were left to sit there, now orphaned.
"Well, it's my wedding," Sam remarks, looking rather pleased with himself, and not that Dean would admit it in this current moment—rather dapper in his tailored suit. "So get used to it."
He senses Dean shuffling, sticking his hands in his pockets. He falls silent. Castiel doesn’t mind.
Castiel tries to hide his smile.
As soon as Cas opens his eyes, it takes Dean every inch of his will not to throw his arms around him. Cas blinks a few times, before slowly pulling himself to a sitting position. He rubs at his eyes, dazed.
Dean grins down at the male sitting on the bench in front of him. "Seemed pretty determined to catch that bouquet, Cas."
John never would have approved of suits or black clothing. He never would've approved of grand funerals or fanfare. It's not really like they had the money to do so, anyway.
Dean turns his head, trying to roll away from Lucifer, but he feels a boot brush over his ribs as he does. A hand grabs at his shirt, and--
When Cas looks up at Dean, his expression is notably softer. He stills says, "You didn't need to do that. I should be--"
He grumbles. “Yeah, yeah, don’t thank me too soon.”
with Anna.
for a
"Hello, Dean." Eileen greets with a smile and a slight lisp. Castiel squints a little, until she turns to him. He notes the slow way that her eyes scan him in the manner that one would to someone who has been aptly described before would be. "And you must be Castiel."
Sam is still stood there, staring at the table. Frozen.
The wedding was beautiful, of course.
“Why didn’t you
"No, it didn't. Jack happened."
“No, this is just a bonus.” She muses, her own wand lowering to point at Castiel. Cas dares to let his eyes glance around their surroundings. She was stood on top the carcass of brick, giving her the high ground. The Alley was quickly emptying, people disapparating or running to floo powder stations. “He saved me because I’m loyal. And he wants you
It’s pouring with rain outside, and Castiel is
And then he gets hit in the head.
“‘Meen.”
Wringing his hands, he takes a few steps forward. A hand grasps at Cas’ shoulder, and Castiel jerks, shoulders hunching.
Dean sighs against Cas's lips, and holds him close. Cas reaches, fingers brushing against arms. He hums. "And I'll choose mine."
If he hadn't been asked to stay behind for ten minutes to deal with a
Before Meg can raise her own, Cas aims his wand at her, muttering
He picks up his quill, and dips it in ink. He writes.
The classroom slowly fills with kindergarten children, and Dean leans back on his chair, grinning at them as they all come in—many of them clutching new toys of their own, running around and waving them at friends whom they hadn't seen over the winter break. Or perhaps they had. To a kid that age, a day probably felt like a lifetime. A few of them wave their presents enthusiastically in his face, and Dean can only pull a smile at them before the kids run off. He wonders if they’ll remember much of these moments—he could at least remember Sammy's delight when they were kids.
“Well, that stings. But I was talking about Hogsmeade.”
“So how long are you out here for?”
Dean does a double take, before he blinks. The gecko. Oh.
dislikes her smirk and the eyebrow waggle she throws at him.
." Dean grunts as Lucifer kicks him, hard, in the stomach. With boots. Then he kicks him again. And again. And again.
Castiel nods, seeming appeased. Dean's unsure why he just told him all that. He motions to the doorway, stepping aside. "Jody had to run to the garden, one of 'em was crying. You know where the kitchen is?"
here should know his place."
It’s Jack, sat at the table, hunched over. He doesn't seem to notice that Dean is there, gripping the pen tightly and writing on paper that Dean recognises as the extra homework he gave to some of the kindergarteners. Jack is concentrating so hard his tongue is sticking out.
the expert out of both of us in this particular matter."
She grins, shuffling some lego half heartedly into a pile with her foot. "New year, new you, Dean. Hark my words."
Castiel steps away, but Dean finds himself stepping in Cas’ direction as he’s about to leave.
"Is Sam okay?--"
Cas grinds the stub under his heel. Dean glances over.
Castiel spits out his drink, choking from unexpected laughter. He wipes his mouth with the sleeve of his robe.
It was him. It was
The snitch is in front of him, mere inches away from his eyes.
Dean nods. “Yeah, I suppose it is.”
Dean pulls away from Castiel with a growl, less than a second away from throwing his bottle at his younger brother—until he sees Sam's shocked expression.
Takes a village.
“Yeah,” Dean replies, deflating. He reaches a hand up and runs it through his own hair. “So it’s a duel, then?”
It is the others who find him first.
“Meg.”
“You’ll never leave detention if you keep making so much noise.”
Dean shuffles
“Hey, you dead there?”
Castiel opens his mouth to protest, and Michael cuts him off. “Rather than making sure that the space was safe from anymore influence of the Dark Arts after the event, you were very much quick to leave the area and attend to someone’s minor injuries instead.”
works. And friends -- we stick up for each other."
"Castiel." He says.
Dean goes to brush by Cas, patting him on the shoulder on his way out. He stops.
"Jody needs her car lookin' at, but I can't get out to her til' tomorrow and she needs it done yesterday. Can you go check it out?"
Castiel ducks his head, and sighs.
The room is neatly arrayed with various toys, unpacked with the efficiency of a pro ikea-assembler. Crafts and activities have all been prepared across the classroom tables, walls stapled in new various motivational posters, such as
“Last of your batch.”
His arms work before his brain does, and he reaches, squeezing Cas' shoulders. They stand there for a long, long moment, and Dean tucks his head against the other male’s neck.
Both of them look up as they recognise they’re within earshot of the brothers. Castiel frowns, while Michael stares at them. He gives a curt nod.
“No one can see us up here, right?” He murmurs, and Cas raises an eyebrow, pushing him away lightly.
"Not sure. Used to work for Bobby—he runs a mechanics shop, dunno if you've met him yet. You stick around any longer you'll run into him somewhere in town, I bet. Grumpiest man in the world, has a baseball cap permanently glued to his head. Can't miss him. Bobby insisted I should 'do something with those smarts' after Sammy went off to law school. I wanted to keep supportin' Sam, but I ended up goin' through school myself while workin’ part time for Bobby. Been rockin’ the teacher life about five years, now."
if he ever makes it out of this.
Within a minute the assault begins to slow, debris piling at bottom of the shield around him. A slow haze of dust rises around him from the plaster, and he slowly crawls to the edge of the shield, wondering why he couldn’t see them any longer - and then he stops.
With some deliberation, he steps over, and sits next to Azazel on the bench. Azazel watches him with some slow curiosity.
“What’re you doin’?”
“Wow.”
“Yes.”
He looks back to Sam.
Azazel lives in some abandoned farm house in the middle of freaking nowhere, because of course he does. It's little wonder that there was so much difficulty in trying to find out where or who this guy was—this guy sure wasn't getting delivery without an extortionate tip required.
“Dean?” Are the first words that come out of his mouth, and Dean actually freezes as a delighted wave crashes on him so forcefully he feels dizzy. He manages to step forward.
." Dean insists. "Just because you're my brother, doesn't mean you know everything about me."
He didn’t have long. A quick trip for some old friends along the alley, before he’d have to make his way back to Hogwarts.
“The Minister wishes to see you.”
what trouble I have with them.”
more fun."
Dean swears to himself. Then; “Could you help me?”
Everyone falls silent as the door opens, and a figure enters. Sam’s shoulders drop in relief as the figure of Jess appears, and her pace increases as she spots Sam. She leans over and hugs him tight as she reaches Sam’s bed.
Dean lays on his bed, arms behind his head. He stares at the picture framed on the wall. A woman with long flowing hair and a chubby cheeked four year old, their heads pressed together as though there's nothing else worth feeling.
"Can I help?" He asks Dean. Dean looks down at his shoes.
He twists his head around, wondering if the man himself was lurking around the corner. He couldn’t see nor sense anything. Of course. Lucifer wouldn’t want to do this sort of grunt work himself.
After a moment, Dean turns and limps off the pitch.
"Congratulations," he says, with as much sincerity as he can give to a man he's just met. Sam acknowledges it with a nod.
“Then that’ll be $14.86.”
They strike the ground with a bruising thump, both yelling as their brooms bounce somewhere off the ground. The shock of hitting the ground has Dean unclench his fist and Cas tackles him, grabbing at his hand in an effort to snatch the snitch from him.
He moves his hand away, but keeps his guard up.
“Lucifer came into the picture not long after Kelly passed away, tried to claim his son, but he was interred very shortly after doing that. But…he’s recently been released.”
shouldn't be approaching this situation without a lawyer."
“Yeet?”
, was the Gecko's name. Dean had given it to him on his first day at school. When Cas had still been so afraid, and Dean told his son there was no need to.
“Alright kids, we got ourselves a match. Professor Novak and I are going to be the Seekers on either team. Claire, seeing as you need to save yourself, you can referee. I’m trusting you with this, alright?” He says, throwing her the whistle. They juggle with it in surprise, but run off with a small
?" He exclaims.
Jack blinks, then looks down at the table. He grabs at the piece of paper to wave it at Dean. "Homework! But it's... it's hard..."
"This better make us even," Dean grumbles.
Azazel gently places down his glass. "What would be the point of removing an entire family with no one remaining to speak on the legacy of my threats? No one to tell the story of what exactly happens when you mess with Azazel, even retired."
She falters. Naomi shakes her head, and turns back to the blackboard
Dean nods, feeling eyes prickle at the threat of his own tears.
He turns his head, Jack’s babbling tuning out, and sees Anna standing at the doorway. She’s staring straight at him, expressionless. A single nod.
“You need to relax. The paralysis potion I used was harmless. Relatively.”
Crowley stares at them. Then he sighs, his feet slipping off the desk as he pushes his chair back.
Sam shakes his head. “Don’t apologise. I think his position gets to his head.”
He feels Cas stare, and Dean feels a hot chill run down his neck. He was half expecting the man to choke his soul out of him and lay him bare.
“Hey,” Cas soothes, sweeping Jack off his feet and propping him on the kitchen island. “What are those tears for?”
Cas barely looks back, eyes sharp, and turns to look at where the snitch has disappeared. Dean follows his eye line, and when their eyes meet again, Castiel smirks. He flies off.
Good Mornings.
Dean's back aches as he settles into the worn leather of his Impala. The heavy doors creak as they shut, and Dean is now sheltered from the world, nothing but the muted drone of cars on the highway nearby and the occasional passerby, normally a staff member going home.
He doesn't hear the cars pulling up. He doesn't see the lights, nor rouse at the scraping at the back door, or the jittering at the window. What finally jolts him out of his sleep stupor is the sound of glass scattering across the tile floor in the kitchen.
“You’ve probably never been in detention before, since you’re all top of the class and that.”
Dean looks up, and now he sees why.
"Well maybe you need to stop depending on someone who's left the profession to make it look as though
The walls crunch and Castiel has less than a second before the plaster erupts behind him. He throws himself face first to the ground, hoping that the water has done its job and doused out the rest of the fire.
"I...am also sorry about your father. I understand it has brought some difficult situations to light."
Eventually, his feet move. He heads through the house and straight out of the kitchen onto the back decking. Dean stands there for a moment until he spots the man sitting on the bench a few feet to the side of him. He's looking to the garden and expanse of land that probably only belongs to him in theory only.
With a roll of his eyes, Lucifer takes a few steps back, and disapparates from Hogwarts.
He watches, arm raised over his head, as the shield shimmers above him as bricks start raining towards him, debris crashing around as some of them shatter on impact. The only thing Castiel can hear outside of the ruckus his is own breathing - something that he’s barely doing.
Cas reaches up, and grabs Dean's robes, pulling so hard to throw Dean away. Dean grabs hold of Cas and refuses to let go, and they both spin in the air.
Cas is watching them, and out of the peripheral of his vision, sees the rubble and shrapnel start rising around him, watches it wobble as it turns, crowding him. He grips his wand, feeling his knuckles whiten.
"You may."
Cas is approaching Dean by the time he glances up, and before he can open his mouth to question him Cas leans forward to peel away the bandage on his forehead, and he can feel his cheeks flush red at the proximity. He
There is a heaving amount of students in front of the walls where the announcements lay; Dean wonders why he is surprised, and why he decided to come have a look now. One student turns, notices him, and jabs their friend in the ribcage. The huddle bursts into giggles.
“Auror Michael’s, actually.”
Either way, Dean doesn't like his prospects. He cuts off the ignition, and slowly gets out of the car—he might not be home, but that didn't mean there wouldn't be anyone
Lucifer comes to a stop. Dean has his eyes squeezed shut as he tries to gather his breath (unable to hide the grin)  and then...
Dean watches him, eyes wide. “So… you ever caught anyone in a high speed pursuit?”
“I, uh—I was there, with Sammy. Visitin’ our mom’s grave. We saw you not far from us visitin’ one too, and I got curious, but didn’t wanna disturb you. I went and had a look afterwards and realised it would’ve been Jack’s mom.”
Dean's face falls. "Why not?"
Sam rolls his eyes, and pulls out another letter—signed, from Crowley. He puts the two pieces of handwriting next to each other.
Cas does nothing but glares as the room echoes with the screech of chairs and polyester bags being dragged along wax floors and both boys shuffling out of the room.
Dean nods, then clears his throat. "Uh, yeah."
Billie cocks her head at Lucifer, eyebrow raised.
Michael pauses. “You’re being distracted.”
“Get ready, boy,” Bobby warns Sam. “He’s Head Auror for good reason.”
"If that supposition is true, then we'll all be waiting a while."
“Sam Winchester, correct?”
, Dean. If he wasn’t so arrogant, he could be the Minister of Magic in a number of years.”
in Lego. It was like a rainbow had decided to regurgitate itself up on half of Castiel's house. He sighs. He's not sure if even
“How’s the kid doing? He runnin' with mom this weekend?” Cas glances up just to see Dean’s face fall, as though he regretted the words falling from his mouth. Cas simply shakes his head, his hands scanning the items purely from muscle memory.
“It, uh. It sounds like you did some awesome things as an Auror. So why’d you leave?”
Dean walks up at that moment, holding out the piece of paper that Jack had handed to him. Castiel blinks down at it.
. Things were manageable. Had to meet and get a few contracts signed every now and again, but what of it? Sometimes I'd have to go visit him
He strides towards the shop, having to push against the crowd fleeing from the scene. He comes to a stop at the body of Samandriel, face down and hair mopped in blood.
." He says.
Dean pulls up to some old warehouse in the middle of God-Freaking-Nowhere. There's no one around except for a mildly surprised security guard staring at the Impala with some level of awe. Dean decides this guy alone gets a nine on the respect rating
“Okay. Let’s go.”
"You've recently been released from prison, and are
"I, uh," Dean stammers over himself for a moment, before he can gather his thoughts. He places the coffee cup down and reaches for the inside of his jacket, pulling John's Journal out. "Uh, my dad, in the hospital — he slipped me this note, some coordinates. He was a marine, it was something he'd do a lot to let me and Sam know where he was headin' next though we never figured out why — anyway, it led to a storage container, and it then to this journal, which is full of stuff about mom, and --" Dean feels his voice crack for a moment. He stubbornly pushes on. "And the last page had this."
It doesn't take long for Cas to frown, his head tilting.
Dean sighs, long. "I'm not. Told you, didn't I? Also might have brought it up with—" It dawns on him how strange this will sound, and he feels heat brushing his cheeks with something like embarrassment. "—with Cas."
“Oh,” Dean mumbles, a bit stunned at the simplicity of it. Had his fate really just been hinged on this man’s idle thought?
“You don’t have to hurt anybody.”
"Receipts. That were given to us."
Dean wonders if he should choose to berate
Castiel then turns to look at him, eyes blue and deliberating. The stitches that smattered the top of forehead were nearly healed, but were barely noticeable from the angle he was looking at him. Cas has a question in his eyes, unspoken. He frowns slightly.
“And Duelling against Dean Winchester will be Chuck Shurley, Minister for Magic.”
Claire grips hold of her wand, trying to ignore the fact that it’s shaking in her hand. She feels hands press onto her shoulders and looks up to see Professor Mills hovering over her, a reassuring smile on her face.
"Yeah. That is true. Shortsighted, of me. If it wasn't for his
into the room, various yells of
"Hey Jack. What are you up to over there?"
Dean has his hands clasped in front of him, unsure how to place himself. He's wearing slim jeans, a buttoned shirt (with the top two undone), and a leather jacket. Cas stares. He looks... stunning. Not something he thought he'd describe Jack's
"Uh, man--"
They stare at each other. Naomi rolls her eyes, and snatches the sheets from him.
“Oh, you’re cute.”
"Well, why aren't
I just wanted to take this moment to thank a few people. Firstly, thanks to MalMuses for always being vigilant in reading my chapters and flailing over feelings. You've been a huge motivator in helping get this done <3
. It is not helpful."
“That shouldn’t be a surprise, Dean.” But he can’t meet Dean’s gaze.
Dean smirks.
The snitch and Cas nearly meet, before it flies out of Cas's reach and flutters up, near Dean. Dean leans down, feeling the breath rush out of his lungs as he swoops down to try and meet it halfway. In his peripheral, he sees Cas flying up towards him.
The children stare at him, but he’s too far away to read their expressions. He edges closer.
And now their Dad was gone, too.
They drive to a diner, one that is tucked away on the highway just outside of town, one that is only often frequented by road trip users, Truck drivers, and those looking for an undisclosed place to meet. Dean swears by it on their way over, particularly as it’s run by someone he’s known since he was a kid.
are you certain of this,
“Did we ever find Chuck?” Sam asks, breaking the silence. The proceeding silence that follows has Dean gripping at the bedpost, irritation clawing at his jaw.
“Hello, Mr. Winchester--Dean.” Castiel - Cas (why’d the guy have such a long name, anyway?) notes, a plastic bag hanging from his fingers.
His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
“Should’ve seen the way Jody turned up late today with Claire, she practically yeeted the girl into the building before sprinting off. Must’ve been on call or something,” Charlie muses, waltzing around Dean’s desk. She comes to a stop. “Oh hey, you got rid of Maximus."
“Unfortunately Michael prefers to only take jobs that end up with him looking like he has nothing to be sorry for.”
“Mr Winchester here gives us all an excellent demonstration of how a duel will not start. Lucifer will not give you ten seconds to avoid staining your best robes.”
He traces the footsteps to a cabinet that is half open; the drawer itself is empty, until Dean peers in with his flashlight, casting it to one thing at the bottom. He reaches in and pulls it out.
Lucifer is being piled on by at least three officers, trying to handcuff him. Dean looks over as—
“Son of a bitch,” Dean mutters, stuffing his hands in his cloak pockets. Wizarding society loved their Victorian-era fashion, but like hell was he walking around without any pockets in his clothes. “Guy doesn’t know when to quit. Did you notice he wasn’t at the second challenge? I wonder-”
"If you're sure." Cas murmurs. He looks at Dean. "I should get going."
son,” Castiel spits. “And part of it is because I know how to deal with a manipulative, lying bastard like you. This is my last warning, or I call the police. Get.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello, Mr. Winchester.”
and unlike what Dean had seen develop from this stoic man; he'd seen that smile in Jack, and Dean feels his heart skip.
Michael holds his gaze for a tentative amount of time. With one final look at Sam, he turns away. “I’ll leave you to think on what we talked about.” He says, and walks behind them, disappearing. Eventually, Castiel looks at Sam.
“Okay, we’ve all been over this part. What I’m lookin’ for is your take-off and landing.” Dean frowns at a few impatient groans. “Alright, alright. I know you’ve done this a million times over but if you forget to oil the bones of what you know you’ll never get up in the sky proper. Not how it’s meant to go, anyway.”
He leans over while in the middle of dinner, while they’re sat in the great hall, murmuring against Dean’s left ear. Dean turns his head, raising an eyebrow. He tries to hide his smirk.
Dean shuffles his hands in his pockets, before slapping two notes onto the counter. “Keep the change,” he murmurs. He takes his items and leaves. Castiel pretends not to watch him go.
"What? I didn't just sit and stare at the ocean while I was serving."
Dean squeezes his eyes shut, lips twisting as stumbles over his next words, before---
Cas pauses in his efforts to look up at the man above him. He blinks as a drop of water from Dean's hair lands on his forehead. Dean is watching him, expression soft. He stills.
clue what his dad could possibly be talking about. He's clutching some monster form of a truck he's created.
"Where?" Cas blanches.
Castiel and Lucifer watch each other.
She turns back around, folding his work.
.” Cas speaks, with the instinctual rhythm of a life-or-death mantra.
“Hey,” He grins, taking a step forward, but falters when he realises that the rest of the crowd have also turned their eyes on him, seventh year boys included. He blinks.
Dean’s door closes with a soft click, with no movement for the rest of the night.
“I haven’t drank anything yet. Jack is staying here for the night.” He mentions. Charlie is already handing him the drink. Cas looks down at the glass curiously for a few moments. He gives it an experimental stir in the glass. With Charlie hovering around him, Castiel tips back the glass and takes a long swig of it. Dean finds himself frozen in place, plate still aloft, watching in… horror? Awe? He’s not quite sure.
“Clearly not enough to be an Auror though.” Meg mutters.
"So detached from your own humanity, can't even reunite a father with his son." Lucifer sniffles. "I can't believe you."
They only make to break apart when they hear the front door to Bobby's open behind them, and Sam's voice:
“Don’t you gotta drive too?”  Dean blurts out. Cas just looks at him, steadily.
He eventually reaches and grasps at Cas' wrist, looking at him, but doesn't move Cas' hand.
Dean shuffles next to him, the width of the stairs not made for two men and so their knees jostle, thighs pressing against each other. Silence sinks between them for some time, bar the hopeful calls of birds in woodlands beyond the camp, Cas’ gentle sighs as he smokes, and the precise clatter as Dean cleans his gun.
“Oh. Uh, I--”
) throws him back into consciousness.
The thought that had bubbled in the back of Dean's mind regurgitates itself so forcefully that Dean barely realises the guitar is snatched from Azazel’s hand and gripped now in his own, splintered over the balcony railing. He stares down at the desecrated remains before dropping it, grabbing Azazel by the scruff of his shirt and slamming him against the side of the wall, holding him up to eye level.
It was something that should have been birthed in a film, really. The day had been perfectly beautiful, the sun shining, smiles everywhere. Even Bobby pulls out a handkerchief, dabbing at his eyes. Ellen squeezes his hand, gently, sitting aside of him.
Anna hangs up before he can. Castiel stares at his phone, as though it will tell him his next steps.
Bobby sighs, slapping the journal back on the Kitchen counter. He's almost forgotten about the beans on the stovetop, and curses as he goes to stir it and finds it's started sticking to the bottom. He stirs it for a few moments, thinking deeply.
good, and you nearly just got a child
The quill scratches on the thick parchment. Professor Singer sits at his desk, pausing for a moment to dip the quill in the ink. His penmanship is slow, and a little shaky, but trained.
"Stay with me, Jack," he murmurs.
Cas squeezes his eyes shut, feeling sick. His fists flex, unsure whether he wants to punch the wall or scream.
“Ah, the infamous Winchesters.”
in front of him, course he’s gonna get mad—”
to jump out and try and kill him. His hand inadvertently hovers over the gun in his waistband.
He turns back to the small crowd just as they all step back, Cas sighing loudly. He looks round and catches Dean staring at him. Something in the back of Dean’s mind tells him he should at least try to look away.
Is mortals' chiefest enemy."
Cas looks down, holding onto his mug significantly tighter, and falls silent. The silence is so prolonged that Dean is about to cough, change the subject — and Cas opens his mouth. He stares at the table between them.
She stands, unmoved.
Dean shrugs and forces a hard gulp of the beer. "Yeah, s'pose I do. Pays a bit better to help Sam out until he passed his bar exam recently."
Castiel has to turn his head, save Jack see his surprised expression. "Oh, did she now?" He exclaims, silently tucking away a note to maim his sister the next time she saw him. He'd expect that behaviour from
“Hey.” He feels a hand on his arm. A groggy blink, and Jody swims into view, sat at the end of his bed.
doing a good job."
Jody bursts  into the room, gun unholstered, pointed.
Sam, Dean and Claire all scatter in suppressed panic to a respective station. Dean immediately grabs onto a glass beaker and finds himself staring at the ingredients, unable to clear his mind free. He can hear Claire swearing beside him, and ignores his ‘teacher instinct’ to threaten a loss of house points for foul language.
Sam flies by him, precariously to say the least, waving his arms at his hair. Cornish Pixies. Chasing him.
"Michael," he greets. Michael narrows his eyes.
The spell never hits, and he opens his eyes (not realising that they were closed to begin with) and sees the outline of Castiel’s shoulders in front of him, and a haze of light in between them and Lucifer. It wasn’t light. It was
, did this man have
“Holy shit.” He mouths, and his wand fumbles in his fingers.
Dean pulls up in his usual spot just beside the driveway, cutting the ignition off only after the song he's currently listening to finishes.
"Silence," Billie speaks, holding a hand up to Crowley. "I think you may have a point. It indeed does not look good in Lucifer's favour to be put under investigation so soon after being released. Do you have anything to say?"
Dean freezes.
“It was… a lot, to ask me to alter her charm on the blackboard, just for a small advantage. I could’ve helped—”
He goes to turn back to his desk, but in the midst of it finds his gaze drifting back over to the stretchers, and finds himself looking at Cas, so still.
"Well, we can figure it out, then decide what to do from there." Sam notes. He stares at Dean. "No going off in the middle of the night, yeah? We don't know what we’re going into.
Dean watches as Castiel stands up, and while weak, he at least has enough clarity to now look at the man before him. He doesn’t know whether to be unsurprised that the professor hasn’t changed out of his work robes for the day, but here he is in the same sweeping cloak and dark waistcoat. Dean wonders when he started taking such an interest in fashion. Castiel looks at him expectantly. He shrugs.
"Yes, yes, you got me. I’m bloody done with him."
Dean grunts as Cas manages to kick the end of his broom, jerking him into some of the scaffolding. Dean untangles himself from the stand, adjusting his balance, and he looks down.
Jack stops and stares at the small plaque that is in front of them. The fresh bouquet of flowers is only just starting to wilt, no doubt revived by the recent rainfall. Castiel stares at them for a moment, eyes narrowing. He looks at his own fresh bouquet.
Castiel nods, squeezing his eyes shut - and dammit, if Dean can't feel the well of tears surge in his own. Dean leans in, and they kiss, Dean drawing Castiel in tight.
Cas gives him a deep look as they eventually unravel from the embrace, unspoken words imprinted in the creases of soft breaths and fingers pressing in worn leather. Dean inclines his head, and tries a small smile.
He winds down the window.
He steps down. In the midst of looking towards his brother, Dean catches Cas’ expression.
“Hey,” Dean soothes. “It’s gonna be okay. I’m not gonna let Lucifer near him again, and something will work out, I’m sure of it. Hey, uh.” Dean swallows, debates on removing his hand. “My lil’ bro actually just graduated from law school. Passed his bar exam and everything.  If I ask, I’m sure he’ll help out. This sort of thing is kinda why he wanted to get into it to begin with.” Dean chuckles. “Was always a smart kid.”
She looks down at her phone.
“Hey. You alright there?”
“That’s not what I hear the students say.”
. But why was the note given only to him? Dad and Sam didn’t exactly get on towards the end, but he was his fucking son just as much Dean was. Was Dad trying to protect Sam in some way, considering what was going on? It was as much an order as anything else.
Castiel falls quiet. Dean pulls him tighter. “But what I was gonna say is – it’s even more weird to think that we were both here, as kids, and, I dunno. I know we kissed even back then but nothin’ came of it, and then we all left Hogwarts and the stuff with your family… did
Dean looks down at the half finished remains of Sam’s potion, and smiles grimly to himself.
Cas seems to fall silent. Dean rubs at the side of his jaw in thought. "Uh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you… wanna talk about it?"
"This journal belongs to a recently deceased person, of whom the cause of death is suspicious. There are dubious links of Lucifer's involvement to this 'Azazel'. In light of Lucifer's recent release from prison, this hardly looks like good standing for Lucifer to be in place of custody, does it not?"
Kids, man. Force you to make friends whether you want to or not. He wonders if he'll ever have that
anymore. Think you forget that with your ego sometimes.”
“I’m assuming you were incapable to defend yourself?”
“Master Winchester, you’re on the list.”
Dean provides her with a lazy grin. “Those are the instructions you left for us, ain’t it?”
In his peripheral Dean can hear Jack screaming, a screech of
"Boo! Sir, you should teach us! It'd be right fun! Bet you're great at quidditch"
There’s silence as Jack leaves, before Dean, who'd been frozen the whole time as though watching the Gods themselves work in front of him, clears his throat. “You’re really good with him, y’know?”
He takes a swig, only to find Bobby staring at him. Dean blinks. "Yeah?"
"Well, what are you going to do about this, Professor? ... Or are you too chicken for a rematch, Novak?"
He falters.
Sam strolls towards the judge’s desk with the envelope, in a sealed plastic wallet. He presents it to the judge, who then opens it, pouring out the numerous pieces of paper and invoices.
Dean looks back to Cas, then jerks his head towards Michael with a squint. Dean is so busy looking at Michael, eyes narrowed as he scrutinises him, that he almost walks straight into Chuck. Dean staggers back in slight surprise at a small cough and looks down to see Chuck looking up uneasily at him.
Sam sighs, taking a moment to stare out at the grounds beneath them on the bridge. “You, and Cas--”
“Castiel.”
“I don’t think Castiel has anything to apologise for,” Sam comments, as he casually approaches. “Professor Singer would have hired him for a reason. If Bobby trusts him, then we should.”
"A Thestral." Cas murmurs, watching in awe.
“Oh, yeah. Got a new kid today, Jack. So I gave him the gecko to keep him company while he settles in. He’s called Tony now."
Dean swallows the cheese cubes, hard. He winces as they struggle down his throat. “Dean,” He repeats. “You can just call me Dean. Told you that before."
"Bow ties are for losers," Dean mutters, feeling the cloth being affixed around his neck. Some older man peers up at him behind thick rimmed glasses. Dean has to find everything in himself not to pull a face at the presumptuous guy.
“Here, take this.” Castiel says, pulling a piece of foil out from his robes, and it takes Dean a moment to realise that he’s being offered chocolate. Weakly, he takes it.
“You didn’t just
incident at the gas station, and then if Gabriel hadn't called in a last minute favor to pick up some stock for the bar, and then if the rain hadn't called everyone and their godmothers to sit in the highway, then he'd have been
Jack, completely oblivious, perks up. “Hey, it’s Daddy!”
"Anyone home?" Dean calls out. Ellen is standing with her back to him, hovering over a grill. Jo is tucked in some corner, wielding a knife against some vegetables. He thinks twice about making her jump. Dean smiles. "Hey. How're the girls doing back here?"
"Did you kiss Mr. Winchester?" Jack asks, boggle eyed. Cas sighs.
He knows Kelly would probably have laughed at that comment, and lightly questioned about whom the real father was. And Castiel would have rolled his eyes.
Dean slides into the seat opposite Cas, grinning. Castiel isn't sure he's ever seen the man smile so much. Dean clasps his hands together on top of the table, fidgeting with one of the rings on his fingers. “She’s great, huh?”
Dean glances back at Cas, briefly, before tossing Charlie the bar of chocolate. She catches it with a fumble. “It’s not everyday you have someone literally save your life seconds from death. Wanted to make sure he knew how grateful I was.”
“I did not lose.”
"Eileen!" Dean exclaims, grabbing her into a bear hug. "It's been a day too long since I last saw ya’."
When Castiel enters the kitchen, Dean slams a bunch of cheese into his mouth, freezing when they make eye contact.
"Wedding?"
"What?" Dean asks.  "Wouldn't be doing it for five years if I didn't."
Cas looks at him.
He feels Sam stare at him, eyebrow raised, and something in his subconscious wriggles uncomfortably. Dean wheezes.
“–Please don’t leave. Me.”
Cas then stares at Sam, with the rather petty look of ‘He’s
Rain patters hard on the windows to the great Hall, flickering light of the candles illuminating the two dozen students amassed in a large crowd. Their murmurs hush into silence as Castiel steps onto the platform.
Sam glances up as a figure looms at his doorway. He blinks with some shock as he realises that it is the Head Auror.
The snitch dances along the pitch, waltzing its way around one of the towers. Ahead of him, Cas abruptly alters his course to fly around the opposite side of the tower, hoping to meet it on the other side. Dean flies up, and skirts along the top of the tower until he's overhead.
Castiel lays his heart on the table, gives Dean what he asks, but as he speaks and anger curls at his chest, all Dean can find himself doing is… looking. Looking at Cas, the soft laughter lines against his eyes creasing as he frowns, the way he rubs calloused fingers against the stubble on his cheek. The way he curls over his drink, his waistcoat and grass-stained robe dwarfing him for once in his life.
Cas swims into mind, pinned underneath Lucifer, bloody. Unconscious. He visions his own hands, covered in blood.  He drops Chuck.
Any murmurs silence as Bobby sweeps into the room. They all look at Bobby expectantly, and Bobby doesn't waste any time.
“Well, it’s uh. It’s a bit late for that.” He manages to murmur, before images of Cas, unnaturally still on the stretcher flash into his mind. He squeezes his eyes shut for a moment. “What do you think we should do?”
Cas had once been a medic, while he served. His role was to defend, to heal. But even medics had to make use of their weapons at times, in order to protect those they cared for.
Dean looks at the display that Cas has set up. He grins at him.
“Yeah! We played with dinosaurs and had a tea party and baked some cookies and — though the cookies were for the tea party — and we had a guest to our tea party! Uncle Lucifer!”
"Do you enjoy it?"
“I do understand humour, Dean.”
Michael looks at him, steadily. "You can't prove anything, Winchester."
"Hey, Sammy. Cas," Dean notes, and Cas finally looks at him. They stare for a moment. "How're things?"
“So there’s no Head Auror?” He questions. He glances down for a long moment. “Does that mean there’s an opening?”
“Dean,” He murmurs and leans in, holding his name in his lips. Dean hums, tasting how Cas holds it.
“Yeah, but you

asleep.
Cas shakes his head. “Don’t worry about it. People react differently under stress.”
“No problem.”
Quiet nods, some murmurs, and Dean motions to the line he is looking at. A chorus of ‘up!’ echo, brooms flying to hands, and the shuffle of positions being taken. The acquired grace of flying makes it very obvious what students had been brought up as a muggle, or at least rich enough to own a broom. Even though he’d picked it up remarkably quickly, he remembers the pre-teen shame of those first few lessons.
He pauses, glancing around at the class.
“I asked for two sheets, Castiel.”
The bookshop has collapsed, flames crawling their way around bodies slumped on the floor. A frightened mass of people stampedes down and away from chaos. Cas draws out his wand.
“You have control over this. You don’t have to hurt anyone. I’m not here to hurt you.”
"Sam left not long ago," Cas finally, finally gives him an answer. "I believe he went on a grocery run. He thought you were asleep."
missed you."
"Right, so. I'm going to need as many details as I can. About what happened, about what you did, about the situation you find yourself in now. If you have any physical evidence on you that would be great, otherwise I'll need as much as that as soon as possible. Then I'll have to take it back to the firm and hopefully be able to take on your case personally."
at him.
Dean is a bit lost, to say the least, and it's at least a minute that passes before he realises that he's still stood in the doorway, staring like some idiot. Eventually he shakes his head, and curiosity outgrows his need for sensibility.
Cas rolls his eyes, appears a little sheepish as he elaborates. “When I was still a student here, this is where I would frequently come to find some quiet and to avoid others, especially when others made it abundantly clear that they didn’t want to be around me either.” He pauses, glancing down. “But… I have little need to keep this place private, now.” He concludes, gazing at Dean. “and it’s such a beautiful view.”
“Yes, yes, of course. I just wanted to go back over the details. Lucifer has been… rather silent since the attack in Hastings. I understand your difficulty with the Dementors, but I do think it best to keep them. If only I could get away with that closer to the Ministry.” Chuck sighs, longingly. “Obviously the tournament is a prime target for any attacks - as the main challenges being out in the grounds.”
It's one of Lucifer's loons making that exclamation, and it's panicked enough to stop his assault. He turns around slowly.
“Hell yeah.”
Mr. Shurley just nods, glancing down at an approximate point on the carpet. His whole posture is almost rigid, though, and something uneasy settles in Dean that he can't quite place.
.” Dean growls. “How is this helpin’ anyone?”
Jack looks up then with wide eyes. "Claire?"
Castiel's expression falls and he wavers, as though Jack had punched him. "What?"
Dean rolls his eyes. He grumbles. “Imma yeet you in a minute.”
“A toast, to a graceful loser.” Dean remarks, taking a deep drink. When he lowers the mug Cas is glaring at him.
They come to a sudden stop, panting, and realise that they have their wands pointing at each other, pressed in at the bottom of their jaws. Staring.
Cas stares back. Dean feels a grin creeping back into the edges of his lips – before the form of the figure on the bed catches his eyes.
This is no funeral.
“Nah, she could’ve caught us talking. Besides, isn’t it way more satisfying knowing that you could counter the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor’s own charm?”
Thing is, Dean loved potions as a student, not that he’d ever admit at the time. He picks up some root of some bizarre vegetable, throwing it into the bowl to start crushing it. The faint tinges of muscle memory start easing in, and Dean nods to himself. He looks back up to Sam.
Hesitantly, he holds up his own wand. He manages to glance at Cas with a small smile but doesn’t catch Castiel’s eyebrows suddenly raise. He turns back, swings his wand down beside him, then turns around. Dean counts his three steps towards the edge of the arena, staring at the ground to make sure he doesn’t overstep the boundaries – swinging towards his competitor;
“Alright, that was j-”
Dean braces himself for the pain jolting through him, tensing up as his stomach is aimed again, and again. Tears well in his eyes from the pain. His stomach convulses.
Eileen smells it before she can see it. She'd become distracted, folding away the hurricane of notes that Sam had in his folder. She didn't let herself read them, but oh my
"Hello, boys. To what do I owe the pleasure of your..." He sweeps his gaze, “
are still learning.” She mutters, turning around. Dean strides by her, grinning. Castiel is walking behind him, looking distinctly like he’s already lost.
Castiel stares down at the plaque for a few moments. Jack tumbles off, distracted by something a little further down the row. Normally, Castiel would let him wander a little, but today he grips on.
Dean glances back at Cas. Castiel looks at him, steadily. He looks to Sam, and nods. "Yeah, sure."
resisting the urge to touch the small of his back as they wander back to Hogwarts, shoulders pressing together.
“—and the rest of humanity.”
"I'll help you." Cas murmurs. "You help me, I'll help you." He looks at Dean. "Deal?"
Bobby looks at him quickly with a glare. "Hold yer horses, boy. Let me finish." He turns the stove off, the steam curling into the paint cracked ceiling. "'Course I had an idea. One of the first things that happened  after the fire was John bringing you boys here."
They have both seen their share of endings, both chosen, and chosen for them.
“Winchester,” he voices, glances at Dean. “How are you?”
Dean watches Castiel go, and feels himself frowning.
“Hey, lookin’ good. Wanna tell me more?”
"Oh, great," Dean mutters, because of
Dean takes off the handbrake and looks behind him as the bass of the engine roars under his feet.
in the room even from what is probably a half concussed state. Then the thought slams into his mind, and terror overtakes
Castiel smiles, straightening. “Meet me outside my room at dark.”
He needed to head to Gabriel's bar, he didn't really have time to--
Dean, hesitantly, turns his head back to the lake. “No, suppose I don’t.”
Dean runs a thumb on the small of his back, and with a shaky sigh, hums into his hairline.
But not enough to wrap his arm around Cas’ shoulders.
Cas shakes his head. "I can't. I know him, I can't. I can't win this."
Castiel was pale, alright, but he was clearly a step above death. Not by much, if the whimpers, and the cold sweat on the forehead said anything.
Castiel pushes open the door to the Gas N’ Sip as he makes his way to his car. The can of whatever off brand energy drink he could grab from a shelf hisses as he pulls on the tab, and he takes a swig of it. He places it atop his car once he approaches. Castiel leans against the door handle and sighs. That run in with Jack's teacher was the last thing he needed to concern his thoughts right now. He’s not sure himself why he acted so abruptly. Maybe it would be easier if Mr. Winchester — Dean, was it? — knew about it. It was a little presumptuous to think that Dean
They slowly rise to their feet, Crowley peering over them both with a raised eyebrow. Dean throws him a grin, shrugging.
The purr of the Impala pulls up at exactly 7pm, and Cas restrains himself long enough to wait until there's a knock on his door.
“Dean.”
Castiel leans down, and ruffles his hair. “You will, but Aunt Anna really needs your help. Think you can do it?”
“S’pose you’ve got a whole heap more portraits in your office, eh?” Bobby asks, when the pause becomes too long. Chuck almost startles, head jerking back to the Headmaster. He quickly shakes his head.
Cas shrugs with one shoulder, because of course he knew he was already there. "Jack was very insistent that I catch it."
"Get the bloody hell out of my office then, would you?"
“That kid is gonna grow up to be a feisty one, I swear.”
"Oh," is all Anna says, gaze lingering on Jack—who for what it was worth, was concentrating on that apple juice with some
“… Thanks, Cas. Appreciate it.”
with a blanket laid on the ground. With some small flick of the wand he lights up a small lantern, highlighting Cas’ jaw.
Castiel gives a short nod, returning the handshake after a slightly awkward, "and you're Sam."
"Night, mom," he murmurs.
Dean manages to straddle the one he's struggling with as they hit the floor, throwing a few punches at his jaw for good measure, before he reaches up to try and clutch his throat. Dean grasps his wrist and twists back, hard, which earns a loud scream from Bastard #1. With a moment of opportunity, Dean throws himself in a flail for the gun that's just out of hands reach, balancing precariously on the edge of the landing.
The whole stadium is fit to bursting, despite it being a very overcast day. Dean had been out a lot in the quidditch pitch, so it wouldn't surprise him if it was going to start raining later. They
Dean shrugs with one shoulder. "Yeah, well. Kid needed help, so I helped."
Dean blanches. “I got enough on my plate already. I don’ wanna step on his toes more than I already have—”
Dean shrugs. “Hey, even if it is your dick bag of a brother, I’m sure I could handle him. No biggy.”
“---And that
"Ah. The ‘father’, come to find his prodigal 'son'." He even does the finger quotes. Castiel's expression is pure death.
“Alive.” Castiel responds. “Unfortunately, still incapacitated.
"Nice to meet you, Eileen." Castiel signs to her, much to everyone's surprise—except Eileen, who is
“For saying something. There aren’t many who would do something like that.”
He looks up, cutting off Cas before he says anything for the silence. “Does Jack remember anything?”
When Cas finally lifts his head, blue eyes holding onto him, Dean forgets how to breathe.
of Dean's, even the ones Dean doesn't know himself. Dean is all of a sudden afraid.
"That's a foul," Dean mutters, voicelessly, but he isn't the referee of this game. And neither does he find himself caring. In their wild flailing Dean catches the snitch out of the corner of his eye, hovering over some of the benches by the Ravenclaw stand. He uses Cas to launch himself away, but Cas is only moments behind him, and they crash into each other in the side of the stand, ripping the fabric of the Ravenclaw insignia as they try to knock each other out of the way.
watching red go to green and see the homeless community limp around damply in the rain around them.
Dean blinks, rubs a thumb against the scruff of his beard.
Cas’ jaw drops,  and it’s his turn for his shoulders to draw up, tight. He scowls.
of his dignity.
Dean frowns, glancing at Castiel. “I mean, that’s what I’m tryin to do. With various levels of success, as you’ve seen.”
"... I suppose." Cas says slowly. "I... suppose 'friend' also works."
Chuck stands before the desk, fidgeting for a moment. He eyes the parchment, before hesitantly taking his seat. “Do you not use a charm to let the quill scribe for you? I mean - I always found it a pretty cool trick, being able to do that, I mean.”
The combination works, and Dean pockets the lock as he pulls the door open with a creak. He was already regretting not having Sam around, but he was working. And...uh, he hadn't told him yet.
Chuck Shurley, while certainly capable in some ways, was not so much in… others. A capable duellist was not one of them; he would’ve been part of the Aurors if that was the case, especially with the events of the last few years.
"We all got enough on our shoulders, it's what I'm trained to do. Practically taught my own little brother how to read and write too." Dean remarks, waving a hand at him in dismissal. Castiel looks a little uncomfortable.
Dean finds himself smiling wryly. “Well, looks like that’s sorted then, yeah?” He nods his head towards the door, and Lucifer reluctantly turns to leave. As he walks out, the man and Cas share a look. Dean’s pretty sure he just witnessed attempted murder from Castiel.
Dean stares at him for a few moments. He wordlessly pulls Cas into a hug, pressing his face into the crook of the Auror’s neck. He squeezes him, taking his first breath against his shoulder in what feels like days.
“Yes -- You shouldn’t be questioning my decisions, Mr Winchester.” He says, confidence assured. Sam holds his hands up in indignant resignation.
From his crouched position, Dean casts a spell. Silently.
"You're soaking. And you're letting the rain in."
If the curse was sustained enough that Castiel was simply dealing with constant, excruciating pain, then maybe a distraction would help. Or maybe Dean needs the distraction much more than Castiel would ever need.
Castiel nods, and they walk. Dean shrugs. “You shouldn’t need to be the one to apologise for his behaviour, anyway. That’s his job.”
"Your Honor, if I may—lifting Jack so crudely from his current living environment, especially during such a crucial time in his development when there is in fact nothing wrong with it--"
The door is ajar as he approaches. He pushes the door open and peers in, quietly. The furniture is well-worn but good quality. The wallpaper hasn't been replaced in some time. Whole house needs a fresh lick of paint. Dean pulls out his phone. Blinking reception. Typical.
Dean frowns.
Cas nods. "You
The student is stared at.
The arena falls silent. Dean turns to stare at Cas. Cas doesn’t know what to do, and helplessly shrugs. Chuck had been one variable, but a very minor one. He looks to Sam, who’s watching with even more bemusement than Dean is.
"It's the same handwriting, and you know it." Castiel cuts in, with a growl. "You left those invoices on my car window. You want Lucifer gone."
Lucifer pauses over him. "You have no right asking me about my
Dean finds him outside. As best man he'd been running around most of the day looking after things so Sammy didn't have to, and this was one of the first moments of reprieve he'd found to go outside, tucking his blazer over his arm and sighing gently at the breeze bringing relief.
Dean is sitting outside on the hood of the impala. The sun is starting to set. He takes a swig of his drink. He hears footsteps approach from beside, but doesn't question them.
Dean feels hair prickle on the back of his neck. "But it didn't work. You didn't kill my brother."
Sam raises an eyebrow. "Wow. Either he
a strange young man," he notes. They both look out the veranda in silence for a few minutes.
"What are you doing here, Mr. Winchester?" Castiel asks.
Jack recoils for a moment, shuffling behind his father's leg as he peers up at Dean. Dean gives him a warm smile. "I'm Mr. Winchester. I'll be your new teacher. It's all cool if you're scared though, I can be pretty intimidating." He reaches around behind his desk, grabbing something. "I got a friend for you, though, who will never be scared of me or anyone else."
Anna rolls her eyes. "You can do more than just look after Jack, you know."
Ellen emerges at the kitchen doorway before Sam can end his family line.
stretched out. Part of him didn't want to.
Lucifer pauses, before turning into the room. He presses fingers to his own heart, a softly mocking expression. “What? How rude, Cassie. Little old me just wants a family visit—”
Cas watches him with the smallest of quirks to his lips, taking a sip with a glint in his eye.
to try that sometime.”
It's a small blinder, and as Dean lays it on top of the metal frame of the cabinet and flicks it open, it is almost
right to command the amount of attention he did from Dean, but he found himself unable to resist it. Was that what had Dean so on edge?
He throws as much power behind the spell as he possibly can, and as Cas drops all his spells, water pours out from Dean’s wand, a torrent towering towards Lucifer.
Dean nods. “Yeah, okay,” he says, softly.
Cas chokes, blood in his throat, eyes glassing--
He pauses for a bit too long, but there is still enthusiastic clapping. Chuck clears his throat.
She glances back.
“How are you informed of that identity?”
He strums a few notes, resting it on his knees. "A song, to this meeting." He gives a nod, and starts playing.
"Yeah. He kept insisting that I should join them, but I mentioned you'd opened house for Claire's birthday, so I was headin' up here. Otherwise we’d both just be acting sad ‘round each other."
They are charming the platform away, when Dean glances up. Noticing that Dean has stopped what he is doing, Castiel turns around. He frowns.
Cas forces his gaze to look at Dean, eyes wide from the strain. He stares at him for a few moments, and despite himself, Dean can’t help but give a reassuring wink.
Castiel slowly shuffles around the corner when the children don’t move, and lowers himself to a crouch. He glances at his wand, and a soft light shines from the end of it. The children turn to look at him.
Sam watches Dean as he strolls off in front of him, shoulders hunched. Sam sighs.
"You know that Ellen would probably just give you your lunch for free if you turned up to her diner?"
"Yeah, I knew about that."
He catches Sam and Cas staring at each other, and Dean frowns.
Anna's looking at him with a frown when he lowers the towel. "What? Why?"
Castiel shrugs. "He picks up on things even if they're not being said. Most children are like that." Castiel glances at him. "You should know that by now."
He can't exactly
idea.”
“It’s Dean.”
forgiven him yet for the whole not-telling-him-about-Dad thing. He estimates it'd take some awful practical joke and then Sam will be satisfied. The joke hadn't come yet, so Dean was trying to not feel too paranoid about it.
Students line up either side of him on the pitch, facing each other. Brooms sit on the floor to their right hand side, and Dean grasps his hands behind his back.
She adds ‘Following’.
“Yeah! Though he said to call him Uncle Lucy, which is more of an Aunt name, but I said okay!”
“Hey, look at this sexy son of a bitch,” he calls out, waving the magazine around.
“Now where’s my hug from the man of the hour?” Sammy leans down and she pulls him in tight, patting him on the back. “Congrats, Sam. You’ve found a good one.”
They pull in, and when they enter, a soft and weathered lady called Ellen greets Dean with a hug that somehow manages to envelop him despite him almost being twice her height. Dean bashfully introduces Castiel to her, hand pressing hard if inconsistently against Cas’ left shoulder blade. Ellen gives him a look over before smiling and pats a hand on his bicep, guiding the both of them over to an empty booth at the end of the diner. “Bill is on me, boys, for tonight only” is all she says, with a pointed look at Dean, before disappearing back into the kitchen.
Dean is left to stare at Castiel, who is still on the doorstep.
Dean gives a nod. "Thanks."
Jody snorts, folding her arms. “Not the worst idea I’ve heard from you. But what I do hear is that there is a Dueling club starting up, in response to recent events happening at Hogwarts — and, well, the wider wizarding community.”
“I can’t believe—wha?”
Hairs stand on the back of his neck.
"What?" Dean asks, shakily. "You're just gonna...give it to us?"
“… What? This face ain’t just for show.” He remarks, a soft wink, and he falls quiet. He feels Cas shrug beside him.
Lucifer looks up to Castiel. Tears fill his eyes. “But I just want to see my son. He’s my son, Castiel. I just want to tell him how much, how much I’ve missed him, how much I lov—”
"Say Hi to Mom, Jack."
make sure no student gets hurt. Swear my life on it, Cas.”
Dean raises his hands in defeat. He blows breath between his lips in a slow whistle. “Okay,
They both look down, and wait for the whistle. Dean hunkers his shoulders down, leaning against the broom as close as possible…
"Dean's fine, as I've said." Dean grins. "Castiel, right?"
It doesn't take long for her to dismiss that—Sam had clearly been extremely tired when heading to bed, and this smoke smelled too...heavy.
Chuck gives a small, nervous nod, before turning away and heading down the staircase. Bobby watches him until the statue falls into place, silent.
Jody lived on the edge of town. It helped, having a bigger space, considering she somehow managed to balance being the sheriff while also juggling three small daughters, though Donna would generally swing by  as the pseudo co-parent.
“Hm,” he says. “Not quite what I had in mind, Castiel. I was hoping you’d be just as easy to convince as Michael over there.”
“I don’t.” They say, simultaneously. They blink at each other in shock.
Castiel grunts, trying to pry the sodden Winchester off of him. "
“Why are
Feeling light, Dean asks Cas after the practice has finished whether he wants to join him for a drink at the Three Broomsticks. Cas, red-faced and eyes bright from the match, nods at him with a smile.
Dean runs into Cas later in the kitchen; or rather, he comes across Dean lurking in the kitchen, trying to smuggle leftover snacks that haven’t been put out yet.
Other wizards dressed in scrubs hurry by him as he winds down the corridors of the hospital. When he reaches the correct floor, a gentle looking male approaches him. Dean tries hard not to think of Cas.
"I will get them," Eileen insists, and pushes him out of the door before he can protest.
Jody opens the door, and her expression softens when she sees Dean.
an indicator of someone’s fate, Professor. I believe you’re wrong on that.”
Cas sighs. "Unfortunately, yes. It's...complicated."
“It’s on the house, Sammy,” Ellen notes, disappearing back into the kitchen.
“There are things I have to carry alone, even now.” Cas cuts in, a dead stare. The hallway is quiet, the muted sounds of birds calling from beyond the archways they were stood between. “We saw what happened to Michael. I’ve seen what happens when
Dean collapses onto one of the chairs with a dramatic sigh, backpack crumpling beside the old desk. He subtlety (or not so subtly) eyes the other boy, who has his back to him at a desk just further up in the room. They are the only two occupants there, aside from a lone piece of chalk that is currently writing lines on the blackboard in front of them. Writing lines. Detention could be worse, he supposes.
Soon to be just his.
, Cas.” Dean raises his arms, motioning to the other man. “You keepin’ something like this – makes me wonder if that’s really the case.”
"We didn't know what else to do, he'd gone for us, he was surprisingly good--"
He doesn’t need to look at Sam to know what he’s doing.
Sam, but he can sense him hovering in the kitchen on the other side of the room. The rest of the apartment is dark but for one of the lamps in the kitchen silhouetting his figure. It was like Sam was
of you up to the Headmasters office on claims for expulsion. These are very dangerous times were are living in, and we have to take precautions and be aware of the dangers and possibilities of the world we are in.”
A low, loud rumble shakes the street, crunching rubble bursting through the rain. Cas closes his eyes as flashes of falling bricks and still children cross his mind, before people start pushing past him. He turns around.
” Cas yells again, practically throwing a ministry member aside who is stood in front of him, only to yell as he’s yanked back by them. His body movement carries him with such momentum that he ends up dragging them to the ground, rolling. Castiel has enough semblance of precision to keep them moving towards the arena, and he feels the markings roll under him as they slow. With a grunt, he twists his hips and straddles the figure beneath him. When he realises who it is, he growls.
"Perhaps your time serving broke you beyond repair, but family
As most of you are aware we have our new minister of Magic who was officially inducted last Monday. As a mark of celebration on behalf of Hogwarts, we are organising a series of celebrations for the new Minister for Magic… of whom I would like to introduce to you all now.”
?" Dean finally croaks, surprising himself. Most of the staff body whip their heads around to him, thrown by the aggressive town at the Headmaster. Bobby is unperturbed, but sighs.
Ten seconds later, Jessica opens her eyes, and takes in a deep breath.

Chuck stares at him. Eventually, he reaches out, hand in a tremor, to the glass of whiskey. He downs it in one go, and slams it back down on the desk. “I-- I - you shouldn’t be making such… lewd assumptions, Headmaster. I’m perfectly fine. It’s the students welfare I’m concerned about. That’s all.”
“Y’know Professors don’t care about detention, right? If she did she’d be here in the room with us.”
“You do a lot of flyin’? Like, as an auror?”
“She is the Defence against the Dark Arts Professor, she isn’t unfounded on her observation.”
“Where
"Yeah, well, least I know what I am."
Dean looks down at his own table. Then back to Sam.
Dean grins, sheepishly, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Yeah, well, what’re friends for?”
Sam could count the amount of times he’s been in the Minister’s office. It remained ever the same, even with a new Minister - except for the removal of personal artifacts belonging to the last Minister here. Chuck seemed as of yet to place any of his own.

"Cas, I was tryin' to he--"
Bobby grunts. "Not gonna take advantage of hospitality like that."
"Sure. I'll tell her that," he mutters, before opening the fridge. He quickly calculates something in his mind, before pulling out a bottle of beer. He opens it with the bottle opener stuck on the fridge, some cheesy magnetic moose that Jo had bought him as a joke one year. Everyone cracked up when Bobby remarked how
Dean grip tightens, and he readies the wand.
Jess’ shrill cry throws Dean out of his internal dance and he looks up, watching as Jess emerges and runs towards a figure, slumped on the floor, unconscious---
At least he was with Jack.
“That’s kinda what happens when several dozen Dementors decide to throw a surprise party where the cake is
“I don’t know, Dean.” He turns back towards him, so they’re facing each other again. His voice softens. “But… I think if I had let anyone know about this place, even then – I… would have wanted it to be you.”
Cas pulls away, softly scraping his teeth over Dean's bottom lip as he does. Dean has his eyes closed, and he watches him. He exhales.

Diagon Alley has been all but abandoned, and with Michael out of the picture, the Aurors would take longer to arrive. Lucifer had

. Jack grew up without his mother." His voice breaks. "And now you're depriving him of his father, too."
Azazel doesn't respond for a while. He takes a quiet sip of a whiskey glass. "I think death would be too light a punishment."
“Castiel,” he starts. “Quite the eventful day you’ve had.”
Lucifer is the real father. He turned up here when I wasn’t home and my sister was babysitting, and--”
"Dad, it's Dad, Dean. He — in the hospital, car crash--"
Dean and Cas stare at each other.
Castiel squelches right up until they head into the house, which Jack seems to find endlessly amusing.
Charlie watches him, before shrugging with one shoulder. "We queers gotta stick together, Dean."
He saunters upstairs, brushing his teeth, and half-heartedly rolling into pyjamas. He crawls under the duvet, knowing it was one of those nights where he’ll be unconscious within minutes.
It relents.
Castiel shakes his head.
It's clear that the storage container has not been touched in some time. Dean hovers in front of the door as he tries the combination that John had handed to him, scrawled in some hospital stamped notepaper.
There's a pause for a second. "Er, yes. That's me."
Cas just looks at him. With a sigh, Dean drops a shirt back on the floor. Dude can clean up after himself.
“Was that the Minister’s idea?”
It was friggin’ freezing.
Crowley holds up a finger to Dean with a frown. Crowley finishes his sip, takes forever to place his cup down, then smiles at them. He places his feet on his desk.
"Mr Novak is obviously... unresponsive, currently. Please let me know if you spot any signs of change while you're in there."
Crowley picks up the teacup, pinky finger extended, and takes a very slow, very indulgent sip. Castiel cannot help but wonder how he hasn't burned his tongue.
Jody’s smile tightens for just a second, before she pats at Claire’s shoulder and straightens up. “Well, winning isn’t everything. It’s an important lesson we must all lear—”
eating for a reason, dammit.
"I do
“No, it’s alright. I think I overreacted a little. It's understandable you would know it from being his teacher."
-- Do you trust me?”
Dean grabs the snitch and staggers to his feet, holding up the snitch triumphantly.
His eyes are piercing. In some ways they remind Dean of Cas; soul scanning. In other ways, they reminded him of Lucifer’s;
Dean nods, smiling down at him. "Be fine. This isn't my first babysitter rodeo." He tilts his head, kissing Cas. Cas closes his eyes, humming. He feels him sigh against his lips.
Dean stood beside Sam as they waited for Eileen to walk down the aisle. He can't hide the grin from his face as he glances to the side, watching the tears drip down Sam’s cheeks as Eileen emerges, robed in white.
Sam leans over, trying to peer over his older brother's shoulder. "Well?"
I know headlines have looked a little daunting, and I’ve heard that you’ve had some incidents happen here at the school very recently… but as you can see we’re all trying to do our best to keep you all safe. This is part of the reason I’m here.
“Man, did you plan that?”
"Same." Sam adds, with the same cold tone that Cas is giving her.
"So," Crowley starts, and opens the top drawer of his desk. He pulls out another envelope, already sealed. "Let's do a deal."
Dean glances over at the last name, and his chest tightens.
Academic, book-smart Sam. Jess would be absolutely fine.
Dean grins. Shit eating. "
"You look...beautiful," Castiel finally manages, and Dean flushes. Did Dean not receive many compliments?
"See you soon, old man." Dean mutters, bitterly.
“What is it?”
The tips of Sams fingers play at the letter in his hands, delivered to the owlery this morning. Suspicion rose when he’d found the Hogwarts seal pressed in wax on the back; letters weren’t uncommon from Dean, but the seal had been a first.
“Who do you think that man is? Of course not. Castiel is — and you.”
To his surprise, Cas leans and slides his hands behind Dean's back and wraps his arms around him, holding him tight. Dean freezes at the motion.
when the victim in question is that bastard’s own
“Something that will change your
works.”
“Could you teach us how to stop those things?”
Cas regards Dean with an unreadable look, halfway between a frown and recognition, dawning from a memory long folded away. He reaches to grasp Dean’s arm, pressing it back to his side. “Of course, Dean.”
“Are you free tonight?”
Dean breathes. “Well, alright then.”
"You're right, of course." Sam signs at Eileen. With a slow stretch, he rises to his feet. Eileen looks up at him. "Don't worry about down here. You go get ready for bed," she signs at him.
Now Dean really is frowning, looking down to meet Cas’ eyes. “What do you mean?”
"Well, if you let me in, then, I'd be less--"
Castiel looks at him in silence, smiles, and leaves Dean staring after him.
"Well you always said I'm like mommy, and I like Mr Winchester, so I think she would have too. So I think that's okay." Jack nods sagely, and lets an armful of Lego go into the tub, creating a satisfying crunching sound. "Can I have my truck back now." He realises Cas isn't responding, and turns to look at him. "Pretty please?"
By the time Dean has bested the immobile beast, shoving it to the side, Sam is staring at him. And
Talk about reunions.
Cas halts a few paces behind him but makes no motion to turn him around. “This isn’t Sam’s fault, I—”
Castiel considers him. Dean stares back, beer bottle half frozen to his lips.
“Meg Masters has proven her loyalty to the Ministry of Magic.” Michael states, firm. Chuck nods, visibly taking a breath.
“Shut up.”
must be Jack."
The first thing that settles in his consciousness is the smell of anaesthetic, tickling at his nose. He grips at the bundled sheets that his legs are trapped under, and holds a hand to his head as his senses dawn on him.
Hidden embraces, ruffled hair.
“Dude,” He breathes, when Cas stops to take a breath. “You are unreal.”
"Then this might be for you."
“Don’t be out partying too late, Sammy.” Dean grins, opening his car door. “You got work in the morning.”
Dean looks up in mild surprise as Castiel is stood over him. He’d leaned over to do up one of his boots before heading out with Sam whilst in the corridors, only to find the Professor looming over him. It makes him blink.
Sam looks at Castiel, a little amused. "No, don't think he's had someone serious since...well. I'm not even sure. Jo, maybe. But that was a few years ago.”
Dean mutters under his breath. "Yeah, whatever. I'm ready."
“That wasn’t necessarily what I was coming here to talk to you about,” Michael replies, after a pause. Cas’ eyebrows raise. “Though it’s clear whatever precautions you had put in place have failed.”
"I'm not throwing it away." Cas reassures, leaning down to begin sweeping. "But you should start picking up what's around you."

Castiel shoots a final glare at Michael, before pulling him away. "You're injured, Dean. We need to get you checked."

Hesitantly, Dean reaches out, and places a hand on Cas’ shoulder. Cas opens his eyes, peering at him.
“Geeze, Sammy, what are ya? Ninja moose?”
“Alright, time to show you how a Quidditch team

“Glad to see Jack is still good friends with Tony.” Dean notes, holding it at him. To his surprise, Cas chuckles as he joins him, placing two cups down in front of them.

“We’re ensuring that won’t happen again.”
He looks back at him, in mild surprise. “Yeah?”
Castiel slowly looks at him, deep enough that Dean feels like his childhood is being scanned. Cas sighs, and turns back towards the door. “I hope so.” He murmurs. “He’s a lot like his mother.”
“…It’s okay, Dean.”
"Swing by after. Beer'll be on me."
Dean freezes as the response comes from behind him. A stranger stands, and points to the picture.
Writing this chapter there were two songs I had on repeat, and I'd recommend listening to them as you're reading for extra feels!
They stumble down the stairs, both coughing, and Sam suddenly begins to resist as they near the door "My notes, my notes--"
Dean looks up, and with a small yell, flies right into a window. Darkness surrounds him.
already know — it was a small town, he knew Jody, and Jack was his student. If he cared Dean would’ve looked into who Jack was and his background.
Charlie shoves a drink under Dean’s nose, and Dean squeezes his eyes shut as the nose hits him.
Alastair raises his wand, and Castiel’s muscles explode in pain, vision ringing white. He feels the cobblestones hit his knees as he crumples. He curls, deaf to his own screams.
"Well, son, are you here for something, or do I need to ask you to get off my property?"
"What is this?"
Withdrawing slumber, a tired shuffle of shirt too big, too thin.
“I’m. Going
He and Sam's struggle begins again, Sam pushing away Dean's arms and going for his jacket. Again, the fight is short lived (Dean is
They fall into comfortable silence. Dean slides his hand down, intertwining his fingers with Castiel's.
“Nightmares are fairly normal, after a Dementor attack. Particularly on such a large scale. Don’t be surprised if you have periods of melancholy over the next week.” Castiel reaches around to the top drawer on his desk, and pulls out a bar of chocolate. He hands it to Dean. “Don’t tell my students about this drawer.”
Dean can’t help himself. He reaches a hand forward, places it on Cas’ shoulder. “You’re one of the best teachers those kids have had,” He says, earnestly. His hand lingers too long, words left too empty. He withdraws, with Cas still watching him. “I mean, heck of a lot better than our Professor ever was.”
As Cas wipes at his stubble, finishing his swig, Dean leans forward. He tilts his head.
Dean wanders through to the kitchen, where Bobby is hunched over a small saucepan. By the smell he is reheating some beans. Dean leans against the doorframe.
Castiel follows him with a frown, and Dean can’t help himself from smirking. As they reach the entrance to the outside of Hogwarts, Castiel places a hand on Dean’s shoulder to slow him.
“Finally, most often it is their background that dictates their future. If a wizard has come from a sordid family, or a family with a dark past, the individuals are much more likely to go on to commit Dark Acts. Nature and Nurture often go hand in hand.”
Dean throws back his bed sheet, swinging his legs over the edge with some stiffness. He winces. Every part of his body aches.

“Thank you.” He murmurs. A few (uneasy) beats later, he feels hands grasp at the back of his own sodden robes. Castiel sighs against him, quiet.
"Jack?"
Sam laughs a little wryly. "Yeah, well. He practically brought me up, so I think he thinks it's all he knows how to do."
“Because you don’t want to see how fucked up you’ve become.”
Lucifer staggers back, and Dean can't roll away quick enough before he feels two bodies tumbling over him; he barely shuffles out of range of becoming
Lucifer slams, and--
“He told us we have to hurt Aurors.”
Dean is scooping up the remains of the jumbo Jenga tower into a plastic box when he hears his classroom door swing open. He doesn’t need to turn around to know who it is.
He stares at the drawn curtains in front of them. He blinks as he feels a hand on his left shoulder, glancing to see Cas gazing at him. "I… didn’t really know my own father, or
He brushes forward, students shuffling away so he can get a closer look. True to the students, under
“My brother is the Dark Wizard. Maybe you’re the one scared, Professor.”
Dean crawls out from the window. He can feel the sting of glass on his cheeks.
Dean frowns, turning to the source of whoever is calling his name – only to find it’s Sam.
“Are you trying to threaten me too, Winchester?”
“Hey, sweetheart, it’s okay.”
As Dean strides through the clinical hallways of St Mungos, he shrugs off memories, ones that leave a sour taste in his mind. He hated this place.
Before either of them can reply, another individual drifts to a stop beside them. They all look up, and Dean's shoulders tense.
Jack gives a hesitant nod. "Okay."
There is tense silence for a few minutes as the judge pours over the receipts, frowning. Castiel glances over to where Lucifer and Crowley stand. Both of them are staring, Lucifer with confusion, Crowley with some mild, stoic curiosity. Castiel tilts his head.
He catches something out of the corner of his eye. As he turns around, he sees Castiel diving down towards the bottom of the pitch. He sees the snitch, having just been released. For a few moments Dean forgets to even move, so lost in how quickly Castiel managed to spot the snitch, and then his brain kicks into gear. He pushes at the end of his broom, and swoops down to meet where he can now see it, flickering around with a low buzz.
As the last of the students leave, looking reluctantly at Dean, Castiel motions for him to enter.

“Well I didn’t, and I think the moment has passed on whether it would have been helpful or not, yeah—?” He looks up, suddenly staring across the pitch. “And speaking of the devil—”
“Enough.” Castiel states, and the room falls silent. “A Patronus is an extremely complicated spell, certainly not for third-year students to learn. If it is necessary then maybe I will. It certainly isn’t necessary for succeeding at Hogwarts.”
Even now, Azazel's expression is unnervingly neutral.

Castiel’s arms fall back to his side.
"It's a small town, and she's the Sheriff." He only notes — which is fair enough, but Dean's never seen a hair on this man's head before — or his son's. Dean placates his suspicion with a grin.
Lucifer looks between the both of them with an unreadable expression, lingering on Dean for a moment. He feels a shiver when Lucifer roams his eyes across his body.
“How old were you?” Cas is looking at him again, with that strange soul piercing stare that he’s not sure he’s quite noticed before. “When your mother died, if you don’t mind me--”
“Will be,” He promises.
The moment the spell leaves the wand Dean feels the grasp on him start to lift; the dove flies between the Dementors, which recoil, and begin to dissipate. Over the course of a minute the looming cloud is forced into retreat, and eventually, the stars in the sky return.
He looks past Dean, to the lake, to the moon; blotted on still, unblemished waters.
Dean looks at him. “Lucifer?”

“If that is what you want, yes.”
He reaches out, and the chase begins.
Sam shrugs, leaning against the counter. "You tell a guy about something to do with
with it, Crowley!”
"Ladies and Gentleman," Chuck announces, wand pressed to his throat in an amplifying spell. His voice wavers as he tries, unused to the effect of the volume. "I - I hope you're ready for a great competition!"
Cas tilts his head in mild bemusement. An eyebrow is raised. “I apologise if saving your life on
“Thanks for coming, everyone. I’ve chosen you all specifically, as representatives of the Ministry. Uh, I’m still getting used to this, sorry - there’s a lot of people in the Ministry! But we’re going to Hogwarts to celebrate a new era and reassure the students in light of recent events, and I feel you’d all be most qualified --”
Castiel blinks. “I wasn’t--”
"How so?"
When suddenly wailing rings through the kitchen and the door is being thrown open by someone half its height.
Castiel’s footsteps echo down the suspension bridge as he walks alone. The sun has long since set, and Cas stops for a moment to close his eyes, listening to the rain as it drums on the roof above him.
“I looked out of the window, and saw them approaching.”
tact with him. Dean awkwardly shrugs with one shoulder.
Dean reaches the end of the platform and swings round, wand poised. To his surprise, Cas is already waiting, and hasn’t cast a spell. Yet.
“It’s raining. You’re going to get wet.”
Sam looks back at Dean, looks at him for long enough that Dean has to look away. “Yeah, so they haven’t changed.”
It takes him a minute to realise that the figure is now looming over him, and is speaking to him.
Despite his derailing thoughts, muscle memory serves him well, and he skids round the perimeter of the pitch, getting a feel for the pitch, the air, and the team that are flying around him. He looks around and—
In silence, Dean follows Cas as they wander towards a corner of the tower, to a small door. Cas points quietly at the door with his wand, and there’s a small flicker of light and a soft
, what a storm. Was that smoke?
The door is opened.
"No, I didn't. We had a very nice meal together, then I came back home."
Despite the ominous tone of the conversation, Dean can't help but smile a bit to himself. "Sure thing, man. I'll be there."
each other.
Mr. Shurley leans down, and pats Jack on the shoulder. "Why don't you go and find Claire? She should be here somewhere."
The slight silence as Jack blinks up at his ‘Uncle’ immediately sends alarm bells off in Dean’s head. He wedges himself slightly between the both of them.
Castiel grips the edge of the desk, squeezing his eyes shut as he attempts to compose himself.  He can feel Sam take a deep breath beside him.
“Yeah, I agree.”
“You okay?” Castiel eventually asks him. Jack, eyes still red, gives a shaky nod.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “…You asked him for his blessing?”
Slowly, he turns to look at Cas, his features mostly hidden in shadow. The moon manages to brush the outline of Castiel’s nose, drawing a gentle line around the edge of his cheek, stroking the exposed collarbone before it nestles under a Gryffindor scarf.
As she turns and staggers away, Cas walks after her, wand steady. “I’ll just have to disappoint him.”
He feels Jack watch him for a few moments, before he protectively nurses his truck under his arm while trying to pick up the Lego with one hand. Cas has swept a path to him just as Jack starts debating whether he needs to give up his truck for the sake of tidiness. He doesn't seem happy about it.
Despite the clattering noise that Dean is unintentionally intentionally making, the person in front of him doesn’t seem to be taking any notice. So with a yawn, Dean stretches, knocking his quill over, hitting his back.
"So you're sayin' it's Jack who's gonna get married next."
Cas nods. "In that envelope is an announcement of a custody hearing. He wants to fight for custody, and probably prove his paternity."
He stops, looking at Dean. “Yes?”
Cas turns his head back to the spell. A pause. “Three, two,”
," Dean spits, pulling out his wand from under his robes. He screws his eyes shut, trying to focus on the darkness seeping into the edges of his mind. He glances behind him.
Just before his hands reaches it a body slams into him, sending him flying to the floor.
“--Can’t even come to say hello to his own son, whom he's never had the chance to
Panic blooms in Cas' chest, and he turns, storming out of the back room.
“Coffee?” Cas asks, stood in the doorway. Dean tilts his head in a small nod.
Dean blinks, and then flushes, freckles popping up across his cheeks.
Chuck slumps unceremoniously onto the floor, but there is a delighted smirk on his face. "Mm, just as I thought. You refuse to hurt family."
Castiel stands up beside Dean, wand ready. He places his right foot in front of Dean, shielding him. Somewhat childishly, Dean shuffles, and they stand side by side.
It's Sam's turn to roll his eyes behind him; easily seen from looming over Dean's shoulder. He fidgets with the cuffs of his sleeves for a moment, wondering whether they're long enough. "How'd it go?"
The pre-match whistle blows, and they break to assume position for the start of the match.
Dean sighs, mostly through his nose.
Lucifer wasn't ever going to stop, was he? They had never won anything, because if Lucifer couldn't get what he wanted through legal means, he was going to do it by

He finds Cas out by the lake. A silhouette stood against the careful outline of the water, drawn in from thousands of years of mother nature calling the shots. He’s using a

Dean blinks as rain suddenly stops matting his hair. He turns.
He looks over to the concentration of people gathered round one of the beds, and blinks when he sees Cas stood there. He’s leaning over the figure in the bed. Clearing his throat, Dean opens his mouth to call for his brother.

“I am unsure of what else you expect of me, Michael. Hogwarts is one of the most well protected places in the country. But there’s only so much that can be done when the Ministry decides that sending a group of Dementors to look over Hogwarts is a
Thirty seconds later, Sam holds up a vial and runs over to Jess. Gently, he pours it into her mouth, and everyone falls silent in anticipation.
Dean's phone vibrates. They both stare at each other, before Dean pulls out the phone. It's a text. From Sam.
Out of nowhere, Jack exclaims. "Aunty Anna said you went on a date with Mr. Winchester last night."
Cas falls quiet. Then; “Yes. There were a few occasions I had to take pursuit, or travel short distance in an emergency. Sometimes using portkeys highlights the use of magic, and can attract even more unwanted attention.”
Small note - there are some mild descriptions of someone passing away up ahead. Also some ghastly fashion sense.
“Don’t worry. Castiel is more than capable of ensuring defences are beyond standards, even if his brother doesn’t think so.” Bobby mutters. He watches Chuck for a moment, and frowns. “Is… is that why you’re here, Minister?”
“Yeah,” Dean nods, and nudges him in the shoulder. “You’d make a way better Defence against the Dark Arts teacher than her one day, I bet.”
Jo passes Dean a wink as she places the drinks down in front of the men.  Dean smirks at her, but it drops when he looks over to him. Jo still flashes Castiel a smile, before wandering off with the empty tray. Dean shrugs with one shoulder.
"You could... come over. Once Jack is asleep. Later?"
"You can give 'em whatever name you like. They don't mind. And if you ever get scared or frightened, you can hold onto them and they'll help you be less afraid. They can even tell me if you're not feeling good, without you ever saying a word."
“Secondly, they have to have a following. There is only so much destruction one Wizard or Witch can cause without garnering the attention of other magic creatures to stop them. Their power lies in numbers.”
"But that didn't happen." Dean remarks, more of a statement than a question. He fiddles with one of the coasters on the table, but can see Cas nod from his peripheral.

They're silent.

feeling uncomfortable.
He feels Castiel considering him. “Claire had already asked for me help, but,” a tone of amusement in his voice, seeing Dean deflate. “But I passed her along to Professor Mills. Jody would prove best for mentoring her. So yes, I suppose that’s possible. What would you—”
She pauses for a moment, looking away as someone talks to her offscreen. She signs at them, before glancing back down. "There was a fire in the house. In the bedroom, Sam--"

"Student rules don't count."
“Yes?”
The door is unlocked, and Jack barrels on inside. From the kitchen Castiel hears, "Hey big guy, aren't you looking a bit damp?"
Naomi, staring at Dean for a few more seconds, glances back at the scribble of chalk on the black board at the front of the room.
"Jody?" Dean calls out, just as a precaution. He rounds the landing only to come to a stop at the doorway into the dining room, where he comes to the stop at the sight of someone sitting at it. He blinks as recognition falls.
"What about
He guesses he’ll find out.
to ignore it and begins to move across the room to put the box away.
Dean wakes with a jolt.
This is my first time creating something on this scope and nursing this baby unseen for so long, so I'm nervous and excited to put it out into the world finally!
All class members are quiet, looking at one particular individual with his hand up. His face is like thunder.
"A Patronus." Michael mutters, trying not to sound relieved.
And again.
"Hey, sweetheart." He eventually murmurs, steeling himself to reach forward, and lets his fingers sweep through the stray locks on Castiel's forehead. Castiel doesn't appear to respond to the touch. "You're gonna be just fine."
Dean opens his mouth to rebuke her, but is interrupted by the sight of the Potions Master sweeping into the Great Hall, making his way to the front. Crowley stands to the side of Bobby and Chuck, and places a hand on his hip, scanning the crowd.

charm on the end of his wand but is staring off into the water. Dean looks up, warily. It’s clear, besides the eons of stars scattered across the sky.
“No, just… trust me.”
He gazes down at Chuck’s wand, and he feels chills settle on his arms. This wasn’t gonna be a trip down memory lane.
“I couldn’t let children die again.”
"You sure you're fine doing this?" Cas asks, stood in the doorway. His fingers are clutched into the lapels of Dean's jacket, and his breath ghosts over Dean's lips.
Running fingers through his hair in oncoming exasperation, Dean catches someone coming in out of the corner of his eye.
She's silent as she scans through the essay.
They both glance out of the window, where the happy shrieks of a dozen six year olds ring around the garden.
Michael observes Dean for a few moments, and glances over at Sam. “Well, if only Dementors were weakened against quick wit.” He glances at Castiel, “I’ve wasted enough time. I should be returning to the Minister.”
“That guy is a catch, am I right? I’d love to—“
Dean grins, tilting his head towards the older woman in the back of the kitchen, flipping some burgers. “Hey, Ellen. How you doin’?”
Dean nods, and doesn't move his gaze from him. "Well, lemme treat you. Both of you. Wherever you wanna take Jack for the day, my treat."

"All I'm seeing are a series of payments over several years to a specific bank account."
“Bloody hell,” Crowley mutters, dragging the trolley away. “Knew I should’ve used Charlie. Then I wouldn’t have to be witness to this ridiculous mating dance.”
But now that he was here... Dean was at a loss.

Castiel stares at Dean from his seat, who briefly shares a look with a him. Dean rubs at the back of his head, shrugs, and looks down, becoming distracted at another student punching him lightly in the shoulder. Castiel keeps watching.
“— I need you to help my brother.” He sighs. “I wanna make sure he wins, or has a good chance. I dunno, I know some of these things can be pretty dangerous.”
"Yer not busy, are ya?"
Bobby studies him for a second. “Alright.” He remarks. “Sorry, Minister. Didn’t mean to accuse such a thing.”
He feels a hand grab at his hair and
Dean stares at him, but says nothing. For the first time, Castiel finds
“Have you considered our Valentine’s specials? A box of chocolates and a bouquet for only $12.99...” Castiel repeats the mantra at a gruff looking male with the beard half the size of him. Castiel is fairly sure he’s homeless, but management insists on pushing the offer, so here he is. The man barely looks at him before scooping the six pack and tissues under his arm, splatting down a few bills on the counter between them. Castiel barely manages to return his change to him before the man has shuffled out of the door. Castiel watches him leave with apathetic curiosity, vaguely wondering what the male is going to be doing with those items. He then realises it’s not an ideal train of thought he should pursue.
“To quidditch teachers who are clearly wrong.”
, he isn’t quite sure yet, but his hand still stays stretched out, reaching out for the snitch.
The hospital wing is quiet. The sun filters through the window, highlighting particles of dust as they float, suspended. The sun filters through the window, highlighting particles of dust as they float, suspended. Mid afternoon. Twilight would be sinking in soon.
Dean closes his eyes for a moment, letting the noise of the children and the rush of exerted energy slowly slosh its way to stillness as he breathes. He'd joke about it, but this was one of his favorite parts of the day in that it was necessary. No matter how hectic, or stressful, or annoying his work day would be, he knew there would be a moment where he could come back to Baby and sit in her company, alone, and just... breathe. It might not be the most comfy, or the first place people would think of for respite, but it was certainly one to him.
Without so much as pausing in his work, Castiel picks up the quill, and throws it back onto Dean’s desk.
ever think … we, would happen?”
“Dammit, Cas – I love you—“
"Exactly.
He feels his phone start vibrating in the back pocket of his pants.  With a frown, he pulls it out. He answers it.
Bobby looks at Chuck, then at the quill. He leans back, grabs the glass bottle behind him, and two small glasses, setting them on the desk. He pours both of them a glass of whiskey, whether or not Chuck wanted it or not.
“Dementors aren’t to be trusted, and should never have been allowed so close to the grounds… but why they approached merely you is unusual, as opposed to doing so during a match or training. The Headmaster will need to know what happened.”
They stare at each other. Dean looks away.
Dean pointedly looks away, but he can feel Bobby staring.
Dean stares. "Uh, sure? You sure? You got a kid, and--"
"What the
Castiel blinks at him. Dean basted his self-confidence in an almost ritually self-deprecating manner. Sam seems genuine, and Castiel wonders somewhere how much of that Dean is responsible for. He nods. "Okay. When will..."
of a fiancee, Sam would be nothing but an ash stain on that bedroom floor by now."
“There is a reason Kelly chose me to raise
Bobby’s face, as good as he was keeping a neutral expression, was something permanently imprinted in Dean’s mind.
Cas starts to step forward. “Dean, you should rest—”
Her smile spreads wide when her eyes settle on Sam, and she throws her arms out.
"Hey, I gotta fly on that."
“Just some Ceasar salad. No sauce.”
Who was on the bed?
The room holds very little natural lighting, and so Chuck looks even more shrunken in his chair. As they enter there’s a shy smile, and Chuck ushers them in.
"I know exactly what I'm talking about." Dean continues, ignoring Cas for the moment. "Every time trouble happens you're
"True." Dean pauses. A sigh. "Yeah. Jody invited me here for some company. Sam's with his fiancee, so."
He feels himself grunt as adrenaline rushes him. He involuntarily attempts to sit up. He has to make sure Jack is safe, that he--
“To prove that darkness is a choice; not a curse that spreads.”
"For now, sure." Sam nods. "As long as you stop keeping shit from me, man."
As he approaches it, he stops, arms hanging loose, staring at the door.
“Looks like you figured you’ve got too many ribs and needed to get rid of one.” He looks to their partner. “Get them to the medical wing.”
He raises a fist, and punches the hood of the car. It's hard enough that the car alarm is triggered, shrieking down the crowded street. A few people turn to look. Castiel sighs, sniffs, and pulls out his keys. As he does so, something catches the corner of his eye.
“How’d you know?”
"Look familiar?" Sam muses. Crowley peers at it for a moment.
They stare at each other.
. You too?” Sam comments, in disbelief. Sam presses his back against the shield, wondering if he’ll end up falling through it somehow. “Come on -- this isn’t you.” He raises his own wand in preparation. Michael was making no motion of slowing down, eyes narrowed, focused on him. Sam can only watch him as he approaches. Something was wrong.
They remain in silence for some ways down the corridor, walking side by side with rucksacks and satchels slung over shoulders. Their footfalls patter down the hallway ahead of them.
His gaze settles on Dean.
Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes at himself. “Even before I could see if you were okay?” He asks to Sam. Sam shrugs.
"Sam is being taken to the hospital. I think he will be okay." She looks uncertain. "Tell Dean to come, please."
Lucifer stands there, looking casually between them both.
They find themselves at Bobby's. Castiel hadn't known what the conclusion of the hearing was going to be, so he had sent Jack to Jody's for the night, just in case. Dean had come back from a call from Bobby after they had exited the courtroom, and claimed that Bobby had invited everyone round for drinks to mark the 'end of this sodding mess'. With nothing else to do, Castiel had agreed to join them for a few drinks.
Castiel sighs, puts down his book, places his hands on the table. “I’m sure you heard the rest of the statement Professor Singer said. There were to be no questions on this.”
"Hey buddy, there's no rush. The letters aren't gonna run ahead of you, yeah? Why don't you show me how you do that letter again?"
She scrawls down ‘Master’.
“We should—”
badly. "It was okay. We ate our meal, drove him home, saw him to the door. That's all."
“Grounded. She’s been suspended from playing for the rest of the year.” She smirks. “What’s wrong, Winchester? Have I thrown you off your strategy?”
He punches Chuck in the stomach, and he flinches. "You think I wasn't worth it, that I was just some insignificant pawn too, just like Cas--" Everything
Despite being ready, Castiel delays himself. He opens the door, still deciding what expression to wear, when he sees Dean in front of him.
a teacher, Novak, so be glad that it’s
Dean flashes his best flattering grin at her, and dares to keep his head where it is for the moment. “I work with small kids, Ellen. My reflexes are second to none.”
"Professor Novak! Hi!"
“Hey, brother.” Sam acknowledges. Dean smiles at him, before another question drops in his mind. If Sammy was here, then…
Castiel runs towards the Leaky Cauldron, wanting to ensure that the barrier had been put up if the wizards in there hadn’t been notified already. No one could get out.
Dean casts a glance to the journal on the seat beside him. He should at least show Sam that. Take out the last page? Yes. Maybe. Dammit.
of you, it was
it this time, Dean), and locks the door. He heads up towards the house.
He’d only arrived at the family home – which was mostly occupied by Sam and Jess these days – late last night.
Cas and Jody take a step back, and after a moment, the sound of the whistle blows through the grounds.
He’s interrupted by Jack jumping out of his seat with a “Daddy!” and running towards him. Castiel blinks but scoops the boy up as he nears him, hoisting him on his hip. He looks at Jack.
“You’re – you’re sayin’ you want to continue?”
Note - take heed of the warnings - this is where many of them really start to come into play.
Charlie sticks her tongue out, withdrawing as her eye catches the Headmaster rising to his feet. Silence hushes over the great hall, students turning from their own gossip to look towards the front. Nevertheless, Robert Singer taps the end of his goblet on the desk in three long, drawn out knocks. He waits for complete silence to fall.
Samandriel peers over with some curiosity as Cas takes the quill out of their hands, opening the front cover and scratching something on the first page. Cas closes it before he can see, folding the book underneath his robes.
"Dude, how are you so friggin warm?"
“Evening after the Flying challenge. I’d just come from the owlery, and Cas had just come from visiting you.”
Eileen is outside; that’s apparent. Secondly, the distinct sound of sirens wail in the background, accompanied by the ambient noise of a neighbourhood having tumbled out from their homes in the middle of the night.
“First rule of duelling, Cas. Element of surprise.”
Dean falls quiet, staring at the gecko in awe, as Cas takes a sip of his tea—peppermint, if Dean is smelling correctly. Gently, Dean places it on the arm of the sofa beside him, patting it gently. He picks up his own coffee and takes a sip.
Cas rolls his eyes, steps over the broom, and kicks off the ground, launching himself into the air and around the stadium in a practice lap. Students cheer after him and Dean doesn’t lose his grin, not taking long to follow up after him, hovering above the students.
A small part of Dean's brain wonders why in the hell he'd think charging a man with a loaded gun was any part of a sensible idea, but before that particular message is coordinated with the rest of his body Dean finds his arms reaching out and curling round the other man's waist. They both go tumbling to the ground and the gun scatters from his hand, along the landing. It's a minor miracle that it doesn’t go off.
,” Jody manages to catch Castiel admonish as they walk by. “You need to stop with the posturing. It’s looking apparent that you’re compensating for something.”
Dean stares at the revolving doors. "Yeah, but he ain't Cas," he mumbles. "Pretty sure I know what Jack cares 'bout more."
Cas sighs. "Yes, I know. They're making a funny noise."
Internal bleeding is what the Doctors told them as they arrived. Major organs punctured. They were doing all they could, but he’d driven straight into a tree, and there was alcohol in his system. It was a miracle that he was still breathing by the time he’d made it to the hospital.
“You heard what the headmaster said during breakfast.”
“Dean… look after yourself.”
, Cas,” A soft plead, made in the shadow of a bottle.
A Quaffle.
“Hey,” he says, softly. Castiel inclines his head, and ushers him in.
"New evidence, your Honor." Sam steps forward. "If I may proceed."
here they stand, at the edge of their own time, chosen by them, facing each other, holding hands.
“As I said, it’s part of my responsibility to Hogwarts. But I appreciate the gratitude.” He tries a smile. “Truly.”
He thinks to himself, before pressing forward and beginning to fly after him. Dude clearly had a better eye for catching the snitch, so like hell he was gonna let Cas get on top of him.
Dean finds him inadvertently standing to his feet. This man had
“Did you ever have to use it when you were an auror, sir?”
Castiel tilts his head, a little amused. "I didn't say anything. I just remember walking into Jody's dining room once and finding you, outside of your work hours, sat helping Jack with an assignment
"Thanks."
“Who was the muggle?”
Dean raises his hands, sounding small. "Yeah, fine. Won't do it again."
“How long have you been at Hogwarts?”
Dean pulls up outside Cas's house, and Dean walks with him to the door once it's clear Castiel isn't about to reject him. There's a quiet pause as they stand outside of the door, glancing not quite at each other. It's late evening, and the rest of the street has seemingly turned in for the night.
He’s frowning.
Agnes & Co. seemed to just
“Hogwarts is the safest place for anyone. Is that why you’re here, Chuck?” He starts, “You’ve hardly been in the post two minutes. Most Ministers get snowed under for the next six months when they assume office.”
he didn't know.) The kitchen window was smashed. On the landing pieces of furniture are everywhere—a curtain pole left. Jack’s door was wide open. They'd clearly spent no time trying to hide any evidence. Dean was gone.
“They seem happy enough. Her dad already knew, though.”
Dean pulls him up, and lets go.
Castiel finds himself smiling.
Dean glances up at the question. “Oh, uh. Workin’? Couple of years now. Figured since I couldn’t pursue the professional quidditch life, I decided to stick it out here at Hogwarts after a while. Also means my brother knows where I am, and I get to see him more.”
, his body urges, and he suddenly wants to do nothing but to curl up and never move again. His training throws itself against his conscience.
The frown Cas gives makes Dean shake his head, dismissing his joke. Castiel tilts his head, and heads off in one direction. As Dean catches up to his side Cas reaches out and takes his hand. They walk in comfortable silence until they reach the clock tower, where they come to a pause. Dean raises an eyebrow.
"Castiel, it's Eileen. I tried to get a hold of Dean, but he isn't answering his phone. It's Sam. There was --"
Dean pauses for a long, long moment. He pulls back just enough to meet the angel’s eyes.
“Maybe. It’ll be someone who isn’t involved in the competition.”
They hear Jody scream, and all stop in their arguing to look up.
"I always figured the promise of all the hamburgers you could eat and the wistful screaming of children demanding ice cream is always a surefire way to lift the spirits." Jodie notes. Dean at least attempts a chuckle. "Charlie's in the garden."
"And Gabriel, but no one knows where he is. The last thing I need them to believe is that I have
Dean doesn't even bother knocking, instead pushing the door open and entering the house. He peers into the pokey landing.
Charlie scoffs, before pointing a finger at the accused coffee cup on the desk. “Hey. Gecko first, old man questions later.”
Dean refrains from rolling his eyes. "Oh yeah, felt like a change of pace, wanted to live in a pig sty, smell the... well, it ain't roses."
as another figure, much smaller than the one in front of him, has him thrown over their shoulder. Jack pummels as hard as he can on the back of their shoulder. Unfortunately, Bad Guy #2 doesn't seem at all phased by his valiant efforts.
Cas tilts his head, and Dean kisses him again, long enough for Cas to press his shoulders against the rail of the stairs, enough for his mind to start wandering.
Dean charges anyway.
. Eugh.” Meg scoffs, and drops the book beside Castiel’s body, whimpering. She steps over him, standing next to Alastair. “Let’s go.”
“Was too distracted to watch you go down. It was Cas who caught you. We… didn’t know what Michael was going to do once he went down – if it even
"Hey, you must be Mr... uh. Shurley?" A short nod of affirmation. Dean steps aside his desk to crouch down to the child. "And
Neither of them breathes.
Castiel pushes open the door fully at that point, trying to catch his breath. (You would assume even with a six year old he'd have retained most of his fitness). Mr. Winchester looks up at him, blinking for a second —no doubt at the soggy state Castiel swamps in as.
He stops, feeling the hot chill ball into his throat at Sam's broken voice.
Months of recreation.
“Son of a –” He says, but doesn’t finish as he’s thrown onto his side, a hand bruising his waist as he hits the ground hard. He looks up just in time to see Cas advance forward, and with a flick of his wand a hurricane surges into motion. Dean raises his arm to cover his eyes.
"No, Cas--" Sam steps up beside him. "Blood relations don't always hold as much sway as you think they do. Kelly put you on the birth certificate--"
Meg steps over him to pick up the book that had fallen out of Castiel’s robes. She opens the cover.
Dean exhales, wanting to slap himself for how hopeful he feels. "Yeah?"
Dean wakes.
(See the end of the chapter for
From one of the side doors, three different stretchers are wheeled in, with sheets over them. By the time it clicks for Dean what is underneath those sheets, the sheets are pulled off, and the crowd that is gathered around them gasps.
Sam nods, only realising now that he is looking away from the laptop just how exhausted he felt. His eyes are dry. When was the last time he'd even paused to make a drink?
He manages to turn his head in time to throw up—right over Lucifer's shoes.
So uh, what you gonna do now?" Dean asks, forever wondering why he's stumbling over his words all of a sudden—though he knows he should know better by now.  Castiel closes his eyes, and sighs.
“You heard what the headmaster said during breakfast.”
To Dean’s surprise, Cas corners him after leaving the Great Hall, despite ignoring him the whole time.
Castiel pauses in what he's doing. He folds his arms, wand still in his hand. "I'm unsure as to what you're implying."
“An Anti-Paralysis potion is the aim of this challenge. Better hurry up, you have 30 minutes before their body starts thinking the paralysis is more than just a temporary estate. You don’t want to know what that might look like.”
He walks over to the student, curled on the floor. Dean walks over, leans down, puts a hand on their arm.
“Oh. Mr… Winchester,” The name comes back to him. Mr. Winchester tilts his head, and a grin spreads on his expression.
The Professor raises her eyebrow. “Or am I just scaring you?”
He wonders briefly what the Wizarding School is like in the Caribbean. They'd probably have flying surfing lessons.
That’s probably what Castiel found strange. Someone
Dean is sure it's in his hair, and thus it will remain for 84 years. It’s times like this he deeply,
The gavel hits onto the desk to silence the court room. Billie glances to Lucifer, sharply.
“Dean, you know I live for anything that pulls me away from grading papers.” She looks into the sky, staring at the class. She doesn’t move her gaze until she shuffles closer to Dean, who in response leans in. The frown that now falls on her expression with no students to see her has Dean matching her. This couldn’t be good.
"Hmm," Dean muses, considering Castiel with a curious gaze. "Am I going to have to charm you to the truth, Novak?"
Cas and Dean turn their heads to where Lucifer motions, seeing the outline of Sam pressed against the shield. Dean’s arm drops to his side in shock, jaw dropping.
The audience suddenly gasps, and they look up suddenly. Castiel's heart stops.
Jack gazes down at it for half a minute, before giving a very serious nod. "Tony."
"Can't get anymore prepared than I am now."
plays on loop between them as they stare each other down. Lucifer lowers his hands.
"Dean." Sam sighs. "You should've seen how he talked about you when I met with him earlier. He also said yes to the date."
“Er… no, not really. I had them all moved out of the office. Kind of gave me the heebie jeebies, y’know?” He mumbles. He stares down at his hands for a second, before using his right one to run a hand across his forehead. “I just wanted to ask about… well. About the security, at Hogwarts.”
“Hey, sweetheart.” She smiles, using her wand to gesture. “How’s you and lover boy doing?”
from how full it is. Many of the pages are full of the unmistakable scrawl of John’s handwriting, full of pictures, newspaper clippings — some about mom, some about other arson attacks across the country that occurred in a
Dean totally didn't have tears of his own.
Suddenly, crying erupts from the aforementioned garden. Jodie rolls her eyes. "I'd better go sort that out. Make yourself at home."
“Isn’t this Sam’s room?”
“Hmm,” Castiel says, as though only just noticing the large cut on Jack’s knee. “Let’s see what we can do about that, yeah?” He turns around to Dean, who’s been standing there like a man who doesn’t deal with kids injuries all the time for a living. He blinks at Cas as he turns towards him.
“But what if they come for us, too?” A girl in the back pipes up, her voice wobbling. A few concerned murmurs pass themselves along the classroom. He frowns.
