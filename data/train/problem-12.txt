Sherlock eased himself off and away from her body, leaning against a wall. The room was full of dust and spores of mildew. No light spilled from under the door. He looked at his watch – thank God for analog watches – and saw it was 2:38, but he couldn’t tell if it was afternoon or night from the lack of light. They had gone downstairs at 10:21am.
John tried to lift the lid off, then swore when he realized that Bantam had nailed it shut – quickly and amateurly, but enough to keep Sherlock from kicking his way out. He could hear Sherlock’s hands and feet drumming against the rough wood, and that his voice was high and thready and hoarse with a fear that John hadn’t heard before. He scanned the tools, hoping for a crowbar or even an axe; he would chop his way to Sherlock if need be. A hammer was lying in the corner, clearly where Bantam had thrown it after nailing Sherlock in. John put the torch in his mouth, grabbed the hammer, and began to pry up the lid, the nails giving way to his desperation in loud metallic groans.
“Filling the flask is her job, Anderson. The better question to ask her is, with what did you fill the flask?”
“Thank you dear, but there’s hardly a thing in it. They weren’t able to recover anything from the crash, you know. And I had that lovely blue dress packed then.”
was what drove him to study history, drove him to Oxford, to the time travel program – the desire to
“Really good. Surprisingly good. When we moved in, I never expected him to have anything to do with her, in terms of her care. But he jumped right in.” His smile broadens. “The other day I came home late from work and they were both on the sofa, asleep. Rosie was curled up on his chest. He’d fed her – the kitchen was a disaster, even more so than usual – and I guess they just fell asleep. It was lovely.”
“Which leaves approximately four hours during which any member of the company could have added the poison to the flask,” Sherlock said.
“No, I’m working the bombing case. I’m the lead, in fact. And Detective Lestrade came to us with a witness testimony that cleared our only suspect. When we questioned him about how he came to getting a witness testimony from the famous Sherlock Holmes, it came out that he’d been consulting with a Companion,” Dimmock sneered on the word, “on dozens of cases, without permission or notifying his superiors. Clearly bringing a civilian into New Alliance investigations is just slightly against the rules, so he’s on leave.” He smiled without mirth. “And what can I do for you?”
The rules were set. There would be three challenges, over three weekends, barring urgent cases (in which case the challenge would be rescheduled, not cancelled). Mrs Hudson, being the one most familiar with the show, would be head judge and would set the challenges. Mrs Turner, Molly Hooper, and Greg (“Who?”) Lestrade would round out the judging team.  (Nobody dared suggest Mycroft as another judge in front of Sherlock.) There was discussion of each of them working in separate kitchens, but as Mrs Hudson’s kitchen was far better stocked than theirs, that would give a definite advantage. It was decided that they would both work in the kitchen of flat B, with duplicates of equipment donated by Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner. The results would be judged blind, so the doors to the kitchen would be closed until the finished product was presented.
Sherlock was already reaching down, pulling John’s cock toward him. “Yes,” he said, “see me, fuck me, come home.”
“Holmes, where I come from, men and men love each other without resorting to the behaviours described in those papers. They may share a home together.” In John’s time gay couples could marry, of course, but he couldn’t push the point too far in this era. “Women and women too.” He saw Holmes’ eyes widen in surprise. “Relationships with younger men and boys are a very different thing, and is rightly looked down upon and condemned. And while there are people who prefer to dress as the other sex, that is not the same as being g – homosexual; it is simply – loving each other.”
One, he could call the police and have them arrest John for indecency; that was unlikely, John rationalized. They had been surrounded by police back at Garrideb’s and he hadn’t said a word to them.
The sun was shining high through John’s window when they woke late the next morning. They had moved closer to each other in their sleep, their arms and legs tangled together. Their eyes opened at nearly the same time, gazing at each other, waiting for the other to panic, or make a joke, or bolt.
John left his vidder on and running. He laid down on his bed, still dressed in his tweed suit. He let his hand brush the place on his leg where the bullet had grazed him, and said quietly, “I’ll get back to you soon, Sherlock.”
John’s mouth twisted, and he stepped even closer to Sherlock. “Listen to me,” he hissed. “I swear to God, Sherlock, I will get you out of here. All right? I won’t let it happen, let them keep you as their… pet, their wind-up toy.
Sherlock saw Commissioner Yun, holding a plate full of strawberries, looking around the room. “Indeed. I’ll let you get back to your work, preventing violence in the halls of the elite.”
,” Holmes said sharply. “I have learned over my years of strange cases, Inspector Martin, to not make conclusions regarding a case until you are in possession of all the facts, otherwise, the facts will align themselves to meet your erroneous conclusions.”
“Let me handle this, Maja, just be quiet!” John turned back to Sherlock, his eyes flicking up to the camera over the door of the room. He nodded small to Sherlock.
“I am sure she is in good hands with Doctor Reeve,” John said, trying to hide his relief. He had medical experience, but it was twenty-first century experience and he would likely be quite useless to help the woman without the aid of temp gauges and heartmos. “I will consult with him later but for now I will assist Mr. Holmes.”
“You told me, but I wasn’t listening,” John said. A terrible sadness welled up in him, and the sadness pulled him to his knees. “I didn’t listen, and you do.”
Sherlock paused a moment, listening to his own brain. “Yessss,” he said uncertainly, then “Yes! Oh, thank God, John. Thank you.”
Bahdri sighed. “A bit. It’s all still rumour, of course. That there was some massive slippage on some drops and Lassiter panicked. You know how risk-averse he is.”
“I’ve told Hierlihy that he can mark his own midterms and take his holidays in February like everyone else. And I’ve moved your thesis date to June 21, you’ll be back in plenty of time.”
They left the shed. John noted that there were far fewer actors in the backstage area; the play must be at its climax, or near the end. He followed Sherlock/Victor deeper in the woods behind the stage with no discernable footpath, the dialogue from the play clear and distinct in the still woods. They were far enough for John to start looking behind him nervously when Sherlock/Victor pointed and said, “Look, there!”
. “You know, I heard a rumour about her once – that she was very ill as a young woman, and was cured by a doctor and his sister that she travelled with out in the Rim.”
“Half ten.” John looked at his watch. “Christ, I’ll be late. D’you think the Tube is faster, or the bus across Baker Street and down Woburn?”
“She never loved me,” John said quietly. “I know that now. Even at the beginning, when we first met, it was all a front. After we were married, she barely hid it anymore. I can see that. I didn’t want to, but now I do.”
“We caught him red-handed,” Anderson said, his voice rising in volume and pitch. “That’s sufficient to indict him.”
“Yes, exactly. I never understand how you know, but yes,” Yun said as he accepted his tea cup. “This smells – oh – it’s like an oolong but somehow…”
“However, we need to consider our own situation. We can simply remove ourselves from sight, which will reduce or eliminate suspicion.”
He had said those words to one other person in his life, and both people in that tiny room missed that same person intensely.
“Do explain, Janina,” Sherlock drawled, working to hide his confusion. “Don’t waste time. I have a performance to prepare for, as you recall.”
“He says it’s fine.” Dunworthy glared at John. “All right, he says it’s at 85%, but another month of physio and muscle enhancers should get it up to capacity.”
The guests had cleared out remarkably quickly, in deference to Rosie's impending bedtime. Rosie had made a token protest but gave into exhaustion and was soon out cold on her cot, bum up in the air, thumb in mouth.
He looked at Holmes, whose face was leaned against the train window, his expression lined and stoney, and John only felt a wave of feeling and tenderness, followed by a wash of dread.
“Certainly I can,” Janina said, examining her fingernails, ignoring Sherlock’s distress completely. “I was instrumental in the planning, you see. They welcomed my ideas.”
Sherlock circled the table in the morgue. He had changed into what he called his ‘working clothes’: sturdy cotton and denim in greys and browns. They allowed him to move more freely while not drawing attention to himself.
John stepped back, and Sherlock moved to his brother. Mycroft lifted his hand to shake, but Sherlock raised his arms to embrace his brother for the first time since they were children. He heard Mycroft huff in surprise, but then Mycroft’s hands patted his back, briskly but with genuine feeling. They separated, and nodded briefly.
There’s a long moment of silence, both of them frozen, John on the sofa with the note still between his fingers, Sherlock with his coat half on, his face pale.
Claire told me to start getting biscuits in, not just sandwiches. Right now, I am so grateful to Claire I could hug her.
Sherlock opened his mouth to retort that a child who had to cover for his alcoholic mother and give his sister the birthday she wanted could not possibly constitute a ‘sin’, but then the timer rang for the cakes to come out of the oven, and the moment passed.
A wave of exhaustion flooded over him. He lay down on the sofa, his head on the opposite side from John, folding his legs around John’s like a puzzle piece.
Sherlock stared at the board a moment, then knocked over his king. “A good game. Excellent.” He stood. “Thank you. I should go; thank you for meeting with me.”
There was a rocking chair in John’s room that Mrs. Hudson had contributed when John had moved back in, and John heard Sherlock settling into it now.
“Not terribly – I just needed a few things. Did you know I collected handcuffs, Watson?” Holmes said, pulling a pair from the desk. “This is a marvellous example, the latest thing, just remarkable. Ah!” Holmes turned as a boy appeared in the doorway. “Cab’s here, is it? Ask the cabbie to come up, Wiggins, he can help us with a few things.”
Sherlock gave a smile, it was a weak one, but the best he could do. The gate opened, and Pavlović released his grip on Sherlock’s arm. After a second of hesitation, Maja did as well.
Mycroft’s face changed into the expression he knew so well – exasperated and impatient. “Didn’t you hear me? Moriarty is finished.”
The two guards shoved John back into the centre of the room, then left, closing the door behind them. The click of the lock was loud in the room.
“I can see you are,” Sherlock said, his voice suddenly lower and more serious than it had been earlier. “But you’ve made your wings visible on this occasion. May I ask why?”
“Someday,” John whispered brokenly into his ear, “I’m going to make love to you lying down. In a bed and all.”
Sherlock was getting out of the bath when John quickly typed out a message and pressed Send before he could talk himself out of it again. Then he stood and walked back to the bathroom, saying, “Let’s change that dressing.”
John saw the light go on again in Holmes’ face, and saw determination fill his frame. “You are correct, my dear Watson,” he said. “She couldn’t have done it. The note was clearly from a third party – ‘Elsie, prepare to meet thy God’. She didn’t commit this heinous act, and we shall prove it. You can try to save her life, and I will try to save her from the gallows.”
JOHN: It’s all blending together. And we’ve read enough about this virus to know that we need to self-isolate for at least fourteen days, so we haven’t been out since we arrived.
John saw the disadvantage of working in an unfamiliar city. Sherlock had spent years getting to know London, and could identify the area that someone was from just from the sight of the mud on their shoes. Here, Sherlock was completely unfamiliar with the city and its geography; being on a completely different continent made a difference as well. He was trying to develop his knowledge of Toronto to the same level of his knowledge of London, except in a few days instead of over a lifetime.
“I think I’ll make it, if I can make the connection at Bond Street. If I don’t, I’ll go up to Oxford and see if I can hail one. Can’t be late. This job would be fantastic.”
John: definitely British, had seen combat as a soldier, wounded in action several years ago, ergo the cane. Slight hand tremor. Restless sleeper. Not currently lying, but certainly keeping some secrets.
“You stupid shit!” John screamed. “It’s not just you anymore! Somehow, I don’t know how, but somehow now I’m responsible for your idiot arse. Did you know that?”
Holmes’ hand moved rapidly, filling in letters, and talking constantly about the logic of solving the code. It reminded John of the crosswords his grandmother had been fond of – though she had done them on her tablet with a letterpen.
John sighed and shivered. He’d exchanged his itchy suit for a somehow equally itchy cotton nightshirt which he’d bought that afternoon, upon realizing that Wardrobe hadn’t supplied him with any night clothes. He crawled under the covers, and let his teeth chatter until his body heat took over.  He wondered what Mr. Dunworthy would have made of the day he’d experienced.
Sherlock’s head tilted to the side, and he studied John carefully. “You’re lying to me,” he said, his voice half wonder and half horror.
“The museum’s a few kilometres north of that tower,” Sherlock said. “Right in the heart of the city.”
Several days passed, and they were no closer to an answer than the moment they had arrived at the museum.
“The Gray’s Anatomy book. When it came up for sale I mentioned it to Mrs. Hudson, thinking to buy it, but I never said that to any newsvidder. My interest in chemistry is well known, but I’ve never publicly mentioned my fascination for human anatomy. When I saw the book, and the way in which you drew my attention to it, made me realize that you’d been listening in.”
“Nowhere today,” John said. He poured himself a cup of tea from the pot, still steaming; Mrs. Hudson must have only just left it. “Tea?”
Sherlock frowned at him. The man must be irredeemably stupid. “I won’t get shot the moment I step outside?”
Sherlock put his phone in his jacket pocket and glanced over at Rosie, still happily watching telly. He glanced at his watch – ten minutes now.
John had not broken his gaze with Sherlock. They stared at each other as John took off his belt and unzipped his flies. With every passing moment Sherlock was getting harder, and for a brief second he wondered if he had misjudged, if he was about to be terribly embarrassed, but then John slid off his trousers and pants to reveal his own hard and heavy cock, bobbing in the air as John straightened.
Sherlock allowed a moment to pass, to wrap his dignity around himself, to let these two know that he wasn’t a fool and would not be taken in again, then took the proffered hand. “Sherlock Holmes.”
As they rode up the elevator, John said, “Are you going to let me have some peace this evening, or are you going to play your goddamn music all night again?”
“Mr. Bantam!” he called, shifting into a half-jog that looked a bit more like ‘trying to catch up’. “Mr. Bantam, may I have a word? I’m from the National Theatre in London.”
Cursing quietly into the rough shingle, Sherlock turned his head and looked down the other side of the building. No car, but no downspout either. The building was several stories high, and a jump would only merit him a broken leg, and he’d still be captured by the morons in the car; all they had to do was walk to the other side of the building and pick him up.
“Mycroft infiltrated the prison and got me out. He insists on taking credit for it, even though I had gotten the keys from the jailer moments before he revealed himself.”
His doctors agreed, and Sherlock suffered another night in hospital, under protest. The hospital staff clearly suffered as well, as there was no argument from them when Sherlock called John at six the next morning to help him get discharged. John recognized the wide-eyed, frantic look on the nurses’ faces, and signed the document releasing Sherlock into his care.
Rosie’s eyes were starting to droop as she finished the stew, and her protests about bedtime were habitual only. She fussed a little about sleeping on the floor until Sherlock reminded her about camping, then created a kind of nest for her with his coat, wrapping the sleeves around her little body until she was giggling sleepily.
“All of it,” Mycroft said grimly, and Sherlock had a flash of what the Serbian government was in for.
“On the whole, not a lot of physical damage, at worst a cracked rib. There’s some bruising on his face and knuckles, so he fought hard.”
John swung back into the room and swiftly untied the rope from the sill. It fell, softly hitting the side of the building beside Sherlock and Maja. Sherlock couldn’t move his eyes from the dangling rope until it stilled, then forced himself to look up at John in the window.
The next day, the text arrives. 10:01am. Not too early, not too late. On the hour, which means he’s been thinking about when to text, but not exactly on the hour so I don’t think he’s too obsessed.
“She asked to be extradited, apparently. I had nothing to do with the negotiations, I swear, John. It was all Mycroft. He said that she’d rather take her chances with the Serbian government than be handed over to the UN. Mycroft didn’t tell the Serbs that, of course, but he got you back. He got you back, and I won’t apologize for that. I would have done anything to get you back. ”
His hand stilled suddenly as his brain tripped over an unwelcome thought. How would he clean himself up when he came? The sheets, his handkerchief, the undergarments? Mrs. Hudson did all the laundry. He couldn’t bear the idea of the evidence of his self-pleasuring being seen by anyone else, much less someone he had to look in the eye every day. No disposable tissues invented yet either.
Mycroft swept into the room and sat, unbuttoning his jacket. “As a first order of business, please be informed that Maja Watson, aka Mary Morstan, aka AGRA, formerly of the CIA, professional free-lance spy and assassin, wanted in at least five different countries, was immediately searched and disarmed by the security staff here, and she is now being held in a secure room in the embassy, guarded by the best on staff. I assume she is the one who shot you?”
John’s breath stuttered in his chest when he realized what Sherlock meant. Sherlock looked up at him, looking vulnerable and young.
Jerome drove them all to the park in his cluttered car. Sherlock claimed the front seat again, but kept twisting around to talk to John in the back.
“I had been backed into a corner, and Moriarty was using my vulnerabilities against me. I felt there was only one solution open to me, and I took it. But I realized later, when I came back, that the ramifications were greater than I had ever anticipated – that I had forever broken your trust in me.”
They kissed as they calmed, John running his fingertips through the come on his chest. “Want me to get a flannel?”
I'm so grateful to everyone who's been reading and commenting and stuck with this story through the angst-y parts. It's a steady climb from here.
There was a bead of sweat on John’s right temple. A single drop of sweat, resting there. The room had disappeared to Sherlock. He and John were dancing inside a bubble, where only they and the music existed. John was dancing with skill, dancing with Sherlock better than anyone ever had, and dancing with so much effort that he was sweating. Sweating and smiling at Sherlock.
It took forever to fill the tub, which was just enough time for John to convince Sherlock to take his coat and clothes off, and for Sherlock to adjust to the room. Finally John shut off the taps, and Sherlock stood next to the tub, eyeing it warily.
SHERLOCK: …No. [Sherlock tries to look stern but for a moment looks at John, unguarded and affectionate. Heart emojis appear.]
Every night, Rosie asked to see the picture of her daddy to say goodnight. Despite his worry about the decreasing power on his phone, he could not deny her this single comfort. One night, after Rosie was asleep, he gave into his own weakness and gazed at John’s picture for several minutes, until he saw the percentage of power drop by one, and he shut it off in horror and self-recrimination for his selfishness.
“No, I didn’t.” The last of the tension fell away from John, and he lay down again. “Maybe we can clear enough space in the engine room to dance.”
“I-” Sherlock started, cleared his throat and started again, looking haughty. “I had a clue, a – a theory, and-”
Time bent. It stretched and wobbled around him. It roared and whispered, it became a chain across his back, it became Rosie’s soft hand on his face.
They each stood, and from either side of the bed, removed article after article of clothing. Waistcoat, braces, shirts, trousers, sock garters, and finally the smallclothes. John stood for a moment, staring at Sherlock: his gooseflesh rising up in the cool of the room, his long lines of muscle and skin, wiry and muscular. His cock was thick and heavy, lifting up from a dark thatch of hair. Sherlock was staring at John, his hands twitching to cover his genitals. John felt a little self-conscious too, knowing his own stocky body was nothing like Sherlock’s graceful beauty. He crawled back up onto the bed again, and Sherlock followed after only a second of dazed hesitation.
“Your shoulder. You hold it stiffly when you walk. Less so when you dance, so the injury was more than just getting grazed.”
Sherlock realized his eyes were damp, but when he got the courage to look up he saw that John was in a similar state.
“That’s what I meant.” John sat carefully on the edge of the bed; he was slightly worried it would start to spin.
Then breakfast. He was grateful that, like John, she was not a fussy eater, and while she explained to him at great length that porridge was for breakfast and not stew, she did accept what she was given. There had been some milk in the refrigerator that Sherlock had grabbed in his haste the day before, and while it was warm, it had not gone off. He made Rosie drink her fill first, encouraged her to drink even more, until she declared herself full; he drank the rest before the smell of it filled the little room.
The moment the door shut behind them, Sherlock and Maja turned to John. “Hurry!” Sherlock whisper-hissed, and Maja frantically beckoned him on. John moved a few more inches towards them, then hesitated.
John looks tired suddenly, and I can nearly read his thoughts; he thinks I’ve come to break it off. Well, I have but it’s more complicated, isn’t it?
Sherlock swallowed and shrugged. “No one. Nobody. He helped me on a case or two. Clearly he became obsessed with me. Annoying.” He was pleased that he kept his voice calm and even.
John nodded, and he seemed to be accepting Sherlock’s new attitude with that nod. He gestured to the woman. “My wife, Maja.”
“I know, I’m sorry,” Greg said. He put his key in the door and unlocked it. Sherlock came out with immense dignity.
Strong hands grab his face and stop him from moving. Sherlock’s mouth presses back against his, the full lips now wet and salty against his own. John kisses back, letting his hands find purchase in Sherlock’s curls, before using them to pull Sherlock back to look at his face.
Cool hands frame my face. A deep, soft voice calls my name. The laughter fades away, and my eyes blink open to see pale blue ones piercing into my own. Breathing rapid, I can feel the sweat clinging to my skin. “Sherlock?” I mumble through my quick, short breaths. A crinkle forms between my brows, and my gaze flicks to the crib, Sherlock's hands still holding my head in place. “Rosie?”
Relief floods John as he wordlessly nods and cups the back of Sherlock’s head in his hand, guiding them back, after so many years apart, closer now than they had been before. Ready to start again, but this time, the right way. Together.
When John realizes that encompasses the whole of his current feelings—anger, hurt, betrayal—he repeats the phrase again, quieter, almost to himself. “I thought you trusted me.”
My lips press together into a thin line. I remember that look from the last slip into drugs Sherlock had taken. It is one of the scariest things I have seen too. Sherlock carries on, “Mycroft realized that I was ripping myself apart in that rehab. He took me out and moved me into his house. He convinced Lestrade to work with me, under the condition that I never came onto crime scenes high again. The time in the hospital brought me through the withdrawal, but Mycroft and Lestrade, they saved my life, my mind."
“Talk!” Her voice is stern. The handle doesn’t budge when John tries to turn it. “I’m not letting you two out of there until you do!” The door muffles the sound of her heels clicking against the floor as she walks away.
Lestrade glances between the two fuming men before settling on Sherlock. “Well, I’m not firing him. If you have anything else for me, give it now. If not, get out of here. There’s nothing more you can do.” Without a word, Sherlock turns on his heel and heads out the door. As he does, Anderson makes the mistake of muttering “freak” under his breath loud enough for John to hear. Before he can calm himself, John punches Anderson square on the jaw hard enough to make his knuckles sting. Anderson falls back into the wall, Sherlock spins back into the room, and Lestrade leaps up from his chair.
Slamming the window shut, Sherlock tosses the dustbin on the desk and strides across the sitting room, his hands sliding over John’s front, fingers lacing behind his neck. “Don’t care about them,” he announces, leaning forward to drag his lips along the edge of John’s jaw. “Okay, I’m finished. Arse licking now, please.”
I turn towards him, his brow wrinkled and a frown pulling down the corners of his mouth. After clenching and unclenching my fist a few times to release some of the tension in them, I trust myself only enough to speak through gritted teeth. “Sherlock, I watched you fall at
Sherlock scoffs at him and attempts to find his footing, but the floor is unexpectedly slippery, and he nearly loses his legs from beneath him again. Snorting, John rolls his eyes.
After cleaning up, I return to my chair. It’s a safe place to rest, listening to Sherlock play and knowing he is alive and back in Baker Street. Better than in my room without this, without him, without Rosie. His music wraps around me. Like a warm, weighty blanket, it pulls me into rocking streams, warm arms, small smiles, and dark curls. I don’t fall into a deep sleep as I listen to him play through the hours, standing vigil over me, but I do rest more completely than I have in weeks. Lulled by the security, I mutter, “This is what I missed the most while you were gone.”
I can see the expression on his face change. He knows what I am doing, but plays the game anyway, a sense of gratefulness slipping into his words.
“Because I want people to know you are my papa, Papa.” With wide eyes, Sherlock looks back at John. A small smile creeps onto John’s face, and he says with a half-shrug, “It would make everything a bit easier, honestly. Explaining it sometimes has been... quite the hassle.” Sherlock blinks, stunned. Seeing the stress creeping into Sherlock's frame, John amends, “If you don’t want to, that’s fine too.”
When Sherlock comes back, he sits down, and slides something across the table to me. I glance at the paper, and my heart splits in two. It’s all I can do not to gag. He kept the damn thing.
My heart drops into my stomach, and I could feel my face fall with it. Without even needing to think on the answer, the words blurt out. “No, Sherlock, not even then.”
Smiling down at him, I give a short nod. “Of course.” After a quick rinse of the mugs, I place them in the sink and resign myself to a rough night of sleep. Hearing Sherlock’s story and bringing forth my own memories of Afghanistan makes it inevitable. I knew that from the beginning. Upstairs, I crawl into bed, being careful to not wake Rosie as she sleeps in her crib on the other side of the room. When the sounds of Sherlock’s violin waft up the stairs and wrap me in warmth and comfort, I can't help but smile at the familiar refrains. Drifting off, I hope that it won't be a bad night after all.
Thankfully, due to time, therapy, and talking through them, the frequency of the nightmares have decreased over these past few years. But they have never truly stopped.
John frowns but rises to his feet, bemused. “But…” he looks around. Sherlock is nowhere in sight. “Now?”
“Yeah, well, it might keep me from strangling you to death,” John shoots back, tossing pillows and blankets at Sherlock from a distance. “I think that would be much more detrimental to both of us.”
The rest of the trip is rife with tense, awkward silence, and it creeps into my spine, my shoulders, my jaw—my goddamn scalp feels tight. When we finally make it back to the flat, I head straight to the kitchen and begin doling up food, not bothering to take off my shoes or coat. Sherlock lingers by the entryway, peeling off his gloves, his Belfast, undoing the laces on his shoes one bloody pull at a time. Bloody sod. Avoiding me.
you have to wear a mask. Don’t even think about breathing near me. And you will stay in your zone.” Sherlock huffs but relents, following at a distance as they climb the stairs to 221B.
“Your daddy is right you know,” Sherlock says in a soft, low voice, “we both love you so much." He leans down and presses a kiss into her soft curls. "I made a vow a long time ago to protect you, and I am not about to give that up now.” After a few minutes wrapped in her fathers’ arms, Rosie's crying turns into sniffling, her breathing relaxing back into a normal pattern.
“Oh, Rosie, love, what’s wrong?” he asks, already pulling her onto the bed. Sherlock shuffles over so Rosie can lie down in-between them, to surround her with their presence.
Finishing my glass, I stand up and pat him on the shoulder in a stiff manner, trying to reinstate some of the friendly boundaries that once sat between us. Sherlock looks up at me, still open, and the rest of it crumbles.
A thought pops into my head, remembering our earlier conversation. “Only if you talk while you play.” He considers this, rises, and preps his violin.
I take a moment to process his confession. It sinks through my skin and permeates my bloodstream, making its way to and through the blockade that had formed around my heart. I was his reason for returning. I had been with him the whole time he was away. When the wall finally falls, I am left raw and vulnerable.
have the Coronavirus, then sticking me in a flat contaminated by damp is hardly beneficial for my respiratory health.”
“Yes, well. I suppose that's true. They are hard and too real and inevitably put me in a sour mood." I can feel my brow furrow and the bite of the teacup in my palm. "It’s hard. It's hard watching your friends—the people you love—die over and over again while you try to do everything you can to save them from bleeding out underneath your hands, and...and you just can’t.”
He steps through the door and pauses, looking up to find Sherlock standing at the other end of the room. John frowns and turns to question Mrs. Hudson, but the door closes in his face, and John’s words die in his throat. He hears the click of the lock, and his eyes widen.
“Sherlock.” His name feels like sandpaper in my throat, raw and scrapped. With a loud swallow, I stare into his pale, cold eyes, pleading with him to understand. “Sherlock, you know, you
“I know. I know you are. And I get it. I’m still mad at you for not telling me. But at least now I get why you… went through with it,” I mutter against his chest, avoiding the actual words that have haunted me. Rubbing my face against the fabric of his shirt, I am not ready to let go quite yet, not ready to have the proof of his existence out of arm's reach. But I let him go anyway and take a half step away from him. The loss of his warmth reaches down into my marrow, chilling my heart. “Tea?”
Soft eyes and a small smile form on Sherlock’s face as he interrupts John’s stuttering. “John. Stop it. I never thought I’d get the chance to do that, ever. Please…” he bites his lower lip before looking directly into John’s eyes, “Please, kiss me again.”
I bolt upright in bed, gasping for air, no longer feeling the needles in my lungs. I search out John’s eyes, his calm but concerned eyes.
John returns home after a quick trip to the store, a bag of ideas in hand. Sitting in his chair, legs curled up beneath him, Sherlock looks up from his pout with interest. “What did you buy?”
Before Sherlock even begins to start talking, which is almost immediately, Anderson’s expression is so sour it looks like he just put several sour candies in his mouth, arms crossed, and fuming. Then, Sherlock’s voice fills the room.
Growling, Sherlock bangs on the door. To their surprise, it opens without resistance. Sherlock shoots John a look, who just shrugs. They leave the room and hurry upstairs. Back in 221B, Sherlock whirls and tries to back John against the wall. John fends him off with ease.
“John,” Sherlock whispered again as he leaned forward, hot breath puffing across John’s face. “Please.” John felt the word spoken against his lips, barely there, ghosting its presence against his mouth.
I can tell he doesn’t understand because his hand drops away and it takes a moment for him to respond. “Why would you have nightmares about St. Bart’s? You’re a doctor. You see hospitals and patients all the time. You work with me. You were a soldier, so it can’t be the morgue." Sherlock pauses in consideration, and I can hear the rapid-fire whirl of his brain. "Or can it? Did something happen that I don’t know about?”
She settles into the armchair on one side of the coffee table and indicates for us to sit on the chairs or couch opposite. John turns a questioning gaze to me, letting me decide on our seats. Unsure how much or how little closeness is expected in an environment like this, I choose the couch, allowing John to fill in the gaps on this particular social nicety. He sits next to me with a small space between us but close enough for our knees to press together. As he relaxes into the back cushion, he crosses an ankle over his knee.
“Of course. I noticed almost immediately after you moved in. But you haven’t said. Do you want me to play?” A gruffness bleeds into Sherlock's voice as he talks, a mild annoyance at the repetition.
The words rush out of me, leaving me breathless and flayed. The air between us is wrought with the images of my nightmares, hovering, thick and sticky with blood and sweat. I can feel Sherlock's eyes on me, waiting for me to continue. Patient. Kind. With a deep breath that blows the scenes out from between us, I'm able to start again. “Having to re-live my worst days, well, I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.” With the corner of my mouth beginning to curl up and a one-armed shrug, I add, “Well, except for maybe Mycroft.”
Sherlock cocks an eyebrow. “Mrs. Hudson still has Rosie. Perhaps something a bit stronger?” I nod once in response, and Sherlock takes down two tumblers and the bourbon. After pouring us two fingers each, I watch his slender fingers recap the bottle, imagining what they might feel like in my hair, across my skin, intertwined with mine, any form of connection.
Trapped, John finally turns around. Still standing at the other end of the room, Sherlock watches him warily. He looks tense, hands stiff at his side as his pale eyes dart over John. They settle on John’s wristwatch and narrow.
The doorbell rings, and I jerk awake. I hadn’t realized I was even falling asleep. While Sherlock keeps playing his soothing songs, I go downstairs to retrieve the food. After preparing the plates for us, I walk to the couch and set them on the coffee table. He puts his violin down and pretends to join me for dinner, which consists of him pushing food around his plate and stealing forkfuls from mine. Without having said a word, we finish eating, a comfortable and full silence, elbows bumping and knees brushing. The ease between us beginning to return. Knowing the request without me having to speak it again, Sherlock goes back to his playing,.
, and Sherlock recoils in shock. Before he can fully recover, John is standing, his hands flexing helplessly at his sides, his expression twisting, clearly preparing himself to say…
“No, stay. As I already said..." I pinch the bridge of my nose in mild irritation, "and you know how I hate repeating myself, I don’t know how to do this." Throwing my hands in the air to imply the whole situation, I clarify. "I don’t know the expectations of routine or of sleeping arrangements or of clothing choices. I just don’t know. I’ve never done this before, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want you here.”
When they wake, they are both hard and aching, hungry for one another. John takes his time working Sherlock’s body open, his fingers slow and thorough so he can fuck fast and rough the second he slips into Sherlock’s tight heat. John shags Sherlock into a daze, leaving Sherlock to drift around the flat afterwards. He is quiet, his expression dreamy, content to pluck at the strings of his violin in aimless variations of partial songs.
“Is there room for one more before dinner?” John asks, already moving to lay down on the edge and wrapping around Rosie from the other side. Sherlock throws the couch pillows to the ground to give them more room, the routine figured out over several previous failed attempts. Rosie giggles as her fathers shift around her trying to make enough room. Once everyone is settled, she declares, “Papa had another nightmare, Daddy.” John looks into Sherlock’s eyes over her head, asking the same question they always ask.
“Oi!” John calls after the blur heading through the door. He rushes out after him, snatching Sherlock’s sleeve just inside the hall. “You can’t just leave the slides there, you git. You have to clean it up!”
I nod in understanding. Sherlock is not one to feel obligated by or to anyone or anything, but he values his work, and they had given him that. With a deep breath, Sherlock looks towards the window, and in an almost whisper adds, “Sometimes, I dream about being forced into that rehab again, dying day by day, minute by minute, losing everything I have come to care about.” Glancing to me, I see the unshed tears in his eyes. “I can’t lose Rosie, John,” his voice hitches and cracks, “I can’t.”
, I correct myself, knowing full well I’ve fucked it all up. I put the plates onto the table, sliding them into place, my arms too heavy to do much else. Plopping into a chair, I decide how to make this up to him, if I can make this up to him. With how much I have hurt him, physically and emotionally over the years, he deserves so much better, deserves... not me. My stomach roiling, I push a piece of broccoli around my plate with a fork, staring at the patterns it makes in the sauce.
Sherlock freezes before the open window, dustbin suspended as he turns to John with wide, dismayed eyes. “Wait, does that mean you won’t lick my arsehole now?” His voice drifts through the open window, and John scrubs at his face with a groan.
As I gaze at him trying to determine what I had been hearing but glad he's finally getting some rest, his head starts rocking back and forth. A repeated “No” escapes his contorted expression, each repetition louder than the last.
“It’s whatever I want it to be!” Sherlock snaps, forcing a fake cough as he fumbles with the door to 221C. “Don’t talk to me until I’ve been cleared, or… or I’m
—that you never deserve to be attacked like that. No matter if you had done something or not. But I don’t blame you for her death, for leaving, for any of it, and I never should have. I took it out on you, and that was absolutely wrong. I’m sorry. I am so sorry. I'm a monster, Sherlock. I'm such a monster.” Those last sentences come out in whispers.
The next thing Sherlock was cognizant of was clearly a few minutes later, and John was curled around Sherlock’s side, breathing hard against his neck, and his cock softening against Sherlock’s hip.
“Better hurry,” Sherlock said. “That guard will be calling his supervisor in a minute. Or getting in his own car. I don’t think that’s just a stage door guard.”
Sherlock sighed pointedly. “The other night you said you were going out for a drink. Most people go for a drink in their own locale, so you live in the Eavesdown Docks area. I did a search for all the John Watsons in Persephone City, then eliminated those without the 33 area code for Eavesdown. That narrowed the search down to four John Watsons, so I called each of them until I got you. JHWATSO33-1895. What does the H stand for?”
“Oh, not to worry, I’m friends with all the local crack junkies. We have supper parties sometimes, borrow an egg, that kind of thing.” He laughs, that’s good, laughing is good. “But I will accept the offer, thanks.”
Sherlock took advantage of his captor’s fall, twisting out of his arms and using his elbow to strike at the back of the man’s head. The man went down and did not move.
,” John sang back, singing through his dry throat. He took another sip of whisky to wet it. “Um,” he said, not sure what to do with the electricity he was sensing in the room.
I had figured out by then that when Sherlock is embarrassed or flustered, he gets all haughty and snooty, making a cutting comment and then walking away. This time, however, he took my hands in his and explained that he and John had talked at length about this, with John expressing the same concerns, and he, Sherlock, wanted to assure us both that he was all right with it. “Because I trust you,” he said. “I know you won’t hurt him, and you understand his role in my life, and mine in his. You won’t try to get between us. You believed in us before we understood it ourselves. And we want you to be a part of us. The... affection flows in all directions. None of the three of us is the third wheel. Equal. All right?”
He saw her finger tightening on the trigger, and he leapt sideways out of the way. He heard the whine of the bullet passing him, and he rolled over his shoulder back to his feet.
A few moments later, I’ve got a pair of sleep pants and an old concert t-shirt of John’s on, and Sherlock settles in on my other side. John sleeps on his back, but both Sherlock and I are side sleepers, so he curls up behind me. He reaches one incredibly long arm over me, and puts his hand on John’s stomach. I have my head on John’s shoulder, and put my hand on top of Sherlock’s.
John looked up to the policemen, who were standing in shock, their arms still up as if they held an invisible Hope. They stared at him for a long moment until John snapped, “Well?”
John slumped, his whole body collapsing. The guards stepped forward to support him. One produced a key and unlocked John’s handcuffs, and his arms fell limply by his sides. Mycroft extended his hand to shake, and it was clearly an effort for John to return the gesture.
“Quite right,” Holmes said. “You listened to his heart, heard his aneurysm. I doubt he’ll live to see his trial.”
Sherlock looked at John, tense, worried and clearly anticipating the jealousy, but instead John squeezed his hand. “It’s all right. Go and check us in.”
“It was awful,” Juliet said. “The way he was shaking. And then Lexie came and stuck her fingers down his throat. Now I’ve got
“Who’s asking?” Dimmock’s eyes flickered to his own screen, and his face shifted into something quite different. “Ah. The great Sherlock Holmes. I’ve heard about you.”
Then Mycroft sat back, his face a miasma of emotions – disbelief, shock, and a tiny touch of gladness. “I see, Sherlock,” he said quietly. “I see. Oh, Sherlock.”
Holmes’ expression was unreadable – not angry, not frightened, just blank. John felt slow horror creeping up his chest, and for a moment he thought he was going to be sick.
The mirth drains from his eyes, his face. Lowering his mug, his eyes following it, Sherlock asks, “What if your worst days are your fault, and only yours? Would you deserve it then?”
With every step further into the flat, Sherlock leans more heavily on John, the exhaustion starting to take its toll. Placing him into one of the kitchen chairs, John steps back and scans Sherlock’s face, his body, as he begins to slump over the table with stiff, slow movements.
Shaking his head at the utterly brilliant dolt in front of him, John pulls out his phone to double-check the time. “Just gone seven. I got back a few hours ago, dropped off my stuff at Baker street, took a kip, and headed over here when you weren’t answering your phone.”
, then? Beat Moriarty, proved yourself the smartest, and now you can come home?” Even as the words leave his mouth, he regrets them, but Sherlock responds before he can apologize.
I rest a hand on his hip, fingers stiff, still unsure quite how all this is supposed to work. “Better?”
A couple weeks later finds us both back at Nancy’s office. After my session, I sit in the room outside, waiting for Sherlock to finish. My heart light and my brain foggy after the topic today, Chinese food sounds like the perfect companion meal to our duel session. With Rosie at Greg and Molly’s tonight, perhaps even a bottle of wine. A smile blooms on my face as I start to make plans for dinner and a cuddle, maybe some telly. Pulling out my mobile, I phone our favorite place and order takeaway for when Sherlock is done. Then, I settle in for a little nap leaning against the wall. One thing both medical school and the army taught me that continues to come in handy—nap when, where, and how you can.
“Aw, don’t take offense. Hey, you’d better get your wallet and get out of here. Might be hard to find a hovertaxi in this area but I can help you-”
“That… is an extremely long story. We’d have to walk to yours and then to Dover and back to cover it. Short version is that I didn’t take it well when he came back.”
Sherlock turned away and towards his room, dropping his bag with loose fingers on the bed. His head was full of a dull buzzing noise, and he couldn’t think, couldn’t feel. He would shower, and go to bed, and sleep and sleep and sleep, and if he was lucky, perhaps he wouldn’t wake to this nightmare.
“Delighted, Dr. Watson,” Holmes said. “But you’re not from Edinburgh, are you? Not recently, at any rate. Some family background, yes, but you’re a Londoner, from Notting Hill, or Kensington, I can tell from your shoes. But you have recently been in Afghanistan, I perceive?”
“All right, Sherlock. Be careful,” Mycroft said, and he sounded exactly how he used to sound when they were boys, when he sent Sherlock off to school, or when Sherlock was going for a walk on the estate.
John rewound the sentence in his mind, and felt his own blush rising up. “The – song. It was another song of hers – Björk.”
He turned onto Baker Street and stopped short. The street was a pile of debris, like all the other streets he had been on. For one wild moment, he wondered if he had gotten turned around and walked down the wrong street. This thought was reassuring until he caught sight of the Speedy’s overhang, tangled among bricks and stones.
“Oh no, it’s a very old dance, originating back on Earth-That-Was,” Sherlock said. “Fantastically complicated to perform, and occasionally dangerous if you don’t do it right. Marvellous music, though - do you hear the beat? It’s a 4/8 time, and most dance music is 4/4.”
John loved the way Sherlock said his name, as though it was a secret that only they shared. “We shall call each other ‘Watson’ and ‘Holmes’ when the door is open,” he said, “and ‘John’ and ‘Sherlock’ when the door is shut.”
He saw a tear begin to slip down her cheek, and he swiftly pressed his handkerchief into her hand. She smiled wetly at him and wiped at her eyes.
“You use that word so often, and yet you clearly don’t really know what it means,” Sherlock said, still focused on the body, trying to ignore the flood of information from the living people in the room. (Lestrade –
“My consolation is that the murderer is equally cold, wet and miserable, but has jail to look forward to. Are we going home?”
John considered heading after him for a moment, then realized that it was likely fruitless. When Sherlock wanted to go, there was no stopping him, especially when he had a few minutes’ head start. Then he realized that everyone was looking at him expectantly: Reynolds, the lab-coated young woman, Lestrade – even Donovan. The world’s only consulting detective was gone, and all that was left was the world’s only doctor/soldier/blogger/detective’s assistant, and it was up to him now.
He rattled off the list to Moira’s growing astonishment; she realized he was naming all the brands of items they had passed on their route through the store. “About half an hour, sir.”
John let himself into his rooms as complete helplessness washed over him. He pulled his jacket off, throwing it in a corner. He went to the toilet, and slowly shaved his mustache off.
Without hesitation, Sherlock crossed to the balcony edge and stepped onto it. The wind whipped harder at his hair, at his clothes. “This.”
But very faintly, underneath the dialogue from the stage, he could hear a muffled shouting inside the shed. He reared back and kicked at the door with all his strength, feeling the vibration shudder up his leg. Once, twice, and finally the wood around the lock splintered and gave way.
Over the rim of her glasses, she turns a pointed look to John. “Oh, did he now? He never mentioned that. Nor the fact you suffer from nightmares as well.”
The scrape of wood against tile reaches his ears. Looking back up, John finds Sherlock seated, hands folded on the small circular tabletop.
With a last once over, I can see John means it. He wants me to come with him. A flurry of apprehension flutters through my stomach. His therapist.
"The more complex answer has a lot more to do with what I think about myself, the way I was raised, how I handle my anger, the things I try not to admit to myself." With a shrug of my shoulder, I concede. "That's part of the reason for all the therapy. After... after the hospital, I knew... I knew I couldn't pretend anymore. I couldn't let myself slide through the sessions. And then after Eurus? God knows I needed it after that whole debacle."
“Well, perhaps. But it is likely in his list of worst days as well.” As I wait again for him to continue, I do my best to project a sense of calm, trust, understanding, knowing he would tell me if, or when, he was ready.
In a firm and slow voice, he replies, “No, you haven’t. I’ve been able to deduce the nights you do have them, even when you aren’t here at Baker Street. You always have a slight limp, a dark look, and you try to smile more, but it is never a true one on those days.”
Rosie nods, curls bouncing in every direction. John stares into Sherlock’s eyes, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. With another half-shrug, John adds, “Well, that, and marry me. It'll help with the whole name-change bit. And she's right. You're family, and I don't want you going anywhere.” John wraps a hand around Sherlock's waist and pulls him in closer without squishing Rosie.
“Right before I returned to London.” I remain stoic, hoping he doesn’t realize. I watch his face transform from concerned to confused to horrified to guilty. Of course he would realize.
“If it’s not drugs, then what is it?” the voice says in his ear. Greg swallows, sounding strained when he replies.
Stuffing the pillow under his head, John shifts in his chair and closes his eyes. The lingering scent of Sherlock is far more soothing than he cares to admit.
“It’s fine,” I say as I walk around to the other side and crawl into bed. Cocooning myself into my blankets, I attempt to take up less space than I usually would. John chuckles softly.
John takes this as the strange, macabre compliment that it is, and strokes Sherlock’s hip between thrusts until he comes with a sob.
By the time we finish, my shoulders are no longer taught nor near my ears, my fists unclench, my jaw is loose and hanging open, my eyelids pull toward the floor, and my cheek rests against the back of the chair. I haven’t been touched with such gentle, tender, nurturing care in what seems like forever. I had forgotten how much I crave it, need it. When all the scars on my back are cataloged, John rests a palm on the nape of my neck and gives a caressing squeeze, his fingers twining into the curls there.
With a scoff, Sherlock dismisses the comment with a wave of his hand. “Not if you know the markers to look for and aren’t…” he glares at Anderson, “
” he adds, as Sherlock sticks his tongue out toward the wall of a bus stop with a mutinous expression. John manhandles him down the sidewalk, snarling, “Stop licking things people have touched, you
But what had John meant about the complex answer being what he thinks about himself, the way he was raised, how he handles his anger? It still didn't explain why he stayed with Mary. Or, did it?
Biting my lips and squeezing my eyes shut, fists clamping into tight balls, I shake my head. “No, Sherlock. It will never happen again. It should have never happened in the first place.” I look over the expanse stretching, gapping, between us, and everything screams at me to make it stop, to reel him back closer. But I do my best to not force it. To only offer explanation. Let him choose. “Remember when I said that so much of the pain I have caused you was because of my own problems? This. This is one of those.”
With a sigh, Sherlock says, “If you must.” He pushes himself back up to sitting, the strain of the movement clear on his face, and unbuttons his jacket and shirt. The usually deft fingers shake slightly with the movements. When John returns, he sees the clothes hanging open over mottled skin, bruises in all stages of healing. The sight catches the breath in his throat. Realizing that Sherlock hasn’t moved to take off the clothing, John places the first-aid kit on the table and stands in front of him.
Finally, they were sitting in the cab on the way back to Baker Street. Exhaustion won out, and after a whispered thank you, Sherlock’s body drooped into a loose-limbed puddle in his seat. John smiled as he took in the form next to him, gentle and calm in a way Sherlock only was when sleep took him. This was his second favorite Sherlock, just after rapid-fire-deduction Sherlock.
"These past few months, I have found a therapist I like. That I trust. We've been able to... uncover a lot." Rubbing a hand across the back of my neck, I catch Sherlock roll his eyes.
“I don’t know,” he mutters, looking away with a creased brow. “Maybe.” He catches Mrs. Hudson’s grin from the corner of his eyes.
“Alright then, I guess this is me.” John plops down on the edge of the bed and looks up at me while waving a hand toward the bathroom. “Go on and get ready. I’ll get everything settled in here.” Not quite sure what he means by that, I do what he says anyway, still in my clothes from the night before, and brush my teeth. Using the space to collect my thoughts, I stare into the mirror.
“I had a bad dream." She snuffles and wipes her nose and eyes with her forearm. "You and Papa were running off with Uncle Greggie and left me behind. But the dark, scary monster was under my bed the whole time, and you... you wouldn’t listen to me when I told you where it was. So you le—le—le—left me here with it. All by my—myself. And... and I didn’t want Mrs. Hudson to get hurt, so I... so I locked her out. Why, Daddy? Daddy, why did you leave me?” Her voice catches as tears stream down her plump cheeks. Her brows furrow with a glint of anger and hurt in her eyes.
John grabs his hand and gives it a small squeeze. “I figured, love. Don’t worry about it. Let’s just go rip Anderson a new one and then get some food in you. Sound good?”
Sputtering over his coffee, John responded, “Yeah. Of course I do.” He expected Sherlock to look up. It didn’t happen. With the tilt of his head, John set his mug down, rather forcefully, on the table. “Sherlock,” he said, crossing his arms. When he still didn’t receive the man’s attention, he asked, “What are you on about?”
Tired and not ready to have a deep, drawn-out conversation about why I had to be with Mary because the one I love would never love me back, I mutter, “I can't explain any better than that right now, Sherlock. Maybe later. But I should go back to bed.” I look towards the doorway, to the stairs, but I can't move. I stand there and just...
“Come to dust me again?” he asks sourly, shooting John a glower from under his lashes. Despite his attitude, the expression is rather endearing, and John finds himself tossing the hand at Sherlock without thinking.
Considering the request, I realize I only have Janine as a frame of reference. “I wouldn’t know. I don’t have much to go on.”
Sherlock affects a scandalized expression, but John sweeps him into the bedroom and drags him down to the bed before he can retort. After weeks of pent-up frustration, they come together in a frenzy, John claiming Sherlock’s mouth, his neck, the dip of his navel. When his lips slip over Sherlock’s straining cock, Sherlock’s moans and panting sighs fill the room, his hips lifting, shifting, desperate right up until John hollows his cheeks a final time, and Sherlock comes shouting.
Her smile smug, Mrs. Hudson flashes him a wink. “Don’t you forget it, Doctor Watson. Now,” Making shooing motions with her hands, she waves him out toward the stairs, “you best get back to your man.” They both look upwards at the sound of a thud above. “Preferably
John squints, a smirk playing at the edges of his lips. Rolling his eyes, he says, “Duh, I’m bisexual, genius.”
,” now, pointing at Anderson, “for gross incompetence.” He places the slide holder on the desk forcefully but still aware of the glass inside. “He misidentified
“Are you ready to try going back to sleep now?” His voice is so quiet and low that I almost don't hear him, but the proximity of his lips to my ear makes it impossible to miss, his warm breath electrifying my skin.
That gets a moan, and Sherlock presses himself close while pulling out of the kiss, dropping his forehead to mine.
With a deep sigh, Sherlock straightens his spine and lays it all out for Lestrade. John is doing his best to suppress his giggles in the background. Koalas and crime scenes and cuckholds, oh my. He already knows the title of this blog post.
With a sharp nod of understanding, I ask, “Is there anything else? I don’t wish to take up John’s time.”
John can’t help but roll his eyes. The stupid man would never stay in hospitals as long as he needed to. “Alright. Fine. Let me help though. Where does it hurt?”
Well, that explains the past few days. The poor sod doesn't want to go to sleep for fear of what his mind will bring him in the dark depths of night. With crossed arms and a soft shuffle, I position myself out of arm's reach by the couch.
John was still talking to the detective—John’s hand clapped to his shoulder, eyes crinkled from an open-mouthed laugh. That familiar ache spread through Sherlock’s chest. Could Mycroft be right?
The pun is horrific, and a startled laugh escapes John as he shakes his head. “Oh, you’re a menace, Mrs. Hudson.”
Smug and chuckling, John coos, “Aw, you’re just head over heels for me, aren’t you?” Sherlock shoots him a glare, his long legs reminding John of a baby deer taking its first steps.
A flurry of dark curls and swirling coat move past John, nothing cleaned from Sherlock’s experiment.
Tightening his hold on me once more, John's lips press into my curls. As he holds me there, he sighs, relaxing into our space. His warm breath against my scalp sends shivers down my spine.
John's eyes light up, and he gives a stiff nod. “Yeah, of course I will. I’ll see if she has one before or after mine so we can go together.”
There is hunger in Sherlock’s face, darkening his eyes. John sucks in a startled inhale at the sight and opens his mouth to speak.
I hadn’t realized how tense I was until my shoulders relax under his ministrations. As my breathing returns to normal and the shaking subsides, I can hear a soft shushing coming from above me, a cheek cushioned against my head.
The corner of John’s mouth turns up in that smile he gives when something pleases him and tries to hide it. “Alright then. I’ll let her know for the next session then.”
“My therapist would like to meet you, if you’re amenable. She says you can come to the beginning of the next meeting.”
When Lestrade has a chance to understand everything Sherlock just yelled at him, a look of utter confusion consumes his face. “Wait. Back up. Koala? Where did a koala come into all of this? What the hell are you on about, Sherlock?”
Startled from my reverie, I reach behind and turn off the lamp. It takes a moment for my eyes to adjust, and all I can hear is John’s steady breathing and my own heart pounding. “Sherlock, if this is stressing you out or if you can’t sleep, I promise I won’t be upset if you ask me to leave. I honestly don’t want you to be uncomfortable.”
“Serbia? What happened in Serbia?” Again, the crinkle between his brows but with the addition of a slight frown pulling at the corners of his mouth.
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to glance over her head to John before continuing, a look of helplessness in his eyes. “Well. Just like this, I suppose. I always do better when I can immediately be surrounded by my loved ones, especially in a cuddle like this.” He emphasizes the sentiment with a squeeze. “It also helps to be reminded of what is real. For example, in my nightmares, I lose you, your daddy, or the both of you, so being reminded that you are still here with me helps to ground me in reality, takes away the fear of the nightmares.” Pausing, Sherlock presses another kiss to the top of her head and squeezes the cuddle tighter. “This is why your daddy and I told you that we would listen to you. That we are here to protect you the best we can.”
At Rosie's name, light dances in Sherlock's eyes before he nods and pushes himself to stand, catching my hands with his own to pull me up along with him.
“Yeah. Alright. I’ll do it.” John watched as Sherlock’s shoulders visibly unfurled, and the tension in them dissipated. “What’s the plan, then?”
Each repetition cauterizes a weeping, open wound that I have caused him. For every harsh word, for every thrown punch, every poor joke, misjudgment, and brutalizing kick, I apologize, knowing I will have to make up for it the rest of my life. Prove to him he is deserving and loved. Prove to him I’ve changed. Prove to him that I love him and that I can love well.
Murmured words brush against my hair, barely audible. “That’s what mine are about, too. Losing the people I love.”
When he finishes the story, emotion spent, Sherlock’s body shivers and crumples, and he loses balance on his chair, starting to slide to the floor.
A half-smirk curls the corner of my mouth, and I press my forehead to his, eyes closed, and slip my hand around the nape of his neck, twining my fingers into his hair. “Always.”
Using what is left of my energy, I tear my gaze from his and start up a fire. The room—diffused with yellow light, filled with warmth, and the smell of home in winter—creates a cocoon of safety and becomes a place of healing. I turn to see Sherlock still looking at me, still playing. His eyes glow in the dim light and glance away for a brief moment before returning, searching my own. I can see the sharp lines overtaking the soft flow of his body as he prepares to say something. Dropping his bow and violin to his sides, Sherlock faces me, shoulders rounded with the weight of his thoughts. With one last glance to the floor, he presses his lips into a thin line before asking, “Do you think you will ever be able to forgive me?”
“I do, John. I always have.” An obvious swallow makes Sherlock pause. An earnest look of flashes across his face before he continues. “You have to believe me, John. There was no other way. I had to protect you. You, and Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade. I couldn’t…” his eyes close for a brief moment, brows furrowing together, “I couldn’t allow anything to happen to you. I wouldn’t have survived.” A few more words are mumbled under his breath that John chooses to ignore for now.
“Couple hours.” Sherlock nods and folds to the ground, gracefully sinking into his pile of blankets. After a moment, he tosses one to John, who wraps it around his shoulders to ward off the chill damp of the flat.
John interrupts, putting up a hand. “No. No, Sherlock.” He pinches the bridge of his nose, hoping to keep the tears at bay. Before he even knows what he is going to say, words tumble out of his mouth. “I thought you trusted me.”
Five minutes later, Sherlock licks a doorknob to identify a substance smeared on the dented metal. John struggles not to go nuclear. “Oh my
Walking back inside, Sherlock scrubs at his face, straightens his shoulders and sets about rearranging the tape in the sitting room to accommodate John’s habitual spaces. He’s thankful John has yet to ask for the body pillow and his jumper back. He’ll be needing it tonight.
Trying to settle, John shifts to get comfortable. When I realize he is on his left shoulder, I nudge him, pushing on his right one and urging him to turn. After slipping his arms out from under me, he rolls onto his other side, and I curl myself around him, pulling him into my blanket nest.
Around a few focused breathes, Sherlock responds, “Mostly, yes. But each time I took down another sect of Moriarity’s, they added their own scars. But...it was worth it.” The last words are said quieter than the rest.
When he shoots a glance over his shoulder, he finds John licking his lips, one pale eyebrow raised. Sherlock’s knees buckle, and he stumbles into the wall as all the blood in his body rushes southward.
Sighing, he avoids direct eye contact by looking out the window again, hands beginning to fidget with the teacup. "But my veins were aching, burning for my next hit. I arrived back at my flat—if you could call it that—and immediately went for a hypodermic. I was... distracted by the case, my excitement, and, admittedly, still disoriented from the drugs in my system. I miscalculated. Not only did I mix my solution wrong, I... I had forgotten how recent my last hit was. As soon as this one hit me, I regretted it."
“This help?” he gestures with his head, and my eyes follow. John had rearranged the blankets using a spare from the sitting room so that we each had one. I wouldn’t have to share my duvet. He must have pulled in an extra sheet as well.
“Well, he was the one to initiate the conversations. He told me about dreams he’s had of Afghanistan in hopes that I might open up about my own. Since then, we’ve talked through them and attempted to reassure each other amidst them.”
Together, arms slung around each other, holding each other up and each other close, they get Sherlock standing and head outside to find a cab, silence filling the space between them.
Sherlock’s eyes dart away. “Why would you think that?” he asks. His tone is flat, empty, but his fingers tug at his trousers, fidgeting and flighty. John watches the unsettled movements, sorting his thoughts before replying.
A few years down the road, Rosie comes home with Mrs. Hudson. With a pat on the head and a promise to pop by later, Mrs. Hudson leaves, and Rosie heads into the flat.
“Obvious!” Sherlock snaps, hurrying to retrieve the dustbin with frenetic energy. John turns back to reading the newspaper before Sherlock whirls through the sitting room, throws open the window, and dumps the dustbin contents outside. John tosses aside the newspaper and jumps to his feet.
With a shake of my head to clear out the reverie, I move to stand in front of him and hand over the tea. Sherlock places his bow and violin in one hand and takes the tea with the other, fingers brushing against mine. With a nod of gratitude, he raises his mug in cheers and takes a sip before folding himself into his chair as I fall into mine.
“Sherlock.” His name comes out almost in a whine, the grip around my heart squeezing out the word. I roll the glass against my forehead hoping that the sensation will ground me some. “I… There almost wasn’t a me to come back to.”
After so many small glimpses and mistaken identities, John isn’t expecting the dark curls to be anything more than a small stab of days long past. What he really doesn’t expect is for those dark curls to move directly to his tucked-away table in the small cafe. When the long legs covered in a navy blue suit stand in front of him, shifting from side to side, John looks up and meets the pale blue eyes he thought he would never see again.
The room has a staged attempt at comfort that makes it difficult to not roll my eyes. But with a second glance to Nancy, her dark eyes speak to an honest desire for hospitality, for trust.
happened. You kept her, and yourself, from me for months. I have no misgivings about your tenacity—it’s usually something incredibly admirable in your character—but if you so choose, you could easily do it again.” No emotion colors his voice. It’s as if he were explaining how the postal system works to someone who had never seen a stamp before. Flat and to the point.
Sherlock’s reply is a soft, sleepy hum, and he wraps his arms tightly around John’s torso until his breathing dies off into a snore. Eyes closing, John presses his lips to Sherlock’s collarbone and drifts.
With a stern glare in his direction, I see only openness and concern for me in his eyes. Not a trick then. Not planned. Staring out the window, I consider his question and decide it may be a benefit, if not for me, for John, for Rosie. I concede. “Only if you’ll come with me. Not for the session, of course, but just... be present.”
Sherlock’s brow furrows, and a small frown forms on his face as he thinks. Then, the moment of recollection comes. “Ah, right. The conference.” His steps falter as he turns to stare at John. “Wait, why are you here? When did you get back? Speaking of, what time is it?” He glances around for a clock.
“Oh." My heart sinks. "Sherlock, listen. You’re... You're my best friend, and I don’t want to leave here. Ever. As Rosie gets older, we may have to, but it won’t be like before. You are her godfather. She loves you. Adores you, in fact. You are in her life now no matter what. For the foreseeable future, you are stuck with us, here, at Baker Street. This is home. Has always been for me. I don’t want to leave it. Not again. We aren’t leaving, Sherlock. Ok?”
She sees Sherlock laying on the couch twitching, his head rocking back and forth. With her small hand, she reaches out to him and pats the back of his hand. “There, there, Papa. There, there.” Sherlock’s eyes pop open and focus on the room around him before looking down at his little Rosie. He scoots over on the couch. Patting the space he emptied, he encourages her to join him, and Rosie clambers up, excited for cuddles. This is always her favorite. Sherlock curls himself around her, breathing in the softness of her hair, wrapping her up in his long arms.
As I land on the most pressing need, I lift my head back up, raising the drink to my lips. As I tip the glass to take another mouthful, I challenge him. “Why didn’t you tell me? The real reason this time.” The bourbon burns the back of my throat. My head falls back again, my eyes sliding shut.
Sherlock’s brain whirled through what had happened, John’s face telling a story he didn’t understand.
“Hold that thought, yeah?” I say as I stand to rescue Rosie from the crib. He closes his eyes and lays his head back as it was before.
“That’s partly why I’m here, isn’t it? To wake you from them?” The question, spoken quiet and low, rings with a hint of confusion.
He hears a sharp inhale and looks up to find Sherlock staring at him with surprise. John licks his lips, and Sherlock’s eyes drop to track the motion. John feels his face grow warm.
When John comes home for his appointment, it’s clear something weighs on his mind. Babbling in her highchair, Rosie mushes her peas onto the tray, against her palm, and—thankfully—some into her mouth. After both of us glance at her, inexplicable smiles on our faces, we find one another's gazes again. John’s smile falters, and my brow knits together, trying to determine the cause. With a cough, John breaks eye contact and hangs his coat over the back of his chair. But my stare stays trained on him, unable to suss out the problem.
“Yes. But that won’t stop me from experiencing them.” The truth slips from me in my distraction. John turns to look at me then, searching my eyes in the dark, and settles on a response.
It lands on the floor, and Sherlock jumps, startled. His foot comes down on the glove, and it explodes, spilling wet sand and water over the floor. Sherlock’s brows fly up, then drop and furrow, and he gapes at John. “What the
John stares at the duster in his hand, lips pursed as he looks back up at his landlady. “What am I supposed to do with this?”
I tuck my hands into my coat pockets and lead the way through the main door. Once we are in a cab, John ventures to ask, “So, you seemed pretty open in there, which I assume means you’re pretty comfortable with her, yeah? I… I didn’t think you would be, which is why I’ve never asked this before. But, are you interested in seeing her for yourself? I mean, you’ve got a lot to process too.”
With the taste of Sherlock’s release on his tongue, John props himself on an elbow over his lover and strokes his cock to the melody of Sherlock’s comedown gasps, his aftershock shivers. John’s orgasm steals the breath from his lungs and paints cum over Sherlock’s still-heaving stomach.
too old for me to bend you over my knee and spank your arse.” Halfway to his feet, Sherlock loses his balance again and slides to the floor in a graceless heap. His breath whooshes out on a rumbling groan. John tries not to laugh, but a little snort escapes despite his efforts. “I’m going to get you some of those grippy socks.”
Sherlock sighs against my mouth, shoulders melting, and leans heavily against my chest. A laugh bubbles through my chest and breaks into a smile on my face, his lips slipping against my teeth. So close together, I can feel him pulling back, the rigidity of his back returning. To show I’m not laughing at him, I wrap a hand around his waist and draw him back into me, nipping at his lower lip and giving it a gentle tug.
My breath hitches around this next confession. "But I wanted, want, that whole life, my whole life with you, and when I couldn’t have all of it, I ran. Then, Mary was gone, and I was angry and vicious and wanted to hurt you just as much as I decided you had hurt me."
“Then why did you?” he asks. Sherlock’s shoulders stiffen. Instead of answering the question, he asks one of his own.
Grasping his fingers in mine, I shut my eyes before whispering a brief “thank you” and dropping his hand. Each touch is harder to release than the last. I collect our empty tumblers and place them by the sink. “Thai?”
Tangled, defeated, they lie on the floor, breathing loudly. A giggle bubbles up from John’s chest, and Sherlock’s deep chuckle rumbles through John where their bodies press together.
A small pang of excitement-laced hurt lanced through John’s chest. He finally had a chance to be with Sherlock, but it would all be pretend.
Having him here, seeking my forgiveness, showing remorse for the pain he caused, it grips my heart in a vice and settles something inside me I didn’t know was tumultuous. Knowing that John doesn't think I deserve the blame I have been heaping on myself allows a portion of it to release. And another portion goes with the knowledge that John understands his fault, his destruction, in the matter. A sigh escapes me as I settle further into the embrace, the feel of John's hair soft against my cheek.
Again, when the tea is finished, Sherlock resumes his playing. But this time, after the mugs are rinsed, I grab my duvet and shuffle back downstairs and into my chair. I tuck my Union Jack pillow under my head, and settle in, ready to sleep, rocked there by the music. With all my senses filled as they were, filled with the rightness of home, I know I will sleep without nightmares for at least tonight.
After handing him the tea, I sit on the coffee table, our knees almost touching, mine surrounding his, comforting in the closeness and shared warmth. With a steadying breath and a small sip, I start straight into the heart of the matter.
“Yes. Yes, Sherlock. I want you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want this." A deep breath rustles my hair. "It took me so long to admit that. And then, even after I had, I couldn't be sure you wanted it." Burying his nose into my curls, John confesses, "At some point, I gave up on needing more. Just being with you, here, at Baker Street was, always will be, enough." As his arms loosen their hold, I can feel the tension crawling back between us. "But... I come with Rosie, with baggage, with nightmares, and I am not always easy to get along with. I have severe anger problems, and I yell at chip and pin machines." John glances down at me with a smirk as he says, "Potential partners should know the worst about each other.”
“Do you have restricted movement? Desensitization? Pain?” His voice sounds strained as if attempting to conceal anger.
The minutes tick by, excruciatingly slow until John thinks he might go mad. He knows it’s illogical to think he can hear the sound of time sliding past. Convinced he can, John begins to fidget. As the enforced timeline drags into seconds, he looks up and meets Sherlock’s gaze.
The freedom of choice surprises me, even though it shouldn’t. It’s not my session after all. But the question is easy enough, and I decide to respond in part. “In some shape or other, losing John and Rosie. Be it my experience in a drug rehab, or the torture I experienced in Serbia, or one of the many times either John or I almost died, I dream of losing them.”
"I couldn’t give that up. It was safe compared to you. To losing you again. To losing myself again. So I played house. Played normal. And then she wasn’t, she wasn't normal. But she was the devil I knew… and Rosie. For how much I want to regret everything, I can’t because I got Rosie."
Feeling the air shift between them, John waits for Sherlock to think through his statements. When he has, Sherlock asks, “I’m...I’m your best friend?”
Sherlock meandered through the familiar space of his parents' house, hoping to find his way to the safe nook that protected him from most of the fray. A hand landed on his shoulder and paused his steps. John. Sliding his eyes closed, Sherlock let the small bit of warmth bleed through his suit and into his skin.
Sherlock turns his head and scowls, breaking the moment. “I didn’t want to avoid you, John,” he says quietly, and John shakes off his disappointment as the words sink in.
“No.” Sherlock stops me from walking away with a hand over mine. “When I saw you this morning, I asked her if she could watch Rosie for the night, or if she could have Molly pick her up to do so." He glances at the space between our feet, unsure if his actions would be welcome. "You have the night off. You need it. You haven’t slept well.” Relief washes through me. I love Rosie, but I know I need to take care of myself so I can be the best for her. After everything that has happened, she deserves the best there is to offer, which, right now, is not me.
Sherlock flicked his hand through the air, waving away the question. “Annoying parties. Absurd expectations.”
“ ‘ts fine. Are you okay? You were making funny noises.” Her eyebrows furrow in an exact replica of her father’s. Sherlock runs a gentle finger over it and down her nose, to smooth out the concern. With a tap to the tip of her nose and a smile he says, “Now that you are here, I am perfect.” She giggles, shaking her head, and burrows into his arms.
“John, before this goes any further, you need to know something. You were right. That first night when I told you I wasn’t looking for anyone, I meant it. I don’t do relationships.” He huffs but doesn’t interrupt or pull away. “I’ve never been interested in anyone until you. I don’t know what it will be like, what I will be comfortable with. I like this, right here, right now. But I don’t know if there will be anything else.” John blinks at me. Twice. A third time.
