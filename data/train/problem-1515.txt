My body spasms and arches, then relaxes, getting used to the new position and the possibilities, my voice raspy with need, "It feels so different. Deeper, bigger. I feel more filled than ever."
"I am, so stop pouting." There's a small smirk on my lips as I glance over, then back to my laptop, "But massage won't take all day and I'm growing bored."
I shrug. “I only wear the good one on special occasions.”
Sherlock
Sherlock
I press harder and harder in circles until my finger slips inside him. I still my finger and look up to him for reassurance.
“She might have something to say to you without me there. She wasn’t infatuated with the both of us you know.” I whisper back.
Pumping his orgasm as best I can, panting and sliding down to try and lap at him as he comes, trying to catch as much as possible between deep, throbbing moans of my own.
Sherlock
“Mmm. That length translates elsewhere.”
"Yes!" I bat away the gown, sitting there naked and waiting, "It's my blood. I want samples."
Sherlock
I bound down the stairs of Mycroft’s flat and climb into the passenger side of the car where Sherlock was waiting for me. “Home?” I ask.
Swallowing I bare down on his fingers, my body swallowing them almost eagerly if it means getting that special place touched again, sending my body into shivers of delight, "G...g...good."
Sherlock
Tugging John along I head straight for the bathroom, not bothering to shed my coat or shoes, just moving with a single mind to where the largest of our many first aid kits are kept.
“Hey guys!” Molly says brightly, looking up from where she was working over a body on the table.
“You enjoy looking at my arse?” I ask licking the last of the egg yolk off of my fork.
I can't help but hide my face into the curve of his neck and shoulder, hands clutching to his arms, "I've thought about myself in both positions."
My words are whisper soft and gently, "I love you also John. My conductor of light and brilliance."
"You're a doctor. You should know these things." I fall silent, curled under the blankets, before murmuring, "Does Lestrade blame me, like Mycroft does?"
"Because you were tired?" Snapping my laptop shut I jump out of bed, leaving the dressing gown behind as I pad over towards the food trolley, "Because we don't have plans for today. Apart from checking on the building work. Will it be done today?"
Sherlock
My sharp eyes rake over him, nodding, lust colouring my tone as I make no attempt to hide my own arousal as it sits upright and proud in my lap, "My experiment on all grounds has been successful."
I twist my mouth. “Yeah.... But I don’t see myself anywhere but here, now. You know that right?”
“We are on our way to Bart’s. You drank some bad tea at Mycroft’s.” I stroke his hair.
I take his phone and start looking through the messages. “What about Mycroft? Is that where you came from? From Mycroft’s house?”
Glancing up from my laptop I give a little hum, then my look sharpens as his words filter through to my actual attention, "Bill? He's a bad influence on you."
Arching back in the bed I attempt to ignore the slightly strange, uncomfortable sensation growing in my rear, trying to cling to the rush of afterglow.
Gasps I stretch myself, adding more lube before replacing my fingers nodding, "Or you could....from behind?" my cheeks flush, spreading down my chest. We've only really done it in missionary so far.
My transport's demands have changed a little. From floating with pleasure to now pulsing with a slight ache in my muscles and also my rear, "I feel I could sleep now."
The next scene is in Chapter 2 of the main RP here: https://archiveofourown.org/works/13132902/chapters/30041538
“Don’t you think you should put on trousers?” I say holding them up.
Skidding to a halt I turn, face pale and a bright pink lipstick smeared across my lips, eyes wide and bright with confused fright, "I want to go home."
I make a thoughtful face at that. “I haven’t had a real massage since I was doing PT for my shoulder.”
My hands curl on the seat, causing a rather vocal ripping sound that brings me a tiny amount of glee even during my frustration with my own mind.
A playful smirk runs across my lips, returning the kiss then lifting my feet, wriggling my toes again, my eyes falling on my shoes, then back to John with a hint of a head tilt of encouragement.
The corners of my mouth turn up as we kiss and I smile into his mouth. “I love you, Sherlock Holmes.” I lay my head on his shoulder, nuzzling into his neck.
I throw my head back into the pillows as he tries to catch the last few spurts of come as he squeezes them out through my after shocks. My breaths come out in long puffs and I groan out his name. “Sherlock... oh fuck.. ‘lock...”
“Me too... already.” My hips thrust up to meet his and I bring a hand up behind his neck to pull his mouth back to mine.
Finally I seem to give up, scooting around and laying my head on the pillow, sniffing in distaste, "I don't like the fabric conditioner they use. I hate lavender."
I sigh, “We shared some words and he hit me first.”
“I was supposed to be there. I wasn’t there to save you. And I didn’t even know what you were working on was dangerous. And I left you alone.”
Pulling back so far the water sploshes a little over the sides of the bath, I stare at John in horror and disgust, "Romantic? Name one romantic thing I've done for you...that isn't also practical."
“It’s new and we’re still working things out but I think we’re very happy.” I squeeze his hand again.
Shaking my head I attempt to turn and wriggle myself into the confines of my coat, allowing it to drape over my shoulders.
He hums as he laps at me and that makes my cock twitch. I can feel myself getting loose already from his tongue and his saliva. “Mmmm, Sherlock, that feels good.”
“Hopefully next week. Anthea put her best people on it.” I kiss the top of his head.
Nodding, I hesitate, "Tell her I hope we can still work together. I'm just not interested. At all. Ever." I burst out in a fit of temper, "I'm gay, even if I wasn't with you."
“Yes, Maybe tomorrow for a little bit. Though they don’t need much supervision.” I say unwrapping out of the blankets.
Sherlock
“Ummm... no. That’s different.” I smile a bit behind the newspaper.
“Oh. I... I’m... really? It was just Molly. Don’t you think you owed her that? How many times have you told her that she was pretty or that her hair looked nice to get her do something for you? Or let you bring home body parts?”
I let him pull my jumper over my head. “I don’t know...it’s just... now you’ll think I’m a selfish git...” I sigh, my shoulders sagging a bit.
Glaring at my phone I slip it away in my coat pocket as I get out of the taxi outside 221B. What was he going on about? Something wrong with the tea I made? Probably upset as I made it and it didn't meet the standards he now set for Lestrade. Stupid. I go to open the door of 221 and feel a slightly unsettled feeling wash over me, a slight pain in my stomach. I'm about to pull out my phone to text my brother back when I grin to myself, shaking my head. Why would I do that? I feel fine. Better than fine in fact! What I need is to see my John. Spinning on my heel I start to stride along Baker Street towards the quieter, residential streets where John has his residence at the clinic. As I go I feel a little like dancing for some reason, putting in a couple of waltz steps that turn into stumbles, clutching onto the wall for balance. This...isn't good. Not good at all. I speed up, wanting desperately to reach John now, my head starting to spin and race out of control. So much my thoughts start spilling out of my mouth, startling passer bys as I reel off deductions about them from nowhere. As I reach the clinic I'm grasping the wall to stop my collapse, my head on fire and thoughts moving too fast even for me to follow. All I know is I have to see my John.
I chuckle and lean up to kiss him again. “Sherlock, I want you... inside me. I want to try.” I start kissing down his neck. “I want... I want to give myself to you.”
Reaching, I awkwardly pat his shoulder, trying to affect a neutral tone, "There, there. I'm sure it happens to plenty of men."
“Mmm. Well put this in a drawer somewhere.”
Sherlock
There's an amused chuckle in his ear as I continue my investigation of his skin, tracing down to his biceps now with both hands, steam rising around us, "I have a whole wing devoted to you and romance."
Even naked I still manage to look rather imperial and majestic, sailing my way to the bed and flopping into it, face down, across it instead of properly so my legs hang off the edge.
I sigh and lay back down into the fluffy blankets, pulling them up to my chin. I would just close my eyes for a minute.
My head rolls to one side, nodding. "Whatever you want my love. I really don't feel well." Oh look, a handy bin just in reach of my wobbly arms as my stomach starts to reject the morning's breakfast of Mycroft's leftovers and the tea.
“We were mostly talking about the relationship stuff... I told him that Mycroft had brainwashed you into thinking that love and relationships were a bad thing.” I start playing with a loose thread on the throw pillow.
Tapping his head I try and push him off me, "Up. UP."
“So, I’m a good distraction.” I tug a bit on his curls as my fingers brush through them.
He grabs my hand and I squeeze back. I sigh and try to lighten the mood. “We never gave each other our gifts...”
Soon I feel sleep pulling me under, covered half in John and half in our duvet, calmed and soothed by our open talk and sex
“Oh.” I was already half hard and warm, being near him did that to me. “Are you sure your feeling up to it?”
Flicking my fingers I try and get it off, muttering, "No, you can't lick my honey stick. Only John can suck it."
A few minutes later, I slam through the lab doors carrying two coffees. I rush over to Sherlock and setting his coffee on the lab counter. “Greg’s ripped his stitches and has passed out on the floor. He’s at your brother’s alone. I’ve got to go.” I give Sherlock a quick peck on the cheek. “I’ll call you when I know more.” I rush back out the lab doors before either of them can say anything.
Sherlock
I can't meet his eyes now, bitterly snapping, "I've lost Mycroft. Soon I'll lose the only other person in the world I care about too."
"No..." my tone is more gentle now, but just as firm, "Don't do it for me. Do it for yourself or not at all."
Sherlock
Slowly my body uncoils, rather bloodshot and uncertain eyes peering up at John, "You're not angry?"
I scramble off the bed, “Of course it’s enough. You just don’t think it is!”
“Mmm.” I roll my head to look at him, giving him a satisfied smile. I reach out for his hand.
Off I go across the room, utterly naked and padding towards the bags that Anthea left us containing our clothes, "I always believed my rear was rather undesirable. I asked my tailor to make it appear smaller."
I let out a long groan as he stretches me with two fingers now. It burns and it feels tight. I reach down trying to grab his free hand where it rested on my thigh.
Sliding my arms fowards a little, I adjust my knees, pulling them together and pushing my rear upwards to give the best possible, tight and deep channel for John to thrust into, panting my words, "Harder. Make me forget everyone in the world but you John Hamish Watson."
Sherlock
I start shaking my head, then realize he can't see me from his position. "No. It never seemed...clean or needed before." my voice wavers with both nerves and lust, staying very still under John
I arc my neck a little to give him better access. “I won’t leave, I promise.”
Sherlock
Rolling my eyes I continue to argue my case, "I can tell by my pain that my threshold is far higher for drugs of all kind so I'm sure if you doubled the dose I'd be fine and much more gracious and content."
The zip makes a soft rippling sound as it's pulled down, my nose and lips entering the gap it's left, "Red pants John? How daring..."
Sherlock
My forehead rests on his shoulder now, arms and legs wrapping tight, clinging, "If I had my laptop here I could show you the video."
“Sounds lovely. Though, I’m content to stay just like this for the rest of the day.”
My whole being becomes centered on the stretch and burn, on John's clever fingers, making me moan in pure lust and delight.
“I promise.” I smile softly at him.
Sherlock
Still sleeping lightly from the nights in the hospital, I feel Sherlock shift in the bed. I start awake. “What’s wrong, Love?”
My head shakes between coughs, clutching my chest and then spitting, "I hate this!"
“I pointed out that Mycroft had dropped the “caring is not an advantage” bullshit real quick when he came along.” I was starting to get a little angry again, remembering what Greg and I had said.
“Hmph.” I pick up a piece of bacon and take a bite anyway.
“What kinds of things?” I ask, I lick all around the head of his cock before sucking him into my mouth.
My rear wobbles a little as I wriggle into position, my tongue sliding to lap at his balls now in the way I'm well aware makes him go insane, arms coming up and around to hold his thighs in place, spread wide, "Mmmm?"
I grab his things and followed him out into the hallway. “Um.... Sherlock. We’re not going back to Baker Street. Not today.”
“No, I’m good. Thanks, John.” Molly chokes out as she watches Sherlock move through the lab. Oh... she’s seen the marks... “I’ll be right back.” I say as leave through the doors.
My lower lip sneaks out, just a tiny bit, "Technically almost everything is flammable John."
Rubbing circles on his soles now, I chuckle, "Would you mean my penis by any chance? Crude soldier."
Lifting my head I meet his eyes, my head swimming and aching, "I'm not used to feeling this pathetic. Is this how ordinary people feel? I don't like it."
Hopping off the bed I wink, pulling my blanket tight around my frame once more, coat hanging loose off my shoulders as I didn't want to slide my arms out of my cocoon and into it's sleeves. My blue scarf tops off the well dressed effect.
My throat bobs as I swallow, then start to nuzzle his hand, eyes fluttering shut, "You were...stunning John Watson."
"Who's Greg?" I huff as John vanishes through the doors.
I remain stiff, sitting on the edge of my seat and gripping John's hand under the table as Molly serves us all red wine. Peering at the glass I mutter, "Red with sea food pasta? Really?"
I relax into his touch. “Why?” I say softly.
Sherlock
“Mmm. They probably will.” I snuggle closer to him.
My head flops back onto the pillow, enjoying his attention now while amazed he could still move, "I've come to the conclusion I would be willing to provide oral sex at any time and any place."
The cabbie laughs as she pulls up outside the hotel, ringing up the charge on the metre, "Go on guys. Better get your mate there into a room away from whoever threw him out. A handsome lad like you, shouldn't have any problem replacing her." I grit my teeth, shuffling out of the cab with none of my usual grace, almost tripping on the edge of the blanket and faceplanting into the pavement.
Finally I can breath freely once more, cocooned away in our warm and cosy little den, "You're my family. Hudders too. But mainly you."
“Yes.” I sigh, “When he actually sleeps.” The nurse take his arm anyway, and puts the blood pressure cuff on his bicep. She puts the O2 monitor on his finger and starts the machine.
That makes me chuckle a little, shaking my head and rolling onto my back, pulling him with me as I gaze at the darkened ceiling, "I never thought I'd enjoy sex this much. I always thought it looked messy, painful and rather boring."
Molly blushes a bit and her eyes dart to mine before laughing nervously. “Um... no. I... just thought you’d want to see this infection. Started out as just regular eczema... then sepsis. It’s what killed him.” She looked at Sherlock with bright eyes.
I blush and straighten the paper, fleeting images of the other ways I could make him not be able to sit run through my mind. I try to focus on the paper.
Quickly our fingers slide together, locking us into a tight hold as we journey to Mycroft’s.
“We can go down to Speedy’s.” I pull his shirt out of his pants and then start on his belt.
"One day.." My legs start to spread under the warm covers, "..I want to try certain things with you."
My breath catches and I twist my neck up as best I can to see him. “Really?”
"Mycroft's tea tastes disgusting." My head droops again, tiredness creeping over me. "He makes it too weak."
My hand is warm from the blankets, peeking out to take John's as the cabbie drives us towards the hotel. She tries to start up a conversation, "Epic walk of shame lads? Or misses kick you out in just a blanket?"
“Just be thankful that I love you.” I say as we turn down the landing towards the front door.
Spinning around I bark back, "I don't need your help or your pity."
Sherlock
I nuzzle into his chest a bit more, still not wanting to move.
I let out a deep sigh as he rubs his thumbs into my shoulders.
Looking down at my hands I frown. They're shaking. Why are they shaking? I don't even know if I'm speaking out loud or not as I shake my head. Now that's shaking too. I'm shaking all over.
Sherlock doesn’t answer so text Bill back anyway.
There's only a split second before I answer but that tiny hesitation problem speaks volumes to John, "I just need to be able to concentrate, that's all."
I pull back quickly, sitting upright and blinking fast.
“Yes, I have. I’ve never felt like I belong anywhere... well... until I moved here. Until I found you.” I pause, then, “How did he want to include you?”
“You’re not listening to the ones that matter.” I help him into the tub helping him lie back. “Is the water warm enough?”
Spinning around I start to slip past John and Molly into her house, giving her a wide beaming smile, "Your cooking smells delicious Molly. I'll just go and set up an extra place for John. Won't be a moment."
I smile a bit and press a kiss into the top of his head. The second time in a week that we were going to the hospital. For something life threatening. I kiss him again as the cab pulls up in front of Bart’s. “Sherlock, we’re here, Love. Come on.” I help him sit up and climb out of the cab and into the A&E.
I let him lead me to the bathroom and he pushes me to sit on the toilet lid.
“Mmm. It relaxes me too. I missed this when you were in the hospital. I can’t wait to be back in our own bed again.”
Hesitating I consider my transport for a moment. I'm almost painfully hard, pressing into the zip of my trousers. "I think I will wait. Then you can take your time to take me apart."
I resist the urge to blurt out ‘YES!’ and snog him senseless on the coffee table. Instead, I just nod, looking into his eyes.
Tightening into my ball even more, my voice sounds slightly rough, "I can't remember John. My mind palace is in disorder."
Dropping my head I feel that unfamiliar swooping sensation of having failed John once more, even as Molly wipes her eyes, nodding, "You...seem happy, yes. But I thought you weren't Gay John?” She tries to conceal her disappointment.
Munching my own I let the silence stretch a little between us, before murmuring, "I know of course you'll say no. But I also know you'll get irritated by his insistence since you won't want to be open with him about our relationship as you don't want to be teased all night by your friend." my little deduction goes on, "You're now concerned that you'll end up punching Bill as he has a mouth that's around ten times larger than his brain."
I take his hand back. “Fine we’ll both go. But you have to talk to her alone at some point before we leave this house tonight.” I whisper as we follow Molly into the kitchen.
Sherlock
Swallowing, I shuffle even closer, trying to lift my hips so under my genitals rub on John, "I mean I want you to...."
Pulling away slightly I spit, "I'm not a child John."
Blinking, I leave a small gap before repeating, a little dumbly, "Public indecency....Oh! Your public sex kink. Of course." my lips curve in a wide, content smile as I deduce it.
“Oh...” I pause, and then move on. “Can I suck you first?” I ask looking up at him.
I throw his arm out a bit letting go of his hand, trying to encourage him to get up.
Sherlock
Wriggling in the wheel chair I start to push myself down the corridor, leaving John behind to talk to the nice receptionist. I have to find Lestrade...for some reason I can't quite remember.
Turning I bend, trying to set John down onto the rug in front of the fire, "Wait here."
My shoulders straighten again, lifting my head in pride at his words, nodding, "In the future? It's not a race after all."
I vanish from the room before returning a few moments later carrying half the content of our bedroom, blankets, the spare duvet, pillows, tossing them onto John proudly.
My breath catches again as I choke out, "Why are you sorry? That's stupid. Stop being an idiot John."
“I never thought you’d return my feelings. Or enjoy sex with me as much as you do.” I reply a bit muffled.
“Praise you?” I push in a little farther. “You want to hear how hard you made me while I watched you finger yourself?”
“No.” I lie. “You were just gone when I woke up.”
Sherlock
Munching another bite I poke my head up slightly, giving an impish smirk, "He's bisexual. He may try and start setting you up with his male friends also once he knows you share his orientation."
My voice drops even lower, a very, very slight lisp to it, "One sample? You can take it when they're all done with me."
Sherlock
Purring my words I sink back down towards sleep, "You like my hair. I've always hated it. Too messy. It fluffs out. Like a poodle."
Nodding I pull out my phone, holding John still and starting to browse the net with my free hand, the glow lighting my face, "It makes no sense. How can you know me better than I know myself?"
I blush a bit at that and am about to say something in return when I hear a phone buzzing somewhere in the room. I sit up a bit trying to identify where it’s coming from.
“Can I still... do you still want me?” I ask a little breathless.
“I’m his partner and his Doctor.” She nods, I turn to Sherlock. “Come on. Let’s go get you checked out.”
“That’s against hospital policy. They won’t let you have samples of biohazard material. And you have to wear a gown. I won’t have you showing off all your bits to the nurses this time.” I shake the gown insistently.
Now that makes me snort, leaning my head back again and closing my eyes as I learn each tiny scar, curve and bump of John's arms, "You have no real idea how my mind palace works, do you?"
“Mmm. That sounds lovely.” I open my door to climb out and start grabbing gifts out of the back seat to carry inside.
“Mmm. The first time?” I rest my hand on the back of his head running my fingers through his curls.
I curl up on the bed, tugging the blanket over myself, nodding, "He was hurt...that's why my head hurts. I don't know why my stomach hurts."
I follow him through the door and up the stairs. He pauses on the landing to the flat and I take his hand and guide us the rest of the way up to my old room. The door was closed. I opened it and pulled us through the door. The air was fresher since the door had been closed, and didn’t smell as smoky as I thought it would. I closed the door behind us.
I lay my head on his chest and throw my leg over his. “I agree on the messy part... but definitely not painful or boring.”
My hand quickly moves to my base, pinching myself once more, voice urgent, "Get inside me John, please."
My hands come up, sliding into John's soft hair and pulling him to me, tongue seeking him eagerly.
“For both of us then. I want to watch you... when you’re inside of me.... please.”
I clean him gently, knowing how sore and tender he'll be, before dropping the flannel to one side and pulling out the stained pillow, tossing it over my shoulder and crawling back into bed, the blankets pulled up and over us as my arms reach for him, "There's a first for a lot of things today it seems."
He pulls off of me and I let out a breathy “Uh.”, my hips pulling back into the couch. I nod my answer, swallowing, still trying to catch my breath.
Bending down, I attempt to sweep John up and into my arms, rather impatient now I've had the idea, "Experiment."
“Um I guess I don’t know. I just like to be comfortable. Especially after wearing a uniform in the army for so long.”
“What?” I say through a giggle.
“Of your own blood, no.” I grab a hospital gown out of the cabinet in the room and go to sit on the bed to help Sherlock put it on.
Sherlock
The front door slams downstairs and startled me awake. I groan and peer at the up at the ceiling where the light from the setting sun painted it orange.
Dropping one foot, I pick up the first, trying to find the same spot on that to test the effects.
I chuckle. “It’ll be fine. Plus Anthea said that the hotel is pretty posh. I bet the sheets will be just as ridiculous as yours.” We step out onto the pavement, where one of Mycroft’s cars was waiting.
“We could. If that’s what you want. I don’t mind you being in the kitchen. I like having you close when you are working. It relaxes me.” I raise his hand up to kiss his knuckles.
Sherlock
I nod in agreement, sliding my hand out and reaching for the lube, squirting it over my cock as I shuffle onto my knees, refusing to let go of his hand still, "I'm narrow but long. I shouldn't stretch you must more than my fingers have."
The trolley comes level with John's side of the bed before I attempt to climb back in, not bothering to go to my side but instead clambering over John
I'm not expecting to be push away so suddenly, falling back and glaring at John in confusion Molly goes pale, looking as if she may faint.
I round the corner at a full run to see multiple emergency vehicles in front of Baker Street. I push past any personnel that try to stop me. "Sherlock?!" I see Mycroft standing in front of an orange shock blanket covered Sherlock. I run to him, pushing past Mycroft and kneel in front of him. "Sherlock, what happened? Are you alright?”
"I don't see what about John." I whisper back rather forcefully, clinging to his hand and arm as Molly starts to serve.
Sliding out of bed, I spit my words in distaste, "I'm not good with these...feelings." The word is said like a type of flesh-eating virus.
“Every 4 to 6 hours.” I set the bottle and glass on the bed side table and climb up next to him again.
“No, I know. But I love hearing it when you do say it. So even if you did say it 100 times a day, I’d never get tired of hearing it.” I give him another soft kiss.
“That’s nice... good. What else?”
My breaths start coming out in a low whine. “You’re never going to make me come if you’re just holding it there.” I squirm underneath him.
Smirking I nod, whispering softly into his hair, "The finest honey in the world. I believe there's some which goes for several thousand pounds a jar."
I'm yelling now, flailing my arms a little, "It's not too late if we start the process now in secret. Mycroft will have mummy organising his wedding and will want to invite the Queen, all her corgis and probably every world leader. That takes time."
He drops to one knee and I turn quickly to face him. “What are you doing?” I whisper, breathless.
Nodding I pull back, smiling warmly now, "And I also."
I wave the lube as a very clear hint of what I desire, my voice rough, "You're a doctor. I presume you've done more than enough prostrate examinations."
I start to squirm and gasp in his grip, rubbing myself on his cock, feeling a little bruised and tender inside already. The thought grabs me, along with his yelled words, tipping me into climax as it stripes the covers under us without me even having to stroke myself, convulsing on him as he fills me.
“I know, Love. It’s alright. Just try to relax.” I reach down to squeeze his hand.
“I know. But the hazmat team wasn’t sure what chemicals you were working with. They weren’t sure it was safe.” I put my hand on his thigh.
Sherlock
Sherlock
I stop the taps, waving my feet to make sure the warm water circulates around us, before running my toes up and down his legs, "I could give you the kiss of life?"
Sherlock
“You make it sound so.... indecent. It’s not like I want to get a blowjob in the middle of a crowded shopping center. It’s just you know... in the back of cabs...in an empty room at a crime scene… That kind of thing.” I blush a little.
I nod slightly and the corners of my mouth turn up teasing a bit. “Good. I can’t say I don’t agree.”
“It’ll be fine. It’s only for a few days. Let’s go in and have a nap.” I pull him inside the doors.
Sherlock
I let out a sigh and step into the door way of the bathroom, tucking my shirt into my trousers. “Sherlock, we’re going to have to tell Molly about us.”
“Yeah and not all women are friends with Sherlock Holmes.” I finished tying my shoes as well and slip my coat on.
I can tell he’s not enjoying this. I try curling my finger up, searching for the bundle of nerves that my doctor brain knows is there. I pull out slowly and push in curling my finger up and I brush by it just slightly.
Sherlock
I continue, my eyes still closed. “Then I’d kiss you hard while I undo your belt and trousers.”
Chuckling, I try and undo my jacket as we go, dropping it in a heap in the kitchen and reaching for John's jumper to tug it up, "My husband to be."
There's a slight wince on my face, my words coming with difficulty, "It feels strange. Don't stop."
Sparing him a quick glare I roll my eyes, "I gave you oral sex around an hour ago. You can't possibly be ready for it again for at least another four hours." I pause before adding cheekily, "Old man."
I lean my head back on his chest a bit more, closing my eyes. I run my fingers down his leg. “If I fall asleep don’t let me drown.”
“I’m sure he does but then it would make it even more ours if we did it ourselves. It’ll be fun. I’m sure we could get Greg to help us....” I trail off with a small scowl. That had been the original idea anyway maybe he would be able to help us if he wasn’t too busy being married to Mycroft.
My eyes widen a little, gripping the blankets. I feel a rather familiar sensation inside me, one that's only appeared since meeting John, "Who was he?" I bark.
Holding his hand, I know my next confession will expose me for the sentimental fool I've become, yet I find it hard to resist anything John asks me. "Our memories...are scattered. Depending on what kind they are." my thumb works up and down his thumb nail, mapping the very slight ridge on it and it's bluntly trimmed shape, "Most are located at Baker street. I can walk around 221B in my mind, touch you chair and recall all the times you've sat there. You exact words. Books you've read and glasses of whisky you've imbibed while laughing with me."
I gasp at the sight of him between my legs. I take a moment to catch my breath before continuing. “Well I still want to watch that video you told me about. And um, this was on it.”
The blanket is pulled up and over my head, voice muffled, "Remember my sample love?"
My chuckle is muffled by his lips, moving them gently, allowing my tongue to flick out before I pull back firmly, "I have rules."
I'm about to answer him when Molly walks back in, now wearing more sensible shoes instead of her heels, her make up half wiped off.
I hum when he tugs on my hair. “Yeah. I woke myself up. Then you weren’t here.”
“Of course. I’ll talk to Molly.” I said through a smile. He’d never called me ‘Love’ before. I wasn’t entirely sure he’d remember this conversation anyway. But it was nice. I stroke his back through the blankets until I’m sure he had dropped off to sleep. I slip out of the room in search of Mycroft.
“Oh Christ.... Sherlock...” I throw my head back into the pillows.
Lowering my present carefully to the side I nod, "I have a small trust fund that I hardly ever touch. Mummy holds the reins and she was quite happy to allow me the funds to buy the cottage once I explained why I wanted it." my smile is a little nervous, "I put it in both our names."
I moan into his mouth then pull back. “I don’t know... we’ll have to try it several times to establish a trend, hmm?” I buck my hips up into him. “God, you are so fucking hard already.”
A nurse stops me before I can get all the way in. “Are you a relative?”
Sherlock
“No... I don’t. I just... I don’t know...” I huff in his chest. “I’m just being stupid....”
"If my legs will support me." I try to get up, then flop back down, shaking my head, "Lets sleep here? We have most of the pillows and blankets here anyway."
Some where below me, I hear him open the lube bottle. He keeps his tongue inside me, though and I squirm even more.
Pausing I can't nod, head occupied but my long fingers do indeed press harder, palm cupping and lifting his balls and my lip and tongue slurp on his shaft and head, enjoying the taste even as I seek my prize.
My coat slips off, hitting the ground in a heavy pile of damp wool, my arms under it reaching for John's waist to pull him closer.
Taking his fingers between mine one by one I begin to fill out in even more detail the John inside my palace, "You link places you remember in the real world, locations, with things you wish to remember. My mind palace isn't just a collection of meaningless file stores, filing cabinets."
“Because we care about you! That’s why we were worried!” I say exasperated. “And Mycroft was worried about Lestrade.”
I stand there utterly confused and a little distressed, staring at the side of Molly's head before rushing out of the kitchen and towards the front door.
“John, left to get coffee, Sherlock.” Molly says shaking her head. Molly goes over to the other table with a body under a sheet. She pulls it back and shows Sherlock the infected area on the man’s arm.
My whole body comes to life, a tingle between my legs that makes my cock leap and my legs jerk, a startled cry falling from my lips.
“Umm.. Alright. Can we get room service at four in the morning?” I finish drying off and follow after him into the room.
“I think they will be.” I snuggle into him more with a deep sigh.
Sherlock
Smirking a little I get up, swanning back to my experiment in the kitchen, "Does slapping my rear while in the shower count?"
"So now experience, what I am lead to believe, is a relaxing and pain free massage where you just have to lay there and enjoy?" My fingers are on the buttons, ready to dial the front desk, my eyes encouraging.
“You’re in a hurry.” I comment, burying my face in his neck, sucking and biting my way to his collarbone.
Sherlock
Bending my head I plant a fond kiss onto John's hair, "I thought it would actually feel worse than when I masturbated. After all, why should another person know my body and likes better than I do?"
My breath catches, before I mutter, "No. I want. You." to emphasis my point I lift a long leg, slinging it over John's hips and pushing our groins together, trying to ignore the fact that the cold air made me shrink to an embarrassing size.
“Oh, my mistake.” I say a little bit sarcastically. I smile to myself.
My body wriggles even more under the covers, "It makes you so happy when I do things wrong."
“A beautiful mess. It’s supposed to be messy.” I wrap my arms around him and pull him close to me. “I didn’t hurt you, did I?”
“Again with the speaking without thinking.” I give Sherlock a stern glare.
“See, no electricity, remember.” I go over and close the window, and then grab an extra blanket out of the wardrobe, tossing it on the bed. I start to strip off my coat.
“Oh Jesus... Sherlock... you’re fucking amazing...” I thrust deeper as he holds himself up. I start to feel closer than I had before. “Do you want me to cum inside of you?” I gasp.
“Mmm. I get to order you around enough.” I pull him harder against me and bury my face in his neck, kissing lightly.
"You have a much higher sex drive than I it seems." My hand slides down to rest on his hip, attempting to conceal the stab of concern I suddenly feel, "Is that an issue?"
Waving the old fashioned phone at him I beam, "I've never had a massage and I don't wish a stranger's hands all over me. But I'll order one for you now."
Lifting my head, my eyes tightly shut, trying to lose myself in the sensations and fantasy of the situation, barking, "Take me hard?"
Gazing into his eyes I finally start to understand, tilting my head slightly, "Have you ever felt like this John?"
Sherlock
I sigh deeply into his shoulder, trying to catch my breath. I leave a few kisses there before pulling up to look at him. Putting my hand on his cheek, I kiss him softly.
“I don’t care. It’s still weird.”
With a deep, throaty chuckle my hands slide down to cup his muscular rear before standing, lifting him with a small grunt of effort, "Bedroom?"
My nose wrinkles slightly, "Does it bother you that they're marrying and we're not?"
“You already did that one.” I mumble. I was ready for him to move up from my feet.
“Oh... Sherlock.” I rub his back as he throws up onto the trash can. I grab him a tissue off my desk to wipe his mouth before helping him up again. I tell the receptionist that we are going to A&E on the way out the door and we get into a cab quickly.
“Yeah I can get some...” I trail off when I see his neck. I guess I had gotten a little carried away this morning. I clear my throat and hope Molly wouldn’t notice. “Molly, coffee?”
“Because you have a concussion. Sleeping more is normal, especially for you.” I continue to play with his hair, knowing it made him sleepy.
Sherlock
“Oh, please... I want to watch you get yourself off.” I groan out.
The eyebrow raise becomes an eyeroll, poking a bony finger into John's good shoulder, "You're hiding things. You know you can't hide things from me."
I let him pull me back down and I look up at him. “What do you mean?”
Dipping my head slightly, my lips nuzzle on a sensative bit of skin behind his ear, whispering, "When you were inside me."
A nurse reaches around me and puts an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose. I adjust it so it’s more comfortable. “Deep breaths, Sherlock.”
Frowning I test his muscles again, then lean in, cupping his shoulder and pulling his arm up very slowly and gently, "Tell me if it hurts?"
I huff out when he pulls back. I give a fleeting thought to whether Sherlock would want me to do that to him. My cock gives a throb at the thought of how much he might enjoy it. “Would you want me to do that to you... sometime?”
“Then I’d still know it.” I kiss him deeper this time. “But I do love you. Does it make you uncomfortable when I say it?”
“Are you going to come for me? Already?” I change our position, putting him back down on the pillow and laying over him, trapping his cock between our stomachs. I thrust quick and deep into him. “Come for me, just like this.”
I let out an exasperated sigh, covering my face with my hands. “Greg was trying to say that Mycroft was the be all- end all to the man you are now... that I had no part in it.” I look up at him. “It pissed me off. But I shouldn’t try to take credit for it either. You are your own person.”
Sherlock
I adjust my position even more, sliding down so I’m even more reclined, making my lap even flatter.
“Right. Nice try. 4 hours and no sooner.” Laying on my back, I pull him to my chest, wrapping my arms around his back.
Sliding my shoes on I give John a slightly patronizing little look, "Not all women are driven by their hormones John. Really. I thought you would have known that."
Picking up the phone again I think for a moment, then nod, "I have the perfect solution." before dialing the front desk and ordering a whole feast of snacks and a selection of professional massage oils, clean towels and scented candles.
"NoPe. Comfortable here." My voice is muffled by the mattress.
I sigh into his mouth and my eyes start to feel a little wet again. “Say it now...” I whisper. “Please...”
“I did promise to take you to see the flat today.”
Sherlock
Nodding I seem rather subdued, putting the car in gear and driving off and out of the posh regions, back towards Baker Street. A remain quiet and my gaze seems far away
"Mmmmm..." I reply, deep in my mind now, filing away every little twitch and movement, ever scent and sound, finally daring to risk pushing my tongue back into him and swirling it around his smooth muscular walls.
Sherlock
I hum and snuggle back into him, feeling so content and loved.
Mycroft leaves, shutting the door behind him. I run my hand through the curls on his forehead, avoiding the back of his head where I knew it was tender. “Sherlock, please don’t shut me out. Talk to me.”
Grinning down at him now I wink, "I may have missed that section in the law which allows the shooting of horrible cabbies then."
Settling down on the pillows, I gaze at him in the little light provided by a gap in the curtains, "Is this something you'll feel a need to torture yourself over for a while longer?"
“You make me lazy. I’d rather just lay here all day with you.” I say looking back at him.
Nodding I relax once more, my breathing slowing until it settles into a still raspy little snore, my hands clutching in John's jumper relaxing.
"I'm not leaving you John." My hands twist the shirt back and forth, mirroring John's clutching of the sheet as we face each other, "But one day you'll leave me. All hearts are broken."
I pull his hips up higher into my lap changing my angle. I hold him around the hips and thrust up this time instead of forward.
"Of course I love you," I snap back, hands curling into fists as my sides as I start to fly around the room, grabbing clothes and beginning to dress, "But it isn't enough, is it? There's an imbalance which I'll struggle to fill."
My arms slide around him, lifting him to cover my body, lips responding to his rather deperate, wet kisses, "I've never had anyone else in my life John. Why would I ever seek another person now I have found my conductor of light?"
Sherlock
Sherlock
My lips press together, almost vanishing as I attempt to hold in the noise brewing in my chest, legs twitching slightly either side of John.
“Well not an official list, I guess... in Sussex we were talking about romantic things...” I close my eyes relaxing into his touch.
A pillow sails down the bed, heading for John's face.
I pinken again and the nurse smirks at me as she removes the blood pressure cuff. “Sherlock...” I say, embarrassed.
I shake my head, moving towards the door. “Let’s get going. I owe you a bath.”
I chuckle and hook him under his arms, pulling him on top of me. “I’m sorry... I don’t need themed dirty talk... I just need you.” I give him a light kiss.
“I know, Love. I’m sorry.” I brush my hand around his face. “Do you want to try the inhaler? The doctor said you could use it if you were having shortness of breath.”
“Hush you. I’m not giving you anymore.” I swat his bottom under the blankets. “Just rest.”
My tongue rolls around his ear again before catching the lobe between my teeth gently, my voice muffled slightly by it, "What would you do to me?"
“Well, I suppose not...” I close my eyes, my headache was starting to subside a little.
“Of course. I want you to tell me if I’m hurting you.” I give him a soft kiss.
Tearing my gaze away from John's flushing neck and chest I glance at the fire, then back, "It never occurred to me. Here? In front of the fire?"
"I meant as the penetrator and the penetratee John." Lips drift across his still chilled skin before I try and shufle down even more into the bed, "Top or bottom I believe are the terms."
Sherlock
My legs drop to either side of his thighs, knees hitting the bed so I can get an angle to thrust properly into my hand, bending to catch his lips once more to tug and play.
Sherlock
Blinking I come out of my little experiment trance, turning my head and peering down at him, "When did you get in? I thought you were at the clinic today?"
Sherlock
“Ok. Um... I’ve been thinking about it too. I did some research of my own...” I brush my fingers along his collarbone.
I sit up rubbing my face. “Shite. What time is it, Sherlock? Have you been gone all this time?”
“No. Because I was already dreaming and it wasn’t about you sneaking out to see Greg.” I roll over to face him in the dark.
Sherlock
Sherlock
My face is utterly torn and wrecked, curls messily trailing from his fingers over pale skin made paler by the cold and lack of light in the room. My eyes are luminous but filled with fear, reflected as I whisper, "I don't want to lose you."
“No, I’m trying to put you to bed, so I can go and visit him. And you’re going to stay here and rest.” I yank his shirt out of his trousers and start on his belt, not breaking his gaze.
I take a deep breath. “I did enjoy it. physically....it was different. Mentally and emotionally... I did too... I think. It was just so much.... I felt like you were really taking care of me... that I was the only person in the world. That you really loved me.” Once I found the words, they just poured out.
I narrow my eyes at him. “You know I hate it when you do that to me. And I was actually thinking about telling him, being honest. If he does tease me it’ll be good-naturedly. More like I told you so.”
“Can you not see that she’s got herself all bloody made up to seduce you?” I say gritting my teeth, “Christ! It’s a wonder I got you in bed with as blind as you are sometimes.” I pull him down on the sofa next to me.
"Really?" A small pause, "In what way?"
I grunt as he climbs over me.
Leaning down I place a kiss on his forehead, "It's not stupid to me. Lestrade sounds like he's taking Mycroft's side without considering all the facts. It makes me even more concerned that Lestrade isn't in full knowledge of what sort of person Mycroft is."
The corner of my mouth turns up. “Maybe I will punch him in the nose then.”
I grab my brand new bee hive, carrying it in besides John through the back door, keeping quiet so we don't wake Mrs. Hudson as she must be asleep by now, "Once we get comfortable we can exchange presents. I can't wait till you see mine." My eyes take on a luminous glow as we make our way upstairs.
Shivering at his words so close, my hands slip, ruining the slide I'm working on before glancing back at him, quirking a brow, "Send me a text ten minutes before you leave the pub. I shall be naked on our bed when you return."
I chuckle, feeling a little stupid. “I hope not. But I could say the same thing to you.”
“You know one of these days, I’m going to go days and days without saying it so you’ll say it first.” I say giving him one last kiss before sitting down in my chair.
“I think so. He’s got more lacerations on his back than you did, since he shielded you from the explosion. He had glass in his back. But they’ll have to do the same lung function testing, but we’ll know more when he’s breathing on his own.”
Nodding I grab I stride towards the door, sweeping my Belstaff off the hook and then sniffing it, pulling a face, "Needs a clean. Back to Baker street John."
"NoPe." I shake my head, leaning back, "They were only pretty minor, getting picked up for public disturbances, that sort of thing. He thought they should stay as a reminder for me."
I look at my watch. “About two hours.”
I freeze and pull back to look at him. “Wh...What?”
I hum and lean up to kiss him. “I love you.”
Sherlock
That sounds....interesting, I'll admit, flopping down onto the bed and attempting to pull off my trousers too, "Can I have samples?"
“It’s alright. You don’t have to remember.” I press a kiss to his forehead.
“Wasn’t talking about your fingers.” I slur.
Sherlock
Sherlock
My head nestles into the pillow under us, curling a little into John, "Merry Christmas?
Sherlock
My head rises quickly to stare at him, "You felt like this? Really? Like you were standing on the outside of the family, not really part of it?" I pause, then add softly, "Mycroft wanted to include me but...I'm different. I always have been John."
Blinking I sit up a little straighter, feeling totally out of my depth and wondering if this is the point she starts throwing things...if we'd get dinner delivered by air instead of our plates. "Happier. Than I've ever been."
Glancing up I shift, smearing his head around my lips to leave a glistening trace of his passion behind before lifting my head, eyes glazed with the drifting, peaceful feeling I get now whenever we do this, before my tongue slides out to lap all around my mouth.
My eyes flick from the trousers to John's face, then back, "Coat. No trousers. Scarf also."
My lips are full and soft as they meet his, eyes fluttering closed, my grip still firm but not painful on his chin to hold him there.
I push deeper actually push on the soft bump this time, pulling my fingers back quickly.
After my hospital visit I jog along the hotel corridor, checking the time in my internal clock and smirking as I know I have at least ten minutes spare. Pushing open the door to our suite I waste no time stripping naked once, rearranging my clothes how they were left and going to slide into bed next to John.
“That’s why I didn’t want to talk about this.. I didn’t want to upset you. The whole thing was utter shite.” I sit up a bit too forcefully and my head starts pounding again.
Gripping onto them the rather passive aggressive fight is on, attempting to keep them in place without moving myself from my flat out position.
John is becoming more open, wanton and greedy, sucking my tongue inside to caress his inner walls. My fingers stroke down his thighs, releasing them and leaving little red welts before as I press just a little with my fingernails into his tender skin
Without glancing at my laptop or the clock I shrug, "10am. You've slept in longer than you normally do."
Using my height advantage I sweep into his mouth, my hand dropping to his shoulder, the other wrapping around his chest to bring him close.
"Fuck me." I whisper into his ear as I give another full body shiver.
My eyes drift closed and after a moment, I ask, “Do you want me to get up and get you a flannel?”
“I would say, I don’t need a reminder but...” I thrust my hips up a bit.
“No, don’t do that. It’s normal. And you were beautiful.” I brush the curls sticking to his forehead back.
Flopping back I nod, then regret it as my head throbs with pain and dizziness, "He was angry."
I bring my thumb to my mouth to wet it a bit and then put my hand back, my thumb lower and pressing a bit harder this time. “How’s that?”
I hold my hips in place while he tugs down on my pants. He still struggling a bit, so I reach up to start undoing my belt and button of my pants.
I spread my legs slightly, slipping down so John is pounding into me from higher, gasping loudly as he starts to punish my prostate at last, shivering and letting my hand drop away to grasp into the covers, "That's it. There. There."
Rolling my eyes I start setting out the chemicals I need for tonight's experiments, "I'll remember you everytime I need to sit down John." there's a slight reddish hint to my cheekbones as my words call to mind the elephant in the room between us.
“But I would’t be able to help you if something happened. If you started having trouble breathing.” I put a hand on his shoulder, squeezing.
I roll onto my side, angling so I can watch John with content eyes, murmuring, "That was everything I wanted and more."
I lift a brow in disbelief, "You were only gone a few hours John. Did you expect me to be missing when you returned?" Tearing into the bag I release the steamy, vinegar and salt soaked goodness, eyes lighting.
“Because you’re never content to just lay here with me.” I say not moving my face still smushed into his chest.
“I think I say fuck a lot, too...” I say climbing out of bed. I find my phone in my coat pocket. I look at the caller ID. “It’s Molly.” I say to Sherlock before answering. “Hey Molly.”
My head lifts slowly, eyes clear and dry but showing a hint of vulnerability I work hard to hide usually. My voice is level once more, softer though, "You'll grow frustrated. You'll grow angry. At yourself. At me."
Each thrust makes my body sing and praise the man under me. I start to grunt, slender shoulders quivering and tensing, "I...I fear it..may be over too quickly..."
She gives him a sad little look that conveys “You never do.”. I pick up on it but I’m not sure that Sherlock does. “Why don’t you go help Molly in the kitchen.” I suggest to Sherlock.
I hold him close in the back of the cab, his head resting on my shoulder. “How are you feeling now?”
“Sherlock, please, this is the second time this week we are here. I hate seeing you like this. Please just cooperate, for me?” I say softly.
My face falls a bit when I see Molly had changed. “Molly, have a seat. Sherlock and I... we um... have some news.”
I moan out as kiss down his chest farther. I let my hand wander down the front of his trousers and press gently on his hardness with the palm of my hand. “Please don’t make me wait...” I gasp.
Sherlock
I dart into the kitchen to grab my coat I left there earlier, starting to shrug it on, beaming from ear to ear in the way Mycroft always teased me about, chins multiplying around my neck, "I may be some time. Order take away and put mine in the fridge for when I return"
Pulling my lips off I speak for the first time since I began, "Is it as good as is claimed?"
“I’m sorry.” It’s then I realize how painfully hard I was inside my pants. I grind a bit into the bed as I continue to work him open. He gasps just a little every time I pass gently over his prostate.
“No, it’s not.” I add a sausage back to his plate. “I know you don’t like beans and they’re below your social class but at least eat the sausage and eggs.”
I pause and look up at him. “I think we’ve both read up on... what we’re supposed to do... I don’t want anything extra or crazy... just us. Is that ok?”
“Yeah, But you weren’t sleeping with your brother.” I make a face when I realized what I had said.
"Because.." my shoulders slump a little, "They'll attempt to take control. As they always have. You know what Mycroft is like and where do you think he got it from? Mummy is the same. They'll barge in and take this from us." I pause, my voice dropping, "Take this from me."
“Now who’s saying things that are hard to believe? You never thought about anything when you were getting yourself off?”
Rolling my eyes I whisper back to him, "Lesbian. Long term relationship." before nodding back to the maid with a pleasant smile, "Coffee and tea."
I lean down and pick the scarf up off the floor, handing it to him. I pull on coat and start on my socks and shoes.
Sweeping off my scarf I reveal my neck, not realising I have a line of red marks along the long stretch of it's pale surface, reaching from ear down into the collar of my coat, "John. Coffee?"
“Slow down, Love. Don’t hurt yourself.” I sit up to be close to him, wrapping my arms around him, kissing his chest and moving over to mouth at a nipple.
I don't even recognize the noise my own mouth makes, tossing my head back among the pillows and grunting, managing to grit my teeth and form the words, "A little...lower."
My hand drifts down a little, massaging the sensitive spot just behind his balls, lips tight as I start to plunge my mouth up and down him harder, faster, paying special attention to his head in a way I know drives him insane, tongue dancing and pressing.
Shaking my head I continue my battle with both the pen and my emotions, snapping, "Greg is in danger! Need too.....too..." the pen and paper fall to the floor, burying my spinning head into my hands.
My hands slide up and down his torso as I whisper into the kiss, "I brought the lube out with me."
Picking up my fork I start pushing my egg around the plate, "That Sussex place was a rather sleepy little backwards hotel. This is top of the range, modern."
I groan into his ear as he pulls back and thrusts into me. My cock pulses back to life again when he traps it against our stomachs as he starts thrusting. Our hands are still interlaced on one side of us and I bring my other up and around to rest on his back.
Nodding I try and lay down again, mumbling, "Did he get out of the explosion all right?"
I let’s his trousers fall. “I know that. I’ll be back before the two hours is up. Now get in bed.”
I breathe out a moan and let my head fall back on the sofa, while still holding his gaze. “Nggh. Jesus... your mouth...”
“Gorgeous… Bloody fucking gorgeous…” I choke out as I watch him with wet eyes. I can feel him pulsing inside me, a sensation that I never imagined feeling this good. He arcs into me putting more pressure on my painfully hard cock between us. My hips buck up in response and my release hits me with almost no warning. “Sherlock.... oh....Sher... fuck...” I bury my face farther into his neck as my release makes a warm sticky pool between us on my stomach.
Sherlock
Sherlock
“Lestrade’s already been taken to the hospital. Mrs. H is fine. Just shaken up.” We reach the ambulance and I help him step up the stairs and climb in after him. I let the paramedics take over to take the vitals they needed, sitting across from him.
The warming smell starts to rise as the oil heats and mixes with both our natural scents, starting to learn to feel my way around John's body now, working his bad shoulder very carefully.
"Oh. OH!" My face reflects my slight sheepishness at missing his meaning, rocking up onto my heels and finally letting go of his hand, "For me? No. It hasn't yet and I don't see that it will. Although I do find there are two types of sexual activity occurring for me now."
“Mmm. Hurry? We don’t need to hurry....” I’m almost panting already. I start to push him back towards the kitchen and down the hall.
“Bloody hell.” I rub my face. “Why did you let me sleep so long?”
I shift a little, reajusting the pillow and spreading my legs more, peering down my own body to watch John in the dim light of the room, "This is it, isn't it? What if..you don't like it?"
“I don’t want to make promises I can’t keep. But I can say... it’s just because I’ve been without... someone to share this with. And it’s also because this is so new. I just want you all the time. I can’t help it. That’s why I said sorry.”
My shirt slithers to a silky purple pool at my feet, hands moving to John's muscular hips to squeeze, leaning in to whisper hotly in his ear, "Do you want to come inside me?"
I grab him by the collar of his shirt and pull him back down towards me. “Kiss me, you posh git.”
“Do you like it?” I say through a groan. I thrust in again and it feels so much deeper than before. “Oh fuck... so deep...” I can’t help but to pick up my pace.
Sherlock
Blinking I lift my head, considering it for a moment then smirking, nodding, "I suppose you can also point out the unrealistic bits." before sinking my whole mouth down onto John, lips pulled wide as my cheeks puff out a little in effort before suctioning back in, holding his gaze all the while.
Hands slide down his body as he strips me, reaching to undo his trousers, whispering directly into his ear in hot puffs of air, "You looked so handsome today. Even in that jumper."
My voice is a little muffled, grunting, "No. I can do this. Hands off." before going back to struggling with it.
Sherlock
“Hmph. I have a list too you know.”
The next chapter follows this one.
I start to pull on my clothes. “Maybe you should go on your own. So you can talk to her alone.” I suggest. Maybe that wasn’t a good idea either. I would probably need to be there to stop him from saying something not good.
There's no reply as I slip into sleep, cuddling up to John's warm body though and slipping freezing cold feet between his legs to warm them.
Wriggling up, I lean on my elbows, looking down at him and swallowing, "We don't have to do this now John."
My fingers travel a little and flick John's nose, "You, my brother and Lestrade can get together and have my criminal drug record framed for my birthday since it's something you all agree on then."
I pull away from him chuckling, making my way back to the fridge. “All day? It’s only been three hours I made us tea and toast and I’ve been in the sitting room working on my laptop. I’ve been talking to you, you know.”
“Maybe you should start. We did. And it’s not been so bad.” I give him a light peck on the lips.
I don't like the fact he's avoiding my eyes now, reaching to grasp his chin lightly to try and turn him back to me, "Like -this-. You want me. You love me. You need me."
“No... it looks amazing.” I brush my hand over his ass cheeks again. Then I lean down over his back, running a hand down his side. “And your back...mmm.” I start kissing down his back. My cock presses between his ass cheeks.
Pulling back a little my oily hand sneaks between us, trying to wrap long fingers around us both, "Together?"
I narrow my eyes. “Fine. But I’m not eating all of this you’re gonna make me fat.”
My own face starts to colour slightly, trying to maintain my rather carefree air, "It's just we've both got rather agitated over my brother marrying. I feel there may be something we're both maybe wishing but I don't know what it is."
Sherlock
I open just one eye, peering up and fixing him in an intent gaze, "Why? Before you came along I would have to resort to drugs to distract me from my thoughts when the experiments grew too boring or too dangerous."
Sherlock
Sherlock
“Oh, Sherlock. Lay back. You need to lie down. You’re in shock.” I help the paramedics lay him back and I scoot down the bench near his head. I use a corner of the shock blanket to wipe his mouth and I brush the hair out of his eyes.
A small roll of my eyes precedes my words, "Then he'd laugh and hit you back and you'd engage in a rather clumsy and drunken fight that would probably end with me getting a call from Lestrade to come and fetch you. I'm well aware that hitting each other is how you army types express love."
I'm about to reply eagerly when my phone buzzes, reaching for it to read before showing John the text from Molly, asking if we'd like to visit for dinner as she had heard about the explosion.
I grow very slightly confused, "This wet and sloppy? Yes, sorry. I could use a condom in future." I quickly add, "If you wish to do it again that is."
“Woah, woah, woah!” I grab his shoulders, pushing him back down. “You have a concussion and smoke inhalation. You have to stay here.”
I nip at his ear before whispering, “In bed. You listen to me when I tell you to come for me.”
"I feel..." Following John like a sweeping, bobbing kite being pulled by a string, I search for the proper word. "...used."
Pausing in the door I whisper hurriedly, "But we've said everything there is to say. She knows I'm involved in a sexual and romantic engagement with you." I pause, then a look of horror comes over my face, "Unless you believe she'll want a threesome?"
Nodding I start texting her back, "I will confirm we shall both be there for dinner." Of course, the invite was only for myself but I'm sure Molly won't mind John coming also. We come as a pair now after all.
Sherlock
My eyes are drawn down a moment, then back up, moving to slip off the bed to stand, "You seem to wish to talk." I offer a small smirk, "Having emotional sex always seems to help you open up. Let me go and get something to clean with and then we can talk?"
Thundering up the stairs I swirl into the flat, bringing the crisp new year's day air inside. My coat shimmers with moisture and my hair has turned into a frizzy mess but I don't care as I look around for John.
“Sherlock....” I turn a bright shade of pink and cover my face with my hand.
Sherlock
I settle too, nuzzling his hair before leaning back into the pillows, gazing at the ceiling with sleepy eyes, "How often should I say the words?"
Sherlock
Nodding I just listen to John's calm voice, not really paying attention to his words, before I try and catch a breath and start coughing fitfully.
“What?!” I croak out.
Without even pausing I stride down the hospital corridor, "Rubbish John, where else would we go? Baker Street is our home."
“They said a week. It’s Sunday so... two more days.”
Sherlock
Sherlock
Finding his spine, my fingers tease down it, nodding, "We can compromise? Sometimes, even if I'm not aroused, I can provide you with sex anyway?"
Fingers curl in my hair, arranging it to full advantage as I peer in the mirror, "She's just invited me as a friend John. I'm sure she won't mind making room for another at her table. She'll soon realize the truth."
Nodding, I duck my head down to rest my lips into his soft hair, "And I you John. That ring I gave you isn't for show. In fact, rings are quite impractical for ornamentation in our lines of work."
Sherlock
My shoulders slump a little, shaking my head and glancing over at the basket instead, "Let me give you that massage."
“What?” I say astonished, “You bought it?” I look up my eyes sparkling.
Sherlock
“He’s fine, I know them.” The nurse nods and disappears into the room.
Rolling my eyes I start to oil my hands once more, sliding them together before reaching to take one of John's perfect little feet in my palm, marveling at how I could hold it almost entirely in my fingers, "Of course not. My feet are abnormal, like the rest of me. My toes are almost longer than some people's fingers."
"It's on my list of things I would like to try." I pull down his jeans and underpants, tossing them to the side, "You had a shower earlier so I know you are clean and fresh."
“I don’t pity you, Sherlock. All I wanted was to be with you. To love you.” I said louder, then my voice falls softer, “And maybe, if I was lucky, you’d love me too.”
My fingers slide into his, closing my eyes again and laying there, enjoying the crackle and pop of the fire as it dims, the warmth of the blankets and the smell of musk in the air.
“Of course.”
“I know. I’m sorry. I just feel like I should have been the one to pull you out. I should have been there for you.” I pull him back to me and kiss the top of his head.
“Yeah. I want to try that.” I lean down and bury my face next to the base of his cock before licking a stripe all the way up the underside.
I chuckle. “Sherlock, come on. Wake up, Love.” I start to slide out from underneath him, to climb out of bed.
My voice remains a soft whisper, holding him tight, "I'm so sleepy now. Is that normal?"
“Yes... yes, of course I will.” It comes out in almost a whisper, my eyes shining.
I see Sherlock trying to escape, but I grab the handles of the chair and drag him back. The nurse guides us to a room and I start helping Sherlock out of his clothes.
“Mmm. Ok. If you say so. Maybe you’re just turning into a romantic.” I suggest.
“Maybe you should try talking about it with him?” I offer.
I gasp a bit as he stands. “If you want, though I thought maybe that’s why you lit the fire.”
I narrow my eyes. “Fine.” I groan a bit. “Ridiculous... and I can’t even do anything about it now... bloody coat...” I mumble under my breath, pulling on my shirt not bothering to button it.
"NoPe, "I give him a mild little glance, "I slept earlier. I had things to do now."
I watch as he puts his sausages on my plate, and pushes his egg around some more. “You need to eat something.”
“Ugnnh.... maybe later...” I pant out, throwing my head and arms back again.
Wriggling into him I close my eyes, my voice sounding rough still and sleepy, making it so deep the floor might as well be vibrating under us with it's depth, "What if Lestrade doesn't get better?"
I give a firm nod and a smirk, "See. Your own moral compass. Or sorry, does the law include shooting cabbies through windows?" There's a strong note of teasing now in my tone.
Chuckling deeply and darkly I grab the zip of John's flies in my teeth, peering up at him with a hint of challenge in my eyes.
Sherlock
My eyes flutter a little, then I shuffle back on the bed, patting besides me, "I'm not quite laid out naked but will you sleep next to me?"
I roll my eyes. “Didn’t you just say that you were sure of the way I felt? I’ll do anything to keep you. Marry you, not marry you. Anything. I love you.” I glance down at his lips, running my thumb over his bottom lip before looking back up into his eyes.
Sherlock
“No. I wasn’t worried about what you might do. I just missed being with you. I don’t like being away from you. Is that so hard to believe?” I dip one of my chips in his tomato sauce.
Sherlock
My eyes are closed, lips curved in a small, almost sweet smile, "I walk in the door to that room. There's the small table besides it where we left our small belongings. I touch the tickets and recall our train journey there. I move to the table by the window. It's stacked with jars of honey. I take one, open it and am transported back to the bee shop. I open another and recall perfectly the day at the pond."
“I would suggest a bath but the water is still off here. Do you want to head back to the hotel?” I roll over to face him. “I could run you a bath in that fancy tub. It has those jets to bubble up the water.”
“I rather enjoy looking at it. Didn’t I tell you that the other morning in the shower?” I ask climbing out of bed to get dressed as well.
My shoulders give a very small shrug, "That either they're rushing into things or....we're taking too long. I'm unsure."
Bending to grab out bags I chuckle, "As my partner you are now legally obliged to oogle my rear."
“I want to though.” I climb up to be near him. “If not now, when?” I nip at his ear. “I want to make you feel good. I want to watch you come apart.”
That was not a nice sensation like the ones before. In fact it made me wince and curl up a little, then blink in horror as I feel something sliding out of me wetly, staring at John in growing dismay.
Chuckling, I gaze down at him, tilting my head a little, "Regardless of process and keeping track of progress on your internal scale..are you happy with how we are? Or do you dream of marriage?"
Pulling the pillow over my head I mumble, "No, you don't buzz that well. You make more of a panting, gasping noise."
I gather myself up and pull my pants and jeans back up. I smile crookedly to myself. Maybe that would make me feel less guilty about cutting drinks with Bill short, when he started to get a little too drunk. I look at my watch. 5:02. I still had a little time before I needed to get ready to meet Bill. I could do with a rest after that. I throw my legs up onto the couch laying back. I set the alarm on my watch for an hour and close my eyes.
Lifting my head slightly I snap, a little grouchy now and defensive, "Sexuality doesn't have to be black and white Molly. Surely you know that with all the looks you keep giving that female doctor who comes down to the morgue to get test results."
Sherlock
Grabbing his pants between my teeth, careful not to nip him this time, I try and pull them down once more, this time managing it but getting hit in the eye by an explosion of penis as it pops up through the resulting space created
Sherlock
My eyes light up, leaping out of bed and heading straight towards the bathroom without a word, my body striped in the remains of our playtime and needing to be washed away.
I twist my face still looking up at him from his lap. “I don’t know! That’s the point, isn’t it?!” I say a little loudly. “If we do it now, it’ll be like we are doing it to beat them, to spite them.” I huff.
Sherlock
I put my hand on top of his where it was resting on the Union Jack pillow. “I’m sorry. I drank too fast and the whole thing was stupid.”
“I’m sorry. Do you want me to stop?” I say but I don’t stop moving in and out. I snap forward deeper again and I let out a breathy ‘uh’.
“You’re going to have to show me which ones you’ve been watching. Their giving you unrealistic expectations.” I grin down at him.
"In this hotel, of course." Flopping down stomach first onto the bed I reach over to snag the phone off it's hook, "In this hotel we could get a personal massage service sent up to our room at this time also, if we so wanted."
“Careful!” I grab him before he falls. We shuffle inside and up to the room. I sit Sherlock gently on the bed and strip off my coat and still unbuttoned shirt. “Wait here.” I say and then disappear into the bathroom to run the bath. I find a packet of mint and lavender scented bath salts and add it to the water. When the tub is full enough I switch on the jets. I go back in the room to find Sherlock laying on his side on the bed still wrapped in his coat and the blanket from home.
