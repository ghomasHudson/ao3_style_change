"Thanks ms.Hudson, your a dear"
Sherlock was torn out of his thoughts when John’s voice broke through the silence, " Sherlock? What are you doing, love?" John asked sleepily and the detectives heart jumped at the pet name, another beloved attribute John had decided to forgo in the past few days.
“I was so scared. I thought I may never see you again. That I would have broken my promise to you that I wouldn’t leave you again. I tried to be so careful, but things didn’t go according to plan and…and” Sherlock was quickly getting overwhelmed and John flipped him onto his back, letting himself hover over the taller man.

"Doctor Watson, what have you been doing to help him?"
Once they turned the corner John took Sherlocks hand and immediately felt the taller man’s breath hitch and his eyes fell on him, but thankfully he didn't object.
The man leaned up to whisper in his ear, " hey i just got a new supply of heroine, a few of my buddies have tested it out and said its bloody amazing. You interested?"
John was clenching his jaw to keep the lump in his throat from rising any further. Sherlock’s mother quietly shedding tears behind him made things no easier.
John sat at the edge of the tub and bent to kiss Sherlock, trying not to let his eyes wonder. They had brought a plastic cup to wet and rinse Sherlock hair with.
John could tell Sherlock was thinking, but that he was also struggling to keep his eyes open; exhausted from the day. “come on, love. Let’s go to bed.” Sherlock made no attempt to move and John picked him up with a small laugh and carried him to his bedroom down the hall, placing him on the bed with a kiss. John went to Sherlock’s deep-toned mahogany dresser and opened the drawer he had filled with some of his things. He took off his clothes, tossing them to the corner of the room to be washed and put on a pair of boxers to sleep in. Sherlock was lying flat on his back, the same way John had left him. He crawled over his dark-haired lover, making sure to give him enough space to not feel trapped. John leaned in and kissed Sherlock deeply, slowly, and most important-lovingly. John had never felt a love like this. He doubted that anyone had felt a love as deeply as the one shared between he and Sherlock. His hands moved to undo the small bow that tied together Sherlock’s gown and he slid it off his shoulders. “gonna change your bandage and then we should sleep.” John stated. He cut away the dressing and observed the progress, one of the deeper cuts looked worse than it did yesterday, as if it had been broken back open.
John laughed, glad Sherlock wasn't all that down.
Sherlock lay on the couch, flat on his back, as he cherished the silence of their home. He quickly was entering his mind palace- going through rooms, files, and vaults of information hoping to find a loose thread in the case.
“I’ll do what I can.” John assured with a nod and went back inside. When he was back upstairs, he went back to Sherlock who was watching Mycroft’s car drive off. John stood at Sherlock’s left side and looked at the love bites. Sherlock looked at the shorter man and they broke into a short fit of laughter. “you should cover those when we leave the flat, I’m sorry, I’ll be more cautious of where I put them next time.” John spoke, running his ringers across them. Sherlock’s smile dropped, “I don’t want to cover them.” John looked confused “why? Sherlock, you know the team at Scotland yard will tease you I about it. Maybe more you than me.” Sherlock nodded, “they do that anyway, they’ve assumed we’ve been shagging for years, why not give them what they want.” John laughed softly, “ I guess I don’t particularly care if you don’t. but we have a new set of eyes on us now. Is that something you want Victor to see?” John asked, and his chest tightened bringing Victor into the conversation. “let him see it. He knows we are together John, or at the very least living with one another. I don’t care if he sees the evidence of our love on my body.” Sherlock’s articulateness never failed to impress John, but something about this statement caused an intense response. “Sherlock, are you…do you want Victor to know we are together? That I’m the one who marked up your neck?” Sherlock blushed and looked away, “oh. You do.” John said as his eyes dilated, and he pulled Sherlock into a heavy kiss. “you want him to know you're mine?” John whispered as he gently tugged Sherlock bottom lip with his teeth, a small ‘yes’ was all Sherlock could manage to choke out. “I’ll leave it up to you then, love. It’s all fine with me. It’s all fine.” John kissed him once more “I’m going to have to break this off here or else this case will never get solved.” The blogger teased as he sat back in his chair and resumed his work on his laptop.
"I know. It always looks perfect."
"It's okay, really, don't worry about me pressing you to do anything, you will never have to worry about that with me, tell me to stop and I will."
Hi my lovely readers! I hope you all enjoy this chapter, it's not as exciting as some of the past ones but it feels necessary. Stay healthy and safe, lots of love...
"Good night John, thank you for dinner and for not hating me." He bent down and kissed the top of Johns hair and moved to walk away when John caught his hand.

Hours had passed and the sun was shining through the pale yellow draped in the hotel room. John rolled over, extending his arm to throw over Sherlock but was disturbed to find the spot next to him empty. Groggy and still a bit dazed from his sleep he went to the bathroom, still not seeing Sherlock in their suite. The realization only hit him when he saw the bag, he had packed with supplies for Emily was gone and so was Sherlock’s coat. His blood ran cold as he stood shell shocked, staring at where the bag laid last night.

Sherlock knew the second John had worked it out, he gasped, and his eyes widened. John spoke in shock, barely above a whisper…
I had toast and some fruit. Also some tea.- SH
"You didn't a month ago" Sherlock mumbled
John’s heart felt like it had shattered " my god, Sherlock I promise I would never hit you. Come here" he moved toward the scared man before and wrapped him up in his arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulder and griped it tightly.
The DI looked Sherlock up and down quickly, “Right, okay. Thanks for dressing up for the occasion,” He said jokingly. “What did you find from the new evidence? Anything to convict Victor?”
"Sorry."
“then what other relationship do you have with her?”
"BECAUSE JOHN I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING THAT INTIMATE AND GRAHM RUINED IT ALL!"
“sweetheart, here, let’s get a bit more comfortable.” John said kissing the top of the detective’s head. John sat in his chair and pulled Sherlock onto his lap. The tall man let his legs dangle over the chair and pulled himself close to John his head coming to rest on the top of the others man’s shoulder. John held him tightly, kissing him occasionally, and comforted him as he slipped into his mind palace.
“no. you know what he did, but you don’t know the details- I’d prefer if it stayed that way. You’ll have to sit and listen to things I never wanted to say out loud-things I haven’t said out loud in all these years. By the time its all over you’ll realize I’m too fucked up to stay with. You’ll leave me and ill be alone, again. I’m damaged goods, John.” Sherlock voice nearly broke.
"Anytime. So you can come home now?"
"Just curious."
Two chapters in one night...whaaaat??!! i really hope you all enjoy these! Please please comment down below and tell me what you think, constructive criticism is always welcome! comments really fuel me to write more chapters sooner! lots of love <3
SO TO MY READERS-
"No it's not, hey, don't be afraid to ask me for anything, Kay?"
“ he would retrain my limbs in an imaginative number of ways: handcuffs, rope, belts, duct tape, scarves, zip ties- it didn’t matter, I was always restrained for these ‘sessions’ and if I resisted I would always get knocked out, either by physical blows or sedatives he would obtain from his friends. I was always restrained when I woke up. There were traditional acts of whipping, flogging” Sherlock hesitated with a shudder as he recalled the next one “caning. He would take box cutters and cut me, often threatening to cut my jugular if I didn’t comply with whatever rules he set that day, and I believe that he would have.”
John sighed, grabbed his coat, and went after him. He followed him with caution trying not to be seen. He followed the detective to a small park with a little pond and watched him sit down under a barren tree. It was the beginning of February and to say the least England was cold, and Sherlock didn't have his jacket. John watched as Sherlock sat there playing with his fingers. When Sherlock began to shiver John moved toward him and took off his jacket before wrapping it around his friend. Sherlock looked at him as John sat down.
"It's fine Greg, no worries. We'll be there in the morning."
"Sherlock stop." He said softly but with enough force to let Sherlock know he meant it.
" I saw the news...I wanted to make sure you were okay." He said in a sympathetic voice that only annoyed the detective.
“shit” Greg said in exasperation. “John, I know this isn’t what you want to hear, and I don’t want to say it, but I think we’re just gonna have to trust him and wait this one out. I say we give him another twelve hours and then we will notify the police.”
"Sherlock"
"Important enough to interrupt John and I wasn't it?"
The judge glared at her and smacked her mallet on the table, “sit down Ms. Trevor and don’t interrupt again, you had your time to speak.” She said coldly before motioning for Victor to continue.
Victor and Lestrade landed in Paris around noon and decided to get a bite to eat on their way to the hotel. They sat in a booth by the window, holding hands and planning their trip. Soon after Greg excused himself to the bathroom victor caught sight of a familiar blondish silver head of hair. He froze in shock and his blood boiled in anger as he watched John walking around aimlessly. He knew Sherlock wasn’t with him and he could tell by looking at the ex-soldier he didn’t know where Sherlock was, but Victor knew the sly detective had cracked his code and was under the ground beneath them. He quickly got out his phone and texted an old buddy from university that now resided in Paris. He wasn’t as sick and evil as Victor, but he lacked a moral compass and there were very few things he wouldn’t do for either drugs or cash. To make things better, he had also known Sherlock when he and Victor were dating and had a vendetta against the detective ever since he humiliated him in one of their shared classes.
They finished their meal, sherlock eating all but a few bites. This made John smile and reach under the table to squeeze his knee.
Hi friends! I am so relieved finals are finally over!I hope those of you that had exams did well :) THERE IS ONLY ONE MORE CHAPTER OF THIS STORY LEFT!! also i'm going to be completely honest, i hate this chapter and feel super insecure about posting it, but i really hope you all don't think its as bad as i do. Thank you so much for reading, can't wait to see you back for the final chapter!
Sherlock’s eyes shot to the side, sneaking a quick glance at her, “in what way?” although he knew exactly what she was referencing.
John leaned in even closer to Sherlock, “ can I finger you?” he whispered and Sherlock’s eyes opened, scanning over John. He nodded his head yes, “its-its been a really long time, John. I don’t even…to myself I mean.” Sherlock stumbled over his words. “it’s okay, I know what I’m doing, I’ll be gentile and will stop as soon as you ask.” John kissed him and Sherlock relaxed a bit more, “now, stop talking about fingering yourself or I’m going to finish too soon.” John said half-jokingly.
“ you may continue.” The judge announced, taking her seat once more.
"Tomorrow, if he stops messing with his IV and would corporate" she said scowling " If not we are stuck with him for anther day"
“he abused you differently than he did me. Worse is a relative feeling, an emotion. Just because he never…assaulted you in the same manner he did me- that doesn’t mean you didn’t suffer as much as I did. Everything you feel is just as valid.” Sherlock meant every word of what he said and hoped Emily understood it came only from a place of good intensions.
He comes by around noon and sticks around until we go home. - GL
“but you deserved better. You shouldn’t suffer because your brother and I have history. You always took care of me. Thank you for that…doctor Emily.” Sherlock joked towards the end. Emily smiled, “well, not quite.” Sherlock looked towards her “ what?”
"Sherlock!" John called throughout the flat.
"There is always a reason" Sherlock said pulling the sheet tighter.
He and Sherlock shared a grin before taking up their previous positions on the couch, " well, Sherlock, I doubt I will be able to go back to sleep here, and I really should, seeing as I have work in the morning. Would you come back to bed or would that be excruciatingly boring?"

"Ah, I don't know what would you like to be?" John asked with a hopeful tone.
Sherlock chuckled lightly and wrapped his body around John’s, falling asleep.
" how much have you had to drink."
"Sure" John smiled, and they headed toward a little cafe. John had an omelet and Sherlock had coffee, John let it go as long as he promised to eat a little bit of lunch or dinner.
“don’t come to the trial.” Sherlock spoke with a plea in his voice.
He heard a thump and got no response from the detective that was allegedly in the shower. He picked the lock and saw Sherlock laying in the bath, he had fallen and cut his head, blood tainted the water and even though John had seen enough blood and injury for a life time, the sight of his bleeding unconscious flatmate disturbed him. He brushed away those thoughts and lifted Sherlock so that he sat up against the back of the tub.
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16. Also, if you wish for me to go back and correct/ add more detail to previous chapters I am open to doing that. Thank you! Lots of love <3
" Sherlock, wow, never thought I would run into you. How have you been?"
"What I tell you stays between us, and us only. Sherlock shouldn't know for his benefit. It would hurt him to know I told you this." Mycroft’s tone became very serious.
The detective nodded and let out a long breath "how long have you been here?"
"Really?" sherlock asked, quirking an eyebrow.
“John,” Sherlock was the first to break the kiss “if we continue like this nothing will ever get done.”
Lestrade told them all about the passports and Sherlock’s excitement grew as the story continued. All of a sudden, the excitement stopped as a light bulb went off in his head. “Oh! Oh, how could I have been so stupid! It all makes so much sense.” The detective exclaimed rising from him chair, “The guano, the sediment, the calcium, it’s Christmas!”
The next morning John remained distant. He showered without an overused joke of how Sherlock should join him, there were no terms of endearment directed at Sherlock, no pet names or lingering touches, and when John left for the surgery, he cautiously placed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple before making his way down the stairs.
"Sherlock" John Said leaning closer to him " 5 normal sized bites, please"
"Do what you think is right, doctor Watson" Mycroft spoke softly. “despite our childish fued, I am genuinely concerned about him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After dinner, while others were settling into bed John joined Mycroft in the sitting room. The eldest Holmes took one look a the former army doctor and saw a dark intention. “ can I help you, Dr.Watson?”
" blade."
"I ate this morning I'm not hungry, I'll sit with you though. I believe a new episode of Doctor Who comes on tonight." Sherlock said, hoping to avoid confrontation.
"I'll try" he said moving to leave. He grabbed his coat and gave John another quick peck and left.
Mr. Holmes was a loving man, uncharacteristically gentle for a man of his time, always soft spoken and thoughtful with his words. He never acted from a place of anger. He accepted Sherlock wholeheartedly when he came out as gay, he was proud of his younger sons work and accomplishments. But never did he prepare himself for the feelings that overwhelmed him when he read over the article in the paper. In his time, men didn’t talk about sexual assault against other men and they definitely didn’t come forward about it. Mr. Holmes is a progressive man and had made himself overcome most of his prudence against the topic in recent years, even making donations in support of legal help for victims both male and female. However, it all felt very distant, things he heard on the television and forgot about by the next day, but this was his son. The boy he taught to walk, talk, read, drive, and to never apologize for being who he is had been defiled in a way he never thought possible. Much like his wife, he couldn’t help but feel responsible and guilty in one way or another. He vowed to always protect his family and he felt as if he had failed his son. Mr. Holmes’s vision of his son grew as Sherlock did, and for many years now he always saw Sherlock as a brilliant detective and man but now looking at him in the small living room of his flat he saw a little boy. His little boy. The same one whose eyes were glassed over and afraid of an outcome from breaking one of his father’s gardening tools while pretending to be a pirate.
As usual Victor showed up to NSY a little after noon and sat down in his spot in Lestrade’s office. The day progressed as usual, but Greg was nearly shaking with nervousness as it grew closer to closing time. Just as Victor began to pack his briefcase Lestrade stood from his desk and walked to stand in front of him. Victor smiles a debonair grin at him and Lestrade reached out to gently lay a hand on the side of the other man’s arm. “I know we’ve not known each other long, but I uh-was wondering if you would like to have dinner with me tonight.” Victor seemed confused at first but was soon blushing and nodding his head yes.
"You act like I can't take care of myself. 'Sherlock eat' 'Sherlock sleep' 'Sherlock clean up the acid in the sink' I get sick of hearing it John"
"Consulting detective, next."
Sherlock sat shell-shocked. There was a lot of truth in what John said and it cut deep. He blinked a few times, but John’s gaze never left him.
The judge remained stoic, “ was that the extent of his friends involvement?”
SMUT WARNING
When they arrived and got out of the cab Sherlock didn’t take John’s hand like he normally would. This pained John’s heart just a little but remembered that today was definitely not about him or his feelings. He could practically see Sherlock’s mind moving 1000 miles a minute and he knew that not one of those thoughts were about Emily. They entered the doors of NSY and walked down the hall towards Lestrade’s office. Sherlock stopped just out of view and turned to John who made quick work of moving to his lover’s side. “hey, hey, take some deep breaths. You are protected here, we will leave or take a break the second you want to get out, alright?” John tried to reassure him but Sherlock’s breathing was erratic and the taller man’s body began to sway back and forth, John knew he was about to have a panic attack and guided him towards a small cubby area with a few chairs and sat him down. “Sherlock. Sherlock, look at me.” His icy blue eyes met John’s and they took some steady breaths until Sherlock closed his eyes and was no longer trembling. “are you okay?” John asked and Sherlock nodded, “Let’s get this over with.” Sherlock stood up and John trailed very closely behind him.

“you sent Emily and Victor’s therapist to my home to be mine?!”
John let his arms fall from Sherlock and he went to sit in his chair, “let’s talk about this.” Sherlock came to sit on John’s lap, but the doctor shook his head, “not right now. This needs to be discussed.” It hurt to shut down contact from Sherlock, especially when he had spent so much time encouraging it; but there was a time and a place for everything and now wasn’t the time. Sherlock took his next best option which was half sitting on half leaning against the arm of John’s chair, “What do you want to know?” Sherlock asked sadly.
John pulled him to his chest, “ I’m not feeling very gentle tonight, Mr. Holmes.” they tumbled through the hallway to Sherlock’s bedroom, pushing one another against the walls and fighting for a sense of dominance-but it always belonged to John. The ex-soldier pulled the tie of Sherlock’s robe and slid it off his shoulders, both stumbling as it pooled at their feet, blocking their path. John picked up Sherlock, throwing him on the bed with a bit of added drama. He stared down at his boyfriend, pupils growing wider with lust as his hand slowly traveled down Sherlock’s long torso. John’s sweat pants had shifted even lower on the detectives hips, revealing the prominent V line that begged for John’s attention. He was trailing his fingers along either side of the V, ghost like touches that left Sherlock wondering if he was imagining them. John pulled the sweats from pale hips that finally looked human. Sherlock’s bones only visible when he arched his back in a way that nearly made John feral. Sherlock felt himself already starting to sweat under John’s attention. When the older man took him into his mouth he couldn’t help the fingers that went to the sandy blonde hair. When he realized what he had done he made a quick apology and removed his hand from John’s head. The blogger hadn’t missed a beat, continuing to trail his tongue over Sherlock’s leaking cock and sinking down on it as far as he could managing without gagging. He felt around the bed for his lovers hand, too consumed with what he was doing to pull off and look where it might have been. When his fingers finally touched Sherlock’s skin he placed the hand back where it had rested on the crown of his head.
The taller man moved away and wiped the tears off his face and apologized quickly
Sherlock cut him off with a kiss " i love you too"
Sherlock looked over at John and he tilted his head to signal for Sherlock to sit.
The detective teased him until shiny precome glazed over the head of his cock. Sherlock finally took him into his mouth and hummed in satisfaction as he began bobbing up and down on his boyfriend. Sherlock preened at John’s whispered ‘yes’s and ‘ god, just like that’s’ that came between compliments to Sherlock’s oral skills. The detective felt around the floor for the lube he had set down earlier and popped the cap off with his fingers, catching John’s attention. Sherlock spread the clear gel across two of his fingers as he pulled off of John’s cock and rested his head on his lover’s strong thigh. The doctor watched him with lust filled eyes as Sherlock reached behind himself and began pumping the slicked fingers in and out of himself.
“feel okay?” John asked.
“of him-Victor- he always reminded me if I told anyone about what he did, he would hurt my mum and dad. They traveled for work when I was young, they never knew until a few weeks ago.”
“John” Sherlock said in a conversational way rather than a moan of extasy. John moaned out a small ‘hmm’ encouraging Sherlock to continue. “John, I want you to fuck me.” Sherlock said seriously. The doctor stopped dead in his tracks and replayed the sentence in his head. He kissed up Sherlock’s back until he reached the nape of his lovers’ neck. His cock came to rest nestled between Sherlock’s bubble-like cheeks, “Sherlock… are you sure?” he asked hesitantly and felt the detective nod his head. “yes, John. I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t serious. Please. Please I need it. Put your cock inside me.” Sherlock was borderline begging as he pushed back against John’s raging hard length. John held Sherlock tightly in his arms and leaned over the other man’s shoulder to kiss him, “we don’t have to, if you want to stop-“ John started, sounding like a broken record, but a sweet one. Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes “ I know, I know, I’ll tell you if I want to stop. Now fuck me.” John moaned deeply, hearing Sherlock talk like this was intensifying his own arousal. The shorter man took the bottle of lube from the nightstand and began to work Sherlock open with his fingers. The detective’s cock was leaking with pre-come and he was completely pliant under John’s touch. Only for John Watson would Sherlock be pliant.
"You're uncomfortable."
" John, I can't promise you a perfect and easy or even a halfway normal relationship but I swear I will try my hardest to make it work. I've never been as happy as when I am with you. I wouldn't trade a moment with you for anything, not even the greatest murder if it meant I couldn't solve it with you."
“well then what is it?”  he questioned in a frustrated tone.

“there was a buttplug that was tiered in squares of decreasing size- I’ve drawn an image as a reference-” he handed the paper to the same officer who gave it to the judge, her brows raising as she studied the image. “ they corners were sharp and painful, they were meant to be.” The image was soon placed under the projector for the rest of the court to see along with the other pictures that had been viewed so far. “ the two wired that come from the base were connected to a remote. The plug was able to conduct powerful electric shocks and-”
The dark  curled pulled away from the microscope and a crinkle on the pale forehead gave away the mans confusion, “ yes, fine, why?”
Sherlock shook his head and took another sip of his tea.
"Where's Lestrade, he called me here since you and Anderson can't do anything correctly beside cheat on each other.
"He doesn't eat, he is getting paler by the minutes and I'm just worried that one day I'll wake up but he won't." John said, his voice beginning to shake towards the end.
They walked to his bed room and John and laid out a pair of boxers and sweat pants.
Victor sat two wine glasses down and poured them a serving of sauvignon blanc. Lestrade was desperate to leave but knew it would be suspicious if he had to leave immediately after Victor had left him alone, so he continued to play along. It wasn’t hard to play along, Victor was charismatic, charming, enthusiastic and a great conversationalist; not to mention easy on the eyes. The mood of the evening quickly changed when Lestrade found himself being straddled by the strawberry blonde who was kissing along his neck. “I have work tomorrow, I really should go,” Lestrade said casually and Victor looked down at him with hurt in his eyes. “You could stay over,” he offered but Lestrade shook his head. Seeing the disappointed look in Victor’s eyes pulled at his disgustingly sentimental heart and he pulled Victor into a deep passionate kiss, “Another time, I promise,” He said and Victor nodded as he removed himself from Greg’s lap.
John and Sherlock both felt relieved after confessing their encounters with Victor to one another. Sherlock was content and at ease to be sat in John’s lap and John was more than happy to have him there. They rested for several minutes in peaceful bliss, only the sound was that of the dryer humming down the hall.
"Not hungry" as soon as the words left his mouth John wanted to tell him he was a liar and shove a piece of toast in the man’s mouth.
"Tell me what"
"John" Sherlock asked, internally nervous.
After Lestrade’s statements the judge closed the session for the day, deeming it suitable to continue at noon the following day. Her words burned in Sherlock’s ears, “tomorrows time will be dedicated to the allegations made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes against Mr. Victor Trevor.” That meant all of tomorrow, however long the court would go on would be solely dedicated to intimate discussions of his past. The very thought made his stomach do flips and his hand tighten in John’s. Sherlock’s side of the court was dismissed first and he said his goodbyes to those who had attended as John thanked them for their support. Sherlock supposed he appreciated their being there but couldn’t help but think he wished they wouldn’t come, at least not tomorrow. He and John sat down on a bench near the doors of the court, hand in hand. Waiting for the call that their cab had arrived. Ms. Hudson who was sharing the ride back, was caught up in conversation with one of the other attendees.
“yes, to safely dispose of at the surgery.”
Strangely, Sherlock felt unbothered by Victor’s snide remark. It was almost as if a new wave of assurance and confidence had washed over him. “ I know. I’m fine, John.” He leaned into his lovers touch even more, “ I really am.”
"I've heard enough from you this morning thanks" John scoffed
“no. the angle of the letters would make it physically impossible for me to have done anything other than the straight lines that overlap them.” Sherlock sated, his face burning with embarrassment and anxiety.
John sat quiet and just stared at Mycroft for a minute. He wanted to find Victor, track him down and kill with his own hands. He felt sorry for Sherlock, wanted to hold him and make everything better. He was surprised to learn Sherlock liked him more than a flat mate and friend and he felt awful knowing he was the reason Sherlock was starving himself.
“yes.”
"Do what?"
John moved to his room and put on a red button down and khakis.
When Sherlock walked in the door of 221b he listened to hear if anyone besides him was home. No one was. In theory john should be returning in less than an hour and Sherlock was trying to decide how to spend this time. His typical self-destructive thoughts rose up in his mind as he walked up the stairs to their flat. He walked over to his desk beside the window and pulled open the top drawer- in it lied several boxes of nicotine patches and a half empty box of cigarettes he turned to only in desperate times or a celebratory occasion. It had been nearly nine months since he had smoked an actual cigarette and felt that a day like today definitely called for one…or two…or however many was left. He laid down on the couch, his upper back and neck supported by arm and a pillow. He took one of the cigarettes from the box and lit it before bringing it to his lips and taking in a long drag. He held the smoke in his lungs until he had to exhale and watched as the smoke left his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
" hey, you okay?"John asked running his hand down Sherlocks arm. The taller man nodded but still seemed tense. John kept his hands in one place and went back to slowly kissing him, that seemed to help a little bit. " god Sherlock you are so beautiful." He said running a hand through the curls and his lover leaned into his touch. He moved back to kissing John and even wrapped his thumb in the elastic of John's boxers. He gave him a questioning look and John nodded in approval. Sherlock was feeling pretty confident at this moment and started kissing down John's body. Taking his time licking, sucking, and playing with John's nipples. John let out small grunts of pleasure and continued to praise him.   Sherlock had now come to the point where he was on his knees kissing at the inside of John's thigh and over his hips.
The detectives head jerked up immediately, “you remember me…” he trailed off and Emily nodded trying her best to give him a faint smile. “are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?” he inquired calmly as he began to pull the first aid kit from the bag.
" I would prefer if I Could wear my boxers."
Throughout the movie Sherlock continued to stab around at his noodles never taking a bite though.
He spoke eloquently and walked away, knowing he needed to get back to 221b before his body turned him around. He needed to be home and he needed John, but John was at the office and he would not bother him. John deserves to have a break from him once in a while.
"God no, I would never do that." John said quietly and reached across the table to take Sherlocks hand.
They assumed respective positions and just enjoyed the feeling of warmth and love that surrounded them.
“mmm, you’re in the catacombs.”
Sherlock awoke in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. Frightened from the images his subconscious had created of Victor touching his hair. When his eyes shot open and he realized he was safe in his bed with John, he calmed his breathing and gently turned onto his side so that he was facing his lover. John was fast asleep, seemingly at complete peace. Sherlock lay there and observed the rugged features of the man's face in the dim glow of the streetlights outside. He brought up his hand and traced John’s jawline softy as he took a deep breath, inhaling the familiar and comforting scent of John’s aftershave. John’s eyes began to flutter open softly.
“I’m about to be in my last year of medical school.” Emily said proudly and Sherlock couldn’t stop the smile that spread across his face, “congratulations. I always knew you’d make a good doctor.”
When the environment around them stopped shaking Sherlock backed away from Emily slowly. His flashlight was still shining dimly at the front of the little crevice and they couldn’t hardly see one another. The only sound was the sharp ringing in their ears and the labored breathing shared between the two of them.
"I hadn't seen it, we have watched the others. Why do you not like it? I can take it –“ sherlock rambled nervously, worried that john may be judging his choice of film.
"You should go home and sleep."
Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant man in many ways, he sought out adventure and danger-this was no secret. But even he with his normally exuding confidence knew he was no explorer. Having to trust his safety and Emily’s return to members of his homeless network was more than concerning, he dreaded the feeling of not being in control and the uncertainty that followed it.
He walked over to the detective and kiss his cheek once more before whispering, " Good night beautiful, see you in the morning"
“Your honor” he began with tears in his eyes and a sorrowful voice, “ my sister is very sick. She has been for a long time. As a child she would be fine one minute and acting erratically the next. Sometimes she would hit herself hard enough to leave bruises. I used to hold her arms close to her so that she didn’t hurt herself too badly.”
" I'm sure, please let me suck your beautiful cock."
John had been the one to greet them and with neither he nor Sherlock being warned of their impending arrival you can imagine the look of surprise that washed over the doctor’s face as Mrs. Holmes pushed past him, eager to see her son. Mr. Holmes on the other hand gave John a tight smile and handshake.
“Sherlock explain it, I don't understand.” John’s tone expressed worry underlaying with confusion.
Sherlock nodded against John's chest
“Mycroft Holmes and John Watson.”
“what is your relationship to Ms. Trevor?” the dark-haired woman repeated.
"It's my job."
Hi friends! I deeply apologize for not updating when i said i would! i've gotten sick twice lately and it pushed everything back for a bit. I am so nervous to post this chapter, i rewrote it so many times- i hope you like it and if you don't please be nice in the comments. I'm fragile lol.
After a while of her being there and simply talking to him john noticed Sherlock was becoming tired and quite annoyed. He loved ms.Hudson dearly but this moment wasn't the best to hear stories about her and the late mr.hudson.
"I don't want to hear it" John said angrily
"What exactly do you want to discuss about it?"
“sorry, that was crude and none of my concern.” She said apologetically.
After what Sherlock had told him about his time with Victor he didn’t think he would ever be able to bring himself to take Sherlock on his hands and knees- for his sake, not Sherlock’s- but maybe Sherlock laying on his front would be a suitable alternative. John leaned down close to Sherlock’s ear, tracing the shell of it with the vey tip of his tongue, “ roll over.” And Sherlock did without fuss. The detective relieved to have some kind of consistent pressure on his cock. John smirked out of Sherlock’s view as he watched the younger man roll his hips against the mattress. John finally pulled his trousers and pants down completely and parted Sherlock’s perfect ass, plunging in hard and fast- unknowingly giving Sherlock not only what he wanted, but what he needed. He heard Sherlock moan his name loudly and still beg for more, “ harder, John please, mmm more…”
“no.” Sherlock interrupted. “we can’t arrest them yet. We need them to think we are still as lost about all of this as we were two days ago.”

The two climbed into bed and cuddled closely. Sherlock clung to John a little tighter tonight than most. When John’s soft snores filled the room, Sherlock began watching the time and monitoring John’s breathing for the best time to sneak out.
When the emotions in the room had settled enough for them to all take a seat, Sherlock gave them a brief summary of what to expect to be discussed in court, should they come. He fought with them not to, to spare him the humiliation, but they insisted. When Mrs. Holmes grew brave enough to ask about Victor, John reached over to take Sherlock’s hand out of habit and almost jumped back when the grey haired woman let out a shrill sound. John looked at Sherlock as it dawned on the both of them that the detective’s parents were unaware of their relationship. They were both overjoyed and switched any talk of Victor to be about his and Sherlock’s relationship.  The Holmes’s had arrived only a day ahead of the court date and were staying in a hotel nearby.
The detectives wet curls moved slowly as he came to.
John walked sluggishly back to sherlocks hospital room. When he approached the door he could hear Sherlock arguing with a nurse and decided he should make himself present.
As he was about to respond a call came in over johns pager that his lunch had to end early. A little boy, 6 years old was having difficulty breathing. After a few listens to his lungs and hearing what was wrong John sent him over to the hospital. He had developed  pneumonia and needed treatment.

Sherlock hummed in reply, “Well, if that’s all then I’d like to get back to trying to locate your sister.”
"Little."
“I know,” he said defensively “I’m doing it for me. Because even if it brings me no peace at least I know he won’t be out preying on other people, causing them damage, abusing them the way he did me and Emily. Don’t you understand, John? He is just like all the other criminals we chase after and put in jail- he’s a threat to society.” Sherlock had sat up and positioned himself to face his partner.
PS. I'm thinking my update schedule will be every other Wednesday until the story is complete.
Hearing his best friend in tears because of him sent a single tear down his cheek.
As her tears began to slow Sherlock handed her one of the granola bars and sat down, propping himself against the same wall Emily was against. He kept his head down, only glancing at Emily every few minutes.
Ms.hudson emerged from the stairs. "Boys! It is past 4 AM and I am trying to sleep, could you please save whatever was so funny until morning!"
John fully expected Sherlock to collapse next to him after an orgasm like that. But as usual Sherlock surprised John, pushing him backwards and licking his own cum off of John’s thighs before deepthroating John’s length, “oh my god” John exasperated as he watched Sherlock take him into his throat. It wasn’t a minute later that John was warning Sherlock he was about to finish, but just like that morning in the shower Sherlock swallowed all of John’s load without an issue.
" okay just let me grab a few things." Sherlock said moving toward his room.
John stood from the bed and took Sherlock’s hand, “ see you tomorrow, it was nice meeting you.” He said with a grin as Sherlock began to lead him out of the room.
A penny for your thoughts? I am so nervous, but also very proud and excited for this story to come out! I hope you all like it <3
"Need any help?"

As they walked, they casually bumped into each other like always and Sherlock pulled Johns jacket tighter around him. Upon returning home Sherlock went to lay on the couch and fell asleep.
Two hours or so had passed. Sherlock was still deep in his head and it wasn’t until someone wrapped a hand softly around his wrist that he began to come back to reality. He knew it was a little too early for John to be back, and even if he was, he would never interrupt Sherlock when he was in his mind palace, especially not by touching him. When he opened his eyes, Victor was hovering above him. Sherlock stood up quickly and took a step back looking slightly down towards Victor, “what do you want?” Sherlock managed to keep his voice unwavering. “I was with Lestrade who wanted to drop off some of the photographs to you but got caught up with another case, so I offered to bring them.” Victor said as he set a manila file on the coffee table. “how nice of you.” Sherlock mumbled sarcastically.

"Sherlock you'll have to speak up" John said, taking a sip of juice.
The feeling of John’s mouth, hot and wet- mixed with suction and scandalous teases of tongue was begging to grow too much for Sherlock to handle. His chest was heaving and his skin was glistening with sweat. “mmmm, John…” it was meant to be a warning, one John chose to ignore. “ please… I don’t want this to be over.” He panted, and groaned in pleasurable agony when John only bobbed his head faster. Right as the white hot heat blazed within his abdomen John pulled off, ruining the orgasm that was impending. Sherlock grabbed the pillow adjacent to his head and pulled it over his face, muffling the sound of his frustrated and incredibly aroused groan. “damn you, John….” When he heard John chuckle above him he wasn’t sure whether to be annoyed or find humor in it. His cock was achingly hard and throbbing, sensitive from John’s ruthless teasing and denied relief. He removed the pillow from his face he smiled at John, who was staring at him from the end of the bed. “ why on earth are you still clothed?” he asked, letting his head fall back and reaching to take himself in hand.
“I’d really like you to tell me, I think we’ve got a long walk ahead. I’ve pieced together segments of what probably happened but I’d like to hear it from you.” Sherlock spoke, glancing over to the shorter girl every now and then. “truthfully, the first thing I want to know is why. Why did he do this to you?”
" I need to help you, you're not stable enough right now"
Sherlock hadn't been asleep; he had been building up the courage to this.
"Fine, what do you do for a living?"
"Sherlock Holmes you are the most awful human being I have ever met." She spit back at him.
While John placed his stuff back into his room Sherlock called and made reservations at Angelo's and hung up before John came back down.
"Enemies then?"
“I knew her well.”
They both stood up and Greg pulled him into a friendly hug, “it’s going to be alright. He’s Sherlock…he’s probably rescued Emily and they are on their way now.” Greg spoke trying to convince even himself.
Sherlock pulled away and looked into John’s eyes, barely visible in the low-lit room, “ what I’ve wanted-needed since the beginning…don’t treat me like I’m broken. Don’t ask if I’m alright every five minutes. I told you long ago, John, if I don’t want to do something I’ll tell you.”
“no, she was a very happy little girl.”
"You." Sherlock said at almost a whisper volume.
He soon retreated to his room. The bed was still freshly made with his clean sheets, the window held securely in place by the poster stick. He undressed and climbed into bed but not before checking the window and his closet. He felt pathetic that he was still scared with victor locked in jail. He lay restless under the covers; every small noise made his chest feel tight and his mind think the worst. He knew sleep would never come this way.
"Are you hungry, I suppose a little bit. You?"
Sherlock shook his head, “no, the first day we went to the lab and you went with Molly to the morgue…” he trailed off explaining what had happened and he watched John’s fist clench and unclench as he recounted the story. The detective smiled- bad timing for sure. “what are you smiling about?” John said coldly and his stare pierced Sherlock’s eyes. “I’m not scared that you’re going to hit me.” Sherlock said factually and watched as John’s eyes softened and his fist unclenched. “no, of course I’m not going to hit you.” he placed a hand on Sherlock’s long, slender thigh and held it there as the detective continued to talk.
"Lestrade texted, missing person, I'm of course needed."
He scoffed " I am anything but perfect John"
John nodded and moved toward Sherlock and connected their lips. It was appearing that Sherlock hadn't properly kissed anyone before now, for the first few moments he kept his mouth still as a statue. He seemed to catch on after that and was seemingly enjoying the kiss, his mouth moving in perfect time with Johns.
AUTHORS NOTE
"Right, thanks I guess. I'm going to shower" John said untangling himself from his lover, " if you need anything just yell for me, I should be out in a few minutes."
John had followed the news reports to the location on ground level where the explosion had broken through the pavement. The streets were closed off, ambulances were helping patrons that had been in the pub nearby. He stood watching as a scene from a movie seemed to unfold in front of him. He had offered to help but was informed it wasn’t needed.
" I didn't know you could cook"
"Yes"
When they arrived Sherlock left John to pay the cab fare as usual, while he was already making his way up the stairs. The detective had taken off his blazer and hung it on the back of the kitchen chair, replacing it with his blue dressing gown. He sat down at his microscope and acted as if it was any other day- like the entire past six hours hadn’t happened. John tried that tactic too, changed from his court clothes into more comfortable ones, made the two of them a cup of tea and began typing away at some medical records. This farce lasted all of an hour before he was bursting at the seams to have Sherlock say something-anything- about the trial. “are you okay?”
When the court was called to session, they began with Emily. Victor was charged with kidnapping, attempted murder, and child endangerment- but the evidence wasn’t found sufficient for child abuse. Sherlock met Emily’s eyes, she gave a smile and a small shrug that seemed to say ‘you can’t win them all.’ When John grabbed his hand he knew it was his part of the case that was about to be given a verdict.
After seated at their normal table Angelo came out, " ah my boys! Sherlock I heard you were in the hospital! What happened? You alright now, no?"
"Good, because i love you too."
" can't complain, you?"
"The middle doesn't have any of the traits of his brother and sister or of the parents. I would say he is adopted."
Sherlock bit his tongue to hold in the snide remark he was going to fire back at her.
He could practically see Sherlock rolling his eyes as he said it.
"Dinner"
" John, I want to please you. I want to be able to give you everything your previous lovers have given you and so much more. One thing that they have given to you is sex, while I really struggle with the concept, I would love nothing more than to continue trying to become intimate with you."
"No, I just need you in the morning, it's not all that important."
"Want any help with the spaghetti?" Sherlock offered with a smile.
John smiled a bit, “still, I shouldn’t have yelled like I did.”
"And i love you"  Sherlock was getting tense as John moved down and it was noticeable. He removed himself from Sherlocks torso and moved back up to kiss him.
Victor did an answer, just grinned like the devil himself and sat back down. The judge looked utterly shellshocked and hastily called the session for the day, announcing the case will wrap up tomorrow and a decision will be made.

" go back to work, John." Sherlock said icily, picking up his coat and walking upstairs to his own flat.
“we are here to work John; I hadn’t anticipated us doing anything else.” Sherlock said before he saw John’s facial expression drop ever so slightly “but, I guess we could do whatever you’d like after business is taken care of. Maybe we could even stay a few days extra….”
"John, I hope to eventually have a average relationship with you. Dates, kissing, meeting each other's families, and sex. I realize my view on the topic was tainted but you and most of the population seem to enjoy it so I really do want to try. I suppose to answer your questions: I know this isn't exactly anything sexual but maybe it's something, I would like you to help me wash before bed."
Sherlock blushed obviously embarrassed
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16. Also, if you wish for me to go back and correct/ add more detail to previous chapters I am open to doing that. Thank you! Lots of love <3
"Just hold me, please?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Privacy is stupid."
"Not this one. I don't want any of her relatives to know I ever looked at this. I mean it Lestrade, my name is never mentioned in the context of this crime scene ever." With that Sherlock moved quick to leave and get a cab, John had to run to catch up with him.
“God, look at you.” John said from the doorway, walking towards the taller man and wrapping his arms around his torso, “you’re bloody gorgeous.” John placed a kiss to Sherlock’s chest before looking up at him and pleading with his eyes for a real kiss. Sherlock bent down slightly and gave him a slow kiss. John ran one of his hands down Sherlock’s stomach and Sherlock’s muscles tightened beneath John’s fingers causing him to pause his movements, leaving his hand there to rest. They kissed a moment more and John let his other hand wander down the backside of Sherlock’s body. It was a bold move and John knew it, he’d never so much as attempted to touch Sherlock’s bottom but despite the events of today now felt like the time. John’s hand drifted slowly to give Sherlock an idea of where it was headed, giving him time to protest; but when he didn’t John’s strong hand rested on part of his ass and gave it a slight squeeze.  Sherlock pulled away from the kiss and looked at John searching for answers in his face. John smiled, “you’ve got the most perfect arse. I have to confess I’ve stared at it at crime scenes as you’ve bent over, when we go up the stairs. Sherlock I am in love with everything about you.” John spoke, sincerity showing through his voice. Sherlock sighed in what felt like relief. Moments ago, he stood in this same spot picking himself apart, only to have to his lover take those thoughts away, even for a just a moment. “and I you, John.”
"Kay"
They walked down the steps together and before he opened the door for Emily to step out into the cold he stumbled over his words, “ I apologize, for how I reacted. It was out of line and uncalled for.”
"I only sleep in my pants, is that alright?"
"Come on love, mycroft will be here soon. We can talk at home."
They drove back to Victor’s small but lavish house and Greg sat down on the couch, slightly tense and observing the room. He didn’t have many one-night stands, and certainly not many with criminals he thought to himself. Male criminals his subconscious reminded him and he internally cursed Sherlock. Victor sat next to him and the pair continued their conversation between lazy kisses. “Do you want some more wine?” Victor offered. Greg nodded, “Please.”  Victor stood, “It’s in the basement. I’ll be right back,” He said placing his hand high up on Greg’s thigh and giving him one more kiss.
The judge called for a recess and the courtroom dismissed into the hallway. John chased after Sherlock who was hot on Mycroft’s heels.
He only sobbed harder.
“because that’s what I thought love was.”
“no. I just needed to be alone with you for a few minutes.” John said finishing up and washing his hands before pulling Sherlock into one of the stalls and locking the door. He leaned onto the balls of his feet and kissed the detective slowly. He could feel his lover relaxing in his arms as he held him in an embrace.
“can we rest a minute, please?” Emily said, already sinking to the floor.
"I'm disgusting," tears began to fall down the pale man’s cheeks " this is why John won't love me, I have to fix it, I won't eat for 4 days this week, lots of water, I'll get out and exercise. Maybe then he will love me."
"I know John" he said breathily. Another sequence of cursing and a final "ah shoot it up me" before the sound of the bed moving quieted and John couldn't help but burst into giggles along with his lover. " I think he is much more than alright, John." This set off another round of laughter.
“How?”
Sherlock wrote down a few more comments on his spread sheet before packing up his things and walking with John out of the lab. John ordered takeout on the cab ride home, assuming they would arrive to 221b around the same time the delivery boy did. “Sherlock, are you alright?” John asked and gave his hand a gentle squeeze. Sherlock nodded but it wasn’t good enough for John. “No. Really, I want to know how you are feeling. What happened when I left the room? I’m so sorry I had to leave, it felt like I didn’t have much of a choice without making it obvious I didn’t want the two of you left alone.” John continued rambling and Sherlock listened as best as he could in his dazed state. “why did the two of you pretend like you didn’t know one another? I mean I didn’t expect you all to start hashing out your history in Lestrade’s office but acting as if you’d never met the person you were in a so-called relationship for so many years, I mean- “
"I love you." John spoke quietly.
John got up after a few minutes of basking in the afterglow and grabbed a flannel from the laundry basket in the corner, first cleaning himself and then leaning over to clean Sherlock who was seemingly still trying to process what had happened. John wiped Sherlocks stomach and kissed him gently, throwing the towel back into the laundry basket. John lay back down and was the first to break the silence, “you were incredible, baby.” John kissed the shoulder closest to him, “I’m so lucky” he kissed him again “are you okay, my love?” John asked, turning onto his side and laying an arm across Sherlocks body. Sherlock audible swallowed, “yeah, I’m good. Really good.” Sherlock paused and John chuckled, hugging Sherlock closer to him. “does it always feel like that?” Sherlock asked and John looked up at him, “what? An orgasm? Yeah, it's pretty incredible every time.” He replied and Sherlock nodded his head slightly. They lay there comfortably in one another arms until Sherlock broke the silence, “ I get it now.” He stated and John quirked an eyebrow at him. “I get why people have sex. Why they obsess over it. Why they pay for it, lie for it, cheat for it. It’s like its own brand of heroine.” The comment took John by surprise, but he hummed in response, “yeah, that’s one way to think about it…so you enjoyed yourself then?” John asked and Sherlock half laughed “Yes, John, I thought that was fairly obvious.” John playfully swatted at him before bringing the blankets back up to cover their naked bodies as they fell back asleep in one another’s embrace.
Bradshaw cocked his head, clearly surprised. He reached for a form on his desk and picked up a pen, bringing it to his lips nervously. “alright… Would you rather speak with Lestrade about this matter, he should be back soon.”
No, it’s 7AM. We don’t spend every minute together, you know. - GL
Lestrade was sat next to Donovan and he could feel his stomach begin to churn as he put the story together while Sherlock’s last sentence replayed in his head.
“if he plead not guilty, he knew I would have to testify. Probability and tradition says the ‘victim’ always tells their story first period he just wanted to watch me relive those memories, to hash the most private details of my life out to a room filled with people.”
“well, not exactly, but its related.” Emily continued the evade the topic she came to discuss, and Sherlock’s patience was growing thin.
A few members of NSY gave statements about evidence found prior to Sherlock’s help and then it was time for the detective himself to take the stand. As Sherlock rose to his feet he secured the middle button of his suit jacket and took a deep breath. He was confident about his information; he had no reason not to be. This would be the easy part of the trial, discussing his findings in front of people was something he took pride in. Perhaps it was because it helped him exude a confidence he didn’t have in his personal life, or maybe it was the ego boost it gave him when people were amazed by his discoveries. He took a sip of water and John looked towards the ceiling with a pleading look, to whatever god may be listening, that Sherlock wouldn’t act like a complete cock.
“John” he said placing a comforting hand on the good doctor’s shoulder “shit… I know you must be worried out of your mind right now, but we need to think of something fast alright.”
"JOHN" Sherlock called out
"So I know you haven't told anyone but of course I know, relationship life treating you well?"
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020).

"I've gotta go alright"
“oh god.” John whispered, placing two fingers to one of his temples and rubbing them in tight circles.
"None of that either"
“I don’t know if you want John to be here while we talk about it…” she finally spit out, catching the two men’s attention.
“Mr. Holmes” she warned about to added metaphor.
Sherlock nodded and left.
The detective finally rolled off of his doctor after a gentle kiss. John watched carefully as Sherlock sank lower down the bed until he was lingering over John’s groin. The doctors eyes widened in both surprise and anticipation as Sherlock began licking over his skin to swallow the come that had been inside him moments ago.
"Sherlock" John whispered but Sherlock didn't look up he just continued to kiss down Johns neck.
When John came back upstairs Sherlock was still leaning against the arm of his chair. John brought him close, resting his dark hair against his soft jumper. Sherlock didn’t cry, he couldn’t force the tears to his eyes, he just stared.
John chuckled fondly and brought Sherlock down into a deep kiss. When Sherlock leaned down to meet John it lifted his hips to a perfect angle and the shorter man took advantage of the opportunity. He reached between them and grabbed the base of his cock and guided it into Sherlock’s tight entrance. The detective gasped, “oh” and John smiled against his lips.
" your not a problem. Will you tell me why you dropped the case?"

"Fine. Let's just get started."

" i love you too but god your acting weird. Go on make French toast."
There was nothing of great sustenance in their short conversation but for someone like Sherlock who had never encountered someone who cared enough about him just to check in during the middle of an ordinary day- it evoked feelings within him that he wasn’t sure how to respond to.
"Did I wake you?"
“Where’s Victor?” John asked, making his way towards Sherlock and wrapping his arm around his thin waist. Sherlock flinched and a look of concern was plastered on John’s face, it had been weeks since Sherlock reacted to something as small as that.
"I'll go get some food from the cafeteria and-"
John kissed him lightly, “I forgive you. But that doesn’t mean I’m not still pissed off about it.”
"Please" Sherlock spoke quietly as he sat down at his desk.
Sherlock shook his head, “ no, well-yes- I do want to, but that’s not the main purpose of why I’m down here.” A small smile played on his flushed pink lips. John’s eyebrow quirked as he watched Sherlock pull a small tube of slick from his blazer. John huffed a laugh “please tell me you didn’t bring that with you to court.” He teased, earning a small chuckle from Sherlock, “of course not, that would be highly inappropriate.” He set the tube next to him on the floor and reached to remove John’s hard member through the keyhole in his briefs. He wasn’t sure when Sherlock had made the turning point to become a little minx but he certainly wasn’t going to complain about it. Sherlock confidently licked John from base to tip and then back down, never breaking eye contact. John let his head drop back against the chair as he let out a deep groan, his hand instinctively went to rest lightly on the back of Sherlock’s head.
" did you ever sleep" John asked tiredly
"I'm really proud of you, ya know."
Johns chest swelled with a type of honor that Sherlock trusted him so deeply, and also with pride in his partner, knowing this was not a lightly made choice. “ sure, I’ll do that as soon as I go back next week.”
"No it's not. I can." John said, laying his fork down on his plate with a clanking sound.
“You like him.” Sherlock declared, no evidence of question in his voice.
John thought for a moment, “yeah, I am. Don’t get me wrong, I have my worries about it…and you, but I’m okay. You know I am going to protect you at any cost, right?”
John looked up at him, staring, it was like an unspoken reassurance that Sherlock really was ready. The doctor held his lover close and placed a hand on the side of Sherlock’s face, bringing him closer into a lingering kiss, “will you still be ready this evening?” it was obvious the question took Sherlock by surprised, “what? I assume I would, but why not now?” he asked impatiently in typical Sherlock form. “I want this to be special for you, sweetheart.” John said softly as he stroked the side of Sherlock’s face with his thumb. Sherlock opened his mouth to argue but John cut him off, “ I want our first time together to be special, not some quick roll around in the sheets.” John said gently with another kiss to the detective’s lips. “ and Sherlock…” John waited for the tall man to meet his gaze, John held him tight against him, “certainly not without letting me open you up with my fingers and tongue. You can’t just take me in your tight little hole without anything first, baby.” Sherlock blushed in embarrassment; in the heat of the moment he had forgotten all about preparing himself to be able to take in John’s considerable length. He softly nodded his head and adjusted his body so that their cocks lined up with one another. He wrapped his hand around the both of them and began to stroke them against each other. He and John both moaned, slipping back into their aroused states. They were both getting close to their climax. John’s breathing was getting faster and his toes were curling in pleasure, “sher…love, I’m close.” He panted and Sherlock hummed in response, kissing the doctor’s neck as he stroked them faster. Soon John was coming and it was dripping down Sherlock’s fingers onto his own stomach as Sherlock came with a loud moan, his come landing with John’s.
" can you please play with my hair"
“ I have a witness and two people who can back up my story.”
"Suppose so, I just didn't expect it from you" John felt Sherlock tense "doesn't mean I don't like it though" the lanky man pressed against him relaxed.
"You will eat it?"
What wasn't perfect was the fact he had morning wood and was still pressed against Sherlock, which only made it worse. He tried to will it away but to no avail. He stayed wrapped around his lover and silently pleaded for him not to notice.
Smut warning! I hope you all like this chapter!
(See the end of the chapter for
“The catacombs?” The DI’s interest was at an absolute peak “you think he’s put her in the catacombs, the place with all the bones and skulls?”
Sherlock raised one eyebrow, it was odd for John to want him to watch a movie "alright let me put on clothes"
John removed his slick fingers and wiped them on their sheets, hesitating to say anything. He cleared his throat awkwardly, “um, so, how do you want to do this?” he asked, and Sherlock looked back at him in confusion “What do you mean?”. John gently rubbed Sherlock’s back, “ Do you want to lay on your stomach, or on your knees… you could lay on your back, or ride me, or…” the doctor trailed off. “oh. Um, you pick, I was only ever allowed on my knees-so I don’t know.” Sherlock spoke shyly. John felt the familiar feeling of a sad anger rise in his chest, it usually happened whenever Sherlock disclosed details of his so called romance with Victor. “right, so not on your knees. Turn over, baby, I want to be able to look at you.” John said and Sherlock followed his request. John hovered above him, kissing him slowly and gently stroking his lovers cock “you’re so beautiful, Sherlock.” John ran his hands down Sherlock’s body until he reached his long legs and helped the detective place them over his shoulders. John looked intently at Sherlock’s face, it was obvious the younger man was nervous, but it was expected. John smiled softly at him and looked at him with nothing but love held in his eyes, “ready?” he whispered and Sherlock nodded. John took himself in hand and made sure to rub a generous amount of lubricant to his cock. He began slowly grazing the tip of his thick cock over Sherlock’s hole, he repeated the action several times before stilling at his lovers entrance. He looked down at Sherlock whose eyes were closed, John intent on watching his loves facial expressions. John slowly began to apply pressure and Sherlock was gripping the sheets between his fists and was holding his breath. Before John could even breech Sherlock’s ring Sherlock gasped sharply, “stop, stop, stop, please stop.” He pleaded, the words coming out quickly. John immediately pulled back and took Sherlock’s legs off his shoulders, backing away to give him some space.
John began to stir against Sherlock’s side and moved himself closer to the taller man, pulling Sherlock out of his thoughts. John gave Sherlock a small squeeze to let him know he was awake. “morning” Sherlock said, dropping a kiss to John’s hair and cuddling in closer to him. “what time is it?” John asked still not opening his eyes. “a few minutes after 7. I need to speak with Lestrade today about the case.” Sherlock replied and reached for his phone on the bedside table. As he began to sit up John’s arm tightened around him. “Don’t leave just yet, please,” John said as he finally opened his eyes and looked at his boyfriend. “I’m not,” Sherlock spoke softly as he rubbed John’s arm “I was just going to sit up.” John loosened his grip, allowing Sherlock to prop his back against the headboard, giving John the perfect opportunity to use Sherlock’s blanket covered lap as a resting place for his head. Sherlock smiled down at the action and let one of his hands come to rest in John’s hair as he texted Lestrade with the other.
Sherlock was drowsy and couldn't do much besides nod at what John was saying.
He sighed and gave and apologetic look to the nurse " when will he be able to go home"
No response.
The sentence hadn’t lingered in the air long before John was out of his seat, “No! don’t pull that. He has done plenty for you! He didn’t have to save you, he didn’t have to comfort you, visit you in the hospital, get you a private room and the best lawyer this world has to offer, he doesn’t owe you a damn thing.” John spat out the words in defense for his boyfriend. His throat felt like it swelled shut when he saw the young girl’s eyes fill with tears and she recoiled into Sherlock’s chair that now seemed to swallow her up. John knew what he said was harsh, and he knew how much of a dick he sounded like yelling at an abuse victim, and a recently kidnapped one at that, but none of what he said was false nor did he regret the words spoken.
John smiled even though Sherlock couldn’t see him and lifted Sherlock lower body off his lap. The detective moved up the bed and positioned himself on all fours. John shook his head and repositioned Sherlock onto his back as he peppered kisses over his body. “no darling, I want to see you.” He spoke softly as he laid his lover down. John kissed Sherlock’s neck, making sure to leave a small mark. He gently sucked each of his nipples and trailed his hands down Sherlock frame. The foil packets on the bedside caught his attention at the last second. “ do you want me to wear a condom? I know your clean I saw your test at the hospital, I am too.” John said, managing not to break the mood. Sherlock shook his head slightly, “ if we are both clean what the point?” he asked redundantly. Before John could interject Sherlock spoke up, “ I don’t care about the clean up afterwards.  I just want to feel you.”
It felt as if all eyes in the room fell on Lestrade who appeared to be in a trance, hanging on every word between Sherlock and the judge.
" well I'm done for now. If you need anything John just ring. Oh and you too sherlock." She smiled flirtatiously and handed John a small slip of paper.
" thanks, I think."
Sherlock knew-in theory- how one ‘rode’ their partner during sexual intercourse, but when faced with the prospect himself, he felt nervous. What if he messed it up? What if he did it wrong and John hated it? With a deep breath he placed his legs on either side of John’s hips, he began to grind back against John’s hard cock in an attempt to ease it into himself. The movement ended up being awkward and Sherlock was losing his arousal as he grew flustered about his shortcomings.

John’s eye closed for a long moment as he attempted to prepare himself for what Sherlock may say. He never knew about this.
“she is the sister of my ex-boyfriend.”
They moved Victor into a quiet room and Greg entered next with his paperwork and recording device. Another officer kept an eye on them through the soundproof glass.
I BEGAN THIS STORY 5 YEARS AGO (2015) and have recently picked it back up(2020). I would like to think my writing has grown significantly since then and would really like to encourage you to continue reading this story even if it seems subpar until chapter 16. Also, if you wish for me to go back and correct/ add more detail to previous chapters I am open to doing that. Thank you! Lots of love <3
“and he saved your life a few weeks ago?” she asked, referencing his previous bathtub comment.
" yes"
“John, I was looking at som- “Sherlock was cut short when John pulled him close and leaned up to kiss him tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s dark hair. John tossed his lovers phone onto one of the nearby chairs and walked Sherlock back to the bed before climbing on top him. One of his knees came to rest between Sherlock’s thighs and the detective couldn’t help but lean into the touch, moaning softly. They made out slowly, enjoying the moments they had to take in being with one another. When John’s hands began to not so subtly tug at the buttons on Sherlock’s white shirt the taller man reluctantly broke the kiss, “we do have things to get done today...” he trailed off and John sighed, rolling off of the detective. “later though.” Sherlock said with a wink and a final kiss to John’s lips.
" no, I'm good." He said kissing him deeply. " can we go to bed"
"Okay. Thank you John"
John nodded
Sherlock nodded " as soon as mycroft comes over to sign papers."
John faced the wall and waited to hear the water splash as Sherlock into the water. "Good?"
Sherlock adjusted his posture, his eyelids half closed from the stimulation he was putting on his prostate, “ I hope not.” He smirked as he took John back into his mouth. He continued riding his fingers until he felt the muscle loosen to a comfortable position. He stood up, ignoring the ache in his knees and began unbuttoning his white button-down. When he started to remove his black blazer John stopped him, “leave it on. You look so hot.” The detective straddled John’s hips, as the doctor helped support him as he moved into a comfortable position. He could feel John’s thick cock pressing along the crack of his arse. John trailed his hand from Sherlock’s collar bone down his chest to his simi-hard member and began stroking it at a steady pace. Sherlock lifted himself, reaching behind him to align John’s cock with his entrance and slowly began to sink down on it. He bent himself so that he was making quiet moans into the nape of John’s neck, occasionally nipping at the skin there. John’s hands held firmly to either side of Sherlock’s waist as he helped keep the movement going.
Sherlock smashed the cigarette into the crystal tray on the coffee table, the same one he had stolen from Buckingham palace. " don't play dumb, John. I've decided to testify against victor for all of a day and a half and you’re already starting to treat me different."
***********************************************
When they got into bed, neither of them could sleep. They couldn’t ignore the tension in the room. Sherlock was no longer crying and finally broke the silence, “are you angry with me?” he asked, his voice trembling. He couldn’t bear to turn over and look at the man lying next to him.
"Wake him and I will destroy you" Sherlock muttered before mycroft could even get a word out.
“ I knew you had thing for military men.” John said proudly
John threw his head back against the pillow, “oh my god… come here you gorgeous thing.” Sherlock crawled up and hovered over John who brought him into a hard, sloppy kiss. Before John could ask if Sherlock was okay and sure about that the detective interjected “I’m fine. please, put you cock down my throat.”  And with that he sunk back down, once again taking as much of John as he could. After a few more tries John finally pushed his hips upwards as Sherlock came down and felt his cock push past his mouth and into his porn worthy long throat. Sherlock gagged again but didn’t remove himself off of John’s length. John gently rolled his hips at a steady pace, watching himself disappear in Sherlock’s mouth. He made sure not to thrust too hard or hold his lovers head down out of pure animalistic desire. After several minutes Sherlock pulled off and caught up on his breathing as he stroked John once more in his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s eye twitched slightly, " I don't know what you’re taking about."
"Sorry, just came out." John said, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly
Sherlock called Lestrade and requested that he not tell Victor about where he was going or that this upcoming conversation ever happened. At first the detective inspector questioned him but eventually agreed.

“don’t thank me yet. My guide and I got attacked and we got separated, I’ve got no idea how to get us out of here. “he said very matter of factly, and he heard Emily actually huff out a breathy laugh.
“Victor Trevor raped and submitted me to acts of sexual torture throughout the majority of our relationship.” The room had already been quiet, but now it held an eerie silence. It was as if everyone had stopped breathing, only the lights hummed above him. His mouth felt unbearably dry, but he knew no amount of water would fix this feeling. “ the first time It happened I was sixteen. I was a virgin, had gone no further than kissing and the only person I have ever kissed was him. Not that any of this should matter but I’ve been informed it’s the kind of information that is often valued.” He paused and met the judges attentive stare, a silent beckon for him to continue. “ Victor called me one evening, his parents and Emily were gone. We were the only people in the house, everything seemed normal; we called in delivery and watched a movie. When it was finished…” his voice had begun to waver but he corrected it quickly, “ he said he heard a rumor about me. A rumor that I had been on a date with another boy from our class, I hadn’t of course. I denied it after every slap that landed on my face. He told me if I was going to act like a whore, I should be treated like one. I didn’t understand what was about to happen until I was pinned on the couch and he was removing my trousers and pants.” He thought he heard John swallow. He could see Emily staring at him with eyes that expressed sympathy, but more than anything they showed support. He didn’t want to look at his parents or John right now. “ He thrust into my body, unprepared, hard and fast. I screamed and begged and apologized in every language I knew. But he didn’t stop. It wasn’t finished until he was and he left me there on the floor of his living room, so he could shower and wash the blood off his penis.”
John made breakfast and sure enough Sherlock ate.
“um, thanks for the apology but it was a misunderstanding. Given Sherlock’s background, I would have reacted the same- in fact I nearly did when I first met Victor at New Scotland Yard. Well, Sherlock is…Sherlock. I don’t think he’s cut himself since we’ve been back home, he’s still meeting with and making bare minimum conversation with the therapist you sent over, and um well as you saw he’s a lot more at ease with letting people- well- me at least, be close to him.” John was rubbing the back of his neck, trying to ignore the fact he was telling Mycroft about their intimacy.
"Since when are you so concerned about my eating habits?! You never cared this much before!" Sherlock shot back icily.
"Fine" Sherlock replied as he sat up proceeded to straddle johns hips.
He climbed off of John and laid on his side, curled up close to him. John watched in amusement as Sherlock took his fingers into his mouth one at a time and cleaned their come off of them. “you don’t have to do that, you know? I can get a towel.” John said but made no effort to move. Sherlock’s cheeks flushed red once more, “I know, I just…like it.” Sherlock hesitated “does it bother you?” he asked shyly. John was quick to shake his head, “no, quite the opposite actually. I’ve not been with anyone whose genuinely liked that kind of thing, but watching you swallow my come in any way is extremely hot, baby.” Sherlock held John tighter against him and placed his head on his chest. John looked at the ropes and drops of seamen on his torso and hesitantly ran the tip on his finger through it. Sherlock watched with interest as John brought that finger to his mouth. Sherlock opened his mouth and took the digit in without a second thought, licking off the mixture of him and John. They repeated this a few more times until John’s skin was clean. “if I wasn’t so old and hadn’t come so hard, I could go again just from watching you do that.” John said, before they both broke into soft laughter.
“well, no. anyway, I was going to bring your tea earlier but I heard you talking to someone and figured I shou-“she continued on until Sherlock interjected, “ you heard me talking with someone? You did know someone was up here?”
As Sherlock lay in bed watching the clock over John’s shoulder, he couldn’t help but notice the minutes simultaneously seemed to drag and fly by. He wanted to soak up every minute he had to lay with John, but he wanted to get this case finished with.
" you should be stable now, you have rested and the bleeding stopped a while ago, want to come to tesco with me?"
"Only one in the world, I made up the job."
Lots of love,
“what kind of sick game are you trying to play with me?” Sherlock spat to his older brother.
"Fine"
Hello my sweet readers,
"You're jealous?"
When he awoke none of his stuff had been taken and he wasn’t injured…but Billy and the GPS were gone. His chest got tight and was nearing on a panic attack when he forced himself to breathe how John had taught him, and he squeezed his fist tight around the flashlight. He was lost and he knew it, there was no use in denying it. There was nothing in this maze of the dead that he could deduce to lead him back to the surface. He made the decision to continue looking for Emily and worry about their return later and if a few tears fell from his eyes no one but him would ever know.
“well…yeah. Sorry, I shouldn’t have brought it up. I know it was a while ago, but I’m sure-“
“sometimes, but I became very good at hiding them. If they ever pried too much about them, I would stop going to their houses.”
"Yes, sorry again."
Greg cleared his throat and looked to his friends, “ I spent a significant of time with Victor during the search for his sister, both as a budding friendship and an undercover investigation. I saw the plug Sherlock described in his testimony. I can confirm that Mr. Trevor is, without a doubt, a masochist and takes part in acts most humans wouldn’t care to indulge in.”
"Why does he need to sign papers? They never do that for a release when you already have someone to care for you?"
Stay safe and healthy. Lots of love...
“ we are not going to discuss your other claims at this time, but you have made very bold and serious accusations against Mr. Trevor, does revenge play any role in your participation in this case?”
"No. I mean I don't want to work on it anymore."
Just as Sherlock was about to dial Lestrade a thought crossed his mind, “John?” he asked, and John directed his attention towards him. “you trust me, right?” John’s lips quirked into a smile “of course I do.” He answered, wondering where this conversation was headed. “I’m worried that what I’m about to tell you and Lestrade will seem far-fetched and that word of it may get back to the wrong person. I really need you to support whatever I say and to help me reason with Lestrade…since people aren’t really my area.” John nodded, “you have my full support, promise.”
John chuckled “last night, you told Greg to take Victor to dinner, show him around- you know things all the goldfish like. You like when I take you out, so you’re a goldfish now too.” The doctor was so proud of his statement, but Sherlock wasn’t amused, or at least he wouldn’t let anyone know if he was. “I’m going to sleep John. Wake me when we land.”
They went to Angelo’s and took up residency in their normal booth. This time when Angelo danced around them and brought them a candle John didn’t put up any argument. They held each other’s hand over the table and the rest of the restaurant faded into a blur as they were lost in their own conversation. They walked hand in hand back from Angelo’s, taking in the night life of London. All their troubles seemed to be forgotten for now. They stumbled into 221b laughing and carefree for the first time in a while.
“No, John. Give your self some credit; work it out, tell me why I’m brilliant. Where is Emily Trevor. If you were going to kidnap someone, take them to France-specifically Paris- and leave them there to die, where would you take them,” Sherlock was looking intently at John with high expectations.
“me either. Harder, please.” Sherlock whimpered and who was John not to comply with the man in his lap. He thrust upwards to meet Sherlock’s bounces and soon the detective had his arms wrapped around John’s neck for support. “ come inside me.” Sherlock whispered in his ear, sending him over the edge. He had come inside of Sherlock before, but hearing that deep baritone voice ask for it did something for him. His hands gripped firmly on Sherlock’s bubble-like cheeks as he emptied himself inside his lover. As the last few drops were pushed into Sherlock, John felt hot ropes hit his own bare torso.
I would like to thank you all so much for reading this story. When I started it I had doubts that anyone would read it, let alone like it. It truly means the world to me knowing you enjoy my work and even benefit from reading it. Before I go on I would like you all to know that if you are struggling with issues of abuse or self harm etc. please seek help. Your life is so valuable and should be treated as if you are a precious gem. If you ever need anything or just someone to talk to please do not hesitate to contact me.

John nodded and came up with a plan in his mind."Thank you Mycroft, I wish that never happened to him."
“I was scared.”
He shook his head and whimpered "no"
"God damnit I'm just trying to help you." John said, growing frustrated.
John took sherlocks right hand and gave it a light squeeze, " please come to me next time"
“what?”
00000000000000000000000000000
John returned home from his busy day at the clinic and was greeted by the smell of tobacco as he entered the door. He furrowed his eyebrows together in genuine confusion as Sherlock hadn’t smoked in months. He made his way up the stairs and his eyes immediately fell on his lover, rested on the couch with his eyes closed and taking drags from a cigarette as if his life depended on it. “Sherlock…” John said with a neutral tone of voice, conscious of not trying to come off as angry or frustrated. The detective opened his eyes and glanced at john but made no comment. “Sherlock, what are you doing?” john walked over towards the couch and saw the butts of five or so other cigarettes laying in an ashtray “ my god, have you smoked all day?” his tone began to rise. “no, just the past hour or so…” Sherlock said factually. “an hour. You’re on your 6th cigarette in an hour?” john was baffled, the man who had been over half a year without smoking and barely using the patches had inhaled the smoke of six of the cancer sticks in an hour. To put it bluntly john was enraged. He bent over and took the cigarette out of his lovers’ mouth. Sherlocks eyes shot open “give it back John.” “no, you’ve had enough. What is the problem?!” john was now struggling to control his tone. “ none of your concern, give me back the cigarette” Sherlock demanded. “ it absolutely is my concern! On many different levels, as your friend, your boyfriend and a doctor, you are not getting it back!” john crushed the lit end of the butt into the ash tray smothering the flame. Sherlock let out a frustrated groan and went into his room, slamming the door behind him. John took a deep breath and made himself and Sherlock a cup of tea before walking to the detectives room and knocking at the door.
I hope you all have a fantastic week and that you enjoy this chapter! please let me know what you think! stay safe and healthy, lots of love...
Early the next morning John was dressed when Sherlock was just getting out of their bed. “where are you going?” his groggy morning voice questioned.
Sherlock woke long before John did, the blue light of the clock beamed 4:25 into the darkness of the room. It was too bright, the silence was too loud, his mind was too busy, his body was too hot with John’s strong frame pressed against him. It would be at least another two hours before John would begin to stir, maybe more considering how tired he seemed to be after the activities of last night. The detective inhaled deeply, trying to divert his thoughts to last night rather the impending trial that laid before him…but he couldn’t. He huffed in frustration and moved carefully from John’s side, trying not to wake him. The silk blue dressing gown hung on the bedpost and he slipped it over his shoulders before exiting the bedroom and walking to the sitting room. his briefcase sat on the table, mocking his exhaustion and electric thoughts that kept him in the state. He knew what he was going to have to do tomorrow, had rehearsed it in his head, everything about the case and the trail thus far was tucked away at the front of his mind palace, easy to reach and read through. Yet he felt drawn to open the case and read through all the files once more. Insecurity would be his downfall and he knew it, but he felt helpless to it. The details he planned to share would be more than sufficient to disgust any sane human being, certainly enough to have the entire courtroom-except maybe Victor- pitying him. it was what he and the lawyer had discussed. But what he arranged to share wasn’t the worst of the things that had happened to him, they were surface scratches of the hellish pit that lay below them.
As soon as Victor left Lestrade let out a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding in. ‘god what was he doing’ he thought as he continued to scan the small living room. Finally, a glimmer of hope caught his eye in the form of a passport. He made quick work of grabbing it and was shocked to see another one under it. He quickly opened the first one, which belonged to Victor and had been last stamped in the pattern of Gatwick airport, Charles de Gaulle airport, and then Gatwick again- all within a 24-hour time period. Greg committed the information to memory before picking up the next booklet belonging to…Emily Marie Trevor. Shit-the curly haired bastard was right about everything. Emily’s passport was stamped in Gatwick the same time as her brother’s and again at Charles de Gaulle, but there was no return stamp back to the UK. Greg heard Victor begin to climb the stairs and he hurriedly put everything back just as he had found it.
He didn't get a response but he knew not to expect it. Sherlock was emotionally drained, you could tell by looking in his eyes. He hasn't been sleeping well even with John by his side. His eyes had dark circles under them and any ordinary person could tell he was fighting to keep them open most of the time. He got up and walked to the bathroom before knocking on the door.
Sherlock fought not to roll his eyes, “ not photographed. I can point them out to you if you like” he said sarcastically, but nothing about it was amusing when the judge said yes.
“Yeah, well he’d understand.”
Emily smiled to herself and her voice rang with a playful tone, “so…who’s John?” she wanted so badly to teasingly poke the detective, but leaned on the side of caution not to. Their previous relationship had been filled with banter and sarcasm, but they had both changed. While Emily was still playful, she was unsure if Sherlock still possessed those qualities.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed in deep thought, his brain was far too active to try and narrow down a few pieces of evidence. His thoughts were interrupted as John came down the steps from his room, which was really a glorified walk in closet ever since he and Sherlock began sleeping together. “Harry called me a few minutes ago” John spoke as he made his way towards Sherlock. “She and her fiancé have apparently called off their engagement…” John sighed “Again.” He and Sherlock chimed in at the same time and gave each other a small smile. “yeah. So she’s wanting to meet up for coffee and I’m guessing talk about why it ended this time. We’re supposed to meet her near her place, that is if you don’t need me around right now.” John cupped his hand around the back of Sherlock’s head and kissed him. “It’s fine, need to go to my mind palace for a while anyway.” Sherlock stood and walked with John towards the stairwell before kissing him goodbye.
John and Sherlock were interrupted when the young man that found them approached Sherlock. “we are about to take Miss Trevor to the hospital; would you like to accompany her?” he asked, and John’s eyes went wide. “you found her?! Of course, you found her!” he said in excited disbelief as he pulled his boyfriend into another hug. “yes, I’ll go with her.” He replied and the young man handed the pair off to the paramedics. John and Sherlock sat hand in hand in the back of the ambulance. Emily let her eyes close on the drive over, obviously exhausted.

"I'm going to bed, try and get some sleep." He said leaning down to kiss the man before him.
He striped infront of his mirror and tried not to look. He put on loose pants and his favorite blue dressing gown. When he removed the bandage he understood why all the fuss was made. The cuts were deep and some had to be stitched over. Their was some that would still bleed at friction and touch, but not enough to cause any damage. And god did they itch like hell. He knew he couldn't touch them though, and that he should see his doctor if anything was wrong.
"Where's John"
Lestrade turned his head quickly looking up at Sherlock, silently begging for an explanation. “you trust me, don’t you?” Sherlock asked and the DI nodded, “you’re insane, and a complete git sometimes but yeah do; I mean I let you on crime scenes all the time and rare-“ Sherlock turned to the slightly shorter man, “No. I don’t mean about work. I mean as a person, as your…friend.” The consulting detective spoke delicately, slightly uncomfortable by the conversation he had started. Lestrade sighed, “yeah, I do.”
John pushed inside of his body without warning, a groan of pleasure falling from Sherlock’s lips as his hands flew up to grip John’s forearms out of surprise. “mine.” The older man huffed in extasy as he increased his speed, Sherlock velvety walls tightening around his body, slowly bringing him closer to the precipice. John observed the way Sherlock’s hands would tremble as his cock would expertly graze that sensitive bundle of nerves and when he saw Sherlock’s orgasm approaching, with all of his will power he pulled out. Sherlock’s previously hooded eyes shot wide open, “ fuck…what the fuck are you doing, John? Trying to kill me?”
" John"
"John, please don't. Not today"
" you need to eat today"
Sherlock moved his posture until he was in a position to have a decent amount of leverage, “ what should I do with my hands?” he asked shyly before John took his wrists and guided him to rest his palms on his chest. The vision of Sherlock above him and sat on his cock was what he imagined he would see at the gates of heaven. “god, you are what dreams are made of.” He mumbled and Sherlock began to slowly let his hips rise and fall.  John moaned loudly at the feeling of being encased by Sherlock. Sherlock continued to move slowly, as soft whimpers brushed past his lips. He was consumed with arousal as his own length beaded with precum, but he wanted more and could tell John did too.
Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed, “Really, I’ve just told you all of this and you’re concerned about my choice of vocabulary?”
When John came back, they took up their positions until it was time to go to bed. Sherlock got up leaving Johns lap feeling cold and empty.
Sherlock nodded " yes, you are the only reason I came back John, there are far more interesting things I could have done in the place I was but I didn't want to solve crimes and jump rooftops if I couldn't do it with you"
He looked down and laughed when he saw her number. Sherlock made a growl from his bed, " I want her killed"
John practically snarled in victor direction as the guard caught on to what was happening and moved him away. “John let it go.” Sherlock said with a soft hand placed to John’s wounded shoulder. The shorter man moved to put a firm hand on the back of the detective’s neck and pulled him down into a hard kiss. It was short lived but when John snuck his tongue between Sherlock’s lips the detective couldn’t help but gasp in surprise. The kiss was over as quickly as it had begun, and John was leading his boyfriend out of the courthouse. Sherlock smirked and leaned down, whispering “someone’s possessive today.”
" I want to hear it from you" John said taking a sip of water
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't 'cuddle'"
"You have an eating disorder as well, yes?"
"What am I dressing for?"
" it will only make him less likely to open up to you. I gotta head home. If you boys need anything call me"
"No we weren't-" they both started but stopped when Greg held up his hand.
“Thank you.” She said looking into his ocean blue eyes that were nearly covered by his pupil.
Reluctantly Sherlock budged from the sofa and sluggishly walked to the kitchen and handed John things from the fridge.
"You're perfect Sherlock." John spoke with sincerity.
After dinner and a short walk through the nearby park, the two men retreated back to their hotel. Sherlock had been texting with Billy to set up a meeting time and location for later in the night. He knew two hours after John fell asleep, he would be unconscious enough for him to sneak out unnoticed. Sherlock never thought there would come a time when he would make this kind of effort to have John not accompany him on a case. In many ways this case wasn’t any more dangerous than some of the others they had been on, but the feeling was different. It very much felt like something Sherlock needed to do on his own almost as if he had to prove something to himself- John being kept safe was just a bonus.
"Sherlock?" He repeated until the detective looked up and he patten the spot next to him, a silent command of 'please come sit with me'

John smiled fondly at the man resting in his lap. " of course"
“Care to share any of them with me?” Victor asked, adjusting in the chair.
"It's not your fault john, I would have found a way to do it anyway."

"Sweetheart, it's okay. We can deal with this, I'll be here for you through all of it. It's going to be okay."
If Sherlock hadn't felt ashamed before he did now. He was angry at him self for not noticing John was coming down and angry for being caught. He reached and sat the tooth brush back on the sink and slumped down against the toilet. John placed what was supposed to be a comforting hand on Sherlock shoulder but the detective shook it off.
Hi friends! I hope you all are doing well and that you really enjoy this chapter! Sorry for the longer break between chapters, its been a pretty hectic few days with finals coming up. Please feel free to leave feedback, it really fuels me to write more! Stay safe and healthy, lots of love <3
“they would pay Victor to have me perform oral sex on them.”
John’s chest felt tight with concern as he laid down next to Sherlock who still had his eyes closed and was breathing rapidly. John placed a hand on his chest and pressed himself to the tall man’s side, “it’s okay” he said kissing his cheek “you’re safe. I’m here.” Sherlock rolled onto his side and into John’s chest, throwing a leg over the doctor, “I’m so sorry” he sobbed and tears threatened to prick John’s eyes. “no, love. You have nothing to be sorry about. Nothing. Understand me?” John said kindly and pulled back to look at Sherlock who didn’t respond. “you did incredible. Baby, just the fact you wanted to…that’s a huge deal. I’m not upset, I’m not mad. I’m the opposite really, I’m so proud of you sweetheart.” John briefly acknowledged his overuse of pet names, but knew Sherlock loved them and subconsciously hoped they would make him feel better. John continued to whisper words of reassurance to his hurting lover, but Sherlock never responded to them. Their erections and sexual energy had subsided a while ago and they lay there holding one another until Sherlock finally broke the silence.
"I love you too"
“for you to keep doing that with your hands.” The detective said breathily as he began to slowly grind himself into John’s thigh.
"Never. You act like you are"
John moaned and kissed him once more, applying lube to his length and sliding it along the rim of Sherlock’s entrance. “ready?” he asked, and Sherlock nodded looking deep into John’s eyes. John slowly pressed against the pucker and Sherlock took a deep breath as it breached the ring. John was steadily sliding to into Sherlock’s heat. “mmmm Sherlock” he moaned as he reached the end of his length, bottoming out in his lover. Sherlock released the breath he forgot he had been holding, “John.” He sighed. John stayed still inside him, letting his body adjust to his considerable length. “you’re incredible, baby. So gorgeous.” He complimented and watched as Sherlock bit his lip. “move a bit, please.” Sherlock whispered and John began to move his hips back until he was almost out of Sherlock before rolling them forwards once again. He couldn’t help but moan Sherlock’s name over and over again, he was so tight and felt so good wrapped around John’s cock. John knew he was probably leaking precoma inside of Sherlock. It wasn’t long until John was thrusting in and out of Sherlock at a steady pace. Sherlock was whimpering in pleasure beneath him, making the most beautiful sounds John had ever heard. John wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s long, weeping cock and began to stroke him. Sherlock gasped and scraped his fingernails down John’s back, “oh god, John, mmm, fuck” he moaned, causing John to smirk. John kissed him, letting his tongue enter Sherlock’s mouth. “ John” Sherlock panted “I think I’m going to come soon.” His legs wrapped around John’s hips a little tighter. “me too, just let go, love.” John said as he increased his speed ever so slightly, making sure to hit Sherlock’s prostate with every thrust.
I wish nothing but the absolute best for you all. Know that today you are sat between a story you (hopefully) love and the woman you helped save.
"What are you doing"
John paid the bill and began pulling conversation topics out of thin air in attempts to keep the mood light, but Sherlock could only nod as he listened to bits a pieces. The walk back to their hotel was quiet, neither one of them able to fabricate any more conversation. As they approached their door John felt self-conscious knowing what awaited on the other side. Sherlock scanned the key card and they stepped inside and Sherlock’s eyes dilated. Tea light candles were placed around the room, a small bottle of what he knew to be high quality lube was placed on the bedside table along with a few condoms. There was a small white envelope with his name on it, carefully written in John’s best handwriting. John cleared his throat, “Sherlock…I’m sorry maybe this was too much and we don’t have to-” John’s stammered and unneeded apology was cut off by Sherlock grabbing him by the front of his shirt and kissing him passionately. “thank you” Sherlock whispered, breaking away from the kiss and leaning to kiss from John’s shoulder, up his neck to his ear, “take me, please.” John made a low moan and pulled Sherlock back to his mouth.
John grinned at how beautiful,raspy and deep Sherlock's morning voice was, " not long, did I wake you?"
"Wanna cuddle?"
They moved back into the living room and John helped Sherlock change his bandages. " they are looking better. Healing at least." John looked over sherlocks ivory arm that was scattered with long stripes varying in color. When John finished tying off the bandage he looked up and the side of his face was caught in Sherlock's hand as he pulled him in to kiss him. The Kiss was gentle at first but now it grew more passionate. Sherlock had moved John onto his back laying on the sofa and running his hand over Johns chest. Small moans came from the both of them at times. John pulled away with his hand gripping lightly a few buttons  on sherlocks baby blue shirt. " may I?" Sherlock nodded and placed a kiss to johns nose. The man beneath him slipped each button away and saw sherlocks pale chest exposed as he did so. When he reached the last one he ran his hand over Sherlock rib cage and he shuddered. "Is this okay?" John asked leaning up, pressing a kiss to sherlocks shoulder.  "Yes, John-I can't tell you how far I can go because I don't know."
“are you sure you can stand?”
John listened from the kitchen and smiled aimlessly down at the kettle remember how Sherlock said those exact words to him second time they had met.
"Are the two of you together."
Sherlock looked at her, eyes wide in surprise “you remember…you knew?”
The man above him cleared his throat uncomfortably, " sorry, it's just-"
"No I was very much enjoying it but listen." There were sound of feet coming up the steps and before either of them could move Greg stood in their doorway.
Sherlock fell asleep safe in the arms of the man he loved, and that loved him.
They moved upstairs and watched doctor who for a bit. John leaning in the corner of the sofa with Sherlocks head in his lap.
Greg had called Victor on the way there and he was quick to meet him at the station. Lestrade explained that he had to go check up on the same case as earlier and that John could answer any questions he had about the forms. Lestrade made quick work of leaving the station and making his way to Sherlock’s location.
"I wish not to say."
After retiring to the flat he took and shower and managed to calm his mind and nerves enough to function. His mind was still racing though and couldn't seem to stop. He reached in the fridge and grabbed a beer. He never drank but was desperate for some kind of release.
"Okay, what did I do to make you mad?" John asked.
"Thats a broad topic. What are you specifically wanting to know."
He remembers it vividly, like he does everything if he lets himself dwell. It should have been the last act too. It was only two months into their relationship, he was head over heels in love with the popular red haired boy that captivated everyone. Sherlock had made a snarky remark as he and Victor descended the stairs to their next class, they were alone in the stairwell when he smacked Sherlock across the face…before the dark haired boy could even register what happened Victor was apologizing profusely, cupping his face in his hands and kissing over the red mark. Sherlock forgave him. He forgave him that time, and the time after that, and so fourth.
"Oh, my apologies. I didn't know you all were together. God I feel so stupid, sherlock I didn't know that he was taken and especially not by you. I would have never- if I knew that-"
Inhibitions forgotten; John pushed Sherlock down onto the sofa. His hands tangled in the wild dark curls as he slotted his lips against his lovers. John tilted Sherlock’s chiseled jaw up and began pepping kisses along it, working his way to the pale skin of the detective’s neck. Sherlock was fumbling to unbutton John’s shirt, as he bit back little moans of pleasure. John was unfastening Sherlock’s belt when the detective heard whispered dirty talk of a mind-blowing blow job. But Sherlock had something else in mind. He stopped John’s assault on his neck and pulled him back up for a passion filled kiss. “go sit in your chair, i'll be right back.” Sherlock whispered as he gently motioned to push John off of him. The shorter man complied with a confused look on his face as he watched Sherlock fast walk up the stairs to their most recently shared bedroom.
Sherlock nodded and closed his eyes, trying to get a few minutes of sleep in during their short flight. He knew he wouldn’t be sleeping much in the upcoming days. Just as he started to drift off John broke the silence again.
The day passed with no significant events happening. They said goodnight as usual and retreated to their normal rooms. Sherlock had managed to avoid eating for the entire day without John noticing and he was grateful for that, it's not that he wanted to upset John, quite the opposite actually. He just honestly believed that if he gained anymore weight john wouldn't love him. He stepped onto the scale. Half a pound more than yesterday. Disappointment and shame came over him and he purged anything he could get out of his stomach.
Lestrade looked up, his eyes wide “oh for Christ’s sake, Sherlock” he started but then fell silent. “I can’t believe we are having this conversation- me and you.” he scoffed before continuing “yeah, I do. But It can’t and won’t happen, I know that. He’s guilty. no matter how badly I may not want him to be in the moment- I know he is. You’re right, it’s obvious he’s the one whose kidnapped her. I saw it for myself and still don’t want to believe it.” Lestrade and Sherlock both took a long drag from their cigarettes. “it won’t affect the case, I promise.” Lestrade spoke with conviction and Sherlock believed him. Lestrade may not be the world’s best detective inspector but he wasn’t one to compromise a case for personal gain. The DI let out a breathy laugh, “the one person I take a massive interest in for the first time in over five years is a criminal. He’s nice- well it’s fake obviously now but he puts on a good show- he’s charismatic, got a great sense of humor, and i’m sure you’d agree with me that he’s ruggedly handsome. Shit, why am I telling you this.”
"Mm Sherlock, I really do need to shower and go to bed"
“But you’re not straight.”
Just as John promised, they were back before dinner. John showered and was met by Sherlock sitting on the edge of their bed. The tall man took long strides, making his way to John who took him to his arms. Sherlock leaned down slightly so that their foreheads pressed together and a smile spread across his face, illuminating his eyes. “ John Watson…you are a bad man…and I love you.”
"I had no intention of waking him brother mine. I'm sure he needs the rest. He hadn't left once. You scared him sherlock"
DID YOU MISS ME? It's been 5 years since i've updated this fanfic and i am so excited to announce i am picking it back up again. If any of my original readers are here, hi and good to see you again! i hope my writing has improved since then and that you enjoy this story. Lots of love <3
Hurt came over Johns face and he look down at the table. " I'll go then. I'm sorry I'm such an inconvenience."
"Mmhm" Sherlock hummed quietly.
“Lestrade called this morning, he didn’t say anything about photographs.” Sherlock shot back, walking casually to the other side of the room to his desk.
John took a deep breath and walked down the steps.
"I'll be back with a towel okay?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"What do you want Sally"
"No, don't think so why?"
“Sherlock…that’s very…kind but I couldn’t imagine the toll being raped over and over again would have on someone.”
Victor didn’t bother waiting for a reply, he knew it would be taken care of.
" I know"
"Yeah, I didn't know it had been all night."
"Sherlock it's fine, I just wondered why you picked it since it was a romance movie." John said quickly in an attempt to reassure his friend.
Sherlock turned slightly to look at John, “ he’s not been allowed any outside influences since he became so involved with the case and is testifying as part of Scotland Yard. He most likely has no idea.”
" you alright? Want to stop?"
“Sherlock, will you lay on your front for me, love?” John asked sweetly “I want to try something.” Sherlock bit his bottom lip slightly and rolled over. John took a second to admire Sherlock’s gorgeous pale arsecheeks, massaging them slowly as he kissed down Sherlock’s spine. “lift your hips up for me, baby” John spoke softly as he began leaving small love bites on the pale mounds. Sherlock did as he was asked. “Is this okay?” John asked and Sherlock squeaked out a small ‘yes’ not totally sure what was about to happen. John spread Sherlock’s cheeks and flattened his tongue, licking a thick wet stripe over Sherlock’s little pink hole. Sherlock inhaled sharply letting out a high-pitched breath. John smiled and couldn’t help but giggle a bit at his lovers’ response, “you alright?” he asked. Sherlock’s face was flushed and buried into John’s pillow, the detective nodded, and John continued. Sherlock moaned and squirmed with arousal as John licked his hole. John make small wet strokes, long, light teasing ones, ones where he pointed his tongue and made circles over Sherlock pucker and carried this on for several minutes. “John, please.” Sherlock panted “please I need more.” Sherlock was practically humping the mattress for relief and John had taken himself in hand, unable to watch Sherlock this hot and malleable without giving himself some pleasure. “what do you want, baby?” John asked kissing the dimple at the end of Sherlock’s spine. Sherlock groaned obscenely at the pet name; he’d never let anyone know how much he loved when John called him those silly little names. “I don’t know, I just need more of you.” Sherlock panted. John moved his body to lay equal with Sherlock’s, giving the detective a few moments to compose himself. “Sherlock, I want you to answer me honestly, baby. Do you want to have sex tonight?” John asked, unknowingly holding his breath waiting for the answer. “I want to, but I don’t think I’m- I don’t- “ John saw Sherlock spiraling into his head and kissed him, taking him back out of it. “it’s fine. There is plenty more we can do, love.” John comforted him and Sherlock nodded. John held Sherlock’s cock in his hand and stroked it slowly up and down. Sherlock closed his eyes and held his bottom lip between his teeth , “god you’re gorgeous Sherlock. I can’t believe you’re mine.” John sped up his movement slightly, tugging at his own length at the same time.
"I'll wait until closer to bed."
Their shower was kept pretty short, sparing only extra time for lazy kisses and fond touches. Sherlock was out of his blissed out haze but falling into one of tiredness. He was trying to read on his phone, but John watched as his eyes would fall shut before quickly opening again. The doctor took the phone from Sherlock’s hand and plugged it into its charger on the beside table. He wrapped an arm around Sherlock who had already settled into his normal position of his head on John’s chest and one leg draped in between John’s. “ I love you, John.” Sherlock said clearly. John was sure the detective heard his heart skip a beat. Leave it to Sherlock Holmes to make the most generic name in the world sound special.
“all of the previously mentioned forms of torment, while repulsive, paled in comparison to a ‘sexual aid’ he had custom made.”
Sherlock nodded, “yes, you need to wait a while before you drink anymore though.” She nodded in understanding, but her eyes pleaded for more of the liquid.
“promise to show me when we get home?”
John hurriedly dressed, brushed his teeth and combed his hair before putting on his shoes and kissing Sherlock goodbye.

Sherlock just groaned but let John get up. When he left he couldn't help but notice how empty and cold the bed felt without him. When Sherlock was with John sleeping wasn't difficult or unpleasant, he enjoyed the closeness and how comfortable he felt being around John. Sherlock had never been a physical person, especially not after victor. He would shy away at the slightest brush against him of someone he didn't know. He would fear the person who was angry at him if they made a move that could end with him being touched, even if it wasn't violent. He even would be uncomfortable at times when ms.Hudson refused to stop holding his shoulders or placing a hand on his back while she spoke to him.
Mycroft laughed a little too loud and john stirred. Sherlock sent him a death stare. " oh brother, you aren't 'decent enough to have a relationship' you just got lucky"
The judge smacked her gavel loudly, “ Mr. Holmes I do apologize but given the current situation I am calling a recess.”
Mycroft nodded, “you’ve been good for him. What about his eating? I can see he’s filling back out again. He looks better, much less…skeletal.”
“and why should I grant you this gift?”
“he is, we already discussed it.” she laughed, making Sherlock roll his eyes at the trap he just walked into, “ Harry is even going to join us, that will be lovely wont it?”
"Once again he didn't mean to, come back and we can get back to where we were." He stretched his hand out to the taller man.
“I asked do you have any evidence?”
Moments later Sherlock was moaning John’s name loudly, as ropes of white shot onto his stomach and chest over John’s’ hand. Soon John was coming deep inside of Sherlock, filling him up. John went to pull out when Sherlock stopped him, “ stay, please, a little longer.” John hummed in response and readjusted their position so that he was spooning the taller man, his cock still buried in him. John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, petting his head “I love you.” He said sincerely with a kiss to his lovers’ neck. “I love you too.” Sherlock said hoarsely. “I’m so amazed by you.” John said into his neck.
Sherlock kissed him deeply. One hand behind johns head and the other feeling up and down his chest.
John received a text from Lestrade that he was ten minutes out from the Yard. “Lestrade is almost here, finish up.” He directed Victor and he quickly filled out the last few signature spaces in the document he was on. Victor stood and came far too close to John for the doctor’s liking, “You’re forgetting something John.” He stated and John looked at him confused. “Emotional leverage.” Victor clarified, “I know things about Sherlock, things that could destroy him from the inside out. I know what makes him tick. And I also know that he doesn’t like to talk about those things-in fact I’m a little bit surprised that you know. But I bet he wasn’t even the one who told you, I’m sure it was Mycroft. He always was intervening in everyone’s business. So, if it weren’t for him you wouldn’t have any reason not to trust me or even like me. I like you John, and if you’re not going to let me play with Sherlock-I’ll play with you instead, play with your heart. Or I guess I can start recounting all the intimate details of my relationship with Sherlock, the ones that make him look crazy. Even if I expose myself a little in those stories-I’m not afraid of jail time.” Victor hissed and just as John was about to fire back at him Lestrade walked in. Victor stepped out of John’s space and turned to Lestrade who was giving them both a look of confusion.
