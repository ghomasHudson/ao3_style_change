Steve thought about it.  He was closer to the base and had the ball in hand.  But he knew without twitching a muscle that Thor would win.
Tony shook his head, said, “Can’t wait for the

“Send me back,” Tony ordered.
“He’s done this before,” Tony lied.
Tony smirked before he could contain it, flattening his expression back to neutrality.  “We can change that,” Tony dismissed, turning back to the windshield.  Steve swiped the hat from his head and replaced it on his own.  “Doesn’t match the
“No, why would you?” Rhodey deadpanned.  They let go, then sized each other up.  “You’re trouble.  But you’re good at getting out of it.”
“Yes, you can,” Steve insisted, worming the rope into his grip, anyway.  “Now, hold onto it.”  He started to pry Tony’s hand loose.
“Sleeping on the job?”

“Strange.  I like being with me, too.”  Steve did not pinch his side, but he rolled his eyes before tugging Tony closer, turning onto his side to hug him.  “. . . Am I your teddy bear?”
.  He wanted to say it, but he was afraid to, afraid to shatter a fragile peace, so he creaked across the noisy floor, announcing his presence before he arrived, and pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head gently.
“Indeed,” was all Stovok said.
By some miracle of interior design, Tony landed not on the concrete floor but on an adjacent couch.  He sat up, dazed but unharmed, and watched Steve throttle the suit, attempting to decapitate it while it continued to hold down his legs.  Flopping down on his back, Tony bemoaned, “This is my punishment.  This is my cosmic

, he thought.
“But did you earn it?” Tony pressed.
Steve just picked up his half-finished sandwich and took another bite.
“You could,” Steve agreed.
“Well, hiya,” a stout woman in a straw hat greeted, leading a small, furry llama on a leash.  “I’m Linda.  Welcome to Little Bushel Alpaca Farm.”
“Swear to God, Barton, I will shave your head in your sleep.”
Tony made a sad little trumpet sound.  Bruce watched Thor drink intently, then, with sudden fear, asked, “Uh, is that—are you sure about—”
“No—I replaced my Bentley with a Corvette,” Natasha replied.  She tossed a set of keys into the air; Tony caught them, frowning severely.  “Race you to Chicago.”  Then Natasha turned the wheel, revving the engine.
. o .
He rested his head on Steve’s folded arms.  Steve lingered quietly, close enough Tony could hear Steve’s heart thumping along.  Finally, Tony dragged one of his hands loose to curl around Steve’s arm.
“No, you said don’t do anything to it.  Ah,” Tony acknowledged, pointing at him.  “That’s fair, but I’ll let that slide.”
“No, I’m full of good ideas,” Tony said, plucking another off the tray.  “Cheers.”
“My family jewels are worth three-point-eight billion dollars,” Tony said.  “Could be a lot worse.”
Tony said, “Yes.”
“You turned yourself in.”  It was a guess, maybe even a dangerous one.
Letting his eyelids slide shut, leaving his hand where it was, Tony dared to believe that maybe, just maybe, they could be a family, after all.
The defense would not hold up well.
Clint released him.  “You’re—not, Natasha,” he said.
“Almost makes you sad, doesn’t it,” Steve said, leaning on the railing with folded arms.
“Not a bad intuition,” Steve allotted, glancing at the card, memorizing the number, and offering it back.  Hill wordlessly took it.  “As you were.  Commander.”
“Guess who’s back on the range?” Tony announced, unlocking the hotel room door with a sliding card.
There was a long pause.  “Who are you?” replied the disembodied voice.
Tony had banished the others except for Bruce, who was curled up on a cot, exhausted.  Steve envied him.  “You should get some rest,” he told Tony idly, his own voice scratchy with would-be sleep.  “It’s late.”
made it to Australia and back in one piece.  Who was Steve to question the almighty Navigator on his journey?
Steve waited with him, looking after Bruce and Thor.  “Nobody’s gonna believe any of this,” he mused aloud.
Steve could stand on the shores of the Atlantic on a clear night and look up at the night sky to see scattered points of light.  In every city, there were traces, gatherings, smatterings of stars—hints of a feast for the eyes, but nothing so clear as to wow the imagination.  Even in Steve’s time, there was a longing for what was lost: celestial light.

“I have been told I make a lot of enemies,” Stovok responded dryly.

To Steve’s relief, the whole experience proved decidedly less thrilling than piloting the

Then the door slid open.

Even Tony—who had no lost-love for Captain America, prim-and-proper your-mother-bakes-
Steve did not lift the hood covering his face, but he did huff, “Remarkable,” to himself.
“A fucking
Half the nest was gone: only green Thallium, bronze Tellurium, indigo Indium, blue Actinium, red Curium, and yellow Radon-2 remained.
Steve gripped him by the neck again, more gently, and gave him a cajoling shake.  He did not know what he wanted to say with it, other than
“Your lips are blue,” Stovok said.
Stovok’s boots disappeared.  Tony thought,
“. . . What?”
When time was young, the seeds of celestial life had been cast far and wide, along with the ever-expanding universe.  Over the coming eons, life would reach out to itself, reconnecting and crosspollinating, occasionally reimagining itself.  Life would expand in order to prevail over every extinction.  Life would boldly seek out its own kind, yearning to experience the things that could not be encapsulated in words.  No matter its quarrels with itself, life would persist by sheer number: no war could eradicate every last member, every tiny seedling from existence.  There would, somewhere, somehow, remain an untouched corner of the Universe.
“Not so worried about first contact?” Tony asked Stovok, resisting the urge to double over and gasp for breath.  He wasn’t twenty anymore, and these uphill climbs were hell on the knees.
Again, Stovok stood before a council, in a very different setting.
In a good mood, he opened the box—and discovered a blueberry muffin.  He broke off a piece and offered it to Bruce, who stared at him for a moment like he had just invented fire, then took the piece of muffin with a shy nod and ate it.
Bruce asked tentatively, “What does that—” and stopped.
“Merry Christmas, huh?” Steve said, Brooklyn accent strong in the morning.
“Wow,” was all Bruce said.
“A mythi—creature of some renown,” Stovok said.
“Stark Industries built his legs,” Tony said cheerfully.  “No freeze-ups at 29,000 feet.  Same tech I used in the Mark III.”
Then the Hulk grumbled loudly and Tony and Steve both looked up in time to see him stand and lumber over to Thor, who was attempting to shake more water out of the hose.  “You got a couple dollars?” Tony asked, exactly like he had ten minutes prior.
Steve resumed sketching.
Thor released him, and with gutting swiftness, Steve slipped, unanchored, back into the frothing maelstrom.  He had no time to think before the god of thunder swept under him, nimble as a seal, and rocketed skyward.
Tony was not impressed: “. . . You replaced my
For a moment, he had no words.  He wanted to say,
Steve’s look flattened.  “Oh, don’t give me that,” Tony said.  “Stop it,” he insisted, nudging Steve’s hip with his foot as Steve sipped his shake.  “I was being

According to a placard near the water, more than five thousand intrepid and unsuspecting souls had taken the plunge over the river’s edge.  Of them, just sixteen had survived.
“Not without you.”  Another step closer.  The light dimmed noticeably.  “You have so much to live for, Tony.  You have a family.”
6:35 P.M.
To his surprise, Tony pressed against him, in the briefest and most indecisive of hugs, more inconsequential lean than true embrace.  “Keep it together,” Tony recommended, but Steve could not express how grand the idea was, that the future had gotten
But Steve could not say he disliked it.  No—not dislike at all.
With a shake of his head, Steve said, “Night, gang,” and left.
“Take it off.”
, Tony thought absentmindedly, as Thallium finished her ice cream,
Tony waved him off.  Steve asked Thor, “Where’d you get that?”
Tony turned around in his seat and snatched the newspaper from Clint, then cracked it open and glared at it like it had insulted his cardigan.  “It’s Portland,” he said with finality.
Steve, he would gladly have waited in the car, or even gone hungry for a month, if it meant not looking into their sincere brown eyes.  He was almost grateful when one spat in his face; his food ought to hate him for making it into food, he thought, wiping the spit off with the back of his hand.
Bruce gave him a wary look, but he led them down a long, dark hallway, pausing midway in front of a glass case.
Turning, Steve regarded the Vision.  “Death always seemed a strange thing to memorialize,” the Vision explained, stepping closer.  “Like . . . treading water.  Is it not weight, to carry them?”
One notable absence in the early lineup is the Sports Utility Vehicle, or SUV. The World War II
“No,” Clint objected from the table.  “No shellfish.”
“Me, next,” Clint chimed in, bouncing along out front.  Clint Barton belonged in a circus—the man who would not expire.  There was an honest-to-God
Stovok gave him a very unimpressed look, even for a half-Vulcan.  Then he slithered into the hole in the ground.  Stupid Vulcan.  Fearless bastards.  It was no surprise that Stovok had excelled in Starfleet—he was born to be excellent.
Neither suit nor man acknowledged him.
“Beg pardon?” Steve said slowly.
. o .
Steve half-expected Tony to flop backwards in a dead faint.
, Steve thought, turning to face it head-on, barely gasping with alarm when Thor reached out automatically to touch the small, pointy head, gripping Thor’s arm to stop him.  “Don’t touch,” he managed.
his response, his cooperation—but it was the cold, hard truth, beating under his mutilated breastbone.
Hello again, weary travelers! Where to next? I can tell you one thing: westward ho!
Then they were gone.  Stovok waited a full ten minutes before letting go, sitting upright.  Tony joined him, staring in horror at the green covering his hand.  Stovok saw his gaze, looked down, and shrugged a shoulder, baring his teeth briefly in a grimace.  “It will heal,” he assured.
He got a little caught up in the minutiae, he was not proud to admit, arguing the
“God, it’s pretty,” Tony said, not listening to him.  “Isn’t it pretty?”
Steve sighed through his nose.
“No, that’s stupid,” Tony said.

“What, are you in trouble?  What’s wrong with you?  Where are you?” Tony demanded, more freaked out by the static than the incomprehensible jabber that could have been either
Stovok nodded once before laying both his palms on the elder’s shoulders.  For a moment, the two of them seemed almost timeless, the Vulcan—the first intelligent species to be encountered in space by willful Terrans, who would go on to discover thousands more in their endless voyages, alongside countless species on their own quests—and the Nibiran, virtually untouched by the Federation’s actions.

Steve looked at him so flatly Tony added: “Not my best work.”
Tony rolled his eyes, then grunted as Rhodes elbowed him.  “
Tony drew in a shallow breath, entire body still tense with discomfort.  He seemed deeply uncomfortable.  So much of his chest was still exposed, open to the air.  Compared to the rest of his armor, the reactor
Tony did not break eye contact with the car.  “Hundred-and-eighteen miles a gallon.”
He awoke to Bruce, disheveled as ever with his tired raccoon eyes, unfolding an honest-to-God
Surprised, Tony said, “What about—” and stopped himself from adding,
It was only Thor’s muffled speech that told him he was in danger.
Steve’s heart picked up.  “They got rid of polio?” he repeated, unable to keep a relieved edge out of his voice.
Tony searched for days for Radon the Second, who had also vanished in the night.  Unlike Curium and Iodine, R2D2 had not resurfaced.

It was almost soft,
“Where the hell did you learn how to drive?” Steve asked, after they had crossed a grassy meridian, driven for a harrowing stretch of time across the opposing lane, and finally swerved back into the correct side of the road, all apparently on a whim.
One aptly summarized: “Oh my God, there’s somebody in the water!”
Hulk grunted again, slightly louder than before.  Clint, who had miraculously stolen the hose from Thor, foamed him up in a rainbow-colored soap, designed, Steve surmised, for cleaning cars.  The Hulk made an agreeable humming sound.  Thor, also covered in the blue-purple-pink wash, laughed heartily.
and pushed downward exactly as far as his Tony had shown him.  The reactor pressed against his palm.  Even knowing it wasn't embedded into Tony's flesh did nothing to allay his fears; that was
“Fine,” Steve snapped, more out of irritation than remorse.  “I’m sorry.”
Good man, Steve thought, a strange ache in his chest that wanted to be grief suppressed by force of will.  Colonel Phillips was not part of the future, but that did not mean—
Rico had always been Tony’s cat.  And Steve—was happy for them.
Tony looked down at the half-Vulcan, half-Terran on his floor.  Erase the pointed ears, and he looked human.  But his tone was all Vulcan as he said, “It was a contact my people did not reciprocate.  But my mother . . . she welcomed the convergence.”
With a mute look of annoyance at the demeaning nature of the summons, Steve nevertheless paused before the telescope, wondering if this was how Galileo felt, once, before pressing the rounded glass to his eye.  Then he leaned down and looked up.

in 2012. I do apologize for ruining your immersion.
Tony answered it with, “You have five seconds,” and then frowned.  He held out the telephone to Steve.
The Nibirans prostrated themselves.  Tony blinked in surprise, looking around.  Even the Nibirans who had joined Stovok on his quest had fallen to their knees and pressed their arms to the ground.  Tony itched with sudden discomfort.  Stovok made an uncertain noise, almost a hum, and the elder unfolded himself, rising and stepping forward, hand extended.  He pressed his palm flat against Stovok’s chest, and said in a gravelly approximately of the word, “
Little Bushel Alpaca Farm was home to more than fifty alpacas.  “Started with three.  Kept growin’ from there,” Linda explained.  “Been in business since 2004.”
Ignoring the suggestion, Steve inhaled, pulled the shirt over his head, and exhaled carefully.  The seams held.  Barely.  “It’s okay,” he announced grimly.
. o .
Tony snarled mutely in rage, trying to form words, to think of anything to spit at the monster that would hurt half as much as his own bleeding wounds.  He wanted to tear the flesh from the backs of those so convinced they could save him if he let them, to hurt them enough they would hesitate to touch him.
Located just under 100 lightyears away from Home World, Sweet Home World,
To Steve’s relief, Tony let out a raucous laugh, easing some of the doubt coiled in Steve’s shoulders.
“How did you find us?” Commander Stovok asked, like he was asking for a mission report about a vague world he had never been to, and not the fate of his own life.
Thor frowned at him.  “Would I leave such a companion behind?” he replied.
Hungry.  Cold.  (Cold.
“He really is a hippy,” Tony mused, presiding over the abandoned booth a little longer.
Missed you beautiful folks! I have been busy with *my* folks. Now that things are back to normal, I'm happy to come back to this fic!

like a warm spot by a roaring fire.
Steve approached the green monster and held out his arms in a peaceful gesture.  “See?  I’m right here.”
Humming, Tony said, “I know a better place.  They got music.  Blues.  Not my thing.  But I’m kind of falling asleep here.  Walk with me.”  And he got up without another word.
“Honestly, poor fella hasn’t had a bath since we deloused the city,” Tony mused.  “Must feel pretty great to wash off.”
Tony shuddered.  “The frightening thing is, I know you’re serious.”
when he was that close—no, Bruce, with scarcely a smile in Tony's direction, unfolded his sleeping bag on the floor, lied down, and joined his family in rest.  Tony didn’t know where Thor was, but it seemed all right that he was away, that someone was on watch.
Steve could not answer that honestly.  The Vision went on, “Yet it feels . . . comforting.  Ancestral, perhaps.  I do not have a blood family.  It is difficult for me to . . . articulate, the idea of family.”
“Well.  It still hurts,” Steve reminded politely.
—”  With a full body shudder, Tony turned back down the road.
Tony continued snoring softly into the bedcovers, one arm wrapped around a pillow, covering most of the blue light emanating from his chest.  “Tony,” Steve repeated, tapping his leg.  “C’mon.  Time to get up.”
“She believed in higher things,” Stovok said at last.  “In . . . life.  Persevering.”  He looked back at the ceiling, lost in thought.
A shy cat would have fled.  But Rico stayed right where he was as Tony screamed in grief:  Rico’s purring drowned out by his companion’s mourning.

Tony sat on a bench outside the bar, hunched forward against the tremulating cold.  He looked more like a hitchhiker than a tech mogul.  A very ostensibly popular man, utterly alone in the world.
“Tch.  Do
Equal parts disturbed and comforted by the offer, he looked up as Tony returned, still grimacing and holding a hand to his head.  “No ice,” he said dismally.  “You’d think, for this kind of price point—anyway.  Take a walk with me?” he asked.

He seemed surprised.  And unharmed.  Tony released a breath he had been holding.
Natasha looked at him expectantly.  “Can you?”
Click-click.  Click-
It was like slow-motion wrestling, gripping onto rubbery shoulders, staring into sparkling eyes, straining to move his adversaries even a single centimeter in any direction.  Despite their lack of outward lethality, they were surprisingly strong, and when one wrapped its big reptilian arms around him and hoisted him in the air, he felt helpless to stop it.
“Blast-off,” Barton said, and kicked the transport into high gear.
Steve, though—Steve was cold.
Steve gave him a stern look.  Might have been more menacing if he was not still a little blotchy in the face, wet of the eye.  Ick.  Poet, thine name was not Anthony Edward.  Waiting until Steve’s back was turned, Tony creaked back to his feet.  “Sit.  Down,” Steve ordered.
“You should.”

“His name is Smokey,” Thor corrected, tilting his outlandishly small plastic guitar to maximize his performance as a truly ear-splitting number erupted from the television.  Steve could not believe the lack of noise complaints.
Tellurium remained where she was, looking out at the sea, but Thallium hopped up onto the couch and slipped under Tony’s new cotton wing, huddling close to his chest.

With meaningful dismissal, Steve took a seat on the couch, staring Hill down but no longer actively bearing down on her.  Natasha joined him on the couch.  Steve wanted to snarl at her, to demand to know why she could not choose a side, but he kept himself in check.  He had a good rep—he needed to keep it.  He drew in another deep breath and let it out slowly.
“Seventy years and they haven’t solved shrinkage?” Steve asked.
Clint landed with a very wet thump on the grass.
as Steve went on and on about Being Brave and Overcoming Adversity or something he definitely had a videotaped equivalent for, choosing instead to huddle like a petrified hedgehog against his shoulder.  “Tony—”
Rhodey grimaced, but he pulled Tony into a one-armed hug, anyway.
Steve took it.
A long moment passed between them.

Weakly, Steve acknowledged, “I know.”  He let go.  A moment later, Tony did, too, stepping back.  “I have to—”  He struggled to voice the words, suddenly unsure.  “I have to tell him.”
“What’s your point?” Steve asked bluntly, unwilling to acknowledge how close to truth he was.  Bucky might as well have been blood; his family had always been small and precious, and there was nothing he would not do for it.
Tony stepped up to plate, scooping up the bat and pulling another tennis ball out of his pocket.  “You can keep that, Thor,” Tony advised.  Thor pocketed his prize, looking very pleased.  “As for the rest of you losers—”
Somewhat mollified, Tony reached for the cards.  Natasha swiped them up first.
Bruce leaned his chin on his own shoulder and shut his eyes, feigning sleep.

“No, absolutely not,” Bruce murmured.
“So you’ll be—”

“Ohhh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of a little puppy dog,” Steve drawled, laughing at the realization as soon as the words left his mouth.  Tony tried shushing him, but Steve just laughed, unable to help himself, a little giddy and more than a little amused at the notion of the great

It was a strange moment—the future’s answer to Einstein, the reimagined Olympian, and the turn-of-the-century Brooklynite, all standing in the footpath—broken by Thor’s solemn declaration: “No mortal would last a night in the High Mountains.”
“Half were bonded, half were TNNs—‘tame no-names.’  The bonded ones were the problem.  TNNs will work for food.  Bonded dragons are completely unpredictable.  Some were good-natured and taken advantage of, others were playing a long game, playing it soft.  In the end, it doesn’t matter who starts it.  Once the structure breaks down, you gotta decide who to kill.  It ain’t always the dragon, either.
“Vættr*,” Thor corrected.  “It has . . . a complex translation.  I should need many hours to convey it,” he added apologetically.  “It is . . . like ‘soul.’”
“Knock it off,” Steve ordered.  Clint loped back to the car.
“Can confirm,” Tony said, already snooping through the backpack in Steve’s arms, ignoring his frown.
“If it’s any trouble,” Steve started, but between Thor’s genuinely delighted smile and the employee’s quick,
Once upon a time, fresh air had been the cure for all ails, and hospitals had been built around windows.  The ongoing presence of greenhouses, the better part of a century into the ever-mechanizing future, comforted him.
Thor inclined his head—“As you were, Captain”—and took off after Clint.  Clint yelped and fled, unwittingly leading the god along with the tennis ball in hand.
A game of chicken, it was.  “Can’t make cookies without eggs,” Tony said, nudging the eggs closer still, inviting,

“Hiding is for prey,” Thor dismissed.  “I am no prey.”

“Tony,” Steve pleaded.  “Just follow the rope.  The rope,” he added, closing Tony’s hand around it more tightly.  “You made it in.  You can make it back out.”
Too pleased to have another human up and about to complain about the company, Steve started to pace.  Tony told him, “No,” and Steve paused.  “You do that, I’ll throw up.”
Steve asked, “S’okay if I hug you?”
Tony said, “With you?” and only grumbled under his breath as Carter stepped further into the room, peering into the washroom like she expected to find a Vulcan hiding behind a shower door.  “I thought he was on the bridge,” Tony added.  “You try the rec room?  Got a mean arm for pool.”
Suddenly inspired, Steve reached into a pocket with a shaking hand—his hands shook more often than he cared to admit, a small, unimportant thing—and produced a small, wet journal.  He pulled out a pencil and quickly sketched the group, mere transparent outlines.  Thor, exulting in the open, yet lost in the mist; Tony, looking down from above, wanting and distracted; Clint, closest to the cascade, one hand outstretched to feel the spray; and Bruce, hugging Clint’s back, as if they were in some danger of going over at any moment.
Then Tony said blankly, “Son of a bitch,” and hurried over to the water, telephone in hand.
“You have returned my prize to me!  Truly, you are a worthy courier.”
Steve set the pot in front of Tony.  “Drink it.  It’s good for you.”
Steve reclaimed his spot in the car, shutting the door to protect himself from a god with a hose.
Clint leaped right over the seat median, declaring cheerfully, “I’ll have you know, I was a champion car surfer.”
Had it happened in isolation, Tony Stark would not have survived.  Humans had never survived for long in isolation; from the dawn of time, they had dragged their brethren uphill, against mortal odds, until their mortal wounds closed over, leaving recorded scars behind.  A human fossil record recounted these sobering tales of joint survival.  Tony could bitterly add his own survival story to the scientific ledger as proof that humans could endure anything, so long as that endurance did not occur in terrible isolation.
“Couldn’t imagine a better guy,” he said, when Tony asked him, from the relative privacy of the outdoors, what he thought about the match.  “He’ll know how to handle her.  They’re easy when they’re small.”  He smiled, then rubbed the underside of his chin absentmindedly.
“A sister world,” Tony said.  “Stovok, we found a sister world.”
There was a hush on the sheet near him, and then a warm hand slid under his own.  His cold, twitching fingers gripped it.  His breath hitched and shuddered, and he held on as tightly as he could, grateful for the anchor.  He was not alone in space, this sterile, awful space.  He breathed as shallowly as he dared, feeling the plastic under his nose, grateful it was not down his throat—he would have rioted if they had

Drawing in one last shallow breath, Tony said aloud, “Long Live Kevin,” and clasped Steve’s hand.
“Oh, no, we couldn’t,” Steve insisted, still holding onto his pies.
It thrilled part of him, every time the polar bear lumbered past the viewing area.
“OK, pal,” he said, his voice never rising, his heart only throbbing in his own chest.  “I won’t.”
Huffing softly, Steve said, “Yeah, I’m gonna tell the pig snatcher about the largest
Finally, he stepped forward.  Tony shifted his weight, intending to help rope up Marker, but Steve moved past them.  Tony opened his mouth to call after him, but Steve simply moved to Snow.  She dropped a shoulder for him, and in a streak of white, they disappeared into the sky.

Thor had the decency to wait until Tony had arrived at third base.  “Swing for the fences,” Tony advised him.
Tony strained to put the puzzle back together, but the pieces refused to connect.  There was nothing there—only the strong negation, the feeling that what they were doing was off-the-record and needed to stay that way.

There was a profound pause.  “Done, sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. replied.
For the first time since Marker’s disappearance, he let himself sob, let the anguish burst out of his chest.
“Twenty-six.  Hey, same as you,” Tony said, ribbing Steve and balancing his checkbook on a barrel.  “Bruce, you want anything?”  Bruce backed away from the nearest shelf so hastily he bumped into the next-nearest shelf rather violently.  “All right, just the pies and the bird.”

Finally, he stood, intending to leave him be, let him recover in peace.  But Tony rasped, “You lied.”
“No,” Rhodey told him, pushing him gently back by the shoulders, and that was when Tony saw him—Steven Grant Rogers.  He was wearing one of the quantum suits.
Tony glared at him for a moment longer, then twisted his shirt, released it.  “I will shave your head in your sleep,” he threatened.

“Anthony Stark.”  Mayor Cuff had a voice fit for radio, and a smile that could win an election in a landslide.  “I was beginning to think you would not show.”
“I worry about what comes to pass,” Stovok dismissed, looking around.  “Insofar—we remain undetected.”
Heart pounding in his ears, Tony finally gave in and shouted, “STEVE!”
He followed.
“I always thought you’d be a coffee guy,” Steve acknowledged Tony.  They were seated a short distance away, at a bar.
“If we’re going to die,” Tony repeated, “you might as well tell me.”
Steve paused.  Tony had the terrifically vivid sense-memory of a broom head snapping in half where his wrist connected to his hand.  “Don’t touch it.  You do not
Sneering, Tony turned away, flopping back towards the window, the rain.  Steve said politely, “It’s a good name.”  Rico sniffed around Tony’s back.  Steve moved forward to reclaim the cat.

Thor brightened.
“You’re insane,” Steve replied.  “I’m here to rescue you.”
He stepped forward, and Steve grabbed him by the back of the shirt.  Snow had her head up, those very lethal horns and soulless black eyes aimed in the same direction.  Tony felt nothing.
“Hey, hey, hey.”  Rogers gathered him close, heedless of the wires and tubes, tucking him up like he was a child who needed to be held, or a struggling animal who needed to be restrained, or a human in

Having learned absolutely nothing from the experience, Tony chucked his other shoe at Steve.  Steve repeated the toss.
“If we had known we would have guests, we would have timed our meal accordingly,” Anij said, speaking mostly to Stovok and Romanova.

Self-satisfied, Marker wagged his head in amusement, then lowered it to the floor.

Hey, you. 🐼❤️ I have all the excuses for the slight delay in updating, but also, I present none of them, because I'd much rather just get back to this beautiful story and have a great time together, and you all have been really lovely about understanding that sometimes, life is just hard.

With a sigh through his nose, Steve conceded with a nod.
“. . . He seems like a nice man,” Stovok said at last.  “You should be kind to him.”
The cold water sensation of being teleported awoke Tony from a light doze.
“I don’t doubt you.”
Steve wondered, patting the cat once on the head.  Golden eyes looked up at him, and it occurred to him that the resemblance was uncanny.

Tony nodded slightly in understanding, but Stovok looked disturbed.  It took a great deal of strength for Tony not to tap Stovok’s foot with his own, a wordless query.  Vulcans were very proper, especially in foreign company.  Even among friends, they were hardly considered effervescent people.  Stovok would likely retreat as far inward as need be to impress that he was not affected at all.  So Tony willed himself to be patient and ask questions

Another laugh bubbled out of Tony.  He shook his head, frantically trying to suppress the giggles, only half-succeeding as he coughed and said, “Right.  Right, no kissing on Vulcan.  You’re missing out.”
He stroked the blue light once, phantom pain fanning out across his sternum, tortured muscles tightening in red-hot remembered pain.  He lifted his hand away, trying to stuff it all back into the very small box it had fit in neatly, once, before the years went by and he stopped feeling all sorts of dead inside.  It was dangerous to go too near that box.  If he could simply erase that box from existence, he would.
“Negative,” Stovok agreed.  “We were focused on the mission.  Contact Starfleet.  Of which, the U.S.S.

Maybe Tony was stark raving mad and Clint was little better and Bruce, alone, chose to go along for the ride—but Steve chose to walk back.
From the decapitated suit, his own voice played back defiantly: “
By morning, Tony felt like he had spent another year in the desert.
Rocked by the simple truth of it, Tony said, “That is terribly close to profound, Steven.”
“No, he has a phone, which has geolocating capabilities,” Tony corrected.
“Why do you ask?” Clint asked.  Then, coming to his own conclusions: “Ah.”

anything, but he had no idea how to fix this.  “Is there a doctor?” he shouted, but it came out like a thin cry, like he was a ninety-pound asthmatic again.  His hands were hovering over Tony Stark’s chest, and he knew that every second was another second behind death’s door, a door that would never open if he didn't pry it open—
Shaking his head wordlessly in wonder, Tony stepped out of the stone-walled home without waiting for further discussion.  All he could think was,
“There are six hundred cars here,” Steve reminded.  “We have seen five of them.”
Tony found himself crouching and holding out a closed fist for her to sniff.
They were allowed a full hour in the well-guarded restaurant before Steve’s handler barged in.  Steve already knew why, but he feigned indifference as he listened to them reiterate the itinerary.  When he noticed the literal beads of sweat on the handler’s brow, he caved with a polite, “Give me a minute.”  The handler bowed and fled before Steve could change his mind.  Steve sighed, looked at Sam apologetically, and said, “Duty calls.”
“You could,” Steve agreed.

And a place that called to them was one worth investigating, indeed.
Tony did not know how long he fought the Gorn.  But he felt Stovok’s hand on his shirt, dragging him abruptly away from three of the Gorn and clunk-clunk
“You could,” Steve agreed easily.  “And if you do, I will let Barton be your wake-up call.”
“Painful oversimplification,” Tony said.  “
Tony looked at him flatly.  “Yes, Steve,” he said, before looking out at the field.  “It’s Socrates.  Means ‘get off my back.’”
Stovok’s expression went flat, the dark green tint on his cheekbones creating a rather comical effect.  “I will wrongly assume you did not consume it.”

That was what made Chicago beautiful: he did not know every street corner like the back of his hand, nor did he hear familiar voices in familiar landmarks or look for worn footpaths in fresh blocks of cement.
Tony held up a thumbs-up.  Bruce swallowed and turned back to face his opponents.  Clint was jogging in the outfield.  Thor and Natasha were immobile on the two bases.
Tony said nothing, staring at the cat.  Steve could see the multitude of emotions spinning behind those genius eyes, even as Tony’s jaw firmed quickly in unmistakable scorn.  “
Grimly, Steve said, “I thought you said you didn’t look.”
“I could.”
He could understand Tony’s surprise.  When Nick Fury had shown him three living options—an apartment in Brooklyn, an apartment in Manhattan, and a cabin in the woods—Steve had tapped the last photograph and asked why it had been included.  “It’s a way out of the city,” Fury had explained.
“I can do that.”
Tony said suddenly, “You passed it.”
“You got a problem with her?” Steve asked.
“I’m surprised you know what this is,” Natasha felt the need to point out, leaning an arm over the back of her seat while Bruce huddled into Steve’s side for protection, Tony staring out the opposing window with interest.

“Just wow,” Bruce said dreamily.  “Those caves.  You wouldn’t believe it.  Can I live there?”

All the while, Tony tried to understand where they had gone wrong.  Romulans had been indistinguishable from Vulcans—once.  They still shared the same brutal logic as the Vulcans.  They had to know that the

“Three months.”  Steve’s turn to pause, a long, long time.  “After three months went by.  Your body was—healed.  But.  You weren’t waking up.”  He looked down at his hands, began to pick at a nail, purely anxiety behavior.  “We waited.  A week.  Two weeks.”  He outright chewed on a nail, then let it go.  Tony stared at him, in horrified wonder.  Despite his outward composure, the single gesture of breakage was distressingly human.  “Dr. Strange—tried.  Nothing doin’, there, really.”  The pause was brief, but the drop hit harder: “So, I asked Wanda.”
“We cannot,” Tony said.

“Me, too,” Tony agreed, lifting his free hand like he would pet the hog before deciding against it, settling his palm on his own knee.  “Me, too.”
It took almost an hour to drag Thor away from his adoring fans.  They just kept coming.
Tony shrugged unapologetically.  “I write for smart people, Barton, not flying monkeys.”
With a sigh, Natasha said, “It’s never a minute,” but she walked.
“Cle—
Marker stared for a long moment, then clicked twice.

Clint drove like he was in the car chase of the century.  He swerved violently around obstacles, all while keeping the pedal-to-the-medal.  Natasha seemed unfazed from the front seat, while Bruce had taken to gripping Steve’s shirt with both hands and squeezing his eyes shut after the second near-crash.  Tony harassed Clint incessantly, keeping both knees planted on the back of his seat and insisting that they would get, at most, four rolls when destiny met inevitability.  Clint projected at least seven rolls.
“As I was saying,” Stovok said calmly, turning to address Tony, who consciously did not step back.  “We should find a more secure location.  There is a storm on the way.”  He indicated the ocean.  And now that Tony looked—he could see the clouds.  The wind was picking up, too.  “It would be unwise to be exposed.”  He bent double and hoisted Dr. Banner’s limp body over his shoulders.  “Follow me.”

“Ma’am,” Steve pleaded.
“All the more reason,” Tony insisted.

“Starfleet Command will be very pleased with your work.  We had hardly expected to find intelligent lifeforms within the Briar Patch,” Captain Carter went on.  “If we had, we would have sent a larger expeditionary force,” she added to Commander Stovok, who inclined his head in acknowledgement.
An uncomfortable pause ensued.  Not one of the Starfleet representatives had the heart to deliver the truth: Stovok was an anomaly, one of a fractional few.  Vulcans rarely left their homeworld; even fewer joined the star-trekking organization known as Starfleet.
Tony wrapped both arms around himself, holding himself together.

Steve rolled his eyes and kept reading.
Sighing, Steve turned to Natasha and said honestly, “It’s good to see you.”

“If it was easy,” Steve said philosophically, “everyone would do it.”  Then, with a tired sigh, Steve added, “I don’t think we’ll have any more trouble from Mr. Stone.”
Tony liked dangerous things.  Marvelous and strange things, too.  He enjoyed exploring the unknown, enjoyed sitting back on a pleasant evening and watching his superior office engage a race of seemingly unremarkable Terran children on a planet so distant its existence was not known until their arrival.

Stovok did not respond.  He did, however, change shirts—and Tony tried, oh-so-hard, not to look, but he looked, as Stovok slid his command gold and insulating black shirt off, and replaced them with a simple white dress shirt.  It made him look strangely human, even as he pulled on a navy-blue jacket, with his Commander’s insignia clear on the shoulder.

Looking sunburnt and sore, “Brucey” stared at him, then shook his head, grumbled a Vulcan curse, and nearly fell off the lip of the crater cresting it.  Tony grabbed him by his soaked tunic to arrest him, but Bruce hardly uttered a word of gratitude.  The Nibirans shuffled with almost improbable efficiency to make room for the newcomer, and Tony patted Bruce vehemently on the back.  “Knew you had it in you,” he said.
“Gimme, gimme,” Clint insisted, swiping a ticket from Steve’s hand and looping the string around his neck.  “Bye!” he added, taking off.

Steve had to leave, just so he would not disrupt it, so he would not get in the way of Tony finding something, anything, in the mind raging against itself.  Leaning against the wall, bad knee a strong hurt—nothing to do with the brain, there, just muscle and bone and the miracle of changing barometers—Steve listened to it go on, and on, and on, waiting for a scream, a yelp, a shout of terror, some animal sound that would signal the end.
Cursing the imminent reality of making the national news, Steve grabbed the nearest railing and leaped over it.

Most of all, Rico was present.  Present like the thing-they-did-not-talk-about.  When Tony was silent and broody, Rico was silent and broody with him.  Sometimes, Steve thought that that was what cats were best at: staring silently at walls for hours at a time.

Steve hated it; he took no pleasure in hurting others, even monster-others, from dream-worlds.  Even if it was the right thing, the only way out, he hated it.  He could never be a a medic, any kind of healer—his heart bled too easily, ached too strongly to intervene once the hurt started.  His eyelids sank again, and he thought he might fall asleep, shuffling a little to wake himself up, to keep the guard.
could proceed to treat him like a very ugly science experiment.  Fuss and fuss and who cared about a chemical spill here or there?  If there were mistakes, only he was hurt by them.  They could carry on indefinitely, so long as their strength of will endured.  He could not.
Steve got a hand around Tony’s right shoulder, the strong one, because
Stovok said nothing.
Steve looked over as Natasha pulled up to a ticket booth.  The ticketer blinked twice at them, then waved them along without a word.  Natasha obliged.
That, alone, made the stop worth it, and Tony was inconsolably pleased about it, but at least Tony kept his amusement to himself, facing away from the group, hiding a very self-satisfied smirk.  Even Natasha seemed at ease, strolling along the cobblestone garden.

But the emptiness told another story: “You never made it.”
Steve waited.  A very polite minute, if he did say so himself.  Then he said: “. . . Most people sleep in a bed.”

Cap placed a comforting hand on the back of his shoulders, before retracting it.  Tony struggled upright, alone, cold, and unmoored, until Cap rested a steadying hand on his back, lower but no less chaste.  Tony turned to him, antsy, and frowned.  Then he licked his thumb and used it to wipe the dirt he had kicked under Cap’s eye.

Tony wheedled, “I happen to have it on good authority you like food.”
It was remarkable.
Tony stepped towards him, and Steve said, “Tony, you can’t.”

“. . . You look like a hippy.”
And with bone-chilling reserve, Natasha replied, “. . . Are we done, Stark?”
And train it on Steve.
Steve winced a little, like Tony was making fun of him.  Tony said, “I don’t mind.”  Steve frowned in confusion.  “Uh, you know.  Picking favorites.”
“Shawarma.”
Tony said, “I will drink my own urine before I drink that,” and slid it back to Steve.
“Brooklyn,” Steve said automatically.  “New York,” he added compulsorily.
“I’m on vacation,” Natasha reminded sweetly.  She offered him the glass.  Steve sniffed it automatically, then took a small gulp.  Mmm.
“I’ll do it,” Tony volunteered, seated on a picnic table, sipping at a coffee.  “Here, I’ll get it on video,” he added, pawing around his pocket.  Bruce watched Tony with alarm.  Thor stood off to the side, looking out at the river.
He was back in less than ten minutes.  “How come when
Stovok visibly sat up straighter, as if breaking from a trance.  “You are warp-capable?” he asked softly.  At his side, Thor wolfed down food, unimpressed, but Romanova paused beside Tony, and Tony knew his own expression was gob-smacked.
“This may come as a surprise, but he
Dread smashed into Tony like a physical
Steve sighed.  For such a smart guy on paper, Tony could be very obtuse.  “
“We still got ‘em,” Steve said automatically.  “Smaller ones.”
For a moment, Tony wished he had the full glass of water to throw at him.  Then he realized it was pointless—Steve was still too far away—and even if he did, what good would come of it?
“With luck, your combative capabilities will not be needed,” Liaison Hill reassured.
it—but there was a reason a city slicker like him had never dreamed of owning his own ranch.  He hated killing them with his own hands.
Halfway up a pine tree with Tony Stark clinging to his back, one hand slung over Steve’s shoulder with bear spray in hand, Tony asked plainly, “Can I bear-spray him now?”
“Really?”
“Yeah, yeah.  I want that Andorian beer.  Better be

“Merry Christmas to you, too,” Tony said tightly.  “Yeah, coffee’s good.  Sure as shit won’t be sleepin’.”

Dread poured cold water over Tony.

“You’re an angel,” Tony groaned, transferring onto his back gingerly.  “Ow.”
Agony befell Tony.

Sighing, Tony reached for the air cannister.  He nearly jumped out of his skin when a second, red-tinted troublemaker intercepted him, tiny teeth locked around his welding glove.  “

.  The sudden drop in tension was dizzying.  There was something about Steve’s bond with Snow that almost frightened Tony; he had no doubt that if both of them, Tony and Snow, were drowning, Steve would save Snow first.
This really was Hell, Tony thought peevishly, hooking both legs over the arm of the human skull throne.  He could bring fire to the underlings, but why should he?  Then the next bastard would complain about how hot it was and find a way to cool it off.  Endless cycle.
Thor clapped him on the shoulder.  “Of course.”  Smiling, he released Bruce and added, “Where I come from, everything is

Tempted though Steve was to let it play out, his inner commanding officer kicked in, and he grabbed Clint and Tony by the backs of the respective collars, holding them at arm’s length apart.  “Knock it
As soon as he emerged, shame washed over him.
Tony Stark held his breath.  He began to feel lightheaded immediately.
An answering series of deep, distant clicks made Tony’s blood run cold.
Clint said, “Don’t be cheap.”
“Mm?”
“Wait for
Steve looked at the two of them in a calculating state of mind.
Thor left him, taking some of his warmth.  The Raccoon, whose name Tony could never remember, said from the floor, “Sheesh, I’ve been at happier funerals,” and followed.

“I’m a national treasure and you can’t have me,” Tony replied, before making the mistake of tossing back the drink, anyway.  His grimace was so deep that it was comical, profound disgust tightening his expression.  Steve held in his laughter, but only just.

Tony shrugged unapologetically.  “It’s called

Steve did not smile.  “You’re hurt.”  It wasn’t a question.

Steve sighed, releasing the cardigan.  “Can’t take it with us, Tony.”
Tony thought of the white light.  It hurt.
Or, as Colonel Phillips put it:

“Kiss a moose, maybe they’ll let us stay.”
With a sigh, Steve conceded, “One drink.”
Then the humanoid clicked at him twice, low, almost inquisitive sounds.  Tony swallowed.
Somehow, Tony awoke in a hospital.
Cap sighed.  “It just slipped out.  Look—”
“I have not left the planet since our arrival,” Stovok assured.
“Anthony.  Edward.  Stark.”  Tiberius Stone stood in the doorway with an ear-to-ear smile.  “How long has it been?”
“I thought you jumping in the Lake was pretty swoon-worthy.”
“This is it,” Clint declared, sitting in the bed of a silver pickup truck.  “This is the one.”

“It’s gotta be a distant relative,” Tony insisted, startling when the Nibirans began hooting in interest.  He looked forward automatically, heard echoing hoots far below, and saw the descent team, about halfway up the volcano.  Stovok was among them.  Tony bolted upright, nearly plunged forward until Bruce grabbed him by the back of the shirt.  “Thanks.”
Natasha jogged past them.
“Spunk up,” Tony repeated, arms folded across his chest.  “This was inevitable.”
Tony made a soft sound of amusement, then said, “She’s all . . . bark.  Hey, did you know . . . did you know, she . . . she’s
Digesting the existence of
Prowling the outfield, waiting for a chance to make his next hit, Steve heard, “It’s just a game, Blade Runner,” and ignored it.
Clint reached into a pocket, offered him a stick of gum.  Tony took it, chewed on it for a while.
Then, after a stunningly long and still painfully brief moment, Tony let go.  Steve could still feel the imprint of his warmth on his own skin, an echo on ice.
“Can’t do it yourself?” Steve responded, on edge, setting Iron Man down on a broad table that looked like it was built for making suits.

Still wishing he had something to offer, given the shiver Tony was doing a not-so-great job at hiding, Steve sat down next to him, just as Clint harangued Thor, “I wanna be the larvae of Ymir’s flesh.”

“Wait,” Tony blurted.
A cold, clear, dark-waters-run-deep voice cut across the lobby:

The gears turned again in Tony’s head, as he observed the half-strapped splint and the slow but steady way Steve brushed his arm, a ginger touch but an insistent one.
With a sigh, Steve sat on his own freshly-made bed.  “All right, fine,” he said calmly.
Hulk shifted until his back was facing her, almost shy in his manner.  Steve wondered what kind of mind the Hulk had, then decided he was probably better off
“Will we not be going inside?” Thor asked, gesturing at the Mansion.
“I don’t know,” Tony said truthfully.  “Maybe loneliness.  You made her less lonely.”
A very upbeat, very loud number started playing from his bedroom.  Steve sighed silently in resignation.

, and instead of complaining that it was wrong to venture outside the prescribed limits, rude to leave a gentleman waiting, or borderline unlawful to slip deeper into the planetarium without an honor guard, he followed Tony Stark into the arched, ethereal darkness, guided only by that strange blue light, emanating from Tony’s chest.
A red tunicked technician leaped to his feet with a whispered cry of: “
“You okay?  Captain?  America?  Sir?” the kid asked.
Natasha inclined her head.  Hill said, “That goes doubly for you, Cap.”  She held up a card; he reluctantly lowered his shield and took it.  “Not everything has to go to Fury.”  She smiled a little, then added, “I’d join you for breakfast, but I’m pretty sure the others want to see me even less than you do.”
“What business could you have with the
A curling chalk dragon reposed on the stone walkway, colored every configuration of the rainbow by a half dozen attentive artists.  Stovok had either not noticed him—which was more probable than it seemed, given his ability to meditate in the middle of firefights and deep storms—or had elected to ignore him, carefully tracing out another black-scaled friend for the children to color.  The boy who had summoned him stayed very close, leaning on the Vulcan’s shoulder and adding splashes of cornflower blue to the creature emerging with every careful brush stroke.
It was three in the morning, so Tony was perfectly justified in flopping a foot over Steve’s, in a gesture of simple, human companionship.
For a long moment, they were quiet together.
Steve could try and stop him.  But he wouldn’t.  Because come Hell or high water, Steve Rogers was always there.  They were practically destiny.

Shaking his head, Steve told him, “I don’t wanna fight.”  He felt restless, almost out of his own skin, on the verge of doing something stupid.  No matter how delusional his reality was, if he broke too far from the script of normal, there would be consequences.  He had to keep a level head about it.  He just had to play al—
Tony spun on his bar chair and called out, “Bruce, come here.”
“. . . I’d watch that,” Steve said honestly.  He would.
Steve had this to say: “You wanna take a walk?”
For one naïve impulsive hopeful devastating moment, Steve waited for Tony to just . . . snap his fingers and put the world together.
“. . . That checks out.”
Fun fact: While there is no Little Bushel Alpaca Farm, there *is* a Thistle Creek Farm, which has over 60 alpacas. It's located outside Buffalo, New York. All OCs are purely fictional.

The glowing clock on the nightstand said it was 3:39 a.m.

shaped to look like a pile of skulls.  Simple necessity: human bone could never hold up to centuries of damnation.
Carter was saying, “Perhaps a cloaked warbird—” but Tony interrupted:
Tony set the pot in front of Steve.  “Thanks, but—no thanks.”
“You will be if you don’t pipe down.”

The whole car went quiet.

“This is why you should vote in team-building exercises,” Steve Rogers said patiently, roped up and ready to spelunk.  “When I asked,
, Steve meant, families were generally large and the very center of Irish life.  The whole clan survived and died based on strong blood bonds.  Separating oneself from one’s kin was like stepping out of a well-formed encampment and vowing to cross the tundra, alone, with barely a month’s provisions to get by.  There was civilization on the other side of that vast stretch, opportunity, a world beyond the simple life, the unstable but familiar world of farming.  But there was danger, and hardship, and loneliness, too.
“Can’t get rid of us that easily, Stark,” Ensign Barton said dryly.  “It’s you who’s always causing trouble.”
Steve said, “Yes, we are.”  It was instinct, really—
The feeling of being alone did not last long: he had hardly sat up, stretched out some of the creak in his bones, before Steve padded over, holding a cup of coffee in one hand.  “Consider it a thank-you,” he explained, offering it.
Clint, Thor, and Bruce huddled together in the backseat, working on the dinosaur puzzle.  It seemed pretty doomed to fail, as far as Steve was concerned—one pothole and the whole thing would fall apart—but they had a system, Thor’s steady hands holding the board and puzzle while Bruce and Clint shuffled through pieces.
Hulk snorted again, then smashed his fist against the car again.  “I said I won’t leave!” Steve shouted.
“Oh my
“Am I not invited?” never-one-to-be-left-out-for-long asked, slowing his pace to walk on Thor’s other side.  “Quid pro quo—I did bring you here.”
Tony pulled off broody and unimpressed for one full minute.  Then he huffed a laugh.  It quickly became a full blown laughing fit, quiet but uncontrollable.
Steve narrowed his eyes.  “Crack the egg, Tony,” Steve insisted.  “By all means.”
“Is it?”
And then he began to draw.
Laughing, Tony rolled onto his back and howled with amusement while Stovok grumbled and paced around his own quarters, restless as a jaguar.  He even managed to dictate a report, which Tony noticed left out the juicy bits in the cave and the long bits at the volcano.  He said loudly, “Kiss and tell!” and heard the recording pause.
“Where the hell have
Don't worry, "Roscoe" won't alter the overall fast-and-loose style of the narrative, but I felt he would be critical in a big city like Chicago, particularly with a--particular--client like Tony, who needs his espresso hot. He's basically greasing the levers for this particular sequence.

Uncomfortably confronted by the truth, Tony kept his back to the Ba’ku.  “It’s not like we could

when the Nibiran on his other side elbowed him impatiently.  Then he took the coconut and clipped off a bite, right through the skin, before passing the fruit along to his impatient companion.  “Tastes like tadgola,” Bruce said, still chewing.
“I’ve been told,” Steve said dryly.  Before Tony could stomp off or sulk, he caught Tony by the sleeve, asking, “Do we need to talk?”
Bucky Barnes drawled in his memory.
“No, you’re very good at it,” Steve protested, taking a single step backwards, towards the hellhole.  “I’ve seen you work.  Got patience for days.”
“Oh, I’m dead serious,” Tony said.  “Look,” he began, in that patient
“I am,” Tony said stiffly.  He wanted off the ship.  He felt strange, around Commander Stovok, like something they were not supposed to mention had happened.
Steve held Tony steady in one arm as he spear-fished the remaining hot dogs with the other, ignoring the teeth gnawing at his forearm.
“Uh-huh,” Bruce agreed, gaze drifting wistfully to the case.
“If it hasn’t happened yet,” Steve said, lounging fully clothed in a dry bathtub with an equally dressed Tony Stark on top of him, “I don’t think it’s going to.”
. o .
Steve did not add himself to the scene, tucking the book back into his pocket.  Then he simply drew in a water-laced breath and enjoyed the view.
“I wish I were kidding.”  Tony conjured up the blue map and showed them a red line connecting two points.  “It’s a gimmick store.  For children.  Of which Barton is the target demographic.  Oooh,” he purred, collapsing the map.  “We’re not that far from an ice cream parlor.
“I’ll suck your dick.”
Hello, dear friends:
, and I will unstitch you.”  Then he popped the car door and stepped outside.
“Perhaps they are a hive mind,” Stovok mused.  “Or—”
To him, Chicago was a part of his country, a part of
“I’m not bored,” Tony enunciated, arms folded on the back of Steve’s seat, chin resting on them.  Steve had long since given up trying to keep him in the backseat, and apparently even given up on trying to maintain a personal bubble.  Part of him worried that he was giving in too easily, but another part sort of shrugged its shoulders and asked what it was to him if Tony Stark needed the space.  “I am . . . on the lookout.”
“Yes.”
,” Steve warned, real bark in his voice.  “Knock it off.”
“Barton’s,” Iron Man explained, landing with a
Far more surprising was the feel of soft, human hair against the underside of his chin as Tony rested his cheek against Steve’s shoulder.  Steve did not shift to look at him, did not drink in the sight of Tony Stark without his armor.
gambling,” Steve said, very disappointed.  His Ma had always impressed that risking what one had for more was the height of envy—being satisfied with little was better than reaching for the stars and coming back empty-handed.
Steve gave him a pitying look, brief but there, before schooling his expression into neutrality, sitting against Snow’s hide and sketching, the picture of domestic companionship.  Snow was watching Steve intently, and Tony realized Steve was drawing her.  It made him feel ill.
, but she folded down next to him instead, shoulder-to-shoulder.  Rage caught up to him for a moment, and he wanted to tell her he was not hurt, that she needed to go where she was needed, he could hold down his own for however-long-it-took.
He wasted no time, the third time around: he lunged and grabbed Iron Man, pinned his arms to his sides.  He felt the human underneath, felt the suit strain briefly against him, like it might throw him off.

“Just do it.”
fault he was in this predicament.  “Put one hand over the other,” Tony instructed, gripping his own wrist, “and thrust upwards.”  He tugged gently upwards a couple times.  Then, lifting Bruce clear off the floor, he added, “Can also be used to—”
Tony did not move.  Steve felt the seconds ticking down.  Out loud, Steve acknowledged, “I have to get back to the cat.”
“My father was human,” Stovok acknowledged.  “He was a security officer in the Kzin-Earth Wars.  He lived to see the turning point: the development of faster-than-light travel.  It proved the decisive end to the war.  And,” he paused meaningfully, “it permitted the eventual regular contact between Terrans and Vulcans.”
“Did I?”
“Guess we’re about to find out.  Go, Thor!” Tony shouted.  “
“Why not?  I’m very good at it.”
“Fury’s—I’m not a
, as Tony had ever heard a Vulcan admit.
Nope.  Nope.  He returned to the rock, then paced back immediately, restless and anxious.  “
“Nay,” Thor chuckled across from them.  “I am immortal.”
“Don’t sulk.”
“What was relevant about me?” Tony asked, because Tony, thank Steve’s lucky stars, was more vain than nosy.
Six dollars and thirty minutes of soap time later, a lone car pulled up to the station.  They all looked over as it pulled into the empty lot and parked about ten paces away from their own pancaked vehicle.
He still had a worrying and borderline irrational fondness for Thallium, who frequently came to him for cuddles.  He was pretty sure indigo Indium was the last feral dragon, but the runt of the litter refused to abandon the comforts of home, complete with regular supplemental feedings.

Rico climbed right up Steve’s leg, finding a home on his shoulder.  “Lively,” finished the clerk.
“What is?” Steve prompted, when Clint waited—waited, just to know that he was not talking to empty air.
“Knowledge is power?”
Sighing tersely, more in disbelief than anger, Steve startled a little when the elevator began to rise.  He looked to Natasha, who had not moved, and then the ceiling, which did not answer.
Maybe it was the wound he would carry to eternity.  But Steve would bear it with him.
-Vulcan—it was that simple.

Tony leaned against the hood of his own car, basking in the sun, looking incongruous in his futuristic sunglasses and stolen outfit.

of every enlisted Starfleet officer.  Both amounted to the same thing:
, but Steve ignored it, picking up Thor’s abandoned pamphlet and folding it neatly back onto the rack.  He heard a whistle nearby, looked up, and saw Clint lingering in the doorway to the gas station.  Warily, Steve joined him.
A wet, barely-there laugh emitted from the suit.  Steve would have missed it, had his ears not been pricked for it, listening.
“Don’t pass out,” Steve warned him.
Ill-timed, because a familiar voice startled him from behind: “Two-hundred-and-seventy-nine-point-nine-five-seven-two days.”
Tony made a small noise.  “Oh, for the love of—” Steve started.
“Mooch,” Steve repeated.  “You know.  A—”
“Yeah.  You would.”  Tony reached for a knife to eat cake with.  Steve caught his hand.
Tony set down the clock and reached for his pocket, pulling out a telephone.  “I’m on it.  Anyone else craving seafood?”

“Oh, yes, you will,” Aislinn said sternly.  “Share it around.  That’s all we ask.”
He glanced down at red Curium, sleeping on his boots, the dragon who could not be half the dragon Marker was.
“Ow,” he moaned, waking up Steve, who shifted briefly in confusion, then asked:
“Should come back in a month,” Coleman advised, addressing Steve again.  “Cherry pies.  Best you’ll ever have.”
“Get out of the truck,” Steve ordered calmly.
Steve awoke, his face smushed into the fabric of a carnival bear’s fur, his arm slightly stiff from being crimped in one position for so long.  Thor had finally, mercifully, abandoned the guitar, and the room, leaving a pseudo-silence over the space.  Steve blinked once peaceably, enjoying the quiet, then tensed, because if it was quiet then that meant something had happened.
The firm hand on his wrist kept him sane.  It took less than a minute for Stovok to shimmy out of the tunnel, but it was the longest minute of Tony’s life, and he had spent hours in tense diplomatic standoffs, effectively a prisoner of a war that never quite went critical.
The scene faded away.  In its place was a weathered-looking Barnes on a starship medical bay.  Stovok himself was busily wrapping Barnes’ hand.  “How you holding up, Stovok?” Barnes asked, almost idly.
And Steve was off.

There was
“It’s not,” Tony agreed.  “It’s two.”
“Go sit,” Clint ordered, pointing his spatula at the beaten-up picnic table near Bruce.  Steve grumbled but obligingly retreated to the table.  “Wait a second, I thought you—” he then pointed the spatula at Bruce, who shrank, “were on cake watch, who’s on cake watch?”
“Dams?”
Carefully, with plenty of lead time to reject the gesture, Tony reached over and placed a hand on Stovok’s knee.  “I wouldn’t have you anywhere else.  Commander.”
“I mean, this isn’t something we learned in basic,” Steve said, still trying, almost instinctively, to follow the movements, his enhanced reflexes itching with the need to pin down every movement.  “So, why did you learn it in—training?”
Tony toyed with the conversational lure: “You broke your arm and it healed in three days.  I bet you could get mauled and shake it off.  Nothin’ in these woods scarier than you, right?  Must be nice.”
Clint raced after him at a dead sprint, ball held in outstretched arm.  Then Thor decided to strike, lunging for Clint and sending him on a panicked abort-the-mission trajectory.

Big pale, too, he thought, as lukewarm water drained over his head for three full seconds.
“Me first,” Tony insisted, and then, propelled by the delirious volcanic fumes or pure relief, flung both arms around Stovok’s neck, squeezing hard.  The Vulcan tolerated it better than most—most would have simply chucked him over one shoulder into the mired abyss, maybe two hundred meters below—but Tony could feel the echo of colorful emotions, red exhaustion, blue curiosity, a hint of green that seemed intrinsic with longing,
before scooping up and holding out Thallium.
Tony did not respond.  Steve pressed an ear against the wood.  He thought he heard soft snoring.
He drew in a long breath of fresh air, unaccosted, right in his world.
Tony stared at him.
Bruce looked at him, then jumped a little, as though surprised to see him, before nodding in vague agreement.  He gathered up his shirt, shrugged it on, and padded barefoot into the hallway.  Steve just hoped he could find the room all right.
Steve looked skyward for support.  Ol’ Pokey scooted up the tree another foot, in no apparent rush.  It was a two-for-one special, after all.  “No,” Steve insisted.  “You

Tony blinked, tears clumping his own eyelashes, reflexive against the pain, the bright white lights, the simple realization that he was
There was a whine from Clint, followed by footsteps sprinting towards the outfield.  Thor got up and offered Steve a hand up.  With a huff, Steve took it and pulled himself back upright.
Chicago had always been a stranger to Steve.
“More,” Tony moaned as Rhodes denied him a lethal dose of morphine.

He was struck with the weight of the Moon, the texture of it: not gray but liquid stone, malleable.  He could

Clint spat on the ground.  Steve shook his head.

“He respects my results,” Tony corrected, kicking off his shoes and tugging off his socks so he could rest his feet in the grass.  Real grass.  He missed Terra, suddenly and powerfully.  Space was cool—literally.  Cold, detached, often separated by a very necessary layer of life-saving reality.  While Class M planets were not rare, they were outnumbered by incompatible worlds, and most Starfleet business was conducted on their ships to avoid the middleman of on-world operations.  The texture of real grass comforted something primal in Tony, a desire for the homeworld that burned inside even the most space-faring race.

Then he heard it: chittering, nearby, yelping and clucking noises that grew in volume as they neared.  Tony nearly got up, but he trusted the Vulcan’s ruthless judgment over his own animal need to

They followed the Ba’ku to an open-air dining hall, where perhaps a hundred members were already eating.  They paused to ogle Thor, then returned to their meal.

Tony replaced the bracelet on his wrist.  “Thank you.”
By the third stick, he felt almost hypnotized.  “This is way cooler than the President,” he murmured.
For a moment, Steve thought about hand-waving him off.  Then he thought,
“Stark says we’re not soldiers,” Steve said gruffly, surprised that he was bringing it up, in the broad light of day.  It was as easy as taking a puff on a cigarette to add, “What do you call a guy that dives into a firefight wearing a suit of armor?”
