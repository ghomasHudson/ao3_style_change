“And how did that go?” Owl sounded sceptical.
“I’m sorry for what happened that night,” Sherlock mumbled into his chest. “It started out as a plot to find out if you really were who Mycroft said you were, and I didn’t really care if you were an assassin or not. I thought playing with your feelings was the best option, but then I found out I genuinely just wanted to kiss you, so I did, and then you kissed me back, and I lost it. I got confused because you always said you’re definitely not gay, and then I got scared that you played
John nodded at this. He knew the detective well enough. Calling Lestrade was probably just a way to cope with the fact that the one he thought he knew, wasn’t who he thought he knew after all.
John frowned when Lestrade didn’t answer him. He let out a sigh.
“Wait a second,” he used the gun to scratch his temple. “You shouldn’t be here. You’re never coming back to me,” John watched as he aimed the gun at his own head. He felt the world come to a stop as the man turned to face him.
“Can I…” he was almost afraid to ask. “Can I see them?”
“Not without you,” the detective argued making John sigh.
He started trying to convince Owl to at least let him have his sniper rifle back. She was not happy about it, but complied when he told her he only wanted to do some maintenance on it after all these years. It didn’t take long before he held his old favourite weapon in his hands. He’d had a few of them, but this one had been his best one by far. The metal was decorated with kill counts, one line per kill, and small drawings from when he waited for a target. The familiar weight made his broken heart warmer.
The thought was quickly disposed of as John turned around. The sight that met him made his stomach drop. The ‘tattoos’ were surrounded by ragged scars leading towards the wings.
“Oh, I think you know exactly what I mean.”
You could almost taste the heavy atmosphere. John had been certain their friendship was real, but at the moment? He wanted to scream. Cry. Maybe even sink into the floor and disappear. He wanted to be crushed into tiny pieces and be taken by the wind as far away as possible. But that's what had happened already, hadn't it? Sherlock knew his secret. The tall man with the curly, black hair and sharp, clever eyes. For a moment John had believed they could be more. Only for a moment before Sherlock had spun him around and pushed him to the ground.
“Serial killer,” the detective muttered and continued to run his fingers over the letters on the screen. John nodded. After the years of living with each other, they had helped on quite a lot of the Yard's cases. Serial killers were some of the most interesting, at least that's what Sherlock thought. John on the other hand? He lived for the adrenalin and action. It reminded him a bit of his earlier years. Shots fired, fleeing through the air, and his heart beating in his ears.
A man stood on top of a building, gazing out above London. The wind played with his short hair. He closed his eyes and felt a tug on his back. He smiled to himself as he stretched out his wings. The black feathers spread and caught in the wind. If he just leant forward a few inches, he’d be carried up into the night sky.
“Why?”
“When will he be here?” John walked up to her and helped clean up. It wasn’t that much of a mess, so it only took a couple of minutes.
He felt new tears threatening to fall as the door to the bedroom shot open and revealed a terrified looking Mrs. Hudson. John could only stare at the barrel of the gun she was holding and feeling slightly faint as she only seemed to hold it tighter as she recognised him.
“Thank you for coming,” John gave her a quick hug, and walked back to the chair he’d been sitting in.
“Hey,” she started, grabbing one of the wings, lifting it out of the way so she could see his face. “I think he’d love you either way. Even if you were an assassin, it’s not like you run around killing people at the present, right?” When John didn’t respond, she continued. “He loves you John. I’ve seen it. He wouldn’t care whatever happened in the past.”
“Definitely, miss Owl,” he grinned and put the knife back.
Sherlock ripped the files out of the DI's hand and opened them. John wanted to take the files from him and burn them. He remembered that case. They had tried to hunt his sister and him down, never succeeding, but close enough to get almost all the information Sherlock would need to solve the case.
“About a client of mine?”
“There isn’t any,” Mycroft frowned and scratched his temple before flattening his hair down. “All information on ‘John Watson’ started as he attended St. Bart’s. I’ve checked his record, his birth certificate and the schools he went to. There is absolutely nothing about him. John Watson didn’t exist until ten years ago.”
“I know,” John grinned. “You want to hear about the rest of them, too? You want me to tell you about the ten people I killed just the last month? Or would you rather hear about something else? Did you ever wonder who actually killed that cabbie five years ago? Shot dead through two windows. Yeah, that was me, too. And you know what? I enjoyed every second of it.”
He continued to walk through the narrow alley. It was getting considerably more difficult to see in the dim light.
“Thank you,” Mycroft sighed in relief and got to his feet. “A car will be waiting for you outside when you’re out. It’ll take you to Baker Street. I’ll see you soon.”
“Kiss me?”
“Just stay away from the skin, please,” John said and turned around again. Sherlock didn’t waste a single moment and started to check the wings over, feeling the bones underneath.  He ran his fingers through the feathers earning a low groan from John. He noticed one of them were pointing at an odd angle.
“No, no, it’s fine, you just surprised me,” John reassured and smiled at him over his shoulder. “Come on, it’s fine. You have permission.”
John nodded and leaned back in his chair. Sherlock noticed he was staring out the window at something outside. The soft light from the lamp made him look like a mystery. A mystery Sherlock got an urge to solve. The doctor looked dangerous. Who would have thought the cuddly man in the jumpers could possibly be a killing machine. One of the most wanted assassins in the world at one point. There was something in his gaze that turned serious the longer he stared out into the cold night. He was entirely lost in his thoughts, and Sherlock couldn’t help but find it mesmerizing.
“Care to fill me in?”
His last hope was out the window the moment Sherlock had said it. A tattoo. Like the one on his back. The one that had been there for as long as he could remember. The wings. It was surprising Sherlock hadn’t noticed them yet, really.
“Of course, I do,” she chuckled. “She’s a friend of mine, remember?” she leaned into his side for a moment. “Just call her. I’m sure she’ll be on standby if you feel like something’s about to happen.”
“How long was I asleep?” he asked quietly, scared of his own voice. It was incredibly hoarse and his throat hurt like hell.
They continued over to the body after telling the officer to leave the kids alone. He had been a bit reluctant, but complied in the end. The first thing that struck John was how clean the shot was. It had been a while since he’d seen anything like it. It would be difficult to steer the consulting detective in the wrong direction, but he had to try. He would do anything to be able to spend more time with his friend, even if that thing ended up making them wind up on a wild goose chase.
Sherlock pulled back enough to look John’ in the eye. The assassin stared at him, mouth agape, shock and disbelief playing on his features. Sherlock didn’t even blink. He waited for the response patiently, obviously knowing the question would surprise him.
“Yeah, I found something of yours, actually,” Owl pulled out something from her pocket and threw it to John. He caught it with one hand and smiled brightly when he recognised what it was.
“Not at all,” the consulting detective stared at a picture from one of the crime scenes. John could see the man on the pavement. No blood from anywhere except the head.
Sherlock nodded. John smiled at him before pulling him into a tight hug, trying not to think about how thin he’d become. The detective continued to sob, his legs gave out under him, and he started to sink slowly down to the floor. John joined him until both of them were seated on the floor. Sherlock pretty much in John’s lap, clinging to him like his life depended on it. John rocked them back and forth running his fingers through the dark curls soothingly.
“Come on, I’m tired,” John mumbled into the sheets. “I can hear you thinking.”
“I guess that’s okay. Just hurry up,” Lestrade took a step back waiting for John to move.
“Sherlock!” he shouted getting the detective’s attention. Sherlock spun around, pointing the gun at him.
He knew how he was going to see John’s back. It was clear as day.
“How is he doing?” John asked, the fear of asking drowned out by the curiosity. Mrs. Hudson shook her head sadly.
“It’s three in the afternoon,” Owl grinned at him and gave him a glass of water. “You’ve been asleep for about twelve hours. But you needed it, so don’t worry.”
“Would be nice to sleep on my back again,” he sighed and walked past her into the living room. He sat down on what had become his favourite piece of furniture, the footstool, and let his wings rest on the floor.
“You talk about them as if they were real feathers,” Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
“I figured I miss it,” John straightened as Owl continued with her task.
almost lost you,” Sherlock mumbled the last part. John grabbed his hand and kissed his palm.
How was he even going to get a look at John’s back without making it seem weird. He could say it was for a case, but considering their circumstances, John would probably just find an excuse to leave. He could sneak into his room and peek, but even that was a little not good. He still respected his privacy. Sometimes. Okay, not so often, but that seemed like a wrong thing to do, even for him. Maybe he could just ask him? Nah, too boring.
“Pretty much,” he smiled, and felt a weak punch in his arm. He glanced over at Sherlock who glared at him. “You are,” he laughed as the detective rolled his eyes.
Owl shushed him and pulled him into a hug. He hadn’t sobbed in years, but right now he wanted nothing more than to cry and feel sorry for himself. He wanted to scream. He felt so utterly stupid for even thinking for a second that the great consulting detective, the amazing Sherlock Holmes, would ever look at him as anything else than a criminal if he found out his secret. And now he was out of the closet, too. The emotions were raging through him. He couldn’t stop clinging to his partner as he continued to sob. He didn’t even realise she helped him to the guest room before he was laying on his stomach on the soft bed. She stayed with him as he started to drift off into a dreamless sleep. The darkness was welcoming as he slipped into it.
Lestrade shook his head. “We had our best men on that case. They did figure out that there were more than one killer, and that they were known as the Birds of Prey. They never figured out why they were called this in the criminal world, but they had a hypothesis that it was because of the angle on the bullet the victims were hit by. I have the files here if you want them.”
“John, come on! This is getting ridiculous,” Sherlock had his nose in his phone. His attention had been caught by the case. John might be safe after all.
“I am!”
Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes, trying to focus through the petting.
“Irene Adler.”
“John?” she crouched in front of him. He didn’t dare look at her. He felt so full of shame and regret after all he’d done. He just let out a whimper and bowed his head down, trying to appear as small as he could. If he could just die, that would probably be the best. “Oh, John,” she let a hand fall to his shoulders, cringing slightly at his flinch. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to. It’s just that Sherlock told us about who you were, and I got a bit spooked when I heard someone in the flat, so I assumed the worst. Could be anyone, you know.”
“No, course not. I’m just… I would really like to marry you, John. We can even have a ceremony, if you’d like, even though it’s just traditional nonsense and a waste of money,” he rambled out making John sigh.
“John, I’m starting to get worried about you, now,” Sherlock sighed and got up from the chair, already on his way to get his coat. “You’ve been acting different from the moment this case started, and I’m starting to suspect you know something I don’t. Which is pointless, given the reason I’ll figure it out anyway. What are you hiding from me?”
“As you know, John served as an army doctor in Afghanistan,” Mycroft started to explain, matching his brother’s intense stare. “He had a nickname, would you know? They called him Angel.”
(Okay, I just really wanted to draw John with those goggles, so here you go, I hope you enjoy it XD)
“Look out, as in see where you’re going. Now, about tonight; are you sure something is going to happen? Won’t you be able to just fly off if something happens?”
“Oh my God,” he whispered and let his hands cover his eyes.
“Yes, you do,” the dominatrix pulled out a piece of paper, wrote down something and gave the note to him.
“What?”
“You got shot,” Sherlock growled.
“Please, I don’t know what he’ll do if he finds out. I could end up at a lab table somewhere, or just be arrested. I could even become his personal lab rat.”
“It’s been a few hours since I got home to find you like that, so it’s hard to tell. What did Mycroft want?”
“I thought you said you enjoyed killing people?”
“I’m sorry John,” Sherlock came closer to him. “I was an imbecile. I shouldn’t have left the flat. If I had just listened to you, you wouldn’t have been shot, and I couldn’t think about losing you, because… you are my entire life, and without you, I wouldn’t have a reason to exist,” he placed his hand carefully on John’s cheek. “I love you so much, John.”
Hawk when I first read through them.”
Sherlock felt his pulse spike. Dread crept up from the bottom of his stomach and attached itself to his spine. This was about his case. He was trying to hunt down the mysterious birds of prey. One of the two assassins had mysteriously disappeared about ten years ago, while the other had continued their work.
“He’s shutting down, John,” the man seemed to deflate and almost looked like a wounded animal. Another flare of uneasiness shot through John. “I’m afraid he won’t make it for much longer if nothing changes. He’s not eating, not sleeping, he just sits there, staring straight ahead holding a feather. I tried to take it away from him, if only to get a reaction. I got him to look at me, but he never said a word, just sat there. I… I don’t know what to do, other than to ask you.”
“Maybe I wasn’t finished?” he kissed Sherlock’s nose. The detective made an annoyed sound. John ignored him, continuing to kiss everywhere else other than his mouth.
“Yes, and while you do that, you still haven’t told me what I’m supposed to be prepared for.”
“I don’t like to rat out my friends, doctor,” Irene got up from the chair and walked over to the window. She paused for a second. “But I do hear rooftops is one of the places people see her the most. She enjoys the best views of the city.”
“You really think so?” he chanced a glance at her, looking into her gentle eyes. His hope was starting to build.
“Yes.”
“I need some help!” he shouted, cursing as people just stared at him. “For fuck’s sake, don’t just stand there!”
Who was he kidding? Sherlock didn’t need him. He was useless. He just stated the obvious and trailed after the guy with the plan. He would make John go to jail for sure if he ever found out. “
“I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t,” Irene said as she let go of the wing. “Okay, it’s getting late, doctor. I’m sure Mr. Holmes will be home soon.”
Sherlock sighed and squinted at him.
“Good luck, doctor,” she gave him a soft smile as he walked over the porch. “And say hi to Owl for me if you call her.”
“What?” he mumbled as he traced each individual feather. John chuckled.
There was silence on the other end for a moment.
Lestrade came closer, gun still raised, just in case. He took out his handcuffs and was about to put them on when John spoke again.
John shook his head to try and find his focus again. He looked up to find the pair gone. A slight panic fluttered through him as he jumped off the building and tried to search for the two of them, finally seeing them walk down a busy street. John almost lost them again as he soared over them, circling them and readying his sniper. He took aim and was about to fire when the pair took a sudden turn, making Sherlock the one being aimed at. John almost dropped the weapon. It had caught him off guard. He tried to get himself together again and once again lifted his sniper. This time the two people continued on a straight enough line, making John able to get a clear shot. He took a deep breath, sped up a little, and took the shot when he was straight over them. He watched as Sherlock jumped out of the way, and the woman collapse. The detective looked around frantically for the source, and John could’ve sworn the man saw him, but he continued to look around in the chaos caused by the shooting. John could feel tears start to fall from his eyes. He didn’t know why, but he felt like the past six months didn’t happen, and that the detective had just pushed him to the ground again.
White. White ceiling, white walls, white sheet, black curls. He blinked slowly, taking in his surroundings. Dizziness and exhaustion made it difficult to think straight. He let his eyes adjust to the dim light in the small hospital room. The night sky outside the window gleamed with stars. He missed flying among the stars. Their beauty alone could make his eyes shine with awe and wonder. They were almost as beautiful as the man sitting in the red armchair beside his bed. They didn’t stand a chance against the soft curls on his head, or his striking intelligent eyes, or his sharp cheek bones. They didn’t shine as bright as the man he loved more than anything. The man he wouldn’t hesitate to protect at all costs.
John wasn’t proud of his deception skills. He was actually pretty embarrassed by them. Who would have known that one of the best assassins in the world had no idea how to keep his own secrets?
Mycroft gave him the file and leaned against the desk.
“Fine, I’ll help you,” Owl sighed. “But if he tries to catch me, I’ll shoot him.”
Sherlock has a chat with Mycroft.
“Yeah, yeah, you should still talk to him.”
with a small smiley face. He guessed she’d already left for the day, probably going to the city to buy some more supplies. He decided he couldn’t wait for her to get back, so he quickly scribbled a thank-you note and put on his gear. He put on his leg holster just in case something happened.
“Are you serious?” she stopped applying the fabric and met his determined gaze. “You are. I thought you said you were done killing people for money?”
“Sounds like someone should use them a bit more, wouldn’t you think?”
When Owl came back a couple of hours later with fresh bandages, he told her his idea.
John watched as he walked out of the room. The guard came back to follow him to his cell. When the guard asked if he was okay, he couldn’t answer. He was too nervous of what to expect when he got back to Sherlock.
Sherlock pushed him backwards until he felt the wall press against his back, making the stitches get stuck in his jumper. It brought him back to reality for less than a second before Sherlock found his throat. He tried to say something, but the only sound he seemed to be able to make was tiny whimpers as the detective’s tongue left wet trails from his shoulder to his jaw, switching between sucking and biting on his skin.
“Are you mad at me?”
“And you want me to tell you if I’ve ever met this person?” Irene’s expression emitted a dangerous feeling of secrecy. Her eyes flickered to John for a millisecond before returning to Sherlocks icy stare.
“They’re in London,” he informed as Jim peered at the small screen. It showed a man with the wings of a red-tailed hawk carrying a scrawny-looking man into a hospital.
“I will, miss Adler,” John felt a lot better. He’d never thought Irene would be this helpful. He looked down at the feather he’d plucked out again before handing it over to the dominatrix. “Here,” he said. “As a thank you.”
“Bloody, that’s for sure,” she stretched out a hand to touch it, but seemed to stop herself. “Nothing too serious,” she added quickly to reassure him. “Just a crack in the skin. It’ll heal in no time at all. You should probably be a bit more careful the next time you unfold your wings, though. Give it some more time to stretch, if you know what I mean.”
“Evening, brother mine,” he raised an eyebrow at his younger brother. “I got your text.”
“Of course, it is, John,” she giggled. “Why else would he do this to himself? He was never this bad, even before he met you. I’m afraid he’ll collapse if he doesn’t take a break soon. Oh, John, he misses you terribly.”
John nodded and made his descend towards the ground again. He could have stayed up there forever, but his muscles were already screaming at him for a break.
“No,” she walked over to the armchair again and sat down, crossing her legs. “I’m not saying he’ll never find out,” she continued. “But he doesn’t know at the moment. I certainly won’t tell him. He’s oblivious.”
“Fine! Jesus, just give me some space,” John glared at her, ignoring her happy squeal. She let go of him and took a couple of steps back. He grabbed the hem of the jumper and pulled it quickly over his head, letting the fabric fall to the floor.
“I don’t think he understood it, either, to be honest,” she said. “He’s an emotional one, you know. I’m guessing the reason he called Lestrade was because he didn’t know what else to do. He didn’t know how to react.”
“I can wait for Lestrade, if you want to go to the hospital,” Molly smiled and watched as Sherlock hailed a cab and almost threw himself into it the moment it stopped. He needed John. He couldn’t live without him.
“Marry me?” he whispered making John furrow his brow.
He could get used to this, indeed.
Sherlock couldn’t help but watch as the blade came closer to his eye. He felt like an idiot for leaving the flat. He should at least have told John where he was, just so he might’ve had a chance to find him. But no one was coming. He regretted not giving John a proper kiss before he left.
“What, are you okay? You didn’t,” she paused. “Lose them, did you?”
John shrugged.
He slowly sat down on the floor, still holding the jumper tightly against him, like it was a lifeline. He could hear Mrs. Hudson lower her arm and walk closer to him.
“She’s an assassin, Sherlock.”
And what would he do if he actually did have wings on his back? Giving him to the police seemed wrong, but not saying anything would be worse if John ever got caught. Mycroft would know if he didn’t get him arrested. Which would make it even better to not tell anyone, to be honest.
“Fine. I’ll start combat training, first, then.” John smiled and saw Owl roll her eyes.
“You need it more than me,” he said and lifted his head to look into the detective’s hooded eyes. He gave him a quick peck on his chin before putting his head down again. Sherlock fell silent.
“Are you still mad at me for pointing a gun at you?” John snickered and gave him a friendly punch in the arm.
There was a pause on the other end.
“Great! Could you send me that name?” Lestrade fished his phone out of his pocket and gave her his number.
“Yeah, probably,” John mumbled and dragged the jumper over his head, carefully pushing his wings out of the holes in the back of it.
Sherlock waved him off and sat up. John resisted the urge to walk over and kiss him right there and then.
The car stopped outside Sherlock’s flat. John took a moment to settle his nerves, before stepping out onto the sidewalk. He watched as they drove off down the street when a gunshot was heard from inside. He didn’t waste another moment before charging into the building and up the stairs. More gunshots followed, and for a moment John almost thought Sherlock was fighting someone. That is until he opened the door and watched the detective run around, firing bullets all over the place.
John wondered if he’d be able to sneak up to his room and go to sleep after all, but something made him stay. Instead he grabbed the book he had planned to finish, but didn’t have the time to read with his busy schedule. He sent a quick message to Owl to tell her to come back in a few hours. Sherlock probably wouldn’t move for a while anyway, and since he was the likely cause of his uneasy feeling, it wouldn’t make a difference until he came back to the world of the living.
She plucked a loose feather and let it float to the floor. She checked the bandages and told him she’d have to change them within the next few hours before she left him to his misery.
He picked it up and pulled it over his head again, cringing as the stiches scratched against the fabric. He let a hand run carefully down to where his wings began. It had been a while since he actually felt his feathers. It was a weird sensation. The feathers were tightly pressed into the pockets, which meant they looked almost 2D through the holes, but if you touched them, it was something else entirely. You could feel all the individual feathers against your fingertips.
“They’re in the car.”
“Of course, it was me,” the assassin never took his sight off Lestrade, calculating the man’s every move.
They sat in silence until the door to the room slammed open to reveal a stressed looking Lestrade.
“No, you idiot,” Sherlock paused. John held his breath. He hoped that by some miracle Sherlock hadn't figured out the one thing that would break the code. The thing that would help them in the search for both his old partner and himself. The problem was that the answer was so immensely simple that anyone would be able to think of it. “It's a tattoo.”
“John?” he asked. John didn’t respond, just curled up tighter against him. “The ambulance is almost here. We just need to wait a little bit longer.” John started to breathe harder again. Sherlock felt the fear coming back to him. The relief he felt when the paramedics came running down the alley almost made him want to start sobbing again, but he needed to focus. He helped them get John on the stretcher, which was a bit difficult with the wings and all, but they were able to get him on in the end. They lifted him into the ambulance and drove away, leaving Sherlock and Molly alone.
John shook his head and looked out over the huge field they were standing in. A thin layer of snow covered the ground. It was really cold, and for a moment, he regretted not taking Owl’s offer to fetch him a jumper. She’d brought one anyway. The black fabric was tied around her waist in case he’d need it.
They landed on the outskirts of the city by a small farm. Owl let John down carefully before getting on the ground herself. He almost had trouble standing. The adrenaline was almost gone, which meant the pain was overwhelming. He could feel blood running down his back, and he was beginning to feel lightheaded.
“It’s not that simple,” John sighed and rubbed at his swollen eyes.
“And I’m worried something’s going to happen if I’m not there.”
“That’s something you’ll have to figure out,” John smiled and rushed down the stairs. He stepped out onto the pavement outside the flat. Sherlock came to a stop beside him.
“I don’t want to hear excuses as of why the hell you haven’t been experimenting since I left. Just keep it, okay? What you do with it is your decision. You can put it on a hat, for all I care.”
“You think Sherlock knows?”
“It’s going to be okay, Sherlock,” John choked out. The detective felt completely helpless as he tried to find out where the wound was.
“You could say that,” he started and flipped through the documents. “I thought you’d like to see some old files I have on your dear friend Dr Watson.”
John frowned. No one had visited him since he got here. For a moment he almost thought it could be Sherlock.
The frustration was getting annoying. He had difficulty concentrating on anything, and of course someone had broken into his flat, making everything worse.
“I love you, you know that, right?”
Sherlock was sitting with his knees up under his chin, glazed eyes staring into the shadows outside the window. Inaudible words rolled off his lips every now and then. He seemed dazed and drained, almost fragile where he sat.
“You heard me, doctor,” she snickered.
“I’m getting you out of here.”
“Technically, no, but I prefer that a lot more than my real name. Too many memories from the experimentation days…” John sighed.
“It’s okay if you leave, John,” he mumbled quietly. “If you don’t want to be here, you don’t have to.”
“What?”
“I don’t know,” he said sheepishly and tried to get his heartbeat under control.
for some reason, and that just made it worse. I’m not good with my emotions, John, and I called Lestrade, since I didn’t know what to do, and you were just laying on the floor, not moving, and I didn’t know how to get you up again, so I saw the gun and at least that got you moving, but you looked so empty and not at all like yourself, so I freaked out even more. I didn’t know what I was saying, so I ended up saying something idiotic, and I’m so sorry, John.”
“You love it,” John placed their foreheads together and gazed lovingly into the detective’s blue eyes. Sherlock blinked a few times at the intense stare of his best friend. “Or was it something else you wanted me to do?”
Hopkins steels herself. This is far from the first case of domestic violence she has encountered; when you work in homicide, the two things go hand-in-hand, but it never gets any easier to see the depths humanity can reduce itself to. Sherlock’s cut lip is one thing but the two broken teeth exposed by this hysterical barking of laughter is evidence of a more forceful punch.
Thoughts spinning.
Everyone exhales and, quickly and methodically, goes about their task of caring for the wounded - as if they hadn't just stared their own mortality in the face.

Sherlock rests heavily against John, trying to muster the strength to pull himself together. It's odd how those words work on him; all the sudden he does feel it - feels everything - the cold and the wet and the exhaustion and the pain that he'd been holding at bay all this time. It's intense and immediate, as if his body had just been awaiting permission to feel it. However, at the same time that he becomes aware of his own body, he becomes hyper aware of John's body; warm, solid and pressed against him. Smelling of soap and laundry detergent. Hands firm but gentle, still holding him up. John is maneuvering him to sit on the edge of the bed.
"It’s my Chairman. The police have been on to him. Apparently they’re telling him it was a suicide." He looks up at Sherlock with a raised eyebrow. The ruse is obviously up.
John’s hands tighten on Sherlock’s hips and when he speaks it is the voice Sherlock always fantasized about; deep and gravelly with desperate want.

“Please.”
He's so bloody unmoved that I want to punch that placid, bored look right off of his gorgeous face.
“S’ok. not goin’ do anything. I'm not gay.” John’s eyebrows lift and his lips press together in an expression that looks amused and like it is trying
Sherlock shifts uneasily on his knees. “You are a doctor, I thought you might appreciate some degree of... specificity.”
It sends bubbles of heat rising and popping through his insides.
All the way back to the flat I mentally kick myself for letting an opportunity drop like that. I try to come up with a good excuse for it, but I can't. I consider turning around and going back no less than three times.
"Your time is nearly up." Sherlock pops the p sharply. His voice is crisp and hollow of any emotion. He won't even look at John. He stares out the window as if he'd prefer to be anywhere else.
for all this nonsense.
"You're hurt, let me take care of you."
With that, Sherlock wraps himself tighter in the sheet and, with an irritated huff, flops on his allotted side of the bed as a self-contained cocoon.
, pushing him and Mary together with such adamant determination that John could hardly refuse. But, as often happens with drugs, the effect diminishes over time and the consequences of the temporary escape only compounds the initial problem.
He doesn't get a chance to form a response. His door is pulled open and the same driver is standing there with the air of silent demand that he leave. Irene is completely engrossed in whatever she is doing on her mobile, scrolling and tapping away.
“Worth it,” Sherlock states with a smug smirk.
“So can he, and yet, that's all I do when it comes to you two,” Greg retorts gruffly. He waves John off with a weary expression, looking very much the overworked father of two troublemakers. With a quick wave in return John turns and jogs between the hulking buildings searching for Sherlock among the shadows cast by bins and rubbish.
Everything about this situation is frustrating, confusing, and overwhelming. He wants to scream, to throw something, or to have a smoke... but there's no time for that right now. There's no time to analyse or to plan a proper response to John's invasion of his heart, his mind, and his life.
“I’m fine, John,” Sherlock asserts. “Do you honestly think I would let you do anything to me I didn’t want you to? I am hardly-
“You make it sound like I forced myself on you-”
“We are going to
isn't you... Get away from Victor. If you need help, I'm here. When you are better... I could use the help of Sherlock Holmes on a few cases.” Sherlock squints at her, swaying slightly, letting her words sink in.
Then there was the Negging - the way Sebastian had casually undermined Sherlock’s usual confidence with insults. I hadn't seen this tactic since a fellow soldier in the army, Murphy, who swore by it as the surefire way to catch the attention of ‘the really hot ass’ by subtly making them feel like rubbish.
“Are you sure, Sherlock? I mean… we don't
__________5_______________
John stands there in nothing but his pants as Sherlock peers in the door, waiting for an answer.
There can be no mistake about it; the way her gaze dips and drags over him and the way she's moving her body - inviting him to look at her.
“What are you looking for?” John’s head is tilted to the side and his somewhat amused smile is made soft by his sleepy, half-lidded eyes. They’re bluer when framed by his blonde lashes like this. There's no less than five distinct colors; sapphire, aegean, cerulean, slate, and lapis. Is that prussian blue as well? Prussian blue; produced via oxidizing ferrous ferrocyanide salts. It's a cure for certain kinds of poisoning… And when did John move so close?
"So?"
I want to make sure-" John stops and pointedly drags an assessing stare over Sherlock. Then he swallows and nods, as if deciding to do something he knows he probably shouldn’t. "I'm gonna need to make sure you're alright. Ok?" He turns to square himself to Sherlock as if prepared to argue with him over this.
Sherlock's sits in the hard plastic chair and rocks back and forth, movements so small they are imperceptible to anyone watching him but enough for Sherlock to find them soothing despite the way it makes his backside and ribs ache. The rhythmic movements chase away the words etching a groove into his mind, swirling and swaying. Each time he captures them and pins them down, they ease out of his grip and begin their looping journey once again:
“Sherlock.” John's voice is too soft - sounds too much like pity. Sherlock thinks, not for the first time, that it is a travesty of evolution that humans aren't able to spit venom or shoot sharp quills in defense like other creatures. What atriciously feeble, insufficient, unimaginative vessels homosapiens have. He glares up with all the fire he can muster to incinerate John set within his eyes.
Holmes can handle it himself.” John's voice is bitter. “Goddamn idiot,” he mutters.
When you deduced that she had a suitcase from a splash pattern on her leg I wanted to snog you senseless. Might have done, dead body be damned, if Lestrade wasn’t standing there. You turned my world on its head and I’d have followed you anywhere from then on.
The washroom is large and, as I step in and pause to scan the place to ensure it's empty, Sebestaion moves past me, already pulling himself out. Startled, I glance at Sherlock, but his eyes are cast down at his own feet, his whole face now darkened. It's not that I haven't seen my fair share of
a bit obvious, I know, but...” He shoots Sherlock a sideways glance, “You looked…
“So you've already stated. No one asked,” Sherlock says with practised indifference. In truth, the words are a bucket of cold water dousing that warmth that had begun to pull him under its spell. His signals are obviously crossed, to think that John wants to touch him. It is mortifying to think that John has somehow figured out his misconception.
I'm surprised when Sherlock begins with something of a compliment; observing that Sebastian is doing well and deducing he has been around the world twice in one month. I consider for a moment what could have given such information away, but can't come up with anything.
“Don't -”
He carefully slips under the covers and lays on the edge of John’s bed, facing him. He takes a moment to just breathe the scent of him in, to feel the weight and heat of him so close within the intimate darkness.
where that painful moment of rejection that had re-defined everything
Henry hovers closer and looks down at his body on the operating table. It looks small and broken. He has seen much death in this war, far too much, and he can’t feel anything for that empty shell. He turns back towards the door.
"Protecting you from further harm-"
if they weren’t so appallingly
“Means?” Sherlock repeats sharply, because this really is too much to bear. John can’t turn back now. “I explained this…
“Bed, John?” Those words shot from Sherlock’s mouth are the snare that now binds John.
Sherlock reflexively recoils, opening his eyes.
“You can't be here,” Watson says sharply to the man standing in the corner without looking up from where he's scribbling notes in the chart. When the man doesn't move or respond, Watson glances up at him. His face is mostly in shadow but Watson can tell he's wearing what must be a very expensive long coat, has dark hair and pale skin and he seems to be looking steadily back at Watson. Probably some posh boy with a rich family who came direct to officer rank through the college route - will never see a day on the front line in his life and had never heard the word 'no' either. Watson sighs in frustration and looks down at the chart again. “I said that you can't be here. Not without escort.”
“Deceased. Hardly a threat to anyone anymore.” There is an eye roll in his words that reminds me that,
"Here, I'll get that."
John has two more buttons undone on his shirt and has made it to the bathroom door when he hears the loud thud in the sitting room. He hurries back to find Sherlock sprawled on the floor, desperately trying to get to his hands and knees. He has John's hastily discarded coat clutched in one hand.
Sherlock stares at me a long moment, the wheels clearly turning rapidly behind his blank expression. Then he returns his gaze to his phone, and once more begins to scroll purposefully. “Not Urdu or Hebrew.”

“That’s a bit…
He pushes open the door and steps inside, his body tingling with anticipation and fear. The stairs loom before him like the last mountain he must scale on an arduous expedition and he feels strangely empty; those cancerous emotions bled out but now he is left hollowed and waiting for something new to fill the void. He stands there, naked, nothing but his raw, fragile, newly resensitized form to set against the gift John has given him.
"There's no reason to fight this," he repeats over and over insistently until it loses meaning and just becomes sounds, like some ancient chant. It wears down my resistance.
Eventually Sherlock stops moving and pants into the mattress.
and twelve is what you got.”
Silence is damning. Silence is impotence and resignation; a declaration that Sherlock is irreparably flawed beyond hope of salvation. A tortuous condemnation; a quiet scorn pregnant with John's guilt, shame and oppressive defeatism. Humiliation and the fear that he has at last done something that John deems
when matters proceed...
It seems to me you're deflecting, John. Are you trying to avoid the topic?"
Sherlock's eyes narrow further. His gaze moves over John's face for a moment; calculating.
I will remind you, I consented. I am an
He moves to lay on top of Sherlock but Sherlock throws out a hand between them.
I turn my head to glance over at Sherlock and just catch him turning his face away and looking down. He isn’t quick enough to hide the momentary flicker of intimate pain over his features. I’ve only seen a hint of that expression once before, when he spoke of Mycroft's past betrayals.
going to let this go. However, as his mind wades back through the haze of their interaction thus far, Sherlock realises that this is perfectly in character with the limited knowledge he has about what John is like when he's
“Irrelevant.” Sherlock sweeps his concerns away with a wave of his hand, like pesky mosquitoes. He keeps his stare cold and barbed; fiercely demanding. “Me. Sex. Approximately one meter to your left. That's enough to be going on about, don't you think?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, you found your words.” He strains as they start down the stairs and he has to work to counterbalance the gangly detective to keep them both from pitching forward and tumbling head first. “I was just getting used to finishing whole sentences,” John laughs. Sherlock’s head sags against his chest and lulls from side to side.
So much had happened in those weeks since our last appointment. Yet, many of those incidents are things I wouldn't dare to share with her even
It makes him shudder and take a step back.
Feeling of heat in leaning into John.
Angelo’s smells as delicious as he always remembers it. The scent of rich sauces and fresh spices envelopes Sherlock the moment he steps in the door and his stomach gives a grumble of anticipation. He looks down, puzzled, trying to recall when he’d eaten last. Some sweet, flaky thing Hopkins had shoved in front of him at the coffee shop. She has John’s skill for slipping food under his nose when he is deep in thought. He hardly realizes he is eating until he finds his hand reaching for an empty plate of its own accord and the taste of food lingering on his lips and tongue.
John freezes with his hand hovering over the knob. Stunned, he blinks a few times and cocks his head to the side, certain he must be imagining things.
He can't scream and he can't cry and he can't save one fucking person.
with a
“Colleague,” I cut off my own train of thought to contradict them. I lift my chin slightly and force a nuetral expression.
“John?” Sherlock’s whisper sounds loud in the silent room.
from tonight, please let it be
“Nurse,” Watson shouts and two nurses rush to his side. One helps to restrain the wounded young man and the other assists Captain Watson in slipping a mask on him so that they can get him back under sedation. The Private continues to struggle, mindlessly fighting those trying to help him, a drowning person panicking and defeating efforts at rescue.
at the time of the original incident, he presently appears to be aroused at recalling the struggle with John.
- trying to do better... It feels like shit at first but it gets better.” She shrugs. “Start feelin’ a bit more worthy of that forgiveness after while.” Sherlock nods slowly, mulling it over. They stand in silence for a few moments and it is surprisingly comfortable.
"Wait. Tied up? Why would I be tied up?"
keys clacking rapidly and seeming unnaturally loud in the quiet room.
“Christ, Sherlock. Christmas day I was just-”
The car pulls up outside 221B and John commences hauling his drugged friend out of the car while Anthea does her best to ignore their existence. He mutters goodbye, though he knows she will neither hear nor respond, then he props Sherlock against himself and guides him inside.
The tension breaks when Sebastian’s phone beeps a text alert.
I was
John saved him. Always John. John keeps him-
in every sense of the word and trying desperately to hide it.
him... It’s not that easy,” Sherlock says after a moment. Donovan sighs and crosses her arms, looking down with her expression dark.
With that look from John, for the first time he feels a potential advantage in this situation. He sees a workable plan.
"Sorry, what did you call him?" John says in a low, hard voice that sends a shiver through Sherlock's frame. It's is mercifully hidden by his coat. Sherlock drags his eyes over and finds John stepping towards Donovan with eyes narrowed, fists balled at his side and his chest a bit puffed out. His jaw is so tight that the tendons stand out in his neck and the quiet fury radiates off of him in waves. In any other moment Sherlock might admit to himself that it's a tiny bit sexy to see John like this (and, indeed, he feels a mortifying sharp throb down low that nearly forces a sound out of him), but right now all he can feel is alarm, confusion and an edge of panic.
Struggling.
…” His fingertips bite into Sherlock’s flesh as he pulls Sherlock closer.  “Mmmm… please, Sherlock.” He voice is fervent lust and his breath is so wet and hot curling into Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock shudders. How could he ever deny that voice
“Why didn’t you say something? I mean… people would understand you better... Wouldn't be so harsh.” Sherlock's laugh is acrid. He glares up at him from over his knees.
“There isn’t a scratch or bruise on this one. Whoever beat up Victor Trevor did a very thorough job; the doctors counted at least twenty two separate blows to his head alone. Massive force. His eye sockets are broken, his nose is broken in three places and his jaw is fractured. You can barely stand, much less pummel a man with that kind of force. Whoever did this to Mr. Trevor will have the wounds on his own hands to show for it; hands covered in blood and probably with a number of fractures or broken knuckles themselves. Your hands tell me you didn’t do this, Sherlock. Tell me who did.”
There is a small aside at the bottom noting that the guard was initially uninjured but disappeared a day later. It is thought that, in shame for his failure to protect the girl, he has taken his own life, as is the tradition for such a dishonour.
“However,” Sherlock interjects brightly to head off the apprehension taking over John’s features “I have heard it is a simple formula; affection times purity times intensity times duration... I excel at formulas, John,” he smirks.
It took John far too long to decide he should break away; feeling somewhat faint as he drew back. He suspected he couldn't blame
"Er.. Yeah…" John squints up at him. He glances over his shoulder at the door then at Sherlock, shifting uneasily. "Yeah, I've been here."
Sherlock ignores it.
“Mmmm, ok.” And suddenly John is up, off the floor, and lumbering over the footboard. He flops clumsily into Sherlock's bed with a harumph.
"Oh. So, she's-” John blinks, trying to contextualize his brief encounter with Irene within everything new Sherlock just revealed. She's a dominatrix. Her innuendos now make much more sense. What would have happened if he hadn't brought Sherlock up to her? How literal was she when she said that Mary was
Mycroft sighs heavily, closing his eyes for a few seconds, as if it all has become painfully clear.
Sherlock growls his displeasure. He continues to pull at John’s shirt as John feels around the edges of the lump. John moves the hair in different directions to get a better view of the scalp there to assure himself there aren't any open wounds. Satisfied, John pulls his hands away.
(cockroaches) when the light switch is flipped. He is suddenly fearful of where this is all going.
John moves back proportional to Sherlock's own advancement, keeping a careful distance between them. His demeanor is tense but controlled, like a primed weapon. It manages to make his retreat look like it is for Sherlock's protection rather than an attempt to evade what has become a slow chase around the bed.

I purse my lips a moment to keep my instinctive reaction in check. I stare her down, considering my words carefully. I can't afford to let anything show. Sherlock had said on my first night in 221B that the flat is full of cameras and listening devices spying on everything; enemies waiting for confirmation that Sherlock and I mean enough to each other for me to be used to control or destroy him.

In the ten months he's gone he starts to show sines of just how sick he really is. The two months of torture definitely didn't help, but thinking about John helped, he misses him so much it hurts, but John is safe so it doesn't mater. When he was finally rescued, he is immediately rushed to some sort of intensive care unit where he promptly passes out. He doesn't know how much time has passed since he was last awake, but it must have been a while. He sites there in a bland white room hooked up to all sorts of monitors, he hates every second. A nurse comes to check on him at some point, noticing that he's awake pages the doctor, asks some questions that answers but doesn't really paying any attention to, and then leaves once the doctor arrives. After god knows how long the doctor leaves, but unfortunately Mycroft walks in right after. He refuses to answer any questions about what happened and instead states that everything has been handled. They lapse in to silence for a moment. "John wants to see you." Mycroft finally informs "What?" "He's upset, for good reason, but concerned." "He shouldn't even know I'm alive." "He's smarter than anticipated. He contacted me a few months after your 'Death' and insisted in helping. He's the reason we managed to get you." He what?! I told you to keep him safe! Letting him get involved is the opposite of that!" "He was going to go find you with or with out my help, in this case letting him get involved was the better option. I know you have some form of sentiment for him, despite what I have warned you of regarding it..." "Yes, yes sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side. Your point." "Just be careful brother of mine." Then the conversation shifted to what all had happened after he had been found, how long he was out, and how long he would be needing medical assistance. Finally Mycroft started to depart, on his way out he turned and said "John will be visiting sometime tomorrow." and left. The net day around twelve or so an angry John Watson opened the door. He had figured John would be mad, but the intensity of his furry was jarring, and rather upsetting. John yelled ,cursed, and said the cruelest things  imaginable for a few hours, and then left without even a backwards glance. It had broke his heart. For three days only Lestrade and Mycroft had bothered to stopped by. Then four days after John had tore his heart to shreds, a soft hesitant knocking on the door filled the small room before a meek looking John opens it, he slowly steps in and takes a seat near the corner of the room. "What are you doing here?" "I'm sorry, for the bloody awful things I said. I didn't mean a word of that." "Then why say it?" " Because I was hurt and...damn it I'm shit at talking about these things, but I care about you... a lot, some times it..it scares me. First you pulled that whole suicide stunt, then I find out you left me to go off to god knew where doing dangerous shit. Then I find you captured, being tortured,.. dying. There was so much Sherlock..I..I just...I was scared for you and hurt that you left me...I  shouldn't have said what I said. I'm sorry."

against the world . Some months after the long deleted appointment Mycroft lets him self in while John is out. One look at his brother is enough to know what this little meeting is about,he used his 'minor' position in the British government to see the test results from the appointment, and they are not good. They sat in silence for a few moments before Mycroft spoke "It was caught early enough that if you had started a treatment it probably wouldn't have caused to much damage."  He replied with "Well isn't that boring." They don't look at etch other for what feels like a long time, but they talk for the first time in a long time. By the time Mycroft leaves they had come to an agreement, he will seek treatment in one month, and Mycroft wont tell anyone, or try and mother hen him. His one month of freedom is grand, two locked room murders, a serial arsonist, and of course John. They run all over London at odd hours, eat take away, bicker almost affectionately. When he finally starts treatment he struggles to keep it a secret, Lestrade choses the day of his second round of treatment to put his detective skills to use. He doesn't bother trying to lie, after an hour of awkward questions and tense conversation Greg leaves with the promise not to bring it up and to stop by with some cold cases sometime during the week. Soon it feels like everyone in his life but John finds out about his poor health, Molly catches him going to a treatment, and Mrs.Hudson finds him throwing up in the living room, John is the only one who hasn't found out but he's worried about him and suspicious that something is wrong. But they still investigate crimes, chase leads and criminals, and eat out together. so despite everything for a time it's great, but then things take a turn, things escalated, and soon people he cared about were in danger. So he falls, for a moment it felt like flying.
John didn't seem to register what Sherlock just said or as Sherlock thought, he didn't care. He quickly pulled his hands back. "Umm, I mean, purely in a friendship," he struggled to find an end to his sentence. The true meaning of the words still hung in the air. He started to turn around and go to his bedroom, where he kept something that was stronger than a seven percent solution.
Sherlock looked up at him—but John knew it wasn’t the real Sherlock—and gave him the tiniest smile. “Simple, really,” Sherlock said. John nodded. When would his brain leave him alone? He knew it wasn’t real. He knew.
It was a kiss between to broken men, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. It was a kiss that would become the first of many. It was a kiss they’d always remember, along with the with a new ring on Sherlock’s finger and the one up at the altar. It was a kiss to start a lifetime, a lifetime of hardship and beauty, and most importantly, love. Because that’s the reason Sherlock wanted the chance for.
“So, Sherlock, why did you call me? I was about to start the dishes,” Mrs. Hudson said.
"I never knew when your birthday was."
“Mary, listen,” he began. “We need to talk.”
"I only mean, why must it be so hard for people to understand that, well, for you to understand that," he paused again. "That I...I love you, John Hamish Watson."
John stared at Sherlock. “You’re starting sound more like Sherlock, not quite, but close.” John let his head hang and choked out a laugh. “First time I saw you, I genuinely thought it was you. But I’m not falling for this again. It’s too much.”
John stared at Sherlock. Once Mrs. Hudson entered the living room, she saw John and a smile spread across her face.
John looked up, but there was nobody there. Another hallucination, John thought. But he was wrong.
“I never told you about him,” John said, rubbing the back of his neck.
That wasn't exactly what John was hoping for. At least, he knew they'd always be friends.
“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock shouted. John laughed a pained laugh again. “She won’t come. You’re a hallucination, she can’t hear—” John was cut off by footsteps.
"Yeah," John said, disappointment in his voice. He was stupid to have thought that maybe, just maybe, Sherlock might feel the same way about him. He tried to turn and walk away, but Sherlock's hands flew back to John's arms, holding him in place. Sherlock sighed with great force, struggling to say what needed to be said.
In the car, John said he had to stop at the surgery. Mary dropped him off there and John walked towards Baker Street, once the car had pulled away. John made his way up the 17 steps and sat down in his chair. He could feel the tears stinging his eyes, but pushed them away.
“May I ask who?” Mary said.
“Oh, nothing. Just an experiment. Leave now, please,” Sherlock replied, waving his hand through the air.
It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t the promise of a life time of perfection. It wasn’t what books and movies made it seem to be.
“Yeah, it has. Nice to see you.”
"Why?" Sherlock asked. All John could think at this was how Sherlock always had to make things difficult. "Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand," John said, looking away. He couldn't look into his eyes while telling him to go and love somebody else.
“Him?” Mary asked. John nodded. “I guess, that’s one thing I didn’t observe.”
“You should really be more attentive. Somebody else could have just come in and killed you,” John said, serious but in a joking-manner.
“It never did,” Mary said. “I don’t know who we were kidding. I pride myself in my observational skills and I could see you were hung up on somebody. I thought I could get you to forget about them.”
"Just text her back," was all John could say. He could feel his insides tying around each other, but knew that Sherlock deserved happiness, even if it was with somebody else.
“This is for the best,” John whispered. “One last time,” he said, even quieter. He patted the arms of his chair before he stood. He turned and in the kitchen John saw Sherlock again.
Sherlock, growing more and more solemn during John's speech, asked, "What?"
He ran up the 17 steps and burst into the living room. Sherlock, who was sitting his chair, immediately jumped up. John didn’t stop walking, he made his way to Sherlock and went straight for his lips.
Sherlock shrugged. “I meant to surprise you, but you were going to propose so…”
"Why must everyone be an idiot," he said under his breath. Joh cringed in Sherlock's arms and Sherlock's gaze snapped up. Not a great thing to say in this situation, Sherlock thought to himself.
It's quiet for a long moment after John's outburst. There's only the sound of the pavement under the tyres and John's own heart in his ears. The momentary flare of anger has burnt out leaving him hollow and defeated. He scrubs a hand over his face. He feels the exhaustion of this evening settling into his bones.
Captain Watson at last breaks the spell by looking down at his own hands and the whole world lurches forward again in a cacophony of motion and sound. The figure blinks and blinks, trying to recover.
She really has quite lovely, soft, brown eyes which she keeps lowering demurely. Her glossy black curls are pulled back into a tight bun but I can almost imagine how beautiful she would look if she let it down. Maybe with those curls fanned out on a pillow-
Sherlock mentally takes stock of what provoked this reaction. The need for adaquate distraction had reached epic proportions today. While the resulting experiments had been fairly productive, Sherlock can sense that John is not pleased with the somewhat hazerdous state of dissaray that has overtaken their sitting room. Papers are strewn across every surface next to piles of smashed Christmas ornaments; separated by material, color and size of shards. The weapons and blunt objects that caused the related damage are laid out beside each pile.
He is startled by the door of 221A popping open and Mrs. Hudson rushing out.
I say slowly. "Not flashbacks."
“You're
He feels more than a little smug that of all things Sherlock deigned
Sherlock steps back, eyes going wide in horror, as they drop to stare at John's shadow slipping under the door, like an intruder that intends to invade, no matter what Sherlock does to try to prevent it. He twists to look at the room behind him. His eyes find the window. For a solid minute, he has the wild thought that he could bolt for the window, dive through it, climb down the fire escape, run across the lawn, and never look back. He has it all mapped out in his head. Between work for Mycroft and NSY, he has just enough knowledge and connections to live on the lamb for several years. Not exactly an
“I didn’t have much of a filter to begin with.” He dares to glance up from under his fringe at John and offer a small smirk.
” John inquires glancing at the dingy wallpaper he'd seen a thousand times before. Sherlock looks around, beaming with child-like joy.
“We are over.” Sherlock says flatly. Victor stares at him a long moment, holding his breath, apparently anticipating more from the confrontation. Then he starts laughing; a high pitched sort of wheezing thing that appears to cause him pain. When he cuts off his eyes are dark and full of disgust but beneath them Sherlock can see the tiniest shadow of fear. He believes Sherlock put him in this state and for someone who is always used to being powerful it must be terrifying to have the tables turned.
but I know… I know what we
“Oh,” John says, lifting one eyebrow. The precocious grin that curls up his lips and the sudden spark in his eye could be mistaken for flirtatious if Sherlock didn’t know better. “Well, I certainly appreciate all your restraint so far.”
Off you go my lovely Breath4Soul, weave your magic
John just can’t imagine a scenario where Sherlock would come up to his room, crawl into his bed and, with as easily as it all had gone, been fully prepared and intent on having the hottest sleepy sex he’d ever experienced.
“Gerbils,” Sherlock states placidly but there's an air of frustration leaking into his voice.
“You still don't get it, genius?” She sighs, looking away for a moment. “See, I tried to do
Sherlock gives a slow shake of his head again. His downcast eyes drift to John's bare legs. John clears his throat. He looks into John's eyes. “It - It makes very little sense,” He admits with some difficulty. John lets the silence hang for a moment, as if expecting more, but Sherlock hasn't processed it enough to form it into words. Finally, John breaks the silence, pressing on, almost cheerfully.
________________12________________
For a breath he just stares into the camera.
He lets his eyes slide over to where John had stood that first day. He remembers the thrill that sparked in the base of his spine and lit up his brain like a firework.
Sherlocks shoulders shake, something between a laugh and a sob, and he realizes there is a warm, wet path of tears down each cheek. He clutches his note and turns away from Andy, mumbling a thank you. Andy nods and leaves him quietly. Sherlock takes a deep breath before he opens the folded piece of paper.
