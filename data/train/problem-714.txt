Mycroft                     "Escaped?" I look at Greg in horror. "Was anyone injured? Are there any leads?"
Sherlock                   My hand squeezes John's shoulder, about to speak when I hear noises from the stairs leading up. With a few strides I'm to the door, peering up the stair case before ducking back in, "Brother. Rose Marie seems to have woken my hives. I need to check on them. I'll be in touch about the databases."
Mycroft                     "Good afternoon, John. I was just chatting with my brother about some things that concern you."
Greg                            "Uh, yeah, sure. Let me just hold Molly from heading off." I said after a minute of debating it, deciding to at least let him in professionally and we sorted it out that I was zipping back the body bag for him, so he could have a look.
Greg                            We were both in the car a few minutes after I got the text and even though the area was 20 minutes away, we got there rather quickly to find officers waiting for us to guide us to where Sebastian could have run. He knew he'd been spotted and darted.
Sherlock                     My phone beeps, reaching for it besides the bed. As soon as I scan my eyes over it I'm leaping out of the covers, prompting a grumble from the John shaped heap on the other side. "Murder John." I'm already throwing my clothes on before pausing, real regret in my voice, "You need to stay to look after Rose." With slightly less enthusiasm now I dress, leaning to kiss him goodbye before I'm out the door and into a taxi to take me to the scene
Mycroft                       I pull Greg onto his back, my hand on his chest as I kiss him. "Shall I stay?" I ask quietly, looking into his soft brown eyes.
Mycroft                       We manage to guide Greg to my car with minimal protest from him - he really is out of it - and I get into the driver's seat. To my surprise, Sherlock climbs into the passenger seat beside me.
Mycroft                       "I am merely a civil servant, Mrs. Price." I reply politely. "I would love to stay and chat more, but I have an urgent matter that needs my attention. Perhaps another time?" I say hopefully, as I try to escape with a little dignity still intact.
Mycroft                     "You make no secret of your ability, so if that is the case, you are likely in less danger. My ability, however, is not so obvious... I may well be more at risk than you are." I say, somewhat distant.
Seb                        I shouted myself as I came, digging my hands into his back and my hips gave way more than anything when I'd stopped shaking. I felt his hot breath on my neck and entangled our legs together to just enjoy the serenity of the moment.
Greg                            "Hello you." I smiled at him slowly getting dressed, frowning at doctors that were waiting outside his room to obviously speak to me. I’m guessing a little 'chat' had gone on at some point.
Mycroft                     "Yes. Baker Street is constantly monitored." I avoid Sherlock's surprised glare.
Mycroft                       "May I come in? I'd rather not discuss this on your front steps. You may unceremoniously throw me out afterward, if you wish."
Sherlock                   I poke my head back around the door, barking out, "If John needs anything personal dealt with, he'll come to me, thank you very much, brother."
Greg                             "Bet Sherlock was confused with what was going on with me yesterday..." I grunted as I shifted myself into his passenger seat, needing to take a moment for a breather and waved that he didn't have to watch me. He could get in.
Sherlock                     "Indeed." I glance at the driver, knowing Mycroft would have sent someone discreet, before lowering my voice anyway. "You were conceived when I was in America on business. I never knew you existed but recently my brother tracked you down and reunited us." The story was close enough to the truth for Rosie to remember it and act the part
Mycroft                     I put my hand on John's shoulder. "Did he tell you anything else?" I am beginning to wonder if somehow, Sherlock actually spoke to John while he was in a dream state.
Mycroft                     I huff. "Love? Lust, more like it. I am glad to hear that Mr. Parsons' involvement was only incidental. However, I may increase surveillance on him, just in case Seb decides to make a reappearance."
Greg                            "If we do this together, I need to see the footage too. I'll drop by my office and speak to Molly, get the tattoo photographed and we can work together in your office. Deal?" I said professionally as I swung my coat on and left a tip for the Barista who was still watching us cautiously with how pale Mycroft had gone.
"She will be cared for. I have already made arrangements." I reply coldly, turning to leave the office and head down to the car, where I knew Sherlock and Greg were waiting.
Dave the Druggist       Inside is a large and modern looking warehouse, surgically clean and tidy. Shelves line the way containing boxes that are labelled with long, complex names, each one packed with packages of pills, powders and liquids
Greg                            "Shit. Mycroft, do you have any idea how to turn this off? Our distraction is only going to work for so long." I stressed with Moriarty’s face freaking me out, my eyes stressing that we could argue about me being here later. Now wasn't the time.
Greg                             I shake my head and get up angrily from the chair, scribbling a note for Mycroft that I was just heading out for ingredients for something for dinner. I shouldn't be too long and I left it on the kitchen counter as I rushed out. I knew he would still be there by the time I got there in a cab.
Sherlock                     For once I seem in no mood to argue. In fact, I remain quiet, eyes dead in my blank face. I don't struggle or even resist, just stumbling along besides him, through the corridors of NSY towards the car
Greg                            "Exactly, and I'll be here with you all the way." I almost grinned where he shut his eyes again and I took the chance to step out and phone John to see how he was getting on with Eurus. Seb was going to be transferred from the hospital soon and I wanted to question him some more.
Moriarty               I push his cheeks together and thrust a few times before I smack them. "Turn over." I kneel up just enough, so he can flip to his back.
Greg                             "Sure. You can use the shower first while I sort out coffee and some toast." I said as I slipped my dressing gown on, it saving any embarrassment incase Mrs. Price decided to come knocking to speak to me about the noise from last night.
Sherlock                     Taking the tissue, I blow my nose, allowing her to see my puffy, red eyes under my untidy mop of hair, "I couldn't even save my John. He left me and got himself blown up. What hope do I have with a child?"
Sally                            I light his smoke. "Oi I'm sure he knows. He just don't care." I shrug. "Happens. Lotsa times when an addict relapses the family just gives up on 'em. Looks like he finally got done with you."
Sherlock                   "So what do you have protecting the ocean?" Pausing by one of the doors, I bend to peer at the retina scanner, careful to not look into it to activate it, "That's the problem with Mycroft. His nose is always turned to the skies, so he often fails to notice what's under his feet."
Greg                            "You’re gonna have to save pleasantries for later boys, you've got guards rushing around and they might come your way..." I stressed where I then heard Sherlocks voice over John's microphone and even switched to stress it in Mycroft’s earpiece that they needed to get out of there.
Mycroft                       "First, a quick stop at Baker Street," I say quietly, as we walk to the garage. I open the door of the blue Mercedes, and motion for him to get in the passenger seat. Opening the garage door, I start the engine up and pull out of the garage, heading toward my brother's flat.
Mycroft                     "The office is soundproofed, true, but not for this reason" I thrust my hips against his, bringing an obscene groan from him. "That is just a happy coincidence." I reach between us and start unbuttoning his jeans.
Mycroft                     "I doubt he would go to Musgrave, but I would like to check on my parents..." I say, hopeful that he would agree.
John                            “Why wouldn’t you meet her? I told you yesterday. I don’t want to do ANY part of this without you.” I reach out to take his hand.
Sherlock                   "John..." My voice sighs in relief, before I start trying to make my way towards his voice. "This is real."
Mycroft                     "I understand from Anthea that she is technically a runaway at this point." I say quietly. "We are working with New York authorities to clear things up, of course."
Seb                        I moan into my arm as he starts massaging my shoulders, them tight where I'd been working so tirelessly with John and Mary before deceiving them. I kept my hips still but loved the love bites he was leaving all over me.
John                            Whipping around, I pull my gun back out, pointing it down the hall. Two figures turn down the hall, raising their hands up. “Hey! We’re on your side.” One of the guards calls. “Mrs. Lipton, the cook. She sent us to find you.”
Sherlock                   My head flies up, grumbling a little and pushing my laptop away, stalking towards the door down the stairs. John was taking this whole 'hiding because he's dead' thing with far too much humour, especially when it comes to things such as me opening the door. I swing the door open, barking, "Yes?"
Mycroft                     I get up off the floor, and walk to my brother. "Sometimes, things are beyond our control. Moriarty made his decision long before we arrived, I'm afraid." I take a deep breath, patting him on the shoulder. "Is there anyone else here who needs our help?"
Mycroft                       After he'd finally fallen asleep, I managed to slip out of the bed and the room, heading to my office to get my phone. I send a text to my brother.
Sherlock                   My heart sinks more, clattering down the steps until I reach the main rooms. With a chill, I open the first door, striding into the wood paneled parlour where once myself, Mycroft and Eurus played as children. My eyes fall on the figure seated on the chair, his head rolled back, still dressed in his comfortable old clothes, pipe in his mouth, newspaper over his chest. My hand reaches out, touching his neck. His skin is cold and rubbery, long dead.
Greg                      I worked until the early hours looking through Scotland Yard files, only finding one or two lines about a supposed Moriarty but even that wasn't reliable. I also looked into Seb's background with the same outcome and I arrived to Mycroft’s office in a grey waistcoat on top of a white shirt, grey trousers and my long officer’s coat on top.
Mycroft                     I look up at Rosie, who is watching me with concern. "Are you all right, John? Your daughter and I can be there in about an hour... we've just sat down to breakfast..."
Mycroft                     I stopped the film and scrolled slowly back to get a better view of the vehicle that had pulled onto the bridge. "The license plate is a bit blurred, but we should be able to start with a search. The car appears to be an old Reliant - not a common car."
Sherlock                     The slouching, tired figure falls away from me, racing towards the kitchen with alert, bright eyes, "John. It worked."
Greg                            "We need to map out a proper plan if we're to get in. John will have to lead since he knows where Sherlock is and then Mycroft can get us in and out. I can maybe get weapons, night vision cameras so you're not walking in a complete black out." I found a scrap piece of paper and nudged Mycroft to start jotting down a few things. We were going to do this properly.
Mycroft                     The helicopter had to make several trips between the island and the medical transport to get everyone off the island, so the rescue was a slow process. John and Sherlock went early, so Sherlock could be seen to quickly, but Greg and I stayed until the last group left. Once we were finally settled on the helicopter, I finally relaxed, resting my head on his shoulder, my arm around his waist.
Sherlock                   I pale slightly, nodding and glancing away, my face thrown into harsh profile by the fire's light, "Lestrade understands the conditions of a relationship with you?"
Greg                            I feel the air being constricted from my lungs as she begins to squeeze my throat, my hands scraping a little at her to make her stop. I feel myself starting to lose consciousness with the lack of air and can still hear Myc shouting for her to let me go.
Greg                            "Sherlock is just as strong as Jim and what are you without a weapon? Huh? Not much, Seb, just someone that does the dirty work and then gets fucked for it." I put a little growl into the smile and then felt Mycroft pulling me back again so he definitely couldn’t get me.
Rosie                           "Umm. Yeah. Papa said I should talk to you. You'll know ALL the answers." I give my most innocent smile.
Sharon Price          I take the tissue, wiping my eyes and snuffling, "It... it sounds like she was like a mother to you, too? I think she used to mention you. Are you George Lestrade?"
Sherlock               I reappear, panting by Lestrade's side. My hands are covered in blood, "He's alive. John is alive. I... I couldn't get to the others. Please, please hurry."
Moriarty               Mmm, it felt nice what Seb was doing. It was both weird and somewhat exciting to give up control. He was my gentle giant, taking his time to touch me. He has a seb-stantially large penis, so I know it's going to take a while to prepare me. "Suck my dick, baby. Show me how much you want me." I could only take not being in charge so long it seems. That's ok. The Sebs of this world need me to tell them what to do.
Rosie                           I grab the change and head off to pet the puppies. Once I'm touching them they all wanna send me pictures thoughts and stuff. "Calm down babies. One at a time, k."
John                            “Um... sure.” I give Sherlock a sideways glance. “It’s actually all posted online. I post to a blog.”
Greg                            "I... I don’t remember being unconscious. They touched me? Who was it?" I frowned as I thought I'd been conscious the whole time and I had scribbled down the number plate with my other hand. I met his eye, my memory seeming blurry.
Greg                            My words were incomprehensible, but his words made his hand around my cock feel warm, just being what I needed and when he started licking behind my ear, I couldn’t hold it back anymore. I know I shouted with the way he was trying to shush me as I came, and it mainly went over his hand with a little on his desk.
Mycroft                     I feel a pang of heartache - decidedly not my own - and look up just as the lift doors close. I look at my brother. He is talking with Mrs. Lipton and walks her to the hall door.
Greg                            "I thought I had more control over it than I thought, so I can only apologise." I shrugged and finally looked up at him again, simply sipping at my coffee where I had wanted to talk about something else to him too.
Mycroft                     I hang up my jacket and sink tiredly into a chair in the kitchen. "Good morning, John," I say as he wanders into the kitchen.
Mycroft                       "I suppose I can try. Once he's fit again, we will talk. If he wants to.”
Sherlock                     "Lestrade", I snap, stuffing my hands deep in my coat pockets, "Where is my brother and why is he not answering his phone? You haven't got him here, have you?"
Sherlock                   Watching the paper burn, my eyes grow intense, "This is a lot to be getting on with. I will ask John to assist me, not in that database," I quickly add, "In the databases you send me. For metas and normals in Lestrade's department and your own."
Greg                      I pushed through to the room myself when again, John was pushing back into the living and once they'd gotten him sort of stabilized again, I held Sherlock's shoulders as he stood by his partner, so the nurse could sew up his shoulder. It looked more like a gunshot wound but I kept quiet.
Greg                             My shoulder was bothering me as I made my way to work but we managed to leave with enough time that I could buy Mycroft another pair of leather gloves that was specially wrapped. I got a raised eyebrow from Donovan but kept walking to my office, coffee in hand.
Sally                            I notice the topic change but guessed it was because of her age, grief and being in a new place so I just smiled softly. "We get to investigate lots of crimes, from burglary to murder and everything in between. We get to do a lot but also help a lot of people." I explained.
Sherlock                     My gaze turns slowly from the window, to my brother, then back to the window, "I'll have to carry him out when we get there also. Or didn't you consider that?"
Mycroft                       "Thank you" I reply, as I get to work cooking, and in short order, put a plate of shrimp scampi in front of him.
Sherlock                   "Sleep." I mutter, curling around John a little and closing my eyes again
John                            “Sherrinford?” I can hear his voice and almost feel his presence around me.
Mycroft                     "Fair enough. We need to stay focused on the task at hand." I nod as we head toward the door. "And for the record, I never claimed I
Greg                             "Just ask Sherlock to give us a bell when he can. Important thing for him to do." I said as I rose from the sofa and smiled politely at John for the rejection of tea, glancing over at Mycroft at Sherlocks apparent resting.
Mycroft                     I scroll through the messages on the phone once more, and notice one message that failed to send... to me. I open it and read it in horror. "Moriarty... I have seen him! He was at St. Bart's, posing as Dr. Hooper's boyfriend, the day Sherlock received the bears and the note." I look up at Greg, tears welling up again. "He's drugged my brother..."
Greg                            "Do you reckon anybody at the club will say anything to you? About what we did in your office?" I asked as we were just a few minutes away from Baker Street and I had imagined other members knew of his sexual orientation, but I didn't want to dob him into anything.
Sherlock                     "What, I should have stood by while you not only ruined your mental and physical health." A jaffa cake vanishes into a spray of crumbs, "...but the first chance you've had at a normal relationship. Ever."
Greg                            "Who do you work for? I know it hurts but it’s really important that you tell me. Important for people's lives here." I urged him to spill the information as I know he wouldn’t be able when he was in the hospital and we needed to find Sherlock sooner rather than later.
Mycroft                     "They have some sort of subconscious connection. John dreamt that Sherlock spoke to him. The thing is, the information Sherlock gave him can only have been real - John had no knowledge of it, so it could not have come from his own subconscious mind." I sit back in the chair. "It seems Moriarty is holding my brother at Sherrinford, where my sister was previously housed."
Sherlock                     My tongue flicks out to my lips again, clearly growing more nervous, glancing around, "Who are you? Wait..." I swing my attention back to him. "You work in Bart's yet are here in a place well known for selling prescription medication… oh, that's smart." I can't help but smirk. "A little side business for someone obviously in IT? What do you do, take the medicines and then use your skills to alter the records before selling them here to those desperate enough?"
Mary                     I gasp as my gun goes skidding off, watching Seb with wide eyes, "Why are you doing this Seb? We're on the same side." John hesitates, then lowers his weapon slightly, his doctor's instincts kicking in to try and get to my side to assess my condition. His gun sweeps over Seb though, still ready to fire at will if needs be.
Greg                            I jump when Sherlock appears in the lift with us and my eyes go to the camera, wondering what the hell the brothers were doing. I listened to Sherlock explain what they had to do, my hand grasping Sherlock’s and I could feel my boyfriend’s mind desperately begging for this to work. I was hoping it was going to work too.
Rosie                           On the way down I see Lock coming out of his room. I run and tackle hug him. "I'm gonna miss you but I'll keep watch over Dad just like you asked." I tug him down til he's at my eye level. "And ya gotta come home. Safe. Got it?!"
Rosie                          "Charlie is my bff. We have all sorts of adventures. During school we sit next to each other and sometimes we pretend we're really at Hogwarts and we can use magic and everything." Charlie is the bestest ever. "I'm gonna be a Ravenclaw and she's gonna be a Hufflepuff."
John                            I snake a hand up to grip his weeping cock. I give him a few lazy strokes brushing my thumb over his slit collecting the precum there. I press a few kisses into the inside of his thigh before biting and sucking to leave a purple mark on his ivory skin.
Sherlock                   With a nod I spring up to grasp my laptop, "I need the names and status of all metas on record. All of them. I also need the names of all normals who may be involved in this, no matter the level. That's your people, Lestrade's people and those who worked with John's team. I know you can get hold of them, no matter how shadowy they are." I continue to fire off quick fire notes, knowing my brother will be able to keep up and store them. "I also need records of all and any deaths of normals, metas and also injuries or sickness in those involved, even in the slightest way in those three areas."
Greg                             I laugh as he pulled my shirt off of me and I made work of his trousers first as mine was only slip on jeans. I kept kissing him and then back to his neck, pushing him backwards until he fell back onto the bed and I could get on top of him again. The only thing apart from his boxers that he was still wearing was his gloves.
Rosie                          I ask the bees what they think of British Government and they say he’s ok, so I go over and pat him on the back as high as I can reach. "Um. Ok. Thank you? Gotta go!" I run off to my room to text Charlie bout how weird English people are and how someone might kill me, so she needs to know I might someday not answer her texts.
Mycroft                       "In the absence of stairs, I would have managed just fine." I huff. "And then the hospital does have staff who can help with such things." I continue looking straight ahead as I drive. "So why are you here?
John                            Bounding up the stairs from Mrs. H’s with my toolbox, I enter the flat into the kitchen. I set my tools on the kitchen table and round the corner into the sitting room. “Sherlock, Sorry! Mrs. H insisted on keeping me for tea after I had a look at her washer-dryer. She... oh hey Mycroft.”
Simon Campbell      "Just her purse and her phone, like usual. Didn't get particularly dressed up - just jeans and a nice blouse."
Mycroft                       I grumble, but he's right. I swing my legs out of bed and get up, walking over to the wardrobe for clothes. Once I'm dressed, I walk downstairs, smiling fondly as I gather up the clothing scattered all over the media room. I am reading the morning paper, sipping at my second cup of coffee, when Greg comes downstairs.
John                            I raise an eyebrow. “That’s not the point. You can’t just go running off whenever you please.”
Mycroft                 I scowled at him. "Don't do that, Lestrade..." I could feel him pushing for the information. "Sebastian Moran was not killed in the explosion." I said simply.
Greg                             "Mycroft... I... I don't want us to fight again." I stop him as he moves to leave, and I meet his eye with sincerity. I slip the glasses from my face, showing him the raw side of me. Again.
Greg                            "Yeah, just finishing off paperwork from where I was in court yesterday. I've only got mugs, is that okay?" I hunted through my desk drawers where I kept near everything and put them on my desk where he was sorting out the take-away boxes.
Greg                            I open my eyes for a moment so they stop hurting from scrunching them shut so hard, my head dipping to look at him licking the head of my cock while he stroked me in time. "I’m gonna be even more beautiful when you realise what's in my coat pocket." I rasped.
John                            “Tell me.” I turn my head to try and find his lips as his hand makes its way inside my shirt, brushing over my chest.
Rosie                          "Bees!! On the roof!!" Probably the same bees I met yesterday. I jump up and grab Locks hand. "Let's go! Let’s Go! Letsgoletsgoletsgo. C'Mon. Hurry up slow poke!!" Once he stands I realize I have no idea how to get up on the roof.
Greg                             "I... I was her neighbor... that's my flat on fire there. She always looked out for me if she knew I was having a late shift... helped me through the period after me and the ex-wife had divorced." I nodded as she pulled back and I gave her a spare tissue I had so that she could wipe her eyes.
Eurus                         My bare feet swing, the only part of me in sight, tucked up in Watson's chair by the fire. I pay no attention to the people entering the ransacked flat
Sherlock                     My palms slide over his, gritting my teeth but keeping my grip firm, long fingers twisting around his wrists
Mycroft                       "You're just a bit dehydrated, too. Drink." I push the water toward him. "The pain medication is doing a number on your balance as well, I suspect."
Sherlock                     "....and then we started collating between the databases and discovered several interesting factors." I've continued speaking even though he's been out of the room, just finishing brewing the perfect cups of tea for us as he emerges. "I am still furious but at least we have the start of a plan now."
Greg                            I know it'd been hard for the both of them being cooped up, my smile sympathetic at John who seemed to be pacing the living room where Rosie must have been with Mrs. Hudson.
Mycroft                     I reach between us and stroke his cock a few times, causing him to arch his back and moan loudly. I could hear the words on the tip of his tongue in my head, and I hoped he could hear them from me, as well.
Mycroft                     "I'm sorry..." I mumble, blinking slowly. "Need to talk to Eurus..." I start to try to sit up.
Greg                            "So then what has Jim done with Sherlock if Eurus had to make it up to him?" I asked and everything was starting to fit into place as he spoke. I kept my weight on his shoulder, wanting to know more about the meds. What they did in all of this or if it was just a side project.
Mycroft                     "That was a long time ago, brother. Lestrade and I have known each other a long time, professionally. We are merely adding another facet to our relationship."
Mycroft                     "There's a first time for everything, Detective Inspector..." I grab his collar roughly and pull him away from the door into my arms.
Mycroft                       I walk out of the interrogation room to find half the department standing outside the door, dumbfounded at the spectacular argument they all overheard. "Greg, can you please take Sherlock to my car - the driver is waiting out front. DS Donovan here can provide me with the paperwork to release Sherlock to my custody."
Mary                     As soon as I step into the room I can sense there's something different, something wrong. A body lies slumped on the floor, dressed in exactly the same armour we're wearing. "John. Get in here, now." The playful fondness is gone from my voice, holding my weapon out to sweep the room as I advance slowly towards the body. "Understood. Getting a lock on your signal and coming in." John cuts off the com, all business.
Mycroft                       I shiver as his lips move along my jaw to my neck, grazing along the skin he uncovers as he opens the top buttons of my shirt.
Mycroft                     "If they need to question you, they will know where to find you-" his lips against mine interrupt me, and I smile slightly.
Mycroft                     "It is what it is, I suppose. I've learned to live with it. Sometimes I miss it, though, the intimacy..." I say wistfully.
Greg                             "I've always been jealous of my brother… he can move objects with his mind, developed it quite early on and he always used to tease me about mine... said it was more of a girl’s power." I nuzzle my head into his neck, knowing he'd had a cigarette after we'd returned with John with the stress of everything. It was making it hard to quit.
Mycroft                     "Yes, my dear. Greg just... got a lead on my brother's whereabouts and needed your father to go with him." I'm only stretching the truth a bit...
Moriarty                   "Shurly." I look around the room and make note to bring a few books or something. "Let’s take a walk." I motion him to follow me as we leave his chambers.
Moriarty                   With my gun now pointing at John, both guards removed, and two guns trained on me, I simply run out of ideas. All but one actually. As I him "Bang bang Maxwell's Silver Hammer..." I turn the gun on myself.
Rosie                          I walk up to Sherlock and poke him in the thigh. "You’re different too?" I turn to Dr. Watson. "Are you??  Will you disappear?
Greg                            "But we don’t really have any submarines at our fingertips to approach Sherrinford." I also commented as I sat down beside Mycroft and took my own biscuit, taking a bite.
Greg                             "Get onto your back then, Mr. Holmes." I said, trying to put on a sultry voice but it sounded more like my voice was sore. I pushed his legs apart with my knees when he did and took the scene of Mycroft naked in front of me for a second before squirting a circle of lube onto my fingers. I dumped the bottle beside me, spreading it with my other hand.
John                            “They are getting on rather well. Too well, it’s almost scary.” I grin. “I’ll have to be careful not to let them take a united front against me.”
Surgeon                Nothing I have done helps. His heart starts to flatline so I look at my watch preparing to call the time of death. I tell the nurse to let the man by the window in, so he can say his final goodbye.
Greg                            "I'm going to give myself an hour before I'll text him to have a look. Just to determine whether there's a link and how come you're here anyway? Just checking up on Rosie?" I asked, flipping my phone over in my pocket.
Rosie                          "Mother told me you were a Captain. Didn't realize she meant Captain Obvious." I roll my eyes. "Unless you're expecting another eight-year-old to appear on your doorstep."
Confirmed Donovan and Anderson are working with Moriarty. She was aware of what John was involved in, when that was restricted to only the highest security clearance. Rose Marie also confirmed that Sally was disloyal and 'smelling wrong', information from the police dogs. -SH
John                            “Oh? I’m I allowed now?” I switch off the TV, tossing the remote down on the sofa.
Greg                            I resisted the urge in grabbing his head, instead putting my hand on his shoulder and moaned as he kissed the inside of my thighs. Nuzzled against my cock and my heart was close to bursting.
Rosie                          "Umm, no. John said maybe you'd help me but it can wait." I bite my lip and wait for him to tell me I'm stupid cause I don't know how to even turn on the stupid machine.
Sherlock                   My brows lift, taking another spoonful of the soup before murmuring, "He mentioned he was providing medical support, for which you were very grateful to him."
Mycroft                     "Coffee and toast is hardly an imposition." I smile. "And I called Anthea to arrange for your car to be towed to a nearby garage... she was kind enough to deliver the clothing and the mail. How is your head, today?"
John                             My mouth drops open and I look back and forth between them. “I... Alright. I guess if you think she’ll help.”
Sherlock                     My head drops, then I let myself slide down the inside of the door, resting my head back onto the cool metal, before finding my voice, "You can do far better than Anderson, Sally." I try not to shiver at her description of his attributes.
Greg                            I begin to start replying when John starts shouting over us and I have to clench my hands now down by my sides, my jaw clenched with my eyes out the window. I have no idea where the kid would have gone, but I'm not letting him kill himself just because I was angry with his brother so pushed past them both to start heading down the stairs.
Mycroft                       "Based on my conversation with Sally, I think we were quite believable. She was positively shocked that I plan to put you on a plane tonight..."
Mycroft                       "Oh, you wouldn't want that..." I gave his cock one long swipe, his fingers curling into my hair. I take his head into my mouth, my tongue swirling over it as I suck gently. I rest my hands on his thighs, to keep him in the chair.
John                             “Your Mother? Well, I don’t know. But if I would’ve known about you, I would’ve wanted you. Wanted to know you. And be there for you.”
Mrs. Lipton             "Alright I'm a bit desperate as I don't think my sister can survive this for long. No, I'm not here by choice, nor is my sister. She is normal, a school teacher. Moriarty heard about my cooking skills and came to talk with me. I have told him no but when he learned about my sister and that she is normal, he kidnapped us both and brought us here."
Mycroft                       "Don't tease, Gregory." I growl, pushing his hand away and pulling him onto his back. I settle between his legs, running my hands down his thighs and under his arse. I grab the lube bottle and apply a generous amount to my cock with a shiver.
John                      I give him a confused look. “Mary?” Then everything comes rushing back. “Mary?! Where is she? Is she alright? Seb...he turned against us!”
John                             “Oh... I guess, yeah. But I never said I didn’t want kids. I just thought... I dunno... that I never would.”
Sherlock               My fingers reach to squeeze his hand, before forcing out the words reluctantly, "And your daughter? I expect you will wish to have more contact with her, now Mary is dead." I try to hold back the disappointment that he never trusted me with the information that he had a child.
Greg                             "Trust is about communication, Mycroft, huh? Why the hell do you think it means so much to me? Why I hate people going behind my back? and no, you didn't have to give me that information and I thank you for that, but you can't hold back all information. I would have actually supported your method, what you found." I growled back and tried to tear my arm from his gloved hand.
Moran                        I had almost skipped into the warehouse as I was getting another batch of happy pills and needed a little worm called Dave just to sign the boring paperwork. I called for him and noticed a few boxes knocked over, my heart feeling like it had frozen when I heard shouts of for myself to get down on the ground. Hands on my head.
Mycroft                     I smile a bit, and pull him a little tighter. "Thank god that's over, and that madman has been eliminated. " I mumble.
Sherlock                     My eyes narrow at her back, before I turn in a swirl of coats, striding off towards the entrance, hoping Rosie hasn't wandered off once more.
Mycroft                 "I expect John will be released by morning, into Sherlock's care. In the meantime, I need to gather more information about John's daughter, to determine if and or when she can be brought to London. Your focus can be finding out what we can about Moriarty, and possibly locating Moran.”
Sherlock                     "He's been doing the same." My voice is blunt now, tossing a jaffa cake at his head. "When you said you would keep your distance from him I didn't think even you would be so stupid to cut him out of your life completely."
Mycroft                       I look at my watch. "He should already be back home with John. I located him at the morgue, with the body of Mr. Parsons." I look him in the eye steadily. "Not that it matters anymore, but I did have feelings for you." Before he can respond to that statement, I yank my arm from his hand and leave, getting into my car and driving away quickly.
Greg                            "Look. I don't want us to be arguing like this or being shitty with one another and I know you want Sherlock back. We all do and I just want to apologise if we're shutting you out of all of this." I say after another sip, wanting to rebuild bridges between me and him.
Jamie                           "Molly is... Well... Molly." I pull the Zippo out of my pocket to light his cigarette. The loud clunk of the lid closing causes him to jump slightly. "Tell me the truth, Sherlock, are you ok? You seem a bit..." I motion to his shaking hands, dirty jeans, scuffed shoes, and more.
John                             “I’m sure you have some connections there that can help with that.” I pick up my empty. “Do you boys want some tea while I’m at it?” I brush past them into the kitchen.
Mycroft                 "Please stay here and mind my brother and Doctor Watson. I will be at the morgue." I turned on my heel and swept down the corridor to the lift, heading down to the morgue.
Sherlock                   My phone appears in my hand, taking a picture of the retreating man and his van, texting it to Mycroft to get a check on while demanding he come to 221B straight away. That done I turn and peer at the box, bending down and ripping it open. With a sinking heart I pull open the flaps to reveal two stuffed bears. One is dressed as a doctor, the other a soldier. The tags around the bear soldier's neck read 'KIA'.
John                      I try to get my breathing under control, shaking my head. “What are you talking about?”
Sally                            "... I don't have a power." I muttered and swiftly moved on to showing her crime scene photos, seeing the same look in her eyes that Sherlock often has at crime scenes that he actually finds interesting. It was amazing and terrifying at the same time.
Sherlock                     "Give me your hands" I don't waste time, stalking towards him and attempting to grab him to turn him back around to face me
Sherlock                   "You shouldn't have climbed the stairs." My eyes open, gazing in front of me now, my back still to John. My voice is level and calm. "Not in your fragile state."
Seb                        "That’s the thing with cases like these... unknown target, very little to go on but it’s nothing to get your knickers in a twist about..." I rolled my eyes and just had to keep calm a little longer until my plan could be put into place.
Rosie                           This time a few real tears come to my eyes. "How did it happen?" No one has told me what happened and maybe she will tell me.
Mycroft                     I jump up to stop her, but it's too late - her hand closes forcefully around Greg's throat. "Eurus - let him go!"
John                            “Oh... I... thanks.” I put the USB drive in my shirt pocket to watch later. “Um... we’ve got a room all set up for you upstairs.”
Mycroft                       I pull away, breathless. "While a cold shower might be appropriate right now, I doubt either of us wants one." I say with a light chuckle, reaching behind me to turn off the water. Rising to stand, I gently pull him up with me and grab a couple of towels, handing him one as I begin to peel off my own wet clothes.
Jim Moriarty          "Such a good boy, Sebby. Put that stuff away now. We’ll get one of the new recruits to take care of it." I do love Eurus' old suite. I take Sebby to the already remodeled Control Room where we can keep tabs on everyone while we chittychat. "Tell me about Greggy. Did you leave the note I gave you?"
Sherlock                   "I shall be. Yes." Taking a deep breath, I tug him down the corridors once more, allowing him to see everything, now with Moriarty's voice coming to our ears, explaining the security and how sure he is that Mycroft won't be able to take one step before the whole island explodes into nothing. I'm careful to edit out much of Moriarty's words to me, testing me or teasing me, sticking only to relevant points
Rosie                          These don't look like cookies. "I don't really like chocolate." I pick up the tea and sniff it. Ugh. "That smells terrible."
John                            “Fine.” I wave my hand. “Fine. Let’s just get this over with so we can go back to normal.”
Moriarty                   "The roof. Dinner with a view." As there is no where he can run I dismiss security.
John                            “Oh god, please. Please.” My hands thread into his hair as he slips down my body.
Sherlock               "Oh, do calm down, John." I huff, my harsh words at odds with the way my hands and fingers travel across his face tenderly. "You've been in a coma but you're healing well."
"It’s alright Mr. Watson. deep breaths, we'll get you some water in a minute... deep breaths, you're in the hospital." I said calmly and then heard DI Lestrade coming back through, asking what was going on in a panicked tone and then standing in the doorway.
Mycroft                 "Not until after Mary died..." I fidgeted with my gloves. "Anthea provided me with what little information we have."
Greg                            "The police are due here soon and so are the ambulance service. Stay awake for me." I tap his face where it looks like he wants to drop off, my heart starting to pound where I know Moran would be carrying and he wouldn't miss me if the police didn't arrive soon.
Mycroft                     "Of course, if Eva ever finds out about Renee in the file room..." I can barely contain my laughter at this point. "Let's just say your boss gets around."
Greg                            "But I'm not most people. And put your gloves back on." I tilted my head slightly to smile at him, knowing he was itching to and saw the relief on his face as we made our way back to his car with his gloves slipping back on with ease.
Mycroft                       "Your wish is my command," I grin, resting my head lightly on his shoulder, relaxed. It's not long before the slow, even breathing of sleep takes him. I carefully extricate myself from his arms, rolling onto my back. Half-asleep myself, I absentmindedly pull my gloves off, setting them on the bed stand before I fall asleep.
Mycroft                     I kiss his shoulder when I see him wince, and gentle settle his bad arm beside him. "Lie still... let me..." My lips move down his body again, and settle myself between his legs, lavishing attention on his hip with my tongue.
Sherlock                   My gaze sweeps over the desolate and wind-swept isle, then to the rolling seas below, before sliding into a chair and reaching for the glass, "I... I don't remember much of her. I didn't even recall I had a sister until recently. Then memories came..." My brow crinkles, "I recall playing with her... then pain."
Sherlock                   My hand is shaking, gripping John's, then my head sinks down into his shoulder, trembling, "I couldn't do anything."
Greg                      "Yeah, it's an extraordinary recovery seeing as he technically died twice on the operating table." I said softly as we followed the ambulance and I'd managed a couple hours’ kip and a clean suit so at least I looked more presentable than yesterday.
Sherlock                     "Do you agree to this John?" I turn to face him, with slight apprehension, "I will keep you nearby and stay in full communication if we need you."
Sally                            "I couldn't help but here you askin’ Lestrade if you could call her. Shame he said no." I loop my thumb through my belt right above where my cell phone is. "A true friend understands when a kid’s involved you gotta make allowances."
Rosie                          "Is your boyfriend as indecisive?" Maybe he'll give me a real answer. I hate when adults give me vague answers the want me to pick a choice. I always choose wrong then I get in trouble. "I'll just call you Dude until you make up your mind." I storm off to find the shower.
Sherlock                   "Then what do you wish?" I begin to glare at her, starting to grow convinced that the Watson stubborn streak combined with mental deficiency is not one to be taken lightly
Sherlock                   "She can move freely around the complex then?" Nodding, I wait to be led back, "Or is it only guards who can move around?"
Mycroft                     "At least until he's awake enough to pull the IV... you might consider restraints." I give him a grin. "Of course, if he's aware enough to do that, he's definitely on the road to recovery."
Mycroft                     "We probably should get you some clothes, too. I doubt most of my wardrobe will fit you as well as that dressing gown. " I smile fondly.
Greg                             I chuckle and rub my thumb across his hand, feeling him kiss the top of my head. "Did you get any other information? Like. will it get stronger, the connection? Are there any hiccups we should be aware of?" I asked softly.
Mycroft                     I smile weakly at him. "Eurus... where is she?" I ask, my voice not much more than a whisper. I know we both collapsed at Baker Street, overwhelmed by each other.
Oliver                         I jumped when Mr. Holmes spoke for the first time after we sit down. "Moriarty? No, he talked in his phone after he... after we left the bridge, but it was... John... no Jim. Yes, he called Jim and told him the guy, Mr. Ingraham died, and he asked if the "boys" are ready for the car. But I didn't see anybody, just Seb."
Mycroft                 "Fair enough," I lay a hand gently on his shoulder, giving it a squeeze. We shall not move from this room until you return."
Sherlock                   I make my way back to the room Moriarty has provided after our dinner. My mind is whirling, ignoring the guards flanking me who will remain stationed outside. I seem to be trapped on this island with no way to contact John or my brother...if my brother is even still all right. There's a sinking in my heart as I think back what Moriarty said about Mycroft and Lestrade. Without further information I have no idea of their conditions. My head hits the pillow, breathing deeply and attempting to sink into my mind palace. My transport revolts though and instead I fall into a deep sleep.
Mycroft                     "And be advised, she will NEVER admit that to you, should you ever ask. Even mentioning it to her might present a danger to us both."
Mycroft                       "Is that necessary, John?  I can assure you, the injury was properly cleaned and dressed, Dr. Watson."
Sally                            "What happened was just something that happened in his line of work, he was brave and you should remember that. Make John proud of you and Rosie now that he's no longer around." I sigh and didn't know what else to say to him about it to then not give my position away.
John                            I suck in a breath, as he passes his tongue over me lightly. “It is but it isn’t. But I really don’t care anymore.” One hand fists in the sheets and the other was still moving through his hair.
Mycroft                     I am well into my reading - having put away the files and switched to my romance novel some time ago - when I am interrupted by the doorbell. Suspiciously, I set down my book and walk to the door, looking carefully through the side window. Shocked, I fling open the door to see Greg standing there, soaked to the skin in the torrential downpour. I pull him inside quickly. "What are you doing, standing in the rain?" I look outside. "Where is your car?"
Greg                            "Okay. If you help us, then we will do all we can to protect you and your family. I see that you didn't have anything to do with the robbery or murder and you were held at gunpoint. You did it to protect your parents." I said lightly and was sympathetic for our advantage.
Sherlock                   "Remember to set all her accounts with your usual password so I can crack it easily." I call after him with a smirk
Mycroft                       I close the door to the flat behind me as I enter. "My apologizes, brother... that was unpleasant… but necessary"
John                      “Seb said... Moriarty. The man he was working for. His name is Moriarty.” My voice starts to rasp again as my throat dries up again.
Jamie                           Thom comes back and holds out a tray with all sorts of colors on it. "We have ones that will wake you up, more that will put you to sleep. Some to lose weight. Some to lose time. Some to help you think better," I pick up a small cream-coloured coated capsule, "and some to help you not think at all."
Mycroft                     I disconnect the call angrily and take a deep breath. I turn to leave the kitchen and nearly trip over Sherlock just outside the kitchen door. "You have full access to the databases for the duration of this investigation, brother. Anthea was none too pleased, but I was... able to make a deal."
John                            I re-enter Greg’s room to see him half out of bed and his arm bleeding from where he had yanked out the IV. “Hey? What’s going on?”
Mycroft                       I wrapped my fingers tightly into his hair and brought him down to me, nipping and suckling at his ear lobe. "I need to feel you cum inside me..." I whispered huskily. I could feel his reaction, and his thrusts sped up as he chased his own pleasure.
Mycroft                       I stretch out alongside him, watching him with rapt attention, and stroking myself slowly.
John                            I leap into action, nodding and grabbing my phone, barking down it before covering the mouthpiece and nodding coldly at Eurus, "I can stay here and guard her until we get reinforcements here. Take Mycroft to the hospital now."
Mycroft                     I pull a small first aid kit from my desk drawer. "You are most certainly not OK." I scold him, pulling on the latex gloves in the kit so I could carefully clean and bandage the cut on his forehead. "You're lucky. I doubt this would need stitches, at least. Does your head hurt?"
Greg                             "Was that a memory when you felt safe. Secure?" I asked and shifted my other leg onto the bed so I could at least sit up against the pillows while we spoke about this.
Greg                            "I was ready to shoot him when he came ‘round the corner." I whispered and felt myself shaking a little as we sat down on the curb, officers starting the long process of bagging all the medicine to then examine and for evidence against whoever else was working in there.
Greg                            "Then who was it?" I ask softly where his voice trembles almost, my eyes raking over him worryingly where he pushed me off him and got up to stand against the wall.
Sherlock                   "What flavour of drugs will you feed me?" My voice is listless, weary. I don't even need to act that much, not after my dream. My wrist still tingled where dream John grasped me.
Greg                            "Yes, sir..." I remarked under my breath and admittedly did feel better after drinking my mug of tea. I sat back into the pillows, my hands still shaking a little but now it wasn't from the cold. In the back of my head, I'd been trying to remember the number plate and make of the car.
Moriarty                   "Maybe next time. Maybe when you're not so... Hmm... Well, not this." I wave to all of him.
John                            I sigh. “You’ve trusted me to care and watch over Sherlock for years now. It seems Greg... doesn’t. He doesn’t consider me important enough in Sherlock’s life to notify me if something’s gone wrong. I’m not really sure what that’s about. Him and Sherlock? You and Him? Me and Sherlock? I don’t know. He doesn’t trust me.”
Greg                            "Don’t do anything stupid, John… we need her to talk." I point back at him before I looked back down at Mycroft and told him help was on the way. The paramedics got to Baker Street rather quickly and I was by his side all the way, still talking to him about what was going on.
Sharon Price          The tissue is swiped across my eyes again, "Oh, I'm so sorry. Greg." The little mistake and his reaction makes my lips twitch in something like a smile, before falling again. My tears dry but still threaten in the wobble in my voice, "I remember her saying how nice you were. She didn't mention how brave though."
Mrs. Lipton             "Of course deary. I have free-ish access to the whole building. Free-ish because it is a bit hush-hush with the night shifts. I have my keycard with me, you have your guns. Onward people I would like to leave this hateful place." I lead them through corridors and locked doors until we arrive to a metal double door. "This is a control room. Usually there are three people in the night shift. Be careful dears!  And switch off that awful sound, will you? It is really annoying." Why Moriarty choose this terribly annoying alarm sound is beyond me.
Sherlock                   "I wouldn't put that past my brother." Once more, I'm astonished as to how he makes me laugh, chuckling and nuzzling the spot behind his ear, muttering, "I would rather you take the time to plan, than to come running in blind to save me. I'm safe here." I pause, then add, "As safe as I can be with a madman like Moriarty in command. He doesn't trust me, but I watch my step and keep the act up."
Mycroft                     I smile up at him as he climbs onto the bed next to me. "I knew that when I met you." I kiss him on the cheek. "Now, get some rest. I insist."
Greg                            "After what I heard with Moriarty, I had to come onto the island. And the distraction is still in motion." I said as I heard Mycroft speaking to his brother and I kept my back against the wall just in case until someone was due to arrive. I didn't particularly want to be blown to pieces.
Sherlock                     Finally I reach the roof of one of the more hidden drug dens, sighing and sitting on it a moment. Teleporting across the city has weakened me, making my head droop a little, along with the emotional vulnerability I feel. I wonder how long it will take before Sally gets wind and tells Moriarty of my escape. Suddenly my phone beeps. Pulling it out, I expect a text from my brother, so am surprised to see the message so soon from Moriarty. Slowly I text back:
Sherlock                     As we travel back I nod, pursing my lips, "Go on, tell me everything you can recall."
Mrs. Lipton             I open the door silently as Sherlock was asleep the last two times I tried. "Oh, there you are deary. Did you have a nice nap? I bring you your lunch, come in and eat." I motion to him to sit as I push the dinner trolly to the table "I made you a nice tomato soup as I promised with cheese on toast." the last toast was really good if I say so myself, I secretly glad he was asleep as I like cheese on toast
Greg                             "Quiet enough that people don't think you're sucking me off in here. Just that we’re talking." I groaned as he palmed over my erection and I sat up in my chair, so he could pull my trousers down to my knees. I was painfully hard, and I had been since I'd kissed him in the corridor, his flat also sounding really good right now.
John                            Chuckling, I move up next to him, “You don’t have the imagination to... imagine something we’ve done before?” My mouth finds his shoulder, pressing kisses there.
John                             “One of you get us a wet flannel and a glass of water. The paracetamol from vanity too.” I squat down next to the sofa, looking Greg over and feeling inside of the next of his shirt. He was warm, very warm.
Mycroft                       I see him getting pale with the effort. "Sherlock... stop... it's enough..." His grip loosens a little, and I pull my hands away from him.
Mycroft                       I raise my eyebrow at him as he leans back and rests his feet on my desk, but say nothing. Gathering up the plates, I take them to the kitchen, and refill Greg's water glass.
Greg                             "I... Explain to me." I'm now the one to be confused and I put my tea mug down to listen to his obvious deductions about his brother.
Mycroft                       "You understand, this is all a ploy on Sherlock's part... you had said our last resort to get to Moriarty would be to enlist the aid of a strong meta to trap him... Sherlock has volunteered."
Small laceration on his head, a bit of a headache... maybe concussion? He's not a cooperative patient.
Greg                            "Not very. I'll just need a warm shower to loosen me up and then I'll be good for the day." I said softly, running my hands over his clothed chest and then down his thighs where he was wearing a matching pair of pj's.
Eurus                         The flat at 221B was rather what I expected. Messy, chaotic and smelling strange. A lot like what I remember of my middle brother. He always was a strange child, a ball of frantic energy and thought barely kept together. How I hated him. Not as much as I despised Mycroft but it was close. I had spent the last few hours rummaging around, attempting to find something I could use against Sherlock, to break his mind utterly so not even dear, sweet Jim had a use for him. I lounged now in the chair I knew had once belonging to his boring, disgustingly ordinary lover, Watson. My bare feet dangled over one arm as I played with the stuffed toy dog I had found buried in one of the bedroom drawers
Moriarty                   I briefly trail my thumb down his jaw. "Don’t worry, you'll never be left alone for long ever again." Turning to the guards I signal for him to be removed. "Give him access to the music room and library." I wave them all off and prepare for the chopper ride and to retrieve Seb’s body.
Rosie                          I pick up our unfinished breakfasts and throw the dishes into the sink. I put on my coat and put Myc’s keys in his hand. "It's ok, Mycie. I'll be with you the whole time, k."
John                            I’m a little confused about his reaction but hold him close anyway. “It’s alright, Love. It’s over. We can go home now.”
Greg                            "It’s not any different to what victims have gotten in the past… just trying to scare us in a rather pathetic way." I sigh as I put the note back down and thought the chance of it having prints on it is slim. I had to grimace at the letter myself, the hand writing rather scruffy.
Dr Capaldi                 "He'll need to remain overnight, but we can have him transferred to your care tomorrow. I'm positive the Meta-Human office can take over from there." I look over Lestrade's file. "It appears he was bit by a human. Are you aware if who that may have been?"
Mycroft                 "What were his injuries?" I asked Lestrade while looking at my brother, his head nestled on John's still hands.
Greg                      "I know it's a lot to take in, but you know I'm here for both of you if you need advice or help." I said after a few minutes silence and watched his eyes peer over at me strangely. I saw the trembling and was concerned.
Greg                            "Yeah, yeah, I think so. Sherlock..." I wipe my face where I'm feeling like I'm about to pass out but fight it, seeing Sherlock out cold on the floor and then John ignoring his feeling of lightheadedness to check his vitals. I was shakily trying to move round to do the same but then had Mycroft’s arms around me.
John                            I watch Rose go, with a worried look. “At least she didn’t try to leave this time.” I say looking at Sherlock. He nods.
Mycroft                 I walk quietly into John's room, feeling three sets of eyes staring at me. "I am glad to see you awake, Dr. Watson."
Mycroft                     "I've got you worked up? I think you've played your part in this..." I grind my hips against his with a grin, leaning in to nip along his neck.
Greg                            I know we needed to grab Eurus while she was at Baker street but felt like both of us needed to get rid of some pent up energy. Seb had riled us both up, more me than Mycroft and I waited until we were in the car to breathe out a little.
Sherlock                   "No experiments on my daughter." My tone is mild, glancing around as we walk still.
Sally                            "I... Don't know if he'd have wanted me to tell you that Rosie." I chewed on my lip and looked in on him, thinking he didn't have too much else to lose. "His partner, John Watson, was killed in an explosion. He's just really, really sad because he loved John." I explained simply.
Greg                      "Me and Mycroft, however, will leave you two to read the file. We'll get started on intel." I saw the touching moment and pushed at Mycroft a little, running a hand through my hair.
Sherlock                   Nodding, I turn back to the panels, "How are we supposed to work together brother? Haven't we already done so to get to this point?" My irritation is rising again, "I teleported to John and passed the information on to you to defeat Moriarty. What more do we need to do?"
Mrs. Lipton             "Oh, but I like challenges..." I look up and down the two men "Wait did you say your John? Welcome back amongst the living, Dr. Watson."
Sherlock                   I shuffle back, pulling out my phone and starting to text my brother once more, demanding his presence to rescue me
Mycroft                       "I don't think so, but I have not looked into it, to be fair." I reply. "I have been more concerned with your well-being."
Sherlock                   "Leave. John. Out of this." My teeth are gritted, shaking my head slowly, "We all bear wounds Moriarty. You have a wonderful mind. You're wasting it with this bitter foolishness. You challenged me when you attempted to kill my partner. Your battle is with me, not John."
Mycroft                     I look at the girl carefully. "So, my brother tells me you can communicate with his bees..."
Greg                             "It's nearly half past 8 but I'm on a half day so decided to make you breakfast." I passed over his mug and saw the relieved smile on his face where I was still here. I still had questions about last night.
John                             “Are you sure that’s a good idea? I don’t know if I should even leave the flat. What if they have the front door on surveillance?”
Mycroft                     I finish texting Anthea. "We need to work out the best - and safest - way to retrieve him. But first," I open the door to Greg's room "I need to see Greg."
Sherlock                   I bend down slowly, crooking one knee below myself to put my face at Rosie's level, "The people who harmed your father may come for you also. You need this protection Rose Marie. I'm sorry you hate me now, but I cannot be sorry for what I have done."
Sherlock                     That makes my smile easier, nodding, "We also have a knack for finding the very man who will make us matter. Don't screw it up Mycroft."
Rosie                           "That'd be nice." I relax into the hug. "Are you really coming with or did you just say that so you and Pop would stop arguing?"
Moriarty                   "She’s safe. She'd be happier her with you, her father." I sense he is trying to get information about Gregory and Mycroft’s actions. "Maybe now isn't the best time to make those plans."
Mycroft                       My driver Phillip and John - my 'security team' wrestle a surly Sherlock into the back of the car, where John, Rosie and I join him. Greg rides up front with Phillip. We take the main roads across London to my flat, ensuring we are seen by several traffic cameras en route, and arrive without incident. Once there, Greg and I step out of the car. "You may say your goodbyes now, brother." When they've finished their conversation, John - still posing as security - will escort Rosie into the house after us.
Greg                             "Whether he picks anybody else up, whether she looks happy or scared. Just small things I guess but thank you." I nodded and met his eye once he'd stopped huffing in a very Holmes' manner.
Greg                            "Yeah. means you can bend me over the desk or I can do it to you… how does that sound?" I whispered between us kissing and he seemed to stop to look at me for a moment, using his free hand to hunt around in my coat pockets as I was pinned up against the wall.
John                             “You haven’t said anything out loud, Sherlock. You have to remember to use your words.”
Greg                             I swear under my breath before darting after him, narrowly missing being hit by a car as we both race across the main road and then into a main shopping area. I had done this too many times to know Sherlock wasn't that different from perpetrators I'd chased in the past. I knew how to weave through the public easy.
Mycroft                     I pull back, and wrap my hand around his cock, stroking him slowly as I lap at the head. I look up at him, his face a picture of bliss. "You are so beautiful like this..." I whisper roughly.
John                            “Of course, I’m willing. We don’t really have a choice, do we? We’re all in danger while he’s still running free. We have to do something.” I down the last of my coffee. “I’m just worried about what’s going to happen with all of us after.”
John                            I don’t flinch as I watch as Moriarty turns the gun on himself. I prepare for any deception or tricks on his part. Not caring if he shot himself or not.
John                            I turn to see Sherlock wrapped in the top sheet from our bed. I lean towards him as he moves to my side. “Are you wearing any pants?” I whisper.
Greg                             "Hello Mrs. Price... yes... thank you..." I tried to keep my head down as I left the path with Mycroft trailing behind, knowing she would stop us as we tried to walk towards his car on the street.
Greg                            I take the chance to turn round a shelving unit when he dashes for a large desk, my still hand shooting and catching him in the shoulder. He drops like a rag doll and I run over to put my weight on him, so I could at least talk to him for two seconds.
Moriarty                   "She is a great girl. Smart, funny, deliciously evil... When your brother locked her up she had nothing to do but think. And think and think. Thoughts can be dangerous when no one listens." I open the door to the roof and see that dinner has been set out. "But you know that don't you, Locky? You know how easy it is to escape when reality gets too... lonely."
John                            Nodding at Mycroft we make our way up to the door and open it slowly. I peek my head in to find the corridor empty. I wave Mycroft through the door after me.
John                            His warm breath ghosts over my neck, causing goosebumps to spread out. “Where are you? Are you alright? I’m so worried.”
Mycroft                     "Greg's accident last night was no accident - it was a warning. Anyone associated with him could potentially be in danger. Since Seb likely believes you are dead, we need to do what we can to ensure that he continues to believe that..."
I would prefer not to be here. I'm so relaxed I can almost feel my brain oozing from my ears. Let’s just stop with this foreplay and you tell me what you want -SH
John                             “Oh wow. That’s cool... but no I don’t. I just never thought... I dunno. I’d be with someone I loved long enough to want to have kids.” I shrug. “I... I’m sorry your Mother felt like she couldn’t tell me about you. Or didn’t want to tell me.”
Rosie                          A look into the kitchen shows John is busy talking to the tall skinny guy who showed up earlier. I sulk back into the living room and sit next to Sherlock. "Hes busy." I sigh and curl up in a small ball.
Sherlock                   I pour the boiling water into both mugs, my shoulders tensing, "We went shopping. Yesterday."
Moran                        My teeth grit, pushing against the physical pain and ignoring it. My eyes however are fixed on Mycroft, displaying a trace of nerves, spitting out, "You Holmes are all the same. Freaks, even for metas."
Sherlock                   I can't help but try and drift near the kitchen, teleporting silently till I'm close enough to attempt to overhear
Mycroft                     "If Seb thinks his previous mission was successful, that will leave you more able to investigate, if you remain unseen."
Sherlock                     "I want you there also John." My tone is firm, even as I grab my coat and swing it on, "I'll call for one of Mycroft's cars to take us. You can wait outside in it where no one will know you're there. If we need you then you can come in. I value your daughter's life above the secret of you being alive."
Sherlock               "I.... was actually hoping you'd be able to tell me." My fingers drop the ice onto his bare neck, then I dive after it, trying to catch it before it can slither towards the extensive bandages around his shoulder and chest
John                            “If this is real. Then why can’t I touch you?” I pout a bit. “My regular dreams are better than this.”
Sherlock                   A window above Speedy's cafe opens and a tousled dark head of curls poking out, glaring down at my brother
John                            Taking a ragged breath, I look down at my cup. “Just because I didn’t see it, doesn’t mean it doesn’t scare me too. You’ve trusted me to keep him on the right path. To be there for him. I’ve done that. Don’t I deserve some credit for that? Why am I still on the outside for both of you? I don’t matter enough in Sherlock’s life to be contacted when things go wrong. But I’m ok to keep babysitting him when it’s convenient for you.” The end comes out biting.
Sherlock                     This time I actually start to struggle, looking shocked, "No. NO! You can't. On what grounds? Let me GO."
John                            “Alright then. We’re going to New York.” I smile widely at him before leaning forward to give him a kiss.
Mary                     "A bomb?" My head flies around, staring at Seb in horror, "No, you can't just leave us here to die. Please." John lets his head fall back onto the wall with a thunk, swearing under his breath.
Mycroft                     "I expect they wouldn't. Their mental images may be unfamiliar to humans, if they've not had much exposure to them. It's like learning a foreign language." I stifle a yawn and swing my legs off the bed. "I don't suppose you'd be hungry? I'd be happy to make you something to eat..."
Sherlock                   My thighs tremble at his passing, hands flying up to grasp the pillows around my head to tug them inwards, "Please, not forever. I can't last."
Sherlock                   I pop my head out the door again, snapping, "Come on you two. We don't have time for your bickering."
Mycroft                     I sigh in relief. "Thank you." I say, slipping the gloves back on. We spend just a few minutes at NSY, for Greg to pick up a few files, then head to the morgue at St. Bart's to speak at length to Molly and picking up the promised photographs. As we walk into my office, I nod to Anthea. "We are going to be reviewing the CCTV footage I requested. We are not to be disturbed, please."
Mycroft                     Hearing Eurus' voice, I step into the room. "Hello, sister mine." I say darkly.
Mycroft                     I shiver, and continue moving my lips over his chest, kissing and tasting my way down his body.
Greg                            I wasn't bothered about being pleasured and we dozed for an hour before finally rising from his spare room bed. We took it in turns to shower, my clothes from yesterday still damp from the rain so when I got to the kitchen in the tracksuit, I found one of my other suits along with my mail from work.
Rosie                          I make a gag face at bran flakes. "Yuck! Only really old people eat those." I take too big a bite and spill some cereal on my borrowed shirt.
Mycroft                       I turn to head back downstairs to the car, hoping Greg is right behind me.
Sherlock                     Leaping up to my feet, I stride to the door, snapping, "Rosie. My daughter. I need to get back for her."
Rosie                          "I don't... Umm no one has ever... Really? My own laptop? I don't even have email!" I look back and forth from both guys. "Really?"
Moriarty                   I touch his arm to make him stop and look at me. "None. No more unless you want them..." Now that he's here I have no need to keep him in the trap, the mouse has nowhere to run.
Sherlock                     My hands reach out to the small slit, raising my voice higher, "Come on, just let me out. I'll get back to Rosie and we can just forget this"
Mycroft                       I make a surprised sound as Greg shoves me up against the wall, kissing me roughly. I push him away. "Greg... wait..."
Greg                            I had to finally let my moans go as he took me deeper in his mouth, his tongue being something that the devil had created. I was arching up into his mouth and trying to keep my feet flat on the bed to steady myself.
Greg                      "I'm sure I can deal with both, idiocy or not." I said softly as I accepted a cup of coffee from someone that worked beneath Mycroft, getting rather a surprised look when I thanked them for it. They even brought biscuits which was a nice touch.
Rosie                          I get off the bony guy that I've only succeeded in knocking over. Grabbing my backpack, I make a run for the door.
Mycroft                       "You're safe. No one can reach you here. I will protect you." I whispered quietly in his ear.
Sally                            I reach my hand through the bars and pat his shoulder. "Hate to be the one who tells you, but I'm gonna be real honest, friends should be real honest." Once he finally looks at me I take a deep breath. "You’ve already lost her. Paper work came past the desk hours ago."
Sherlock               The chair rocks a little as I sit down, keeping one hand holding his while the other balances the cup on my lap, trying to pick up a slippery ice shard with my fingers to place in John's mouth, "Oh, do stop hanging around the door, Lestrade. You're not invisible. Make yourself useful and inform my brother that John is awake."
Greg                            It was like I could hear the words coming back from him in my ear, but he had buried his face in my good shoulder to moan there. I was crying out every time he hit my prostate, his hand pushing me further and further until I came over his fingers. I feel my muscles tense and it was like a sob that I let out where I could see a flash of Mycroft watching his uncle taking Eurus away. He was clutching tightly to Sherlock as he did.
John                      I let him take my hand, lacing my fingers with his. I look up at Lestrade who was still hovering in the doorway. “Tell Mycroft I...” I stop not knowing the right words. “... that I want information. Where she is, what she’s doing... what she knows.”
Mary                     "My knickers are just fine." I check yet another deserted office, my instincts telling me we're near the heart of the building now. "I'm just going to check in with John." My hand goes to my ear, touching the mic hidden there. "Sweetheart, we're seeing nothing." There's a pause, then John's voice returns over my mic and Seb’s, "Mary, don't call me that." His voice is slightly amused though, bored even, "All clear out here too."
Sherlock                     "He does." My hands are shoved into my pocket as I watch them get ready to transport Lestrade inside, "Of that there can be no dispute. Stay with him now." It’s more of an order than a suggestion.
Sherlock                     "You would recover?" There's a biting edge to my tone. "Or would you keep pushing yourself till you drove yourself over the edge? Not to mention the possibility of Lestrade retreating away, nursing his own broken heart."
Greg                            I switch over to where I've got connections to the men commencing the distraction and I heard them set off, declaring that the distraction was now in motion. I relayed it to Mycroft and John and kept my feelings of wanting to be there and not wanting either of them to be caught to myself. It would not help anything.
John                            The smell of coffee wakes me, so I climb stiffly out of bed and pull on some jeans and a t-shirt before heading out into the hall towards the kitchen. I walk in to see Mycroft pulling a mug out of the cabinet.
Mycroft                       I climb back into bed alongside him, curling behind him - the big spoon - and wrapping an arm around his waist. I nuzzle into his neck softly. "It's good to know that your neighbors are not used to those types of sounds from your flat," I mumble with a grin.
