"I was weaving," Cas answered. His voice was hoarse from disuse. "Come look at what I made," he said, taking Dean's hand in his own cold one and dragging him along behind him. He led him to the table in the corner. And that's when Dean laid his eyes upon Cas' work.
The war went on for a long time. Every other month, when they were falling short of money, Cas weaved. Dean didn't want him to, claiming that Cas was working too hard and money shouldn't come at the cost of his health. But Cas refused to budge. He said it was all he had to offer. Dean disagreed vehemently. They had many fights about it but in the end Cas always won. And every time, he made Dean promise to humour his peculiar request of being left alone while weaving. Every piece of cloth he produced turned out to be as beautiful as the last. In time, merchants from the neighbouring ally kingdoms bought his wares to deliver to nobles of their kingdoms, too. And even though Cas got sick, he always recovered soon enough.
Eight years ago he’d moved into this house, already a single father at the age of twenty five, with no one to call family except his brother Gabriel who lived in Chicago and the little three month old boy in his arms. Eight years ago he’d met the man who had now come to mean the world to him (and his son too, apparently). He’d barely been making enough money to provide for himself and Jack, whom he’d adopted after Kelly’s death. Dean (and eventually, his brother Sam, who’d moved back to Lawrence after having married his wife, Eileen) had always stood by him and helped him through everything.
Unfortunately, he couldn’t dwell on him for long as the doorbell rang, shrill and loud, signaling the arrival of kids, the first of many that evening. Letting the soup simmer on the stove, he went to get the huge bowl to offer up to the kids outside.
Castiel let out a small chuckle. “As if I could ever feel otherwise.”
"I'm going to sell it straight to the queen. Whatever money we make should last us a good while."
Because it might just be a moment to the world.
There were times after that, times when Dean looked to Cas (not Castiel anymore, just
Sam just smirked, clearly too caught up in his own small victory to notice the unfamiliar word that Cas had thrown his way. Dean, however, found himself thinking about it all evening.
"What? Why?"
Sam finally had enough time to resume his monthly visits and he always brought Eileen along. Her and Cas were unstoppable together. But despite being on the receiving end of many of their pranks, Dean always found himself falling a little more in love with his husband. Often, Charlie came over with Gilda or Dean and Cas visited them. Benny and Andrea were too busy with their daughter most of the time but they joined whenever they could. Dean was perfectly happy with his life and couldn't wish for anything more. Maybe in a few years he and Cas would look into bringing home a little child but for now, he was content.
Dean took a deep breath. There was no going back now. “Olani hoath ol, Castiel,” he said, looking him straight in the eye as he said it.
Dean’s grin grew wider, until he could claim to give the Cheshire Cat competition. “Damn right I’m Batman!”
Dean turned to look at him. Cas looked and sounded just as calm as he had most of the night but something about him felt off. Maybe Dean was seeing only what he wanted to see but he thought Cas' eyes held sadness in them. He was pretty sure his own eyes mirrored the sentiment. Dean didn't want him to go. So he said the only thing he could think of.
Cas didn't come to bed that night.
“You work twice as hard as the rest of us, and he treats you all the worse for it,” she said, shaking her head in anger as Dean groaned in pleasure around a mouthful of bread. They chatted about various things, flitting from one topic to another and once or twice Dean contemplated telling Charlie about the swan but then thought better of it. The bread was finished before they knew it and they went their separate ways, grumbling about their master in lieu of a farewell.
"Go to sleep, Dean," Cas said, making his way to the door. "I'm going to do some weaving. I borrowed one of the smaller looms from the shop. Just do me a small favour, will you? Please don't come into the next room while I'm weaving. At any cost. I'll come back here when I'm done."
When Castiel spoke his voice was bitter. "I don't have a family anymore. They abandoned me."
The shrill, loud ring of the doorbell reverberated through the mostly silent house as Castiel dabbed the damp cloth on Jack’s forehead gently.
Not surprisingly, Cas is already looking at him, his eyes smiling.
Life was good.
The final battle was over. Chuck and Billie had been taken care of. Cas’ deal with the Empty had been broken. Michael and Rowena kept the angels and demons in check. The hunter network had grown quite a bit and now the Winchesters didn’t really have to worry about much besides the occasional run-of-the-mill salt and burn or vamp nest. Cas had moved into the bunker to live with them.
Cas chuckled. He pressed a kiss to Dean's cheek before they went back to bed, deciding to simply spend the day with each other, resting and recovering. They discussed their plans for the future, joked around and lazily made out all over the house. For the first time in months, both of them were optimistic about the days to come.
Cas looked up, face confused but hopeful at the same time. "Dean…" he began but he was cut off before he could say anything else.
him. But he really did want to understand what it was that Cas was saying. He had no clue where all this was coming from. He’d never really been this way with Sammy and his Latin and Greek. He was more than happy to let his little nerd of a baby brother take the reins on that part of their job. Maybe it was because he felt differently about Cas than he did about Sam. He quickly pushed down that thought. He’d been repressing those feelings for close to a decade and if he wasn’t careful he was going to blurt out something stupid someday. So he decided that he was resolutely going to ignore whatever it was that Cas punctuated his speech with. So what if he decided to slip in a bit of Enochian? It was none of Dean’s damn business.
When Cas was getting beaten to death by Dean.
Castiel reached out, past the snarling demonic facade, and pulled the Righteous Man out of Hell.
They paid Crowley off just the day before the fateful night.
Dean hadn’t expected to find anyone in the library. Sammy was out with Eileen again, helping Jody and the girls with a hunt. Jack was in his room, probably deep in the Netflix hole. Cas, he thought, was probably in the garden tending to his precious flowers with bees buzzing around his head. Dean smiled at the image.
In that moment, they understood each other. Completely and perfectly.
Dean did end up falling out of the chair.
“Hey, Cas. What’s up, buddy?”
Dean would recognise that shade anywhere.
It wasn’t very long before Jack was growing tired and yawning. Dean got up from his spot beside Jack, causing the kid to pout in protest.
For the second time that evening, he was brought back to reality by Dean’s deep, soothing voice.
They chatted animatedly for the next few minutes, discussing every damn topic under the sun and Castiel ended up tuning out their conversation as he stood to the side, basking in the warmth radiating from the two people he loved most in the world. Not that Dean knew, of course. And Castiel was not going to ruin their friendship by telling him.
“Jeez, Cas,” Dean said, voice uncharacteristically soft, “Never thought you woulda felt the same way about me.”
It was inevitable, falling in love with Cas. He was everything Dean could ever think of wanting, and more. He was always kind to the children in the streets, cared about his family and friends and always put others before himself. He seemed to love cats and birds of all kinds. He was adorably awkward and shy and had so much goodness in his heart that Dean was surprised he hadn't already burst from all the love inside him. Naturally, Dean thought that the only person Cas couldn't love was him. So he pined away in silence, unaware that Cas was doing exactly the same thing.
"Your family sounds wonderful. Tell me more about them," Castiel said.
It was a few nights after the beer incident. Cas was sitting in the Dean Cave with Dean rewatching Star Wars (
Cas stood rooted to his spot for a few moments. Dean shifted uncomfortably in his bed. But then, Cas’ face broke into a soft, shy smile. He strode over to Dean and reclaimed his spot in his bed, as Dean moved over to make more space for him. Cas regarded Dean in wonder, as if he’d hung up the moon and stars. Then, he placed his palm on Dean’s cheek and pulled him close as their lips met, after dancing around each other for eleven years.
"I had to deliver some cloth to Lady Lilith," Cas said. He thrust the package towards Dean. "Here. I got a raise today so I got you some bread and chicken."
That night, when Dean came back from work, they discussed living arrangements. Despite Dean's insistence, Cas stood firm over his decision that a carpet on the floor would be enough for him.
When Cas brought Dean back from Zachariah’s universe (which to Dean was honestly worse than Hell), the first thing Dean’s eyes sought were Castiel’s blue ones. Not to his surprise, they were already trained on him.
Their bond, forged in Hellfire and the smouldering, pure heat of the union of two beings that knew each other better than anything else in the universe, was the most profound that had ever been seen.
Dean suddenly realised that he did not have a bed to offer to the stranger, save the one on which he slept. He sighed and resigned himself to a night on the floor.
“See, Sammy? Even Cas knows whose taste is better.”
It had to be the most beautiful cloth Dean had ever seen. It was a strange, shimmering sort of black that seemed rather otherworldly to look at. It was woven expertly, not a single flaw in the fabric. He reached his hand out to run his fingers over it. It was as soft to the touch as it looked, like a bird's feathers. This was the most luxurious thing Dean had ever seen. Surely it was fit for a noble? Even the royal weavers couldn't have woven something so skillfully.
No one got any sleep. Dean was slumped in Cas' arms and Eileen stared gloomily outside the window all night. In the room next to theirs, Crowley worked tirelessly, mixing up pastes and antiseptics, grinding herbs and weighing them. Morning came and with it good news. Crowley was confident that Sam would survive, provided he got proper medication. For the first time since last night, Cas saw something like a glimmer of hope in his husband's eyes.
Admittedly, reading Enochian from a book was quite different from hearing an angel speak it but Dean liked to think that he was beginning to actually understand some of what Cas said. It was becoming more and more difficult for him to suppress his laughter when Cas came up with increasingly creative insults for him and Sammy. For a millennia old celestial being, Cas sure could be extremely immature. Dean almost choked on his beer one day, when Cas called Sam a floppy haired ape behind his back in Enochian. Both Cas and Sam had turned around, giving him concerned looks but Dean had just waved them away. If Cas had any suspicions about Dean being able to understand what he said, he didn’t voice them.
The first thing Cas noticed was Dean, standing frozen outside the door. His usually lively green eyes were blank and his mouth was set into a thin line. Before Cas could offer any comfort, he turned and walked out of the house in quick, long steps. Cas thought of going after him but then reasoned against it, knowing that Dean needed some space and time alone. He turned his head and that's when he saw Sam lying on the bed.
Something in Castiel changed right then. He couldn’t pinpoint the feeling, but it promptly tore his gaze away from the stars to Dean’s face, glowing in the moonlight as memories from years ago came rushing back to him.
Dean brought his hand up the clutch at his chest over his heart, gasping exaggeratedly loudly. “How dare you?” he said in mock indignation. At that exclamation, both of them doubled over laughing and after a little more teasing and a wink from Dean that made Castiel’s heart leap and his knees weak, he was gone, promising to be back soon.
Castiel raised his eyebrow. “Aren’t you a little too old for that?” he said, fighting back the smile that threatened to grace his lips at the thought of the effect that statement would have on Dean. He reacted just as Castiel had predicted.
“Gnay ge hoxmarch.”
It was a night like any other. It was raining hard outside. Dean and Cas sat in the comfortable chairs in front of the fire, talking and laughing with each other. And then Cas brought up a topic that was still fairly new for them, something that they both approached delicately. They had been talking about bringing home a little child to live with them but they both had their fears and reservations. Just as they had gotten down to seriously discussing it instead of skirting around it like they usually did, a knock sounded on the door. Dean grumbled, but got up to open the door.
It was Eileen standing hunched against the door frame on the other side. Her clothes were torn and bloody, there were wounds on her head and arms and her face was streaked with tears. A sob was torn away from her before she could stop it, and Cas was immediately at the door beside his husband. He took one look at Eileen and pulled her in, wrapping both her and Dean in a hug. He knew Dean was assuming the worst, and so was Cas, if he was being honest. He also knew that Dean was the one who'd raised Sam when they were both kids and so was taking this much worse. Cas prayed, for both Eileen's sake and Dean's, that things weren't as bad as they looked.
Dean yawned widely, pulling out his keys from his pocket when his little house came into view. As he got closer, steps shaky and small, he spotted something dark on his doorstep. Squinting, he tried to make out what it was but it was much too dark to really see. Hunger and fatigue forgotten for the moment, Dean only had eyes for the dark lump as he walked towards his house. He reached the door and bent down.
Dean kept telling himself that he simply wouldn’t trust this creature, this
Inside his room, Dean sat next to Jack, recounting some story or the other while the kid laughed, his mouth already stuffed full of candy. The sickly pallor of his cheeks was slowly being replaced by a light rosy hue. He looked much better than he had all evening. The three of them sat together for some time, trading jokes and laughing. Jack’s eyes were shining with happiness and even though he’d known it, the sudden realization that Dean was the one who made his son so happy struck him speechless.
"You know, Cas, we don't exactly get many travelling folks here. Our King ain't exactly well loved. What brings you to these parts? Family?"
They should've known that it was too good to last.
"What have you done, Dean?" he whispered, brokenly. He pulled Dean close and sobbed into his chest. Dean was too shocked to do anything other than hold his husband tight. Cas cried, for what Dean didn't know. Did he really think Dean would abandon him because of this? Hate him? Dean could do nothing but wait.
Dean and Cas can spend eternities staring into each other’s eyes.
When Dean was getting beaten to death by Cas.
Except Dean just couldn’t ignore it. Something about the way Cas randomly said things in his native language made Dean’s breath catch in his throat. It made him feel like maybe Cas was comfortable around them, that maybe he was happy. And damn if he didn’t sound hot pronouncing those harsh syllables in his deep, gruff voice. Dean just longed to know what he was saying.
They were the eyes of the swan Dean had saved all those years ago.
Night had already set in, the sky dark and cloudy, by the time Dean started making his way back home. He was tired to the bone and though his stomach growled with hunger, all he could think about was falling into his bed and getting some much needed sleep. Sir Alastair, his employer had organised a feast and since Dean’s partner in the kitchen, Benny, was with his wife as she birthed their child, Dean had had to get up before dawn even broke to make his way to the large kitchens to make sure there was food enough for the hundreds of lords and ladies that would grace the mansion with their presence in the evening.
So, Dean was honestly quite surprised to see Cas in the kitchens late in the afternoon with Dean's favorite gummy smile on his face and a small package in his hands.
"Please," he started, voice soft and hoarse with disuse, "Can I stay the night? I have nowhere else to go and your…" he broke off in a violent fit of coughing. When the coughs stopped, he continued. "Your house is the first I've seen in miles and I'm just so tired and so cold and I don't have any money and I…" he trailed off, seemingly too overwhelmed to get any more words out. He stared at Dean expectantly for a few moments before his beautiful blue eyes turned downwards and he took a step back.
“Yeah okay, daddy,” he said, picking up the copy of Charlotte’s Web that Castiel had picked up from the shelf and turning to the first page. Castiel sauntered down into the kitchen and went about preparing the soup that Jack loved so much.
It bothered Dean a lot more than it should have. Well, it didn’t exactly
Nobody had any idea what the war started over but King Azazel always jumped at every opportunity to conquer and expand his territory. So he called upon all his knights, including Sir Cain, who was old and not as agile as he'd once been, to fight alongside him in the war. The kingdom they were fighting against was relatively very small and weak, and no one had expected the war to go on for very long. But the war dragged on and on and on, and it was a bad time for everyone.
And they were both hit with the realization of just how deeply they were in love with the other.
Which is why, as Dean walked home, he resigned himself to the fact that he would have to go to sleep on an empty stomach instead of staying up cooking and wasting precious time he could spend resting. Of course, it had nothing to do with the fact that his master barely paid him enough to survive. Obviously.
It was a swan with pure, inky black feathers. It just lay there, unmoving.
That night, too, Dean put down in front of the swan a bowl of water, some grain and some bread that he had sneaked out of his master’s house. While it fed, Dean tried once again to get a close look at the feathers, maybe try and figure out how to bandage them. The swan moved away again. After a few lengthy minutes of trying, Dean gave up again and went to bed.
And they understood.
The next day was spent at home. Neither of them cared about work. They made love slowly, worshipping each other, whispering promises that could never be kept. Afterwards, they lay in bed together as the sun set, looking into each other's eyes, memorising every detail.
Dean simply stared at Cas while he talked about his work enthusiastically. He watched as Cas waved his hands around, speaking in an animated voice with a bright smile on his face all the while. Somehow, Cas seems to know exactly what he needed and when he needed it. His mind wandered and he simply couldn't help thinking about the thousands of things that made him fall more in love with Cas everyday. At this moment, he wanted nothing more than to pull him close and kiss him stupid. His eyes went glassy as millions of thoughts ran through his head.
Even if it was just for a moment.
Even as Dean watched the life drain out of his Angel’s eyes.
“Ol trian ooanoan vors g.”
Finally, after what felt like an eternity and just a second at the same time, they pulled apart for breath. Cas rested his forehead against Dean’s, smiling, his eyes shining with adoration. A few more seconds passed before he spoke again, his voice soft.
And so, the night went by without either of them getting a wink of sleep as they talked about everything under the sun, from family and friends to god to cruel rulers to what had happened in the kitchens last week. They laughed together and they teased each other and at times, they each lamented about some regret or misfortune. And all the while, Dean felt an inexplicable pull towards this strange man who he had only known a few hours, but who he didn't wish to say goodbye to yet.
"So, you never told me your name," Dean said, cringing internally.
Cas, badass angel of the Lord could very well be as petty as a child throwing a tantrum when he wanted to. It was like he was out to get Sam’s blood and Sam wasn’t one to back down from a challenge, either. The rest of game night honestly felt like it was completely between Cas and Sam but Dean wasn’t paying attention. He was too busy dwelling on what Cas had said. Eventually though, he passed it off as a random noise Cas had made in indignation.
And then Dean felt his chest might burst from the sudden fondness that filled him, warming him from head to toe. Cas heard the prayer Dean’s soul made to him, a prayer Dean didn’t even know he was making, and felt nothing but tenderness towards his charge. His charge, the Righteous Man who had somehow become the most important thing to him in the whole damn universe.
Distantly, Dean was aware that he was rambling but he didn't seem to be able to stop. He always did seem to keep going on and on without so much as a pause when he was nervous. He kept on talking without even knowing what he was saying and then, stopped abruptly when he felt Cas' hand on his arm.
A small smile spread unbidden on his lips as his mind wandered back to that day. He walked as fast as he could to the door, not wanting to keep the kids on the other side waiting. Besides, the sooner he got over with this, the sooner he could get back to Jack. Not that it’d really matter, anyway. He knew he would have to do this several times through the evening.
A year went by in perfect bliss, and then the war came.
Over the next month or so, Dean discovered, after coming across many familiar phrases that Cas regularly used, that the angel had one of the filthiest mouths he’d ever seen on a living creature (not filthy in the way Dean really wanted, of course, but hey, a man could dream). Dean would never have imagined Cas as someone who could swear. Hell, he hadn’t ever even said ‘shit’ out loud. But here the translations were, clearly claiming that Cas had a particularly foul mouth. As the realization hit him, Dean tried, and failed to suppress the hysterical laughs that bubbled out and soon took over him. Goddamnit. Everything about Cas just made him that much more endearing.
“Olani hoath ol,” he whispered to the angel’s retreating form.
When his Angel came back to him.
He backed up against the wall and slid down to the floor.
They had been married for four years when Sam got stabbed.
Dean had gone out and picked up pizza from a local place he quite liked. Sam, being the health freak that he was, had completely ignored the large box in Dean’s hand and had gone about making himself a salad while muttering something about cholesterol and heart attacks. Dean, as usual, had tuned out all that bullshit and began munching on a slice. That was when Cas came in.
“Hello, Dean. Were you looking for me?”
It didn’t matter what circumstances they found themselves in.
could have prepared him for the first day that Cas walked into the kitchen the afternoon he’d moved in.
The man smiled, staring into the embers. "You never asked."
They say eyes are windows to the soul. Dean and Cas think that’s a major understatement but they can understand the sentiment behind it.
The third time it happened was a few weeks later, in the kitchen.
“What was that thing that Cas said?” Dean asked, biting into a strip of bacon. Sam shrugged.
. The most ethereal, mesmerising blue eyes Dean had ever seen stood out in a pallid and gaunt face. A mop of messy, windswept dark hair and a rough stubble framed the man's sunken visage. He was clad in rags and was shivering visibly. He had no possessions save for a tattered coat that was much too big for him, pulled tightly over his shoulders, flapping in the wind.
Jack fell asleep after that. Castiel had taken the dishes back down to clean and returned to check on his son only to see him leaning back against the headrest, head lolling to the side, mouth slightly open. The book had fallen from his loose hands onto his lap. Castiel smiled. He took the book from Jack’s hand and put it on the bedside table before maneuvering him into a more comfortable position on the bed. His lashes fluttered a bit but otherwise he gave no indication of waking up. Castiel tucked the blankets more securely around him and as he leaned down to kiss his son’s forehead, he noticed that his temperature had gone down.
He got started on those books as soon as he got back to his room after lunch that day. These proved to be far more interesting and informative, Everything Dean had read up till this point had led him to believe that humans considered Enochian a dead language and that the vocabulary that they had compiled into their dictionaries was very limited. These books, however, they were a gold mine. And Dean learnt more in a day than he had in weeks.
They got to know, over the next few days, that Cas had the biggest sweet tooth they’d ever seen (okay, maybe discounting Gabriel). Anything with sugar was devoured at the earliest possible opportunity by the angel. Dean couldn’t even bring himself to be pissed when Cas stole his pie because the blissed out look on his face made Dean’s heart flutter. He barely even said a word and instead offered Cas more pie.
He was going to learn Enochian. Or try to, at least.
Dean shuffled in, bumping into Castiel’s shoulder as he made his way through the door. The brief contact made the butterflies renew their attack on his stomach and his cheeks grew warm, Almost as warm as Jack’s forehead. Oh god, this was embarrassing. He was blushing like a goddamn schoolgirl with a crush. He mentally berated himself. He was a goddamn adult and he needed to act like it. He needed to get it together. He followed Dean into the hallway, who swaggered about like he owned the place. Judging by the amount of time he spent here, maybe it wasn’t actually too far from the truth, Castiel thought as fondness surged in his chest, warming him from head to toe. He couldn’t really help the soft smile that wormed its way onto his lips as he took in the sight of Dean – his best friend, the man he was in love with – walk up the stairs towards Jack’s room.
Cas frowned, eyed Sam’s salad with disdain and promptly grabbed a slice of pizza from the box in front of Dean. The older Winchester just smirked.
Beer in hand, Dean made his way back to the Dean Cave, lost in thought. He sat down on his recliner, absently sipping on his beer. The TV continued to play Dr Sexy but he’d lost all interest in it. His mind kept going back to his previous encounter with Cas. Whatever he’d said was unmistakably in some other language. He replayed the other two times he’d heard Cas say that. Right then, he made up his mind.
"Stay."
Above them, the stars twinkled as if they were rejoicing, too.
They got married two years later. It was the happiest day of Dean's life. When they fell into bed together that night, worshipping each other with lips on bare skin and fell asleep in each other's arms afterwards, Dean thanked whatever gods had brought Cas to him. Never mind that he wasn't a believer. He could never be thankful enough to have met the wonderful man sleeping next to him. He wrapped his arms more securely around his husband (
They looked.
And looked.
By the time Dean got back home, he had almost forgotten about the swan. It raised its head from where it was curled up in a corner, the moment it heard Dean open the door. Dean jumped back and cursed.
When Dean saw Castiel in his vessel, he couldn’t help but be awed by his eyes. His brain screamed at him to see reason and logic. He knew that the thing that had pulled him out of Hell was in all probably evil and definitely dangerous. But those eyes were too captivating. He watched Bobby crumple to the ground but his body refused to cooperate.
Cas shut him up with a kiss.
When Cas found himself briefly in control after Lucifer had taken over him.
Cas froze in his tracks. He turned around to face him, his eyes wide. “Dean?” he said, his voice filled with disbelief and something that sounded strangely like hope.
When his Angel told him he loved him as Death pounded at the basement door.
Dean pouted and walked away to the other side of the library and began looking. Cas had said something again, something in Enochian, probably and that just fueled Dean’s desire to understand even more. He went around inspecting titles, adding the most promising ones to the growing pile supported by his left arm. When there were too many to simply carry around in one hand, he went to the table and set them down. He took a minute to look around and noticed that Cas was gone. He sighed, looking at the pile in front of him and finally sat down and got started.
And looked.
It was a chaotic evening. Dividing his time between looking after Jack and handing out candy was easier said than done. With Jack’s temperature suddenly rising and the throngs of children that came to his doorstep gleefully shouting “Trick or treat!” Castiel didn’t exactly have time to relax, even for a bit. He ended up almost burning the soup, running from the doorstep where he’d been handing out candy to the stove just in the nick of time. The pouty faces on his doorstep when he returned led to pangs of guilt stabbing him in the chest. He apologized profusely and let them have extra candy to make up for his late arrival.
), mumbling random words in Enochian at parts he simply could not fathom. Dean was slumped back on the recliner, tired and almost asleep when Cas shook him.
“Jack…” Castiel started but he was interrupted before he could say anything else.
“Earth to Cas! You listening, buddy?”
They looked.
The next night wasn’t any easier.
And something in Dean screamed at him that the trench coat clad man, no matter what kind of creature, could be trusted. The thought came out of nowhere, defying all logic. But it remained. And Castiel, well he could feel their bond beginning to resurface. That was strange in itself. He had never felt anything, or so he thought. But they looked into each other’s eyes. And they saw past what most people see.
And both of them feel nothing but love and pure joy and gratitude that they get to lie here in each other’s arms, in their house, with their family safe and happy. With both of
Of course Cas wouldn’t be that considerate, not when it came to donuts.
When the man spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper.
He looked around in the dark, contemplating what to do. He had to be at work early the next morning and he already earned just barely enough to afford two meals a day. But he couldn’t just leave this beautiful, helpless bird here to perish from its injuries. It felt wrong, inhuman. He looked down at the swan once again and saw that it was staring at him, bright blue eyes almost pleading. In a split second, he made his decision. Everything else be damned, Dean couldn’t let the bird die painfully like this. He picked it up carefully, as if he were picking up a little babe, and took it into his house as the bird shut its eyes and leaned its small head against his chest.
The following weeks were not easy for Dean. Benny was still not back, having to take care of both his sick wife and his little daughter, which meant that the entire responsibility of overseeing the kitchens fell on Dean. Alistair had had a little falling out with his fellow knights and took out all his anger and frustration on Dean, snapping at any minor inconvenience, even if it was in no way Dean’s fault. Sam hadn’t been able to make time for his usual monthly visits for almost half a year, owing to a particularly tricky case that he was working, and this month was no exception. Charlie always took a few minutes out of her day to talk to Dean and sometimes, if they were lucky, to bring him some food. However, most of her free time was spent courting the new maid, a pretty brunette by the name of Gilda.
, kissed the top of his head and fell asleep with an addictive sort of happiness coursing through him.
Castiel smiled again. "Hello, Dean. Thank you for having me here."
Cas was shockingly good at it, absolutely annihilating everyone else. Dean had never thought Cas could get so competitive over something and looking at the angel’s smug face with a smirk that was more in his eyes than on his lips, Dean’s couldn’t help the way something in his chest fluttered. The self satisfied look was promptly wiped off Cas’ face when Sam bought a property that he’d been eyeing for quite a few rounds now.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” he said, running a hand through his hair. “You’re going to be the death of me.”
,” Cas said, throwing a dirty glare towards Dean before he stalked out of the room.
And looked.
Cas hated seeing his husband look so small and defeated. Sure, he was hungry but he cared more about Dean's well being. He couldn’t see his husband work himself into the ground to try and get something more filling for the both of them to eat. Dean went to bed with his muscles all sore and he hardly got enough sleep because of all the stress. The final straw was when Cas woke up one day in the middle of the night to quiet sobbing and found his husband's face buried in his pillow with his back turned towards Cas. He had held Dean tight that night, when he'd stopped crying and they had both pretended in the morning, in some unspoken agreement in an attempt to preserve Dean's dignity, that nothing of note had happened the night before. But Cas had had enough. They needed more money and he wasn't about to let Dean gamble his health over it. So he did the only thing he knew how to. He weaved.
into each other’s eyes.
They looked.
Castiel walked down the stairs and to the door, expecting trick-or-treaters seeking candy in all their excitedly grinning, costumed glory and grabbed the huge bowl of treats that he’d bought the day earlier. He wished Jack could enjoy the day too, as he had done every year without fail since he was a four year old. Castiel still remembered the day when he took Jack out for his first Halloween. He could still hear Jack's pure laughter when he got his first piece of candy from the sweet old lady who lived across the street. He remembered holding Jack's hand as he pranced through the neighbourhood, gleefully rummaging through his pumpkin-shaped candy bucket, taking great pleasure in pointing out every little decoration that caught his eye to Castiel. He’d been completely unfazed by the spooky skeletons and the cobwebs, simply laughing excitedly and running around like a hyperactive maniac.
In Purgatory.
Dean looked at the half eaten donut in his hand. “This was yours? The box wasn’t even marked with one of your stupid sticky notes!”
Dean didn't register the wetness on his cheeks till now. He held Cas tighter in his arms. As dawn broke and the cloth lay half finished on the loom, both men cried for the losses that were yet to come.
The general atmosphere of their home was filled with happiness and for once, even Dean’s pessimism and self destructive nature couldn’t bring itself to sabotage their joy.
Dean had already slept so much all day that sleep eluded him most of the night. Many a time, he debated getting up and asking Cas to get some rest with him but held himself back every time, thinking about Cas' strange request. Eventually, he was lulled to sleep by the rhythmic clicking coming from the other room.
“No. Uh, I actually planned on doing some reading.”
So he was quite surprised to find Cas sitting at the foot of one of the large bookshelves, flipping through an old tome. At the sound of Dean’s footsteps, he looked up.
Cas and Sam didn’t see much of Dean over the next few days. They both assumed he’d gotten hooked to some new series on Netflix. He usually only showed up to eat, retreating back to his room the moment he was done. What they didn’t know, however, was that Dean had been laboring away, devouring every book on Enochian he could get his hands on. It was very hard work, he had to admit, with records based on only limited interactions with angels. But he was nothing if not determined. As challenging as it was, Dean simply refused to quit. Cas had begun incorporating Enochian into his speech a lot more and that just strengthened Dean’s resolve.
His smile fell off his face when he saw Sir Alastair approaching him. Dean wasn’t overly fond of his master. The man may have been a knight, but he was in no way honourable. He was cruel and deceitful and if it were up to Dean, he would never have worked for him. But it was not like Dean had many job options and he did have to earn money to feed himself. So here he was, stuck working in the kitchens of a horrible master, a master who was currently telling him that he was not going to allow Dean a single day off and that he’d have to be here early next morning to make him breakfast.
“Maybe another hour? I don’t know, he didn’t tell me,” Castiel said, shrugging. “I’m sure he’ll be back quite soon, though,” he added, taking in the look on his son’s face.
And then Cas told him his story, face still buried in Dean's chest. His entire family, his brothers and sisters, had been cursed by his aunt who dabbled in black magic. She'd hated her brother and this is how she'd gotten her revenge. Initially, they were stuck in bird form during the day and turned back into humans at night. But later, they were able to control their transformation. Then, one day, a hunter shot Cas. His family abandoned him. And that is how Dean found him, and helped him. Cas had left and tried to find his family, but they refused to take him back. And so he found his way back to Dean. He'd always made Dean promise not to watch him while weaving because his curse also entailed that if anyone saw him in his swan form after they'd seen his human form, he'd be dead within the week.
"I love you, Cas. So, so much. And I have no idea how to express it in words how much you mean to me and how much better you made my life by knocking on my door that night and…"
They stayed like that, lost in the other’s gaze until Dean’s eyes flicked down to Castiel’s lips in a silent question. Castiel smiled at that, at how Dean was always so considerate, before nodding and leaning in till their lips met in a sweet kiss.
These past few weeks, Cas had looked more content than he’d ever looked in all his life. It was as if the burden of the world had been lifted off his shoulders and knowing the kind of life they led, that was probably true. He seemed so much more carefree. He had begun helping around the bunker almost immediately after he set up permanent residence there. In fact, Sam and Jack agreed that Dean’s position as the best cook of the family was definitely in danger. The little patch in the back of the abandoned building that formed the outside the bunker, previously filled with weeds, was now a cheerful looking garden with the sea of vibrant colours covering every available surface, under Cas’ ministrations.
“When’s Uncle Dean gonna come back?” Jack asked suddenly, breaking the silence between them.
Dean laughed so hard at the surprised and mortified face that Sam was making that he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d fall out of his chair. Cas and Sam continued to banter as Cas stuffed his face with pizza, much to Dean’s amusement.
But things got better over time.
"Well, then, what is your name?" Dean asked, somewhat embarrassed.
His small frown morphed into a smile as he saw Dean for the second time that evening, his hands occupied with a bag bursting full of candy. “Heya, Cas!” he said, grinning and pushed past him to go up the stairs. By the time Castiel came back to his senses and called out “Jack’s asleep!” Dean had already disappeared into his son’s room. He heard laughter as he walked up the stairs and realised that the doorbell must have woken Jack up.
Dean tried, but he knew nothing whatsoever about caring for a bird and whenever he touched the swan, it made a weak little sound as if it were in pain, and shied away. No matter what Dean tried, nothing helped. It was no surprise then, that eventually Dean grew frustrated, threw his hands up in surrender and decided to leave the swan alone. For a brief moment, Dean thought that he could be in his bed, asleep right now if only he’d left the swan outside. He immediately banished that thought, guilt coursing through him. He got up and got some grain and a bowl of water for the swan. He put them in front of it and as the swan leaned in and fed, Dean made himself comfortable on his bed. Before he knew, he was drifting off and the last coherent thought he had before he fell into slumber, under the swan’s watchful blue eyes, was that he would nurse it back to health, no matter what it took.
The first night was difficult.
When Cas betrayed them to work with Crowley.
They were the colour of Cas' eyes.
"Cas? What the hell are you doing here?" Dean asked, as he wiped a plate and kept it aside.
The sun came up before they even knew it. One moment they were laughing over a story that Cas had been narrating and the next they suddenly became aware of the weak golden rays streaming in through the partially open window. Dean got up and opened it entirely, letting the cold, fresh morning breeze fill the room and making them both shiver. A comfortable silence settled upon both of them and they stayed like that for several minutes, content simply with each other's company. After a while, Cas finally spoke up.
“Is that… My donut?” Cas said slowly, as if he could not believe the sight in front of him.
It didn’t last forever, though. The swan was a creature of nature, of the water and the sky. It was unfair to keep it here, in Dean’s house, when it had healed completely. So, months after Dean had taken the swan in, he gathered it in his arms, took it outside and let it go. The swan nuzzled against his neck one last time and Dean watched it as it flew away, till it was nothing but a tiny black speck in the vast blue sky.
"Hello, Dean," Cas said, going up to Dean and kissing him gently. Dean held Cas close and buried his face in his chest. They stayed there for a long while, just finding comfort in each other's embrace, before Cas pulled back and patted the package of bread he'd brought with him. They didn't even have the energy to move to the table and get plates to eat. They simply settled close together in bed and ate straight from the package. Afterwards, when Cas had cleaned up, he decided to get to work. He got out of bed and Dean made a protesting sound.
They’re sitting in their backyard now, on the grass, watching the stars. Tomorrow morning, Cas will water all his flowers and Dean will get to work cleaning their little house and Miracle will run around, begging for pets from the both of them. But they are content in this moment.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean spoke, that easy smile that made his eyes twinkle, melting Castiel’s heart.
“Page, g geh blans. Ol trian paaox g page.”
As he stood at the counter chopping vegetables, his mind wandered and finally settled, as it often did, on Dean. The smile that always made him go weak in the knees. The sandy blond hair he always wanted to run his hands through. The smattering of freckles on his face, far more beautiful than the constellations in the night sky, standing out even more when he blushed. The way his eyes twinkled with mischief and warmth. His beautifully kissable pink lips. His kindness, his loyalty and the way he was always there for him and Jack even if he didn’t have to be. Castiel was so in love with him.
"I suppose I should be on my way now."
Cas swallowed. “Dean and I might have our disagreements but there’s something he’s absolutely right about.
All it took was a moment.
“Hell if I know. I was probably Enochian? I honestly don’t have a clue, man.”
Dean had soon learnt that Cas was
Belatedly, Dean realised that he'd just been standing there with his mouth hanging open, without actually giving a reply.
It was worth it, though, when he saw Jack’s face light up as he brought him a generous helping of the soup to his room. He was hunched over the book but straightened when Castiel knocked on the already wide open door before coming in.
Dean hadn't meant to fall asleep. He'd wanted to stay up all night, watching his husband, kissing him. But sleep he did, for he had his husband in his arms in their bed for the first time in weeks, and he couldn't help the exhaustion catching up on him.
And looked.
And looked.
With a sigh, Dean walked back into his house and immediately, his eyes fell upon a single, long black feather in a corner. Dean was taken aback by the sudden tears that filled his eyes. He gently, reverently picked up the feather and cradled it to his chest before placing it on the small table next to his bed.
Cas just shrugged. “What’s the point of eating if I can’t eat the good stuff?” He said through a mouthful of pizza. Dean laughed at the look on Sam’s face.
This particular morning, Sam had just come back from his morning run, all flushed and sweaty. Cas had been sitting at the kitchen table, on his second cup of coffee and still looking like a grumpy cat. Dean thought it was cute and had to turn back towards the stove to hide his smile as he fried some bacon. Sam, the big lug completely ignored the fresh juice he usually downed after a run and made a beeline towards the coffee pot and emptied the entire thing into his mug. Dean raised an eyebrow at Sam.
Dean was starved, exhausted and lonely.
They were both looking at him, eyebrows raised and adorable little pouts on their scrunched up faces. Those two bastards were teaming up against him. Dammit. He was fucked.
The next few nights, Cas barely slept at all. Every night, he coaxed Dean into bed and then sat down with his loom in the other room. Every night, Dean fell asleep to the clicking of the loom and the spot on the bed next to him cold and empty. And every morning Dean woke up to an empty bed and a deafening silence, meaning Cas had finished his work. Every morning he found Cas slumped in the chair, or on the floor, asleep. Every morning he seemed more pale and haggard, more gaunt and thin. Worry marred his face even as he slept, and he shivered from the cold. Three days into this routine, Dean asked him to stop. Every day, when Dean woke his husband with a kiss to feverish skin, he begged him to stop exerting himself so much, to stop weaving and rest. And every day, Cas gave him the same answer, that this was the only way that they'd ever make enough money.
It was just a moment, caught as they were in the heat of battle.
The man had made himself comfortable next to the dying fire and gestured to the space beside him, silently asking Dean to join him. Dean obliged, ungraciously plopping himself down next to the man. His cheeks appeared even more sunken in the light of the fire and Dean found himself wondering when was the last time the man had eaten anything.
Wordlessly, Dean got up. He pulled a black feather out of his nightstand that had replaced his bedside table.
Just as they'd hoped, Cas got paid handsomely for the cloth. More than the two of them had predicted, even. No longer did they have to go hungry to bed. No longer did they have to fall ill working themselves to the bone to earn enough for something to eat. Dean thought he'd never have the words to express how proud and grateful he was for Cas. So he did the only thing he knew how to. He showed him. They went to sleep that night with a pleasurable ache in their limbs, full bellies and smiles.
The second time it happened was the morning after game night.
The next morning, when he woke up, Cas wasn't there. Dean felt irrationally sad. This was the second day in a row that he'd woken up without his husband in his arms. There was also a sense of worry gnawing at him. Why hadn't Cas come to sleep when he'd been so tired after work? Had something happened to him? Had he fallen asleep on the cold floor in the next room? Was he sick? Just as Dean was contemplating breaking his promise and looking for Cas, the door opened and in walked his husband, leaning against the door frame.
“I’ll be back in a minute, alright? Stay still.” Castiel said, smoothing back Jack’s hair from where it was lying damp and flat on his forehead. Jack nodded, looking absolutely despondent. When he saw Castiel’s expression soften even more, he put on a tired but brave smile and whispered an “okay”. Castiel smiled back and got up from the chair, pushing it back from where it was lying close to his son’s bed.
Dean could swear that the wide, gummy smile that graced Cas' face was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He smiled in return, so wide that it hurt but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. Before he knew it, Dean found himself pulled into a tight hug which he returned just as enthusiastically. He buried his face in Cas' neck, breathing in the addicting smell of rain and flowers and reveling in the warmth that spread through him, making him happier than he had been in weeks.
Castiel sighed. “Fine,” he said. “But if you get too much candy and Jack ends up getting cavities, I’m never letting you two near each other again.”
Cas blinked in surprise. Dean sighed, knowing there was no taking it back now. And he didn't want to. It felt good to say it.
Over the years, no matter how bad things got, no matter how many betrayals and losses and tragedies, and tears shed and hearts broken, their eyes became each other’s home. Their lingering gazes, sometimes passionate, sometimes tender, sometimes neither or both, bore a sense on familiarity. Neither uttered a word, yet they carried out entire conversations in a language only they understood. Whenever shit hit the fan, they knew they’d find something worth shouldering the burden of hope behind the other’s eyes.
"Castiel," the man said.
And so they went, back and forth, till Dean finally conceded, on the condition that Cas would buy his own bed when he'd made enough money. They talked some more, over some hard bread that Dean had bought and went to sleep content, excited for the morning to come.
“What?” Castiel asked stupidly, blinking slowly. Dean chuckled and Jack’s little squeaky voice piped up.
"Yeah, I kind of understand what you mean. My dad, he left Sammy and me to fend for ourselves most of our childhood while he just sat there and drank as much alcohol as he could get his hands on. And then he went and married another woman and had a son with her. They were nothing like our dad though, and Kate and Adam were always nice to us. I wish they were still here, though," Dean said wistfully.
It was a really cold night. The fire in the tiny fireplace had all but died out. Dean was curled up in a foetal position in his bed, shivering despite being wrapped up in his warmest sheet. His stomach growled angrily in hunger as he tried to shut everything out and fall asleep. He rubbed his hands up and down on his arms in an effort to warm himself. Seconds turned into minutes and after almost an hour later, when he had finally managed to numb his senses, the sound of knocking reverberated in the tiny room. Dean groaned and decided to ignore it, curling up further into himself and pulling the sheet tighter around him. A few minutes passed and Dean had just begun to think that whoever it was had gone away when the knocking sounded again, this time louder and more urgent.
But some things one has to just discover on their own.
Even with their occasional fights and disagreements, Dean and Cas were happy.
And when Dean caught glimpses of something otherworldly behind the blue, he felt oddly reassured.
"Dean," he said, smiling softly. "I'd love to stay, but are you sure?"
“I love you.” His voice was tender and adoring, as he tried to pour all the warmth and feeling swirling in his chest into those two words.
“Thank you for getting all that candy for Jack. I hated seeing him so miserable and if you weren’t here, I don’t know what I would’ve done.”
Dean only had to take one look in his unnaturally blue eyes before nodding in certainty. "Absolutely," he said. "I'd love to have you here."
"I'm used to sleeping in much worse conditions, Dean. I absolutely refuse to let you waste your hard earned money on another bed."
Dean clutched the feather to his chest and cried.
Sam raised his eyebrows. “You really gonna eat all that unhealthy stuff, Cas?”
Dean's mind was blank. He blurted out the only thing he could think of.
“Yeah, no shit, Sherlock,” Dean mumbled sleepily. He got up from the recliner, yawning and shuffled back to his room, falling into slumber the moment he hit the memory foam.
So Cas once again turned to what he did best. He brought home the small loom with him one evening. Dean was too desperate to even protest. Cas sent him to the bedroom, after making him promise not to walk in on him while he was weaving. Dean was just too drained to protest. He simply nodded and went to sleep.
Cas looked terrible. His usually tan skin was clammy and pale, and he seemed to be unable to stand on his feet without support. There were beads of sweat clinging to his temples and his breathing was laboured. His hair was even messier than usual. His eyes, normally such a vivid blue, looked glassy, with dark bags under them. But he had a huge smile on his face. Dean immediately got up and walked up to him, cupping his cheek with one hand.
The feather had seen better days. It was bent at odd angles. The barbs were ruffled now and some of them were torn. The feather had lost its shine. The inky black was dull now. It didn't look like anything special. It didn't look like it could be woven into the most beautiful kind of cloth. It didn't look like it had once belonged to the most important person in the world.
“I wanted to be like you!” Jack exclaimed excitedly. Met with Dean’s blank stare, he clarified. “Because you’re Batman!”
All it took was a moment.
Quite some time went by before Dean showed up. Castiel had taken to keeping the door open and sitting near it, so that the sound of the doorbell wouldn’t wake Jack up. The crowd of children seeking candy had thinned considerably by now, with only older kids coming to his doorstep. Afterwards, Castiel sat on the couch in the living room, reading through the manuscript that his client (and very close friend), Charlie had sent to him. Charlie had a way of absorbing people into her words, with thrilling plotlines and an intriguing style of writing. It wasn’t a surprise that her books were such a huge success. Castiel had just been reading a particularly gripping scene with the Queen of Moondoor and her consort, the fairy Gilda planning to overthrow her tyrannous master, when the shrill sound of the doorbell echoed throughout the house. He groaned as he put his laptop down and got up to open the door.
There it was again, Dean thought. A little foreign word thrown in with his threat. He looked over at Sam who was smirking.
After they'd calmed Eileen down enough, she finally started telling them what had happened. The movements of her hands were not as fluid as they usually were, and she was ready to collapse but she kept going. Sam had recently proved a rich, influential merchant guilty of thievery, fraud and harassment, among other things. The man, angered by this, had hired men to kill Sam and his wife in their sleep. But they'd failed. Eileen had gotten away and Sam had been stabbed, but he was still alive. He was with a healer, Fergus Crowley, who had been treating him since Sam had been brought to him. But his injuries were grave and no one knew if he'd even make it through the night.
