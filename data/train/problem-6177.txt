Tony and Steve look at one another. It’s a short moment where they decide on it together. Steve is the one who speaks up.
“What are you talking about? Where are we going?” asks Scott, who is being kept out of the conversation. Natasha and Clint stop him, both of them knowing that they shouldn’t interrupt the two as they’re brainstorming like this.
Tony moves to turn the helmet off, though he lingers his thumb over the left eye. It’s over. He doesn’t have it in him anymore. Feeling the chill of endless space, Tony puts on the coat he found a few days earlier. It barely keeps him warm, but it’s better than nothing.
“It’s not a- it’s not- It’s nothing,” Quill quickly interjects, trying to shake it off. Of course, that’s when Peter decides to make this whole thing worse.
“Right, well. Imagine you’re SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?”
Walking outside, Tony finds that it’s good outside. The weather’s pleasant, the sun shining through the few clouds that are in the sky. He never thought he would enjoy living in the nature that much, but here he is.
“Can you do it?” asks the young girl with a shivering voice as her accent breaks through, again. Shuri glances at her, her playful smirk suddenly disappearing as understanding dawns on her.
He’s been so focused on Scott and Steve that he barely noticed Natasha moving aside until she’s facing him again. Her expression looks broken, her eyes red. Tony’s words are obviously hurting her, and the man quickly realizes it’s the first time he’s seen her so emotional. As long as he’s known her, he never saw Natasha cry.
Tony didn’t think for too long before he was scurrying to where Peggy waited for him. She was up to something, and he was trying desperately to figure it out. “Where are we going?” he asked in a hushed whisper, hoping they were far enough away from his father to finally speak, or whisper at least.
“Oh, Tony…” Maria started fully crying as he hugged her son once more. “I love you so much… and I want you to be happy and free of your sickness. If this is the way to do it, then I’m okay with it as well.”
Noticing his omega gagging, Steve rubbed Tony’s thigh comfortingly. “Easy… After today, things will be better.”
“I knew that was never the type of omega you wanted to be. Having Steve as your alpha so far seems like the best option for you, despite what you father may think.”
“I can take you to my lab, just remember not to touch anything unless I say so. Also, it’s mandatory that any new visitors greet my babies, Dum-E and U. They crave affection.”
Steve smiled and nodded. “Very. Jarvis is already cleaning up our room, so we don’t have to worry about that.”
“I missed you too, Steve.” Tony smiled, feeling a warmth rush to his belly, a spike of need running through him.
“Steve you go left, I’ll take the right,” Bucky shouted out. “We’ll see if we can flank them and get their focus on us, then the rest can make a running front towards the base and let loose.”
“Well, my dad did tell me to stay here today because of the weather… But if Steve is here then to hell with that.” Tony smirked and rushed to his bedroom to change. He was back at the door with the apartment keys in hand quicker than Bucky had time to process the whole thing. “Let’s go!”
The rest of the day was spent relaxing and finding out what foods Tony could tolerate eating or what foods he was having cravings for. They knew for sure that cheese was out of the question for any foods, and there were a few others that Tony gagged at and nearly had to run to the bathroom after smelling. His cravings weren’t very bad yet, much to Maria’s relief, and she hoped that her son’s cravings didn’t get worse. Nevertheless, Tony was starving, and he managed to grab enough food to satisfy his hunger in the moment.
“Always a pleasure, Mister Stark.” The butler bowed with a smile, watching Tony walk away as he cleaned up the empty glasses and the bottle of whiskey. “And don’t forget that water.”
“No, he didn’t force me. I… well, he didn’t know I was in Europe for the first one, and he made me stay in London for the last one before he sent me home. Though that was probably for the best because--”
The doctor raised an eyebrow. “You know… from all that I’ve seen here, I can almost guarantee I know what Tony has.”
“You would think, but he gets really upset when I do things I’m not supposed to because I’m an omega. It’s not fair at all, but I guess I can deal with it until… well, I can deal with it.”
“Where am I?” Steve asked, trying not to sound threatening. He didn’t know who he was up against just yet, but he didn’t feel safe.
“Alright, well, if you need anything, dear, don’t hesitate to ask.” Maria pulled back and cupped her son’s face. “I love you.”
Try as hard as she did, Peggy could not make all the alphas return to their tents. Several followed her and Tony all the way to the medical tent, where Peggy threw back the flap and helped Tony inside. Only then did the alphas stop when a nurse told them all to back off and that this omega did not need their help.
Tony worried his lower lip as he looked down into his empty glass, “My therapist says it wasn’t my fault…” he muttered, “She says it’s important that I remember that when I want to blame myself for losing my baby… He used to hit me...even when knowing I was pregnant, and it’s not my fault he did that, even if he tells me it was my fault… Should have pressed assault charges but I was too afraid…” He sighed and pushed his glass away from him before looking up at Steve, “Can we go home before I down more of those? I’m supposed to be quitting the whole drunk thing… Pepper’s probably already seen and has her disappointed face on…”
Sighing again, Howard greeted Jarvis and told the family butler of his plans. The older man nodded his head and dished out a bowl of soup for both father and son before placing them on a tray with glasses of water. Howard thanked Jarvis and made his way back upstairs to Tony’s bedroom.
There was silence between them once more. Only the sounds of rain, passing cars, and Tony’s sobs filled the air as the omega processed everything. He was a man of science and math, and yet relationships confused the hell out of him because of this one faulty equation Steve had given him. How the hell was Tony supposed to be okay with this alpha, who had acted like he liked him, suddenly leaving without a second thought as to how this would affect the omega? Steve even knew from the start Tony had wanted to go with him to Europe!
With the manor once again rid of the male beta, a lot of tension seemed to dispel, much to the relief of Tony. He knew it was difficult to hide things from his father, but somehow he and Steve had managed to keep from Howard just how intimate the two were. It surprised Tony a little, but he wasn’t going to complain. Any time away from his father and keeping this secret successfully from him was a good time for Tony.
Tony sucked in a breath, coughed, and then headed into the hallway that led into the base. “Come on, we have to help Steve.”
It was in the very early hours of the morning when Tony finally gave up on trying to make himself feel better. He gave into his exhaustion several times, only to wake up an hour later each time and feel the need to create some sort of friction. At some point, he eventually fell asleep and stayed asleep for the rest of the dark and cold night.
Steve nodded. “Of course. I know how much you want to work on your own projects, so I’d let you have one so you could be just as creative as your father without the restriction of being an omega.”
“Right, thanks, J!” Tony walked over to the desk that was shoved in a corner and buried under boxes that were labeled different MIT projects. He opened the drawer and grabbed a mechanical pencil, holding it up in victory. “Got it! Oh, and you can also use this.” He also grabbed the chair that sat at the desk, wheeling it over to Steve to hand both items over.
Tony shook his head, swallowing the chocolate. “No one likes to give out suppressants to an unbonded omega. Kinda fucked, but that’s life.”
“We’ll just have to look. And who knows, maybe we’ll both get lucky and find something we both like.”
“Maybe omegas will have more rights in the future. Then maybe when I’m 50 I can take his name off my identity as my caretaker.” Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony scoffed. “How cheesy. Blaming kissing some random beta on thinking about me, the omega you’re bonded with and have been in a relationship with for months now.”
The omega sighed and looked at the floor. “When Dad is off to London, I’m coming with you, Steve. I want involved in this too. I can do the same things my dad does, but he wants me home to be a good omega, like I should be.”
Phillips lowered his eyebrows. He shook his head. “I can’t touch Stark, he’s rich, and he’s the army’s number one weapons contractor, you are neither one.”
"Honestly I wanted to do this the day I caught you kissing that private," the omega said in a rough tone. "But I made you wait, and I've made myself wait, and I can't wait any longer." Tony reached down and unbuckled Steve's belt while maintaining eye contact with those intense blue eyes.
Steve nodded, knowing that even with himself being there, the pharmacy likely wouldn’t give him more pills. “Alright, let’s get out of here. You’re getting more upset by the moment, and I think we deserve some time to relax this afternoon.”
“Tony, slow down please,” Maria said in a sad tone, reaching a hand over to grab her son’s wrist. “You’re going to make yourself sick, dear.”
Tony noticed the nervous ticks, and he reached out to still Steve’s hands. “Something’s on your mind.”
Tony’s mind halted for a second. There was a hint of something in Steve’s voice that he didn’t like. His stomach tightened up in anxiety.
“I think I can agree with you on this one thing. I’d rather see them all be brought down to equal levels as everyone else. They’re too high in society and have too little expected of them. Find an omega, settle down, have a family, forget about your family and find a younger, prettier omega that catches their eyes.”
“Yeah, he came home from the war in August, and we spent my August and December heats together. I don’t see how this is important to my being sick.” Tony groaned and grabbed his head, carefully making his way back to the bed.
“Training is really intense, Tony. You go nonstop for weeks, and your breaks are very short. Are you sure you can handle that?”
"Now maybe you'll learn to make the changes you want yourself rather than depending on drugs to do it for you." Howard tossed the bottle into the trash, leaving Tony to be by himself in the bathroom. "By the way, I'm sending you home as soon as your heat is over."
Tony heard his name called out by his alpha, and he let out a louder whine as he looked around more frantically until a path cleared out before him, and suddenly Steve was there. Tony’s legs moved on their own as he ran to Steve as fast as he could, jumping into the alpha’s arms as Steve met him halfway down the cleared path. Those strong alpha arms picked up Tony from the ground and held him tight, as if it had been years since they had seen each other and not just half a year. Tony was so caught up in the moment that he wrapped his legs around Steve’s torso and held on tight, taking in his scent and relaxing in the familiarity of it. He didn’t even care that they were only hugging and taking in each other’s scents. Kissing be damned, this was the closest Tony had ever felt to his alpha before.
Before too long the two met up with Peggy once more, the three of them going to greet the colonel. The look Tony got from the older man didn't go unnoticed by the omega. He simply lowered his eyes to avoid too much confrontation. Having a staring contest wasn’t what this meeting was about.
As intriguing as mathematics were to Tony, it never caught his attention for more than a couple hours. After that, he checked out completely. He glanced around the room and wandered over to Peggy, watching the reports she was working on while they waited for Steve. That captured his attention for about 20 minutes before he sighed and went off to find a chair to sit in and think of something else to do. Nothing came to mind. Tony was bored and without any paper or pencil to write down equations that would take him out of his boredom. He couldn’t go anywhere in the base really, because no one wanted him to mess anything up, not that he was really interested in the files they had unless they were blueprints for future weapons. His father wouldn't allow him to go anywhere in the base either. Tony felt like he was being watched by a babysitter, just like when he was a kid.
“You could have asked for real meals during your heat,” Maria said. “We would have gladly made you something.”
“Not to mention when I dated him he wouldn’t let me dance with others, so why should I dance with him when I’m dating someone else?”
Tony managed to leave the Stark apartment with a small smile on his face, carrying a ball of blankets that vaguely smelled like his alpha. That scent would be renewed soon, something that Tony looked forward to. He was still upset, however, that his heat was basically being forced to happen. This heat was probably going to be the worst one yet, which held almost no promise of feeling anything but pain, even if Steve was there to accompany him. However, despite the pain that was surely to come for at least a few days, Tony was determined not to let it hinder him. He was still a soldier, although having only brief training, and soldiers pushed through the worst of times.
“I’m worried about that too… but we can’t give up on him. Come on, there’s a building over there that we haven’t checked yet,” Peggy said, pointing across the street.
Tony sighed, “Someone going to gimme the arty folder to look at while you two do the paperwork? I still haven't seen any of this guy’s work, you know. I trust you, Pep, you know I do, but I think I should get a taste of the guy before I open my wallet.”
Steve, Peggy, and Howard all looked stunned as Tony left. The omega had never picked up a gun in his life, and seeing him shoot at Steve had set them all on edge.
Tony’s mind was still in heat mode, despite having mostly clear thoughts. He could only manage to say one word in response to Steve’s praise. “Alpha…”
Fury rounded a corner that led to a set of metal doors. He went through them while gesturing for Steve to follow. Behind the doors was what looked like a full medical center ready to take patients., which he hadn't seen in so long. Most medical centers and hospitals he remembered seeing were filled to the brim with wounded soldiers, and normal patients had to either make house calls or go somewhere else to get treatment. Now it looked like doctors could attend to multiple patients at a time without worrying too much about the patients being stable under a nurse's care.
“Extremely. I want to go dance, but I’ll look stupid around everyone else. Besides, I think most of these people expect me to act like an actual omega…” Tony sighed and rolled his eyes.
“Ah, a blank canvas!” The employee clapped his hands together with a large smile. “I can tell you’re new at clothes shopping. Mind if I help you find something?”
When they arrived at the camp they were performing at, Tony almost instantly felt hundreds of eyes watching him. They knew he was an omega, any alpha could tell he was, but he hoped they were decent enough to leave him alone as his body started shifting over to needs that he himself didn't want but his body couldn't help but crave. If only they could get a tent or something else to themselves. Tony really didn’t want to be around any alphas when he went into heat.
And then finally the gates of the base came into view. Tony was on the edge of the passenger seat almost immediately, his eyes trained on the single plane that was parked near a hangar, several people scattered around it moving cargo and striking up light conversations. Tony didn’t see the three men he would recognize instantly, and his heart started beating faster as he worried they didn’t make it back to the states. He was so caught up in his thoughts that he didn’t remember getting past the gates and heading towards that very hangar that probably housed Steve, Bucky, and Howard. He didn’t register that his mother was saying things to him, probably about how he should act as soon as they parked, but Tony wasn’t listening even in the slightest. All Tony’s mind could handle thinking about was Steve and how close he was once more.
Howard quickly ran through lines of action. He saw knives on Tony’s belt, but that wasn’t going to help unless he needed to carve a line or hole into his son. Then his mind returned to the reactor. Remembering his own designs, he knew the reactor had some sort of electromagnet inside it. And of course magnets either repelled or attracted metal, depending on the magnetic levels of the metal. If the reactor had saved Tony for hours until he had taken it off, then it only made sense that the reactor had been pulling away the shrapnel from Tony’s heart.
“Go choke on a dick,” Tony hissed, trying with all his might to fight back, break free as he heard Peggy cry out for him.
The omega looked up mid bite, eyes wide. He lowered his spoon into the bowl of cereal he had been eating and got up. “Who is it? Why do you look so down?”
“...Fuck, Steve, if this Hydra omega rights thing is legit, you are totally biting my neck.” Tony breathed out, his eyes wide and his heart pounding in his chest.
Steve chuckled, hearing the music swell along with his cue to go on. “You’ll have to see it on me a couple more times before I move on to the next one. The media likes how I look right now, so it’s sticking.”
“Yes, I heard him, and you’ll do just fine without him until he gets back. You know I’m here for you, and so is Jarvis. We’ll both take care of you, Tony.”
“I asked for an army and all I got was you.” Colonel Phillips pursed his lips together. “You are not enough.”
“Just let us know ahead of time,” the omega said. “So we can have a room set up for you to stay in.”
“I love you two so much,” Tony said. “But I have a chance at not being sick any more. There’s a chance Steve is still alive and is just waiting to be found, and I want to be there when he wakes up. Mate sickness goes both ways, after all. I don’t want him to suffer like I have for five long years.”
Behind them, the grenade went off, turning the nearest vehicle into a fireball. The whole effect snowballed until each of the vehicles turned into giant balls of flames. The last one was so close to the three running back to the rest of the commandos, Tony felt himself jerk forward from the power of the explosion. Thankfully the three were able to get back to the others before hundreds of Hydra agents popped out from nowhere and started shooting. The Howling Commandos took shelter behind trees, shooting back when they could, but they were given very little opportunity to shoot. Stuck behind the trees, Tony made a frustrated groan. This wasn’t how he thought his first fight against Hydra was going to go.
“Alright, now don’t get too excited with Steve,” the agent warned with a playful smile. “I know how omegas can get when around a handsome alpha. You’re still weak and need the
Steve shook her hand and smiled. "Thank you for contacting me. I hope I didn't rush you through your lunch."
Tony woke up the next morning to a knock on his door, shivering at the desk provided to him by the owner of the apartment building. His feet were uncovered, as was most of his body. It seemed that he had woken up in the middle of the night and decided that he didn’t need clothes to sleep in anymore.
“Good omega.” Tony purred, continuing to pack his personal items from around the dorm room while slowly getting dressed as he found items he wanted to wear.
“You’re shorter?” Steve asked, looking at Tony’s shoes. “Not that that’s a bad thing of course, I just didn’t think that you’d wear platform shoes.”
“Alright, he’s ready to be moved,” Maria said after new clothes had been put on Tony and she had grabbed some towels out of his bathroom. “Let’s wrap him up in these, so he doesn’t get too cold or too dirty again.”
Steve's smile disappeared quickly. "You'll most likely be killed. It would be a shame, seeing as you're probably the most attractive omega I've had the pleasure of having a session with."
“They can’t wait a couple more days? It’s not even a week after Christmas yet,” Steve tried to argue, but the soldier just shook his head.
It’s a good celebration, a good distraction. And to be fair, the whole business about this Thanos completely slips her mind from meeting all these new people. After all, he’s just a guy who collects some stones for his stupid armband.
He quickly demonstrates how it’s supposed to work and Peter quickly catches on. They can’t linger; they’re already losing time as it is.
“The second quadrant,” Hilde says. “I need you to take everybody there. Somebody’s waiting for them.”
“Besides, the purple asshole can’t sense the stone even if it’s right next to him,” Hilde adds as she grins widely.
Tony feels his legs shiver again. He overexerted himself. His body can’t take it anymore. Feeling his head turn, he drops his entire weight onto Steve. That’s when he loses consciousness, again.
They suit up. It’s what they always end up doing. Every one of them has their own thing to wear, adapted to their own body shape – though Tony did have to make some adaptation for Thor’s, as he’s gained even more weight during his time here from all the stress-eating he’s been doing. The constant worrying over his children… that can’t be healthy, right?
“No, no, sitting here and staring at that thing is not going to bring everybody back.” Thor starts rambling after that, speaking faster the more he wants to make his case clear. Tony steps forward and tries to interrupt him.
Wanda can’t explain what she’s feeling. There have been too many deaths today. Though, not only today. She’s lost her parents, her grandparents in Sokovia. She lost her brother when they were trying to fix the mess they created. She lost Peter days ago. How could she even do this?
There’s a loud crash. The lights flicker for a bit, the entire ship shaking. Everybody’s heads turn towards the window, though nothing is to be seen. Immediately, they hurry towards another room. Without telling anything to the person residing there, they storm inside. The man, who had been looking at some video of some sort of space opera looks startled.
“No resurrections this time,” Thanos mutters out, throwing Loki’s body in Thor’s direction and walking towards the rest of the order.
They get to New Jersey, back in 1970. Disguising themselves is a challenge, but they manage to find some stuff to make them less noticeable. Having arrived
“No, he can’t take it,” the woman says in the back, still struggling to get free from the webs Peter threw her way.
Once they’ve reached the lake, Pepper kneels down, putting her wreath of flowers onto the water. Now a soft sniff escapes her. Peter’s breath catches upon hearing it.
She knows that is what Thanos wants. She’s standing in front of Nebula, who’s at the verge of being pulled apart again and again, bringing her in agonizing pain, and Gamora can’t do it anymore. It’s enough.
“But would you be able to rest? Knowing that you’ve found a way to bring Peter back, but never using it?”
“I stand corrected,” Natasha admits while jumping behind a car and raising her gun. It won’t hurt her. The point is to knock her down, rather than hurt her. If possible, simply make her overexert herself.
“So, still think this is like Budapest all over again?” asks Clint as he runs through the streets with bursts of wind thrown their direction. They avoid it, easily. At this point, the attacks are very predictable. Later on, they’ve trained that predictability out of her, but right now she doesn’t yet have that kind of training.
“If you really wanted another kid, you wouldn’t have done this,” she says, tapping the container that’s attached on his shirt. Tony looks down at the sort-of Arc reactor that isn’t really an arc reactor but just something he’s been working on in the past few days. It’s actually something he’s rather proud of, and he’s planning on perfecting it even more in the future.
“It means get lost, Squidward!” Tony knows Steve has told him something about pissing off his enemies, but he just can’t help it. Skinny puts his hands together, slightly turning his head towards the big one holding an axe and telling him something. Tony can’t hear what it is.
Yaël returned to New Asgard with them. Steve has met her son – who is five years old right now. Raido is nearly the spitting image of Loki, except for his darker skin.
Tony chuckles. “I’m certainly going to try,” he agrees. They pull back, look at each other for a few seconds before Rhodey shakes his head and steps back, probably knowing that he should give Peter a moment.
Howard raised an eyebrow as he transferred the meat in his hands to a pan to put in the oven. “Maybe it’s time to move on, then. Find someone back home that you can stay safe with.”
Steve and Tony were going to avenge the death of their friend, and they weren’t going to stop until, like Steve had said, all of Hydra was defeated.
“Yeah, Tony overshares with me sometimes. If you two are going to be mates, you should probably know I’ll likely end up knowing more about your bedroom life than most would feel comfortable with.” Clint said, flopping over in the backseat with his head in Tony’s lap, “Sometimes I have to turn off my ears when he gets too carried away with the details.”
“I’d practice right now with you, but I feel it’d come out too much like a purr right now. I’ll practice with Pepper later.”
"Of course," Steve said. "Working with a big client such as Stark Industries always guarantees NDAs."
Tony sighed. “Yeah… you know, Steve had gotten me suppressants before I left London. Took them for about  a month and delayed a heat, but that month was so nice. I didn’t have to worry about the heat or anything that came with it. I could focus on missions… I wish I had those back.”
“Just some sketches of a new suit for Steve. Figured since he’s got some down time now we can upgrade his costume to something more battle ready.”
“There, now, you’ll be alright,” Jarvis reassured. “Your mother is waiting back at the manor. She made sure that I made your favorite meal.”
Steve chuckled. “Well I think I almost have to at this point. I don’t know why I wouldn’t call you all my family.”
By the time Steve pulled back to breathe, his face was absolutely covered in slick, some even in his hair as he set Tony on his back again and made eye contact with him. Steve’s eyes stayed with Tony’s even as he bent down and placed a kiss at the omega’s navel, leaving a wet spot on Tony’s skin.
Steve put his hand on Tony's once more and smiled at the omega. "It's going to be okay, Tony," he reassured. "I'm here, I'll keep you safe."
“No.” Tony sighed. “We had a fight back in December. I caught him kissing a beta bombshell, but we made up. I just got angry enough at him to slam the frame down on my dresser back in London and I cracked the glass.”
Tony’s honey-brown eyes studied Steve, a spark of interest in them that hadn’t been there before as they roamed along the alpha’s body.
The omega closed his eyes as his mother’s comforting hand rubbed small circles on his chest. “I was scared, Mom… I couldn’t escape that man, and I was weaker than normal because I was going into heat…”
“Sorry, I… misinterpreted, clearly.” Steve cleared his throat. “I’m not usually one to take that train of thought, but…”
It wasn’t long before the attack on the Hydra headquarters was underway. Steve had broken off from the rest of the group, taking a motorcycle with him that was packed full of gadgets and modes that would help him get right to the front gates of the Hydra headquarters. Tony had opposed it to begin with, but Steve explained to him how it was going to make it easier to get into the base. If Hydra was focused on an attack by just one man, then they would be caught off guard when several more came into attack after the one was captured.
Bucky nodded, hugged Tony once more, then hugged Steve. “Gonna miss you guys. See you around the holidays.” He saluted, and then Bucky turned on his heel and walked away from his two friends, a smile on his face the whole time.
Steve watched as Tony left his room, leaving the blond by himself. He knew he had fucked up, but at least they had talked things through a little bit. He just had to wait, and he had to agree with Tony. Steve wished the war would be over soon, because having a family with the spunky omega he had fallen in love with sounded like the best thing in the world. Hell, just getting to propose to him and marry him sounded amazing, getting to mark Tony as his own and fill him up with his kids.
Steve groaned at how beautiful his omega looked. He couldn’t express just how badly he wanted to bite down on that perfect skin and leave his mark on Tony. “I love you so much,” he blurted out.
Tony fell silent as he watched Steve’s reaction, or lack thereof. He hoped that he hadn’t made Steve upset, because that would have been two date nights that they ended with sour notes.
“A great idea, Tony, it really is. But what if Steve is never found? Or what if he’s found dead, not alive?”
Chuckling, Bucky watched the omega excitedly lock the door to the apartment and rush outside. He understood at least a little why Steve had taken a liking to Tony. It was very obvious now; the omega was an energetic guy when he was happy, and a real joy to be around. Bucky had heard about the little spat that happened when Steve had been caught kissing a beta, but to him it looked like Tony had gotten over that and was very ready to see his alpha again.
“I need you to stay,” Steve said in a gentle but firm tone, a tone that made Tony nod in obedience. "Peggy will take care of you and make sure no other alpha comes by."
—!” The omega tensed up, his body trembling inside and out as suddenly he came with a rush of slick, his hole throbbing and twitching, looking for a knot to lock onto.
"It'll be close to enemy lines," Steve explained. "Anyone that close is in danger. So I'm not sure if I want you to come with me."
“Great! You have a more built frame than I’ve seen before on an omega, but I’ll find some things I think will look good on you, and you can try them on and tell me if you like them.”
“And drama-free, with any luck. There’s two of my exes here who both love to stir up crap and antagonize me. I’ll be trying to avoid them fully.”
“You knew better than to come over here, Tony,” Howard snapped. “You have no need to be over here. You’re in heat, you’re staying in a camp surrounded by alphas, which I’m sending you back to with Peggy to watch you until I get back, then you’re getting on the next plane to London and staying there until I return to take you back home.”
“Don’t apologize, I understand, Tony.” The blond pushed his omega back slightly and made him look up. “The great thing about relationships is that there are two people to consider. If this is moving too fast for you, all you have to do is tell me, and I’ll slow down.”
Phillips barely looked over the map before he turned away and started barking out orders. Typical officer, Tony thought to himself.
A couple minutes later the nurse came in and asked what Tony needed, which he told her and said why he wanted the bandages off. The nurse nodded once Peggy agreed with Tony, and she left to grab a couple other nurses to help. Once they were in the room, Peggy stepped out and let the nurses do their jobs. They carefully helped Tony sit up and keep his arms elevated as they unwrapped his ribs. Soon the compression bandages were gone, and the ice was replaced and put back over the broken rib. Tony was laid back against the bed once more, and he let out a sigh, glad to have that little amount of pain gone.
“Oh boy…” James groaned and turned to go into the kitchen to grab a beer. “Don’t forget to put my TV back together, Tony!”
Returning back to the manor finally made Tony sigh in relief. He was ready to get back into his room and cover himself in his own scent again, and he felt the slightest urge to start building up a nest. Tony had no idea what was going to happen when it came time for him to birth his baby, but whatever happened, he hoped Steve would be there to comfort him and to see their baby for the first time.
“Yes?” Tony stopped, repressing a sigh. He knew it’d only be a matter of time before someone he was passing by would do something to grab his attention—and part of his job was to humor such customers.
Through the trees, the team ran, bursting out of the forest with war cries and shouts of “Stay back” and “Keep your distance” floating above the cries. Tony shot at who he could, crying out when one soldier standing next to him suddenly evaporated in a blue haze. He dodged as best as he could around fallen soldiers and Hydra agents, shooting at any Hydra agents he could while also dodging the deadly shots from the guns the agents had. He had known about those weapons, but he hadn’t seen them in action in real life, and heaven be damned if he wasn’t absolutely terrified of those guns.
"They just met last night and already they're obsessed with each other. Not that that's a bad thing, but we were all in a very close space." Bucky shrugged and looked down at Clint.
Tony got up and moved away from backstage to splash some water on his face. War was stressful for everyone, but seemed especially stressful for those who were directly involved in it. Tony didn't
“If you want sci-fi, you should meet JARVIS. I’m still working out a few things in his code, but once I do, he’ll be running the entire building—and my home in Malibu. Right now he’s only running this lab as a test run. Isn’t that right, J?”
“That’s him,” Yaël mutters out, taking a step back. There are five figures standing there at the door-opening. The one sticking out the most is the figure in the middle; a hulk-sized, hulk-built character holding up his balled fist. From the back of his hand, a purple light seems to shine.
But that’s not what Peter would do, is it? Peter wouldn’t give up. He’s too much like Steve. They might not be related by blood, but they have a lot in common. Too much, maybe.
“We have to go,” Vision suddenly says, grabbing Wanda’s hand and making his way back to where they came from.
Dr. Cho instructs Yaël to lie down onto the cot. Loki stands up but immediately kneels down next to her face. Hilde can’t see what’s happening because she must remain focused on getting out of there.
They’re careful not to touch the stones. Rocket is next to him, observing him work with the little mechanical arms connected to FRIDAY. Next to him, Bruce is keeping tabs on the readings of the stone. It’s careful work, but that makes it even more safisfying when it’s finished. Now, all they hope is that it’s not going to explode next to them.
Natasha turns her head so fast that her hair whips along with it. “Vision, get your ass back on the table.”
Thanos’ patience has been tested enough today. He offered her food, and Gamora threw it across the room until it landed onto his ugly chair. She gave out on him, vented out her heart, and yet he’d stayed calm and kept on talking to her as if she were his most precious daughter.
“No, we have to destroy it,” Vision interjects without much hesitation. Somewhere during the conversation he stood up, getting to stand against the window as he looks outside. “I’ve been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head; about its nature but also its composition.”
Another wave of pain hit Tony, and he felt his consciousness fade; his hand falling just out of reach of the reactor. He couldn’t bring himself to move anymore, his pain too great and his breathing just not enough to support such a laborious task. The room spun as he struggled to even breathe. He couldn’t call out for help, he just had to hope that help would soon arrive. If it didn’t…
He should have felt panicked. He should have given out and submitted to all the alphas growling at him, but Tony was stronger now. He could resist those savage growls that demanded he obey, and he almost felt like he could growl back for once. He tried it out, letting out a growl from the back of his throat, though admittedly it wasn’t as strong of a growl as he had wished. It came out more like a weak gurgle, the mask around his mouth and nose not helping in the slightest.
“Get ready as best as you can, and we’ll see if we can get you in to see a doctor today. I’ll call ahead, just to be sure.” Maria stood back up and wiped away more tears.
Nodding, the omega closed his door, wanting nothing more but to crawl back into bed and sleep more. He returned to the desk and looked over the scattered papers filled with drawings. A new design for Steve’s suit was all planned out. Tony must have gotten up in the middle of the night to draw it.
"Yeah," Steve replied just before they had paid for their things and were ready to leave the building. "Let's go before Happy gets too worried about us."
"Your technology still amazes me," Steve said as he moved over to Tony. "I mean you made a fully functioning AI. That alone testifies how amazing and smart you are."
He was lost in thought when a pair of arms wrapped around him from behind. Briefly, he thought it might be Bucky, but the scent that accompanied the arms was spicier, and Tony knew it was Steve after that. He sighed and relaxed in his alpha's arms, closing his eyes.
"I see." Steve bowed his head towards the assistant. "My apologies then. But Ty had better come up with a different approach to earn a proper dance with Tony. Otherwise he can forget about getting a dance."
And yeah, not wanting Fury to know about it is just 100% his Dad. Peter’s entire body loosens up and he finally makes the final steps towards him. Without a warning he wraps his arms around Tony, holding him in a strong hug he never thought he’d ever have again. Immediately, Tony leans his head against Peter’s, putting his hand onto Peter’s back as he tries to hold him tighter.
Had this not been a life-or-death situation, Tony would have made a few remarks that probably aren’t meant for his teammates ears. Luckily, he knows when to hold back. Despite being very impressed by his fiancé’s powerful moves, Thanos still seems to be too much for him.
But they’ve discussed this. There have been countless of conversations about this particular moment, and Steve is not going to pull back now. He even consulted Bucky about it, who seemed to agree with it as well.
“I think some fresh air will clear our minds for a bit,” she assures him, and that seems to be enough to convince Vision. He puts on the coat, grabs his shoes from the ground, and once they’re both ready they take each other’s hands and leave the hotel hand in hand.
“He’s here.” Vision isn’t looking at her. He’s glancing around, trying to find what’s going on around them. She can feel a change in the wind. It feels… quiet, all of a sudden. Even Wanda sits up a bit to check her surroundings, but so far there’s nothing alarming around here.
Pepper catches up to him rather quickly. They’re back to back, circling around each other and using their own individual beams to protect one another.
“You can start by giving us some answers. After that I promise I’ll let you rejoin your people but I can assure you that they’re well being taken care of. My team’s tending to the injured, and they’re being handed out food and drinks.”
“And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out. I’m just kinda…” Tony stops talking as he puts a piece of candy in his mouth and starts chewing it, instead. He feels that he’s getting tired, and he shouldn’t be spending much more time on this. It’s going to hurt him, again, if he starts hoping.
Whatever it is that hit her, it’s still weightless. When she grabs for it to turn it around, she stops upon the sight of a green-colored cape. The last time she saw this one was…
Hilde only barely arrives at the escape pods, where she sees the two people she already sent there earlier still typing down furiously on their screens.
She still doesn’t want to stay here for too long, so once Dr. Cho is settled, Hilde returns to the controls while Yaël helps out with Loki’s unconscious form. With no clear destination in mind, Hilde simply starts moving forward. First away from the wreckage. Then further from Earth.
So hearing Sam’s voice, clearly intended for Steve, still brings a smile onto Tony’s face. He can see Steve look around in confusion, giving Tony a look once their eyes meets. Tony pulls back his helmet and offers him a smile, to indicate that he heard it as well.
Steve is thrown aside as if he weighs nothing. T’Challa is caught midair and is punched in the face until he doesn’t get up. Sam empties his guns onto him, yet no bullet gets through. Instead, Sam drops onto the ground with his wings curled into a position they shouldn’t be.
But suddenly Quill punches his weapon against Thanos’ face, accidentally hitting Mantis on her hands. The girl pulls away with a painful cry. He feels Tony pull away, meaning that Peter has to give it his all. He pulls, harder and harder while his Dad tries to stop the man who is currently ruining his
Once back into the hallway, she hides herself three more times from the people. When she hears loud noises coming from the hangar, she stops in her tracks.
Morgan is always happy to head back to her other parents. And that’s not meant in a bad way; she’s happy to return to the lakehouse after a week of her other parents, too. She’s just an optimistic kid that looks at the bright side of everything. Tony wishes he could be a little bit more than her.
It’s only false hope. Tony stays quiet. What the others are attempting, it’s no use at all. He has no idea how long they’re gone. He’s mostly unconscious, while multiple drips pump his body full of fluids. He gets in and out of it. At times, Pepper and Happy wander around the territory with him in the wheelchair, but more often than not, he’s in bed, staring ahead of him and feeling his body recover despite not wanting it to.
Peter nods. “I’m good,” he says, clearly still too excited about being in a spaceship. Tony gives him a long, studying look before he reaches out an arm and pulls Peter close to him, kissing him gently onto his forehead.
her melons,” Tony says, patting his shoulder. In return he gets a very unimpressed look from his friend. “My point was, though, that things change.”
Steve walks to the portal. He looks down at the suit; it’s been a part of him for so long. Maybe even too long. Seeing the blue, red, the white. The star… it doesn’t feel right anymore. Doesn’t feel like it should belong to him now.
Steve went ahead to check on Bruce. He took one of the cars and left early in the morning. Tony slept for a little bit longer, but eventually he had to get Morgan ready to bring her back to Pepper and Happy.
Hilde thinks she’s heard of these people. She only remembers them thanks to the rock-skinned man and the teenager completely on the left. She’s heard a bit about Johnny Storm in the past, though not much. Yaël has metioned him once or twice.
“Can I come in for a second?” she asks cautiously. Peter nods, sniffing his nose one more time. Pepper closes the door behind her, passes her hand over her vest to straighten it and then she approaches the bed. She seems a bit out of sorts with the room – probably never having seen the inside of it before.
“Hey,” she says to calm him down. As if it’s an automatic reaction, Vision’s right hand holds on to her wrist in search for contact. She frowns slightly; while these reactions aren’t new, this time it seems like he’s even more troubled than before.
, it says, the images showing destruction all over the city. Some sort of round circle-space ship in the sky. Wounded people running away, crying. A long figure, not looking human at all. Her hand goes up to her mouth, a gasp leaving her lips.
“As a matter of fact, I think you’re both on to something here.” Bruce starts thinking out loud, frowning as he tries to word his thoughts. “Vision, your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays; JARVIS, Ultron, Tony, Me, the Stone… all of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.”
She shouldn’t have been surprised to see the familiar faces eventually, but she’s glad they did. New Asgard, while thriving, is probably asking just a little bit too much of Thor’s time in combination of being a parent of three. It’s clear that Jane has it pretty much under control for some reason, but Thor is just too much of a concerned Dad for it to stay healthy.
She knows when she’s the last one standing. She feels him approach. She redirects a part of her power and guides it towards Thanos, with that not giving the maximum to the Stone. But she needs more time, and the others can’t help her anymore.
But Pepper, the woman he goes to for all his questions, the woman who guides him to the better path, disagrees with him, makes it obvious that it
The ship moves forward, still, nearing some structures that look like they’ve had better days in the past. He figures it’s a ship, perhaps. Or an old building. And as they approach, one of these building-things seems to get closer and closer. Much closer than Tony would like.
“Okay, so the ‘how’ works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where,” Steve starts as he’s standing next to the multiple screens hovering up. Tony is not too far from him, listening to the man speak with a soft smile on his lips. “Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.”
“So, Howard is going to have a son,” Peggy starts once Steve is finished. Out of all that he’s said, that seems to be the thing that caught her mind.
Rhodey’s gaze drops as Steve’s words come out. Natasha, next to him, averts her gaze as well. The news of Tony’s disappearance hit them all massively.
“There shouldn’t be monsters in the closet,” Pepper mutters back. “Listen, Tony, I love you very much, but trust me when I say that bringing this up to Steve is moving
Looking as if her face is starting to freeze over, Yaël closes her eyes before Hilde can pull her closer. They don’t have much time! Hilde takes another look at the other part of the ship; the one Thor’s still on. Just for a second, she gets to see it, until it’s replaced by a bright purple light, a force hitting her right in the face. It’s a heat, purple flames, loose pieces of the ship. The explosion pushes the whole ship back, making it almost impossible for Hilde to hold on to the girl.
Wanda bites her lip. She can’t really help it. Befriending Peter Parker has been one of the first steps she needed to begin letting go of her brother. And she knows that Pietro will always be a hole in her chest, the missing half of their whole, but somehow along the way she’s come to consider Peter as some person she needs to take care of. In a small amount.
“Admit it, you should have ducked out when I told you to.” Tony scans the devices around him once more, trying to see it from a different angle. “I tried to bench you, you refused.”
Tony can only look at him, though where Peter is taking his left hand, Tony manages to squeeze it a bit.
“That’s really great, you guys!” Clint is the last one to approach them. Rather than giving them individual hugs, he wraps each arm around both of them and pulls them together. The others quickly decide to join, making this their first – yes, literally – group hug ever. Tony feels himself getting a bit squished after Bruce joins in, though he’s still amused because of it.
That voice is not in his ear. It’s right next to him. Peter barely manages to notice Steve a bit further away, looking over at him in worry.
“Your brother. What we need to do right now is get the second quadrant of this ship ready, do you understand?”
Yaël is quiet after that. Hilde has no idea what’s happening, but she bets it’s another hug or something. The carrier of the Asgardian heir is quite the hugger, after all.
Hilde knows that they shouldn’t remain on Earth. Thanos will return here, and with there being two infinity stones at the same time… No, they can’t test it. She might be sneaking around, but she can’t help it. Luckily, Stark has received some of the escape pods from the Asgardian ship to repair. The guy seems to be good with his hands, but there are a couple of things Hilde still has to tweak to get it working.
“We’ve contacted the Four,” Natasha says right before the hovercraft stops. They’ve arrived at their location.
“No, no, no, no! I’m pretty sure I’m… not. It’s just that… I thought the two of you looked good together. For a moment you seemed… happy.”
It’s a tough battle inside himself to keep him from running in his direction. The child inside of him wants to hug the man, and tell him all about his life. But Tony can’t do that, because Mr. Jarvis doesn’t know Tony yet.
“It’s okay, stand down,” he says. Giving Wong a short look, he continues: “Can I leave you with him?”
“A ba- you mean Yaël’s kid?” she asks, referring to the very pregnant woman who is currently in New Asgard, drinking hot soup and keeping her feet up on a pillow, being constantly watched by Hilde who will glare at anybody who even looks at the girl.
thinks this guy’s the strongest, then that must really mean something. Tony walks up to the stairs, holding on to an ugly-looking pot to stretch his legs for a bit. The ache in his muscles is the only thing that might keep him sane while Bruce is panicking around him.
Figuring that she’s not going to see anything from outside, Hilde steps up and approaches the unconscious girl still resting on the ground. Looking over at Loki for a short moment, he nods at her. That’s when she moves her hands underneath Yaël’s body and picks her up from the floor. Gamora, too, stands up with a grunt.
Barely a couple of minutes have passed since Thanos left them. Is it possible he got the last stone in just that little time?
“I suppose you can thank your friend Wade for that.” Tony scratches the back of his head. Behind him, Peter can see Pepper sit down on the couch with Morgan on her lap, while Happy goes to join her. The three of them so happy that there are permanent smiles on their faces, while Pepper still has some joyful tears along with them.
“This is it,” Tony mutters lowly, inaudible to others. He takes a step back from Bruce, afraid that he might actually hit somebody that is standing too close to him. “What’s our timeline?” he asks, trying to keep his voice levelled.
The man who is currently standing in a floating circle-portal, with the Sanctum on the other side. He can vaguely see Wong standing there in the background. He gives Tony and Pepper a quick wave, and Pepper waves back. Tony just nods.
Hearing those words, Wanda, who had pulled her hand away from Vision, extends it back out. She’s trembling, collecting the energy of her Magic together to that point. When she sees a red light appear at her hand, she lets out a soft sob. Their eyes never leave one another.
“Think about it; Thanos can’t sense that stone inside of you. If it’s certain that he’ll come here to find the Mind stone,
Thanos gets the stone. Quill, who must have regained consciousness, tries another attack, but by the time he reaches him, Thanos is already gone.
“I don’t wanna go, I don’t wanna go, dad, please, I don’t wanna go!” Tony doesn’t know if he ever felt this way before; his entire chest is being ripped apart with every word Peter is saying.
Skinny makes another lame movement with his hand, which turns out not to be so lame when Tony suddenly sees something large flying behind him. Shit, one hit from that and he might actually hurt himself.
“They went back up in space,” Pepper tells him. “Nebula gave them a possible position of where Thanos could be. Thor was feeling very vengeful.”
Tony gestures for Peter to follow, and the two of them go stand at the edge of the platform, looking down at the figures underneath. It’s pretty much a miracle that they didn’t hear them, but Tony figures they’re pretty high up, and the ship itself makes enough noise to cancel it out.
It was probably only meant for Steve, but they’ve all linked their communicators. That’s how Tony knows Clint and Natasha have met up and are trying to get away with the glove. That’s how he knows Scott is trying to reach Rhodey, Bruce and Rocket, who are stuck underneath a large chunk of debris.
Passing on the details of the Scepter to Steve, he leaves the man to his own mission. Tony has to focus on the Tesseract, after all. He trusts that Steve can manage this just fine.
Peter is there. He might not be able to see him just yet, but Tony can and he’s looking exactly the way he saw him last time – minus the wounds on his face.
Peter’s safe, that’s enough for Tony. He needs to get Strange now, after all. He forces himself onto the ship, only taking one step inside when FRIDAY speaks up.
It takes him a while to find Vision in the part of the forest. Bruce is having an internal battle with the Hulk for a moment, but Steve passes him by. It looks like he’s only right on time to find Vision, who is dropped on the ground and looking upwards with a painful glance. The one hovering over him is giving another one of those monologues to make themselves feel better.
“Peter isn’t with me. But it’s alright. We’ll get him back in no time, alright May?” Looking over at Rhodey, he indicates for him to come up. Rhodey’s face has fallen, though he hurries to Tony’s side and nearly snatches the phone out of his hands.
Understanding what’s going on, Helen decides to put the child down on the other bed. It turns out her instinct was right, as she disappears only a few seconds later. The one who follows her is the stone-skinned man. After that, it seems to stop.
“So these guys, we’re to assume that they’re coming back, right?” Rhodey asks the moment he gets in.
“Pete, don’t encourage this, alright?” Tony urges on. Peter nods, lowering his gaze as he seems to understand his error. There’s a small ‘Okay’ coming out from him. “We’re getting no help from Flash Gordon here.”
“Crap,” she mutters out. This sucks. Though when she hears the footsteps nearing, she gets back into action, running towards the refrigerator and crawling inside. It’s cold, making her wrap her arms around her body as she shivers, crawling inside deeper.
The streets are empty; it’s pretty normal for this place. It’s why they chose to go here rather than a sunny beach or anything else. This is just down to Earth, enough to make them feel like they’re at least a
“No, he isn’t. I sent him home. He has a parachute. Just, when you see him, tell him to keep out of trouble.”
“It’s really unclear; the entire school was empty when we were trying to find somebody.” They had been there, but the school looked abandoned. Like it had been so for the past year or so. Yet Steve’s pretty sure that he’s had contact with X about two weeks ago, so they couldn’t have been gone that long. Surely, that means that something happened at that place and they went back into hiding. There’s no telling where they are right now.
“Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change,” Strange says stubbornly. “This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.”
“Yeah, I heard you,” Tony says. He bites his lower lip, holding his hands together while looking to the side, avoiding Strange’s stare purposely. Instead, he looks at Peter, hating himself for this with every second more. “I’m not sure we should.”
“To what do I owe this pleasure?” Tony asks, crossing his arms when he sees Strange there in that ridiculous outfit – seriously, out of all the superhero costumes he chose that? The dude looks like a hippie.
“I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something very similar to its own signature perhaps… it’s molecular integrity could fail.” He comes to stand in front of Wanda, clearly addressing her. In the back, Sam takes a seat, letting out a loud breath. Clint shakes his head as he joins him.
But they can’t risk it. So Tony’s just going to have to do his absolute best and make sure that nothing is going to happen to his son.
Peter helps him back up on his feet. It’s quiet around them, yet there’s something heavy in the air. Something Tony can’t explain. When he looks around, the others look a bit lost, except for Strange, who appears to know everything that’s about to happen.
Hilde turns to look at the doctor, who looks curious but at the same time a bit embarrassed about asking this.
“Steve, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but I think there’s a very strong chance Peter followed Tony on the ship.”
“So you helped him kill half the universe, instead?!” she gets in return. The woman approaches her in her fury, but suddenly she stops in her tracks, her eyes lowering down to the wound Gamora is holding on to. It’s an unconscious move she made, as if she’s trying to protect the new wound her adoptive father put on her.
“For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds…” He starts pressing some buttons on his device. The technology being too advanced for Steve to even want to know about it, he just looks ahead, casting another glance at his two best friends standing there, almost expecting him to never return.
to kill himself,” Tony finally concludes the story. “I woke up here where I found all of you outside the house.”
He steps away from Wanda, standing where Vision had last been. The tree branch looking scorched from the energy blast it received.
Tony puts Morgan down after that. The girl lets out a happy giggle and runs back to her mother. Tony then clears his throat and takes a few steps in Peter’s direction.
“Where’s James?” she asks him, while hugging the gun closer to her. Before he can answer, Rhodey comes up to them and tries to look around for answers a well.
“I saw Peggy?” Steve offers. Tony blinks at him in surprise. “Don’t worry, it wasn’t- I just saw her behind a window. She didn’t see me.”
“What do you mean, no?” Tony counters. He stops walking without really thinking about it, putting his hands on his hips while he tries to stare her down. Pepper doesn’t look too impressed by it.
“We could let out a distress signal,” Gamora says breathily as she leans back against the wall with her eyes closed. She pulls her hand away from her wound, finding that she’s already bleeding through the bandage. As soon as Helen Cho notices, she hurries to her side and gestures for her to lie down. Gamora shakes her head.
Tony repairs his shield thanks to T’Challa bringing out some vibranium. Steve watches him work and it seems like extremely infuriating work to get it all mended back together, but eventually he succeeds. Tony hands him back the shield, almost expecting him to jump back into action now that he has it.
“I remember when all of you suddenly started moving in in my tower,” Tony says as he’s leaning over the railing. Right next to him stands Steve, who has his shoulder pressed right against Tony’s. Despite the height-difference between them, Steve still has his head lowered towards Tony and his eyes closed.
It had been a little after that when Pepper came with the news that she wanted to have a child. Tony had once pointed out that Pepper never wanted to become a parent, but it seems like something has changed in that time. Probably the massacre of half the universe that does it.
Morgan chuckles in amusement while she takes her father’s hand into her small ones. “That’s a horrible story. I wanna hear a story about my brother.”
“Right.” There isn’t much more they’re going to get out of Thor on that matter, so they indicate for him to go and sit again. Thor nods, passing his hand through his long hair, though stopping when his finger gets stuck on a knot. He grumbles as he tries to untie it.
“You know, I’d offer to cook you dinner, but you seem pretty miserable already.” Steve is leaning against a bookshelf. The place that had once been so organized and well taken care off is now a dump. Books and files are all scattered around. Used plates are lingering on the tables.
Yaël doesn’t return; she gets back to America, back to her friends. And eventually, Hilde gets an invitation from Bruce – who appears to be back as well – who suggests she comes over to the States to celebrate something called ‘Christmas’.
Bucky has changed for the better. He’s got his sense of humor back, he smiles occasionally, and he loves to tease people – except for Tony; he’s always careful around him, just like Tony’s careful around Bucky.
At this point, Natasha, Clint, Sam, Okoye and T’Challa have all joined Steve and they’re all forming a barrier in front of the wounded Avenger. That doesn’t make Wanda lower her powerful charge that she keeps prepared.
Hilde meets Thor’s friend Erik Selvig not long after. The man is originally from Norway but relocated to America for his studies. He works for SHIELD as it turns out, but not all the time. The dark-haired woman that came with him also adds that he might have been crazy for a good part of a year. Hilde choses to ignore that part.
The lakehouse is where they live now. It’s large and has lots of open space. There’s a lake around it, obviously, and a forest as a backyard. Steve likes it here; it’s nice to draw nature around him, and sometimes he even catches some of the wildlife that he puts onto paper. He especially loves the garden, where he's grown a couple of good crops that keeps their plates and refrigerators filled.
So they make up the plan. They put in the details, go over everything multiple times to make sure that everybody is on board. Three teams of two, and one of three. They’ve all have their specific goal they have to go through.
“No wait, Bruce! Are you okay?” Steve stops him, trying to get any information. None comes out of Bruce, who is still struggling with the strong power on his arm.
“I’ll go and look around,” Hilde says lowly towards the woman who is busy looking out of the window in search for anything.
“Earth is big, he won’t just find me like that?” Yaël counters, but Hilde feels a burst of anger inside of her and she slams her wrench against the dashboard of the ship, causing for it to power on for some reason. The ship starts whirring, coming to life despite being stuck on the ground.
The world is so different from then. There weren’t any worries for Thanos – except maybe from Tony’s side after that particular vision Wanda gave him. They were all just friends; none of them knew too much about one another. It was just their team, getting to know each other without too many complications.
“Oh yeah? You don’t wanna tell me where she is? That’s fine, I’ll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. Starting with you.” The man called Quill is starting to get frantic, speaking too fast. And he’s still holding a weapon to Tony’s son’s head. That really needs to change.
Loki has regained his Asgardian skin color. He’s once again pale, yet he’s maybe looking even paler than before. His eyes are tired, sad and surrounded by red circles. His hair is sticky and plastered onto his face, yet he doesn’t let that stop him from taking care of his son.
Tony turns, looking around once more. “Yeah, we got one advantage; he’s coming to us.” Then he thinks it over for a moment. “We’ll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one.”
All she hears is a painful shout, followed by the cries of an infant. Somebody begging for something to stop. Gamora almost wonders if it’s she who’s crying, but she has no idea at this point. Somebody’s still fumbling with her wound, where the knife must have been pulled out. There’s pressure on it, but that won’t stop her from dying.
They’re all put in some sort of hovercraft vehicle. It’s mostly Wakandan soldiers, but Steve’s ship also holds Bucky and Nat. Sam and Rhodey are flying above, while Bruce is making use of Tony’s Hulkbuster armor they thought to bring along.
“Besides,” Quill continues, turning back to Strange who had asked the question in the first place. “He didn’t go to Nidavide or whatever that is. He said something about Nivadellir, said he needed a new hammer or some kind of weapon that defeats Thanos.”
He doesn’t know how long he’s busy with it. He tells FRIDAY what to work on, and she does it without question. With the notes Scott left behind on the porch, he tries to dig through anything that might be useful. But, eventually, the night falls and it’s about time to hit the hay for one little girl.
Vision lets his hand crawl up until it’s covering Wanda’s on his cheek. Then he takes it between his fingers, kissing the palm of her hand in a gentle manner before lifting it up onto his forehead, covering the glowing yellow stone.
Tony turns to Carol – he’s been introduced to her earlier. She’s the one who saved him from space. No longer in her suit, she looks normal, almost. Were it not for that hard look in her eyes as she tries to stay out of the whole ordeal.
“We lost Peter?” Now, Steve’s voice shivers as well. His eyes do turn red from upcoming tears, but he seem to be trying to hold it in. Instead, Steve pulls at Tony’s shoulder and wraps his arms around him completely. Finally hugging him, Tony closes his eyes and leans into the touch.
“We do.” Steve leans forward to kiss Tony on his forehead. “Now, let’s head back to the others and get our son back.”
Thanos’ arrival on Titan does not help his anxiety at all. The whole planet exists out of nothing but wreckage after wreckage. The gravity is insane, and while they can still breathe here, Peter can’t help but feel a bit lightheaded about the strange form of oxygen going around here.
Tony, who is still held up by Peter, turns to Strange. The sorcerer hasn’t moved from where he’d been sitting. “Tony, there was no other way,” he tells him. It’s the first time he addresses him by the first name.
“You just didn’t want Fury to know about it, did you?” Rhodey points out. Tony presses his lips together.
“My boy,” he whispers, moving up to kiss Peter’s head. Then he snuggles his face into his hair, as if he tries to take in his smell. “I’ve missed you so much.”
“What the stone was warning me about,” Vision returns, voice low and tense. Wanda bites her lower lip when she suddenly sees Stark’s picture appear on the screen. He’s
“Not at the moment, no,” Strange returns, looking up at the strand of hair that seems to be moving as if wind is blowing inside. When they look up through the round window, they can see some sort of metal scraps flying by.
When she’s gotten to her destination, she finds nothing more than what seems to be an escape pod, stuck in place. She catches her breath, already knowing who will be inside there. She knows who holds the Infinity Stone. The girl was once the same as her; a weapon Thanos used to destroy others. But she got out of his hold as quickly as she got in, and she managed to stay away for so long.
When Tony arrives at the Compound for the first time in years, he finds Steve already standing outside with his hands in the pockets of his hoodie and a tired expression in his eyes. He already looks done, which is kind of hilarious. Tony stops the car in front of him and rolls down his window as he looks over at his partner.
“Eat, daddy,” she says before she puts her fingers back in her mouth. Steve smiles at her, and then he eats the potato she handed him.
Natasha shakes her head. “The Fantastic Four are somewhere in space according to their lobbyist. The space center has made contact with them and they’re wrapping up their mission prematurely to rejoin us. As for the X-Men…”
Steve falls silent. The book drops on the ground, though he remains unmoving, frozen in place. “What? Wow, that’s… amazing and…” Steve lowers his gaze after that. “Terrifying, now that I think of it.”
Wanda sees it all happen; everybody starts approaching him. She never looks away from it, even prepares herself for the imminent attack.
“Garage.” Morgan puts her hands on her shoulders and swings her body from one side to another playfully. With the garage, she more means Tony’s workshop. It’s not as big as the one he had in the tower – he’s also rarely in there, anymore. This particular suit he’s working on has been taking up little of his time, since he’s been spreading out the project over the past few years.
After Peter, it’s Shuri, T’Challa, Xavier, a couple of the mutant students. Even Nick Fury and Maria Hill seem to have lost this battle against Thanos, where-ever they were.
to bring Peter back. So she kisses his cheek while holding their daughter in her arms, and then tells him to get to work with a sad smile.
“You will not believe what’s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? And I must have passed out because I woke up and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was all like ‘It’s been five years, come on, they need us’ and then he started doing the yellow sparky thing he does all the time-“
“On it!” Peter shouts back, swinging out of the park. Tony regrets his words immediately; he hates seeing Peter in battle, but it’s worse when he’s out there, far from Tony. He just has to trust that his son can hold his own for now.
Tony nods without really realizing it. Quill pauses for dramatic effect before pointing at them smugly.
It’s not that much use, as Tony has to step out earlier than they do. Tony wishes him good luck, saying his goodbyes as if he was talking to another colleague. After that, he leaves the two of them in the elevator. Tony hopes Steve isn’t going to expose himself.
“Yeah, pretty neat, no?” Right when Bruce is about to respond, Tony’s flying up in the air, a grunt leaving his mouth.
Peter can see Morgan cuddle closer to Pepper, who is seated next to May on the couch. Peter feels horrible for her; he’s used to death, but for Morgan this is a whole new thing. His little half-sister is just the same age Peter had been when he’d lost his parents. He knows more than anybody here how she must be feeling; confused, hurt. Lonely.
Gamora found the whereabouts of the Soul Stone a while ago. Or, well, it’s not as much an exact location, as it is a way to track it down. She doesn’t want to know what kind of ancient technology it took for her to figure it out; it’s probably with an ancient relic that existed even before the Infinity Stones ever did.
“We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don’t wanna dance with this guy; we just want the gauntlet.”
“That reveals a lot. Anyway, he kept on saying that she couldn’t take me, that it would make someone he cared about really sad. You think those two are exclusive? Because she didn’t really seem to mind that he might have liked someone else.”
But even as she goes through his head, even as she tries to get into the stone and find out why it’s suddenly acting the way it does, she can’t get anything from it, other than the warmth and coziness coming from Vision himself.
Tony instructs Morgan to head inside and wash her hands. He follows her in, only to come back out with a jug full of water and a couple of glasses. He hands out one to his guests, giving Steve the last one while looking him in the eyes with a questioning look.
“Infinity Stone?” Thor asks, confused. Hilde just has absolutely no idea what this is about, but she doesn’t ask. Instead, she starts running back towards the door after the ship gets another hit.
“It’s your birthday gift. From two years ago. Surprise!” Tony can hear her laugh in his ear. Never, ever in his life did he expect to be on a battlefield with this person. Pepper’s always been the ‘normal’ part in his life; the one that never wanted anything to do with this, despite having the ability to do so with her heritage. While she tolerated Iron Man, she more wished for Tony to just put down the suit for ever.
Thanos?! No, I’m here to kill Thanos, he took my girl- Wait, who are you?” Finally, FINALLY Quill lowers the blaster and turns to Strange, though still holding on to Peter who now takes off his helmet as well.
Rhodey keeps on trying to stop him, while at the same time pressing a tissue against the puncture wound where Tony just ripped out the IV.
“Something’s happening,” Mantis says while she’s still held up by Quill. She holds a hand against her middle, leaning up against the leader of her group. Her large eyes look up in the sky, only for her body to slowly disappear into dust.
“It worked!” Tony wraps his arms around Steve and lets out a relieved sob. “We’re going to get my kid back.”
It’s spring, the sun is high in the sky and the temperature is agreeable. The trees aren’t shaking, meaning that there’s barely any wind around them. As the Quinjet approaches the facility, Steve can’t help but just
“Okay, there’s only one person I ever want to hear that from, and it’s not you.” He might have said that a little bit too loud, so Tony quickly grabs his cellphone and pretends to be on a call as his back is once again facing the rest of the Avengers.
Tony shuts him up by pulling him forward by his collar and kissing his lips, softly. Steve makes a surprised sound at that, but he quickly leans back into it, despite both of them being aware that their clock is ticking.
“Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?” Suddenly, there’s a slap on his arm and Tony loses his balance. He turns around immediately, finding the three men looking at him with those serious, troubled eyes. Tony doesn’t like this one bit.
She hears rather than sees the other stones powering up. With large eyes, she looks up to see what he’s up to, only to notice the glow of green on his thumb side of the gauntlet. For a moment, she wonders why that reminds her of Strange’s stone, until-
When he wakes up, Pepper is next to him. She looks tired, but not close to head back to sleep. By the time she realizes her friend to be awake, she puts down her book and sighs sadly at him.
Wanda has made a promise, though. One she intends to keep, which means that, under no circumstances, she would read Vision’s mind unless she gets his specific approval. So far, she’s never had to, either, but even she has to admit that the urge has been there more often than not in these days that Vision seems to be uneasy.
Steve then snorts and pats his shield, currently hanging on its usual spot on his back. “I’ve got all the weapons I need, right here,” he jokes, but it falls flat. He’s aware that with an invasion this probable scale, the shield might just not be enough.
“Vanessa,” Peter points out. “His girlfriend who died; Wade’s constantly trying to die so he can be with her, but he keeps coming back.”
“Did he give you any clues? Any coordinates? Anything?” This time it’s Natasha who speaks. Tony glances at her, even squints his eyes. Natasha tries not to let it get to her, but clearly it still does.
“Good,” Hilde says in relief. They’re not going to treat them as prisoners. That’s good. “You don’t seem too surprised of our existence. I thought the people of Earth weren’t aware of extraterrestrial life?”
“Yeah, but my son has seen more movies,” Tony says with a shrug. He calls up a rocket from his shoulder patches and shoots one against the wall, blowing it up. Skinny loses his ground immediately, being sucked into space with the brute force coming from it. As suspected, once Skinny is out, whatever’s holding Strange no longer has him in their grasp. Strange lets out a shout as he, too, is being sucked towards the hole in the wall.
Steve guides Tony back inside, though he’s quickly pushed into a wheelchair Bruce must have brought along.
At last, that hole in him feels a bit more complete again. And that’s the best thing he could ever wish for.
When the first portal appears before him, Peter knows Strange is giving him an opportunity. Peter goes through, smacking Thanos in the face with every jump.
Outside the window, in the deep dark of space, there’s the large ship from before. It’s a bit closer than before, and it’s obvious that they’ve opened fire.
Tony gently looks down, seeing a small smile on Peter’s face. He wonders what the hell the kid is planning.
He removes the suit, looks down at the Captain America uniform he still has on. He can’t go walking around like this.
For the first time, it seems like Thanos is struggling. While he’s using his other stones to approach her, it’s clearly with a lot of effort. Wanda doesn’t dare to look, because this is all riding on her.
of having kids to call his own. A little brother for Peter, or maybe a little sister. Or two of them. Or maybe even three.
“You always were a cuddler in your sleep,” Pepper jokes. Tony throws her a glare, but she ignores it.
“Thanks, but this one’s on me,” Steve assures him. He puts a hand on his shoulder and squeezes it. “Got some loose ends to tie up.”
“We hope everybody’s alright?” the man who introduced himself as Reed Richards asks. The woman, Susan, helps Gamora step inside of their own space craft.
And now he needs a moment. Now Tony needs the couple of seconds he takes to let that information sink in. Because this is their team; this is the group that is supposed to take down a purple giant that so far nobody’s had the success in taking down. This group here might be their only hope at winning this thing.
“Right,” Steve sighs. He needs to keep moving. There are much larger things at stake right now. Quickly he raises his head, letting out another long breath as he prepares himself mentally to face this next challenge.
“Call him,” Bruce urges on. Tony sighs, lifting up a hand towards his brow. If he calls Steve, it means that this all, this big danger that is hanging over them, it’s real… “Listen to me, Tony. Thor’s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn’t matter if you interrupt Bucky-time.”
Noticing something in what she’s presenting him, Tony reaches out for the image and twists it around for a bit. “Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.”
“Maybe not, but unless anybody here carries another Crown of Surtur and the Eternal Flame, there’s about no way for us to fight through this one once again. Except, maybe…”
. She can barely get anything done before she’s knocked aside, losing the energy and smashing through a window with a painful grunt.
Silence falls over them. A TV on the wall is playing the current news, but Tony can’t focus on it. He looks around the room for a bit, but then grabs for his cellphone. Except, there is no cellphone.
“Well, then we have to protect them,” Natasha points out. Steve sighs in irritation; of all the times for the X-Men to disappear it has to be now.
“What’s going on, love?” the God of Mischief asks in a frenzy. Dr. Cho is already on her feet and grabbing some sort of monitor.
Around the second week ending, Tony doesn’t even feel anything at all. He has none of his medications on him, and about all the drinks around here are alcoholic, which isn’t helping him, at all.
“Me, too, obviously.” Tony reaches forward to kiss her forehead. “But now it’s time to sleep, alright? Love you, tons.”
“I won’t take offence. If you want to try, then try. I’m not going to stop you.” Tony shrugs if off as Steve sits down in front of him. Morgan holds out her hand, and when Steve wants to take whatever she’s handing him, he realizes it’s a piece of potato.
New York looks pretty much like he remembers it; people on the streets, children playing games. The cars look a lot different than Steve has grown used to. It’s familiar in a good sense.
That’s not a thing Tony ever expected he would hear, but he does as he’s told. Aiming towards his past-self, Scott climbs up past-Tony’s arm. Seeing that he’s done here, Tony suits up again and exits the tower, so he can make it down on time.
They don’t speak. Hilde gestures at her to stay quiet and Yaël listens. Then she gestures towards Thor, Loki and the Hulk, indicating that they need to get them out of here. That’s when Hilde notices something in Yaël’s eyes.
The person she avoids looking at is Yaël, who looks just horrible in all possible ways. She’s gotten some burn marks from the explosion; parts of her hair has been scorched off because of it. On her forehead there’s a large cut from when they were smashed against the ship. She’s bruised all over, as well.
Despite the fact that this whole thing didn’t go down the way it should, Peter still feels relieved now that the giant is no longer here. It’s over. There’s no more imminent danger at this moment.
The impact on the ground is still strong enough to throw them off their feet. Tony lands onto his side as dust fills on the inside. He loses sight of Peter, but after hearing a shrieked ‘holy shit’ from his direction he’s at least sure the kid’s fine.
Yaël nods, looking ahead with a worried expression in her eyes. Hilde isn’t too sure what to say further about it. To be fair, she’s barely aware of what this supposed ‘stone’ is that this girl has absorbed, but she knows it’s strong and supposedly gave her the powers she’s currently possessing.
“Hurry up!” Hilde shouts, pulling on Yaël’s hand even harder. They run as fast as they can, going from one hallway to the other. They notice a few of those ‘guards’ from before, looking just as panicked as she feels. With the Dragonfang, she slams a few on the head.
Helen appears to have fallen asleep on the ground. The position she’s in does not look comfortable at all, but Hilde isn’t going to move her. That might just wake her up.
Before he can put another hand on Vision, Steve tackles him to the ground with all the force he has. While he gets back on his feet, he looks over to Vision who doesn’t seem to be moving at all despite his blinking.
Tony’s breath hitches. “Who told you that?” he asks. “I didn’t fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the stone. That’s what happened. There was no fight.”
is going on between them, but he also knows that Natasha is a very private person, so he doesn’t ask. He already feels like he’s intruding when he catches them looking at each other. When they speak, it’s so softly. Steve tries not to focus on it and instead looks over the two figures standing at the tree line.
“Show us,” Steve instructs the AI, and immediately a screen pops up in front of them. On it, there seems to be footage of a familiar figure he hasn’t seen in years. One he didn’t expect to ever see, before.
Tony looks down, a hint of sadness going through his eye before it disappears again, replaced by relief. “Small price to pay for getting you back,” he admits. “Though I would not suggest anybody else playing with that gauntlet.”
“He did? Oh, God,” he interrupts his son as he pulls him into the strongest hug he must probably have ever given. It probably lasts too long than should be allowed, but Tony doesn’t care even a little bit. He’s waited five years for this, and he’s not going to wait any longer.
It’s rare to see Natasha crying, but it’s clear that she’s been pushed to her limit. Steve walks in on her trying her best to hold back her tears after ending another meeting with the guard – that’s what Tony’s started to call them. It must have been more dead ends, probably.
“It’ll be a nice change of pace for her, I’m sure. Mr. Stark  is always running late and she’s taken to just hunting him down instead of waiting for him to show up for meetings.” the man shrugged.
“Well, we’ve been together for this long, and we’ve spent a heat together. This relationship is pretty serious in my opinion. The next steps would be to move in together and possibly think about getting married.”
When he was cleaned up, dressed, and had told Tony where he and Clint were to meet him, Steve exited the room, rolling up the sleeves of his button up with a sigh. He brushed back his hair with his hand as he approached the front desk to pay. Being told the bill, he looked impressed for a brief second before he wrote the check, writing it out in Hydra's name, which would pay any expenses Steve presented, including sessions with omegas he happened to fancy.
Taking it off the rack, Tony held it up to his body and looked down at it, tilting his head in thought.
Eventually the voices calling out for him faded away, and Tony was able to crawl out of the closet. He suddenly had a longing for Steve’s scent, despite wanting nothing to do with it when he first arrived back at the base. He almost craved the alpha’s scent, wanted to be surrounded by it and be comforted by it. He wanted the pain to go away, and somehow he thought that Steve’s scent would make him physically feel better.
“You sure?” Howard asked, setting aside his own bowl. “You’re not quitting just because you got sad, right?”
“I’ll admit I’ve had a little trouble coming to terms with that, but since Tony and I have been together for over a year now, I suppose it’s time I started referring to myself as family.”
Tony was silent as he looked at his father, eyes red and puffy from crying, though it didn’t look like he was upset at Howard. If anything, he looked heartbroken of course, but forgiving, compassionate. Tony had it in his broken heart to forgive his father. Eventually. It would take time to heal the father and son’s bond, but Tony was willing to forgive, and that was all that Howard could ask for after all he had put his son through.
Several Hydra agents passed the three by as they all had their duties to fulfill. It was clear Steve ranked high among all the other agents, as they all nodded and addressed him respectfully. There was only one other agent who ranked as highly as Steve did, and that specific agent waited by another elevator, one that would take the three up to apartment style rooms to stay in.
? Was Steve just… playing him? Acting all nice and polite because he was Tony Stark and making him upset was going to get Steve in trouble with Howard? Was everything that had happened since they met just an act Steve put on?
Tony sighed. “I was excited to see you. I had new designs for your suit to show you, we were going to get you a new shield, then we had a date planned,  plus whatever else would follow afterwards. I let my mind wander when Dad and I got to the base. Then I saw you with her… and all that happiness left me in a mere second… It hurt…”
The doctors had told Tony that he had already lost too much weight from vomiting so often, but it wasn’t like he could control that. He knew he needed to bulk up for the baby, and he was having trouble doing so when there were only so many healthy foods that he could tolerate eating. Still, Tony wasn’t going to let himself lose the baby if he had any say in it.
“I saved you, because despite what we’ve gone through in the past, I still love you. I know you lost the man you love the most, and I know you feel terrible right now because of that… but I didn’t want you to die with a freshly broken heart. That’s no way to die after fighting for your life.”
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Tony asked as he glanced over the many drunken alphas, holding back a shiver at some of the looks he was receiving.
“Peggy!” Tony smiled, hearing his friend after many months. “It’s so good to hear your voice again. How are you?”
“Steve needs you here, Tony,” Peggy said after staying respectfully silent. “The military base you met Steve at when he landed in California will be where you need to go. Your plane leaves as soon as you get there. Tony… we really need you to come as soon as you can.”
Tony smiled. “We almost can’t keep our hands off each other. God, it’s really hard not to just reach out and touch him every time I see him. I swear he gets more attractive by the day. I… I wish I could see him again. I have a picture of us hugging in a frame. I cracked the glass in the frame actually… I should probably get a new frame.”
“That’s all I can ask for, my son. Eat as much as you can for now, and I’ll be back later in the day with more, okay?”
Tony scoffed at himself. He had bigger things to worry about than if he would end up bonded to Steve or not. Like the stupid Captain America outfit. And how he was going to explain to his father that he ended up going to Europe with the alpha he had helped create. And what it was going to be like in a camp full of alphas, then what would happen if Tony went into heat while over there and he didn't have an alpha to protect him from the others. What it might feel like to be surrounded by a pack of alphas all growling and snapping, wanting to get a taste of him.
“We only have room for the captain,” the soldier once again spoke up, and Tony hated how he tried to use a commanding tone with him.
“Thank you, Mr. Stark.” Steve sat down next to Tony, briefly glancing at him before focusing on Howard putting everything on the table. “I hope it wasn’t too much trouble that I dropped by unexpectedly.”
The omega whined in protest, feeling the tip of Steve's cock slip out of him. "Don't want to use protection," he grumbled.
“Tony, go look. Be yourself. You know there will be people in there who can help you if you need it.”
“Ah, welcome to my favorite place to spend time, Mr. Rogers. Custom designed for maximum productivity.”
“I did tell you you could play with weapons. Practice archery without having to hide.” Tony grinned, “Come on, it’ll be great. Even if we don’t join the group, we’ll still have a better life than at any other omega work space.”
“Your baby could be at risk,” Peggy went on. “You almost got blown up, your baby can die so easily at this point! Oh my god…”
“You’re right about that. I always prefer working in my lab or going on our cute little burger dates.”
“I don’t know what to do… I don’t know how to take care of a baby! Holy shit, Dad is going to kill me…”
Maria nodded in agreement. “He’ll know when it’s the right time to know. So tell me more about you and the captain’s relationship.”
“Sorry, you were starting to move quite a bit, and the doctor said to keep you lying still so your rib could heal.” She leaned forward and put a gentle hand on Tony’s upper arm. “You parents are here, they would like to see you. Think you have the energy for that?”
"Let's go up to the rooms, and we'll find a picture," Steve said, punching the button to call the elevator.
“Because you’re an omega, Tony! For christ’s sake, you have less of a chance of survival than all the alphas!” Howard shook his head. “I worry about you, Tony, whether you see it or not. I don’t want you to get killed out there! I don’t want to have to tell your mother that I let you get yourself killed out on the battlefield!”
“Howard has some equipment for you to try,” the agent said as she pulled Tony closer, eyeing a lingering alpha with hungry eyes. “Tomorrow morning?”
Sighing, Tony put his ring on and tapped the top of it twice, and a few seconds later, it vibrated slightly, letting the omega know that Steve had also tapped on his ring. It was a simple way to keep in communication with each other, even if they were miles apart already.
“Great! Oh, let me show you some of our other projects. Gotta make sure you have more than just a hand to pull inspiration from.”
Steve nodded with a sheepish smile. “So… that seems like something you’d be happy about… but you’re still sad.”
“I think you’ll find it’s more of a feat to get me to shut up if I’m doing anything other than working in my lab.” Tony grinned with a wink as he took the portfolio and flipped it open to start looking through the samples of art Steve had put together.
“Yeah, of course I am. I almost always have the urge to nest, even when a heat isn’t near.” Tony shrugged and looked at the bed and all the old nesting materials that probably needed a wash.     Though they had been washed after the last heat, they were already dirty from the two sleeping on them. It wasn’t like they were indestructible.
“Ah, sadly it is usually the omegas of the world who see more of the jerks. I pity the jerks who can not know what it means to earn an omega’s affections. They’re truly missing out on such beauty.” Thor said
“I’m a spoiled brat. I never learned how to be shy. Dad never let me be shy, even as a tiny little thing just learning to walk.”
Speaking of Maria, Tony missed her dearly, though he really couldn’t go home to her. Howard was stationed in London for at least six more months before he would be given leave to return home for a short time. Steve would still be in Europe by the time Howard got his leave, which Tony didn’t like. Maybe he could make an excuse to stay with the alpha, but he doubted it would work. Howard really wanted to get his son home anyways, and the next leave he had, he was sure to take Tony by the ear and drag him back home to his mother. Not the most ideal situation, but at least Tony would get to see Maria again. It had been too long since he last saw her…
“God, you have no idea how badly I missed you,” Tony muttered while resting his head on Steve’s chest, listening to that strong heartbeat that calmed him.
“I don’t know how I missed you buying it. It looks very good on you,” Steve complimented, leaning down to kiss Tony’s cheek.
“Yeah. A night in sounds better than my original plans.” Tony grabbed a box of Cheerios, a new cereal that had come out towards the beginning of the war. He poured himself a small bowl and started snacking.
I would also like to give a big thanks to my beta reader, writing partner, and one of the best friends I've ever had. Thanks to TiBun for writing the Howard and Maria scene with me.
"Hey now, don't sell yourself short. Your personality didn't change just because you were turned into an alpha supersoldier. Who knows, I might have been interested in you when you were a beta."
“Come on, Tony,” Howard kept saying, willing his son to open his eyes and be at ease. “Fight, Tony. Fight like you did on the battlefield…”
“It is as you said, sir.” a refined voice with a British accent responded from the speakers overhead.
Tony cleared his throat, feeling another round of tears slowly creeping up on him. “Well, Steve still hasn’t been found yet… and at this point I don’t think he’ll be found unless some miracle in technology happens.”
Tony smiled wider and threw himself at the alpha, hugging him tight. “You have no idea how happy that makes me, Steve… Thank you.”
Maria nodded. “I knew I smelled something different on you, but I’m glad to know that it’s Steve that I was smelling. Did you two bond?”
"Your father beat you for showing how smart you are?" Steve growled a little. "How could he do that to his own damned child? Disgusting.
Purring, the omega kissed back happily, pleased with the praise from the alpha he was growing more and more convinced would be
“When you, Bucky, and I go out there to head to the base, I want you just in front of us,” Steve said around a mouthful of food. “That way you can keep sharp eyes at the front while Bucky and I cover your flanks and rear.”
“Oh I… I don’t know,” Tony said, shrugging. “Dancing is nice and all, but I don’t really dance all that much.”
Steve nodded, then looked back down at Tony. “Tony, I know you don’t like this,” he said after noticing that the omega was shaking. The poor guy was going to have to be without Steve at least for a little bit of his heat.
Howard’s and the doctor’s words echoed in his mind as another wave of extreme pain rolled through his abdomen agonizingly slow. Words that he was supposed to listen to but didn’t. He should have listened, heeded the warnings he was given, but the time to listen had long since passed. Now Tony was experiencing something he hoped he could have avoided.
Tony grinned and kissed Steve’s cheek with enough care not to leave an obvious lip gloss print behind. “I’d make out with you like a teenager right now but we both need our hair to look nice when we arrive.”
“What was is that Abraham had said before he died? The world could use more little guys in the fight?”
“Won’t be the same without him,” Tony said when they finally pulled away from each other, tears threatening to form in the corners of his eyes.
Steve grits his teeth together, feeling the strong urge to start crying on the spot but instead doing everything he can to hold it in. He’s aware he could be crushing Natasha’s finger under his grip. He can’t really stop it. It’s the only thing keeping him from slamming his fist against the walls of the Quinjet.
“She’s got help,” the Wakandan warrior adds to that. Hilde finally returns on her flying horse, winking at him while Pepper returns. Mantis, Natasha, Shuri and another woman dressed in a suit similar to Ant-Man’s seem to have joined the scene, as well as that blue lady from back in space and another green-skinned lady Peter has a big suspicion might be Gamora. Right now, it’s a big barrier of extremely powerful women standing between him and the army, and it’s clear they’re not about to let them win.
“You heard him,” Tony says behind them. Steve smiles fondly. After that last bit, Sam seems to get back into reality as he finally takes the shield and puts his arms through the loops. Even from where he’s seated he can see that it fits him just perfectly.
“You knew that man?” she wonders. On the journey back, nothing much has been said about it but during the invasion she already caught that they were acquainted. And clearly not in the good way.
Peter’s already running back towards the army by the time he sees Tony return to the scene as well. Dropping down somewhere close to where Carol went down, Peter hopes that he finds the gauntlet and takes off with it, again.
“I thought you’d be harder to catch,” he says, suddenly taunting the giant. This is not the time! “For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?”
Steve chuckles. Much like Tony did, Steve leans forward to kiss the top of his head, and then holds him closer to him while he watches the women give it their all.
“And for some reason they can clearly find us,” Natasha adds. Putting down some numbers into the computer, a hologram of the two individuals that cornered them last night comes up, all here due to the imagery from Sam’s Redwing.
“You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy.” Tony goes to pick up his daughter with one arm, and the other one holds the helmet. He walks back to the house. “It’s fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.”
Morgan runs out of the house with her hands now completely dry. She reaches Steve, who immediately goes to pick her up and hold her close. Morgan puts her head onto his shoulder and looks over the two strangers she’s never seen before. Realizing they’re looking back at her, she hides her face away. Tony immediately notices the hurt on Natasha’s face.
“Did we get them all?” asks Bruce while he’s holding the familiar amulet Strange once wore in his hands. The ones carrying stones all raise them up in the air, bringing the count to six. Natasha and Clint give each other a high-five upon realizing that they’ve made it.
Steve is aware of the things she’s been through; of the role Bucky played in her life. His best friend told him during one of his visits, and Steve had been shocked to hear about it. Especially when it came to the matter of Bucky’s daughter.
“Thanks, Pepp,” Peter tells her. She pats his head once, and then drops him onto a flying horse, where he immediately notices Hilde sitting in front of him, giving him a big smile. “Hilde, it’s been a while- OH MY GOD!”
The image of Tony in front of them rubs his forehead, biting his lips as he thinks of what to say next.
“I’m sorry, what did I miss?” asks the man as he jumps back on his feet. He grabs another can of coke, only to have it pulled out of his hands by Natasha when he passes her by.
“If you consider failure experience,” Thanos calls out, unimpressed by Loki’s words. The God of mischief lets out a small, breathy laugh.
It had been so comfortable and warm back then. Now, Tony finds himself shivering in the cold, unforgiving atmosphere of the spaceship.
Vision smiles when he feels the first cracks in the stone. Wanda can’t stop now, no matter how much she wishes she could.
Once the beam stops, Steve can see three vague figures standing there. It takes him a short moment to see who it is. It’s the sight of the cape that makes him realize it with glee. He grins upon seeing his friend for the first time in years. It’s been very long since they’ve last seen each other.
Thunder shoots Thanos a few meters backwards, and it’s quickly followed by a large axe thrown by Thor. Thanos tries to stop it, even, but the weapon is strong. Very strong. And so is Thor.
It’s horrible in every way to watch somebody being choked to death. Even as a God, Loki struggles to free himself from Thanos’ hand. He swings his legs, shakes his entire body. His face turns blue, though. The two brothers trying to escape, but neither of them succeeding.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks in worry. Peter can see Wanda and Shuri walking their way to join in the conversation. Meanwhile, as Pepper, Steve and Morgan walk back inside the house, Happy, May and Rhodey catch up with some of the others as well. Everybody’s really sullen. Peter sighs.
He’s immediately joined by Drax, Mantis and Quill. Then, after another, long second, another figure comes swinging by. Tony lets out a soft cry, surely heard by the titan not too far from him. But he doesn’t care.
Behind her, the others keep buying her time, but it’s not helping much. Rhodey’s suit gets destroyed until he can’t fly anymore. Bucky shoots bullet after bullet of his weapon, only to have a blast of power directed to him, instead.
Steve can’t stop looking at him, as if he’s afraid that he’s just going to disappear if he would turn away. It’s like it hasn’t sunken it quite yet; Tony’s back. He’s alive. Steve saw his dead body in the remnants of a place he once called home, and now he’s standing here much like it hadn’t happened. But it did.
to have me. Though, I’m not too sure about that now. Besides, looking back, he did occasionally drop the odd pearl.”
“Tony, you’re sick,” Rhodey warns him. Another reminder that his mind isn’t quite right. But that gives him all the more reason to finally vent his heart to the people that were supposed to be his team.
Hilde hears many rumors, happy and sceptic alike, as she goes through the streets. People avoid for a little bit, knowing her to be head of the Royal heir’s personal guards. She’s no longer on her own with it, but she still sees it at her sole responsibility.
He doesn’t have the time to respond. Before he can open his mouth something rolls on the ground between him and Strange. A small, metal ball. But Tony doesn’t need to be a genius to know that this isn’t good. He pulls up the helmet once more, wishing that Peter has the same idea.
“I don’t- I can’t.” He stops talking when he notices something, and he points towards his younger brother-in-law. “Johnny?”
“I’m okay,” comes in return. Peter’s about to dig him out of there, only to notice that the Guardians seem to be unconscious. They’re all floating away, almost hitting the other moon chunks and massive rocks.
“We’re all here for you, pal,” Johnny assures him. He pulls him into his arms to give him a strong hug. Eventually the others join, making it a sudden group hug that almost suffocates Peter.
“Like in Footloose, the movie?” the kid asks. Tony turns to him, giving him a pointed look that he ignores as his focus is solely on Mr. Starlord over there. The man from Missouri, who seems to get overly excited upon hearing that movie.
It’s Peter who reacts first, though – probably sensing that things will go wrong if they continue like that. “We might wanna turn. Turn!
Bucky’s missing arm has been replaced with a black, vibranium one. It looks stronger, sturdier. Lacking that red star that only means bad news. His hair has grown much over the months, and he seems to have put half of it in a small ponytail. Or maybe Nat did, Steve has no idea at this point.
As it turns out, the hit Yaël sustained on her head when they moved from one ship to the other jarred her head once again. Apparently this isn’t the first time she’s lost some memories, but clearly it’s not something she’s growing used to.
“Just go and see, Pete,” Steve assures him, with tears in his eyes despite the happy expression he has. Is he… joyful?
“I know of two more stones,” he says, voice loud and heavy. Hilde feels Yaël shake next to her. When she averts her eyes, she finds Loki looking at them, eyes panicked, clearly telling them they need to leave. They don’t move, though. Hilde needs to get them out of here. “Gather the army, prepare for battle. Once we’re ready, we’ll head out.”
“Tony?” asks Steve in confusion once he notices. Tony doesn’t respond, instead answering the phone and pressing it against his ear.
The only thing missing, of course, is her brother. That warm feeling in her chest slightly subsides at the thought of Pietro. Unknowingly she presses her hand over her heart, pushing down to create some sort of friction. Losing him… she still can’t really describe it. It has been the worst thing that ever happened to her, probably even worse than losing her parents, because even after that they had at least each other. After his passing, she would have thought she’d end up alone, somewhere on the streets.
“Let them go,” they hear him say as they enter the hallway. Hilde holds on to Yaël’s arms as they run towards the escape bay.
She has no idea how much time has passed when Loki wakes up. She hasn’t been paying attention to it, once again focused on the mission, only.
Ten minutes later, they’re all outside again. It’s warm, the air breathable, and it feels completely abandoned. There’s something about the sunset-colored sky that irks at Tony. When he sees Quill pull out some yellow glowing device – space stuff, nothing Tony wouldn’t be able to invent on his own, obviously – he waits for him to do something with it.
“It’s possible, yeah,” the other girl responds to Loki’s suggestion. That’s when Thor seems to finally get enough of it.
They all turn to Thor, who is sitting on a chair the furthest away from them. He’s unmoving, his eyes closed as he’s starting to snore.
. Yet, as they set course, fully aware that it would probably take them about a month, maybe two to even get there. But that’s alright. They have plenty of stops on their way where they can fuel, restock on their supplies. People of Asgard carry a general amount of wealth, so if everybody puts their stuff together, it would be possible to actually buy something to keep all these mouths fed.
“I’m sorry, but we can’t stay here to chat,” he returns, avoiding the accusation she was obviously about to throw at him. He grabs her arm once again and then locks eyes with Hilde. “Take her away from here. As far away as you can possibly get her. The ship divides in two. Grab as many civilians as you can and get out of here.”
She’s also introduced to Thor’s ex-girlfriend. A short woman called Jane Foster with a big attitude and even bigger guts. According to Thor, she slapped both him and Loki without hesitation. Hilde likes this woman already. When Hilde asks why she would go to New Asgard, Jane simply explains it with ‘I’m waiting for my boyfriend to return so I can tear him a new one.” Whatever that means, Hilde is sure that it will be good to watch.
Hilde is aware that they’ve been lucky, though the term ‘lucky’ doesn’t exactly seems to cut it in this situation. Not only is Asgard destroyed and they’ve all lost their homes, but it’s obvious now that close to half of the remaining Asgardian population has been brutally massacred by Thanos and his children.
“Let’s start with the Aether.” Steve brings them back on track, pointing at the screen with the red cloud on it. “Thor, what do you know?”
“As King of Asgard, I do not accept your presence on this ship. Leave at once!” Thor’s loud voice calls out while he walks through the horde of people around them. The Purple man in the front just smirks. The other four creatures around him give their leader a short look before they move forward as well. Thor grabs the first one by the throat, pushing him back without much effort. The other three start pointing their weapons at him instantly.
Peter webs Thanos’ eyes. The best start is always to blind the enemy. The others do the rest, attempting to subdue him with their own individual powers.
“This thing on?” he asks after tapping the helmet with a sigh. The thing scans him with the last remaining bit of power it has. Tony has to gasp for breath, but it’s getting harder and harder. “Hey Mr. Rogers… Steve. If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tear-jerker.”
“That’s the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might’ve wound up pushing time through Lang. It’s tricky, dangerous. Somebody should’ve cautioned you against it.”
It takes a couple of days, but eventually the group is reunited. At least, a part of the group is. While Thor agreed to come along, Hilde decided to stay back in New Asgard to guard over the Asgardian royal heirs. Even now, it’s still her primary mission that she’s not letting go of.
Seeing the others all getting up and his past self letting out another stupid joke, Tony sees former Steve move until his back is at Tony, completely. Tony can’t help but snort, causing for his own Steve to ask him what’s wrong.
“Great idea. We’ll call you back later.” Rhodey reaches up, ending the call and swiping the hologram of Ross across the room until it’s gone. “I’m going to hear about that later. Doesn’t matter, it’s good to see you guys.”
Steve sighs. He barely reacts when Rhodey puts his hand upon Steve’s shoulder and gives it a gentle squeeze.
Normally, he would be home right now. He would have told Aunt May and Tony about his field trip from school. He would talk excitedly about almost finishing his last high school year and discuss the project he’s been working on for class. And maybe, Tony would call in Bruce and the three of them would work on it, together. But they couldn’t make it too good, because then the others in class would hate him for being an overachiever.
He knows he shouldn’t do it. He’s too busy taking out one bad guy after the other to spare a look, but he does it anyway whenever he’s in the air. As he’s shooting a beam towards one of those bastards, or whenever he’s throwing out any other weapons at them that aren’t his repulsors, he can’t help but look to the side once or twice to just catch a glimpse of him.
That answer startles Hilde. She never thought about how other people would think of her and Sif together. She didn’t even know people ever saw them together all that much.
Oh, he’s so tired of funerals. He really is. Steve gives him a sad look before throwing an arm over his shoulder and pulling him closer. Peter lets the tears roll over his cheeks. Behind him there’s everybody. Happy, who puts Morgan back down on the ground so she can join her mother, May and Rhodey, Bruce with his arm in a sling next, the Sousa-family, Thor, Jane and their three kids, Strange and Wong, The Pym-family with Scott and Cassie, Nebula and the Guardians minus Gamora, Peter’s friends standing with Yaël, Loki and the five-year-old Raido, T’Challa, Nakia, Okoye and Shuri, Clint with his sister and her kids, Wanda, Bucky and Natasha, Sam and Sharon, Harley Keener (a kid Peter yet has the pleasure of meeting), Secretary Ross (Peter was as much surprised as all the others), Maria Hill, Carol and Fury.
“Listen to me, Yaël,” Loki then says, suddenly grabbing both her arms and gently shaking her. She opens her eyes in surprise, her gaze passing on Hilde and Thor shortly the moment she catches them standing there. It’s clear in her eyes that she’s got no idea what’s going on here. “Thanos is here. You remember him, right?”
“You know what I want, child,” continues Thanos. Gamora can barely focus on his voice; so many sounds come up around her. The black-haired woman with her white dress pushes her onto her back and starts pulling away her upper clothing to check on the wound. Whatever she’s saying, Gamora doesn’t understand.
He’s just following the sounds. There’s nothing more for him to do right now; he has no plan, has no idea in which way he’s in his advantage here. This guy can move things with his mind, including those glass-like blades that he’s currently sticking up Strange’s face.
He’s supposed to be a quick thinker, but this time it’s Karen who gives him a little nod in the direction.
“Hear me, and rejoice,” the skinny one starts. “You are about to die at the hands of the children of Thanos. Be thankful that your meaningless lives are now contributing to-“
Heimdall loses all his strength, dropping his arms and his head onto the floor with the weapon stuck in his chest.
They’ve calculated their numbers before, and this plan is only going to work with them. They could have recruited more friends, but there aren’t enough materials for them to go through with that. While Scott is testing out the special suit for this, Tony checks up on Rocket building the large device that is going to make this plan work.
After they separate, Steve takes a step back when he sees Pepper approach Tony. With the woman hugging him tightly, Tony can see the others over her shoulder. Happy stands there a bit further away. Then there’s Rhodey, Clint, Natasha and Bruce.
By the time they’re entering the meeting room they find Rhodey deep in conversation with Secretary Ross. To be fair, Steve had hoped that they’d seen the last of him after the whole accord-business, but obviously that’s not going to happen; their line of work demands lots of contact with him.
“Oh, but he didn’t know,” Hilde assures him. “To be fair, he thought up until last month that Loki had been dead, too. Turns out that wasn’t true and he’d been pretending to be the King the entire time. I tell you, that family is just weird.”
“Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.” Bruce is starting to wander around while he speaks. It’s what a lot of people seem to do.
“That’s what you want. How did you find this?” Tony holds up the helmet and looks at her questioningly. Yeah, Morgan is maybe 100% completely normal, but she’s still inventive and extremely sneaky.
Natasha looks pensive. Steve has absolutely no idea what Bruce is talking about, but he trusts that he’s making a point somehow.
“Hide!” she hisses at the two men, and instantly she climbs up into the air-vent. She holds out a hand for the others to follow her. With a grunt, she gets him up.
“No. But I know that they’re two badasses accompanied by a powerful magic wizard. And to make it better, they’re three super-geniuses. There won’t be anything they can’t think their way out of.”
“They took Agnar,” the man then whispers out, looking at his hands disbelievingly. He’s shivering, looking like he’s at the verge of collapsing. Hilde turns towards him, grabbing his arms and shaking him out of his state.
He finds Steve unconscious a bit away from him. He’s holding the shield in his hand, picked it up a little bit back.
Hilde frowns, sitting down on the seat next to Yaël and throwing her arm over the armrest. “You’re dreaming while you’re awake now? Some people would call that ‘having a vision’.” She gives her a light smirk but it doesn’t reach her eyes and she knows it. Yaël simply sighs.
“I knew removing the stone from her would not kill her,” Gamora eventually continues. “Though I wouldn’t have imagined there to be a child.”
“So, uh, you probably knew I’ve been visiting Strange lately to get the Hulk’s memories back about what happened on that ship, right?” Bruce starts, scratching his hair.
“I saw this coming a few years back.” Tony gestures with his hand as if his head is exploding with their stupid questions. “I had a vision. I didn’t wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.”
“Maybe we should get back to work, huh?” Peter suggest, realizing that there’s trouble ahead. Steve nods;
The only trouble with bringing Yaël here is that it’s a package deal, as it turns out. With her came what must be the most annoying creature in the whole world; a man called Wade Wilson who has sustained unimaginable wounds onto his face and has the rare ability of never dying.
Hilde passes the house of the Royal Family. It’s not a castle; not by far. There’s no place for that. It’s just a simple house with five bedrooms and three bathrooms. There’s a large garden for the happy Golden Retriever they called Mjölnir for some reason, and last year they even installed a pool for the kids to play in.
And indeed, after a little bit, while Tony disguises himself as a swat-member, he hears Steve’s confirmation in his ear.
,” he hears FRIDAY say. She’s still active in the Compound and also the tower, despite the fact that they don’t live there, anymore. The AI is also present in the lakehouse, but only in Tony’s lab. That’s on Steve’s insistence, as a wish for at least a little bit of a normal life.
Shit, she hasn’t agreed to a meeting point with Yaël! For all she knows, the girl can be back into the main hanger with the others! With a grunt, she starts running back in that direction. She only stops when she hears another patrol pass by. Quickly, she presses the first button she finds, the room next to her opening up. Without a sound, she runs inside. After a quick look, she realizes that her only hiding spot is…
He sighs one more time. He brings up the Quantum suit, holding on to the hammer, the suitcase with all the stones and Loki’s Scepter – they almost forgot about that last one, but luckily Natasha pointed it out quite quickly.
Rhodey says nothing. All he does is reach out for him and touch the side of his head while keeping his head bowed. Tony’s known him for long enough. Rhodey doesn’t handle loss with words, but with silence.
It’s also their first ever picture together, so of course, it’s extra special to him. Tony wipes his towel over the frame to get the drops off, feeling tears well up in his eyes as he looks over his son’s smiling face.
“Steve?” Peggy asks with a breaking voice. Steve clears his throat, unable to look away from those brown eyes of hers. Her lips as fiery red as always, her hair put up neatly. She’s in a pink dress, though her feet are bare.
“I’m getting us out of here,” Hilde explains without looking up. She doesn’t want to look back at the pregnant woman, carrying the sole heir to the Asgardian Throne inside of her. She has to remember her promise to herself. Her promise to the future king of Asgard.
Sam returns. Steve can’t even see them; they’re way too distracted by the non-stop attacks thrown at them.
“Okay, okay, I’m sorry but if this matter is as urgent as you’ve claimed it to be, then we must start evacuating the ship now,” Thor says. He turns back towards Hilde and nods her way. “Search for Korg and Miek, let them help with the evacuation. Then search the escape pods, with luck, there’s enough place for everybody.”
“I’m saying that if we take out the stone there’s still a whole lot of Vision left,” Bruce admits. “Perhaps the best parts.”
“I’m sure you did your best,” says Shuri with a fake encouraging tone. That smirk is still on her face, but it’s not to be found on Wanda’s, who is still holding on to Vision’s hand and looks nothing but worried. Her long brown hair has been put up in a ponytail as well – to keep it out of her face in case of a fight.
Once the wreath has floated away until it’s out of sight Pepper gets back onto her feet. She rubs at her eyes, taking Morgan’s hand into her own as she walks away, back towards the crowd of people. She doesn’t look at anybody, merely holds on to her daughter as she starts walking back inside her house.
Wanda has no idea what Thor is talking about, but it seems pretty personal. She can hear Thanos stammer some words, but never managing to form a full sentence. Thor pushes the axe even deeper into the Titan’s chest.
There’s some talking, but mostly everybody’s quiet. Probably waiting for it to start. And from the looks of it, Pepper and Peter had been the last ones they were waiting for.
“Uh, I guess,” Tony mumbles, not really wanting to interrupt Steve like that. Whenever he’s on important Bucky-time, Tony just rather stays out of it.
Tony is shooting beams towards Thanos, but that doesn’t seem to hold him back at all. Peter sees how the pieces of nanotech are slowly running out from his legs while he puts all his power onto the beams.
He isn’t sure how she’s going to react, but still he dares himself to knock on her door. Waiting for her to open up, he wonders how different he looks now. He’s older, that much he knows. There’s even grey starting to show in his hair, though others often tell him he’s only imagining that.
Tony wants to cry it out, but his suit still doesn’t allow him to move. The sight of Okoye, accompanied by T’Challa and Shuri is such a sight for sore eyes. Without saying a word, the three slowly walk up to Steve in the same pace, looking over at him as if to greet the super soldier. All Steve can do is stare while trying to catch his breath.
Tony gives him another look. “Gotta say, I’ve been missing that giddy Avenger optimism a bit.” Steve rolls his eyes. Tony goes to sit down on the chair behind him.  “However, high hopes won’t help if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.”
But the others don’t understand his words. Of course, he’s bringing up terms that sound logical to him, but is complete nonsense to them.
Loki sounds urgent, agitated. Hilde can’t remember ever seeing him like this, but it’s not like she’s known him for that long, either. When she turns towards Thor, she finds him equally perplexed by his brother’s behavior.
Steve takes her place right after that. He looks like he’s trying all he can to hold back the tears, but Tony isn’t fooled. He can see it in those tiny little expressions. Steve is giving him a sad smile as he takes over Tony’s hand. Tony pulls away the armor there – at least still managing that. With a grunt, he moves to his pocket and takes something out, which he hands over to Steve.
“Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe, and he’s not gonna stop until he- he gets… their stones.” He points towards both Vision and Yaël, the latter not looking surprised at all.
Tony blinks back at him, grinning before he realizes it. His mind wanders back to the finished model downstairs. He could try and perfect it even more, get a 100% success rate if he puts a bit more time on it.
Steve chuckles at the memory. He hadn’t minded that much; the thing is indestructible so it’s not like she could do anything to it. Listening to Tony, he finally takes over the shield, though that contemplating look on his face clearly shows that he’s still conflicted about the whole thing.
“Tony, what the hell?” Steve grits out the moment Tony’s reached him. They make their way back to the abandoned little room they came in at. There are a couple of more people they pass by, but none of them even look up at them.
“I should probably lie down,” he continues. Why is he even doing this? Nobody is going to hear the recording. “Please know that… when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it’s always you.”
Chaos starts, people begin running into the hallway, heading in the direction where the emergency lights lead them to. After having a couple of people passing her by, she quickly follows them into the main hangar.
Strange looks a bit sceptic, but Tony can’t help but let out a relieved breath. They’re fighting the same thing. Thor is in space, going after the same guy as they are. He’s sure that they’ll run into him eventually, which is good.
“You okay?” she asks as she enters the living room of the house they’re staying in. It’s one of the larger houses; it has four bedrooms, one of them having been turned into a nursery with the help of a couple of Asgardians and some of her friends that came over last month.
In between figuring out the plan, Tony also had his side-project. Now that it’s time and they’re all back inside, Tony heads to the workshop and digs out the red-colored gauntlet he put together for this whole mission.
Tony doesn’t know what to say. It’s like his mind short-circuited and he needs a reboot or something. He can only just shake his head before kissing his son once again on the top of his head.
Steve takes Pepper’s place in Tony’s medical room. Tony doesn’t point it out. He knows Steve feels bad enough, already.
And then in the evening, Peter would call up Johnny, and they would have gone over to the statue of liberty and hang out there for a bit until it’s too late and they have to go back. Except, Johnny had been on a space mission for the past week with his team. And Peter wonders if the Four would find them in the case that they would survive this face-off.
“He went offline. They wanted just a week to themselves without any worries. I promised we wouldn’t, you know, call them or anything, so we can’t really reach them.”
“Let’s get you on the jet,” he eventually gets out, turning without another word. Natasha and Sam give each other a look. Wanda only feels worry, as there’s clearly something bothering the Captain.
He makes a pass around the corner, frowning into the living room but freezing immediately after. From the footsteps behind him he understands that the others have it just the same way.
“That’s right,” Tony smirks, not removing his eyes from Big, who is trying to make fancy, menacing movements with that axe of his. “It’s been a while. Good to have you, buddy.”
Think fast, think fast. Tony takes off his glasses and pretends to clean them as he puts the suitcase down on the chair he bumped up against. Makes it look less like he wouldn’t want to let go of it.
obvious, Wanda can tell that his voice is slightly shaking. She throws her legs over the bed and gets on her feet to make her way to Vision.
“Dad, we need to stop the bleeding,” says Peter after a moment of quiet. Tony looks down, as if he only just noticed it. He lifts his hand, and blows something into the wound. He has no idea what it is, but it’s probably something Dr. Cho invented if it’s specified for wounds.
Tony looks up at the red-haired woman. While her hair is still short, the natural color she went back for looks so much better.
With aching muscles and loud screams that nobody can hear, Hilde forces the two of them inside, before using her foot to automatically close the door. Instantly, their lungs are filled with air again. Yaël starts coughing as she seems to choke on something. Hilde quickly sits her up, slapping her on the back.
He’s in the room. They’re at a lakehouse – the tower isn’t exactly inhabitable, according to Steve, since nobody’s lived there for the past five years. As it turns out, despite Peter being gone Tony still designed a room for him when he drew out the building he was making with Steve. Perhaps some part of him had still hoped that Peter would return.
"I'd love to as well, Tony. If we can get some free time during your next heat, I'll definitely be with you for the whole thing."
Relaxing a bit Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and turned them so they were on their sides. He kissed the back of the omega’s neck gently, taking in the strong omegan scent. Very faintly, he could smell a slight change that signaled Tony’s heat would come very soon. The alpha made a pleased rumbling sound at the scent.
The door closed on him, and then Tony was plunged into a cold darkness that he wouldn’t wake up from in a very long time.
When he got to the staircase, there were several people gathered around talking already. Maria was busy making rounds and greeting everyone, thanking them for coming, a glass of champagne in her hands. Tony smiled, seeing his mother look happy and actually enjoying the party. His eyes roamed about as he noticed he was catching most everyone’s attention. He didn’t much care for the many pairs of eyes taking him in, as he was more concerned about where Steve was. Tony finally spotted him right as the blond looked up the stairs at him. A genuine smile graced Tony’s lips as he started to descend the stairs, Steve moving toward him with a dazed look on his face.
Steve buried his face in Tony’s neck and took in a deep breath of the scent. He said nothing as he committed the scent to memory, left gentle kisses on the omega’s neck before pulling him in for a proper kiss on the lips. Silence filled the room as cool air blew in around the soldier waiting at the door. Nothing broke the heavy silence until Steve pulled back to look Tony in the eye and spoke.
It was a long night for Tony. He went back and forth between being hot and cold. He tossed and turned, touched himself and held himself back from touching. Nothing felt right, nothing was comfortable. He wanted Steve so bad, even though he had the alpha’s scent surrounding him. He needed Steve to hold him down, to tell him he was going to be okay, to be with him through his heat, to calm his nerves.
“You’re not a normal soldier,” the Hydra agent said in a thick German accent. “You don’t belong here, pretty thing. It’s a shame that you’re fighting Hydra.”
When Tony was alone once more, he grabbed the picture of him and Steve in the cracked frame and curled up on his bed, allowing himself to let out the body-shaking sobs that he had been holding back since he left Steve behind in London. It was going to be a long night without Steve being in the same city Tony was.
It had only been the first time that day that they had gotten intimate, but Tony felt right out exhausted trying to provide all he could for his alpha in rut. Truthfully, Tony just wanted to sleep until his heat started up, and then he could handle taking Steve’s rut cock more than once in a day.
When the couple finally got up to the balcony Fury had mentioned, which was covered by an awning thankfully, the rain had picked up again, covering New York in a sort of calmness that put Steve at ease for the first time since he had woken up. There were a couple chairs and a side table set up, but Steve moved the table out of the way and pushed the two chairs closer together before he chose one to sit in. Tony ignored the other chair, opting to sit in Steve's lap and bury his face into the alpha’s neck.
It was around Gwen’s that he figured that his life was doomed, and that the better way to go was to have no friends at all; at least that way nobody would die. Harry had gone mad, he had just learned his parents were murdered by Oscorp, and then the love of his life died.
The others, he doesn’t really know that well. Or, he knows Mantis maybe a little bit, but not enough to really be certain about her. The same goes for the blue and green women not too far from her – though those two certainly seem to be way more experienced in combat than Mantis is.
Swarms and swarms of people come through portals. There are Asgardian soldiers, as well as Wakandan and the other sorcerers. But next to that, Tony can recognize mutants that look pissed off as Hell. Hilde comes up on a freaking Pegasus, for crying out loud! How, even?
Thanos doesn’t lie. Gamora knows that he will keep his word after getting the stone. He’ll just leave them to die here. And Gamora will be the first to go. Thanos knew exactly where to stab to give her a slow, and painful death. He’s the one who taught her this all.
“Not far.” Gamora swallows past a big lump in her throat. She guides the ship forward, heading to the troubled dot despite feeling uncomfortable with it. At this point, she’s given up her right to choose. She can’t kill Thanos out here – Nebula couldn’t, either. If she were to attempt to kill herself, she will be stopped. There’s only one way to go.
Tony gets up from the chair he was seated on. He then walks to the camera, suddenly looking up so that he’s practically staring at each of them. “
