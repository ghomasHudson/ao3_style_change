"Yeah I hope for him that he's 400% gay." Harry said and glared at her plate as she took a bite of spaghetti.
It took him a while to find the girls, having found both their rooms empty, but eventually he had spotted them outside. "Good morning, you're checking on the bees, I see?" he asked with a smile.
"Yeah, I thought they might be awake already, but we can't do that without them.. How about you find some biscuits in the kitchen and put them on nice plates and I brew some tea beforehand?" She suggested, figuring that was probably a nicer way to be woken up.
Scott laughed out loud at that. "You might have a point there. So you've been working with children the past century then?"
"Plus behind that old wardrobe there is a little bathroom, it's pretty small and old, but we could modernise it if you'd like to have your own bathroom." Sherlock said and smiled, "Otherwise, we could also turn it into a walk in wardrobe." he offered.
Sherlock smirked, having overheard the girls (Charlie's?) words as he was already standing in the doorway, "I should probably notify authorities about that given that I'm part of the team now.." he said and smiled, "But since they don't take advice from me like they would from a proper part of the team.. I'm not gonna act like it, want me to cover for you two?" he asked, walking into the room and crouching down next to Rosie's bed, "Are you going to come out, so we can talk, bumblebee?" he asked softly now. "No!" Rosie said, sniffling.
"Oh, look at you.." Violet smiled and put her hand tenderly on his cheek. "You hardly look 243." She said with a small chuckle, wondering if at least Mycroft had called him the past few years.. But who was she kidding, she knew her sons and how they thought about birthdays.
"Well, there is that guy, you know. Charming, very cute and I keep missing him terribly already when he's not around.." Sherlock mused and smirked cheekily at John.
The police officers looked both uncomfortable, when the older one of them stepped a bit forwards to talk to Sherlock. "Hello, Sir. My name is Sergeant Meyers and this is my colleague Constable Disher. Is this the home of Sherlock Holmes and John H. Watson?"
"Kinda sounds like those shouldn't be able to go together. Trustworthy and helping someone with a break-in." John pointed out with a warm chuckle.
David frowned slightly, wondering why Sherlock was looking for an excuse to talk to him in private. Though there probably were a few things... his father, the children, or was this about that proposal thing? They hadn't already got married yet, had they? ... "Yes, Rosie, we'll come down in a minute." He told her.
John jumped to his feet as well, equally unhappy about the news. He'd never liked that Lowell bloke anyway... "GUITAR!!" Charlie exclaimed. "Jesus, he showed me his guitar, paps!" She said and looked at him for a few seconds, wondering for a moment if he was still going to kill him... She had literally seen that coming hadn't she?
"Yeah, I'm so happy for you, love." John said with a smile. Even though John was not going to ask his mum over when he was sick, he knew he wouldn't know what to do if he lost her.
"Oh shut it, I'm just trying to do a good job.." Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes, but he couldn't help but laugh, "And you do know what it is. You just want to make me uncomfortable by the idea of having to explain it to you, which is working, should we get some tea upstairs?" he asked with a chuckle.
"All just strategy to keep you around." Sherlock said and chuckled lightly, brushing a few sticky strands of hair out of his face, "Seriously though, I hadn't remembered it to be this .. mind-blowing.." he said and took the bottle from John to take a sip, rinsing his mouth a little with it, before swallowing it to be kiss ready. "I actually don't think it's ever been like this before.." he murmured as he leant down to put the bottle back down.
"Abingdon House." Ron said, placing the tray on the table before sitting down.
"Oh, yeah. That's true." Charlie chuckled. "Did you ever have to do that? Explain that to someone I mean."
"And how do you spell it now?" Rosie asked curiously, thinking for a moment, "Oh! I remember, I've seen it on one of the flashcards with letters Sherlock gave me!" she said and grinned, "It's T-O-E!" she chirped with a chuckle.
John looked down after listening to Victor, because this was probably the only person who really understood his situation. ...He genuinely hadn't realised what he'd be willing to give for Sherlock not to suffer. And that's what was going to happen again, wasn't it? Just that the price he'd pay for Sherlock not to suffer again, would be staying together with the girls, Sherlock and half his family... John swallowed. "I hadn't actually thought about it that way." John said after a while. "You'd want me to do it then? if you weren't going to, I mean."
"Yeah it was, my personal highlight was your dancing, though." Sherlock said and smiled as the elevator dinged and he walked into it.
Violet nodded at that, assuming that's what happened in Sherlock's bad nightmare. "Let me just say that I think it's great step forwards that you're confronting yourself with that, even though it's frightening to you." She said, before continuing. "And what do want, Sherlock? Would you reach your goal if the nightmares stopped, you wouldn't worry about John anymore, he'd decide to turn or something else?"
John hummed in agreement. "Good thing Vanessa explained that to us in great detail. Speaking of which, have you two been in contact in the meantime?"
"I feel like I should say that you shouldn't have told a twelve year old girl she could work with you something like that in the first place." Violet pointed out. "But you're right. I'll take her out some time next week for some quality time." She said. "How are they dealing with the new situation anyway?"
"Yeah.." John said with a sigh and took the last bite of his steak. "It would be great if your mum could talk to him some time in the near future."
"Yeah, yeah.." Sherlock said and chuckled, "I can't help it, though.. your brother is just irresistible.." he said and Harry laughed, "God you're even worse than Clara and me." she said and shook her head, "Out now. Dad dislikes unpunctuality.. and there already is enough he can dislike about the situation, no need to add that." she said and Sherlock sighed, pecking John's lips again, before he got out of the car.
"Wait, Mycroft's got a- you know what, never mind." John said and shook his head, before sitting down. Why was he still surprised by those things? "A forty minute delay isn't the end of the world and now we've got nice seats." He said, before taking out the physiology notes he'd kept in the pocket of his jacket.
"No she wasn't.. but I could hardly tell you and your parents about that. David would have recognised me no doubt." Richard said and sighed, "I just wanted to be with her again.. maybe that was selfish, but.. I've missed her." he said and Sherlock smiled at that, he could definitely relate to it. He had stayed with Victor too until he died and if John wouldn't decide to turn, he'd stay with him for the rest of his life too.
"Let me loose on the public?" William asked and chuckled again, he just couldn't help it, those two were so ridiculously appalled, it was hilarious. "If you think that I'm a danger to the public, that it's perhaps even contagious, then shouldn't you take a step back?" he said with a snicker.
"Got it" John nodded and followed close behind, his heart thudding loudly. // This was it, she'd almost reached the living room, where the film was still rolling. One more flight and she'd be with Charlotte...
Rosie was a little stunned about the joke, she had never even thought about that her name was a kind of colour, but she giggled just a moment later. "Charlie..." she mumbled after another small moment, "I like that you're my sister now. You're the best sister in the whole world!" she said and smiled sheepishly at the other girl.
"Showing you his.. I'm going to murder him. Victor if you want me to convey any last words better tell me now." Sherlock said and already started to take his wet shirt back on, it was cold but it would do, this would be over fast.
Vanessa was quiet for a while and David was definitely not the next person to say something. "What I can tell you after decades of experience is that no one ever 'just' leaves. No one." Vanessa's tone was gentler now though made sure not to sound pitying or even properly comforting. And that was good because David would've likely lost it if she had; He wasn't anywhere close to acknowledging his emotions. "Why then?" He didn't look up at her. His mind couldn't come up with a single valid reason that didn't hurt to his core. "There's only one person that can really tell you that."
John's hand quickly came up to settle in Sherlock's hair. He felt more alive than he had in months; and that on a trip to boot's to get lube.. Perfectly happy in that moment, he opened his mouth and kissed Sherlock passionately back.
"Don't have to, I know I've got it with me." Sherlock said and shook his head, scanning the shelves and frowning as he spotted the variety of 'supplies', "Do people really need all that?" he asked and rolled his eyes. His frown deepened as he glanced over the condoms, "Uhm.. do we need those? I mean.. well it's not like I even get serious STD's and.. I suppose if it's been more than a hundred years since you've been with someone you count as pretty much clean.."
"Dad just said that the weirdest thing he's found in the flat was a bowl of eyeballs. What did you need those for?" She asked and sat down next to him, pulling her feet up.
"Really, and what may be the reason for that? According to your file you've been living in an abusive home, if I understand correctly?" The doctor asked and opened it again to have another look.
John chuckled a bit at that and when they finally got to the front of the living room Charlie took the bags off Sherlock. "We'll come downstairs in five minutes. See you" She grinned and waited for Rosie to follow her up to their rooms.
Walking downstairs, Sherlock quickly made his way over to the door, making a mental note to put a peephole into the door, so they could check who was standing behind it, before opening it. Unlocking it, he chuckled a little, "Oh.. hi Lowell." he said, quite relieved that it wasn't a murderer and/or kidnapper. "What are you doing here?" he asked, stepping aside to let his.. sort of brother in law in, "Well, I was just wondering if I could borrow a couple of blood bags from you? Just to tide me over a bit of a shortage? I mean you did offer so.." Lowell said with his trademark smirk as he walked into the house. "No, sure that's fine, although I should probably stock up my supplies in future." he said with a laugh, "My consumption has risen a little." he said as they walked up the stairs together.
Sherlock nodded at that, "Probably." he said and smiled at his fiancé, "You know this changes nothing between us, though, right?" he asked, wishing he could just hug John, but out in the open, even in the dark they couldn't do that. Maybe a hug wouldn't be so weird, but he didn't want to take any risks. "I love you." he said and chuckled, "And as soon as I've rinsed my mouth properly, I'll kiss you. Just a warning. Prepare yourself for the moor monster." he said and chuckled softly, starting to pick a few leaves out of his hair.
"Right, that." John chuckled, already looking forward to that one. "If I tell Dad, I'll have to give my Mum a heads up too though. But I'll figure something out. Harry will be the first one to know though."
Sherlock smiled lightly, before coughing again, "Don't worry we're not that far away from fingerprint locks anymore. That's gonna save you that trouble."
"Missed you too." Sherlock murmured back and pecked his lips again, before he gestured him to get into the cab.
"Yes, let's get that over with." John nodded and walked back towards the bound girl. "I wouldn't put it beyond her to get out of that chair and we don't need her to be surrounded by knives if she does." John said and picked her back up, though this time around Fay wasn't moving much at all. "Could you open the door, please?"
"Morning, love." John said with a smile and set the tray down on the empty side of the bed to lean down to kiss him. "Happy Valentine's day. I thought I'd fix us something before the girls are up."
"Like a train wreck.." Sherlock mumbled and sighed as he looked at his mother with a smile, "Thanks for.. you know.. coming around." he said and felt slightly embarrassed about this after all. He was more than 200 years old, he probably shouldn't ask for his mummy anymore at this point.
"Strange how that works." Charlie shrugged. "And did he really react that badly? I meam, it's a shock for us too, but you know."
Sherlock laughed, "Yeah, I can see how that would be counter productive." he said with a smile.
"Yes, exactly. If you move the mouse on the table the white triangle here on the screen moves the same way." John explained to her, before pointing at the screen. "All of those little pictures have different tasks and if we move the triangle - we call that cursor - on top of them and click them, we ask the computer to do those things for us. If you move the cursor on here and click twice then the computer will show us Sherlock's photos."
"Then wear it with pride." John said with a chuckle and came over to kiss his cheek. "I could tell they liked you right from the start It might actually be a good idea for you to work with children."
"Well.. Greg seems to be a nice guy." Sherlock said and smiled, "Gonna work with him a lot, I think. Which is definitely better than Rachel.." he said and rolled his eyes, saying her name. "Bit rude how she kept drooling over you after I told her you're my fiancé.."
"Better not. But I guess I'll have my share in it. I'm a writer. We appreciate all parts of the story unlike those types of persons that read the last page of a book first." Jane said with a chuckle, "So. No. Don't tell me anything unless it's necessary."
Sherlock was quiet for a second, "Uhm.. I think we have to talk about the definition of 'not very dangerous'.. that is ridiculously dangerous. Even with super healing, I'm not even sure it'd heal if you break your neck, Charlie. I mean, beheading is one of the ways to kill a vampire and it's very likely it's because the brain is disconnected from the rest of your body, which can happen if you do break your neck as well." he said seriously, "Until we've met a vampire that survived breaking their neck, or who has experienced paraplegia and it healed completely, I'd really like if you wouldn't tempt fate there." he said and wondered if it really was such a good idea not to tell the kids what's going on until a certain age.
Ah, that was him then. Quite nervous, was he? Well good, better than some insolent cheek. "Yeah, she's right upstairs.  I'm John, her father." He said and offered him his hand with a bit of a smile.
"That'd be really cool." Charlie said with a grin. "A bit of a waste, but cool. Thanks, paps."
"Sure anytime!" Ron replied maybe a bit too quickly, but well, so what. "We could go.. tomorrow.. I mean.. it's a Saturday, then my dad isn't working, which is probably better, he's a bit weird when I bring new friends."
"Of course." Sherlock said and rolled his eyes after all, really this woman was rather tedious. "Well, I suppose you have to come outside with us then." he said and walked slowly with Rosie to the door, "Alright, Rosie, when we go outside at the street, you can't let go of my hand, okay? No matter what." he said, just wanting to make that clear, "Okay. I promise." she said and smiled as Sherlock opened the door.
Sherlock chuckled, watching the two, quite thankful that John had said no, because he had already been about to say that of course they could stay up to watch a film. He really had to practice to say no.
"No it's totally understandable, I'd probably have been a bit taken aback as well if we'd meet an ex girlfriend of you or something." Ron said and gave her a smile, "Don't worry about it."
Violet smiled at that, glad that Sherlock accepted his new sisters that readily (she needed to remind herself again that he was a grown man and not a post-pubescent teenager). "That's impressive, darling. They'll be lucky to have a skilled mentor like yourself." She said and added. "And Paul and my schedules are really a bit tight, so we'd appreciate that a lot." She said and considered offering him money for a second, before coming to the conclusion that that would be more insulting and distancing than anything else.
"That sounds just about perfect actually." John agreed, smiling at Sherlock a little. He could really do with a bit of a break; even if it was only noon.
The rest of the day passed quietly, John eventually left for work and when they had finished all their bees, Sherlock had helped Rosie with hanging up the bees in her room, before they gave the rest of the kinder eggs to the other kids, which really seemed to help improve the opinions of the kids about Rosie - although it was sad that it took free chocolate for that, instead of them putting some more effort into getting to know her. After saying goodbye to Rosie, Sherlock talked again to Mrs Hope, who told him that both of them could soon start to work here and that John was supposed to call about working out what days of the week he could train the kids.
"That's very convenient indeed." Violet chuckled. "Speaking of which, I'm going to go back to Paul and my girls soon, so tell me if you still want to talk about something today, honey."
"...Are you being serious right now?" Charlie asked him wide-eyed... Sherlock definitely didn't have to tell her that that was a big responsibility, she was pretty aware of that. Though she did want to know what his and John's conversation tonight would look light. "You really trust me that much?"
"Molly said they're also supposed to protect the little and sick ones in our community that can't get vaccines themselves." Charlie said with a smile. "That's exactly right. They don't only protect us, but also everyone around us. If many people can't pass on illnesses we're much safer." John explained, before setting the bag down once they were at the car.
Before Amber could say anything to that the twins had already noticed that the door was open and ran excitedly past Amber and to their new brother and John. "Lock!! We'll see lions! /And/ tigers!!" Amy squealed happily and grasped a bit of Sherlock's shirt, jumping up and down.
"Is that.. a yes?" Sherlock asked, before starting to get out of the car and grabbing their suitcases, they did have a flight to catch after all.
Violet opened the car door and put Ally into her booster seat in the back. Once she'd done that, she brushed her thumb over Amy's cheek, who had nodded off on their way downstairs and was now sleeping on her brother's shoulder.
Greg turned around and smiled at the younger-looking man. From his appearance he could easily be a student of a similar school (or a former one?) "Yeah, that's me, mate. How can I help ya ?"
"Yeah, I would hope so. I don't like the thought of having to disappear into the bedroom with you just to kiss." John chuckled. "No, I was actually thinking about the two of us having having some alone-time in between work, uni, children and whatever is going on in the orphanage." And that proposal, he added in his mind. "But I guess those have to be our priorities right now."
"I'm guessing the warehouse?" Charlie asked and buckled up. "Man, I shouldn't have just skimmed my file that night.."
"No they're cool actually. Like your dad.. I mean.. Sherlock. He told me how his great great grandfather let a whole bunch of pirates out of prison when he was a kid and got that skull in return." Ron said with a giggle, "I wish my family had that kind of family trivia."
John had to chuckle because he could remember that expression quite clearly. "On second thought, could you pass me that glass after all?"
Charlie went inside and waited on the stairs for both of them. "Do you already know when he'll be back?" She asked curiously, wondering if they'd get to put their beds together in the meantime.
"The only thing I can think of that's different here is that we don't have actual food with every meal." Sherlock said and sighed, hating that they apparently weren't good for their daughters.
"She did what?" John asked and furrowed his brow. "I don't doubt it actually, but I don't know if that speaks for Rosie's abilities or the lack of security in Mrs. Hope's office."
"That sounds nice actually. And I wonder how he'll react to his children marrying. Yeah, we could ask them next Sunday what they think of that." John said with a smile. "I need to show you the pictures of their wedding sometime. They looked so happy despite the few guests and everything."
"Good god, John it's just a navel piercing, she's not gonna get a full body tattoo." Sherlock said with a smile. "And even for mortals when you leave them out long enough the hole sometimes closes up again with vampire healing she it would close up faster."
"That's amazing. I've never heard music like that before." Lowell said and grinned at Charlie, "Can you teach me how to play it?" he asked, shifting a little closer to Charlie on the edge of the fountain, giving her a little smile, a faint blush forming on his cheeks.
"I said that I will not date that girl." William said and bit the inside of his lip, wondering how to get out of that conversation without any consequences.
"Yeah, probably. But if she enjoys the violin, maybe she just needs some time. I mean, it's been less than a week after all." John commented. "Are you sure you know where you're going? You just missed a turn over there."
"Alright... is there any reason you look ready to hold your speech in which you state you're going to stand for prime minister?" Sherlock asked, shutting his laptop to focus on his daughter properly.
"Good morning too, Sally, oh thanks, I'm fine, how are you?" Sherlock asked with a roll of his eyes, walking right past her, "And yes, it is right. Problem?" he asked, wondering why he even engaged in conversation with her.
"I have actually. And we're still together thankfully." Scott smiled. "You know after I'd tried to explain everything for twenty minutes, he didn't believe me and said if I'm so sure I should bite him and well, the rest is history really."
Charlie rolled her eyes at the first one, before answering. "Yeah, John. Well, he's studying medicine to become a military doctor and he's working as a paramedic right now. And he's more.. I dunno, grounded than Sherlock. So like, if Rosie decides she wants to get a pony, for example, John will step in to tell her it'd be too lonely in our basement. And then he'll stop Sherlock from buying three." She said with a laugh.
Sherlock frowned a little as Charlie moved his hand in front of her face, but shrugged and simply closed his eyes, "Goodnight." he said softly.
"I agree; I doubt Mrs H. would be too happy, if we were too late." John said with a chuckle. "You said it's down the road?"
"You know, one thing John told me about, is that near-car accident he had as a primary schooler. With that stranger who saved him and made a run afterwards." Realisation dawned on his face, shortly followed by an array of emotions (way too many for him to be anywhere close to his comfort zone) he'd felt back then like relief, gratitude, anger (at that bloody driver and himself for not teaching John better), though eventually he ended up wearing a grim expression. "He's practically immortal anyway, isn't he?" A comment solely intended to hurt somebody who wasn't even in the room. He was already past the point where he cared what Vanessa thought of him.
"I told her what you told me, that you think she's a dear." Sherlock said and smiled, "It's kind of sad that she's that insecure, though.. she's playing a role with her friends, you know, because she thinks they won't like her when she's herself."
"Alright, let's find them then." John said with a chuckle followed her along to what he presumed was the teacher's lounge. "So, I've already met Arthur yesterday." He commented. "How do you get along with Sally?"
"I've actually never had the pleasure." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "The injection and it's needle was actually invented shortly before I was born but well it was like it was with every new invention, people needed time to adjust to it and trust it.. I've actually gotten a phlebotomy once when I was little.." he said and rolled his eyes.
"Long term has a different meaning for me." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, pecking John's lips, before standing up, "And before my doctor boyfriend gets angry again, I'll have dinner." he said and smiled at John.
"Yes, sure Sherlock." Violet said and glanced over to him. "How much wine exactly did she manage to drink?" She asked him after a moment, remembering how Sherlock had described her back at her home.
Sherlock smirked a little, "Well.. I admit the acting isn't bad by comparison.." he said teasingly leaving open what he compared it with, though John would probably guess.
Hm, interesting. She turned back to Rosie then who thankfully looked almost normal again if it hadn't been for her puffy eyes. "Now, Rosie, what about those cookies? I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel hungry." Charlie said with a smile.
"The former. I suspect that's partly because of the thick stone walls." The nurse said and went out of the room. "Come on, the water isn't freezing. I'll give you your towel and clothes once we're there."
"Yeah he is.." Sherlock said and glanced up at his mother, "I think almost more so than Victor.. maybe at the time Victor was the right one for me, but with John.. you know.. with Victor.. I felt like I wouldn't want to live without him, with John it feels like I /can't/ live without him.." he said and sighed, snuggling up closer.
"Did you agree to get her piercing then?" John asked, looking right through Sherlock's expression.
"I second that." Charlie said with a chuckle. "We could get Neapolitan ice cream. That's a kind berry and two kinds of beans right there in one bowl." She said, feeling kind of clever about being cheeky there.
John grinned as he watched Sherlock stumble out of bed and went over to his boyfriend with a chuckle. "I really don't mind to be the one responsibly for making you squirm on your seat." He leaned in to casually run a hand through his dark, dishevelled curls. "Sex hair suits you, handsome." John said with a fond smile.
"I was actually fine with the pillows." John teased with a smirk, before running his hand down from Sherlock's back to his waist. Gently tugging his waistband down, he brushed Sherlock's lips with his own.
"Oh, erm sure." Charlie nodded and went with Sherlock back up the stairs. After a few minutes they'd managed to convince her to go out with them for an hour to sit at an ice café (fancy!) and Charlie helped Rosie put some winter clothes over her pyjamas, figuring at extra layer really couldn't hurt at that time of the year. "You've got my phone number, don't you? And don't worry too much about John, I'm sure he's going to come around to all of this." Mrs. Hudson told him with a reassuring smile, before going downstairs to the waiting girls.
"Nice. Having parents is still rad." Charlie said with a tired grin. "You know, I've been thinking.."
Sherlock chuckled a little
"Just a second!" Sherlock said, having just been busy helping Rosie in the bathroom with a particular sturdy button on her trousers (he had been just seconds away from simply cutting the trousers off the wiggling girl, before it had popped open) and was now holding her up in front of the sink so she could wash her hands.
"Yeah, I think you're the third person in two weeks to say that. But I mean there are worse comparisons." John said with a chuckle and took Sherlock's hand, before standing up as well and giving it a squeeze. "It was nice to meet you, Lowell." John told their guest with a short but genuine smile.
"Hi Clara! Hi Harry!" Rosie said and looked around with big eyes, "Hey little one." Harry said and gave Rosie a smile, "And hey not so little one." he said with a wink to Charlie, "I've heard you've got yourself a brave knight.. I want to hear all about him." she said, really curious about this Ron guy John had told her about a while ago.
"You know what, I'd actually rather ask him myself, if that's alright with you." John said and put his cutlery back onto his plate, before getting up to his feet as well. "I'll be back in a minute."
Too far gone, Jim didn't hear him anymore and just continued throwing punches at the increasingly disfigured poor sod on the ground. "Call some more nurses, we've got to break this" One of the nurses said to his colleague, still trying to break the group apart without success. "He'll go into solitary after this"
"I should very much hope so." Sherlock said, finding the comparison kind of insulting on an intellectual level. "But for the record, you're also a way better catch than Clara." he said and chuckled a little. "Or Harry."
Excerpt from Chapter 17: In The Lion's Den - Pt. 1
"Oh, right..." John nodded slowly, though the fact that his colleague had made out with Sherlock and was together with the bloke that had hit on Sherlock... They'd have a couples night over his dead body, they weren't. Meanwhile Scott still couldn't believe this was happening. "So that's why you wanted me to take on John's shifts? I thought you'd only gone on a holiday." He said with a chuckle.
"I'm sure I would too. After all she's got the highest recommendations with you and Rosie, doesn't she?" John said with a smile and took Sherlock's hand, getting to his feet too.
"I was just thinking about whether he was going to help us out the beds together." Charlie said, walking upstairs. "How long does putting beds together take anyway? Half an hour each?"
John pulled Sherlock closer towards himself, his hand resting on Sherlock's sternum. Shuffling a bit, his head came to rest just behind his fiancé's "Love you."
"Alright so.. I guess it's good we have that out of the way." Ron said with a laugh, "And.. well Colin was my first boyfriend.. I don't have a string of exes or so.. I mean.. that'd be weird, I'm only fourteen." he laughed.
"Uh huh." Rosie said, nodding as she led the two men towards the play room, "She's already /twelve/!" she said and smiled, "But she's really nice to me when I talk to her. I think she's very smart too. And sometimes people get mad at her for saying things too." Rosie said and for Sherlock that did sound like they probably should try to get Mrs Hope to do a general IQ testing around here.
"Yeah, sure thing." Charlie said and gave her a smile. "Do you write your 3's and E's facing the same way then?" She asked her as they began to walk outside.
"I don't think two years matter so much if you're well beyond the 200's." Sherlock chuckled and shook his head, "Anyway.. maybe you can help us, though.. we have to let David in on the whole vampire thing. Not only is his daughter one, but.. well.. I served with his father in the second world war and eventually turned him to save him.. and we want to reunite them, but John thinks it's gonna be harder than convincing him it's the truth.. which.. was pretty hard." he said and shrugged.
"Yes, very good, sweetheart." Vanessa praised her youngest. "Chipmunks!" Amy called quickly, really enjoying this game a lot. "They can even sing and wear funny jumpers!" She said and giggled at the thought.
Charlie made a face at that and pulled her headphones out of her pocket to plug them in. "Eww. I was serious about the no details thing." She said and Amber snorted in the background, before getting up. "Way to go, John. I'll give you some privacy, Charlie." She teased him and patted her shoulder, figuring that either way they probably wanted to talk to her alone.
"No, it'll only turn yellow in here." Charlie shook her head and carefully took out Rosie's photo for her. "But you have to swear that you'll guard it like gold. You can't lose it or spill juice on it or rip it. It's the only picture you'll ever have of them, alright?"
Sherlock chuckled, "He's just saying that to not look like a fool, he actually did mean to give you all three, that mother hen." he teased, leaning over to peck John's cheek.
"That's quite the compliment right there." John said with a bit of a smirk after swallowing. "And I agree, it tastes fantastic. Thank you for cooking for us."
"Miss Watson is in town for a few days with her older brother and her younger sister." Jane said and smiled a little, "Mr Trevor, is there something you might want to ask Miss Watson?" she asked after a few seconds of silence between them, while the two younger people just stared at each other, "Oh, yes. Of course. Yes." Lowell said somewhat sheepishly and cleared his throat, "May I have the next dance, Miss Watson?" he asked and Jane couldn't help but chuckle a little to herself.
"Yeah, I mean at least we know it's not life-threatening.." Sherlock said and suddenly wasn't so sure about that anymore either.
"Of course not." Sherlock called from the kitchen, "Such a lovely person.." he said dryly and rolled his eyes. "You know, Charlie once put bugs into Sally's bag and she screamed really loud as she opened it." Rosie said as she reached for the tree again to fix the last lights.
Charlie blushed a little and gave Mrs. Hudson a bit of a grin, before asking. "You know, the story involves a guitar, a fountain and sitting under the moonlight. Wanna hear it?" She asked her with a smirk at which Mrs. Hudson cackled. "Of course I do, all the interesting details."
John got the three glasses for his parents and himself and carries them with a bottle of water to the table, while Charlie got the missing plates.
"No, I'm not insane." John said and shook his head, looking as if that was as a serious threat he wanted to avoid, which in turn made Charlie chuckle a bit. "And I should say that I strongly agree with Sherlock there. You and Rosie belong to our little family and nothing's going to change that, so now I just really want to get to know you." John said with a smile. Charlie looked down, not really knowing what to say that. "I- yeah, me too. Thank you a lot." She said to them after a few seconds.
"Me too." Victor said with a sigh, "It's just a little hard to .. think about it, but I've still got 70 years with him after all. So that's something." he said and smiled a little., unfolding the blanket he was holding. "Your little girls are quite precious, though." he said and smiled, "Rosie especially, I'm glad you've found her."
After eating pizza together, they eventually ended up in front of the fireplace again, while the cold wind was blowing outside. Snuggled up in a kind of blanket fort in between three chairs they were roasting marshmallows Sherlock had texted John to buy and drinking hot chocolate. "Rosie, be careful, I think yours is falling off your stick." Charlie said after swallowing a mouthful of hot chocolate.
"Well.. I suppose I can't force you to believe what I'm saying, guess you'll have to wait and see and..
"Mmh, good idea." John agreed. "Could you do that though? I don't know where my phone is right now." John said and traced his fingertips gently over Sherlock's back.
"Okay William. You're sharing a room with three other nice people here." The nurse said calmly and clearly. "We'll have you washed, redressed and looked at by a doctor and then you can go see your room. We have some very simple rules here; If you don't break them, you won't get into trouble." He said for the probably three hundredth time as he brought him into an exam room. "Don't get close enough to other patients to touch them in any way and do what the people wearing uniforms tell you to. Do you understand?"
Sherlock sighed against John's lips, "You know, I don't think we have to refrain from kissing completely. I'm pretty sure the girls can take seeing little pecks." he chuckled against John's lips, not wanting to break the contact just yet.
"Oh, but wouldn't you like it to be a surprise?" Sherlock asked with a laugh, taking another bite of lasagna, "Oh.. but.. since we're talking about weddings..." he began, picking up his glass again as he chewed on the lasagna, "We could make it a double wedding.. with Clara and Harry? I mean, I know the two of them are already married but.. if your dad would come this time.. it would be a nice gesture if he comes for both of you."
"Not our only wedding after all then." John chuckled. "I'm pretty sure we'll figure something out." He said with a smile. "But I can't get used to the idea that Rosie will eventually look our age."
"Alright, but get out of the dress before, so you don't stumble, looking for another." Sherlock said and chuckled a little. "It really is too long."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "I've had combat medic training in two world wars and I really think the process of drawing blood and attaching infusions hasn't changed that much. I'm confident in my abilities, I'm just nervous about.. well all of it. I'm nervous about.. this. It's strange, I'm glad you're doing it, no question, I just.. I just hope you're really as sure as you say." he said with a smile as he prepared the equipment.
Sherlock's eyes widened at that, causing him to look around hectically. Where was she? He hadn't even noticed Rosie wasn't with them, but she had been definitely with them when they had... travelled? When they had broken down the wall anyway. And she had been with Charlie when they had seen their torch disappear. So where was she? "Maybe.. she's at home?" he asked, hoping it was true, but it didn't make sense for her not to have travelled with them. She had to be here somewhere. "We'll find her, wherever she is." Sherlock stated eventually, getting out of the bed and looking down at himself, before looking at the other's clothes. "But not like that. We need to change. Charlie you can't walk around like that outside, that'd be like walking around in bra and slip back home." he said and looked at John, "And you can't wear jeans and trainers.." he mumbled, scratching the back of his neck.
"Wow, sounds like I've missed quite a lot." John said, before listening to the rest of Sherlock's story and how his initial suspicions had been confirmed. "Jesus" John said eventually. "That's... bad."
"Yes, that's quite a fitting description." Sebastian Moran said with a bit of a smile. "He seems to look up to you, from what I can tell. Do you think that's true?"
"No siblings. But I do a lot of babysitting for the neighbours." Ron said and smiled, "It's actually my plan B. If I decide I don't like med school after all, I'll go for becoming a kindergarten teacher."
Sherlock might knew his flat in and out, but after a minute of blindly fumbling for the door handle of his bedroom, he sighed, breaking the kiss reluctantly to open the door, taking John's free hand and pulling him into the room, "Are we going to go outside again at all today?" he asked, "Because if we're aren't I see no reason why we shouldn't change into something more comfortable.”
"I had no idea you were that cuddly a partner." John smiled brightly at him and took his plate, holding Sherlock's hand with his free one. "Not that I'm complaining though. Not at all."
Ron smiled, lacing his fingers with hers, "Alright then.. let's go."
"Good, that sounds perfect." John chuckled. "Did you have any plans for tonight too or do you think I can still let the guys buy me a pint?"
"We're doing great, how are you two?" Sherlock asked and smiled, genuinely glad to see her, "Has Rosie had any luck teaching Amy and Ally ballet yet? I know she wanted to try."
"But it's pretty easy to proof though. If we wanted to, I mean. Like, the spit thing, the better stamina, the drinking blood etc." Charlie said after some thought. "Do you think there are actually people like us locked away? Like, if they had no immortal friends and told someone." She said, the thought making her a bit uneasy.
"We could hire him again for Charlie's party. Obviously, I'll have some of Mycroft's people supervise him undercover, but that way, I could meet him and see if it's really him." Sherlock said with a shrug.
Charlie grinned at that and John could already see where that was going. "I think I'll keep looking in that case." She said with a wink and handed Sherlock the dress, before turning around again to tease him.
"Wait bags? What bags?" Sherlock asked and looked back and forth between his mother and his fiancé, absolutely confused.
"Hang on." Sherlock said and quickly shot Greg a text,
"We look ridiculous." Sherlock stated and took John's hand, to lead him out of the bedroom, "I can't wait for Charlie to unwrap her new laptop, actually. She'll be thrilled, probably not so thrilled about the internet restrictions coming along with it, but maybe we can mention that a little later."
"Is it still in my arm?" Rosie asked, not daring to look at her arm again, but she did open her eyes to look up at Charlie.
"Yeah? Did you two stay in close contact after your return?" He asked, thinking that he should find the fact his boyfriend 'raised' his granddad weirder than he did. Probably because even on photos his he was more his gran's young husband than anything else.
"Well, I don't think raising the average IQ is their goal, but.. well, yeah, I think someone's stalking out kids like that and turning them for what reason ever." Sherlock said and frowned, "It's not a coincidence, it can't be."
John nodded and returned to watching Sherlock cook, since it didn't look like their were too many tasks left he could busy himself with. "Really can't wait for those dancing lessons then." He remarked. "Now, what else needs to read done?" He asked, having little to no idea how to cook a lasagne.
"Well you've seen what I was like when you burst in on me and Victor." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "That was .. most of what we did back then.." he said and smirked.
John was a little disappointed when Sherlock was up on his feet that quickly and smiled a little to himself at those questions. "I don't really have to see everything right now love." He said, before rising to his feet and going up to Sherlock. The room was cosy enough for him as it was, so he wouldn't have a problem with staying right here. Standing close to the other again, he wrapped an arm around his torso and looked up at him.
"Well, we mostly kidnapped people who were out on the street too late." Janine said and glanced down. "Never children, though, but it still wasn't nice. And while I'd been feeding on people out on the street until the invention of blood banks, I never did it to that extent."
John signed the card himself and put it together with the small present into his jacket's pocket. "You're right. Let's go then." He said and slid his hand into Sherlock's, before remembering something. "Have you brought some blood by the way? We might not be back until the late evening."
"That would be really cool!" Rosie chirped as Sherlock put her into her car seat, fixing her belts, "Well, if Charlie helps you pick one, you can be sure it's going to be really pretty." he said with a smile.
Amy nodded slowly. "Hmm.. okay." John got inside next to Sherlock, glancing back at the children. "What was that about me and a car seat?" He asked with a raised eyebrow, having only got fragments of that conversation.
"Both. That and decency." The nurse replied. "You should treat the people around yourself carefully, you can't know what they're dealing with or how they'll react. Hurting each other won't be tolerated, obviously. Can you accept those rules?"
Charlie smiled and picked the remote back up, before pressing play. "That's not him yet, that's just some random guy" She explained in a hushed voice, leaning a bit into his side. "That's him there on the blanket and there's me lying next to him."
Sherlock chuckled, "I just really can't believe this would work out like that, I mean, I'd have been happy with not hostile behaviour from your father, please, /please/ let me be the one to tell Harry he hugged me even though I told him I'm intending to marry you." Sherlock said and grinned, "But.. perhaps lets not tell her that while she's driving."
Charlie grinned, because that was the best kind of praise. Kind of like when they'd broken into Mrs. Hope's office twice. "Having been bribed like that, I'll have to go with proud here." John said with a chuckle.
"Err.. Sherlock this was bound to happen eventually. You do know what periods are, right?" John asked, ignoring the weird looks he was getting.
John didn't look too happy at that, but decided it wasn't worth the fuss the first time they went shopping together; and Sherlock had cheated, so technically that's what they had agreed on. He knew he'd be uncomfortable living off of Sherlock, no matter if he had more money or not. It just wasn't something he'd been taught to do. But for now, he pushed that thought aside, since he knew that right now he would just be blowing things out of proportion; they could really talk about that at another time. Once their bag was filled, he took Sherlock's hand and went with him to the exit. "We might want to walk this time."
So the two men were like in love. Daphne had heard that sometimes men fall in love with men and women with women, but this was the first time she's seen it. She liked it though. She always liked when people in films loved each other and those two were engaged, so that meant they loved each other a lot, right? As she hid again, she couldn't help but wonder which of them was supposed to wear the white dress though.
"Sure, go ahead." Sherlock said and frowned, "Said the fun parent, does the boring parent have an opinion?" he asked with a chuckle, looking over at John.
"What other thing?" Scott asked quickly and John chuckled again. "Alright, well, we were joking around that morning and that led to my saying I'd marry him if he turned up in a tank dressed in a cocktail dress. So that's what he did. But you do look great in dresses and heels." John chuckled and wrapped and arm around Sherlock's waist.
Sherlock chuckled, "Harry forgot her clothes by the way." he said, with a roll of his eyes, pulling out a bra he was lying on and which must have been lying somewhere on the bed last night. "It's that.. or you have some explaining to do..." he said, holding up the black bra.
Sherlock smiled, "Glad to be of use." he said and chuckled, sitting up a bit more, "The violets are nice.." he said and reached out to touch the petals, "They're nearly the same shade as the ones I have upstairs.. was that intentional?"
"Awesome, that's it." Charlie said with a smile and opened the bathroom door. "Then let's go upstairs. I should still have a bow somewhere in my room."
"Yeah, we do have our perks, don't we?" John asked with a chuckle and handed Sherlock the glass, though he kept his hand on the mug for support. "And it's still soon-to-be."
John laughed a little at that. "I doubt that too. Speaking of which, what would you think of having children? I mean, later on, obviously."
"She's the kind of person that basically adds everyone she likes to her family right away." Sherlock said with a small smile, figuring the reasons for that were that she never had children and he assumed she was turned after her menopause. He supposed there was a chance that it'd revert back to before after being turned, but it didn't seem likely since it wasn't something that was wrong with the body, but something that occurred naturally.
"Well, at home we are feeding Amy and Ally the exact same things, apart from their drinks." Paul paused for a moment. "Their blood levels are practically identical apart from Ally's higher vitamin C levels because of all of the apple juice..."
"I second that; girls usually aren't too fond of being treated like property." John said with a bit of a smile. "See, there you go, Carl." Scott said with a grin. "Weren't you straight at some point too, Johnny?" "Well, I've always had a bit of a hunch that wasn't entirely true, but then Sherlock asked me out and we made marriage plans. I guess that's how these things go sometimes." He said with a laugh. "I'd never have thought the station and an orphanage would help us both get laid at one point." He commented with a chuckle.
"Oh yeah." Ron said happily, "Still slow and well." he said and chuckled a little, though he did notice the loss of Charlie's hand. "Erm.. you know what, let's talk later? Charlie and I were actually heading to dads café."
"Sherlock, she's /twelve/ and that hole's going to be there forever." John said and gave him a look. "At least hair grows out. We could put a tracking chip into her bloody shoes for that matter, which is something I'm still not thrilled by."
"Woah.." Rosie said as she heard her own heartbeat, listening intently, "That's cool! Charlie here!" she said and held out the ear part to her sister, "Listen to my heart!"
"Bye Paul" Charlie said, before turning away to cough. "Bye girls. Get well soon." Paul said with a smile, before taking his bag and going with Sherlock out of the flat.
"Me! I want!" Rosie said and smiled, "Can you really hear my heart with that?" she asked inspecting the little metal knob Paul was holding against his arm. "Can I hear it too?"
"Mmm, do you think Harry and Clara maybe want to adopt?" She asked after a moment, since she couldn't think of that many vampire couples. If she and Lowell got together, they'd definitely adopt a child from the orphanage... Oh, think of something different, before it's obvious who you're thinking about! Had Sherlock said something? Damn, just pay attention now.
"Well, as long as you don't start calling her donkey.." John said quietly and rolled his eyes a bit, which made Charlie laugh. She's already put on a pair in her size and was 'walking' around in then slowly (yeah, she definitely needed to practice to walk in these stilts...)
"I'm sure there's some wine in the mini bar, we could mix it if you want to.." Sherlock said as he reached for the glass, before holding it out for John to take it.
"Let's go back into the flat." Charlie suggested after a moment. "We can give you some ice for your nose and dad knows where we are anyway." "You two go inside, I'll look for John." Sherlock said and looked into the direction John had been running before. "And lock the doors." he said and picked up the rubiks cube on the ground with a frown, "Did she drop that?" he asked and Ron smiled a little, taking the toy, "No.. I kind of threw that against her head.. I actually meant to give it to Rosie. Good thing it didn't break." he said and Sherlock chuckled a little, "Well.. that's going to keep her busy for a couple of hours." he said and handed the cube over to Ron.
"Lonely." Sherlock said and smiled at his fiancé, "Next time you could join me." he added, wrapping his arm around John, "Wanna have a drink?" he asked with a smirk.
"Because he thought his dad and other certain family members called Beth wouldn't approve." Sherlock said and shrugged, "I suppose he was just scared of the fallout with his dad and... well he didn't want me to go through all that..." he said and smiled, "Okay.. I get it.. He probably won't leave me voluntarily.. you're quite.. good at this, mum..." he said and chuckled a bit.
"By the way, though.. about.. my meals.. is it okay if I just use mouthwash after blood? I mean.. I can hardly go and brush my teeth when we're out.. mouthwash would make that way easier." he said and shrugged lightly, "There's no pressure though, if you want me to brush my teeth, I'll brush my teeth."
"That's just impossible of your brother... I'll have a word with him about that." Violet said with a shake of head, though mainly just for Sherlock's sake, because this certainly wasn't on top of the list of things she wanted to talk to Mycroft about. "But back to John. Has there ever been a time when his actions made you feel like he'd leave you for someone?"
Sherlock smiled, "She's with Greg, I've been talking to Dorothy this morning." he said and handed her the top sheet of his stack of papers, "Rosie wrote her a letter, apparently." he said with a chuckle.
"You bet it would. I need some alone time with you.." John murmured and ran a hand through Sherlock's curls, before pulling him into a proper kiss now that it was finally just them in a room.
"Hm.." Richard hummed, nipping at his glass, "She told me about myself too sometimes in clearer moments when she just believed I was looking 'exactly like her husband'.." he said and smiled lightly. "I admit, I kind of liked the not so clear moments better.. when she really recognised me as who I was."
"Not happening." Sherlock said and chuckled, shaking his head, "You know what happened the last time." he said and smiled, "Ask again when you're turning 16." he added and thought about the other question, "But sure, yeah, I think they'd cook and bake for you."
Sherlock instinctively leant a bit into Clara, almost as if he was seeking protection as Harry walked over to the door and opened it up for her father, "Hey dad.." she said and bit her lip, "I think.. I think Sherlock needs another moment.." she mumbled and looked over to her brother in law, "Or.. maybe two." she added as she watched him still clutching the pillow and cuddled against her wife.
John took a glance inside himself, before doing as he was told (carefully of course). "So what do you think of the bees in winter?" He asked after giving Sherlock a smile.
John made a little disappointed noise, when Sherlock pulled away and nodded. "Yeah, I see your point. My jacket's over there then." He said, nodding towards the living room.
"Actually I think negligent disregard of safety is in a mad scientists job description." Sherlock said with a chuckle, not feeling too offended by that label, after all he did forget a dissolved brain in a plastic bag for a few decades in his flat. "Maybe we can do some experiments together, though." he said and rolled his eyes at the 'are you out of your mind?' look John gave him, "Not that kind of experiments. I just meant more advanced secondary things."
"Who's the other two?" Harry asked with a frown and looked over at her wife, "Oh, she means my brother and as it happens her best friend.." Sherlock said and smirked, "Clara do you want the pleasure of telling Harry about who exactly your former best friend is?" he asked and chuckled, remembering John's reaction to that particular information.
John smiled at that and kissed him back. "Yeah, you'd better." He said with a chuckle, as he pulled back to go into the living room. "They'll be here in forty minutes, so I'll just lay the table really quickly. I'm almost drawn to unstab the playing board for this, you know."
Sherlock smiled a little as he walked in, closing the door behind him, before he sat down, "It's about Charlie and Rosie.. I've had a talk with Charlie on the weekend about her parents and well, I really want to help her to make some memories and find out what they were like, long story short, we've decided to make a sort of memory book for both of them, her and Rosie and I was hoping you might have some informations about them, mainly addresses, their full names, in the best case also information about where they've been buried, I mean there's got to be something in their files."
"This is seriously such an awesome day" Charlie said through the curtain as she worked herself out of the dress.
"You know, that's really just their name." Vanessa told her daughter and picked her up. "There are catfish and sea horses too, but that's not because there are cats with scales and ponies that live underwater, honey. So when discoverers went to the sea and discovered at all the new animals there, they had to come up with names for them so we can talk about them." She explained. "So, if you've never seen a sea lion, they actually look a bit like lions with their fangs and whiskers."
Sherlock smiled, leaning back against John for a moment, "Well, if you want, you can cube some tomatoes and mix them with cubed from the can, angelo called it his 'secret'." he said, imitating Angelo's accent for the last word. "Although I wouldn't mind if you'd just stay like that, while I chop the vegetables." he said and turned his head, giving John a small smile instead of a kiss, because.. well, blood.
"Oh of course." Emma said and gave them a smile, "David's actually cooking for us." she said and chuckled, "Maybe you want to help him with that, Charlie? He's actually trying to make that pesto for you, but I think he's a little lost." she chuckled.
"That's cool though. I mean you seem to be pretty affable around other adults." Charlie commented. "I could almost explode next to some people." She said and shook her head. "Patience is a virtue. That's what Mrs. Hope always says."
"Thank you, sweethearts. I'd better go and make sure the other tables aren't starving now, so enjoy." Mrs. Turner said with a chuckle, before turning around to check if the other tables had food and extra blood by now. When she was gone John leaned over and chuckled a little, because he really found that a little strange. "Two years?"
Sherlock was already up (since he had had to get Rosie ready a little earlier than usual and wait with her at the door for Greg), so he was just making breakfast as she spotted Charlie creeping through the living room holding a plastic bag and.. was she wearing a new pyjama? He was pretty sure when they had left her alone in the living room last night she had had her light blue one on, now she was wearing a purple one. Weird. And she did look like she was sick too. All red faced and sweaty. "Are you alright?" he asked, walking over to her and immediately feeling her forehead to check if she had fever, which she luckily hadn't, but she sure looked like she was developing one. "Is that your other pyjama in that bag? Did you get sick tonight and had to change?" he asked, reaching out for the bag, "Let me get that, I'll just put it into the laundry and you go back to bed." he said with a frown, perhaps he should call John, she really didn't look good.
told me he's never been with anyone before.." Victor said, kicking the jacket off his bayonet and using his foot to slide the sword over to the haystack he had just lied on with William, before walking over to it and sitting down, keeping one foot on the blade, mainly so this stranger couldn't pick it up, but also so it was in reach. "I still don't know what to make of you, but I'm willing to listen." he said with a decisive nod. He didn't trust the man, but for some reason he didn't particularly distrust him either.
"I'm just glad you're alright." Sherlock said and frowned, "If it wasn't so humiliating for her, I'd probably go and get a muzzle for her."
"Hm.. so you can stare at whoever actor currently playing James Bond like you stared at the lasagne?" Sherlock asked teasingly and smirked.
Sherlock grinned, "Only with you as my first mate, though." he said and took another bite, "Also, I'd need a better name, another reason I can't be a pirate, apart from the fact that everything but a wooden ship would look ridiculous, I mean, come on, pirates on a speedboat, or a yacht, that just doesn't have style. But it's also that the good names are all taken.. Captain Holmes isn't bad, but.. it's not even in the same league as Black Beard and so on."
John clenched his fist, trying not to show how nerve-racking this was for him. He'd expected Victor to tell him out here, but his stomach dropped nevertheless. "Do you want me to tell you then?" He asked after clearing his throat.
"Well, I can ask him right now if you want." Sherlock said pulling his phone out of his pocket, before taking a sip of blood. "Want me to mail him and ask him if he wants to come over to catch up a bit? I think it would be easier to explain who you are and what's going on personally, really."
"Paps, is everything alright?" Charlie called after hearing nothing from downstairs for a while, before dashing down the stairs to see why they weren't coming upstairs already.
"Oh right that's your grandmother, isn't it?" Sherlock asked, sometimes forgetting that this had been John's first.
Charlie did as she was told without another word; she was absolutely through with breaking rules... "Thanks" She murmured and held the empty glass out to anyone who'd take it, before leaning back into John.
John rolled his eyes in good humour and Violet chuckled. "Yes, you should. Say goodbye, girls." "Bye Rosie, bye Charlie by Lock, bye John!!" Amy called happily and John and Rosie went out of the door, John having taking her lighter bag. "Goodbye!"
"Mmh, you're right. I had almost forgotten how he can be when it comes to morals. Same goes for mum apparently. And yeah, we should definitely tell her. The fact she's off the liquor might help her case as well. Oh, I hadn't told you about that, had I?"
"No, but I need you need to add the same amount of blood, so it's practically half and half.." Sherlock said and frowned, "But I can mix it up, you don't have to do that."
"Thank you.. I'll definitely take you up on that." Charlie said with a smile on her face, before asking. "You know, this does sound a lot like adoption, just quicker. I mean, you've promised to keep giving me pocket money, letting me celebrate my birthdays here, stay part of your family, pay my student loans,... I don't really get it."
"In that case they've already made up their minds." Dorothy said with a smile. "It's impressive how good her writing is at her age. I'm very glad to see that you get along so nicely."
"Mmh, I can see what you mean. But today it's just you and me. And if Sherlock tells us where the Christmas decorations are, then we can definitely start until supper's ready." John told her and glanced up at Sherlock with a smile.
"Then don't wear them, love. You being comfortable is more important than maybe impressing my dad with those." John turned around to face his boyfriend and glanced at the tags under his shirt.
John grinned at him. "Now you combing your hair; that's my biggest regret of the day right there." John joked as Sherlock fixed his hair a little, picking up his worn shirt from the ground to put it back on. "And your looks pretty great. I almost want to undress you again."
John grinned and rested his chin on Sherlock's shoulder the way they were lying, closing his eyes and breathing his boyfriend in. "Sounds perfect to me."
"Oh no, they're my fathers." Charlie said with a chuckle, still finding the idea of people confusing them for her brothers quite funny. "Bit young maybe but they're doing great." She said and gave Sherlock a smirk because of the 'young' part.
"Guess so." Sherlock said and smirked at John, "Are we going to make it a competition? Who gets there last pays the lube?" he asked with a grin.
"Yeah, that's true. Not everyone can rely on their Detective Inspector brother to bail them out" Scott nodded and gave Carl a wry smile.
"And you're really okay with having them over that often?" Sherlock asked and started to unbutton his shirt, slipping out of it to work on that blood stain Amy had given him. "They won't annoy you?" he asked as he walked into the kitchen.
"Come on, let's go then." Charlie said with a smile and waited for Rosie to follow her down the stairs.
Sherlock huffed a laugh at that, "He only kicked us out.. not a bad reaction at all.." he mumbled and really feared that he had lost all progress he'd made with being accepted by John's father.
His eyes were dripping with disgust and he stepped towards William and gripped the front of his. "Because you're what, a faggot?" He spat the last word. "Fucking hell, I won't tolerate any of your kind in my house." He turned around to shout for his wife, still holding firmly onto William's shirt so that he couldn't escape.
"I actually only say it to hear you say it." Sherlock joked and chuckled again, before he let go of John, starting to make a sandwich with 'ketchup' for Charlie, since she's only had a glass of blood for dinner.
"Ah, interesting.." Mycroft said, and wondered if they'd already met somewhere down the line. To make it not blatantly obvious he found Sherlock's colleague interesting, he added. "Is that the normal age for the teaching staff? Or what is the general demographic like?"
A few minutes later John arrived at their flat, glad to be done with Uni and any obligations relating to it. "Hey, love" He called with a smile as he got into the living room.
"Shush!" Sherlock said and shook his head, "Yeah I did.. he had been near a bomb and had his torso full of fragments, internal bleeding.. it really didn't look good, so.. I just.. acted on impulse." he said and shrugged, "I would have told you if I had known you're related.."
“What would you like?” John asked, putting careful pressure over Sherlock's cock as he rolled his wrist, giving in to the situation maybe too easily.
The way he said it left no doubt that Sherlock had played directly into his hand. Sherlock’s brow furrowed as his bravado dropped to mild confusion, “You didn’t have to trick me; I offered,” he reminded him, like this was still some sort of trap.
"Uh-huh." Rosie said dragging her gaze away from the man as she got out of the car and followed Charlie and Papa into the shop, while she looked into her wallet, frowning as she counted the coins and looked at the prices of the different foods, it didn't look like she had enough money to buy anything, not even an apple. But if she'd find something cheap and give the cashier all the money she had maybe they would allow her to pay the rest later.
"Emotional intelligence is basically how well you do with other people, being empathetic and understanding.. It's also about being aware of your own and particularly others' feelings and how to manage them." Sherlock explained and smiled. "I'm not too good at that, it's easier for me with people that are smart, or people I like, though."
"Mmh, I really like pizza with mushrooms and bell peppers. I don't know if there's an actual name for that though." John chuckled and lifted her up. "What about you?"
Clara laughed at that. "Oh dear, the good old times. Though I have to admit that I do prefer the modern times where a dying engine isn't half as tragic." She said and glanced at Harry for a moment. She'd definitely ask her what that had been about once they were back inside the car.
Lowell cracked a small smile as the blonde approached him, "Actually.." Lowell said and pushed his hands into his pockets, "I'm more interested in one of it's residents." he said and looked up at the house again, "You're living here with Sherlock Holmes, aren't you?"
John couldn't help smiling into the kiss and closed his eyes.. He'd really missed this today. Humming a bit, John cupped Sherlock's wet cheek stroked it gently with his thumb.
John was just cleaning up the kitchen table so that he and Jim had some space to learn. It was nice that they'd have the flat to themselves this morning; Sherlock was still at uni and the girls at the orphanage. A few minutes later his colleague fellow student arrived and they went into the kitchen. "Now your flat is... interesting." He said and looked around a bit. "So how's family life, Dad?" Jim teased him with a chuckle and sat down at the kitchen table. John rolled his eyes a bit at that and chuckled as well. "Yeah, the style doesn't get boring too quickly. And it's great, really. Exhausting, but very rewarding, you know?" "Yeah, sounds a bit like medicine actually." He laughed. "Anyway, let's get started, shall we? We have to be done in time for you to be able to make lunch for the kids." Jim said with a smirk.
"Yes, you could really say that actually." John said with a nod.. "I mean, it's good that there are some regulations. Like that we're only allowed to marry other adults who really want to marry us too. But apart from that, a lot of laws have been designed to be mean to certain groups of people." He explained to her. "But thankfully they're slowly being changed."
"I'm not sleepin'.." Rosie slurred, with her eyes half opened, while her head was still resting against Sherlock's shoulder, "No. No, we know you're not." he said and chuckled softly, holding her with both arms so he'd have a firmer grip on her on the stairs, "Can you take Rosie's suitcase too? If not, I can get it once I've brought her upstairs." he said, looking at Charlie.
"Oh, have you got a cough, sweetheart?" John asked with a soft frown as he walked over to their daughter and crouched down in front of her. "Do you remember when you started feeling ill?" He asked her and held the back of his hand to her forehead. "Sherlock, could you go and get a thermometer, please?"
Mrs. Turner's eyes widened a bit at that. "Oh, really? I had no idea.. I should exchange recipes with her some time." She said with a laugh, shaking her head. "You too, John?" John shook his head. "Oh no, I'm an, erm, allergic."
Rosie smiled, "Yeah! It is special!" she said and snickered, "And Sally won't like that at all because she's a hombophob! That makes it even more amazing!" she said with a grin.
Sherlock chuckled at that, "Yeah she is, you know I didn't even need to tell her to make that power point. I mean, I did, but she had already made it." he said with a roll of his eyes, "I'm becoming predictable."
Following her sister, Charlie made her way down the stairs, clinging to the railing; mental not: make sure to practise stairs more. "So what do you think Rosie?" She asked on their way downstairs.
"Well, yes." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "But who knows, maybe she runs into another vampire boy at some point, at least with Lowell we know that he knows that I can actually kill him if he dares to hurt her. Another vampire boy might not know that, since he wouldn't know we're all vampires as well."
“You just said you're a watermelon with bad grammar." Sherlock said and laughed, "You're more of a hedgehog though." he said and smiled, kissing John's cheek.
"Yeah, sure. He seems nice enough." Charlie said with a smile. "Scout's invited too, though, right? If so we should get him some dinner as well."
John smiled at that and put the fresh shirt back inside the wardrobe in favour of covering Sherlock's arms on his middle with his own. "Yeah, I don't have too many secular possessions I guess. And I do prefer the sofa in our flat too, all things considered, but that doesn't mean that it's already shabby." John defended with a chuckle. "Anyway, as much as I love you draped over me, I need to pick something to wear."
"Mmh, fair enough." John said and watched Sherlock from his side. "Do you have any idea how we're going to tell the others. I mean, I'd love to just send a text, but that seems wrong."
"So.. how do you want to do it?" Sherlock asked and smiled at John, "Cotton bud or should I just .. well.. lick your finger.. that sounds naughtier than it is.." he said and laughed softly as he sat down next to John and carefully removed the plaster from John's finger. "Ah, it doesn't bleed any more.. I actually don't think you'll feel much of a high at this point.. it'll heal faster than it's got time to spread.." he said and gave a shrug, "I don't think you'll feel anything, actually. Perhaps a small itch.. like the normal itch you sometimes have when something heals."
"Yes, you're very right with that." Vanessa smiled and went over to the hive to lift the lid. "So, there we go." She said and opened the hive slowly. Amy was stunned as she peeked into it with wide eyes. "They're really /cuddling/!" Amy squealed after a moment and giggled into Sherlock's shoulder. "Are they a family?" She asked Sherlock with a smile.
"Cool!" Rosie said and smiled, taking Charlie's hand and yawning a little, rubbing her eyes with her free hand, she had had trouble sleeping that night because she was so excited about today!
"So you can get my background information and use that against me?" She asked with a huff and shook her head. "I'm not an idiot." John gave a small sigh (yeah, he was not going to argue with her tonight; Sherlock could do that if he had the nerve) and walked back to her. "Hi not an idiot, I'm John." He said mildly and crouched down next to her, checking her pockets for any weapons before thinking of untying her. The girl couldn't help rolling her eyes at that, but tensed up again when he checked her coat and jeans pockets.
John gave him a slight smile from on the carpet. "They're my cousins Amy and Ally. Aunt Vanessa brought them over a few minutes ago be cause she had an emergency at work. She's Amber's stepmum. They'll be with us for a couple of hours." He explained, before turning to the girls. "And this is my boyfriend, Sherlock.”
"I'd love to." John said and crouched down in front of the dog who looked up at him with a curious expression, as if he was surprised another human had appeared. "Would you like to introduce us?" He asked his daughter with a smile, holding his hand out for the dog so he could already smell him and come closer.
Once Charlie was finally up there, she was pleased to find that she really had a great angle from up here. Those pictures would turn out great as long as she didn't smash her camera. Though, she didn't *just* look at the street, now that she had the chance to peer into that backyard. Oh, there was this cute guy she'd seen out on the streets a few times. He had a cool look from what she could tell, but she had no idea he was an artist. Curiously, she lay down on her stomach and looked at the sketchbook (no that she was lying on top of his fence with a camera anyway, she could just embrace the weirdness probably) Though, she blushed when she recognised the portrait he was working on. "Sweet drawing skills" She commented casually, though her heart was beating out of her chest. He'd thought /she/ was worthy of being drawn?
John frowned for a moment, before smirking as well when he understood. "I mean, that's.. still physiology in a way."
Sherlock smiled, now letting go of John himself, "Alright then.." he said and stood up, holding out his hand for John, "Come on, lets get it over with.. the sooner we get into the shower, the sooner we're back in bed again."
Shaking this John's hand, he smiled a little, "Uhm.. nice to meet you... Sir..." he said, it did feel somewhat strange to think of someone just a few years older than him to be the father of one of his friends.
Sherlock couldn't help but smile at his daughter, he wasn't even sure if she had really noticed what she said, but he had, looking up with a 'did she really just say that?' look, he glanced up a his fiancé.
"You sure?" Sherlock asked and frowned, "You don't have to start working there for me, you know.. I just figured you'd like to pick up rugby again, that's why I suggested it." he said, resting his forehead against John's.
"No.. I'm not sure I.." Sherlock said and was cut off by John in his mind again, "Sherlock, calm down, it's all good, I've got you.." it almost was like he could feel John's arms around him, holding him and well.. having his back, just like he said. "I.. I'd like to see him.." he said with a steadier voice, nodding to emphasize his point and possibly also to convince himself of it.
"Pff and you call me horny.." Sherlock said with a laugh, before letting go of John to go for the mouthwash.
"Hey, stand up, would you?" William asked quietly, looking around, but luckily no one of the staff had seen that, "That's not exactly helping with the keeping it secret part." he said and held out his hand to help him up. Though really in what state must he been kept that so little of his saliva had that kind of an effect on him, a well fed and healthy person would never have collapsed like that.
"He's actually the head of the British government.. so I'm not sure how to answer that." Sherlock said with a chuckle, sitting down next to his mother and leaning a bit into her, "He's still pretty much like he used to be, cock sure, strait-laced and the Pinkest of the Pinks." he said and chuckled.
"Of course, Rosie. We'd love to show you." John told her with a smile. "Well, only if you want that of course." Amy leaned over to her new friend to (practically stage-)whisper. "They're living together, because they're *boyfriends* now." She giggled at the last part, finding John's relationships still kinda exciting.
"Oh, yeah, okay you have a point there, although for me that was all included in consent," Sherlock said and sighed, "I mean in the end your consent there is never valid, if it's forced as payment or one of you lied about being healthy."
"She's a sweetheart. I can't wait to have that name either." John said with a smile, before glancing at the minibar. "Could I maybe still have that glass of blood though?" He asked, before a chat bubble popped up.
Violet smiled at that. "Well, I'm glad there was someone to stand in for me." It still hurt her immensely that she'd missed out on the vast majority of her boy's lives. She hoped there'd been someone else in Mycroft's life as well. "I think I'll stop by her flat on my way back."
Leading the way, Jane quickly walked outside while Sherlock and Charlie followed, "Alright then, what is so unbelievable?" she asked, once they were far enough away from the house to not be overheard, heading for a small path leading into the forest. "Well.." Sherlock began and wasn't sure how to put it exactly, "I'll just be blunt about this.. I'm not the Sherlock you know in this era." he said and frowned along with Jane, because that just sounded wrong, "I mean, I am.. in a way. But.. alright, in short, my fiancé, John and our two vampire daughters, Charlie and Rosie stumbled through some kind of.. I don't know, it might be some sort of portal, whatever it was, we happened to walk through it in the year 2017, Jane. 2017. And all of a sudden we woke up in my old room in .. I don't even know what year we have." he said and Jane looked for a long moment at him with an expression that made Sherlock wonder if it really was a good idea to tell her, but then her expression changed to a little smile, "I knew there was something different about you..." she said and looked at him more closely, "You seem.. more grow up.." she said and for some reason found herself believing her friend. If it was anyone else, she'd have considered them insane, but she had known him ever since the both of them were born, she knew when he was lying and she knew when he was telling the truth. And right now, he was telling the truth. "So you were right? It will be possible for people of the same sex to get married?" she asked and Sherlock sighed in relief, realising she believed him, "Yeah, it only took humanity more than 2000 years to get that far.." he said, rolling his eyes.
Janine cleared her throat, clearly uncomfortable. "We did release them into the nearby forest, but after maybe three vampires had fed on someone, that person probably had a tough way home."
John took the glass and drank a sip, as Fay broke her pokerface to look at the tall one half-confused and half-suspicious. "In exchange for what?"
"They are." John said with a chuckle as he poured two more glasses for the girls. "And we're still taking all of Charlie's friends shopping, don't forget that."
"Maybe give her a change of clothes too.." Sherlock said and frowned little as he stood up, "She's kind of short.. do you think one of Charlie's larger pyjamas would fit her?"
"Thanks, love." John said, rolling his eyes and resting a gentle hand on Amy's shoulder. It really was a shame though that he couldn't kiss Sherlock properly with their family though. "Something funny, Ally?" He asked with a warm chuckle. Meanwhile Amy giggled and had began to dribble onto the blood stain on Sherlock's shoulder.
John rolled his eyes at that. "Yeah, I think I'll manage." He wasn't exactly happy with his boyfriend seeing his sister half-naked, but it was probably out of proportion to protest. He didn't know Clara very well, but with Harry and Sherlock he obviously knew for a fact there was nothing to worry about. "I'll just show John some make-up tips to pass the time while you're gone." Clara suggested with a laugh.
"Yeah, well, he wanted to show me a few songs on it, so we went outside for a moment." Charlie admitted after a moment, since that was the part she'd actually been worried about. "And yeah, he showed me that one song he knows, I showed him that one song I know, erm, we kissed, and then Jane and I went back here." She summarised the last part quickly; he'd never told her not to kiss boys, but something told her he still wouldn't like it.
"Mmh, you're a surprisingly good kisser so you'll have to find out at the end the weekend." John said and gave Sherlock a chuckle, running his thumb over his fiancé's temple.
"You're panicking a bit too much, though.." Sherlock said and frowned at him, "And... well at least I haven't met any vampire that got insane." he said and shrugged, "Although.. we all are a bit, I guess." he said with a small laugh. "And what you don't know about the blood I have is that we get the blood that's one or two days away from the end of their shelf life. It's fine since we freeze it anyway."
Sherlock smiled at that and took John's hand, before starting to walk to the bedroom with him.
"That I am." John said with a smile, before chuckling as well and shaking his head a little. "I love you ridiculously much, you know that?"
Sherlock hummed a chuckle, "Just shut up and kiss me." he said with a roll of his eyes, smirking at John.
Sherlock smiled, "She'll be glad, I think. I did have the feeling she was worried about your.. well.. mortality too." he said and shrugged, "Even if she didn't say so. You could tell your parents again that they also have that option if they want to, you know."
"Me too." Sherlock said and put the small bag with medical equipment he had bought on the way back to the hotel on the bed, frowning at it, "Are you still sure?" he asked, taking off his coat and sitting down on the bed.
John nodded again. Quite thrown off by that, he didn't know what to say next, but didn't dare to ring off. It was quiet for a while, except for the faint sound of footsteps.
"I'm already looking forward to that." Clara said with a smile to Harry and wrapped her arm around her middle. John rolled his eyes at the first part of what Sherlock had said, but kept his arm around Sherlock. "But it's your lucky day, because apparently we're not going to end up fighting over a game after all." He told the women with a chuckle.
David gave his wife a look and went inside. "Too stressful to send a text?" He asked dryly as he went up the stairs with Emma. This was the first time he got to see the flat John was now living in and he was already surprised by the interior of the hallway; well, at least they weren't raising children in a loft or some skyscraper. Meanwhile Charlie noticed a bit disappointedly that there were two heavy (well, in comparison with Lowell) people coming upstairs. "It's two people." She told Rosie and went curiously towards the living room to watch who might enter.
"Okay, I'm fine completely fine with those. You know, we just don't need Child Protective Services to show up in front of our doorstep within the first week." John said, visibly glad Sherlock hadn't wanted to dissolve a hand together with the girls in the bathroom sink. "What stuff do you usually do?" Charlie asked after a moment. "Must be interesting the way John looks." She teased John with a chuckle.
"Aww... That is really sweet." Janine smiled and glanced at his ring too. "Seriously, when I hear about your relationship it sounds like straight out of a Disney film." She chuckled.
John nodded and gave Sherlock a quick sort of smile. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just got a bit surprised there." He said, wincing a bit as he got to his feet. "I wouldn't have thought she'd bite, but you're always smarter in hindsight." He commented as Fay watched them from the side.
Greg listened with growing abhorrence to what Sherlock was telling him about this network theory... He could still remember almost every single child that had got adopted the past few decades... Obviously he was going to help them if his experience could come in handy. Soon afterwards they went upstairs, since Charlie had already had over fifteen minutes to herself at this point. Though in her mind barely three had passed. She was sitting on the floor, surrounded by dusty clothes and books, currently reading the end of her mum's first diary.
"I'd rather tell them once I've actually turned, you know?" John said and sighed... if it hadn't been for the ongoing twilight, John would've thought they were standing in front of a painting rather than a window. "We could video chat or something." He suggested.
Sherlock chuckled at the hug, "We're becoming true hugging Watsons after all." he said and smirked, "Or well.. Berkeleys in your case." he said with a laugh. "But I think the hugging comes from both sides."
"Well that situation is a tad different." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "I admit it is a huge age difference, yes, but John and I are both adults, you're 13. Now even smaller age differences still matter."
""Of course I mean the fact that you joined the military." Emma said and rolled her eyes, "Now my biggest worry isn't that you'll get shot and die.. it's that you get shot and don't die, but end up as a lab rat when they find out you're healing too fast. But at least then you're still alive, so.. fear B definitely trumps fear A."
"Wait I have to think of a wish." Rosie said and frowned for a moment, before smiling, she would wish that she can stay with Lock and John and Charlie forever. That was a good wish. "I've got something!" she said and smiled, leaning over to the candles a little and starting to blow them out, but it really took a lot of blowing, but then all the candles were out and she grinned happily.
"That's why I was wondering." Violet said with a chuckle, before going on. "You can do this. Just stick to the list and be there for her, that's more than enough. Have you got any other questions?"
Sherlock smiled, "So am I." he said and chuckled again, nipping at his glass. "And I hope he won't be too mad at Richard.." he said and sighed.
John chuckled and gave his boyfriend a look that said 'yup, they're two. Don't ask me.'. He then said. "Now, I know who's who and I can tell Sherlock that Amy just told him the truth."
"Well, I've had my time with him." Victor said and frowned, "Or will have." he said and shook his head, this was just so confusing. "And I can see how much he loves you. It annoys me a little, but that's jealousy. Even I can tell. God of course I'm jealous. But I suppose you understand it, at least the way you looked when you came back from seeing William tells me you do. Did you think I didn't notice the way you gritted your teeth when you told me he said you should tell me he loves me?" he asked with a half smile.
Grateful Sherlock had given her some time, Charlie'd been able to collect herself and cleared her throat when she heard them coming. "Hey, champ. You're career as a writer is going well then?" She asked her with a chuckle, having listened in on what Rosie'd been saying.
"Come on, I don't want to think about science right now." John chuckled, before reaching out and running his fingers a little clumsily through Sherlock's curls. "Seriously though, I'm glad the bite marks heal that quickly." He commented, not sure how he'd otherwise explain those to people.
"Hello, you're probably the doctor then?" William asked and looked up at the man that just entered the room.
"Looock," Rosie began and tugged at Sherlock's hand, "Can you help me change into normal clothes before dinner, I don't want to get tomato juice on my tutu," she said and Sherlock nodded, "Sure, bumblebee," he said and Rosie chuckled a little, "Can we I fly up the stairs again? Like a bee!" she asked and Sherlock laughed, "Sure, come here.." he said, crouching down to pick the little one up, before standing again and holding her up, while she spread her arms, wiggling her feet, "Come on, let's go!" she chirped and Sherlock looked at David, "Actually, David, I've got a bee-shaped ceiling lamp for Rosie, but it keeps flickering, could come upstairs with us and take a look at it?" he asked while Rosie starting to make buzzing noises.
"Oh, good job thinking of that. I'd almost forgotten about that." John told her with a smile. "And it's still really sweet that you wanted to surprise us with cake." He added and Charlie grinned. "Yeah, that's an awesome breakfast. Thanks for thinking about us."
"Alright. Good. That's good." Violet said and sighed, figuring they weren't going anywhere since John didn't move, "Look, it's not what you think... She's growing.. I've turned her right after she was born, Paul diagnosed that something was wrong with her heart and she wasn't breathing properly either. I've seen kids like that.. I'm actually working with an orphanage that's only taking in those kids .. they grow. They aren't stuck. They grow until the fully grown and only then, they stop, they'll stay young adults forever.." she explained and Sherlock frowned, "Hang on... There's an orphanage with vampire children?" he asked and Violet nodded, "Yeah.."
"Have I been her dad for long enough for that to apply? Oh, thanks, love." John said with a chuckle and took the blood. "I can actually still remember when she started calling me dad." He commented with a smile.
John nodded slowly at that; he did come after his gran after all. It was reassuring, though, to know that his fears weren't completely unfounded and that he wasn't the first to consider that. "Yes, that's what I've been thinking about as well." He noticed the way Sherlock played with his food and rested his hand subtly on his boyfriend's thigh. "Do you think it was the right choice?"
John nodded slowly at that, letting it sink in for a moment, before then asking Sherlock. "Are you still in contact with him like with Jane?" He had still known his gran and she had sometimes talked about him. If there was a chance for John to find him, he needed to know.
“Holmes,” he calls to the bathroom where he knows the man to be, “what the hell are these?” he asks as he lifts the first one off of the pile to inspect it. It appears to be an official release TV show, with their pictures on the front and back.
“I know,” Holmes admits with a smile as the battle with the Golem rages on the screen before them. The Golem gets away.
Sherlock and John get ready to head to Moriarty’s trial where Sherlock is the chief witness. They don’t speak until right before heading to the street and the waiting police car. John leads Sherlock through the paparazzi like a bodyguard.
thinks it’s one day earlier than it really is.”
A brief description of bullying here. Poor Sherlock, but at least he has John now.
Watson closes his eyes as Sherlock lowers the gun to the vest. He hears the music change from its frantic repetitive rhythm to the end-credit theme song, but still refuses to open his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re going to sleep four nights in a row?” He asks with a skeptical eyebrow raised, as this would be an unprecedented event.
“Just give them to me,” Mycroft reiterates instead of confirming or denying.
He stands from the bed and goes over to a box that appears to be chaotically filled with journals. Some he recognizes from next to experiments on the kitchen table, some from the pockets of his Belstaff, but one in particular draws his eye. It’s a small, compact journal made of a scarlet faux-suede. It’s hideous. He picks it up with reverence, his head swimming slightly at the wrongness of invading Sherlock’s privacy.
best if we stop it there,” he agrees half-heartedly.
“I expect that you’re correct,” he admits.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow in consideration, “What type of drinking game?”
John's face takes on a resigned look that clearly states that he should have seen that coming.
There are more experiences for them to go through together (at least that's the plan!), so stay subscribed or start subscribing if you'd like to keep following along with us!
I have to think back to actually remember it, but when I do I grow a bit nervous wondering if you’re alright, “You had a nightmare,” I say, eyes scanning you for signs of distress.
Back in the train car, the bomb still hasn’t detonated.
Once the aftershocks subsided, John gracelessly collapsed the short distance onto Sherlock’s body.
John almost choked on his drink and then closed his eyes, his head falling back onto the headrest of his chair, “Why?” He asked in a resigned tone.
The longer the scene goes on with the Chinese, the more they disassociate with Sherlock and John.
Sherlock knows he has a point, but he needs to find an exciting case.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I do,” John nodded, cupping Sherlock's cheek, “but it would still mean a lot to hear it. I'm not going to push; we have all the time in the world but I just thought tha --”
“You don’t always have to ruin peoples relationships, you know that, don’t you?” Watson accuses Holmes lightly as Sherlock and John watch Mrs. Hudson confront the Speedy’s cook.
Holmes is taken back by this realization. He had had no idea.
John had looked at Lestrade, huffed, and then turned back to Sherlock, “Are you serious? It's obvious what he's doing.”
“For god’s sake...” John moaned, letting his head fall backwards with a thump, “Right. Keep looking forward and don’t even
“I could have continued the fellatio a little longer. I feel I was too assertive on the approach,” Sherlock said clinically, “but I expect we will do that again soon?”
John closed his eyes and breathed deep, concentrating on not wringing the other man’s enticing neck, “Just, try putting your hand in your pants and touching it skin to skin,” he offered as nonchalantly as he could manage.
“Yes. There will be coffee and eggs on the table in ten minutes. Make sure you're ready,” John threatened as he left the room, leaving the bedroom door open spitefully as he clicked on the radio in the kitchen, knowing how much Sherlock hated the music on the station which John preferred whilst he was cleaning or cooking.
Sherlock’s eyes light up in interest, wracking his brain, “Oooh, this is fun now,” he says with glee before launching into a tirade of multiple examples of public shaming having a positive effect.
Back in town, Sherlock stumbles upon John in the cemetery and asks him about the Morse code, but John walks away, seemingly not yet ready to forgive him for his outburst last night. He keeps walking away as Sherlock enquires about his meeting with Mortimer – to no avail – before physically stopping John to explain what happened last night. He apologizes about the friend comment, admits that John is his only friend.
So when John wakes up just a few hours after falling asleep - panting and sweating as his heart races and the sounds of shots and screams fade away in his ears - to find Sherlock kneeling next to his bed, he’s not entirely surprised. Sherlock knows better than to touch him, but his right hand is incredibly close to his left shoulder, their left hands centimeters from each other as Sherlock’s concerned gaze takes in every detail of John’s face.
In the bathroom, David corners John as they’re both mid-piss, “Sorry about that, mate. You know how Zach gets.”
“John!” Sherlock sounds like the most scandalized person in the entire world.
“Would you like me to woo you?” He asked quietly at the corner of his jaw before placing a light kiss there.
Sherlock and John are driving through the countryside, Sherlock behind the wheel.
“Yeah, I’d rather let you have your own cigarette than witness that,” Watson says, “it’s just sad.”
Most of their stay overs for cases have been in separate rooms, their last shared room being for the Baskerville case, and Sherlock
the action says.
“You...you don’t…” John stutters and then clears his throat again, “Don’t
“Hi, I’m Angela,” the pretty, young blonde girl introduces herself with a stunning smile and an outstretched hand.
Watson stares at the side of his face in shock for a few moments longer before he’s drawn back to the telly himself.
“What behavior?” John asks, honestly confused.
“I appreciate you having restrained yourself from doing so; I was still recovering from my injuries while away.”
“Curiosity. And to improve the love potion.”
“I think we have established that Sherlock and John are just different enough to not be us. Their dimension is not the same as ours and thus their reactions are not our reactions.”
Next scene, Sherlock (and John) are being thanked by a family who has been reunited because of their hard work. Sherlock is given a tie pin, though he doesn’t wear ties. John shushes him again.
John knows he has a valid point, but the bed isn’t really suitable for two people to share it, at least not without cuddling, and he’s not certain that’s the best idea at the moment.
Mycroft and John talk about Kitty’s article written off of testimony given by Richard Brook, a name neither has heard before. Then Mycroft pulls out a few files with information on international assassins that have moved in surprisingly close to 221B. He asks John to keep an eye on Sherlock for him, because who else could have placed these killers so close but Moriarty? And besides, Sherlock won’t accept help from his older brother and John is already doing such a good job of it.
Anderson blushes slightly, “I knew you weren’t dead,” he claims, but Holmes merely raises a disbelieving eyebrow and he amends, “Well, I
“Erection. Stiffy. Hard-On,” Sherlock griped, “Whatever you insist on calling it. I don’t care but...help me? I’m not sure I can do it alone…” he admitted quietly.
Dr. Stapleton tries to access the information about H.O.U.N.D., but her clearance isn’t high enough, so Sherlock deduces Major Barrymore’s password to get it. They discover that Dr. Frankland was in the original project group that was attempting to use a gas to effect its victims with fear and stimulus, so they would be more easily suggestible. Sherlock calls him to arrange a meeting at the same time Dr. Mortimer calls John to tell him of Henry’s attempt to shoot her (on accident). Sherlock calls Greg and demands that he meet them in Dewer’s Hollow…with a gun.
Sherlock takes a step back to place some more distance between them when his calculating eyes quickly take in the scenario: Mary is furious but focused, she’s holding a gun tightly in her right hand with the safety on, and her eyes are fixed on him.
“I don’t dislike sex,” Sherlock blurts suddenly, blushing slightly after he says it.
plays our coin,” Bill interrupts their conversation as he helps Zach with the drinks, “so I didn’t think twice about the rank,” he continues before placing the glass of scotch in front of Sherlock, “Your beverage, my lord.”
“John is going to punch Sherlock again,” he says in a tone which implies that he supports the decision after seeing John’s reaction to the realization.
Sherlock had never loved him as much as he did in that moment.
Watson makes an uneasy sound in the back of his throat, ending the conversation.
to wake John again, “We’ll need to experiment further.”
“You’ve never given me cause to,” Watson replies easily.
John smiled warmly, head falling to Sherlock’s neck where he couldn’t help but chuckle lightly.
Sherlock is slowly pulled out of his Mind Palace by the feeling of something repeatedly rubbing one point on his right hand.
“Helping with science?” John laughed, lifting an eyebrow, “That is the shittest excuse I’ve ever heard.”
rabbit? What a ridiculous notion; I definitely wouldn’t have taken that case had it come across our desk.”
“Joooohn!” Sherlock whined with a pout he’d never admit to.
“Gregory, dear,” Sherlock’s mum replied, “Gregory Lestat.”
Sherlock pulled John’s head back down again, but aimed his lips towards John’s right ear, “Then get on with it,” he whispered before gently biting the earlobe.
When their wine has arrived, Sherlock finally strides in to the restaurant with purpose. He ignores the confused looks from the other patrons, eyes fixed solely on John and that woman.
As Sherlock stood from the bed, he grumbled a facetious, “Chivalry really
Holmes sighs sadly while shaking his head, “You know what Mycroft would say, and I fear that he’s right. We can’t go messing with another timeline.”
“Mycroft, you don’t understand, I can’t just…”
Cut to news reporters outside of the court house. Inside, Moriarty asks a female officer to reach a piece of gum in his pocket for him.
When Sherlock realizes the position they’re in, he scoots back just enough to look at John’s face. His breath catches as his eyes portray his concern.
“No, it’s your sympathetic doctor tone, and it’s completely unwarranted.”
John, seemingly giving the middle finger as he puts his glove on to examine the undescended testicle of a patient.
Magnussen pees in their fireplace, refusing to work with the genius. He leaves the flat and Sherlock goes in to a bout of deductions about how the letters must be here in London, then leaves to do some shopping.
“No, I am, but yours has bigger pockets,” he says as he makes an exaggerated gesture of placing his own wallet in Sherlock’s left pocket.
Watson rolls his eyes playfully, “Can’t just compliment a bloke, can you?”
Maybe it’s a mixture of both.
“Got us where we were going right quick, as well.”
. And then you came in and showered and went to bed so I thought perhaps you had changed your mind.”
Conversely, one of the first things Holmes had done on their way to the scene was to contact his brother and get the ball in motion.
But in a time when any man or woman with some sense left into them would be fast asleep with their mind set on tomorrow, the cottage was curiously restless. Before the open front door stood the figure of a man. The light coming from the kitchen behind him flowed out into the darkness, haloing his slippered silhouette. He squinted at the night and huffed.
“Ah, Miss Melanie, good morning to you.”
And despite the adrenaline fueled haze that screamed at him to protect a pair of particularly scrawny ankles from a particularly venomous pair of fangs, Watson felt a thin beam of reason cut through the fog.
"Well," he whispered as Holmes took hold of his arm, "I believe we've found our culprit. Young Melanie will be proud to know her theory was correct."
“Does the sun shine differently over here than where my house is? Nah, they’ve had plenty of sunlight, alright.”
“I need you to knock on Doctor Walters’ door and refuse to leave unless he agrees to come with you. Drag him out of his bed if you have to. Tell him that one of his African snakes has escaped.”
“Or a tiger!”
“I believe I did, though I’m afraid I couldn’t tell you the exact time I lost consciousness.” I brushed the duvet between my index and thumb. “Thank you, by the way.”
“Huh,” she said, inspecting the black automobile resting in their front garden, “that was not here before.”
“It is my joy and privilege to make you flush as many times as my heart desires. Come now, no more climbing on ladders for you today, old boy. It would be such a pity for you to break your neck now, of all times.”
“Excuse me, miss,” he had said, to her great disappointment, with a pristine English accent, “but I noticed you seem to have started a small business in deliveries and I was wondering if I may join your list of clients.”
“Sherlock, for Heaven’s sake, have you any idea what time it is?”
Only after he had taken a drag and breathed out a fine cloud of smoke that wrapped its winding tendrils around his form did he finally turn his attention to me.
Holmes regarded him as if he were mad, passed a hand over his brow and nodded at him to continue.
“Ah, splendid! Here you are,” said Mr Holmes. “Watson, this is miss Melanie. Miss Melanie, may I introduce you to my very dear and lifelong friend: Doctor John Watson.”
That seemed to strike the stranger dumb. His eyebrows gave a funny jerk, and he raised a hand to pick at his moustache.
Sitting on a stool against the entrance of the coop was the good doctor, the tilt of his shoulders carrying a proud sense of duty as he guarded his feathered protégées. He held his old reinforced cane before him, his hands joint and resting at the handle. Knowing it to be unlikely for reason to reach him once his protective instincts have been raised, Holmes rubbed at his eyes and lowered himself to sit at Watson’s feet. He rested his cheek against his knee and smiled as Watson harrumphed.
“Judging by the length of that shadow to your right, I should say barely past five.”
But Holmes only tutted, ignoring my outstretched hand and regarding me with a stern expression. “My dear Watson, this
Mr Holmes dropped some coins into her outstretched palm. “Melanie here is something of a deliveryman for the local population. She is a blessing for weak knees.” He rubbed his hands together with a pensive expression, “About that, dear girl, I wanted to discuss a slight change in our little agreement.”
“Oh, spare me the white lies, Holmes,” Watson grimaced, “I know I shouldn’t have bothered.”
trifled with. But if said Londoner had one day decided to abandon his career in criminology and move to the country, spending the better part of a decade studying these fascinating creatures, he would have learned that in the buzzing of a bee can also lay a simple "Hello!" or "There's food over there!" and much more, and how to distinguish these different meanings.
“No, I—” Watson squirmed in his seat, “I was rather thinking of keeping it.”
She couldn’t steal a glance at the doctor's expression, for he nodded and quickly ducked away heading back into the house, but she imagined the sentiment was appreciated.
“Then it has to be a predator,” Melanie insisted. “Could be a fox or a badger. Or maybe an opossum, or a skunk!”
Watson laughed, “Nonsense, you’ll find no tigers in England. I’ve had to confront a tiger before, and I can assure you they will do anything to keep away from humans if they have the chance. And it still doesn’t explain the lack of footprints.”
With a start, both men scrambled to their feet. From the depth of the coop, an enormous serpent moved, its twisting body as silent as smoke and its sleek scales glimmering whenever they caught the moonlight. The thin tongue flicked out from time to time, tasting the air.
"There! I'm glad we're feeling more reasonable."
“Don’t you worry, doctor. It’s only been a few days. I bet they just need more time to get used to the place ‘n’ stuff.”
Watson straightened his back and shot Holmes a half-hearted glare. “As a matter of fact, it happens that I do.”
“Hm?”
“You are doing no such thing. Do you wish to terrorise everyone down at the village? Besides, something doesn’t fit here—”
Watson finally cracked one eye open to peer at him, his gaze dark and unfocused under lids heavy with sleep.
Mr Smith’s package! As if it drove all the way there on its own. What rubbish. If Mr Smith wanted his package so badly, he could very well meet her halfway.
"That is alright with me, but I still have every intention of joining you. It is, and I say this in all honesty, a splendid evening." Holmes yawned, "I only wish half the stake outs in our career had been this pleasant."
“How do you do, Miss Melanie.”
Melanie grinned back.
Holmes counted the golden freckles dusting his nose.
“Wait a second,“ she said, stopping dead in her tracks, “
“Melanie,” Watson said, putting a hand on her shoulder “have you, by chance, had a close encounter with one of Doctor Walters’ dogs?”
Watson squeezed his fingers between his and smiled, “I know, dear, I apologise. Back when I was a boy I’d get so awfully attached, I cared for them like pets. I always hoped I could bring them inside one day, but I should have asked first.”
Mr Holmes laughed, “No offence taken, madam. I used to be just as blunt when I was her age.”
“How much should we pay for your services?”
“No idea. My guess is on Victoria.”
“Darling,” Holmes said softly, taking his hand “I’m glad you’re enjoying your new hobby, and I won’t complain if you want to let the hens into the house now and then, but I must draw the line at bringing them into our bedroom.”
“Watson? Watson, I’m back! I do apologise, I didn’t mean to be so late, but Mr Richardson called me and it seems that something bothered the hive up west because it swarmed away overnight. I didn’t notice any sign of overcrowding as of late, which is strange. I dare say, the queen cells I found looked perfectly ordinary, there was nothing indicating a swarm! Perhaps some wild animal. I wasted a good hour trying to get it back to safety, Richardson told me to set up some traps last month. Can you believe it, the poor girls went as far as the coast! Thank goodness they didn’t swarm later in the year or I doubt they would have survived for long, but everything is quite alright now.”
In the following days, which turned into following weeks and, later still, following months, it seemed that Doctor Watson had accepted Mr Holmes’ hospitality.
“As far as I know there have been no blood feuds, but even if there had,” he reasoned, “I don’t understand why they would
For as far as she pushed her memory to go (which wasn’t much, considering her own age had only just recently reached a two-digit number), there had always been someone in the cottage. She found it hard to imagine it empty and collecting dust. Despite what she’d been told by her older sister and her mother and pretty much anyone that had, as a result, lived in a time when it was indeed the reality, the thought just didn’t feel right.
Holmes was looking at his work of the past hour, his head tilted an imperceptible inch to the right. “Pardon my asking, dear, but what exactly were you trying to achieve?”
“What are you laughing about, now?”
The chicken was right by his feet, peering curiously at the hive. Its clucking ceased as a group of guard bees flew towards it, a tone of warning in their buzz. The bird stared.
“Dundee cake. It is also very fresh,” answered Doctor Watson, “and
Her smile froze when she was answered by a stranger.
“Melanie? But the girl wasn’t supposed to come with our supplies until Friday.”
"I beg your pardon!" Holmes exclaimed, indignated. "What the deuce do you think you're doing?"
The chicken didn't seem to pay the tall human with his weird hat any mind. Apparently at peace with its existence, it advanced step by step through the field, rasping and pecking the ground as it walked. It raised its head up only once to peer at him with an uninterested eye, then its attention was once again stolen by some bug in the grass.
The chicken ignored him. Instead, it looked with renewed interest at the box of flying humbugs in front of it.
Readjusting the grip on his cane, the stranger blinked, “Good morning.”
“I’m quite sure those are American.”
Eight years the Londoner had been there, and eight years later it was still what they called him. He never went out past the confines of his field, and when he did, he made for the sea, leaving their small speck of civilization well alone, the only exception being to buy food. He wasn’t what her mother would call a companionable neighbour.
“How curious, then, that they should lay eggs once they had spent a single night inside, but as soon as I let them out again, they stop. It is either an animal or a thief. No, whatever is going on it is ending tonight, and I shall see to it myself!”
“Well, it’s not as if they’re old or sick, of course. You wouldn’t get such chickens from us, doctor, no sir! I swear it on my mum’s name,” she puffed out her chest, her eyes twinkling. “Your coop looks all right and properly insulated. It must be it: there’s a predator lurking in the darkness.”
“Watson?” he said, after a moment.
Holmes laughed and rested his hands over the ones still on his face.
, but she had accepted. Plus, the old man wasn’t stingy with his money. She let the matter go.
I patted the pile of papers into order, and Holmes came over to my desk. I handed him the manuscript without a word. As he took it, he bent forward over my chair and kissed me. I kissed back, grabbing him by the curve of his neck, feeling the soft brush of smooth jaw against my palm and the fresh aroma of his aftershave fill my nostrils. His own hand reached up, scratching my stubbled cheek with a fingernail which, once we had separated, he presented to me. Chuckling at the dried ink I found there, I rubbed at the careless stain on my face.
She couldn’t really complain now, could she?
As it looked back towards the hive, he prepared to scare it away once more; but the chicken paused, had a change of heart, and decided to scavenge for worms in the ground instead.
“Are you suggesting that I leave you here, alone?” Holmes interrupted him. “Are you certain that you are in no danger?”
“Perhaps, or they’ve finally gotten used to the change.”
Watson licked his lips, “Highly positive.”
Holmes, in the meantime, had snapped out of his astonishment and slid to his side on the sofa. He gave the animal a puzzled glance as he rested his chin on Watson’s shoulder.
Melanie believed this last remark to raise more questions than answers, but decided not to comment.
“I can’t shake the feeling that you’re jumping to conclusions, but as you say,” Doctor Watson conceded, now smiling. “Although I haven’t let them roam freely yet, and none have gone missing. Besides, there aren’t any signs of entry anywhere near the fence, nor any mysterious footprints.”
“If it is so ridiculous, you’re welcome to get inside. I’m staying here.” the other man finally called back.
“John, dearest?”
Holmes looked at him, suspicion winning its battle against sheer terror, “What?”
She furrowed her brow at this “I-” She looked down at the basket in her hands. “I reckoned I was the one doing the helping here, sir. I’ve brought the supplies.”
Watson let go of his hand to cup his face in his palms, and Holmes turned into the caress like a cat.
“That thing,” said Watson, “is a chicken.”
Holmes raised his eyebrows.
I snorted, “The style seems hardly appropriate for a series of crime stories.”
“I see your point, but the cause might still be related to stress. Do they seem to get along well?”
“When the Devil did you get a rifle!”
“When I moved to a cottage in the middle of nowhere,
“On the contrary, I’m very glad you did. It might not be the result you hoped for, but it does have a unique charm of its own, don’t you think?”
The man was shorter than Mr Holmes, thicker about the... well, everything, though it didn’t take much, as Mr Holmes was a walking skeleton, sporting a thick moustache that had long lost all its colour and which covered a mouth she could only assume was twisted in an expression of bafflement that mirrored her own.
“And why is that, if you don’t mind my asking?”
He stretched his arms above his head, flinching at the popping sounds in his joints, when he noticed something smooth brush against the back of his fingers.
The girl let her foot slide from the pedals to drag it across the ground, and the old metal beast gave one last indignant screech as the world stopped moving and they finally came to a halt at the feet of the hill.
They both startled when the chicken jumped back onto the ground in a flutter of wings, the cat following its example and running outside through the open window.
Holmes snorted and reached for a cigarette in his nightgown pocket. For a few seconds, the small fire from the match pooled light in the cupping of his hands, illuminating his profile and accentuating his sharp features, his sunken cheeks casting deep shadows around the lines of his mouth. He raised a questioning eyebrow in Watson's direction, but the doctor shook his head. They both settled back to listen to the night.
“Mr Holmes!” she exclaimed, “And Doctor Watson, too, what are you doing here?”
The Londoner had always captivated her curiosity. He still did, but anything intimidating in her perception of him had withered away into habitude like a smothered flame. She used to daydream about him, making up ridiculous fantasies about an exiled criminal from some far off country on the other side of the world. The fantasy had grown quite a lot on her until one day the man himself had approached her.
In the picture, I had captured him kneeling, almost sprawled on the floor, fully engrossed in his examination of the carpet while looking for cigar ash. I wasn’t altogether happy with the end result, but there was something in the simplicity of rushed lines and rough shapes that conveyed the pure frantic energy of the chase that always gripped my friend during an investigation. His lean form lay crouched, twisted, yet elegant as seen from the back, the weight and strength of his upper body resting solely on one arm while the other hovered in front of his face.
“I was reading this tome some months ago out of boredom. Their primary defence is mimicry. I had mistaken it for a viper too, at first, but apparently they are devoid of teeth and entirely harmless, and that is because--”
“Oh, nonsense,” Mr Holmes chuckled; he looked as if he hadn’t slept at all that night, but when he glanced back at the doctor, his eyes shone like sea-glass under the sun. “We wanted to bring some supplies, that is all.”
Holmes froze as he looked into the living room.
“My dear boy, I wouldn’t blame you,” he laughed softly, “one too many fistfights has rendered it quite an ugly thing.”
“In regards to the procuring of the supplies,” murmured Mr Holmes, “we’d planned to take a walk to the village tomorrow for unrelated reasons, but I might as well take advantage of the situation to have a word with your father. I hope everything on the family farm is doing well? Splendid, splendid. I am glad to hear it. Now, as for the delivery...”
and the more they see you as a delivery
He felt Holmes tense against his leg.
Melanie agreed, the prospect of a chat with Mr Holmes and the unspoken promise of biscuits too appealing to turn down. They began to walk back to the cottage together.
Doctor Watson smiled but chose not to comment, possibly feeling that the topic was sensitive to the young girl. Instead, he drew her attention to one hen who had wandered up to them while hunting for bugs, and Melanie picked it up, holding it close to her chest. The bird didn’t so much as flap, recognising the touch of her former owner. She let her shoulders drop.
Holmes and Watson looked at each other and laughed.
“That is what I said.”
He was answered by a low groan.
"Yessir. Is Mr Holmes here?”
“Yes.”
She kicked a pebble to watch it roll down the hill.
“Doctor Watson will always be welcome to stay, for as long as he wishes.”
"I understand that it might seem like a trifle," he continued, "but it will put my mind at ease if I can ascertain the lack of danger myself."
as well.”
It was the sound of our sitting-room door being swung open that awakened me at last, and I blinked emptily at the wall, trying to assess my surroundings.
“Victoria?” he asked.
“No,” he responded after some consideration, “No, this is more than agreeable for now.”
“I’m afraid I didn’t have the chance,” said Watson, rolling his eyes. “Ten-year-old girls are already quite hard to catch up with at my age, but the task becomes especially Herculean when the child happens to be on a bicycle.”
Melanie shook her head, “You don’t know my mother, sir. Not setting a price isn’t going to stop her, she will just set one herself and you will have to be the ones to accept it. Besides, I agree with her. It feels a tad like being robbed, the way you and Mr Holmes go about doing business.”
“Well, I do,” Watson was smiling madly, “I need you to go inside, find the keys to my automobile, and drive to the village.”
“John?”
“No, sir, this was my last house today,” she crossed her arms over the table and uncrossed them again to smooth out the wrinkles she had formed in the cloth. “Doctor Watson, I had an idea that I wanted to ask you about.”
“Would you like a cup of tea, or are you engaged at the moment?”
” Mr Holmes cheered.
Holmes hummed, content, and leaned into the touch.
“Why, of course,” Holmes held up the piece of evidence. “Would you mind telling me who is responsible for this?”
“I thought it would look nice. Silly, I know.”
Raising his eyebrows, Doctor Watson went to pick at his moustache. “Threatened? Good Lord, dear girl, what makes you think that?”
“Dear me, doctor, is it the Liverpool affair that brought you to abuse your sleep schedule in such brutish a manner?”
He stoically refused to respond.
Holmes looked again and saw that the two openings were, in fact, approximately the same height. He also noticed that Watson had tried to replicate the windowsill of their cottage, with arguable proficiency.
“Oh, nonsense, you’re simply lazy.”
“I am terribly sorry, gentlemen. I don’t know what else to do for her attitude.”
“No, it is true. I’ve hurt us both deeply and I will never be sorry enough for it—”
Melanie’s eyes grew unfocused for a moment, then widened with excitement “Or maybe they feel threatened by something!”
“Well, if-
“My dear girl, where does this outburst come from? Why ever shouldn’t you trust him?” Watson asked, his voice tinged with curiosity.
“Not me. But my sister has. She was shaking so much she couldn’t speak a single word all day. She told me it was so big it could have ripped my bike to pieces. She says that beastly thing is the reason her hair’s going all grey already.”
Sherlock Holmes hung his jacket up by the door, his netted hat topping the ridiculous attire of the coat stand guarding the cottage’s front door. He rubbed his hands together, “But despite this little misadventure, I have to say I am thrilled. Oh, you should see them, John, they are doing splendidly this year. I have never seen them more alive and buzzing with energy! Young Melanie should expect to bicycle home with a basket heavier than when she came because I suspect this season’s honey will be j-“
“Still no eggs,” he said, more to himself than in answer to some question.
The old metal ladder shuddered ominously and Watson decided at once that yes, perhaps he’d rather have both his feet on the ground as soon as possible. He gave up his fruitless struggle with the coop and wobbled down the ladder. He didn’t even need to give a warning when his knee began to buckle, as Holmes had already taken ahold of his arm to support his weight.
“Which is exactly why the basket had enough space for the chicken.”
The creature moved its head and Holmes's grip turned to iron.
“Yes,” stated Watson, picking the bird up with a grip sure with years of practice. It didn’t even croak when he perched it on his right knee. “My family used to keep chickens when I was a boy, and I still remember how to care for them. In fact, I’ve been considering picking up the old habit since I settled down in my retirement with you.”
“A bit rustic, if you ask me, but why would you build it that high up? I doubt your hens will be able to look through it even on the highest perch.”
As realisation struck me, I felt my mouth fall open and a hot flare of embarrassment make its way up from my neck to my face, until the tips of my ears burned red. I inhaled sharply.
“Do you think so?”
She grabbed the basket and set about finishing her trip on foot.
She came down from the clouds when she realised she was standing in front of the cottage.
To my great dismay — and to that of my joints in particular — I found I had spent the night slumped over my writing desk, having finally lost my battle with Morpheus, and with nothing but a freshly finished first draft to act as a pillow. At some point through the morning a wool duvet had materialised over my shoulders and, though it was nigh on lunchtime, someone had closed the curtains to block out the sun’s light.
It was a beautiful summer night, somewhere down in Sussex. The torturing humidity of the previous year didn’t seem to visit the green hills surrounding their little cottage, and the ground was pleasantly warm after a full day of unbroken sunshine. All throughout the fields, the insect world thrummed with life, their buzzing choir intonating a song as old as the land they inhabited, perhaps older, and the soft beating of their wings filled the air. In the distance, the sea lay silent.
“Neither was I. I was rather hoping for a pie, actually.”
He bit his lip, looking thoughtful. “You have your bees to tend to, which, once again, I am happy about, but there isn’t... there aren’t many things left for me to do other than writing our past cases and reading. I think it would do me some good, all in all, having something like this to myself. But I can understand if raising chickens doesn’t sound appealing to you.”
"Hullo there," Holmes squinted from behind the net covering his face. "May I help you?"
He raised his gaze to mine, and I saw he was trying to keep his expression neutral. “My
“And why would that be?”
“Nothing, oh nothing, my dearest. I was thinking,” Holmes giggled to himself and kissed his cheek. “This is not quite what I had meant with ‘
Her mother stopped herself from fussing with the table cloth by flicking her forehead.
Watson,” he purred, “why, you’ve never mentioned your artistic talents before.”
Watson chuckled quietly to himself, "Do you remember that case in Paris?"
Watson didn’t respond, not at first. He had that expression of his, like he’d just stepped out the front door and someone poured a bucketful of cold water over his head. Then it softened, all the edges in his face disappearing at once, and the lines at the corner of his mouth and the crow’s feet near his eyes deepened around a smile he couldn’t hold back. He looked old. Holmes decided that time couldn’t look better on anyone else.
Watson sighed and pushed himself up to a half-sitting position, leaning his back against the bed frame. Holmes did the same, scratching the cat behind its ears.
For a second or two, it looked as if Watson were waging a war against his own facial features to keep them impassive, but his hand betrayed him when it rose and anxiously patted his moustache back into order, then he shrugged.
Despite himself, Holmes chuckled.
Holmes grabbed my hand in a gentle squeeze and grinned.
“Get down.”
The unconscious lump at his side didn’t give any sign of having heard him, or any of being alive at all. Putting a hand on his arm, Holmes raised his voice.
He clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth in acknowledgment, “Ah, of course. I should’ve known.”
“Do you wish to go to bed immediately?”
“Then you can find our cow too— wait,” she stopped. “What do you mean with ‘stolen lost horse’. How can a horse be stolen
“Besides,” he smiled, “I’m glad you’re making this place your own.”
Following that day, he was more than supportive of my hobby. He even encouraged me, upon learning that, in my youth, I had been too poor to afford anything more than a pencil, ink, and paper, to pursue other materials and techniques now that I had the means. In fact, it was hardly a month later that, with winter making its presence felt all over the country, I found myself on Christmas day sitting at my writing desk like that pivotal morning, with discarded wrapping paper in my lap and a box of watercolours peeking up at me.
“My word, aren’t you a ray of sunshine today.”
“Two?” Melanie exclaimed, biting her tongue at once over her lack of manners but nevertheless unable to contain her curiosity. “Is Doctor Watson staying for long?”
With his first glance at the manuscript, his brow furrowed.
“Not to worry, Watson here will tell you everything. We set to work early in the morning so as to bring the cake over before lunch. We hope it will be to your liking.”
Sherlock Holmes stood in the opened doorway, clad in his grey coat, his top hat already in hand and a flush of red brightening the line of his cheekbones due to the coming winter air.
“You are a
Watson stared at her for a moment, then smiled. “I’ve been told he has, once or twice in his life,”.
The chicken turned to him and cooed. Holmes sighed.
“Well,” Watson didn’t meet his eyes, “There isn’t much to do here—for me, that is. I’ve always looked forward to retirement as a time to relax and do nothing at all, but lately I’ve found that the inactivity makes me grow restless. This isn’t to say that I don’t love our new life or waking up besides you every morning, but-“
And yet I lingered. I made a show of rubbing my stiffened leg, but truth be told, the spirit of the writer in me awaited eagerly for some sort of response for my full night of work. I watched Holmes’ face, studying the slight changes in his expression as he struggled through my mangled handwriting. As he turned the first page, I was surprised to see his eyebrows shoot up his prominent brow and almost disappear into his hairline. He blinked twice and studied the manuscript intently. He turned to the second page and, sure enough, his eyes fixed themselves with such an intensive curiosity they could have burned a hole clean through the paper. In less time than it could have possibly taken to read the text, he again turned another page.
Doctor Watson pulled a face as he took a deep breath, considering the situation. He looked back down at her, “We have returned a stolen lost horse years ago, now that I think about it.”
, I thought to myself.
“Yes well, a mere hobby of mine, nothing more than silly scribbles between the paragraphs.” I said as I walked over to where Holmes was seated. “If you would be so kind as to give it back, I’ve changed my mind: the sooner I finish copying this draft, the better”
His expression cleared as a lanky figure appeared over his shoulder.
Watson gave in, “Old boy, that can’t be good for your joints.”
stop laying eggs.”
“I sincerely hope you have a reason for bothering me at such an ungodly hour.”
“It’s- Um. I was...” Watson put his hands on his hips, suddenly self-conscious. “I was attempting to make a window.”
“I can’t believe I lost the show.”
“I don’t think we have any reason to be afraid,” Watson laughed, a shade testily.
I blinked, shocked. “Posed?”
“They are strict ovivores,” Holmes read. He snorted and closed his eyes once more, “My word, it must have been a feast for him.”
“I fear,” Holmes mused, rolling onto his belly and pillowing his arms under his head, “that young Melanie’s theory might have some truth to it. That is the first egg your chickens have laid since you bought them, isn’t that right?”
Doctor Watson looked from his companion and back to her for a moment, then broke out into a kind smile and offered her his hand.
“My dear fellow, that is simply wonderful!”
“If it’s all the same to you,” he said, stroking with his fingertips the feathers at the base of the animal’s neck, “I would prefer it if we didn’t kill it. I’m not a squeamish man, Holmes, you know that better than anyone, but regardless... I’m sorry. I find that I don’t enjoy all that much the prospect of eating this poor thing.”
, as your father likes to say.”
“It was... oh, it is a long story. Maybe one day I’ll read it to you when you’re older.”
Holmes sighed.
“I’m getting the rifle.”
“Then he needs to help us, sir!”
Melanie, now worried that she had spoken out of place, shuffled her feet “Well, I shouldn’t say, but...” she drawled, “I think, sir, that there should be tests for that, sir. They should put a number of rules telling you just how many dangerous animals you can keep if you forget the hound’s cage open too many times in a week, sir. You can’t have escaped hounds lurking around and scaring people everywhere. It’s a matter of safety, that’s all.”
That seemed to rob Holmes of his speech. He blinked, once or twice, surprised despite himself at this small alleyway of Watson’s character that he had somehow never noticed before.
“Good morning.”
The doctor was completely lucid now. Few things are capable of scaring Sherlock Holmes to irrationality, snakes being one of them; but the spell of fear had been broken, and Watson rifled through his memories. Holmes tugged at his arm.
Sometimes Melanie would let herself wonder. She didn’t exactly stalk the house day and night, but she never seemed to see any visitors come rapping at their door. They didn’t seem to have wives or children. When she thought about it, neither did they seem to possess any other kind of relative at all.
“But… why?” asked Melanie, “I mean, I’m coming over tomorrow, as usual, there was no need to drive all the way here today.”
She wiped away the sweat from her brow with the back of her hand and hopped off the bike.
He waved a hand dismissively. “Think nothing of it. And the manuscript is finished?”
She raised her hands to the sky, “We lost a cow!”
“I beg your pardon?”
He didn’t pose it like a question, but I treated it like one all the same.
The hen cooed, and Holmes hummed in agreement.
“Is that cake?” Melanie asked, and her mother sighed.
She took it and gave a firm squeeze, her shoulders squared mirroring his own, before finally handing the basket over.
When he looked for the chicken again, he could only spot a tiny dot in the distance, disappearing in the direction of the hen house.
She took one last, sharp turn towards the farm, and then an even sharper halt.
“John.”
Holmes smiled at Watson’s distracted tone as he felt his companion shift and brush his lips against the soft back of his neck. Then he huffed and plopped down onto the bed, an arm thrown across Holmes’ body and his chin digging into his shoulder.
"Your prose puts Monsieur Hugo to shame, my dear."
“Yes, thank you, I was aware of that. What I asked is what is a chicken doing in our living room.”
“Oh, well; a gift is a gift, after all,” Holmes grinned a devil’s grin in Watson’s direction. “And there aren’t too many steps between a chicken and a pie, anyway. What do you say, dear fellow? That chicken has given me a brilliant idea for dinner.”
Melanie looked out at the fluttering, clucking flock roaming around their newly acquired home and took a sip from her water-flask. Or, well, she thought, I suppose you could call them a flock. A five chicken flock. Not a big flock, but a flock nonetheless. More of a flick, actually. "O" was too big a vowel for that number.
“How much would Mr Holmes’ services cost? My mother wishes to know.”
I have the painting to this day and am tremendously proud of it. Though the few people to whom I’ve shown it seem to admire it, they will never be able to appreciate it as fully as when I see it, hanging next to its twin in Holmes’s bedroom — a jewel amongst the wall of snarling criminal faces — while the weight of my beloved’s head presses against my breast and all is at peace with the world.
Watson hesitated for a second, a lifelong habit of stating the obvious still unbroken, before resting his hand in the nest of half-greyed hair.
Finally, he slid the last frame back into place, unbothered by any more feathered thieves, closed the hive, and stood back with his hands on his hips to admire a job well done.
“Watson.”
“Watson, if you would kindly hand me your walking stick."
It wasn’t as if she couldn’t climb it on wheels as easily as as she could on foot, mind you, but the last time she’d done so the old girl had all but collapsed under her weight, and only thanks to a miracle had she managed to stay on the saddle during their descent and not crack her head open on some rock. She didn’t want to risk it again. The morning was beautiful, there was no denying this, but a walk in the fields tends to be enjoyable only as far as you don’t have to drag the metal carcass of a bike after you for a mile and a half. That she could do well without.
"On the contrary," said Holmes, "this explains everything. You should be grateful that it hasn’t killed one of your hens yet. It must have been bothering my hives as well."
Some time later that night, after a few journeys back and forth filled with endless apologies and, at one point, a surprisingly placid snake in the comfortable though temporary confines of a carton box, Sherlock Holmes found himself once again inside his cottage, the fire rumbling in the grate warming his frozen bones, and a mighty headache preparing to lay siege to his frontal lobe.
, right about the time a number of convicted felons began to return to civilization from the gaols I put them in!”
“Yes, and our new cow, at that! My mother asked me to tell you about it. We’ve looked for it everywhere, and we’re starting to believe someone stole it. Can Mr Holmes help us?”
The ridiculous part was that it was a Thursday too. She couldn’t stand Thursdays; they usually got on her nerves by noon.
“You’re blaming an egg on my cat.”
Watson reached down to squeeze his fingers, “Do you remember that collection of research upon the fauna of the colonies gathering dust in your attic?”
Holmes let go of his arm and turned towards the cottage.
“Good question,” mumbled the old doctor, “it seems rather confused in that regard as well. I can only tell you that Mrs Walters sends her thanks for the cow.”
“Kudos to her for surprising me! I was not expecting this”
“I don’t like how your nose turned out.”
Then it caught one in mid air and ate it.
“My dear fellow, of course; but what do you suppose we do with it, then? We could sell it to another farmer, if that is what you wish, but there’s no guarantee that a similar fate won’t befall it.”
Holmes witnessed his faltering, rambling speech in complete silence. Still without uttering a word, he slid his arm through Watson’s and interlocked their fingers.
“What are you doing?”
“One devil of a cat you have there, if you ask me.”
Watson laughed softly. He set the book aside, and pushed Holmes down by his shoulders until his head was in his lap. Carding his fingers through the soft, silvery hair, he leaned down to press a kiss to his forehead.
“Has Mr Holmes every thought of using that trick of his to solve mysteries?”
“You’re not beating a snake to death with my cane!”
“John.” he called, shaking him gently, and Watson’s breath hitched. Turning over so they could face each other, he huffed, rubbed at his eyes and gave the room a tired glance.
"Yes! No—I don't know, but I certainly would not put it past them, either way." Holmes snapped.
“There!” Watson exclaimed, and Holmes finally lifted an eyelid.
“Oh, don’t make that face, I’m not disposing of your services. Au contraire, I wished to ask if bringing more food would be a nuisance to you. Our regular deal might not be enough for two, I’m afraid.”
"Easy does it," he murmured, "this will be over soon", when he cast a glance to his side.
Holmes raised an eyebrow, then gave it a second thought and pushed it back down. Instead, he barked out a laugh and shook his head.
“Fascinating! And you’ve been doing this for how long?”
What a beautiful morning, was the thought crossing the mind of the young girl, her old bicycle lamenting the sharp turns she made as she barrelled past fields smelling of earth and wild-born flowers that had just begun to bloom. She rode fast, faster, and the few solitary clouds left in the sky felt more still than the rain kissed road beneath her wheels.
“Sir?”
“Oh.”
They did catch his attention, after he'd thoroughly inspected the frame and begun to slide it back into place, when the defensive buzz roared again.
Watson gave an awkward pat on the animal’s back. It had an air of aloof indignation with its ruffled feathers and tense squawking. Their old ginger cat, sat on the top of the highest shelf in the room, was giving the intruder a rather nasty looking glare. “Poor thing, that girl has no concept of laws—whether they be of the road or of physics—when she jumps on that bicycle. I find it difficult to hope that it’s been a pleasant journey.”
"Ah yes, the sewers. Wet, dirty, absolutely disgusting odor. How could I forget."
It was Watson this time who caught him by the arm.
Trying to keep the beast away, he kicked his leg out to the side, managing to make it flap back a foot or two, but immediately gave up that plan when his joints made their disapproval very clear. Being up to his elbows in a beehive, he realized, was not the best position to find oneself in while fighting a chicken.
“Good heavens, dear, what happened?”
“Really?” blinked Watson, with the face of a man somewhat relieved at the prospect of not inspecting a dead body right before lunchtime.
"Thank you," Watson broke the silence once again, "for the letter. I’ve never properly expressed my gratitude. It was awfully selfless of you to offer so much."
“Young lady, I’m afraid I don’t quite follow. Who exactly are you?”
“Ah, at the moment I’m afraid he could be anywhere. He says he is ‘checking the queens’, but considering the amount of time he spends with those bees I can’t be sure he won’t move out and sleep in the field, one of these days.”
you truly wish to,” I stammered, “then of course, I’d be honoured.”
They did start to come down to the village under Doctor Watson’s request, where Mr Holmes made quite the reputation for himself thanks to his weird trick with looking at the point of your boots and spitting out your morning routine from the moment you woke up to you standing there with your jaw on the floor. Melanie had never understood how the two things correlated, but she knew that the face Mrs Avery had made after a demonstration on her own character had been well worth the temper that accompanied her for days — and made her class hell on earth to attend. She wondered, sometimes, how two men could come to such a peculiar lifestyle, and reached the conclusion that the capital was just one very strange place. After that, she dismissed the matter from her mind altogether.
She dismounted her old steed and left her by the side of the house. Toeing off her shoes and hanging her cycling jacket by the door, she peeked through the entrance to the living room.
Once back to safety, Watson patted him affectionately on the back.
Three years went by, her bike started to fall apart, and Mr Holmes — the Londoner’s name, as she came to know — stayed pretty much the same; alone in his little cottage except for the bees, he would receive his “supplies” every two or three mornings when he couldn’t come down to the village (he rarely did) and pay her, sometimes with money, sometimes with honey. He never lived up to her daydreams, obviously, but it was undeniable that the old man had his charm.
