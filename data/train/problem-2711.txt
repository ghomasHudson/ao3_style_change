“I simply love your pixie cut and the platinum blonde color? Very fashion forward.”
“I liked you so much better when you had laryngitis,” Violet informed him sweetly.
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open in shock. “John, I…”
Violet immediately balled her right hand into a fist.
“Being delivered,” Green jerked the zip-ties around his wrists extra-tight, “You sick fuck.”
“Looked like one to me. You could have lived like a prince, yet you stay here, in London, in a tiny overpriced flat.”
“Want one?” she tilted her head towards the carton of eggs.

rich. Once his friends either had died from overdose or sobered up, the parties got boring. So my uncle became interested in politics. First thing he did was to marry a highly regarded woman with an impeccable reputation.”
“Call her. Pick her brain. Look, she can get inside of people’s heads in a way that neither you nor I can and we are seriously running out of time.”
“Never thought I’d meet a cop I’d actually like,” Rat Boy told Violet as he shook her hand.
The two of them against the world, Violet and Bear gathered evidence to prove Jack’s treachery as well as the sinister Earl of Winchester.
“She was not a prostitute,” Sherlock muttered as he drew on purple latex gloves. “So it shall not be Jack the Ripper again, unless you have located another fake skeleton lounging in a gravesite rumored to be Jack the Ripper’s final resting place?”
“Of course, it’s obvious there are accomplices. I believe whoever cooked the bodies-”
Finally, on a slightly personal note,  I have a feeling I'm not the only one who wants to give 2016 a hard reboot right about now. Here's hoping that 2017 is better... it has to be better... we're finally getting Series 4, right? RIght???
he thought frantically as he vividly recalled the heated argument they had last January, the one that drove him to find comfort in a seven-percent solution and Molly Hooper’s arms…
“I don’t
“Don’t try to  make me feel guilty Sherlock Holmes, it won’t work.”
John ignored him. “But Gary, he… he was a lad who lived two doors down from us. Knew him since we were in nursery school and he was, well, different. Shy. Bookish and, err, well he was a bit effeminate, I suppose, but we got along all right. We swapped comics and football mags, went to each other’s houses for tea, snuck into the cinemas and I dunno, he was a nice kid but because he was a bit girly, he got bullied and…” his voice gave out.
“No. He won’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And really, if sex must be a factor, he actually craved monogamy.
“Give us a minute,” Sherlock purred, “As you recall, I’m the show-off, Violet’s the shy one.”
. And it was truly

that.”
“Grow up John,” he told himself as he turned back to his poem, wincing as he did so. “You two have had to share a bed before for cases. And you nearly passed out on the stairs at 221B during your stag party next to him as well. Stop being a child.”
“Not that complication, although that is another complication I need to contend with,” Mycroft felt his head throb with sleep-deprivation and anxiety, “The Watson girl.”
“Yeah, one of the tactical agents he asked to provide backup at the cathedral at Normandy. Apparently, Dupin is also flat-broke but that didn’t stop him from making certain monetary promises. He thought he could cover it from what Interpol owed him for consulting except now Dupin and Interpol are arguing over what is owed because Dupin feels like he deserves more since he helped not only take down Moriarty but saved Mont-Sant-Michel from blowing to bits.”
“I’d stay put if I were you,” Sherlock said as everyone else started filtering into the lounge, each one of them uttering exclamations and expletives all at once:
John Watson really would have made an excellent cop. A shame he didn’t consider that when he recovered from his military duty in Afghanistan.
Dandruff Boy pointed the AK-15 at Irene Adler. Violet, firmly heterosexual and intensely focused on her task, felt her breath catch in her throat. The Woman really was exquisitely beautiful. Even in this situation, wearing the black jumper, designer jeans and black boots Julia Stoner had forced her to put on before abducting her, she still looked stunning. Someone had styled her jet black hair into its signature chignon. Her face however was free of all cosmetics. Her skin looked as smooth and white as a lily. Her eyes were even more striking in person than in photographs, the palest of greens. But those eyes were pinned in fear. They had lit up with hope when she recognized Sherlock when he got close enough. But when she saw that he was being held by gunpoint, the hope died and she merely looked like an extremely lovely and absolutely terrified woman.
Of course Sherlock knew how to drive and actually owned several vehicles of all different makes, models and conditions. He had them carefully concealed in various neighborhoods in London, near his bolt-holes, of course.
Sherlock wasn’t smirking. He had, to state it crudely, a shit-eating-grin on his pale, narrow face.
He had successfully avoided her socially since the disastrous stag party. Fortunately John had gotten him too drunk to really notice how her belly had grown. Her lab coats had mostly concealed the pregnancy… until now, of course. She was due in October. Three months to go…
“Don’t apologize,” she said softly. “It’s always difficult when your child is suffering.”
Wednesday morning
“I was six when she died. I don’t really remember much.” She cleared her throat. “When you bring this matter to the table, let them know that if they help me get out of the country, the club would be richly rewarded.”
“I cottoned on to that, funnily enough. Good thing we took a cab instead of driving.”
Still asleep, Sherlock no longer lay on his back, but curled up in the fetal position. A light perspiration coated his face as he clutched at the duvet. “
24 April 2016
“I think the time for you pretending you don’t know who the father of Molly’s baby is has passed,” Sherlock said calmly. “I’m not leaving London without my son.”
“I told you I didn’t feel well,” Violet reminded him with a bite in her voice. “I was in an accident yesterday. I’m fine,” when Dimmock opened his mouth to apologize. “Really, I’m just very sore and slow-moving but my eyes and mind are working just fine. Besides…” Violet’s hazel eyes roamed the room and locked on a picture she had seen before. The same photograph was in the upstairs bedroom at 221B Baker Street.
Violet immediately pictured all the tough and grizzly bikers in their leathers, riding the Dumbo ride while wearing Mickey Mouse ears. She covered her face and started to giggle helplessly.
Alexis “Call Me Alex” MacDonald had answered, “No one is safe. No one is untouchable.”
“Eddie?” Violet called, walking down the curving staircase, now carrying the pair of trainers she had brought with her. Her uniform be damned, she’d  wear the stupid blouses, the ludicrous skirts and the goddamned scarf, but she refused to wear high heels when taking Edward outside to play or for his constitutionals or whatever…
Saturday afternoon
profiling
Before John could argue, Dupin rumbled, “The mind needs rest and fuel just as the body does. One cannot exist without the other.”
But Mrs. Toller had backed down. Probably because the list was in Rucastle’s handwriting.
“That’s what she said,” John’s eyes sparkled mischievously as Mary playfully slapped his unhurt arm, giggling like a schoolgirl.
10:00 PM
“I think the riluzole is finally kicking in,” Violet put her glass of water down and reached for the tiny cup of coffee with her left hand. Over that hand and wrist was a flexible black brace. It was similar to John’s soft brace after his broken hand and wrist had healed enough to no longer need a cast or a hard splint, but it was a bit more bendable than John’s old brace. “And the docs finally switched me from baclofen to tizanidine.”

Also, mild trigger and spoiler warning because of a certain nefarious character showing up again.

“Are we going to
He checked his watch. He had an ulterior motive for sending Violet to the backroom.
“Jesus… how are we supposed to catch him if we can’t communicate with each other or the Met or…” He then blurted out what he had been obsessing over for nearly a year now: “Sherlock, how

Had toddler-like meltdown when Lego tower fell down.
“Good,” his father said “Because I feel guilty enough for the entire family.” He ruffled Mycroft’s hair just like he did when he had been a little boy. “Now, I need sustenance before I pick up Sherlock and his new friend. The good Lord knows I will need strength to face whatever

Sons?” Violet now felt the old irritation towards her flatmate-friend-lover-fiancé.
“And that confirms you are still high as a kite,” Sherlock sighed.
During the day, John stoutly told himself this, reminded himself He Was Not Gay. It was the trauma, it was the shock, it was fucked up, plus to pursue this line of action would cost him everything important. His relationship with his best friend. His relationship with Violet. His unborn child.
Lestrade looked over his shoulder as Henry tried to shove his entire fist into his mouth. “Listen, now that things have settled down with Moriarty and John and everything… maybe we can figure out some sort of visitation schedule. Let him get to know you?”
“As I said, this was a mistake, go home,” Sherlock tried to get up again but Mycroft finally put his suspicions aside, softening at last.
“You’re not his
been using.
Ignoring Violet’s question, Lisbeth squared her narrowed shoulders. “Sherlock, we talked about this during the drive,” she added lowly.
Violet wasn’t sure if “exciting” was the correct description for her weekend. “Anxious boredom” might have been better.
She heard soft violin music, stopping and starting again…. Sherlock, composing, still working on that new piece he had started weeks ago, shortly after Molly and Greg’s wedding.
He had never met someone as wired as Sherlock before… the way his mind worked, his constant energy, his endless curiosity, he never
Under different circumstances, it would have been funny.
The first thing to pop into John’s head was,
“I most assuredly did not. I gain nothing if I set you up.”
“Which was why Moriarty’s men tried to apprehend her and Mitton in the first place, so she couldn’t testify against the Senator,” Sherlock interjected.
“Cynic,” Dupin crooned as he changed the radio station from rock to classical music.
“Tell them your mother was American. She was obsessed with orthodontia, as you Americans all seem to be, and that your father gave in because he tired of arguing with her.”
Lestrade pulled the car up to the kerb. “This is madness, Sherlock,” he said again, but Sherlock had already bounded out of Lestrade’s vehicle. Lestrade watched for a moment as Sherlock ran to inspect the black cab then shook his head before barreling out of his car, following Sherlock. “Oi! Get back here!”
“No. He’s
“You OK, mate?” Gregson lifted a ginger brow at Sherlock.
“Here you go,” she said cheerily, “Careful, pan’s hot.”
“Mycroft,” Dupin grunted. “Apparently he is finally convinced that Sherlock is being a good boy who hasn’t left Baker Street. His flight to Switzerland has been confirmed.”
“Of course you can help, you’re my very best helper, aren’t you?” Toller crooned at the boy. Edward lit up like a Christmas tree.
“And now you’ll miss me by two,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Please stop making an arse of yourself, it’s wearisome and I wish to discuss more interesting topics. Besides, obviously I’m wanted alive otherwise you would have just started firing away the minute I stepped foot onto the deck and still probably miss due to your intoxication. But if you kill me, you’ll be in worse trouble than what you are already with the police. Oh, I’m sorry, didn’t anyone inform you?” Sherlock’s voice became syrupy sweet. “You’ve been caught. All of you. Implicated in the Burned Girls’ case. And, yes, sorry, nearly forgot to mention a cop spotted you breaking into the Watsons’ terrace house. The police are on their way, warrants in hand. Not that I care,” Sherlock took another step closer as Toller limply lowered the gun to his side, goggling Sherlock. “Once the mystery is solved, what happens next is none of my concern. Court is boring, sentencing is anti-climatic and ugh, the appeals system. The endless appeals that won’t do you a bit of good as you’ll have to stay in prison during that process. Dull. So I really don’t care if you get caught by the police. You could scarper right now if you wanted, I wouldn’t stop you. But then you’d be in the glue with your other boss, the big boss, not Rucastle. Not that pompous obese dilettante you’ve been saddled with all these years. The big boss. Come on,” Sherlock wheedled him. “Who is he? Who is the new Jim Moriarty?”
“To break a heart,” he said flatly. “Which is complete rubbish to even be concerned about the sentiments of others, and yet, I loathe going through with it. What does that make me?”
“I didn’t know you had children.”
“You have sleep to do,” Violet mumbled as she ran her hand up and down, grazing his flat belly with the pads of her fingers, a pleasant, not-quite-ticklish sensation. “You and John aren’t scheduled to interview Ayda Heidari** at the nut-house until three tomorrow.”
“No,” Sherlock dug deep into the sofa cushions and produced a mobile, but not just any mobile.
Violet, whey-faced, nodded, wishing he would have lied.  “So… what now?”
Violet knew that Molly had internally breathed a sigh of relief when she realized her son had not inherited his father’s heterochromia or coal-black curls.
He slid the Unlock button, punching in his code and opened the text message:
Still, he felt like a bum compared to Harry. Every single article of clothing she wore, while simple, had an expensive designer label stitched into it.
… but two days later, he found out Sherlock did indeed hear the last insult and took it to heart.
Not enough evidence for an arrest, unfortunately. Not yet anyway. But if the supposedly reformed arsonist Toller was indeed involved in any way, if perhaps he was a silent partner in the third-party accounting company or actually owned part or all of Westaways, then they could haul him in for questioning, possibly even arrest him. And if he’s arrested then the police wouldn’t need a warrant from a magistrate. With a suspect in custody, they could search not just Westaways, but the Tollers’ residence, the Rucastles’ residence and Rucastles’ offices.
Ten minutes later, a clean-shaven John sat in his comfy plaid chair, wearing neatly-pressed jeans and his red button-down. Sherlock sat in his green vinyl chair, wearing, to John’s surprise, a dark navy suit and a crisp white dress shirt. John decided he liked it. The navy didn’t make him look like an undertaker as some of his black suits did.
“Oh no, thank you, that’s so kind,” Violet gushed as she was half-way out the door. “It’s not a cumbersome tiered cake, just a sponge I picked up from Tesco. Be back in a moment.”
Sherlock obeyed, with a black look clouding his face.
Miscarried
“I’m fine,” John made a sweeping gesture with his hands. “I can compartmentalize. Had to when I was in service. I can do it again.”
would get underneath her skin.”
“Nonsense,” Sherlock said breezily, pushing past the dour PA. “He’ll be overjoyed to see me.”
“Great,” John felt a familiar and welcome rush of adrenaline flood his bloodstream. “How?”
“Looks like you got a dud here,” one of gangsters crowed as the pit bull merely sat on his haunches instead of attacking the bait dog.
“Saturday.”
“I practically said the same to Violet,” Molly lifted her big brown eyes up to Lestrade. “But she told me he had been battling PSTD for quite some time now. From the war, you see. Now, with his sister being murdered and now this with Mary and the baby, it most likely pushed him over the edge.”
“How did you acquire this information?” Mycroft gripped the handle of his umbrella tighter.
it to her.
“Yes. We’re both fluent. Would it be easier for you if we spoke in French instead?”
, John inwardly groaned as despair replaced the warm glow.
Janine’s thoughts stuttered to a halt when she saw Sally Donovan leaning up against the dented Ford Transit Connect she bought used when she arrived in Hastings. In London, one could go without a car. In Hastings, she discovered, she couldn’t. She also discovered a van was more practical for her, since all of her home repair materials and gardening supplies wouldn’t fit in the boot of a regular car.
She looked like a modern-day wicked queen. She looked like she had been born and raised in New York’s posh Upper East Side. But when she opened her mouth, a pure London accent came out. “Hello, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, I am Alice Fowler. I trust my brother-in-law told you why I require your services?”
,” Sherlock hissed between his teeth.
“Heath, it’s been a pleasure working with you.”
He stopped cleaning his teeth. The toothbrush, still foamy with toothpaste, slid from his hand and clattered to the tile floor. He gripped the edge of the sink and lowered his head, covering his face with this other hand. His shoulders started to shake as he folded his lips together, still fighting the tears even though they had already started rolling down his face.
“Yes.”
“Why is he so fond of that manky old flat?” Mary asked as she sat down at the desk and started opening drawers. “He can afford better,” she looked around the expansive library. And then she muttered “A lot better, I think.”
Once in his old room, John saw the skylight had been left wide open and the rickety folding ladder were down. A few leaves were on the floor, some were green, some already golden. Autumn was already slowly pushing summer away.
“I know, but what… Sherlock,” Victor said as Sherlock shrugged him off again, turning his back on him since he had no other means of escape. “What else am I supposed to do?”
“Yeah, fine, let’s get on with it,” John grunted.
As for Sherlock’s “friends”, the older man and the young woman had slipped out before the police came inside. Presumably they hid out in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen; snacking on her scones while avoiding the police. Lestrade had sinking feeling that Sherlock was up to something since he didn’t want his two new “friends” involved with the break-in.
“We’re getting closer,” Sherlock sounded as excited as a child on his first trip to Disneyland.
“That’s not dancing,” Sherlock stammered, trying to get away from her.
The shipyard was not completely dark. There were a few lights still working. So Sherlock could see the handsome man in his early thirties waiting for him. “Mr. Holmes?” he asked.
He strode over to the arena and handed the pistol to Gang He. “If it’s not working out, dispose of it. I can’t make any money off it if it won’t do its job.” He gave the pit bull a contemptuous look then spun around and smiled at Violet. “My dear Violet, do not despair. Most people interested in this sport are not interested in Alsatians. Pit bulls are the preferred breeds. You see, this,” he spread his arms out wide, “Is how you know that I trust you. I don’t show ordinary people my side businesses. Oh, I’m not into,” he flapped his fat hand towards the arena and the crates, “that. But I do rent the buildings out to the people who feel enthusiastic about this sport.”
If it wasn’t for the target, this would be a boring hit, to be honest.
“I told you,” Violet made her voice sound resigned. “This is not personal.”
But the next picture she had flipped was Sherlock and Victor.
Sherlock suppressed an eye roll. He really hated that word.
“Indeed,” Sherlock drawled, a bit of his façade slipping. He covered the slip by taking a sip of his drink, grimacing slightly at the taste.
“It’s fine, really,” John squared his shoulders. “Just…” he ran his fingers through his hair and licked his lips. “Let’s get this over with.”
“Do you need me to change your bandages or anything?”
Her alter-ego, the prim and proper “Miss Smith” was definitely dead and buried.
Ironically, Section Chief Melrose had taken over Section Chief Robert “Bear” Carson’s old division after he and his entire team had gotten burned.
“Yes, of course, how stupid of me to forget that,” John snarled. “I got distracted as I was picking teeny tiny shards of glass out of your hair.”
Victor swallowed, wiped crumbs off his lip. “She believes her father murdered her mother.”
He craned his head and peered into the toilet. The contents looked like reddish coffee grounds.
“Anyway, after his family lost the titles, they still owned quite a bit of the land around here and they leased it out for farming and livestock. But apparently Sherlock’s dad got himself into a bit of a financial bind when Sherlock was quite little. He ended up selling everything except the family estate, of course. Then the land was sold again to developers and whatnot. Most of the farmers and their families left. Had to. There was no work. Then the new motorway was put in which bypassed the town. No one really had a reason to drive through here anymore. So Winterbourne just sort of withered away. Shame, really. It’s a pretty little place. Be a nice commuter town between Rugby and Coventry.”
“He won’t be able to say no,” Sherlock had told John, Mary and Violet last night when they were all crammed into the small bathroom after Violet had been sick. “He’s a functioning alcoholic. Obvious as you can smell the fumes off of him when he enters a room. His sclera is also yellow, jaundice. Liver malfunction. Cirrhosis. His drinking problem is why he botched the disposal of Antonia Pandy’s body. He had imbibed a bit more than usual. His tolerance is getting higher so he had miscalculated and had one too many. He was drunker than usual and got sloppy. He panicked and just dumped the body in the bin instead of displaying it like a marionette in front of the theatres. With both Mary and I asking him to buy wine for Rucastle and then telling him to pick up a bottle of something for himself, he won’t be able to resist. His addiction, his need for alcohol will override his common sense. The only thing worse than a drunk, is a stupid drunk.”
“I want to see her,” Violet demanded, her voice stronger than she felt, “The girl. I want to see her and I want to see you release her.”
Finally he whispered, “It matters to
While John wrote, Mary cleaned out the refrigerator, then proceeded to start baking, staring with an enormous amount of muffins. Some were for immediate consumption, the rest to freeze for later. After the muffins, Mary planned on making three different kinds of bread and a pie.
“Absolutely correct, you magnificent boy!” Rucastle cuddled the boy closer to him. Then bawled out, “Mrs. Toller, it’ll just be the five of us for tea. Miss Smith will want to spend the rest of the evening with her fiancé, but I want to hear all about your adventures Saturday night, Mr. Holmes… especially how you survived that ruddy nose-dive from St. Bart’s rooftop!”
W/the wife at the moment – VT
Sniffling again, Molly nodded.
Violet roughly shoved that revelation out of her head. Now was not the time to dwell on such matters. Fortunately, Violet was extremely good at compartmentalizing. She had to be, with her old job and her current life.
“I planned on turning in my resignation on Monday.”
He wanted his father to take his hands off his shoulders though. He could barely stand having anyone touch him these days.
Lestrade exhaled, “Not just you. Glad you said it, ‘cause I was definitely thinking it.” He stuck his finger into Molly’s bowl and helped himself to more Chantilly cream and strawberry sauce, even though she playfully slapped his hand with her spoon. “It felt like they were faking it, the Happy Couple Bit, didn’t it?”
at risk. Think, John. What would be a more logical place to lock me up in?”
His face finally softened, “It was
“One o’clock.”
At today’s tea, Edward sat on his zombie-mother’s lap again, eyeing Violet warily the entire time. He pressed his thin body against Tristan when Rucastle asked Violet, “I say, what happened to your hand, Miss Smith?”
“Sherlock, I’ve been sleep-deprived, poisoned and kidnapped. Plus my dog was shot. My puny brain can’t keep up with yours on a good day. Use little words.”
“What if I blindfolded you? What if you didn’t know whose hand was under your skirt?”
“What?” John blinked.
“It’s not the boys,” Mary could barely get the words out. “At least, not directly,” she sank down onto the sofa as if her legs gave way.
Wednesday afternoon
Mary pressed her hands to her mouth. She looked like she was about to cry. Her voice quavered when she finally lowered her hands to speak, “You said Alex witnessed Toller breaking into our home. He was planting evidence to frame John, wasn’t he? That’s why you didn’t want us going home to pack.”
, Sherlock?” as he shook from head to toe with  anger.
“What the hell?” John squinted his eyes, trying to see, but it was too dark. All he could make out were silhouettes in the security lights. “Who’s that now?”
“I’m OK.”
He had asked her and her missionary companion out for lunchon the pretence of learning more about their faith. In reality, he had just wanted Hope’s telephone number. But he respected her faith and the rules of her mission work. He stayed an arm’s length from her, as the rules of her mission dictated. He didn’t invite her to bars or night clubs.  He did discover that she was a little bit of a rebel, that she didn’t believe wholeheartedly in the Mormon Church just as he only half-heartedly attended services at his Anglican church back home in Gwenydd.
Tuesday morning
“Ah,” John leaned back in his own chair. “I see. It’s not you being obstructive, it’s her. Isn’t it?”
.  Please please
He cupped her face with his other hand. To the casual observer, it appeared he was merely a good friend comforting a very worried wife.
Crawling backwards through the tunnel was worse than creeping forward. John tried to pretend his arms and legs weren’t scraping across skulls and femurs.
“Put his hands on you?” John crumpled the cheque in his fist. “You fucking
“You’re not married then.” Mary was startled at the woman’s willingness to share her life so easily and openly. But then, she had spent almost three years of her life with a man who would not open up even on the pains of death.
“… hasn’t been any progress yet. The merchandise was re-deposited back into its proper place,” meaning The Letter had been returned to the safe in Trelawney-Hope’s house, “And now we’re just waiting for The Lady,” meaning Julia Stoner, not Lady Hilda, “to make an appearance.”
Clarissa whimpered again as Remy and Sherlock flanked her. “It’s alright, ma’am,” Remy attempted to console her.
“No. I thought he was a twat.”
“Some might argue  otherwise. Oh, that reminds me, speaking of your ridiculous loyalty, your mobile please,” he held out his hand. When John refused to move, the Professor testily commanded, “Come, come, I can’t risk you warning Sherlock with a call or text. Mary already surrendered her mobile.”
,” Sherlock sneered. “Oh, Mycroft made a pitch to her stating he needed someone like her with her skills and her background to

Not to mention John had his own debts to pay. Being out of work was no joke. The lack of cases from the Met had hurt John financially more than he cared to admit.
,” John blushed.
Mary and Molly chatted a few minutes more. Mary gave Molly an update on Sherlock’s recent illness. “He’s nearly back in the land of the living now, but it really knocked the wind out of his sails. In another week or so, he should be back to his usual obnoxious self.”
Then back to Trager as she said, with complete sincerity this time, “She’s really pretty.”
Absolutely couldn’t remember her voice.
“John, is that your case, down there?” Mrs. Hudson pointed to the bag at the bottom of the stairs as they all clattered down the steps.
Black nose quivering, the hurt dog limped over to investigate. Then he gobbled up the pastry in one bite. Sherlock smiled. “See? Wasn’t that good?”
“I think I hate you.”
“Thank God,” Sherlock dropped his luggage at the foot of the stairs. “Home at last.”
“Jesus,” John shook his head, “Sherlock, the guy is a bloody maniac. We’ve got to capture him, plan a trap,
This is an empty house. If Donovan and Mason came to Appledore and found nothing, they would have been allowed to leave unmolested.”
She had no idea how the weapon worked. She didn’t even know if the safety was on or off.
“Yes, yes, that as well,” Irene snipped. “Now, where is this short-cut?”
“Ah. Harry.”
Before he could answer, the waiter returned with their starters. “No, I rescued her myself,” Sherlock told her after the waiter was safely away. “While I was not pleased with Miss Adler’s antics, I had no wish for her to die. Besides,” his mouth quirked up in an almost-smile as he reached for the good, crusty bread. “The world would become a far duller place without her.”
Dupin slowly opened his eyes, but looked at the statue instead of the Baker Street Boys. “Beautiful, isn’t she?” he looked at her the way a besotted man looks at his true love. “Whenever I need to think, I always come here. It’s like talking to an old friend.”
“Come off it. We… I’m…”

“Dammit, Mary…”
Victor closed his eyes, shook his head. “I’m in here, Pats,” he called out, struggling to conceal his irritation. It would be pointless to try to  hide from her anyway.
In a cutting voice, he added “And I am not using Violet the way you are using Patricia. Violet is actually… important to me. If she were to leave because she believed I was unfaithful, I would blame you completely for whatever could happen after she left.”
“Did Shez- errr… Sherlock say where he was supposed to take me?”
“Mmmmkay,” she mumbled, not really awake in the first place.
“What is it?” Violet asked as she removed the bullet from the chamber.
“Where does the extra help stay?” Sherlock asked with practiced boredom. “Surely not in that manky old boathouse.”
All that got him was a punch in the jaw. But mercifully he was left alone after that.
“Are you alright?” Mary kept her eyes on the road but she wasn’t able to keep the worry from her voice.
) and his curly hair was a bit longer than he usually wore it. But he wore one of his usual suits paired with an expensive dress shirt, the suit coal-black and the shirt dove-grey. His face, his stupid haughty face, was still abnormally white and odd-shaped, like an albino otter.
“Clearly,” Mycroft leaned back in the chair as if it was just as lavish and comfortable as a posh leather office chair. “What can I do for you, Mrs. Watson?”
Before he talked to everyone though, he spoke to his VP.
in German. Then she focused on holding on to the wires as tightly as she could.

take care of herself. “Just… don’t forget the gun.”
Instinctively, he opened his coat, (or at least, the right half, the half John was not clutching,) and wrapped it around John, to protect him from the elements.
The sun had just started to set when the tour was complete. Brilliant colors lit up the western sky. There was just enough light however to clearly see the lovely deck and patio, the luxurious patio furniture, the enormous and sleek grill and the showpiece of the back garden: a magnificent infinity swimming pool.
“Moriarty’s put the dog on for us,” Sherlock droned, following the rose petal trail.
He stuck his hand in his trouser pocket. Fingered the memory stick he had gotten from his little Swedish hacker friend.
“No, you just broke into his office to implicate him in a crime. God, John, you are such a filthy hypocrite! You’re just as much of a murderer and criminal as I am, as
“Holmes, Marshall here,” Deputy Director Barton Marshall of the Federal Bureau of Investigation tolled in his ear like a church bell at a funeral.
But the finale.... (will do my best to stay spoiler free...)
“And, um,” Violet blushed. “Maybe we shouldn’t make out in John’s chair?”
Lestrade let himself in and was surprised to see Molly sitting on the sofa, eating the strawberry shortcake she had meant to serve with tea after dinner tonight. She had been watching some black-and-white film but turned her head to smile at him. “Hi sweetheart, everything OK?”
“Oi? John? John Watson? Where are you?”
They didn’t care about him like he did either.
but she didn’t even have the strength for that simple sentence.
Instead, he said, “So after Harry took the piss out of me for losing yet another girlfriend, I broached the subject of her joining Sherlock and I on cases. It would be fun, I told her. It would help her keep her mind off the booze. Explained that her knowledge of the legal system would be an asset, a real help to us,” John smiled wanly. “What I failed to realize, or rather, Sherlock had deduced and I had ignored his deduction, was that Harry had fallen off the wagon. Again. So when I said that working cases would help keep her sober, she came unglued. Her response to my suggestion was that I needed to come out of the closet, shag Sherlock senseless, then get a real job, go practice medicine again instead of farting around on a stupid blog while chasing my boyfriend throughout London.” He snorted soundlessly. “Happy fucking Christmas.”
“But if they’re not calling it a gas leak…?”
Donovan ran her tongue over her teeth as she went over the timeline in her mind.
Then Honoré quickly stopped and whispered, “Hold up,” as he pointed with his torch.
“Big beefy bloke, bald, said his name was Henry or was it Harry? Not sure and I can’t remember his surname. A bit scary, tell you the truth,” Mrs. Algar admitted. “When I asked if I could read the warrant and where was my copy, he got a bit… curt with me. I know the property laws but…” she faltered then rallied. “But I stopped worrying about it when that nice, handsome D.I. came by the next day. Didn’t say nothing to him about the first copper’s visit. He didn’t stay long in Miss Donovan’s flat, less than five minutes, maybe. So, like I said, didn’t worry about it.”
“Just a mo’, Sig,” she brightly called back as she thrust Raffles into Sherlock’s unsuspecting arms. “Take him, won’t you?”
John had hoped he could read what the actual Letter said but to his profound disappointment, the writing was in French.
Instead of changing clothes however, she dialed Mycroft’s number.
“We have an understanding.”
Violet snorted. “At last, the reason for the attraction, he’s not

Blood stained Harry’s long strawberry locks, creating ugly russet tips. The navy had left her irises long ago, replaced with a patina of death.
“I was pretty sure I’d never see him again, but he showed up a few days later. I had left my coat in his car. Somehow he remembered where I had lived. It was this shithole in Hell’s Kitchen, back in the Nineties before gentrification hit the neighborhood, so it was… charming. Me and three girls squished into this disgusting one-bedroom apartment above a Laundromat that was never open with unreliable plumbing and cockroaches bigger than Golden Retrievers to boot.”
“Cinderblocks,” Mary retorted promptly.
Johnny nodded. “Thanks,” he whispered.
“Oh,” Mike said sympathetically. “That’s dreadful. Can I get you anything?”
Sherlock watched Violet’s face pale then turn gray.
For his mourners will be outcast men,
“I thought it was an actual letter-letter, not digital,” Honoré switched off his headlamp.
Sherlock, mercifully, looked like Sherlock. He was clean-shaven now but he hadn’t bothered to tame his black curls. He wore one of his usual designer suits and shoes, black, of course. He also wore a slim-cut white dress shirt that the Internet loved nearly as much as the Purple Shirt of Sex. But that had been before The Shooting, when he still had quite a bit of muscle he had built up during his Great Hiatus. Then he had lost a considerable amount of weight after The Shooting. In short, he wasn’t nearly as muscular as he had been over year ago. He had finally started putting a little bit of meat back on his bones this summer so the White Shirt of Sex still looked good on him. It just wasn’t as tight on him as it had been in the past. At least, the buttons didn’t look like they were going to burst off at any given second.
Tuesday afternoon
5:45 PM
He texted back to his MI-6 mole:
Eight feet tall, she stood on the edge of a ship’s prow, as if she had just touched down from her descent from Mount Olympus. Her drapery fluttered around her, as if facing a sudden sea squall. The lack of arms and a head did not detract from her power. In fact, in an odd way, it enhanced it. Besides, who needed arms when one had wings?  Enormous wings, like a great eagle, spread out wide. The wings sprung from the back of the headless woman’s body. One giant flap of those wings and the creature would be airborne again.
“Not in this neighborhood,” Sherlock mumbled but then inhaled. “What is that… reek?”
She complied and saw a slender, pretty girl with long, shiny blonde hair done up in a pony-tail pacing outside of 221B. She wore jogging clothes and well-worn trainers. She twisted her fingers in her hand, clearly dithering.
you’re doing anything productive these days
“You hated the old plan!”
She was just glad to have a weapon of some sort as well as to be wearing proper women’s trousers that fit correctly around her hips and thighs. She loaded the weapon, checked the sights, tucked it into the waistband of her trousers and pulled the t-shirt she had stolen at the restaurant over it. The slightly baggy man’s shirt concealed the gun. She also grabbed a pocket knife as well. Just as well.
“Because she’s your wife?”
Plan C – SH
He furrowed his brow,
“That’s true,” Molly, the cat-lover, looked relieved. “And I do need to get home to Henry.”
“That makes our game of
“Boring?” John squawked. “Embarrassing…. homopho-” His mouth dropped open as he realized what Sherlock just accused him of being. “I am most certainly
At two o’clock on the dot, he opened her hospital door. Carrying his ruddy umbrella and resplendent in one of his ruddy bespoke suits.

“Yes, I’m sure. The code, Violet.”
2 June 2016
many times during their trip. Many times, he had observed John sending the call to voice mail.
“Oh dear,” Mary rose and fetched a box of tissues. “It’s alright, it will be alright,” she patted the woman on the shoulder as she held out the box of tissues for her. Just then, Sweetie trundled out of the kitchen into the lounge to see what the fuss was all about. “We can help, really we can. Just tell us what happened and I’ll tell the boys. Effie will keep quiet, I promise.”
“Actually being considerate?” Violet supplied with a half-smile.
Both women’s faces were as white as snow and they carried their winter coats now that they were inside. They had both obviously dressed in a rush. Faded jeans and jumpers normally not worn outside the house. Mary wore an old jumper of John’s, the hems of the sleeves fraying. Molly had a spit-up stain on her cardigan, the one Lestrade liked, the one with the cherries. Molly’s shoulder-length auburn was tied back in a messy pony tail. Her soft doe-like eyes were wide with concern and worry. She had her arm firmly around Mary’s shoulders, as if she was afraid Mary would bolt at any given moment. Mary had made some sort of attempt to smooth her short platinum hair down but like Molly, hadn’t bothered with any make-up. Her cornflower eyes were glassy and her mouth was drawn tight.
What am I? – SH
“Oh my God,” Violet ran her fingers through her hair, damp and disheveled from melted snow. “You’re
“Don’t be, dear. We caught it right away. A little surgery, a little radiation, a bit of chemo…”
Susan rolled her eyes and nodded in agreement. “He can be such a bell-end.”
“Um OK,” John’s face was crinkled in complete bafflement while thinking
Violet reluctantly dug her Smartphone out of her jeans pocket. She thumbed in the pass-code and opened the camera roll for Sherlock. “I took pictures of the pictures in the order I saw them in,” she confirmed as she handed the mobile over to him.
Except this time, she did.
8:15 AM          Brush Teeth, Comb Hair, Dress
An MRI. An electromyogram performed by a young intern, poking her here and there with a needle electrode through her already bruised and battered skin to test the electrical activity of her muscles during contraction and at rest.
…Mary finished her sentence in her head.
“Wrong,” Sherlock boomed out from behind her.
She had practiced this speech with Sherlock on their drive from the hotel to the clubhouse.
“I was thinking… that I love you. And that I led you down a long hard road to get here…”
“Of course, of course” Mycroft demurred, paling as he sank back down into his uncomfortable seat. Hours later, the cheery-face nursed told him which room had been assigned to Sherlock. However, when Mycroft was walking towards Sherlock’s room, he nearly ran straight into, of all people, John Watson.
“You smell like rain,” Sherlock muttered, after he got his breathing under control. “Where did you go? Did you take a walk?”
“No,” Victor sawed him off angrily. He snatched up Sherlock’s (finally) empty mug.
12:34 AM
Violet looked down then lifted her eyebrows in surprise at the name on the Caller ID. “What the hell?” Violet Hunter snatched the mobile up, hitting the Answer button. “This is Violet Smith.”
“Sorry,” she breathed. As she dabbed polysporin over the cuts, she asked “Why didn’t you fight back when Greg started beating the hell out of you?”
“Wish that one would kick the bucket, the old cow,” Mitton said cheerfully. “But that’s neither here nor there. What’s the play, boss?”
But she had asked
This deflated Lestrade. He had hoped she would say Sherlock was climbing the walls, begging for a case from The Met.
The old lion smiled at her. “They said you were clever.”
The next picture she locked eyes on was worse, much worse.
“Go on.”
Meanwhile Mary whipped her head around so fast, her platinum curls spun around her head. “You tried to kidnap our daughter,” she hissed. “You killed his best mate from the Army, Sholto. You killed my sister-in-law, you nearly killed my husband. You’re threatening to kill our foster daughter. Why the hell do you think we’d want anything to do with you and your filthy cult?”
“Marie Devine has a tattoo of a butterfly. I assume you do as well? On your lower back?”
She took his pint and downed half of it. Putting the sticky glass on a nearby table, she slurred “Well, if you don’t want to drink, do you want to dance? Do you like dancing?”
“Assuming they find us,” Violet breathed.
“Like… children.”
And of course, now she was in Westminster, in snug little 221B.
If Mycroft Holmes was the type of man who uttered profanities, he would have let loose a torrent of them now. Instead he stood with his lips clamped tightly shut together. He knew what he had to do, but it was the last thing he ever wanted to do.
“Right,” John stood up and stretched his back. “So, Sherlock, what are we going to do first?”
Lestrade got up “Let me, it’s fucking painful for me to watch you struggle.” He took the lighter away from Sherlock and lit the cigarette for him. Then he lit one for himself and sat back down. “Yeah, well, these chats of ours are usually a huge inconvenience for me. All the bloody paperwork… and then all my paperwork disappears into a black hole. You’ve got an angel somewhere in the system, Mr. Holmes. The computers show this is your first offence, but we both know that’s not true, is it?”
“I promised you if you were ever in doubt or danger, I would come,” he quietly reminded her. “And I know you would do the same for me. You already have, you risked exposing who and what you really are at the restaurant when Janelle created that embarrassing scene.”
“Well,” Miss Smith finally switched on a lamp then pulled off her gloves. “Massages will have to wait until you are cleared of this crime.”
“But I’m not MI-6,” Violet purred. “I’m a nobody. I’m a
“Sorry?”
“I hate PTSD dreams,” John kept his voice light, conversational. “I think I hate them the most out of all the bloody symptoms.”
to get out of England, away from your fucking brother. You promised you could help me escape, but you didn’t. Jim said he could.”
And of course, there was always Moriarty to worry about. Always.
,” John happened to look down just as Sherlock unconsciously brought his hand to his chest, where Mary had shot him. “You… you need to stop that,” he pointed. “It’s a tell. You do that, touching your scar when you’re thinking about… when you’re agitated. Not that you have many, tells that is, but… yeah. And… you’re right, fuck you’re right.” John started scrubbing his mouth then his eyes widened, huge and horrified, “
She struggled to keep the disbelief out of her voice.
Holmes!” Doña Nalda cried out as Violet stood in the doorway. Her hand stilled on the knob as she stared incredulously at Professor Moriarty, who was placidly sipping coffee from a tiny cup. He looked ridiculous, wearing a Panama style straw hat, a Hawaiian shirt, khakis shorts, black socks pulled up to his knees and Birkenstock sandals.
he grabbed the headboard to steady them both.
“She let me behave like a complete arsehole for a few minutes. Then, cool as ice, she told me I could either help her find Maisie or she was going to look for her by herself. Then she said again, ‘It’s all or nothing, John. You made vows to me, I made vows to you. But I also made vows to myself: that I was never going to be
We must solve the case
“Your body language completely contradicts the words coming out of your mouth.”
Stunned, John blinked, as if she had slapped him. “OK. Here’s an idea. How about instead of ignoring me or biting my head off you just tell me what’s wrong?” When Mary didn’t answer, John looked at the pile of hospital records on his lap. “Did I do something to upset you, Mary?”
Or the most recent brain-teaser…
“In one piece, more or less,” Sherlock said. “Thanks to Gladstone, who is going to be fine, by the way,” he added quickly when he felt her baleful glare boring into him. “It was a clean shot, penetrated only fur and muscle. Bones are intact, no organ damage. John and Mary rode down to the vet’s surgery with him so he wouldn’t be alone.”
And by family, that of course included his very best friend, the eccentric and brilliant Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes. The finest and cleverest man John had ever met… and whom he wanted to smack about the head and shoulders from time to time.
“Is the fact that I am actively trying to clear your name with the FBI not penance enough?”
“But of course,” the chilly senior agent of MI-6 gave her a courteous little smile. “I need to have a word with Mr. Holmes anyway. Perhaps I could introduce you to him later.”
“They don’t have a kettle, Sherlock,” John explained for the tenth time as he brought the new plate of sandwiches into the lounge section of the great room and placed them on the coffee table. “And no more coffee or any kind of caffeine, your blood pressure is probably through the roof… are you alright? You’re not left-handed.”
For him, it was over-stimulating and exhausting. The bombardment of constant sensory overload threatened to drive him utterly mad.
Before he could ruminate more, there was a tap on the door. Then Mycroft let himself in as if he owned the building.
“I told you about the rumors about him… his predilections for little boys. He’s six years old, Edward. Do you really just want to leave him to the likes of Heathcliff Cullen-Culpepper?”
Violet in your own time.
29 April 2016
“I’m blubbering like a baby.”
“Start talking,” Violet had no sympathy or warmth in her voice. She highly doubted Julia cared about her sister.
12:25 PM
“Of course, I have pants on,” Sherlock lied, tossing Gladstone a slice of toast. The dog caught it, chomped twice on it then swallowed.
their
Violet started to rise and Dimmock shot out to help her up as if she were his granny needing help getting out of her rocker. Still, Violet appreciated the assistance. “Thank you,” she nodded. Then she tilted her head, studying the body again. “Why did she stop fighting once he got her into the master bedroom?”
Fetching his leash, Violet called for Gladstone. He bounded up and away from his seat next to Victor (much to Victor’s apparent relief). The dog happily trotted to his mistress, sitting like a good boy while Violet fastened the leash to his collar. “Nice seeing you again, Victor,” Violet made her voice warm and soft as her insides turned into a hard knot, straining and pulling. “And, in the future, please call me Violet, I insist.”
She recognized the little boy as Sherlock immediately, the shaggy black hair and the eyes of course. The old picture didn’t do justice to the chameleon-like irises but still it was undoubtedly him with those almond shaped eyes… and they were crinkled up in laughter, gazing up at the young man who held him adoringly.
Southside Chicago, Illinois
As Lestrade proceeded to explain that Violet Smith was actually Violet Hunter, an American federal agent in hiding because she was framed for crimes she did not commit, Mary blindly followed Dr. Sodhi down the hallway towards the recovery ward. She did not see the cheerful, inoffensive pictures on the wall, nor the nurses checking clipboards, nor the doctors checking their smart phones. She didn’t hear the wheels of a gurney squeaking on the floor or a concerned loved one asking the doctor the same question over and over, hoping for a different answer. She was deaf, dumb and blind to everything and everyone. She felt numb but not the comfortable numbness she felt right before a good kill.
she thought grimly as she ordered a beer. She sipped at it slowly, acting like she was waiting for someone. When enough time had passed, she batted her eyelashes at the bartender and asked if there was a phone she could use as she had lost hers and she had
“It was locked?” John scrunched up his fair silvery brows. “How?”
“That doesn’t exactly narrow down which member of Parliament you’re talking about, John” Mary sighed, now wanting to give John a good smack for being obtuse.
“Sweetie, come on, it’s almost time to go, get off the phone,” Violet whined, tilting her head towards the entrance.
Painfully remembered Ford…
Mary felt the awful panic building within her again. There was a time where she really had been Sherlock’s emotional doppelganger. Callous, unfeeling, cold. Had to be, when one was an assassin…
“Some, no, pardon wrong English word,” Dupin took his skull-cap off. John saw he had a deeply receding widow’s peak. What little hair he had was buzzed as short as possible. “
Sherlock and John looked at each other then at Dupin’s bare feet again. “And people say I’m odd,” Sherlock muttered before returning his gaze back to the multiple computer screens. He crossed his arms and puffed out an irritable breath. “Let the wait begin.”
He would still have to get from
… he deserved better.
Violet decided Sherlock Holmes was the only one in her world allowed to wink.
“Idiot,” he whispered to himself furiously as he jammed his hands into his coat pockets and followed John. When he caught up to John, he said in a perfectly normal voice, “It’s the attic suite we need to go up to, that’s where the letter was located.”
Donovan arched her eyebrow, again recalling her first meeting with the prim, bespectacled woman. Then she remembered how calm and collected Smith had been when she rescued Donovan from being blown to bits. “Obviously she’s not in the Met. What else was left out?”
“Not in the mood for your criticisms today, Myc.”
“Really? ‘Cause that sounded a lot like ‘Fuck you’ to me,” Honoré muttered.
“That’s a good friend of my boyfriend,” Violet Smith said lightly, putting her hand on her giant floppy straw hat. The hat served a dual purpose. It kept the sun out of her eyes and it hid her face and hair from the prying world. Coupled with a pair of giant sunglasses, only her nose and lips were visible. “He’s very nice. Come along.”
“I do not have a death-wish,” Sherlock’s voice was still cool and conversational but Violet saw the tiniest twitch of muscle in his cheek, a micro-expression of his that she recognized. An involuntary action that let her know she was getting underneath his skin.
“You first,” Sherlock had told Mary while they watched Toller skimming dead leaves off the surface of the infinity pool.
His text alert went off again.
hand-selected Alvar, as if he was the prize pup out of a litter of purebreds.” Violet deliberately paused before delivering the first of her deathblows. “Alvar had black curly hair.”
“Come with us,” Violet had said before she could help herself. “Back to London, you’re burning up from infection.  John can treat your back. He’ll keep his mouth shut.”
Victor looked up, at the ugly picture hanging over the hotel bed. Saw a reflection of a man in the picture frame glass… a man who was unmistakably and undeniably Mycroft Holmes.
“What?” Mary turned around… but she kept her arms around John’s shoulders.
Stirmon and Bevington were names of characters from the ACD canon story "Lady Carfax."
He took a step back, pulled out his mobile, pretending to be checking the address. In reality, he was checking the entire building, looking for any sign of life. A flutter of a curtain, a light being turned off.
Doyle, A. C., & Morley, C. (1930). The Sign of Four. The complete Sherlock Holmes. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday & Co.
Sherlock was fine with that… for now.
a question like that was would be Not Good. Instead, he had merely muttered to John he did say he had Three Ideas and that his daughter was alive was the Third Idea. Then, after observing how John lost what color he had in his face, he had forced him to join him in the basement to help him with the malfunctioning air conditioner. Miraculously, they got the monstrous old thing to start producing cold air again.
This shocked Violet then she remembered,
Dupin sighed. “You are ruining my Zen,” he reached for his boots as if he had all the time in the world. But he slipped them on and stood up faster than anyone had anticipated. Then he kicked the ruffian soundly in the face, breaking his jaw.
“Because I am brilliant, adventurous and slightly mad,” Sherlock thumbed through the file “The same as you… well… two out of three.”
“Mrs. Watson, I wish to have a conservation with you and that is all,” Mycroft laced his fingers over his belly, still studying her with his beady eyes. “As I would very much like to have a productive conservation, I shall lay all the cards on the table. I know your birth name was Anzhela
“I’m free to leave after tea, which means I don’t get out of that fucking house until five o’clock or so,” Violet had explained while Sherlock thumbed through the massive binder, reading about Edward’s likes and dislikes, food allergies and various vitamins and supplements he needed to take, what sports he was allowed to play, what brands of clothes he was allowed to wear, what kinds of fabric those clothes needed to be, what museums and parks Violet was allowed to take him to (schedule allowing of course), what television shows and movies he was allowed to watch, what music he was allowed to listen to and what books he was allowed to read.
Or pants.
Sweetie licked his hand in agreement.
She leaned back against her sofa, grinding her teeth as she tried to determine what she should do next.
Durhampton Hall
The Earl turned his mobile off with a self-satisfied smile and then tucked into his excellent pad thai that had the most succulent little shrimps he had ever tasted.  He had secured a table on the balcony with the most extraordinary view of the sky and sea. Blue fighting against blue.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow as Brother Morris approached.
Sherlock had released John and told Wiggins, “If I page you, that means run, understood?”
“To you it means nothing, but what about her?”
“We got a situation,” Agent Eduardo Lucas of Her Royal Majesty’s Secret Service crisply informed him. “How soon can you be in Paris?”
Violet’s eyes welled up as she threw her arms around the great big bald biker, “Thank you,” she whispered.
“No shit,” Sally snorted. “Most people would say that was an intended kill shot and your story about having astigmatism is bollocks.”
“He was writing a research paper regarding rigor mortis when he was performing supervised experiments on bodies donated to research,” John coolly corrected the egg-shaped man. “And I didn’t ask you. About that. I asked you that if, in your medical opinion  it is possible that some sort of pathology is at play, some sort psychosis that drives our killer into burning the bodies once he’s through with them.” He put his hands behind his back and stared Bodley down.
John frowned as he walked alongside Dupin back to the Volvo. He recalled what Violet had said about the former Interpol officer:
Still, he would love to go back to Charming for a long holiday, just to sit in the corner of the SOA clubhouse and
Sherlock exited the vehicle and disappeared into the rain without looking back.
Now, nearly eight months after that fateful meeting last March, she was bound more tightly  to the Great Detective than either one of them had anticipated.
There were one, two, three, four pips.
“Violet, what’s going on,” John fixed his sternest “Captain Watson” stare on her.
The Earl’s face crumpled up, now looking cartoonish instead of frightening. “I’d… hate for him to have his ears boxed?”
Mycroft turned his soulless black eyes onto Victor. “So this is how you repay my brother’s
“I didn’t say a word,” Sherlock muttered.
“But you can still call me if you think you’re about to fall off the wagon,” Lestrade said gruffly. “I mean it, I’m not joking. I mean, yeah, I’m mad as hell at you…really fucking pissed off, actually. But you died. For me.”
… but he’d be damned if he’d admit that fact to either John or Violet, especially while the pair of them wore quite smug expressions on their faces.
Feels, reveals and regrettably, John is a bit Not Good...
Sherlock shrugged. “The mole’s still in London. If that’s all, brother,” Sherlock lifted his bare feet  off the floor again and spun around to face his clippings and pictures on the wall.
Molly stood up and carefully kissed Mrs. Hudson’s forehead. “Have a little sleep, Mrs. Hudson.”
He had noted even Violet had been startled by Victor’s good looks, or at least she had been last night. On a superficial level, yes, she found Victor appealing as well.
“You’re going to stay right?” Susan lifted her head up, her pretty sea glass eyes wild and frightened. “You’re not going anywhere tonight, are you? Mary said you’ve been working a case with Sherlock and was staying at 221B but you can come home now, right? Please?”
Harry had definitely not been on her best behaviour when Violet had met her. Drunk and vindictive not to mention wallowing in self-pity, Violet had felt intense dislike for her after that disastrous confrontation. She had hoped John meant what he had said, that he never wanted to see her ever again. Selfishly, she had hoped she would never see her again.
Monday morning
He meandered down the hallway, taking his time now, his eyes flicking here and there, cataloging everything, missing nothing. He inhaled, smelt the polish used to make the floors shine and smelt the congealing leftover food underneath silver trays outside the doors. He heard the hum of the lights above him and an occasional burst of muffled French here and there from within the rooms.
Other than Afghanistan, New Zealand had been the furthest he had traveled. He thought the country charming, lovely and peaceful. He took thousands of snaps of shamrock green mountains and cuddly white sheep, looking like clouds with feet.
“Sounds like the perfect challenge for ‘Miss Smith.’” Spying the police file under his arm, she added, “He’s on the roof.”
To concede loss of the game.
2:25 PM
“Moriarty,” John breathed.
“Oh, I don’t care about that,
Her back to Jim and his crew and his hostage, Violet lifted her brows high and fixed her eyes on his. Sherlock received her message loud and clear:
“OK,” Violet stood up. “Let’s go meet Mickey.”
Violet kicked him under the table.
“He’s right,” Violet finally spoke again, her voice cracking. She shook her head and covered her face with her hand, unable to look at Sherlock.
John, of course, left out the bit regarding his gun. Even though he had the special permit issued by MI-6, his stint in the basement cell didn’t give him any reason to trust the local law enforcement.
good things
Mrs. Holmes brightened. “Yes, I am. I’m Lettie Holmes.”
Mycroft added the sugar and cream to his tea, stirred, wondered how much more to tell John Watson. Lifted his head, studied him.
Sherlock made a big show of crossing his arms and burrowing his chin into his scarf. He locked his eyes onto Gagnon’s face. While he glared daggers at Gagnon, Sherlock mercifully held his tongue.
Either way, she decided she would find her.
“I’ve already solved the case. We just need to find the girl.”
“I know this is a terrible inconvenience for you,” Violet continued with the “Miss Smith” voice, just in case Mrs. Hudson did decide to come back downstairs.
“He’s already a great man.”
“Yes, because you’re doing marvelously on your own.”
,” Dupin reached for a sandwich. “They are waiting on us. Noelie is particularly excited,” he added sourly, still unhappy about her role in this plot.
“Personally, I’m not such a great fan of gingers myself,” Sherlock snarled, shooting Violet a dirty look as she circled him, the gun constantly trained on his head.
“How unfortunate for her.”
“Great, thanks. That really clears things up,” John automatically reached to rub his left hand. When his right hand touched the plastic brace, he shook his head.
“I still
Remind me to murder Mrs. Hudson so she doesn’t blab to everyone what she walked in on yesterday.
After blinking his eyes to get rid of the grainy sensation (and failing,) he asked, “Is my father with her or is she alone?”
Wearily, he forced himself to stretch out his left fingers and rotate his wrist. He’d have to put the soft brace on when he got home. He probably was going to pay dearly for taking it off after leaving Sally’s bedsit, but he had wanted no hindrances.  As he massaged his fingers one by one, he was pleased to note that his poor hand was holding up rather well.
Then her childhood prayer came back to her in a rush…
Violet entered the building, her nose wrinkling. The interior was tidy, but dated. Ugly overhanging florescent illuminated the lobby. The walls were butter yellow and hideous olive-green and pumpkin-orange colored linoleum covered the floor. The plastic sofa was also olive-green. The potted plant in corner was also plastic. And the entire room smelt like Lysol and piss. Violet could only imagine the havoc the odor played on Sherlock’s super-sensitive nose.
“Charming,” John felt his stomach flop over, remembering Dupin’s offer of food. And there were extra towels in the oven…
This madmen kidnapping and killing girls had everyone spooked. And that nutty lady who assaulted Destiny hadn’t helped matters at all. Three girls quit on her when that story got out even though that particular customer had been put on The Black List.
“Good boy,” James pressed his forehead against Jim’s. “
“Of course,” Sally snorted with an eye roll.
28 November 2015
“Let your brother help you find Agent Hunter,” she told him flatly.
,” he  snapped, not worrying about waking John. He slept the Sleep of the Really,
“Please,” she sobbed, putting on a BAFTA award winning performance that would have impressed even Sherlock Holmes. Actual tears rolled down her lovely face.
“Excellent!” Sherlock beamed.
“You threatening us, missy?” Chibs chuckled, more amused than nervous. Most of the men chuckled, including Rat Boy. A few of the men leaned forward, assuming alpha-male poses, flexing their muscles, cracking their necks. Green crossed his massive arms over his barrel chest, wondering when exactly Tony’s sweet little girl stopped being so sweet.
“Oh, you’re going to be a grouch in the morning when it’s time to get up,” Molly groaned as she cuddled him while sitting down in the lovely white rocking chair Sherlock’s mother, of all people, had delivered to them on Christmas morning. The note attached said that “William” had always fallen asleep while being rocked while either she or Mr. Holmes talked to him. “Shall I tell you a story or shall we just have a little chat? Your dad’s better at getting you back to sleep than I am, though. But your dad is helping your other dad,” Molly explained then sighed. “Oh, this is going to be confusing when you get older.”
“No,” Violet said agreeably as Mary took out her gun and pointed it at his face, advancing on him. “But she will.”
Lestrade now studied her with the same intensity he had Sherlock earlier. He ran his tongue under his lip and over his teeth. “Don’t worry,” he finally muttered. “Your secret is safe with me,
“Of course, we haven’t discussed the subject of compensation,” Miss Smith continued blithely. “Not only can I help you launder the remaining dirty money you have from your criminal enterprises, but I can reimburse you for room and board as well, also a bonus if you can get me out of the country alive and in one piece.”
, Violet grinned to herself. She let Edward have his ten minutes of free time before Violet said, “Alright, Eddie, shall we work on some maths?”
“Obviously,” was the mildly amused reply. His voice was sleepy but still rich and resonant.
Missy snuffled and reached for a tissue from the box on her desk, “I really did try to protect the girls,” she sobbed before blowing her nose.
Despite their heart-to-heart, Violet still felt apprehensive about Mary, still felt like Mary wasn’t telling her the full truth.
“Well, you were just saying that you didn’t know how we were going to make it! It’s not like he gave us millions,” Mary’s cheeks flushed. “He gave us exactly the amount we’re short so we can catch up with the bills we’re behind on. No more, no less.”
He leaned forward, cupping her face in his hands as his tongue sought hers. Her hands raked through his hair as he now thought about how close he had come to nearly losing her tonight…
Then his heart froze when he saw Edward sitting on Sherlock Holmes’ lap, munching on a Nutella sandwich. Sherlock appeared to be engrossed in the music.
Too late he realized he had left his mobile on the big table in the lounge.
“I may not answer, but you may ask.”
“Well, hopefully it will be the last night, now let’s go,” John snapped again, his stomach knotting. He huffed and puffed as he swung the crutches in motion, following Wiggins at a fast clip.
“Clock’s ticking!” Chibs shouted after the trio as they bolted from the room.
“I told you monsters have their uses,” Sherlock purred then hung up on the Earl of Winchester.  Without even looking at him, he tossed the mobile to John. “Jimsie Browner has a job at Parliament, probably something menial, janitor most likely.”
“Who wants me out of the way?” John felt his heart rate speed up now as well. He threw himself into dangerous situations every case he had worked with Sherlock on. He had served his country by administering medical care under the most dire and hazardous of circumstances. This however, this situation was more frightening than he could have ever imagined. To have someone he adored, that he loved more than his actual sister (to be perfectly honest and perfectly heartless) to be killed and have that crime pinned on him. To be sent to prison for a murder he didn’t commit.
“Mirana good girl,” Doña Nalda gibbered in her broken English. She understood it well enough, but still had difficulty speaking it, especially while crying her eyes out. “
He also thought Seb looked an idiot, wearing a striped jumper and baggy torn jeans that threatened to slide off his arse at any minute.
,” Violet interrupted. She clumsily dug into her coat pocket with her left hand, having planned  for this moment before they even left for France. “Give me your hand.”
“I know,” Sherlock rumbled. Then he leaned forward, pressing those wonderfully long and elegant fingers against his face, right before kissing him lightly, chastely on the lips. Then he kissed John on both sides of his face before stepping back, giving John room to walk down the stairs. He picked up John’s luggage and held it out for him.
Violet crossed over to Clara, “You sure you want back into this?”
“Of all the reasons to fetch you, that would be the most idiotic,” Sherlock scowled.
“An ATM receipt. Showing the current balance in Jack Woodley’s offshore account, where all those millions of pounds that inconveniently disappeared last March are sitting. The interest rate kind of sucks but, what are you going to do?”
“No, Mycroft… this is positively medieval. You can’t…
,” John spat, rolling his eyes to high-heaven, immediately realizing Sherlock had performed one of his infamous disappearing acts.
He heard water running in the en suite. He deduced she must be cleaning her teeth since she had already showered and changed into his T-shirt and her yoga bottoms.
“Sugar, don’t worry, Mama’s working on it,” Annie had lied then handed Anthea off to Marie. “You’re right, she shouldn’t hear this. Go with the nice lady, Maud, be a good girl.”
Molly, despite herself, had softened. She patted Lestrade’s hand, the one resting on her baby bump. “Yes, I know. Come Greg, let’s go home,” she helped Lestrade totter off, deciding to hail a cab instead of trying to squeeze everyone into Mary’s tiny car.
“It was supposed to look like a drive-by, Ford,” Dupin rumbled as he had watched Sherrinford Holmes pace. Dupin had been on top of his game back then, so he was clean-shaven, wore a sleek black suit but no other jewelry other than a nice wristwatch and a wedding ring. "But a shooting victim had showed up at Emory Hospital that morning, burning up with fever. The bullet that had been removed from his shoulder matched the one from Annie’s gun. I don’t think gangbangers are usually Caucasian males from Bristol.”
“You first.”
“Grendalwald?” Violet arched an eyebrow.
His systems quickly came back online, detachment and logic already beginning to override lust and sentiment. There was no blissful post-coital haze for him, unfortunately. His first observation was they were both quite sticky and damp and this was unacceptable as well as uncomfortable. He gave her a perfunctory kiss on the lips and slipped out from underneath the tangled blanket, now drenched with sweat and sex. He also fished out his fleece pyjamas bottoms and bit back a curse as the chill of the secret flat hit him, his bare lower half breaking out in gooseflesh.
He steepled his fingers as he watched Violet make an egg-white omelet with mozzarella cheese. Mycroft would want his reward for saving Sherlock and the reward he wanted was trapped somewhere inside her head. Her mind palace…
,” she ordered him.
The number 8,549,176,320 is a
“I’m not lying,” Anthea shrunk away from Violet as much as she could. “I don’t know where the baby is and my orders to kill the nurse didn’t come from Mycroft.”
“Sleep-deprivation leads to mood swings,” Sherlock said sweetly. “I think you should practice what you preach my dear Violet and go to bed.”
“Oh?”
Rucastle noticed his son’s body language. His piggy eyes studied his son, then Violet. Then  rumbled, “I see… well then, Miss Smith, tell me about my son’s day, please,” he took a dainty sip of his tea then reached for a fairy cake. Then he ate all the fairy cakes while Violet spoke, leaving none for anyone else.
“Oh good, progress,” Violet said flatly.
“Quite ill, but nothing fatal,” John nudged Gladstone with his toe so he would get out of his way. Gladstone made a
A strong grip or stranglehold on a position that is difficult for the opponent to break.
“I shall,” he hissed at her.
On that same day, John and Sherlock had one of their worst fights ever. So bad, John had actually screamed at him he wished Sherlock would have
visited you in hospital. I saw what Magnussen did to you; that’s motive for murder right there.”
Lisbeth peered at the screen and grunted in approval. She had hacked into the hotel’s security cameras so the feeds would come directly to her computer. She tossed her wig onto the coffee table and started taking off her gold earrings. She looked down and saw Violet curled up in Sherlock’s lap, her face slack with sleep, yet still troubled.
… with anger…
“I went to Appledore for
Violet thought, suppressing a frown.
“Ah, that’s useful,” Wiggins said lamely.
“Ooh, that is cutting it close,” she breathed as they started to break away from the cheery crowd and to make their way up to the abbey. “Are we sure they aren’t already here?”
“Splendid. Chinese?” Sherlock actually stood up, slamming the laptop as he did so. “Order extra dumplings,” he slid the laptop across the table to John. “You can order online at Panda Oriental now. Miss Dobney could use a feeding up, don’t you think?”
“It was never proven that the Cullen-Culpeppers tampered with the brakes to my aunt and uncle’s car,” Sherlock placed his chin on his pointer fingers. “They weren’t even suspects. The Old Earl and Countess of Winchester had been absolutely distraught when my aunt and uncle died. They even offered to adopt Ford, although I suspect it was because they thought Ford was the heir apparent. They were wrong. It was my father. He inherited the lot, the real estates, the businesses, the fortune and Ford, of course. My parents were absolutely delighted to adopt Ford. They had always wanted a large family. But Mother had difficulties conceiving Mycroft and there were at least two miscarriages before me. So they saw Ford as a blessing. Mycroft and I saw Ford as our brother, not our cousin. And we
“We’re supposed to meet tonight,” Violet had started to look at her watch, only to remember she had taken it off and left it at Baker Street. “Sherlock’s out of town for a case and he asked me to relay some deductions he had for Greg on a different case.”
Tuesday evening
“And you say my pillow talk is terrible,” Sherlock pouted as John planted a kiss on the offending hip bone before tugging his shorts down even further.
Now Bill shivered, as if the air dropped twenty degrees. “I didn’t know she made pot brownies until I scarfed down two of ‘em and she squawked at me,” he grumbled. “I talked to my sponsor and he said that don’t count for falling off the wagon but I had to do more meetings and ask Mrs. H before eating anything of hers.” He grinned nervously, “You might want to talk to her, like… intervention-style? The shit she had baked? I was seeing sounds, Shez.”
Sherlock grudgingly agreed, recognizing that John needed to get out of the house and away from
Other than wrinkling his nose and furrowing his heavy brows, Sherlock didn’t respond.
19 December 2015
with only her right hand.
From the minute he stepped foot into his own home to now, Mary had been a pillar of support. She hugged him and kissed him, of course, when he first got home. But she did not cling to him, sensing he needed his space. She encouraged him to talk, but did not press. She grew teary-eyed when she saw the bruises on his face from being punched in the face at the Paris prison, and then again when she saw the cut on his shoulder and the bruises on his back from the Catacombs, but she did not lose her composure. She fielded the telephone calls he did not want to take. She wrote a nice little entry for the blog, asking for privacy in this most painful time, but had first asked John for his permission to upload the post, after he read it, of course.
“Do you think he ran away?” Violet asked. “We can look for him if he’s lost. Make posters. Knock on doors and ask if anyone has seen Little Carlo.”
“Violet, do stop fussing,” Sherlock ground his teeth.
Mary still refused to lower her weapon. “Why?”
The fog had dissipated. She unlocked her door and nudged it open slightly with her toe. She pointed her gun straight ahead as she opened the door wider.
John blindly searched for a foothold as he tried to climb up towards Sherlock while the plane continued to plummet. There was an awful clatter as the oxygen masks deployed. Dimly John could hear the frantic shouts from the pilot and co-pilot over the din caused by unidentified obnoxious beeps and irritating alarms. The plane itself shook mightily as it continued its descent towards The English Channel, as if it would completely fall to bits before it even hit the water.
” she snapped at him as Mary yelled at him, “Sherlock! Shame on you!”
Alex knew exactly what she was going to hear and it wasn’t going to be good.
Impassively, Sherlock watched as the paramedics rushed her towards the ambulance. The glowing rush from solving the case was already starting to fade, but he still felt pretty damned pleased with himself. A half-smile crooked his heavy Cupid’s bow lips.
“Is breakfast at least a proper fry-up?” Mycroft couldn’t keep the whine out of his voice. “If I go down there and see only tea and porridge, I’m going straight back to bed and locking the door.”
“I’m not sure. I think it was cathartic, that it was good for him that this bullshit with Jim Moriarty and Richard Brook is finally over. But then again, he’s not sleeping so...”
Rucastle and his son were alone in the house with Sherlock, Mary and Violet.
Sherlock closed his eyes, stumbling blindly until it was his back hitting the door jamb now. His arched his neck back, starting to pant while Violet nibbled and kissed his throat, lapped at his earlobes, first the left then the right, then finding his mouth again, her tongue meeting his this time, all the while massaging him through his pants, her hand stroking him in the most toe-curling, delightful ways in no predictable pattern, only slowing down just when he thought he was about to go over the edge.
When being Violet’s punching bag finally bored him, he twirled her around as if they were dancing, but held her tight, her back against his chest. He crossed her wrists over each other, effectively restraining her. “Do try to pull yourself together,” he murmured into her ear.
Secondly, I just had a MAJOR heart attack. As I was in the process of typing up my chapter notes, I got the Blue Screen of Death and my computer crashed. Fortunately it started up right away and nothing was lost, but still... GAH.
Paris, France
“Victor was a mistake.” Sherlock said evenly. “The Work overshadowed all my personal relationships. I never met anyone else who made me feel the same as John did… until you.” When Violet swallowed hard and turned to study the trains again, he demanded softly, “Look me in the eye and tell me if Jordan had walked back into your life right now, could you say no?”
“’Course we can,” Mycroft said as he pulled his own pyjamas on. “Already got one picked out so crawl in. The torch and the sweets are under the pillow. I’ll be there in a second.”
Fine – MMW
Astrologically, I see that Saturn is in Leo.
“And?” John prompted him. “What did Violet say about the ‘new’ Moriarty?”
Violet reached over and picked up the notepad. This time she read to herself:
As they worked, John opened up Pandora and turned the speakers of his laptop as loud as they would go. Currently, The White Stripes blared out:
“Go to Barts.”
“Any requests, Your Majesty?”
Lestrade had given John a nervous glance then all but ran to corral Sherlock, with John and Sergeant MacDonald in tow. “Sherlock,” Lestrade hissed at his friend and colleague. “We’ve been over this. In fact, I got another nasty phone call from your brother about this. You need to leave the Earl alone. His involvement is being handled by MI-5.”
“Irrelevant,” he kept his voice down. Always mindful of his surroundings, Sherlock knew the restaurant was nearly deserted and the waiter and maître’d were no threat. Still, one never knew who was about to walk in and interrupt a perfectly good conversation.
He paused in the stairwell and allowed himself to slip into his Mind Palace for a moment, wander down its halls to find the purple door. He cracked it open and saw Violet watching telly while lying on the sofa, with Gladstone’s head in her lap. He knew exactly where this memory came from. It occurred shortly after The Copper Beaches Massacre, while she was recuperating from being poisoned by Mrs. Toller. The sunlight glinted off her long, chestnut curls. She had no plans on leaving the flat, so she hadn’t bothered with the “Miss Smith” disguise. She wore one of his white dress shirts over a periwinkle camisole top and black yoga pants. She looked tired, but she didn’t look ill, not like she had in December. She leaned down to snuggle Gladstone and he licked her cheek with his long, pink tongue. She wiped the drool away with the back of her hand before scratching his black, cropped ears. As she did so, she laughed at whatever she was watching. Probably a stupid American film or program; she had tended to seek out American films or programs when she felt nostalgic.
“You’re most definitely correct about that,” John grinned.
“Mm, yeah,” John nodded, his face serious, “I was bitten last summer. Hurt like hell.”
Violet however, continued to glare at Brother Morris. Then she fluttered her eyelashes at him as she informed him sweetly, “Now this precious FBI agent would like to know exactly what the fuck you’re doing here.”
“Jesus Christ,” Rat Boy gripped the steering wheel tightly now. “You mean,” he shouted at Lisbeth, “This wasn’t a for sure thing?”
John dropped his hand from his eyes, thunderstruck.
He looked around the hall. It was a modest sized hall, but it seemed to be bursting at the seams. John would call that a Good Thing. Sherlock knew because it would make Lestrade and Molly feel loved that  so many people came for their Special Day.
Rucastle’s laugh was a booming, hearty sound. “My dear woman, I work in the fashion industry. I know a pair of poofs when I seethem. It’s not your fault, you were blinded by love,” he ran his thumb over Mary’s cheek. “I want to save you. Save you from all your enemies and from yourself. Your delusion about your marriage,” he pressed his wet, blubbery lips to her forehead. Mary squirmed, tried to escape, but he was so much bigger than she was.
When Sherlock didn’t immediately respond, Violet had seriously thought he might have had a stroke and died right there outside the bathroom door.
She had frozen, key in her hand, her heart pounding. Slowly, she had started backpedalling down the hallway. As she crept away, she had stuffed the key back into her pocket and drew her gun. She pointed it at her apartment door, her breath shaking and unsteady, heart racing. She kept her gun pointed at the door until she rounded the corner.
John felt Sherlock stiffen next to him.
Thursday evening
“Mm,” Sherlock fixed his eyes on her, never blinking.
“Oh good,” Molly said while thinking she needed to tell Greg they should postpone their much needed chat with Sherlock by at least one more week. As if on cue, the baby started kicking. Molly ran her hand over her belly and again struggled to her feet. “If I get any bigger, you will all be rolling me down the hallways like a ball.”
“Stop it, you’re not dead yet,” she ordered herself as she slid off the bed.
“I know, I know, I’ve just… it’s just that… you see… oh Greg. I’ve been so naïve, so… so
“Sherlock, as delicious as this sponge is, I do have other tasks to attend to; I would appreciate it if you picked up from where you left off.”
For his antics at the lido today, Edward had been banished to the kitchen. He had to sit at the kitchen table with only Toller for company until tea time. Then, once she finished dolling Violet up, Mrs. Toller would be in charge of the boy until bedtime.
When Mary didn’t immediately answer the redheaded woman sighed and took off her glasses. Then Violet Hunter told Mary, “I can’t help you if you keep lying to me, Mary. Why does Mycroft hate you enough to kidnap your child?”
John was solid and practical, not inclined to juvenile pettiness…
Mycroft looked like he wanted to slide underneath the table and die of shame.
“Are you a Consulting Grammar-Nazi now?”
“Not your body. Here,” he reached over the car seat and pressed his finger against Sherlock’s forehead. “You need to learn to quiet and calm
“And here come the Cullen-Culpeppers,” Violet said darkly.
“Give what I gave you to Mrs. Watson,” Mitty said softly, his dark eyes darting around everywhere, checking to make sure no one was too interested in their conversation. “Then stay the hell away from her. Make sure the rest of the Network does too.”
“Alright,” she turned to open a plastic storage container. “This might require something stronger than tea.” She took out two plastic tumblers meant for beach parties and a glass bottle of Johnnie Walker Black. Holding up the bottle, she informed him, “No ice.”
“Milk’s probably gone bad,” John grumbled but he crossed over to the kitchen anyway. Opening the tiny fridge, he hummed in surprise when he discovered that Sally had bought groceries three days ago, so the milk was still fresh. Searching for a kettle, he asked, “So, what are we thinking about? How we’re going to catch Peters?”
Sherlock  only smiled. “This is now mine,” he patted the silvery, thin computer. “And this,” he pointed down to the gym bag he stood on. “Did you really think I wouldn’t notice you had nicked pages out of our files?” He examined his nails in an exaggerated manner. “Oh, I do think the police would not be pleased if you stole evidence from an ongoing investigation.”
4:00 PM
Wiggins’ face shone with perspiration but he didn’t move a muscle. Even the gun steadied in his hand. His Adam’s apple bobbed in his throat and John didn’t blame him. His own mouth had gone quite dry as well.
At the top of the stairs leading to 221B however, he hesitated. Drumming his shortly-clipped fingernails on the banisters, he vacillated. He longed to go inside and dry off then sit in his chair in front of a roaring fire. But he hadn’t called or texted. Sometimes Sherlock didn’t like company… no. Scratch that. Sherlock never liked company, unless it was a client with an interesting case. He hadn’t been joking when he had informed John he could go days without speaking. When they used to live together, whenever Sherlock had suffered one of those fits of ennui, John had felt like an unwelcome interloper. Sherlock later explained to him that being surrounded by so many stupid people at one time drained him. The silence recharged him. “Helps me think,” he had added as a postscript.
“Violet…” Mary’s voice shook horribly. “Please. I can’t…”
She jumped a little when Mary returned to the room with a bowl of crisps and a platter of sandwiches. “Sorry for the poor fare,” she apologized, setting the food down on the coffee table. “Wasn’t expecting guests.”
“Clara and I are getting married,” Harry blurted out.
“Right,” Wiggins stood up and brushed dirt off the seat of his trousers. “Did he say where he thought the girl was then?”
Moriarty, the one really in charge.”
“Please,” Sherlock said witheringly. ”He inhaled more coke than I ever did. Back in his glory days, he would have shamed Ozzy Osbourne with all the drugs he did. Then there was the cross-dressing and all the sex he had. Men, women, it didn’t matter to Uncle Rudy. There were even rumours about animals.”
of them. Besides, better me than him to join, don’t you think? I’ve formally trained in law enforcement, I have a unique perspective of the criminal world and I’m… well,”
It hurt.
Then he looked around and shuddered.
He stuck his head, turtle-like, from out underneath the covers and found himself nose-to-nose with Gladstone, Violet’s Alsatian, or as she called him, her German Shepherd.
“Does she have the Moriarty Code?”
Violet patted Lestrade’s upper arm and said softly “You’re welcome,” while thinking
John had been so nervous about his hearing he’d opted to take the train the previous night to Manchester. Selfishly, he’d also had wanted to be alone. He wanted quiet, he
“Yeah,” His face scrunched up as he scratched his cheek. “Some eye-witnesses said they thought they saw some sort of ear piece, like a Bluetooth in her ear. They think she was talking to someone on the phone as she followed Moriarty and the kid.”
“Oh yes. Despite his girth, Mycroft loved being outdoors, still prefers the country to the city, actually. When he was younger he loved it all, fishing, hiking, boating, archery. I would always want to tag along but Mycroft always shooed me away. ‘You’re too little, William, go home William,’” his voice suddenly took on the cadence of a petulant prepubescent boy.
, John had clean forgotten what little he had learned in secondary school. But he had never been any great shakes at languages. He had always gotten his lowest marks in French when he was a schoolboy. He knew Latin by-proxy because of his medical training and he had learned enough Pashto to scrape by during his time in Afghanistan.
Violet fixed him with a sullen look. Then she poured a quarter of her drink down her throat.
Sherlock put the sweaty glass on the windowsill then crouched in front of the piano bench, flipped the lid open and removed loose pages of sheet music one by one (Violet’s doing, to his annoyance. She didn’t like turning pages when she was learning a new piece of music…)
“Oh…” Molly swallowed. “It’s time, this… this is really happening,” she said again, awkwardly sliding off her seat. “Do… do I look OK?”
Violet had also jumped and gasped when John fired the weapon, crying out, “
He felt terrible. His head throbbed and his body ached, as if he was suffering from a bad bout of flu. But while his throat was dry and scratchy, he did not feel nauseous, just incredibly tired. He could have easily fallen back asleep but he desperately wanted a glass of water.
“Against my better judgment, go. Anthea will meet you,” Mycroft produced his mobile and started texting. “The guards are aware I’ve given you clearance. But first,” he eyed her dirty jumper and jeans. “Put on the clean clothes that were provided for you.”
Mary looked up from the textbook Sherlock had borrowed from Molly. “Oh, good morning,” she gave him her patented “Everything is Lovely” Mary Morstan smile.
But it irritated him greatly whenever Sherlock and Violet would switch from English to German or Spanish when they wished to speak about something they didn’t want John to know about.
“Full stop,” he ordered himself, stuffing his gloved hands into his coat pockets.
“She still believes in truth, justice, the American way and all that patriotic rubbish,” Sherlock snorted. “Since she barely escaped with her life once again, she had no intention of testifying in open court. She elected to have the Senator tried in the court of public opinion instead.”
“Stop… you just asked me… that…” John blinked, trying to catch up, knowing he was on the outside of some joke. “Would I… what… I… hang on, is that the same ring you gave Janine?”
John nearly blurted out, “Molly Hooper,” but then remembered she lied about Sherlock’s “death” for two years and was currently lying about the paternity of her son. So he merely balled his fists and vowed to tell Sherlock the first chance he got about this latest development.
“I will when you will,” John retorted sweetly then frowned. He scrolled back up, “Hang on…” he licked his lips, the old tic back in full force. “His Achilles tendons had been severed.”
Sherlock had been right, the first thing Jim attacked was Sherlock’s appearance, “Oh my God, I love it. I just love it, the ginger.” He crooned. “I mean, the black was so
His mobile, tucked into the back pocket of his jeans, whirred just then. Violet withdrew her hand as Sherlock reached to retrieve it. “Speak of the devil,” he gave the mobile the same sour smile he gave Violet seconds ago. He answered, still using the American accent. “Hello?”
She turned off the light in the master bathroom and headed back towards the lounge.Since she couldn’t sleep, she decided to do some more research into Jepthro Rucastle’s second wife, the lovely but apparently vapid “Trixie Holiday.” Violet shut the bathroom door (so Gladstone wouldn’t go in and drink from the toilet) and turned to go back to the lounge when she heard a soft, piteous moan from Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Fine, well, no. Not fine, but getting better.” Violet debated for a moment. “His medical license did get suspended. Three months.”
As Sherlock slipped out of bed, John sat up, “No, wait, I’m sorry,” he switched on the small lamp on the night stand. “Please, I know you’re angry bu-”
“What?” John asked.
John held onto his mobile as he crossed his arms. “So, where are we going?”
If she wasn’t so useful, not to mention valuable, Mycroft would have contemplated killing Violet.
Then Sherlock looked down at his mobile again, “Working on it.”
Her “I am a Federal Agent” voice.
“Yes,” John said immediately, swiftly followed by a “No. Of course not. I love Mary.”
Green ran his hand down his face, his mind reeling. He first ran his hand over his bald head then down his black moustache.
. And he’s more useful to them as a respectable member of the House of Lords  than as a disgraced and imprisoned child defiler.”
“Not Mycroft,” Dupin stuck a finger up in the air. John wished he would keep both hands on the steering wheel. “If Bill Wiggins had to trick Mycroft, this would have been over with before you and I left for Lausanne.
Wednesday night
necks!”
He made a mental note to try to be kind to Violet tonight. She was suffering through this ordeal not because she liked tight dresses and uncomfortable footwear. She went undercover as a favor to him.  So again, he owed her. She would need a bit of kindness tonight.
“When did you talk to Maggie Jenner?” Violet suddenly wished she hadn’t lowered her weapon.
“No. Not that…before… why didn’t you call me when you felt the trigger. And for God’s sake, sit down, you’re making me nervous.”
“Yes, Sherlock texted me.”
“She seems nice,” Violet said lamely.
She leaned back in Sherlock’s chair as Gladstone sat next to her feet. She smiled at her dog and stroked his soft, warm fur.
“Oh, don’t worry, I wouldn’t ask you to be a hired gun. I was thinking about the cost of replacing the carpet plus a little bit additional to buy new furniture. But I do want to hire you, both of you.”
The following day, Violet had nursed a raging case of laryngitis and Sherlock had alternated between moping and fuming. Mrs. Hudson had kindly volunteered to take Gladstone to the emergency veterinarian clinic since no one was really sure the effects eating a tarantula had could have on a dog.
Then he frowned, noticing that he had three missed calls from Mary. In a row.
And thank you thank you thank you for sticking with this fic, even though I'm doing drive-by postings and haven't had a chance to properly reply to comments (I do love all your comments and kudos though!)
“OK then, at least we know where we stand then,” he said, the joking and flirtatious demeanor gone now.
She pressed her fingertips to her lips, closed her eyes then heaved a huge sigh.
Her hand over her eyes, her handbag now clutched in her arm like a beloved dolly or teddy, her shoulders shook as tears coursed down her face.
“Have a sleep,” Violet advised him. “There’s a prepaid mobile underneath the bed.”
But she found herself remembering… how she found him, strung out in the old candy manufacturing warehouse, strung out of his mind…
Tonight, Irene claimed she had an upset stomach and opted to take a cup of tea and a stack of unbuttered toast to her room instead. Violet had been too engrossed in her work to notice her disappearance until an hour after Irene had gone.
“Sherlock… John… oh my God!”
the time to think about all the horror movies that start with two stupid women getting lost in the dark alone…
Violet looked up at a wreck of a tree-house, left to suffer the torments of the elements for years and years. It was more of a shack than a house. A remnant of a swing dangled desolately from a thick branch. “That doesn’t look very sturdy.” She furrowed her brow as she looked at the boards that had been nailed into the trunk of the tree to create a ladder. “Are you sure the microfiche is up there?
Sherlock groggily propped himself up on his elbows then sank back down onto the pillows. Then he jostled himself awake. “No, I can’t. Loads of work to do, I mus-”
“And Paris has been rebuilding,” Mycroft informed John.
Somewhere in London
Hurt that he had been rebuffed, Sherlock had slinked off to sulk in his bedroom. His childish pout devolved into righteous anger when he realized that John had misinterpreted his offer, had thought Sherlock was trying to trick him into an experiment. Maybe he even thought he was making a pass at him, even after only weeks prior to that he had explicitly explained to John that he was married to his Work… but John hadn’t been observing as usual…
“Then it would be over,” John breathed, getting up as well “Truly and for real over.”
inside his head, aren’t you?”
Violet’s eyes fluttered open. For a moment all she saw were bright colors, reds and blues in an old-fashioned Victorian pattern. Her head ached so she closed her eyes again.
We have the doctor.
The picture showing on the iPad screen was not just clearly Violet, but obviously Violet Hunter. No make-up to hide her freckles. No fake glasses to hide her eyes. Her chestnut curls framing her panicked face. No hat or hood or scarf covering her head.
“Blackmail,” Violet said faintly.
1:48 AM
to play.”
“Most children like to be touched. Hugs and kisses. Ruffling the hair. Most parents begin their nonverbal communication with their babies by tickling their bellies.”
After escaping those psychopaths, she had holed up in a hotel, evaluating her options.
He guided his youngest son into the house, gave quiet instructions to his wife after he led Sherlock to his old bedroom. He let his wife fuss over Sherlock as she tried to get some fluids into him at least. Sugary tea and beef broth. Tomorrow, a simple porridge for breakfast, soup for lunch, supper, some sort of custard. Soft foods, high caloric foods.
Violet blew a stray curl off her forehead. “Didn’t bring a gun, did you? Thought you could handle a
Victor laughed. “Seriously? Sherlock? You never shut up.”
“So this was the mature way to handle it? By making a bit of money off of a load of codswallop while he is in pain? Shame on you, Janine Hawkins.”
He could feel Lestrade studying him, staring at his dirty, unkempt curls. He tried to remember the last time he had properly bathed. He realized, almost ashamed, he didn’t care.
That sobered John, “You think Mycroft has a case?”
For the first time that morning, tears blurred his vision.
It's the calm before the storm...
Softly, she sang to herself as she walked down the stairs to her foster daughter…
Other men would have dismissed their wives’ demands for a future discussion. They would have just say “Yes dear,” then endeavored to forget their wives’ requests. Not Greg Lestrade, he knew better. He had never made the error so many others had. He never underestimated Molly. “Yes, we will. After we know for sure both John and Mary are out of the woods, then we’ll have a proper talk. But first,” Lestrade couldn’t stifle his yawn. “Come back to bed.”

“Mm, no, I think he had arrived at that particular destination all by himself,” Sherlock took another step closer towards Toller and Mrs. Hudson. “Besides, you really didn’t do your research, did you?”
John’s blood ran cold.
, she thought vehemently.
“Wow, thanks,” John said dryly.
“Jesus,” Victor said. “Nothing I say to you, none of it has sunk in, has it?”
“You know I hate you, right?” John had joked right before Sherlock left, “Getting to lounge around a posh house all day while I hang out with the mice and spiders.”
A game she lost, since Mary had killed her in the end.
“Sherlock,” Bill was good and irritated now. “I told you. I can’t fucking learn how to play the violin in less than two weeks.”
“How can you tell?” Violet asked rubbing her stomach, still feeling ill from the martini.
Victor decided to have a word with Seb as soon as possible. “Ignore him, he’s a twat.”
“There’s an electric kettle,” he rumbled, still fumbling with the bandages. “I can make coffee but it will be instant I’m afraid. Or boil water for a Pot of Noodles or soup in a cup.”
“Susan? Who’s Susan?”
Mary had tightened her grip around the memory stick, “Whatever you have been told-”
“Kill Moriarty,” he had told her this morning after delivering John to the boathouse and before they went to play mind games with Toller. “Can you do that for me?”
Right now Rucastle gazed adoringly at his son and smoothed the child’s hair back. “I’m OK with adventures, as long as you,” he tapped Edward on the nose. “Keep” he tapped Edward on the nose again “Being” and again. “Good,” and he pinched the boy’s nose then stuck his thumb between his pointer finger and middle finger. “Ha! What’s this? Got your conk!”
Sherlock swiveled his head to look at the chestnut-haired woman leaning against the doorjamb.
Finally Violet Hunter spoke up, “Hell no,” she rasped. “We bury them. All of them.”
he admonished the imaginary Violet as he caught up with Sherlock and Dupin.
She checked her watch. The other rooms wouldn’t require as much attention as a bathroom did. Just a good wipe-down and vacuuming, then deposit the vacuum bag and garbage bag into the dumpster. Then she’d take a shower. Wipe the tub down again while making sure there was no hair in the drain. Change into fresh clothes and call Uber. She’d take one more bag of trash to the dumpster and not look back.
