Steve’s POV
“Bruce..?” It was barely audible through the door, but the rest of the tower was quiet. With that one word, Steve could hear the sorrow and broken heart. His own heart hurt for Tony.
Hearing Tony defend Steve was just making him for angrier. How dare Steve say those things knowing what he knows about Tony’s tendency to self blame? “Is that the excuse he gave you so that you would dump him?! That’s bullshit Tony. We’re going to go upstairs. I’m going to tear Steve a new one. Then you’re going to realized that everything you’ve just said is a lie and if Steve is still alive, you’re going to talk this out so that you two will stop moping and be happy again, okay?” Bruce demanded. The only thing that held him back from changing was the need to finish the current discussion.
“Oh, Thank God!” Steve gasped. A darker more insecure part of Tony couldn’t help but think that Steve probably wouldn’t have cared as much if he’d seen Tony just drinking himself to the point of black out, because it wouldn’t have been Steve’s fault then. It would just be Tony being broken, being an alcoholic.
Steve only buried his head into Natasha’s shoulder harder. Natasha turned to Clint with a look that clearly said,
“There’s no reason to explain Capsicle. I get it. I mean I’m always screwing up, and a pain, a totally selfish asshole especially to those I care about, incapable of considering other’s feelings.” He paused for breath. “I’m just a deeply damaged person. Not even a superhero can put up with that for long.” Tony couldn’t look up to meet Steve’s face, but raised his vision to stare distantly at Steve’s chest. He can do this. Just a little bit longer and he could crawl back to the bottle.
“How can you be so thoughtless!?” came Bruce’s voice from inside the elevated. He seemed enraged but was trying to keep himself together by not talking to loudly. He was coming towards them fast.
“How are you feeling Sweet pea?” Steve inquires as he give Tony a small peck on the lips.
. So Steve began to pull out when Tony started hacking when some of it went down the wrong tube and a lot of it was overflowing from his mouth. Which subsequently resulted in Steve painting Tony’s face with the rest of his cum. He dropped his grip on Tony who dropped face first onto the ruined sheets and then Steve proceeded to flop onto his back still breathing hard.
Bucky suddenly threw himself at Steve and held him in a hug. “Oh Steve I could kiss you.”
degree burn. Dammit. Bruce pushed the mug out of Tony’s reach so it would cooled down more before focusing on Tony again. “How are you holding up? Tell me what happen…” Bruce hesitated before amending. “I’m here if you want to talk about it.” He didn’t want to force Tony into anything. Plus, the last time Tony had tried to talk to him, he’d fallen asleep. In his defense, he’d just finished an all nighter in the lab that he hadn’t told Tony about, because despite his own hours poorly kept hours, Tony was a nag about Bruce getting enough rest. Plus, he’d been away from people for so long, he’d been really rusty at comforting people. Natasha had given him a few tips since then, so he at least felt like he could handle the current situation. However, it would be understandable if Tony wanted to talk to someone else. Thus, Bruce also quickly added “Everyone on the team is here for you if you want to talk about it.” which at least seemed to calm Tony down some.
Through the hurt, understanding poured through and it light up Tony’s spirit and soul or whatever he had in that arbitrary space. He could do this. He needed to do this. For Steve. For the team. For His Family. This was the closure that he needed. He could accept the situation and move on.
“I… Okay, but I might come find you if it takes too long.” Steve warns almost with a small hopeful smile. In that moment Tony knew that Steve wanted to rekindle their friendship as well. This wasn’t the end of them, and Tony found comfort in that fact. It seems though that Steve is expecting it to be a lot sooner than Tony thinks he can do, but Tony knew he’d try his best and push hard through it all. For Steve. Always for Steve.
As the 3 of them sat down he noticed an empty chair. (Actually 2 empty chairs but he didn’t want to think about that right now).
“Steve. Be nice.” Tony’s voice was small but clear. He looked up at Steve from his place on his lap where he’d slipped to when Steve sat up. Tony made no move to get off of Steve’s lap though.
Apparently that was all it took because Steve then looked up at him sheepishly and a bit guiltily although not nearly as guiltily as Bucky thought he should be.
“So, then he wants to be with me so he’s willing to suffer through me forcing food and sleep on him, me yelling at him, and me exhausting him?”
“Steve don’t think like that. It’s not true. Tony was happy with you. You made him happy. Happier than he’s ever been. You tried your best to be there for him, held him when he needed it, listened when he talked.  You made sure he stayed fed and healthy. He quit drinking for you.”
“Steve it’s true. Tony has been doing so much better since you guys have started dating and I’m sure it’s because of what you do for him and what you mean to him. And you know I’m not lying because I’m more bro with Tony than I am with you. So, don’t diminish his accomplishments and his gifts to you by saying you forced him. That’s not fair to Tony or you.” Clint looked so serious and Steve wanted to believe him so badly. Then Clint’s serious look turned into a teasing smile. “Beside man, you’re loyal, strong, honest, have integrity. You’re Captain America, a living legion. How can anyone not want you? You’re basically perfect or as close to……..”
…I’m Sorry...
“AH…Oh..S-Steve Please, please….
So he watched with bated breath as slowly but finally the head of Steve’s penis slipped inside his body which proceed to drag more of Steve’s dick inside. They continued until they were both as inside Tony as they were going to get with Tony constricting their cocks together. From the moment Steve gotten his head in Tony had started to wail at the top of his lung while his insides messaged over their cocks. It felt intense and amazing but also overwhelming. Now that he’d experienced it, Bucky knew they’ll probably be incorporating this into their normal sexcapades because they were definitely doing this again.
Bucky and Steve stopped in their tracks, arms still outstretched with a devastated expression on their faces.
“Credit where credit is due Tony, there have definitely been huge improvements since our time and Buck and I do truly appreciate that but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still problems. That’s why we look up to you Tony, you’re forever a futurist. You look at the world and always see how it can be even better.”
It actually didn’t take very long for Steve to text back, which surprised Tony. He must have expected Tony to text, which means he’s been contemplating what happened this morning a lot. That’s not a good sign.
Tony POV
“Then he asked me to leave” Steve’s voice came out small which is pretty in line with how he was feeling right now. “He said he wanted distance from me and..and when I didn’t leave he told me
Bruce cuts through the silent. “You broke up with him over text message? Even you know that’s not acceptable. Honestly Steve I never took you for a coward. Not to mention the other BullShit you’ve apparently been telling Tony all because of that stupid incident this morning? How….”
Steve pressed the key for the elevator then decided to take the stairs in his haste, but before he could, Natasha was standing in his way.
“I can and I will”
That seemed to sober Tony up pretty fast. “No Medical!”
It took Steve a minute during which Tony had whined since his dick was red, erect and dripping between his legs begging for attention but then Steve pulled himself upright to smirk at Bucky before saying, “So why don’t you do all that then?”
he chastised himself in his head.
“Well I’d prefer if he talked to me, of course, that way I can reassure him and make him feel better.” Steve replied immediately without much thought.
“So, then he practically dove out of my arms. He looked angry and told me. ‘It’s not your job to care anymore is it?’ in this mocking tone and it just raised my heckles because I thought he was taunting me for what happened this morning. And all I could think about was how upset and scare I’d been this morning and so I yelled back.” Steve tried his best to be unbiased as he retold their earlier conversation.
“It’s your fault that I’ve lost this bet with Nat! God I was so close too. If you think you’re going to get away with this Steve, you’re wrong. If my life is going to be shitty from here on out I’ll make sure you’re just as miserable as me!” He’d probably wouldn’t actually do that but he was so mad right now.
“Okay Tony…. I’m gonna come back later so we can talk about this okay?” Tony had to shut his eyes as Steve turns his body to the elevator. Steve was always so damn sweet. Right now, though, He needed more distance than a few hours or a few days.
Just when he thought that Tony was going to start talking to him, Tony burst into tears and all but flung himself into Bruce. Wow, Tony was heavier than he looked, but Bruce tried his best to comfort him through his sobs. Bruce tried to rub soothing circles in Tony’s back while the fabric at his shoulder was slightly soaked. “Hey Tony, it’s okay. If you tell me what’s wrong, maybe we can fix it?” If Tony was the one to break up with Steve, then there was about a 50% chance that the reason was irrational, and he might be able to get them back together.
“Then don’t you think Tony would like the same to happen with your insecurities?”
“I think the question you mean to ask is when did I realized that there were people in the world who would not be accepting of me being gay?”
Steve felt ice run through him, but he managed to get out “You think he won’t take me back?”
“I promise I won’t try to commit suicide or drink myself to death. So, you don’t need to be checking on me. I’ll tell JARVIS to get you when I’m ready to talk, alright?” That wasn’t quite what Steve wanted. He hated waiting and not knowing.
They froze like that a moment before bursting out laughing as Steve hugged him back.
He then felt all of his muscles turn to slug as he sagged in appreciation. He thought he wanted to be alone and mourn in peace, but the sight of Bruce made him realized how much he’d longed for company. His insides warmed as he thought about how he wasn’t alone anymore. He had a team now, friends. He didn’t have to go through anything alone anymore, not even conflicts with other team members. He trusted them to have his back and to be there for him. In fact, he
Clint didn’t look to happy either. “Sometimes I forget your still in your 20s Steve. For the record I though you were doing really good.” He stopped talking then because Natasha sent him a look that said
Steve looked down at his plate. “I’m sorry Clint, thanks for the food but I’m just not hungry. Maybe pack me a Tupperware for later? Thanks.” He pushed his chair out and stood. “I’m super tired. I think I’m going to go to sleep for a bit.
He hated that Tony would be alone. He hated that Tony had to assure Steve that he won’t hurt himself.
“Ah…ah..I want……yes…oh..” Steve only smirked wider as Tony’s attempt to form a coherent sentence before his hips stuttered to a halt with the tip resting at Tony’s rim causing Tony to cry out. “Wha? Steve NO! ah Please!”
“Can you at least tell me if he’s okay?”
“ I promise I won’t try to commit suicide or drink myself to death. So, you don’t need to be checking on me. I’ll tell JARVIS to get you when I’m ready to talk, alright?” He says, causing Steve to turn back around a bit.
on repeat in his head while frozen with fear over what Tony was going to say next. But Tony always had a way of surprising Steve with how brave and just overall good he was, how he’d always put others before himself because even through Tony still obviously had his own distress regarding their relationship, his main concern, his automatic response is to comfort Steve. “It’s not fair to you that we always assume you’re perfect. That’s not something anyone should have thrusted on them and I’m sorry that I didn’t catch it sooner, especially considering how Howard was when I was young.” Steve’s heart tightened for that little boy that Tony once was.
His response caused Steve to smile smugly, “While I guess I’ll have to keep him warm until you get here.” Steve was already stroking himself almost back at full hardness. He then went to turn Tony so that he was face down ass up with his ass facing Bucky. “Such a shame because it’s such a pretty hole isn’t it?” Steve was spreading Tony’s cheek for him to give Bucky a nice view of Tony’s gapping hole, rim puffy from the earlier abuse. Bucky couldn’t agree more as he’s cock turned steel hard. Tony was breathtaking like this.
Bucky groaned and set his head in his hands. Whoever thought that Steve was a saint was obviously delusional. Steve had the sexual appetite of a rabbit, with the endurance of a camel, and the power of an bull. He could talk dirty with the best of them, was entirely shameless and a complete deviant. Steve could give Tony and his sexual reputations a run for their money if it wasn’t for the fact that he was Captain America and no one would believe it.
Steve then looked into Tony’s shocked expression, arms still slightly raised, with growing dread. He wasn’t suppose to have said any of that. Oh no, this was going to end up pushing Tony away. Why had he said any of that?!
tell Tony, or anyone for that matter, that a break up was for their sake. It’s too presumptuous. Of course, the other person deserves to decide that for themselves! Oh god, what he must have thought.” At the last sentence Steve returned to moaning into his hands.
“Yeah he did..” Bruce replied but was mainly focused on Tony’s hand at the moment. It was definitely going to be a 2
“Mr. Stark, when did you realize that you’re gay?”
Damn those two made a pretty convincing argument. Steve considered it. “I’ll try, okay? I can’t promise anything.” Despite it not being what Natasha and Bruce probably wanted to hear. It drew a smile to their lips.
Since Bucky was pretty sure who had orchestrated this whole scene, Bucky felt the panic recede, as he rapidly pitched his pants in a tent. Sweatpants were really bad for hiding erections and he couldn’t help but groan which cause Tony to looking at him again with unfocused eyes.
This time the response came slower.
They got back to their shared apartment, where Tony unlocked the door and entered with the Brooklyn twins trailing behind him. Tony was just about to turn around and apologize when he noticed that Steve and Bucky were making a grab for him. He knew they would never hurt him, but past habits die hard, and he flinched, jerking his whole upper body back.
Bucky couldn’t tell what he was more annoyed at, the fact that Steve had mentioned Natasha or that he was so obviously entertained by his misery.
“We don’t know that I would have died otherwise!” Steve protested immediately
Bucky had a soft loving smile on his face, while Steve still looked somewhat heartbroken.
Upper body forced down by Steve’s weight Tony could only whimper and sudden Bucky couldn’t take it anymore.
“Dude the text you sent clearly indicates that you broke up with Tony. Why did you type that?” Clint prompted.
Determinedly Tony lowered his mouth around Steve cock going to take as much into his mouth as he could. It was a smart move. Steve really didn’t have a lot of patience for teasing when it came to sex. Tony gave a really good effort and was able deep throat up to how far Steve was able to bury himself into Tony’s ass previously. Steve groans his pleasure “Yes… All your holes are made for our pleasure aren’t they Tony? …Ugh….Buck his mouth feels so hot and wet…”
“Oh no!” Bucky moaned into his hands as he filled with dread.
“I hate you,” Bucky shot Steve a glare to which Steve just laughed as he unshackled Tony’s legs.
“When did I, what?” He’d heard the question, he needed the second to tamp down his anger.
“Hey Tony,” Bruce continued to smile at him as he sat the mug down. There wasn’t pity in his voice or eyes only support and Tony melted a little more inside. He always had an extra soft spot for Bruce, who he thinks had been alone even longer than him, which is too bad because unlike him, all Bruce has ever wanted is to help people. He knew Bruce had a soft spot for him as well because he was Bruce’s first friend after the Hulk. That thought sort of made him sad, because Bruce deserved the best and the fact that Bruce has a soft spot for Tony only because Tony had no sense of self preservation when he’d first met Bruce made him feel unworthy of all the care Bruce gave him.
All of Steve’s insecurities rushed him at the words. Maybe he really didn’t make Tony happy? Maybe Tony realized he could do better? Maybe this break up was just what Tony was waiting for?
Steve shook his head. “No that’s not true Tony, you’re amazing and intelligent, sweet and loyal! You….”
At his words Tony finally made a high pitch keen and he came so hard he got some cum on Steve’s chin. Tony’s orgasm then caused his inner muscles to ripple around their cocks and that was it for Bucky. He came hard, orgasm making every cell in his body tingle and his vision whiting out.
Steve sighed. Tony shouldn’t be worrying about him right now.
“Steve,” Bruce budded in, surprising everyone. “I’m sorry I got angry and accused you of hurting Tony. Natasha’s right. I got too into Tony’s problems and forgot that you’re a part of this too, and you’re hurting also. So, I’m going to make it up to you by passing on what Tony has told me.” Bruce paused to gesture to Steve to not interrupt. “It’s not something he told me in confidence and I think he’d want me to tell you given the situations.” Steve hesitantly gave Bruce a nod. “Okay, Tony has told me that he used to sleep better but ever since Afghanistan and then New York, he’s been getting night terrors.”
Besides, something like that could never happen.
Tony went to make another snarky comment, but Steve’s slumped shoulders and worn look stopped him. Steve was tense, but it wasn’t his normal
Steve nodded and took a deep breath, letting his eyes close. Captain America doesn’t freak out. Not again. Not so many times… “I’m sorry. I know that’s not like me. I—” Steve pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Perfect,” Steve murmured softly before he captured Tony’s lips in a longer lasting kiss. With his enhanced hearing, he could hear someone approaching quicker than Tony could, so he didn’t worry as much.
Steve arched an eyebrow as he watched me. “I read online – on the internet – that the waiter tends to hand the check to the one who think is more dominant,” He chuckled. “Like an alpha male situation.”
The door opened without any anger, but instead sleepy surprise. “Steve? You need something?” He leaned his hip against the edge of the door as he held it open, and Steve resisted the urge to draw the adorable Tony closer.
“I can take it a little longer,” Steve chuckled after I finished my yawn. “I rather you get some rest. We can’t be sleep deprived while on a mission.”
I turn around expecting to argue over the matter, but instead I see the amusement on Steve’s face. So, he was
With that Steve took off out their garage. Tony yelped then grumbled as he securely wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist. Tony didn’t try to argue, because deep down he knew it was true.
Tony looked surprised and taken aback by that revelation, but at the same time he looked relieved and almost awed. “That’s…great. Truly, Cap. Very mature.” He sipped his coffee again. “Though, I do have one thing to say: we
I didn’t wait for him to leave before I walked out my own office. What the hell was that supposed to mean? Did he think other people didn’t respect me just because he might not?
Natasha smiled before she patted Steve’s shoulder. “It’s called Twitter, and that sounds like a good place to start.”
After a few laps around, he saw Sam up head of him for his own morning run. Steve couldn’t help the smug look he felt on his face before he composed himself. Once – for that fraction of a second – on Sam’s side, Steve called out, “On your left.”
Steve crept up to a box where one of the weapons were stored in, and he opened it carefully. He glanced back towards Tony before he picked up the weapon, looking over the inscriptions on it.
Tony pulled the whiskey bottle to his lips, his back against the bar in his suite. It was late, way later than he should be up. He honestly couldn’t say what the time was.
Steve shook his head and leaned back into the back of the chair. “No, like…” He tried to find the right way to describe it without sounding either insane or like he experienced it. “Just repeating a day. A person wakes up and it’s the same day. They fall asleep, wake up, and again it’s the same day.”
That threw Steve into a whole new loop. “You-You had a feeling to come here?” Impressions. This place left an impression on Tony, and maybe so did Steve.
Steve hunched over and closed his eyes as he focused on the feeling of the evening wind pushing against his body. He couldn’t take it much longer, and he knew that. There was no way out.
,” He managed out. His words were slurred and choked back, but it could be heard.
Steve gripped the gun tightly in his hands to prevent his hands from shaking from his anger. He had his jaw clenched tightly shut as well. “You—
Tony couldn’t help the shiver that ran through his body, and it wasn’t from the wind. “Jesus, Steve,” He breathed out as he took in what Steve was getting at. “You’re not being serious here, are you?”
I would really appreciate the kudos and the comments for this :) it's my first work and I'm really proud of it.
“How the hell can we figure out how to handle this
Nothing.
They walked into the diner and sat in a booth near the back to not draw so much attention. They ordered right when the waitress came to the table, both being almost starved hungry. Steve just needs to eat a lot more consistently than normal people, and Tony most likely hadn’t eaten anything in a while.
Steve also realized that he is the only person that doesn’t change. Not only is he the only one to remember the previous Thursday’s, but he feels all injuries from the day before. With the serum his injures usually heal over night or by the other Thursday after, but he would still feel the remaining soreness or aches from where he got hurt the day before.
Steve put his shield on his back and carried his cowl with him as he snuck off down to the garage again. He straddled his bike and was about to start her up before he froze.
Tony had taken it upon himself to undress. He was leant back against the headboard of his bed with only a pillow hiding his junk. A sly smirk was on his face as he watched Steve’s reaction. “Like what you see, Cap?”
It wasn’t too long after when Tony came out dressed and looking sharp. “I’m ready with an empty stomach and a need for my morning coffee. Let’s get going, Cap.” Tony grinned to Steve before he passed the other man on the way to the door.
It was hard for Tony not to explode with his emotions. He was angry, but he had to try to not let this lead to a fight. “You were my…friend. You could have told me, and I would have understood. But to know that you kept it from me? It was the tipping point on an already heavy plate.”
The other slight problem is the technology is new, so he’s creating it from scratch. Plus, it’s going to be painful to implement the sensors into his skin in order for the nanotech to work properly.
“Most likely,” Steve hummed in agreement before he laid his menu down as well. “I’ll get their All-American breakfast.”
Tony began to drive off once the directions started, taking a moment to glance over to Steve worriedly. “How many men are there in the apartment? You never said,” Tony asked to make some conversation, so his mind wouldn’t go into overdrive and think the worst of Steve’s mental state.
“How are you so perfect?” Steve murmured softly, cupping Tony’s jaw this time.
“Well, sir, it seems that the entirety of the back of the suit is deeply damaged and needs repairs before any flight. Your back appears to be okay,” JARVIS responded obediently once he assessed the damage. “I have contacted S.H.I.E.L.D. about the completion of the mission.”
“Steve, what are you—?” Rhodey began to question before he cut himself off. “Right. You’ve been fucking Tony. That’s why you’re in here.”
It was a lazy, do-nothing kind of day.
Steve pulled one of the stools over to sit on. He was in some pajama pants and a loose shirt. “It’s late, and the others are getting worried. You’ve been cooped up here more nights in a row than usual. So, they sent me.” He chuckled.
“I do hang out there when I can. But I keep myself busy,” Steve attempted to justify, but that just put another thought in my mind.
Tony tsked. “Technology, sweetheart. I’m not going to bother explaining it when I’m not happy with you. And I doubt you’d understand it anyways. No offense.”
Tony’s fingers twitched above Steve’s forearm, and his mouth opened and closed like a fish. “What…What do you mean?” His hand moved away a bit as the shock creeped into Tony’s words and expression.
It just so happened that the more Tony anchored down, the more developed Steve’s feelings for Tony became.
So, Steve told Fury about everything. Everything except for the intimate moments with Tony, and the nights they shared together, and the beach, and the field, and every other moment Steve had stored in his heart.
Tony shrugged then turned back to look at the scenery. “Other than that cave I was kept in? Not really.” A small breeze passed them, and Tony smiled. “I didn’t like it there. But I like this.”
Tony sighed heavily and relaxed more into Steve’s side as the other thought. “I mean,” He licked his lips. “Loki is right under our
“I do tend to have that effect on people,” Tony waved off with a grin in Steve’s direction.
Steve set his empty bottle and the rest of the trash in the to-go bag. “A movie?” He questioned unsure before he looked up to Tony. “I don’t know, Tony. I was thinking about cleaning up then crashing.”
“Being your best friend gave me the right,” Rhodey replied and he shook his head in disappointment. I don’t blame him. “And you know I don’t believe you when you say that.”
Tony rested his back against Steve’s chest as they sat comfortably and gazed out at the meadow and other wildlife. “For us.”
He winced to himself before he remembered Tony’s distress.
Steve Rogers.
“Steve? What the fuck? I was sleeping,” Tony exclaimed with an angry whine. His hair was tossed all over the place as if wanting to entice Steve closer. Not even that could ease Steve in this moment. He needed answers. He needed to know he wasn’t going insane.
“Yeah.” Steve cleared his throat before he continued. “He was a good man, but war changes people.”
"I'll have you know that in those situations I'm mostly functioning on pure battlefield adrenaline. This right now hurts like a bitch."
“Tony, kids don't starve because you try to take care of yourself.”
"Look who's got a big head now." He took a sip from his hot cocoa, spiced with pumpkin and cinnamon instead of amaretto, the way he used to drink it. "I bet he is actually trying to prevent Steve from seeing you, Lady Liberty," he huffed, indicating her costume. "Right now, you are Captain America's walking wet dream and your boyfriend's trying to stop him from harassing you."
Tony pulled up his legs, let his arms rest on his knees and fixated his eyes on the spoon spinning between his fingers.
“Feel how cold my hands are!” he laughed as Steve pushed him with a yelp away.
“You love him,” Bucky stated as if he was talking about the weather, one hand resting on Steve's shoulder.
Immediately, Tony mimicked zipping his mouth shut, getting Steve to shake his head and look down to hide an affectionate smile.
Tony nodded, his lips too jammed together by his friend's fingers to make more than an affirmative noise.
Tony already liked the idea of spending the holiday with his teammates instead of business partners and overzealous employees. He still felt like he should voice some objections.
They did that a lot, Steve mused. Just sitting quietly, enjoying the other's company without the obligation to put up a show of snark and wit.
“Yes, yeah, peachy,” Tony breathed, his hands running over the sweatpants covering his thighs. Up and down, up and down.
Instead of answering, Steve stepped closer, took gently hold of Tony's chin between his fingers and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.
Tony shot him a glance out of the corner of his eyes before putting the coffee back in the cup holder. The silence that followed was only interrupted by the monotone sound of the wipers moving quickly over the windshield and the rain dropping onto the car’s roof creating white noise. Steve looked out of the window at the red taillights in front of them, searching for something to say.
"I would be worried about your big head if I hadn't literally just seen you cry over that girl dressed as princess Iron Man," Tasha commented while observing Clint, who was dressed up as Robin Hood and joggled apples for a small crowd of single moms.
Pursing his lips, Tony turned back to facing the windows. “Nothing, just couldn’t sleep.”
Sneaking his arms around Steve's back, Tony pulled him closer to bask in the bliss the blonde man was giving off.
Carol kept eating, unimpressed, but at least Steve had the decency to look sheepish. “Nat makes a really good stew.”
"Don’t worry about it, golden boy. There's no better reason to bail than Captain America needing my help.”
He stumbled backwards, but before he could fall over his own feet, Captain America's quick reflexes had catched his elbow and steadied him.
The redhead put her hand to her mouth and made a farting noise.
“The voice you use during missions," Nat piped up.
The sweetness of it all was disgusting and, feeling the need to look out for his teeth, Tony focused back on Happy "So, what are you doing here, if not to protect me from tiny monsters riding a sugar high?"
Steve laughed out loud when he watched a little pug jump into a pool in slow motion, its face's skin folds flapping dramatically.
normal. We have the capability to help people and the responsibility to do so. One of my many responsibilities is the company.”
“Nat thought they belonged to Clint, because of, you know,” Steve shrugged. “the color. She wants him to take better care of his stuff and not leave everything lying around.”
The AI managed to sound sheepish when he answered. “Probably, yes.”
Steve walked up next to him and followed his gaze. There was nothing to see behind the glass except for the all encompassing colourless fog, which led Steve to believe that Tony wasn’t really looking at the world outside, but concentrating on something in front of his creative mind's eye, a thought or idea that was only visible to him until he would bring it into existence. The dull background was the perfect blank canvas for Tony’s distinctive art of inventing the future.
He moved over to the bathroom, but found, to his annoyance, that the sink there didn't work either.
“But you shouldn't have to run yourself into the ground just to live up to other people's expectations. You're already working so hard and you have accomplished so much. I'll never understand how hard it must be to fight against your addiction every day for the rest of your life, but I have seen people breaking under the weight of it before, and you are so strong to have come this far.”
“Is Bucky home, yet?” Steve pondered loudly.
. The weather is changing, the temperature's going down. You'd never admit it, but we all know you’re not a fan of the cold. That’s why I had your seat heater on the highest setting. You were shivering earlier.”
The inventor raisesld an inquiring eyebrow at the super soldier.
Steve got up and threw the empty container into the trash can before holding his hand out for Tony and pulling him up to his feet.
“He's such a fat-head.”
Now Steve was jogging through this beautiful scenery of a fine autumn day and he couldn't even enjoy it, because his mind kept flitting back to the mechanic in his windowless lab, working the day away.
Blindly, he tumbled out of bed and into his dark apartment's kitchen. He fetched a glass out of the cupboard, his enhanced eyes and muscle memory making it easier for him to find his way around during the night. He held the glass beneath the faucet and turned on the water. Nothing happened. Confused, he tried again, and again there was no water.
Steve's eyes had grown bigger as Tony kept on talking. He was right, they hugged all the time and there was nothing to it. Just a simple gesture of gratitude and friendship. There wouldn't be any new revelations if Steve and Tony hugged right now. There's no need to test Bucky's stupid theory because they already proved him wrong.
“It thickens the broth, has a lot of proteins. It tastes better than you think.”
Tony chuckled darkly. “Many people have that problem. Ask his former business partners, they'll tell you all about what a great man he was.”
“This isn’t tea, it’s tar!”
The supersoldier wasn't even startled by his teammate's sudden outburst. He had heard Tony coming out onto the balcony and had been waiting for the billionaire to say something, so he just turned his head towards him without stopping the movement of the needles. “I'm knitting,” he shrugged.
“When there is not enough to eat, people use every part of the animal. We didn't have much during the Great Depression and World War II,” he defended himself, his back twitching as if he was fighting two impulses at once, sitting up straight and hunching his shoulders.
At the sudden quiet, Steve looked up from his bowl to find everyone staring at him.
"She asked me to pick you up in her stead. Said something about her days as your chauffeur being over since the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D."
“I remember when I was eight, one of the video recorder's buttons was jammed and it drove my mother crazy. I took a screwdriver from Howard's workshop, opened the housing and had it repaired in less than ten minutes. Mom was so proud, called me her little mechanic and told Howard. But while loosening a screw, I had scratched the front. He took one look at that tiny scratch and tore the whole device straight off the cables, opened a window and threw it outside. He said I had destroyed it, that we couldn't keep scratched junk in our home and that I should
"Uh oh!" Tony stage whispered as he followed Steve, defusing the tense moment and making the children giggle.
Luckily, Steve let it slide and bid Tony good night with a warm pat to his shoulder as he stepped out on his floor.
The text message “worst pic ever” popped up beneath it, followed by a simple smiley.
"Alright," Tony answered with a happy humm and kissed him again.
“Just don't go,” Steve shrugged.
“What?”
"But I wouldn't be wearing this."
“Billie Holiday?” Tony couldn't help the poignant grin on his face that came with the memory. “I think Howard never liked her much. My parents listened to a lot of jazz, but never her music.”
birthday. On Valentine's day when you made those obnoxious sugar hearts for everyone. Should I keep going?”
"I was actually thinking about another seventy years being frozen,'' Steve countered before ducking his head and hurrying to get in the car.
"Yes! No, just- You wonder about my intentions, but keep doing these- these
"It doesn't go with the suit," the billionaire stated the obvious. "And even worse, it doesn't match your eyes. It's the wrong shade of blue, you need something brighter. But don't worry, we can shop for more yarn next week and I'll help you find the right one." He waved his hand, trying to deflect from his knowledge about Steve Roger's exact shade of eye colour.
to use that voice,” Tony humphed, irritated and relieved at the same time.
It was still early, therefore he didn’t expect any of his teammates to be up already. That was fine with him, he liked to prepare breakfast for his friends and enjoyed the quiet morning by himself before the tower awoke and started bustling with the chaos that came with several superheroes living beneath the same roof.
Bucky let out a sigh through his smiling lips and shook his head. He used the hand on Steve's shoulder to pull him into a tight hug, which Steve leaned into immediately.
“Sounds great.”
With a deep sigh, Steve let his head drop down against his chest, before shuffling his feet towards the elevator.
“Are you two planing to stop any time soon or will I have to declare bankruptcy in the near future?”
“There's gonna be a lot of alcohol at Stark Industries' Halloween Party and I thought it would be better, safer if I knew I could deal with it before I have a relapse in front of a thousand party guests.”
Dum-E made a u-turn and sped further into the lab, where Tony sat at a table, a soldering iron carefully held in his hand and a focused look on his face.
"I never would have guessed. With your reputation and all," Steve quipped and then winced, unsure if the joke went too far. He knew that the rumors about Tony's love life were a great exaggeration and that the so-called playboy had often had his heart broken.
“So, what's with the plant?” Tony inquired.
Tony dropped his arms to give Steve the stink eye.
“No." Steve sighed. He was so used to Tony’s comments by now that he didn’t even get flustered anymore, even if the other man peppered his words with a sinful leer. “My butt is getting way too warm. Which button is for the seat’s heating?"
"I couldn't sleep because my mind wouldn't shut up. Since last night, I think that I am in love with you. I mean, I guess I've been falling for you for a long time now, but I only just figured it out."
"Those tears were out of fear. I thought Bucky was gonna kill me, the way he glared at me. Where did he go now? He isn't plotting something, is he?"
"And I will lecture him about the proper usage of inappropriate talk. I hope you don't need the same treatment?"
Later, once the floor was dry and the stew was done, they sat around the large dining table, enjoying the food and the time with their teammates. Natasha had made enough to feed a small army. They always cooked more than they needed, knowing that any leftovers would be ravaged quickly enough. Besides, they never knew when someone would suddenly join them.
Annoyingly, Tony found that he had started sweating from dancing close to the fire and was now indeed shivering from the cool breeze on his damp skin.
"This is the part where you either confess your love or let me down easy," the billionaire quipped with a half-hearted smirk.
Outside, the fog gradually dissipated beneath the beginning of light rain that set the basis for a cold and grey day. As it was getting closer to the year's ending, autumn was slowly bowing out and setting the mood for winter, the days getting shorter and the temperatures falling rapidly. Yet inside the Avengers tower's community kitchen, something bright and warm was just beginning to grow.
“Next time you could just wake me and say that Tony needs help.”
Slowly, his hand slightly trembling, Tony accepted the spoon. Steve took it as permission to sit down on the floor next to him, holding out the open tub to offer the first scoop.
He paused to swallow, a futile attempt to dislodge the lump in his throat.
"Good. Iron Man." He nodded his head to the side, wordlessly telling the other man to follow him. "A word!"
“This really could work,” Tony huffed, impressed. “I'll ask Pepper, she's probably busy with the company's party, but maybe she can perform some magic and conjure another one.”
Tony fell back into the chair and balanced the plate on his lap, mindful of the important clutter on the work table.
“I don't want to know about Howard Stark, the business man. I want to know about your father.”
“Same." Steve answered just as the elevator announced their arrival at the common floor with a ding. “If you want to talk about the drinking.”
“I can see that. But
Steve let his grip glide down along Tony’s arm, until he held both of his hands in his own. He rubbed them between his palms, before pulling them up to his face to warm them with his breath.
“Do you have any other reasons for why we should break up?” Steve asked slightly concerned about what Tony will answer.
“Steve,” Natasha hesitates a moment before deciding that Steve deserved the absolute truth. “Look, I’m not a part of this relationship and I can’t read minds, so I can’t tell you if those things are true or not. What I can tell you is that while I was his secretary I tried to get him to eat and sleep long before you came into the picture, Pepper has been trying to force Tony to sleep and eat. But it never worked. So, I can tell you that forcing him to sleep and eat doesn’t do anything. He sleeps and eat when you ask him because he wants too.
Steve proceeded to sprint from the room and down the hall, adrenaline pushing any fatigue out of the way.
As soon as Steve registered the word, he felt a rush of relief. “Oh, Thank God!” But then the hurt in Tony’s eyes turned to anger.
Steve nodded. It was the first time Steve had acknowledged those inadequacies he’d been feeling but even he can see how they’ve worsened the current situation even if unintentionally. It’s okay though, acknowledgement was also the start of moving past them.
“I don’t want to calm down Clint, I want to kick Steve’s ass.” Everyone paused at the statement. Bruce was almost never violent in his human form, but when it came to Tony, all bets were off.
Steve’s initial response is to be angry and protest, but he stops. He’d just proven Bruce’s point. Bruce was right, he needed to think more and react less. This isn’t a battle field. No one and especially not Tony is attacking him. Tony loves him so there’s no reason to get defensive when they talk. Sure, Tony’s words are sometimes sharper than any knife, but Steve does know that when he’s open so is Tony. Steve smiles. Every time Tony is open with him feel like a privilege, a special gift and Steve also feels proud that someone who’s been hurt so many times is still strong enough to open up. He nods at Bruce. “You’re right Bruce. Thank you again. That’s good advice.”
"Oh! I'm on it," Steve acknowledged and helped the vendor to hand out the cotton candy to the children, along with compliments for their costumes and the assurance that, even though he doesn't look that way right now, he truly is the real Captain America.
“No,” Steve scowled adorable earnestly with his refusal to Tony's suggestions. “I wanted to propose a counter-event, an Avenger's Halloween party, that Iron Man has to be present at. You can't go to both events and the whole team and some other important people are forcing you to attend it, of course, so the decision of which party to attend is taken out of your hands.”
was an oblivious fool.”
A sleek car steered out of the traffic rushing by and came to an abrupt stop at the curb. Its front tire disrupted a large puddle, splashing the water over the pavement, it's waves only stopping millimeters in front of Steve's shoes before flowing back again.
you and it's inappropriate."
Tony wanted to say something sarcastic or tease back, but a cool breeze tousled the fair strands of hair on Steve's forehead, he had small crinkles around his eyes when he met Tony's gaze, and he looked so happy and so at peace.
Chuckling, Tony raised his hand to throw his team mate an obscene gesture, but quickly turned it into a scratch at his head, when two tiny Black Widows jumped up in front of him and asked to take a picture with him.
“I'm always excited when it comes to my gal.”
Speechless, Steve stared at his friend until Tony started fidgeting beneath his gaze.
He couldn't help but cry out.
“And make Morris lose his job? You’re a heartless employer!" Steve cried out in an exaggerated moral outrage.
For a few minutes Steve waited patiently for Tony to continue. The slightly smaller man seemed to be lost in his memories for a moment. Treading carefully, Steve pressed the side of his thigh against Tony’s, trying to remind him that he didn’t have to be alone with his dark thoughts, that Steve was here for him.
Fall was flaunting its bright colors and most of Central Park's trees had turned a bright red and yellow. Steve couldn't help but be reminded of the flamboyant paintwork of the Iron Man armor. It was only natural that his mind would move to the man piloting it.
A bashful smile bloomed over Steve's face and Tony answered it with  a cheeky grin.
Tony was quick to merge back into traffic and drive them downtown, to Avengers tower.
“Me?” The captain was taken aback.
“Stop making fun of me,” Steve demanded without real heat in his voice. “You're not allowed to when I come here with a resolution to your problems.”
Tony liked this quiet camaraderie just as much as he liked their playful banter, but right now he didn't want to stay silent, he wanted Steve to understand.
He held out the screen towards Bucky to look at the ridiculous recording, who just rolled his eyes.
Without further prompting, the elevator began it’s silent ascent.
Tony ignored her and marched over to the guy wearing a hot rod red three piece suit and a dark and shaggy wig.
touch his stuff again. How fucked up was that? And it was always like that. He never saw my accomplishments, only my flaws. I learned how to ride a bike, I wasn't fast enough. I won the science fair, didn't mean my project wasn't shit, it was just the least shitty.”
"Look at that, it's so quiet," Tony pointed at their view of nothing at all. "One could think we're the last two living souls on this planet."
He gave Steve a quick wave as he passed.
Deciding to attack the feeling straight on, he pushed his words out with force.
“Blood.”
“What?” Steve asked with narrowed eyes.
“Then why attend it at all?”
The children close by were howling at once, some pointing at Tony and shaming him for using such foul language, while others started a chorus of repeating the cuss word.
“Maybe so, but I'm not their babysitter. And I may or may not enjoy Nat's less dark kinds of mind games,” Steve smirked.
“It’s fine. I’m fine. It’s just…" he paused in search for the right words. “No one really likes the cold. It’s just uncomfortable.”
"I guess one would have to have strangled a man with his thighs to understand that kind of humor and I must admit that I never had that kind of pleasure."
"Some kid wanted to know if it's real," the super soldier replied bashful.
He would never admit it, but he felt pretty proud when the hubbub stopped immediately and the kids looked down at their feet. That was until one brave, or in Steve's opinion irritating boy spoke up.
Steve woke with a dry throat. He felt unusually hot and for a short moment he wondered if he was coming up with a fever until he remembered that he didn't get sick anymore.
“Yeah, all things you clearly lack.”
"Stay alert, boss, we got new incoming," Happy Hogan piped up from the side and Tony turned startled towards his head of security.
“Not to drink it, I just-”
"The suit is brash enough, but your shave isn't precise," Tony concluded and wiped his thumb over the smudged paint at Steve's jaw.
"Well, maybe I like you more than we both thought, too!"
"The two of us can't repopulate the earth alone."
Instead of answering, Tony leaned over and turned the heating off himself. Steve got a whiff of his aftershave, and the pleasantly warm smell was familiar enough to carry a sense of calmness.
They both kept smiling long after the elevator doors were closed.
“Why?” Steve prompted between bites of ice cream, aiming for nonchalant but missing by a mile.
"That is pure slander! You don't see me sitting in a corner sharpening knives just because I'm wearing Tasha's clothes."
When Steve looked out of his bedroom window the next morning he could already see the mist crawling over the calm ocean towards the city.
"No problem, your team's got your back. On and off the battlefield."
The rain clouds of the last few days had dispersed and the warm weather was rearing up for a great finale before the north wind brought the cold that would keep New York in its grip for the next months. The light was bright outside and he paused to watch the orange rays of the early-setting autumn sun reflecting golden in the other man's hair before he walked closer.
“Yeah, see ya.”
“Nothing,” Steve quickly assured him. “Just people putting the wrong ideas in my head. But we're good.”
The small smile on Tony's face was genuine this time.
"Yeah, you fucked up," Steve sighed, but couldn't keep a straight face in front of Tony's indignant stare.
The brunette eyed the spoon outstretched towards him as if he was held at gunpoint. He blinked twice before glancing up at Steve, who tried to radiate as much sympathy and calmness as possible.
Natasha shook her head. “I told him not to come home without a replacement for the last
"You laugh about the most stupid stuff," he mumbled and opened his ponytail to run a hand through his hair, a sign that their workout was over.
“Huh? Oh,” Steve paused for a moment to listen to the melody. “It's Strange Fruit. I asked JARVIS to play some Billie Holiday for me. I always liked her voice and there are even some songs I didn't know yet.”
“Tony?”
Later that night, when Tony walked alone into the quiet of his rooms  and started to undress, his eye caught his own reflection in a mirror. With delight he realised that the scarf Steve had lent him looked rather good on him.
"Yeah, tough luck," Tony huffed out with a soft laugh. "You do all kinds of shit that I don't know how to take."
"My God, Happy! I told you to take the night off. I'm literally standing right next to Captain America, what's supposed to happen to me?"
Soft music was playing on the common floor mixed with the sound of rain pattering against the large windows. Tony recognized the playlist as one of Nat's, the songs carrying a sense of doom that in his opinion only a former KGB agent could find catchy. The space was sparsely lit and he followed the most prominent light source towards the kitchen area, Steve close behind him.
The tension left the engineer’s body as quickly as it had come. He looked over to the far end of the room where Steve was still moving a mop in wide arches. His wet clothes had been replaced by gray sweatpants and a beat-up shirt with the S.H.I.E.L.D logo on the front. On his feet were those ridiculous cleaning slippers he got from Clint last Christmas. They looked as if someone had skinned a poor poodle, colored its remains purple and glued them to the sole of the ugliest pair of sandals they could find.
“Let’s get some of that hot apple punch, I heard it’s delicious and I'll have a warm cup to hold on to.”
The sidewalk was a colorful sea of umbrellas. People were hurrying to get to a dry and preferably warm location. Large drops banged loudly upon the porch roof Steve had been able to find shelter beneath before the rain had changed from a light drizzle to a full-on pour.
“Oh, fuck off.” Bucky shoved Steve away laughing. “You don't smell like roses either. Hey, there's a thought. You should get your man some flowers for the great emotional resolution.”
“Alright, I will. But you have to let go of me, you smell like a monkey's armpit.”
“It's good to increase your fine motor skills. It's also good training for your brain, improving memory and cognitive anchoring.”
"I just can't seem to censor myself, not even at a family friendly gathering," he continued with a shrug, though Steve knew him good enough by now to notice the self-deprecating tone in his voice.
Tony's ears perked up. "You've seen him around? I thought he was running late."
Proving him right, she closed the book and shooed him away from the fridge.
"Get in! Or are you waiting for next spring to thaw you out of your position?"
Steve raised an eyebrow. Tony sighed, shutting his mouth and motioning for him to continue.
"Like what?" Steve questioned, taken aback by the accusation.
“This is for blackmail,'' Tony said quickly, looking down at the beautiful picture. The warm sun was reflected in the blonde's hair, giving him a golden halo. The smile on his face was honest and open, his perfectly white teeth shining bright. Steve looked radiant and if the original hadn't been sitting right in front of him, Tony probably wouldn't have been able to tear his eyes away from the photograph. “Next time you harass me during training, I'll tell everyone that Captain America likes to knit in his free time.”
He could still hear Steve laughing as he smiled into the camera.
"Because that would be a lazy depiction of a complex character. How about some psychological facts stating that sex and killing a man trigger the same area in the brain? You could wrap it up in a joke."
He could hear the chair legs thudding on the hardwood floor as she sat up straight.
Yes, Captain America had a sweet tooth, sue him.
“About earlier," he began as they entered the elevator. “I didn’t watch my tongue. I know you stopped with the drinking and I’m proud of you. We all are. And we support you. I didn’t want to accuse you of anything.”
"He just can't stand to look at you right now," Tasha waved him off. "He said, and I'm quoting, you're ruining the sexiest thing he knows and he fears that it will take some time before he can enjoy watching me in a fight again."
"I'm just staying in character," he retorted with a finger pointing at his hand drawn goatee.
you hypocrite."
“It is now 5 a.m.”
“Coriander?” Carol guessed between bites.
“I was looking for alcohol,” he pressed out, embarrassed to admit it, but needing to lay it all out in the open.
"Where’s Nat?"
The overeager helper only stopped when he crashed loudly into his creator's chair, nearly slaping Tony in the face with the big flower.
“That's out of context!” Rhodey protested, but he was already drowned out by the others' outcries and imploring questions, which Tony only answered with vague half-truths that were not in favor of the colonel.
He knew that Steve and he used to be friends, best friends, and just because they weren’t together anymore doesn’t mean that Tony and he weren’t still friends, still teammates. They’d promised each other at the start of this that no matter what happens in the relationship, it wasn’t going to cause them to lose their friendship, lose each other in the end. And just because they weren’t together anymore doesn’t mean that Tony doesn’t love him anymore.
“I’m 100% sure” Steve reassured. They stood holding each other a while before Steve pulled back a little.
“I.. I’m …. not sure” Steve floundered because to be honest, he’s not 100% sure what happened. All he knew was he wants to, no needs to talk to Tony. He needs to sort this out with him.
“Look, Tony, just explain it to me. Please? Because I really don’t understand. I thought we were doing well.”
Tony had expected to wake up to massive leg pain and an empty cold workshop. What he actually woke up to was yelling. Which wasn’t 100% unexpected, he’d pissed people off a lot so it’s always a likely situation. Despite feeling too groggy to really open his eye, he did anyways, and all he saw was a blur.
Harley jolted back in return. He felt the boys breath on his cheek and felt his body reacting in response, his smile dropping immidiently as did Flash's.
"I-I have to go. Now." Harley grabbed his bag, continuously dripping water along the hardwood floor as he all but ran out of the house with Flash hot on his tail.
"Crap, probably like two or three," the blond rubbed his hands together, his teeth still chattering.
After about ten minutes Flash spoke up, still staring at the dark road infront of them, "Listen, I really am sorry. I just-"
This was a frequent problem in the boys past, he often skipped meals and refused snacks seemingly randomly. The boy swore it wasnt to lose weight 'or anything like that'. Tony chalked it up to anxiety based on Peter usually complaining that his stomach hurt on the occasions he would refuse food.
Harley looked at the pill, flipping it over in his fingers before sighing and dry swallowing it, grimacing and shuddering at the taste. He looked back to Flash who shoved him playfully and the blond laughed in return, shaking his head. What was he so worried about anyway? He had no reason not to trust Flash.
Steve had known Peter for longer than Steve had known his own biological son, Steve thought of Peter as his own child and at this point couldn’t imagine leaving his family behind. Tony took Harley in as his own instantly upon meeting the boy but Peter had come first in everything in Tony’s life up to this point and that wouldn’t change anytime soon. Nobody - especially Steve - could fault him for that.
"Nah totally not I'm like- so sober. Major sober." Harley drawled, his accent lacing his words without the restraint he normally forces into it.
"Are you sure school was okay? Nothing interesting happened?" Happy pried, trying to make eye contact in the rearview mirror.
Tony nodded, laying back on his side and hogging the blanket around his slim form.
"Well if I'm honest, going by the smell of the bathroom this morning I think the kid is being punished enough."
"Dont mix substances. Dont walk more than 4 miles below freezing. Dont overdo it with the alcohol." Harley muttered, stirring the eggs around distractedly.
Seconds before the final bell sounded a weirdly young, lanky kid stumbled through the door. Harley took in his appearance, immidiently deciding he didnt like the kid who was clearly years younger than the rest of them - marking him in his mind as an overachiever. The boy quickly scanned the faces of students, lighting up upon finding whoever he was looking for and making his path towards the empty seat at the front left of the room. 'Definatly an overachiever.' Harley rolled his eyes.
Peter grimaced up at the older boy, attempting but just falling short of a smile.
Steve sat across from his newly un-estranged son, scrambled eggs and pancakes infront of both men at 7:00 pm.
Ned smirked, "C'mon dude you'll be fine. You know you're your dads top priority." He gently shoved his younger friend.
"I bet." The man hummed, looking back at the road. "How do you feel about burritos tonight?"
Tony laughed, "I'm hoping I don't need to deal with that for awhile, if I'm honest." He laid a kiss on the blond's forehead, "Did Harley go to that party after all?"
On cue Harley shuffled out of his bedroom, his comforter draped over his shoulders like an old hags cloak. He flopped down on the couch next to Tony.
"It was. It wont happen again."
Harley felt his face heat up. He forced a chunk of egg into his mouth. "No."
Harley smiled, pulling the blanket tighter around himself, "Yeah. I'm starving. I dunno if I could keep anything down though."
Tony was perched up at the center island at his boyfriend's apartment, waiting for him to come home with his kid. He was scrolling through Twitter half heartedly as he waited for the Pizza Hut Steve ordered before he left to be delivered.
Peter perked up, "Harley? Did he move from Tennessee?"
"Hey it's okay, I get it, dont worry about it. That sounds good, maybe we can go to that taco truck too?" Peter suggested, biting the tip of his tongue.
"I dunno, Steve seems pretty old-fashioned. I doubt he'd let the kid get away with being rude to you and I'm sure his mom was probably the same way."
“Not really. Everyone seems pretty off-put, I’m sure at a school like this everyone has been together since like preschool.” Harley laid back on the couch, laughing to himself, “Actually there was this one kid. He had this weird preppy name and he was like six it was so weird. Being that young in a school like this he’s gotta be a kiss-ass.”
"No but this is different. I've never had the opportunity to get in with the popular crowd and I didn't want to miss my chance." Harley mumbled, avoiding his father's gaze. “Besides, this isn’t some corn field in the middle of nowhere.”
"Just a little something I snagged off my cousin. This is a highschool party after all, we arnt kids anymore." Flash opened his hand, revealing little colorful candy-looking things. If he didnt know otherwise Harley would assume they were no more than cheap pendants off of a candy bracelet. "What, dont you trust me?" Flash slumped, almost looking hurt.
Of course he felt bad about lying to this stranger as much as he wouldn't admit so. Hes only known his dad for like two years now, it's not his fault hes not exactly comfortable telling strangers that his dad is gay. It's understandable right? Just until he can plant his roots.
"You hungry bud? I figured we could go out to breakfast before I gotta get back to my own kiddo." Tony suggested.
Peter granted the man a small smile for his efforts, "Sure. I'm sorry, I didnt mean to imply you're not important its just-"
Steve suppressed a smirk, "All valid points, most of which would have been avoided if you didnt sneak out. You know I have no problem with you drinking as long as it's at home so why did you go after I told you not to?"
"Yeah well," Happy pulled forward into a slot, whipping out his phone to put in a mobile order, "not everyone is Tony Starks only child. Maybe he'll lax up a bit once Harley and Steve move in."
Tong laughed warmly, "Maybe. It's almost your bed time bud, I just wanted to check in and say goodnight. Make sure you get to sleep soon okay?"
“And you wonder where the kid gets his sarcasm from,” Tony laughed as he climbed into the backseat, “Peter’s on his way, he’s a lot more stressed than he’s letting on I think.”
The father was careful not to show a reaction, still pretending to scan over the penciled in answers, "Pete, everyone loves you. Maybe he was just wondering why a toddler was in his classroom." Tony quirked a smile, registering his pre teen openly gawking at him in his peripheral.
-10:52 PM-
Steve padded silently into the hallway, looking towards the bathroom. The door was ajar and the light was on, he could hear a faint sobbing echoing from the room. The man set off down the hallway, creaking the door open gently only to get hit with the smell of vomit and vodka.
Truthfully the two dads were possibly more anxious about how the interaction would go than their children were. Peter had always been a sensitive kid but was raised to be much more open about his emotions than Harley was. Harley deflected by default, if he was upset he’d make you upset in order to protect himself. It was like a match made in hell. Steve knew and understood that if Peter wouldn’t be happy in a situation then Tony would absolutely not force him into it - no matter if it meant sacrificing his own happiness. Their entire relationship rested on the shoulders of their children but they wanted to keep that knowledge from the kids as much as possible.
"Well surely it cant be taking the whole day up? The party doesn't start until seven anyway. You can stay the night too?" Flash suggested, offering a charismatic smile.
“Hey, language.” Steve thought for a minute, “You were just talking about wanting to fit in and you think it’s okay to make assumptions on another kid like that?”
"Hey Flash? Yeah I'm out infront of that sushi place, are you almost here?" Harley shivered, pulling his hood closer to him. It was only August but the temperature was getting cold a lot faster than it did back home. "Yeah, I brought it. You said your pool is inside right? Good- god I think my nipples would freeze off if it wasn't," he laughed tensely, smiling as the teal Jaguar pulled up next to him. He climbed in the back seat, placing his bag between his knees on the floor.
Peter climbed into the backseat of the Lincoln, tossing his bad haphazardly on the floor.
Peter opened the back door opposite to his dad and clambered in like a baby deer, forever grateful he could at least sit next to his dad rather than the new boy he was already admittedly scared of.
"Karen, do you think he'll call to say goodnight? Or did he forget." He addressed her, watching as she paused, almost as if processing the question, before stretching her fangs out, "You always know just what to say." He muttered sarcastically, turning his head to look up at the plastic stars and planets that littered his ceiling.
"Fine. Tiring." Peter shrugged, laying his head against the window.
He knew it was stupid, his dad knew it was stupid, hell his friends back home would call him stupid had they known.
Harley nodded, standing to follow Flash to a white Convertable, the boy not bothering to try and identify what make or model it was aside from that. He hopped over the door into the passenger seat, his shorts making a wet slapping sound against the leather though he couldnt bring himself to care. Flash circled to the other side of the car, silently sliding into the drivers seat and starting the engine.
Harley sighed, looking down at his calloused hands, rubbing his knuckles between his finger tips.
"Hey, dad!" He squeaked, finally getting to talk to him for the first time that day.
Peter grimaced, "I dunno if I feel up to it," he shrugged not-commidally. Happy just sighed in response.
"How many times do you want me to appologize for that!" Peter threw his head back before opening the car door, picking his bag up off the floor and letting the car door slam behind him, "I told you it slipped out, I was just trying to convince him that I wouldnt die if we went to Dairy Queen instead of some Amish ice cream place in the middle of nowhere."
"You keep forgetting you have practically an unlimited amount of money now, bub. Besides, therapists have a way of getting you to talk. I got Peter in therapy after his mom's OD and I think it helped a lot."
"I get it kid, you get your coping mechanisms from your dad. Let's go." The bodyguard who had suddenly found himself as the pre-teens nanny upon the kid starting kindergarten put his arm around his shoulder, keeping the kid from backtracking or getting distracted on their way out the door.
"What's the big deal anyway? He wants to go to a friends house I'm assuming?"
"Well you know your grandpa wasn't the best to your dad. I wouldnt be surprised if he was scared to put you in harm's way at all." Happy pulled into the underground parking garage, turning back around to face the younger boy and shaking his finger at him, "Remember, no telling Tony. I dont need him threatening to make me a valet like he did last time you snitched on me."
“I…” That threw Steve for a loop. “It’s different. My issues aren’t a big deal, especially when Tony’s hurting. He should come first.”
Steve then added on with “And then he said something about it being for the team and for me and I didn’t realize he was talking about breaking up. I thought he was going to start being more careful in the field!” Steve protested.
“For both of us?! No Rogers don’t even pretend that it was for my benefit too! I’m not denying that it needed to be said if that’s how you felt but there is nothing about this that is for my benefit!” And Tony looked wrecked. Steve wanted to cry.
The hulk wasted no time and crashed into the glass with his shoulder. The force resulted in a hairline fracture in the glass that Steve could barely see. Distantly he was thanking heaven that the workshop wasn’t built from hulk proof glass. The Hulk seemed determined and repeated his action. It took a good 9-10 hits for the hulk to cause the glass to come crashing down. Steve would be incredibly thankful if it wasn’t for the fact that the Hulk started running towards Tony with a “Tin man need help.”
He’d always thought that he had put Tony first and given Tony everything he’d wanted, everything that Steve had. He’d wanted to show Tony that love can be wonderful. Show Tony that Steve could be trusted with his heart. Show him that Steve wasn’t like all the others who had abandoned Tony or used him. He didn’t do any of that. All he’d done was take from Tony, hurt Tony, just like everyone else. Steve might have told Tony that Steve loves him, but he ultimately didn’t end up showing Tony he was loved through actions. With that thought Steve couldn’t help but basically bursted into tears at the table.
Steve’s reply only caused Natasha to frown. “And how were you planning to do that exactly?” Natasha pushed.
“Bruce, you’re not helping either. You need to take a deep breath and calm down. Can’t you see Steve is also suffering pretty badly here? He doesn’t need you beating him up, he’s doing an amazing job at doing it to himself.” Her word did seem to have an effect as Bruce snapped his mouth shut and didn’t look like he was going to open it again anytime soon. Natasha turned back to Steve once more. She crouches down next to him and runs her fingers through his hair. The movement as quite soothing and Steve found himself at least quieting down if not calming down.
“Steve, breath man, I’m sorry I didn’t mean to interrogate you. Don’t worry about it. Just what happened next?” It wasn’t until he felt Clint trying to shake his ridged upper body did Steve realize he’d been holding his breath. Shakily he pushed air out of his lungs.
Bruce took in Steve and his heartfelt expression and felt bad that he wasn’t done.
Natasha lifted her hands to stop Bruce from working himself up too much.
“You sure?”
Steve, at a loss for words, shoved his phone at Natasha while out of the corner of his eye he saw Bruce do the same thing to Clint with Tony’s cellphone.
“Clint stop, I trust his judgement. Stop yelling. Look at him.” He must have looked worse then he thought because Clint’s anger immediately deflated into concern. Who knew he cared?
Steve was already frustrated but he was starting to feel unsettled and desperate based on JARVIS’s responses.
After Steve left however Bucky could only shrink in on himself. Steve was correct that he’d gotten himself into this. A few weeks ago Tony and him had gone out for a date. During which they’d gotten each other all hot and bothered resulting in them having sex in a back alley. They hadn’t realized that paparazzi had tailed them, and by the next day their sexcapade had been published in basically every newspaper in town. Natasha, who was in charge of avengers PR (because Tony took too much joy in messing with the media), had been so pissed that Bucky was lucky that he’d only been stabbed once by the end of the day.
Loss and devastation swallowed him whole and he just couldn’t believe, couldn’t think about it “What?! No Tony! We need to talk about this?! How can you ….” Say something like that. No, they need to keep talking to sort this out. Keep talking until Tony and he were no long going to break up.
Steve peaked at Tony in his arms who was looking a bit shell shocked again but thankfully his color had mostly returned.
“Well then you better head down there” Bruce pushed as he headed for the kitchen.
“Well if you ever get those feels again you can always tell me Steve. I’m happy to reassure you. Besides for a guy in his first serious relationship who doesn’t know what he’s doing, I think you’re doing an amazing job.”
“I..? No. I didn’t take any?! I spilled those on the ground and was too lazy to pick them up!”
“Thank you.” He whispered as he withdrew from Natasha. She smiled at him.
“Hulk no! Look over there, there’s a cat stuck in a tree that needs you,” Clint was quick to react with a distraction.
broke through Steve’s string of doubt. It sounded like Natasha. “Why?” The word came out small and uncertain, so Steve tried again.
“I…Tony… I don’t want to leave it like this” His eye looked so earnest.
Steve jumped in with his own righteous anger, “That’s a highly intrusive and not an appropriate questi-“
“According to records, Captain Rogers told sir that and I quote ‘I just. I don’t want to go through something like that again. I felt so helpless, so raw. I just wanted to cry through the whole ordeal. I need you to understand how I was feeling. I need you to not. I need you to understand,’ JARVIS finished and for once his words sounded like it came from a robot. He must actually be just reading it from a transcript.
Steve’s words were definitely not helping Bucky stave off his orgasm especially as Tony clamped down extra hard from what Steve said, but he really wanted Tony to cum. Based on Tony’s current state this may be one of their only chances to get him to cum untouched and god did Bucky want that to happen. “Stevie….” He stuttered out. “Come fuck him over here with me.” At that Steve’s hips jerked to a stop.
Steve was started to pant more, a sheen of swear appearing to match Tony’s. He must be really fucking Tony hard for him to show symptoms of exertion. Tony swung his head to one side giving Bucky a view of his face. He looked like he’s eyes were about to roll to the back his head in pleasure as drool fell from his lips. He was magnificent. “I bet you do. You are always such a slut for it whenever you’re made to take it…” Steve growled, eyes dark, pupils blown. Tony whined in response. “You’ve got no problem with us just using you hard huh?”
“JARVIS is there a reason that a giant portion of the closet is missing?”
“Dammit Bucky! I’m trying to help both of you out here.”  Then Steve’s other hand came up to fist Bucky’s cock, covering it with lube before letting go.
Steve seemed unfazed, the ass. “You can hardly blame me because of
After a long pause with no response, Steve tried again. “Can you let me in…..please?” He wasn’t above begging at this point.
Steve basically snarls, “I don’t care if I have to start at square minus a hundred, I’ll never give up on Tony even if he gives up on himself. Even if Tony never wants to be with me again after this, as long as I’m still able to get even one of those insecurities back into the box then it’ll be worth it.” Steve had the most stubborn look on his face which brought a smile to everyone’s face and warmed their hearts.
“What are you talking about exactly” Steve asked with his hands up defensively. His whole body tense.
It took a second but then it clicked for Steve. “Are you talking about when we were in the workshop earlier? Tony I swear to you that I wasn’t talking about our relationship. I didn’t know about the text then and I didn’t know you were talking about our relationship the whole time. I..” Steve groaned, “I was flustered and to be honest, troop rallying speeches aside, I’m terrible at expressing myself. I wish I could convey to you exactly how I feel about you. In any case I wasn’t talking about you.”
Uh oh! One word replies, that’s also never a good sign. Tony couldn’t help but cringe. It’s been a while since Steve has been this mad at him over something in the battle field. Tony kept trying though.
“Did he quit drinking for me or did I make him?” He moaned.
Then Steve slowly and deliberately dropped to his knees right beside Tony and put his hand on Tony’s thigh. He couldn’t deny that when Tony flinched a piercing pain went through his chest. However, Tony didn’t pull away and that show of trust was already enough to warm his heart. From this angle, he was able to look up at Tony’s face which still displayed his anguish.
“Then I guess we’ve looped back to the why we started at.” Steve stared at Tony, his own arms now crossed, making sure Tony knows he’s not getting out of this without an answer.
One look at Steve’s angry face told him that it wasn’t about to happen though. That was fine. He wanted Steve to be angry. He wanted to drive Steve way, have Steve leave in a fit of anger, so he could get his distance. He wanted them to fight and yell so that they can have the closure of their relationship. An actual closure instead of just a text…..and maybe someday, a day that Tony couldn’t see right now, they could be friends again. When he’d healed from this, IF he manages to heal from this, or maybe just when the spot has been covered by nasty scabs. It wasn’t that he was optimistic, but that day where they would be able to talk to each other again off in the distance was the only thing keeping Tony going right now, and he knew that for that day to happen, they needed closure. He needed closure.
Steve had tears in his eyes again. What Bruce has said went a long way toward dispelling his insecurities and he was so grateful. “Thank you Bruce. I really..knowing that means the world to me and I really… Thank you.”
Steve was violently scribbling on his paper work that he needed to finish for SHIELD after every mission. All he wanted to do was get home and get his hands all over Tony to check that he was uninjured and okay. He’s brow was pinched as he tried to concentrate but always ended up thinking about Tony again. He was pretty upset about Tony throwing himself in front of that bomb for him today but now that he’s calmed down a bit he feels guilty for yelling at Tony. If he’s being honest with himself, he was being a totally hypocrite. If he and Tony had been in the reverse situation, Steve wouldn’t have hesitated to throw himself in front of Tony. Of course, he would.
“harder” Tony’s mouthed causing Steve to smirk.
Tony thinks, trying to be optimistic. Tony doesn’t realize that his knuckles had turned white from how hard he’s holding the tea mug, but he couldn’t let go. This mug of tea may be the last thing Bruce ever does to show that he cared for Tony.
“I just….. I don’t want to go through something like that again. I felt so helpless, so raw. I just wanted to cry through the whole ordeal. I need you to understand how I was feeling. I need you to not….. I need you to understand” and that hadn’t come out as clear as he’s meant it too. But he looked straight into Tony’s eyes, and tried to convey all he’s feeling, hoped that he could convey even a fraction of his love.
"Sure, and you didn't have time to get a costume. "
Smiling, Steve shook his head. The notion was ridiculous, but if Bucky needed proof that Tony was nothing more than a friend to him, he would show it to him.
"Don't be too hard on him, he's just excited."
“Oh.” He looked over at Tony, who had an equally surprised expression on his face.
“I know, but I feel awkward to be in the room while they work around me. I’d rather do it myself.”
Steve's full spoon paused in it's way to his mouth.
“Sure,” Steve agreed jokingly, his eyes already on a patch of large sunflowers. “He should be reminded that there is an outside world where more exists than screws and algorithms.”
“Sure, we're good,” Tony repeated with a smile for Steve's good sentience and his own.
“My butt is warm.”
Steve faked a pained grin.
Black Widow. Now stop criticising my dress choices. Why should a halloween costume make sense, isn't it enough to be sexy?"
“Yes?” Steve asked with his eyes raised towards the ceiling, more out of habit than actually trying to face the disembodied voice.
The man's eyes went wide as saucers and he frantically tried to silence the little rascals around him.
“You wanna know what's gross?” Tony interjected loudly, leaning over the table towards Carol. “Rhodey used to microwave his underwear back at MIT.”
“Well, you did good, JARVIS,” Steve assured him and cuddled deeper into his pillow. He slept better knowing that someone kept an eye out for Tony.
“You shouldn’t drink and drive," Steve scolded him as he started on his own drink. Red fruit infusion with a spoonful of honey.
Black pavilions covered with fake spider webs were standing in the center in case of rain, but the weather held steady. Tables were spread around where costumed staff helped kids with different activities. There was pumpkin carving and crafting skeletons out of papier-mache and a little contest of folding paper bats and seeing which one would fly the furthest.
"This is hot chocolate," Tasha yelled after him, waving her torch in frustration.
"Iron Man said it first!"
“Is that why all the women’s costumes are so short? Because the men today find shivering sexy?”
The other four were still giving him incredulous looks.
“And thank you for the food,” he remarked after his mouth was empty again. “But I should probably go back to work now, so if you don't want to be bored to a painfully dull death than you should better flee.”
Despite the short notice, they had gotten a permit to hold the party at a small public park in Queens and even found a decent band to perform. Sometimes, money was its own kind of miracle worker, Tony guessed.
“Oh, shit," Steve muttered as he looked back at the wet trail they had left. He quickly slipped off his shoes and picked them up. “I’m gonna mop the floor later.”
Natasha heaved a deep sigh and stirred the pot.
“JARVIS,” he groaned, not awake enough to form full sentences.
Reluctantly, the others began eating again.
Every attending Avenger had agreed to wear a costume that was not their usual uniform, therefore Clint bringing his own bow was kind of cheating. Yet, Tony couldn't complain. Though he didn't wear his armour, he had simply gotten hold of one of Black Widows cast-off jumpsuits, widened the shoulders and wore long gloves and high shoes to mask the fact that his own limbs were a little too long for the shorter woman's clothes.
"I'll have you know that I got that reputation because I used to be the one ending up between someone's legs."
Steve studied the older man's face carefully. “I know even more music Howard didn't like,” he pointed out, hoping to read the situation right. “I could make you a playlist.”
He just sat there and listened.
“Well, permission granted,” Tony laughed. “This really is a good idea, thank you, Steve.”
"I actually meant him," the bodyguard replied unimpressed and pointed at Steve. "New group of customers."
“No need, I called Hill and she agreed to pull some strings,” Steve beamed. “As soon as you give your permission.”
Tony’s eyes lost their distant gaze and he acknowledged his friend’s gesture by pressing back in equal measures. Another deep breath and he continued.
“You’re Captain America, capitalism should be your middle name.”
“Whoever Hill had put in charge of planning the first annual Avengers Halloween event must be the Tony Stark of party planners,” Tony praised the purple and orange decorated location.
To his relief, Tony didn't seem to take the jest badly and went along with it.
“What? Why should they be in the freezer?”
"I can see that. You're under real distress. You should take a break," Steve deadpanned and pressed the sandwich into Tony's hands, pretending not to notice the affronted look he received. "Sit. Eat."
Tony’s face darkened. “I
“Hey, Steve, what are you doing up?” he asked without meeting his friend's eye, his gaze flickering around as if he was noticing the disarray just now.
"Hold my beer!" Without looking at her, Tony pressed his half empty mug into the former assassin's hands. "I've gotta go over and turn some tables."
“Yeah,
"I'm a Man in Black."
It was the end of summer and while the air was still fairly warm, the bad weather reminded everyone that the cold season was getting closer. Deceived by the sunny morning, Steve had left his jacket at home. Now, he regretted it. He had wrapped his arms around himself to rub away the goosebumps on his naked arms, with no effect to his damp skin. Frustrated, he shoved his hands beneath his armpits to keep at least his fingers warm.
the end
“Yes. I thought about your Halloween obligations.”
"Captain America didn’t need your help, just plain old Steve Rogers," the blonde argued.
,” Bucky breathed with his next controlled exhale and slowed down until Steve was forced to stop running, too, and had to turn around to face the other man. “If he manages it, then I hope you get one of those phones, too, because
The first one to greet a freshly showered Steve as he stepped into the workshop was Dum-E. He curiously moved his arm closer to the items in the human's hands and made a whirring sound by rotating his claw back and forth.
Bucky threw his arm over Steve's shoulder as they headed back towards the tower.
“I zoned out for a moment, that's all.”
A soft ping resounded, loud enough for supersoldiers' ears and Steve pulled out his phone to find a message from Tony, just reading "That's your dumb humor" with a video attached.
“Have you ever taken Clint’s order for Five Guys?” Steve smiled at the ridiculous memory. “I didn’t even try to repeat it, I just gave the page of instructions to the waitstaff.”
His phone vibrated softly in his pocket and he paused his knitting to pull it out.
He whipped his head around and found Bucky facepalming next to a shell-shocked dog owner keeping his hard breathing and slowly moving bulldog on a long leash, the rope spanning diagonally across the walkway.
"Nah, he's over there, at the cotton candy machine."
Steve huffed a laugh. "Yeah, I'm missing out big time, am I not?"
“Excuse me, Captain Rogers, but you asked for an alarm at 5 a.m.”
Usually, Tony would have averted the topic and talked about anything else, but something about the situation, the late hour, the quiet kitchen, Steve's honest expression, made him brace himself and open up.
“My hobbies are not a secret and I don't
She shouldered her plastic torch and looked him up and down with a smirk. "He may have been blushing when I saw him last, but that's only to a limited extent my fault."
With a curse on his lips, Tony pocketed his smartphone and rushed through the door, yelling a quick goodbye over his shoulder.
They found Natasha at the long dining table, her chair balancing on two legs and a paperback resting in her lap.
, I help to improve. Now go, before you miss your meeting.”
“You're ruthless,” Tony proclaimed laughing at the same time as Steve groaned.
Steve found Tony a little while later near the bonfire, trying to teach children how to dance. One boy, dressed as a squid, excitedly grabbed the billionaires hands and spun them around. Amused, Steve watched them trying not to trip over the wildly flung tentacles.
," he carefully stated, his heart thundering in his chest, reaching a pace usually reserved for his hardest workouts. Looking Tony straight in the eye seemed too intimate right now, instead he stared at the other man's reflection on the window glass as he tried to gauge the reaction to his next words. "And I don't know how to take it. Is this just teasing or are we flirting?"
“You want to spare me from being at a party by going to another party?”
"Who invited Captain Capitalism?", he shouted as soon as he was close enough for Steve to hear him.
He picked out one of the younger blossoms and plucked the flower as easily as one would pluck a daisy.
Their words hang in the air as they both were frozen to the spot, afraid to break something very fragile between them if they just as much as breathed wrong.
“Now go and hug Tony like that,” Bucky said over his shoulder. “And tell me that it feels the same.”
“You keep telling yourself that, Captain,” Tony teased as they made their way towards the elevator, not even really knowing what he meant by saying that himself.
Steve rushed forward, his free hand raised in a placating gesture.
"That's just my voice," he said with a roll of his eyes.
Taking a step back, he inspected his lookalike and Steve raised his arms at his sides, silently asking for his opinion.
“Care to explain?” he called over his shoulder, wiping the glasses with his equally violet tie.
“Yes," Tony answered, trying to emphasize his sincerity. “I’m okay. What about you?”
“Being the one who’ll have to endure your whining, I’d say catching a cold is way too big of a sacrifice”, Steve chastised him softly and removed his own scarf.
Never judging, never pitying, his gaze on Tony only ever full of patience and empathy. Every now and then he'd pitch in some kind words or a story of his own.
"Why not?"
Steve shrugged and threw an arm over his shoulder, sharing his super human body heat with Tony, saying “Sure,” and steered him towards the hot beverages as confidently as he would lead him into battle.
"Stop messing with me, Rogers! You're supposed to be a good role model."
He walked closer to admire how the color matched his skin, when he noticed something peculiar.
The next day, Steve was jogging with Bucky through the park much later than usual. Dry leaves were crunching beneath their feet as they sidestepped the many people going for a walk. Even though the air was crisp, the rays of sunlight were strong and warm whenever they peeked from behind the few clouds and that was enough to elicit the people of New York to go outside.
The mass of small heads shook simultaneously.
The billionaire raised a brow, making the face he always gave people when they asked stupid questions.
“We should have hugged enough by now that you know that you don't need to ask.”
“Let's go home. You can talk to Stark and maybe I can get Natasha to spar with me,” he leered with a wiggle of his eyebrows.
Expecting Steve to be making another sketch of New York's skyline, Tony was once again surprised to find that, instead of a pen in his hand and a sketchbook in his lap, there were knitting needles and a ball of wool.
“Now I am embarrassed to say,” Nat drawled. “I'm the Black Widow and I got out-creeped by Captain America.”
It was during a recounting of getting his drunken pa away from a game of dice to bring him back home that they were interrupted by JARVIS softly speaking up.
Steve glanced cross-eyed at the thumb that Tony had raised close to the blonde's face.
“I was intrigued and tried it myself. Turns out, it's not only good for your health, it's also fun and, at the end of the day, you have some tangible reward for all your work."
Steve answered with a smile of his own, mentally already preparing a list with Howard Stark's most hated songs during the war.
He swallowed a bite of his sandwich before he started counting with his fingers. “A week ago, when we didn't know that we were invited to the same gala. The week before that, when my unibeam had knocked you out during training. Last month after the mountain troll ripped an empty armor in half and you thought I was still in there. When you gave a speech at the annual Maria Stark Foundation Charity Event. During that team building event Coulson tricked us to go to that we all hated. On your birthday. On
Steve pulled a large tool box closer and sat down on top of it. He rubbed his hands on his thighs, suddenly noticing that they were damp with sweat. Arbitrary, he found that he was nervous.
“You never grant me that wish either,” the blonde continued to chuckle. “What’s kicked you out of bed?”
“It's not creepy!” Steve groaned. “It's as normal as eating the bones narrow in pudding and gummy bears.”
Tony dropped his eyes from Steve's intense gaze and let his hand fall down to the blue scarf looped around the other's neck.
“You seem to have some practice by now. Do some of those tangible rewards already exist?”
"Thanks for the safe," he told Steve as they went in a wide arc around the fire.
“Spoken like a true bourgeois.”
I’m here for you.”
"No!"
"I'll go somewhere I don't feel inadequate."
“Benefits?”
Steve noticed only now the two cups to-go standing safely in the center console cup holder. Opting to save the argument for later, he picked up one of the cups and took a sip. His face contorted as soon as the bitter taste of black coffee hit his tongue.
“Sacrifices have to be made if one wants to be as stylish as me.”
“What are you doing?” Steve laughed, ducking his head again, a blush high on his cheeks.
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony exclaimed with a hand clutched to his arc reactor. “Stop being such an asshole!”
Tasha's eyes rolled skywards before she grabbed his chin and turned his face to the right direction. "You see your overgrown double making ghost sounds while handing the kids their cotton candy?"
There was a moment of silence before Steve had found the right words to answer.
"That's because I'm not our Black Widow, I am
The trees around them were decorated with yellow and orange shining fairy lights, broad grinning jack-o-lanterns were scattered around the park. The sun was already hanging low enough that the city's large buildings threw long shadows over the area and soon the large fire bowl would be lit.
“I actually thought I would be alone at home today, but since you're here, we should go out, enjoy the nice weather while it lasts.”
Steve felt his ears gathering heat and gave an apologetic smile as he stood up and dusted off his track pants.
He noticed with amusement how their team leader ducked his head to hide the self-complacent grin on his face and shoveled the last bite of his sandwich into his mouth to smother the teasing comment on his tongue.
To his surprise, a lone figure was already standing in front of the giant windows next to the kitchen area, it's dark outline breaching the stark white fog outside. It took his eyes less than a second to adjust to the bright light filtered through the pale mist, but even before that he had recognized his best friend’s posture.
They fell back into an easy conversation about their teammates’ peculiar eating habits until Tony parked the car in the Avengers tower’s underground garage. Nevertheless, despite the return to their light hearted banter, Steve still felt the need to apologize once again for his mindless words.
“Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you when the technobabble makes your head explode,” Tony gave in, picked up the soldering iron again and began to explain his invention to Steve.
The spoon fell out of Tony's trembling hands and landed with a clatter on the kitchen floor. Tony sucked in a deep breath and burrowed his hands into his hair, hiding his face between his arms.
"Too bad you'll never know."
“I can't just
"You don't even follow my orders during important missions, what good would it be in the bedroom?"
“I like listening to you. There's nothing more to it.”
"Is he trying to fuck with me?" he asked perplexed, unable to take his eyes off his best friend.
“Tony,” Steve spoke softly. “You don't have to explain yourself to me. I'm your friend, not your therapist.”
"Yes," she confirmed, finally releasing him.
While his eyes were fixed on Tony’s chest, the smaller man brought up his hands and pressed them against the super soldier’s now naked neck.
“See you later, Tony.”
“You’re bugged,” she stated bluntly. “Why? What were you talking about?"
"Maybe it's because I like you more than we both thought."
"Your imitation of a heartless business owner looks great, but you forgot the glasses in the shape of dollar signs."
“We did?” Steve asked with surprise and this time he earned a full eye roll from Tony.
"Holy shit!" the inventor yelled as he jumped out of his chair and stuck his thumb into his mouth. He glared at Dum-E as he safely put away the burning hot tool and began to scold him around the finger between his lips. "What is wrong with you? Where did you get that? No, stop the beeping, just go into your corner!"
“Nah,” the blonde shook his head ruefully. “It never comes out the way I want it to be, so I've been unraveling it a lot to start over again.”
Rhodey faked retching. “This is gross, we're trying to eat.”
Tired and frustrated, he turned towards the ceiling.
He threw a worried glance over his shoulder at the parents, some of them wearing a disapproving frown while others laughed at the sight of Iron Man finally having met his match in form of a group of first-graders, when his eye caught Steve's.
Bucky came up next to him and they continued to jog at a slightly slower pace, which was still faster than normal people's speed. Steve could practically feel his best friends glare against the side of his face.
“What if you have more important obligations? Avengers related obligations?”
"In some way," Tasha deadpanned.
Tasha graced him with the obligatory roll of her eyes.
“Haha,” Steve said in his most monotone voice. “No, I'm not helping him. He told me about the benefits of knitting-”
With quick steps, Tony went back inside towards the kitchen area, leaving the balcony door open. He had to rummage a bit between the food, but he found his shades beneath a bag of frozen peas. They were ice cold and foggy when he put them on.
Tony watched with increasing worry how the thoughts flitted over Steve's face.
Steve bowed his head and chuckled into his scarf. Tony was delighted to notice that the tips of his ears had turned pink.
Nat only shrugged. “You two go and get changed. You leave a new puddle with every step you take."
“Yes, benefits," Steve huffed. “Now stop interrupting me or I'll stop talking to you.”
And Steve?
“Sorry, my friend's a bit over dramatic,” Bucky told the person as he easily stepped over the leash.
“It will be family friendly,” Steve assured him, a proud gleam in his eyes that told Tony that the tactician had already thought about every important detail. “A meet-and-greet for kids. Kind of like the president does, except that we won't invite the press. Well, apart from Peter, he's surely gonna bring his Nikon.”
Tony's features softened and he rested a supporting hand on the other man's shoulder. "No, giving in to my narcissistic strike and participating in some self-love with my ripped doppelganger would be inappropriate. This is the highest form of flattery."
He knew what was coming the moment the shrewd grin stretched Tony's lips and his ears were already red before the other man finished speaking.
Steve turned towards him with the nastiest stink eye he could muster.
They ate in silence for a while.
“I guess we should go to bed,” the inventor sighed with a self-deprecating smile. “I kept you up long enough. Hey, for not being my therapist, you really know how to get me talking.”
"It's Tony, right? You've got that dumb look on your face," Bucky accused and Steve straightened his features.
“But Captain Communism has such a nice ring to it,'' he quipped as he got off the cab.
Steve chuckled. The other man really was the perfect example for an absent-minded genius, his brain always jumping from one topic to the other. The littlest distractions could alter Tony's attention, yet he never seemed to miss the important things. And whenever those intelligent eyes were focused on him, Steve could feel goosebumps rise at his neck.
Steve returned the smile easily and for a moment they just looked at each other, bathing in the comfortable feeling of their grounded relationship, until yellow blossoms began to creep into the space between them.
Natasha was sitting atop the kitchen counter, the stew already cooking in a pot on the stove next to her. Every now and then she picked up a wooden spoon and stirred the food.
Tony was holding a steaming mug, probably filled with coffee, and wearing comfortable clothes. The sweatpants were one of the few articles from the declined mature hawkeye merchandise line, the billionaire found the deliberately placed arrow on the front of the pants hilarious. The loose fitting sweater was one of Steve’s favourites, the maroon colour suited Tony’s dark features perfectly and it was so soft that Steve had often actively looked for an excuse to touch it.
Tony turned towards him with a stunned expression.
Tony rolled his eyes at his antics. “Alright, Mr. Working Class, keep wiping the floors. But don’t expect a reward.”
Tony nodded his head in small jerks, but kept on talking nonetheless.
A few days later, Tony walked out onto the observation deck in a hurry, searching for that one pair of shades that went perfectly with his light gray Dunhill. Pleasantly surprised to hear slow jazz playing over the speakers, he looked around for Steve, the tower's only inhabitant who frequently enjoyed this kind of music, and found him sitting in a chair close to the guardrail, facing towards the city.
He gave a small wave of his hand that the inventor found silly but returned nonetheless.
Tony let out a long breath. He didn’t like talking about the subject, but Steve was always on and on about the importance of communication, so might as well. “It’s okay, Steve. You know, I wouldn’t have made it this far without your support. You guys have been a big help. My reaction wasn’t the best. It’s still a sensitive topic for me, but it’s gonna be easier with time.”
"That's him."
Tony was the first to move. With swift movements, he looped the scarf around his neck, the blue standing in stark contrast to the maroon sweater. He heaved a deep breath and then met Steve's eyes.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“Of course I do, he's my friend. I'm not one of those guys who are too manly to admit it. I love you, too, you know.”
"Look, kids! It's Captain America!"
"It's barely red. I've seen Iron Man walk off worse injuries, you'll survive."
“The floor’s still wet."
Tony threw a glance over his shoulder at Steve, who busied himself drinking the rest of his probably now cold tea. With a roll of his eyes, he turned back to the food. Of course he couldn’t expect any help from Captain Ineloquent.
When he held it out for Steve to take, the supersoldier recognised the scarf he had made explicitly for his friend and waved his hands in front of him.
"See!" Tony burst out, waving the scarf into Steve's face like some incriminating evidence. "You made me this scarf. How am I supposed to take this?"
“I think there are some violet ones in the freezer,” Steve answered with a furrowed brow.
“I don’t whine!” Tony protested, but offered no complaints when the other man tied the blue garment around his neck. He even went as far as pulling up the zipper on Tony’s Black Widow custom.
Tony leaned back against the railing, nodding his head even though he didn't really understand what Steve meant. They stayed silent for a moment, Steve concentrating on his work, Tony soaking in the sun as well as the soulful music and the warmth that seemed to be radiating from Steve.
There was a loud bang and a curse, and then Tony came fully into view, rubbing his head.
“Good, 'cause whatever you're making, it doesn't even look
“Yeah, him. His wife used to knit them a matching pair of socks every winter, but her arthritis had gotten worse and she can't hold the needles anymore. Walter wants to surprise her with a new pair that he made himself.”
Whereas the shade of blue had clashed with Steve’s eyes, it was exactly the same as his own eye color.
“And it's working, really looks like the sun itself is shining in her,” Tony lauded as he watched Dum-E placing the flower into the smoothie mixer jar. He hoped with all his might that he wouldn't accidentally drink the sunflower, next time he told the robot to mix a green smoothie.
"Are you really mad at me for making you a gift?" Steve frowned, feeling unsure, but also unwilling to take the scarf back and shoved his hands into his pockets.
"Just to make sure we're on the same page here, you want to try to be in a relationship with me?"
“But you are okay?” Steve asked a bit cautiously.
Steve looked at him in confusion. “What voice?”
Steve wasn't sure if it was a nightmare or a relapse that had Tony crouching on the kitchen floor, but he counted out a streak of genius innovation. Those mostly came with more confidence in the inventor's posture and a lot more manic energy.
"And give Bucky an aneurism?" Steve feigned indignation. "I got the feeling as his best friend I have to object. Besides, you didn't even change your hair for the costume. Authenticity doesn't seem to be your priority."
They both looked in confusion at the sunflower before noticing Dum-E still next to them, dutifully holding the flower, and finally running out of patience for not being paid attention to.
“That’s because you’re weak Americans." If her voice sounded disinterested, Tony was sure that it was just because she already knew what was going on.
"We could still try." Steve got his predicted answer along with a flirtatious wink.
“I heard a lot about Howard since I've woken up in the future and it's kind of difficult to connect the young version in my head to- to this… well- this asshole.”
"He's an idiot," Tony grumbled as he examined his burned skin. "He's the reason of 80% of my lab accidents. Look at this blister!"
?" Tony asked delighted.
“There was
After an energizing jog and a refreshing shower Steve took the stairs up towards the community kitchen. He didn’t mind the extra training for his legs and the four floors had him hardly out of breath.
“Can I hug you, Tony?”
“The veteran you met last memorial day?”
“If you ever want to talk about it, about
"You okay? It’s gotten pretty chilly out there.”
“No-”
“You wanna know the secret ingredient?” she whispered loudly, with one of her hands cupping her mouth.
“Vodka?” Tony threw in, just to annoy her, and continued to slurp his dish.
“Your father?” Tony asked carefully and Steve met his gaze with glassy eyes. “There was a side note, in your S.H.I.E.L.D files.”
Usually, he would go with one of the following two actions. He would either give a half-hearted chuckle at the ridiculous words, looking at the ground to hide the blush on his cheeks, or he would give back as good as he got. But, thanks to Bucky, he had spent the last days giving too much thought to his interactions with Tony and today, for the first time in a long time, he refused to do either.
"No, it's your
He didn't even know that he had taken his phone out until the click of the camera brought Tony back to his senses.
“That may be true for normal people, but we are
"Shit, kid, slow down!" Tony exclaimed with a laugh as the boy skidded over the damp grass and was only saved by Iron Man's quick reflexes.
As he creeped closer, he could hear Tony humming a familiar happy tune, before he started singing beneath his breath.
Steve chimed in and let out a hearty laugh as he watched the invincible Iron Man jump out of his skin.
“Steve-” Tony tried to interrupt him, not entirely sure how he felt about other people worrying about his concerns, but the Captain didn't let himself be stopped.
He decided to play it safe and walked over to the freezer to pull out a tub of ice cream. Pistachio wasn't his favorite, but he knew that Tony liked it best. He gathered two spoons next and held one out towards Tony.
"Try apple bobbing. Put that big mouth to good use," Steve returned the wave.
“So, what is the secret ingredient?”
“Thanks. For the heating and for picking me up.” He looked down at the cup in his hands. “And for the tea. It’s just the way I like it.”
The passenger window rolled down and Steve was greeted by Tony Stark's wide smile, bright as the city lights reflecting on the car’s wet surface. Perched on his nose was a pair of mirrored shades with a golden reflection.
Noticing his bad choice of words, Steve turned his full body towards Tony. “No! I’m sorry, that’s not what I- I mean, I know that you don’t… do that. It’s literal, you just shouldn’t drink coffee and drive with only one hand, considering the bad weather and all. I didn’t think before I spoke. Sorry," he finished lamely as he sank back into his seat.
“If I didn’t know better I’d swear you’re not a grown-up, but two kids in a trench coat disguised as a billionaire.”
The ding of the elevator arriving at the first stop was drowned out by Steve’s laugh.
“Stop! Don’t move!”
When he moved back, he watched with fascination how the other man's eyelids fluttered open and those brown eyes holding so much warmth beamed at him. Despite the chaste kiss, his breathing had turned ragged and his chest felt tight with emotions. He couldn't keep from grinning even if he tried, happiness radiating from him.
They both chuckled, content with their familiar banter, yet uncomfortable with the unclear meaning of their words.
drink and drive!” he nearly shouted. “There is no alcohol in this, you tasted it.”
A few stitches were askew but the textile felt soft to the touch. Tony recognized it easily as the one Steve had been knitting himself.
Natasha then eyed him before saying. “JARVIS where is Tony?”
Steve was about to ask him what that meant, completely confused when the glass of the workshop turned clear.
It took a few minutes but eventually Steve entered the room making sure to close the door behind his as he entered Bucky’s peripheral vision.
“Don’t say that to Tony. He’ll have a fit.” The words were out of Steve’s mouth before he ccould think and a tension filled up the room again. Both assassins shot him a look but thankfully didn’t say anything in response or talk more about Tony.
“What Steve? Did you just leave after he said all that? Didn’t you fight it?” Clint carelessly threw his word at Steve not realizing the impact they were having.
I need you to leave. I need distance right now.”  Steve wanted to yank all his hair out. It’s obvious that Tony wasn’t getting what he was saying, and every time he tried to explain he seems to make it worse.
“Well he’s going to be like that again. This incidence has probably brought out all his insecurities and that conversation just added logs to the fire. He’s going to think he’s not good enough again. Not good enough for you or the team.”
That floored Steve. “What? Nothing is funny about that. What are you talking about?”
Steve felt like his eyes might bulge out of their socket. “What? No! How would that help? Tony’s got enough to deal with without me piling on.”
Steve didn’t even try to continue with the paperwork by this point. Just waiting for Tony’s reply. When Tony did, it was with 2 sequential texts.
There was a slight pause before “Then why did you add LOL to it? What’s funny about you leaving?” Clint shot back.
Which unfortunately made his messed up brain flash not wonderful things about the world at him.
Tony tried to wait Steve out but really he knew he was delaying the unavoidable, so eventually he spoke again. “Steve you pull me up to be better which means that I drag you down. I can’t be selfish by picking my own happiness over yours. If I had one wish it would be for you to be happy.”
In Steve’s head the chance that JARVIS has been compromised increased. He became concerned. Turning Steve went to find the others. Maybe they’ve seen Tony or maybe knew what was up with JARVIS.
Natasha tried to peak at Steve’s face by prying at his hands, but Steve wouldn’t budge. Sighing she continued, “If it makes you feel better, I do think you’re partially at fault here.” Steve finches but is otherwise still. “Just like Tony is partially responsible. You both had the chance to talk it out but you both assumed the worse immediately which always ends with a yelling match between you two that solve nothing and only hurts you both more. You guys need to get a handle on your emotions and talk like adults instead of expressing yourselves like a toddler.” Natasha then patted Steve on the head before continuing, “We’ll work on it when this is over. What happened next Steve?”
To be honest, Bucky definitely wasn’t above cheating but JARVIS was enlisted to monitor Bucky in the tower and he was to be with someone, who wasn’t just Tony, when he was out of the tower.
Tony seemed to hesitate and Steve could only hope it was to serious consider the question. Finally, Tony opened his mouth, “No Cap, like I said before, we’re over. That text might have been the insighting incident but that doesn’t make this break up any less real.”
“Yeah man, just think about what would happen if you didn’t do something because of your insecurities and then Tony interprets it as you not wanting him anymore? We’re be up a creek without a paddle for sure.” Clint added as his own little bit of 2 cents. Natasha would have scolded him for his lack of tact, but he’s been keeping quiet and not making anything worse surprisingly well during the conversations, so she let it slide.
“Steve don’t you dare wallow in self pity while Tony is suffering. You need to go fix it!” Which just caused Steve to roll into another round of sobs. Natasha whipped her head around to glare at Bruce, fearless of the Hulk.
“I’m fine,” as soon as he said it he knew everyone was going rebut that, so he continued. “Physically anyways.” Bruce backed off. Now the next part was telling them what had happened without throwing up and/or breaking down, because if he said it, then it would be real. So, he spoke the easy part first. “Tony is fine. I guess he spilled his pills everywhere and didn’t pick them back up. He was probably just asleep from all the alcohol.” That at least seemed to settle some of their concerns.
Steve didn’t know what was wrong, but he had a distinct feeling that this was a crossroad. He be damned if he didn’t fight for it to be in his favor, “Tony, I ….” but Tony cut him off pretty quick.
Natasha and Clint looked between themselves a second, which was enough time for them to have a silent debate, come to a consensus, then play mental chicken to determine who had to tell Steve.
“Also, I bet knowing you have insecurities too would help Tony with his own self worth. Assure him that he’s not weak for not always believing in himself. Think of it as a bonding exercise. If you trust Tony with your secrets. Maybe he’ll be more inclined to disclose his own to you.” Natasha added.
He entered the bedroom to find…… no one. Something seemed off though. Steve didn’t know what the problem was, but he trusted his gut. He raised his fists defensively as he entered. He noticed that there seemed to be things missing from the nightstand. Had someone broken in? A theft? It wasn’t likely with JARVIS around, but you never know. He knew Tony would be offended at him for even thinking it, but he didn’t know enough about tech to know for certain that JARVIS hasn’t been compromised. Steve checked the bathroom while keeping his eye on the bedroom door. Nothing. Only place left to check was the closet. He flipped it open to find…. The cloth from an entire rack on the right, on Tony’s side, was gone. He.. He didn’t know what to make of it.
Clint looked about ready to punch him, but he just felt hollow. Natasha had enough senses to stepped in.
“Maybe we can talk about it later but right now I need to be alone.” Talk! Later! He’s mind clung to those word because Yes, they could talk later. Sort this out! Maybe it wasn’t true? Maybe he can convince Tony to take him back once Tony had some time to himself! Maybe he can sort out the right things to say in that time. Maybe he can come up with a convincing case to beg Tony to take him back.
“Tony I’m SORRY okay? I was angry and…” All Steve’s fight seemed to drain from him then.
Tony made what was probably an affirmation to Steve’s question but with his lips so stretched tight around Steve’s girth it was hard to tell.
“Look, I understand what happened. I’m a genius and I catch on quick. But it happened Cap, no way to put everything that’s happened into a box and shove it in the corner now. If your want forgiveness for making that stupid typo you got it. I’m not mad Cap, honestly.”
Tony closes his eyes and takes a long breath. “I appreciate you coming down here to try and spare my feelings Cap, but you didn’t need to do that.”
Steve stayed slumped but continued “I saw that Tony was upset so I tried to explain again why I was upset this morning. I don’t remember exactly what I said but I’m pretty sure that that’s the moment it all went wrong” Steve took a moment to think while trying to calm his breathing.
Basically leaping from the chair to on top of the bed Bucky shoved his sweatpants to his thighs finally releasing his cock from confinement and thrusting into Tony without even lubing his dick first.
And now their concerns seemed to double. He wishes he could feel some happiness over how much everyone cares about the two of them, and how they understood that this was a huge blow to him without him having to say it.
“AH.. Stev… It’s so good. … You’re completely stretching me…..ah ….I feel like I can feel you in my throat…” Tony panted back.
“Don’t feel guilty Tony, we’ll do all the appreciating of progress for you, okay? So you really don’t need to feel guilty. You focus on furthering change and helping those that need it. How does that sound?”
Steve decided to just tell the truth and not dance around anything. He doesn’t want to prolong Tony’s suffering. He also took a moment to reassure himself and decided to trust his instincts.
“Well you’re going to have to beg for it then.”
“For you Steve. You bring out the best in him. You two bring out the best in each other.” Natasha was looking at him with conviction, and then Clint pulled his attention.
“You looking for Tony?” Steve turned to see Bruce appeared from the elevator. “I was trying to find him before to see how the pain meds were working. I’m pretty sure he is in the lab because when I went to look there, it was on lock down. JARVIS wouldn’t let me in though. He didn’t tell me anything either. It basically guaranteed that Tony has forbidden JARVIS from talking about it.”
“So by the time you woke up in the chair it was already 11:45pm. I made sure that it was past Midnight before I told JARVIS to release you,” Steve explained looking apologetic.
Looking at the comment Tony was surprised that his didn’t sound that bitter. Huh, maybe he was finally becoming an adult after all. He looked around the room. Before they were a couple it used to be Tony’s room, but Tony didn’t want to kick Steve out if he considers it his room now. He grabbed a bunch of his cloth from the closet, as well as, his pills, a few important pictures from the nightstand, and his toothbrush from the bathroom, and headed down to the workshop. He set himself up there until he found another room he wanted. Might as well stay since he was going to go to the workshop to mope and mourn their relationship in peace. The workshop will always be his safe haven, his sanctuary. Knowing himself he wasn’t going to leave for a while, so he might as well have supplies.
God he was so frustrated. The large piles of broken equipment and targets that Bucky had gone through in last month attested to how often he’d had to find other ways to expend all that residual sexual energy.
“Then you’re breaking up with me, is that what you’re saying Tony? Because again I ain’t breaking up with you.”
“I understand Steve. I really do. It’s for the team, right?” and for a second Steve had thought that Tony had got it, got how he was feeling, got how much everyone cared. But then Tony’s expression turned sad as he looked down “It’s for you too.” And Steve realized that something was very wrong.
Well he had told Tony he’d need multiple rounds. Bucky promptly pounced on Tony.
“WHY DO YOU THINK?!”
This left Tony sitting by himself, hand still out to hand his cellphone to Bruce, in a now empty lab. The franticness he was feeling was fading, leaving behind ice as its replacement. Oh, of course Bruce would leave once he understood the true. That Tony was the one at fault and Steve hadn’t done anything wrong. That Tony had been a liability, putting them all at risk. Of course, Bruce wouldn’t feel like Tony deserved comfort once it became obvious that Tony had brought this all on himself. It’s what he deserves.
Bruce stiffened a little and pressed a bit. “That’s not what I heard. Steve said….” Bruce then paused and back tracked. “You didn’t make him miserable Tony! Of course not. You made Steve the happiest he’s ever been. It was obvious to anyone even if he didn’t say so all the time and wasn’t make those love sick sighs throughout the day. He did it so often that Clint threated to castrate him, and when then didn’t work, he capped Steve at 15 a day. 15, Tony!” Bruce then took a deep breath and tried to stay calm while addressing the second part of Tony’s statement. “And you don’t put us at risk Tony. You have all of our backs. Have saved each of us countless times. Saved countless more civilians. You’re a huge asset to the team Tony. Why would you say you put our safety as risk? Did Steve say something? Is this related to what happened with Osborn this morning?” Even Bruce could hear the anger in his voice at the end of the statement. He saw Tony cringe which was all the motivation he needed to double down on suppressing the other guy. Plus, he used this lab a lot and he’d be pretty upset if the other guy trashed all his hard work.
Bucky and Steve smirked at each other. “Well look at that, not that we needed anymore proof of how slutty Tony is.” Then the calm broke and Steve took his already lubed cock in hand guiding it to Tony’s taunt hole. Tony was definitely looser than he’d been before Bucky had fucked him due to Bucky’s girth and how sloppily he’d bin shoving his cock into Tony but God they were so huge. it’s a wonder how Tony can even take one of them and now they were both going to shove in there. That thought turned Bucky on so much that he was mildly concerned about there being no more blood left for his brain.
As his slowly got his vision back, he was starting to realize that he was in Steve’s lap. Fuck
“No, I was wrong.” Steve stated firmly. “I shouldn’t have said you compromised the team. It was a low blow and completely not true. I’ve been thinking about it and if we weren’t dating would you still have dove in front of that bomb?”
Now that his anger has subsided, he felt sort of terrible. Not about yelling at the reporters because really, they’d deserved it, but retrospectively he should have thought about how he’s speech came off to his misfit pair of lovers from the 1920s. He hadn’t meant to undermine what they must have gone through back then. They probably think he’s a total ass for minimizing the social progresses of society that to them must seem like a miracle.
“I understand Steve. I really do. It’s for the team, right?” He could almost feel a sad smile on his lips as he looked down at nothing in particular. “It’s for you too.”
Steve pointedly cleared his voice. “Now as I’m the impatient type,” which caused Bucky to scoff. Steve was, in fact, patient about everything except sex. Steve pointedly ignored him and carried on, “I figured we’d skip the foreplay. Plus the entire last month was foreplay for you Buck,” he chipped cheerfully as he turned Tony to face him while holding Tony’s legs apart so that Bucky got a full view of Tony’s hole plugged up by a thick vibrator. Bucky could only groan staring at the two together. Tony made the cutest noises and they turn him on so much.
“Oh Steve,” Natasha stops him before his spiral could become even more self deprecating. “I’m sorry Steve, I should have realized. We all got fooled because you’re always trying to help Tony with his insecurities, we should have recognized that you have them too. You must get some mean stuff thrown at you because Tony’s a lot older and rich.”
Steve had made is most of the way in with a inch still to go. “God Buck, it’s like a vice around my cock, I just can’t get that last bit in even with my strength,” Steve panted out before he started to pull back out. “I guess I need to fuck you loose first Tony. How’s that sound sweet pea? What are you feeling?”
” Steve realized he was back to crying but he kept going. “and what can I say to that? Up til that point I’d thought it was all about what happened this morning but all of a sudden Tony’s telling me he can’t do this relationship anymore and that’s when I realized that we haven’t been talking about this morning for a long time and he just looked so exhausted. I..I thought that …..” The waterworks was starting to make talk very hard. “He wasn’t breaking up with me because of this morning. He just didn’t want me anymore and all I could think is how I’m probably the reason he looks so exhausted and this morning had just been the last straw. And then I thought back to all the times I still spend arguing with him and all the times I forced him to eat or sleep or watch movies with me. He has a company to run and millions of people depending on him, so he must have thought I was so controlling. I mean, he’s an adult. He’s survived this long. Who am I to say when he should be eating and sleeping.” He was spiralling, and he could feel it, but he couldn’t seem to stop. “Oh god Tasha” He basically flung himself into Natasha’s arms. “…
They had specified that he was still allowed to see sexual activity since there were a few members of the Avengers (Read: Steve and Tony) that really seemed to think that sexual activity on every surface in the tower was necessary and it wouldn’t be fair for Bucky to lose if he’d accidentally seen while walking down the hall. However, right now Bucky couldn’t decide if he liked that rule or not. Steve had taken an inordinate amount of pleasure in taunting Bucky by having sex with Tony around the tower in places where he knew Bucky would see.
“I’m not the one you need to convince Steve. Convince Tony. He’s just had all his insecurities confirmed. It won’t be as easy as shoving his insecurities all back in a box again. It’s gonna take time to herd all the insecurities back and that will take determintion and dedication. Are you really okay with starting back at square one again?”
“I..? No. I didn’t take any?! I spilled those on the ground and was too lazy to pick them up!” he said as he realized that, of course, no wonder Steve was worried. He would have freaked out too if he broke up with someone and they then looked like they’d committed suicide.
Steve headed for the lab. With the workshop in the state it was currently in, Tony would have moved to a new spot to isolate himself. That’s good news for him since the lab don’t have the same ability to keep people out as the workshop did. Even if the door was lock, Steve could easily just remove the door from the frame.
