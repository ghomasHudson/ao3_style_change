“We don’t know what Simon will make you do, do we.” Andi looked at him from the side of her eye as if uncertain what he would do at that very moment. “John needed to know so he could protect you, and himself, from whatever you might do.”
“You said,” I whisper close to his ear, “that you would submit to my expertise. For tonight, I am John. And if all goes well, the next time you are here at Angelo’s, there will be no need to pretend; it will be your John’s thigh touching you. John’s hand, touching you. Here.”
“Do you not see?”  Sherlock persisted.  “Gareth be who he said he is, sent by my father to take me home, not murder me.”
John licked his lips, his gaze locked on Sherlock’s face. That aggravating, infuriating, exasperating, beautiful, beautiful face that he couldn’t imagine living without, and John nodded his head. He wasn't going anywhere, not without Sherlock.
With those two words, John knew that he be forgiven.  And he knew what he had seen in Sherlock’s eyes.  Relief.
“We need to drop my brother’s car by the Diogenes Club on our way.  It seems with an entire government’s resources at his disposal they cannot find him transportation.”
“This be useless!”  Sherlock tugged the filthy rag wrapped around his face down to his neck, wrinkling his nose at the stench of it.  “For three days and nights we have watched the house.  For three days and nights we have dressed up in these…
Can’t say I glimpse a bit of that happiness anywhere in the room right now.  Sherlock is still sat like a rock as he looks at me, his eyebrow now lifting as if saying, “Oh, really.”
But finally, numbly, he moved to the door, eyes downcast as he entered. Bolstering himself for what he was about to see. And when he raised his head, he was acutely aware that his brain wasn’t functioning properly, for what he saw couldn’t possibly be real.
I look at Katie, her face blessed with the smooth, dewy skin of youth; I feel my age as I sit beside her.  But I marvel that no matter how old the outside of me looks, inside I feel as young as ever.  I remember when I was young, thinking that when I got older being in love would somehow lose its intensity, that it would be comfortable and staid.  Now I know that isn’t true at all, love is love at any age. It’s thrilling and effervescent and the most exciting thing on Earth; it’s only the exterior of me that’s lost its shine.
“Well, if you must know, the Finnemore case still baffles me.  Testing my theory of how long it takes to reach maximum arousal in REM sleep, I found you to be a convenient test subject, so I…”
“And this must be your daughter.  May I hold her?”  Mrs. Hudson stretched her arms out to take the little girl. “She looks
Sherlock pressed his nose against the window, anguished by what he saw. Unable to look away. Logic told him the sight before him was a delusion, yet his heart was not convinced. His gaze drifted to the cluster of pictures on the wall. Pictures from his childhood displaying a family of three, not four.
Bleary-eyed, he scanned the room for the bucket; he could not remember where it be and he did not think he had it in him to waste even a few steps going in the wrong direction.  Seeing it, with unsteady steps he tottered over.
I do not touch him; I do not know if he wants me to.  But that is fine, I am happy just to be near him.  Happy to breathe the same air as him.  I lie on my back, my arms lying stiffly at my sides as they did that first night I slept with him.   It seems so long ago.
Sherlock also knew he did not hide himself to study the others unguarded; that he could accomplish with but a glance. Cedric: orphan; pure of body; scar on left hand - fell into a fire at the age of 6; has night terrors which leave his bed soaked with sweat and urine. Aldus: fearful of demons; the man who calls himself his father be his uncle; beds any willing creature, whether woman, man, or goat. Eduard: loyal; tends large rose gardens when at home; does not wish to be a knight, but obediently concedes to the life he is destined. John: Ahhh, John. A complex man not easily read. Yes, faithful and true to his calling, carries a sorrow from which he will never be free, but there is so much Sherlock cannot discern. So much more he wants to know.
“Because my mother has spent much of her life yearning for a man who spurned her.  She did marry again and had another family, but deep in her heart her first husband will always be her true love.  And their separation be all because of a misunderstanding.  Had her first husband had faith in her love for him, they would still be together.  Of course, I would never have been born,” Colin chuckled.  “But the point be, I do not want to see the same thing happen to you.  Have faith in Sir John, Sherlock.  Give him reason to have faith in you.  Do not let misunderstandings come between you.”
Sherlock hovered just inside as medical staff coordinated their efforts, moving hospital bed and equipment seamlessly from inside the removal van to the Rudnikov’s house—all the while protecting John from unnecessary jostling. It was no small effort, one that Sherlock endured with anxiety.
Laila washed herself with fresh water Colin had brought her that evening, humming as she went through her weekly ablutions.  Twas a tune she had loved for many a year, one that had been played to her and her family by fine musicians in a fine home.  The home she did not miss; the family she did.  Most of all she missed her elder son with an ache that was always with her.  Twas not natural for a mother to be separated from her own flesh and blood.  Twas not natural that a son would not know who is mother be.  But at that moment she almost felt restored.  As if everything in the world were perfect.  She pushed to the back of her mind that her peace would end soon; she knew well enough from experience it would.  But for now she would pretend that everything was as it should be.
I am stunned.  He has already been diagnosed and it is terminal.  Is this a condition that has been lurking for some time and he has been hiding it from me?  I have never known him to be so deceptive.  It must be serious indeed for him to try to protect me from its consequences.
As John washed his hands in between patients, he thought about how sometimes Todd’s playfulness, while exciting, could veer into irresponsibility.  Like this morning.  Most times John would be thrilled to be cuffed to the bed and ‘tortured’, but not when he had to get to work or had some other responsibility that took precedence.  He didn’t understand how Todd didn’t get that. He knew that Todd took his own career very seriously and would never jeopardize his own livelihood.  John shook his head; there was no time to think about that now.
“I said, let me know when thou be done feeling sorry for thyself.”  John poured water into a tub, looking wholly unperturbed.
“I don’t think we should be having an argument now; we are about to have a baby.  Besides, you know I will win.”
yes.”  His eyes, which briefly glazed over, clear, and he climbs into bed beside me.  If I did not know him better, I would think he were as nervous as I.
Quickly getting down to business, Sherlock told John, “Here’s your new phone; Mycroft deactivated our mobiles so we couldn’t be tracked.  The important numbers you need are programmed into it, and it answers to the same number as your old one.
Approached two months earlier, Sanjay Hazarika’s services were contracted for the generous sum of £250,000 if he successfully completed the network on schedule.  Of particular interest to Sherlock was the description of the ‘official’; most certainly she carried false identification.
"Alone you shall be then, but if it be alright with you, I, too, will travel alone. Tis pure coincidence tis beside you."
Thought about Gareth, frustrated he had not found the man who had slain Eduard.  He had been certain that they would be followed, that another attempt would be made on his life.  They had met many people on the road - monks, noblemen, merchants - but none be the man Aldus and Cedric had seen at the alehouse.  It frustrated him that he did not know what the knife looked like, that the boot impressions had been obscured by the muddied water.  Then, should they have met someone they suspected be disguised, he could have inspected their boots, their weaponry.
Captivated, Sherlock followed Stamford to the cab—his bare feet stepping through piled snow, his dressing gown buffeted by a frigid gale—and yet he had no sense of being cold.
Sherlock sprang up, dashing to the two bags still sitting a few feet away. Rummaging through the Tesco bag, he dived under the folded shirts and pants (
But whatever he was about to say got lost as Sherlock stepped so close to him he felt his breath brush his face. Sherlock stared into his eyes with an intensity that sent a shiver down his spine. And with no warning, Sherlock took him by his shoulders and pushed him back, causing him to stumble the few steps until his back collided with a thud into the stable wall behind him. Making quick work of untying the rope around John’s waist and jacking his breeches to his ankles, Sherlock dropped to his knees, taking John’s semi-soft member into his mouth.
I follow John to the balcony door, and he opens the blind.   The sun is bright, but as it does not shine directly into my mouth, it is of no help.
I catch my breath enough to say, “No, John. I mean it this time; you are an idiot if you think I do not want to kiss you.”
“Relax, sweetheart.  This won’t hurt, I promise.” His voice is almost as soothing as his hand.  His other hand joins the first and he is rubbing, rubbing.  His thumbs press circles into my muscles.
“John?”  Sherlock pulled the blankets up over them to keep them warm; he could see the goose bumps forming on John’s arms.
I consented, and settled down with my leg upon a footstool and a novel in hand, while Holmes arranged himself against me with one leg cast over the arm of the chair and his head thrown back against my shoulder. Here we sat, while all the spinning world returned to normalcy, and my heart was calmed. Aside from Holmes's pleasant proximity, today was an ordinary day, a day in which I was to amuse myself whilst Holmes locked his intellect in battle with a new foe. I had a new ally in Mary, new warmth from Holmes, a remarkable little tale to ruminate upon and, eventually, write — yes, there was nothing more to worry about than that.
"I believe," he said, "That Miss Mary Morstan believes our relationship — or perhaps merely your feelings towards me — to be somewhat less than proper. This was not my initial theory, but she clearly believed that your affections were elsewhere, and where else but me? And why else would she allude to me, in such a personal and domestic matter?"
"I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world," I said, though perhaps not quite so eloquently. "I have brought you a fortune."
"What a way with innuendo your little lady has!" said he. "It seems to me you might have secured a dangerously quick woman, Watson!"
"Eventually, I grew the nerve to ask him what his intentions were. He looked surprised, and then upset, and then he begged forgiveness, for he'd believed I understood his meaning when he told me — and he had told me — that he was following August into the army, and that he hoped to stay a bachelor for life. I was confused, and sore at heart, and so I fled from him. Later, he came to me and said he saw now how I could have easily imagined him to be joking, and that he would marry me in an instant if it was what would please me best. But it was no good; I knew his... Bohemian spirit was at odds with his honourable nature in this matter. I felt sure he would fulfil what he now perceived to be his obligation to me without it bringing him a shred of happiness of his own, and I could not let him do that."
“His knife. Where is his knife?” Sherlock patted Eduard’s hips. “Cedric? Aldus? Did he not have it with him?”
“But why?  If he be educated why would he leave home for so long, and if what you say be true, why without recompense?  Why would it not be someone else who came for you?”
Shining the light into my mouth, he says, “No redness, no swelling. Can’t see any signs of infection.  I don’t know, Sherlock.”
She watched Sherlock think through what she said. His processes were slowed due to whatever he’d been exposed to.
Sherlock’s nose scrunched in confusion.  “Done this before?  I distinctly remember twas thee in the stable.  Does thou not remember?”
Twas no doubt John be restless, but Sherlock be the one with whom he wanted to dance.  The one John wanted to twirl until Sherlock grew so dizzy he lost his balance, and John would catch Sherlock in his arms and they would laugh and kiss and start over from the beginning.
“John.”  The name carried from his lips, reaching his ears as though from far away.  Surely it had to have come from another, for he was far too disoriented to have the ability to convert any thought to sound.
I had offered John and Katie my spare room to save on expenses, but he adamantly refused to move in with me. He said the spare body parts in the fridge did not provide a proper environment for a toddler.   When I demanded of him what proof he had for that conclusion, he could provide me with no definitive answer.  Still, I could not get him to agree it was perfectly natural for a child to find a head in the refrigerator.  That it would encourage her toward an interest in the sciences; the world needs more female scientists.  Unable to offer a logical argument, he just spluttered, turning an odd shade of red before he gave me one of
“Not only will you live,” he continued, “but you will have the opportunity to kill again.  And you will be richly rewarded for it.”  Finally the clear blue eyes turned toward him.  Aahhh, he had her attention.
John groaned.  He did not want to move, to do so would only make the hooves pound harder, but his bladder told him that if he did not rise and relieve it, he would embarrass himself.  Light stabbed at his eyes when he opened them, and he quickly shut them.
“The tall, thin bloke? The one who looks down his nose at everyone, and never says anything unless tis a sharp rebuke?  He?
John grunted. “Well, even if you doubt it, do me the favor of getting some fruit or something from the kitchen. One patient around here is enough.”
Sherlock’s second revelation of the day left John reeling far more than the first.  And that was without sharing the small bit of information that he suspected Mary of colluding with Shirkov to end the detective’s life.
Sherlock focused on the dirt below him, and when he lifted his head, his gaze settled on Sir John. “The price you paid for me is far less than my worth and my Lord is certain to search for me.  As well, you underestimate those ‘heathens’; they will hunt me down.  They will bring many men, and if I go with you, they will kill you and your men, too. No, it is best I be off on my own.”
He could see the outline of Sherlock’s form, standing upright quite steadily, rinsing his hair of shampoo.  But still…  “You alright?” he asked.
I am gratified to hear this.  I do not want to go through the immense amount of time and effort it would take to find a suitable replacement.  Tedious.
“Tell me again why I have to dress like this to go into London.”  His hands on his hips, John glared at Sherlock.
“Mary?!  Why would he be with Mary?” Sherlock’s voice carried through the hallway, his astonishment causing him to forget the hushed tone he used.
Slipping his hand into John’s and weaving their fingers together, Sherlock lay for some time, stroking John’s pulse point with his thumb. And as he did, the same odd sense of possessiveness Sherlock had felt earlier coursed through him, building in strength until it became rage.  Rage that someone had dared hurt John.  Rage that it been he himself who had hurt John.  No, he had not been the one who had wielded the knife, but twas little difference.  Twas he who the attacker targeted and he had not stopped them.
“Then, tis settled, John,” Sherlock said.  “I will attend to you as squire as you desire.  And my first duty will be to lure the assailant and capture him.”
“Can you get it a little closer? Thanks. From here, it looks like…it looks like an egg with glasses.”
“You look fine.  Just,” John cleared his throat, “fine, Sherlock.  I would have no trouble at all perceiving you as an overseer.”
“But I didn’t save him. I’ve never done anything for him but offer to share a flat. It was the danger he craved.”
The bag had to be from John; Sherlock knew no one else in the city.  Loosening the string, he peered inside; it be full of coins.  No doubt one or two be “borrowed” by the innkeeper before the girl brought it.
The Judge pushes the papers aside and, resting His elbows on the desk in front of Him, says, “Acts of kindness are predominantly not of an unselfish nature.
Sherlock’s face be free of guile, as be his words. John could not help but be touched, some of his anger seeping from him.
But the wedding picture, beside where he’d set the ring, distracted him from his quest for alcohol. In the picture were two men, so devastatingly in love. His own face, beaming up at Sherlock with such wonder. Christ, he’d been so fucking happy, barely believing that he, John Hamish Watson, had been bestowed the miracle of calling Sherlock “husband.”
“Mr. Holmes. Your brother deactivated his mobile, and we lost sight of him after he and Agent Rasperson had the spin-out, but we were able to re-establish a connection with the device that programs the dog. We believe Mr. Holmes has reached his destination, Sir. He has been in the same location for the last several minutes, and we are closing in on him. You are being given this information as a courtesy. Agent Rasperson’s safety is our primary concern, but we will do our best to keep your brother safe, as well. Ultimately, it depends on him.”
“And just how does thou know?”  He wanted to believe Sherlock, truly, he did. But what did they actually know about Colin?  Looking down at their clasped hands, John marveled at how, with Sherlock by his side, he felt complete. Twas as if having him near made everything that could be wrong, right; but he knew twas only his sentiment talking.
“Cedric be not in the house, but he has been.  Very recently.”  Sherlock kept his voice low, ducking his head whenever someone passed near them.  “Next to a bed that could only be his, there be boot prints from dried mud.  The prints be too large to belong to any other occupants of the house, and the rest of the house be meticulously clean; before I left, the housemaid had already cleaned the mud I brought in on my boots.  The woman I presume be his aunt be very nervous when I entered his room, saying he be most adamant that no one go in there, not even her or their housemaid.  That he be peculiarly private.  And there be one more setting at the table than be people in the house.”
Minutes earlier, though she hadn’t wanted to disturb them, she hadn’t been able to keep herself from checking on her fathers; several hours had passed without any sign of Pére.  She would just pop her head in to see if there were anything Dad or Pére needed.  But what she found shocked her to the core.  Not only was Dad gone, but so was Pére.
“John, I will be back soon.” I throw my legs over the side of the lounge, training my eyes on him to see his reaction.  If I am not wrong, and I am so rarely wrong, he is too involved with his text to join me.
John knew shock was a serious medical condition and didn’t want to get into a battle of wills with Sherlock.  One thing he had come to know about the detective in their months of Skyping was that the man was decidedly stubborn; if he said he didn’t want medical attention then there would be no one allowed near him.  Unless…
Two years ago, during a period of time when our sex life lay almost dormant, John brought home a book he purchased online in hopes we could revive the “magic”.  He had missed the closeness our sexual relationship had brought us, and I had, too.
Even though John had figured out that Sherlock was not a sentimental man, had come to know that friendship did not hold a high priority in the solitary man’s life, he understood that for Sherlock this was the closest he would come to saying that he wanted John to come home.  Wanted to spend time with him in person.
Sherlock sulks, but in a moment he’s fine, settling into bed, impatient for me to join him.  “Get over here!”
Faster than I can say “chloramphenicol” the blanket is on the bed, plugged in, and John and I are snuggled under the covers…warm and
“You might want to get dressed; the food is about ready.” John sipped from his mug. “You were mumbling something about sausages in your sleep, so I thought that might fit the bill.”
I stare at the book I hold in my hand, unable to see a single word.  My heart is racing; John still wants me.  He still loves me.
Thank you for reading along and making my journey writing this story that much more pleasurable. :-)
“‘Half-cocked.’  I do nothing of the kind," Sherlock had snorted when he had recovered from the slight.  "I have created the per-” Seeing John’s unfavorable reaction he had bit himself off.  “We.  I mean
Having already gotten John unbuttoned, Sherlock stripped him of his jeans and pants in one swift motion, letting the clothing fall to a pile at his feet.  Wrapping those long (gloriously long, fucking gorgeous) fingers around John's already erect cock, he stroked the silky shaft that was thick with arousal.  He stared into John’s eyes as he pumped him.  Watched John’s breathing grow ever more rapid and shallow.  Watched as the smaller man’s eyes closed, his head tipping back, mouth open.
John struggled to participate, but without being able to move his hands or his legs, all he could do was suffer.  Suffer the raging fire that was in his loins, watch the blond head bob up and down, listen to the occasional undignified slurp or smack.
But now?  After all these years be it wrong to keep Colin and Sherlock from each other? Was she wrong to keep Sherlock from William?  Whatever the consequences for her, even death, would not any possible reconciliations be worth the outcome?
Already punching in a number on his mobile, he asked over his shoulder, “You can monitor both replays at once?” He didn’t wait for an answer; she would simply have to make do on her own.
Back then, each morning I awoke at the same time, 3:31 a.m., to the same thought: “…show you every day how very much I appreciate and care for you”, my wedding vow to John.
I get a funny feeling in the bottom of my heart when he moves far, far away from me and tucks the covers under his chin, ready to sleep all by himself.
This time John sighs.  “I’m not being literal, Sherlock.  I know you don’t have a choice in what type a person you are.  It’s just a…well, an expression.  I’m just glad for who you are and that you choose to be with
John says he has found Heaven in my lips.  He says they are ‘rosy’ and ‘lush’, an ‘erotic treasure’ he could lose himself in for days and days and he does not care one bit if he is never found.
Regrouping, John said, “alright then, no worries.” He smiled at Sherlock, letting him know that it was fine, all fine, if he didn’t want to talk.   Turning his attention back to the others in the room, he called the meeting to an end.
Righting himself, his composure fully intact, he went back into the bedroom and sat down.  He steepled his fingers as if readying himself to think.
I wrap my arms tightly around her as she reaches for a hug.  I have always had a soft spot for Katie.  Whether it is because of her youthful exuberance or that she is a part of John, I do not know.  It does not matter, for when I am around the two of them I always feel as if a part of their small family, more so than with my own.
My breath catches as I see him round the corner to the sitting room, and I wonder if my heart stops beating, so still is my entire being, absorbing the
I turn my head to where he sits beside me in the car, our thighs resting against one other.  “I love you.”
“We will, won’t we, Rose?” Sherlock’s thumb slid up the length of her snout to an ear, scratching behind it. Pulling out the mobile linked to her programming app, he double-checked that Suki had accomplished her task of successfully transferring Rose’s control from Simon to him, by texting
I start to quake and I cannot stop.  I press into him.  I want rub against him, to ease the ache building in me.
“But why?  Why would Cedric do such a thing?  Eduard caused no one trouble.  Odd, he sometimes be, but twas his sense of humour, and Cedric would harm no one except to defend himself.  Tis it!  Cedric thought he be in danger.  Eduard was jesting, as he would, and Cedric did not understand.  I can think of no other reason.”  Aldus’s eyes pled for Sir John to tell him twas an awful joke Sherlock played, or that he be mistaken.
John rubbed his forehead. Hard. He’d written a letter. Where’d he put it? Scanning the room, he didn’t see the ivory linen envelope that read simply “Sherlock.”
“Forget about him, he’s an idiot.  Now, what about this million quid blowjob?”  I mimic his eyebrow wiggle from earlier in the day.
Everything packed, they set on their way.  Sir John and Sherlock taking the lead, they talked in voices so low Colin could not hear what they said. They seemed to enjoy an amiable company -- no raised voices, no sharp words.  Every so often they would lean in to each other to share a confidence in an even lower voice.  And more than once Colin heard them laugh.  Laugh!  Twas startling enough to hear merriment under such sober circumstances, but most of all twas startling to hear
“Look at it as an experiment,” Stamford appealed to Sherlock. “Think of it as an experiment gone wrong, and you stumble—”
Looking at the prisoner, who was still clothed, John was suddenly filled with a foreboding that this particular prisoner felt he had some ‘business’ to take care of with
“What have you done to me?” I demand of my betrothed. Betrothed.  I may have to revisit my decision to marry him.  He has hidden his vengeful nature well.
?  And besides, I will get cold; you know I require extra insulation.  Belstaff 365 days a year, remember.”
Despite the disparity of height between the horse and his own diminutive stature, Sir John’s sense of urgency necessitated he act with haste.  Refusing to wait for one of his squires to assist his dismount, he swung a leg over his horse and leapt down, his feet dropping to the ground with a thud.
“I’m absolutely fine, Inspector; I have it under control,” contradicting his words as he barely made it to the nearby chair, falling onto its hard surface.  He rested his elbows on legs that even through the pyjama bottoms looked far too thin and frail.
When his mouth meets my back, this time I am ready, open to wherever it takes me.  His hands still secure on my hips, his thumbs stroke me.  His lips and tongue move on me, circling, laving, pressing.  My nerve endings teem with pleasure; I feel each one trying to burst forth from me, their ecstasy too great to willingly be constrained by my flesh.
"I do, Sir. Simon's at an employee entrance on the west side of the building." Andi kept her voice low, so Rose wouldn't hear. She'd stuffed the poor dog's ears with tissue, but the information was too sensitive to take a chance that Simon would hear what was being said. "There’s something else you should know. Sherlock finally turned his mobile on, and its coordinates have been identified.”
John looked across the road to read Cedric’s reaction; Cedric had seen Gareth the night of Eduard’s death and would recognise him.  As John feared he would, Cedric shrugged and shook his head; the man hung his hooded head low, shielding his face from the rain, and them.
I do not shut up; it is of utmost importance I inform the officers how the unfortunate victim arrived at his current situation.  But they still do not listen as they open the door of their car and push my head down to keep me from hitting it as I half-sit, half-fall into the backseat.
Trying to pretend he wasn’t mesmerized by the graceful lines of Sherlock’s silhouette showing through the shower curtain, he averted his eyes as he pulled the curtain aside to hand the towel over.
In what had become a ritual, Sherlock eased himself quietly through the door, his footsteps calculated for the lightest touch as he passed John’s bed. The dimmed light giving him a half view of John’s face, a pang of melancholy hit him, a nostalgia for the life they’d had only days ago when John was healthy and happy. When he, himself, had come to tentatively trust the newfound equilibrium of his life. John had done that for him, and now John—
“Be careful with that thing. It’s not a toy,” Andi snapped, skidding on the metal threshold slick from a fresh rain. “And you could have warned me you were going to kidnap me, you know.”
The lift’s doors opened, and three MI-5 agents poured out. Sherlock glanced from them to Andi, who had just arrived at the fourth floor, breathing heavily. Peering back down the stairs, he heard two pairs of footsteps charging his way.
I hear the mild surprise in his voice.  He knows my brother and I have never been close, but over the years we have set aside some of our petty feuds, realising we are all we have left after our parents’ deaths.
Thankfully, Dr. Watson takes the box without causing me harm, and when he peeks inside the box on the way to the kitchen, I hear him mutter, “I didn’t think he liked chocolate.” From where I stand, he appears to chuck the box into the fridge. I flinch. No doubt the delicacy is now in ruins, but I return my attention to my client.
He pulls the second leg on and hitches the trousers up to his waist.  I do not like this.  I have not even started to get ready.  He is not planning on leaving without me, is he?
He closes the door and goes into the kitchen to make a cuppa; this is how he soothes himself when his heart has a hole. After Mary died I feared he would float away from the amount of tea he drank. Earl grey, peach, apple cinnamon, breakfast, mint; he even tried chai.  The list was endless; I never knew there so many kinds of tea. But he said if it was not tea it would be alcohol and dammit if he would follow Harry into the grave, especially with little Katie on his hands. Katie needed him. I silently added I needed him, too.
“What?”  My brain must still be under the influence of whatever treachery he employed; I have no idea what he is talking about.
Yelling at the maître d’ to call an ambulance, Mary’s companion dug through her bag for her mobile.  He didn’t know who John was, but he was sure to find him in her contacts.
John must have seen the excitement I tried to contain, for he urged me to go.  "You'll regret it all the days of your life if you don't," he said. I looked at Mr. Abernathy's hopeful face, John's encouraging one.  I certainly did not need to ask John’s permission and I did not need his blessing, but also I did not want to leave him by himself.  Katie was now gone and though he and I were not family, our lives were intricately weaved together in such a way that I had little doubt he would be at as much of a loss without me as I without him.
I look around.  What could he want?  Sometimes his eating habits are unusual, but I do not think he will put salt on his toast. Everything else he is able to reach.
of them? Kaur, who do you see? Agent Hawthorne, Agent Johnston, keep searching the area until you have the other one within sight.”
“I have to go.” Sherlock’s words were as tight as the rest of him as he dropped his mobile back into his pocket. “John, I...” Sherlock looked from John to the door. And back.
My brain becomes more muddled… too much noise and too many people pushing and pulling me.  John pulls me, trying to maneuver me through the crowd, telling me he is worried I will be hurt; one arm around my waist, his free hand tries to forge a path for us, but he loses his hold on me as the mob presses in to see the dead pirate.  Civic-minded meddlers push back at me, keeping me from leaving the scene of the crime.
“We need to go, Sir John.  He should not be allowed to get too far ahead of us.” Cedric stood close to John, speaking low, so his voice did not carry.
But what of the topic Sherlock had headed off? What about the profoundly unusual memory loss? That was what John should focus on, not the romantic meanderings of a man on the cusp of middle age.
John looks up from his own reading material and frowns.  “What’s wrong with you today?  Do you have a bee in your pants?  Or are you still worried I’m going to try to kill you?”  His frown evolves into a smirk.  How I fell in love with such a mean-spirited man, I have no idea.
“No. No, I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  John shook his head, keeping his face placid, not wanting to give any hint he knew who Lestrade was.  As soon as Lestrade had approached him, he’d known exactly who he was; he was with Sherlock the night of the overdose and that was a conversation John did not want to engage in right now. He already had enough trouble silencing the memory of Sherlock in his head; to hear it spoken out loud might completely undo him.
Apparently I do not rouse fast enough for my husband, for he shakes my shoulder, rocking me. “Come on, honey.  This is
"Surprised to see me, eh? I’m your Christmas Fairy, come to show you that you’re wrong about people being better off without you.”
As rushed and strung together as John’s words had been, Sherlock understood what he said, but he did not understand what he
Colin nearly gasped. With such a rebuke, twas a certainty Sherlock would turn his sharp tongue on the knight.  Though Colin had never been near a knight, had, in fact, never seen one, he knew twas folly to incur a knight’s anger.   But to his amazement, Sherlock tipped his head toward Sir John, searching Sir John’s face.  Twas almost a submissive gesture.
Seeing the gleam in his eyes, I know a new bucket list is not really what John intends, and I like his idea.  Very much.  I need him close to me.
Every entry I find, save a small handful, situates him next to Sherlock, whether in an image or in an article. How in the world did I not notice?! He’s practically inescapable. The only defense I have for being so unobservant is that as handsome as Dr. Watson is, Sherlock’s ethereal beauty draws attention away from everything around him.
"I do not ignore theories simply because they offend you," said Holmes, suddenly cold again. "If I were to operate on the assumption that everyone who appeared one way, was that way, I should not get far in the field of detection!"
"Well, in any case, she lost interest when her marriage was arranged, and I was relocated. Whereupon I met my fifth, whom I should have married immediately were she not already so."
Forgive me, dear reader, for I am aware now that in my state of self-pity I thought only of myself, and in doing so failed to recognise the true value of the woman before me. In my defense, even if I had stopped to observe then what I later came to admire in her, I might still have thought it reasonable to terminate what small flirtation we had shared, for I had always known that I would not make as good a husband as I would like. I am not un-scarred by battle in body and in heart, in my habits I am undeniably a bachelor, and my acquaintance with Holmes had changed me even then. I had a reckless taste for following adventure, and with it the just punishment of dealing with the man who led me to it.
"I hardly gave you the chance to tell me any other way," said Holmes piteously, and allowed me to raise him up to standing again. He was flushed and glassy, swaying faintly with emotion, but the hand that reached to grasp my arm was firm.
For the best part, I have kept this vow, and quite well according to some of the persons involved; several have complimented me on my accuracy, and especially upon the honest way in which I report upon the behaviour of my eccentric friend. I have also had the benefit, for some years, of having said friend cast his eye most coldly over my works, criticising all remarks he perceives as deviating from his fiercely accurate recollection.
"I am not a wealthy woman," she said eventually, "And I never shall be, even with a share of that fine chaplet. I am without family, and my inheritance was quite unremarkable. I am also a governess, that most awkward of positions — a social equal, and yet a servant. I am also obliged to be entirely independent, with none of the security a husband would provide."
And yet my feelings were more complex still — for a part of me also longed for the dream of a happy, ordinary household with a happy, ordinary woman, and I felt the loss of that dream that night. Oh, what a fool I was! Mary was many things, but she was in no way ordinary.
"Of course," he said. "Even our good friend Mr Athelney Jones should be able to deduce that one. You intend to be married." And he accompanied his pronouncement with a groan of disgust.
“Holmes,” I said despairingly, for I knew it could be true - or at least, I knew that I could love Mary. That I could cease to love Sherlock Holmes seemed inconceivable.
I confess that I did not sleep too well that night. The the echo of Mary's words, the enormity of my fall from grace in the eyes of decent society, and the danger of our position — all the thoughts in the world seemed set to come upon me, plaguing me like mosquitoes so that I slept little, and with unpleasant dreams. I was quite glad when the bright sun shone through my window, and I decided I might reasonably get up and call for breakfast. I wondered, however, what I might say to Holmes. The whole world had shifted in the night, shaken up beyond all hope of setting right again, and though our conversation had been as easy as ever in the moments before my departure to bed, I knew only too well how it is to be calm in the warm glow of just-spent pleasure. Whatever was I to say to the man?
"Not at all," said he, casting me a distasteful look. "I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I ought to place above all things." He smiled bitterly. "I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement."
"Come," she said, smiling at me with kind eyes, "There's a little park to the north. Let us take a turn about it."
I need not have worried, however, as there was no trace of Holmes, and from a crumpled telegram upon his desk I deduced that he was out upon a new scent already. I found that I was somewhat more put out than usual that he had not taken me with him, but I shook off the feeling and rang for breakfast. Once I had sated myself upon Mrs Hudson's excellent eggs, I called for a cab and set off for lower Camberwell.
“And perhaps Mary and I will be fast friends, and we will have all gained treasures from this affair.”
Quite lost, I allowed her to lead me to a charming patch of green a few streets from her residence. She was silent as we walked, and so was I, for my voice seemed to have deserted me; only when we found a bench and settled down upon it did the conversation begin.
In my published account, it is here I state that my heart was heavy, for the treasure held us back from each other. The reality, however, was nothing so simple. The weight was upon my heart not so much because I could not pursue her with such a treasure between us — though that did produce a certain sorrow within me — but because until that point Mary Morstan had been serving as a charming distraction from my unhappy state with Holmes. I feared that the end of my acquaintance with Miss Morstan — and therefore the case — would mean Holmes’s return to boredom and despair, and with it I would inevitably return to the role of helpless observer to it, an existence that grew lonelier and more painful by the day. For my regard for the man was blooming, rising from mere intellectual admiration into deep affection, which in turn fuelled the furnace of my helplessness.
"Certainly, I should like to hear it," I said, settling down into a chair, deeply concerned about the strange turn of our conversation. Miss Morstan looked thoughtful, staring across the room with a soft and faraway sadness in her eyes.
"Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson!" said she, and I was more than happy to tell her of Holmes's remarkable progress and the thrills of the night. She listened with shining eyes, and was admirably distressed at my tale of the near-missing poison dart.
"I should prefer just a scant sliver of human regard!" I protested, quite shocked at this outburst. "What on earth has gotten into you?"
Yet there is one account above all others which I have censored quite shamefully, willfully, and without an honourable motivation — nor with any particular grace. In my defence, it was not entirely unnecessary, and at the time I was both inexperienced in the field of biography and lacking the honour of Mr Holmes's blunt perspective. I refer, of course, to the case of Mr Jonathan Small and the Agra treasure, the case I entitled, 'The Sign of the Four'.
“Because, you big sod, if you don’t go to sleep I won’t feel right about leaving.  And if I don’t leave I won’t make curfew and they’ll kick me out.”  Soberly adding, “I can’t afford to lose a place to live right now.”
As much as he did not want to have that conversation, Sherlock relaxed his hold and with a last soft last kiss on the mouth, he released John.  The loss was a keen one.  Nothing more did he want than to keep holding John in his arms.
Hearing the alarm, John awoke with a start, his heaviness making him feel as if he must have slept the sleep of the dead.  Lifting up his hand to rub his eye, he found that there was one… minor problem.
Grabbing his mobile, John dialed 999.  “Two men just jumped into the river and I think one might be unconscious,” he said somewhat breathlessly to the dispatcher, proceeding to describe what little he had seen.
When John lived at Baker Street, Sherlock rarely saw him sleep.  John occasionally fell asleep in his chair or at the desk, but never had Sherlock seen him so comfortably ensconced.  Looking at his friend, the detective felt he missed something important by never seeing him rest like this.  Awake, John almost always looked as if he were in motion; there was something tightly wound about him.
presume to tell me what I think,” I assert, ready to defy his logic of why I could not be in love with him.  “You are a fine looking man.  You cannot help your diminutive stature and I like your grey hair; it makes you look dignified, intelligent far beyond your capacity.  As for calling me names, I do not even notice. I do not hear half of what you say; it is all white noise to me. And I would not recognise you if you had a more pleasing disposition.  You are exactly as you should be, John.”
Sherlock started playing a piece he had composed himself – the one that John had loved so much when he played it to him for the first time. John curtly shifted behind him, an unmistakable sign that he recognised this piece. Unconsciously, John pressed closer to Sherlock to feel the music better. Sherlock's heartbeat quickened.
It was on a day late in August when it happened. Both men were spending a quiet evening at 221B Baker Street. John was reading a book while Sherlock was absorbed in the paper. As always, there was quietness.
The most significant difference, though, is their fish tail. The sea folk possess no legs—their lower bodies one long tail with two fins at the end with which they can swim and even walk short distances on the sandy bottom of the sea. Therefore, they are often mistaken for fish when they happen to be too close to the surface and find themselves spotted.
In the long run, it wouldn't work with the texts and the notes. Sherlock didn't always have the nerves and the time to type everything into his mobile or jot it down so John could follow, especially not on crime scenes.
The next morning, Sherlock woke in an empty bed. He could hear the sound of rushing water from next door – the bathroom. John was most likely going to return to bed. Indeed the door opened shortly after and he emerged, grinning when he saw Sherlock blinking at him.
The sea folk look just like human beings but if one possesses the good fortune to peer closer, which happens rarely because they live very secluded lives, one can spot the differences—so tiny yet so important. Their eyes shine brighter than those of man and they consist of many a colour. There is no plain blue or green. No indeed! Every eye is something special, a mixture of thousands and thousands of colours.
And then Sherlock's mouth was on his again, always soft but a bit more passionate this time. Sherlock almost kissed him with his whole body. Sherlock's hand that used to clutch John's hand, eased its grip and wrapped around the doctor's hips while the other wandered down to his chest and gently pushed him backwards.
They made an unusual pair, one with a tail and one with legs, but Sherlock was happy, just so, so happy, and John was the reason for that. Sherlock could pick up his violin again, now that John was able to mend and he played again—even if there was a ball room of people to entertain, he still only played for John.
"Run away with me," Sherlock pleaded and John held on even tighter and after what seemed to be an eternity, he nodded. He pulled away and looked up at Sherlock, before kneeling down and grasping his hands.
what he was interested in. So he was happy about the action that now returned to their lived and that he could paint the town red again with Sherlock.
And then, one day, Sherlock had an idea. By coincidence, he gestured to John that he wanted to drink tea, using the international movement for drinking. His hand formed a loose fist so that he could look through it if he wanted to, held up to his mouth and tilted in a way that made it look like he was drinking from a mug.
John signed when they were done: right hand spread out flat above his heart. Sherlock answered by placing his right hand over John's.
This realisation hit him with an unexpected force. John who usually was so strong and brave was now looking like a picture of misery – because of completely understandable reasons. Something in Sherlock told him that he wanted to soothe his friend in some way yet he didn't know how. Would John accept a touch now anyway or would he dismiss it as unwanted pity?
He slowly and thoughtfully climbed the stairs to John's room. As soon as he entered through the door, he'd walk across a thin rope. It would either break and destroy his friendship with John, or it would bring him into a world he had never experienced before. A world full of love and affection, full of happiness and hope.
He was the most beautiful of the mermen that lived in the palace. His skin was softer than the skin of others, and his eyes were of such an indistinct colour that it seemed as if they changed their appearance according to the light. Like all others he had no feet but his fish tail was shining brighter, his scales were more colourful than one had ever seen. His high cheekbones emphasised his pale skin and piercing eyes, his head was framed with black, soft curls that flowed up and down with the water's movement. His name was just like him – exotic and intriguing. He was called Sherlock.
Now that John was fit again, Sherlock of course acted like a little child on Christmas day and whooshed through the streets of London, looking forward to hunting down culprits and examining corpses. Oh, what a life.
"Wake," he pleaded, "wake and live," and he bent down to kiss the man's forehead tenderly. He looked at the human's hair, sandy of colour yet so different from every grain on the beach. Sherlock lay down and picked up a bit of sand, holding it close to the man's head, marveling at the different colours and the softness of his hair. It was too dark, however, to see properly and Sherlock decided to conduct this experiment later, in daylight.
They wrote each other little notes in the beginning. They couldn't communicate in any other way apart from tiny gestures and expressions. So they restricted themselves to written correspondence, either with little slips of paper or their mobiles – the latter being preferred by Sherlock.
John, who knew about his feelings towards Sherlock and still hated himself for being useless and deaf.
John doesn't know when this started, really. Maybe at the age of four, five? He would sometimes ask his mother questions like, “What if you and Daddy had never met? I wouldn't be born then, would I? Somebody else would have my place.” And it made him incredibly sad to know that he maybe didn't exist in a different universe. His mother usually laughed, and so did his father, and Harry, of course.
He didn't know how long this took and he couldn't be bothered to care. It was wonderful, it was perfect, and he could spend the rest of his life cuddling with Sherlock.
"He is up there," Sherlock thought, "he whom I love more than my parents and myself, he who occupies every corner of my head, and in whose hands I would willingly put my life."
The doctor just smiled and gently withdrew his hand from Sherlock's grip, cupping Sherlock's cheek and softly tracing his cheekbone with his thumb. He wanted to make him feel safe and secure without restricting or overwhelming him.
And Sherlock whispered "I do" while a tear rolled down his cheek, and his heart felt better and the pain in his legs lessened. John got up and cupped Sherlock's face gently, pressing his lips to Sherlock's mouth and together they stood and held each other—kissing until dawn.
They don't talk about this topic again that evening. But it hasn't been forgotten. John continues to think about what-ifs, and Sherlock does wonder, too, sometimes. He knows for a fact that his life with John has been wonderful, that he actually was happier than ever before.
John smiled against Sherlock's lips and let his tongue dart forward, smoothing over Sherlock's bottom lip and applying pressure to Sherlock's mouth that immediately opened. Softly, John let his tongue slide in, looking for Sherlock's and gently nudging it.
John knew Sherlock needed this quiet moment to collect himself and he was willing to give. He nudged Sherlock's nose gently with his own and let his hand fall from Sherlock's cheek to his neck, carding his fingers through the soft little curls at his nape. He touched his brow to Sherlock's again to have a third point of contact and to acquaint Sherlock slowly, softly and slowly, with touches. Sherlock's breath grew heavier and he closed his eyes for a short moment, before opening them again and looking at John. He looked so young, so vulnerable. He was starting to open up to John, completely committing himself to him, and this made John's heart beat faster. He smiled one last time before closing the little gap between them, slowly, slowly, and brushed his lips across Sherlock's.
Donovan and Anderson laughed about that 'arm-waving' at first until John, beaming widely, gave them the finger. This made them shut up.
The moment John woke up and looked at Sherlock for the first time was probably one of the worst moments in the life of the Consulting Detective. The happiness about his blogger being more or less well again was dimmed by his frightened, almost panic-stricken look – an expression Sherlock didn't know from John. John still couldn't hear anything. And he knew it. As both doctor and former soldier, John mainly relied on his hearing. It was like eyesight for Sherlock. Hearing was a valuable bodily function that one usually took for granted, but as soon as one couldn't use it anymore, one's world was turned upsidedown.
The young merman submerged immediately, swimming to the place where he had seen the vessel before and there the human was, sinking lower and lower—red liquid leaking from a hole in his left shoulder.
The memory of John made him strong and brave, and he swam on, until he reached the witch's house. White bones of men lay next to it for Irene was known for doing unspeakable things to her clients.
Sherlock annoyed the nurses and doctors with this topic as often as possible. He demanded they bring John's hearing back, no matter how. They promised him over and over again that they would give their best but most of the time it was just an excuse, a little fib so they could continue their work without being interrupted by him. At some point they stopped talking to Sherlock entirely so he had no other option than to sit next to John's bed and hope.
Sherlock released him, withdrew his tongue, and kissed John's closed lips. John opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock who was blushing, lips reddened and moist and kiss-swollen.
John kissed Sherlock's brow, his eyelids, his nose, his cheeks, his mouth. He kissed him right below the ear, eliciting a soft moan. He kissed his jaw, let his lips trail along Sherlock's neck, nipped at his earlobe, turned to his collar bones.
John sighs and closes his eyes for a fraction of a second. “I could have been dead because the bullet could have hit my head instead of my shoulder. You could be dead if some of your dangerous cases had gone wrong. In fact, we both probably could never have met.”
He looks up at his flatmate who is smiling warmly, his eyes sparkling gently as he looks at his best friend. Sherlock smiles back, and after a bit of thought he adds,
Gently, Sherlock took his friend's left hand and guided his fingertips to the neck of the violin, shortly above the corpus. He put slight pressure on them to show John that he should keep them there. A slight nod against his back made it clear that John had understood. John's right hand was still resting on Sherlock's belly, clutching the bow. Sherlock took it and raised it, grabbing the bow himself and putting it on the strings. He then turned his head to one side so John could see his mouth: "Try to feel the music." From the corner of his eyes he saw how the doctor blinked in confusion but then nodded.
John raised his arm, pointed to Sherlock's lips and tried to speak. The words sounded oddly slurred, almost uncertain, and his voice was unnaturally loud. "Did you say something?"
That night, Sherlock couldn't sleep and he silently tip-toed to John's room where he gently knocked on the door. John stood beneath its frame, his hair mussed from sleep, and Sherlock remembered the time where he had compared John's every follicle to the grains of the beach. It made him unbearably sad, and it must have shown on his face for John took him into his arms and held him tightly, rocking them from side to side.
John was lying on the ground, almost unconscious, his face contorted in pain. Sherlock hovered above him, pressing his mobile to his ear and calling an ambulance while trying to keep John from losing consciousness at the same time. After he had ended the call, he crammed his mobile into the pocket of his Belstaff coat with an angry growl and turned back to John whose eyelids still threatened to fall shut.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “I don’t, that is true. However, everything is different when you are concerned.”
“Do you sometimes think about what would have happened if we hadn't met?” John asks one evening as Sherlock and he are sitting side by side on their sofa, both enjoying a book and occasionally sipping tea.
"Sherlock!" John tried to speak and he succeeded, yet his voice sounded raw and husky and the detective's name passed his lips with a lot of effort, extremely loud and quite slurred.
“Oh Jesus.” John sank down against the sofa’s backrest and ran a hand over his face. “I thought… I thought you didn’t care much for this sort of stuff. Sentiment and all that.”
John kissed him again and noticed Sherlock swallowing heavily. The detective took his violin and bow into one hand and turned around without escaping John's embrace. He wrapped his arms around the doctor's shoulders and together they held each other, both overwhelmed by the rush of emotions running through them.
He missed hearing the noises of his beloved London, the cars, the people, the birds. But most of all he missed the talks with Sherlock's, his deep baritone that usually pierced John's marrow and bone – and his violin playing.
Sherlock's eyes went wide. "Can you hear me?" he asked, exaggerating the movement of his mouth and talking especially slowly. He had read that it was easier to lip-read when the volume of speech wasn't increased or decreased, but instead stayed normal.
But Sherlock had to refuse, and it broke his heart even more to see John's disappointed look. They parted soon after in silence, each man departing on his own, and John heard Sherlock cry when he walked away.
John blinked. “Well done, Sherlock, you actually looked at the calendar I gave you. I'm proud.” With that he shook his head in confusion and picked up his laptop to continue working, but was interrupted by a cold hand that had an iron grip on his wrist.
A pleasing pressure pooled in Sherlock's groin so that he wasn't able to kiss John back anymore. John increased the pace between their bodies, swiping their thumbs over their tips and peppering Sherlock's temple with kisses until Sherlock was reduced to a trembling mess in his arms, barely able to form a coherent thought.
“Why not?” John looks sad. “Don't you think it would be disappointing that in another universe we have not met?”
Sherlock looked up and fixed John with his gaze for a while. Then he put down the paper and held up his hands to answer in their sign language.
Together they decided not to learn the already existing sign language. Instead they developed their own signs, spending a whole day noting down the most important words and transforming them into gestures. They used simple signs that were easy to recognise so that they wouldn't have to learn much and could start using their language immediately.
Sherlock swam closer to the shore. He was alone again so he eventually left the water, with only his fins in the waves, and his upper body on the soft sand. It was a nice feeling, and it was both new and exciting to feel the texture of the beach on his skin. Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed the air into his lungs that were made for living underwater, yet they worked just fine when he was outside. After a while he blinked once, twice and then sat up. The sun was now just a mere line on the horizon and Sherlock picked up his violin he had taken with him. He began to play a soft tune until the ball of fire had disappeared completely and welcomed the night with a melody so melancholic and sweet that no creature would have been able to think ill of it.
In some places, it sinks deeper than any anchor can go—deeper than even the heaviest of steel attached to the largest, most majestic of vessels can fathom reaching. Mankind has not been able to determine the true depths of the sea but one thing is for sure – it would take ages to reach the bottom, and it is there where the sea folk dwell.
Something in Sherlock's chest clenched at the sight of the human before him, and he whispered, "You mustn't give up, John." He tentatively touched the human's good shoulder, thinking frantically what he could do to ease his pain and then remembered. He took his violin again and played for John, a soothing melody that was said to have healing powers. It was a rumour under the sea folk, but maybe it was true. While Sherlock usually didn't believe in something like that, he wished it were true. Even if it was illogical.
Sherlock's face lit up in a beaming smile but Mycroft's expression stayed as dark as the night. "This can never come to pass, Sherlock. The beauty of yours here in the sea is your fish tail, but you can't walk with it on land and you would be avoided for having it."
The more he heard, the more his patience decreased and the young prince couldn't wait to see gold glowing heavens, green hills and trees, animals, people, and breathe the air over the sea.
Their lips parted for a short time when they both had to break apart for air, but immediately met again, and it still felt like their first kiss without having ever been interrupted.
John put the mobile away and took Sherlock's other hand, leaning forward and touching his brow to Sherlock's. He closed his eyes while the detective observed him. This quiescent, this togetherness, this intimacy.
But yet, Sherlock still hadn’t told John the three magic words, and John hadn’t either. He knew he loved Sherlock, oh, and
The music transported them to heights they could never have reached on their own. To stand so close and trusting with each other was something they had never imagined. Sherlock who ignored feelings, and John who knew how Sherlock thought about this – but here they were, body to body, heart to heart. It just felt so
Sherlock stayed in this position for another while, then sighed happily, and retreated back under the surface, swimming back to his palace. He had seen the human world – and he already knew he couldn't get enough of it.
The man opened his mouth and closed it again, just like a fish. Then he said something in a rasped voice, coughed, and repeated it.
Sherlock cursed himself for not anticipating this bomb. The culprit they had chased had not only been a murderer but also a bomber who of course had worn an explosive belt. He detonated himself when John and Sherlock had forced him into a blind lane. Sherlock had been able to hide behind a rubbish skip just in time and wanted to pull John behind him but he failed. The doctor threw himself on the ground and tried to escape the pressure wave this way but that hadn't helped much. The bomb of the culprit exploded, just like the little stone wall behind him. Splinters of bricks were flying through the air, and three hit John's head and back—hurting him badly.
from upstairs, the noise announcing a text on John's mobile. He heard John turning in his bed. Obviously he now read the message – and then the phone was put back onto the night stand.
Their lips touched with certainty but barely moved, mouths closed. The only contact points were their lips, their knees, their hands, John's hand on Sherlock's neck that gently threaded through the curls, and Sherlock's hand in John's jumper. The former noticed the pressure of John's fingers sometimes increasing, sometimes lessening, always soft and gentle.
Sherlock returned to Mycroft's palace and isolated himself even more from the others. Many evenings and many mornings he revisited the spot where he had seen John for the last time. He saw fruits growing close to the shore, he saw snow melting away, but he didn't see John anymore and became sadder every time he returned home.
One evening on the fifteenth day, John and Sherlock were sat on the shore side by side, looking at the water in front of them.
“John.” Sherlock’s deep voice echoed through the flat. He stood in front of John, more or less looming over him. He was clad only in his blue bathrobe, a nicotine patch peeked out of his sleeve, and his curls were unruly as ever. Given that it was ten AM, he probably only just got up.
"Stay." Sherlock whispered so quietly that even someone with perfect hearing would have had difficulty understanding. But John, wonderful loyal John, understood anyway. A little smile tugged at his lips and he reflexively shifted closer to Sherlock who was becoming increasingly nervous.
He assumed he had hurt John with his last text. In retrospect, it really had been a bit not good. Sherlock had wanted to write something else entirely.
"When you are grown up," Mycroft said, "you will be allowed to rise up out of the ocean and learn about the human world, just like me."
Both men were naked, pressed close together and John didn't let the kiss come to an end. Sherlock's free hand had found his back, wandered over it, sometimes clutching at it. Then John broke the kiss, smiled reassuringly at Sherlock, letting his hands wander deeper, his mouth following them. John's lips never stopped moving – soft kisses that made Sherlock moan in pleasure and gentle caresses of his tongue that made him gasp and arch.
He explored Sherlock's legs inch for inch and when he reached his hips, he straightened again and gently kissed him. Sherlock looked at him and swallowed once, twice, before he formed "Don't stop" with his mouth. John smiled again and pulled his jumper over his head. Sherlock's hands roamed over his chest in the meantime, cheekily unbuttoned the shirt he was still wearing.
John was grinning at him. It was a little weak but genuine. Actually Sherlock was expecting a flash of anger but as always John surprised him by not being angry and simply smiling at him in an amused way.
"Sherlock," he said and his voice broke, "this is not legal but I have no other choice. I love you, more than I could ever love somebody else and I owe you my life. Will you marry me?"
That this was a significant step in their friendship – maybe even an opened door to something new, beautiful – they both knew. And both didn't quite know how to react to that.
John looked up, nodded, and smiled, then continued to look at Sherlock. He could see how Greg sighed and returned to his co-workers. They used to chat with each other from time to time but now not even a dirty joke was possible.
Sherlock had no option but to agree, and the witch cast a spell on him so that his fingers became numb and stiff and he couldn't even pick up a simple shell anymore. Irene brewed the potion and handed it to him, and Sherlock quickly made his way back home where he was asked to play again but denied. He already missed his violin that he found destroyed in his room. Apparently Irene had cast a spell on it as well.
He gave John the book and tented his fingers beneath his chin. He really was horribly sorry for putting John into this situation. If only he had thought a bit more they wouldn't be here now and John wouldn't be deaf.
The light in John's room was dimmed and the doctor knelt on the bed. With one hand he reached out for Sherlock, a silent Thank-You for the texts. He clutched his mobile with his other hand.
.” And with that, he gently touched his lips to Sherlock’s, eyes fluttering close, lips gently pulling and caressing. “I love you,” he whispered as Sherlock’s hands slid down to his neck. “I love you,” he uttered as he dropped to the floor to be closer to Sherlock. “I love you, Sherlock,” he murmured when Sherlock pulled him close and held him in a tight embrace.
“No,” Sherlock says, shaking his head thoughtfully, “we would always find each other, John. No matter where or when. Because we belong together. Because a Sherlock Holmes and a Doctor John Watson
John, however, didn't react to Sherlock's words. He blinked curtly and then frowned as if something had confused him.
The detective felt so much in this moment – happiness, joy, passion, pleasure, arousal and love. Especially love.
Once Sherlock had turned eighteen, his quiet life filled with experiments and reading books was over. It was custom of Baker Kingdom that every prince chose a profession at eighteen and travel the kingdom to get to know more about both it and its inhabitants.
It wasn't until Sherlock had reappeared at the surface twice after the incident that he saw the human being again. Sherlock brought his violin again and was just about to swim to the shore when something else caught his eye. It was a little boat, not far from where Sherlock had emerged from the water, and in it were two men. One of them was the human that had complimented the merman on his violin playing some time ago, the other one was taller and rounder and barking with laughter.
Of course he didn't really have anything to do in the household; he simply wanted what was best for Sherlock and if that meant to make up excuses for not going to crime scenes he would happily do that. He didn't want to slow Sherlock's thoughts down. His smile was partly genuine, anyway, because Sherlock would be able to continue with his beloved work without John being a burden. However, he carried his smile around with him all the time anyway.
comfortably for the rest of his life without the sacrifice of a day-to-day job.  All he was required to do was disable the electronic security system - doors, gates, and cameras - for a specific 15 minute timeframe.  That’s all.  Just 15 minutes of work in exchange for a lifetime of financial security.
I playfully slap Sherlock’s hand away as I hook up the television in the bedroom.  He’s a whiz with electronics once they’re up and running, but he’s shite with wires and connections.
“You’re lying, Sherlock.  I told you, I’m not as easily fooled as John.  Now tell me,” she demanded, her voice low to keep from disturbing her daughter.  “Where is my husband?”
I am relieved; it is not Katie.  He would never answer a call from her in such a way, but whatever it is the person says, it is not a relief to John.
Don’t panic, John, everything will be okay.  Sherlock wants to get married, he said so; hell, he proposed to you.  And he’s seemed excited, but…it wouldn’t be the first time he’s lied to you.  I take a deep breath and text Sherlock.
His eyes were drawn to the horrific sight of the bright red blood, its stain spreading against the crisp white shirt as images flashed through his mind of the many times he had seen a bullet wound.  This time was different; this time the bullet had pierced Sherlock’s body.
it?’ he muttered under his breath, knowing he wouldn’t be able to rest until he revealed and removed the threat of the nameless sniper. He feared that with any piece of Moriarty’s web still present John’s life would be in danger.  A situation always intolerable to him, but now unthinkable.
When I come out of the bedroom fully clothed, John is in the kitchen waiting for the kettle to boil.  Leaning against the counter, his gaze fixed away from me, he stares out the window.  Seemingly deep in thought, he does not turn as I stop at the edge of the room.
John pulls the covers up over us and slides over to hold me.  Just hold me, his heat warming me.  It is exactly as it is every night when we come to bed, except now we face each other and there is a penis nudging my belly and my penis lies against him.
John rolled into his pillow and clutched it to him, imagining he smelled Sherlock’s scent, and it made him ache for Sherlock that much more.  It reminded him of his dream that Sherlock had been with him.  That Sherlock had lain beside him and told him over and over that he loved him.  Twas not unusual; most nights he dreamed of Sherlock, but this one be clearer than most.  Twas as real as if it had happened.
“Have you seen my glasses, honey?”  John asks as he wanders around the suite, looking at the table by his side of the bed, in the bathroom (There is a telephone in the loo!  Who needs a telephone in the loo?!), even in the small refrigerator stocked with exorbitantly priced snacks and alcohol.
He closed his eyes and listened to the sound of Sherlock moving about the room, the sounds of the busy city coming to life. Life. His life at 221B.
Keeping his eyes on Sherlock, John slowly removed his jacket, laying it on the arm of the chair as he sat back down.  He placed the gun back on the table.
In researching for this interview, I found little information about your personal life, from either before or after you started publishing; you seem to be very private.  Yet the way the characters’ lives mirror your own tells me perhaps you are loosening that stance. Is there an agenda to this book?  Is it your subtle way of becoming politically active?”
Peanut.  If I didn’t think Sherlock were so adorably smitten with our grandson, I would worry about his sanity.  Even at his most comfortable with me, he doesn’t get quite so goofy.   I sigh.  Just one more thing to love about Sherlock, and here I’d thought I’d found every reason.
Listening for sounds from other parts of the house, I still don’t hear him; maybe he’s in the garden doing some last minute preparations.  He said he isn’t nervous about today, but I think he’s just trying not to show it.  Like me writing this blog, narrative, whatever the heck it is, for him today.  He said he’s letting me do it as a wedding gift since I ‘have a heightened sense of romance’, and what better to romanticise than a wedding.  Personally I think it’s because he’s more emotional about getting married than he wants to admit.  He still struggles a bit with the whole ‘sentiment’ issue, thinks it makes him sound ‘soft’, or some such nonsense.
John never found out who took the picture of Sherlock, but he kept it on the lockscreen of his mobile as a reminder of the most momentous kiss he had ever known.  Of his first kiss with the person that would, incredulously, become the love of his life.
“Sir John gives his apologies.  His voice has left him; too much celebration last night, if you know what I mean,” John added with a forced laugh.  “Sir John understands the implications and is fully prepared to relinquish his position.”
But while he was thinking this complex situation through, John had taken the matter literally into his own hand, threading their fingers together and resting their joined hands on his own lap.
astonished. It’s inexplicable to me that a man such as John Watson should love me, of all people.” And watching out the window, he thought again about what an extraordinary thing it was that John loved him, musing, “No, I haven’t grown accustomed to it. And I will never forgive myself if I do.”
Sherlock focused on Mycroft’s face.  Not because he was inclined to look at his brother so closely, but because he had to focus on
will accuse Sherlock of killing Eduard. Tis a ridiculous notion.  And you, Cedric, I told you not to spread such a malicious lie.  Sherlock did not have the time.  And why would he have?  Hmmm?” John held out his hand to silence Cedric before he said anything.  Cedric’s mouth, poised to speak, slammed shut.  “Twas a mocking question it was. We put this to bed last night, and to bed it will stay.”
Flummoxed by Sherlock's audacity, Sir John nonetheless said, "Yes. Yes, of course. Very well, then, we will go find this woman of whom you speak."
“I think he’s pretty private with his emotions, but when we were cleaning up Nan’s house, when you couldn’t see him he looked at you as if there were nothing more wonderful in the world, like he couldn’t believe that
“Still, with that knowledge, it did not answer the question I posed to myself after you presented your…ultimatum.  I knew what I wanted my decision to be, I want to be with you, in that there is no question.  But I did not know why I, as you say, run hot and cold.  What am I scared of?   Despite my behaviour, I do not believe you would ever cheat on me; you are too honourable a man to do so.  And I am not scared to love you.”
Gathering a wool wrap to shield herself from the cool evening and her purse, by the time Nika opened the front door, a sleek, black Jaguar idled in front of her house, double-parked on the narrow street. When she approached the car, the driver held the door for her, handing her a slim portfolio that would contain vital information–a detailed account of the injuries, the patient’s known medical history, X-rays and other imaging reports. She would study them on the ride.
Damn it. I ruined our fun; the gaiety comes to a screeching halt. Sherlock withdraws his hands from mine and, picking up a fork and knife, plays at cutting up the food on his plate that has long grown cold.
When he was sure he had Sherlock’s full attention, John blew out a breath and rolled onto his back.  Throwing an arm over his head he stared at the ceiling.  Though Sherlock hadn’t expressed as much in words, he knew from Sherlock’s strong reaction to finding out he was alive that it had been quite painful for him when he had ‘died’; he deserved an explanation.  John felt Sherlock’s arm rest lightly on him under the covers, giving him the courage to speak.
I cup his face in my hands, tilting it up so I can better see him, the bags under his eyes more pronounced than usual, the eyelids that look too heavy to stay fully open.  Even in the poor lighting, I can see his unhealthy pallor.  I do not think he has slept or eaten any better than have I during our separation.  Oh, John, my love.
Sherlock turned the recording back on. “Do whatever Simon tells you to do, okay? He says we’ll both be fine if you do. And Sherlock?” Here, John inhaled as if considering what to say next. “Run—”
"See, I told you." Triumphant, Aldus turned back to Cedric from where he watched the Knight oversee Sherlock's transformation. "Why would he go to such trouble did he not desire him? Why should he care whether a servant lives or dies? It is lust I tell you. Take a look at his crotch when he returns, I bet you a farthing he will not be sitting quite so comfortably in his saddle."
sorry.”  Averting his eyes, he dashed to the table and picked up his pincers.  “I forgot these.  I will not be back again before the sun goes down.  I promise,” he said, escaping the room.
If I may say, it worked out well, the two of them living in the flat below. I could stay up all night without worrying about disturbing anyone, and John and I were able to remain friends since he was not constantly threatening to kill me.
It touches mine lightly, resting there for just a moment.  I think it is to ask permission.  I do not push him away.  I do not have the strength, even if I want to. I do not want to.  His lips are warm and soft, fuller than they look.  His hand is back on my face and his thumb brushes back and forth along my cheek, slowly.  The effect is hypnotic.  My eyes close and I am unaware of anything outside myself but the sensation of him touching me, the scent and taste of him.
want to keep on, at least for a while longer?”  I will defer to his wishes.  If he answers ‘yes’, I will do my best to be more cooperative.  But if he answers ‘no’, the barricade between us will disappear faster than a humming bird flaps its wings.  I hold my breath, uncertain what I want the answer to be.
We get home, and after hanging my jacket, I go into the kitchen to make tea.  Sinking into my chair, Sherlock is already sat across from me in his. Legs crossed and elbows on the chair arms, his hands steeple at his chin, something he so rarely does anymore.  His eyes pierce into me.
As is my daily ritual, I wake up hours before John, nestling my face into his neck.  He knows I do this.  I tell him I use the time to think; I do not tell him it is time to think about him.  He has always admired me for my extraordinary intellectual prowess (who would not) and were he to discover my sentiment is getting the better of me, I fear I would lose his esteem.
“Sherlock,” I say, rising as he practically runs my way, though his speed is not about haste to get to me. Yes, his long legs move him quickly, but he rushes past Dr. Watson, averting his eyes as though trying to avoid Dr. Watson’s scrutiny.
“My armour?  Why?”  The change of subject caught John off guard, and his head snapped toward Sherlock.
name?  The people she had worked for?  Some kind of code for god knows what?), wondering if he should, if he
“Why is it bothering you so much, love?  I mean, we withhold information all the time when we want to surprise each other with something and it hasn’t bothered you before.”  I slide my hand to the concave where his hip meets his abdomen, rubbing my thumb there so the intimate contact will help him feel safe.
John ran a soapy cloth along his arms, down his neck and chest.  Under the water to wash his legs and his feet.  Gentle and rhythmic, the ministrations relaxed him even more, and he released a deep sigh.
John said it half-heartedly; it had been a busy day and nothing sounded better than climbing into their bed.  Well, nothing except climbing into their bed with Sherlock in it.
“So you remember being madly in love with him and he didn’t take any notice of you, well, not in that way, anyway…”
the case, and it was as though Sherlock’s thought processes were interrupted by a signal too strong to shut out.
“Watch out…!”  A shout escapes me as he passes a lorry, the oncoming car in the other lane far too close for my taste.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Sherlock snorted. Discreet. At the word “private” Aldus cocked his ear toward them, vying for a juicy morsel of information. Cedric adopted the air of one who pretended a wall shielded the conversation, as if somehow Sherlock were invisible and silent. Eduard was the only one of the three who seemed unconcerned with what was to be said. Perchance he was to be trusted, but in Sherlock’s experience, no one was.
Sherlock had had his ears perked to the brief conversation, debating whether to insert himself, but at John’s question, he was up and across the room in a flash, slowing only when he would be in John’s line of sight. It wouldn’t do to appear too eager.
Only the morning before his life had been uncomplicated, his biggest concern traveling to London to compete in the jousting tournament. But now? A servant named Sherlock had turned his world on its head. John’s entire being craved him, not just his body, but his heart, too. About to belt his tunic with the rope, he heard his name.
“Uh, sorry, love.”  He lets go of a heavy breath; he is as disappointed as I.  He turns and walks away, leaving me to stand watching after him.  I am certain that if he has not already driven me mad, he will.  Soon.
His face flushing, not with embarrassment but with want, his groin uncomfortable with need, John’s gaze slid to where Aldus lay.  Even were Aldus sleeping, as he appeared to do, twas no time.  Taking a deep breath, and another, John forced himself to think about that which he
"I'll say there is, dear Watson. I do believe Miss Morstan was trying to communicate to you that her first love was not merely disinterested in her, but in the fairer sex in general."
"It would be of the greatest interest to me," she said, but she seemed quite cool and practical about it; I believe she foresaw the kind of troubles such a fortune might bring her, or perhaps the figure of two hundred thousand pounds was more money than either one of us could fully comprehend. "It is certainly a pretty box. Indian work, I suppose?"
"Indeed," said I, looking out upon the trees of the green. It was shaping up to be a fine day; already the sunshine was bright and gleaming.
And with that cryptic pronouncement, he sat straight up, gleaming with all the brilliance of his wit.
But then some part of me, some greater feeling, began to bubble within my chest. A feeling which told me I could gain just as much.
“Hush,” said Holmes, lips grazing mine, “If anyone has heart enough for two people, it is John Watson.”
I was quite honest about the facts of the case, and more frank regarding Holmes than I had been in my first little pamphlet. The names, appearance and manner of a few of the key players have been changed or exaggerated, but aside from that, I was quite straightforward. No, my principle manipulations were based quite entirely around myself, and my interactions with Miss Mary Morstan.
I did so willingly, as I felt quite uneasy discussing Holmes's dalliances with other men — it seemed tawdry to me, deviant, somehow far more perverse than the acts of ten minutes previous, though of course the notion was quite absurd.
"It is as clear as day to me," said Holmes, "That men are never one thing or the other. A gentleman might be a murderer, an abusive husband might be kind to his animals, a pickpocket might be the bravest boy in London. We are all full of dualities and contradictions — even I, though I seek to live my life by logic. As Goethe says:
I recall the sight of her clearly, seated by the open window, with that little touch of scarlet at her neck, every bit as sweet and grave and beautiful as my published descriptions — however modestly she protested them. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet. My account of her first words, I believe, was quite accurate.
"As well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb," said Holmes, and smiled a quicksilver smile. Holmes's pleasure, when directed at me, had always made my heart soar, but tonight it seemed to flutter as girlishly as any maiden upon the compliments of her suitor.
And perhaps, one day, I will write an account of all the other grand deceptions in my chronicles of Mr Sherlock Holmes. But for now, all that remains is to cast this one, this document of all my most significant lies, deep into the fire, in the hope that I might get some peace from it.
"Yes, this is the great Agra treasure," I agreed. "It is quite a considerable sum. You will be one of the wealthiest ladies in London."
"Don't fear me, Watson," he said, eyes bright and shining and his hands tight about my wrists. "Don't think anything at all. I cannot bear it if you will not be my friend — I cannot bear the thought of you shrinking from me, imagining my every affection to be degenerate. It is not so, Watson, it is not at all so."
I re-lit my pipe once again, and sucked upon it in silence while my thoughts tumbled like rocks over a cliff. At some point that night, I thought, they would sort themselves out, the insignificant cast away from the momentous — but for the moment I could do nothing but think them all, think of perversion and love and law and feeling and logic and a thousand things that would be, and that might be, and that could never be again. We sat like that for half an hour or so, Holmes with his arm slung over his eyes, so very still that at last I thought him to be asleep.
"The first," I said, for I had no objection to indulging him either way, "Or rather, the second — was a girl whom I was courting as a young man in university. With no elder kin to guide us both, we found ourselves becoming quite improper — but I had a love-rival, one who did not plan to go to the Army, a good man who had considerably better prospects. She married him, but not before she told me she should rather marry him and lie with me than be obliged to do both with just one of us."
"Will you come with me," he murmured, too low and holy to be a question, mouth still close to mine as if afraid that I might leave his lips forever. I smiled, heart lighter now.
"Surely you do not need more data regarding my character," said I, mortally offended, "I am quite evidently not a sexual deviant!"
"Love is a kind word for it," he said. "Ugly commonplace little affairs, rather more for the experiment than the pleasure. Let us forget them."
"Oh!" said Miss Morstan, blushing quite enchantingly. "Oh, Doctor Watson... I should consider myself quite as privileged."
I cannot truly speak of that which followed. I have tried, but I can find no words to capture the profound revelations of that night: the feeling of a man's hand upon me, the acts that Holmes performed without a qualm upon my person, the acts I returned, no more degraded or ashamed than a supplicant at altar. I would have been afraid, but Holmes was curiously himself, quite as brash and dry as in his daily life — and he was, as in all the things that please him, beset by wild and reckless energy, sparkling and intense as fire. And indeed, I found myself quite different with him than with the conquests of my past, indelicate as I would not dream to be with a woman — and when he was irked by those fumbling errors of intercourse, by those doubts and worries and his own profound affection, with him as with no other I found it all quite riotously funny, and did not feel the need to hold back from saying so.
"I am quite serious," she said, laughing at me merrily. "And in any case, what would I want with a husband who had no other interest save myself? I would have to give him just the same, and I must confess that such a chore would distract me from my books most undesirably."
After a while she rose, and I walked her back to Mrs Forrester's. The woman herself was there to meet us at the door, with a gleam in her eye and a smile which Mary returned with honest warmth. I bid them both good day, and made my return to Baker Street.
Holmes stared at me, and I at him, as I realised the deep and abiding truth within those words. I could not imagine, let alone desire, the acts that Holmes desired; yet, I wanted to, I wanted it to be possible to love him as he loved me. It was all a-battle in my breast, all the glories of love against the greatest censures of society. I could tell from the very flutter of my heart which side was winning.
"Well," she said, shutting the lid of the treasure-box again, "Of course I am a little disappointed. But at the same time, I cannot feel a sense of loss — how can I lose that which I never possessed? And such a terrific amount of money... it is my experience that such an amount comes with an even heavier weight of responsibility. Indeed, look at how close you came to death just to get it!"
I had long since become accustomed to Holmes's strange, wild moods, but today, with the weight of the previous night hanging heavy over us both, it seemed particularly harsh. I found myself quite enraged by it, and after another five minutes of silent agitation on both our parts, I snatched up the morning paper and retired to my bedroom. Holmes did not look up at me as I left.
"Pray, speak your mind, Miss Morstan, I doubt there is a thing you could say that would make me think ill of you."
All through breakfast, my mind had been curiously blank, lulled by routine so that only the butterflies in my stomach and the skittish rapidity of my pulse reminded me that there was anything at all amiss. In the hansom, however, it finally occurred to me that I might have to prepare my words to Miss Morstan, since she was sure to be suspicious of the significant change in my attitude since the night before. I'll confess, for a moment I considered marrying her regardless — but I could not condone it, leading her to believe I could love her and only her, when my attentions seemed so inexorably drawn to Holmes. I could leave Holmes's acquaintance, no more to follow his methods or stand by his side — but the thought made my chest ache as though breathing in a bitter cold. Could I, then, try my best to ignore last night and reassert our previous friendship, for her sake? Discard it all as a slip and pray for forgiveness? My heart knew the answer before I had even considered the question.
"Holmes, dear boy," I said softly, after ten minutes of silent contemplation. "Which theory do you believe?"
Holmes looked at me for a long, inscrutable moment, and then lit his pipe. An interminable time later, when he had still not asked me about that which he had so clearly already deduced, I broke the silence myself by saying to the fire:
I must have looked very distraught indeed, for Holmes paused, then offered me a small token of comfort.
"Oh!" he said, in fine spirits once more, "I had quite forgotten it! Oh, what a merry mess I have made. But no matter; if you would consent to share the sofa with me for an hour, I think I should have it all straightened out and ready to present to Scotland Yard before tea."
"Holmes," I murmured curiously, and the arm moved a little, revealing nothing but a pair of bright, wide eyes.
"She indicated that she would be amenable to a proposal from a less exhausted man," I said. "It is not the engagement itself that is the issue."
"She was alone, and he was a wretch, and it was not my intention — oh, but it looks very poor, laid out like this."
"I have something to tell you, Holmes," I said eventually, with a voice that was heavy with sleep. "I do believe I am engaged to be married."
"No, I did not think ill of you at all," she said. "Perhaps the best thing I can do is tell you of him — if that is agreeable, my dear Doctor. I think..." She paused. "You should know of it."
"I could hardly not," said I, and said no more, for that was incriminating enough. Miss Morstan was no fool — she knew that I was not myself this morning, and she alone in all the world could tell what might have caused it.
"Need you ask?" said Holmes, huffing. "He was a wretch. I should not have thought so based on his partners alone, but he only loved two of them enough to treat them well, and used the others quite abominably."
I was silent, waiting for her explanation. She looked uncomfortable but assured, as though she knew her mind well, and had only to draw the strength to speak it.
"Well," said I, "I don't know if I should have been so forgiving. The man toyed with your heart most abominably."
My breath caught quite suddenly in my throat, then escaped in a long, slow sigh of wonder. Was Holmes — did Holmes feel something —
"And you, Doctor Watson, are a man of integrity and heart, a good man in fine form with few vices and a fine profession to sustain you, should you choose to go into practice. You were also more than happy to promise me security and devotion, and I believe you would keep any promise you would give. You would make the best, most dashing and inspiring husband I can imagine, and if —"
"Most definitely two," said Holmes. "Obviously, he loved the governess, for he confided everything to her, not just his passions but the details of his life. But he was besotted with his page, quite wildly and uncontrollably, it seemed — never has a servant been quite so bestowed with gifts, nor allowed quite so much liberty. And it was upon his disappearance that the man engaged me. He was quite the wreck."
"And so heavy!" she exclaimed, trying to raise it. "The box alone must be of some value. Where is the key?"
"That is all over," I reassured her. "It was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it."
"People bring down nations, Watson, not the acts themselves. No, it is all nonsense, and it will not do."
"I would, of course, only be content with a long engagement," she said, "So that we both might make the best decision possible. You might be a romantic, but you cannot deny the sense in that, and I will have it no other way."
John shook his head grinning and covered Sherlock’s hands with his own “Its abstract art” he assured him. “You just don’t understand my genius”, he grinned.
Sherlock returned the smile, conscious of the students still in the room with them but not wanting to alienate John. The blonde wrapped an arm around his waist, seeming unbothered by the fact that the door wasn’t closed and Mike, Molly, and Janine were still in the process of packing up. It wasn’t like he was being invasively or inappropriately close to the artist, but it was still something that couldn’t quite pass off as platonic. Sherlock avoided his student’s eyes as they walked out, but he could still feel their gazes on them. Mike, thank god for that boy, closed the door and left them alone together.
He and John had spoken a little more about Sherlock’s deductions and his military background, eye contact completely uninterrupted and more… intense than what was usually socially acceptable between strangers, but it had not felt uncomfortable at all. That was until Sherlock noticed the lack of sounds of graphite scratching the paper and he had turned to his students to demand why everyone had stopped drawing in favour of staring at them and for them to please continue and focus on the model before them, that’s why they were paying for college was it not? Everyone had instantly snapped back into their drawings and John’s muffled laughter was the only sounds accompanying the scurried scratches of pencils in tandem
Sherlock, not knowing how to respond just nodded, a little dumbstruck by John’s easy demeanour and lack of offence.
As soon as John was poised on the stage and the lights were set to Sherlock’s exact liking the class began to draw. John dropped the robe and got into a pose, closing his eyes against the brightness of the light. Sherlock waited at least 5 minutes into the first pose before he stopped circling the room in silence and sat down on his desk. He picked up his favourite graphite 5b pencil and began to draw. The moment the added sound of Sherlock’s pencil scratching the surface of the paper John opened his eyes and looked over at Sherlock. There was no change in his stance, his pose was naturally facing the professor and so their eyes met from across the room, the glaring lights contrasting against the dark classroom and giving John an unearthly glow that sparked imaginings of candlelight in Sherlock’s imagination.
He kept repeating to himself. His plan to avoid being seen by John in the few months he’d be here was ruined. In just 3 days. Fabulous. He was fairly certain he’d already broken one of his best quills as he mashed everything into his bag in his haste to as far away from there as possible. He swung his bag across his shoulders and at last… he looked up.
John smiled reassuringly, “Don’t worry, I know you don’t mean to”. Weirdly enough, the thought that someone as smart as Sherlock forgot John wasn’t someone who didn’t belong in his world was… nice in a way. It made John feel as if he wasn’t being watched as the outsider, but simply as another young wizard... waiting for that letter.
And so Sherlock went around the room. Occasionally saying “Wrong” or “You’re drawing is boring me. Stop boring me.
The next day, Friday, John walked into Divination quietly beside Greg and Molly. Greg had tried to rope him into the conversation a couple of times but after failing to make John so much as answer more than monosyllabic answer Molly had nudged him in the ribs and given him a pointed look.
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, as he opened his eyes and glared blearily as John. The look was completely ruined by the adorable sleepy quality to it, though, and all it rose from the Gryffindor was a fond laugh.
John watched the scenery passing through the window thinking about Sherlock. He’d hoped to thank him for the limp.
disastrous effects). She had sat him down and even made an effort not to laugh as she repaired all the bald spots and uneven cuts Sherlock had done while said boy sulked in the background and John giggled in delight. John’s clothes had also miraculously grown to his own size overnight, something he was sure Eliza did while he was sleeping so he would be more comfortable in them.
John had understood how crushed his friend had been when he’d had to move to France with his parents but… why should he have taken it out on
John heard Sherlock take a deep breath. “No.” he whispered. John waiting for him to explain. “It..it didn’t work John.”
“I have the tapes here on my phone. The first one is him after he arrived at the hotel. The second is him leaving. There was no sign of him coming back at all.”
The past five summers spent without John’s warm and familiar company had been the absolute worst ones Sherlock could remember. Not to mention, every single rotten day of attending The Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.
Sherlock didn’t even notice time going by until the sharp ringing of his alarm cut through the still concentrated silence of the room. Instantly all the students sighed as they relaxed and began stretching. John’s eyes opened and he wincingly kneeled himself down into a sitting pose again. Sherlock walked back to his desk to turn off the alarm, already planning how to make further conversation with John in this second 10-minute break before the final drawing session before lunch. But before he could think of anything he turned and saw John was already talking to some of his students. All of them clearly having found John’s history in the military service fascinating. Molly, Mike and Mary were huddled around asking him questions enthusiastically. Mary had gone back to curling her hair around her finger, much to Sherlock’s annoyance.
Once they arrived at the castle and entered the Great Hall they took their usual seats at the far end of the Gryffindor table.
John inched closer and licked his lips, his breath now caressing Sherlock’s face gently “Me either” he whispered and nudged at Sherlock’s face with his own, searching. With one last look at Sherlock’s open and vulnerable face, John closed his eyes and kissed Sherlock’s awaiting pink lips and sighed.
“Oh… well yes. I suppose so. Wouldn’t you like to interrogate the wife yourself? You always love to see these cases through”
John walked into the Great Hall the next morning, already scanning the tables and rows of students for a familiar curly head. Anticipation thrummed low in his stomach. But after a quick scan and another more careful plucking out of individual faces and hair styles John didn’t spot Sherlock anywhere.
By the afternoon John had stopped balancing on his ‘injured’ leg and was having a harder time concentrating on the poses. Sherlock could see that although John hadn’t yet asked for a chair, he would soon enough.
“EUGH!” he spat out the jelly bean into the ground spluttering and shaking his head fervently. “What WAS that?” he exclaimed, peering at the back of the jelly bean box in the darkness.
But as he returned to the library there was Irene, approaching Sherlock in her usual flirty manner, hips swaying slowly as she strode gracefully towards him and took a seat next to him,
“Hey! You’re the one who hasn’t introduced us!” John raised his hands defensively, still grinning and not looking even the slightest bit remorseful. “Besides, you’re set to meet Harry and Clara next week for their ‘back together dinner’ so it’s only fair.” He stepped closer to Sherlock. Taking the phone away from his hand and placing it on the nearest chair (Sherlock’s) before wrapping his arms around his waist.
Sherlock snorted, of course, the first thing John would say after 7 freaking hours of being UNCONSCIOUS would be some sort of joke. “You’re the one who got hit by a BLUDGER!”
in the living room where John could hear their every word. He cleared his throat, “we’ve only been living together for 8 and a half months I think the kid's talk can wait” he said hurriedly, trying to hush his tone as best he could whilst attempting not to be obvious. He felt himself blushing to the tips of his ears in mortification as John looked up from his paper curiously.
Granted he was only 7, but John expected nothing more of life than he did from a Sunday afternoon at home.
All the will in the world wouldn't have stopped John even if he wanted it to. He grabbed Sherlock’s blue striped tie in an impulse and pulled him closer, not caring if the whole student body and staff saw them.
The light radiating from the windows was deepening into orange by the time they reached the elevator, Sherlock pressed the button for the fifth floor. He was starting to look a little nervous as if John would suddenly leave or say he changed his mind. The blonde just slipped his fingers into Sherlock’s, interlacing them and squeezing his hand tightly, reassuringly.
John’s head turned minusculely, almost imperceptible to anyone other than Sherlock. He smiled inquisitively “It
The drawing…Well. It was pretty dreadful. It held absolutely no resemblance to Sherlock at all. It looked like some sort of mutant swan creature layered in dots and smudges.
A few moments later Sherlock finally broke the comfortable silence. “Will we still do this? When we.. when we get to Hogwarts?”
He heard Sherlock’s name thrown in now and he leant closer. “He’s a freak Elizabeth! An incompetent freak! That is no boy of mine! If I had known that all you would give me is a useless
“Oh… I’d- yeah. I- I’d like that” Sherlock smiled. John smiled back softly, wondering if tucking that stubborn curl behind Sherlock’s ear would be alright with the Beauxbatons and almost raising his hand to do just that when just that second a small envelope dropped in front of Sherlock with a smack.
“Sorry sorry…. This isn’t working.” He stopped and looked at their hands, pressed back to back by the vine. Sherlock knew he’d be able to get rid of the devil snare with a simple light enchantment, but Filch was coming and although he suspected there was someone in here, that was no reason to give him a confirmation. They’d be followed. “We need to figure out something. It’s going to crush our hands if we keep going” Sherlock muttered.
“And Sherlock won't be taking any new model’s any time soon. Thanks.” He continued, voice tight and clearly aiming to be threatening but not enough to make a scene. Angry John made quite an impression, though. Especially when he forced a pleasant smile on his face. His presence in the room seemed to grow ten times his size and the art critics smug smirk slowly faded away to a displeased twisted scowl.
“What the on earth are these?” Sherlock couldn’t stop giggling as he pointed at several tiny dots and smudges John had smeared on the sliver of back you could see and a single squiggly dot on his hip.
Sherlock walked into his classroom with little energy. Although he was not a stranger to lack of sleep, he had to admit that sleeping sporadically over a period of more than 3 weeks was definitely not helping him concentrate. He rose the coffee he was clutching in one hand to his lips and sighed in pleasure as the hot liquid warmed his insides and spurred some new energy into his body. Bless Mrs.Hudson for always making him a cup of coffee to-go every single morning without fail. That woman was a saint.
“Right. So John. For this next experiment, I’ll need to jump off the highest point of the tree house.”
John thought bitterly as he mounted his broom and adjusted his bit-too-long second-hand Quidditch robes to avoid tripping over them as he took off
“SO! You up for another round or have you had enough losing?” John said, flying up to meet him with a wink.
Molly laughed, “yeah, he can be. But no. I learned that wherever he is, whatever he’s doing… He wants you there. He- he feels the same way about you, John” And then she smiled sweetly and walked away before he could even begin to think about his protests.
Sherlock was infatuated. So what? He frowned, turning towards the door and almost expecting Mycroft to barge in with a snide comment. But no one came. The room was just as quiet. Sherlock sighed. What to do now?
He walked around the room slowly, still feeling John’s eyes following his progress as if tracking his prey. He felt his heart thumping against his chest, wanting nothing more than for all the students to disappear so he could tackle John and kiss him against the floor of the platform. Or a wall. Or any conceivable surface around.
A distant memory from the time Sherlock’s father had opened the door and startled them apart flashed quickly through John’s eyes. He remembered Sherlock’s face, so close to his, looking nervous and… expectant? Anticipating? John’s brow furrowed, he hadn’t revisited that night in his memories for so long. He still didn’t quite understand the charge in the air. The feeling of some force pulling them together… towards what?
Finally, his head breached the water and he smelled air, and flowers, and water, and so much more than he had ever imagined.
When they arrived at their first crime scene and Sherlock started whirling around, firing off his deductions at light speed, John could only stand on his own away from everything, watching Sherlock with a sad smile. When Sherlock was busy insulting Anderson, Lestrade came over to John and squeezed his shoulder.
John's eyes widened even more and he swallowed heavily. "W-what..." he was able to produce but Sherlock silenced him with a gentle finger on his chapped lips, shaking his head. John needed rest and exhaustion as well as fear would have been damaging rather than helping him heal. In his friend's eyes, there still stood little question marks. He didn't know what was wrong with him, where he was and why, and if he would be able to hear ever again. The worst about it, though, was that he couldn't word questions properly without affecting his pronunciation.
Sherlock looked up at John whose eyes were watery again. His brave soldier kept a hold of himself, though, and returned his look.
The human's eyes were closed. They weren't blue now, Sherlock noted sadly, they were closed and pale, just like the rest of the body. His left shoulder was still bleeding. The bang Sherlock had heard probably was the reason for this injury. What had Mycroft called it?
Sherlock's brow crinkled in a frown, and he let out a sigh that showed how sad he was. He looked unhappily at his fish tail, splashing with his fins, then turned around and swam to his room.
John was so gentle and tender, he felt safe in his arms because he knew he could trust him. John would never hurt him.
On many nights, doctors came out to the sea to get some water and they talked about how nicely the young man was recovering and it made Sherlock proud that he was the one who made it possible for John to live. And he thought of how softly his hair had felt against his chest, and he thought of his deep, blue eyes. Increasingly, Sherlock's wish to walk on land and live among the humans and thus be able to see John again grew. The world seemed so much wider and better and more interesting with so many new things to explore. Sherlock's heart grew heavy whenever a month passed by, and he knew that one day he'd turn into sea foam, thus having an immortal soul, not like the humans, and would never be able to see John again.
