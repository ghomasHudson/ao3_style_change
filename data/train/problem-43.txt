“The view. It’s beautiful,” he said, eyes lingering on Sherlock for a moment before he turned his eyes back to the horizon where it was now a light pink as the sky itself brightened to a soft blue.
“How long have you had her?”
“Coming, Daddy!” came the reply a moment later from around a corner. She caught sight of him and started to make her way through the flowers without bothering with finding the stone path that wound throughout the garden.
“Forgive me, John, for any hurt I may have caused you,” Sherlock said, no trace of irony in his tone as John was instantly thrown back into an underground Tube car with a bomb steadily ticking down to their deaths while Sherlock begged forgiveness on his knees.
“I need things to keep Sherlock occupied. I was hoping that if I have whatever you can give me I can keep him inside.”
After several moments, John pushed up and carefully pulled out. Sherlock shivered at the sudden emptiness again, but then John laid down beside him and they both stared up at the ceiling, reliving every moment of what they had just done.
John was breathing heavily by the end of his speech. He hadn’t meant to say all of that, not really, but once he had started the floodgates opened and there was nothing to hold it back. Sherlock was still staring wide-eyed at him, blinking occasionally, and John was terrified he had gone too far. Said too much.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around his back and held him close. John felt the pounding of his heart against his chest, and may have squeezed Sherlock that much tighter to hold on to the feeling before carefully pulling away. He placed a kiss against Sherlock’s sweaty temple before he rolled off the bed and made his way into the ensuite bathroom where he quickly cleaned himself up with a wetted flannel. He grabbed another clean one and carried it back into the bedroom to clean Sherlock. He was awarded for his efforts by a lazy, contented smile from his husband.
“Well I was asleep before a certain someone decided to try and blow up the flat,” John snarked.
“Strawberry,” John cut in with a smile. “Yes, I know.”
John lost control at his words, his body flooded with pure want and he slammed into Sherlock once, twice more, his balls drawn up tight to his body before he came so hard his vision went black around the edges, Sherlock’s name on his lips as he cried out.
What was far more concerning was the possibility of quarantine. Not for John, of course. He would be perfectly content to stay at home and read and work on his blog.
“Love you,” Rosie yawned sleepily as Sherlock pushed a curl back from her forehead.
“You can pick,” John said as he climbed up the stairs to get his pajamas to change into after his shower. One day down. At least 13 more to go.
Secondly, I'll be honest and say I'm not 100% in love with this chapter. It was kicking my butt and John wasn't ready to cooperate with me. Hopefully, he gets his head together tomorrow for me. He's a stubborn one.
Sherlock hummed in response before he blew on the hot liquid in his cup and took a careful sip.
He held back his fist, however. Instead, he guided Joy into the car and followed after her. He took adverse pleasure in watching Joy shake her body, slinging dirty London moisture from her coat and her paws dripping wetly onto the carpet of the vehicle.
God, he hated his life.
So, what does someone give to the person who saved you from yourself? Something that said, “I really thought about you and what would make you happy”. He wondered if a pack of scratch-offs would be inappropriate. She did enjoy them, so it would be something that made her happy, but did that set the tone that he was trying to convey? He would much rather not have to say anything in actual words. Communicating non-verbally was much better for him, even though it didn’t always get his message across. He just wasn’t good with words, especially the ones that were needed for sharing emotions of any sort.
“Go do an experiment.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock agreed with a smile.
“Maybe you could cook for me sometime,” Mary said from the doorway where she had apparently stopped. John whipped his head back around to look at her. She was watching him with a small, shy smile on her face that didn’t match the boldness of the sentence she had just said to him.
John continued to press into Sherlock’s prostate between fucking his fingers into him, scissoring them and adding his tongue occasionally, until Sherlock was a sweaty, incoherent mess.
“If you need anything, feel free to ask,” she said before turning around and walking to wherever she had been before, or so he assumed.
“Sure,” she agreed, as she stood up quickly and put down her mug. “There’s a nice little shop just down the street.”
“Course I’m alright.”
“I’m not drunk, John. Well. Not much, anyway.”
Sherlock’s mouth curled into a sharp grin at that and John swallowed at the sight of it.
John pulls Sherlock’s mouth back down to his and this time the kiss is more gentle, more exploratory, a caress of lips and slide of slick tongues. There was no rushing this kiss. It was an acceptance of what was happening between them, their bodies pressing tightly together, hands lightly exploring the other.
A specialist being recalled? Why would John care? Why would he come to tell John something like that? Who could be recalled and from what?
“I upset her? It wasn’t me who upset her, Mycroft.”
“I can’t,” Sherlock stated.
“Of course not.”
“Me too,” John agreed. He leaned over, careful to not jostle Rosie in her sleep, and pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock returned it with equal gentleness.
“Of course. When you said you loved me, did you mean…?”
“I’ll do the cleaning up since you cooked,” he said, and watched as his friend nodded and made his way out of the kitchen. John put away the leftovers before gathering all the dirty dishes and washing them in the sink. When he was finished he dried his hands on the dish towel and made his way to the bookcase with his glass of wine. He grabbed his new book off the shelf and sat down in his chair across from Sherlock, who was already absorbed in his own book. John smiled to himself as he settled in and made himself comfortable. He could get used to quiet evenings like this.
Freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon brought Sherlock to consciousness the next morning. The aromas and the pop of the bacon in the pan on the hob had invaded his dreams, leaving him with the odd sensation of having been making breakfast while standing on a rooftop before being tied down and strapped to two poles. He hadn’t been having a nightmare, it hadn’t quite reached that point, but curls sticky with sweat clung to his forehead and he was grateful he had skipped putting on a shirt to sleep in last night. His chest was slick with sweat and he didn’t like the sensation of wet cotton adhered to his body.
“I didn’t want to get everyone sloshed in one drink.”
“No, you stay here and have lunch. We’re here anyway. I’ll meet you back at the flat later,” he said, then turned, satisfied with the dramatic twirl he felt his coat give and hailed a taxi.
“What kind of game?”
He shook his head at himself as he settled onto the couch and pulled the tartan blanket over his legs before turning on the telly. He drank his tea and ate his toast while the light outside slowly turned from grey to the blush of a rare cloud-free morning in London.
“Sherlock, if you really think...”John began after several minutes of quiet contemplation, his eyes still on the fire, and he could feel Sherlock’s sharp gaze on him. “Sherlock, if you really think that it would make that much of a difference, then I will reconsider moving in.”
John’s eyes narrowed perceptively when Sherlock opened his mouth to argue, and rather than rile the doctor up, which was something he did occasionally enjoy doing just for the sake of it, he flickered his fingers lazily in acquiescence of the order and made his way to his room to do just that.
He sipped at his tea as a hand absently rubbed at his chest. It didn’t hurt as much as it used to, to think about Sherlock. Which was a good thing, really, because John thought about him all the time. An attractive woman flirted and winked at him, and instead of being able to engage or encourage the behavior from her, he sat in his office remembering someone else who used to wink and flirt with him, though he knew it wasn’t really flirting, not really, when it came to Sherlock.
“What are you doing?” John asked bemusedly as Sherlock opened up the phone and pulled up the forward-facing camera. He held it up over them and John laughed.
John had managed to fall asleep for an hour or two at the kitchen table, which was truly unfortunate for his neck and shoulder. At the time, he supposed that if that had to happen, at least it was on the day when he didn’t have to work. There was the office party that evening, but that had been plenty of time for paracetamol to kick in, and he was relaxed enough after spending the day picking up around the flat, playing with Joy, and eating more of Mrs. Hudson’s biscuits when she came up for tea.
Greg looked at him and gave a small nod. He finished his tea quickly and put the empty mug down on the table.
One of the nurses, a new one that John couldn’t seem to ever remember the name of, kept attempting to engage him in conversation and plying him with more of the gin cocktails. He couldn’t help but think she was flirting with him, with the way her eyes kept looking up at him through her long lashes and she kept bringing attention to her mouth by sipping at the dainty straw from her own drink. He smiled and interacted with her whenever she pushed into his space, but he was silently starting to wonder when he could leave without seeming completely rude.
“That was a great tackle tonight, John,” Sherlock’s voice suddenly cut through the sound of the water, and it had to have been his imagination that it was deeper than before. “It was very...impressive,” he continued, and John sucked in a sharp breath as his orgasm stole over him.
The next time Sherlock charged into the loo was no less shocking, but slightly less rage-inducing. At least this time he was already out of the shower, a towel wrapped securely around his waist, as he stood in front of the mirror and applied shaving cream to his face. He was lucky the door hadn’t hit him when it was swung open. Unfortunately, he had been mid-shave with his razor and the sudden entrance had caused him to nick his chin.
John scratched at the back of his neck as he looked at her and tried to formulate any kind of response to that. He only cooked for himself and Mrs. Hudson. He cooked for two. Mrs. Hudson and he were the two. Or he cooked for himself and his future self, which technically was one, yes, but for his current purpose, his future self that ate the leftovers for lunch was separate from him, and thus, two.
“Shower,” he said again, and John forced himself to nod and turn to head up the stairs.
“Holding me is a fantasy of yours?”
“Sherlock, I’m going to have to pass on the flat,” John suddenly began, and Sherlock felt his stomach fall through the floor before he continued. “It’s been quite an interesting day, and while I’ll admit I’ve enjoyed parts of it, and meeting you, I,” he stopped when his mobile pinged and Sherlock had never been so happy to hear a text message from a suspected murderer before in his life.
“So, I met a friend of yours,” John began and Sherlock scrunched up his nose.
He was willing to admit that for a brief moment he wanted to cut all ties from John Watson for the simple reason that his brother seemed to have approved of him in some way, but it was a fleeting feeling of brotherly pettiness and was gone in a moment. The mystery that was John Watson was more stimulating than any feud he might wish to further with his brother. And that was saying something, wasn’t it?
The smile of a genuinely happy John Watson.
“Rue the day that comes,” John said with a wry smile, and Sherlock smirked at him before he turned away to presumably walk to his chair.
He hadn’t willing been inside a church since he was dragged there as a teenager by his grandmother, and even though he no longer believed, he found himself oddly comforted by the sight of the mostly empty pews and the scent of incense blended with the greenery of the fresh Christmas decorations that filled the space.
“Then why do you need me there?”
“Up, please.” Rosie pulled her hand from John’s and turned to reach up to Sherlock, who bent down and lifted her easily before propping her on his hip. One small hand immediately went to Sherlock’s hair and she played with his curls, only earning one gentle reminder to please not pull. She stayed there happily until after they placed their order.
Madness crept in, whispering its treacherous words, dripping poison into his ears.
“It’s late. Go get changed into something dry before you freeze,” Sherlock said.
“I...I don’t know what this is.”
Who would have thought that the catalyst needed to finally make this thing between them bloom into something more would be forcing Sherlock to stay at home for days on end? John felt another giggle bubble up, and it was just impossible to keep them in. He was giddy in a way he hadn’t been in years.
“Sounds good. I have a new novel to read as well.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and John grinned. “No. It’s perfectly safe. Just open it.”
John swallowed past the hard lump that appeared in his throat, all of his earlier playfulness completely forgotten.
“Are we really not going to talk about this?” he asked and was surprised by the uncertainty in his own voice.
Sherlock stopped just outside the kitchen doorway, completely rooted to the spot as he took in the gentle swaying of John’s hips and the smooth cadence of his tenor blending with the singer coming from the speaker.
“Fine, fine. I guess we’re going to the beach,” John relented and Rosie jumped up and down in excitement.
“Who is he?” John asked, cutting through his thoughts.
It was a riot of color, but it wasn’t blinding or overbearing. John spun slowly in a circle as he took it all in.
“It’s a three-patch problem,” the man replied with his eyes closed, completely unconcerned with John.
Martha sighed happily to herself as she entered her kitchen and set about her dinner preparations and coming up with all the questions she wanted answers to. Hopefully, they would take advantage of her being down here to start making plans for their special day. She had always known they would make a lovely couple, no matter how much those two darling boys protested their couplehood. She knew, though. The whole time, she knew.
He turned his hand in Sherlock’s, pressing their palms together and threading his short fingers through Sherlock’s longer ones. The man looked up at him with his silver eyes for the first time since he touched John’s hand and John’s heart leapt at the eye contact.
“Watch your feet, Rosie,” he reminded her.
He took a quick shower and threw on a pair of comfortable jeans and a soft jumper. He briefly considered a touch of product in his hair, then shook his head at himself. It’s just dinner in his own flat. Why would he put stuff in his hair? He did give an extra vigorous rub with his towel for his hair and didn’t bother to comb it, though.
In the crisper were apples with shiny pinkish-red skins.
“We leave Friday.”
When they were seated at a small table in the cafe, coffees in hand, and a blueberry muffin in front of Molly, Sherlock considered how impossible this would have been before he fell. There were many regrets in the decision he had made to fall, and the consequences of them had been severe in both expected and unexpected ways, but this was one thing that was better than before. He could consider Molly a friend, and she could do the same. They spoke about nothing in particular while Molly picked at her muffin.
“Well I’d love to see it when you calm down a bit,” John chuckled and she stilled long enough for him to see a flash of cloudy blue before she turned and ran towards Sherlock, jumping in his arms without hesitation, who deftly caught her and swung her up on his hip as he continued walking towards John.
“Maybe later,” he said with a laugh, then turned back into the room. Sherlock had left at some point while he spoke to Rosie, presumably to go drop off his own bag, judging by the open door of the bedroom across the way.
John stood looking at his back for a few moments. Sherlock had made dinner. It smelled amazing. It wasn’t the first time Sherlock had cooked of course, he was a grown man and perfectly capable of cooking, but this was different somehow. John couldn’t quite figure out what made it different, but he knew it was.
I forgot to post this. Sorry!
Sherlock leaned back in his chair with his elbows propped on the soft sides. He steepled his fingers together under his chin and regarded him thoughtfully.
She wouldn’t just go and decorate on her own, though. She was determined that John be a part of the process, and as such, she had taken to venturing up several times a day, whenever John was in the flat, and staring at the tree disparagingly.
“You’re clean. I’m clean,” Sherlock replied, and John didn’t bother asking how Sherlock knew that he had recently been tested. And he trusted Sherlock when he said he was clean.
“I think this is plenty. It’s just me up here in this flat.”
“Zero times an hour today,” he replied haughtily.
His friend’s eyes were intense on his, searching, and John was sure that Sherlock knew what his wish was.
“What do they normally say?”
“I’m fine.”
He knew that it was time to put his past behind him. He did. And some days he did really well with it, but something about this time of year made it impossible for him not to dwell on thoughts and memories of Sherlock Holmes.
“Yeah, I suppose. I don’t like eating the same meals all the time, so I kind of have to cook different things.”
John glanced down at the table and noticed yet another plate of biscuits. He grabbed a tray and placed the tea and the plate on it before leaving the kitchen. The clacking of keys had faded and the living room was silent by the time he walked in with his laden tray.
“I wasn’t expecting you today. Did you text? I left my mobile at home. I have no idea how I did that,” she fired off quickly as she stood up, but Sherlock waved her back down.
is practically required viewing for the Kingdom during Christmas.”
His hand shook as he reached out and placed it tentatively on Sherlock’s chest. His friend’s heart was beating wildly beneath his palm, his thumb tracing over the raised edges of the bullet hole there beneath the thin cotton of his shirt.
(See the end of the chapter for
John knocked his knee against Sherlock’s leg beside his with a chuckle. “True. You’re turn.”
He watched as Sherlock took a bite of the muffin, crumbs falling from the pastry and he leaned forward before they landed on his linen shirt. He hastily wiped the crumbs from his chin. John couldn’t help the smile that stretched across his face.
He had grown tired of Mrs. Hudson’s repeated comments and sighs about the state of his Christmas tree and it’s lack of decoration. She was not exactly a subtle woman, though she could be when she wanted to, but it appeared John’s tree was not one of those times she believed subtlety was called for.
He pulled up his mental map of London and the most likely route the taxi would be taking and took off, John right on his heels. He glanced back a couple of times as they ran. John kept pace, no cane in sight, and Sherlock let himself smile when no one could see. This was perfect! The adrenaline, the thrill of the chase, the potential for danger. This was what he needed to pull John in to get him to stay. For the flat, of course. Pull John in to stay for the flat. Though, he would admit that he was having more fun than he had had on previous cases where he worked alone.
At some point, he must have fallen asleep because when the sound of Mrs. Hudson’s screams reached his ears, the light leaking through his curtains was the pale grey and pinks of early morning.
They sat quietly for a long time after that, sipping their wine and listening to the music of the countryside at night. When his glass was empty, he played with the stem, rolling it between his fingers absently. He cleared his throat.
John huffed out a breath, half-laugh, and half-sob, as Nat King Cole’s soulful voice filled the space around them. Sherlock looked down at him, slipped the phone into his jacket pocket where the music was still easily heard, and held out his hand. John stared at it for a moment before taking it, letting Sherlock pull him into another dance right there in the hallway.
“Goodnight kisses,” she reminded him, and Sherlock bent over obediently and placed a kiss atop her blonde curls.
“And when is this supposed to be happening?”
“Sherlock?” he asked again, and he pulled back the curtain a bit to peek out at his friend. “You ok?”
“Of course you do, John. I wouldn’t be here today if you didn’t make a difference in the work,” he stated plainly. John felt his eyes widen momentarily at that admission. They never spoke about the incident with the cabbie after John had put a bullet in him and saved Sherlock’s life. Sherlock had steadfastly maintained that he never would have taken that pill, of course, but they both knew the truth. This was simply the first time he had ever come close to actually admitting it.
“Yes,” John murmurs, because he needs to confirm this for Sherlock, sees the question in his eyes that needs to hear the answer, and suddenly Sherlock is impossible closer, and those lush lips that John so often thought of were upon his in a tentative, almost chaste kiss as his hands reached out and rested on John’s hips.
“Of course it’s necessary. If I’m paying part of the rent I need my name on the lease,” John explained.
The taller man stared at him again and John was caught between wanting to sigh, scream, or laugh. He didn’t know what was the right thing to do in their situation.
Before Sherlock could take a sip he sneezed again.
“I did.”
They both managed to hold a straight face for roughly five seconds before breaking out into laughter. Sherlock’s deep chuckle and John’s high giggle mingled together in a bubble of mirth around them and John let himself live in that moment for a while. A happy Sherlock was truly something to behold and he would hold on to that as long as he could.
“Off to home, then?” he asked, and Rosie pouted as he turned and began the trek back to 221B.
“So you don’t have a girlfriend, then?” John asked and Sherlock managed to keep back the eye roll.
“Perhaps. Still would like an answer, though.”
“I found a butterfly! Its wings were all wet because of the rain, though.”
“Why ever not?” he exclaimed in surprise. John blinked at him, surprised in his own right, at the reaction.
Sherlock’s smile shifted into a smirk.
John wrinkled his brow in confusion. “What is that supposed to mean? As long as I get there, that’s what matters.”
“I’ll just put these up. Would you two like a cup of tea?” John asked as he apparently mentally shook himself out of whatever personal dilemma he appeared to be going through, and then he turned away without waiting for their reply. The sounds of the kettle being filled and mugs taken down came from the kitchen as Sherlock turned his attention back to the man still standing in the living room.
“Of course, I’m sure.”
Sherlock didn’t bother hiding his smile when he saw the text was from John. He walked back into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator to check on the contents before he typed back.
“Throwing that bowling ball was both impressive and quite possibly more terrifying than you shooting bullets at the walls. I’m so glad we got rid of that thing.”
Their laughter eventually died down, hiccoughing into the random chuckle until both were left with content smiles on their faces, the color high on both of their cheeks. Rosie continued to build sandcastles in the near distance while the surf lapped at their ankles.
It had been a week since he had picked up the book and brought it home and of the ten recipes he had attempted in that time, not a single one had come out to something remotely palatable. He had burnt cream sauce to a pot that he was still attempting to scrub off, undercooked chicken to the point where he questioned if he actually understood the concept of a timer, overcooked what would have been a phenomenal filet if he hadn’t come anywhere near it, and went through two bags of flour in an attempt to bake one single edible biscuit, and hadn’t actually managed that before giving up.
“I’m ready to go home,” John sighed into the air, and Sherlock nodded his agreement.
“Show me,” John said, the scotch and the look in Sherlock’s eye loosening his tongue.
“Who was it then?”
“Hardly. I was just thinking,” Sherlock said.
“Sherlock Holmes! What is on your finger, young man?”
John pulled out his wallet and paid the cabbie as they arrived in front of 221b, and he followed Sherlock out of the taxi and into the now misting rain. Sherlock unlocked the door and they made their way inside and then up the stairs to their flat.
“No sulking, Watson,” Sherlock admonished softly, “it’s been a long day and it’s time for your nap.”
Sherlock blinked at him for a moment. “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“We’ll see. I’ll call and find somewhere to take her in.”
Well. He was one, but he supposed he probably owed Mrs. Hudson a few meals after all the ones she had been feeding him over the last few months. He had no idea if he could really make anything decent beyond cheese toasties and a very basic spaghetti, but it wasn’t as if he was doing anything else with his free time, lately. It would be something different, at least. Perhaps learning how to cook would be fun.
He crossed the hallway and stuck his head through the open door after a perfunctory knock on the wooden frame. Sherlock was unpacking his suitcase and looked up at the knock.
I know this is a slow build, but I promise good things are coming. Thank you for reading! 💜
John watched, completely enraptured by Sherlock’s smile as he shared his memories of his grandmother and her home.
Things weren’t perfect, but it was a start.
John’s voice was a soft command. Sherlock slowly opened his eyes to look up at John, ears ringing from his elevated blood pressure, fingers digging into the flesh of his thighs, his chest and throat tight. John held his gaze, breathing slow, measured breaths, and didn’t look away until Sherlock began to subconsciously mimic those measured breaths and his heart slowed to a more reasonable pace.
“I’ll bring up those other dishes, dear, and then I’m going to go down to the flat and mind my own business,” she tossed over her shoulder and John shook his head.
Sherlock glanced at him completely bemused before he looked back out the window.
“I’m not sure how it could top this.”
, John thought. He wasn’t sure he would be able to survive fucking Sherlock Holmes if this was what it was like.
John frowned, then sighed. Ran his empty hand over his face.
His mind wandered back into his dream and he frowned. Fucking Mycroft. John hadn’t dreamed of Sherlock in a way that hadn’t ended with him lying on the pavement outside Bart’s in over a year. It was his fault John was suddenly seeing him in a dream, alive, and John was exhausted. A few cryptic words from the bastard and he was ready to believe anything, it would seem. His subconscious was, anyway.
His hand works them both almost lazily at first, enjoying the sensation of hard flesh on hard flesh, but then he lets go and leans over and rummages in his side table. John hears the familiar snik of a bottle being opened. Then the hand that holds them both is warm and slick and it’s working them faster and tighter and both of them lose the rhythm of their hips as their breathing gets heavy and the sounds that fill the room are carnal and raw. Both tumble headfirst over the edge into that blissful agony of orgasm, come spurting hotly over their bellies and each other’s names on their lips.
At some point, and John wasn’t sure exactly when it was, but he started to always assume that Sherlock would make his way into the loo while John showered. It didn’t happen every day, but it was more often than not.
“Let’s see what Sherlock really thought about me, then,” he said before pressing play and taking a sip of the amber liquid swirling in his glass.
“You said you loved me. Me and Rosie.”
He walked through the wrought iron gates that marked the entrance to the cemetery, his eyes automatically cataloging the presence of a black car parked on the other side of the street that he quickly ignored because it obviously meant nothing, and made his way towards the black stone that marked his friend’s resting place.
John took a deep breath, letting the jealousy settle in his body for a moment before choosing to let it go with a nod.
Nothing more than that, though. And it didn’t matter, anyway. He would never know.
“Wine with dinner?” Sherlock suddenly asked and John turned back to look at him.
“How did you build a snowman? With what snow? It hasn’t snowed yet this year, much less enough for a snowman.”
Sherlock played with the ring that John had given him. It was lovely. A simple band of platinum. Nothing intricate or ostentatious, which was exactly what Sherlock would have picked for himself. The only feature that stood out was the inside of the ring. The date they had met was engraved into the metal alongside the words My Best Friend.
Oh, that was delightful. John had essentially been kidnapped by his overreaching, overbearing older brother and the man hadn’t been intimidated at all. He had refused any kind of bribe. Somewhat surprising, given his lack of funds and not knowing him enough for any kind of personal loyalty to be in effect. Just a part of his personality, it would seem. That was good. A man who couldn’t be bought when he was down on his luck was something to be commended.
He should have realized sooner that it would just be another part of his life that a certain consulting detective would invade upon.
Later, he scrubbed bright yellow mustard off the wall. Mrs. Hudson had done such a nice job cleaning and he hated the thought of her going through so much trouble just for him to ruin it all.
Sherlock leaned back in his chair again with a satisfied smile and crossed his long legs.
Damn. He used to be so much better at this. Lying to John used to be easy. Now, it was so much harder. It didn’t help that his thoughts were far more jumbled than they should have been. Or that they had promised they wouldn’t lie to each other anymore. These were small lies, though, and couldn’t possibly count. He ignored the guilty twist his stomach gave.
“I was going to go out for dinner and thought you might be interested in joining me,” he replied, leaving out that the reason to go out for dinner was so the smell had time to leave the flat. He didn’t need to tell her. It was obvious she already knew.
The nurse that sat across from him smiled. “Not to worry. I was just asking how you like working at the clinic.”
“Humor me.”
“Oh, nothing in particular,” Sherlock replied, and that was an interesting notion.
Both men curled around Rosie, their eyes locked on each other until John could no longer resist the pull of sleep.
Sherlock glanced at him, the corner of his visible eye crinkling as the side of his mouth quirked up in a small smile. More of a smirk, really.
“Yes, it’s all taken care of. A car, a place to stay, everything.”
“What?”
Sherlock’s voice, low and needy and demanding, the sharp slap of skin against skin, the scent of sex and sweat in the air, Sherlock’s hands clutching and scratching and holding him, was coming together in such a perfect symphony of lust and desire that John knew he wouldn’t last much longer.
“It’s true he was a bad cabbie. You should have seen the route he took to get us here,” Sherlock agreed with a soft chuckle and John responded with his own, admittedly, inappropriate giggle.
“Since I was young,” Sherlock answered him and opened the door, which was indeed unlocked, and ushered John inside.
The other man gave a brief nod in acceptance of the apology and the promise to include him. Sherlock held back his smile.
He still looked broken when Sherlock fell. He looked betrayed and angry when Sherlock came back.
Sherlock must have felt his gaze. He shifted slightly, turning his head to look over his shoulder at John, a small smile tugging at his lips, and John didn’t bother hiding his own smile in return. Sherlock ducked his head, almost shyly, before he turned his attention back to Rosie who was now searching through the sand for seashells.
“What if there weren’t eyeballs in the microwave? Would you move in then?” he asked and John shook his head at him. He scowled and John laughed at him.
He threw his head back, breathing heavily but trying to hide that fact, his ears ringing, while he waited for his brain to kick back online. That was quite possibly the best orgasm he had ever had in a shower.
“Oh. Well. He stopped crying. Then he shoved me away and shouted at me.” John shrugged.
“No particular reason.”
Sherlock waved a hand like he was waving the statement away.
John’s fingers made quick work of Sherlock’s shirt, unbuttoning with shaky fingers, until he could push the garment off the man and carelessly onto the floor while Sherlock removed John’s belt, thumbed open his trousers, and reached his hand into John’s pants. John bucked into Sherlock’s fist as it closed around him. The heat of his hand and the mouth on his neck was nearly overwhelming and John felt his head hit the wall behind him.
“I’m sure we could find something to keep it in while we’re here. We’ll need to return it before our return home, though,” Sherlock said and Rosie nodded her enthusiastic agreement to this plan.
“You know,” Sherlock began haltingly, his fingers tightening gently in their hold on John’s hand, “I’ve been considering turning the upstairs bedroom into a laboratory.”
He had shot John down. “While I’m flattered…” he had said. “I’m married to my work,” he told him.
“Just think about it, okay?” she requested. He nodded, then she headed out the door.
“Where’s the body?” he asked, refusing to answer his question.
Oh. He ran out of the room and made his way quickly down the stairs. Of course! The murderer must have still had it! They had made a mistake, and that was all he needed to do. Find the suitcase, and he’d be one step closer to finding the murderer.
“Sherlock, this is beautiful.”
John laughed. “Yes, I suppose you’re right, after all.”
“You’re beautiful,” John said as he grabbed his cock and lined himself up to Sherlock’s entrance. He looked into his eyes as he slowly began to push into him.
“Sherlock.”
“Sherlock...you must have known.”
His date, a pretty young brunette that he had met on the Tube to work a couple weeks ago, was clearly dressed to impress in a flattering black dress that hugged her curves in a most delightful way. She was pleasing to the eye, and the conversation was enjoyable as well.
“Oh, that wasn’t going to happen. I told you she’s already claimed you,” Mrs. Hudson proclaimed with a flippant hand gesture.
The tide was high when they arrived. The crashing surf stretched lazily up the sand, darkening the previously wet sand before pulling it back out to sea again. John stood at that point where the waves beat the shore, curling his toes as the water rushed back out over his ankles and his feet sank into the wet sand. It was a strange feeling, of standing still yet moving, and there was something so familiar about that sensation that he couldn’t bear to step away.
“This was your room?” John asked and Sherlock looked at him with a hint of surprise on his features.
Sherlock frowned. “Stop apologizing, John.”
“I have a rather short temper,” John said. “I’m terrible at talking about my feelings and I drink an exorbitant amount of tea. I like to sleep in on the weekends. Would that bother you?” he asked.
“Yes, because you jumped up and knocked me down,” Sherlock replied.
He struggled with a thought, something to change the charged atmosphere.
She stood up when her tea was gone and took her mug over to the sink. He glanced at her as she gave it a quick wash before placing it face down to dry on the little rack beside the small sink. She turned to leave as John looked at the clock on the wall behind him to see if he had time for a cup of tea before the end of his lunch break.
“No, no. It’s fine. Thank you.”
“Fine. I dare you to tell me the first person you kissed.”
It was that man who stole Sherlock’s attention. Gold hair glinted in the rare London sunshine even through the grainy resolution of the old photo. There was a large grass stain on the upper chest of his rugby shirt, dried mud was caked into his exposed knees, and a large bruise that was healing when the photo was taken was just visible on his muscular right thigh where he must have taken a hit in a previous game. The man wasn’t fully turned towards the camera, however. His face was half-turned towards his client, his eyes clearly on him, as he stood close to Mr. Campbell with his arm wrapped around him. His hand rested possessively on his hip and they were leaning into each other comfortably.
John stirred the sugar into Sherlock’s cup as the song came to its end, his lovely voice floating softly down from the room. He imagined Sherlock carefully tucking the blanket around Rosie, maybe brushing a stray curl from her forehead, and his heart felt so full that he thought it could burst and he would die a happy man.
“Hurry up, John. We need to get there before it starts to rain,” Sherlock carried on without any care to John’s anger.
“What did he do?” Sherlock asked quietly, and John turned to look at him before he leaned back into the couch again.
He smiled into his mug as John settled onto the couch beside him with a muffled groan. John adjusted the blanket over their legs before leaning back and into Sherlock again. He took a bite of his biscuit, crumbs falling haphazardly. John lifted a hand and brushed the crumbs away.
John fought to keep his face from betraying his surprise. Sherlock? What does this man have to do with Sherlock? He wasn’t sure what he was expecting when all of this nonsense started, but it wasn’t this.
“I used to hunt for sea glass as a boy,” Sherlock’s deep voice suddenly disclosed and John turned to look at him.
John’s gaze was immediately drawn to Sherlock, who stood in the window with the fairy lights flickering over his dark curls as he played. Joy was curled up on the floor beside him, her head resting on one of his large bare feet. When she saw him come in, her tail thumped the floor lazily, but she didn’t even bother to raise her head up.
“We should meet up for drinks, soon,” Greg said, and John nodded.
They woke to grey skies and steady rain on their last full day at the cottage, but they didn’t let the weather keep them from enjoying themselves. Even Rosie found ways to occupy herself, and John counted himself lucky that she didn’t spend the entire day crying and whinging about being stuck inside. They played and read books with her when she demanded their attention and helped her “play” with Ice Cream, which mainly consisted of her holding him in her palm and squealing gleefully whenever he poked out of his shell. When there had been a lull in the rain that afternoon, Sherlock had taken Rosie down to the water to hunt for more sea glass treasure that the storm might have brought to shore.
“Did you really come in here to tell me we’re out of milk?” When the man nodded John fought off the urge to roll his eyes and looked back at his reflection. “You are aware you are perfectly capable of going to the shops and buying milk when we’re out, right?” he asked. He picked off the tissue that was still on his face, made sure the bleeding had stopped, then carefully finished his shave while studiously ignoring the taller man hovering behind him.
“John, Die Hard is not a Christmas film.”
The stories he ended up telling John about were often charming and delightful in a way that John wouldn’t have expected. And it wasn’t just the stories. It was how Sherlock told them. For a man who prided himself on his analytical brain and ability to divorce himself from feelings, he was a natural-born storyteller. His stories didn’t hide behind facts or reason the way his deductions did. They were nuanced and entertaining.
“Daddy, it’s my favourite. Obviously,” she stated, and John turned to look at his friend who had the decency to look mildly guilty at the new word that had been added to his daughter’s ever-increasing vocabulary.
He stood in front of the door, back straight and shoulders pulled back before he took a deep breath and knocked.
As always, kudos and comments are loved! 💕
He also had the number of the veterinarian, but he didn't think that was likely.
John glanced back towards the woman when the car pulled up into an abandoned car park and she told him to go ahead and get out. He stepped out of the car and approached a tall man standing beside an empty chair. The man leaned against an umbrella and John tried not to roll his eyes at the deliberate attempt to appear completely at ease. He had served two tours on the front lines in Afghanistan and the past 24 hours had been filled with more unexpected drama and spectacle than he had ever experienced there, barring the day he was shot.
He was on the hunt for the sunblock in the small bag he had filled with beach supplies and the towels he had brought down when Sherlock spun around to stare at him.
His eyes strayed from the telly to the plate of biscuits. He shrugged and reached out, grabbing two off the plate before popping one in whole. He sighed in bliss as the buttery goodness practically melted on his tongue.
Molly watched him, a sad and concerned expression on her face, and Sherlock hated to be pitied. He looked away from her again.
“Yes, but how have you managed to keep it a surprise?”
“You’re welcome, dear.” She fussed a moment with her own tea and settling comfortably onto her spot beside him. One hand absently patted his knee before she grabbed the remote and turned the telly on to some holiday program running on BBC. The volume was on low, for now, just background noise to whatever conversational topic she had in mind. John sipped his tea and waited patiently for her to begin.
“We’re going to the beach!”
After she was settled, John went and took a quick shower. He changed into his pajamas, then made his way back downstairs after checking that Rosie was asleep in her room. He went into the kitchen and filled the kettle with fresh water and placed it on the hob. He pulled down mugs and found the tea.
“Did he offer you money to spy on me?” Sherlock asked.
He wrapped and tied his robe around himself as he made his way down the stairs from his room and padded into the kitchen. His body went through the familiar motions of preparing his tea and breakfast without any input from his brain, which was why it wasn’t until he had taken his tea and toast into the living room to watch the news on the telly that he noticed the stockings hung along the mantle. And the Christmas tree in the corner that was wrapped in colorful fairy lights, but no other decoration.
John turned back to his soup and gave it a stir with a wooden spoon, then put a lid on the pot and lowered the temperature. When that was done, he turned back to the kettle and reheated the water, and went about the task of making tea. Sherlock went and cleared a space for the two of them to eat at the kitchen table. He finished just as John set down two cups of tea, and they sat down across from each other.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and John smirked up at him. Two can play these games.
Rosie spun and looked at Sherlock. “You have to eat all your dinner so we can get ice cream.”
His mind wandered back to his visit to Sherlock’s grave as he watched the small flame wave flicker and move. Mrs. Hudson’s hip had been bothering her that morning. She had stayed home to rest it, but had insisted that John leave Joy downstairs with her to keep her company. He agreed after taking her for a quick walk and had left the two of them sitting happily on the couch watching some game show, Joy’s head resting atop Mrs. Hudson’s thighs as she scratched her ears and waved John out of the door.
“Damn, he’s leaving! Let’s go, John!” he instructed as he jumped from his seat and pulled on his coat and scarf hurriedly.
“Supplies. Condoms, lube. I checked your nightstand and got the brands you like.”
“You know, I’ve been considering turning the upstairs bedroom into a laboratory,” he began. After the conversation about the kitchen, it seemed like a good place to start. He could purchase a small refrigerator and freezer for any experiments and specimens he might need. Perhaps that wasn’t as good a place to begin as he thought, though, because the expression on John’s face went from confused to some expression he couldn’t read. He swallowed hard. “So I was just thinking maybe you’d like to share my room instead. If you wanted, that is,” he continued, but John stayed silent. He kept his eyes locked on their hands, unable to meet his eyes, and he felt his stomach fall through the floor of the taxi as he clung to John’s hand. “It was just a thought,” he said and hated how small his voice came out.
“I’m so sorry, what did you say?” he asked apologetically.
John wasn’t sure why, or at least if he did know why he didn’t want to fully look it in the face right then, but the sound of Sherlock’s rich baritone at the moment, even while complaining, had John biting back a moan as he grew harder in his fist.
Are we really having small talk right now? John thought.
“What?” he whispered.
“John, we’re wasting time here.” Sherlock jumped up, causing Joy to jump up as well, and he began pacing as he always did before, the faded colors of the rug marking his path,
All he knew were Sherlock’s hands on his hips as he held him close, the taste of him on his lips, the sounds he made when John scraped his nails down his back and sunk his fingers in the glorious roundness of his arse, the way his body arched against him.
“Suppose we’ll find out soon enough.”
“Yes,” he said and John’s laughter fell back into that soft smile from before and Sherlock tapped the screen, capturing the moment as they looked at each other, smiling. He tossed his phone aside without looking at the photo. He knew it was everything he wanted.
John sighed. Then he wrapped the towel around him and made his way up to his room to get dressed. There was a triple homicide that needed to be solved.
“That’s a neat snail you found. I like the colors on its shell,” he told her and her smile grew.
“Mistletoe?”
“Yes, actually.”
“Dinner should be ready in about 10 minutes, I think. According to the instructions, anyway,” John told him. “Did you two have fun?”
“Clearly we can’t get married.”
Time had no meaning. His chest was on fire, his heart slamming against his ribs, his throat tight, his eyes burning as he pinched them closed, the tears leaking through regardless. He let out a scream, but there was no one to hear him, no one to care, and it did him no good, so he clutched his hair tighter, trying to center himself.
He released the breath and opened his eyes.
“John.”
It didn’t matter what Sherlock had done, not really. It didn’t matter that Sherlock knew how John felt and didn’t feel the same way. Sherlock still cared for him, it was obvious in every action he had taken that led to this point, and John made the decision that that would be enough. He would accept what Sherlock could give him and not ask for more.
Greg did, in fact, arrive in the offending jumper that evening and John couldn’t stop the laugh that rose out of him when he saw Sherlock’s face. It really wasn’t that bad. It was a bit chaotic, perhaps, but John was fairly sure that was the point. Besides, Sherlock’s arched brow and look was kind of lost as he stood in his own ridiculous jumper that matched him and Rosie. John hadn’t really thought he was telling the truth when he said he had matching ones for them all, but he was honestly delighted to have been wrong.
With that he pushed himself up, just slightly wobbly on his feet, and picked up their empty glasses to take to the kitchen.
John stood and made his way back to the kitchen, pulled open an upper cabinet, and grabbed the nearly empty bottle at the front. He poured a finger of whisky into his empty teacup before turning to look at the closed door at the end of the hallway. It didn't matter that it wasn't even 6, yet. He raised the glass in salute.
“Why sea glass?”
There were things that needed to be said, spoken aloud for them both to hear, but there would be time for words later. At that moment, they moved on instinct alone. It was time for feeling, for showing, for proof of life. For breathless moans and clinging embraces that would end in bruises on both of their bodies.
“Nor I,” Sherlock agreed in a low voice.
“Mrs. Hudson, I really don’t think I can take care of a dog.”
“Rosamund Watson, what on earth are you wearing?” Sherlock’s deep, sleep-muddled voice came from the other side of his squirming daughter.
“Seriously? This guy, a junkie? Have you met him?” the doctor said, voice incredulous and Sherlock wanted to simultaneously bury himself in the proverbial sand and yell at the top of his lungs.
“You’re going on a date tonight,” he deduced, a glint in his eye.
“No,” Sherlock nearly whispered. “For the flowers.”
The first one was odd, the second one made him pause, and the third phone ringing couldn’t be ignored. He answered it, somewhat perplexed and more than a bit intrigued. A voice on the other end of the line made a show of control by manipulating a CCTV camera on the corner of the street. A black car pulled up as he was instructed to get inside the vehicle.
John sighed dramatically. “Fine, I’ll tell her. You’re putting the sunscreen on her, though,” John decreed and then kicked his foot in the surf, splashing the bottom half of Sherlock’s legs.
“Coffee?” He asks, and Sherlock looks at him questioningly.
“Like what? I’m a gay man, John, I’m not ashamed of that,” Sherlock replied indignantly.
“You’re a clever man. You can wrap and talk at the same time.”
“Bored.”
John tossed his pillow and duvet down and finished getting ready for bed. After brushing his teeth he came back to the couch, placing his pillow exactly so before he laid down and pulled his duvet around him. Shifting his body to a more comfortable position, he frowned as he caught sight of the still barely decorated tree. He hadn’t bothered bringing down the box of ornaments that he and Sherlock had used their first and last Christmas together. He hadn’t used them last year, either. They were all Sherlock’s, anyway. Ornaments from his youth, Sherlock had told him, that his mother had given him the day he moved out. John had been impressed that he had managed to hold on to them considering Sherlock’s past. He had briefly considered contacting Mycroft for him to collect them when he had found the box the year before, but quickly decided against it. The slimy bastard would likely have binned them, and John couldn’t stand the thought of Sherlock’s belongings being lost or destroyed.
Oh, but wait. He hadn’t stepped away. John’s hands came up to cup Sherlock’s face, his thumbs smearing the salty tears from his eyes and cheeks, which had the unfortunate side effect of causing more tears to fall.
“He’s green, John.”
“Sherlock helped me find a pretty flower for him!” she added. “A lily.”
The air was bitterly cold as John made his way to the Tesco after his shift at the clinic. If he hadn’t promised Mrs. Hudson he would pick up a few things for her that morning, he wouldn’t have bothered, but he had so now he felt obligated to not put it off just because he was tired and it was cold out.
John’s jaw fell open as Sherlock spoke, his mind spinning under the flood of Sherlock’s affection. Sherlock walked up to the side of the bed and sat down beside John, one long leg pulled up in front of him, his knee pressing into John’s thigh. Heat bloomed from that simple point of contact and spread through John’s body like wildfire.
“Those she definitely mentioned twenty times,” Sherlock said and John grinned.
“True. Missed opportunity, there. Never thought to consider you might be sweets motivated,” John grinned.
“Knew what?” he asked, confused by the statement and the sudden decision to talk about Molly after all.
When he was finally fully inside him, both of them breathing hard, John stilled to allow him to adjust. John’s breath was hot on his neck where he kissed him. Sherlock’s arms were wrapped tightly around him.
John’s brows shot up in surprise before he started to shake his head. “No, Sherlock. God, no. You didn’t make me uncomfortable. I know you love Rosie. She needs to hear it. It’s important she knows that the people she loves love her back. I’m sorry if I’ve ever made you feel like you shouldn’t express that to her.”
Mrs. Hudson came to join Sherlock on the couch and Rosie included her in her excitement. Mrs. Hudson ooh’d and aah’d at all the appropriate places and John took the moment to just observe the somewhat unorthodox family he had managed to build for himself. He finished his tea while Rosie unwrapped the other few gifts they had given her and was just putting down his cup when Mrs. Hudson suddenly screamed. John hurt his neck snapping it back towards her in surprise.
Sherlock blinked and opened his mouth, then shut it again. John patted the empty spot of mattress beside him.
Sherlock leaned towards him across the table. “John, I…” he started, but Rosie had chosen that moment to run back into the room, and John wasn’t sure if he was grateful for her timing or not.
Joy wandered in from the kitchen and John watched as Sherlock’s eyes locked on her as she crossed over to her bed beside John’s chair and laid down. Sherlock’s eyes shifted up to John, then, and John refused to look away as he sipped his tea.
“Bed?” he asks, breaking the kiss just enough to let out the single word, and Sherlock answers with a press of his hips into John’s body, and John’s brain temporarily stops at the feel of Sherlock’s arousal against him.
“You used to be better at following me without me realizing it. I thought you wouldn’t bother with that anymore.”
“I realized I’ve been in love with you since the moment I thought I'd lose you.”
He hadn’t expected Sherlock to follow him in. Not today. He felt another flash of anger and frustration, but he kept silent in the shower. Waited for the man to say something. When nothing came, he let out an irritated huff of breath, and finally reached for his shampoo and washed his hair, raked his fingers against his scalp so hard it almost hurt. Rinsed it off. Then he got his soap and started to wash his skin. Scrubbed the loofah hard enough against his skin to make the skin red as the blood rushed up at the onslaught.
“Well, it is her favourite,” Sherlock stated, the obviously heavily implied, and John just shook his head in mild exasperation, and perhaps more than a small amount of fondness. They walked quietly the rest of the way to Baker Street.
Sentiment, again.
Perhaps a tea cozy.
It was more than that, too.
“Yes, but he’s here now,” John says, and then gestures to the bench along the wall. “Have a seat.” It’s more a question, an invitation, than a statement, and he watches as Sherlock looks at him again, then the table and John hadn’t realized he had been holding his breath until Sherlock gives a small nod and steps around him to sit at the offered spot, and he takes in a gulp of air to soothe his burning lungs.
Sherlock felt a blush rise to his face at the praise. He was used to John praising his deductive abilities, but this was very different. He was never praised for anything physical. It was always his mind. He rather liked the change and was fascinated by his body’s reaction to it, though he didn’t have long to ponder on it, as a moment after John spoke, he leaned forward and licked a scorching stripe up the underside of his cock from root to tip, his tongue flickering over the tip to taste him. Sherlock’s head fell back as he bit back a groan. John’s mouth closed over him, sucking lightly, and Sherlock’s hands flew to the doctor’s head, holding him carefully. John took that as encouragement and took in more, his cheeks hollowed as he sucked while one hand came up to fondle him. Sherlock forced his hips to remain still as John licked and sucked and Sherlock felt his orgasm approach far faster than he wanted it to and he pushed John back, not ready for this to end.
Again her eyebrows shot up. “‘Can’t complain?’” she teased, and Sherlock huffed. She smiled. “How’s John?” she asked after a moment passed in silence.
When John left for his shift at the clinic that morning it was to the music of the violin and when he returned that evening he was welcomed home by that same music. John didn’t bother to hide the small smile that pulled at his mouth as he walked into the flat. He supposed Sherlock hadn’t had much time for playing. His violin had been here while he was away, for one thing, and from what he had described of his time destroying Moriarity’s web, it wasn’t exactly ideal music-playing conditions. Artistic expression had been understandably diminished. He must have missed it and John could understand if he wanted to play for hours on end.
“Yeah,” John confirmed, turning back to his meal as he only had so long to enjoy his lunch, after all.
“Find a home for Ice Cream?” John asked as he settled into an empty chair across from Sherlock.
“No, in the film. The actor that plays a pornography actor.”
Sherlock’s thumbs swept over John’s cheekbones as they continued to gaze at each other.
“Just try to not jump in the mud!” he called out through the open door, but he knew even as he said it that it was a lost cause.
“You were going to take that damn pill, weren’t you?”
John cut his eyes at Sherlock and grinned. “Charming.”
“No, but still. She’s injured, as well. I’ll need to take her to a vet.”
“No, thank you. I would take a cup of tea, though,” he said and his smile widened when he heard the rattle of china and the tea tray. He crossed over to the desk and grabbed the laptop, then went to his chair and slumped down on it. With the laptop balanced atop his knees, he opened the lid and woke it up with a few quick taps.  “Would you like to join me?”
He made his way from the kitchen back into the living room, brushing the crumbs from his shirt, and over to the cold fireplace. He fiddled with the logs and kindling for a few moments before he finally coaxed the wood to catch and properly burn. The heat wasn’t instantaneous, but he could already feel the immediate area around the fireplace as the flames licked higher grow warmer. By the time his food was delivered, the living room had managed a slow climb up a few degrees higher. Not warm, by any means, but no longer frigid.
John had nearly jumped in response. He denied that his intentions were to ask Sherlock out. He had looked panicked as he tripped over his words to assert that Sherlock had misread the conversation. “It’s all fine.”
He wasn’t comfortable completely removing them, so instead, he simply made room for his own bouquet to join the one already there.
“Here you go.”
The man’s head tilted slightly as he looked at John, a hint of something almost like approval on his features before his face went still again.
“Do you really think so?”
“Want to see how many fantasies we can make a reality?” Sherlock asked with a raised brow and John smiled.
He wished her goodnight, then closed the door behind him as she settled onto her couch to tend to her hip medication.
“Yes, Doctor.”
John watched him a moment, then gave himself a mental shrug and grabbed Rosie’s waiting hand and they made their way to the water. Rosie gripped his hand and pulled him into the crashing waves without a moment of acclimating to the cool of the water compared to the warm air that caressed their skin. When Rosie was up to her waist, John pulled her up to his hip and walked out until the water hit just below his ribs. Rosie slammed her hands down into the salty water and giggled in delight at the spray. They played in the water, John jumping up occasionally for the water to buoy them over the top of cresting waves, Rosie smiling and laughing the whole time. After several minutes Sherlock appeared at their side, Rosie reaching for him with her small arms, and John released her to him. Her small arms went directly around his neck and Sherlock placed an absent-minded kiss to her temple.
John jolted up out of bed and was down the stairs before the cloud of pink smoke had managed to escape the kitchen.
“Right. So you’re unattached, like me. Good,” John said, then licked his lips before he turned back to his food.
“Just as you left lilies and carnations. The baby’s breaths and the roses and chrysanthemums. All the flowers you’ve left for me.”
“As you wish.”
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him and John grinned.
He watched as she made her way through the door, one little fist held high, and a triumphant smile on her face. “Look what I found, Daddy!”
No matter. John was ready and willing to wait for the rest of the evening if need be. Glancing at his phone, he quickly unlocked it and read over the three missed, or rather ignored, texts. It appeared Sherlock was back to taking cases when John had a date. There was even a missed phone call, but no voicemail left. If Sherlock really needed him for this “case”, he would have left a message. He didn’t need to worry about Sherlock getting himself in trouble then. Ok, good. He told himself that was a good thing and slid his phone back into his trouser pocket when the server came over to check if he needed anything. He shook his head, but the server came back a few moments later with a fresh candle for the table and John thanked him.
“I’m good. I’m seeing someone,” she smiled shyly, a faint blush ghosting over her cheeks. It must be somewhat serious, then.
He grabbed the duvet from the floor before he climbed into the bed and pulled it over them. Sherlock turned to face him with an impish grin.
“No sense in wasting a perfectly good wine,” Sherlock stated without looking up.
“You know, I’m actually not that fond of chocolate ice cream,” Sherlock mentioned. “I prefer-.”
There was a bag in the fridge that he had not put there. A bag he would have never put in his fridge, ever. A bag of something that used to belong to a someone, or several someone’s, judging by the contents that he really didn’t want to examine too closely as he finally reached around the offending bag and grabbed the container of mushrooms that was behind it. He pulled out the butter and parmesan, as well, because he didn’t want to open the fridge again any time soon.
Well.
“You mean that, don’t you?”
“Sherlock, I’m going to have to pass on the flat. It’s been quite an interesting day and while I’ll admit that I’ve enjoyed parts of it, and meeting you, I,” he began, but his phone buzzed in his hand and Sherlock jumped up from his spot on the couch.
Sherlock ranted and the DI, Lestrade, ranted back. A drugs bust, he called it. John was thrown by the accusation, and then thrown again when he realized that it wasn’t exactly an unfounded attack on Sherlock’s character. The consulting detective seemed distressed by the events. Not out of fear of being caught with anything, but almost from embarrassment. John had a suspicion that Sherlock would much rather John had never known any of this past behavior he once indulged in.
Yet he knew deep in his bones he wouldn’t betray the man even if he did. There was something magnetic about Sherlock, and John was drawn to him in spite of himself.
Then Sherlock came into his life and everything changed again. That change, however, had been a healing balm to his tired mind and soul. Sherlock changed everything with his quick wit, clever deductions, and whirling Belstaff. Now he sat in the back of a taxi with that bewildering man heading to a place that had felt more like home than any other place ever had, and that was before he even lived there.
“Yes, of course, I’m serious. Do you know how much faster I have solved cases since meeting you? An average of 38% faster. That time has proved critical in several circumstances.”
“There are rooftop hives in lots of cities now, but I imagine it would be easier in the countryside.”
When Mary took off with the AGRA flash drive, leaving John with an infant and a letter, he knew she would not be coming back. She never did. He knew Sherlock had Mycroft look into her whereabouts or any sign of what might have happened to her.
Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, looked flustered at the sudden turn in the conversation and tossed her hands in the air. “I’m going back to my flat so you two can have your little domestic in private. Don’t be too loud dears,” she proclaimed as she headed out the door and down the stairs. John watched after her for a moment before turning back to Sherlock.
Ah! Billy was missing. He went to the bedroom he had claimed as his own and rummaged around in one of the few unpacked boxes left there until he pulled out the familiar skull. He carried it into the sitting room and placed it on the left corner of the mantelpiece. Billy grinned at him in approval of his new spot and Sherlock smiled. Perfect.
“When you’re loved. Shouldn’t you be told? To know that you’re important to someone?” Sherlock asked. His eyes were on his hands, twisting on themselves in his lap.
John brought his elbows up on the table and leaned his head down into his hands as he stared at the tabletop. So, it wasn’t just them. It was John, too. John was the liability. John was the cause. He choked off a bitter laugh. Of course, he would be the cause of his own heartache. Everything was always his fault. He was filled with dismay, but honestly, it just felt like most days of his life.
Sherlock stepped closer and bent down to kiss her cheek, but she shook her head again.
before she finally passed out.”
A large, warm hand enclosed over his bicep, and John felt his pulse quicken at the simple touch. A gentle tug and John abandoned his cleaning, knowing already that he was going with Sherlock, and that all of his consternation was only for show. They both knew it. He glanced at his date, her face now switching to affronted disbelief. He was left apologizing quickly over his shoulder as Sherlock practically dragged him down the stairs and out of the cinema.
“Yes, I know exactly who that is,” Sherlock informed him, eyes narrowed as he approached his brother. “What are you doing here?” he asked.
“Because I needed to take a step back. Because you were dead, and now you’re not, and I don’t know how to deal with that every moment of the day. Because you saw my flowers and knew what they meant and I have no idea what that means for me or for you. Because I was given a miracle when I had stopped believing in them.”
John contemplated ignoring the feeling and was torn on whether he wanted Sherlock to take a hint and leave him alone, or whether he wanted him to reach out and make some kind of statement.
Greg took a sip of his tea, then cleared his throat.
“She just seems very happy for a dog that was found on the street with a sprained leg. So, yes. Joy.”
Instead, he forced himself to stick to more practical matters, and he couldn’t help the hopeful tone his voice took.
He watched as Sherlock’s eyes roved quickly over the room.
Sherlock started to turn and when John didn’t stop him, he finished turning to look at his friend who had his face down and away from him.
Sherlock looked at him, likely reading all of his thoughts, and he frowned slightly. John turned his eyes to Rosie, who was oblivious to the scars under her palms, and silently vowed to himself that he would do whatever he needed to do to show Sherlock that he was not his scars. They told a part of his story, but they were not his whole story. Like the sea glass they had found. It looked different than it was before, frosted and textured instead of clear and smooth, but it was still glass.
. Fuck me, keep going,” Sherlock said, his voice wreaked, but just as demanding. “Such a good soldier following orders. Are you ready to come?”
How had he missed this? Or did he? Had he somehow known all along without even realizing he knew? Is that why everything was the way it was before John had announced it so clearly? Was this just a confirmation of the information he knew without utilizing it?
But Sherlock had pulled him back to shore. He had taken John and Rosie in, made them his family, and made no demands on either of them.
Another message pinged before he got a chance to reply.
John smirked and shook his head, and Sherlock counted it as a win.
And what a chase it was! The madman seemed to have a mental map of London in his head, both the streets and the buildings, as he had them climbing fire escapes to run across rooftops and jump across gaps. The whole time Sherlock kept calling to him and encouraged him to keep up. It filled John with an indescribable joy and pride that he was not being forgotten and that Sherlock seemed to actually want him there.
“So what’s the case?” he asked, and Sherlock finally looked at him as they stepped outside the doors and to the pavement outside the building. He approached the kerb and waved an arm, managing to snag a taxi in that way he almost always did.
He gently pulled his fingers out and Sherlock whined at the sudden emptiness. John slicked more lube onto his cock as he watched Sherlock’s hole clench around air, just waiting for him to fill him. He looked back up to Sherlock.
“I did. Solved three cases this morning. Dull.”
Rosie’s eyes went completely round and wide at the possibility of chocolate ice cream and she stamped her feet excitedly.
He let himself imagine reaching forward with his foot and rubbing it against the high arch of Sherlock’s instep. Just a brush of bare skin. He could practically feel his skin thrumming at the imagined sensation and didn’t bother repressing the delightful shiver that ran through him. It would take very little effort for him to lean forward, to fall to his knees between the vee of Sherlock’s splayed legs and let his hands trace up those long limbs, up the calves and firm thighs. Or maybe he could stand up, place his hand down on the arms of Sherlock’s chair, let his knee rest between those long legs instead, and take Sherlock’s gorgeous lips with his own.
“Hm?”
John looked up at his friend. Took in all the features of that beautiful and beloved face. The dark brows, the sharp cheekbones, the perfect Cupid’s bow of his mouth, and those ever changing eyes. They were flashing silver at the moment.
It was past midnight when Sherlock finally returned to 221B. He had wandered around London aimlessly during the hours he had been gone. His mind kept offering up imagined scenarios of what had happened between John and Alex after he had left. Alex would have confirmed that he wasn’t attached to anyone and John would have asked him to dinner or maybe to get drinks. Maybe at a future date, but maybe that very night. It had been early enough that they could have gone out then. Or perhaps they didn’t go out. They had a previous sexual relationship. Perhaps they had gone straight to John’s room. Or Alex had taken John back to his flat. Sherlock’s brain was more than happy to provide all manner of imagery for that scenario and for once he cursed his Mind Palace and its ability to provide all the details that he hadn’t yet had time to delete. These new images would be deleted as soon as he got a moment to go through them all.
“You needed to write it down if you wanted me to follow it.”
“We need to go back to the crime scene so I can check the mud there. There’s something in the sample from the victim that I can’t figure out…”
Sherlock sat still a moment before he leaned forward and put his hand out. “Deal,” he said.
“Since when do you think of nothing in particular? You’re always thinking. Usually about very specific things.”
He let the robe fall from his shoulders and pool on the floor before reaching over to turn the taps off and stepped carefully into the hot water. The temperature was perfect, almost too hot to handle, and he could feel the blush that crept over his skin as the heat of the water warmed him, his muscles relaxing, his nerves uncoiling. He let himself sink into the tub, his knees popping up out of the water and into the warm air of the little room as he let his shoulders be submerged.
“Because I didn’t want to date other men, Sherlock. I wanted to date you,” John confessed as he remained facing away from him.
“I’m sorry, John,” he uttered quietly. And he was. It wasn’t a big lie. A small one, barely worth even calling a lie, but denying he had returned apparently qualified as a lie to John Watson, and they had promised no more lies.
They were silent for several minutes while Sherlock’s mind continued to run scenarios and he tried to convince himself that taking the chance his heart was telling him to take was too dangerous. But then, wasn’t that a part of what made their relationship work? The danger and the thrill. He looked over at John as they sat beside each other. Took in the profile of the doctor and soldier that had walked into the lab at Barts and slotted so quickly and easily into the Work and into his life.
The cottage was postcard-perfect in that quaint quintessentially English countryside way. There was a garden bursting with life and color that surrounded the entirety of the whitewashed walls. Wisteria trees, lavender, and other flowers John couldn't identify were home to a variety of butterflies, songbirds, and bees. They all blended together with the scent of the sea that he couldn’t see, but knew was there. John breathed in deeply as muscles he hadn’t realized were tense began to relax.
“I’ve always belonged to you,” Sherlock confessed quietly.
He hooked a leg over John and flipped them so that he was on top. The image of John smiling up at him, his upper body and his cheeks flushed with his arousal, was instantly catalogued, put in a frame, and placed on a pedestal in his Mind Palace without any conscious decision on his part. This John was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen, and he was the reason why he was smiling like that, and Sherlock had to taste it. John hummed his approval at the kiss, then groaned when Sherlock rolled his hips against him.
He made his way through a side entrance and down to the morgue in search of Molly. There was no body for him to look at, of course, but he did think it would be a good idea for him to be seen here by someone on the off chance John ever asked anyone about the case he made up.
“When?”
“Shall I go on?”
He forced his feet forward, ignoring the strange twist in his chest at the sight of his dog completely comfortable and relaxed on the man that had once held John’s heart in his hands without knowing it. John also ignored that he very much still held it in his hands, still unknowingly, and he didn’t imagine that would ever change. John didn’t think he could let himself let it change.
A bath would have been preferable, but he hadn't felt like waiting for the tub to fill. Instead he stood under the hot beating spray of the shower, his body automatically going through the motions of washing his hair and cleaning his skin. His thoughts swirled, and he was grateful they didn’t land on anything in particular. Just circled, lazily, and without purpose. Normally that kind of thoughtless thinking would bother him, but at the moment he needed it. Needed to not really think.
“She went through a lot of trouble for just a weekend,” he chuckled and Sherlock smiled at him for a moment before he walked back out of the room and towards the end of the hallway.
“John,” he began, that rich baritone pouring out like honey into John’s ears, and he waited for what would be said next, but Sherlock stopped talking. John waited, but still, he said nothing. He watched as his friend suddenly began pacing back and forth across the worn rug in front of the fire, unbuttoning his jacket and tossing it on the couch, his hands then raking through the drying curls atop his head, and John is completely mesmerized at his friend’s seeming agitation.
The silver-haired man was immersed in conversation with one of his techs, someone Sherlock didn’t know, and he sent the woman away when he spotted Sherlock. He gave him a friendly nod, his eyes scanning behind Sherlock for a short, blond doctor that wasn’t there.
He dreamed of shimmering water in a darkened pool and woke with the smell of chlorine still in the air. He dreamed of circus assassins and bomb vests and a man with dead eyes.
“One of his sonnets. Sonnet 116, to be precise. A small part of it, anyway.”
The ceremony took place the next day. Just a few friends and family were invited. Mrs. Hudson, Greg, Molly, Mike, Harry, Mycroft, Sherlock’s parents. And Rosie, of course. She was dressed in light blue and threw flower petals along the sand. They didn’t walk down an aisle, but Rosie had to throw petals, or she wasn’t a ‘real flowergirl for Daddy and Papa’s wedding’. When they made their vows she stood beside them because neither had the heart to ask her to sit down. After a small reception with drinks and a meal, everyone parted. Rosie went with Mrs. Hudson after a tearful goodbye, but when ice cream was promised, her tears quickly went away.
“Which leads us to the who. Who are you thinking about? Anyone in particular, or a random stranger, or no one at all? Just a fantasy, perhaps.”
Sherlock leaned into the leather seat back and let out a sigh. “It doesn’t matter,” he replied.
Sherlock spun to face him so quickly from where he had just tossed his coat on the leather sofa that his curls bounced across his forehead.
“Blueberry, Watson,” Sherlock informed her and she pouted for a moment before smiling.
Three careful strides placed him right in front of John. He wasn’t completely in his personal space, but he was on the edge of being closer than strictly necessary. John watched him carefully.
“That’s not what people normally say.”
“That doesn’t mean anything,” she dismissed with a wave of her hand. “You will be having a ceremony, though? With a cake after?”
He wasn’t sure when the conversations that took place there began to change. Sometime after the "Incident", for sure. It had been gradual, he knew that, but no specific fixed point stood out in his mind. It used to only be about cases or that rather ridiculous time with the milk. Slowly, though, it evolved into more. John would be showering, and suddenly Sherlock would be there in the room discussing the results of his latest experiment, or what he hoped his next one would accomplish.
“Do you trust me, John?”
“Yeah, okay. That sounds nice.”
That could work.
“I think they call it ‘hangry’,” John replied.
“Look at that, I think you’re right.”
The rain was cold on the exposed skin of his face and hands, but he kept walking instead of hailing a cab. The coffee helped keep his body warm as he took occasional sips, and the chilly rain hitting his face helped him think of anything other than what he wanted to be thinking about.
When he got back to 221, he stopped off at Mrs. Hudson’s to drop off the purchases he made for her, and she thanked him with an invitation for tea, which he declined. She then offered one of her herbal soothers, which he also declined with a barely contained huff of laughter, and she finally let him leave with another plate of freshly baked biscuits.
“Yes, I’m fine,” he said automatically and ate a spoonful of the hot soup without somehow burning his tongue.
John laughed at the green antlers sticking out of his dark curls.
Joy whined at being stuck, causing John to blink into action to remove her leash, and Greg to look up. He stood as soon as he saw John. He put the teacup down on the table before looking back to John, then his eyes flicked down to Joy with a surprised raise of his eyebrows.
“Well, it will be infinitely easier keeping you alive if I just go ahead and live there,” John replied after a moment of silent contemplation.
A warm palm on his shoulder had him opening his eyes and John offered him a smile and a cup of tea. Sherlock accepted them both, though he couldn’t return the smile. He took a sip of the tea, which had cooled almost too much, but it was sweet and perfectly brewed, and reminded him of easier days and weeks and he finished it before he was ready for it to be over.
John paused, his brain taking a moment to process Sherlock’s words before he started after him again.
They fell back into a comfortable silence. After about ten minutes, their taxi pulled up to John’s address, and they climbed out after John tossed him the fare. They made their way up to the bedsit, and Sherlock followed John inside.
“I was a doctor,” John corrected him quickly.
John sighed and shook his head. “Mrs. Hudson.”
Suddenly, Sherlock’s warm hand closed over John’s ankle and he yelped loudly as his foot started to slide.
“Would you?” Sherlock asked, one brow arching up, which John found impressive considering how much alcohol they had managed to consume in the last three hours.
Mrs. Hudson laughed before turning back to the men and her meal.
And now Sherlock agreed to marry him. Wanted to marry him. He was so happy that he couldn’t stop the smile that grew on his face, effectively breaking the kiss as it turned more into teeth than lips.
He focused on his breathing as he walked. Forced himself to take long breaths in, then slow breaths out. Then several quick breaths followed once more by the long and slow. His thoughts circled, but he refused to let his mind settle on any particular one.
“Is it even worth going for ‘truth’? You probably know all the answers to whatever you would ask anyway.”
Mrs. Hudson smiled, patted his knee again, and turned her attention to the telly as well as she turned up the volume. She handed him a biscuit and he bit into it, chocolate this time, and leaned back into the soft cushions as the scent of vanilla and sugar settled around them.
The cabbie nodded and fell blessedly silent after that. Sherlock watched London blur past the window as his thoughts raced themselves. The restaurant had looked a bit busy when they had stepped up. Were John and Alex talking now? Had they managed to get a table or were they still waiting? Were they flirting, getting to know each other again, sharing lingering looks and not-so-casual touches? Was that smile on John’s face?
John shook his head with a wry smile. “Thought I saw you, but I guess it was just someone who looked like you,” he lied.
Mrs. Hudson smiled sadly at him when he was gone to who knew where.
“Not in words, no,” Sherlock agreed with a small quirk of his lips, and John couldn’t help the soft laugh that bubbled up, and Sherlock joined him with a small chuckle of his own.
Sherlock watched him leave, listened to the sound of his steps as he climbed the stairs to his room, then the creak and click of the door as it shut behind him.
“Helping you, obviously,” Sherlock said.
They went that way the rest of the short walk to the ice cream shoppe. Sherlock shortened his stride to match John’s, and both men let the little girl between them swing to her heart’s content.
Rosie bounced from one topic to the next as they ate, while John and Sherlock attempted to keep up with the endless thread of conversation that she steered them through. When she was finished eating, she asked to be excused to go out to play in the garden and since the rain had yet to return, John agreed. She ran out the door before he could remind her to put on shoes.
A coffee shop might not be the fanciest place for a first date, but he knew she enjoyed coffee, and it seemed like a great choice for an afternoon date. John didn’t want to start anywhere too serious, such as a dinner date, seeing as they worked together. This could, if needed, be passed off as just two coworkers getting coffee together.
“You’re thinking about sex,” Sherlock stated, confident and sure.
“Not all of them,” Sherlock replied with a one armed shrug as he took a sip from the amber liquid in his glass.
The microscope had been switched on and off several times, slides placed and then removed. New slides were placed and quickly removed as he turned the machine off again. His violin was lifted and put down after a handful of notes that grated on his ears. Nails scratched at his skin, red stripes following in the wake of his fingers, but they brought no relief.
“Who else knows that you’re back?”
John stared at the DVD in silence before Greg cleared his throat again.
The bastard hadn’t even bothered to show up at his own brother’s funeral. There was nothing that John could possibly want to hear from him. He would be perfectly content to never see him again.
“I’m glad,” he replied sincerely.
“You two need to talk with actual words and not whatever strange dance it is you currently communicate through. It’s not enough.”
“Not at all. I need you there before to talk to. To bounce ideas off of.”
He pushes himself off the door and meets Sherlock’s mouth in a kiss as they attempt to navigate their flat to the closest bedroom, Sherlock’s, without detaching. They don’t make it far before John knocks his foot into a table, sending newspapers scattering to the floor, and he pulls back from the kiss with a swear for his aching toes. Their eyes meet and John can’t help the bubble of laughter that rises out of him as he clutches his foot while standing on the other, and then they’re both laughing.
“This is going to need stitches,” John announced, still frowning. He turned to the kit beside him and pulled out the necessary supplies. “All I have is topical anesthesia. It only needs a couple of stitches, though. Think you can sit still for that?” he asked, looking back up at him from his kit.
Something was calming about the position, with his legs up and resting against the bed, his back on the solid ground beneath him. He was able to breathe easier for a moment. Something about being inverted like that forced him to center himself and he drew in a long, shaky breath, feeling his chest expand, before letting it out. He shifted, felt the pull of scars against his back. A physical reminder of just one of his many failures.
John turned to look at Rosie, who had wandered over a few meters away from where they stood. He turned back to Sherlock who held up the bag in smug satisfaction at having thought of bringing food when it was obvious that John had not.
“Something cold will do,” he said, then swept out of the room without a backward glance.
Mouths opened and tongues explored recklessly after a clash of teeth. It was messy and hungry and Sherlock wanted more. John tasted of tea and milk, smelled of his woolen jumpers, and the hint of the oil he used to clean his gun, and Sherlock was surrounded by him as John moved his hands from his jacket to wrap around his back, and pulled him in until their bodies were flush together.
“Girlfriend? Not really my area,” Sherlock responded and John tried to ignore the stutter in his heart at that.
John groaned into his pillow as her small body bounded onto the mattress, bouncing wildly between the small space left between him and Sherlock, and sang some version of Santa Claus is Coming to Town with her own choice of lyrics.
She could hardly believe what she saw on Sherlock’s fingers earlier and the all too brief conversation they had had about the exciting turn of events. They hadn’t even told her how John proposed yet! She was sure it was terribly romantic, but they hadn’t said a word. No matter. She’d get it out of them at dinner, she was sure.
Sherlock frowned up at the ceiling as he laid on the sofa, fingers steepled under his chin. The past 48 hours had been far more interesting than he would have expected when Mike had first walked into the lab with an old friend. At best he had been hoping for a flatmate to merely share rent and space with. To ignore and merely coexist. He had not been expecting a small ex-army doctor with a danger complex to come strolling in. Someone who he could share the Work with. Someone who would want to share in the Work. And he was sure that John was interested in the Work. That was obvious. The sudden disappearance of his limp and need for his cane was proof enough of that.
“That’s brilliant,” John declared, and Sherlock paused a moment before his brain caught up with his mouth again, and he continued.
Rosie rounded on him instantly. “Please, Daddy? Please can we have chocolate ice cream?” she begged, eyes pleading and her small fists held together under her chin, little fingers crushing the muffin that was still held in them.
“Not quite,” he said, and tugged John’s jumper swiftly over his head, followed by his vest, then trousers and pants.
John looked at him, at the beautiful man stretched out atop the sheets. He was flushed pink from his cheeks to his upper chest, and John wanted to just look and admire him, but Sherlock wanted him to fuck him, and John’s cock was done being ignored.
He decided to not mention that he could just walk upstairs and get his pyjamas. He would come back down if Sherlock wanted him to. Instead, he reached for the clothes provided and slipped them on. The bottoms were too long, but the shirt fit surprisingly well. He looked up and saw Sherlock had finished dressing and was back in the loo brushing his teeth. John followed him in there, stood beside him as he readied his toothbrush, and scrubbed his teeth clean. Their eyes kept meeting their reflections in the mirror, and they smiled around their toothbrushes. When they were done and made their way back into Sherlock’s room, John didn’t hesitate but pulled the duvet and sheets back before he climbed right into the large bed. He settled down on his side and watched Sherlock as he got in beside him. They laid down facing each other, and John pulled the bedding up around their bodies, cocooning them in the warmth of the soft cotton, their bodies pressed gently together, and the humidity from the shower being dispersed by the open loo door into the bedroom.
“He can, but I think he's tired of being alone.”
_____
He was fairly positive he hadn’t been the one to put them there, and when he noticed the plate of shortbread biscuits on the table, it was all the confirmation he needed to know who did. He knew Mrs. Hudson’s perfect shortbread on sight.
“Would you like to sit in the garden? The rain seems to have moved off. There weren’t many clouds left when Rosie and I came back earlier,” Sherlock said, and there was something in his voice that John couldn’t quite describe. He was tempted to call it reservedness, but that didn’t make any sense when used to describe much of anything Sherlock did.
They walked into the flat at Baker Street, pulling off coats and hanging them on hooks, before collapsing against the wall. John giggled, and he couldn’t hold back a responding chuckle at the delighted sound. A knock at the door interrupted their laughter and Sherlock grinned.
They sat in a somewhat comfortable silence as they waited for Angelo to return with the wine, which he did after a minute or so. He poured them both a glass with an impressive flourish and then left them alone with a wink and a sly grin. John bit back his groan at that. He hadn’t exactly missed the innuendos, but there was nothing to be done.
This chapter fought me all the way. It's not my favorite, but it'll have to do. Thanks for reading!
He shook those thoughts away as he filled the kettle with water for tea. He got down mugs and bags while the water heated up and tried to keep his thoughts from wandering too far again. He could just hear Sherlock as he settled Rosie down for her nap and her requests for the blanket to lay a certain way, the pillow to be fluffed to optimum fluffiness, her stuffed rabbit to be tucked in as well. John couldn’t decipher Sherlock’s deep baritone replies, but Rosie soon stopped her requests and he could hear the steady rhythm of the story as he began to read.
He managed about thirty minutes of conversations before the nurse made her way over to him again. He had never thought of flirting as being aggressive before, but there was no other way to describe the woman’s actions towards him. Which was odd, considering he wasn’t exactly the most sociable person in the room. Or the clinic. Or ever. But every time he shook her off for a few minutes, she seemed to come right back, stronger than before.
Ok. Good. This was good. He takes in another deep breath before returning to his seat, and it is at that moment that the owner of the establishment comes bustling to their table with a large, toothy grin on his face.
Then he stopped.
He wasn’t sure who said it first. Him or John. It didn’t matter. They pulled just far enough away to look into each other’s eyes. John’s smile was radiant as he looked up at Sherlock, a hand coming up to cup his jaw. Sherlock leaned down as John pushed up slightly onto his toes. Their mouths met somewhere in the middle, a sweet caress of lips and gentle exploration.
“I think that woman may be dangerous.”
“Well, you are a romantic,” Sherlock replied and leaned in for another sweet kiss.
“Smooth,” John laughs out, and Sherlock’s smile is radiant.
John’s eyes flickered to Sherlock who was biting down on his lips to hold back the smile that he could clearly see in his eyes.
John wanted. His body was alive with it, his heart beating heavy in his chest as the blood rushed through his veins and his skin tingled.
They woke early on Christmas morning. Rosie, by some unfortunate design, was an early riser, but the added stimulant of Christmas appeared to be too much for her to handle, and she woke even earlier than her usual six-thirty.
“I love you,” John said. Three small words that changed everything. That confirmed everything. That validated everything they had gone through to get to this point.
Sherlock grunted and mumbled something unintelligible under his breath while John tried his very best not to laugh.
“Don’t talk about the tattoo.”
“Cooking is just chemistry. And it helps when you have a cookbook,” he said as he turned his head to nod at the open cookbook on the counter. “Mrs. Hudson brought it up earlier.”
“No, Sherlock. No. Why did you do it? Why did you jump off that...how? How could you do that?” The
“That should be done in about 30 minutes. You have a good night, John.”
When she opened the door he gave a relieved smile and shifted the tray into both hands and felt much more confident that it wouldn’t fall.
“We’ve been questioning the grandson about anyone who might want to harm the woman. Perhaps an inheritance or a piece of jewelry. An argument, perhaps,” Lestrade said, and Sherlock barely managed to hold back his annoyed huff of breath and eye roll.
“Who’s Greg?”
Sherlock drew the bow down, pulling one long note that faded into the silent flat, and he put the instrument away with the same methodical precision and care as he always had. His head bowed, shoulders rounding inward slightly, before he turned, the mask that John always hated in place. He crossed over to his armchair, picked up the teacup, and took a sip.
“So get out of here and get them!” He yelled through the vinyl shower curtain, but the shadow of his flatmate didn’t move.
“I missed you,” John confided. Fingers stroking methodically.
He let out a soft laugh at himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
He knew it wasn’t maybe the most healthy thing to do, but he often found himself there when he had something on his mind and wanted to talk. Sherlock listened just as well in his grave as he did to John when he was alive. He figured it was only fair that he got to talk to Sherlock when he wasn’t there considering all the times Sherlock talked to him when he hadn’t been there. In some weird way, it seemed to work out in his head.
“No, it’s...fine,” he said, and John glanced up at him again.
While the water boiled, and then the tea left to steep, he took a moment to pull back the curtain covering the window. It looked out onto a small back alley. Nothing special or unique about it, but John liked it. There weren’t obvious signs of Christmas being a few days away, and he appreciated that. Luckily the room wasn’t in any way decorated, either. Well, not for Christmas, anyway. There were a few prints of paintings on the wall, just color blocking, but they looked nice in the room and gave a pleasant contrast to the white bedding.
“Mr. Campbell, thank you for meeting us,” Sherlock said. He noticed how John’s gaze turned sharply to him at that. He ignored him, and instead reached out his hand and the other man took it and shook it firmly.
Sherlock watched John as he worked, methodical and concise, folding and packing clothes, then books, then the small bathroom and the supplies within.
“Florist. Owed me a favor,” Sherlock replied so easily that John felt a giggle bubble up at the familiarity of that statement. Sherlock had always known someone who owed him a favor. Of course, he would know a florist who could get him flowers that no one else could find in December.
John turned to look at Sherlock, a smile he couldn’t hold back if he wanted to on his face. Fairy lights on the tree and the flames from the fire shifted shadows across the planes of Sherlock’s sharp features and John felt his chest tighten in affection for the man beside him.
John stared at Sherlock for several moments, his mind fuzzy and swirling at the question. Why not make the fantasy a reality? Well, several reasons. Reasons that were hard to remember when the object of said fantasies was sitting across from him, watching him with silver eyes that flashed with hat and that sharp intellect that enchanted John. Why not just lean forward and put a hand on his knee?
His eyes and mind wandered again, floating on alcohol and a low level of simmering arousal.
When he was finally able to leave after he finished his paperwork and wished the nursing staff a good evening with what little energy he had left, his headache had managed to magnify and wrapped around his head, squeezing his brain relentlessly. All he wanted was to get home as quickly as possible, pop a couple of paracetamol, and sleep until the next morning.
“Of course I mean it. I wouldn’t say it if I didn’t mean it.”
“How you feel,” she stated plainly.
“Where is this coming from?” John asked instead of answering.
“An enemy,” John repeated skeptically.
“Truth.”
Sherlock was about to reply with some snarky response, though he wasn’t sure why or for what reason he was being defensive, but a sneeze stole over him and exploded out before he could hold it back.
“I wanted to be a pirate when I grew up. I didn’t have any gold, but I knew all pirates needed treasure, and I thought sea glass would be as good a treasure as anything else. A shard of glass that had changed its appearance through its time in the ocean. Became something special despite starting off as something no one wanted,” Sherlock said and there was a touch of sadness in the way he explained it that broke something in John’s heart. Sherlock cleared his throat. “So I would come down every day and look for pieces. I collected several hundred over the years. They should be in the house somewhere unless Mummy did something with them.”
since his youth.
The door was open and Sherlock took in the man from his periphery as he hesitated on the threshold. Sherlock spoke out right before the man’s raised fist could knock his presence on the door frame.
Sherlock nodded in agreement but offered no reply. John’s right hand fidgeted with the knee of his trousers under the table as he tried to think of something, anything, to say.
John watched them head into the main part of the house before he turned to the refrigerator and pulled the door open, letting out a soft whistle when he did. Inside were several meals that looked ready to eat. A glance at the counter beside the fridge revealed a piece of paper that had a list of the meals and instructions on how to prepare them. Well. Sherlock’s mother seemed to think they would be staying for two weeks judging by the meals in here rather than 3 days. He shook his head with a chuckle, then pulled out what he thought were the chicken and vegetable wraps listed on the paper.
“So about that room?” Sherlock asked expectantly.
They both stood up, and John refilled each of their glasses to finish off the bottle of wine.
Sherlock was sorely tempted to demand John’s help (attention), but there really wasn’t anything he needed him for just then. And he had washed the dishes in his absentminded state so he couldn’t even get John to stay downstairs to spend time with him. Instead of answering he simply turned towards the sofa and threw himself on it dramatically. It wasn’t a proper strop of course, but Sherlock could be a fine actor when he wanted to be. He could practically hear the eye-roll John leveled at his back, then heard his actual footsteps as he walked away to his room upstairs.
John internally sighed as he put his fork down. He should have taken his food to his office rather than stay in the breakroom and be pulled into conversations that he didn’t want to get into with anyone, nevermind someone he hardly knew.
“So?”
“Tell me what your tattoo is.”
“I’ll be out in a minute,” he said and was surprised at how calm he managed to make his voice come out.
He quickly and politely bid his farewell to his date, promising that he’d see her Monday at work. Sherlock tapped his foot and made a show of checking the time on his mobile, deliberately ignoring the woman sitting across from John. John sighed quietly to himself as he rose, and his date smiled uncertainty as she agreed that she’d see him on Monday while her gaze kept flicking to the man standing at their table.
“We’ll have to be quiet. And get you cleaned up or Mrs. Hudson might well murder us in our sleep,” he informed the dog and she panted happily in his arms as they made their way home.
“I’ll tell you what. You think about the answer. If you come up with one and you still want me to kiss you tomorrow, then we can talk about it then.”
He even started to take liberties in what he was cooking. Sometimes, when he was feeling playful, he would add an extra spice that a recipe didn’t call for because he had used it in a different dish and thought the flavor would work well with the new meal. Sometimes that worked, and sometimes it didn’t, but he enjoyed taking the chance on those occasions when they worked out and it wasn’t completely awful when it didn’t because he could always order takeaway.
They were silent for a long time as they ate. The meal was absolutely exquisite and John couldn’t think of anything to say while they ate. Sherlock appeared equally unable to think of anything, and John began to worry that he had misread everything. Maybe Sherlock hadn’t been trying to ruin John’s dates out of any kind of romantic jealousy. Had he read everything wrong? It wasn’t like him to completely misread a situation like that, but this was Sherlock, and Sherlock was something entirely different.
John shook his head at the lie he told himself. He was already in love with him.
“You know what I mean.”
Ah, there it was, Sherlock thought. ‘I’ve read about you’ is clearly ‘I read Dr. Watson’s blog’, which would explain why he seemed to keep looking for the blogger.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. For how I treated you when you returned. For hurting you. I asked you for one more miracle, for me, and you gave it to me. You gave me that miracle and instead of thanking you for it, I hit you and pushed you away. I was a broken man, Sherlock, but that isn’t an excuse. And then with Mary, after Mary died…” Sherlock could hear John’s feet as they shuffled against the floor, the rustle of his jeans as he shifted his weight, the sliding of his cotton shirt as his hand went up to scratch the back of his neck as he so often did. “Sherlock, I am so incredibly sorry for what I did to you. There is no excuse. I don’t deserve your forgiveness for what I did.”
Sherlock turned back towards his doorway. Let his eyes focus on the corner of the window that he could see through the open doorway. John’s hand fell away from his back, but he stayed where he was. He heard John take a deep breath, then exhale slowly as he prepared to say whatever it was that he needed to say.
They continued to watch each other for several moments, just breathing, before John’s hand came up and tenderly caressed his face. His thumb traced just under his bottom lip and Sherlock caught it between his lips in a warm kiss before he released it.
They were in the middle of a serial murder investigation and he was trying to figure out why Rachel was significant. He didn’t have time to deal with meddling detectives, quietly judging ex-soldier doctors, his own convoluted feelings, eyeballs in the microwave, Mrs. Hudson’s nattering, and good god could everyone just shut up!
“Sherlock? You do realize that literally anyone could walk into this flat right off the street right now, right? Where are you?” John asked as he looked around for the taller man.
He wasn’t sure how much time passed as John stood there with his eyes still closed, but suddenly his quiet voice broke the silence.
