“They are,” Steve agreed, watching the water wash away the suds on the plain plate, scrubbing at the edges, “They’re all worth fighting for. And you’re right, I did spend five years wanting to save them.”
It wasn’t the end though and they arranged for a private gathering at the house in the woods a day later, where only those who knew both of them were called.
A pinprick brought up the drop of blood needed to activate his recognition for the orb and Steve held onto the handles of the steering as he felt the device activate.
It was a tag-along to the wildly jumbled ride that had been them getting together in the first place - they didn't really talk about the firsts. Steve knew that Tony remembered a few and Tony knew that Steve would remember those that he believed mattered most to Tony. Cosmo and Tumblr wouldn't give them an award but they worked.
Steve tried to recollect that last time he had seen Tony smiling. Was it before half of their world had evaporated into thin air? Before they had thrown away friendship to the Siberian bite? Before an airport?
“Just thought I’d drop all the bombs at one go,” he quipped cheerfully before turning to leave, telling Steve that Hank would be there in an hour to talk to him.
“The -,” Steve didn’t mean to but a laugh steeped in bitterness fell away, “Nat, we came away with ashes and a severed head. The end was pretty clear. We need to move on.”
Just as planned, Steve was walking into the lab exactly 70 seconds later and felt a moment of pride for his spy work. Natasha always teased him about being too obvious at it but he had managed things quite well so far. He spared a thought for Tony and pushed it away, reassuring himself that the man would be able to sneak or distract his way out of a situation if need sprang up. He had done it with Fury before. This shouldn't be worse.
"Astronomy nerd too?" Potts asked but Steve shared a look with Tony, who didn't stop the fond smile from showing as he remembered all the stargazing dates.
“That was one time and there was paint on – oh fine,” Steve moved his feet till there was enough space and Tony sat down with a satisfied grin, “Did you come here to complain about everything I make a fuss about or do you have another reason too?”
They were getting outnumbered and overpowered but they kept fighting, trying to keep the fighting contained to where they could control it.
“Sorry, force of habit,” he explained, remembering the last session with the group, “I’ve been telling people how we need to work towards a future and how we can move on. But it’s hard to forget a small fact.”
Now as Steve blinked his eyes open, his eyes fell on the bedside table and he saw that the new batch of film sat there outside its pack.
"Not me, at least he didn't intend to hunt me," Potts smiled wryly, "He was after my partner when this started, apparently he didn't like that we had messed-up time."
but it had been one of his quiet regrets that Tony hadn't been able to feel as comfortable with Howard as any son deserved to. He knew rationally that it was not in his control or past actions to have led anyone to that situation but logic rarely played a part in emotional guilt, something Steve had become intimately familiar with over the past few years.
“This isn’t you talking,” Natasha’s voice resounded like the tail-end of a whiplash, “Steve, you aren’t thinking straight if this is what you’re coming to.”
Steve stayed silent, letting Tony decide and brushed his shoulder against the man when he nodded, a silent gesture of support.
“Thank you,” Steve repeated in the driest tone he could muster before turning the envelope over in his hands, “But seriously, why?”
“Did you finally find the spare key then?” Steve asked and caught the dishtowel Tony threw at him without turning back, “Yes, I know. And now we have a wet towel, thank you for that.”
If he comes back any less alive, I'm going to burn this whole place down, he decided and made himself move for his own part of the mission.
"Me too," Steve whispered as he watched over Tony slowly descend into a trusting slumber, the longing to care finally fitting into the space of offered right. He'd remember this first, he mused, and the room glowed softly as the lights gave way to the sole nightlight from their bedside lamp.
. Last week Joe, the guy in my group who says he waited too long? Well, he said that line reminds him of his life of the past five years. It was a nice moment, he’s been in the group for a month now and this was his first hint of acceptance. That’s what I – I mean, I think that’s what it is. Everybody nodded and smiled sadly. There were a few tears too. But my eyes kept going to his hand that wouldn’t keep his phone down. We don’t have a rule about it, not really, but I couldn’t stop wanting to take it out of his hand and putting it down somewhere.”
It felt like a punishment somedays. He didn't know why she wouldn't see that or maybe she saw that and knew that he needed it too much. Maybe liars wouldn't survive the truth after too long.
The word lodged into his heart and Steve wanted to run. He couldn't love. Not now, not him. It was not - he couldn't - dammit.
Pepper pulled Peter off Tony quietly and Steve could feel the heat behind his eyes as she shakily called out to Friday. She had always been the most resilient of them, the one who hadn’t needed to fight with fists and weapons to be a hero, and now she held herself together as the man she loved looked on.
“At one point I even wondered if he Googled the song just to get an in to the conversation,” Steve shook his head, “Was I always this judgemental? I don’t know if I want an answer to that. Anyway, it reminded me of the time someone once tried to talk to Wanda about
“I’m the Cherry Knight,” Steve heard one day when he had returned from a two day trip to Vancouver. The voice was recognizable easily now, having heard stories and complaints and questions endlessly over the four years they had known the little blue-eyed firecracker.
“Is there a reason you’re,” Pepper paused to find the right word before gesturing to all of him, “a giant wet noodle?”
"Because of you, Rogers," Kang stared him down when Steve turned to face him, a distasteful expression creeping in, "Because you broke the laws of time and it was always for a Stark."
“We should go visit them,” Steve said an hour later, handing Tony a glass of water, sitting down beside him as he watched the man drink, “We can’t stay in New Jersey forever.”
"Did Natasha force you into it?" he asked and leaned back against the kitchen island, feeling himself calm down with every minute that Steve clearly grew nervous. He could
“I’ve got to finish some things,” he answered and there were half-truths thrown around everywhere but Natasha exhaled, nodded once and eyed his book with a quirk of her lips before turning away.
There was a crack along the corner of the ceiling, curved in its path and if you looked at it long enough it looked like an embedded alphabet. The light from the lamp played shadows on the wall and Steve wasn’t sure what letter was searching for.
Amid the flecks of white, there was a golden star falling, suspended in dying gravity and achingly beautiful to Steve's weary eyes. It was burning, reaching down for him to catch, like he could hold it in his palms and extinguish its flames. Like he could stop it from dying out.
They moved into a Manhattan apartment on a warm summer day in August and Tony signed up to work with SI as Steve joined duty as a SHIELD agent.
It had been a long time since they had helped each other directly and the idea of being late to restart that habit soured in his throat.
“Morgan and Pepper were fine,” Steve heard himself from a distance, the thoughts becoming clearer faster than his words could come out, “And you’d said – earlier you had said that you couldn’t risk –”
Differences and similarities only made the whole thing more interesting though, and Steve was sure about it, about this being the goal of a five step plan he hadn’t set out to make. This was the destination he had travelled through three lifetimes to reach.
“You ready?” Tony asked when Steve opened his door in the morning, still too early for the mission. He looked fresh; the dark jacket zipped up over a full sleeved t-shirt and face devoid of sunglasses. He had trimmed his beard, Steve noted, and it somehow made him want to smile seeing the enthusiasm that had been wary to come.
“Hearing that from you is surreal,” Steve offered but nodded at Bruce as they got closer, trying to keep his smile in place as Scott waved in his suit, “We’re ready?”
"Yours or mine?" he asked and turned around the main hallway, "Steve? I could really use a check-in now."
Steve stared at him in the dark, still able to make out the outline of his form and turned around on the bed to face Tony.
“If you don’t want me to throw up on your shoes, don’t ask me questions that’ll provoke it,” Nat replied through her teeth, smiling at Bruce when he looked back from a distance, “Come on, good vibes only.”
"It was a trick by Amora," Natasha flicked her gaze down to the tabletop for a second before meeting her question head-on, knowing well what weakness or hesitance could be mistaken for, "It was a simple miscalculation."
"You bastard," Steve spat out low to Kang, anger coursing through him because this was robbing Tony's life, ripping out his time through agonisingly deceitful mercy, "You have a problem with me, take it up with me. I broke time, I'm the one you want, right? Fight me, then."
Of all the things he had lost, the people he hadn’t known and had been friends with, the memories that weren’t his to know but were the only ones he could carry – of all of them, he had never truly let this one come to the surface. It didn’t matter, he had convinced himself, again and again over seven years. It couldn’t come back, he didn’t have it in him to ask for it and Tony had no necessity to volunteer. There was a world to adjust to, and then a world to save, and then a world to forget while a new one questioned its existence.
The focus is on the background and he can see the side profile of a woman in the front, probably close to the photographer. There’s a conversation between the woman and someone who was out of the frame, red t-shirt twisted in the movement. But the embossed words in the back, clean and simple in white over metal grey, they draw attention of the viewer and Steve traces his eyes over them.
When the WSC had come calling for explanations, she had stood up first, neatly coming in between them and Rogers. It wasn't because she doubted the Captain's ability to defend himself or his team. It was probably because she doubted if he would spare them any mercy. Steve had a reputation for being calm and collected but he also had a lesser-known temper that came up when his husband was concerned.
“Not from here?” Howard echoed, looking between them before staring at Tony, “I’m sorry pal, I don’t think I understand.”
“I’m gonna do what needs to be done right now, Tony,” Steve offered and turned to look at him, “That’s the best I’ve got for you.”
Tony eyed him for a minute, gradually calming down as they both fell silent and Steve could feel exhaustion sweep through him in a post-battle remembrance.
“It’s a beautiful home,” Steve said as Tony moved forward with him, Pepper talking to Nat behind them as Scott tried to downplay his restlessness while listening to Morgan describe her camp time. To anybody else it would be just another home in the woods, an ideal hearth of the withdrawn, but Steve could see it. The porch had an armchair that was vintage at first glance but it had the odd mix of comfortable seating with bizarre mosaic in muted green, the front of the house had panels with a minimum of five spots he could detect that could easily house security cameras that were AI controlled. And then there was the door that Steve had already seen in a long-sent picture, still there with the precision of an engineer rather than the eye of an artist.
Steve hooked his thumbs through his belt loops and looked at the light over the kitchen table, a rustic bulb that held a mysterious charm to it.
"I've been kissed before," Steve said quietly, clear words wrapped in muted memories, a history page dotted with faded ink, "Haven't done the kissing first. From my side."
They looked like stubborn kids who had taken on the challenge of finishing a year's worth of projects in a night and had ultimately remembered that they were human beings. Steve felt his smile deepen as Natasha burrowed deeper into Tony's back and the genius edged away in his sleep with a mumbled whine.
“But we also need to come home sometimes, Cap,” she said and Steve swallowed at the melancholy in her tone that swiftly got swept under defiant understanding, “Something’s got to be a breaking point. You want to fight a battle, you need to catch a break after the last one.”
"Is it," Potts commented lightly even as he eyed the pendant on Strange's chain before looking over at Tony, "Did Steve reply yet?"
"Everything okay at SHIELD?" Tony asked and looked up, just enough that he could see Steve's face looking unbearably fond. A mirror, then, just like Tony.
“What’s going on? Can you fix it?” Steve asked and watched Bruce try again, the light zapping from the van behind Scott before the suit reappeared.
He was escaping an explosion he had caused when Steve decided it was time. They had been engaged for six months now and there was no sense in putting it off any longer; there would always be a next mission, which meant that they couldn’t really plan an elaborate setting for this. Besides, he was getting tired of villains taunting Tony as his
“Then why does it need an explanation?” Steve sipped the dark green mix and was surprised when it didn’t taste bad, a hint of mint coming through the other greens, “Not bad.”
“You can always come work with me, you know,” Howard told Tony as they prepared to leave an hour later, eyes lingering on him before looking at Steve, “Or with SHIELD, full-time. I know we’re not the same as what you had but there’s always a world that needs good men and smart men to look out for it. And you’re both New Yorkers, move back here. Hell, I’d say move into the mansion but I can see that you’re not going to agree.”
They were placed in some dark setting, the lights flickering behind them, and arches of stone visible in the corner of the screen. It looked like an underground bunker or a dingy dungeon.
“Really? Because my explanation was that I was waiting for you to come up with the plan,” Tony said and rolled his eyes at Steve’s expression, “What? I proposed. I thought you should have some input in this thing too so, I was gonna let you plan the wedding.”
“Turns out,” Tony said with an affected casual tone trying to hide the momentous words falling from his lips, “resentment is corrosive and I hate it.”
Ten minutes later, they were walking down the grounds of the base and Steve felt his skin prickle with recognition, a premonition of oddity ringing clearly in his mind even as he kept his gait as calm as possible. He’d heard it enough from Natasha to remember and it was obvious from Tony’s own restless curiosity that he was relieved by his temporary anonymity.
He barely resisted jumping when he felt a tentative pat on his back and shot Tony a look, seeing the man wear a small but strangely understanding smile. It wasn't loud but it meant more than any number of assurances and Steve nodded to himself as they continued their walk.
"You okay?" he asked and Steve nodded wordlessly, eyes crinkling at the edges when Tony's hands came to hold him by the shoulders lightly. Tony watched as those eyes widened slightly, a deep wonder setting into them as Tony's hands travelled over Steve's shoulders up till he could frame Steve's jaw, thumbs slotted below ears.
“Tony, we’re at SHIELD. About 30 years since they last saw Captain America,” Steve continued steadily when Tony’s frown deepened, “And some of them
“Did you think about staying?” Bucky asked after a pause, gesturing with a hand at the door, “When you were in the past, in the mission. Did you think about staying? Living again a different way?”
"Mom's pregnant," Tony said suddenly and Steve blinked in surprise at the topic of conversation before nodding.
“Where would you hide a particularly dangerous experiment in an extremely confidential base?” Tony tried to covertly glance around but Steve’s eyes caught the entrance of the barracks and -
"Make it 20," Tony demanded and heard Potts chuckle tiredly but pushed the speed as he calculated the exit route.
“You could come find out yourself,” Bucky said casually but didn’t make it sound accusing, instead looking at the door of the house, “Jesus, did Stark really build this whole place himself?”
"I didn't kidnap them, don't worry," Potts called out from behind and his voice was getting drowsy. Tony could switch to autopilot but he didn't want to risk it for now. He still had to check P.E.P.P.E.R's codes for Kang's work.
"Uh, yeah you. Who else would I ask about the simulation readings?" Rhodey sounded confused but Tony breathed out.
He heard a quietly thoughtful huff behind him but focused on tightening his wrap, rolling his shoulders once more before he faced down the quicker challenge. The cotton of his sleeves were looser on the biceps than they would have been before and the knot under his gut sat twisting tighter with complete awareness of the sounds of his companion moving in the background.
"You know, the other day," Tony said as they walked over to the barrack's door, briefcase lightly swinging in one hand, "Morgan said the wildest thing."
"Yeah," Steve pulled his jacket over, the one they had got from their first shopping trip together, turning away to pick up his shoes, "I'll be in DC for a while."
"You're from the future but not our future?" Reed scratched at his nose and looked up from his screen, nudging Tony's leg as he stretched to pick up the mug from Stephen's table, making a face at it when he realized that it was cold too, "That's – fascinating."
“Jesus fuck how much do you hate me,” the audio recorded as he spoke into the phone, ears ringing in the silence, “How much did I make you hate me that you wouldn’t let me know
"Do we still have the nanospray?" Steve asked and Tony nodded as he dodged another spray of attack, "Doctor Potts – hey, stay still, it won't sting."
"If you bleed out here, I'm going to say your last words were something dumb," Tony gently pushed him back against the chair so he was more comfortable and pat his shoulder, "I'll make it a Dan Brown quote, I'm serious."
But then there was Tony, rushing into Thanos, ramming into his side without the repulsor power. Thanos tried to brush him off but Tony pushed, pulled at his gauntlet, clung to it with the desperation that had always made him stronger than those who could beat him.
The water ran down the white marble for a minute before Tony’s fingers released his hand and nudged him ahead. It wasn’t a serious cut, his skin broken on the surface alone, but Steve let both his hands cup the water that washed through them. He let three rinses go through before ducking his head to splash water on his face. It wasn’t cold enough to be ice, was always moderated keeping that in mind, but something in Steve woke up with the hit of water against his eyes and he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to be back completely.
"We're finally here," Steve said as they reached their jump point and Tony looked like he was about to say something important. There was something familiar and different in his eyes, something Steve had seen in the mirror on quiet days over the past seven years  He never knew if it was good or bad but it always seemed important, like a dismissed fate come to haunt. His reflection had changed in different ways over those seven years but that look was a frequent visitor and to see it in Tony's eyes was momentous in a way that made him catch his breath.
Natasha had squeezed his hand, her ring hitting his own, but she had stayed back with her uncle. Tony had been very specific of when Steve could return.
The jet gravitated to a docking bay and Steve catalogued three disfigured bots waiting for him as the hatch opened. He could try fighting them, try making a break for it, but he had to see Tony and his companion first. Kang had hinted that he had them, and that was Steve's primary mission.
He didn't know what Potts was made of but the damned man made it to the bridge with a second to spare, feet dragging and his undersuit soaking through the blood from his abdomen. One of the suits turned towards him and Tony fired the weapons system, taking it out before it could do anything.
Meeting Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne had been one of the better parts of the year they had spent, both in different situations but both gaining them friends. Tony and Jan got on like a house on fire, both larger than life personalities finding an easy mesh of compatibility with their wit and humour. Steve liked talking to her too, her charm and ability to keep a conversation going compensating for his more reserved times. Hank had more of a sharper edge to his personality and he ended up becoming Tony’s friend through a series of arguments in SHIELD labs that steadily became more productive. With Steve he was respectful in a way, more tempered and open to following orders.
"Forgot you weren't used to portals," a voice said and he turned his head to see Potts standing a few feet beside him, rubbing at his sternum, "You alright? Come on, we don't have time to rest."
He nodded and she hovered up just enough for him to hold her hand before pulling him away, the air whipping against them as they flew. He had never flown to Tony’s house before, hadn’t been there more than the one time they had ended up having a tense lunch. They had driven Nat’s car that day, too engrossed in their adrenaline to enjoy the view of the drive.
"It's my breakfast," Steve flicked a finger at Tony's forehead before cupping his cheek, "And I haven't gotten anything in return yet."
“You’re sure this will work?” Steve asked Nat in an undertone as they walked to the area where Bruce had set up the arrangement. This was like the serum all over again, an experiment that was walking the edges of horrific and heroic, the extreme of science with a few heaps of desperate madness.
When Tony didn't respond, hand steady and poised for attack, the man wearing an older reflection of him nodded to himself.
He waited till Rhodey lifted Tony in his arms and the others gave way for the fallen to be carried home.
It had been unexpected, bumping into an oddly familiar kid when Steve first reached Flint a couple of weeks ago. He hadn’t planned anything concretely but he knew that the world hadn’t stopped spinning entirely and there were still people who had made promises that he could fulfill. The committee hadn’t expected Captain America to fill in for Falcon for the volunteering but Steve had come as just himself, just a friend trying to do the right thing and not let his best friend’s word go empty.
me, is it?" he asked, because screw this, screw the doubts and alienation, "Whatever happened to ‘we are a team', Cap?"
“It wasn’t worth it,” he exhaled and it felt calm, an admittance out in the open, “It wasn’t worth it, Tony.”
Steve felt his throat tense, breath catch over his lungs and this was not the kind of hope he had woken up with today but God, it was more than he had come to expect over the years.
“We need some ID,” Steve looked down at himself and then at the shield still clutched in his hand, “And a change of clothes. Don’t think they’ll take a Captain America imposter story too well.”
"Yes, Anthony," he replied with an emphasis on the name even as Tony heard the momentary shake in his voice that a stranger might have missed.
There were also different, much more than they had anticipated, and it came up in the most unexpected ways.
"Kang's tuned into my life-sign detection and you'd match, it could help throw him off," Potts shrugged a shoulder, and Tony raised a brow at the veiled tension in the cavalier tone.
“See you tomorrow,” Steve replied and had a thought clearer than the mess already rolling in his head, “Pepper?”
“Hey, Queens!” Steve threw the one holding him in a chokehold and raised his eyes to track where the Spider suit was, “Heads up!”
They stayed at Peggy’s place for a night before Tony got Howard’s number from her and made a call as Doctor Potts. Steve didn’t know how well the two men knew or understood each other but by the end of the conversation Tony was able to procure a Stark guesthouse to use till they had a more concrete plan.
“You’re talking about getting back into the fray,” Steve looked down at the paper and the model of a new uniform, a slight resemblance to his old stealth suit, looked back at him, “Tony, I can’t be Captain America again.”
Steve's eyes cut over to him at that because Tony knew his sore spots too, he knew the exact tone to rile him up. He honestly didn't know how Potts managed to make things smooth because good didn't mean fine, and friction burned worlds when it was them. He could love Steve, could want all of him, but they were at loggerheads more than they were not, and maybe things would get too tiring soon. Maybe fighting wasn't enough and he couldn't find the other side of this river between them.
"I -," Steve shouldn't speak, he knew he shouldn't and nothing mattered but his hand was fighting hard to not cling to Tony's arm and his eyes were trying to not cloud so he had to let something go, "I miss you."
“Thank you,” there was the clatter of tea cups and saucers, “Are you still up to meeting me tomorrow?”
Steve was moderately mollified when young Hope found her way into Tony’s car and ended up spilling juice all over the backseat.
"It was a routine move," Rhodey was tired, bone-deep fatigue with a throbbing ache blooming between his eyes, "We'd practised it before and everything went according to plan."
“And I,” Tony stared down Thanos, blood and fire dripping down around him, Earth’s best defender holding her safety in his hands, “I am Iron Man.”
They were almost there, almost to the van when Thanos destroyed it with one blow, his blade cutting through it before Carol could get there.
"Yeah, we made it, I guess," Tony agreed and Steve knew that there were words missing in the conversation. Too many of them, lost or thrown away, locked away far from the tongue where the truth could have risked a safe bubble. There were broken thoughts between them and Steve knew that it should hurt but somehow it was calming now. Whatever path they could have taken, whatever another time could have seen, it wouldn't be here. It wouldn't be now. And that was -
to be a baby,” Natasha muttered from Rhodey’s left and Steve bit back a laugh at the low five they shared, Bruce shaking his head at all of them.
“You know, there are times when I don’t follow your signal,” Steve leaned back in his chair and huffed out a chuckle when Tony turned the chair across him and sat on it with the frown still in place, “Even when you’re speaking in sentences that make sense when taken as individual words. Is there a code I should learn?”
It took Tony three minutes later than calculated to get to the spot and Steve recognized his companion in an instant, eyes shifting back to Tony to gauge his body language. The silver briefcase was clutched tight in his hands and his shoulders were lowered, but Steve could see the way his eyes kept falling back to Howard between every word exchanged. They hadn’t discussed it, Howard or Maria or the last time both of them had been seen, and Steve felt his heart clench as he watched Tony hug the man who didn’t know their relation yet.
Steve removed his boots by the door and shut the door behind him, the lock reading his palm as it clicked without a sound. The sounds were coming from the kitchen and Steve hoped they weren’t making pizza again.
“Would you believe me if I told you I thought we could have still done it? Won, despite having broken apart?” Steve paced in front of the sofa on his fifth attempt, “Maybe I was foolish, maybe you had seen the future, but I still thought it. That’s why I let Vision come along for that damned stone extraction. I led him to his fucking death, but would you believe me if I said I thought it would be okay in the end?”
The blinds were no wall between the past and the present, but all Steve could do was stare as Peggy read through her file and argued with her subordinate. There were no words escaping the clog in his chest, the lock in his throat effectively holding him back as she left.
At least it wouldn't be if Steve would stop running. Power walking. Skating. Whatever he was doing every time he and Tony were in the same room. It wasn't until after dinner that Tony found himself having a moment with Steve in privacy, when the others had cleared the room. He wasn't usually a fan of doing dishes by hand but considering that it was the only reason Steve hadn't run, Tony felt new appreciation for dirty utensils soaked in water.
Neither of them had any solid arguments when Bruce volunteered and reminded them that the Hulk was made to withstand gamma radiation. Tony put up his armour’s light shield and Steve raised his own shield, everybody at alert when Bruce slid his hand into the gauntlet.
“Good luck!” she called out and Steve huffed on a smile, staring down at the box before sitting down at the nearest chair. He considered freshening up first, getting a shower and change of clothes. But the wallet was right there and he shifted his jaw, nodding to himself before picking up the tools.
“Hey, Nat,” he let the water run through his fingers and made a face at the less than completely fresh quality of his produce, “I’ll send you the week’s details in an hour. Just got to catch some dinner first.”
“We need to have Natasha’s funeral too,” she said after a beat, rubbing her palms on her arms, “We’ll plan one for her too, she should have one.”
That night Steve dreamt of foxes chasing hounds in the stars, a knight calling out to them with a bow of cherry wood in her hand.
“We tried!” the silence echoed with his declaration and he put the coffee pot down on the counter half-empty. Everything was drained, a void crept into every crack and he was tired of pretending otherwise. He was just tired of
Steve stared at the man in front of him and wondered why he hadn’t understood before that there were worse fates than death, worse realities than knowing that someone wouldn’t come back. Tony was here, alive and whole, but he couldn’t come home.
"Ah," the crouched figure tilted his head up and stood from the bedside, slowly turning to look at Tony, "Well, that'll complicate things but hey, you're not the old one between us so that's a good point, right?"
“He would want it to come back to you,” Steve offered and she smiled, twisting the ring around her right hand’s finger.
"It seems to be coming from Ms Romanoff's quarters," the AI responded, a note of hesitation creeping in before she continued, "Scans indicate that it is – you, Tony."
“I hate to break it to you, Tony, but we’re not married,” he reminded with a faux-innocent look and made a face when Tony flicked at his ankle.
“I’m not sure that’s going to end well,” Tony muttered but stood up as Steve moved out of the booth, following him out of the place. They ended up walking through the streets in silence and Steve didn’t know where they’d end up but Tony was following him without protest. It was quiet between them, a cloud shading them from the upcoming storm.
“I fixed it,” Tony said with an excited desperation to his voice and Steve’s eyes widened even as his grin deepened, “A fully functioning time GPS device.
Well all these times they come and go, and alone don’t seem so long,” Steve hummed as he crossed the bridge with a familiar ease, a slow smile creeping over, “Over ten years have gone by we can’t rewind, we’re still locked in time.”
"I miss you," he repeated and he was a coward, had been one for so long that it was in his bones. A brave soldier and a cowardly lov -
asked as he took in the complete lack of explosions or villainous entry signs, combined with the eerie silence devoid of alarm sirens that should be getting the team up by now.
"Happened more than we needed it to, but I don't have sympathy right now," he rolled to his feet, touching his cheek before grimacing, "Get whoever's onboard and also Steve. We need Steve."
Fury came in with Sam and Hope to take over the escort of Tony’s body to SHIELD’s facilities himself.
“There’s too much to do,” Pepper inhaled shakily and pushed hair out of her face, “I need to arrange for Tony’s – there’s clean-up out there and a whole new world.”
“You want to stand by your choice? That’s fine. I’m making my own now,” he dusted his hands on his jacket and raised a brow at Tony’s expression, “You didn’t actually think that I was going to leave you here alone and go, did you? I told you, Tony, we do things together.”
He didn't stop to linger on the hurt that Tony hadn't called him himself and focused on the thought that the last thing he had told before leaving was something related to Steve. It was most likely an offhanded goodbye or something that would drive Steve up the wall right now but he chose to interpret it as a call for help.
"I guessed," he replied, smiling slightly when Tony shot him a questioning look, "Your birthday comes next month, right? Well, here at least."
"I have the Cube, get us out of here now," Steve's voice came clearer and Tony bit back a relieved sigh, "I'm almost there to the launch area, 30 seconds ETA."
"I'm tired," Steve informed as he peered up at his husband, hair flattened with the occasional spike still holding out, looking unbearably younger than he did in the team meeting he had pulled through hours ago. Tony's shoulders had ached with a phantom need to bump against Steve's at the coiled tension he had seen grow tighter with every mistake they had catalogued.  There weren't always the best options and safest choices, confidence veiled over disastrous failures. Heroes weren't always the lifeboats that carried everybody ashore, and it was visible with the backlog of experience they had gathered. There were always tears and holes waiting to topple them. There was always
. That wasn’t in their set of rules, the code of the command. So, in an attempt to house what they had released from my body, they took me in.”
Thor had the blade pressed to his chest, stuck against a rock with Thanos crouching over him when Steve got to his feet and looked over at the weapon thrown aside. It hadn’t worked once, had seemed it would but it hadn’t. It needed proof, etched deep into the soul of the person who could wield it.
"She's smarter then," Steve quipped and let his lips quirk into a smile as they approached the elevator, "You ready?"
"You're running?" Tony didn't drink but nodded to Pott's hand clenching the bottle, noting the ring, "Alone?"
He let that sink in and spoke, letting the core of the past five years come through in his words. Protect each other. Survive. Don’t give up.
“It’s a beard, Tony,” Steve reminded, gulping down the glass in a go before wiping his mouth, “We were on the run, personal grooming wasn’t high on anyone’s list of priorities.”
Till there was even one of them standing, Thanos hadn’t won. Till there was one person against him, Earth hadn’t lost. Steve was the last man standing and he dragged his feet, walking to meet the army head-on.
“It’s been a couple of hours,” his eyes cut back to Steve and Steve exhaled, slinging the towel around his neck, “Don’t worry, you didn’t miss anything exciting. Except for the few seconds when I almost fought Rocket for giving us a heart attack, but I think that’s pretty normal when you’re around him.”
“Why?” Tony edged forward, ridges of his outline softening, the words coming out quieter than the question warranted, “He made it for you.”
The day Tony decided that they best way to celebrate their seventeenth anniversary was to adopt all of Nutmeg’s kittens, Natasha’s cat having birthed the most convincingly duplicitous spawns to exist – that was the end of one portion of Steve’s peace and sanity.
“Yeah, I think I latched on to the nearest energy source and that was you,” Tony nodded before wiping his hand on a tissue, “It wasn’t easy then but then something happened in Asgard and it became easier to let myself link to your senses. See what you could see, hear what you could hear. With every stone you returned, a part of me was released from them and I became more – alive, I guess.”
When he had finally inhaled enough of the moment, filled his insides with enough of belief and insignificant seconds, Tony stood up and walked towards Steve. Reaching him, Tony let his head rest against the man's back, between the shoulders that had carried too many invisible burdens for long.
Steve nodded and Tony raised his fist, a band of wires coiled around his fingers, an imitation of his repulsor watch.
"No," Steve's voice was low but sharp enough to cut through Tony's frustration, making him pause to take a closer look.
They held a public funeral at Manhattan, and the crowds poured in, thronging the streets from the break of dawn. Rhodey delivered the eulogy for Tony and
Steve didn’t know what he was going to say till they finally marched up to the centre of the portal’s base and he looked at them, his team. Natasha close to Clint, Thor with haunted eyes and a nervous energy in his hands, Rhodey in sync with Nebula – they were all here, all in this together.
As he stared at the man in front of him now, Steve could feel the risk of that same memory crash into him again. Any second now he would blink and the face would be someone else's.
They had to get the gauntlet to Scott’s van and Steve saw Rhodey clear a line of Thanos’ army, Rocket shoot through the guts of three aliens at once as Drax handled those at his back. Tony and Pepper were at each other’s back for an instant, protecting each other as they burned through the closest circle of fighters. Wanda was awash in red and Bucky covered her, gunning down stragglers even as M’Baku caved the skulls in to his right.
The machine worked before he could complete the sentence and Bruce counted to five, hitting the switch again at one.
Captured baseball from a time before him, moments from 1870 and later flowing in hushed tones. His gaze drank in broken pieces of history, cards given free with gum once upon a time now sitting decorated on pristine cases, mementos of people who had seen less applause than they got in guarded museums now. It shouldn’t have been the home of kinship but stories couldn’t be authors and Steve had seen enough exhibits of his own to find threads of connection to those who lay now stored in labels before him.
“Cap, this is Sam, do you copy?” the voice continued in his comm and Steve slowed down, feet skittering to a halt, “On your left”
“And Clint,” Steve had vipers nesting in his chest and it wasn’t fair, nothing was, but he went on, “Bruce”
," he commented and Steve raised a brow at the next look, a reflected amusement in his eyes when he remembered the last time he had brought Tony food from the new joint he had discovered. Tony had enjoyed riling him up before finishing every last scrap of the meal.
"Sam knows I'm here," Steve answered, letting Stephen take what he will from that, "Stand-by if things go south, we might need back-up."
Anniversaries and birthdays were always tough, especially today for the past four years. This time though, Steve had expected it to be more. This was the age Tony had last seen Morgan as and Steve had anticipated it to hit them hard. He had rushed through debrief before hurrying back, hoping that he could be there when the storm came.
“Father to a baby girl,” Tony spoke over Steve and finally looked up, eyes sharp, a conflicted mess of shards, “They had a girl. He wanted to know if I had any good names since Maria isn’t too happy with his suggestions yet. You know, since I told him I had a girl myself.”
"Tell you what," he said as he met Steve's eyes with an unholy grin that always led to either unmitigated chaos or sheer genius, never in between, "I think we found one."
"I'm almost there to unlocking the dampeners," Potts replied from the screen, looking haggard but focused, "Where's the other one?"
He eyed the expanse of the open grounds before him and considered going back inside, persuading his feet to move again, when he first heard it. Speed.
The first thing Peggy had done once they had finished explaining was to walk out of the room saying that she needed four hours of rest. Tony had turned to Steve the minute she had left and mouthed a cheerful looking ‘We’re fucked’.
“If history doesn’t show that I was your Best Woman, then I’m going to prove your marriage void, Rogers,” she warned and nodded only after Steve nodded over Tony’s hysterical laughter, “Fine then, let’s get you married. I can’t stand the constant tension anyway.”
"It's okay?" Steve answered and Tony felt his smile bloom, a loose laughter rattling between his lungs.
“We’re not made for schedules apparently and I’m okay with being impatient about this,” Steve quipped, leaning forward to almost touch Tony’s forehead, “I want to be your husband, Tony. Let’s get married.”
“It’s the front gate,” Nat replied quietly but he could hear the horrified bloom of hope in her voice and –
"- and he's particularly targeting you because of me," Steve said, dead serious as he held Tony's gaze, "No matter what I thought about Extremis, it was yours and he targeted you only after I came. He's going to fight me, Tony, but he's going to kill you."
His lips curved into a smile even before wakefulness fully entered his consciousness and Tony felt the dip in the bed at his back.
"You got it?" Steve asked, purposefully not addressing the expression on Tony's face as he let the man take a minute to process whatever he had talked about.
“Just because you can’t explain it doesn’t mean that you didn’t have a relationship with him,” she pointed out, “It doesn’t mean that it’s unacceptable.”
“Your guilt-trips are so much better when they’re just judgemental looks,” Tony sounded calm but dangerously so. Steve was high past being deterred.
It had to work, Steve decided and dragged himself to it, a hand closing around the handle with all the surety he had in him. He didn’t care about proving himself to anyone, not anymore, not in a long time now but he wouldn’t let his friends die again. He wouldn’t let them battle without having their backs protected.
“My second chance,” Tony completed the sentence, his smile wan, “I was pretty specific when the demand came. The choice had to be mine, affecting me. The world in the balance and the only thing I could match to that was my desire to be with my family. The deal worked, and now I can’t go back. Not to any timeline where either of them are my reality.”
It felt like that had been an entirely different life and the frustration spun through Steve’s veins further.
There was dust clinging to his eyes and Steve blinked them out, curling his legs to try and get up. Tony was standing over him, blood on his forehead and dark dust over his cheeks but he was holding something that made Steve strive to get to his feet faster.
He had no guarantee of it playing out the way he wanted it too but it was too obvious, right there as an option and Steve took it.
Tony hummed and swiped the finalized code to the right, bringing up the last stream to the forefront.
"I don't see any other Tony Stark I just kissed around here," Steve pointed out with a hint of amusement, his eyes still watchful as they tracked Tony's gaze, "Did I get something wrong?"
There was something intrinsically disturbing about watching a spine extend beyond three tables. And then watch it snapping back to a less queasy proportion. He could appreciate the reduced effort because nobody enjoyed walking to go pick up a scanner. But not at the cost of – well, whatever Reed thought was perfectly acceptable in their company.
Somewhere down his own time, Potts must have learnt to identify bitterness in his reflection pretty well and Tony caught his knowing look as he schooled his expression.
"You better catch me," Potts said even as he was moving, his voice getting fainter. Catching an 80-year-old version of himself should have worried him more but Tony didn't have time to think about it as he started the jet with an intention of dragging hell into this godforsaken place.
“You know that you’re not trapped here, right?” he asked as Steve did the dishes, Tony’s cooking wiped clean from their plates.
“Wait, Vantablack?” Pepper scowled into the camera, making a disgruntled noise when Steve nodded, “He’s an absolute shit.”
"She thinks I stole it," Tony grumbled but climbed onto the bed without bothering to change into his nightclothes, "I'll continue to pretend I did if you continue to ignore this."
New York was no stranger to him and Steve let the familiar air wrap around him as he reached his destination after a journey that seemed longer than it really was. The
Sam was emotional when he got the shield and his eyes widened when he caught sight of the ring on Steve’s finger. It was understandable. There had been a different world when he had thought himself unwilling or incapable of wearing it.
He had set the pot and was about to wash some leeks when his phone rang, Nat’s tune echoing in the room. Steve looked at his leeks and down at his phone before hitting the call button, switching to speaker mode and continuing his work.
“At least it’s just me,” he rolled his eyes and considered a minute before moving back to the counter to get one more carrot. It wouldn’t hurt. “Are you at the facility?”
“Yeah, in prison,” Tony looked down at his wrist and Steve shot him a look before copying the gesture, entering the time coordinates, “One last trip, ready?”
"He did, didn't he?" Tony said in a tone that suggested that it was mostly to himself, a sense of warm wonderment in the words. There were times when Steve wished that he had developed a more regular ease of being physically affectionate or reassuring with people. People closest to him, at least. It came easier when it was with Natasha, who was more forthright than expected at setting comfortable boundaries with friends. It was simpler with Sam, who didn't have qualms about initiating things or conversations unlike Steve. Bucky had gained experience on Steve's psyche through time and even though things were probably stiffer now between them, he was still a known area.
"Only if you're going to stop with one," Tony suggested, letting Steve take the lead, just this once. He'd figure out what it meant later, he decided.
“No! No, yes,” Steve cleared his throat and watched Tony’s eyes look worried when his voice cracked a little, “I did mean yes. But then.”
“I’m good,” her voice sounded considerably warm, sounds of a pen clicking in the background, “It’s been a while, hasn’t it? How are you? I heard that you were working with May last month.”
, Steve thought to himself in exasperation before ducking out of sight and scanning his surrounding for a hideout till he could escape. He tried to keep his gait and pace as normal as possible as he walked away from his would-be captors till he found the first door that seemed unlocked. Grabbing it open, he slipped into the room and listened for the footsteps of the guards passing through. It would take them a minimum of three minutes to put the place on lockdown if suspicions were strengthened and a maximum of seven minutes to -
It probably was a reason to celebrate somewhere that he didn't actively question the circumstances, but Tony didn't linger much on it. Maybe the duvet being the suit's colours after weeks of a well-kept surprise had softened him one day. Maybe it was the spare socks in hand that had saved the day at an MIT gathering, with Steve waving him off after stuffing the ruined ones in his pockets. It wasn't the most noted among their memories, and there weren't pictures of these, but somewhere between them, Tony had understood that there was more to love than what the stories promised.
“We’ll figure it out,” Steve assured him, passing a cushion that was behind him, “We’ll figure it out when we get there.”
“We really did bring them all back, huh?” Tony leaned back and turned his head to look at Steve, a hint of awe in his voice.
As they walked back to the car, Steve let Scott’s nervous quips wash over him and reminded Nat that Tony was right in his apprehensions. He imagined the stake, the magnitude of a personal gamble that deep, remembered Clint’s loss and knew that he couldn’t push Tony. He would have years ago, would have argued the merits of a risk this high, but that Tony Stark was, above all else, Iron Man.
Time had never really been his loyal friend and honesty hadn't been his strongest suit when it came to certain matters that would lay buried more pressing issues. Steve was used to that and almost six years of practice made it easier to accept it.
"A ton. You know, like a normal person," Tony said with the undertone of a laugh that he was swallowing. It had been a long time since Steve had heard him speak with this ease and with so much love for someone. Being a creator had always been Tony's calling but being a father had let him come alive in ways that made Steve's heart ache with both fond happiness and an accepted bittersweet shadow. He hadn't lied when he had told Tony that he was happy for him. Morgan was precious in every possible way and there was nothing more beautiful than knowing that Tony had found people to love as much as he had always wanted to give.
"Okay," Tony agreed, even though it wasn't okay, none of this was okay but he wasn't going to take the lead right now, "Tell Sam I'll send him the upgrades by next week."
"A – oh," Steve caught sight of the astral projection data and Tony looked over to see the realization dawn on his face, "Aberration. She said ‘aberration'."
“You’ve got to be kidding me” Tony looked gobsmacked for a second before shaking his head, “Steve, you have to leave. Your time is up. And I’m not coming to meet anyone who might potentially punch me.”
“I tried to talk to Nat,” the beds were apart, separated by a rust orange table that held the simple lamp still on. There was one more bedroom across the hall and Tony had taken it during the first few days until Steve had found him having a panic attack on the third day in the dark. The next morning they had dragged the spare bed to the larger room and they had both lived through enough nightmares to not comment on it. Simple reassurances weren’t worth over-thinking when there were losses they both carried.
Steve didn't get another word out before he was portaled out of the room and he found his feet on firmer ground in a cellar similar to where he had seen Tony in.
“What could go wrong?” Steve laughed lightly, hefting the fresh shield in his hands and turned to address the Captain America who was staring at him with a worried expression, “I’ll be fine, son, don’t wear that look.”
“I hate uninvited guests,” Tony hummed and Steve made the jump, trusting Tony’s accuracy with ease of experience. Natasha called this an act of adrenaline junkies but they got the job done and Steve secretly enjoyed the missions where it was just him and Tony. Maybe they rubbed off on each other a little too much but he was okay with that.
"Just to confirm," Tony asked as he glanced over another window which carried the familiar logo and details of Camp Lehigh, "this isn't actually the place that you were born, right?"
“You’re taking this way better than I expected,” Tony informed him but Howard shrugged, smiling at Steve.
The dream was his only reason for sleep now and Steve tried, every single time, to bring the star closer. To blink the snow out of his eyes and focus, keep his eyes trained on what he needed to catch. He tried to have safe hands for it rest.
“Good,” Tony sighed and brought up a hand to squeeze Steve’s fingers, “Hey, I never told you what Nat said. At Vormir.”
It took a bit of help from Strange and Sue to get them to the Tower safely, the journey through Stephen's portal jarring for Tony, but they made it just in time for Potts to finally lose consciousness.
Steve nodded and felt an air of unobtrusive awkwardness settle as they walked beside each other towards the exit. It would be too risky to depart in open view of a crowd and they had agreed beforehand on the spot where they would do it.
"It's Sunday," Tony groaned but stretched his arms, letting the sheets fall to his abdomen as he shifted till he could sit up, eyeing the tray with a pleased smile, "Bacon? Aww, you
Now though, the story was different and Steve didn’t know which rationalization would make sense of it to the world. Now Clint wasn’t Hawkeye with a code, with a cool head and a warm heart for those he considered his own.
“Nobody asked you to look, Tony,” he said instead and bit back a laugh when Scott rushed to assure him about it being America’s ass.
“What happens to the world that came back?” he twisted on the couch and faced Steve, who blew on his forkful of spaghetti, “There’s going to be complete chaos, it’s been five years for some and a few seconds for the rest. How exactly are they going to cope?”
Now there was Ronin and massacres, grey vs dark, and a litany of losses – enough to break the man Steve had once known better.
They had lost their latest hope, discovered a new puzzle of a possible alien species, and they were trapped but Steve stared at Tony; he had lost people before and Tony knew what loss did for Steve even if he didn’t let it affect others.
“Here to see a friend,” he replied, noting the mess around them, but Nat bit into her sandwich and put her feet up on the table, moving the plate so that it was in his reach.
"It's a lot nicer than mine," Bruce replies mildly, still not looking up from his tablet conversation with FRIDAY.  They are going through a list of things to order for the lab.
He doesn’t say, at the hand of his dead brainwashed ally, friend, whatever Howard and Barnes had been.  He doesn’t say, suffocating after listening to your husband die, weak and slowly feeling the air leave your lungs and sharp squeaks as you try to get oxygen and can’t.  He doesn’t say, drowning in a pool of water, battery sparking at your chest as people scream, trying to break you down into something they can use. But it’s a close thing.
Tony waits until he looks up, and when Steve does, Tony is careful to meet his eyes and hold his gaze. "Thank you for telling me."
Tony tightens his grip on the screw driver.  At that close of a range, the lightweight body armor would not have been enough to absorb the shock of an armor piercing round, and if Tony knew those guns the Iranians were holding, they were Hammer Industries guns that were usually loaded with armor piercing rounds.  “FRIDAY, alert Red Wing to advise Falcon to take a safer distance,” Tony voices, barely above a whisper.
“Tony,” Steve says, tentative like he is scared to startle him.  Tony can see him in the reflection of the glass, reaching but not touching.
He gets into the bed and pulls the blanket over his head, counting breaths until he can’t think about anything except for the next number in the order.
They continue on like this for a while. Chirps are exchanged, there is a moment where Clint's perch explodes and Tony is too far away to catch him, only to have Thor to snag him right before he hits the ground, and Hulk gets a little too enthusiastic about tossing parts that he snags Natasha in the temple with a stray piece of robot armor and Steve in the gut with a robot arm. Tony probably has a head injury from how hard one robot smacked him in the head.
They have to reveal themselves in Wakanda because they get caught sneaking around. Tony is loud and keeps all the eyes on him, while Steve is careful to carry a different body language, tactical gear and mask hopefully helping.
“To go punch some Nazis.  Is that not what your Aunt Peggy says when she is going on adventures?” She replies, delighted.  Daniel roars with laughter, and Jarvis shakes his head fondly behind the two other adults.
“It seems like Extremis can’t regenerate them, so you will have to adapt to what you have,”  The main doctor, the one talking, looks over his glasses at Tony. “You aren’t dumb. Not by a long shot.  It’s just going to take you a while longer to comprehend something, and you’ll have to accept that you won’t ever get some others.”
"Steve," he barely says, before Steve applies a little pressure, and Tony feels it all the way to his toes. "Oh God," he gasps out, half prayer, half curse as the fingers drift again, moving up, stroking in circles as they go. They got higher and higher until Steve’s fingers curl around the zipper and pull it down as Tony fumbled with the button of his jeans. Steve reaches in, stroking Tony’s cock through the thin cotton of his boxer briefs.
Tony looks over his shoulder at the cluster of people at the bar to their right, Natasha watching on in disgust, and probably lecturing them on their choices based on their faces.  “You know I never thought we would ever have another party like this after Ultron.”
(He’s nineteen again. Tony’s hungover on Dad’s good scotch, maybe even still a little drunk, but he’s stoic as he tells the officer, “Show me.”
Tony can feel Steve smile into his shoulder as he varies the pressure. He shudders at the move, fingernails digging into the Steve’s skin as he shifts and pushes up. Steve pulls his head back, catching Tony’s eyes as Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist. Steve groans this time as he adjusts and gets a better grip to hold Tony up. Tony can feel Steve even through the denim.
Tony had grown up in a family who held secrets close to their chests.  He still looks back and wonders if they hadn't been spies, former soldiers, and wartime inventors, maybe they would have taught him to be honest.
“You think we don’t talk? With you dancing through time to visit us all?” She smiles, twisting her wedding ring before turning to him.  “Oh my baby, how tired you look.”
Tony tightens his grip on the kid for a second before releasing him.  “Come say hi to Rhodey, eat your weight in food and then come back down here and make sure everything is good.
“I think it’s your turn to go under the ice,” it sneers, and for a single moment, Tony is glad this isn’t Steve’s face.  He wouldn’t be able to handle this if it was Steve’s face staring back at him.
When Steve settles beside him today, Tony doesn’t do any of that.  He just leans forward, finishing soldering the fine wires in front of him.  It’s steady work, moving down a line of the circuit, rotate and repeat. He flips the board and continues on the other side, before turning off the tool and pulling back.  He grimaces as he inspects the work. Not bad but sloppy. He’s gotten used to the help of JARVIS or gauntlet when it comes to the fine work.
Tony gaps.  “I’m a mother?  And I didn’t get anything for Mother’s Day?  For shame son of mine.  For shame!”
Clint meets Steve’s eyes across the room, where Steve is settled with a tired Tony on his lap, dozing quietly.
Bruce's fingers twitch but he ignores the comment.  “Do you have fine hairs on your skin that allows you to stick like a spider?” Bruce queries as he grabs the tip of the paper and pulls.  It stays attached to the kid’s hand.
The morning after, Steve traces the seam of the arm, high on Tony’s shoulder, and watches Tony’s face as he does so.  He doesn’t look away from the scars, doesn’t flinch, but he watches Steve more than he does the movement.  Like Tony’s waiting for the second it becomes too much for Steve.
He walked through the living room and peered in the direction of the compact kitchen to see Natasha sitting patiently on the counter top, Tony braiding a tiara into her hair.
“Not a big ugly building,” Tony quipped as he looked away from the place to eye Steve, his borrowed sunglasses slipping down the bridge of nose till Steve could see his eyes.
When Tony called Howard the next day, the man was delighted to know that he’d be expecting a visit. They ended up borrowing a SHIELD car and Steve put together a few final loose ends while Tony managed to wrap things up with his project. It took them another couple of days before they were ready to leave and Peggy came by with her husband to wish them luck.
“A little impatient, aren’t you?” Tony looked amused but Steve could see the happiness in his eyes and he shot a sheepish smile.
Ten minutes and about twelve years of trauma unloaded to his unfortunate counterpart later, Steve finally landed in their rendezvous spot to see Tony and Scott sitting in a stolen car. As Scott began inching dangerously close to a complete breakdown, Steve was ready to pull the plug on the mission when Tony got out of the car with an unholy glint in his eye and Steve knew that he was about to be dragged into the craziest plan possible.
"Finding him," Potts responded distractedly, shooting Tony a fleeting glance when he came to stand beside the man, "You named your AI after Pepper?"
“It’s alright, we’re all going to be okay,” Pepper promised Tony and Steve counted one breath, “You can rest now.”
And then Bruce lay tired, one arm hurt from the energy of the Snap as Tony sprayed the healant over it. Somewhere in the periphery of his mind, Steve could hear Clint pick up a call and Scott call out to them but his attention was on Bruce and making sure that he survived.
Steve dropped to the ground hard when his throat was released and he could hear Thor come for Thanos with a snarl, could see Tony get pushed off with a purple hand.
"This isn't the first time someone's said that in history," Steve looked at the screen when he heard Tony curse, "Why them?"
Carol landed in the clearing before the house sooner than Steve had realized and his boots hit the ground with an unsteady balance. He could still see the little tent perched a few feet away,  the light of the porch bringing out its outline.
“He’s hit,” Steve observed, gently pulling away the man’s flailing hand to check the wound in the gut, “It’s not a bullet and it isn’t deep, he’ll live.”
“There’s this line in a John Cale song,” he spoke, the phone at his ear and a falling sun covering the sky in yet another goodbye, “It’s called Paris 1919 and the line goes
The hand on his shoulder tightens.  He thinks about Rhodey.  Falling and not being able to make it in time.  Pepper glowing.  He thinks about 1,188 people.  The millions before that.  He thinks about the three that it started with, a Humvee on fire in the middle of Afghanistan.  Tony has to remember to breathe.
Spidey lifts his right hand up in a tiny wave.  “Hiiiiiiii,” he drawls out, and from the slump of his shoulders and hang of his head, it’s a little sheepish as well.
Vision meets Strange’s gaze easily.  “Without the stone, I will effectively be unpowered.  It is what essentially allowed me to inhabit this physical form instead of just being a program that could live through servers.”
“You do?” Bruce counters.  He reaches out with a piece of paper, and Spidey, with a sigh of someone who has done this a number of times before, reaches out and touches it with a single finger.  The paper sticks.  The costume clad teenage waves it with no enthusiasm as Bruce watches, enraptured.
When Steve finally takes it, she adds, "I talk to him too." Steve meets her gaze, again, and there is something vulnerable about her nonchalance.
T’Challa’s takes Bruce’s offered hand in a firm handshake.  “It’s my pleasure to meet you as well Dr. Banner.  Tony spoke highly of you before the fight in Germany.”
she had smiled enough to light up her eyes and laughed, kissing them both. They all ignored the wax melting into her cake as the candles burned down to nubs as she whispered, fierce,
“We can figure it out,” Steve is saying.  “We can get it taken care of. I’ll take you into the Avengers tower.  We’ve got medical advancements these doctors don’t have. It’s something we can fix.”
“Oh,” someone says suddenly, and very abruptly. And Tony has to fight the urge to close his eyes to push back the sentiment that comes from the accent on the vowels.  “This is unexpected Howard.”
He shuts the parts closed and reveals a small car.  He places it down on the table. “Start her up J.”
"Don't sound so smug," Tony bites back as he ducks. He throws an arm out before an arrow strikes the bot and it blows up in his face. "Little close there Katniss."
“You really don’t.” Tony pitches his voice loud enough that the rest can track the conversation.  “You’ve got the gun to strip away the shape shifting. You’ve got the people to take out the Skrulls here.  I’ve barely been useful the entire time.”
Tony, by contrast tonight, has parts scattered all around him, half in and out of the box he had stored them in.  He has the copper board before him, running the acetone rag across the top.  The sheet he printed from Dad’s SI printer (“half the size of that old Xerox one!” Howard had boasted) sitting beside him.  With his kiddie scissors, he carefully cuts the designed circuit, and fits it on top of the board.  He places both on the towel pile beside him.  The iron that Ana had set out beside him is pressed to the paper.  The table bursts into laughter, and with a clatter of noise covers the hiss the iron makes as he presses.
Bruce had put a hand on his shoulder as he steered them both to the table, pleased smile on his face.)
Tony would laugh if he wasn't insulted that Steve had to ask.  "You think I don't own them already?  Really?  I thought you knew me, Steve."
The crowd of journalists look at him, ready and awaiting his next call. Tony leans and looks around at the crowd, looking to something. "Next….You look familiar Daily Bugle." He wiggles his fingers at the weary journalist.
“No?” Steve responds.  Tony grins, wicked as he regains his footing.  “Leave in twenty minutes  and find me in the penthouse,” he mutters before standing up and leaving the couch.
Bruce adds, “Steve was always bad about going rogue and taking the worst of it on.  We never tried to kill that bad habit.”
Her face says her thanks, even as she utters, "Now we have to go or we'll be late and before you ask, no you can not get into the suit and fly me across the city.  Never again."
Steve can't swallow and he stares, wide eyes at Tony across the lab.  Tony curses the project he is working on and continues on, like what he muttered didn't make Steve feel like he was hitting the ice again in the Valkyrie.
They learn how to avoid each other’s sharp edges in the weeks that come.  How to be people again and not just broken.
The claw marks look fresh and jagged down the metal. They aren't deep, only surface scratches. It feels like he floats there, because Tony can't remember moving. Can't remember putting down the long emptied glass (that's been refilled maybe one too many times). He slides his fingers down the marks. Down the indents on the metal on the side from where is hit him.
“Wanda and I share a mindspace,” Vision says, steady, like it’s nothing, even though Tony hasn’t heard any of this before.  “Sharing powers is similar too.” He meets Tony’s eyes and the emotions are the same as the time like that one time in the Compound kitchen when Tony had said,
“I had for a long time.  It became part of me. I knew you didn’t lean that way,” he shrugs again.  “So I didn’t talk about it. And I did have male partners, so stop trying to act like you knew it all.”
This has been a descent coming for a long time.  There is something coming, he knows, faintly. Something else.  He’s just not sure what beyond the pulsing in his head.
Steve comes home to Tony taste testing a bolognese and leans against the kitchen wall.  When Tony looks up, Steve’s soft smile falls. “You looked,” Steve notes.
Tony can’t read this tilt of his face.  Hadn’t wanted to, back when he was younger.  Hasn’t needed to for over 20 years. Instead he nods, cautiously.
“Wait,” Tony interrupts.  “What are you hinting at?  And you gotta stop hanging around with Nat, she is corrupting you.”
Steve comes up and captures both of Tony’s hands.  “I don’t do drunk, remember?” he jokes, trying for humor, but Tony still isn’t looking at him.  “Hey,” he says.  “You asked for honesty, right?”
Steve slows the treadmill to a stop, pulling up his shirt to wipe the sweat off his face.  Tony averts his eyes from the cut of Steve's hips, the glistening of his abs. He looks up to tread of the treadmill and sees it already looks a little worn and hisses.  Steve chuckles at the reaction.  "Always working the problem Tony."
“We search for things we love,” Steve replies.  Tony meets his gaze and neither says anything. It’s like they are in a standoff, two sides fighting.
Steve’s face twists into what Tony learns later is an incredulous look, like he can’t believe how dumb Tony is being.  The points the genius is missing to connect. “You appreciate?” Steve repeats. “Are you kidding?”
It says something, he knows, how comfortable he is with Steve now.  He pushes the thought away, and keeps his gaze on Steve.
The next portal opens in the middle of New York and it’s suddenly a battlefield, and Steve’s thankful he never takes off his suit for long these days.  He has the weapons Shuri made for him, and looks to his right and catches Bucky’s eye with a grin, adrenaline pumping before he remembers that Tony doesn’t have his bracelets on, or a suitcase, so he’s potentially suitless, and Steve needs to cover him.
Steve leans in close, and Tony tilts his head as Steve places his hands on either side of his cheeks.  “So do I.”
Other him laughs the collective chuckle of him at every age, all at once, before stepping forward.  “Oh Tony,” it says. “You can’t see yourself in the same light as the rest of the world. You see yourself in how everyone view you, but when my siblings and I chose to hide, we chose the brightest sparks.  The ones who could protect us from any and all.” It reaches out and cradles Tony’s face in it’s hands. “You were the one I knew could keep me safe from the hordes as long as you could. You were one of the few who would use my powers for the best.”
He remembers her holding his hand, fierce and bright in that hospital room, even in a bloodstained dress.  The way she had looked at him like he had already gone too far from her.
“I am not my silver tongued cousin,” Death sings, and something in Tony rattles.  It sings deep in him. The same pulsing ache that reached out when Wanda reached into him and gripped.  “I gave you an achievable task. Can you not feel the missing pieces here? You are still too blind Thanos, and I will not have someone so weak by my side.”
Don't think he has forgiven anyone babycakes.  No one is forgiven.  Tony just wants to be a human again and not a depressed lump.  (also everyone loves him but Tony is great at not seeing other people's positive emotions about himself.)
"Your house is wired with cameras, of course it's recorded," Natasha replies dryly.  Tony just keeps laughing, a little too high, but no one calls him on it.
“Howard?” She wonders for a moment, easing her her grip.  But then her eyes go to his goatee and they narrow. “Howard doesn’t have facial hair like that.”
He nods and curls himself into her side and continues pointing out moments that he liked and didn’t, answering her ridiculous questions.  All the while thinking about how much connections mean.
“We tested water and it didn’t get through, and the suit monitors what air it takes in.  I think it can go to recycled air if it needs to, but for only like half an hour.  The undersuit kind of deals with all of this,” Spidey replies before he crouches and drops to the floor. Tony’s breath catches for a second with the ease the kid moves.  It’s fluid and natural, like Black Panther, but he had been training for years.
"I did the same with Peggy and it was a game of chicken with us.  Unspoken feelings and mistakes and I won't keep repeating the past.”
Tony grins and pulls closer and can see the second Steve decides to make a joke. "Just let me know when you decide to formally adopt Peter, so I can be prepared to fight Rhodey to the death to be the second name on that form."
Tony shakes his head.  “No, he’s not. He’s pretty fucked in the head and experimented on, but he’s alive.  What did you always say, you were ‘searching for leads on Hydra cells’? I think? And you found him.”
“Bruce,” Tony begs.  “Bruce I need your help with this.  I can’t -” He bites back a sob.  “I can’t, I can’t.  I
“Death,” Thanos utters, words echoing through every bone in Tony’s body. “I call you to me.  I have the prize you asked for, and now I ask for your hand. May we rule side by side forever.”
He looks away, because it hurts to look at Steve, face eased in sleep, not in movement, not rushing, not fighting - not angry.  He can barely remember Steve before all of this, splitting bagels on the roof, grinning at him across a room.
Tony laughs, long and hard, enough to throw his head back and catch Steve’s eyes crinkle at the corners.  Steve has a deep seated respect of Pepper from the before days.  After, well after, she has cultivated it into a deep seated fear.  She is very proud of it, and Tony lets sleeping dogs lie more than he used to these days.
"Found it," Steve pushed, moving back when the wall rearranged itself and Tony let him hold out a hand as shield till the clearing became wide enough for them to enter, "You're doing pretty well without it."
He went back to his own room and shut his eyes against the image of a missed chance curled around him. Somewhere below in a quiet room, a sighed exhale went unnoticed.
They reached their destination sooner than expected and Bernie looked completely unimpressed even as Sam crowed the victory as though he had driven himself. Steve pretended to miss the target of his high five and lightly pushed the boy’s forehead away from himself, messing up his hair well enough.
There was a sound of someone entering on the other side of the office and Steve looked through the blinds with his heart pounding.
Steve considered Tony’s hand for a beat, just a beat of letting the last memory their hands had met, of a harsher past flow through his mind. One beat and he was slipping his hand into Tony’s, grasping it in a firm shake.
“I never said it was a fair choice,” he said after a while and Steve refused to look at him, staring down at his own hands as he leaned against the wall, “I know you don’t agree, I know why and I don’t expect anything lesser from you. It’s a good thing, really. But Steve, if I have to choose between my kid getting to have a life and me seeing my family for a few more minutes or however long it would take for the balance to collapse once you drag me back – if that was a choice, I will always choose what I chose. Is it cruel? Maybe. Is it selfish? Absolutely. Will I still make the choice? Yes.”
Steve looked down at the center of the mess and there he was, the Titan who had started this all. But it wasn’t the Thanos they knew, Steve could tell, this one was different.
Tony smiled sadly at her and Steve could feel his heart begin to crack, remembering the photo he had once seen, a wedding image from years ago. Pepper had always been his shelter in the storm, the one to put him back together, and now she had a hand over his reactor. Still holding him.
It didn’t surprise him when he found himself walking through the corridors of a relatively empty DIA, eyes roving over the pieces of their recent series of exhibits.
The call disconnected and an incessant tone of beeping took over but Steve stood at the sink for a while. The water draining through his fingers tied him to the present as he digested the information, pulling it apart in his mind.
“It’s the wedding bouquet,” Tony corrected and Steve looked at it again, “Apparently just catching it wasn’t enough and I had to take it with me too.”
“That’s only six,” Tony said once Steve had arranged the blocks and looked up with something more than the bluff he was pulling. He was fond and that’s all that mattered.
There was an explosion to his right and Steve huddled into himself as he moved out of the way, shielding his torso with his hands before he looked to see a hole in the wall. It was jagged but that would do and Steve scrambled to his feet, moving to crawl his way into Tony's cell just as the bots began coming towards them. He managed to get in and grabbed the gun from the nearest bot, twisting it up as he kicked it in the gut, throwing the ripped-out gun at the other bot's head. He heard Tony's grunt and turned to see him duck in time to let a plasma beam miss his head to hit the connection port holding him down.
He had never discussed the Wanda incident with Tony. It hadn’t come up in any conversation and he hadn’t thought about it for years. The only time he had ever said it out loud, in any intention of being heard by Tony, had been to a one-way machine that hadn’t ever served them in deeper communication.
“No, I -,” Pepper had her back to Steve and he could see her sitting beside the bed where they had placed Tony, “I’ll call him in a while. I need to talk to Morgan too – God.”
His eyes traced Tony’s smile when he finished the hairstyle and gave the little girl a high five. It had been an accepted fact under his soul that he had grown to see Tony more than just a companion for a new destiny. There were days when Tony’s laugh would make bruises from a fight ache less, his own eyes softening. He would pretend to drink salted coffee to watch Tony drink his own and then burst into a rant for half an hour, more than fifteen minutes of it spent laughing despite himself. They would sit in silence on the bad days, watching some documentary into the hours of the next day and Steve would let the quiet lodge in comforting rhythm between his heartbeats.
“I can’t, not here anyway,” he ran a hand over his face, “If I activate any contact with them before I get the Cube, everything’s failed.”
“What do you want me to say?!” Tony demanded, eyes blazing, “I had to choose between letting them die, letting everyone die or make a deal to save the world! It was a desperate choice, Steve!”
And then Tony was there, catching the sword with both hands, feet digging into the ground as he held it back. The blade was strong, made to cut through metal with ease and it was going to tear him apart, going to get through the armour to flesh and bone but Tony looked wild as he pulled.
The groom had his face buried in Pepper’s shoulder, her hair creating a veil of sort that showed only slivers of the jaw. Maybe he was smiling. He definitely would be.
"I'm fine," he called out even as he heard footsteps coming closer and looked over his shoulder to see his best friend eye him cautiously, "I'm not
Steve nodded and Bucky accepted it with ease, like he had expected this already. Maybe in some way he had. There weren’t many left to know the details of what needed to be done.
But then he thought of the worlds that Potts had lived through, the timelines where they had fixed the world together, when they had created futures that they couldn't have done alone.
"Because you're his husband too, apparently," Stephen pursed his lips, looking undecided for a second before he continued, "Steven, Potts is Tony, I checked. He's older and different but he is the same man. He's also trying to protect his timeline alongside ours, though I suspect he didn't plan well. Reed is trying to work on locating his timeline and on getting more information about Kang but we're working on limited straws here."
"I'm really liking the Doctor part, you could call me Doctor Stark too," Tony chimed in, quirking his lips at the brush of fingers against his nape, "Rhodey, track us in now and get Danvers on."
It probably was a cause of concern somewhere that he couldn't remember the first time they did it, but Steve didn't really mind. Maybe it was during the draining aftermath of a battle and a dingy motel room that tested Tony's patience. Maybe it was the rushed stay at a Siberian inn, packed with conked out fellow Avengers. He didn't really chronicle this well and he wouldn't get any sympathy for it.
“She was the sacrifice,” Clint choked out and this was wrong, wasn’t it, this was a repeat of five years ago, “She was the goddamned price.”
“Is Rhodey okay?” he asked once he could be sure that his voice wouldn’t fall apart on him, meeting Tony’s eyes in the mirror. He had last seen Rhodey when the man had walked out to clear his head, Rocket and Nebula following him. He wouldn’t look at Clint, not after the flicker of sympathy that had passed through the archer’s face when Rhodey had realized that his last words to Nat were done. That there wouldn’t be any next time, not anymore.
