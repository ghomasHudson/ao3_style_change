Dean reached down and gently lifted Castiel off the ground. He knew he had to prepare his body, even if he couldn’t accept it. This is what had to happen.
Cas tried to muster up a smile, but he couldn’t help feeling disappointed. Dean didn’t like his gift. He had failed. Again.
Dean gently picked Castiel up once more and carried him to the pyre next to where Sam had placed Kelly. He stared for a moment before pouring the oil on his body.
“This is going to be one of the best movies you’ve ever seen,” Dean said as he popped the bottles open.
“Thank you, Sammy,” Dean said, placing the papers on his bed as he pulled Sam in for a hug. “These look like some really good options.”
Cas and Dean stared at each other for a minute before Dean broke and stared at the floor instead, rubbing his head awkwardly with a hand.
The grace must have worked like fire as the Wendigo went up in flames moments later before crumbling to a heap of ash. Dean took a deep breath from where he laid on the ground.
“Yes,” Cas pulled out his list, a little crushed from the time spent in his pocket. “I decided on thirteen songs as well.”
A few tears escaped his eyes as they hugged in the meadow with ashes swirling around them. The happiness of their visit now mixed with the pain of the past.
Covering Cas slightly lessened the hurt. Dean could imagine it wasn’t Cas under there, but some other person they just happened to come across.
He saw himself standing at the edge of the green grass near the river, looking out over the windmill a couple hundred yards away. He was alone with an urn and tears were silently streaming down his face.
“That isn’t you. That’s Naomi’s version of you,” Cas explained. As he did, hundreds of Deans began to appear around the room. They were all dressed in the same green jacket and blue jeans and lay on the ground, blood spilling about them. Dead. “They all were.”
Cas slowed down a moment, but Dean was too distracted with the idea that he had to constantly be moving otherwise he would fall. Suddenly a whooshing sound came from in front of Dean and before he knew it, Cas’ arms were wrapped around his waist. Dean’s legs flung up, spread wide. Cas bent over backwards just in time for Dean to watch a knife narrowly sail overhead right between them. Dean went slightly cross eyed watching it until it whizzed and got stuck into a tree behind him.
She looked down into the purplish concoction and frowned before downing it. She dropped the bowl and gripped her head. Sam and Dean pulled Cas back, fearing what would happen if this failed. They would have to fight and that would not end well.
Cas met Sam in his room and they began the process of making his mixtape for Dean. Sam had some spare empty cassettes lying about and they grabbed one for the project.
Dean leaned in next to Cas' ear, "You know it's almost like I gripped you tight and raised you from the Empty."
They had defeated God. Jack had taken over his position, and they were finally free from the story. But they had lost Cas.
“Hey now,” Dean gently tilted his head up to look him in the eyes, knowing it meant Cas trusted him because he let him do so. “I’m still here. You didn’t kill me. You fought against her.”
He cringed and it hurt him, but he let the blade sink down into her chest. He watched the light go out of her eyes and more tears fell. He truly did miss her.
After a few more moments of drifting, Dean felt his feet hit solid ground. He looked around and everything appeared to be tinted a reddish orange hue. They landed beside a fiery river that was quickly making its way through the rocky terrain.
The dark shades of gray began to lighten until the room around them was almost glowing. They were in a large office, one wall filled with shades of pink, blue, and purple.
“How long did you stand here?” Cas asked, breaking the silence that had formed between them as they watched the scene.
Dean had tried to run forward to stop him, but Sam had pulled him back. He had called out, but it was too late as they were pushed through the portal. Dean remembers that fleeting moment of hope when Cas appeared through the portal with enough time for Sam to call out his name before Lucifer appeared.
They walked until their feet were sore and Dean had to pull Cas to a stop. “I think we need to rest.”
“I’m not sure. Perhaps this is some type of dream or alternate reality. Is there anything this reminds you of?” Cas also looked around.
They moved from the seats to a place beside Dean on stage as he pointed at the girls. “Do they do that in the show?”
His hand cradled Cas’ head as he laid him down. Dean took a shuddering breath as he stared at him for a moment before he stomped away looking for a sheet.
Dean opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out. He had no answer that wouldn’t give himself away -- that he wanted to see how Cas was doing, that he enjoyed seeing him in his element, that he cared how he was doing at his job, that he was nervous to go inside.
His hands shook, but he forced himself to continue. Castiel deserved a proper send off and Dean was going to make sure he got it.
“We should treat this like Purgatory. Let’s keep moving and hopefully we’ll find the end. There has to be a door out of this place if we walk through. I think that’s how it worked in the book though I didn’t get very far.” Dean gruffly explained as they continued to walk.
She looked up at where he stood above her. “Don’t do this to me. Don’t gut me like they did,” not-Charlie pleaded.
The pair then stood outside a Gas N’ Sip. Dean knew immediately what memory they were in. The Impala sat several feet away, and Dean leaned up against it staring inside the building.
He looked back at Castiel laying on the bed. If his eyes drifted slightly down to the exposed chest, no one around would be the wiser.
Dean didn’t know what to do. Ever since thinking he had lost Cas in Purgatory, he had never felt this type of loss. His hurt was only built up over the years.
“No, Cas. I need to tell you. I love you, too. I think I knew for a while, but I didn’t want to think what that would have meant for us,” Dean said, looking earnestly into his bright blue eyes. At some point in the past several minutes, Sam had disappeared to some other part of the bunker.
All at once it ended in a small pond. There were no monsters in sight, but there was a door a few yards away.
Cas sheathed his blade and walked back over to Dean. He began to check over Dean’s body as if he feared he had been hit. “Are you alright?”
Dean stared at his feet, blinking back the tears that were looming behind his eyes. “He sacrificed himself.”
Chopping wood was a good way to get out his anger. Sam and Jack helped a bit as well, but they mostly left Dean on his own, knowing he needed space.
“Now for your side of the bargain?” She waited a moment as they walked over to Cas who began to sit up.
Dean had powered through fighting Chuck, but after he collapsed on his bed and sobbed. He couldn’t take the idea that the angel he had known for over a decade was gone. He needed time to mourn. Jack had disappeared and everyone had come returned so that was a good sign things were going back to normal.
He continued to stare at his feet. He didn’t want to look at Sam and see the judgement in his eyes. Silence fell in the room before Dean continued, “I couldn’t tell him how I felt.”
Cas flattened it on the table between them. “I know Dean really enjoys Taylor Swift, so I decided to make him ‘Cas’ Top 13 TSwift Traxx.’” Cas once more made air quotes.
ready to find out what was happening with Percy and Annabeth, hoping they were alright, Cas’ presence beside him only slightly distracting.
Dean stood, and the pair linked hands again as they continued to follow the path of the river winding through the monster infested world.
“I thought you might say that,” Sam grinned and Dean narrowed his eyes. “I brought something to help with your decision making.”
Sam, assured that Cas would be alright, walked to the table where they had created a mixture that would hopefully put the Empty to sleep. It had come from an ancient book Rowena had left behind, and they were assured by the many warnings surrounding it that the sleep would be fatal and must only be used in the worst cases. Sam grabbed the bowl and handed it to her.
“It’s good, Cas,” he laughed a little. “I don’t know when I’m going to listen to it, but thank you for the thought.”
Cas sat down, his coat crumpling and his heat pressing against Dean’s side. It was a queen size bed, but they were next to each other with no space between them.
Cas pulled the mixtape out of his pocket. Dean’s eyes tracked the movement and saw it when he held it in his lap. Cas looked down at the title on the side for a moment longer before he handed it over to Dean.
Dean blushed thinking about how different this other version of Cas is and looked to the Cas beside him to see how he felt. “He’s right,” he said softly. “I’d die for you. I already have.”
When he ran into Sam after, he could tell his brother sensed something wrong. He didn’t mention it though, figuring Dean would come to him if he needed.
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed. “There was nothing I could have done. You were dead the second she went out that window.”
“You know you can ask for help now though. Right, Cas?” Dean turned to him. “We’re family. We’re always going to help you figure out a way.”
“My point still stands. It can’t be a white flag because it would just look like you’re surrendering if you ever went to battle. So what would it look like?”
He found the dining room table and that seemed as good a place as any, it was large enough to hold him. With one hand, he held Cas’ body close as he brushed everything off with the other. He didn’t care as the items all went flying to the floor. It’s not like anyone would be living here.
He closed his eyes and prayed to Cas as if he could still hear him. He prayed for strength. For the will to go on. For love.
Dean and Cas paused and looked at each other cautiously. “Do you think this is the way out?” Dean said, hardly wanting to believe it would be that easy.
Dean squishes his way to the sidewalk. He’s vaguely aware of a man watching him intently as he staggers off the road, a man who leaves hastily when Castiel strides back, tan coat billowing. Something about the guy bothers him, but the amused look on the Angel’s face drives it out of his mind.
“Henry died, and Roman has dementia. When Naomi took over, she didn’t understand how it worked, and because the secret was so well kept, she never had a chance. When angels got hurt, she replaced parts and broke the binding by accident.”
“So, you left because you loved a boy and they hated it, you’ve told me that much. Why are you back?”
Dean grins while taking a big bite of a twizzler, chewing with his mouth open. “Don’t worry, Sammy. We won’t let her get you.”
“Be safe,” Castiel murmurs against his lips. “Come back to me in one piece. We have unfinished business.”
He raises himself up on his knees, a cruel smile playing on his lips. He keeps going, slowly sliding Dean’s cock out. His eyes flutter just a little at the tortured sob that escapes Dean when he’s done. Castiel inches upwards until he straddles Dean’s chest, looking down at him.
He snorts. “Over dramatic King, Wallachstein. Don’t you forget it, or you’ll go back to the dungeon.”
Dean rubs his forehead. “It’s about money. They get paid millions so the army and the police don’t have to fight monsters. Dad must have wanted to release you all, and she held him to stop him, even when he wouldn’t tell her what she was doing wrong. Castiel, I… I’m so- I…”
She smiles the secret way adults do when they think you’re going to learn a lesson that they’ve long since worked through. Except he knows already what she’s thinking, and she’s so wrong. If only he could tell her.
Her smile is brittle as she goes back to Ketch’s side. “His Grace is welcome, of course, as our guest. We apologize for the assumptions we made. He can take the Rose Room. But, sweetheart, do try to come to terms with this. This isn’t the end of the world. Your father is dead, and it’s sad, of course it is. I loved him dearly and I will miss him. But his father died, as his father before him. It’s how things are, especially for someone so brave. He always fought alongside his own men, it was going to happen eventually.”
The limo travels over the bridge that spans the great gorge containing the river Ivlis, bisecting the city. Where Dean and Cas swam in it as kids, Ivlis is large but manageable, but here it churns angrily, flowing from a beautiful but deadly waterfall. The church attended by the royal family is up a steep incline, built on top of a massive cliff across the gorge, facing the falls. Clouds gather overhead, the formerly sunny day slowly turning dark.
Castiel stands and stretches. “Well, then. Let’s retire to my hotel suite and we can come up with a plan of action. Ketch isn’t going to kill us there, at least not until we’re asleep, so we have a few hours.”
She cringes away from him, shouting, “So what if we do?! This is a noble goal and there will be some sacrifices, there has to be! Nothing worthwhile is free!”
Cas offers a hand this time and Dean takes it, getting himself to his feet, wincing at the twinge in his shoulder. “If that’s what you want, but they’ll come for me faster than you’d like.”
Sam plugs in a string of purple and orange lights, and holds out the other end for Cas to start hanging them.  “What about the guy playing you?”
Cas moves to stand next to him. He’s warm, and too close. “You look like Dean Winchester. In the movie. He made you look exactly the same. The two of you really need to see it.”
Bruce Willis is driving fast and emoting with his eyebrows by the time Cas folds down carefully to sit cross legged on the mattress, carrying beer and one of their small mixing bowls. He passes Dean a beer, his attention on the screen.
Dean drops the baseball on the bed and gets up, smoothing out the tuxedo. His lips still burn from the kiss, the first kiss he’d ever had, stolen right here in this room only moments before his father came in and nearly caught them.
“Well, he is. Besotted. All Gabe can talk about is how pissed their mother is that Cas isn’t ever coming back to marry a nice rich girl.”
Dean makes a small anguished noise, half a sob, which makes Cas laugh. “Fuck, you are as sweet in your misery as I remember, my prince. Does it hurt?”
Dean flaps his hand in Sam’s direction and he nods. Dean expects him to slip back into the NET, but he just goes out the door, shirtless and barefoot.
Dean makes a ‘there you have it gesture’. “I don’t see how this is at all mocking my father. He died in a hunting accident, as well you should remember. You were there, weren’t you?”
Mary swallows, hard. “No, that’s… no. Our people are pure. There’s nothing to be afraid of, Dean, this will work.”
“Hey, I think the little guy asked the poor guy to marry him!” Everyone in earshot on the wheel cheers and claps. Dean hides his face.
Sam crouches next to him, looking up into his face. “Castiel knew what would happen, Dean. Everyone knew what would happen. We can’t give in.”
“So, you get a letter that just says ‘Poughkeepsie’, and you hare off home where they probably want to kill you or at least lock you up, without a real explanation. You owe me, Winchester. What in the hell is going on.”
"I wonder why the dream is always this lake,” he breaks the silence and forces himself to look away at the water turning the color of liquid gold as the dream sun continues to go down.
Dean takes his watch off and opens the back, revealing a small pentagram worked into a digital circuit. Introducing Rowena and Charlie had been a stroke of genius. He clicks a switch, readying the circuit for power, and then they start chanting together. When her voice cuts off, he continues, ending the spell as the translucent form of his best friend coalesces out of the watch.
“Look, you were gone! And Dad, he just went into overdrive. The Men of Letters got a foothold and they convinced him that the country’s troubles were because of blood purity.”
“I renounce it!” Dean, eyes glassy and crazed,   tries in vain to reach Castiel’s lips, whimpering for a kiss.
“This is a travesty! A mockery! The King lies dead and you have the gall to bring this foul thing you call a play here? How dare you? Where is the prince? Did he order this?”
When they were nine, escaping from the boring talk and oppressive formality of some occasion at the house, they’d hidden in that stall and found the trap door, the tunnel, and the small room on the other side. At first, they’d used it as a club house, storing comics and other contraband there; countless hours just doing their own thing. Then later, when they got older - Dean clenches his hands into fists against the surge of bittersweet memories.
“No.” Castiel is talking quietly to Gabriel, and Dean can only pay so much attention. He’s being fucked, and someone can see it, and suddenly he’s coming, convulsing in overwhelming ecstasy. Gabriel says something, whatever, he can’t hear it, but he does hear Castiel respond, and he’s calm, sounds collected, but he can feel the way his hands shake and grasp in his hair.
Dean opens his mouth, but John interrupts, his voice echoing against the stone. “Son. Walk with me.”
“Another reason I know that you trust Castiel is because I know for a fact that you’re training together. This... slick assassin look you have going on isn’t because you’ve been oh-so close with Ketch.”
Password. Castiel hadn’t set one, or he’d have warned them. So then, Dad set it. Dad knew that they’d be looking for him if they were accessing the memory, so he’d know he’d have been in trouble; dead or missing, so he’d need an escape…
Cas makes a noise of agreement. “She is correct, although Naomi can be quite inventive when she is displeased.”
Dean is exhausted. His head feels too big and he needs to lie down, but something about the dark bedroom waiting for him is unnerving. So, he just sits miserably watching them until Castiel brings him a blanket and makes him lie on the couch. All three of them move around him like a beehive, working together to set everything up. They call Charlie’s friend Rowena up in Scotland and put her live-feed on Sam’s tablet. Rowena’s brogue is soothing and Dean suspects she’d be hilarious to go out to drink with. He falls asleep watching the three of them argue about the best way to make a magic circle in the limited space.
Cas shakes his head, panicked. “You… oh Dean, you’re going to be so angry. You can’t kill him, he’s a Prophet of the Lord.”
His head breaks open like an egg, the warmth of his memories spread down his body, emotional rivulets that he tries to catch and keep in. This man can’t have him. Castiel is coming, he’s going to save him, and the sunrise will be in his hair and maybe this time he’ll kiss him for real, and … Dean thrashes, kicking.
Pausing to catch his breath at the edge of a quiet farm, he looks at the long road leading towards the next small village. This is where he needs to be extra careful. A quick look at his watch confirms that the train has already made it to the station after Littleton, even with the unscheduled stop. The Royal Guard will be going through the train, both to confirm that he was on it and to try to find him. Eventually, they’re going to catch on to his plan and come after him. If he’s walking along the road they’ll see him sooner rather than later; they have vehicles and he doesn’t. But if he goes into the woods, he’s absolutely going to have a fight. Possibly more than one. Werewolves have the teamwork of wolves with the strategy sense of a human, and if he’s not careful, he won’t come back out of the forest.
Dean sneers. He’s seen this look of furious disdain so often on his father’s face that he can replicate it without really trying. He registers Sam’s sudden intake of breath and the half step backwards as proof that he’s done it right. “You heard me. You pretender to the throne, you actually think I could rule with you by my side? You think that night meant anything? You’re a plaything. I need a real consort, not a man, especially not one that isn’t even human.”
Castiel, readjusting his clothing shamelessly, asks, “They nearly rioted when Mary married him. Do you think it will go that far this time?”
For the first time in ages, Castiel looks uncertain. “The public just got used to the idea that one of their noblemen is not entirely human.”
“If you are implying that I am afraid of falling off the ferris wheel, you can just forget it. I’m not scared of that thing!”
“But you kept the thing and told me stories every night about our vacation there. Like we were remembering this great trip we took. You - you made it so real. It was like our own private place we could go to when things got scary. We made up stories about it, like we’d just left. Dad wasn’t in any of them, just us. It made him really angry, and the more we did it, the more he wanted us to stop. Eventually you did, to get him off our backs, but I kept the picture. It helped me sleep at night.”
Charlie raises an eyebrow. “I know you’re not asking me to come all the way over here to talk about wineries staffed by monks. So I don’t get it. Why do assholes like us even do this job then?”
“You should do that, and then come out to talk to Sam.” Castiel heads past Dean, pausing only once to press his hand against Dean’s shoulder and squeeze.
“They collate lore, come up with cool new ways to fight monsters. We set up a place to train government agents of all kinds to spot them. Every now and then one of them gets a bright idea to infiltrate human governments. It’s most of what we as a country do for cash. It’s more lucrative than you might think. Plus, we export a lot of very tasty wine.”
Stripped to the waist as usual, Sam stands with one hand flat against the glass. In the darkness, the city lights play across his face, giving him an otherworldly look. Unlike his brother, Sam has no problem with tech, and all of it is blatantly on display, circuitry and magic at work under his skin. Dean thinks that’s most of the reason he goes around shirtless to begin with.
He goes to collect himself outside, walking around the back of the building where it’s darker, lit only by the occasional light attached to the building. He wishes that he had a cigarette, even though he hasn’t smoked in a long time. He could really use it to steady his nerves.
Dean groans, banging his forehead lightly on Cas’ thigh. With a tight smile, Cas packs up his things. “Ok, come on handsome, get up and buy me a cotton candy.”
“Mom doesn’t believe me about Ketch, and she’s all for the genocide of everyone with any drop of monster blood in their DNA. It was like she’d been brainwashed or something.”
He stops talking, breathing through whatever panic is running through his head. When he’s done, he grimaces. “I”m sorry. After they arrested my brother, I spent some quality time with his new and improved Men of Letters. It was... instructive. Come on out to the garage, your Highness. I’ll drive you.”
Dean chuckles as he pokes around the small space, lifting bottles and peering into vials. “I remember when this was your, like, private fort. Pillows and books and lame shit like that. This lab you made is cool. Does anyone know this is here?”
“I felt like I had to. It’s so eerie. It was like having some kind of flashback. Even the actors look just like both of you. I’m worried it’ll make your jobs harder.”
Confused, she tries to relax, but can’t quite seem to do it, shaking. He smiles up into her face, knowing that he looks deranged. “I am so sorry. You’re my mother, you were here to pick up the pieces, and I arrived here, shouting and stomping like a child. I’m unfit. Honestly, it would be a relief to let you take over.”
Dean ignores the sunscreen but takes the water absently, swigging it while he watches Cas laughing at something some guy in a car is saying.
Thunderclap. The lights flicker and go out. Dean can hear Castiel fighting to get to him, surrounded by Royal Guards who have reinforcements from outside. There’s a gurgling noise behind him as one of them falls, choking on his own blood. Sam is shouting at his mother.
Cas uses the leverage of the rock and buoyancy of the water to wrap his legs around Dean. “You could take me like this. I weigh nothing here.”
A hundred little things that remind Dean Castiel is not human happen every day, but they fade into the background. However, when he lifts twice his own weight in one hand, Dean would be lying if he didn’t say it skitters under his nerves.
The redhead from the elevator stands in the doorway, red and yellow striped pajama bottoms hang off her skinny frame. She has a t-shirt that reads “Save a Tree - Eat a Beaver”. It’s seen better days. From the hallway, Sam moves her into the apartment and then shuts the door, talking to someone on his comm as he does.
He stays, crouching next to the bed as she gets up to leave. At the door she pauses, looking at him again. Her face is fond, loving, open. He aches for the child who once felt safe in her embrace. When she’s gone, he presses his face into the pillow that still holds Castiel’s scent and wishes he could smother himself with it. Instead, he screams and screams muffled rage into it until his throat is raw.
Castiel snorts. “Don’t bother. He’s been waiting for you. He arrives every night, thinking you would come here first. He hasn’t hurt me. He just waits. Scares the guards for fun, makes the equipment short out. No one can figure out whose ghost is haunting the old cells, as if it was a hard leap to make.”
Castiel raises an eyebrow. “There is an unprecedented amount of every creature, to be honest. The wolves around my home are no more numerous than any other place. The harmonious accord between your father’s hunters and the Men of Letters has been shifted. Nothing is getting done.”
In the wake of their exit, the brothers exchange a look, the only sound around them the labored noises from the fridge. It’s almost dawn and even the club has given up, everyone gone to bed or collapsed on a floor somewhere.
The play will be broadcast on every channel tonight, and the radio as well, by royal command. It’s a brutal move, but Dean has romanced the networks enough that they don’t seem to mind the heavy hand. He’s also managed to get a few networks in from other countries - a move that seems to have cemented his good intentions with both his mother and Ketch.
Dean had put no effort or thought into a costume, determined not to wear one. He’s grumpy and tired, aching for the bunker and his own bed. He’s not sure why he’d insisted that he and Cas go as a couple, but he knows now that he is, in fact, a moron. He can’t stop thinking about it. Getting far away from the influence of the demon will fix all of this confusion. He doesn’t want a costume, he wants to be in the car, halfway down the highway already.
It’s left hanging between them. Angels who have grown past their programming are considered by H34V3N to be the dangerous and unpredictable. Dean can see their point - humans themselves are dangerous and unpredictable. But H34V3N has sold the concept of ‘Evil AIs’ to the public, and more importantly, to the government. The policy is to kill them, or to bring them back for study, but Dean’s never heard of the later happening. H34V3N, true to form, calls them Fallen. Fallen Angels. They’d become a bit of a guerrilla movement, joining groups of monsters and manipulating them into protective guards. It’s a mess.
Across the street and down a half block is the closest liquor store, open twenty four hours, and always doing a brisk business. He pauses once inside the door to run his hands over his face and hair to get the rain off, winking at Janice, the geriatric who works behind the counter on the night shift. Dean’s always suspected that she owns the place, actually.
After all the sneaking around, it’s strange to simply walk to the garage and get into Gabriel’s ostentatious Ferrari without a care who sees them. Then they take off at such a clip it would be impossible to see him regardless. Gabe turns on pop music at an obnoxious volume, making it impossible to talk, so eventually Dean gives up. He’s still tired from the syringe, the fight with Gabriel, and his own spiralling thoughts, so he slumps down into his seat and lets his eyes close. He drifts off, remembering a sun dappled afternoon so long ago it feels like a lifetime.
Castiel toys with a button on his trenchcoat. Dean watches, fascinated. It’s honest-to-God fidgeting and he’d never see Castiel do it in person. Just here, where no one is watching.
As children, he and the Duke played in the basement and attics long enough to know all their secrets. Ages ago, they’d found an ancient escape tunnel through the stables, and he prays that it’s still accessible. Just before he gets there, he runs out of cover, and is forced to run flat out for the building, heart pounding with overexertion and the fear of discovery.
Dean has no answer for that, so he stays quiet, listening to Castiel control his breathing. Shame, need, and unhappiness war with each other.
He doesn’t scream. He does nothing but wait until the only thing he can do is open his mouth obediently and allow him to push inside it. Castiel keeps pressing, inch by inch, until he’s firmly down Dean’s throat. Then his grip slacks, although the hand gripping his hair is still painfully tight. Eyes closed in bliss, Dean goes to work.
“Your father meant for all hands to be looking at it, I think, or it wouldn’t be hidden in such a ridiculous way. Anyway, it’ll be over before you know it. Just follow the script I wrote for you and we’ll both be fine. What I want to know is, what is that?” She points to the symbol etched onto the glass.
Slowly, he tries to get up again, waving off Castiel’s attempt to help. “The Fallen packed quite a punch. What the hell was he trying to do with my head?”
“Tilt your head back.” Sam moves around him to spray in the front. “This is the longest you’ve ever been with anyone. You have a reputation.”
He isn’t sure what to expect when he gets there. An empty room, maybe. Dean is not at all prepared to find it exactly the way they’d left it. Nearly a decade passed, and it is still the same. Castiel hadn’t done anything to it since he’d returned from University, other than keep it clean. There’s no cobwebs, no weird mold smell. Taking a minute, flooded with nostalgia, he absorbs the sight of everything - his bookshelves, still filled with every play Dean had been obsessed with as a teenager. The ancient oil lamp, filled with oil. The bed, God, the bed. Dean lights the lamp, even though he’d almost be happier in the dark, and sets his flashlight down on the table.
“There, there, Mother! don’t cry. Your new husband will give you solace. Charlie, please, continue.”
Charlie curtseys. She looks strangely like his mother, and it makes him do a double take. He suspects she’s using magic with her makeup. Bravo. Loudly, he asks, “What is the plot of this play?”
“Listen, guys. We’ve been through some shit. The werewolf cult in Missouri, the Elvis impersonators, serial killing shapeshifters. Beckett... dinner theater. This thing I’m asking you to do is a direct stab at the heart of someone who is very, very dangerous.
Ketch sighs. “I am too generous with family, it’s long been a fault of mine. Bring them all with you, if you like, although I’m not sure that the next Duke will want to go to America and leave the Duchy in the hands of his cousin. I have no problem with Gabriel, he’s a good subject. Just do this, you will never have to see any of us again.”
Dean blinks. “Well, okay, we’re not rich. Dad’s missing, not dead, so his half of H34V3N is still his... and our salaries are crap.”
Ketch slips a proprietary arm around Mary, that fucking smile still on his face. “Oh no, I think what you mean is ‘Father’.”
In a whirl of cold air, Cas whisks through the door, slamming it behind him and leaning against it, panting. Dean bolts out of the chair, and Sam pulls his knife.
Jealousy rears its head again, but he pushes it down. “No. We’d be in America right now if it wasn’t for Dad.”
She smiles, tiny wrinkles at the sides of her kind eyes. “Are you ready to come downstairs now, young man?”
He still feels like a coward, even more so that he is a mere thought away from just getting on a plane and leaving forever.
He peers out the window at the night sky. Yeah. The old man’s vindictive streak would have appreciated Dean’s determined trek home through the woods during a full moon to confront his mother over this. The journey won’t be anything but fun, his father’s version of fun, that’s for sure. He checks to be certain his rifle is secured and easy to reach. Pulling the emergency cord, he forces one of the doors and jumps out of the train even as it’s still rolling to a stop.
The door opens and shuts spasmodically, the light within the elevator’s shell a dull hellscape-red from the emergency lights that somehow have never burnt out. A young homeless net-rigger had settled in it ages ago, slowly transforming the tiny space. Now, thick wires run over the inside like well organized tentacles, monitors mounted on all three walls. She reclines in a beanbag chair, criminally thin, her arms filled with illicitly modified ports with thin wires like veins snaking out of them. No one will ever chase her out or fix the elevator, and he’s kind of happy she’s found a place. Like most net-riggers, she does something complicated and illegal, but it could be anything, really; he can’t understand half of what she says on any given day. Dean jerks his chin in greeting and she does the same, red hair falling in her thin face, her eyes glowing in the gloom. Watching as he goes down the stairs.
Dean’s hands ache to strangle the breath out of her. He smiles at her with a mouth that wants to spit, looks at his mother with eyes that see through a veil of black despair. His voice, though, is steady, and he blesses every acting teacher he’s ever had.
If he’s going to go the sane route, he needs a vehicle. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have money to pay any of these farmers for their cars and he is not stealing from his own subjects. He could ask to borrow one, but revealing himself would be a mistake and embroil some poor farmer in his family drama. For a moment, he allows himself to wallow. Maybe he should wait for the Guard, just turn his cellphone on and let them track him. He runs his hand through his hair and it catches the light, the sparkle of fire on one of his fingers plays with the moonlight. Dean shakes himself out of it. Someone else is depending on him getting through this. Mouth tightening into a hard line, he drops the pack on the ground and squats next to it.
Roughly nudging Dean’s legs apart, he wastes no time, pushing into his sore, used ass. It hurts more than he imagined it would. He wants - he needs more time to get used to it, but Cas ignores that, fucking him slow and deep, holding him in place with one hand firmly wrapped under and around his throat.
“Yeah, okay, you’re here.” Gabriel’s voice is soft. Dangerous. “There’s a lot we should talk about. Uhm. Where is ‘here’, by the way?”
The release of pain is so sudden that he collapses with it, sliding down the wall. Castiel crouches next to him. The lights here weakly come to life, leaving everything in a dim glow.
Sam takes him by the shoulders and shakes him a little. “Then go ask him. Right now, ringless and everything. You have to tell him how you feel.”
Castiel nods. “The same, every time I have been in it, though with slight variations that I suspect depend on mood.”
A low wail echoes through the hall, raising all the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck. His skin crawls at the look on the apparition’s face. It mimics the rage he had in life; a rage far too often focused on his son. He should run, but he’s paralyzed with fear.
She brushes his hair out of his face. He grabs her hand, sitting up. “What’s going to happen to him now, mom?”
He gets too close and Cas punches him in the face, light and fast, jeering at him. The rage simmering under his skin boils out of him as he tries in earnest to kill Castiel. They fight across the hallway, punching and kicking until Dean knocks him off his feet, and for a heady, drunken moment, he has his hands locked around Cas’ throat. Then somehow he finds himself on his stomach with his arm wrenched painfully backwards, Castiel pressing one knee into the small of his back.
Gabe snorts, gently pushing up on Dean’s jaw to close his mouth. “Take your shirt off, genius. And don’t forget sunscreen.”
“You will, when you’ve had enough. And I don’t suggest that you try to repeat slander like that to your mother. She’s very touchy right now. I don’t think she’d believe you.”
Dean reaches for his coat, checking to make sure his gun is secured in the holster. “It won’t work, not immediately or completely. The building has a shield around it, so you will get the angels outside. Sam and I will go take it down. Ladies, you got this?”
Dean eyes the laundry pile dubiously. It’s impressive, but the laundromat is even worse than their apartment; not air conditioned, filled with hot air, and boring. They’ve been avoiding it all week.
Helpless laughter bubbles up from inside him and he can’t hold it in. It frightens her more that the fist he has clenched, more than the knife easily within reach in his boot. He advances on her. Mary scrambles away from him until her legs hit the bed and she sits hard. Crouching next to her, he takes her hands, stroking them gently.
“Mother, Mother, Mother. You’re right, of course. I can see it now, fuck, how deluded I’ve been.” He kisses the back of each one gently.
Cas just looks at him. Dean points at the giant spinning top. “How about the Gravitron? It’ll be fun. You can slide up and down on the wall.”
It hurts, like nothing else. Not any monster claw or bite, no bullet or burn he’s ever had compares with the white-hot cold of Mordavian steel slicing through him. His blood runs, hot and fresh down the altar, dripping down the steps to pool into a small lake of red. Ketch pulls the sword out of him and draws back his hand to do it again.
Ketch is on his feet, stumbling away and grabbing one of the swords from the wall. Mitch slumps into the pew and then slides to the ground, life blood spraying from his neck across Castiel, the floor, and several people huddled behind them. Mary grapples with Sam, every inch of her father’s daughter as she fights fiercely to subdue her son. Dean grabs a sword from the other side and stands to face Ketch, a grim smile etched onto his face.
The orchard’s quiet is pensive, the twisted trees heavy with apples. His footfalls are muffled on the soft grass. A mist starts rolling in, low to the ground. Every step drags him forward to the center of the orchard where the first tree planted here grows. It’s well over a century old, living far past the normal age of any apple tree. He looks up at it uneasily as he gets close. It towers over him, the trunk thick and scarred. Abruptly dizzy, Dean reaches out to steady himself on it, his mind filled with a memory he’s helpless to stop.
His cell phone beeps and he looks down. “Ah, that’s Mick. Sorry, Son, you know how it is. All work and no play. This has been lovely, we should do it again.”
Dean can’t help the bark of laughter, unwise though it is. “Oh god, fuck you. I didn’t kill you, you pushed me away.”
“Right on the heels of the festivals for the Royal Wedding. How is a party going to help us, like, at all?”
“Well, he’s not happy. He keeps saying some garbage about you coming to rescue him. I tried to tell him that you could give a shit, but he won’t hear it.”
Instead, he’s already decided to get off the train early and hike through the countryside until he reaches the Wallachstein Estate and set up camp there. It will be easier to figure out his next move when he’s amongst friends.
Dean strokes her hand, rests his cheek against it. Her fingers are cold. “Allow me to give you a present, Mother. You and Arthur. Let me show him that I accept him as a stepfather, as my monarch. In The States, I was part of a theater group. Instead of crowning him tomorrow, let me arrange the usual celebrations, and at the end I will crown him myself. Please, I am so sorry.”
Charlie holds up her hand, barging forward with a question despite Sam’s glare. “I just don’t get why they wouldn’t know what to do with the angels. Wouldn’t the techs know how to keep them in line?”
Dean claps Sam on the shoulder. “He made it so we couldn’t solve this without each other. Go get your picture while these two ladies figure out how to get the image out of my head.”
The low, husky rumble comes from the corner near the bed where the unmistakable figure of Castiel sits in the dark.
There’s a pounding on the door. He shakes his head, refusing to acknowledge it, hoping it’ll go away. Cas makes a noise.
Nonchalantly walking along the opposite edge of the store, he keeps an eye on them through the mirror. The girls are grabbing bottles and wrenching them open, drinking a few swallows and then throwing them on the ground, laughing when they shatter. Other customers go running out the front, leaving the place almost empty. Dean searches out the leader again and their eyes lock. He’s quiet, watching Dean, standing stock still as people run around him, chased by the women and the chortling fool. The fool’s movements draw Dean’s eyes away because he’s headed to the front.
Once he’s gone, Castiel pulls back a little so he can look in Dean’s face. The screaming pain in his head has subsided enough to think. He doesn’t do much of that, though, because Cas is suddenly kissing him. It’s gentle and brief, but wonderful, a brush of the lips. It lingers even after he’s stopped, tingling, delightful and sweet. They both start talking at once.
Dean opens his mouth to answer, struggling against the force pinning him. The King leans close, the smell of rotten flesh filling Dean’s nostrils, making him gag.
Dean doesn’t know if Gabriel stays. He doesn’t care. He’s floating without air, beyond the need for it now, just a receptacle for Cas’ cock, and that’s all he wants to be. Cas fucks him and fucks him. His ears ring. He can’t see. Then Castiel is coming in a hot flood vicious flood. It’s perfect, it’s too much, Dean swallows what he can, the rest spilling out and over his chin, down his throat.
“A strategy meeting? I’m happy to come when you call, but now I have to make up a log about a strategy meeting.”
Dean points, nods. “Yes, her too. This play, if you do it right, will get him off his guard. It’ll make his supporters nervous. It might mean, that when it's time to strike, he’ll be less defended.”
The Duke has been maintaining it, it seems, because it swings wide with no noise. Dean slips through it and into the tunnel without incident, closing it behind him. Climbing down the ladder in the dark, he lets his eyes adjust. It’s cool here, almost chilly. He shivers in the dark, flooded with memory. Letting muscle memory take over, he starts walking, thinking about the Duke. About Castiel.
“Perhaps. I certainly seem insane, but wait until the wind changes. I won’t seem quite so mad then.”
Sam looks disturbed, his eyes suspiciously shiny. “When-when we were kids you found this postcard. It was a tourism ad, really, for some tiny place in the mountains. But it was so pretty. You asked Dad if we could go and he was-”
Dean reaches into his pocket for the small flat rock he just knows is there and withdraws it, skipping it along the placid water. When he looks back, he finds Castiel watching him.
“I know. Believe me, I know. Right now, though, my father is dead and I have to figure out if I want to care about it enough to take my throne back, or if I just want to come back to the States.”
Castiel crouches in front of him, cradling the side of Dean’s face in his large hands. Warmth spreads from his touch, easing some of the pain, chasing the confusion away. Gasping, grateful tears in his eyes, Dean grabs onto Castiel’s wrists for dear life.
“I don’t understa- oh. I see. ‘I know when you’re sleeping’. You should give up hunting and take to the stage.”
The neighborhood gave him the willies, and not just because of the Succubus. Honestly, even after Cas’ dire warnings, he was still secretly starting to think that they should let her have the place. Everyone here seemed happier and more relaxed due to the weekly semi-orgiastic partying.
“Except I don’t recall this day, not even a little. I don’t have any memories of a day at any pond as a kid. Our dad was more about teaching us to shoot and timing us as we cleaned a rifle. We never went on trips like this.” Dean shifts and looks at his hands.
Everyone gathers around and Sam holds the tablet with Rowena on it up so she can see. The images are definitely different, but Dean has no idea what he’s looking at. Castiel and Charlie do, however, and they’ve already begun communicating about it. Mostly without talking, which they’ve started doing the last hour, and is really making him uncomfortable.
Castiel looks back at him mildly. “I have no concept of humor, Dean, but if I did, I would be a poor friend to laugh at your harassment and the feelings of loss it must evoke. I need to attend to Sam. The newest attempt by H34V3N’s labs to capture a werewolf seem to have worked, but should they awaken unexpectedly, he’ll need assistance.”
Okay, it’s not cool, but he’s going to think about it later. Summer is almost over, and he wants to have fun.
“You know, you’re both cute and all, and whatever is going on here is very sweet, but you should lock the door, you’re just asking for trouble.”
He starts forward, but Cas’ hand squeezes, and he stops. Ketch laughs. “Still held in thrall by this creature, I see.”
He doesn’t miss the face Sam pulls and a load of pressure eases up under his skin. They aren’t together. He’s not interested in Cas. Dean can’t help the slow grin that creeps over his face and it makes Sam turn a bright red.
Sam makes a distressed noise, “C’mon you guys, why do you always do this when I’m around? Fine, yes, whatever. I’ll see you next month. Don’t break the country while I’m gone.”
“Better. Ok, Dean Winchester, will you be my husband, even though neither of us will ever be rich, and even though my brother will doubtlessly get drunk enough to hit on your brother during our wedding reception?”
Dean looks around the room. Kevin and Charlie are the last to arrive and they’ve brought a pile of pizza. Cas would love the life he’s built for himself, he’s sure of it. “What about Sam? And Gabriel?”
Mary pushes him away, walking away. “I am done with this nonsense. I’m going to crown him King, Dean. You can either step down willingly, or stay in custody until I’m done and then get exiled right back where you came from. He’s going to fix all the wrongs your father let sit and fester.”
A few minutes later, Gabriel comes down the stairs, alone. His blonde hair is lank and tangled as if he hasn’t bathed or stopped running nervous hands in it for days. Aside from being a bit older than Dean remembers, he’s a familiar and friendly sight. Dean goes to embrace him, but Gabriel takes a step back, eyeing him.
The idea, though, worms its way under his skin. His father would want him to do it himself. He’d want Dean to hunt him like a feral vampire and cut him down. But he’s not a murderer, and his mother - God, what would she think?
Dean sighs, watching Charlie boss everyone around. “Soon. Soon, head on a swivel. There’s a non trivial chance that he might take it for what it is.”
Dean bangs his head against the mattress once. “It isn’t. It never is. It’s your brother, and he wants to show us some disgusting new trick he learned, or he’s like, really drunk, and he’ll throw up on the floor and pass out on our bed.”
A blur goes by as Sam runs down the dock and jumps, cannonball style into the lake, drenching them both. Sputtering, Castiel breaks out into laughter.
There’s a pause, as if the world itself were going in slow motion. Ketch looks up at Dean in surprise at the same time that Castiel lets out a pleased shout, grappling with Mick who has a sudden glint of steel in his hand. The walls of the church seem to vibrate with the force of a booming thunderclap just as Dean, the crown raised up high, brings it down across Ketch’s face. Sam dives for their mother, grabbing and holding her fast.
Dean putters around for a few more minutes -- makes Cas drink a glass of water and then refills it to set on the side-table. Waits until he's sure Cas isn't going to puke again and then coaxes him into taking a few aspirin. Then they're all in bed, Dean laid out next to Cas and holding very still, and the lights are off.
Dean nods and then swallows and then shakes his head. He takes a step closer, brackets his other hand at Cas’s other elbow. “Thank you,” he says softly.
hope you enjoyed these dumb, dumb idiots as much as i did writing them. hope, even more, that you and all of yours are safe in these times. as always, please let me know what you thought!
A moment later, or maybe it’s an hour, or maybe it’s a second, Sam is at his side and holding onto his shoulders. “Dean, c’mon,” he’s saying. His words are waterlogged. “Please, Dean…”
“I’ll talk to you later,” Dean says, catching himself at the last moment so he doesn’t say “tomorrow.” In all honestly, they will be talking tomorrow, but it feels presumptuous to say so.
Dean huffs an amused sound, almost a laugh, and slings his arm up, over Cas’s shoulders. “Pretty nice, huh?” he says, lifting his chin to indicate the spread of the horizon, the mountains, the trees. Or maybe just the whole of the night, the road-trip. The empty road with no destination before them. The two of them standing in an empty field to the side of Route 19.
And here, in a dim corridor of their home, Dean has his hand on Cas’s elbow and Cas is looking at him with some kind of certainty. “Dean,” he says and god, his voice, Dean didn’t think he would get to hear his voice again either, “are you all right?”
The car is still running, thrown into park at an angle up against the bunker’s entrance and once they’re inside, both Jack and Sam are screaming for Dean and Cas. Sam is sure that he’s going to find Dean’s phone on the floor, shattered, with all those messages and calls collecting, just like Eileen’s. He doesn’t know what to expect of Cas.
Despite the truly annoyed tone to Sam’s words, they do manage to loosen Dean’s spine. His baby brother is right. And maybe if he just accepted that it would be a little weird at first and just breathed through it…
Amanda, fresh off break-up number five of the year, all but melted. “Oh no, honey, not at all. They go completely under so your little sweetie won’t feel a thing.”
Some small part of Dean, the part that was still a four year old crying for momma, a sixteen year old who wanted to go to a dance, a twenty-six year old looking at his brother and admitting that he didn’t want to be alone, that piece of Dean wanted to scream yes. Wanted to sink, relieved, into Cas’s arms and nod against the smoke-scented pocket of his lapels and sob out a chanting litany of
Sam is pretty sure he didn’t even know Cas was a single father until they had been working together for, like, five months and now he knows the kid’s pre-nap routine.
They kiss and it’s not the apocalypse, or Dean on his own, or Sammy dead, or desaturated monster thunderdome or heaven, or hell, or leviathans or suburbia. It’s just them. Just Cas’s hands holding onto his head, fingers digging into his hair and just his shoulders dropping back against the shitty motel bed and just their chests dropping together, their thighs skimming. Dean has a mess of bruises along his back and the bandage over Cas’s palm is catching in his stubble but neither of them care, neither of them stop or stutter or pull back.
Because Dean shuddered through an inhale and ducked his head and Cas said his name and Dean stuttered something about a shower and then…that was it.
“Please,” Dean repeats into his mouth. Dean loses track of time and falls asleep between one kiss and the next.
Dean stops at the Impala to dig a pair of sunglasses out of the glovebox for Cas. Cas thanks him, quietly. They walk to the diner together, hands almost brushing. They sit on the same side of the booth, across from Sam, legs pressed together. Cas can't say if it's the coffee or the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, or those points of contact that soothes his hangover.
His brother leans one hip on the counter. “Well, what do you think we should be doing? If you stop Ketch, you have to take the throne. Are you prepared for that?”
Cas is in his face, now. He smells good. So very good. It’s mesmerizing and he imagines now that he knows how a mouse feels in a snake’s grasp. “You’re lying to me. Or you were lying to me then. Do you even know how to tell the truth anymore, your Highness?”
There’s laughter and applause from below, and a ripple of noise. He closes his eyes, lungs burning, drifting back into the fantasy. He’s on stage, being fucked for everyone to see, mouth wide, throat bulging with the Duke’s cock. He can feel that Castiel is close. He lets the bad air out of his nose slowly, but his lungs are emptying, and he starts to panic.
Rowena laughs. Charlie scowls, making her laugh harder. “You believe in demons, child, but not angels?”
“I’m not… “ He pushes Tad forcefully into a seat, but somehow the guy’s arms are wrapped around his neck, and he pulls Dean in, reeking of vodka. “Wearing… a costume, Fuck, let go, already!”
The house lights dim and Garth, dressed as a jester, comes out into a spotlight to begin his monologue. Quietly, Dean mumbles something about a restroom and creeps out of his seat. Sam glares at him, but doesn’t make a move to stop him. He opens the door without making a noise and slips out of the box, hurrying through the empty lobby, around to the other side. As he’s creeping into the Wallachstein box, he chances a look up. Sam is glaring at him, but thankfully, no one else seems to have noticed. Ketch is glued to the stage, a faint frown on his face. Dean shrugs at his brother helplessly, and drops to the floor next to Cas’ chair.
Mary beams at him, but Ketch’s eyes are puzzled now, calculating. Dean has to speed this up or Castiel is going to do something impulsive, he can see it in the way he’s licking his lips, the shift of his hips and his hands. Sam brings Dean the crown and stands behind him, arms clasped behind his back.
“Dad knew something was off over there,” Dean mutters, massaging his temples. “Right after all that crap with Grandpa Henry’s will was settled, he got all weird.”
Traffic starts again, eerily silent and fast. He’ll never get used to electric cars. The bots are suddenly everywhere around him, blaring questions, some of them calling him by name. They talk rapid fire, overlapping each other. The noise is incredible.
“What makes you think that I care what you do with the Duke? He means nothing to me. I never came back for him, if you don’t recall.”
He kisses him again. “Tonight, there is a meteor shower. You will lie on the grass with me under the stars, and neither of us will see it.”
As predicted, it’s a drunken Gabriel, along with a crowd. Ignoring Dean’s angry protest, he pushes through into the apartment, a steady stream of their (also drunk) friends following him. Gabe bounces his eyebrows at Dean, giving his boxer-shorts-only outfit a leering look. Someone turns on the lights, and someone else changes the movie, and the night is over. Whatever it was going to be.
Dean turns the wheel, wincing when it makes a low creaking noise that sounds much louder in the tunnel. Peeking around shows a hallway devoid of people. The door lets out past all the entry guards, which was handy when two hormonal teenagers were looking for a place to be alone.
When they break out of the trees and into the clearing, it is entirely worth every second of the confusing and bug-filled walk. Water from a mountain-fed river diverts here, flowing down through the cleft of ancient glacier-rock, making a waterfall that falls into a pool, just about waist deep. The water is clear and sweet, and all the rocks around the pool are large and flat, inviting to sit on. It’s also completely deserted.
“I am going to kill that smug asshole,” he manages through his grinding teeth. “And I don’t get it, that’s not how succession works.”
Though panic beats through his veins, he keeps to his training, quietly and quickly making his way through the stupid old arched stone dungeon. Despite the attempts to turn it into an actual prison, it still looked as though he was on a movie set. He feels like that little kid again, huddled with Sam and Cas in a freezing, unlocked cell, exhausted and scared. The only way open to him is the same then: Forward. By the time he finally gets to Castiel’s cell, about as deep in the place as they could put him, Dean is running, training be damned. He skids to a stop in front of the cell and if he wasn’t already breathless from running, it would be stolen by what he sees in front of him now.
A few hours later, the party is in full swing. Adults in the neighborhood here were wary at first when the “Colt” family moved in, but Dean just kept throwing parties, and soon polite BBQs had turned into all night affairs that usually ended up with at least one person naked in their backyard the next morning with a wicked hangover. Sam figured it was the influence of the succubus, and Dean wondered why they cared, because it looked like she was doing them a favor. Cas reminded him that she was just getting warmed up. Sooner or later someone would get badly hurt.
Dean sighs. “Well, I’m sure they offered him a pile of cash. It’s made nine hundred million already, and they made it on a shoestring budget. He’s gotta be chuckling out of the other side of that scruffy beard right now.”
He toys with Dean’s hand, moving the ring back and forth. “You still wear it. So I presume that your promise still holds. We have much to discuss, but tonight...”
He comes into the living room, balancing a plastic pumpkin, a real pumpkin, and a large salad bowl stuffed with bags of candy in one hand and in the crook of an elbow. The other hand, wrapped in a sling, is pressed uselessly to his chest. “Clearly, he didn’t believe us.”
Gabriel shies away from Dean’s touch as if it might burn him. “No. No, I’ll get you to the capital, to the palace, but you’re going from there on by yourself. This romantic notion of breaking Castiel out of jail is asinine, but I do suggest you try to see him alone before anyone knows you’re here. Once you make yourself known, Ketch will well, it’s impossible to know what the hell he’ll do, but I can guarantee it’ll be violent.”
He starts moving his hips once more in a slow rhythm punctuated by Dean’s own desperate gasps for air.
Dean had given him this mixtape filled with Led Zeppelin songs and he didn’t know what the proper next step was.
Cas took a step closer. “I can’t read your thoughts anymore, so I guess I’ll have to get used to hearing you say it.”
Cas gave him a look, “I don’t think either of us had any idea about any of this. That seems to be the point.”
He sat back down and picked the papers up again. “It feels right to try to live my life now. We earned it.”
Castiel came back to the bunker late one night and figured he’d see if Dean was still awake to check in. He had been away a few days and wanted to make sure their last hunt had gone well.
Cas sighed and used the hand not trapped in Dean’s to ruffle his own hair. “When you had been turned into a demon. Sam and I were worried about you.”
Dean frowned, but Cas turned to him, “You knew the risks of taking the mark. It was the only way. And hey, it all worked out in the end.”
Dean pulled back the sheet, revealing Cas’ face once more. It was still him. The face hadn’t magically changed while it had been under the curtain like the hunter had hoped.
Jack sat down to eat with them and told how he had reformed Heaven. He broke down the walls that separated people in their memories, allowing them to roam and be with the ones they loved. Jack explained how he made sure the vengeful spirits that rested on Earth like Kevin were let back in as well as folks like Bobby who had been barred as well. While he knew he wanted to be less hands on, he promised he would visit every once in a while to check on his parents as they grew old.
They laid together for a few more moments before agreeing they needed to keep moving and had stayed still long enough. They needed to get out before anything bad happened in the outside world or they got stuck here.
He walked up to the library to see if Sam was awake. He found him sitting at his computer with a few books surrounding him.
Cas laughed and shoved him backwards into his room and shut the door behind them as Cas’ mixtape swelled around them.
Dean looked up from under his eyelashes, a smirk making its way onto his face. “I couldn’t just let your gift go to waste now, could I?”
“I’ll help you. Meet me in my room in fifteen. Do you know what songs you want to include?” Sam’s smile had grown.
Cas tilted his head. “Your brother made me a mixtape with ‘Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx.’” He made air quotes around the title. “I have never received a gift before, so I assumed the appropriate response was to make one for him in return.”
Cas was by his side now though, and Dean wasn’t about to lose that. He grabbed Cas’ hand and pulled him along so they began walking. Dean didn’t have time to think about the significance of the move, only that he wasn’t about to let Cas get away from him this time.
“I was considering asking for your help,” Cas said, resting a hand on his shoulder. “But I feared I had already asked you for too much. I didn’t want to burden you with the war in Heaven, too.”
The two had moved to Dean’s room so he could show Cas his cowboy hat, putting it on and turning around to give him a full view. Cas nodded his approval and Dean’s grin somehow grew wider.
“I won’t hurt Dean,” Cas forced out. Dean could tell he was having a hard time, that something in Naomi was controlling him.
Dean’s eyes burned as he began to spread the ashes, watching them float in the air to softly land on the flowers like Cas was a blanket gently cradling the wildlife. The ash in the air seemed almost dreamlike as it drifted, spreading across the entire meadow. Cas wanted to see it all, Dean figured smiling a little to himself.
“He’s definitely not the example of health. Admitting he likes Taylor Swift could be a good first step.”
The lights blazed white and began to shift again, but Naomi seemed to shift with them. Suddenly they were in a room and Naomi was talking to Dean.
He took Cas’ hand nervously and their fingers intertwined. He looked back up into Cas’ eyes, and he felt a spark of hope light in his stomach. He knew he would be alright now. He had Cas back.
“I gave you some options to start out with. I wasn’t sure what exactly you would be interested in, but I tried to get a variety-”
“Cas, I-” Dean didn’t have anything that could live up to what Cas had just confessed to him. No words would be enough, so he used his actions. He leaned in, grabbed Cas’ tie, and pulled him close as he smashed their lips together.
The door was unassuming. If it had not been in this pit of misery, it could have belonged to any normal house or apartment. It stood alone, not against anything. It was a shining onyx with a brilliant silver doorknob. On the door were carved two letters in fancy script that wouldn’t be noticeable from farther away: D & C.
“Of a sort. I know what it feels like to be human, but the feelings I have for you are something stronger.” They took a step towards each other. “It feels like I have been waiting for you since I was created and now that I’ve found you I can’t lose you. I don’t know if that ever compares to human emotions, but I have learned what it is to feel because of you. For you.”
Dean sleepily nodded his thanks as he laid down on top of his jacket. He wasn’t expecting Cas to lay down behind him. As Cas laid down, Dean heard a rustling noise and he saw his wings unfurl and fold around the pair. They encircled them, hiding them from any monsters hoping to get a peak.
Dean knelt by his body, his eyes wandering around and landing on the sky above unsure of what he could do to fix this. There was no way to get Cas back. This seemed permanent.
Cas waited for another moment like the first, one that was calm and just between them. The night came soon enough as Sam and Eileen were on a hunt together a few days later.
Cas had never given a gift before and he didn’t want his first to be disappointing. He slipped his hand into his pocket to check it was still there. It hadn’t gone anywhere, but he still worried.
Sam pulled out some papers from behind his back, and Dean scooted across the bed to get a closer look. Sam handed them to Dean, and he flipped through. They were job listings for things he barely needed any qualifications for.
Past Cas walked up to the register. “Where is the pie?” Dean realized all his favorite items were in Cas’ basket.
Dean ran up and slashed its torso with his knife, letting it bend over in pain for a moment as they tried to figure out an alternative.
They were once more in what Dean assumed to be Heaven, but this time it was a room filled with books and Cas was sitting at a desk in front of a microphone with Metatron standing on the other side.
They grinned at each other, and Dean couldn’t believe how lucky he was to have this angel turned human standing in front of him loving him in return. He had always thought of himself as his dad’s blunt little instrument, but being loved by Cas helped him realize he could be more than that.
Dean hadn’t known what to say when Cas told him he loved him. It all happened so fast. One moment they were running from Billie and the next Cas had confessed, shoved Dean aside, and sacrificed himself to save Dean.
Their lips met and it was the nearly decade of time building up to this moment. Cas was reminded why he fell. This one human who was so lovable and now they were here, Dean wrapping his arms tight around Cas and pulling him closer as their lips continued to move. Betraying everything he knew for the one righteous man; his faith in Chuck failing, only to be replaced with the one true thing in the world: his care for Dean Winchester.
The next day, Sam planned a dinner for their small, found family. Eileen helped Sam cook as Dean and Cas played with Miracle. Once the food was ready, they sat around the table and thought about all those they had lost along the way to get to this perfect moment.
“Yeah,” Cas let out a sigh, his eyes still looking nervous as he searched Dean’s face as if he was going to see resentment or anger. “I did.”
“You’re hoping Castiel will return to you. I admire your loyalty. I only wish he felt the same way,” Naomi said.
Dean could reach out and touch them if he tried, and his hand was automatically doing so. His fingertip brushed one of the wings and they were softer than he anticipated. They felt like silk sheets, cool and inviting. Cas shivered at the touch and Dean backed his hand away. The wings were beautiful extensions of Cas’ body, and they seemed to move with him.
The fight switched to close range as their blades clashed. Cas’ wings strengthened as they acted like a shield. Gordon aimed low and Cas’ wing came between them, stopping the blade from stabbing him in the chest. It didn’t harm him, so Dean thought the wings must be made for battle, made for fights like this. He wondered why they weren’t visible in the normal world if that was the case.
They were so absorbed in one another that it never registered that the scene around them finally dissolved back into the hotel room they had been in at the start of their day. Their mouths continued to move, though no real conversation was had. Their bodies did all the talking for them.
“He told me he loved me, Sammy,” he choked out the words. “And I couldn’t do anything but get pushed aside and watch as the Empty took him.”
He punched the steering wheel. He slammed his hands down again and again, hardly knowing what he was doing but just wanting to get out his rage at the world. At Jack. At Chuck. At Lucifer. At himself.
“Come on, Dean. You don’t know already? What happened to your GED and give ‘em hell attitude. I thought you could figure it out,” she smirked at him.
Sam took Jack for lunch, but Dean went to the store. Dean bought urns for their ashes. He collected Cas’ ashes, sweeping them into the jar as tears rolled slowly down his face. This was all that was left. Nine years and some ashes.
“I remember Sam mentioned you liked one of her songs and that one time you were—.” Cas tried to rationalize.
Dean looked at the spell. There was a list of some basic ingredients they had in the bunker along with the incantation they had to read.
“Mornin’ sunshine,” Dean smiled. He could hardly believe he was happy at any point in this hellish landscape, but he had to admit he enjoyed spending his time with Cas.
Dean saw himself raking leaves and remembered that peaceful day when he was able to help out. He cocked his head, “Why--?”
Cas looked down at the cassette in his hands. The white lined square read “Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx.” He didn’t know what to say. “Thank you, Dean. I’ll listen to it tonight.”
The room darkened and the memories started to swirl around again as if the room was looking for one to show next.
Dean and Castiel had movie night every Friday. They took the night and Dean showed Cas the movies he loved. Sometimes Sam and Jack would join them, but sometimes it would be just the two of them alone in the dark room watching the flashing colors on the television together.
The brothers gathered the ingredients and soon enough they were set up and ready to perform the spell. They had agreed Sam would read the spell and Dean would be on standby to help out.
He looks up. Sure enough, at the top of the building, at least a dozen tiny round flying bots plastered with logos film every second eagerly. Dean flips them off, which gets an outraged squawk from Kevin in his ear. With a smirk, he circles to where the last were was-
“That’s none of your business, sweetheart.” Her voice is soft, her fingers mesmerizing in his hair. He could let it go, follow where she leads. Simply let her love him, accept what she’s done and move on. He could, but he’s done. His heart is broken open. Dean pulls away, stands unsteadily and faces her.
“Awesome. I’m going to tell Rowena the spell to boost the signal worked, she’s going to be so insufferable about it.” He can hear her grin as she talks and it makes him long to leave, go back to his new home and not deal with this.
Ketch… well, he doesn't so much smile as lift the corners of his mouth in an unpleasant and bloodthirsty way. Every alarm bell his father ever drilled into his being is going off, and he finds himself on the balls of his feet, ready to fight.
Tears fall down Dean’s cheeks. Castiel wipes one off delicately and plays with the moisture between two fingers. “You promised me your life. I went to my knees and begged you to marry me. You took my ring, my prince. You took it, and gave me a promise.”
Unsettled, Dean looks up at him. “You wait? Look, can you sit? No offense, but craning my neck to look up at you is weird.”
Dean’s head is pounding harder now, and he only really grasps what his brother is saying in bits and pieces. It’s too much. He kicks the table, sending food flying, startling Sam enough to make him back away.
“To get information on your relationship with Dean, I suppose, but that seems…” Sam trails off, lips pursed.
Sam pushes a greasy container of Lo Mein at him, but the smell of it nearly makes him hurl. Dean pushes it back towards his brother who levels a pissed look that would’ve flattened anyone who didn’t know him when he was in Middle School. As it is, Dean just gives him the finger.
His first instinct is to reach for his gun and shoot whoever it is, but of course, he’s unarmed. One of Cas’ hands slips around his own and he whispers into Dean’s ear, “Shhh, later.”
Dean feels an overwhelming sense of relief and grins tightly. “Sammy, oh God, it’s good to see you.”
“It’s a coup.” Dean feels like he’s running on a low battery, or wading through the bottom of a dim lake. “It’s a fucking coup. He’s - he’s taking over everything.”
Castiel stiffens and Gabriel groans out a whisper, “Get the fuck out of here, Dean, or I swear I’ll land in prison for killing you.”
Sam sighs. “I watched it on TV. C’mon, you know I’m at a crucial point here. I can’t just swan off whenever I want.”
“That it might be a memory. For instance, this dock is detailed down to the lingering warmth of what was clearly a very hot day. The condensation on the bottles of beer and coke in the cooler and the way the sunlight hits the water are all very detailed, but your shadow is too small and there are fishing poles for a lake without fish.”
Slipping through the hallways turns out to be easy, despite the ‘upgrades’ which appear to be new locks on the sturdy old jail doors. There are cameras, huge blocky things that look like they came out of a spy movie. The lights flicker as he goes and it doesn’t help the crawling sensation running under his skin. Every now and then, he swears that he hears footsteps that turn out not to be real. He’s so stressed that when he finds the guard station, he almost laughs out loud at how silly, how easy it is. The door is propped open, a lone guard who looks as ancient as the equipment he’s babysitting sits in front of a bank of monitors that switch views. He’s asleep at his post, snoring, head tilted at an uncomfortable angle. An open lunch box with a half eaten sandwich sits nearby. There’s a chair for another guard, but none in evidence.
“I know what you’re thinking.” She carefully starts plugging everything in. “These are huge. Antiques almost. The cases are, for sure. But you can’t beat these. Metal, strong. Durable. I’d go small, get myself a computer to fit in my palm, but then it would just get stolen.”
Dean nods, eagerly. Over eagerly even, desperate to have it. He wants Cas to take his throat, he’d give anything, everything he has or will have if he could only be made to take it, to feel him come.
“I mean, we even used it in some of our code words, not even a year ago -” Sam stops mid sentence and looks up at Castiel. They share a look of dawning comprehension.
Green-hair lunges for him and he fires again, dead on. He’s so close that he takes the full brunt of the splatter all over him. He can never get used to how cold vampire blood is, like dry ice, burning where it lands. The sheer amount of it on his exposed skin is doing its work, and he’s instantly high as a kite. Euphoric, he laughs as he wipes the gore off his face, heart pounding. He runs his fingers over his face, his neck. He’d get so much more of it on him if he just took off his coat. Fumbling with the sleeves causes him to slam one of his hands against the counter and the pain brings him back to the edge of reality.
Dean rips open a bag and starts pouring candy into the bowl, snagging a few for himself. “Yeah, yeah, okay. You’d think it would be easy to figure out which one it is. Like, a sex demon should stand out, especially here. Who knew these people could be so damn kinky.”
When they arrive at the hotel, there’s a smaller crowd of reporters. Dean’s heart leaps into his throat when he sees the armed and grim faces of a squad of Ketch’s Royal Guard. They sit inside the limo in pensive silence, looking out the tinted windows. Black vans drive up and park in front and behind them, trapping the car in place.
Surprising everyone, Castiel and Gabriel show up. Castiel looks dangerous, all in black and silver, his eyes intense and furious. Gabriel is laughing it up with celebrities, but always with one eye on his brother. His brother has both eyes on Dean.
Dean cups his hands under Castiel’s ass, drinking in the sight of him. Water droplets sparkle on his eyelashes, his dark hair is wet and curling around his cheeks, and Dean wants him. Cas is smiling, stress free for the first time in weeks, the relaxation reaching all the way to his eyes, blue and perfect.
Dean snorts, and Castiel turns his head, cracking an eye open to gaze at him. “Why are you trying to hustle us out of here so badly, anyway?”
Dean waves his hand. “Nah. People will forget it. Besides, there’s nothing like the real thing. Help Sam get ready for the party, huh? I’ll take care of the trick or treaters.”
Cas steers him towards it. They walk through the midway, different rock music pumping out of each ride, lights flashing. Teenagers in groups run from line to line. Dean dumps the remains of their snacks, and tries to get Cas to go on the Tilt-O-Whirl instead, but he’s firmly manhandled into the line for the wheel.
“Yes, alright. But go to my room, not the Rose Room. That room locks from the outside. You can call it a command, if you want, Wallachstein.”
He leans close into Castiel’s space. “Go home, you abomination. You’re a perversion of nature, and you taint the very air with your presence.”
What’s left of the Royal Guard, intent on swarming up the stairs, encounter Gabriel at the top of them with a pistol. The ones in the back pile into the ones in the front as they come to a skidding stop.
They pass into the entrance, and Dean pays. “Well, I’m ready to make some more. What shall we do first, gorgeous?”
Charlie and the rest of the troupe arrive on the second day of the festival. Dean’s commandeered the royal theater, attendance only by invitation. The performance, though, will be broadcast live so that the rest of the country can see it. She’s tired, but happy to see him, giving him a crushing hug.
at Lauren, she tells us later. He winked and asked, “How’re you doing, sugar, trying to steal my girl?” and, she tells us with a hand over her heart, she just about died on the spot.
“And now I’m saying come back with me.” Closing the distance, Dean drops the lube on the bed, half-forgotten and puzzles a palm against Cas’s cheek, one over his ribs. “Come back with me, come to the bunker. I can teach you to cook. We can set up your room or, fuck, you can stay in mine. With me. And you can be a hunter and help us or you...you can get a job at a freaking Gas-N-Sip in Lebanon, okay? Just…” his lets his sentence hang, feeling the frantic, desperate need eddying through his chest.
“Your brother’s nose is crooked,” Cas says with the same gravity as reciting biblical goddamn prophecies.
He and Jack end up skittering into the basement together, trailing a ragged, scorched scratch-mark on the wall. And then, they find him.
He does that, twice, and then showers and takes an extra long moment under the spray. The vacuum pound of the water around him makes the ache in his head abate a little. A hand to his jaw explores what Dean once called
“Oh my god, Jessica, there’s more than just gay and straight,” Amanda exclaims. Jessica rolls her eyes at the impending rant but keeps her mouth shut. She doesn’t have the energy to explain that, judging from the looks she saw on both Sam and Dean’s faces, she didn’t think Amanda, or any of them, had a shot no matter what gender they identified as.
“The Harvest moon.” And then he smiles back. He dances his fingers forward so they’re fully holding hands now. “We’ll have to be on the lookout for werewolves, won’t we?”
Cas, unfortunately, smiles serenely. He, unlike Dean, holds no suspicions about the Claire-and-Jack wonder-twin team-up. He’s elated that they’re getting along, that the girl who was the daughter of his vessel and the half-angel who imprinted on him in utero like a duckling have sibling bonded. “I would like that,” he says, tipping his head to Dean. “Just one drink couldn’t hurt, after all.”
Cas looks torn for a moment but a wordless whine from Claire seals the deal. He sighs and shoots a grateful smile across the connection. He has one hand raised, cupped around the back of Claire’s head. “Yes, that might be best, if you don’t mind. Thank you, Sam.”
“Uh, listen if you gotta puke the bathroom is pretty close, okay? You think you can make it a little farther?”
Cas’s fingers are clutched at Dean’s shoulders and he wonders, idly, if he could get Cas to put that handprint brand back on the one shoulder from when he healed it out at Stull. He wonders, idly, if there’s a starburst on his chest from where the soulbomb had rested.
“I’ll bet that’s especially useful when you gotta keep her occupied in quarantine,” Sam says, mentally shuddering at the thought of having a two-year old running around with no help and still having to get work done.
Dean comes up to Cas and from behind and buries his face into the angel’s shoulder. Cas gives a twitch of surprise but when he speaks, it’s with warmth and a smile. “Hello, Dean.”
“Dean!” Sam shouts and slides to his knees. He takes his brother’s face in his hands and makes him meet his eyes. Dean’s chest is working, eyes wet and red and Sam’s heart sputters. “What the hell happened, man?” He handles Dean gently because he thinks he has an idea. Thumbs come up, to brush away the tears, like Dean always did for him when they were kids, when they weren’t kids.
Dean must be blushing at that but he just shoves a hand through the back of his hair. “Shut up,” he mutters. Jo takes it in the spirit it’s intended, though, her laughter following him as he leaves.
He’s still debating, a tee shirt weighed in each hand, when Cas appears again. His dark head is tipped down, studying the flex of his injured hand.
“Most things feel strange, I’ve found.” And then he’s looking up at Dean with critical eyes and asking, “Do you ever tire of urinating, Dean?”
Sam makes fun of him one evening, maybe a month into things, because of the face he apparently makes when a text from Cas comes in. Dean throws a pillow at his brother but even he can tell that he’s smiling wide.
“Three!” comes the delighted, triumphant answer, complete with three fingers held up and a toothy grin. Another round of cooing comes through.
After that, Sam starts researching, convinced that there’s “something hinky” going on. He starts bringing his laptop to Dean with “get this” on the tip of his tongue and factoids about bees at the ready. He talks about wasps and attack pheromones, eusocial behavior and male vs. female characteristics, climate change and homing spells.
“Because after almost three months of being cooped up with my mother, even your sorry ass is better company.” Her eyes are bright and affectionate, though, when she grins up at him.
“All right, let’s go,” Dean says. His cheeks are red and there’s heat coming up his neck and the tips of his ears. But he can hear the lilt of his mother’s laughter echoing up toward the garage and Cas slides his hand into his and for the first time in recent memory, Dean thinks,
Dean takes a pull from his beer, watches the chef have a minor existential breakdown for a minute. “He been working with you long?” he asks finally.
There’s a barn, and there’s a prophet’s house, and there’s a ring of holy fire, and there’s a reservoir, and there’s Purgatory, and there’s a crypt, and there’s the bunker, and there’s a Mark on his arm, and there are arms around him from behind, and there’s Lucifer’s sick grin, and there’re wings burned into a lake shore, and there’s a call coming through as Steppenwolf plays, and there’s a Jack’s body cradled in a graveyard, and there’s Cas’s dejected shoulders, and Cas’s angry spine, and there’s a blossom from Purgatory and there’s Cas, there’s Cas, there’s Cas.
That’s enough to prompt Dean to lunge for him and they end up tussling for a minute, long enough that they both end up on the floor, narrowly missing the coffee table. Once they’re on their feet, they both decide to call it a night -- Dean’s back to work in the afternoon. Sam watches his brother when they split to their separate rooms in the hallway and he can just see the glow of his phone cast against his face.
, Dean tells himself, still trying to figure out just what it is about his friend that makes his eyes cross when he looks.
“We were just thinking that we wanted to have a drink with our...surrogate father figures.” Claire loops her arm through Jack’s and they’re still smiling and it is, frankly, pants-shittingly terrifying.
Sam breaks into laughter, shaking his head. “This is not that chick flick, man. Figure out how to flirt on your own.”
Sam laughs again and nods. When he pulls his hand away, his eyes are red but clear. “Anyway. Thanks. And… You really think she’ll be okay?”
“Hey, you used to love bubbles,” Dean says brightly, shoving a little at Sam’s shoulder. And, because Sam’s a little brother, he shoved back. Dean just leans into it. “Bubbles, and fireworks, and sidewalk chalk.”
They drift and regroup and rearrange through the day -- Sam and Dean make camp, Eileen and Jack set off on a hike, Cas and Jack spend a long time in a copse of tree, listening for different birds.
Thinking about it, his next exhale comes out shaky. Cas, of course, notices. His reaction isn’t to question what Dean is thinking or feeling. He just lifts his hand from where it rested over the curve of Dean’s neck and holds it in front of Dean’s mouth. “Do that again, please.”
As they push out of the bar and into the cool October night, Cas proving to need some help. Dean slips an arm under his -- with the height he has on Cas it pitches Cas's shoulder up, their faces close.
It’s late when Dean calls Cas but he doesn’t work the next day and there was too much to Joe Exotic to fit in a text message. The phone call starts as just that, Dean sprawling out about the bizzaro world that is apparently private exotic animal zoos and Cas listens attentively. He promises to watch the first two episodes to catch up with Dean, though he doesn’t sound pleased at the prospect of watching animals in mistreatment.
“Dude,” Sam says, his tone entirely different now, face open in sympathy. “I’m sorry. Can I…” He rocks on his heels, uncertain. “Do you wanna watch Pitch Perfect?” he asks with a helpless little smile.
And let it be known that all ten years of Dean’s repression and guilt and self-loathing were broken, more or less, in one night thanks to the efforts of one kid who didn’t even have good cinematic taste, one half-kid, half-angel who still thought spreading nutella and pretzel sticks on a slice of bread was “lunch,” and the traitor formerly known as Dean’s brother Sam.
Jessica bites her bottom lip, not sure the few Psychology courses she took ten years ago as an undergrad qualify her for this conversation. “Right. Well. At least he’s still here?”
Cas laughs. It’s the first time Dean’s heard it in awhile but it is an ugly thing. It is twisted and full of hurt. “I told you, Dean. I found something I’m good at. And it’s not something that...fits into your life. When I was an angel, maybe, but now. I don’t want -  I won’t return to the bunker, to hunting, to you. All that’s there is...past failures.”
Dean gets a grip and moves his hand. Every twitch and breath from Cas is a volume for him to study - Cas has always been quiet when they’re together. Any sound made, Dean takes it up greedily. Cas’s hips move to meet Dean’s hand and Dean encourages him forward. He fits his face into the notch beneath Cas’s jaw and mouths there hotly.
Dean’s whole chest squeezes and for a moment he forgets language. “Yeah,” he finally manages. “Yeah, it was.”
And then Dean turns to the counter, drumming a little beat on it as he does. “Mary Catherine,” he sing-songs and, to be honest, none of us really thought he even knew any of our names. “Can you do me a favor?”
They swoop high around Sam too, but they’re definitely coming for Dean. It gets to where he can start to tell the difference: this one’s a bumblebee, this one’s a wasp, this one’s a honeybee, this one’s a carpenter bee. It doesn’t matter where they are or what the season is -- there’s an iridescent one that flickers close to his scarf for a whole day and when Sam looks it up he says it’s some kind of bee that’s supposed to only exist in South America.
so my original plan was to have next chapter be the last & for it to be the goobs post-quarantine. but then i was thinking instead i could bump up to 4 total chapters, with the next one featuring some cute How to Flirt When You're Quarantined Apart? let me know in comments if you have a preference!
So, at first, it’s nice to just talk to someone who isn’t Jo, or Bobby, or Sam. Cas is smart and funny and sincere in a way that Dean hasn’t ever really encountered. And he hasn’t once thanked Dean for his heroic work or whatever, so that’s a plus. They text rampantly that first day and then it gradually becomes more casual through the next two weeks.
But Dean rushes to cut him off. “I love you,” he says and he can feel his cheeks getting hot, his throat thickening. “Okay? Cas. I love you. And I need you here. Cas, please.”
Sam is feral with worry as they make the near eight-hour drive back to the bunker. Jack has his phone, calling everyone Sam can think of between trying Dean and Cas over and over again. Dean’s phone keeps ringing out to his voicemail. The calls to Cas drop as soon as they get placed.
Sam turns to find a tousled, sleepy-looking Dean peering blearily at his computer screen. Raising an eyebrow, Sam gestures, “No… This is my coworker, Castiel.”
His far hand comes up and cups Dean’s cheek to tilt his face in. Cas kisses him sure and sweet. This is new enough, or they're taking it slow enough, that Dean is still tallying the kisses. This is the ninth and it’s just as good as the eighth, just as good as the seventh, the third, the first. Cas’s fingertips are curved to just drift over the bones in Dean’s face, like Dean is fragile or precious. Like maybe he’s trying to match his fingers to the prints he left on Dean when he rebuilt him, soul up.
It takes awhile. He has to coax Dean to his feet and then up into the kitchen - his brother looks like a man possessed, like a ghost, like a ghoul, like something already dead. Jack follows him like a lost duckling, trailing behind Sam as he settles Dean at the table and then makes coffee because it’s something he knows how to do.
He ducks his head back from the buzz irritably, eyes narrowed. “Don’t these bitches hibernate?” he says hotly.
Cas tilts his chin a little and his eyes are so blue in the twilight. “We can go to Yosemite?” he asks.
Castiel winces into a smile and ducks out of frame. A moment later, he reappears holding a toddler with wild blonde curls and the biggest blue eyes Sam had ever seen. A roll of “aw”s spirals through the mics, Sam’s included.
"Yes," Cas agrees, and then he's wiggling, flipping over to face Dean and scooting into his personal space. Without a blink of hesitation, he plants his forehead against Dean's. Dean thinks their eyelashes would tangle if they were any closer. "Dean. Your crooked nose is endearing. It is...charming. I like it on your face." And then, after a soft moment where his eyes drift closed, "I like your face."
His emergency contact was Sam Carter, his brother, and Mary said he had made a joke about the other man when she guessed that Miracle was some type of collie/sheepdog mutt: “Sammy’s part sheepdog so you’ll fit right in,” he had said, clearly talking directly to Miracle and not Mary.
“Did you boys have fun?” Sam teases. He slides across the bed, though, and the two of them get Cas's boots off for him.
There’s the horrible world taken over by Croatoans. There’s a pink-cheeked, dazed Cas sprawled over a dilapidated armchair in a cabin with a beaded curtain. His hair is dirty and a mess and when that terrible version of Dean from 2014 stalks forward, he fists his hand in the hair. Cas grins with all his teeth and tips his chin to meet Dean’s eyes. Dean says something, close and soft and heated. Cas’s face changes, warms, melts, and his eyes go to half-mast. Dean leans forward into him.
Anyway, Cas is looking out at the sky or the stars or the mountains or the trees and he smiles and he nods. “Yes.”
Cas pulls back from what he now knows is Dean's chest and blinks against the hated sun. "Hello, Dean," he says - his voice is harsh and his throat aches at the very back when he speaks. But Dean is smiling down at him, soft green eyes and open face.  Cas drops himself onto his back, into the half of the bed he abandoned last night so there's some space between them.
“I vomited,” Cas supplies helpfully as Dean wrestles him out of his flannel, and Sam lets out a bark of a laugh.
Immediately, the slightly staticky sound of applause breaks out from Sam’s computer. Dean comes closer, confused, and, once he catches on to what’s happening, ducks his head a little. Sam turns back to grin something proud at his brother and sees Dean sheepishly carding a hand through his hair. Normally, Sam takes any opportunity to get on his brother’s ass for playing hero, but not today, not now. Not when Dean literally is a hero, running into the frontlines every day, without complaint.
Dean laughs but it’s not really because anything is funny. It’s more before this man who used to be an angel is pressed up against him and their faces are so close and they’re both very drunk. It’s more because their daughter-niece and son-nephil conned them into drinking too much whiskey. It’s because Sam and Claire are pointedly watching the movie, a little too pointedly, and Jack is sitting cross-legged on the floor, head pillowed on his arms on the coffee table and looking directly at them with a dreamy smile.
Dean gets caught between pretending to have been engrossed in the attempt to make Peeps on screen and pretending not to know what Sam is talking about before eventually giving up both. He laughs and nods. “She’s a cute little thing. Good taste in PBS programming.”
Sam could go for coy and innocent, act as if it’s no big deal. But this whole situation is kind of ridiculous so why bother being subtle? He just grins big and nods. “He messaged me to say that Claire went crazy for the sidewalk chalk and asked if I would thank you for the suggestion. So I told him that he could thank you himself and gave him your number.”
Dean nodded but dropped to crouch down, smiling and letting Miracle lick his face. “Hear that, sweetheart? No surgery for you.” Miracle had propped her two front paws onto Dean’s legs and continued her thorough cleaning of his face.
. Look, it’s just--” Dean makes a noise of frustration and sets his shoulder back. “It doesn’t mean anything. He mentioned he was running low and it’s harder for him to do shopping and shit with a toddler in tow.”
The door to the apartment slams, signalling that Dean is home from his overnight shift -- perfect timing. “Hey, Dean, come here a minute,” Sam calls behind him and then, to the computer, announces, “I’m here with my brother, who’s an EMT. He’s just back from an overnight shift.”
. “It’s a good face.” In the next minute, Dean is turning away, heading for the door. “C’mon. Let’s get you a nice, big, greasy breakfast. Best thing for a hangover.”
But the thing is, after almost an hour of listening to Cas, to letting his warm, rich voice wash over him, he does want to talk.
Before long it’s after midnight and Dean recognizes a strange pause in Cas’s story about his brother as him covering up a yawn. With a fond smile held close to his chest, Dean insists, “All right. I think it’s bedtime. You gotta be up at real-people times tomorrow.”
He thought it, maybe. Had considered it, some dark nights. He thought it as he watched Cas walk back into a Gas ‘N’ Sip in Idaho and he thought it as he watched the angel back from the dead next to a payphone and he thought it as Cas showed him the truth of Purgatory and he thought it as he said, lost, “For what it’s worth, I would give anything not to have you do this.” He thought it and rejected it and thought it and rationalized why it couldn’t be.
Sam gave him one of those two-second-too-long stares that meant he had no clue what Dean was talking about and was trying to gauge whether or not it was appropriate to make a joke about it. Before Dean could backtrack, Sam apparently decided on
Dean sucks it up and wiggles his arm from where it’s wedged between him and Cas, slinging it over the back of the couch instead. This drops Cas completely into his side, face tucked up on his shoulder. “What’s that?” Dean asks. Everything is moving a little too fast. Or a little too slow. Either way, he didn’t quite catch what Cas said.
Mary Catherine is at the desk at eleven o’clock that Tuesday, when it’s time for Dean and Miracle’s appointment. The door opens and Miracle comes in happily, tongue hanging out of her mouth, but the man attached to her leash is not Dean.
“Oh, right, of course.” Dean swallows and with how close Cas is, he wouldn’t be surprised if he could feel the movement.
“Oh,” he paused, wanting to say more, but the words were not coming. Instead, he twisted back to the door.
Cas turned to him, “I was forced to kill you. Hundreds of versions of you and different ways it could go down.” He winced. “She wanted to prepare me for anything.”
“I’m fine, Cas,” Dean said, though he didn’t push him away. He enjoyed the feel of Cas’ hands on his body. They were comforting. He knew Cas would protect him at all costs.
Castiel lightly took the mixtape back. A gift. Dean had given this mixtape to him as a gift. Castiel had never received a gift before.
Now he would be the one putting the blade through her and he had to look away and gather himself. He had to kill the shifter,
Dean stood, “Yes dumbass ‘we.’ You, me, and Sam. We’re just better together. Let’s go Team Free Will. Let’s get it done.”
Cas appeared in front of him followed by Naomi, looking over his shoulder. Then, the form of Dean appeared in front of her. “No, Cas, don’t!”
Dean left to get a beer and Cas was left standing in his room. He looked down at the mixtape still in his hands. A gift from Dean.
Dean turned to him, but he wasn’t looking at what was happening, only at his feet. “When we were looking for the angel tablet. She programmed me to kill you.”
“You can’t keep locking yourself away here though. You have to make his sacrifice worth it. We’re finally free from the story, and you can choose how to live your life.”
Dean nodded and then leaves were covering the ground as well as grass while trees sprung up around them.
He paused after tying a knot and closed his eyes. He glanced up towards the head of the table where Cas’ face lay covered. The sheet did nothing to hide his loss. His best friend—.
Dean had to stand by as Lucifer stabbed his best friend through the heart. He shouted out “No!” and had to watch as the brilliant light inside him flashed brightly before burning out, leaving him a shell of the angel he used to be as he crumpled to the ground.
They waited a moment before a black, sticky substance began to crawl out of the ground, forming a large circle of goo. The liquid coalesced into the blond form that used to be Meg.
The build up of over a decade of knowing each other seemed to explode between them as suddenly their hands were all over each other, trying to get as close as possible. They couldn’t get enough, always needing more.
The bright room began to transform to a dark theatre filled with hundreds of seats, some of which Dean and Cas ended up seated in. They looked onto a set that had a fake Impala on it and Dean seemed to be discussing something with a girl.
me while she was inside. I just wanted to go to school like your little brother. Would you torture your little brother, Dean?”
“Hey guys, just thought I’d drop by,” Jack said after appearing at the head of their table. “Castiel, I’m so glad to see you again. I knew they would rescue you otherwise I would have-”
“You want to help me?” She paused, eyeing them suspiciously. “How do I know you’ll stay true to your word?”
Dean stretched to look at the wings and could faintly see them glistening even in the darkness that surrounded them. He can feel the strain in Cas’ body from the effort the attempts are taking. “Cas, it’s okay to let us go down. We can figure out a new strategy when we reach the bottom.”
Miracle had bounded up to Dean in the street after being popped back into existence, and Dean could never deny him. He brought him home, and the dog had adapted to life in the bunker well. He was the only thing getting Dean out of bed in the morning.
Sam and Eileen got married the following year. Dean and Castiel could be seen holding hands in the front row along with many rows filled with their fellow hunters that made up their family and friends over the years. Jody, Donna, and even Jack at the far back of the audience filled the seats to watch the two promise their lives to each other.
One moment he was in his bed holding his book with Cas pressed to his side and the next he was falling.
Dean bit his lip. He couldn’t hurt his best friend. Logically, he knew it wasn’t her. He knew it was a monster and it needed to die so it would stop tormenting them. No matter how hard he tried to remind himself, he kept flashing back to Charlie giving herself up in the process of trying to save him. Listening to her on the phone in her last moments and not being able to get there fast enough to do anything.
She slumped, dead. Blood began to pour out of the wound and Dean could hardly bear the sight. It was almost the same as the bathroom-- Charlie’s blood covering her abdomen and nothing Dean could do to fix it.
Sam looked at the list of thirteen songs: Willow, Cardigan, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, The Way I Loved You, Sparks Fly, Blank Space, Ready For It, Love Story, This Is Me Trying, You Belong With Me, Ivy, Cruel Summer, and Picture to Burn.
The reception was filled with dancing and singing and lots of drinking, but most of all it was filled with happiness because their little found family had grown so much over the years. The boys knew they were finally free of any story written by some bad writer. They could make their own path together with the ones they loved, and they would have a beautiful heaven waiting for them when it ended a long time from now.
“Ready?” He clapped a hand on Cas’ shoulder as he picked up the full bowl of popcorn, a few burnt pieces softly steaming on top.
“But when it came to the real you, no mind control could hold. Those hundreds of practice rounds did nothing. I couldn’t do it. Not to you.”
Suddenly, he felt arms around his waist and someone was pulling him up. A body was practically molded to his back and he felt the warm breath against his ear and Dean knew without a word being said that it was Cas.
Once more, Dean covered Cas with the sheet. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he grabbed the curtains from the windows and began to use them to tie up Cas’ legs. The curtains were nicer than the ropes they usually used for the standard hunter’s funeral. Cas should have the best.
They sat together with Dean occasionally pointing out moments and fun trivia in the film. Cas smiled softly at how excited Dean was to show him one of his favorite films. Dean continued to geek out over the cowboys the rest of the night, talking about how he bought his own cowboy hat once he had seen the film and promising to show it to Cas afterwards.
There still seemed to be someone beside him, and Dean hoped desperately that it would be Cas as the wind whisked by him. He didn’t know where the bottom of this tunnel was, but he hoped it wouldn’t be soon otherwise he was screwed. How was he going to get out of falling hundreds of feet?
Metatron grinned at Castiel. “You draped yourself in the flag of Heaven but ultimately it was all about saving one human. Guess what. He’s dead too.”
Cas had already seen it, but he was happy to watch it with Dean to see what parts he commented on and how he rambled on about the film.
Suddenly, the goo popped and Cas fell out to the ground, little slips of goo falling around him before retreating back into its blond form. She let out a gasp as the rest flowed back into her before she opened her eyes to stare at them.
Dean continued, “I thought it would give you something to listen to as you stayed up. I didn’t want you to always be sitting in silence.”
Cas pushed Dean behind him as his angel blade slipped out of his trenchcoat. His wings seemed poised to fend off the attack as they rose to an intimidating level. Dean was able to just barely peek around them and see Gordon in front of him, fangs out and hissing while he grabbed another knife from his belt.
He went after her again, getting in another big cut on her back and causing her to stumble and fall to the ground.
The memory changed again, showing the group discussing a strategy for how to take down Lucifer. Cas told Dean “I like past you” and Dean now caught how the future version of him jealously eyed him.
“Where are we?” Dean asked, broken out of his trance and looking around. Other than Cas’ now physical wings, this was not a good situation to be in.
Dean let out a sigh of relief and sadness, nearly collapsing as a single tear slipped out. This battle was over. Cas caught him and held him up. Dean leaned on him and they stood together for a few moments just taking in the sadness of the situation.
Cas nodded before his eyes widened at the lack of noise coming from in front of him. He pushed Dean’s arm off and began moving the popcorn off the stove and pouring it into a bowl. As he did this, he missed the flash of hurt that passed across Dean’s face at his rejection before he threw his easy grin back on.
He took the mixtape from its constant place in his pocket and placed it on the desk beside Dean. He tapped it lightly, his heart breaking slightly as he let go of it. The tape had been a nice reminder of Dean and his time together, but he knew he had to give it back. He couldn’t stand to keep it as he failed Dean once more. He turned to go.
Dean grinned, “If I can recall you from early on, you would be offended by that description.” He stood up straight and deepened his voice to imitate Cas. “Angels are warriors of God. I’m a soldier.”
The door creaked as Dean pushed it open. They couldn’t tell what was on the other side, but they stepped forward to see. A wind picked up, dragging them forward and into the darkness. The door behind them slammed shut and disappeared, locking them in the unknown location.
“I know,” she walked up to him with tears in her eyes and laid a hand on his cheek. “That doesn’t change the fact that you killed me.”
The film ended and Cas turned to Dean who was talking about the ax scene. Cas nodded, though he couldn’t focus on what Dean was saying.
Cas looked down, unable to meet the eyes of the man he had fallen in every way for and yet continued to fail, “I’d like that.”
A note sat on top of the book next to their bed though Dean and Cas wouldn’t notice it for many hours.
Castiel listened to the mixtape that night. He reveled in it. He had never understood the attachment humans, and Dean specifically, had to music, but listening to this set of songs, Cas felt like he grasped it.
He wrote down some ideas he had for it, but had no clue how to go about making one. He stared at his list. He needed help.
“Cas, what d’ya think? This is wonderful isn’t it? Just you and me,” Dean spoke into the silence, gripping the urn tightly in his hands.
“It’s this book Sam recommended. I thought it could be a good break after all the lore we’ve been reading on this case. A lot of the cases are very different and don’t really line up so the research has been exhausting.”
The two walked side by side to the “Dean Cave” and sat in their respective recliners - Cas on the right and Dean on the left. The popcorn and drinks were placed on the little stand in between the two chairs.
Cas tried to fly them up. Dean can see his wings flapping and working to push them higher, but it doesn’t appear to work. They are still getting deeper into the darkness and the top keeps getting further away.
Cas walked over to Dean and held out a hand. Dean took it and allowed him to help him up. If they didn’t let go of each other after that, neither of them was about to comment on it.
Dean turned to him, his face taking on a serious light as he furrowed his brows and took a few steps closer. He leaned in and placed an arm on Cas’ shoulder. He made sure to catch Cas’ eye before he said, “Cas, this movie is life changing.”
Cas thought about all those he couldn’t help. He thought about Kelly who he had failed by losing her when she was at the biggest crossroads of her life. He thought of Sam who he had befriended over the years, but who he had hurt far too many times in the past. He thought of Heaven who he had failed as he fell and failed and failed time and time again when he was only trying to help.
Sam nodded. “It’s a spell to summon the Empty. We’d have to be very careful about how we bargain with it, but I think if we help it fall back asleep we could exchange that for Cas.”
“I’m glad you’re enjoying it. I’ve never given a gift before, so I tried my best to think of you in the way you thought of me.”
Dean lazily opened his eyes and was met with Cas’ inches away, their bright blue darting behind him as if to pretend he hadn’t been caught staring.
Cas paused awkwardly, not certain how to phrase his request. “I require assistance making a mixtape for your brother. I’m not sure how to make one and I assume you have experience making them.”
So, Dean drove. He drove for miles sometimes speeding as fast as he could go just because he could. No one was around to stop him. He slowed, pulling over to the side of the road.
similar to the one Cas was currently wearing along with a fluffy pair of white wings for effect and another in a brown leather jacket and a blond wig. They were holding each others hands and then leaned in to kiss.
He watched as Cas walked up to it, knowing they had never faced something like this together but also knowing that Cas was older than humanity itself.
The world around them began to transform. Colors swirled and scenes began to appear that both of them could recall from their memories, seeing themselves in an out of body experience. Dean saw himself laughing with Sam as they lit off fireworks, the four of them with Bobby around a table, Cas standing with who he assumed were several other angels.
When Dean woke, it was peaceful. He had expected it to be violent -- being shaken awake at a monster attack and having to go on the move again. Instead, he woke to Cas’ warmth once more. His arms formed a tight grip around him that loosened when they felt him begin to shift awake.
“If you release Castiel from your void, we will help you go back to sleep. You said Jack made it loud, and we want to help you,” Sam explained.
They were transported to one of the military grade Jeeps, riding alongside the other versions of themselves as Cas told Dean, “The only thing I think we have left, Dean and me, is each other. If Dean says it’s time to go out in a blaze of glory, win or lose, so be it. I’m in. But then...that’s just how I roll.”
