They sat in silence for a long while. He watched as Castiel tipped the bottle into his mouth. He doesn't think a day will ever come where they'll talk. And, Dean means really, really talk.
"Good boy." She said, opening the hotel room door wider. "The closet's straight down the hall. First door on the left. Do watch your step."
"Yes." Dean said, leaning back. He watched as the angel laid down in front of his open legs. Castiel was zeroed in, focused on nothing but the expensive designer boxers on Dean's hips. The final piece of clothing. It stared at it as if it were precious, curved and pointed and tight in the center. Cas's thumbs brushed the simple waistband, feeling the difference between the soft skin of Dean's hips and the warm cloth over it. He looked up at Dean again who was in turn watching him for his next move. So, Castiel kept looking. He let go of all his deep thoughts. He knew he was safe, free from judgement. Castiel's mouth opened and he ducked his head down.
Dean began to pace back and forth in the bathroom, contemplating what to do next. Okay. So. Recap: Dean took his stuff and hid in the bathroom, and now he has a beautiful pair of panties to get rid of.
Cas looked over at Dean with those big blue eyes of his, leaning over with his elbows on his knees, looking more human than any human has ever looked. His jawline moved under his skin as he confessed, "I'm sorry, Dean. For all those missed prayers and calls, for making you feel ignored, making you feel like you weren't valued--"
"And I know that 'baby' is not exactly friendly. I'm not trying to push you away here, or make you feel uncomfortable, but..." Dean flushed, eyes darting to the quilt as he took a deep breath and finished. "'Baby' means... I'm fond of you and I'm close to you. You're the one I chose to start a family with. Our kid is acting like our kid again. We made up. It means you're
Sam, Castiel, Dean, and Jack all looked at each other for a moment. They switched to high alert. Castiel reached behind him, soundlessly pulling out his angel blade from his jacket. Sam and Dean grabbed the emergency guns out of the holsters under the table. Footsteps clicked down the steps, slowly making their way to the kitchen.
Castiel balled up his fists at his sides, staring hard at the floor numbers as they lit up on the panel above the door. 13th floor. 14th floor. 15th floor. Fucking finally. The elevator stopped and the door opened. Castiel reached out, grabbing Dean by the arm and near dragging him out of the elevator. Dean followed distractedly, looking behind him and waving at the girls. He beamed, "Wow, how cute were they? Can't believe that just happened."
Castiel's eyes trailed down the back of Dean's tee shirt. He should really pay more attention when they fix the Impala together. They've had several of these lessons over the years, but Castiel's cars have since broken down on the road more times than you can count. Once while they were looking for Sam when Gadreel took him on a joyride. Once again as he ran away with Kelly Kline. And countless times in between. But every time Dean drags Cas beside the Impala for one of his impromptu car maintenance lessons, Dean tends to do this thing where he... barks orders... and wears less clothing... and then he reaches for the perfect angle deep into the car... while that's happening... Cas's brain... tends... to get... wow... now,
Dean looked him up and down as if he didn't believe him. He's praying now. No words, just that feeling. That longing, tugging pull. It felt like a whispering breath against his ear, a hand running up his chest, fingers in his hair. That son of a bitch. Dean settled on Castiel's eyes, "That's what I like to hear."
"Now, imagine the most annoying person in your life wanting to hang out there." Meta deadpanned. "Because that's how I feel. Right now."
? I've played with it successfully a couple times. And you were plenty satisfied with the outcome when I did. You think I can't handle a bigger blade?"
"I mean it." Dean said simply, standing from the bed in his jeans and tee shirt. He walked over to his boots, slipping his socked feet in and lacing them up. "If my dad gave half the fucks you did, I probably wouldn't have dropped out of high school."
"Jack, Dean has a lot of stuff going on internally. Tends to keep things inside for what feels like forever. How he feels about Cas is one of those things he locks up about. Is it unhealthy? Yes. But, that's why I thought we'd have more time."
"Yes, I do." Castiel admitted with a dreamy look in his blue eyes. "Now, about this house we're renting. What do you think the sleeping arrangements should be like?"
Castiel came out of the bedroom in a concert tee and a pair of joggers. The shirt was black, small on him because it was meant for Dean, but it fit well enough. There was a faded yellow HENDRIX over his chest. Jimi stood holding an electric guitar behind his head, looking confident above the words THE CRY OF LOVE TOUR. The angel waved to Sam at the bar top table as he closed the double doors of Dean's bedroom. The once plain cream colored doors were now covered in symbols, hastily scribbled in black marker.
Jack pushed out of the hug, bouncing with excitement on the couch with his knees. "Cas is free! Cas is free! Yeah!"
Billie touched Amara's arm gently as the Darkness played with the trim on her cloak. Death's hands were cold. She felt as though she'd just carried a block of ice through a blizzard for miles. She was as cold as the absence of life -- full of emptiness and desolation. Born to be an angel of death, Billie carried the souls of life's victims on her back for as long as she could remember.
Dean started to smile, the sun rising in his face while it rained outside. "Are you sure, Cas? I'm kinda rough around the edges. Might stick out."
Billie tapped her scythe against the floorboards. "Alright. Now that we're all here, let's get started."
That worked perfectly for them. As they talked out the particulars, Dean and Castiel sat firmly beside each other as friends. They weren't ready to tell their son they were seeing each other yet. But that didn't stop them from playing footsie under the booth like a pair of teenagers. Sam growled over his coffee, rubbing his shin. There's nothing more destructive than two men over six feet tall playing footsie in work boots. They missed each other twice.
After Sam called Eileen to express his frustration with Dean's lack of cooperation, she agreed to help. It was the middle of the night and Dean was still out driving god-knows-where, so Sam took the opportunity to carry out the risky ritual. Eileen was there to be his tether back to the bunker.
Rowena tutted. "I thought I taught you well." She ran her hand over the book and looked at Sam with a smile. "Nevertheless, I suppose I can assist."
"Alright, enough chit-chat," said Dean as he stepped forward between them. "We got the Empty. Now how in the hell are we gonna get a demon to work with us?"
Rowena said, doubling back on his words. "I doubt this Eileen would appreciate such a brute description."
What ensued was a blur, a flash of bright lights, the swinging of knives, and sound of fists hitting flesh. The Empty and Billie kept fighting Amara, but Amara was strong - she conjured up smoky trails of energy to trap them, choke them against the wall. Billie closed her eyes and matched Amara's dark power, bringing out the same smoky energy within her and blasting Amara away. The Empty trapped Amara within her dark goo as Amara twisted ferociously out of her grip.
"And yet, we do," said Amara. "When my brother and I made amends, we knew people would try to take us down. We were gods together, finally reclaiming their rightful place in the Universe. Of course we were underestimated. We always have been."
Cas looked over at the Empty urgently, nodding to the figures at the front of the ship - they were whoever was guiding Jack's mind, and had undoubtedly put him in his trance. They stared ahead at the sprawling window, their hands gliding around the controls, slowly pulling levers. A figure with long brown hair pulled one lever and the space ship came to a grinding halt. Then, the figure stood up and faced Cas, the Empty, and Billie. She smiled cunningly, zeroing in on them from across the room.
Eileen went to work skimming through the spell journal while Sam assembled the ingredients on the table with a spell bowl. "We need oil," she said. "Do you have that?"
"Your part is not to die," said Dean. "Look at you - you're kidding yourself if you think you'll get through this alive."
Sam's head spun. Rowena had crossed to the other side of the room, now frantically searching through journals. Cas was in danger, and all he could do was stand there, watching Rowena become more and more distressed.
The door to the room was cracked open. Sam hauled himself out of bed and slowly opened the door to peer into the hallway. All was still, quiet, with no indication anyone - or anything - else was here. He turned the corner to search another hallway with his hand perched on the knife in his pocket. He froze as he heard footsteps somewhere nearby.
"So much for closing the book," said Jack. Then, turning to Dean and Sam: "You thought you could end your own story by yourselves?" He chuckled. "That's silly. Only the author can do that."
Dean and Cas carefully approached the main room, Dean with knife in hand. Billie was the first to notice them with an eye roll. "Why can't you two just stay dead like you're supposed to?"
"It wasn't me," said Sam, looking his brother up and down with a face of concern. "Dean - something saved
"We don't have a choice," said Cas as he pushed past Dean and cut into his palm and held his hand over the pot. Dean watched furiously as Cas's blood mixed with Billie's.
A violent flash of rage appeared in John's eyes. But before he could do anything, Dean watched as he began to wither away into the dark fabric of the void around them. Dean's eyes watered as he watched his father disappear into dust. Dean sank to his knees, his face fallen with despair, and found himself completely alone once again.
He looked down and realized he was wearing a hospital gown and wristband. He examined the wristband for any writing - blank.
But the new God had denigrated her role. He wanted his angels alive, in full force, ready to take on battle as the shepherds of humanity for his mighty plan. No more admittances into the Empty, he told her, at least until humanity had fallen to their knees - when he could finally end the story. The Empty knew this was all a lie - a ploy to use her power as means to his end, then discard her.
Eventually, the lights faded and the bar shut down for the night, leaving Dean and Paul as the only patrons along with a few young stragglers on the dance floor. Paul invited Dean to come with him to his room in a motel across the street.
Sat in the Impala that night, he was running out of available distractions. The image of Cas in the empty crept into the corners of his mind as he stared ahead at the dark thicket. He felt his eyes start to droop. A wave of fatigue washed over him. The warmth in his body was swelling, sedating him like a drug. It was a matter of moments until Dean was fast asleep.
"I've been in your mind, Dean," said the Empty. "I know your desperation...your longingness...what...who... you want. There are no secrets from me. Only those you keep from yourself."
Eileen ran to the garage. She spotted the oil cannister sitting on a shelf in front of the Impala. She froze for a moment - Sam said Dean was gone, but his car was here.
Dean swallowed. "Yeah, alright." Was this a trick from the Empty? Or had she brought the real Cas in here too?
added some saileen/samwena just for the fun of it. but no worries, the focus is still dean and cas. but where is cas? maybe you'll find out soon.....
The headache swelled and Dean tightly squeezed his eyes, clutched his head, and let out a yell of pain before dropping to his hands and knees. The pain reached a tipping point, filling his eyes and ears, the smell of blood filling his nose. Then, all at once, the pain stopped, right as the Empty disappeared from his view.
"Alright, Professor X." Dean fought his rush of panic with humor, but a splitting headache was coming on, intensifying with each of the Empty's biting words. He wanted to believe the headache was a coincidence, no cause to that effect. But the pain kept increasing, and within moments he found himself curled over on the ground.
," said Dean. "No one but Sam has ever done the same. But he's not like Sam. He's different from Sam." Dean looked to the side with a sad laugh. "I love Sammy, but he doesn't take up the headspace. When Cas was gone, it was all I could think about -
Dean's expression was steely - Sam could've anticipated this. He always did this whenever Sam brought this up. "Cas is dead," said Dean firmly.
After that night, Cas regularly heard zooming and beeping sounds from the TV at night while the Winchesters were sleeping - it was Jack, sitting in the dark watching Star Trek. So of course it made sense for his mind's comfort place to be here, on the USS Enterprise. But Jack wasn't at the controls. Instead, Cas found him sitting in a chair by a small window on the side of the ship, gazing outside, watching the stars pass by.
He didn't care where he was going, just that he was doing something, anything to distract him. Baby could always offer him a distraction.
"No...no..." Dean whispered as he reached for Cas's arm, trying to bring him back up. But the goo was stronger, the hands gripped onto Cas tightly, and Cas was pulled backgrounds onto the ground. To Dean's horror, he disintegrated rapidly into the endless darkness of the Empty.
The Empty tilted her head with a wry smile. More pain, blinding, surging, rushed through Dean's mind as he yet again collapsed onto the floor, yelling and screaming in a wreck.
She led him into an adjacent room - turns out, he was standing next to her throne room the entire time - and offered him a small stool in front of her throne. She daintily sat down and crossed her legs, watching Sam with a prim smile.
"That hurts, it really does," said Chuck. "You used to think God knew what was best for you, Castiel. Who's your god now? Do you worship yourself?"
But it wasn't enough -- Cas was still gasping for breath, struggling to keep his eyes open. He was beyond healing. But Dean had enough grace within him to keep at least one of them alive.
Sam stared at Billie in anger, lost for words, stuck in a twisted bind. Eileen reached for his hand. "Sam - what would Dean have wanted you to do?" she said softly.
With a flash, the Empty appeared before them, still taking on Meg's visage. She shot them a dry smile and staggered towards them with a slight limp.
Dean looked up at Sam - Sam could see his eyes swimming with tears. Dean sighed and walked over to the kitchen, grabbed a beer, and sat down at the table. Sam followed his lead and sat across from him.
also details about naomi and meg are canon divergent. just go with it. didn't the spn writers fridge them anyway? imo it's better this way lol
Dean stood up to follow them towards the beach houses lining the shore, when suddenly, the man and woman disappeared from view. He felt a hand on his shoulder. Startled, Dean whipped back around.
Sometimes, the image of Cas wasting away in eternal darkness popped into Dean's head. He could see Cas, in his stupid trench coat, huddled on the ground, tortured by the souls of those he couldn't save. This image would appear in Dean's nightmares; other times, on a quiet night driving with Sam. He could usually get it out of his head with beer, a stint at the bar, a hookup. Any distraction.
John stepped forward again with narrowed eyes. "Like hell you are." He raised his voice. "You died to save a goddamn angel. We kill those sons-of-bitches."
Billie looked in Eileen's eyes with a dry smile. "Ah yes. Castiel." She strode to the side. "He died to save Dean Winchester and take me out." She stopped and gazed back and Eileen and Sam. "His foolish deal with the Empty - sealed with a confession of love."
The moment was short-lived, fortunately, as he felt the pain slither away, replaced by a sense of comfort. Someone was standing next to him with an arm on his shoulder. Dean looked up at the trench coat and tie.
Gold, heat, fire. Only bright flashes of the power swirling around them seeped into Dean's faltering vision. With each ounce of grace pouring out of him into Cas, he unraveled. Cas's beautiful work putting him back together all those years ago became undone, transferred, to a holier recipient.
"Please, help me understand," said Sam desperately. "Can you stop all this? Can you bring my brother - and Cas - back?"
But Dean wasn't a little boy anymore, he wasn't helpless and afraid. He met his father's eyes. "Cas is different."
"Cas!" Dean said, his voice breaking. He rushed over to Cas's side and shook his shoulder and knee. "Buddy, what happened to you?"
Dean and Eileen also winced upon contact as they grabbed Jack's shoulders but they kept their stride nonetheless. "What's going on, kid?" said Dean.
"Not anymore." Jack stared, mesmerized at the golden sky. "Now, we will realize who we are without them."
It still hummed inside Dean, holding his broken pieces together, Cas's sacrifice for Dean's life. But Dean didn't need it -- he was a human -- he was undeserving of this power, this will, this lifeline.
In a final act of desperation, Sam kicked open the door. The door came crashing onto the ground, revealing exactly what Sam dreaded most.
Eileen looked up at Sam's hopeless face. She could tell he was lost. "Continue the ritual." said Eileen. "The Reaper can tell us where he is. We'll get him back."
But what was a slap in the face to Chuck was quickly met with a full force blow to Meg and Cas. They grew weary and tired; as did the Empty and Billie, whose power was equally matched by Amara. The battle grew wary.
that moment was, but Sam didn't pry) - Sam had no doubts that Jack, with his god-like power, would rescue Cas from the Empty. Jack had brought back everyone killed because of Chuck - Eileen, Charlie, Jo, Ellen. Surely he would bring back Cas, too.
Jack let out a harsh laugh. "There's nothing to fight." He stepped closer to the glass wall of the cell. "I care deeply for you, Dean and Castiel, and I am a gracious god."
"No, Dean, you're not. I'm not judging you. You know that you're beautiful to me. You know, I'm open to trying anything."
Dean beamed, shrugging. He didn't care. It's not really about the doughnuts anymore. It's about love. New love. Strong, hot, bursting love. Butterflies in his stomach made his heart beat like a drum. Dean gazed across the Pizza Hut counter with an arm full of bread, holding Cas's eyes like a longing touch.
Castiel sighed at Jack, standing in his room, holding a blue oxford and a pair of jeans. "Sam and Dean are downstairs summoning Death. Amara will be here in minutes. She has a very tight schedule."
Castiel replied, "Most of it. Finally got him to stop crying a bit ago. I just wanted to watch over him for a little while longer. To be sure he could sleep. Not being there for Jack isn't an option anymore. Plus, I'm worried he might pass the Occultum in a few hours. Wouldn't be easy on the boy."
Jack woke again around three in the morning, groaned and yawned with exhaustion. His eyes were swollen and puffy after a night spent crying. He wiped his face with his sleeve, sitting up to look at Castiel in surprise, "Whoa, Dad! What are you doing??"
Sam raised the book he had in his lap. "The Spiritual Medicine Book of Shamanism. Thousands of years old, it looks like. In the original Zulu."
Dean usually only has the courage to touch Cas like this when he's drunk. Sometimes he will rub their noses together and push Cas away with a big beautiful laugh. Sometimes he leaves a kiss on Castiel's forehead, his cheekbone, his ear. Then, he would quickly say it was late and he should head to bed, signalling to Castiel that he doesn't want to talk about it. That quickly, Dean's hands were pulling away from the angel and those perfect lips were gone from his skin. That quickly, Dean would ignore what could have happened between them and move on.
Castiel said easily. "If Dean wanted to have sex with me, I think I would have picked up on that by now."
The hunter suddenly stammered out into the phone, "Uh, yeah! Yeah, Jack. I'm still here, buddy. Go on." Dean nodded along to the boy, still watching his angel. Castiel rubbed his thumb along the back of his hand, encouraging the communication.
Dean let out a little smile, pulling Cas's hand and lacing their fingers apart and together again. "Look at you, Mr. Strategy. Full of great ideas today."
Castiel dried the dishes, stating simply, "You're taking Jack out of the hotel room so that Dean and I can have sexual intercourse as vigorously as we wish to."
Amara floated over to Rowena and gave her a hug. Rowena startled on her legs for a moment in surprise. She smiled a bit, warmed by the sudden act of solidarity. Rowena lifted her manicured hand to pat Amara on the back gently. "What's all this for, darlin'? Last I recall, I betrayed you. I went back on my word and ran to my son."
Jack watched Sam with pride. He stood gazing up at him as Sam forced the information from the moon. Dean's glad that Jack got to see him like this.
Dean hissed from the couch next to Sam, "What--Where did you get that? I packed those in the fridge!"
"Come on, Cas, you know I like being around you. We're friends. You got my back and I got yours. We fight for each other. We kill for each other. We have stepped off of a ledge and lived for each other, man. Both of us. I'm not saying none of that is true."
The human lifted his chin, looking up at his angel with wonder as he leaned back against the hood of the Impala.
Castiel rubbed his human's lower back. "I've been thinking it over. And, I've decided that as soon as this Chuck mess is over and we're back in Kansas, I'm taking you to dinner. You know that French place in the city? We always drive past it on our way to the interstate and I see you looking at it. I want us to go. And I want to hold your hand the whole night."
"Good." Sam released a long breath, the tightened muscled in his shoulders relaxing for what seemed like the first time in hours. He looked a bit smaller now. Sam nodded back to the angel, pushing his hair behind his ear, "Thanks, Cas."
Sam spoke up, "Well, you don't have a choice. Lives are at stake. Dean and Cas have you bound, just give us a location and we'll be out of your hair."
Sam grinned, lifting his spell book. "We're proud of who we are. We're proud of the things you tried our whole lives to make us ashamed of. I'll admit it. I study high witchcraft! I'm a witch. A damn good one. My son is the most powerful supernatural creature in the world, and we are proud of him for who he is. Castiel is more human than any angel you've ever made. My brother is in love with the one who saved him when I couldn't -- true love that he deserves. Try as you might, none of us would give up this life. Ever."
Dean dug back into his breakfast, taking a big bite of potatoes and talking around it, "What are you talking about? He's been radio silent for years. Where would we even start to look for him?"
"Breathe in." Amara instructed, placing one hand on Jack's chest and another on the bar top table beside them. Black smoke poured from her manicured fingers, nails changing from a glossy baby pink almond shape to a matte black coffin. The smoke misted into Jack's sweater. His eyes lit up a bright gold and there was a loud cracking noise under the bar. Amara smiled at the noise, closing her eyes as she patted the bar top table. The table glowed gold through every crack, spilling down the legs of it in honey-like trails. The gold glowing energy shone brightly, sparkling and spreading to the floor, the chairs, the walls, the ceiling. When the entire bar was covered, Amara instructed Jack once more.
Castiel blinked. "Of course. But, why do you have to take Jack out of the hotel for that to happen? Dean and I have plenty of space. We find time to spend with one another quite well, and I assure you, we don't need anything special."
A tall girl with buzzed raven colored hair was passed the champagne next. She took a sip without spilling a drop on her expensive black crochet dress, silver earrings hitting the elevator lights as she turned to Dean. She gave him a solid look up and down, gesturing to the champagne. "Oof, cute bell boy. It's my birthday. Have some bubbly!"
But, then Chuck stepped in to make his adjustments. Chuck woke the cave-dwelling vampire coven that killed Sam in the Apocalypse Universe. He loosened Lucifer's bonds, allowing the archangel to cross worlds. He guided Michael to them just in time to manipulate Lucifer, who in turn, manipulated Jack. The moment Jack rejected him, Lucifer snatched away his power, killing him slowly.
Dean pulled Sam in for a hug and patted his back hard before pushing him away. He cleared his throat, blinking away the water in his eyes as he grumbled to the floor, "Thanks, Sammy. Means a lot."
Metatron rolled their eyes behind a pair of vintage black Prada shades. Their phone buzzed in their pocket. Metatron raised a manicured finger. "Wait! Don't stab me. Gimmie a second. I'm on the clock." They pulled out a bright red smart phone with #MetaMansion embossed on the back in glitter. Metatron checked the message and sighed out a disappointed, "Jesus." before putting their phone back into their leggings pocket to continue their conversation. "Why should I tell you anything? Our strained relationship isn't all my fault, you know. Yes, alright. Yeah. I admit it. I fucked you. But, to punish me for like
Sam winced, looking away quickly and waving his hand in front of his face. "Oh! Haha. That's... that's uh... that's cool."
Frenching Castiel. He assumed he'd have at least a week of sneaking around with his little angel boyfriend having a bunch of sex before finding the right words and coming out to his brother. Real life is not working out like that. He might not be able to hide it. Sam knows him too damn well.
"Yes. Once we finish up in here, I'll get Jack back into some normal clothes. He had a meltdown when I brought it up earlier, but we came to a truce: he could only wear it in the house."
"Come on, Castiel! You can't lower yourself like this! He's rude, messy, lazy, ungrateful, callous, self-righteous. His best personality trait is the shape of his ass--"
"Jerk." Sam answered, turning and taking the water with him, "I'll tell Jack to let you finish breakfast. Thanks for making the food, guys. I'm gonna go take a shower."
"It's not that, Cas. He's Lucifer's lovechild, the world was gunning for him before he was even born. Us included. He was never gonna have it easy." Dean shook his head, stating clearly, "It's... the way you care. I mean, even soulless and raving mad, Jack was certain that you loved him and had his back. That's how dads should be."
your boyfriend. He's fucking psychotic." Meta lifted their chin. "But, you know, after all of that, he's kind of my ex."
"I looked for him." Castiel confessed. "While I was looking for Kelly. Just to be sure he was gone. And I didn't find anything. I just... I was positive. Now, suddenly he's alive and we're being warned away by The Book?"
Dean glanced up, pretty green eyes flicking up toward the angel as he laughed aloud, "You're a good father."
Jack nodded brightly, standing in a pile of his own feathers, "Almost. I asked him if he did and he got mad and told me not to repeat it, so I'm right. Then I told Cas to go talk to Dean, and they talked and they left the house really late to watch the stars together! I thought for sure we'd have news, but they don't really seem too different. Cas is just... shy, I guess. He has his reasons, but true love always wins in the end. Right?"
Dean leaned in and pleaded. "I want you to have hope, Cas. That's all I want. Goddamn it, I'm gonna give it to you."
The angel lacked finesse, but picked up on things quickly. Dean gave occasional instructions as he went. "Slower", "Deeper", "Harder". Cas listened to them all, arms folded over Dean's hips as he sucked merrily. Cas reached down to his sweatpants and pushed his hand inside. He breathed out his relief, a growl of arousal bursting from his throat while he pleasured his lover. Cas looked up at the quivering hunter. Dean was a mess, his chest was red and panting, fingers buried in Cas's hair, back arching into his angel. That was exactly what he wanted to see. Castiel could easily get off watching that. Cas's hand picked up the pace in his sweatpants as he gave Dean head with the intention of sucking that human into a coma. He wanted to make that man lose his mind. Dean can shake harder, he can sweat more. Castiel isn't done with him.
"No," Billie commanded. "I'll give you a signal. Then, you go. Take this whole place with you. Understood?"
"Dammit, Cas, look at what you're doin' to me." Dean glanced to the living room to see Jack and Sam still distracted. They were. He tugged Cas back in for a long, warm kiss. Hands at the back of his neck, and fingers in those soft dark curls, Dean bit his lip a bit. Castiel let out this deep, quiet growl, kissing him hard. The angel's large hands wandered down his back to rest on Dean's firm ass with a light grip. Cas squeezed at the tender human body under his hands and breathed out a sigh.
Jack spoke up, "Billie said Megatron's seen it. Sounds cool. You think if we find him, we'll find some other Transformers too?" The boy gasped in realization, "Maybe there will be a monster truck Transformer. That would be awesome."
"But, you have something to do." Jack replied knowingly, folding his arms over his cozy grey sweater, "And you're avoiding it."
Pretending as though he didn't have a major life event mere minutes ago wasn't easy, but Dean has a PhD in bullshit. He'll make it through one conversation with his brother without giving himself away. Castiel waited eleven years to kiss him, and despite everything that moment was special to Dean. He just wanted to share that memory with Cas and Cas alone right now. A part of him wanted to make sure it was real. Dean just wishes they didn't have to run out right now-- that they had time to spend together talking and holding each other and figuring everything out. Those moments were few and far between for the Winchesters. As of now, they won't be alone for quite a while.
"Yeah, I know, Cas. But you don't know what he's comfortable with unless you talk it out with the guy. He likes you, he'll listen. Things have changed, maybe his opinions on your relationship have changed too." Sam patted Cas's shoulder with a wet hand. "But I can tell you right now that scones is not romantic enough, man. Dean might not love that."
Castiel patted his back, "You heard Sam. He doesn't think you're a freak. And he used to drink demon blood the way Dean drinks beer."
Watching his brother cast was always strange for Dean. Sam's always had a gift for dark shit like this. It's hardly news to him that Sam and magic went together like demonic peanut butter and demonic jelly. But, wow. Seeing Sam cast a spell was like witnessing the work of a seasoned witch.
Castiel stayed quiet, head bowing as he acknowledged Death and the Darkness with reverence. He was rocking his "signature look" again. His ever-present trench coat swished against his slacks as he followed his human like a dutiful golden retriever.
. The picture looked so awfully terribly shitty, but Dean loved it. He would cherish it. Dammit all, it's going straight on the fridge when they get home. That little crappy crayon scribble was everything to him. Just another reminder that he had his son back. The first thing Jack drew was his family. He's so precious. Dean could squeeze the kid.
They were all dealing with the loss of their son while preparing for war, and each of them had their own unique way of powering through.
Sam tugged himself up from behind the bar table, long hair in his face as he blew it out of the way with a huff. "A little warning about the kick would have been nice."
Dean shifted back onto Castiel. The human was warm and soft to the angel, but he was hard in some places. He fell asleep in his jeans and felt a bit stiff. Dean shimmied a bit, complaining as he pulled them off under the covers. He tossed them onto the floor. "Hate these stupid pants." Then he laid back down. Castiel pulled him in close again, wrapping his arms around his chest. Dean smiled, "Now, I'm comfortable."
"Whoa! No!" Dean gagged, his frisky mood shattered by the toddler in the backseat. His key turned in the ignition and Dean rolled his eyes, starting the car. "It's none of your business, Jack."
Sam is human. He doesn't have a single solitary super power. But, he reads and he's passionate and look what he can do. The man had summoned powers so strong they can't even see them, and now he's bending them to his will for the greater good. This is how he chooses to use it.
Castiel stood up as the door closed behind Sam and Jack. He walked over to Dean in the quiet. Dean hid his face in his hands, still slumped on the floor, "I can't believe that just friggin happened to us. We were doing so good. He saw Jack, Cas."
Metatron grinned just thinking about her, saying casually. "My queen. I mean, I'm just a personal assistant, you know? I arrange her schedule, iron her clothes, do the shopping, field her calls. And she's eternally grateful--"
From the doorway, his angel returned. His trenchcoat shuffled in as he closed the door behind him. Castiel said, "Jack is alright. He and Sam are asleep. The wards are fine."
Dean hurried over across the burgundy carpet and ornately painted walls and furnishings in the hallway to pick up three Hermés shopping bags. He was easily holding at least $26,000 worth of shit in here and it wasn't even heavy. She leaned in and tapped him on the nose with a delicate manicured finger, "I like your hustle. Be careful with those, there's a jacket in there that costs more than your life."
Silence rang out. Dean carefully stood up, leaning on his bedside table for support. He looked around the room - beer bottles and dog treats lined the walls, but there was no sign of Cas or Meg.
Suddenly, two demons popped out from the shadows, grabbing each of Sam's arms. Sam spun around and punched them off him, then swung his knife towards the one closest to him. The demon collapsed on the ground -
"I am a siren," said Paul, confirming Dean's suspicion, "and tomorrow, you will let yourself die in front of your brother."
"Jack's in a better place now." He strode forward and watched Cas, Billie, and the Empty gripping onto each other's arms. "I see you have a little plan here to kill me - uh, sorry, but I'm gonna call it off." He twisted his hand and the smoke dissipated; their blood disappeared from the pot with a horrible gurgle. "It was a nice try. Not your best work."
Meg's personal mind palace was a grungy apartment that the Empty guessed Meg called home. The musty green walls were pasted with posters like a teenager's bedroom. Dark windows lined the living room - it was always nighttime when the Empty paid Meg visits.
Cas's head snapped up to see Naomi had reentered the room and was walking firmly towards his cell, carrying a cylindrical device. Cas's stomach twisted as he realized he'd seen the object before - flashing in front of him, forcing him to do things he couldn't control.
"No," said Cas. "You're wrong that feeling like they do is a weakness." He got closer. "The angels, the gods, they believe that fear and obedience can bond us all together in an unstoppable force. Well, they're wrong."
The question was whether the entity that appeared in the barn was Cas or if they had some other cosmic being to worry about. However, Dean refused to go along with any inkling Sam had about Cas being alive. Sam couldn't change his mind; Dean wouldn't let himself hope. Instead, he gruffly said he was going on a drive and stormed out of the bunker, abandoning Sam's effort to find Cas.
Jack turned away and let out a groan of annoyance. He twitched and clutched his head, then turned around again to face Cas. His gaze was emotionless, lifeless. "Don't forget, Castiel, who here is God."
Sam and Eileen rushed over to the spell bowl - Sam hurriedly shuffled through ingredient lists while Eileen started measuring materials.
Rowena snapped out of her trance after praying to Castiel for just a few seconds. Sam had been watching her with baited breath, and stared at her in confusion upon hearing her words.
Sam pursed his lips and gazed out the window in frustrated resignation. These "vamp-mimes," as Dean called them, were hardly more intimidating than any of the other run of the mill demons they hunted. Even so, Sam had a bad feeling about this case.
Dean froze. His eyes flitted up at the image of his father, avoiding eye-contact like a nervous child.
Cas dropped onto the floor in front of Dean as the void closed with a horrible squelching noise. He groaned and struggled to move.
Cas sensed Dean's realization and tried to hold out a hand to stop him, but he was too weak. Dean closed his eyes as tears streamed silently, as he let down the floodgates, let the grace take over his entire being, let his purpose be consumed by the dying Cas in front of him. He was a man risen from hell, bringing back his angel from heaven.
Dean closed his eyes and put his head in his hands. He cleared his throat and looked up at the car, shaking his head. It
"Why not?" said Dean with an air of defensiveness. From the driver's seat, he couldn't see the entrance.
He turned and looked at Dean and Sam as he cried. He looked so small, scared, like a lost child. His eyes were pleading for help, but he couldn't form the words. A breeze swept towards him, blowing the fire trickling out of his fingers with it.
Sam looked at his brother through blurry tears - Dean was desperate, determined to die. Time was running out to save his brother - it was too late to call for help. Sam couldn't leave him here dying in an old barn, alone. Sam couldn't let him die in a state of distress.
"It's me." Meg was out of breath, fully winded from her chat with the Empty. She lifted herself up off the floor and wiped sweat from her brow. "The Empty sure knows how to wear a girl out."
Meg let out a dry laugh and looked to the side. "Dean's a liar. Can't trust him. He doesn't even trust himself."
Jack shook his head. "You are ungrateful." He narrowed his eyes. "You must trust that as your God, I know what's best for you. I have a plan that will lead you to eternal happiness, if you just play your role."
Sam gave her a small smile. "Just give me an hour," he said. He sliced a small cut on his arm and dripped his blood into the spell bowl, causing the liquid to fizzle. Then he stepped back while Eileen lit a match and stepped closer.
He walked towards them as they stared at him hesitantly. Dean stood closest to Jack; he could feel a frequency of power radiating off him, vibrating the ground below them.
Cas opened his mouth, but Chuck cut him off. "Humanity!" Chuck walked forward aggressively towards Cas. "You are a foolish angel. Turned away against God for humanity, putting your trust in the Winchesters."
When Dean saw Meg walk into the room, he was more confused than anything, but greeted her regardless. "Now there's a familiar face."
Billie nodded. "And his possessor is ruthless and efficient. He will stop at no bounds to finish what he started."
Cas was in the bunker still, his vessel collapsed to the ground after he'd flung himself into Jack's mind.
"What's in it for me?" said the Empty. Meg's offer was tempting. Admittedly, the Empty was desperate to surrender, desperate for any way out of the mess God had created.
He was laying in his bed in the bunker, light streaming in through the window. He felt tears still wet on his face. He held up his hand - Dean's blood was gone. He looked at his arm - the cuts and scrapes from his fight with the vamp-mimes had vanished as well.
The night became more blurred and patchy as Dean and Paul downed drink after drink. They reminisced about hunting adventures - Paul said he had a thorny encounter with a banshee a couple weeks ago, and Dean told Paul all about his and Sam's current case. As he described the vamp-mimes - Paul let out a hearty laugh as Dean bragged about the creature name he came up with - he could hear Sam's voice in the back of his head telling him not to trust this mysterious hunter he'd never met. Yet, Dean went on to talk about his dad's journals and their plan to corner the vampires in a barn, even though he knew Sam would kill him. But Sam didn't need to know. In the early hours of the morning, Dean found himself unable to control his words, answering every one of Paul's questions with great detail. Paul watched him talk with vested interest, locking eyes with Dean the whole time in an almost hypnotic state.
Chuck roared and stretched his hand out from the floor. He pinned his grandson to a wall, hissing in pain. An unseen force stuck the child several feet up. He gestured again, slamming Jack into the wall, keeping the boy's neck exposed and snappable. "You brat! You're stronger! How?!"
Amara flicked her wrist at the wall, a long golden rip appearing in the white paint. The wall cracked and split open to create a large gash in the fabric of space and time. It looked just like the one Jack had made when he was born, long glistening and golden. She glanced at Billie, batting her long lashes. "Wanna get this outta the way? We can knock it out right now. I have brunch with Ms. Wintour later, and coming up with next year's Met Gala theme gonna take up most of my morning."
"This isn't over, Cas. I'm touching that blade." Dean leaned into Castiel's space and made a fond face at the angel for a moment before heading into the house. Cas tugged Dean's hand back in. The hunter could barely move an inch. Apparently he was staying put. As Cas stood beside Dean, Jack and Sam continued into the bunker, both heading inside. The door closed behind them with a loud creak.
They walked around the room, white shag carpet underfoot as they walked around. The nephil explored, spotting a big door on each side of the room. Jack went to the one furthest from the stairs. Opening the large ivory hotel room door he walked into a room with a yellow Bumblebee Transformer bed. He had a wall full of glow in the dark stickers, a giant Lego set, a coloring book with a bucket of crayons, a small library of kid's books, a big pile of stuffed plushies, a large window with a telescope.
Dean reached Cas's side and turned 180°, walking backwards so he could keep looking at him. The angel shouldered Dean's bag at an easy pace and locked eyes with the hunter. Dean flirted with a shy smile. "Hi."
With the Empty looming over his head, Castiel was sure he wouldn't survive last night. Dean needed him. Terrible nightmares plagued the man as his mind cracked under the weight of his pain. The things Dean tried to forget often came for him when he was at his most vulnerable. He woke in hysterics and when Cas left to check on their boys, he came back to see the poor man shaking and holding a gun in the center of the bed.
"Sam." Dean said, sipping from a piping hot paper cup of coffee while leaning on the door of the Impala. It was pretty dark out still. Around 5 in the morning. He shrugged, breath puffing out air in the cold, "We appreciate you scoring Metatron for us, we really do. But, now Jack's exposed a-and Chuck is watching our asses like Joe Goldberg. It's only a matter of time before he drops from the ceiling and kills one of us because we're not following his stupid storyline."
Castiel gritted out through the pain. "I've got you, Jack! Keep going! You're okay! You're doing it! I've got you!"
Castiel placed his hand on Dean's knee, "It will be. Someday. I promise. We just have to get through this together. No one left behind. No one shut out."
Rowena sat on top of the Winchester's Impala trunk, glancing at her nails while the creator of the universe was defeated just fifty feet ahead of them using her own spellwork. She checked on the boys from a safe distance. Sam and Dean stood together, slack jawed and staring. Sam's fist was still gripping the back of Dean's jacket as black goo gurgled and splattered over the building. Soon it was covered in the stuff. Then, it folded in on itself like a black hole, swirling and sucking into the sky until it was the size of a house, then a box, then a button, then an atom.
"Right?" Sam swiftly stepped out of the room. There was another room on the other end of the living room. Sam crossed it quickly, ripping open the door. There was a hulking bookshelf built into the wall, a bridge of books arching over the king sized bed right in the center. Soft white cotton sheets, boxes of old scrolls and texts piled up in the corner. The room had a black ceiling, a photorealistic image of the milky way floating and twinkling down at them. It was actually moving. A large wooden desk and leather chair sat against a wall with an old, dated Windows computer from the early 2000's.
There was this beautiful, peaceful softness between them since Dean's prayer in Purgatory. Cas was hurt by the events leading up to their split, more than he had let on. He must have been thinking about leaving for a very long time. Dean wasn't loving or caring or kind. Nowhere felt like home anymore. Not the Impala or the bunker. That feeling came from his family. And Cas and Jack are family. Pushing them away, knocked his whole life off balance. Hurting them felt like hell. Castiel knew how he wanted to be treated, and at the end of the day he didn't love Dean any less. He just wanted a big fat wet "I'm sorry". He deserved it and Dean owed him that. So, Dean confessed his guilt and promised to do better. He cried. He hated himself for getting so honest with Cas, so emotional. He almost said too much -- like, never go again, I'll hold you every night, I love you, Castiel. After the prayer, things between them were healing. Cas held him and forgave him and walked back into his life with no question. On some level, they need each other. Dean's sure of it.
Dean shrugged, "Won't be all bad. You got more room to do research back there with Jack. Maybe you can check out Metatron's building, hack yourself a little virtual look-see. Bet you can find a sly way in."
Castiel gave Dean a long, worried look before leaving the room for a moment. Dean rocked in the center of the bed. Then he heaved himself out of bed. He grabbed his duffle from the floor and dug around for his gun. Dean usually keeps it under his pillow, but Cas was here to protect him. Now, he's not. Dean held the gun behind his back and sat back into bed, eyes wide and vigilant. He scanned the room for movement. Something was definitely coming. He could feel it. He didn't know how, but he could.
Aerosmith's Toys in the Attic album bled from the record player in Dean's open hotel bedroom, echoing through the kitchen as Sam and Cas did the dishes. They stood elbow to elbow, Sam washing and Cas drying. Meanwhile, Jack was cheering Dean on as he started to beat his arcade level. Dean tapped his foot to the beat as he lead his PAC Man along the maze, avoiding the multiplying ghosts. Jack jumped, pointing, "Go! Go! Go! Watch out! Yeah!"
Rowena walked quietly towards the doors, hands raised, eyes glowing a bright violet. Lowering herself at the knee a couple paces from the double doors, Rowena tapped her finger against the floorboards, "Inbecillus." A thin purple and gold line stretched across the floor surrounding the bar in a big box. The line sputtered into sparks, fading back into invisibility. She smiled, standing up in her Oscar De La Renta gown with grace.
"Right? It's been a while. But if I had to choose someone, he'd be six feet of angel muscle with no refractory period and the inability to sleep. Because, wow. Last night was awesome."
Sam gritted his teeth, scrubbing a plate hard. "So, I'm taking Jack bowling. And we're spending two hours and sixteen floors away from you guys with no intention to bother you when we return. Go nuts. I'm serious."
"Nothing's wrong. This just... this reminds me of something from a couple of Dr. Sexy episodes." Dean blushed, gesturing with his hands, "Two hot uniforms in a workplace setting get a moment alone in an elevator. One thing leads to another and..."
Dean gulped around the lump forming in his throat. He couldn't get that thought out of his head. Cas, holding his black satin panties, touching them and pulling at the elastic. He stammered out, "O-okay. Well, we're gonna kick his ass. Obviously. So... that's that on that."
Noticing the sweets in Castiel's hand, Dean broke out into a reflexive grin. "Aww. You shouldn't have."
Dean felt the question pour out of him, "What's wrong?" The angel's chest heaved with increased breath. He's stressed out still, somehow. Dean took his face in his hands, "Hey. Hey, baby, is something going on?"
Castiel lifted Dean with one arm, freeing his hand from his pants and slapping him on the ass with the other. His fingers dug in hard to the soft flesh, and he slapped it again. Castiel's grace buzzed under his skin as he spanked his human lover. He gets why people like doing that. It's flirty, it's fun, and he gets to touch Dean's butt with enthusiasm. "Oh, Dean. This, I can do."
He remembers bits and pieces after that. Waking for small moments to get more and more comfortable in his sleep. He vaguely remembers having his face on Castiel's shoulder for a bit, and another moment where he had curled up on his lap. Before long, Dean found himself laying down.
"I... uh..." An unintelligible string of words got caught in Dean's throat at the sound of that. Dean didn't know if it was Castiel's deep voice or the fight he just won or the fact that it's
Rowena tapped Dean's shoulder, two big spell books in hand as she gestured toward the front doors. "It's about to get radioactive. We should probably make our way to the exit. What do ya say, darlin?" Dean patted Cas's chest and Cas waved to Sam. The four grabbed their duffle bags and watched as Amara reached over Chuck to hold Jack's hand. The black smoke and golden sparks swirled together around the booth. Their power fused together. Light, dark, Jack. Amara was on one side, Jack on the other. Chuck was stuck in the middle and struggling through the iron ropes.
Sam called back through the door, "Rowena and Bobby might have found something that could help. Come take a look."
Castiel announced casually. "We've decided to invite Amara to the summoning this morning. There are a few important matters she and Billie need to discuss. I already called Meta, so they'll both be here in about an hour. In the meantime, I'll get Jack up for breakfast."
Billie spoke up, "It's claim on you doesn't conform to interdimensional law. The universe does not deal in gentleman's agreements, it deals in sacrifices and contracts. While the terms of your deal are unusually broad, the Empty has already proven to have dishonored them. The existence of this false claim hinders you from helping us to complete our mission, so as a group, we've decided to render it void."
Dean patted Cas's cheek, "Well, when you're ready to read me the riot act, I'll be here. And, we'll talk again."
Sam replied, "I can't help but think we don't even have this moment. Chuck's waiting just outside city lines, trapping us in Amara's Barbie dream house. All of this is literally too good to be true."
Castiel pointed to blueberry cake doughnuts, lemon filled glazed doughnuts, caramel apple doughnuts, until he'd offered Dean everything they had. It took a few minutes but Dean wouldn't mind if it took all day. Cas's sleeves were rolled up, pointing to each donut in the display case with the tannest, strongest looking forearms Dean had ever seen. Dean wanted him so bad he could just rip his Pizza Hut hat off and quit on the spot. Dean's coworker noticed him standing and staring at the sweet side of the store, elbowing him for some support on the line.
"Yeah!" Jack pushed his strawberry pancakes away. He reached under his plate and showed his parents the back of the children's menu. He had scratched out four little horrifyingly distorted human-like figures. One was all orange, tall and lanky with a red flannel on. Another was very small, golden and bright with little black wings. Then there was a green one with a green cowboy hat on. And a blue one with big black wings and a long tan jacket. The figures were holding hands on a blank background next to a big black car. Jack grinned, "It's my family!" Jack pointed at each figure. "There's Sam. Sam is orange. And I'm the yellow one. And Dean is the green one and that's Cas!"
Dean's jaw dropped at Castiel's bluntness. Dean grabbed his fork, taking a suspicious bite of his potatoes. Cas was right, everything tasted fine. He shrugged and turned back to his plate, "Well, Cas, I'm just saying. Family meals are a specialty of mine, alright? I've mastered the craft."
. No more chicks and late nights out, I swear. I'll make you smile. I'll make you coffee. I'll make you so happy, you'll be dancing with me, Cas."
Castiel opened the thick metal drawer of the tool box. He took a few handfulls of gaskets and shoved them into each coat pocket. Closing the drawer, he reached over to the hulking wooden shelf beside the tool box. It was covered in car repair equipment. Including the coolant. He grabbed the blue Peak antifreeze and turned back to the Impala.
His dark brows were downturned, beard full and chest puffed as he strolled toward his sister with violence in his eyes. "They're trying to put an end to me, and you're choosing them? We are family, Amara! You don't get a vote! You're already on my side! You're supposed to trust me! Follow me! Listen to me! Only me! And, if you don't fall in line, I'm gonna make you--"
"Ew." Sam lifted the glass of "juice" in front of his plate, peering into it with a green look on his face, "So... do I... chew this..."
The handcuffs fell from Chuck's hands and onto the floor. Dean picked them up as Sam walked around the table. "No. You're going to pay."
He glanced behind them to see Sam's watery eyes watching Jack fade into nothing as he sniffled out sharply, "Guys! We have to leave him. Now."
"I know." Jack moved back to the dishes with a smile on his face, "So, I vote to keep our bet in place."
Meta spoke up for them. "Cliff's notes: Chuck's finally lost it. They brought back the nephil after your brother killed him."
Castiel let go of his human as Dean patted his chest right over his heart. The angel watched Dean walk mystified, closing the fridge. "Mmm... now,
Chuck gritted through his teeth. "A disappointment is what you are. Malformed. Defective. Pitiful. A waste of grace. I shouldn't have even made you."
Castiel went to Dean, healing his wounds. The human held his hand through it, face glowing with emotion, rebellion, passion. "He can't keep us apart, Cas. I'm choosing you. Wings and all." For the first time, Castiel was truly weak.
Sam stopped at the door. He stood with a cup of chamomile tea and two sandwiches. The hunter retreated, whispering out, "Bad time?"
He felt nothing. He was nothing. Just a blank slate with memories he can't connect to and more power than anyone could handle. Any emotion was foreign to him -- a hot scalding reminder of what he lost.
Castiel arrived, uncomfortable but willing to do what he could to move on with the case and get Dean out of her room. He let out an awkward hello and picked up another Hermés bag and three Burberry ones. As he straightened himself up, the woman stopped him. She gave Castiel a nice long look from behind her dark sunglasses. He asked, "Is something wrong?"
Cas's grace swirled around under his skin from where he lay on the floor, feeling his human's chest move with breath through his warm tee shirt and flannel. One of Castiel's favorite things recently has been the feeling of Dean's weight on top of him. Noticing his straddled position on top of the angel, Dean startled with his hands on the floor beside Cas's head. He couldn't keep his signature rough and tough attitude up. Not with him. Not now. His heart skipped a beat. Dean bowed his blushing head, somehow still feeling hot and nervous when they're this close.
"Yeah, thanks for holding it hostage." Dean walked over to the bag, zipping it open and pulling out a towel and his bag of toiletries. He dropped those onto the bed and dug through. Pajamas... pajamas... Dean found a soft white tee shirt and his sweats were in here somewhere. He needs a shower and sleep. In that order.
Castiel broke free from Dean's hand and shoved the duffle at Dean, eyes wild. Dean shook his head, already knowing what was about to happen. Before he could ask Cas not to, the angel said suddenly. "Dean! Go!"
Castiel's mouth went dry as he looked his hunter up and down for a moment, knowing exactly how beautiful that sight would be after spending last night with him. And now, he's going to get three months of it. Cas raised his hands up to cup Dean's face as he confessed. "I would love to meet him."
The tension dropped from Sam and Castiel's shoulders. Dean said, "Oh, that is such a relief. He's been a real pain in our asses lately."
"Did you like that?" Castiel asked, voice rougher and deeper than either of them have ever heard it. "You wanted me to punish you earlier. Like the Pizza Man."
Dean sobbed back as his breath slowed and he calmed down. A tear fell from his eye. Dean begged, "Cas, something is wrong. Check on Jack."
Dean focused on the hum of the car, the direction of the wheels turning underneath. Jimmy Page started to sing into the stereo. His voice crooned to the slow, sexy, bluesy bass. His voice added to the deep romantic drum. He'd pulled this song out of his fucking soul. It was pain. It was heartbreak and love and lust and sex and tears. Page pitched his voice to the beat, sliding it through the song. Dean could feel the singer's body sway with rhythm through the speakers, bringing his energy into the car with him. Dean's finger tapped and tapped.
"We comforted each other." Sam scratched nervously behind his ear. "Nothing serious. It was just that one time years ago..."
Dean leaned back on the couch, pulling Cas in closer. "One of these days, you're going to have to describe that entire situation to me in agonizing detail."
"No." Billie glanced down to the pile of nephilim feathers in the middle of the kitchen. She looked as pleased as they'd ever seen her. Her leather jacket caught the light, dark shadows playing off of it as she walked over to it in her boots, "I see you found the Occultum."
"Perfect." Amara took the feather and ran her thumb softly across Billie's knuckles. "You're more prepared to lead than I thought."
"Don't short change me, I know you're here! I know you're listening! Give me his location! I won't ask again!"
Jack recalled being soulless. Then, thinking nothing of the pile of pastries that began lining the kitchen counter when he first came back to life. He wasn't tethered to any emotion, nevermind the emotions of others. He didn't notice Dean pacing in the kitchen beside the oven at 2am. All he knew was that there was good food at home.
and he's a man with healthy blood pressure, but he grew a bit flustered. Heat rushed under his skin. Fresh jets of testosterone sang in his veins as his body got ready for an event that was never going to happen. Oh, no. A once moderately explainable problem just got bigger. And harder. And thicker. Dean clenched his jaw as he looked away from the angel and out of the rain streaked window beside him. Maybe if he sits here and hates himself enough, he'll stop being so goddamn sexually attracted to someone he can't have.
They will soon live a life without a storyline. Gone will be the sensationalized battles, the ever-evolving monsters, the pointless murders, and the loveless hookups. Their life will finally be theirs to own. Every one of them has dreams and goals they put on hold to keep fighting for Chuck's entertainment -- Jack included. So, when this is all over, the Winchester Pack will have happiness waiting for them on the other side.
Jack complained, "But they're already so big! When I'm old enough to bring them all the way out, I'll trip all over them."
Dean started to smile back at Castiel, lost in those pretty blue eyes. Just moments ago, he held Dean and protected him in his sleep. He was warm and strong and trustworthy and loyal. He alerted Dean to a threat. He checked on Jack. And Sam. He was exactly what Dean needed.
Castiel nodded, "Yes. It's a good thing. He's still young. His angelic side has been replenished by the Grigori and his human side has been reunited with his soul. Now that he's fully intact, his wings may be growing larger to accommodate."
Dammit, he really likes them. He doesn't wanna destroy them. But. He might have to. There's a pair of scissors in his bag. He could snip the panties up and dump them down the toilet with five distinct flushes.
Castiel waited as Dean turned the water on for him. The angel dipped his hands under the warm stream. He soaped and tidied his hands up. Then dried them. He turned to Dean, "Now potatoes?"
"You guys were so loud, I had to do magic! There's soundproofing in the living room now. Look at your bedroom door. It's covered in sigils. Did you even notice?" Sam said, still typing and focused on his research.
Dean nodded. He leaned closer on the bed, shuffling up a bit as he acknowledged the angel. "How about we try out the summer? We can put the blades down and drive to the coast. Create those memories. Sam can pick up a little side gig for fun. Then the three of us can keep an eye on the kid while he gets some sand and sun. It's a win-win."
"Absolutely not!" Sam took him by the back of his sweater, steering the boy away from the kitchen. They rushed past the living room couch and little arcade games toward the long black stairs that let up to their rooms. "We're gonna wait for them to come out when they're ready."
"Cas, I really like you. Whenever I see you, sex crosses my mind and now that we're together like this, I'm thinking about it constantly. Fuck, I'm even dreaming about it. But, you're not really a sexual guy. I don't ever want you to feel pressured by me." Dean said sincerely, as he tried to explain. "I really... it would kill me if you did something you weren't comfortable with just because you like me. I'm serious. I mean, throw me off of you whenever, and I'll listen."
Castiel held Dean's hand a bit tighter. "Jack could get in and out easily. He could let us into the building through a side door. Metatron's never seen him before, so he's our best choice to lead. Chuck knows Jack's alive. Now, he can use his powers as he likes. Jack could even teleport if he wanted."
"Shut up, Sam. You put us in danger twice today. Is it that crazy to believe you're on thin ice with me?" Dean said harshly, pointing at Sam over the open trunk. He avoided Sam's eyes and grabbed the car door handle.
Jack carried an empty drink tray through a 5-star Brazilian Steakhouse, scanning the rows of tables for their culprit. No cigar. He tucked the tray behind his back, leaving through the bustling kitchen. Next, a Wolfgang Puck bistro.
Chuck groaned, tossing his hands up. "Ugh! If I wanted leviathans on Earth, they would be on Earth! Having a race of shapeshifting sociopathic hive minds walking around is a really bad idea. They kept eating my stories, plagiarizing my characters. Pains in the rear end. I had to kill most of them off after you stopped Dick. So annoying. Took forever. Never got a 'thank you'. When the last time you saw one of those shark faced fuckers walking around? A while, huh? Cuz I rounded them up and sent em home."
"YOU'RE NOT FUCKING LEAVING ME, YOU SON OF A BITCH!" Dean screamed, summoning all of his endurance to keep running. His hand was tight and firm against Cas's, dragging the angel along until he started to run again. Dean yelled out as his legs ached from the pressure. They gripped on to each other tightly, using each other's strength to push them to the finish line.
Sam patted the kid's shoulder, "No. It's built on engineering and physics. But sometimes that can look like magic, yeah. Science the closest thing humans have to it. It's like casting a spell with numbers and shapes and theories until this...." Sam picked up his ball, "Magically transports itself from one side of the room to the next without anyone having to lift a finger."
There was so much human to kiss. Dean was big and stocky, full of hot muscle and decadent soft sections. Cataloging every inch with his lips and scruff and hands, Castiel kissed his way along a detailed path. Everywhere he could reach, he wanted to taste it all. The angel crawled down, pressing kisses to Dean's belly and hips. When he ran out of space, Castiel glanced up at Dean as his lips traveled to the the waistband of Dean's new black boxers.
The passenger's side door opened, and the trenchcoated angel slid into the bench. He closed it solidly and looked at Dean with wide blue eyes. He's so close. Dean pulled at the collar of his tee shirt, heart throbbing in a way that made him sweat.
The boy continued gleefully, pushing his father's shoulder, "You should have seen your face when you told me he needed you! Dad! You like him!"
, I'm a warrior." Dean glared, stretching his arms and pushing himself up from where he was sitting. He pressed a hand against his forehead and groaned. "Demons fear me."
Chuck yelled and shook in his bindings, promising death on them all. "I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill every single last one of you! And, I'm gonna enjoy it! I can't wait to rip into your throats and grab the souls out of your weak little bodies! I'll cut you into pieces! I'll burn you alive! I'll drown you in fire! I made you! I made all of you! And I'm going to
Jack understands how the Winchesters love now. Unconditionally. They accepted him back as their son. They all held him and picked him up and put him back together. They jumped at the opportunity to be a family again. So, if they've loved once, they'll love always. Jack smiled. Unlike Sam, he truly believed. Dean and Cas will find their way to one another. Things are changing for the better between them. He can feel it.
The boys didn't mind giving Jack that room at all. Daresay it was tailored for the boy. Amara sure is intuitive. Dean walked through the room, checking the dresser beside the telescope. There were sports drinks and fruit in the fridge, books on the shelves. As the dresser drawer opened, Dean saw a neat folded row of sweaters. He opened another one. Jeans. Another drawer had underclothes and socks. Another had pajamas. Another had swim clothes for the pool downstairs, sweat clothes for the gym.
Billie glided over. Her long cloak hid her boots as she ventured toward the rip in the wall. The sound of metal scraping perked their ears and her scythe appeared in her hand. Billie tapped the bottom of the scythe hard on the floor beside the rift, making an ominous thumping sound before she walked right into it. "Sure. Let's chat."
"Yeah, well, he'll live. He had cereal in the middle of the night. I'm making good on my promise. Breakfast is on the way. I just..." Dean glanced at the floor, "Got distracted."
Billie smirked. "Your book's been quite the page turner lately. I'm glad I got to read your rise to power."
"I'm sorry..." Castiel looked down at their feet, refusing to meet Dean's eyes anymore. "I just. I might be a little distant sometimes."
"Alright. If they say so. We got the space." She answered pleasantly, stretching a hand out. "Hattie."
Skidding across the floor with his angel in tow, Dean roughly grabbed him by his stubbled face to make sure he was okay. He was. Dean's heart thudded in his chest. In that moment of passion, he pulled Cas in closer and pressed a confident kiss to his confused, angelic lips.
Castiel pushed his right hand into his pocket to get rid of those gaskets. Dean walked into his space. Castiel watched as Dean approached him with a playful smile and a confident posture.
He remembers feeling like a bashful lovesick idiot, melting like butter in Castiel's strong arms as they cuddled and talked their toddler into going back to bed. Dean was so screwed.
Mixing the bowl with a fresh wooden spoon, Dean glanced over at the angel. Castiel's hair flopped a bit, curls brushing his forehead. Dean just wanted to push it back with his fingers. He knows it would feel soft. Then Castiel would look up at him. He would smile. He would jump into Dean's arms and they'd push the mess off of the table and make out all over it.
"Uh, hell yeah. Thanks." Dean took the bottle from her, taking a long drink from it. He tipped it back and the girls started to clap and laugh. He handed back the bottle, laughing back, connecting with them in that human way that Cas struggled to understand. The girls rubbed his shoulders and flocked over to Dean's corner of the elevator to lavish him with attention.
Jack shrugged and grabbed his fork, taking another bite of his eggs. He accepted Billie's news and moved on, seemingly more concerned about finishing breakfast than he was about plotting to kill his grandfather. Life-altering news had been thrown at him on a consistent basis since birth. That has a way of rearranging one's priorities.
"I don't know." Castiel confessed, gazing behind Dean out of the stormy window. "But he can't keep going on like this. Not right now. He's not going to say it, but he needs a break from all this fighting. He wants to be a kid. And after all he's sacrificed for us, we owe it to him to give him a childhood. He doesn't have many pleasant memories, Dean. That's on us."
Castiel blinked calmly. He'd been watching over Jack from a stool he had taken from the kitchen, sitting right beside his bed. The young nephil pressed hand to his chest to slow his breathing, sharp intakes from the startling moment. He clearly hadn't been expecting the angel. Strange. He'd been here all night, keeping his son safe. Why would he leave without saying goodbye to him?
Dean lifted his hands, holding both of his index fingers about seven or eight inches apart. Then he looked up at his brother. "I know there's one thing you wanna know."
One night, Dean put on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," and Jack was instantly enamored. Dean tried to hide his excitement as he answered question after question from a fascinated Jack about the Star Trek universe. Cas had picked up over the years that Dean made a lot of Star Trek references. Strangely enough, watching the show with them peeled back the shield Dean put up -- it was one of the few times when Cas saw Dean truly let his guard down over those last few months.
The transfer of grace was an all-consuming, full body experience. Dean took a long breath as the grace made connection with Cas's forehead and traveled into his skull. A sense of deep connection washed over Dean, as if he and Cas were one, just for the moment.
After an arduous spell that left Sam lost for breath, nearly all the lights in the bunker went out except for one, which highlighting a smoke-filled haze where the spell bowl had been. Her scythe appeared first, and then the rest of the Reaper materialized in front of them. Black leather jacket, cropped curly hair, and a red-lipped smirk.
Dean hesitated before he spoke. He knew what to ask - the most painful reminder, the truth he had been running away from with beer and bars and women. His voice wavered as he managed to get the words out: "What was the last thing you said to me?"
Dean paused. He knew he shouldn't be sharing his secrets with a stranger, but he felt no other choice. He trusted Paul. Maybe it was the alcohol or the overwhelming nature of the bar. Or the way Sam mentioned Cas's name a few hours ago at the pie festival. "I lost my best friend."
Dean rushed forward and clutched Cas's head. Cas opened his eyes and looked at Dean, blinking slowly, trying to regain focus. A surge of grace flooded to Dean's fingertips as he reached out to Cas to heal him once more. But Cas swatted his hand away.
Jack's voice sounded like a whisper. "I've never been in a vessel so resistant. And she's here too." His voice dropped lower; Cas strained to hear. "
Sam was almost certain Cas was alive. After Dean explained (very vaguely) what happened at the bunker that night - the deal Cas made with the Empty to spare Jack, his valiant effort to save Dean and take Billie down with him, and his moment of "true happiness" (Dean didn't get into exactly
"When all this is over, I help you round up angels like no one's business." Meg smiled. "I'm a demon, remember? We both hate them angels." She paused. "Well, except for the one."
Chuck glared at Cas. "We had an arrangement. I wrote the books, you follow them. You die, then Dean, then Sam. Why can't you just do what you're told? What kind of angel are you, defying God?"
"Two very different questions," said Billie steadily. "I will help you defeat God. But Dean Winchester has cheated Death too many times, and Castiel tried to kill me twice." She paused. "Obviously I will not bring them back."
It swelled and swelled until the stars were no longer visible individually - the Universe turned to a blinding abyss of starlight. Then, in a bright flash, there was nothing - the light silently, leaving them floating in complete dark. The stars had gone out; just as the Empty had been, all was an empty void.
Dean looked away from Cas just for a second, gazing out his window, closing his eyes, taking a breath. It was to much to bear at once. He slowly turned back towards the passenger seat to face Cas again. But Cas was gone.
Sam didn't understand. Cas was dead, no question about it. No ifs, ands, or buts. Dean had been burned enough times. Was Sam really naïve enough to think Dean hadn't tried to bring him back? For three months after the Empty took Cas, Dean prayed to him every night. He scoured over the bunker's library trove of spell-books, manuals, and lore. There was nothing, absolutely jackshit about how to bring back Cas. There was nothing useful in most of the books; any goddamn book that mentioned bringing back angels from the Empty only said it was impossible.
Sam could sense this was a losing battle. "Nothing," said Sam. "You have fun. I'm going back to read the lore."
"You just have to come to heaven." Cas's words were strained, as if it took all his strength to say them. "Come to heaven, and Jack will free us both from death."
Dean stood very still. He searched Cas for any hint of doubt or uncertainty. Part of him thought the Empty was just trying to provoke him. But these words were not new, not invented. He had heard Cas - the real Cas - say it all before.
"You sound like an infomercial," said Dean. He gritted his teeth with a sigh. "Fine. Do what you gotta do."
He covered his eyes with his hands and squinted past tears. He saw a shape materialize in front of him and then heard a recognizable voice. "We're almost there, Dean."
He said the words Dean longed to hear. The words that were too painful to say out loud. Dean looked back up at Castiel, glassy-eyed, face full of long held back emotion. "Tell me what I have to do to get you back."
He was in a daze, mesmerized by the passing orbs of  light, the sprinkles of stardust and clouds surrounding them. The space ship was moving, Cas realized as he saw the starlight blur in the window behind Jack. Cas turned to the front of the ship - the control deck, where he'd seen the Star Trek characters touring deep space. Instead of Captain Picard, he saw two people at the controls.
"Trust me, I've done this before." Sam examined the liquid and added a pinch of hemlock. To his relief, the smell dissipated, allowing them to safely begin the ritual.
"Careful," said Jack. There was a long pause, then: "We will expel them, with time." More pause. "Nothing like this has ever been done before. Nothing so powerful."
With a drawn face and sallow eyes, John Winchester watched Dean with a muted desperation. He clutched the sheath of the knife in his pocket as he stepped forward towards his son.
Dean put his head in his hands and slouched on the ground in relief. But relief soon turned to held back alarm. He was completely alone, in an eternal cave devoid of sight or sound.
Rowena's voice was ear-splitting and echoed nonstop as if it was bouncing off the walls of his cell.
Footsteps rang out from the hallway, and Dean braced himself for the worst as Jack strode into the room. His entire persona was off - usually a shy, gentle kid, Dean saw his eyes were cold as ice, and not an ounce of happy-go-lucky Jack appeared at the surface.
Dean frowned and took out his phone to tell Sam to pick him up. He was mid-text when he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned around to see a man wearing a red flannel and Royals ball cap over ruffled dark hair. He gave Dean a wrinkled smile - he looked like he was in his forties. "These kids just don't appreciate good music, do they?"
"I work in deals," said the Empty. "I make my subjects reach their breaking point, then I can consume them."
They stood in silence for a bit, still taking in the sight of home. Then Cas looked up at Dean. "We should find Sam."
"We know," said Sam. He gestured to the array of books and spell bowls on the table. "We've been trying to get you and Cas back. We even summoned Death." He nodded to Billie, who tilted her head with a dry smile. Sam continued. "She says that Jack wants to destroy humanity...carry on Chuck's mission."
"You have a demon," said the Empty. "With me, you kill two birds with one stone." She glanced over at Cas, her lips twisting up in an unmistakably Meg-like manner. "Isn't that right, Clarence?"
"I've never brought someone back to life before," said Cas, carefully taking Dean's hand to examine his grace flowing through it. "Perhaps I overshot it."
Eileen sighed in relief as Sam appeared in front of her. She rushed forward to hug him, causing some of his pile of ingredients and journals to crash to the floor. "About time," she said.
Jack sat down in a chair as their energies flowed into his mouth. With a full body shake, he settled into the chair and hung his head down - his vessel was unconscious.
He walked away to Naomi and the Empty with a scowl. They talked among themselves, Jack pointing back at Cas several times during the conversation. Cas heard snippets of their words.
"I'm fine." Cas hoisted himself off the floor and wiped off his trench coat. He looked around the room in awe. "We're really here. Alive." He turned to Dean. "You're a man of many secrets, Dean - the Empty's interrogation must have been very distressing. Thank you."
Dean opened his mouth to speak, but Meg cut him off with a glare. Then, to Cas: "She's dug into you before too, Clarence. You know how she gets in your head."
Sam's head jerked up, and his jaw dropped as he stared at them, stunned. "Dean?" He ran a hand through his hair. "Cas?!"
Dean shot him a look, but realized from Sam's solemn face that he wasn't making fun. "Yeah, that's the one," said Dean. "I-uh-shared a drink with the siren before I knew what he was, and he told me that- that I had to let myself die. In front of you."
Jack knelt to the ground with a pained yell, clutching his noggin, his fingers ablaze. He threw up his head towards the skies and opened his mouth -- his posessors wrangled their way out, their dark, shadowy forms twisting past Dean, Sam, and Eileen as they found the way back to their original vessels in the bunker.
He closed his eyes as the light wrapped around them, burning unbearably, washing out the rest of the barn from view. The entity filled in the entire barn with its light, sucking in abandoned tools, roof tiles, even the vamp-mimes. As the ringing became more intense and loud, Sam felt his vision tunnel and his entire body go numb.
When Paul opened the door to his room, he shut it immediately and locked eyes with Dean. Dean's stomach dropped. He realized this wasn't the first time someone had lured him into trusting them after sharing a drink.
Sam sighed heavily and looked up at Billie, who waited expectantly. His words were strained but resolute. "Tell me how to kill God."
Paul grinned. "We were wondering, Dean, if you'd like to join us in our beach house for some afternoon fun."
"It's easier when you don't have to pave your own way - to follow someone else's plan," said Jack. "But its more...painful. Because it's not you."
Dean patted Chuck's shoulder. "You want to write stories all day? Fine. Write here. Forever. Just... leave us all alone."
"Definitely." Castiel promised. He then pointed at the boy's dresser across the hotel room, already covered in toys, plushies, and crayons. "Downstairs, is a group of powerful allies. They're here to help us stop... Evil Batman."
"I'm not making fun. Here, let me fix this..." Castiel reminded, leaning over to straighten Dean's sleep wrinkled collar, "And, I can. Boil hot dogs, I mean."
Jack turned back to Chuck and a wave of power suddenly burst from the center his chest. The power burnt a hole into the back of Chuck's chair, glowing so brightly that Dean's eyes began to burn. This was usually the time a supernatural being tells him to look away, sparing his vision. It was becoming too bright for him to handle. He gazed up at his lover and his son like they were an active volcano, set to burst any second. He couldn't watch them die. But, he couldn't make himself move.
Dean came back from the sorority delivery with a $20, and he knew exactly how he was gonna spend it. He walked over to the POS system and ordered a large pepperoni pie and a large cola. As soon as it was done, his shift was over. Dean clocked out and walked over to the donut shop with the steaming pie in hand.
Dean held his thumb up from the floor against a wall, "Good job, buddy. I think you're officially the first man in history to fight the creator of the universe in SpongeBob jammies."
He almost whimpered with sadness into the soapy water. Okay. If Jack is being honest, he will miss Dean's desserts now more than ever. Now that he's able to enjoy all the love Dean puts into his food, it would break Jack's heart to not have as many yummy treats in the house.
The rift pulsed again and Cas rushed out of the rift with Jack riding piggy back. The kid laughed and giggled and smiled as Castiel ran them through the rift together. Jack's arms were wrapped around his dad's shoulders, bouncing as he cheered. Castiel said brightly as the rift closed behind them carrying his son around the abandoned lot, "You did it! You did it! You did it! I'm so proud of you!"
Castiel stepped into Dean's space beside the open fridge. He had a large navy colored book in his hands, flipping it to show Dean the thin crust pizza on the cover. "I found this in a drawer. Thought you'd want to see it."
Around the time Jack died, they were all at each other's throats. Turns out, their love could weather any storm Chuck wrote for them. Including the last three years. Look at em now. They had all patched things up and gotten closure while Jack waited in the Empty, and they finally felt like a united front again. So, Dean used their bond to guide how he moved forward. Regarding Jack, Dean let him stay because of Castiel. Cas didn't talk to Dean at all before bringing Jack home, but Dean took one look at them and gave the angel what he desired.
Once they were alone, Cas pulled the hunter in closer and walked into an embrace. He wrapped Dean in his thick trenchcoated arms. They stood outside holding each other for a moment, breath making little puff clouds in the cold night air. Dean locked his arms around Cas's broad shoulders. The angel tugged him in by the waist. Castiel rested his head on Dean's shoulder, "I want to make sure you're okay. Before we go. You've been praying for more hugs lately."
Sam blushed, ears turning a dark red as he focused on the ropes. He knotted and swirled the ropes around Chuck's chest. "Yeah, well. We had an adult conversation about our affair, so we don't have to give anyone any details--"
Dean nodded with heavily lidded eyes, hips humping idly against his angel's thick thigh. "G-get rid of... yeah..."
Sam raced toward it as soon as he saw it. He clicked and it sprang to life with a modern greeting screen. "I wrote my senior thesis on this library computer when I was at Stanford. And it's completely updated." Sam typed, dragging the mouse with wonder, "Holy shit, it has Google chrome."
"Our family is different. Unconventional. I'm raising you with two brothers, not my spouse. And Dean... he likes women, Jack. Much more than he likes me. And that's the end of it. I'm lucky we're co-parenting together. I won't ask more of him. It wouldn't end well. He desires a wife. Not a warrior."
Together, they walked the new earth and felt the global shift. Little did they know, the number of monsters around the world dropped three quarters, most of them evaporating into thin air. Hell was suddenly locked tightly. Demons were sounded back into their caves. Heaven, on the other hand, was given quite the recharge -- fortifying it with boundless energy in moments. Neither Heaven nor Hell was on the bridge of collapse under Amara's rule. There's no valid reason for it. There is such a thing as too much chaos, the Darkness now knows this. Now, is the time for organization and responsibility. She turned to Billie, "Remember the veil?"
Dean didn't pour his heart out the way his brother Sam did. He was gruff. Short. But, he offered himself up. Dean gave Jack honesty and assured him that he had nothing to worry about concerning his family. They were a unit, and that was final. He said not to eat all the cereal because he's cooking breakfast for them a little after sun up, and it's going to be "legendary". A special family breakfast. Sam, Cas, and little Jack are all due at the breakfast table by 7:30 sharp. No excuses.
The younger Winchester walked hard, boots hitting the ground as he grumbled out under his breath, "Just suck his dick already..."
Dean lifted his chin, putting on a stern face. He just had to stay cool. Cool. Everything is normal. Just take a breather, relax. Dean shook his shoulders steady and let out a deep breath.
They kept missing each other. Dean looked once. Twice. Both times his eyes connected with Castiel's back. God, even his
His shower stuff is out there on the bed with Castiel. With his towel and pajamas. Dean shoved the panties into his pocket and pushed open the bathroom door. He paced through the room, striding past the angel sitting on the edge of the bed. Castiel asked, "Dean--"
. He's working a hairsbreadth away from the best donut shop he's ever been to. Dean couldn't help but smile to himself. Lunch break is about to be legendary for him.
"I'm going to be here for you, I swear it. I don't want you to have to burn me again. I know that was hard on you."
is everything, boys. It's proof that a writer is on top of their own story. Everything lines up. What was said, cannot be taken back. What was done cannot be undone. I wrote you, Castiel. You were ballsy and rebellious and committed, always fighting always starting fires and watching your brothers burn. I admit, I admired you. You drag people in. You use em, you turn them on, you shut them away. Then eventually they die. It was classy. Rare. Spunky. Almost like a celibate James Bond. But you have this heart that's so soft, and a head that's even softer somehow. You're gullible. A bit of a himbo, if I'm being honest. No offense, you know. I don't hate that about you. It produced a lot of sweet stories, but I like you better when you're angry. You do more. I mean, you spent the last three years as a wet nurse, playing house with the Winchester boy while hopping universes.
"We need a full moon if we want accuracy." Sam sighed, he pulled his phone out, typing a bit, "And the next one is in... two days."
Jack snapped back in reply. "You and I both know he is a deviant. He's trying to rewrite the story. This is what he always does."
The door busted open, revealing a smirking Jack on the other side. He stepped towards them confidently. "Thought the knocking was a fun effect," he said, "but we all know I don't need your permission to come in."
When they reached the machine, Dean saw the man's pockets were bursting with quarters. The man kept loading the machine until they reached the ten song limit. Dean watched as he selected Queen, Bowie, Styx, and Rolling Stones - solid choices. Soon enough, the pop faded away and was replaced by Queen's "I Want to Break Free." The crowd of twenty-somethings didn't seem to mind - they kept dancing with just as much rigor.
Cas couldn't believe the words coming out of Jack's mouth. Unforgiving and ruthless, he had twisted into a zealous God. His tone was all to familiar, all too similar to his predecessor. It couldn't be...
the priority right now - and Sam swung at the other demon, causing her to buckle over as well. He caught his breath and looked around the hallway for any more surprise guests. Then he heard the sound of clinking shoes coming towards him.
"My vessel is resistant as well." The Empty spoke with much disdain. "You told me she was weak. A lowly demon.
"He's in danger," said Rowena hurriedly. She wrung a hand through her hair and closed her eyes, focusing her thoughts.
Billie grabbed a knife and strode towards a pot sitting on a nearby table. She cut into her palm and squeezed the blood into the pot.
"Bullshit." Meg shook her head. "We both know you're no fan of God's plan. So let me out - I'll do the heavy-lifting."
Dean whipped around to the passenger seat to see Cas sitting beside him, watching him dotingly. "Cas?!"
"Jack is weak," said Amara. "He is a child - you left a child in charge of the Universe. He was lost, confused, scared. And where were you? Oh right. Defying your destiny."
Paul nodded and drank slowly from his glass. Then he reached into his pocket for his wallet and turned to Dean to show him something inside. The wallet folded out to a picture of Paul standing next to a man with curly blond hair and glasses. They were in front of a truck, their arms around each others' shoulders. "This is Hurley." He looked up at Dean. "I lost him, too. A few years ago."
"You are pathetic," said Jack as he raised his arms. "You are pathetic because you will never know love."
Meg raised her eyebrows. "Didn't know you were here too, Dean." She looked at him smugly. "Always a pleasure."
Dean joined the man on the barstools. The man held up two fingers and leaned over to Dean. "Hey man, let me buy you a drink."
He rubbed his forehead - a sweat was building. He rolled down a window for some cool air. Ever since he woke up after nearly dying in the barn, his entire body had felt like it was on fire, but not in a painful way. It was like being in a hot tub or a sauna - a constant, comforting warmth. He recognized the feeling, but didn't let himself think about it too much. Besides, he could be remembering things wrong. It had been months since he'd last been healed by an angel.
"I'm here for beer," said Dean as his words were cut off by the crowd shouting along to a Cardi B song. He scowled at the waitress. "What is this crap? Can't you play some classic rock?"
But this wasn't it, this wasn't the end. Dean stopped believing in happily-ever-afters a long time ago. After a split second of relief with Chuck and Amara out of the way, a sense of dread settled onto his shoulders, weighing him down from the light feeling of the golden snow.
"I knew you'd be back," said Eileen. She walked forward to give Dean a hug, then Cas. Sam followed, looking Dean and Cas up and down in disbelief as he wrapped his arms around each of them.
Cas didn't answer. Instead, his eyes skimmed back and forth, searching for the right words to say. Finally, he landed on them. "Dean, I wanted to talk to you about what I said before the Empty took me."
Sam kept going. "Look, I don't know what happened...back at the bunker, with Billie...you never told me. But is there a chance - maybe - that could've been Cas?"
Dean woke up to the smell and damp feeling of beer spilled all over his shirt. "Damnit." He straightened himself out and sat up in his chair. He was still in the same spot, in the Impala parked in front of the thicket.
"He is possessed," said Cas. "By whom, I don't know. But he's bloodthirsty and cruel. Killing you was part of his plan."
became better." His smile diminished. "I've hurt you more times than I can count." He stopped, met Cas's eyes. "Hard to love that."
"So we have Billie here," said Sam. "Now we just need to summon three other beings who can possess humans?"
"When a Winchester is desperate enough to summon a Reaper," said Death smoothly, "of course I have to go see for myself."
Upon hearing Meg's thundering voice, the Empty snapped out of the chasms of the demon's mind. Meg stood in front of her, scowling.
John continued. "What happened to saving people, hunting things? Sticking by your brother's side, being strong for him? You've lost sight." He stopped and shook his head. " Locked up in heaven, desperately making deals with a demon. Letting yourself die at the feet of an angel." Then, meeting Dean's eyes in seething anguish: "What happened to my son?"
The Empty nodded slowly, inspecting and picking him apart, with her stare. Dean felt the familiar ache settle into his head as she combed through the pages of his mind, digging deeper and deeper.
Meg turned to Cas with a dry grin. "No worries, Clarence." She smirked down at Dean as he laid on the floor, unconscious. "He'll be back in just a pinch."
He heard a shuffling noise on the other side of the cell and turned around to see Cas hunched in the corner. Cas's baggy eyes were half closed; he appeared to be waking up from unconsciousness.  He spoke, his voice weak. "Dean? Is that you?"
Cas narrowed his eyes as he looked at Jack - clearly calculating something in his head. He raised his arm subtly towards the pot of blood, channeling what grace he had towards reanimating the ritual. He turned to Billie and the Empty with a whisper. "Complete the ritual."
Dean hesitated, his eyes shifting back and forth for a second before looking at Meg again. "What the hell does that mean?"
Drawing his weapon, Sam stared straight ahead down the hallway. His eyes jutted to the door to Dean's room, which was creaking open. Heart pounding, his mind racing with possibilities of what might appear. A figure began to emerge-
Cas placed his hand on Dean's shoulder and gazed at him wistfully, watery eyed. " You changed me. You made me care; you made me kind." He paused, collecting himself, before speaking again: "Knowing you has meant everything to me. Loving you has made me better."
"Clarence, please." Meg placed her hand on the keypad outside of the cell. After a moment of concentration, the cell door flew open with a click. "The Empty's outta the driver's seat. I'm here to bust you out."
Billie stepped forward. "Summon all the power we can. We bring together whoever we can find - at least four of God's creations who are capable of possession. Death, the Empty, an angel, demon. We pool all their divine power together through a blood ritual that I initiate. Then we summon God and take him out."
A harsh whoosh of air hit Dean from above, and his head snapped up. The same swirling void that had taken him appeared on the ceiling along with the sounds of distant screaming. Dean furrowed his face in confusion as he squinted into the darkness - a figure was falling towards him, drawing closer as its screams grew louder.
With a sigh of relief, Sam tucked away his knife. Rowena bounced down the hallway, wearing a red sparkly gown and tall black stilettoes. Guards surrounded her with large imposing stakes. Sam eyed them cautiously.
"We have work for you, Castiel," said Naomi. She snapped her fingers, and cuffs emerged from the cell's walls around Cas's arms and legs to restrict him from moving. She stepped closer to the glass between them, pointing the horrible device at Cas's head.
"The connection broke." Rowena was harried, stressed. She quickly strode to a nearby ingredient table and began shuffling through its contents.
It was for sure the nicest cell he'd ever been in. Much better than the the jails back home. Still, he'd rather be out than in.
Dean reached out with a knife to cut Cas's hand as a final test; Cas shook his head. "Just a projection," he said. "I have no physical form here."
Then, all at once - Meg grabbed Chuck with a knife to his throat. The Empty bound Amara's arms behind her, and Billie held out her scythe to her neck.
Sam nodded. "Thank you, Rowena." He glanced at the sheets of paper in front of him. He'd never seen such long incantations, the ingredient mixtures were new and bizarre. "Any advice?"
Jack shook his head. "This wasn't the plan." He started pacing, rubbing his temples. "I took you out of the Empty so you could serve me. Serve my plan. He was supposed to die." Jack paused and looked at Cas with desperation. "I created a heaven for him!
And then, yet again, Dean was left in was deafening silence, a dark abyss of solitude stretched out before him. He threw up his hands in frustration and wiped his face. He stood for a moment, glassy eyed and hopeless, wondering how much longer he would be forced to live through this.
He shook with exhaustion as he collapsed on the floor. The connection with Rowena broke - he closed his eyes in frustration.
"If only you had just followed your destiny," said Chuck. "I would have sent you to heaven, Cas. Dean's heaven. You would've been there for eternity. You would've been happy."
The Empty stepped forward. "I knew I wasn't talking to Jack, all these months in Heaven. But I was talking to two people at once?"
Cas continued, his voice strengthening with each word. "Love is stronger. Everything I do now, I do for love. Not God, not Heaven. Love."
"Turns out Jack was more than happy to step aside," said Chuck. "When Jack thought he was absorbing our power and getting rid of us, he actually just let us in. We stayed dormant for a while, plotting how to take the reins."
Then, footsteps. A man approached him - same height, same jacket over flannel combo, and the same green eyes.
"Well hey, no harm done. Works great as a painkiller," said Dean. He cleared his throat and looked back up at Cas. "Thanks for saving me, man."
at Cas for sacrificing himself. Dean knew he didn't deserve it - he didn't deserve Cas, he didn't deserve to be saved in Cas's place.
Sam sighed, still looking out the window instead of at his brother. "No. I'm not." From the passenger side, he could see the entrance of the barn - young people wearing eclectic, brightly colored clothing poured in. Flags were strewn all across the entrance, each with different stripes of blue, pink, purple, black, yellow. Sam squinted to look at the sign emblazoned above the front door - HAPPY PRIDE. He turned to Dean with a stiff chuckle. "Besides, this doesn't seem like your kind of place anyway."
Dean didn't remember much from after the Empty pulled him out. He could decipher flashing memories from inside the cell as Empty Meg caved in on herself, creating a black vortex. He knew he'd grabbed Cas as the Empty flung him through the dark abyss. But then, nothing. Cut straight to the floor.
The sound of explosion was delayed a few seconds. When it finally reached them, it was all-powerful and consuming, eliciting a pain unlike any they had experienced before. Cas could feel his skull clattering, his vision disappearing. He remembered this was how he felt when the Empty took him - it was the feeling of death. He took a final breath and let himself fall unconscious in the void.
Meg smiled and met Dean's gaze. "You wanna get outta here? The Empty wants to help, and she's dying to see you."
"I've been humming with grace ever since you swooped in to rescue me." Dean examined his fingers as his veins glowed gold.
"Goddamnit, Dean." Sam stood up and paced the room, rubbing his forehead and crying in a rush of despair and anger. This wasn't the first time he'd found Dean dead on the floor, undoubtedly in some valiant effort to save the world. He always did this - he always chose the dangerous plan, taking any means to achieve the ends.
After her strained conversation with the Empty, Meg snapped back into herself with a jolt. Dean and Cas watched her intently.
But then he went through the usual routine: his hope faded, he remembered Cas wasn't real. "Way to ruin the moment, Cas," said Dean bitterly. He'd grown resentful of Cas's dream appearances.
Dean's face furrowed in confusion. "You're talking about our Jack, like, 'cries when he steps on a bug' Jack?"
As they reached the top of a hill, they saw bright colored lights illuminating the sky a few miles in the distance. The source of the lights materialized as they grew closer - a large pink barn with colored lights lining the roof. A roadside sign informed them that they were in the town of Belton in Cass County, and that the "Beer in a Barn" bar was three miles ahead.
"Yes. He cried briefly during a difficult conversation. I assure you, he's alright. I soothed him, and we spent the rest of the evening laying together and being close."
to fix. This part is written all wrong." Chuck pointed between the two of them, "Angels and humans. Mating. I mean, come on. Look at each other. Look!"
"More of a lightweight, but I'll take it. Guess who's back and badder than ever?" Rowena clicked into the room in her heels, trailing her Oscar de la Renta Fil Coupé gown behind her. Light black fabric illuminated her skin, bright flowers and green vines spreading over her dress as she walked. "Ladies. Haven't seen you since the last apocalypse. How are you?"
Weaving through the computers, he picked one in the back. The furthest from the group. He pushed a USB into the drive, whispering quietly to Charlie in his ear as he sat. "I'm in."
"It's creepy when you stare at me like that." Jack glared from the bed, blonde hair all fuzzy with wavy curls.
Dean could wince over the memory. Making those pancakes with Cas. How Cas started them so poorly that Dean had to rescue the batter bowl. How utterly married he felt to this angel, stirring in whatever he could to fix the butchered pancake recipe while Cas grates russets with all of the energy it took him not to start an argument over something so small. Cas had glared into the grater, arms putting on a show as he forced the large potatoes into shreds. Dean remembers not understanding why Cas was even upset. Was it because Sam walked in on them? Was it because Dean denied feeling something when they were close? Was it because they were close at all? All Dean knew was that he messed up.
The angel took Dean's hand, leading him to the big bed in the center of the room. Black silk sheets, thick comforters, puffy pillows looked safe and warm. The angel sat him down on the edge of the bed. Instead of sitting beside him, Castiel knelt at Dean's feet. A knee hit the floor before Dean and he gazed up at the hunter, keeping his hand held. "I have to tell you something."
"Dean is such a passionate man. Especially in bed. It takes some getting used to, but we'll find our rhythm soon enough."
Dean strolled into the kitchen with a big grin on his face, closing his bedroom door behind him in a pair of jeans and a black tee shirt. He walked over to the coffee pot, shoulders dancing and whistling a tune only he could place. Pouring himself a mug, Dean sighed, smelling that perfect morning coffee on this beautiful day. He let out a peaceful smile. Blowing on the mug, he took a savoring sip. "Mmm." Dean strolled over to the bar top table, where his brother had a laptop open. He set the mug of coffee down beside his brother, looking at Sam's grumpy face as Sam refused to give him eye contact. Dean glowed. "Good morning, Samuel."
Chuck. Killing the Winchester's son because Dean couldn't. Jack, crying out in pain as Castiel tried to save his life. Sam shooting Chuck. Chuck pronouncing their world dead. Chuck snapping his grubby little fingers and ending it all. The raising of the souls. Castiel's pain wiping out every soul before them. Jack, burning in their arms.
"You can take your angel radio, and shove it up your ass." Meta grinned, lifting their wine cooler in cheers. "
He watched the angel patiently for any cues. How should he move forward with him. What does he say? They kissed a few minutes ago. Dean glanced at Castiel's lips. He wants to kiss him again. But he can't. He wished and wished for it while he felt himself zone out, looking at his angel.
"The sexual situations I've had in the past have been suboptimal. I felt like I was doing it because... I should. Not because I desired sex or cared for them. My body felt nice at times, but I was ultimately detached from it. Sex is confusing. I had to do a lot of guessing. I didn't like that much. I wasn't raised with this around me. I've seen it, I understand why it exists. But suddenly having a human body after being alive for thousands of years is jarring. Sex is something I experience in a way that you won't understand, and I cannot possibly explain it." Castiel said honestly, "I don't think I'll ever be fully connected to it. And Chuck was right. Human sexuality wasn't made for me to enjoy."
Jack walked right into the front door of the Crawford. He strolled casually past the front desk and security and walked right into the locker room to steal a few uniforms. Once he realized he could use his powers to help find Metatron, Jack swore to them that he could go invisible. His fathers didn't believe him until they hit the Nevada state line. Suddenly, the boy disappeared in the backseat after trying for hours. Dean stomped on the gas, craning his neck back as Castiel and Sam looked at the empty space where their son used to be. As if that hadn't given them enough of a scare, Jack reappeared with his palm raised in greeting and a smirk on his face. "Hello!"
Castiel gave Sam an exhausted look. "I know. But, I'll ask Dean to pack some water and an cut an apple for him while I get him into something more responsible before the bowling game. He'll calm down eventually. When he's ready, we'll head downstairs and we'll pick a bowling lane."
Dean picked his head back up, "I dont mean to. It slips out of me when I'm around you. I just... I don't know why."
Dean walked past the Krispy Kreme counter to head to his Pizza Hut side, sweet tooth fully activated. He gazed at the display donuts with desire in his eyes. Chocolate. Strawberry frosting. Lemon creme filling. And the seasonals?
Cas looked into Dean's eyes, mirroring his pain as he pleaded, "He was crying. He was hurting. I was right there. I tried to transfer my grace to him, but he just ... he was just... after all of this how can he be gone. I mean just minutes ago, he was the most powerful thing on Earth, and now he's not even on...."
Dean stopped painting the walls and peeked behind him for a moment to watch as Jack and Amara stepped up to play their part. He reached across the wall and tapped Cas's trenchcoated shoulder. Castiel met Dean's eyes, and the hunter directed his attention to their son.
The trees had grown in thick, blanketing the night sky in even more darkness with their looming height. Two diner stops and several tank refills later, their eyes had started to droop. They'd been on the road for about fifteen hours. Time to call it quits. They need to stretch their legs and get some sleep.
"Dean asked you to watch the stars with him last night, and you spent hours staring at me instead of running to him and telling him how you feel--"
"Okay, okay. I'm coming." Dean adjusted his apron. "I'm gonna be flirting with those sorority girls too though. Just so ya know."
Dean stopped breathing for a second as he read the cover. He didn't remember how he got it, but the book was in his hands and he was flipping through it silently with wide eyes. Dean sighed and looked up at Cas, sharing a heartfelt gaze with the angel. He glanced at the living room where Sam was on the couch watching Jack play what looked like PacMan. His palms grew sweaty and he gulped, feeling impulsive.
Castiel scoffed, "I don't know about that. He's seen more in the first three years of his life than anyone should in all their days. I just wish I could have protected him better."
Before they went downstairs, Castiel got him dressed so that he could blend in better with the humans. The angel pulled Jack from his arcade match with Dean. He let Jack choose part of the outfit, holding up two sweaters. Jack chose a tan one with a shawl collar. Then Cas tossed him a pair of jeans and sneakers. Jack started crying because he didn't want to be out of the dinosaur suit, but Cas comforted him and rubbed his back and told him Dean was cutting an apple for him.
Meta spoke up from the bar top table, still eating an omelette. "A minute ago you two hated each other."
He had picked out the comfy black pair he'd shoved in his pocket while shoplifting in a department store's lingerie section in Indiana last fall. They were small, concealable, cozy.
Cas felt a bit guilty for missing what Dean said. But he couldn't help but smile back, because he still understood. Castiel Fell for this enthusiasm. This voice. This mind. This man. He was still just as righteous as he was when they met. Even if Cas wandered away sometimes, he always finds his way back to him. "You tend to do that."
"Years of online therapy, and I still struggle. Thanks for noticing." Sam rolled his eyes, "Know what you're making for dinner yet?"
Sam smiled, watching his son wash the dishes, "Yeah. Also, just a heads up, I'd stay out of the garage. At least until noon."
"S-sleep with Cas?! I wouldn... I -- sleeping -- w-ith Cas is... hold on, for a second, I don't-- I could never." Bowed legs stomped as he stuttered.
"Then let's call our heavy hitter. What about Amara? She seemed excited to reconnect with it." Dean scooted closer, eyes wide. "Let's invite her tomorrow when we summon Billie. Maybe we can convince them both to go to bat for you." Dean pointed, "Those two might be able to dissolve your deal without breaking a sweat. And if you need a mouthy human with an attitude problem to fight for your freedom, I will. Always."
Taking the handkerchief from Castiel, Dean patted under his own eyes and pulled the phone from his ear, "Such a gentleman, Cas. Thank you."
Castiel shrugged, "That would be genetics. Lucifer's were so big and bright and golden, that he was nicknamed the Morning Star. Whenever he entered a room, it was like the sun rose in Heaven. Yours may rival his yet. You'll learn to walk with them."
He stirred at a big bowl, it's wet contents sloshing around and splashing his coat as he concentrated on mixing. This was his first time making pancake batter. Dean could tell from halfway across the kitchen that the angel had used way too much milk. They're gonna have a lot of pancakes. Dean can tell. Too many to eat. He rolled his eyes, grating homegrown Kansas russet potatoes to make some hash browns, "Cas, throw a little more flour in there. Baking powder too. You gotta dry out that batter just a bit. Any wetter and we're gonna end up with crepes."
"Don't forget to ward your room." Castiel called out to his son. He raised his hand and waved it, the doors of rooms two and three unlocking and opening as they approached them. "If I can do this, it's not strong enough."
Sam was six feet four inches tall. He could see absolutely everything from the back seat. They'd been holding hands for twenty minutes. Sam glanced over at Jack, sleeping soundly on his shoulder. Whenever Dean and Castiel decide to have The Talk with them, Sam's gonna have to take Jack on a trip to the GameStop in Kansas City. Dammit, PlayStations are expensive.
Dean reached over the table and patted his wrist. "If this tracking spell pans out, I'll John Rambo his ass the second we see him. Just for you, okay, baby?"
Castiel pointed to his friend's butt, "It was there. You look so lovely while you work, I couldn't help myself. If my gaze makes you feel uncomfortable I can look elsewhere."
In a swift move, Castiel knelt on the carpet and threw the angel blade. The hard metal blade sailed through the air bullet quick aimed right at Meta. It stabbed into the wall beside Meta's head, a tuft of brown curls dangling from the wall. The blade had been so close to stabbing them that it took a couple strands of hair. Castiel stood, brushing off his knees. Dean handed Castiel his blade, trusting the angel to take things over. Meta gasped loudly, a delicate hand pressed against the side of their head. They gripped their hair in a bunch in their fingers.
Castiel stared into his eyes. There was so much love looking back at Dean, he could hardly take it. It's like Cas wanted to look at him like this the entire time. But there was a whole part of who Cas is that he was holding back. The part that wants so badly to belong to a human and mate with it for life. His blue eyes were large and unfocused, pretty and misted over with a touch of sadness.
Castiel thought to himself. He screeched silently in his mind. This feeling was best described in the celestial language of seizure inducing screams. Best keep that in.
He tapped the kid, noticing he had set his screen name to JackAttack3. Dope. Dean noted, "Whoa. Looks like fun, squirt. What level you on?"
Dean pointed at the motel room with the light on, "He was in there turning the coffee pot off and bringing out the last of the bags."
After they'd finished their breakfast, they cleared the table. Jack put the empty dishes into the sink. Sam left the room to get what he needed for the tracking spell a short while ago, returning with a small lead lined curse box. The box rattled as he walked with it, a few of it's contents rolling around inside.
"Hey, Amara. Billie." Sam waved as he followed Jack into the bar, taking a long look around. "Sorry we're late.
"Hey!" Dean pushed Cas's shoulder back boyishly before the angel could move, tilting his head toward the car before heading back to the hood, "Watch close this time, baby."
The Winchester family sat in silence at the breakfast table. Billie's sudden absence left an empty space in the room. Each task seemed to come with its various complications, and her newest demand was looking to be no different.
Amara crossed her legs, examining her nails. "So, we're taking advice from traitors now, Meta? Cute."
"Crowley taught me a thing or two about deals when I was a demon. He was trying to get me ready for the throne. Every day, he'd slip me a fact about the court system, laws, weapons, crossroads, spiritual transactions, you name it. Crowley had this saying: you get more when you phrase it properly. As an equal party in this deal, you have rights to whatever you want as long as long as it matches the details of your agreement. Cosmic law isn't about power, it's about about proving you followed the rules and took as much as you possibly could. That's why I was so pissed when you killed Billie after she helped get us out of prison. She could have taken either one of us for breaking the blood pact, but she became Death and saw the bigger picture." Dean said, leaning into the angel. "Now, Crowley was a piece of work, but he knew a Hell of a lot about bargaining. I learned from the best."
Dean's fingers slipped back into Castiel's hair. He tilted his head back and breathed hard. Then he looked back up and confessed to his angel, "I like it when my partner is rougher with me. Maybe it's cuz I fight so much, I don't know. But when I'm in bed, I like a bruise or two. So, if you scratched me... or slapped me... or even if..." Dean took the hand Cas had on his ass and moved it up his chest. Castiel watched as Dean placed his palm against his human throat.
Okay, not now. Cas sighed, putting the rest of the gaskets into his left pocket. Watching close was definitely an order he could follow.
Castiel's eyes rolled back for a second. Oof. He always been attracted to that aggravated, snappy side of Dean. Rarely is Castiel hissed at by such a grumpy little powerless human. Dean is different though. He's always annoyed, always whining, always tired of everybody's attitude. It's adorable to the angel. But when he growls an order at Cas with that sharp cut tone to his voice? Let's just say that Dean could put his angel in his place, and get away with it.
Castiel pulled his hand from Dean's neck as if it was burnt. He doesn't want to choke him. At all. Ever. He's too delicate. Too human and fragile. If Cas loses control for even a moment... absolutely not. He won't risk it.
." The younger Winchester brother went back to his spellbook, packing it up as Rowena walked past him to check on a second spell. Amara had placed something on the floorboards that effected the power of dieties like her and her brother. Soon, Jack will have to be careful with it as well.
They sat in a diner in Emory, nursing coffees and chatting. Jack bounced in his seat, full of energy as he colored the back of the children's menu. He sat with one leg tucked underneath him and the other on the floor. A cheap green crayon sat pinched between his fingers as he colored a cowboy hat. He drew little pictures on the blank page with deep concentration.
"But, what if he did?" Sam's eyes widened, he stood up, pointing his finger in realization, "If he lived, we might be able to pull this off. Finding him, I mean."
Dean wiggled his shoulders with excitement, "Wow. The Winchester Family Summer Vacation. Has a nice ring to it."
Jack walked calmly under the florescent lights in the basement past the maids, janitors, and support staff. Everyone shuffled through, a mix of uniforms and duties. Strong women and men pushed wheeled bins full of sheets and towels, nearly hitting the boy. They couldn't see him. Perfect.
Good. Everything was finally becoming good. The Winchesters were a family again. They were all working together to fullfil Billie's plan. Soon, Chuck will be vanquished and finally, there will be peace. Things were looking up.
Dean groaned and pushed himself out of the angel's arms with furrowed eyes and a scowl. "I could have had five more seconds with him and you know it."
"Whichever one you give me, man." Dean said sweetly, heart beating right there on the counter. "That's my favorite."
Dean sliced into his sausage. "Yeah! But I used Mrs. Butterworth's and some dollar store strawberry jam instead of the real thing. You shoulda seen his face though." The hunter chuckled as he took a bite of his breakfast, "He moaned super loud! And the couple in the room next door started banging on the wall. Oh, my god it was priceless."
Lunch finally came. Sam ordered a grilled shrimp salad with avocado vinagrette. Dean and Castiel both ordered cheeseburgers and fries. Jack just wanted pancakes. Sam made him order a fruit cup and some carrots. The nephil boy was enthusiastic about the fruit cup. The carrots, not so much.
Sam rubbed Jack's shoulder as Dean asked, "We were going to head out and come back for you Saturday, but I don't think the car can drive in this rain. Is there any way we could stay with you until the storm lets up?"
"Yeah. Of course." Dean's heart pounded hard under his shirt. He dipped his head to look at the angel through the window, patting the bench beside him. "Best seat in the house. All yours."
"Wanna help out Paris Hilton's BFF over there real quick and then get back to business?" Dean pressed a kiss to his cheek before putting a bit of casual distance between him and his new beau.
Dean let out a large breath, shoulders falling as they lost tension. "That's such a relief. I could have sworn you didn't want anything to do with sex until maybe this morning. So, I'm still a little tense."
"Dean, you on the other hand, seem like you're still the Dean Winchester I know and love. Still kicking, shooting, and making monsters eat it. Still... fighting me. Like I knew you would." Chuck winked. "It's cute. That you think you'll win. It's cute. And I hope you keep being cute. Because the second I get sick of you, I am going to flick you so hard off the game board that your body shoots through the stratosphere. Consider this a warning. Keep your hands off of that angel."
Turns out, Dean didn't figure out what to say. He spent the shower drowning in the hot water with anxiety sweats. Scrubbing and scrubbing, he decided the best course of action was to wear the panties to bed under his nightclothes. That way, he'd have the security of knowing Cas won't find them hiding around the motel.
"And mine isnt? That spot belongs to me and Chuck. It's ours. We wrote the tablets there. His autobiography. All of it. Everything except the Winchester Gospels. He went solo on that. Probably why the series was such garbage." Meta breathed out shallowly, "We lived there together for weeks cooped up all alone. Every thought he had, he shared with me. Every word. Powerful and divine. He was my everything. Worship doesn't even begin to cover it, Castiel. Whatever I could feel, I felt for him and when he left... I couldn't take it. I ran. Just like him. I knew he'd hide on Earth, so I did too. I knew him as a shorter man with dark curly hair, so I picked my vessel hoping..." Meta bowed their head, curls falling over their face. "One day he'd see himself in me. And if he did, maybe he'd stay."
Castiel found a remote on the bed, pressing buttons curiously as he answered Dean. "That's nice, Dean. I'm glad you're enjoying the... accommodations."
Two more hard booming thunderclaps burst in the sky, brightening the dark cloudy sky as rain fell in sheets. Sam placed his hand on Jack's shoulder and Jack looked up at his strong dad, leaning into him for safety. He remembers reading about Chuck's thunderstorms. They were violent. Catastrophic. Many people died. His tyrannical rains flooded and poured in ways so damaging, the Greeks created Zeus as a tulpa to rationalize Chuck's anger.
"Yes." Castiel answered honestly, without a hint of contrition. He was, he'll admit to that. Dean had a lovely ass.
The gruff hunter bargained best he could, but all that was available were single rooms with pullout couches. That might make things awkward. Dean passed over the hacked debit card Charlie made for the motel manager to make the transaction.
He closed his eyes and kept pushing forward to the other side of the store. Away from the donuts. There's not enough time to buy one before he has to clock in. Later.
Dean cackled. "I'll be making that sound tonight, that's for sure. Gotta make up for those four minutes somehow."
Castiel glared. To be fair, he was a little worried about it. The angel watched as Dean jogged ahead of him, waving at the woman to get her attention as he approached her. The woman looked up. She was confident, brown hair falling down her shoulders as she gave him an attractive smile. She gestured to all the bags. "Ah. Bellboy. I was just about to ring the desk. I need all of these in the front closet before my boss comes back from pilates or she'll eat me alive. Literally."
They locked eyes for a long moment, sharing that time together and breathing it in. Cas mouthed the words "thank you" to Dean from across the room.
"Fine, but don't call me baby. I'm not a baby." Castiel set down the bowl on the counter. The batter splashed up, hitting his coat with more spots and streaks. "Uh oh."
Castiel folded his arms, nodded at all the bags "Oh, yes, look at how hard her life is. Must have been a tragedy being so beautiful while spending all of that money on luxury items in absolute comfort."
Dean tapped his forehead against the fridge door and groaned loudly. "We were so connected at that one moment that I pierced the veil of his vessel and
Billie started to stand, hand gripping her scythe. She gritted her teeth at the sound of the doors rattling. After a moment of fumbling with the door knob, the doors finally pushed open revealing the Winchester family armored up with tan and green canvas sacks on their backs. Jack held up his hand, grinning broadly. "Hello."
"Dad." Jack sat up straighter, looking sternly at his father, "My parents love each other. You have to know what this means to me. To our family."
Dean smiled into Castiel's hair, "Please. You love this. I think you just wanted it to be a prayer."
Jack smiled over at Sam from behind Cas's head as the angel stopped running. They walked over to the Winchester's confidently as Jack said, "I wanted to spook ya. Did it work?"
Ghosting his way down long halls and cavernous rooms, he eventually found himself in the back of the basement. There was a steep dip in the floor to make space for large trucks for shipments, accessible by a ramp. There was a huge gated door for the trucks. Beside it, a human sized door.
"Let's play something called... Undercover." Castiel said, meeting his son's eyes and providing the positive energy he Jack needed to mirror. The boy had to believe in himself. He's strong, powerful, good. And that needs to be at the forefront of Jack's mind. If Jack is feeling out of place, it's not Cas's job to make him stuff it down. It's his job to help his child work through his emotions in a way he can understand, and see beauty within himself. If he doesn't do that, he fails as a parent. Castiel is a lot of things, but he isn't a failure. Jack is not a grown up. He's a kid. So, Cas spoke his language instead of expecting Jack to conform to what the adults in his life wanted. "We can't use this boring grown up outfit for the game, so we'll put that aside. But unfortunately, we can't use the cool dinosaur costume either. For this special brand new game, I need you... to pick out something that a secret agent would wear. On his way to a super secret mission."
Chuck raised his hand and Jack grinned, eyes flashing bright, casting a strong ray of light out of his hands. The nephil yelled, fingers outstretched as Chuck fell back in slow motion. He was suspended in the air, falling for a long moment as he succumbed to Jack's power.
"Silence!" Amara walked ethereally to the center of the room, barefoot and one with the earth. Right in front of the stormy window, she stopped, turning to command the group. Then she opened her arms to the company before her, clapping hard once. The rain stuttered for a second, hovering in the air as it fell on the other side of the window. The thunder behind her ceased. The lightening darkened. She raised her chin and the rain started again.
Dean smirked, "So... you really wanted to kiss me, huh? Took Chuck himself ending it all for you to plant one on the Righteous Man."
. It's just." Sam said, picking up another dirty plate and lathering it with his soapy sponge. "You and Dean should stay up here. Me and Jack, we'll play a couple rounds. You'll hardly miss us. Give me an hour and a half... two hours maybe. I'll read him a book when we get back here to wind him down, so we don't bother you guys. He should be asleep and tucked in by 9. Probably will be dressed as a dinosaur though."
"Hey, Dean!" There was a sharp knocking at the door. Sam. Ugh, that kid was such a block. Always has been. Just like that, this moment was no longer perfect. But, it never would be. Would it?
By the time Castiel and Jack got to the living room, it was full. The thunderstorm still poured outside the window, rain smacking the windows as the angel and nephil descended the black metal staircase together. Jack's sneakers hit the steps as he rushed down the steps to Sam and Dean, dragging Cas by his hand. The boy wore a black suit with dark sunglasses with a fake plastic earpiece and a big suitcase he found in Sam's room. He was beaming as he hurried down the steps with Castiel, waving broadly. "Hi, Billie! Hi, Amara! I'm ready for the secret mission!"
Cas rolled his eyes, "You've been praying to me for hours, but I can't hear any of your words. It's just been a loud jumble of yelling and strange noises, what do you want to tell me?"
"Ow! Receiving prayers gives me headaches." Jack shook his head, placing a hand on Castiel's forehead, "Does it hurt?"
The boy's face lit up when he saw the spread, and it positively made Dean's day. He's glad the kid didn't seem so defeated anymore. He's glad they made up. As Dean spotted Jack hovering in the kitchen doorway, he pulled Cas in close by the elbow and asked him to finish setting up the plates for everyone.
That was Castiel's greatest excuse yet to avoid Dean. He had to though. If he didn't, what would have happened? They'd sneak off into the Impala and drive twenty minutes down the road to that nice wheat field Dean likes. There, the sky was clear and for miles there would be nothing but flat land and home grown farms. No people, no traffic, no noise. Just the two of them in nature. The stars shone so brightly, they were mesmerizing. And Dean could watch them for hours, freckles mimicking their constellations under the moonlight. He would look beautiful. So very beautiful. Castiel may find himself a victim of the Empty in minutes.
Castiel looked and acted more or less like he usually does, successfully playing the role of a disinterested angel. Dean on the other hand was a hopeless lovestruck buffoon. He blushed constantly. Dean stammered over his speech and touched Castiel's arm and gazed over at the angel, hanging onto his every word. Probably doesn't even know he's doing it. Sam took another sip of coffee. That's his brother.
Sam sighed, rolling his eyes. "Wow. If only there were someone here who's only job today was painting on a wall. We would be done by now. And, if
Sam walked into the kitchen, looking for his son. He found the toddler splashing about joyously in the sink instead of cleaning much of anything. It was sweet, if not extremely messy. Sam's gonna have to mop in here. That's fine. His kid is finally a kid again. He'll take the clean up if that means Jack can feel happiness again. He didn't know what kind of blessing that had been.
Meta narrowed their eyes for a second, considering the boy's words. "You're right. I admit, I didn't want to hear you guys."
Billie shifted under her cloak's hood and waved her scythe around. "I don't have a cell phone. Just open a window and shout it into the ether."
It's the end of the world. Well and truly. And, Dean's the type to play that card, but when the chips are down and it's the bottom of the ninth, an 11th hour soul hook up isn't really his top priority. Tonight is no exception. But, the finality of it all. Looking Chuck in his cold, careless eyes as he cast their world aside. They have three weeks, a month tops before it's all a barren wasteland and their home becomes another dream walker's Bad Place.
Dean winked at Castiel and walked backwards toward the Pizza Hut side of the shop, "I... I'll see you later."
Dean looked at him through the mirror, cheeks and neck burning as he started the car, "No, drop it. We're going home."
Cas set Jack down beside Sam. He ruffled his hair warmly before returning a high five Jack prompted, "Go give your dads a hug, okay? You scared them half to death."
Castiel smiled fondly at Dean, in awe of his creativity. His imagination was so strong, so human. Cas loves that about him.
"And you ignored her advice." Sam said, stuffing his phone back into his pocket. "Metatron's definitely alive and well. Probably got some big bitch power behind him too if The Book is warning us away. Usually this thing has no problem letting us die bloody. She never speaks like this. Something's got her scared."
The meglomaniacal diety walked in with thundering steps and a dark look clouding his eyes. His presence sucked the air out of the room. Everybody watched. All eyes were on him. Mouth twisted into a grimace, brows pinched tight, and hands balled into fists at his sides, Chuck sneered at every person in the bar, looking each one in the eyes. He stepped across the room in a pair of jeans and a clean blue oxford, chuckling manically to himself as the doors slammed closed behind him. Amara sat casually on the bar top, feet dangling from the edge as she sipped her kombucha. "Charles. You're late."
The human confessed. "It's featured in a kids book. Harry Potter. I picked up the box set for Jack's 4th birthday and I flipped through it again. You know, just to keep sharp in case he asks me anything or... wants to go on a trip to that theme park they made."
Dean watched Cas's hand in his pants, biting his lip as his eyes glazed over a bit more. "While you were sucking me off, were you--"
He strode over to the Impala, about fifty feet away. As Dean walked, he could see Sam's maps rolled up under Jack's arms. Jeez, the hell? Right now? Can't they wait until everyone gets settled? Oy.
"My pleasure." As soon as Jack cleared the stairs, Sam whispered, "Is Dean okay? No hard feelings, but if you're making my brother cry you know I have to kill you, right?"
Sam had laughed. Jack remembers Sam telling him that if Dean and Cas admitted to feeling anything romantic for each other in the next five years, he'd buy the kid a PlayStation.
Chuck let out a dark cackle, "Jack Kline Winchester. Insolent little abomination. I don't mind killing you a second time. I could use the cardio."
Dean waved goodbye to Cas, pointing at his smiling lips before making a pleading motion with his hands.
Dean tightened his grip on his disposable coffee cup. He took another long sip, gazing back at the motel room through the window. Warm yellow light was streaming in through the curtain and a trenchcoated figure hovered past it. Dean's heart knocked against his chest wall. He couldn't wait to see him again...
Castiel stated, "Well, I've known him since 2008! I saw more than enough to be sure he would laugh at me if I said anything. Or worse. He'd yell. Tell everyone. I would have to leave. I'd be ruined and our friendship would be over. I do love your father, it's true. But I love him for who he is. A human with a short life. I love all of his flaws and beauty and heart and passion and pain equally. I know I don't deserve him. So does he."
"They love you too, Jack." Castiel pushed five more feathers off of the nephil's back. They fell to the floor in a silent gentle heap. Oh, boy. Maybe his soul is being affected by the external love and validation he got from Sam. Jack won't feel better until he's sure -- until he can do the work within himself to feel like Jack again. It will take a lot of time and effort, and a lot more love from his parents. But it's possible. With his archangel grace restored and his soul growing with love, Jack is becoming... Jack.
Sam sighed heavily, rolling his eyes before leaning over and whispering to the angel, "Look, I know. About you guys' relationship. And it's cool. I just want you two to be happy. It looks like you are. So, if you wanted to spend time in Dean's room tonight, I'll keep the kid out of your hair for a couple hours. You two can relax and snuggle up or do whatever it is you two want to do without any distractions or judgement. Sound good?"
The car was parked outside in a Chuck-level thunderstorm. To keep from succumbing to winds, lightning, and enough rain water to flood a small town, the Winchester family stayed inside Amara's protected hotel. Unfortunately, Castiel only really wore one outfit and it's in the Impala. He was doomed to walk around dressed as a bellhop until they finished waiting out the storm for the next two days. That didn't sit well with him. The jacket made him feel more like the Sam and Dean's butler instead of their fellow coparent. He'd already been called Alfred twice, which is two times too many. Castiel borrowed some of Dean's new clothes while the human took a shower.
Tongue resting gently between his sharp teeth, Dean grinned sweetly as he stepped into Castiel's space and plucked the gasket out of his hand. He held it up between two perfect fingers. Then he winked. "Thanks for being quick with that tool box."
Face lighting up at the sight of his room, Dean freed his hand from Cas and jogged to the bathroom. The light came on as he walked in. Wooden floors continued in here, but the counter and sink and toilet and tub were all carved from large dark stones of onyx. A glass rainfall shower with six wall jets had been tucked neatly into a corner. The bathroom mirror opened up to toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash, floss, cleanser, soap, moisturizer, and shaving supplies. Was that? Dean peered closer at a medium sized bottle. Oh. There was lube in here too. Dean blushed, closing the mirror cabinet.
"Oft, Dean! Never mind you." Rowena pushed her fingers into her hair in frustration as she began to pace
Jack changed the green crayon to a blue one as he drew, colors transforming on the page. He laughed loudly, scribbling and changing the color again. Red. Orange. Purple. Yellow. Jack giggled. He loves being himself. He loves doing things his way. And he loves coloring. His eyes flashed gold for a second as he drew, bouncing merrily.
"Can you give us like an hour? You know what, that's stretching it. This has been building up for a while. We'll probably be done in like four minutes." Dean chuckled with anticipation, "Actually, I
"What do you think I mean, dollface? Hot young linebacker fella, cute little thing like yourself... you two gave a pretty show from where I was sitting."  Chuck sneered. "I just
"Jack, you are perfect just the way you are. Okay? Look." Castiel shook his head and promised. "You haven't had it easy, son. I hear you. Your fathers and I are working really hard to give you a better childhood. We'll be free from the constant battles after Chuck is dealt with. After that happens you, me, and your dads will be able to have any life we choose. They want to make some changes, I know you do too. This fight is stressful for all of us. I'll talk to Sam and Dean about giving you more freedom wardrobe wise. And fun wise. Soon, all of this mess will be over." Castiel tapped his nose, "And you will be free to be yourself."
The angel strolled out of the room in a huff, coat billowing behind him as he took to the halls. Castiel paced hard, shoes tapping against the tile as he took step after step. It's past three in the morning. Dean's probably asleep. Jack was right. Castiel stood him up.
Castiel felt his head turn in confusion as the human finished tying his shoes. Dean grabbed his flannel and his jacket. Castiel blinked, "Dean, it's the middle of the night. Where are you going?"
"Hard on me?! You have no idea." Dean pushed at Cas's chest sharply as he cried out. "I've never felt so much grief in my life, Cas. Watching you die like that almost killed me. I don't wanna fucking do it again."
. All things he'd never really felt before. Cas could hardly believe it. It was new to him, but he doesn't think it's a bad thing. Not at all. Just different. This place has a silver lining. Whether Sam can see it or not.
Dean let out a long breath, laughing at his nervousness and holding up the small bag of whole white mushrooms. "Good. I'm gonna make omelettes."
Meg sat on a wrinkled leather armchair with her arms and legs crossed. She cocked an eyebrow. "Lookie here, Miss All-Powerful. I got an angel trapped in there. And I'm damn tired of walking by his cell and watching you act all tough, like you don't care."
He put his forehead to Cas's with a distraught sigh and closed his eyes tightly, thinking, thinking, thinking.
"Hey, don't forget about me," said the person sitting next to her. He stood up and faced them too - it was Chuck.
Cas smiled sadly. "I am merely a projection. Not really here, but out of your head." He paused. "It's nice to see you again, Dean."
Jack turned to Dean. "Here's payback for what you did to me." He swung his arm up; fist met flesh, and Dean crumpled to the floor. Then, he turned to Sam, raising his arm once more. Without making physical contact, he sent Sam plummeting to the ground with a wave of his hand.
Sure, he'd been tricked before by shapeshifters and phone calls from Lucifer, but he'd lost the naivety he once had. He wouldn't be so easily fooled.
"Oh, Dean." The Empty took a step towards him, her eyes dripping with venom. "I don't need Meg to tell me that." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I see your thoughts, the deepest recesses of your mind."
Billie stared at him skeptically for a second before realization dawned on her. "You don't know anything, do you?"
Tiny spots of golden light fluttered down from the clouds - like snowfall. The specks made their way down to Earth and illuminated the Kansas prarie field outside the bunker. Dean reached out a hand to touch the golden snow. Instead of cold, the specks were warm, like tiny balls of fire dropping from the sky. They filled Dean with physical warmth, but something else as well -- a distant feeling, one he hadn't experienced since childhood, but couldn't quite put a finger on what it was.
"Oh, it's easy peasy," said Meg, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Admit your deepest, darkest truth, and she sends you home."
"No, it's our last resort," said Eileen. She paused and thought for a second before looking back at Billie. "I know how these blood rituals work. I've used it before to exorcise an archangel." She stared at Billie determinedly. "If things go South, we push it up a notch. We aim to kill." She shook her head. "But not from the start."
Cas nodded. "It has been trying, yes." He smiled gently. "And it took me a while to realize what I was feeling." He stepped forward, closing the distance between them. "But now I know. You are the one thing I want. In every way imaginable."
Billie shot Eileen a look of exasperation. "We're gonna need all we got," she said. "Intention to kill is the only option."
While Chuck and Amara were transfixed on Cas, Billie, Meg, and the Empty crept their way around the ship towards the control deck.
He wasn't sure what the flags meant or what exactly all these people were proud of, and he stuck out like a sore thumb as the oldest person in a hundred foot radius. When he entered the barn bar, he was greeted by blaring pop music and a jet blast of AC. While the barn looked rusted on the outside, the inside was sleek and modern - dark glass tables surrounding a dance floor, with a smooth granite bar lining the back wall. Neon lights flashed everywhere, matching the equally blinding colors worn by the bar-goers.
Sam rushed forward to hug his brother. When they parted, Dean looked at Sam with a small smile, astonishment plastered on his face. "Sam, I'm still here. You did it. You saved me."
Dean looked at Cas longingly, just for second, before growing cold again. He couldn't afford to hope. He had to remember that. But this wasn't a dream anymore, he could tell. Dream Cas was blurry around the edges, always too far away to really see. This Cas was crisp, clear - the wisps of hair at the top of his head, the specks of grey in his eyes, the lopsided tie and trench coat. All of Dean's senses, his deepest intuitions, were screaming at him to believe what he saw - that Cas was next to him. Or at least, someone who
Dean softly pleaded, begging Sam to let him go. "I need...I need...I need you to tell me that it's okay. I need you to tell me...Tell me it's okay."
Hell was just as dreary as Sam remembered it from the last time he and Dean visited Rowena, except now there were potted dead flowers lining the hallways to spruce up the place. Must be a Rowena addition, he thought. He kept his hand firmly placed on the hilt of his knife and tried to remember the way to Rowena's throne room. This place creeped the hell out of him - no pun intended.
The man wore a Royals cap - Dean looked underneath at his face and recognized him as Paul from the bar. Paul sat down on the other side of Dean and placed a hand on his knee. "Good to see you again, champ."
Billie let out a short laugh. "The Empty is weak." She stepped closer to Sam and spoke in nearly a whisper. "She couldn't hold me down."
Sam allowed himself a small chuckle and then, after a moment, he looked back up at Dean. Sam was starting to put all his hazy memories from the barn together. "You're healed...I'm healed...you think that maybe - maybe it was an angel who saved us?"
"God's mission has not ended with Jack," Billie replied. "He acts through Jack to be the destroyer of worlds - to wipe the slate clean."
"After I was sent to the Empty, Jack appeared to rescue me." Cas looked at Dean fondly as he spoke. "And then, I rescued you."
As Sam drove away and Dean walked up to the bar, he started to see why Sam said this didn't seem like "his kind of place."
Sam watched his brother struggle to stay with it, his face drawn and resigned. He was giving up. This wasn't like Dean.
"It's what's left of them. Their power." Jack paused, looked to the sky, craning his neck to take it all in. "This doesn't belong to one person. Or two. It belongs to everyone. Humanity."
More silence rang out as they drove closer to the barn. Dean pulled into the parking lot and shoved the Impala into neutral, then turned to look at Sam. "You coming or not?"
Cas craned his neck to look behind them. Jack had emerged from his spot watching the stars, and walked toward them, his face furrowed in concentration and effort. He was enveloped in golden energy as he stared ahead at Chuck and Amara; their faces dropped in fear, just for a second. A racing feeling of hope danced in Cas's chest.
Cas eyed her suspiciously, while Dean stepped out of the cell to snoop around Naomi's office. Meg grabbed both of their arms and stood still for a moment, closing her eyes in intense focus. But nothing happened. "I thought I'd be able to access the Empty's powers." She huffed and tried again, to no avail, while Dean and Cas watched her keenly.
The Empty hated being in heaven. She hated being surrounded by angels who held their heads high as if they could do no wrong. Unquestioning machines, divorced from thoughts or feelings. She wanted to make them suffer just as they had caused suffering for humanity without restrain or regret.
Dean and Sam, still off-balance from Jack's blow, couldn't believe what they saw next. Billie, the Empty, and Cas all purged themselves of their shells as their vessels collapsed to the ground. Their energies twisted and turned in the air towards Jack, who, for a fleeting moment, stepped back in fear. But then he grinned confidently. "I can't wait to meet you all in the flesh."
Sam could tell he had dug himself a hole but pushed on regardless. "Are you able to contact Cas with two-way communication?"
Dean begged Sam to come closer and let him say his final words to his brother. Sam listened to Dean praise him and reminisce as tears rushed down their faces. Dean put his hand on Sam's chest; Sam covered it with his own.
A memory struck Cas, about a year ago, when he, Jack, and the Winchesters were cooped up in the Bunker trying to figure out how to save Jack from his prophesized death. The days were long and disheartening, but every Friday night Dean would corral Cas and Jack into his mancave for a movie night. He insisted that the two "awkward angel nerds" needed a taste of the best entertainment humans had to offer.
The frothing, glowing purple liquid inside the spell bowl lit up the faces of Sam and Eileen. They winced as a pungent smoked curled around them.
The Empty looked up at Meg, considering her options. "This Dean Winchester," she said, "what's his weakness?"
He slowly sat up in his bed, letting out a groan of exhaustion, rubbed his eyes and ran a hand through his hair. So he was alive. Great, but where was Dean? What
hello! sorry it took me a while to update - i've been busy! decided to split this chapter into two so i'd have something to post. enjoy!
Sam yelled, banging on Dean's door. Eileen could tell from his voice that something was very, very wrong.
Dean's hands clenched around the steering wheel as he stared straight ahead at the dimly lit road. It was a summer night in June, and they were on a case in the outskirts of Kansas City - one of its small town suburbs. Sam rubbed his temple as he watched sun set in the horizon. Dean was in one of his
Sam and Dean stood up with bruised faces and wary glances. They watched Jack circle the bunker. Jack paid them little mind as he rifled through spell books and ran his fingers over the table with their names engraved on it.
He, Billie, the Empty, and Meg found themselves in glistening control room. Lights, screens, and switches lined the walls, and tan chairs with seatbelts sat behind a large desk full of buttons, all facing the front of the capsule where there was a large window looking out into the final frontier. Space.
With another pained bellow from Jack, the flames began beams of bright golden light that pushed their way into the heavens. They hit the clouds with an ear-splitting boom, an explosion so intense that the ground shook beneath their feet. The entire sky lit up yellow, just for a second, then went black as if the light had short-circuited. They silently waited and watched Jack with baited breath, shrouded in darkness.
"Of course." Cas let go of Dean's hand, then met Dean's eyes as he spoke, his voice full of regret. "Naomi programmed me to trick you into coming here." He paused. "It took all my strength to get her out of my head, but by the time I escaped her grips, it was too late."
Sam's voice grew more desperate, more pained. They stood there for at least a minute in panic, calling Dean's name, with no response.
Dean closed his eyes and leaned into the feeling. Opened his soul just a bit as the warm sensation of grace flowed to his fingertips. He delicately placed Cas on the floor and lightly grazed his battered shoulders, stomach, face with his hands, just as Cas had done for him so many times.
Nothing but black space extended far out into the distance. The air was silent and still - he felt unnervingly lonely. But then, he sensed a presence behind him. He turned around to the familiar smirking face of Meg; but she wasn't Meg, he realized. The Empty, taking on Meg's form, stared at him coldly, broodingly, without any hint of Meg's usual playfulness.
Please. Please please please. Dean whispered as he clutched Cas's face and put a hand behind his back, lifting him up from the ground. He heard stilted breaths, he watched Cas's pained expression. Blood dripped down the side of Cas's face -- he weakly grabbed Dean's arm for stability.
Two hours after storming out on Sam, Dean was driving Baby on a country road somewhere outside of Lebanon.
The Empty cut her palm and let her blood fall into the pot with Cas and Billie's. A simmering noise sounded, followed by the smell of rotten eggs.
Then, a rush of sound and nausea washed over Dean as he collapsed to the ground yet again. Empty Dean grabbed the top of Dean's head and closed his eyes. Dean's vision tunneled, and he yelled in pain as he spiraled into unconsciousness.
Meg lifted her hand and slowly reached out to Dean. Dean watched her uneasily as she placed it on the top of his head and closed her eyes in concentration. In a few short moments, Dean collapsed onto the ground.
He couldn't drive any farther on this road - it was either back home or find some other country road to drive on in the dark. Dean sighed and crossed his arms, leaning further back into the seat. Another lasting effect from almost dying was nearly constant exhaustion, along with a ringing headache every once a while. However, he had figured out that all he had to do was touch his head to make the headaches go away. Upon contact, the warmth traveled through his fingers into his head and the ache was instantly be gone. A welcome change - but he refused to consider what may have caused it.
Cas's eyes glowed with gold; his wings flashed behind him; he raised his hand. Chuck was quick too, copying his motion and meeting Cas's beam of light with one of his own. A massive explosion lit up the entire room with a boom. For a second, Jack snapped out of his stupor, watching machines go up in flames as his vessel's occupants went flying in the air.
Sam reached for a knife, still clutching Dean with one arm. He gulped and watched as the light drew closer to them. His eyes stung just looking at it; he felt a searing sensation on his skin. An ear-splitting ringing noise filled the barn. Sam lowered to the ground, quickly but carefully bringing Dean with him, and ducked over his brother in cover.
Dean sprinted into the bunker and fell to his knees next to a motionless Cas on the floor. He put his hand on Cas's chest, searching for the whisper of a heartbeat. Cas's eyes fluttered upon contact. He was conscious. Alive. Just barely.
"Jack?" Sam reached out his arm for Jack's shoulder. A current of golden power struck him upon contact. Sam winced and jerked his hand away as a numbing sensation spread from where he made made contact with Jack. Nonetheless, he lifted up Jack around his shoulders and nodded his head for Dean and Eileen to help.
Sam slumped on the floor as the noise and light reached their peak. He joined his brother, unconscious against the barn wall, when the entity of light consumed them.
Dean shook his head in confusion, trying to piece the last couple nights together. "Sam, that wasn't me...it wasn't my choice...letting myself die. There was a siren at the bar-"
Sam saw a small tear run down Dean's face. After a long drink of beer, Dean set the bottle on the table and sighed, looking up at Sam. "Some things you just...you just don't say out loud. Hurts too much." He half rolled his watery eyes. "Of course, Cas, the idiot, he didn't get that."
John Winchester stepped closer to Dean and stared him down. "You've perverted everything I tried to teach you."
Dean tried to accept the only way forward was to move on - to give up. He couldn't live like this, constantly mourning the angel who could never return. He was so
"She...she took control again..." Cas paused, taking a shaky breath. He closed his eyes and grabbed his head with a groan. Dean kept hold of Cas, frozen as he watched Cas suffer helplessly.
"Into position," said Billie, and she started muttering an incantation into the pot of blood. Green smoke swirled around her and trailed over to Cas and the Empty. Billie grabbed them and pointed them to the door. "Stay close."
With stilted breath, the clatter of plastic onto the floor, Dean woke up in a panic and found himself in his old body where he'd left it - sprawled on the floor of his room with a handful of pills. He groaned and rubbed his forehead. He lifted his hand to his temple as his fingertips turned golden; the threads of shimmering grace danced from his hand to his head. He sighed in relief as the pain trickled away in a moment of peace before he realized two people were missing from his side.
He heard footsteps walking into the room. Three familiar faces - Jack, Naomi, and the Empty, using Meg as a vessel, huddled by the office desk.
Dean still felt the warmth of Cas's grace within him, but it had diminished since he downed the bottle of pills. Still, he could tell the grace was holding back the worst of his pain. He felt a splitting headache coming on; with the touch of his hand, the pain washed away.
Dean watched in horror as specks of black goo snuck around the corner of Cas's face. The speck materialized into two hands, reaching across the sides of Cas's face and pulling him backwards.
The more resentful she grew of God, the less power she had over her vessel. Meg was quite literally the devil on her shoulder, whispering to her not to cooperate, to rebel against God - this demon had audacity. But the Empty couldn't help but listen to Meg. She thought day and night of how to rebel. She kept track of God's weaknesses - she could tell Jack was starting to push through the surface, even for a few moments; she knew God had infallible trust in her, even though she constantly doubted him.
Sam knew what Dean would have wanted - for Sam never to put Dean above the whole world and not let his death be in vain. Sam knew all of that, all of Dean's righteous man bullshit. But in this moment, Sam didn't care about the fate of the world - he didn't care if it burned in flames or flooded or if everyone snapped away from existence. He wanted his brother and his best friend back.
Normally, Dean would reach for the hilt of his knife, splash holy water, and throw salt at the guy - the whole sha-bang. But ever since he sipped the drink, he was filled with a strange sense of trust towards Paul, as if in a trance. No questions asked.
The man patted Dean's shoulder with a chuckle. Then he gestured to the corner of the bar. "Jukebox machine's right there. Let's go hack it."
Dean's face switched from sentiment to confusion. Sam described what he had experienced back at the barn - the bright light, the deafening noise.
"Please." Sam tried to meet his brother's eyes again. "Please. Cas was my friend, too." He paused, wading over his words. "I want to know what happened."
"Hm." The Empty let out a small laugh and smiled at Dean with an icy stare. "I hear you're the expert at deceit, Dean Winchester."
For a second, Dean let himself believe it all made sense, that Cas's claim brought everything together. That Sam was right - Cas was alive, and he had saved Dean, yet again, just as he had done countless times before. But this fleeting hope was gone with a blink. Dean came to his senses and reached for his jacket pocket. He threw salt, holy water, to no avail. No signs Cas was a demon - Cas just watched and waited for Dean to be done.
Cas could hear the dryness in the Empty's voice. "Right. So powerful that your plan was disrupted by a puny angel."
"Not with you, sweetheart," said Meg, then she zeroed in on Dean with a smirk. "She asked for you, specifically - 'the human.' The angel has been through enough already, don't you think?"
Eileen stepped out from the door, and she stepped towards Jack with a glint of hope in her eye. "Is he still possessed?"
"A secret buried so deep, you can't even tell it to yourself," said Meg mystically. "But I'm no expert at getting to the truth. Perhaps you should have a one-on-one with the Empty. She's the best therapist around."
Cas closed his eyes and tried to concentrate on Rowena's voice, molding the words in his head to reply through prayer. His grace was low at the moment, and he desperately needed time to rest and repower.
A man and woman in swimwear walked up to his spot and smiled at each other, then at Dean. "Hey cutie," said the woman, sitting down next to Dean and placing a hand on his shoulder.
"Right." Sam pursed his lips and glanced at his watch. One minute until Eileen was supposed to bring him back. He looked back at Rowena. "Thanks for your help."
