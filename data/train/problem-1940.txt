“You’re thinking I didn’t give it enough of a fair go?” Sherlock quirked an eyebrow. “Dating . . . relationships . . . sex?” He drew out the last word challengingly.
“Yup, don’t you know.” Bill grinned. “Hey, John, don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”  He tipped his chin toward the bed, flashing a wink on the way out.
“Noooo. I’m always at your house.” John bumped into him playfully. “Don’t have a lot of extra time after that.”
Life at Hogwarts settled into a predictable schedule. The first true buzz of excitement came after notices appeared around school announcing the first weekend trip to Hogsmeade. As a prefect, John busied himself making sure all the Gryffindors had their permission slips in to attend. When a small boy named Conan realized he’d lost his, he nearly went spare, fisting his hands in his hair in a panic.
John swung his eyes back across the room. Sherlock’s robe was the deepest black, and it made his natural paleness look almost ethereal in the indoor lighting. His penetrating gaze bore into John, no doubt cataloguing everything about him.  Nothing for it, John dredged up some of the old Watson courage. He stepped forward, pasting a friendly smile over his stiff lips.  “Well, fancy meeting you here. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. As Mike said, it’s a small world. Look, you needn’t worry, I’ll stay out of your way  . . .”
The man’s eyes raked over John, cataloging, dissecting in a way that left him feeling nearly naked. John shivered. There was only one other man who could do that to him, though he actually enjoyed it when Sherlock spun his magic. This could only be . . .
Sherlock thought, as John’s mouth closed around the head of his cock. He pretended to have to think about it for as long as he dared before saying, “108.”
“Thanks, it took me days to find something that would drape well for the leaves. I found some moss in the garden . . .”
hands, square, sturdy, competent – it was something that Sherlock had long admired about his flatmate, his solidness, his there-ness.
“Oh, but you will be too busy charming the pants off everyone you meet anyway.” Bianca dropped a wink.
Sherlock mumbled something incoherent that might have been an echo of the sentiment, and they drifted off, tangled together as they were.  John blinked awake sometime in the middle of the night, and they both roused briefly to wash off, get a drink of water, and turn off the lights properly. They tumbled back together to sleep deeply until mid morning.
“What? Are you mental?” John’s eyes flew open wide. “I was talking with Victoire, and she told me what a big deal this Herr Moser bloke is. It will be okay, yeah? I mean we were going to be apart next year anyway. This just means we’ll be traveling by portkeys instead of simply apparating to be together, but we’ll make it work.” John paused to draw in a breath, his eyes searching Sherlock’s. “Love, say something.”
“I’ll go.” John jumped in. “Sherlock is new to the area – I can show him where the shops are? It won’t take a moment.”
“So, you’re looking rather . . . chipper today, though not very well rested.” Sherlock raised his eyebrows as he raked his eyes over Mycroft, clearly ready to torment his brother on his mysterious night away.
“It’ll come out in a few washings.” John smiled. “Here, just let me . . .” He scooted up to lean off the bed and turn off the small lamp on the chest of drawers.  John moved back down to settle Sherlock against him again. “There, now you can’t see it.”
“Thank you, sir.” Sherlock felt as though he were made of ice as he waited for Mycroft to bid his Commander farewell, moving automatically to follow his brother’s black uniform as he led him from the room.
“Nothing, I thought I saw someone I knew. I was mistaken.” Sherlock shook his head slightly trying to clear his racing thoughts.
“All right. Good night John, Sherlock.” She lifted a hand to squeeze Sherlock’s upper arm on her way to the stairs.
They stood that way for a few moments or perhaps for an eternity, silently breathing each other’s air before a noise at the door jolted them back to the present. John suddenly remembered they were clinging to each other in a conference room in New Scotland Yard in front of a glass door and window. Sherlock leapt away as Greg Lestrade bustled into the room carrying a tray with take away cups and a paper bag.
They were in a touristy part of town, and a number of people ambled about on the street despite the chill in the air. They passed several souvenir shops, two pubs, and a place selling thick knit jumpers and shawls before anyone spoke.
“I know that while Sherlock is very adept with potions and matters of magic and logic, he is quite unused to dealing with matters of the heart.” Mycroft paused for effect. “I should hate to see someone taking advantage of his ill-informed situation. It would make me quite angry if that were to happen. I’m certain you know that I am well connected, John. There is nowhere in the magical world someone could go that I would not know about.”
“Yeah, that was nice,” John said. “Still . . .” John leapt out of the bed in his pants and vest and squatted down to dig through his bag, unpacking things across the floor. Sherlock had sent the travelling toy train away the night before after John had tripped over it, stubbing his toe on the way to the loo.
The loud roar of the rain dropped, instantly muted as he closed the door. The interior was dim, and Sherlock unclipped his torch, snapping in on to survey his surroundings. It must have been a nice enough family home once, but years of neglect had left the wallpaper sagging, and paint peeling. This back room was empty, probably once a kitchen though the appliances had been gutted. The front sitting room was likewise deserted, the boarded up windows leaving it in dark gloom.
Sherlock couldn’t help the groan that shuddered out of him. The feeling was delicious. He couldn’t remember the last time someone had done something that felt this nice for him.
, James he’d been called. God, he’d been ex-military too, hadn’t he? Sherlock felt like throwing up. “But I thought you only did the solo videos.”
If this ficlet was too sad for you, and I know, it was a bummer, you can just head on over to another story of mine as the next chapter in Sherlock's life . . .
“This is so weird,” John said looking back at the cliff, “being out like this. I keep expecting some big rover balls to come bouncing out to take us back.”
“Sherlock, are you off to bed?” John stood beside him, stretching, running a hand back to rumple his hair.
“Oh, okay. I could come with you.” John rubbed at the grit in his eyes, trying to wake up. There was something so restful about Sherlock’s bedroom. It was like a river of slumber that pulled John under.
“Oh good, whatever will we do with the time?” John unhooked the slightly too-tight waist of Sherlock’s trousers, shimmied them off, and leaned back across the bed in his jumper and pants.
“Here now, what’s this?”  The tired woman ladling out porridge snapped to alertness when her eyes landed on Sherlock. “What’s one of
“Oh, yeah, it was great.” John hoped fervently that Sherlock’s parents hadn’t been watching when they’d been grinding at each other on the dance floor.
John sighed. Reluctantly, he helped Sherlock empty the back of the cupboard, spreading the toys across the carpet of the bedroom floor for further inspection.
“Only for Mycroft to step in and eliminate the possibility of John receiving an award based on his own merit,” Sherlock countered, voice gone icy.
Once the caravan of workers had passed, Sherlock turned to continue his diagnostic scan of the device affixed to the top of the corridor. When he realized it had been simply calibrated incorrectly, he typed in  a quick line of code that soon had the relay lighting up, and beeping happily.  Sherlock sighed. He’d be glad to finish this project and get back above ground as soon as possible. The cold had a way of slipping under even his heaviest padded jacket and making his joints protest.
“That it is, that it is. No one ever said Year Seven was easy. Still, if you had a problem with something, you could come talk to me.”
He sets to work slurping his Captain Watson sundae. John twists and squirms as Sherlock’s mouth and tongue work around the root of his cock, yet avoid the treasure. Around and around, nipping and licking and smearing his lips over John’s navel, in his sandy pubic hair, down where the sticky chocolate stream has dripped between his thighs, leaving pink clean skin in his wake. He pays special attention to opening John's arse with his tongue.
“John?” He turned toward his . . . friend? Lover? Partner? They hadn’t really come up with any terms. It hadn’t been necessary here with just the two of them. They knew what they were to each other.
“Oh, Sherlock,” John muttered, both arms moving to wrap tightly around him, holding him close. “I’ve got you, I’ve got you.”
He let himself sink back into the soft mattress, listening with half an ear as Sherlock moved down the stairs and out the front door.  Sadly, though the bed was comfortable, much of its appeal was lost with Sherlock’s absence. John punched at his pillow, and rolled over a few times before giving up on going back to sleep. After a nice hot shower, he pulled on Sherlock’s blue dressing gown hanging up on the back door of the loo. His were still packed somewhere, and it was much more fun to wear Sherlock’s anyway. John had to roll back the sleeves to fit comfortably, but it made him feel enveloped, taken care of in some way.
“Then you don’t have to eat anymore of it, berk.” John laughed at the face Sherlock pulled. “I’ll bring you a bowl so you can spit out whatever you don’t like,” he added.
“Come on, John.” Sherlock pushed his way through the milling people toward the nearest building, the community center, John hot on his heels.
“That’s certainly an option, sir.” The man looked hurt. “Don’t worry. I can go if I’m not wanted.” He was already pushing the thick duvet back to clamber to his feet. “The cost of a bedwarmer will be deducted from your final bill.” He pushed his feet into some plush looking slippers, and reached for his book and glasses, his entire body a sad curve.
John gave up on the article, and found his earbuds, settling down to listen to music and relax. He realized he was feeling a nagging pressure again, and cursed himself for not asking anyone to help him down the hall before they left. He was just considering ringing up Mike when Sherlock slipped into the room.
After relieving himself, Sherlock emerged to see John having a quick wash at a long trough made of scrap metal welded together. John had taken off his shirt to splash from a spigot jutting out from the wall. Sherlock paused to watch the play of muscle over John's broad back as he lathered suds between his hands, running it across his body before leaning over the sink to splash off. He grinned when Sherlock came to stand beside him, passing him the sliver of homemade soap.
As if on cue, Mr. Holmes arrived, and they had to repeat the process with Mrs. Holmes in between them, and then again with Mr. Holmes. John was beginning to grow weary of picture taking himself when Sherlock accidentally spilled his wine over his jacket.
It was odd still keeping his whole life a secret from his mum’s new husband, Stephen, and his family. It made his mum happy though so John kept filtering whatever he said to them. He’d even rented a post office box in the Muggle side of Valdevaqueros so his Mum and Harry could write him without needing owls.
“I know he’s Cardassian.” John turned on her fiercely. “But it’s true. He is my lakayha, and I trust him with my life.”
“Don’t mind if I do, stud muffin.” Sherlock rose to accompany him as they returned to the dance floor.
“Merlin’s beard, Sherlock won the potions internship in Germany! You jammy beggar.” Tom slapped him on the back.
The few times, they had felt their way through the dark labyrinth to fetch things left behind had felt like a chore. Now though, the thought of exploring with a light appealed to John. It was a chance to see something new.
“Come on, there’s a seat.”  Sherlock led him to a fallen log that had been carved flat and polished on one side to form a bench.
“Good, don’t let the door hit your fat arse on the way out.” Sherlock reached out to snatch Mycroft’s card from the table, crumpling it up to throw to the floor.
“Of course.” Sherlock smiled, enjoying playing the game. It didn’t mean anything.  He propped himself up on one elbow, to reach up and catch her hand, bringing it to his lips to press a kiss to her fingertips. “Anything for you, sweetheart.”
Sherlock leapt up when the shadow of the ruler overlapped the line in the ground, fiddling with the crossbeam to align things, scribbling his findings with a notebook and pencil he’d managed to locate.
Sherlock cried out in frustration his eyes were wild and his hips were bucking up to try to find friction against a body that was no longer there.
When some semblance of calm had returned at last, John stood, unfastening the damp kilt, and dropped it on the floor as he stumbled for the loo. He returned with a wet flannel, and helped his near boneless guest mop up.
“Angry? ANGRY doesn’t BEGIN to cover it,” John said so loudly several nearby tables glanced their way in surprise. John reigned in his volume with a concerted effort. “Sherlock, I fucking died the day you walked out on me,” he hissed.  “I went out with all those people, slept around like an idiot because I missed you so fucking much I felt like I couldn’t breathe. It wasn’t fair to them, to any of them.  I tried to tell them I wasn’t interested in anything long term. How could I be? My heart was smashed into bits. I’m lucky that Bianca and I managed to stay friends as I seemed to fuck up everyone else I came in contact with.”
John looked at his nearly empty glass, and worried that they were all growing mawkish from the wine.
As Sherlock rounded the back of the truck, Lupaza was already there, reaching into the storage hold, pulling out high-powered phaser rifles to pass around.
Mycroft opened a jar of honey, spooning a generous helping into his mug before settling down across from John with it. They sipped tea together in companionable silence for several minutes, content to listen to the sound of a clock chiming somewhere in the house.
“Thank you. It’s my grandmother’s recipe.  You won’t get paella this good in London,” she boasted proudly.
He’d had no idea that Holmes Apiary was based in such a grand place when he accepted the invitation. He'd imagined some quaint old four-room cottage with the bees out back if anything. Sadly when the door opened, and the gorgeous elfin creature he’d thought about for the last three days appeared, John blurted out the first inane thought that popped into his head.
“That’s right, good pickin’s here.” Sherlock slipped his hands into the pockets of his coveralls. Turning and spitting might complete the local yokel image he wanted to project, but Sherlock had his standards.
. John knew how to bed women, take it slow, use a bit of finesse, but with men . . . well it had always been a quick one in a locker room, or a dark corner, hadn’t it? Something a bit shameful to get over with as fast as possible. This man didn’t deserve that. He didn’t deserve
Then there’d been a few men in Afghanistan. It had been release, pure and simple, just blokes blowing off some tension, nothing serious, until one man had become quite serious to him. John still dreamed occasionally about James and his large, beautiful hands. They’d kept things quiet, so very quiet, and then John had been shot, and James wounded, and nothing had ever been the same again.
“Right, I have to . . .” John stood stiffly. He moved to the entryway, stuffed his feet into some shoes there, and palmed the door open. “I need some air.” He disappeared into the bright midday light.
‘Well, they can have the jewel, but they can’t have you. You’re mine now.’ The dragon flew to the entrance where the great stone blocked the entryway. With a few muttered words, the boulder creaked and rolled to the side. The band of dwarves camped outside were greatly surprised when an enormous dragon poked out to chuck their beloved gemstone at their feet.
John stood and pulled him into a hug. He smoothed a hand down Sherlock’s back as Sherlock relaxed a bit against him, his arms coming to encircle John's waist.
John had brought his camera, and busied himself snapping photos of the market, and of Sherlock, even asking a shopkeeper to take a picture of the two of them together, their arms slung around each other’s shoulders like proper mates. He’d taken some pictures back in his room earlier too, and Sherlock tamped down the idea that some of them were fairly incriminating. Hell, all of those were incriminating, Sherlock looking utterly shagged-out, his curls dripping from the shower, stretched out over John’s rumpled sheets in nothing but a towel.
“Oh, perhaps I mean it on a metaphysical level. So much easier being a bird, don’t you think?” Sherlock squinted into the sun that was lowering toward the horizon.
“Well, that looks fantastic to me.” John gestured toward the long, leggy vision that was Sherlock in formal wear.
Thankfully, the concoction in Teddy’s cauldron looked a good deal better, sporting a lovely shade of orange. When John dropped in the quickly-shredded peppermint leaves, it lightened even further to an almost lemon yellow.
John pulled open the wrapping paper to uncover a pair of thin gloves. “Huh.”  He looked at them, lifting one out of the box. “Gloves, erm, that’s nice.”
“Thanks so much for your help!” Sherlock pasted on a large, faux smile as he waved at the salesman a few steps away.
“This spoo . . . Cardassian tripped me. Knocked me to the floor.” The lean man drew himself up indignantly. “I demand recompense. I want a match.”
John gazed after the tall, lanky form fiddling with his contraption for awhile, a fondness sweeping over him before turning to watch the clouds. One of them looked exactly like Canada. A crash and a shout had him turning quickly back to Sherlock. The cross was on the ground, and the man was kicking it while cursing it loudly.
Although he wasn’t sure it would do any good, Sherlock had to try. Later, after the others had gone to sleep, he crept back to the console, and punched in a code, calling a private line.
“I love it when you scrunch your nose like that.” John said in answer, tipping his head to drop his voice lower. “Do you know I’ve always wanted to kiss it? Every damn time.”
The cumtoy was there, huddled in a pink dressing gown over a paper cup of tea, a red mark already starting to swell below her eye.
Sherlock ignored them all to kneel before the nearest plasma canon. Quickly, he flipped open the diagnostic panel and activated the screen. He casually pulled a data cube from his pocket and slipped it into the access slot. The encoded virus began invading the system instantly. If all went to plan, when the weapon was turned on, it would begin to power up only to short out and die. Sherlock made a pretense of checking the power supply and circuit channels before closing things back up. He rose to his feet, dusted his knees, and moved leisurely to his next target, passing a clump of soldiers in a noisy game of dice.
John tried to let go, let the music flow over him, and allowed Sherlock to lead him in a simple pattern.  He grinned when he realized he’d gotten the hang of it. They were actually dancing together.  It was pretty damn awesome being allowed to hold Sherlock so close when they weren’t pretending to be asleep. John could feel the heat of Sherlock straight through his clothes, though he wished there were fewer layers between them.
“Yeah, but it’s not right. I know orphans are important, but surely she could have shown up long enough to see her own son graduate. You’re valedictorian! You’re giving a speech for Godsake!”
Sherlock blushed even harder. He mumbled something unintelligible before grabbing a roll to stuff into his mouth.
“Such impeccable timing, darling. The boys just arrived. Come and meet Sherlock’s friend, John.” Sherlock’s mother beckoned the new arrival over with an elegant twist of her wrist.
Not all the Bajorans looked pleased to see him, many shot him sour looks when John’s head was turned, but nothing was said as John tugged him to one of the bonfires set in braziers around the room. Together they found nearby scrolls of paper and pens to write what they wished to release for the coming year.
John yawned and leaned against Sherlock, enjoying the warmth of him along his side. The next thing he knew, he was rising back to consciousness, eyes gritty and mouth dry.
“NO, thank you,” Sherlock barked out. “We need to get back to our patrol route. May the Prophets bless you.” Sherlock backed quickly away, pulling Larex with him.
The meal continued, but all eyes seemed to be drifting now to the man seated by himself several tables away, picking at a roll as he scrolled through his phone.
“No, NO!” Sherlock rushed forward, arms out. “Don’t shoot. They’re only children! It’s only pebbles!”
The door opened into a long unlit hallway, rooms off each side of the corridor, mostly dark with everyone out for the evening’s celebrations. They prowled silently along, breath harsh, adrenalin making their pulse beat in their ears, listening. Sherlock stopped, putting an arm out to halt John when they heard voices  from one of the rooms up ahead. Gleeful, young voices.
“Fine.” Sherlock huffed.  With a final nod, Mycroft turned in a whirl of pin-striped robe and was off.
“No. No, no, no. It's perfect. As long as you don't mind.” John replied shifting awkwardly from foot to foot.
The sun was dipping toward the horizon as they made their way back to the shore.  Sherlock opened the orange cylinder, and they unloaded the things they’d need from inside. They had a moment of hilarity trying to set the tent up, but then they had it, staking the ends securely to keep it standing upright. This side of the island was definitely less windy, their beach set back in a small cove, but still, a light breeze played over them.
They rolled out of bed by necessity. There were still last-minute things to pack, and quick showers to take.  John was just shoving the last of his socks into his trunk when Sherlock put a hand to his forearm.
Sherlock was still smiling, loose and relaxed when he left the bedroom, stepping into the shock of two shrieking Bajoran girls.  John was hot on his heels, tugging on his trousers to see what the commotion was.
‘I am a monster,’ the dragon sighed. ‘I must live outside the settlements of civilized creatures banished to the shadows where I belong.’
“Oh, I’m just so clumsy today. Pardon!” Alastaire pulled an exaggerated moue as he stepped squarely on John’s beans, grinding them into the floor as he reached for what he needed.
“Oh please.” John huffed, walking over to flop back across the newly-made bed. “He can’t be that good. I can’t even remember it. Besides, there’s someone else I’d MUCH rather be kissing.” John propped himself up on an elbow, to beckon Sherlock with a crooked finger. “Come here, you. It’s been much too long since I last kissed you.”
Bianca glowed at his praise. “I will come visit, and make it for you. It will be good to have someone to stay with when I want to see London again.”
Sherlock wrote rather brief notes to John’s rambling letters, but John treasured every scrap that Sherlock managed to send.  He could almost hear him speaking the words penned in his familiar slanting handwriting.
The last video seemed to be two Spanish-speaking men in a living room The camera caught them from the waist down as they stood facing each other to line their pricks up. When one managed to push his head under the loosened foreskin of the other, he opted for a rotating motion over a thrust, sliding the head of his cock in a circle around his partner’s glans. They stayed together longer than the other two, and from the hissed comments, seemed to be enjoying themselves greatly.
“Not to worry, John.”  Mycroft flashed him a tight smile that was most likely meant to comforting. “I’m sure you’ll do much better.”
“Thanks, really. And thanks for the room too. It looks great.” John gestured to the tidied space around them.
annual birthday gathering. Since his Grand-mère was the only one of his relatives he truly liked, he was looking forward to introducing John to her. After that, he hoped to spirit John off to the holiday villa in Greece, a place that remained near and dear to his heart, but John had made noises about wanted to see the Holmes family estate in Sussex as well. It seemed like a small forever with summer rolling out before them, but Sherlock knew September loomed in the queue just the same.
Another heavy door finally brought them to their destination. It swung open to admit them to a large underground room awash with noise, and the nearly overpowering stink of cigars, sweat, and spilled alcohol. All manner of rough persons filled the rows of benches and small tables that lined the place. Voices bounced off the walls as scantily clad Cardassian women circulated selling drinks to the crowd. It was the action in the brightly-lit center ring though that grabbed both boys’ eyes and kept them there. Two Bajoran men stripped to the waist, shiny with oil that had been worked over their bulging muscles, faced each other with fists raised. They moved quickly, dodging and blocking until one of them misjudged. The sound of meat on meat made a dull thud as a blow connected.
John led the way as they slipped out of the pink tent. “Sherlock.” John halted in his tracks before they’d gone more than a few paces. “I could . . .” He waved a hand between them.
“I’ve got you.” Sherlock took John’s hand in his own, and pulled him onward, leading him back to his flat, up the seventeen steps to his wide, soft bed that was easily big enough for two.
“Darling, I can’t tell you how long it’s been since I had a good soak at a spa.” The woman beside Sherlock tipped her glass back to drain it. “Where has that waiter gotten off to? I’m feeling half parched this evening.”
“I’m sorry about that. I was worried I might chase you off with it.” Sherlock crossed back to join him. “This house was always my refuge, though. I could never think of it as anything but home.”
.” Mrs. Watson stopped in her tracks running a hand over her forehead, flustered.  “Boys, this is not acceptable . . .”
Dismissed from greeter duties, Sherlock drifted back in to the welcome cool of the house, trying not to brood, and doing it anyway.
“Oh, I’ve embarrassed you now. I’m sorry. It is a failing of the old. We can speak our minds with little thought.”
“The Prophets will decide,” Kai Opaka said, leading him toward a small table that held an ornate metal box.
“I’ve a better idea. Why don’t you come visit my apiary? I’ll give you a tour. If you’re still interested in how I make my deductions, I’ll tell you then.” Sherlock winked.
John spent his last night in Spain on Bianca’s sofa.  He came bearing boxed tea, tinned soup and jars of jam he hadn’t manged to use.  Bianca parked John on a stool with a glass of wine in hand while she cooked dinner. He’d offered to help, but she shooed him aside in favour of doing it her own way. Things clattered about the kitchen with each flick of her wand as good-smelling things bubbled on the hob.
“Good, let’s get something together. I’m starving.”  John pulled away, moving back to the kitchen, as Sherlock rose to follow.
It didn’t help matters that John kept catching glimpses of a tall dark-haired boy with sharp cheekbones out of the corner of his eye all over school. He’d turn, half expecting to see Sherlock, only to find it was his cousin, Alastaire. His hair was more auburn than Sherlock’s, but John was annoyed that he’d never noticed how much they favoured each other before. It was maddening. Having an afternoon Potions class with the Slytherin guaranteed that John had to see him on a regular basis.
Sherlock took his hand in his own, the man’s tomfoolery melting his edges despite his best efforts to remain unwelcoming. “William Sigerson.”
“Sherlock . . . don’t  . . . the farm. . .” It was John’s voice, but the call kept breaking up.  “I repeat, it isn’t  safe . . . don’t . . .”
“Oh, God, Victoire . . .” John felt a new wash of horror at bedding his friend’s ex. What was the etiquette for this?
The driver shrugged and mumbled something almost unintelligible, but the mother smiled kindly at him as she pulled her son onto her hip. “Oh sure luv, it goes right by the shops, just get off at Winchester.”
John smiled gratefully as he watched his mother swing an arm around to hug Sherlock as she herded them toward the kitchen.
“Mr. Watson, I hate to bother you . . .” a grey-haired woman bustled in to tap John’s shoulder. “You had said you’d have time to talk with us about the dining room schedule today. We have too many stragglers , and those working in the field . . .”
“I can’t believe you spent an entire year in California.” Sherlock flipped a hand Victor’s way. “For god’s sake they drink their tea cold. With
The gloomy weather of the next month matched his hollow mood, raining almost continuously day and night. Sherlock showed up on time to teach his classes, ate when John sat with him and urged him to finish his plate, and started Naavi on some basic security on the console in the farmhouse. The younger man had been thrilled at the offer of more challenging work duties, and his enthusiasm had been a spot of bright in some otherwise very dull days.
That night, Sherlock’s hotel pals dragged him along to a party in the lounge of a guest house for Westerners called aptly, “the Fun House.” Loud music advertised the nature of the place before they’d even stepped inside. Giving the bubbling hookah pipes a wide berth, Sherlock accepted the glass of something alcoholic pushed into his hand. He raised the drink to his mouth, and turned to spy John Watson across the crowded room. The breath caught in his throat.
John burst into a charming arpeggio of giggles. “Ach, you’re not just a looker, you’re FUNNY too.” He waggled a finger at Sherlock.
“HOLD,” Sherlock barked. “No one is to harm these prisoners.” He glared hotly around at all assembled lest they dare question his august authority.
Mycroft set his mug down, raising his hands in a steepled position over the table. He fixed John with such a familiar, piercing look that John almost chuckled.
Grey. It felt as if the whole world had gone grey, washed out, like a photo left too long in the sun. John felt as if he had been left out too long himself, dry and cracked with all the juice run out of him. He sighed and moved past a knot of people to glance over the rhubarb and onions heaped at a stall. Nothing particularly inspired him, and he made his way to the next booth, leaning heavily on his cane.
Gaaawd. John sucked in a lungful as hints of coconut and expensive flowers wafted up from the mess of raven curls. Under that lay the cozy, human smell of the man himself. It would be so damn easy for John to pull him closer, roll Sherlock on top of him, and slot their bodies together to rock . . .
The others all had their own tales of being crushed under terrible suffering, and yet here they were, carrying on, and ready to learn something many struggled with in their uni years. It was humbling. He’d been trying to get them to simply call him
“Well, isn’t this . . .” Sherlock stopped, looking overwhelmed at the sheer amount of food John had piled over the table.
Despite Sherlock’s reassurances, and even the fancy new jumper, John still felt something like a small, squat garden gnome next to the tall, elegant poshness beside him. They joined the group queuing out to the platform.
“Yes, yes, love.” He could hear John crooning as his consciousness spun out like a thin thread drowning in the warmth of touch, and good, and yes.
“God, that’s amazing.” John’s twilight eyes were shining beacons, pulling Sherlock far, far out to sea.
John threw his frustration with waiting into his classes, even getting ahead in his homework simply to fill up his time. Quidditch practice helped as a diversion of course, and his prefect duties took up some of his evenings. He put the fear of God into a few Ravenclaw first years roaming the halls after hours on one of his patrol nights, yelling at them all the way back to their damn door with its wretched eagle knocker across the front.
“No. Sherlock, he only eats out though, you know?” Kurt lifted a shoulder. “Would you like some eggs?” he asked politely.
“I’m so glad to have someone I actually know here!”  Molly said. “It’s meant to be relaxing, but these things can be so tedious. You’ve no idea.”
Sherlock’s orgasm roared over him like a tidal wave, bringing John along with him as he shook with the force of it. Sherlock kept himself braced on his forearms until he couldn’t any longer. He collapsed over John struggling to get his breath back as John panted under him.
“Hey, who are you calling ‘riff raff?’” Tom growled, but John just shook his head, and placed a restraining hand to Tom’s chest.
John winced when he heard another round of heated words shouted from the direction of the foyer, followed by a distinct door slamming. Sherlock had two spots of color high on his cheeks when he returned.
“Oh, luv. Sometimes there isn’t one reason, or anything you can do. Long distance relationships are hard. You’re going to bounce back though, you know? You won’t always feel like this.”
John grunted in response. Sherlock kept a grounding hand to John’s thigh as he carefully pulled the toy out and slid it back in. He leaned in and licked a stripe over one of John’s nipples.
Eerily enough, his eyes flickered to the side that John was standing on. “You will find a meaningful sum has been deposited into your account with the Bank of England. You are free to go wherever you wish once you have been transported off the island facility.  Please make yourselves ready to depart. Transport should arrive within twenty-four hours. Good day, gentlemen.” With that, the phone shut off.
She had been a good friend, indeed.  He’d cried on her shoulder a number of times when his latest love affair had fallen apart. She'd told him his heart was too soft to be such a rake.
“John was just telling me he passed his exam too.  It gives me hope for my turn next year if you two berks can pass.” Victoire chuckled before raising her glass to take drink.  Both John and Rhys gave a half-hearted laugh, as Sherlock looked pointedly around their group.
The waiter returned to deposit something purple and frothy topped with a variety of fruit before him. “There you go sir, twelve leks.” Sherlock handed him his credit chip and watched as the man scanned it on a handheld device. “So, is there something you’re looking for in particular tonight, sir? I could suggest a few things on the menu.” He winked and Sherlock realized the man wasn’t talking about food.
They kissed madly again until John’s stomach rumbled. “Oh, ugh. I’m starving,” John said. “I skipped lunch to fly a spin around the Quidditch pitch. Time on a broom helps me think.”
They were soon hopelessly lost in the twist of streets, with nary a taxi when they really needed one. They kept moving, winding their way through the streets and alleys, working themselves farther away from the trouble. Finally, they had to stop to catch their breath. Panting by some steps to a building closed for the night.
“Well, Sherlock, fancy meeting you here.” An oily voice slid its way down Sherlock’s spine making his horror complete.
“Sherlock, I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I have to ask. Why me? Why did you ask me over to your house?”
“Hey new boy, move your arse . . .” a Bajoran man in smeared face paint trailed off as he caught sight of Sherlock. “Oh, excuse me, sir.” He backed up, fear flickering through his eyes.
“No, thank you. Really I have a head ache. Think I’ll just head to bed.” Sherlock managed a small cough, trying his best to look infirmed.
John punched in Harry’s number as fast as he could. He listened to it ring and ring before Harry finally picked up.
John huffed out a sob as Sherlock pressed tender kisses along his hairline. Eventually, John tipped his face back, seeking out Sherlock’s mouth. Their lips found each other, softly at first, sliding, teasing, building until their caresses reached an inferno, and they were clinging tightly, drinking each other down like starving men.
“Since we’re going to be at this for a while, I thought it would be more comfortable if we’re both lying down.”
By the time the show ended with someone being voted off the competition, Sherlock was yelling insults at the recording. “Why did they get rid of the Yorkshire man? The woman from Bath was clearly the inferior baker. The judges are idiots.”
“Just so,” Mycroft agreed mildly. “It no longer makes any sense for Cardassia to be here. The Federation is not an enemy we can afford to make. This is a war we must lose, Sherlock.”
“Fine, I’ll have it wrapped, please.” Sherlock said, idly glancing over the rest of the display. He stopped when a collection of shimmering stones caught his eye.  They were stylized, roughly heart-shaped things, each flashing an intriguing set of colours. “What are those?” He asked tapping his finger on the glass above them.
Sherlock glanced away, finding Kira as she moved through the crowd. “I can see why she dislikes me so much. I stole you away from her.” Sherlock watched as she convinced another man, one with strapping arms and a patch over one eye, to join her. They laughed as they moved toward the forming circle.
When John woke up half an hour later, he startled, going directly from asleep to sitting upright when he saw Sherlock wrapped in a dressing gown watching him from the armchair across the room.
The teens were taken into custody, and thankfully the cloaking field restored to full capacity. The Harvest celebration continued in a much more subdued way, but Sherlock and John returned to the house for an emergency meeting of the Council of  Elders. Despite the fact that they reached consensus quickly enough that the teens would all be transferred to the River Bank Cell, it was late when things broke up.
It was a bit easier watching John and Mrs. Watson leave the next morning. “Look, we’ll see if we can’t come home a little early, okay?” John said, giving Sherlock a proper snog in the kitchen while his mum was upstairs. Sherlock giggled when John climbed onto his lap, and knocked the jam jar over with this elbow. John left his library card with Sherlock along with a hastily drawn map to reach the library before racing after his mum out the door.  Sherlock waved from the front window watching as their car backed out of the driveway.
The crowd around the playing field roared as a Hufflepuff managed to get a quaffle past Owen into the Gryffindor goal. Damn.  Thankfully the tide changed soon after as Seth and Fatima scored two goals one after the other against the Hufflepuffs. Victoire stopped a bludger from clipping Teddy’s broom, and John laughed out loud as he hit another away from a knot of Gryffindors. They were on fire today, unstoppable! It seemed only a matter of minutes before Teddy scooped the golden snitch out of the achingly-blue sky, and it was all over. Gryffindor had won the Quidditch cup for the year.
“It’s not necessary. We just dined.” Sherlock’s rich voice rolled out to fill the beige-walled space.
“You go first.” Sherlock said shyly shoving a long wrapped box into John’s hands. He didn’t know if John would like it, and the suspense was killing him.
“We look forward to working with you.” Kira moved in to shake his hand as well, her eyes boring in to him as her smaller hand gripped his own. “Bajor needs friends.”
But although John really did want to play, he was still caught up in thoughts of his previous disastrous attempt at 69. It was etched in his mind as one of his rare sexual failures — a painful and humiliating experience. Tentatively, he kissed Sherlock’s thigh.
Since he had no wish to give his parents any more reasons for shipping him offworld though, Sherlock was happy to continue playing the feckless schoolboy. This latest version, Mr. Jadzel, was easy enough to fool. He hardly noticed anything beyond his own fashion sense, and the pretty violin teacher who came three times a week.
, but the man was beautiful. He wasn’t the usual sort to turn John’s head. He’d been tap dancing around his commanding officer for months now, a handsomely rugged man who John greatly admired.
“Still, the apparating. Not everyone passes on their first try, you know.” She smiled as she patted his shoulder. “I’m giving fifteen points to Gryffindor for you getting your certificate. Good job that, very good. ” She winked as she moved on.
“What the . . .” John reached in to find the small object lying inside. He couldn’t help the smile that spread over his face as he pulled it out.
Eventually, they began rocking, moving as Sherlock slid in and out, the pressure rising, building. Sherlock changed his angle slightly, and John cried out, a surprised string of curses.
John watched as Sherlock approached the uniformed Wizard collecting tickets, lingering nearby. Sherlock’s case worked its way ahead of him to follow like an obedient puppy at Sherlock’s heels. For a mad moment, John wished he could climb inside of it, pack himself away to go too.
Sherlock could only see the top stud of the earring on John’s ear. “What happened?” Sherlock asked quietly, sitting beside him.
“You don’t get to do this, Victor. Say something else about John, and you can start walking to the train station.”
John’s eyes fluttered open. No more blindfold. John’s throat hurt, and his nose was clogged. He ran a hand over his face. It came away wet. Shit, he’d been crying.
“Where is your home?” Sherlock asked the younger woman in Bajoran. It shocked her so much, she answered him immediately.
“Easy, friend, way I see it, a few extra minutes break wouldn’t matter that much,” the man leered, letting his hand move around to squeeze Lupaza’s rump. She squeaked and jumped, something like murder brewing in her eyes. The other Cardassians laughed.
John staggered back to his dorm, an arm flung around Mike as they wobbled up the stairs. Someone had started a drinking game at the pub, and never one to shy away from a challenge, John had knocked back a few more beers than he’d intended. Mike was a bit pissed as well, and the both of them giggled uproariously as it took them three tries to get the door to the corridor open.
“Oh, we broke up. It was just too far to keep things going properly.” The woman shrugged carelessly as she worked a tissue from her handbag to dab at her nose. “Oh, but I didn’t mean . . .” Her head snapped up as she realized what she had just said. “I didn’t mean YOU, dearie. Oh, not at all. Things will probably be just fine for you.” She patted his arm.
“Dropped her arse and got out of the water. Everyone laughed and we just played it off like a big joke. She apologized later.”
“You never filed a police report,” Sherlock offered, a frown pulling his brows together. “I found no evidence . . .”
“Hey I’m glad you came, you got to see a good game.” John had played well if he did say so himself. In retrospect it was probably good he hadn’t known Sherlock was on the sidelines. It would have distracted him too much.
Sherlock’s back arched up as John kept a steady march downward, laving and kissing his way down Sherlock’s body .
“Sorry, he’s taken for the entire night. And every other night,” Sherlock snarled into the interloper’s face.
“We won’t be able to do this both standing up due to our height disparity.” Sherlock wrinkled his nose as he thought. “I think this will work if I sit on the bed, and you stand in front of me though.”
“That’s right. I’m new. Very observant,” Sherlock clipped. This man was nobody, and he’d already dropped his “charming idiot” persona.
“Well, Wiiilliam.” John stretched the name out, a hint of a smile playing over his lips. “What brings you to our little corner of the world?”
John dropped his hands to Sherlock’s hips, pulling them close to his own as he led them into a rolling arc. Sherlock followed John’s lead, and soon enough felt he was catching on. He relaxed as they swayed together, moving apart for more arm swinging. Sherlock watched the dancers around them, copying moves that looked promising. He figured he was doing something right when John sent him an utterly scorching look in reward. Sherlock grinned and threw himself into the beat. They stayed out, dancing several more songs in a row. A trickle of sweat ran between his shoulder blades, and he pushed his fringe back from his forehead when John touched his arm and tipped his head toward their table. Sherlock nodded in agreement, and they made their way from the dancing mob to find Harry still deep in conversation with Clara. Sherlock’s bottle of cider had warmed, growing sweaty with condensation, but he gulped the rest of it down grateful for the moisture.
“Oh, ages,” Sherlock said gleefully. “There must be four dozen cold cases here, dating back as far as the 1800s.”
“God, Teddy, don’t start. I already got an earful from my bleeding sister, Harriet, okay? People make mistakes, you move on. I mean how would you feel if you and Vic broke up and then she wanted to try again. You’d do it. You know you would.”
“Come fill me up, till I’m bursting with your spunk, till my belly is full of it.” He pressed down on his stomach as if he were truly feeling it swell with an Alpha’s copious release.
“I’m sorry about Harry.” John blew a breath out as he shut the door behind them. “She’s a bit of a pill, but she means well.”
“Hmmmph? Oh yes. There were some riots in the outer edge of the province. Around Marzet. Had to send in some troops.” His father’s voice rumbled.
“Oh Emile, right. Well, that was easy enough to figure out. That Alpha at the office who took a week's holiday, Steven? It turns out he wasn’t taking a trip with his bond-mate like he told everyone. He told
The man grunted, still looking a bit skeptical, but moved to punch a code into a keypad by the door. He stepped aside to let Sherlock pass as the door opened.
“I don’t have a ring, I mean we don’t have to wear rings if we don’t want to. I just . . . I want to show the world. I want to call you my husband. Unless that’s not something you want . . .”
“This is food for the fighters of the Resistance!” The woman scowled, gesturing with her spoon. “We don’t need to be feeding the likes of him.”
John felt a bit as if he were swimming to pass through the lobby into the lift.  They tried to move quietly, smothering giggles until the door shut. They leaned against the back wall letting laughter ripple over them, finding everything and nothing hilariously funny. John could see them reflected together in the mirrored wall of the lift, smears of black and white, tall and short.
As Sherlock stuck out a hand to help him rise, John realized he’d been subconsciously waiting for Sherlock to return. The cider he’d drunk made its presence known, and John swayed as soon as he stood upright.
“Now, now, perhaps you’ll have time later. Come on, we need to get ready for the wedding,” Mr. Holmes tutted, holding a hand out.
They made their way easily down to the beach, picking their way across the the rocky shore to the softer sand.
“How do you know he came in today?” John said, surprised, though really he shouldn’t be. His lovely man was something of a mind reader at times.
Sherlock leapt up, tousling John’s hair affectionately as he went past. He returned to the table a moment later, holding a small light bulb.
“Ugh, I’m too tired for this nonsense.” Sherlock sighed running a hand over his face. “I just need to sleep.”
“The usual. Some rabble rouser got the workers in the factory district all stirred up. They damaged some property, killed some guards before we could subdue it.”
“Oh God, I still have to put up . . . the rest of Irene’s fliers.” John stopped to fish the stack out of his bag. “Go on, I’ll catch you later.”
“John, here.” Sherlock handed him a wad of folded bills. “And this is the information I told you about yesterday, the times, the maps.” He passed John a small envelope. He’d copied all of the information out carefully by hand from the data cube, crushing it in a garbage compactor after. You never knew what sort of tracers might be on it.
“Thank you.” Sherlock accepted the drink to sip what turned out to be cheap, but thankfully strong tea. He could feel it reviving his system as it slid down his throat. “It’s okay, really. I don’t have to eat here. I have food in my flat.”
“We could get a good price on rekja if we could find a way to sell it offworld.” Gant Izar, their new engineering head, leaned in to grab a small cake from the plate in the center.
“Yeah, we’re ok. We’re both a mess, but we can help each other to do better. Just never tell my brother that this insane puzzle island was a good idea.”
Later, when they opened the other presents, Sherlock got homemade fudge and a new scarf from John’s mum, and a complicated interlocking puzzle that John had found in a shop in Hogsmeade.  Sherlock gave John a set of potions that they made at the workshop, elixirs for concentration, sound sleep, and an all-purpose nerve tonic.
Sherlock made short work of leaving instructions with his contact if anything with the new system malfunctioned, and gathering up the few things he’d brought into his satchel. They would have said good-bye to Naavi, but he had already disappeared somewhere into the warren of chambers. Sherlock could hardly wait to take the lift the surface and step outside into the sunlight with John by his side.
Sherlock swallowed, feeling his insides turning into ice. It was no use, he could cry and rant, but the facts were the facts. He was leaving Bajor in a matter of days, and there was nothing he could do about it.
“Oh Sherlock, he’s your big brother. He just worries.”  Mrs. Hudson reached over to swat at his arm.
“Look, it’s been a long trip.” John bent to retrieve the large duffle he’d dropped, slinging it over one shoulder, and grabbed  the handle of his wheeled suitcase. “If you want to complain about getting a single, go ahead, but I’m going to get settled for now.”
John chuckled and set about scraping the last of the breakfast onto his plate. Sherlock watched the ex-soldier polishing off the food with some satisfaction. He had a feeling this was one of the best investments he had made in a very long while.
Sherlock led John through the front rooms back toward the kitchen. The parlors were the most opulent side of the house whereas the kitchen had a smaller, more homely scale to it. He should have directed John to come in by the back door he thought with a wince as John stopped briefly to admire a framed Turner on the wall.
They continued their patrol, their boot heels clipping on the pavement. Anderson of course immediately announced his intention to stop in for a pint when they passed a small pub.
“Why don’t you get behind the driver’s side? There’s more leg room for me behind my Mum,” Sherlock said.
John smiled wryly. “I know. I used to laugh at Sherlock with all his books. If only I’d known. Year Seven is hard! Honestly you can’t start soon enough getting ready for the NEWTs.”
The next time they roused, full dark had fallen around them, the flat lit only by a lamp left on in the sitting room. Together they stumbled to the kitchen, giggling, filling cups from the tap and drinking it down in great draughts.
“John.” Sherlock reached out as John gathered him in. He clutched at the back of his beloved’s jacket, burying his face in John’s hair.
“Boyfriend?” Sherlock shifted in John’s arms to rotate, sloshing water as he moved to face John. The bathtub gave a bit of a creak, and the grout along the tiles joining it to the wall cracked.
Sherlock shuffled uncomfortably next to John on the duvet. John butted his foot gently against Sherlock’s ankle before continuing.
“Come on, I’m sure there’s something edible in the fridge,” Sherlock said, rising to tie a fluttery dressing gown around himself.
The man raised the honey to his mouth, his brows drawing down slightly as he pulled the spoon back out, considering.
“Did you have a good lie-in, dear? Sherlock said you weren’t feeling well this morning.” Mrs. Holmes peered more closely at John.
“Oh my God. Look at that bath!” John could almost feel the hot water encasing him. He loved a good soak – something he didn’t get to indulge in with the showers in the dorms. He moved to poke at a line of bottles by the sink containing a number of body wash and oils. “We are so keeping this room.”
The Three Broomsticks was warm, and cheerfully crowded when John pushed inside, but he found his mates easily enough at a table near the back. They waved him over to the chair they’d saved for him.  The pub broke out into loud cheers as John took his seat, and he swiveled to see Puddlemere United had just scored a goal over the Ballycastle Bats on the large viewscreen over the bar. John smiled to himself. Change came slowly to the Wizarding world, but the chance to broadcast Quidditch games across the UK had inspired the Ministry of Magic to fund the magic to create a sort of telly system.
“I could do that,” Sherlock said, making no move to do anything other than scoop up a bite of rice pudding, pulling the spoon slowly from his lips.
John moved back, finding the packet on the bed. He peeled open the condom, rolling it down over the erection he had almost forgotten about as he focused on Sherlock’s pleasure. He quickly slicked his cock, and moved in to line himself up with Sherlock’s stretched opening, holding his weight on one arm as he eased inside. Watching Sherlock’s blissed-out face for any signs of pain, he sank into the gorgeous welcoming heat. John’s eyes slid closed as he bottomed out fitting himself flush against Sherlock's body. They sighed in unison. John didn’t want to ever move again, but Sherlock bucked his hips impatiently, and John took the hint, pulling himself half out, only to slide back in.
“Oh Sherlock, hang it, I don’t care about that. Come here.” John reached out and pulled Sherlock into a hug. Sherlock remained stiff for just a moment before relaxing, and winding his arms around John as well.
“Baaaaaa.” Teddy bleated. It was a source of endless amusement to the other boys that Owen’s father owned a sheep farm.
“John, I don’t do well with people. I’m a high-functioning sociopath, unpleasant, rude, uncaring. I can’t burden you with that.” Sherlock stared at John’s tanned hands surrounding his long, pale one.
“As ready as I’ll ever be, Cuddle Bear.” John set about packing the things he had out, and gathering his rubbish.
With both Irene and Molly as buffers, Sherlock found that he could keep his need for small talk down to a minimum. A few judicious hellos and handshakes seemed to grease the social wheels sufficiently before he could lapse into silence between the women.
“Yes, at a local harvest ball, but I went to Beauxbatons, and he to another school, and we only saw each other on holidays. We said we would wait for each other, but in my final year, I had the honor of competing at the Triwizarding tournament at Hogwarts.”
“Well, hello there.” The man sat up, looking a bit startled. His voice was as annoyingly lovely as his face.
On the seventh day, John sat at breakfast, pushing some eggs around his plate when the heartstone on his bracelet began to glow – he hadn’t taken it off since he’d gotten back from Germany. John’s pulse beat in his ears as he glanced around hoping against hope. The owl post swooped into the great hall, and a standard tawny owl flew over to drop a small package by John’s plate. With shaking fingers, John opened the box. Sherlock’s heartstone bracelet slid out into his lap. John searched inside the box, but there was no note with it, just the bracelet. John scooped it quickly into his pocket, feeling grateful that an owl managed to drop Teddy’s copy of the World Wizard News into his bowl of cereal, sparing him the need to make any explanations as everyone dealt with the mess.
Your kudos and comments are a like a patronus blowing away the Dementors! Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock murmured as the woman moved to speak to some jewel-bedecked women sitting farther down.
“It’s a box step. We go southwest two steps and west two steps and we are back where we started. He...he wanted us to dance. In the moonlight. That’s…a rather convoluted way to get us to do it, isn't it?”
“So did you meet in a club? I used to love to go dancing. I’d be out till dawn back in the day.” Mrs. Hudson smiled, sitting down with her own cup.
It was good. Somehow Victor had worked miracles with the leavings in the fridge before shopping day. They ate for several minutes with only the clink of silverware or slurp of coffee for noise in the room.
It quickly became clear that John did, indeed, have an advantage. Bart’s may not have taught the removal of Spare Ribs or the Wish Bone, but John was quite adept with the Surgical Tweezers. He was pleased to note that the intermittent tremor he’d started experiencing in his left hand after being shot had completely disappeared since he’d met Sherlock.
Sherlock glanced briefly up at the sound of their entrance, did an almost comic double take, and froze, his mouth caught in a perfect O. Mike bumped into John who had suddenly become a statue blocking the doorway.
“GOD, Sherlock, FUCK, Sher, Shhhh . . .” John sputtered helplessly as Sherlock plowed into him, driving him into the mattress.
, as fingers returned to his arse, pushing in, rocking, rocking. The pleasure washed over him but his shoulder was starting to shake holding his weight. John felt a whine building behind his teeth.
“It’s not the sort of thing I planned to build a career around, and I’ve more important things to be doing now.”
“You’re really scary when you do that, ya know?” John chuckled, settling on the bench next to Sherlock. “I could swear I had an elder here checking up on me. Gave me the chills.” John shook himself all over in demonstration.
“Wow, you never told me your other intern was  . . . ”  John waved a hand as they stepped outside, the toy soldiers standing politely aside to let them pass.
The letter in his pocket felt weightier than a folded slip of paper ought to. He still had a decision to make, and he needed to make it soon.  John couldn’t believe it had been two years since he’d first come to southern Spain, he and his mates jumping drunkenly about in the waves.  Where had the time flown? He didn’t regret it though, not a bit. His time spent on Costa de la Luz had been amazing. Lately though, things had started to grow a bit predictable at work. John glanced down wryly at the latest set of marks gracing his arms, lashes from a demon ray gone into a frenzy. Everyone at work knew, if they had  a dangerous animal to wrangle, Watson was the man to call.
“That doesn’t make it any less...nice.” John placed his hand on Sherlock’s back this time and they did another simple step back to their marked spot. John attempted to dip Sherlock and they both nearly fell over and laughed.
“Mikey.” Grand-mère descended to tug Mycroft lower so she could drop a kiss to each of his cheeks. “Oh, mon beau garçon, je suis très heureuse de te voir!” (Oh, my lovely boy, I am very happy to see you.)
John rummaged through his wardrobe and pulled out the faded tan-coloured sheets, and old wool blanket he hadn’t needed to use yet that term. He glanced over to see that Sherlock had moved the folded duvet and old sheets from his bed to unfold a set of pearly grey twin sheets.
When they returned to the table, loaded down with selections, Sherlock’s odd, older brother had materialized in one of the chairs, sipping at a cup of tea whilst reading something on his phone.
“No, I expect not,” John said. He couldn’t imagine playing weddings or parties and the like paid enough to live on. Surely this talented man taught music or played in a symphony somewhere.
“Sherlock . . . I . . .” John’s heart seemed to be lodged in his throat. He struggled to find words, but nothing would come.
“Nothing, it’s just . . .” Sherlock paused. “I’ve never shared this room with anyone before.  It’s strange.”
Sherlock was going to say no when an image of John stretched out, straining and flushed on a set of navy sheets flashed through his mind. He realized he was going to need a few minutes to pull himself together.
“Semi-sentient luggage.”  Sherlock quirked a smile. “It was a gift from Mummy. She had it sent to my place in Germany.”
A quick trip up the stairs proved it just as free of life as the ground level though the three bedrooms showed much more evidence of recent habitation. Heavy curtains blocked the windows while rugs, cushions and low tables littered the floors in two rooms. The third held rolls of bedding stacked against the wall. Small skylights let in a scant amount of illumination overhead as the rain poured down furiously over them. Sherlock supposed the hidden natural light was one of the reasons the Resistance had picked this place as a bolthole. During the day, it was probably quite cheerful. Sherlock poked around a bit more, found a toilet that seemed to be functioning, and a small storage room crammed to the ceiling with bags and boxes. Though his curiosity itched at him, he left them untouched.
out of his mind.  He wanted desperately to find him again, but it was just too dangerous. If he blew either of their covers, it would be disastrous. Sherlock worried over the bombs, and who he might warn, going round and round in his head about it all.
“Come to the farmers' market,” Harry had insisted. Since he’d arrived to stay with his sister and her wife a month ago, he’d hardly left the house except to take a cab to his twice-a-week physio appointments.  Clara had smiled and gone on about how lovely the market was, and John agreed to join them if only to please her.
“Oh, yeah, that’s true.” John shrugged. A shadow passed over his eyes at the mention of next year, and Sherlock silently kicked himself for bringing it up. John covered over his discomfort with another mouthful of breakfast, and Sherlock reached under the table to give his leg a quick squeeze.
“Come on.” Lupaza threw open the door, and leapt out, the rest of them scrambled after as best they could.
“John? What are you doing here?” Sherlock looked exhausted, his hair unruly as if he’d been tugging at his curls, but he was long and lithe and gorgeous all the same. John wanted to devour him in great heaping bites.
Again, Sherlock stalled in order to keep John’s lips around him for as long as possible before answering, “56.”
“Oh, I think you were wrong about who has the big cock in this bed,” Sherlock purred as he licked over John’s very healthy erection. He wasn’t that much longer than Sherlock, but he certainly was thicker in girth. Sherlock pressed his nose to John’s public hair, inhaling the lovely musk of him, the most concentrated place of John smell, before closing his lips over his length. He swallowed John down neatly until the tip of his cock nudged the back of his throat. Sherlock relaxed, letting his gag reflex settle, a talent that he had worked to perfect, and moved, sliding John in and out of his mouth at a luxuriously slow pace.
“It isn’t nothing. This could turn septic if it isn’t treated properly. Luckily, I have something . . .” Sherlock trailed off as he moved to search through one of his bags. He dug for a moment before pulling out the tube of medical cream he wanted. John sat up, wrapping his arms around his knees, presenting his back to him.
“Sherlock,” John whispered as his lips closed over Sherlock’s and they kissed again, deep and drugging.
“Hey, I’m John Watson. I got a letter - looks like we’ll be rooming together.” John put out a friendly hand.
Sherlock did as John ordered, running the pads of his fingertips over each sensitive nub, then swept back to catch them with the edge of his finger nails.
“He finally told me why he had to leave his job in California, practically in the middle of the night.”
He straightened and was startled by a flurry of long limbs, and curls smashed against his cheek. John whoosed out a breath in surprise as Sherlock embraced him tightly from behind.
“Why is Sherlock wearing a dress?” She blinked his way just having noticed this salient fact. “Oh and your head. Sweetie, what happened?” She reached up, lifting his hair to better inspect the damage.
“Not that I’m complaining, but what brought this on?” John could hear the smile in Sherlock’s voice.
John sighed and scrubbed a hand through his hair as he surveyed his plush surroundings. It was lovely, but the sudden vacuum of no-Sherlock seemed to suck all the air out of the room. John padded into the bathroom for a piss before wandering about the space, wondering what to do with himself. He felt so unsettled it was as if ants were crawling over his skin. John stopped before the window, throwing open the curtains to study the view outside. The day looked to be a gorgeous one, all warm, slanting autumn light. The beautiful swath of trees rolling out below were just starting to change colours, their leaves tinged in yellows and rust. All in a rush, John knew exactly what he wanted to do, go for a run.
Dinner was John’s least favourite, eel pie, blood pudding, and mushy peas. He pushed it around on his plate without eating much, keeping half an ear on the conversations bubbling around him.
Sherlock made a rude noise. “You’ve been living in Sussex all summer, and you haven’t been to the beach?”
“We’ve had marginal success, but nothing that lasts past a few minutes.” Sherlock opened a cabinet and rummaged inside before retrieving the bottle he wanted.  Sherlock uncorked the bottle and swallowed the contents down. “Let me show you.”
The Bajoran man and woman inside were nondescript, both whipcord thin, dressed in neutral coarse-spun wear, nothing fancy. Their eyes were sharp though, cataloging Sherlock’s every move.
“Thanks.” John felt his heart sink. He started to turn away when he recognized Irene coming through the door carrying a box of soaps. He almost called to her, but the idea of talking to someone about Sherlock right then made him feel physically ill. He quickly made his way outside before she could spot him.
Sherlock gave a low chuckle. Again, he began the slow push/pull of the beads, now stimulating John’s prostate with each stroke. The sensation was a maddening tease. John grew impatient, and shoved his hips back against the largest bead, bearing down and sucking it in. He groaned at the sudden fullness and firm pressure against his prostate.
They were nearly late for their reservation, but made it into the restaurant before their table was given away. John smiled as they settled into their semi-private booth. Hogsmeade was crowded with all the people in town for the apparating exams, and John felt grateful for Mycroft’s gift of their dinner. They didn’t talk about it, but Sherlock was generally the one who ended up paying for things when they went out. John had a bit of dosh to his name, working the summer stint at Uptown Realty had helped too, but he couldn’t afford to splash out like Sherlock could.  John knew Sherlock had a stack of gold back at his Gringotts bank account in London while John only had a stack of coins bundled into a sock at school.
The Little Hobbit who had found a treasure chest to hide behind quaked all the way to his furry toes hoping he wouldn’t be found out.
“John.” Harry put her knife down. She had her long suffering, big-sister-by-five-minutes voice on. “You can’t miss those appointments. It’s important.”
John shook his head, breathless. For a moment, he thought he might vomit, his abused system making its complaints known. He swallowed deeply.
“Drive, I think.  . . . Hey, little boy, want a lift?” John leaned out the window with a silly leer.
A new thought occurred to John as he lined things up to cut on his chopping board. Sherlock had said he was almost positive he could come Friday night, but if things went pear shaped at work, he might not be able to get away until Saturday. He’d promised he’d be there first thing in the morning if that happened, but God, John really hoped it would be tonight. He just wasn’t sure he could wait a whole other . .
Sherlock shyly asked John if he would consider moving in with him.  “The flat isn’t much, and I only have the one bedroom free, I use the one upstairs as a work space . . .” Sherlock trailed off looking embarrassed.
‘But there are no hobbits for miles and miles from here. Few people have even seen a hobbit, they never leave their shire. I felt certain no one would be able to read . . .’
The facility was reasonably warm throughout all the rooms, but John had to agree there was a bit of a chill,  psychological if not temperature-wise, in this clinical-looking dorm space.
“Beautiful . . . gorgeous . . . lovely man . . .” John murmured the words into his skin. “You’re mine, all mine, aren’t you?”
“We need to make do with what we have, alright?” John snapped. “I’m not sure how long our supplies are meant to last.”
“Hey, hey. It’s okay, love.” John stood beside Sherlock’s chair, wrapping an arm around his shoulder. “It’s OUR farm. You’re my lahkaya. What’s mine is yours.”
“Sherlock, you didn’t tell John that you applied to an internship in Europe?” Victoire asked, eyes narrowing.
Of course I had to do extensive research on songs commonly played at British weddings, and then popular songs in general on the UK charts. Like ya do. For some reason the beat and the lyrics of this appealed to me so Sherlock and John get to dance to this fun number at the reception . . .
At Sherlock’s vaguely hummed reply, John closed the wardrobe, urging Sherlock into the narrow hallway that led to a small kitchen and three more doors farther down.
They pulled Sherlock’s clean sheet onto his mattress, and went about their usual bedtime routine. This time though, John was waiting in bed naked when Sherlock got back from the bathroom.  They ended up soiling John’s sheets this time, and quickly swapped it out for one of Sherlock’s extras.
It was gloriously wicked, shagging outside in the dark where anyone could drive up and shine headlights on them, see them coming apart on top of each other. It was also horribly cramped, two full-grown men wedged into a front seat built for one. Everything felt too much and not enough as John’s knee dug into the side of the door. For a moment, John imagined he was eighteen again, and feeling up Sheila Matthews’ tits in the backseat of his father’s car, hot and awkward.
“I’ve got two uncles that work at the ministry, Victoire added, reaching for the toast. “They say he’s something alright. No one wants to get on his bad side.” She bit into a triangle with a snap.
John gave a sigh of relief as they left the labyrinth behind, stepping back into the cube room. It was good to be back home, he thought, and had to smile at himself as Sherlock punched in the code for the door to the front rooms. When had he started thinking of this mad place as home? One glance over at the riot of dark curls beside him, and he had his answer. This man was his home now, wherever that was.
The kitchen held its usual hubbub of noise, and good smells. The kitchen girls rolled out dough, sending clouds of flour around the room as they worked. Mrs. Watson looked up from the large pot she was stirring on the stove.
“Prophets, you beautiful, beautiful thing.” John crooned as he came back to himself, his eyes fluttering open to focus on Sherlock in the soft glow of the lamplight. He reached up to cup the side of Sherlock’s face, rubbing a thumb gently over the ridge along his cheek.
John had to strain up to reach him at first, but a hand slid around the back of Sherlock’s neck, soon urged him to bend lower. Sherlock stood nearly immobile for a moment as John pressed his mouth to his, willing him to relax. John licked over his lips then, and when the man gasped, he stormed in, his tongue sliding gratefully into Sherlock's mouth. He slipped a hand under Sherlock’s coat, gripping the back of his shirt for balance, feeling his arms come around him before utterly losing himself in the delectable act of kissing Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock made a detour by the bar, slipping out his wand to coax a bottle of wine and two glasses floating their way when the bartender turned his back. Sherlock caught the wine while John plucked the glasses from the air.
“He’s a conniving, ignorant pox on the face of humanity who couldn’t find his arse in a paper bag.” Sherlock spat, “He deserves to be taught a lesson.”
“Yes, John.” Sherlock searched John’s expression, committing that look to memory. Concern. It was nice to be the recipient of John’s attention, though he didn’t like the lines of worry marring his forehead.
“They aren’t dead,” Lupaza said, echoing his thoughts. “Just stunned. But we need to get out of here. There’ll be someone looking soon enough.”
“VIC! It’s so good to see you.  Wow, great game, last week. You lot really trounced Romania. I caught a recording, you did some amazing broomwork in that!”
“How . . .”  Sherlock barely managed to say before John’s mouth was on his own, and all thoughts scattered away save one . . .
John made it to the front of the shop first. He was browsing a rack of jewel-colored ties when Sherlock swirled in, back in his usual button up shirt, dark trousers, and long coat. He seemed incapable of walking into a room like a normal person. John couldn’t help smiling. Sherlock spared John a glance before moving to the counter and whipping out a credit card.
A group of Cardassians passed on the street nearby, their raised voices, and a burst of laughter reached them through the bushes reminding them of where they were.
“No, please, this will be nothing but tediousness. I’d rather think of you here naked in bed waiting for me to return.”
website, and searched for Johnny101. He scrolled through the thumbnail shots on his page until he found one of John in what looked like a sports club, stretched out on a bench in nothing but a tight pair of jogging shorts. Feeling like a heel, like the lowest of the low, Sherlock clicked the link open.
“I don’t understand what happened.” John said between bites. They stood over the sink shoveling in ham, cheese and pickle. “I’ve been on suppressants and birth control for years. I haven’t had a heat since the army.”
“God, I think this class is going to break my brain!" Mike moaned as they took their seats in the lecture hall.
Sherlock was rather proud of the simple curses he had wrapped around the beds of the other boys in his dorm room. Each night their sheets twisted themselves into knots around their legs, the bed shook slightly as soon as they dropped off, and the mattress was vaguely damp under them each morning when they woke. It was subtle torture designed to make them think their guilty consciences were having the best of them, and something they were unlikely to discuss with anyone. John asked him to remove it though, so Sherlock simply shrugged and agreed. He often deferred to John on matters of correct behavior as the Gryffindor was such an excellent judge of it. Besides, it
Sherlock opened his eyes to see the tall woman dressed in red. She had a briefcase sandwiched between her feet on the floor as she gripped a bar with one hand, and held the phone she was reading with the other. A bag of Omega ginger sweets, freshly bought, bulged out one pocket of her long coat. Ah, not only bonded, but expecting a pup with her Omega as well. A closer inspection revealed crayon streaks on the side of the briefcase. Not their first child then. The Alpha smiled at something on her screen, then pocketed the device, gathering her things to exit at the next stop. Sherlock felt an almost visceral longing as he watched her leave, visions gripping him of going home to a flat where his own mate and pups waited to greet him.
The tailor’s shop was an old-fashioned affair, a small place packed floor to ceiling with suits and tartans. An elderly man with a highland brogue so thick it was hard to understand him appeared to help them.
Sherlock pulled the shirt off over his head and bent to drop it onto a nearby chair. The muscles along his long lean back rippled, and John’s laughter died in his throat.
Sherlock slipped another finger inside, and allowed a rhythm to form as he rocked his hand into John, pleased when his lover moaned appreciatively.
Irene continued on her way around the room fetching up before a second stage where a seated man raised a paddle to strike the bottom of a woman dressed like a toddler over his knee. Her hair was caught up in two pigtails with large pink bows, while her ruffled shorts had been pulled down to expose her ever reddening arse cheeks. The little squirmed with each blow, but the man held her down in place to take the punishment.  A number of men with mouths half open gathered to stare, almost transfixed, watching the paddle rise and fall with a crack.
“Merlin’s arse, I knew I smelled too much smug in here,” Sherlock snapped.  “How’s the diet going, Mycroft, you look like you’ve gained three pounds.”
“Yeah, let’s go with midnight. If we don’t seem to be getting anywhere we can try again at another time. So, how tall was the tree?”
“Watson, relax.” Lupaza rose to put a hand to his shoulder. “We just need to start with food and a place to sleep. We’ll figure out the rest later.”
John felt his blood run cold. When he returned to the bedroom, he looked more closely, opening the wardrobe. Sherlock had taken several of his suits, and the rolling bag on the floor was now missing. Even the pyjamas on the chair were gone. John tugged at his hair. Sherlock had walked through the house, calmly packed a bag, pulled a blanket over John and then left without waking him, without saying a word. John sank to the bed, a horrible sound winding its way from his throat.
When Sherlock told her no, she stood and made to retrieve her own. “You can call your parents on mine. They shouldn’t worry another minute. I heard there was a riot down by the space port last night of all things. Thanks the Prophets you weren’t anywhere near all that bother.” She shivered as she left the room.
“Don’t be coy, John. You found it arousing. Was it the fantasy nature of the scenario or the dominance and submission?
“Is that so?” John reached up to run his thumb along Sherlock’s lower lip. Suddenly, he felt a serious weight settle over him. He was grateful the ache in his head had eased.
“No, no, no, I wasn’t inexperienced when I took you to bed.” Sherlock waved off whatever he saw brewing on John’s face. “I just don't do  . . . dating . . . romantic relationships.”
Their clothes fell away, and they lay entwined on a pallet on the floor. John, beautiful John, so trusting, laid out before him. “Prophets, Sherlock,
“Really? Dancing? I thought you hated dancing.” Molly stayed hunched, though a small light had kindled in her eyes.
They divided up, charming their school robes to match their team colour - Tom, Teddy, and Owen for the red team, and Dom, Victoire and John on the gold.
“Oh, right. Well, I am.” John blew out a breath as he sat back in his seat. “That isn’t what I meant though. It’s a bit more complicated than just that.”
Sherlock finally turned, finished. “I know a nice pub. It’s hard to get to though. It would be easier if you just side apparated with me rather than trying to follow my directions.”
John’s higher brain functions went completely off line as Sherlock worked fingers into him, sliding, whispering naughty things in John’s ear as he opened John up. They’d done this before, and John let himself joyfully dissolve, content to let Sherlock take him apart.
John sighed with relief, lowering the board to see the perfectly centred dart. “I never should have doubted you.”
“Baby.” John pulled Sherlock close enough to kiss his forehead. “You’re mine. You know that, right? No one else matters.”
“Hey, where’s my stuff?” John whirled back on the fluffy-haired git peering at him over the edge of the duvet he’d drawn almost to his nose.
Greetings lovelies! Sorry to take so long with another update. Sometimes pesky life gets in the way of fic writing - how very dare. I couldn't leave you all waiting TOO long though, wondering what happened with Victor. I adore playing with the character of Victor Trevor, and had so much fun imagining the lovely Idris Elba starring in all of his scenes. Hope you have fun with it too!
Sherlock wasn’t close enough to stop John leaping forward to knock the boy against a wall. He pinned him with a forearm pressed to his throat.
“Okay, good.” John settled back down beside him, drawing Sherlock gently against him. “I’ll miss you though.”
John chuckled, deeply pleased at Sherlock’s answer. A waiter walked by offering a tray of appetizers, and John happily chose a prawn wrapped in bacon. Sherlock waved the man off.
“Yeah, right-o. Hope there’s no anthrax or anything in here.”  John shook the envelope warily, producing only a slight rustling of paper.
“Yeah, but I don’t want to neglect you.” John’s eyes were soft. “There’s a council meeting tonight. Meet me for dinner at the house before?”
Sherlock bent again to grab a bottle of water, bringing it to his lips. His long throat moved, muscles working as he swallowed.  “I don’t know.” A small frown knit his brows together. “People don’t mind me in study sessions, but they tend to get tired of me in social situations.”
John dropped the plastic Tesco bags dangling from his fingertips. He made a tut of concern as he sank to his knees before Sherlock sprawled out over the couch. Well, perhaps
Sherlock made his way up to the bar, ordered a pint, and found an unlit place against the wall where he could lean to watch the drama unfold.
One good thing to come out of the Bludger Caper was a thawing of relations between John and Alastaire Holmes. While he and the posh nob were never going to be great friends, the boy had stopped openly antagonizing him, and had even given him a bit of advice in a Potions class to add more lovage than the recipe called for.
“Steady on, mate.” Tom glanced over. He had a quill stuck behind each ear. “At least you’ve got that great brain of a boyfriend to help you.”
“What you just saw was the essence of mok’bara  . . .” Sherlock pitched his voice to carry all around, “turning your opponent’s mind in on itself. In mok’bara you are not fighting your opponent. You are inviting your opponent to be their own downfall.”
When Sherlock finished, looking rather smug as the hand-cuffed men were dragged away, John couldn’t help it, he dropped to his knee right there in the grimy parking lot.
“I asked in a few others. I hope you don’t mind,” Irene said. The florescent light and burnt orange and lime walls made her look paler than usual, but the white jumper with a faux-fur collar she’d chosen suited her well.
Sherlock had retrieved his fallen disruptor after John had left the park that night, and chivvied Anderson out of the damn pub to finish their watch before returning to base quarters. He didn’t have much privacy, sharing a room with a number of other soldiers, but he quickly found a small utilities closet with space to store things, and began “midnight requisitioning” supplies, lifting things when no one was watching.
Sherlock eyed the wall and the electric wires in front of it thoughtfully. A wall to keep out the rest of the idiotic world, allowing him to explore his relationship with John in peace, was a good thing. The electric fence, though, was another matter. That was clearly meant to keep him penned in, like an animal. Unacceptable.
When he was done, John rose to his feet smoothly, fetching one of the fluffy white towels on the wall to lay by the edge of the tub. “There now. You can get out whenever you’re ready. Take your time.”
By the time John returned, Sherlock had removed the duvet from the bed and was lying on his side, naked. He patted the spot in front of him.
“Oh, good. Looks like the dorm’s going to murder Sherlock after all,” John said. “Saves me having to get rid of him.”
“Much as it pains me to say this, we do have to leave soon no matter what,” John jumped in. “Besides, love, I wanted to see your house, where you grew up.”
The three Bajorans were on the opposite bench, the boy passed out in the middle while the woman on the end seemed to be trying to short-circuit her manacles with the hairpin in her mouth despite the fact that John seemed to be reassuring her.
“Yeah, no .  .  . I don’t know. She’s just worried about me.”  John scrubbed a finger nail over a small stain by his knee.
“And it was Cedric the Brave who led the last charge that ended the last armed conflict,” Dom added.
John sighed. Reluctantly, he helped Sherlock empty the back of the cupboard, spreading the toys across the carpet of the bedroom floor for further inspection.
“Afternoon.” The older woman at the register greeted him cordially. “Let me know if you need any help with anything.”
Sherlock hated the look that had settled over John’s face. “Ah, well, it leaves more room for me to do this.” He pulled John closer to lick over his ear, catching the lobe between his lips for a soft nibble.
John felt a sudden surge of adrenaline and flipped Sherlock onto his back. Kissing Sherlock almost desperately John shoved his trousers and pants down far enough to free himself and then did the same to Sherlock’s.
He continues to leer down at John's naked and flushed form. He makes a show of grasping his long cock in his hand and strokes it firmly until it stands tall and proud. He shifts around the bed as John lifts his head to watch.
Sherlock didn’t know what to say. The daily life of Muggles was so clearly out of his range of expertise, he could hardly critique John’s fears.
John smiled, sucking in a lungful of clean air as he worked to keep up with Sherlock. It had been an age since he’d walked by the edge of the ocean like this. The scale was simply humbling. Even Sherlock didn’t seem immune to the effects of the wind and the waves, his eyes shining under inky curls soon tumbled by the sea breeze.
“Wow, Puddlemere’s doing well,” John said, glancing toward the game as the goal tally flashed over the screen.
Sherlock turned to look at John, gorgeous, wonderful John, and felt his heart sink. John watched him silently with eyes gone huge.
When John got back to the dorm that night, things were still as he’d left them, one large double bed still hulking in the middle of the room, and no stroppy roommate around. John readied himself for bed, about to turn in when a knock sounded at the door.
Sherlock gave one final wiggle before hopping off of John’s lap and removing a green Jenga block from the tower.
“Ta.” Victoire smiled, and they fell into step navigating their way around the students all dashing off to their next obligation.
Molly obligingly lightened the windows for a moment to wave. Irene sucked in a breath at the sight of the three Bajorans passed out over the back seats. Molly set the windows dark again as a woman walking a pet approached them on the pavement.  She glanced at Sherlock’s black uniform, and averted her eyes, hurrying past.
Tom found the advertisement for the underwater tours, bubble spells provided, and they all spent one afternoon being guided by a wiry, dark-haired Wizard hung round with multiple bracelets and anklets who simply introduced himself as Sparky. He led them down under the waves into the quiet blue expanse below, swimming through bright schools of fish and giant sea turtles. They even spied a long iridescent sea serpent that coiled beautifully in the waters as it undulated past them.  When a submersible vehicle of some sort bubbled past them, everyone was full of questions.
“Dunno, I guess the old bat wants to save money. Lord knows she won’t pass the savings on to her staff.” Donna said with a sneer.
“You lot, stay here.” Teddy yelled at the rest of the team as he, and Victoire, and John pushed off on their brooms to join the melee overhead.  They flew in quickly.
“I’ve got it all set up. A picnic in the clue box room. We can turn off the light and it’ll be pitch black in there. I’ll feed you.”
“I hope so. Do I need to get on my knee and ask?” John teased. He reached out to take his hand. “Sherlock, will you do me the extreme honor of being my fabulous, brilliant, gorgeous, amazing real-life boyfriend?”
So warm, Sherlock was deliciously warm, slumped in a heap against him. If John tipped his face his face down just a bit, he could smell Sherlock’s breath. It was slightly sour, but mostly it simply smelled like Sherlock, only more so. Springy curls tickled against his cheek. John’s arm caught under him had gone all pins and needles. John wanted to move it, but he didn’t want to risk waking the man. Sherlock shifted then, made the tiniest noise as he burrowed just a bit closer, his nose nearly in John’s armpit as his hand tightened over his waist. John could feel his insides warming, a tingling building low in his groin.
“Let’s talk about it inside,” John said with a grimace. “And Owen? Let’s not ever get four bottles of booze for two people again.”
“You also look beautiful.” John dropped one knee to the mattress, leaning in to drop a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead.
Eventually they moved apart to clean up. John would have loved a shower for two, but the small facilities had them taking turns in the loo. As soon as they were decently dressed, John’s growling stomach had him chivvying Sherlock along to the small restaurant downstairs that featured a buffet breakfast. It wasn’t anything fancy, but it was good enough for a hearty refueling. Sherlock shied away from the noise of the other travelers, wrinkling his nose at a nearby family with several loud children. John steered them toward a small table as far away from them as possible and set about insisting that Sherlock ingest a meaningful amount of food.
Their next round of mating was no less intense, but infinitely more tender, each caress, each stroke, each bitten-off cry part of the love story they were building between them. Sherlock was the one who broke down and cried as John rode on top of him a second time.
He didn’t need to say it twice. Someone knocked a pan to the ground and cried out as the staff scrambled to exit, phones appeared in people’s hands to light the way.
Somehow the beautiful man guessed he had just gotten back from service and was staying with a relative. It was amazing. For the first time since he’d come back to England, he felt like someone was actually seeing him. It was as if the edges that had gone all blurry on him were finally coming back into focus.
John slid alongside Sherlock, looping his arm around his waist. Sherlock spread his own arm across John’s back. He could smell the poncy cologne Sherlock had used earlier, but underneath he smelled just a bit sweaty, gloriously musky. John wanted to lick him. They waited, pressed alongside each other while Mrs. Holmes fussed with the device, turning it on. There wasn’t anywhere else John wanted to stand, and yet . . . was it another lie to stand here before Sherlock’s mother, pretending to be close like this? John shook his head mentally. It was just a picture.
Sherlock rose and pulled John into his arms. John gulped wetly against his chest as a shiver ran through him.
“You’re an idiot.” John snorted. At Sherlock’s noise of protest, John reached over to pat his leg. “But you’re my idiot.”
“John. Your stomach’s been growling for over an hour, and I don’t have any food in the flat. Let me take you out, please. I want to.”
“I was smarter than any of the doctors Mycroft dredged up for me. I thought I knew it all, how much to take, how to stay on top of it. Then . . .” He glanced back toward the fire. “Then I got so tired of it all. I just didn’t care about anything anymore. What was the point?”
“Really? I mean, I know you said that before we met you never thought sex was worth the trouble, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you never had a crush on anyone.”
John leaned forward, and opened his mouth. It only took Sherlock’s clever fingers a few moments to find him. He popped something onto John’s tongue that exploded in a metallic, salty brine when he bit down. It wasn’t his favorite, but it was interesting. He moved it around in his mouth as he chewed, focusing on the feel and taste of it.
“No certainly not.” Mycroft retrieved his wand to summon a large purple bottle that soared into his hand.  “Aloe-dittany cream?” He asked, extending the bottle with one eyebrow delicately arched.
At a special request from the teachers for the younger students in the learning center, Sherlock had even made an appearance for a basic tutorial on computer safety. There were several consoles open in the community center, and though they were locked down with firewalls, adventurous souls could trip through the safeguards in place if they were determined. Sherlock came in to teach the children of the camp how to access the net safely. It was nearly lunch by the time he headed back to main house.
“Can’t leave you alone for a minute, can I?” John’s voice came out strangled. “Sherlock, you promised.”
John pulled Sherlock down and kissed him tenderly. After a short eternity Sherlock pulled back a few millimetres and murmured, "So. What do you think? Shall we fire the flare?"
The bodyguard glowered at Sherlock as he showed him to the door. Sherlock paused in the foyer, wanting to give the man a few tips on spotting suspicious people in crowds. Before he could speak though, the man surprised him, grabbing Sherlock's bicep to crowd into his personal space.  He was big for a Beta, a few inches taller than Sherlock himself, and he had to tip his head back slightly to make eye contact.
“No, no, I’m coming, it’s just you’ve been asking to meet my special someone, and I wasn’t very forthcoming.” John took a deep breath. “I should have said something earlier. I’m actually with a man. His name is Sherlock, and I’m bringing him to the ball . . . and I hope that won’t be a problem.”
“Are you ready for bed?” John asked brightly. “I can turn out the lights whenever you want to go to sleep.”
Grand-mère Holmes stepped outside to catch the tail end of John’s shout, and the subsequent peals of mirth of those gathered.
It felt electric, as if a current had just passed over John’s skin. He leaned into it, placing his forearms on top of the table.
The last few days had flown by. Sherlock had taken John out one morning to an ice skating rink that Irene’s housemate Kate had recommended, and the two of them had bashed about having even more fun than they'd expected. Sherlock had skated before, but it was John’s first time, and he’d wobbled about with spells from Sherlock to keep him upright until he found his feet.
His body had gone still. John grabbed at him, pulling him up, howling.  “Noooooo! Prophets, please, NOOO!”
“Oh, well, good then.” John wasn’t quite sure what else to say, and the two returned to their separate pursuits on their computers.
“Mmm, you gorgeous slut, what if I knotted you right now? Plugged you up as I filled you with my hot cum?”
“Dr. Callum can take a long walk off a short pier if he has a problem with it, with us. Honestly, sweetheart, I’m done with hiding myself.” John leaned in to drop a kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“Oh, please.” The blush that stole over Sherlock’s pale skin was delightful. John left off being annoyed with the ridiculous man in favor of pulling him in closer for a kiss. It went on long enough to involve a tangling of tongues, but eventually they parted for air. The flush on Sherlock had settled down to his collar bones, and John wondered how far down it went.
John reached out to touch the side of the cave, it was bumpy and rippled like the waves that had helped shape it. “Yeah, lead on.”
The girls were only the beginning. Just when Sherlock thought he’d gotten used to having them around, following after Lupaza like little hatchlings, a whole family with a baby showed up asking for shelter. A few days later, a couple of young men trickled in. They quickly set up the barn as a place for people to bed down, the girls naturally gravitating to the family that already had small ones with them.
Mycroft was as good as his word, mostly keeping to himself for the rest of the week either settled in an upstairs study with only the coming and going of owls as evidence of his presence, or else out and about, returning only for bedtime.  He announced he wouldn’t be back one evening as he had an engagement in London. Sherlock teased him horribly about having a hot date, and though Mycroft reddened a bit over his cheekbones, he gave nothing away as he bid them good-night, took a portkey stone from a black bowl in the foyer, and disappeared.
“I heard that most of their food supplies have been impounded,” Sherlock returned hotly. “No one seems to be caring much how the Bajorans will survive. I can see why they’d want to lash out. The Governors have stopped doing their job if they can’t even manage to maintain the basic necessities of the people they are supposed to be ruling.” Sherlock was shocked at the man’s stupidity.
John and Mike waited, watching as she clicked her way down the pavement toward her dorm before they continued on. Mike asked John how he thought the football team would do that year, and John happily dissected the team’s strengths and weaknesses all the way back to their dorm.
John lifted one of Sherlock’s feet to mouth over his toes, and Sherlock giggled, a lovely low-pitched sound. When he took the toes into his mouth to suck, the laughter deepened further into a groan. The exploration over Sherlock’s feet morphed into another round of love making, this time sweet and slow. They finally left the bedroom only when John’s stomach growls became distracting.
“Mmmm. That feels better. I think I need this shirt off though.” John peeled the wet thing off, dragging it over his head ever so slowly. He tossed it somewhere behind, off-camera.
“Thank you. That was lovely.” John went up a step, turning to face Sherlock still down on the walk, putting them at the same height. John grinned, enjoying the momentary level playing field.
They stumbled upright, searching for clothes on the floor. Sherlock had his trousers half on when he looked over at John in his pants, sleep rumpled trying to figure out the holes on his shirt.
“Then come on.” Sherlock led him into the lobby around a boy and a girl kissing ardently against a wall.
“Well, it doesn’t follow the plot of the Hobbit exactly. In the real story the dwarves are trying to retake the Mountain stronghold.”
Sherlock sighed. He felt about thirteen again with Mummy telling him to hurry and get dressed for the latest tea party.
“This . . . this was wonderful, don’t misunderstand, but I’m really not looking for a relationship . . .” John said feeling like a complete arse.
The next two days were fairly uneventful. Sherlock went back to his lab and John finished The Hobbit, and then found a novel he hadn’t read yet.
Cardassians didn’t have body hair and though Sherlock knew his cock wasn’t anything out of the ordinary for his species, a Cardassian penis was only half the size of a Bajoran’s. There were jokes about it, dirty ones told any place soldiers had a few minutes to linger, drinking or smoking, shooting the breeze – Bajorans little better than beasts, hung like a waterbull, splitting their women in two when they mounted them, animals who could hardly stand upright from the massive organ hanging between their legs. It was all unbearably rude.
“Oh come, you two. It’s not so bad as all that, going to dinner. There might even be treacle tart for afters if you’re lucky,” Mycroft teased.
Sherlock struggles to solve the clues, but John helps uncover things, remaining a conductor of light.
He and John hadn’t been apart this long in years. For a moment, Sherlock felt as though he were a child again, back at his first night at the military academy, crying himself to sleep as quietly as he could in the crowded dormitory. The sound of footsteps and snatches of a conversation in Bajoran drifted in from the corridor beyond. Sherlock took a deep breath to calm himself. He wasn’t at some horrid military school, he was on Bajor, and he’d seen John tomorrow when he returned to the farm.
They stood, Sherlock reaching up to rehang the picture when a man in a thin suit stalked loudly into the room. “MINDY! Where is that girl?” He bellowed.  “How about Lara? We have clients in a half an hour and we need the tea and pastries in the conference room.”
Mycroft softened further.  “Though my brother continues to eschew direct communication with me, I have it from reliable sources that he continues to excel at Herr Moser’s workshop.  Also his association with certain unsavory characters  . . . has thankfully come to an end.”
Sherlock waved Shakaar off when he made to refill his glass as well.  “No thank you. One was . . . sufficient.”
The facility was reasonably warm throughout all the rooms, but John had to agree there was a bit of a chill,  psychological if not temperature-wise, in this clinical-looking dorm space.
“Make the prisoners ready to travel. If any of them die in transit, I’ll be holding everyone here personally responsible.”
“Actually,” Mycroft said, his face returning to its more habitual neutral mask. “I do have something from our grandfather to pass on to Alastaire.”
He ended up spending the rest of the day with Harry and Clara, helping them out around the house, and staying for dinner. Finally, as it grew later in the evening, he had to beg off, go home to sleep and get ready for work.
John poured himself over Sherlock, kissing him as if he’d lost his place in a book and had to reread everything to get back to where they’d left off. Sherlock growled low in the back of his throat as John snogged him, deeply, deliberately, dissolving them both into the mattress.
Sherlock fetched another round of drinks and led John to some chairs to watch. John wasn’t sure what was in his glass, but Sherlock had thrust it into his hand unceremoniously so he tried it. It tasted tropical.
“John, I’m sorry this is necessary. I know I’m not really the owner of your family’s farm. It’s yours. It will always be yours.”
might look in his beekeeping gear, but as they moved toward his hives, his excitement at showing them off took over, and he forgot to be self-conscious.
“He’s not as bad as the rest. We’ve talked a few times. He’s doing a spore study for school that’s quite interesting. He’s really rather bright.” Molly shrugged a shoulder.
Naavi sauntered in, yawning, tell-tale marks along his neck. He found a bowl and a cup of tea, and sheepishly joined them at their table.
Dom caught Tom with an impressive blast of gold across the back of his head, bringing the score even 10 to 10. They decided that was game over then, as fully one third of the players were wrapped together, snogging heatedly, and ignoring everyone else.
Owen coloured slightly. “I told her I was away at a special school and we can’t have mobiles, or get letters from anyone who’s not family. She’ll write to my parents' house, and I’ll send my owl to pick up her letters and drop mine off.”
“Speak for yourself.” Dom flicked his wand a bit too forcefully, sending a stack of folded clothes careening into his trunk. “We’ll be working in our dad’s shop all summer, and he sells plenty of
“Well, that really is disgusting." John moved closer to view the awful thing despite his first instinct to pull away. "Why keep something like that around?” He asked wrinkling his forehead.
“It’s fine, John.” Sherlock cleared his throat. “After tonight I’m certainly well aware of your status.”
John broke off, pulling back to yank his clothes away, cursing as he had to lean back to tug his shoes off. Sherlock lay panting until John returned, sliding in over him to kiss him again like he wanted to push him through the mattress. John’s steely erection slid over Sherlock’s still clothed one, and he groaned at the feeling of it.
Victor and Sherlock held a mumbled exchange. John shook Victor’s hand, and then their friends were gone.
Again, and again Sherlock dipped his head, worshipping the length of John’s cock with his lips, and tongue, and fingers holding him steady. When John came, shuddering as he emptied himself down Sherlock’s throat, it was like a blessing, and Sherlock swallowed the bitter fluid like the gift it was.
John winced. He’d told Sarah early on that he was living with someone when she’d casually inquired about his relationship status. He hadn’t specified Sherlock’s gender though, and Sarah had naturally assumed a woman. All John had to do was correct her, no big deal . . .
“I know, but Sherlock was experimenting again,” she said, giving a spot a last swish with the sponge. “I popped over with a casserole I thought you might like, and couldn’t help doing a bit of tidying.”
“Yeah, I like that.” Victor kicked off his shoes, and shucked his trousers, revealing a pair of tight dark briefs before moving to collapse over the bed.
“John. Jesus. Of course you’re good enough. God, when we were growing up, I thought you were sodding PERFECT. Sherlock’s lucky to get you . . . Mr. ex-soldier, doctor with a job.”
“Mr. Holmes. I was wondering,” Heera spoke in a rush. “A new patrol is forming soon, and I wondered if you could tell Mistress Kira that I’ve been progressing in class well. I’d like to be considered, to be included . . . in the patrol that is.”
Decision made, Sherlock was able to smile and nod, agreeing with his mother that they needed to get some wall paper in their new house to match the pattern in the back parlour. It was a lovely green. Sherlock returned to his room to gather up a bundle of his old Bajoran clothes, stuffing them into a bag to carry as the last boxes were moved out to the van. When all was stowed to Mummy’s satisfaction, Sherlock and his mother returned to the vehicle waiting to drive them back to the military base.
“Naughty boy, playing with your food,” he growled by John’s ear, sucking at the sensitive spot behind his jaw as he fondled John balls, returning to massage over his cock.
John wrapped his hand over Sherlock’s knee on the drive home, letting the breeze from the window blow any complicated thoughts away. Sherlock grinned at him, squeezing John’s hand before moving to shift gears. Sherlock parked the Aston Martin in the garage, careful to make sure John had easy access to his car for the morning.
“Love, calm down.” The higher-pitched voice of his mother soothed. “Sherlock isn’t like Mycroft. He’s . . . different. You know full well that a scientist or a doctor could serve the empire just as well as a soldier. Sherlock isn’t cut out . . .” her voice dropped lower as she moved farther into the room as well.
“I believe I saw one go by . . .” Sherlock waved discreetly and a servant moved over to refresh the woman’s cocktail.
“I love you,” John whispered, tears gathering in the corners of his eyes. He pulled Sherlock to him as tightly as he could.
Lupaza moved to the replicator to get some wine to celebrate. They took it out to the barn to inform the rest of the crew of their decision, and a few toasts turned into an evening of singing and drinking around a bonfire before everyone finally dragged off to bed in the wee hours.
“Oh, well,” John pushed up to his elbows. “I don’t have to stay in here with you if you wanted some privacy. I’m sure there’s other rooms. The house is quite massive, isn’t it?”
The neighborhood was quiet this early in the morning. A few cars pulled out of driveways, racing off to who knew where, but for now, he had the sidewalk alone.  More pedestrians appeared at the main road, and Sherlock waited by a woman with a toddler, and two boys in hoodies at the bus stop.
They reached the shop Sherlock had seen earlier, a local place, not a chain pharmacy, in a small whitewashed building with a steeply-pitched roof. Sherlock pulled the door open, and John followed behind. He found it to be more of a general store than just a chemist’s. Sherlock went straight for the allergy section, but John poked around a bit, wondering if he needed anything. He drifted past some cleaning supplies to a display by the counter and found himself looking at a shelf of condoms and various lubricants. Oh God. His mind went to terrible, steamy places almost instantly.
“With her? No. But if it’s something you want to try, I’d be willing to give it another go. Don’t get your hopes up too high, though. I’m not sure it’s all that it’s cracked up to be. Aside from the awkward angles and the near-suffocation and the biting, I think it’s just kind of hard to focus on your own pleasure and somebody else’s at the same time.”
“I know,” John said, helping himself to another slice of pepperoni. “What a wanker. He’s running you ragged, and I’m sorry. It would be an improvement – him being a slug. At least the office would be quieter. You won’t though, will you?” John glanced at him, a wrinkle between his eyebrows.
“Look, I just . . . I need to try this, okay? I need to get out of your guest room, and Sherlock is wonderful. He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I want you to be happy for me . . . for us.”
Sherlock snagged a blanket on the trunk at the end of the bed and unfolded it to lay over John’s sleeping form, then crawled as carefully as he could onto the bed to join him.
“Your date?” Kevin sputtered turning to sweep a rude glance over Sherlock. “I didn’t know you were gay!”
John stood close beside his host watching his long, pale hands flitter over his equipment, and stacks of molded soap.
“He said he was staying with his old . . . with Victor Trevor. I don’t have the address, and it’s not listed anywhere yet.”
“That’s right. All the suites come with a bedwarmer if requested. It’s very popular with business travelers.”
“Jaaaawwn,” Sherlock groaned, fingers tightening in John’s hair to pull slightly. “Please, please . . .”
“Thank you, so much.” Sherlock took a large gulp of cold water as he watched John settling into a nearby chair with a glass holding something darker. “Thank you also for agreeing to meet with me.”
“I’m sure you can lend Mike a pencil or share notes later in the day,” Sherlock teased, reaching his hand further to wrap it securely around John’s erection.
It had been years since the caste system had been truly in effect on Bajor but a squad of teens born in the lower caste had grown weary of teasing from those from the upper class. The argument between them had escalated quickly to violence.  Sherlock had sadly noted several of his students caught up in the fray. Some of the troublemakers had needed medical attention, but the rest had been sent back to their parents with the understanding  that punishment would be forthcoming.
“John, you want to be a healer.” Sherlock sighed.  “You have to finish school for that. I’ll not let you throw that away.”
“We’re providing a place for refugees, older people, children, growing food for the Resistance! What in bloody fuck gives you the right . . .” John lunged forward, nearly red in the face.
“Whew, well, what say we call it an evening too?” John said, stretching his back. “About ready to go?”
Sherlock moved to his shelves, selecting the jar he wanted. He found a knife and pulled out a chunk of the wax and honey together, sawing off a bit for John to try.
“Sherlock, these are some friends of mine. Kira Nerys, Shakaar Edon, this is Sherlock Holmes.”  John gestured between them.
“Stefan,” his mother hissed, obviously afraid their good luck might run out. “You must get up, now.”
“No, no, I’m not, you’re the beautiful one.” Sherlock felt another wave of shyness swamping over him, as he pulled back, his erection retreating.
