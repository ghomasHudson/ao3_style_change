“Was Victor the reason you started up your investigations?” John asked one afternoon when they were both home. Sherlock sat at the kitchen table, eyes firmly attached to his microscope (there were livers and fingernails involved; John didn’t ask) while John wrote up his latest blog post—a freaky scarlet file case about girls wearing other people’s faces upside down. A case of writer’s block had his mind wandering, and as it did so often lately, it settled on the mystery of Victor Trevor, and he decided to finally bring up the topic.
After the kidnapping, the stories about kids and weird happenings multiplied. They received an email from another woman, Phoebe Yi, whose child was the focus of some strange circumstances. Like with Robert and Sammy, seven-year-old Katie Yi’s mother was seeing a mysterious shadow out of the corner of her eye when her daughter was near. Once there was even a thump followed by a broken living room window. Still, John only brought Sherlock on when, after some strange noises coming from Katie’s room, Phoebe found numbers and symbols carved onto her daughter’s bed frame, which had moved several feet across the room even though it was almost too heavy for Phoebe herself to move.
“Not so good at the moment. He got a message from Victor recently, asking him to stop looking for him. It’s made him …” He ran his hands through his hair, unsure how to word it.
John paused halfway to sitting. “Wait. What? Is Simon here? Did he call?”
“I don’t have an ability,” Sherlock argued, but he sounded desperate, like he was trying to convince himself. John leaned in so their arms touched. Sherlock pressed in closer.
“Shit,” said John.
They signed off, and John leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. “Well that was slightly creepy.”
Sherlock had tried making tea the first few days after they’d returned from Bath, and John, bruised and battered, had let him. They’d both decided that as soon as John could stand, he’d return to manning the teapot. And some things were best forgotten.
“Hmmm.”
Sherlock turned and squinted at John. “Boulder Field?”
Sherlock’s expression cleared, then morphed into exhaustion.
Sherlock’s nervous huff puffed the air in front of him with white. “Ready?”
Holmes rolled his eyes and sighed. “I’m not going to steal it or break it. I just want to prove a point.”
Holmes settled in a leather chair near the desk. John took the seat across from him, a red-print chair that looked like it had seen its fair share of years. “My research or the reward?”
John felt something well up inside him as she talked. Part of him was jealous that this boy had known Sherlock before he’d put up his walls. Part of him was glad Sherlock had someone to lean on, someone who understood him. And part of him was just happy to be getting any information on Sherlock that didn’t come straight from the man’s stubbornly schtum lips.
“Look. I’m sor–”
“Even in my late teens? Vi– Victor never mentioned it.” Sherlock was getting better about mentioning his old friend, but it still took effort.
Sherlock set up a laptop at his desk, and John took a seat next to him, leaning over so they were both on the screen. He was close enough to get a whiff of spice from Sherlock’s aftershave. It smelled nice. A ringing came from the laptop speakers, and Sherlock accepted the call.
“It was nice, getting more sleep.”
Victor have to do with any of it? He had disappeared before Sherlock had even really dived into the paranormal, before all the weirdness started. Or was his disappearance the beginning?
“Three more days.” Eurus collected her things and breezed out of the room. “See you tomorrow. Kisses!”
Sherlock’s smile was tremulous. “Perhaps our goal should be to get through tomorrow so we can figure out what this is,” he said, twiddling a finger between them.
John smiled. “How old were you?”
“But you’ve mentioned several times since I met you about the importance of evidence. But there's very little evidence that they have a bad marriage.”
“Either Trent hearing things that aren’t there because of the shared psychosis or a cleverly placed recorder.”
“I don’t even know if there’s anything to do. For all I know, this is an elaborate hoax to get back at
“Let me guess, you disproved that anyone had jumped?”
now. Small beans compared to your life, though, eh, Mr. War Correspondent.”
he could know we talked to Trent about the drawings.” Sherlock’s voice was sarcastic. “I can do the same tricks. It’s called reading the room.”
John ran a hand through his hair. “Right. Not everything’s about you, Watson. I get it. Yeah, take your time though. Well, not–”
Having a good idea, John still asked. “What do people normally say?”
Another minute and Sherlock finally took a deep breath and his face came alive again. “I’m your best friend?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Just as John was falling asleep, he heard Sherlock whisper, “I love you more than life itself, John Watson.” Then he felt a soft pressure on his lips before Sherlock cuddled him closer.
P.S. Glushka is pronounced Gloosh-kuh, Cenophus is Sen-uh-fuss, and Gigas is Gee-gus (both hard G sounds).
“Funny, I didn’t ask,” Eurus quipped. She entered the room and dropped her bags. “Less than two weeks to the main event, I thought you could use some extra support.”
Sherlock scoffed. “Dog with a bone.”
“Yeah?”
“You’re going to make tea just because my sister asked for it?”
“Fred Barnes found drawings in Simon’s room.”
The cave they’re at is
“But the dreams,” John argued.
Sherlock’s glare softened with timidity. “Even you?”
face.
I’ll be back next week with the first file. A story about two young boys, decades apart, but with the same mysterious, one might even say creepy, background. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
“Then why did you ask?”
Sherlock sighed.
“But something had to put you on the path.”
. Sherlock, what was that?”
Next week, we dive into another scarlet file and investigate the Unsound. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
“That may be, but now you live with someone who is investigating those scarlet files for his other job, and he could use your help explaining things. Maybe you can see a new solution while you’re at it.”
Far too many hours later, they’d arrived in California, dropped their things at their hotel, and gone to the Los Gatos police station. Sherlock talked with the head detective as well as Sammy’s parents. There wasn’t much more to learn about his actual disappearance, but photos of the boys’ loo, the hallway, the cloakroom he’d been in before he was taken all proved there was no way the boy could have left apart from the hallway where a teacher waited for him.
So I didn’t expect Eurus to hang around. But I liked writing her a few chapters back, and I thought we needed someone to draw out some feelings from Sherlock. He’s been so closed-mouthed this whole time. He needs a kick in the butt.
“You have a drawer full of unsolved cases, but still you whinge that there is nothing to do, hmm?” He crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes at his new flatmate.
“And you …?”
“You, Sherlock Holmes, are too stubborn to die,” John said, leaning up to press a quick kiss to his lips. “Or maybe I never got around to finishing writing it, and it’s a mashup of two different posts …”
“Precisely, Mr. Holmes. Sacred geometry is great for creating doors. And music can be seen as–”
“Come along, John.”
John stiffened. “What?”
“Huh.”
“Come on,” John wheedled. “People want to know what you do, your process, how you discern the fakers. And that includes those mysterious red folders.”
A shy grin bloomed on Sherlock’s face in return. “Good.”
“You’ve been staring at my chair for the past hour. What happened?”
Things felt different at night. There was no fighting, no churlish comments, no anger or annoyance. Instead, they bonded wordlessly, together in their sleeplessness. John wasn’t sure why Sherlock wasn’t sleeping, or what nightmares haunted him. They never discussed what brought them together in the night.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stood up. John stayed seated a moment longer, studying the young man across from him. He was an arsehole, creepy, and probably untrustworthy, but he was also the only one—aside from Victor—who had offered them any sort of explanation. He didn’t want to believe a word the man said, but did he really have a choice? If there was even a chance that children would die if they didn’t find a way to stop the Order …
“You know
“I meant to … Sorry … Mess … I was going to … Sorry.” He darted into the lounge and began grabbing things.
“Why don’t you just take over,” he growled, more harshly than he’d intended. He stood and turned to hand his computer to Sherlock, who looked at him in confusion.
He let Anderson whine and complain a while longer before taking his leave. He then went directly home and started researching Holmes. Here was a man he could get behind—a real investigator, with proven methods, a stellar track record, and a possibly interesting backstory, if his current odd career and the reward money were any indication. The next day, he’d talked Mike into letting him interview the man, which proved harder than expected, but John was too intrigued to give up.
John threw up his hands. “What else was I supposed to think? I have no need to know about him unless you decide to tell me. So the only reason someone has for sending a mysterious text is if it has to do with the blog.”
They spent a little longer talking with Fred and a few patients familiar with the two young men, then headed back to London. Without solving it, of course. Granted, they rarely solved their cases in an afternoon. If it was good enough to get Sherlock out of the house, it was good enough to challenge him for at least a few days, if not longer. Still, John was pretty sure this one would end up a scarlet file. Sherlock might be fine calling it mass hysteria and a troubled genius, but something about that bothered John.
“When you’re a genius, everyone’s an idiot,” John muttered, tapping out a few more sentences.
“No. I haven’t talked to her since I interviewed her days ago. She called me after you
Just then a tall man strode through the open door, long coat streaming after him. “Ah, Mrs. Hudson. I need the files on the Sagamore case. Donovan keeps hounding me about it, and I want–”
“People are idiots,” John finally got out.
they’re summoning demons.”
John’s eyebrows went up. He’d not seen the man so flustered yet. Bad day? Frustrating case? He watched Sherlock flutter around the room, stacking folders together, shoving tapes in drawers, closing laptops.
“Hmm.” John wondered if that was the full story. Surely someone willing to send two different sets of video footage, and who seemed genuine, wanted more of an answer than that. He made a note to talk to Mike about getting in touch with Robert Torres. It might make for an interesting second article. He was supposed to be moving on to a new topic for the next post, but people rescuing endangered animals from private buyers just didn’t pique his interest the way the paranormal—or Sherlock, if he was being honest—did.
It’s getting harder to deal face the space issue, though. Three months in, and John and Rosie spend more time at Baker Street than they do in Chiswick. John’s wardrobe at the flat is full again, toys have ended up in places outside of the sitting room (John once found a stuffed animal in one of the kitchen cabinets and has no idea how it got there), the refrigerator is full of veg instead of body parts.
“But you’re here.”
a bit scary.”
Holy crap, it's an ending! I've never written anything this long before. O_O
“Hmm. My usual?”
They did not speak, by tacit agreement, of what they learned on the trip until a few days after they’d returned to Baker Street. They were both trying to sort the new information internally, and John could tell Sherlock was mentally exhausted. And they both were still sleeping poorly, so a few days’ rest seemed the best course of action. They had a little time still before they had to make decisions.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied.
John sighed. “Fine. Whatever. You have to admit the kid is creepy, though.”
“Uh, no …” John scanned the email. “He says he’s in Russia. He’s tracked down a composer who claims to be able to neutralize the Unsound. Percival Black, you heard of him?”
Sherlock pressed his lips together until the seam between them was white. “This was my first case,” he finally said slowly, not looking at John. “It’s where my career really began.”
“Or I could dictate to you …”
Sherlock nodded. “My mind was growing stagnant. I needed a challenge.”
“And then she moved out?” Sherlock continued. John ceded the questioning to the other man, knowing he knew what to ask more than John would. Plus, he was interested to see Sherlock’s process in action.
“Twentieth-century pianist and composer. Russian. Died young. His music isn’t terrible. He was banned from BBC radio because the director thought his compositions were evil.” Sherlock looked like he hoped to someday be banned from the BBC. Knowing him, it wasn’t a surprise or an impossibility.
When John awakes from his nap a few hours later, it’s to the gentle strains of Sherlock’s violin. The pack ‘n play has been set up in the middle of the sitting room. Rosie is still awake, but no longer crying. Instead she’s gumming what turns out to be a teething ring that John knows he didn’t pack. Her eyes drift shut from time to time, but she’s fighting sleep.
“And was it?” John was talking to his third subject, Philip Anderson, when the man mentioned Sherlock Holmes, and in that same annoyed tone as the other two investigators had. And if the developing pattern held true, then there was good reason that Holmes had “thrown a wobbly.” He might be an arrogant prat, but he seemed to know what he was talking about.
Eurus shrugged. “Five possibilities, none I’m willing to share until I learn more.”
“Oi!”
Eurus muttered something that might have included the words “flesh” and “end,” but John didn’t let it distract him. Only one Holmes could hold his attention.
“You don't find that a bit patronizing? To reduce their experiences, which sound frightening to them, to a bad marriage?”
John shook his head. “Trying to survive.”
“When did she move?”
It felt revealing to say it, but in this liminal space, that didn’t bother him. In fact, it felt more right than anything he’d said since they’d met. Sherlock relaxed further and nodded. He positioned his violin and bow and began to play again. John listened for the rest of the night.
She continued to stare out the glass. “The men.”
He stayed silent for a while, leaning in so their shoulders touched. “What if … I can’t prove it’s all fake?”
Sherlock joined him at some point in the night, and that was it. They were a … Them. Best friends, but also something else. It was physical only in the sense that their limbs brushed each other during restless moments, that they woke with only an inch of space between them. And there was more touching during waking hours, comforting and soft. John took to bussing a kiss to Sherlock’s head when he walked by his chair. Sherlock would slide a hand over John’s shoulder as they passed each other. They sat together on the sofa more often than in their individual chairs. It wasn’t exactly a
John glanced at Sherlock, furiously laying into his violin with his bow, then he nodded to the kitchen table. He pulled the doors shut behind them to dampen the sound a bit.
John nodded. “Yeah, he was napping and woke to hands around his neck and Simon standing over him, choking him. He was able to get the attention of the staff, but by the time they arrived, Trent was alone.”
“I don’t. It’s fine. It’s good. Very good.”
“Bored.”
The café Simon had named for their meetup was so crowded when they arrived, they almost didn’t find a table. With no sign of their contact yet, John took the opportunity to check out exits and get a couple of coffees. When he returned to their table, Sherlock was having a staring contest with a strange man sat across from him. Before John could fully seat himself, Sherlock stood.
“Yeah, for as long as I can remember,” she said, settling into John’s chair, while he and Sherlock took the sofa—the two of them gravitating to each other without thought ever since Sherlock’s first night in John’s bed.
“Four.”
“Uh yeah,” Fred began, twisting his hands together. “Well, the staff’s. We thought it would cause more problems if we left it—acting out, episodes, the like.”
“You never disproved it.”
“‘I’m tired of taking their orders. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, stay vigilant. I’ll be in touch.’”
“It’s fine. Really.” He smiled.
“Tall Paul.”
And that was it. John waited sleepily for more to happen and half-heartedly thought up quips and questions to try to understand what was happening, but he fell asleep before he could execute any of them.
John nudged him none too softly in the side and shook his head. Sherlock rolled his eyes but kept further disparaging remarks to himself.
Her face lit up, but she mimed zipping her lips.
, Sherlock.”
“A drunkenly composed text from your brother? Was he complaining about his soon-to-be ex-wife or about the job he’s about to lose?”
Demands died in his throat when his eyes landed on the walls, two of which were completely covered with paper and string. It was just like every conspiracy wall he’d seen in films and on television.
It was pretty much what John expected from an in-patient room at a psychiatric facility—neat, with a few books piled tidily on the desk, but not much more in the way of personal effects. A little sterile, but not unexpected.
“I hope she milked him for a few good meals, too, for leaving us high and dry.”
“Well, for the good of Rosie.” Sherlock inhales.
Sherlock scoffed and turned back to the window.
In the past, he’d eventually be picked up by one of Mycroft’s minions who hoped he’d give up some dirt on Sherlock. John actually wished for those days now. Not only had they been simpler, but he thought he could use Mycroft’s advice right then, loath as he was to admit that. Both on how to deal with his younger siblings, but also on what to do with this whole apocalypse thing. Sherlock was keeping schtum on whether the event would actually open gates to hell, and Eurus vacillated on her opinion. John didn’t know what to think. There were so many connections, so much weirdness, that it had to be real, right? But on the other hand, an honest-to-God apocalyptic event? This wasn’t
“Just?” John took a moment to take a proper look at his (more than a?) friend. Just because Sherlock was getting more sleep didn’t mean all was well. There was still Victor and child killers and Simon and loads of paranormal confusion to keep his mind stressed. It was good seeing him do something as simple as bicker with his sister, but that was a moment’s distraction. Real life was at the door, knocking incessantly.
Not sure what he was looking for, he searched for a little bit of everything. Glushka didn’t yield much beyond what Sherlock had already told him, but the Order of the Cenophus gave better results. Sherlock put him in touch with a professor at Cambridge who knew some of the history, most of which, apparently, was apocryphal. Still, it was interesting.
“Well he didn’t.”
It took five days for John to convince Mike to let him interview Robert Torres, then another three to get in touch with the subject himself. He decided Sherlock should be invited to participate as well, and it didn’t take much persuading, which made John believe he wasn’t happy with how things had ended during his initial investigation. Because Robert lived in California, they met over a video call. It was ten days since he’d met Sherlock. His first article had been posted four days after that initial meeting, and he was chomping at the bit to get a second story out, especially once he read through the scarlet file and learned a little more backstory.
John’s chill bumps were back. If the great Sherlock Holmes hadn’t solved it, it must be real, right? “Don’t you owe the person who sent you the videos one mill?”
John took a moment to study his friend’s face, then turned to the screen. An old home video began to play. Like many others he’d seen from the scarlet files, it looked like it had been transferred from VHS or something older. The view was of a young girl, maybe five or six. Her hair was in two bunches, and she wore a dress and cardigan that looked like they were from the seventies or eighties. She looked at the person recording the video, then gazed through a set of doors in a glass porch she stood in, out into the night.
“I’ve been calling,” the man complained, glaring at Sherlock.
“One must not speculate without all of the facts.”
John threw up his hands. This was all becoming a little too real and too creepy. “You have
“Stop.”
“Yeah, things settled,” Robert said. “I didn’t feel like I was being followed, the noises and sightings stopped. It was calm … at first. But then, things had become very strained between me and Maria. She was consulting psychics, mediums, spending a lot of money. We fought a lot. I told her what Mr. Holmes said, that it was just apoph– apophenia. She wouldn't listen, she was really worried about our son.”
“I was solving mysteries even then. I used logic.”
“Okay, seriously. What the
Sherlock shoved long fingers through his curls, face pinched. “Because every bit of it defies the logic and science that define who I am and what I do. Because it’s a ridiculous mess that doesn’t deserve my attention. Because it’s a waste of time!”
This was the first time either had made actual conversation during their nighttime interludes. It roused John from his sightless staring. Sherlock dropped his violin and bow to his sides and stared out the window down onto Baker Street.
John took a moment to look at Sherlock—the reason he was there that day, the man he didn’t want to live without. Feeling John’s gaze, Sherlock turned his head, his expression of concentration softening for just a moment into a small smile. John turned and took his hand with one of his own, the other going up to the back of Sherlock’s neck. He pulled their heads together. “Stay safe out there. We have things to do after.”
Sherlock turns away from the window and keeps playing as he asks, “Better?”
Sherlock whirled around from his spot in front of the wall across the room, also covered with paper and string, clearly having been far enough in his own mind to not hear John enter, but aware enough to acknowledge a voice.
“He doesn't like me talking about him.”
“You’re saying you want to die.”
Sherlock ducked his head and stared at his mug, which was both unusual for him and adorable. John thought he saw a little flush on his cheeks too. Definitely adorable.
“What about what you did in the hospital?”
“Because you run away every time Sherlock and I even look at each other these days,” Eurus said dryly.
Sherlock has several files on his laptop dedicated to Rosie’s physical and mental development—charts with information from check-ups, lists of what she should be doing at a certain age, tests to give her. If John didn’t know better, he’d think Rosie was merely an experiment, a new puzzle that had caught his genius’s interest, but he’s seen the way he behaves around his daughter. There is pride when she learns new things and happiness when she reaches new milestones. Sherlock loves Rosie, and John’s never been happier.
“Then what about Victor?”
to see you, Sherlock. Good luck.” He reached across the table, but Sherlock moved his hand out of reach before they could touch.
“A need for attention.”
“You realize that’s how most people feel about you, right?”
“And how do we know any of what you say is true? The Order could be a bunch of nutjobs planning on standing in a Yorkshire field in November waiting for the second coming or whatever.”
“Well you look like death warmed over.”
“Or he’s overly suspicious or is attempting to throw us off,” Sherlock rebutted, hailing a cab.
Sorry for the delay in writing, mates. We were busy for a while with cases, travel, and visiting family. I’m back with another tale, though. And I think you’ll really like this one, it’s pretty creepy. We’re going to talk about Ouija boards and something called the ideomotor effect. Now, bear with me. I promise it’s more interesting than the name sounds.
John perked up. “What? Did he contact you?”
shown my drawings to anyone else. Not even my therapist. And …” he shuddered. “I’ve heard a young man’s voice say the same when I’m alone in my room. ‘I like your drawings.’”
“Alright?” John tried to make the connection to anything they’d talked about in the last hour. Was he worried about finding occult symbols scratched into John’s admittedly old and scuffed headboard? Maybe there was more danger in sleepwalking in the smaller space, with stairs right outside the bedroom door? Then he realized what Sherlock meant.
John frowned. “Was that meant to be a compliment?”
John was getting tired of these anonymous messages asking him to look into Sherlock’s past. It was always an internal struggle between his insatiable curiosity and his journalistic integrity. Sherlock was allowed to have a past he kept to himself. It wasn’t like John told him everything that had ever happened to him, so why should his friend be held to a different standard? But ever since Maddie’s murder, John knew the playing field had changed, and he needed to do his part to try to figure things out. But what was right these days? Keeping a past hidden and thus possibly missing an entire thread that could blow everything wide open and save lives, or revealing personal details on the internet to ask for help and thus possibly putting new people in danger. It was a no-win situation.
Maria shook her head.
John sat up, putting his elbows on his raised knees and rubbing his face. He looked at the clock. Five-fucking-thirty.
John saw the lights waver. Sherlock’s song was working! He tried to roll over, but a sharp pain in his wrist stopped him. Fuck, definitely broken. How had that happened? He didn’t remember much of the last five minutes (hours?), but whatever he’d done had worked. Eurus was working on the final symbol, Sherlock was most of the way through his song. He could relax and let them do the work now.
Sherlock shook his head. “There’s nothing to go on, nothing to see for anyone besides the one who claims to see it. You can’t disprove that.”
Sherlock had been a suspect, of course. He was the only one Victor knew in the tiny town they’d stopped in. But he was cleared in only a few days, and the blame had been put on a drifter that had been in the area. And that had been it.
“She does short stories mostly. Stuff you’d find in literary journals and anthologies. She’s not really into the mass market scene.”
If I die, I’ve asked Mike to post this on 7
Sherlock squinted and shrugged. “The leader. Sized larger to show his higher status.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock was elbow-deep in the advice columns he found so deeply amusing. His toast was clamped between his teeth, forgotten. John smiled.
Sherlock waved his hand dismissively. “The perceived connection between unrelated things. It's the mind's need to make sense of random events. To create patterns no matter how spurious the connection. It's what makes people believe they hear demonic voices when playing certain rock albums backwards. Or what makes the sport fan convinced that a ritual they do can affect the outcome of the game.”
“Or you came along, started digging into old cases, and found connections where they don’t exist. And now your blog is bringing more of the crazies out of the woodwork.”
But I can’t help but see connections in so much of what I’m learning these days. All of these cases, the emails you all send me, it seems like I hear about something new to me, and then within a few weeks I’ve heard about it three more times. Sherlock says I’m reading too much into it. That of course paranormal cases have similar threads running through them—that’s because they’re still unexplained phenomena.
“What do you think?” John asked when he was done.
“Oh. Good.” John wasn’t sure how he felt about this. He was glad there was a least one mystery done with, one less thing to distract and distress Sherlock. But at the same time, there was this little ball of jealousy that formed in his stomach any time Victor was mentioned.
“What made you go into this field?” John asked. It was something that had been on his mind since they met.
“I thought I’d come back and haunt you.” John swiveled in his chair to face his partner, careful not to jar his injured wrist.
John had to agree it didn’t seem to be the way Sherlock normally worked. He’d had months to watch his friend do his detecting thing, and while he did a lot of mind work the rest of the world couldn’t comprehend, there wasn’t this instinctive homing thing. Sherlock was just really good at putting together disparate information.
“You’re a war correspondent. Seen lots of nasty things. Terrible things. Frightening things.”
They pulled off the side of the road and waited for Simon. John got out of the car. If he was going to be forced to drive four hours from home, he was going to get some pretty pictures out of it. For once he was glad Harry had given him an expensive phone with a camera.
“How many scarlet files are there?” John asked, getting back on track.
Well,
“What men?”
“Yes, very good.”
John shook himself free of his thoughts. “Hmm?”
“What? With whom? Hopefully not the new sergeant working under Lestrade. She’s in the closet.”
“Your followers are conspiracy nuts and readers who enjoy adding unnecessary drama to an otherwise cut-and-dry story. All they’ll do is come up with more out-of-this-world explanations.”
Sherlock gave him his patented
John nodded, though his stomach twisted. He decided to get back to their original topic. “So, you think your mum had something to do with you and Sherlock seeing the tall men, but you don’t know what. What else can you tell me about your … gifts?”
“You too,” Sherlock said lowly before returning the kiss.
Sherlock stared out the window in silence, picked up his violin, and started screeching on it the way he did when Mycroft visited. John nodded to the kitchen. He and Eurus went through and closed the doors.
“You’re correct,” Simon said. “I could have sent you pictures. This site is not relevant to the Order of the Cenophus’s current goals.”
“Mr. Watson.” She stood away from the front door of 221 Baker Street to let John in. “You’re early.”
Sherlock froze in his seat, but he didn’t back away from the microscope. “I told you why I started my investigations. I wanted to share the truth with people.”
Maria turned the laptop to face her again, her expression sour. “Does it look like a child would draw it?”
Sherlock shrugged and looked away. “Oh, the usual things that kids get curious about, most of which had utterly mundane answers, much to my disappointment.”
Where is he?
“Should she be?” John asks with eyebrows raised as they enter the flat.
“John,” she admonished, her tone
“There are no tall men, John. It was a fantasy. Make believe. And I–” Sherlock cut himself off with a grunt.
“Yeah, his words exactly. It was creepy, but not the first time the mistake had been made. This happened all the time. Appliances turning on, random banging noises, I can't tell you the amount of times people thought I was with somebody when I was clearly alone.”
“No. The drawings were written on the walls, and they were more symbols than your usual art.” John retrieved a few pictures Fred had emailed him and slid them in front of Sherlock. They showed a white wall covered in black crayon or chalk—lots of numbers and symbols, the largest and most central a pentagram in a double circle.
John took a deep breath. Was he really going to do this? “Fine. I’ll listen.”
“He knows my record with the police is ninety-five percent solved. He knows I can find Sammy.” And it was true. The man could have easily been a detective, and John wondered yet again how Sherlock had ended up here instead.
Sherlock nodded and typed out their order on his phone. He really did prefer to text. Then he sat across from John in his own chair. “What is it?”
Holmes siblings. Should I expect any more to pop up? A hang-gliding, crossword-puzzle-solving cousin perhaps?”
“As if I didn’t learn to pick locks, same as you, darling.”
“Just like that, you’re offering me a place to stay, even though we barely know each other?” John stared at him in disbelief.
John shrugged. “You hired me to be your assistant. That’s what I am, with a side of popular blog to boost our ratings.”
“Forever?”
“I just don't see anything supernatural about any of this. As a journalist, I'd like to think your mind would be a little bit less … pliable.”
“I said: BORED.”
“A few months after the first event.”
“So, what about the class photo?” John asked later over sushi. Maria had emailed the few pictures of Sammy she’d kept after the strange events began in earnest—most of which she’d burned when the shadow kept popping up in them, just as they had with Robert when he was a child. One was Sammy’s class picture, shadow firmly in place to the side.
They waved each other off with promises to stay in touch. John returned to his dull flat to see what the rest of the day held.
They watched the activity for a time. They couldn’t go in until the ceremony had begun, or the Order would find a way to stop them. Their approach must be precisely timed to even have a chance at succeeding.
“Yes, Mother.”
“Alright then, Sherlock.” John tried to focus his thoughts. He was here for an interview, not to moon over some man, no matter how fascinating or intelligent (or handsome) he was. He cleared his throat. “So that’s what you do? You go to the site of a haunting or whatever, and you figure it out like you did me?”
CW for a gory explanation of an off-scene death and for mention of John’s state of mind before he met Sherlock.
“Please, call me John.”
In which John and Eurus become friends,  Mycroft makes a very brief appearance, and Sherlock finds Victor.
“Three events with the same symbology. There is no way this is a coincidence.” John frowned back. That earned him a sigh, but no reply. He watched Sherlock continue studying the walls.
“The cave paintings.”
John sighed. “I just thought it was fair that my readers had all of the information. There has to be more to his disappearance than you think, if someone felt the need to tell me about it. This way I have people out there thinking things through to come up with an answer.”
The sun had come out from behind the clouds, and a small but bright stream of light filtered through one of the window shutter cracks. The light sat perfectly in the center of a ring of drawn symbols, and it was in the shape of a cross.
Sherlock’s face grew harder and his back straighter the longer Simon talked. His hands were clenched so tightly the knuckles and the tendons were stark white. “You’re wrong. My abilities are my own. I earned them through practice and learning.”
“Is it really so difficult to believe? I didn’t tell you who Mycroft was the first time he kidnapped you. He and I wouldn’t even be on speaking terms if he didn’t track my every move. He tracks hers, too, and keeps each of us informed if anything monumental happens to the other, but that’s our only contact these days.”
Eurus continued staring at Sherlock. “When did you listen to the Unsound?”
, but he doubted that’s what it was.
John didn’t agree, but nothing he said would change Sherlock’s mind. It was one thing to be able to debunk obviously fake reports of the paranormal, but this was someone grasping at straws to avoid what was plain to see: something strange was going on with the Hochmans, and real-world reasons wouldn’t be able to solve it. He left it alone for a while, focusing back on his investigations.
“Bloody mother fucking hell,” he muttered, rubbing his face.
“Three years and I don’t even get a hello. Love you too, Brother.”
“I don’t know …”
he liked Sherlock. Admitting the best friend part had been hard enough. He wasn’t about to give away his last secret. Not when the object of his affection was a self-proclaimed sociopath who was married to his work. And especially not when John’s own sexuality was something he kept close to the vest. The challenges of being out had driven Harry to drink. He wasn’t going to let the same thing happen to him. Maybe if Sherlock was– But no. He wasn’t outing himself just for the hell of it.
, rather than away from. You love lording it over everyone else when you prove something is a fake. If this particular trip is a waste of time, then so is your whole life!” John cringed. That came out wrong. He tried to backpedal. “No. Shit, no, Sherlock. I didn’t mean–”
“It’s fine, Sherlock.” John didn’t know what he’d do if Sherlock apologized about his slip up. He knew that Sherlock had realized his state of mind when they first met. He also knew that Sherlock, despite his careless and unfeeling attitude, didn’t mean to bring up such a delicate subject.
“No, we need to stop everything.”
“No. But your body language and tone of voice don’t seem terribly happy at the idea of us moving in.”
“Marie Simone, of course.”
“Penny for your thoughts.”
Sherlock whipped around to face John. “What?”
“And why are you suddenly so willing to help us?” Sherlock squinted at him suspiciously. “Did you have a change of heart? Did you see the light?” His tone was mocking.
“More fucking tall men,” he muttered. “Why isn’t this video with the Torres file? It might be a different person, but it’s the same thing.”
“What?”
“The symbols, most of them are Ancient Sumerian, with some mentions to the Tower of Marduk, the national god of Babylon. Odd. Perhaps he was looking for something foreign and that’s what popped up on his internet search.”
Eurus’s phone pinged before she could reply, and her face lit up. She put up a finger as she answered the call.
…” Sherlock’s tone was defeated.
John leaned so their shoulders touched. Sherlock relaxed a little. “He did this often?” John asked. He lifted his mug only to realize it was already empty. He’d need to start a line to send the tea straight to his veins soon. He was getting more sleep, so he didn’t need the caffeine, but the tea made him feel more human.
“Us?”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched. Beyond his outburst earlier that day, it was the first emotion John had seen from him in nearly a week. “If it really was Victor, he had to know that asking me to not look means I will instead turn over every stone trying to find him. If it’s really Victor, that means he actually wants me to find him but can’t say so.”
Sherlock buried his head in a forensics journal and didn’t surface until after John had left the table to go shower.
“You shouldn't have opened that,” the girl remonstrated.
“Bath. Some cave paintings near a field known for pagan and occult meetings.”
“Right. Yeah. Mike. Of course.” Mike hadn’t been the best journalist in their class, but he’d been a decent study partner and mate. There were worse people to run into. John tried to look friendly. “How are you?”
Sherlock doubled down on his point, but John could tell it was partially from guilt. He’d been there before himself.
“And Harry …”
Holmes’s mouth twitched minutely. “Not exactly. No. Come on up.” He whirled around and headed through the door. John followed.
Was it John’s imagination, or did the man relax a little?
too many. But a couple of them, along with people who
“Those were his words? ‘The tall man?’”
Before John could argue further, Sherlock whirled around, grabbed a file from his desk, and marched back to his room, slamming his door shut.
“Joys of being a writer. I can take a holiday whenever I like, as long as I have enough money to keep eating and don’t owe my editor new stuff.”
“Why don’t you and Sherlock keep in touch?”
A nurse hurried into the room. She looked scared. “Dr. Barnes! It’s Trent. He– a seizure. His
, John thought, remembering one of the symbols he’d seen repeated at different locations over the past year. They looked dazed, like they were sleepwalking. John glanced at Sherlock’s face, worried he’d be pulled in too, but it was clear and determined. He went back to watching the scene unfold in front of him as Sherlock bent to pull out his instrument from the case.
John moved to stand between the two rooms while he waited for the kettle to boil. Eurus sprawled in Sherlock’s chair. She’d traded her coat for a thick, long jumper and her boots for matching wool socks. “Why’s it so cold in here?”
John smiled. “Well, you're talking about him with me.”
John shook himself free of his musings. “What?”
The camera swung around the porch. “Where?”
“Shit.”
“My former assistant has no bearing–”
“Sherlock is the strongest psychic the Order has ever seen. He will be the key.”
“I can take care of myself.”
John cleared his throat. “Both, actually. Your name is an oft-spoken one in the paranormal community. After the third mention of you during some of my interviews, I looked you up. Found your website,
John saw pale eyes glance at the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet, but before he could ask, Mrs. Hudson entered the room looking both exasperated and fond. “Did you put the doorbell in the freezer again, Sherlock? There’s a package you need to sign for downstairs.”
Sherlock, who had just come into the kitchen from his bedroom, where he’d been spending most of his time lately, grunted but didn’t enquire as to the reason for John’s expletive.
“I … wanted to control the narrative as much as possible. As you say, my followers tend toward the conspiracy theorists.
“No.”
“I always thought you threw a wobbly over Mycroft because he’s a nosy git and just plain annoying, but Eurus is a perfectly fine person. So, it’s not Mycroft that upsets you, it’s me talking to your siblings. Paying attention to
John wrinkled his brow. Interesting how Eurus was so much more up front about everything. He wished he’d found her earlier. Maybe his investigations would be further along than they were.
While the geniuses conferred over John’s head, he went to peruse the cave paintings. They didn’t quite match the Bath paintings, but the idea seemed similar. The same black stick figures were present. But instead of them facing one taller figure, they faced a group of hills or large rocks or something, connected by lines—like a conspiracy theorist connected events with string. On the other side of these humps was a large dark circle—perhaps a hole in the ground? Or another cave? Coming out of the darkness were tall figures, all wearing the upside down face John was growing weary of seeing.
That silence was finally broken when John received an email from a Wendy Hochman in Germany. She’d said that she’d contacted Sherlock almost a year ago, and he’d dismissed her story without even a call or visit. A check through Sherlock’s email folder showed she had indeed emailed Sherlock and he had replied with his usual workplace charm—that is to say, none. It turned out she had recently begun reading John’s blog after a friend noticed similarities between Sammy’s circumstances and those of her toddler son, Kurt. She was asking John to look into her case.
Sherlock cocks his head, but the frown of frustration melts from his face. “What do you mean?”
sound ethereal (or was it occult?) in nature.
In which John runs into Stamford, gets a job, despairs over his job, and meets a very intriguing (and handsome) paranormal investigator.
John conceded that with a head tilt. It would be nice to have a less skeptical version of Sherlock’s genius brain hanging around. “So you’re staying in town after the workshop is over?”
It’s not that John had expected Sherlock to divulge every childhood friend just because they were flatmates, but he was annoyed at himself for missing this story, huge as it was in making Sherlock who he was as an adult.
“Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”
Sherlock looked affronted. “Of course. Some people who aren't geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others. You are one of those people. It’s nothing to scoff at. It’s a rare enough talent, and I’ve found it helpful a number of times.”
The common denominator in all of John’s scenarios, though, was that they were all single Events. There was a Moment, and after that Moment, they knew what they were to each other, and there was nothing left to resolve. There was a minute where they were friends, and there was a minute after when they were Together. But when John thought about it, how it ended up happening in reality was very Sherlockian. In cases, the way things usually went was that there was a problem stated, they talked about it a bit, Sherlock went off to his mind palace, he made decisions and acted on them without consulting John, a lot of things happened that John had to react to because he had no fucking clue what was going on, then the case was done,
“Huh.”
“The children.”
Eurus shrugged and sipped her tea. “Mmm, masala. How very seasonal of you, John. I can do research. I’m shite at cooking, but I make killer scones.” She waved a hand in that Sherlockian (Holmesian?) way. “Whatever you need.”
Eurus chuckled. “Maybe.” She stared at her brother a moment longer, then turned to John. “How
“Two years ago.”
In which the boys go on a bit of a scavenger hunt, meet up with Simon, and learn more about the upcoming apocalypse.
John glanced at Sherlock, who tilted his head but said nothing, before looking back at the screen. “You said you were working alone, so what friend was he talking about?”
“Oh, Sherlock.” Victor looked both pitying and fondly exasperated. “You were the strongest they’d ever seen. Eurus had good potential, but she grew out of it, as some do.” He checked his watch. “I have to go. It’s not safe for us to be seen together. Look, please. Just stop the investigations. Maybe take a holiday, get away from this mess.” He stood up. “Stay here for another five minutes, then head out. It was … it was
John pinched the bridge of his nose, tired of arguing already, but continuing nonetheless. “Sherlock. This
“If that’s the last of the theatrics, we’ll be on our way,” Sherlock said dully, his face impassive.
John raised his hands placatingly.
Sherlock’s eyes glittered with interest. “Go on.”
“Hello?”
Not breaking stride, Sherlock handed over a slip of paper, which gave a set of cross streets. He was already checking the map on his phone by the time John looked up from the paper.
The girl paused. “They're here now.
John stopped just inside the door, watching the landlady prepare tea (not the housekeeper indeed) as Sherlock hummed but otherwise continued to ignore them. As the kettle clicked off, his head shot up. “Oh, John!” He twisted in his seat, his eyes widening, and John gave a small nod.
They moved down to Sherlock’s room that night. As John sleepily made his way to the bathroom, Sherlock offhandedly announced from the desk—where he was four folders deep into some unknown research—that his ridiculously posh sheets were clean. John, not wanting to ruin the moment by actually acknowledging anything, hummed vaguely, went to brush his teeth, then climbed into Sherlock’s (their?) bed. He slid smoothly over said ridiculously posh sheets and snuggled under the covers with a smile.
“What?” John said.
“Exactly.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock pulled out his phone and started taking pictures.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was soft as he approached John. “Please. Leave. I need– I can’t–” He shook his head in what looked like defeat.
“By what means did he make that claim? I thought he didn’t speak.”
John shrugged. “Who knows. Maybe you’d have inspired me to write even as a doctor.” He shook his head and went back to studying the walls. “So. Thoughts?”
“You really didn’t need to come,” John tried to convince her as she doctored her tea. He put the tray on the coffee table and sat next to Sherlock. When he looked up from his own cup, her face had lost the usual “I’m quirky and mischievous!” expression. She looked serious.
The wall wasn’t black, it was painted in
“Cross my heart.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Putting his big nose where it doesn’t belong. Hopefully he’ll get eaten.”
With a huge sigh, Sherlock pushed himself all the way up. “Fine. It’s extremely dull though. Your readers will hate it.”
John huffed a laugh and opened his arms. “How about a hug?”
“Because ninety-three percent of the time, it’s just idiotic charlatans, hoping to make some money or gain some followers or whatever it is humans enjoy having more of. Five percent of the time, it’s something like apophenia or the ideomotor effect. Two percent of the time, science is not sufficiently advanced enough to explain.” Sherlock slide his hand from John’s shoulder down his arm before drawing away to go perform his overwhelmed Regency heroine act on the sofa. His dressing gown fluttered as he landed. John was fairly certain he practiced to get it just right.
“And filing finished cases away in a file cabinet?” John asked, attempting to steer the conversation back to the red folders he’d seen earlier. It was the second time he’d mentioned them since they’d left the flat hours before, his determination far from flagging despite the evening’s excitement.
“We’ve got it covered, Eurus. It’s fine,” he said.
“Tea, dear?”
“It’s a common enough theme in music and literature, John,” Sherlock replied with a longsuffering, pained face.
“What? No.”
“Research. Sherlock’s not the only Holmes with a mythology degree. And I’m less likely to pass off everything I can’t explain as fake.”
“Is that the only time that happened?”
“He was about fifteen when it happened. There was a teen who went missing in our village, which, given how small of a community it was, was strange. So he, being the paranormal investigator he’s always been, decided to find him. It took less than an hour for him to find the body. It was by the river, with some weird symbols and ritual-looking objects surrounding the kid.”
John glared right back. “No. It was sent anonymously with no explanation. I watched it, didn’t understand why it was sent to me, so I showed you. Now, what’s Glushka?”
“I’ve been studying sacred geometry and the cave paintings. I have a fairly good idea of their plans.”
Three weeks later, John received an email from Dabic himself, or at least one from his email address. It contained a song file and nothing else. It wasn’t anything John had heard, so he shared it with Sherlock.
Maria leaned into the screen. “I’m sorry, Mr. Watson. Sammy has a doctor’s appointment.”
“Sounds like Sherlock.”
“Your mum?” he asked her.
“All those sound files you received, supposedly from Keith Dabic? You posted them to your blog.”
Sherlock still lay with his arm dramatically thrown across his face. John watched him as he said his next words. “Simon wants to meet.”
They climbed to the first floor, which looked a bit like the aftermath of a tornado. Books and folders littered every free space. They were stacked haphazardly on shelves and tables, along with VHS tapes, two televisions, three laptops, numerous electronic equipment John couldn’t name, and even some floppy discs. A desk was buried under more paraphernalia, watched over by a cow skull wearing headphones.
John’s draw dropped. “In five years?”
“Three.”
Sherlock stalked out of the room, and John heard his bedroom door slam. He sighed. He knew Sherlock was a bit touchy about being different, even though he pretended to revel in it. And John truly hadn’t meant it the way it sounded. His hackles always seemed to go up when he and Sherlock tried to talk about anything other than a case. They both got defensive far too easily. It didn’t bother John that Sherlock didn’t date. He seemed content with his work, and that was fine with John. But he just got annoyed when Sherlock made it seem like he was better than everyone else for it.
“Oh?”
“Do you think his disappearance is connected?”
John laughed.
“Like, actual math?”
“Thank you for showing us, Maria,” John interrupted before another argument could develop. “Was there anything else you wanted to show us?”
“Dear God, no. It’s Eurus, and you’re John, and we’re going to be friends.”
“Hey! You can’t do that!” Trent lunged for Sherlock but wasn’t quick enough.
“There's nobody there. Look.”
Eurus is just a normal kid in this universe. Well, mostly. You’ll see. But she’s not a psychopath or evil. I just needed a younger sibling for Sherlock, and she was available for the job. She promises to behave. ;)
They smiled goofily at each other for a minute, then John looked away, afraid his face would show just
“If we can stop even some of the children’s deaths, it’d be worth it,” John argued.
“Same symbols as Simon’s?”
John smiles. “Much.” He scratches the back of his neck. “And… thank you. I’m sorry for just passing her over and hiding, but–”
he expected? It was quiet, and the pitch was both high and low, kind of like far off horns. It
“Sherlock?”
. I am using quite a few direct quotes (or nearso) from the show in this chapter, because it’s way creepier than I could ever hope to be, but I won’t do this on every case they investigate. I just wanted to give you a sense of how the investigations would work.
“And after?”
“You think– I’m not– No, she’s nice and funny and tells me all about you. That’s all.”
In which they interview a mysterious young man with possible paranormal powers.
Marie started asking her questions. When she got to “Are you the fallen Brother Ivan?” Sherlock paused the video.
“Indistinguishable from magic, yeah. I’ve read Clarke. But I’m okay with humans having myths when technology hasn’t advanced enough yet, okay? Let me have my stories.”
Maybe it’s John who is closing the gap. He closes his eyes and forces the words out this time. “Kiss you?”
“Someone left a URL for it on John’s blog. The Unsound post.”
“You’re certain you were alone?” John asked. Robert nodded. “How can you be sure?”
“Huh. I guess you calmed me before I could wake myself.” Of course, in stories where love conquered all, just having a loved one in bed made the nightmares disappear completely, but reality was different. What surprised John was that Sherlock had managed to calm him at all. Then he remembered his own waking from the night.
Sherlock was still staring outside when John brought their mugs into the lounge and joined him at the window.
“He’s J–”
John crossed his arms. “Bloody hell, Simon. Spit it out.”
“Wow, they sound like real winners.”
November. Of course, if we die tomorrow, the world may not exist on 7
John was surprised to hear the apology. Sherlock didn’t seem like the type to apologize. But he looked genuinely contrite, as if he’d caused the events himself.
“It wasn’t me!” Despite the accusation, John squirmed back into position under the blanket next to Sherlock, who put an arm around him (to maximize sharing of body warmth, of course).
“Victor. I know where he is.”
But this board isn’t any old Ouija board you’d find in the store or your nan’s attic. Not even something you’d see from the 1890s, held in a museum somewhere. This board doesn’t let you contact spirits. It contacts demons. We can’t see from the tape what it was that scared the professor so much. But I do know this. The woman I spoke to who was at the séance said that she glimpsed it for just a moment when she took off her blindfold. It was tall and it was dark. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Did they contact a spirit? Was she just seeing black spots because she’d taken off her blindfold and was upset by the professor’s exclamation? Who knows. But you gotta admit, it’s a bit strange how all of Sherlock’s Scarlet Files end up seemingly connected.

“No, of course not. This was just an investigation into strange noises in a child’s room. Nothing—supposedly—sinister.” He sighed and rubbed his forehead. “I guess I was wrong about that.”
John glanced over at him. The euphoric interest that had been on his face was gone. He looked thoroughly chastised now. John hoped it was a true feeling and not an act to sway him.
“Apparently he’s talking now. And he’s now confessed to his parents’ murders as well.” John shrugged. He was baffled by the whole thing and really hoped Sherlock could come up with a logical explanation.
Anderson sighed. “Fine, yes, he found evidence that the owner of the hotel could
Sherlock leaned over to see John’s phone screen. “Open the door then.”
She glared and raised a hand to silence her brother. “I know, I didn’t think much of it either, but something John said today made me read through the comments again on the way over just now, and I found it. The countdown ends the first of November.”
“They have spies everywhere, Sher. I can’t say too much.”
John huffed a laugh. “I suppose you’re right.”
“Right. Yes.” They moved back in front of John’s laptop on the sofa. “Let’s continue?” said Sherlock.
In which Halloween is avoided, they go to Bath for the final showdown, Eurus makes ick faces when the boys get mushy, and they somehow avert the apocalypse.
“And will you be able to not let
“Is Rosie ill?” he asks with a frown. He takes a babbling Rosie from John and feels her forehead.
John narrowed his eyes. “Why would I need to do that?”
“Sherlock will kill me,” he pleaded. “He doesn’t want to see you. He doesn’t want to believe any of this is real. You should have seen him when we met up with Victor. He freaked out.”
to do something right then, he would have to work for it. So he waited, lying on his back, eyes closed, duvet heavy on top of him.

investigate eventually. I need to know if it’s connected too.”
“It’s a portal, isn’t it?” John asked Sherlock, who’d come to stand next to him again, and John thought he could feel warmth even through their layers.
“But the Order is. Plus, they’re children. They can be convinced they’re doing something great and wonderful.” Simon smiled softly. It was creepy.
John shrugged and followed him into the vehicle. The trip was less than ten minutes, but when they’d reached it, a seemingly clumsy tourist bumped into John and left him with another paper with another intersection named on it. This one was across the city. When they finally arrived, they were met by a man who strongly suggested they follow him into a nearby back alley and through an unmarked, rusted door. The building seemed to be abandoned, the only furniture being the three chairs in the room the man led them to, one chair already occupied.
November, but I’m trying to be optimistic here. I sure as hell hope it exists—for you all, my readers, who have stuck with us through a
“I know what to look for, John,” Sherlock explained when John shared his frustration with him one morning over breakfast. “Don’t forget that not only have I been doing this for years, but I have three degrees. I was just as lost as you when I started out.”
“Simon Reese has gone missing.”
“To do what?”
“Seven, but I don’t like to theorize ahead of the data, so I’ll wait to explain once we know more.”
“I …,” Sherlock began, drawing out the sound. “I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.”
“No! They just appeared one day.”
Both men froze, and Eurus laughed. “You two share a job and a flat. You’ve recently figured out you sleepwalk, Sher, so I’m guessing you share a bed.”
“Apocalypse.”
“Mmm?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed through his nose. John tried not to laugh.
, as he named the tome.
“Needs must,” Sherlock rumbled from next to John in the booth of a diner they’d been sitting in for an hour, waiting for the third member of their party to show.
“This could be a case as simple as a conspiracy theory, but,” she held up her hand to stop John from arguing, “not your theory, or even any of your fans. I’ve been looking into the Order of the Cenophus this week. I don’t know where I personally land on how real the paranormal is—I’ll leave that to my dear brother—but the Order members definitely
She nodded wearily. “Right. What did he say about it?”
“And the more we know, the better prepared we’ll be. We should meet with him.”
“If you die, I

was creepy. John ignored the chill up his spine and continued the questioning. “Tall Paul? Who is that?”
“This way.”
“If I’m there, he’s there, yeah. And we can’t bring anyone else in. It’s too dangerous.”
“Me. I say.” Sherlock dropped onto the bed next to John. “I don’t like having my life displayed for the world to gossip about.”
Sherlock slumped back against the sofa and rubbed his face. “Just being in the same room as her for ten minutes is exhausting.” John chortled, and Sherlock opened his eyes to glare at John. “What?”
John hid a smirk behind his hand. It was a trick when someone else did it, but pure intellect and observation when Sherlock did the same.
“He said he could see me working in my office from the second floor, directly across the courtyard from my office. He said he saw two of us in my office, me and ‘the tall man.’”
“What makes you think I’d live?”
November, but that he and I and a friend will live to see 2
“Oh right. Oh!” That would’ve been soon after Victor’s disappearance. “Yeah. Okay. Sorry.”
“I can’t … I need you to … I don’t want to go alone.”
“No, that’s what I do for
I did. I just wanted to let you know how persuasive Eurus can be. She made me think it was all real, that all the strange phenomena our mother talked about was actually true. She had me convinced I had … powers.” He turned to look at John with a serious expression. “I need to warn you, for when you talk to her.”
Sherlock frowned in thought, then shook his head. John lifted his mug to take a sip of tea, then realized it was empty. He decided to get more later and kept reading instead.
“Robert called me twenty minutes ago. He went missing after school yesterday afternoon. Went into the toilet at three forty-seven and never came out. One small, high window was the only egress apart from the door to the hallway, where a teacher waited for him.”
John knew it was a respite, that they’d be spurred into action again soon whether they liked it or not, so he savored those quiet, easy days. He made himself a mind cupboard, where he neatly stacked memories on shelves—Sherlock playing his violin, mocking the television, heavily marking up forensic journals to send back to the editors; the two of them giggling over dumb stories in the paranormal world; Mrs. Hudson smiling softly at them across the table as they took tea with her. One day, he simply stood in the sitting room and closed his eyes so he could take in the sounds and smells of their flat—dust, chemicals, buttery popcorn from a film marathon the evening before, cars wooshing down the street, Mrs. Hudson hoovering downstairs, Sherlock muttering while angrily tapping at his keyboard (probably debunking another myth on a message board).
“And you’ll show me one of these … scarlet files to me?”
“Still …”
Sherlock waved a hand. “So I’m meant to prove he didn’t teleport?”
Eyes glassy, Sherlock nodded again. “I need to … think.” He rose from his chair and headed to his violin.
Sherlock nods, but he still looks a bit confused. He adjusts, though, and the day is spent happily. They stay the night, and Sherlock doesn’t question it. John feels the same contentedness and peace he did last time they stayed over.
She nodded. “To be expected. I’m assuming everything in your blog has dredged up some buried feelings too.”
“Around the time he was looking into your case, something changed, didn't it?” John continued.
“What abou–” Sherlock stopped himself in realization, then looked at John in frustration. “Oh. John, it’s just a stylistic preference. Perhaps he was wearing a mask.”
Resigned, Sherlock said, “I’ll get you her email address.”
Simon shrugged. “You must admit that stories have power.”
In which nightmares are discussed, everybody bickers, bedswapping happens, and Sherlock makes a decision about the apocalypse.
Simon tilted his head. “Mr. Holmes. Mr. Watson. Thank you for joining me. You want to ask me about the drawings.”
“Who says I'm following him? Sammy, is Tall Paul in your kitchen with you right now?” Sherlock’s eyes were narrowed.
“What oh?” Sherlock stood and walked behind John’s chair to read over his shoulder. He bent over enough that John felt breath on the back of his neck. He closed his eyes, suppressed a shudder, and gulped.
Eurus smiled softly. “I’m glad he has you, John. He needs someone to see him for real. But no, that’s not what I’m talking about. I’ve seen him do that, and I understand how he comes to his conclusions. But this was different. We were hanging out in our back garden when we heard the news from a neighbor kid. No one knew much. The teen just disappeared one afternoon after school, no clues as to where he went. I saw Sherlock going on alert, saw the gears turn. But there was something else. It’s like he was listening to a radio in his head. He said he needed to find the missing boy, then stood up. Victor and I followed him through the house and out the front door, where he stood on the steps for a while, eyes closed. Then he said, ‘I know where he is,’ and headed down the pavement toward the edge of town. He would stop from time to time and close his eyes, then adjust his direction and start walking again. Within an hour, we came upon the body. I’d never seen him do that before, John. This wasn’t how he usually deduced things.”
“I just … I want the things that happen around me to have meaning. To not be just random happenstance or a weird coincidence. I need to believe in something.”
John shrugged. “You did say she was
Eurus hummed. “I would say, better you than me, but I apparently will reap the ‘benefits’ of living with Sherlock now too.”
John turned to Eurus, who backed up a step. “No kisses for me, please.”
Sherlock scoffed when John showed him the sound file, saying that after Maddie had learned why John was asking after the Hochmans, she’d made the recording. John argued that the recording was from before John had interviewed Maddie, after which Sherlock said that “obviously,” Maddie was just a trouble-maker and she’d been the creator of all of the weirdness that had Wendy freaked out.
“We’d like to ask you a few questions.”
“Eurus is back in Glasgow,” Sherlock called, rosining up his bow.
“Ah, a new case of ‘teleportation’?” After a wave at his plate from John, Sherlock picked up his fork and took a bite, then dug in. He loved curry when he actually deigned to eat it.
“Seriously?” John felt his blood pressure rise. The man had some nerve.
John grimaced. He’d seen some pretty gruesome things in the Middle East, but most of the violence wasn’t self-inflicted, apart from suicide bombers.
And so he ends up at the newly renovated Baker Street—Rosie clutched in one arm, overnight bag in the other—unsure if he’ll be welcomed, but hopeful none-the-less. Sherlock has always welcomed them before. John hopes he hasn’t imagined that Sherlock is more than welcoming, actually; he hopes Sherlock is happy they are there.
“It’s like you said. We humans want there to be a connection. We want to find meaning in this crazy world.”
“Seeing the tall men was about it for me. Sherlock, though, he … knew things,” Eurus mused, playing with her silverware.
“Mmmm.”
The word is small. Small but hopeful.
“You’re certain Sherlock actually saw them? That he wasn’t just playing along for your sake?”
“What?” Sherlock’s bright eyes turned on John. “Who?”
Sherlock studied them for a few moments. “Why are there two pictures of the same– oh. No.
Simon sighed. “Where you not listening to me at all at Nether Edge?”
Sherlock spent a few minutes with his magnifier down on his hands and knees, looking at every inch of the room, before sighing dramatically at the lack of evidence and asking to see Trent’s room.
John woke abruptly when something dropped on his legs. He squinted at his phone. “Four-forty, really, Sherlock? What the
“Wales. Three days. I’ll send coordinates and time.” The line clicked before John could even react.
“I had it in the bag, then that arrogant prat Holmes had to throw a wobbly and claim that it was faked.”
John hummed. “Is that why she could see the tall men? Because she’s sensitive?”
As soon as the door downstairs banged shut, Sherlock smiled widely, jumped in the air, and raised his fists. “Oh, it’s Christmas. A fresh victim
He was back to being in a good mood by the time the cab rounded the corner to his block of flats. He was getting ready to offer his goodbyes when the smell of smoke and something in his peripheral vision caught his eye.
He holds degrees in mythology, psychology and forensic pathology from Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London. He had promising career opportunities in all of those fields, but instead he decided to devote himself to debunking the supernatural, offering that huge reward to anyone who could best his methods. Many have tried, but few have succeeded.
Sorry for rambling. Things have just been a little weird lately. I promise a better post next week. I’ve got quite a story to tell. Until then, I remain your intrepid journalist—or blogger, or whatever I am now—John Watson.
ride. You deserve for the world to continue as it has been, people being born, and people dying, laughter and love and sex and parties and books and art and everything that’s come to signify humanity.
. But there was neither word from nor sight of the eldest Holmes sibling. So, they were on their own. Even Simon had gone radio silent; who knew of they’d ever see or hear from him again, now that they doing his work for him.
“Obsessive?”
He waved his bow about, then positioned it to return to playing. “God knows. The usual things he does. Rule the world, stop and start small wars, keep eldritch horrors from rising from the deep. You know, government stuff.”
John pinched her arm and backed away. “Arse.”
She sat the laptop on the kitchen table and went to get Sammy from where he was playing in the backyard. They returned, and the boy sat in front of the laptop, Maria next to him.
