Tony thought firmly, shaking his head.
"Oh I'm sure he would have tried, but would he have been able to is the real question, hmm?" The general waved a dismissive hand, turning to pour himself another generous shot of the whisky. His back was only turned for a few seconds, but it was still long enough for Steve to sneak a glance at the pad of paper sitting near the edge of the large round table. The paper was blank, but with the way the sunlight was streaming in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, Steve could just barely make out the imprint of two words left behind from the torn off pages.
"Hey, Buck?"
"But what difference does a year make, really?" Peter demanded. "I mean, is there really such a huge difference between seventeen and eighteen? I know you and Dad seem to think so, but then your ma used to let you walk all over Brooklyn by yourself when you were four, so—"
"JARVIS, find me the power source."
"Hmm, maybe because it's specifically designed to cushion my body during flight while at the same time not interfere with the armour?" Tony said, rather cheekily. "And maybe also because I happen to be aware of how much you might like it on me?"
Especially while being tailed with a security regimen that would rival that of any President or other head of state’s child.
And Tony always responded with, "We shall."
"Oh, Christ," Tony breathed, his knees nearly buckling in relief.
Steve lifted his head, clenching his jaw. "Scott Lang."
Colonel Phillips shifted on his feet, jerking his head towards the infusion setup. "What you can see over there, gentlemen, is the only dose of the super-soldier serum currently in existence," he said. "But it wasn't one that was left over. Howard only finished manufacturing this dose about two weeks ago."
"And how in the hell are we gonna do that?" demanded Rhodey. "I used up almost all of my ammo on the first—!"
"Nah, bud, Papa's gonna be okay," Dad said as he sat down on the bed. "He heals pretty fast, remember? His burns should be a lot better by tomorrow, and he's grounded from flying for the next three days so his eyes will have plenty of time to heal."
With a triumphant huff, Thanos released Peter, who immediately collapsed into a heap on the ground, his legs as weak as a newborn baby's as he sucked the stale air into his starved lungs. Not even a second later Dad was at his side, pulling Peter into his lap and hugging him close.
"I don't want you coming out here without Steve today, Dad," Peter warned. "I haven't seen him in three days 'cause he was afraid he'd run into you if he came here, so I want you both to come together. He told me he could bring you after curfew and you wouldn't have to worry about getting in trouble."

"Oh."
"Can I ask you a question?"
"Mmm, maybe not," mumbled Tony. "But still—Steve, if you hadn't found us in that desert when you did, Pete would've been dead. And now—" He pulled back, looking down at his hands. "I kept—I kept waiting for you to show up. While Pete was—while he was in my arms, begging for me to help him, I couldn't do a single damn thing. All I could do was tell him that Papa would be there soon. That once Papa got there, he would be fine. But then—"
"JARVIS, can you please cancel my alarm for the morning?" he asked quietly. He could always go for a run later in the day if the weather cleared up. "Just let me know once Peter wakes up."
"Yep," said Tony. "Knock yourself out." He picked up his freshly refilled coffee cup, taking a large gulp as the hologram flickered several times before returning to its still, glowing state.
"You okay, Pete?" Dad asked.
"Uh huh. And?"
Tony called it breaking the cycle of shame, and Steve couldn't agree more. Steve had been drawn to both of the Starks from the very moment Nick Fury first showed him their pictures in their SHIELD files, promising Fury that he would search for them until he found them, no matter how long it took.
"No, I am afraid not, son of Wil," said Thor. "Because as mere humans, you lack the capacity to wield them. No, I believe that only a being of immense power would be able to handle these stones."
"No?" said Tony. "Why would I mind?"
It had been Obadiah who had arranged to have Tony and Peter attacked and captured in Afghanistan. It had been Obadiah who'd had Peter ripped from Tony's arms in that freezing-cold cave and dragged away to be experimented on, and it had been Obadiah who had then hooked up with Aldrich Killian, who tried to convert Peter into another Winter Soldier.
“Um, can you make mine a double, please?” Peter asks.  “I’m kinda—”
Sometime later, once he'd regained some feeling in his limbs, Steve brushed the sweat-dampened hair from Tony's forehead and planted a kiss there, sighing in his semi-contentment.
“Oh!  Well, now I really can’t wait.”  Obie waved his hand towards the door, sending ashes sprinkling across the top of his desk.  “Now, get on outta here.  I’ve got work to do.”
"And the only one who ever will, if I have any say," Steve said, barely able to form the words. Through bleary eyes he watched as Tony rolled onto his side, his rock-hard erection pressing insistently against Steve's hip.
"Yeah, he was pretty impressed when I told him," Peter said, curling his gloved fingers around his cup. "Then we spent the next hour developing an algorithm for one of our next Avengers training programs." He glanced up at Steve, a rather shit-eating grin on his face. "Just wait till you see it, Papa. I think you're gonna love it."
"Uh huh," Peter said as he crushed his polar bear to his chest. “Thanks."
"Yep. Can't have any pilots up there defending our skies that are in anything less than perfect health," answered Tony, rolling his eyes. "And especially not one who's the son of the infamous national traitor. Although, he wasn't quite yet at the time, I guess."
"Well, as long as you and Gwen enjoyed yourselves," Papa said. He smiled as he handed Peter a package, carefully wrapped in brown shipping paper. "This came in the mail for you today."
And he had to stay awake, for Tony's sake. He had to make sure that when Tony woke up, Steve was the first person he saw.
Tony is barely worthy enough to touch the end of his cloak.
"Of course he will be. But first we need to let him heal." Natasha gave Steve's shoulder a gentle shake. "C'mon, Steve. This'll only take a few minutes."
For a moment Wanda looked confused. "I'm—I'm eighteen."
"Tony, you don't have to—" Steve started.
"Bruce?" Steve asked as the man coughed again, and more of the shiny, slimy water came pouring out.
Peter drops his gaze to the table, tracing a pattern with his finger as he tries to come up with the best way to answer the question.
As he steps underneath the grand entrance gates and begins the walk across the quad towards the Athletics building, Steve can’t help but feel a sharp pang of nostalgia.  The four years he spent at Camp LeHigh University were by far the happiest time of his life, and to contrast how on top of the world he was then, when he was the shining star on a top-ranked swim team and an all-around BMOC to how he is now, an injured, washed-up has-been who can barely pay his bills is almost as painful as the ongoing throb in his shoulder.
"Damn right he is. Sleep now."
“It’s all right, Peter.  I should be heading back anyway,” Steve said.  “The store opens at 1000 tomorrow, so…”
Chomping down hard on his bottom lip, Steve tips himself to the side as Tony wrenches the shield out from underneath him.  He grits his teeth as the pain crests and then ebbs slightly, just enough for him to be able to draw in a single deep breath.
He was Captain America, for goodness sake, but even aside from that, fathers were supposed to be able to protect their families. It just wasn't fair that Steve's immense love for his husband and son still wasn't enough to keep their demons at bay.
It was actually happening. Or at least trying to happen.
"Okay, so why can't we use it to try and talk to him?" Gwen asked.
After getting Steve to sip some water and helping him into a pair of sweats that he found in the footlocker, Tony helped him out to the car and drove back to the Tower.  Once there, he spent the next hour helping Steve shower and shave and get dressed, ordering them both some soup and bread once Steve decided he was hungry.  Like Tony suspected, Steve hadn't drank much or eaten all weekend, and was so weak after getting cleaned up that Tony had to help him eat.
"Yeah," Gwen said softly. "I know."
It should've been
Which, as it just so happens to turn out, is pretty much exactly what is happening.
"Uhh—"
"Very good. Can you tell me the exact date in that year?"
Image Papa cried.
are you ready to go see
Alt-Steve said again, full of just as much disbelief as Steve. "
cool.
"Not now, Pete. You just try to relax—" Dad started.
"It is?" Blaster Guy, aka Peter, said. He frowned down at Peter. "Who the hell are you guys?"
It still really,
"Peter!" Gamora said sharply, elbowing Quill hard on the arm. "For once will you please just listen?"
Tony thought. He didn't remember the Chitauri tech including glass that wasn't glass, so what the hell else could it be?
"And, Pete?" Tony asked, so tentatively that it made Steve's heart do a flip. "We could—?"
The woman cut him off with a sharp glare, taking a single step forward.
"Ow!" he groaned, rubbing at the burning pain as he squinted at the gibberish rolling across his screen. "What the—?"
Tony let out a heavy sigh, burying his nose into his son’s soft curls.  “Yeah, I know you don't.  I shouldn’t’ve said that.”
"All right." Very carefully, Tony picked up Bucky's metal arm, holding it slightly bent at the elbow and donned his own glasses. He thought about grabbing a set of his arm gauntlets just in case Bucky suddenly decided to flip out, but decided against it. Bucky had only been violent with Peter during their very first meeting, when he had first arrived at the Tower and was still pretty out of it, and as much as Tony hated to admit it, Peter had been able to handle himself just fine. Tony sometimes didn't like to admit just how strong Peter was now, but that didn't mean he didn't believe it.
"All right," Steve began, looking around the circle of heroes that he called his family. "Based on Redwing's surveillance sweep and the low number of guards, it appears that this base has been abandoned, maybe recently. I'm hoping that means there won't be too much resistance, but we should still be on our guard. This is definitely a HYDRA base, and we can't put anything past 'em, so we all need to be alert and ready for anything."
"Sorry buddy, I wasn't trying to wake you up," he murmured, guilt shadowing his eyes. "I was just gonna kiss you goodbye."
—we would need to offer it to them as well. It would become a full planetary energy system, and—"
"Oh, I'm sure you'll get there eventually," murmured Steve. He dipped his head, planting a short but sweet kiss on Tony's lips. "Now, I suppose you haven't eaten lunch yet, have you?"
Ms Sharon was silent for several heartbeats, finally nodding once.
"And I always swore that I'd never fall in love because I was too afraid to get my heart broken," said Steve. "That's what happened to my ma, and it almost destroyed her." He kissed the back of Tony's hand, cradling it against his cheek. "I tried really hard to ignore you at first, tried telling myself that it was your father's fault that my papa was killed, anything to keep from falling for you. But none of it worked. I couldn't've stopped it if I tried."
He had knowingly risked his own life to save Steve's, under the assumption that he was beyond saving. If anything could be considered more heroic or selfless than that, Steve wasn't aware of it.
what if Peter—what if he never—if he never came into the store that one day?  I mean, what if he hadn’t—
"Gotcha," said Peter.
"All right," Steve said. He briefly locked eyes with Tony, who was standing at the foot of Peter's bed. Tony had made all of the arrangements for Peter to be discharged earlier that afternoon, during which Steve had had to physically restrain himself from punching out the lady doctor who'd had the gall to suggest that Tony should've pulled Peter from the hospital weeks ago.
And Tony was right there next to him, curled up into his side. Not flying off into space to destroy another massive alien army.
"I'm sure Sam wouldn't mind helping you study, Buck," Steve said. He checked his orbital trajectory, gripping the stick with a firm hand as he readied his index finger over the power button. "All right. I'm coming up on the go/no-go point in five, four, three, two, one—"
"So whatever or whoever it was that caused this either managed to evade our methods of detection, or the threat came from somewhere within the Compound," Steve continued. "And if that's the case, then we need to think about re-vetting the former SHIELD personnel that are assigned here."
he thinks, because in a 100 free, the start is worth at least half of the race.  And it costs even more if it’s a bad one.
"Better?" Dad murmured after a couple moments.
"Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure he's got guts to spare," said Sam. "Now, did I hear someone say something about pizza?"
She had also told Steve that O'Brien didn't hesitate at all to "reluctantly take control" of the government when the massive explosion that took Joseph Rogers's life, along with thousands of others, also took the life of both the civilian Langaran president and his top military general, General Hammond.
"No, no, honey, you know I'm joking," Tony cut in, brushing his fingers across Steve's full bottom lip. "Well, I guess I'm kinda only half-joking, but anyway, you know I don't wanna leave Pete here alone. Not now, not…
about what he'd overhead the doctor saying earlier that day. Absolutely nothing at all.
"But I thought that was kinda the problem, Стиви," Bucky said. "That they're not gonna run out."
"Look, Gwen," Peter said as he placed his hands on her waist. "I am so, so sorry. I know I've been a jerk to you sometimes, and it's even more jerky to just leave you like this, but I really, really gotta get going right now or this whole thing is gonna be shot to hell, so—"
"Jesus Christ, Cap," he said as he grabbed onto Steve's forearms, stilling him. "You know, between you and Tones, it's no wonder I'm starting to get wrinkles."
Phillips's head snapped up, his lined face etched in anger. "You forget that I was not always as high up in this system as I am now, Tony," he said. "I spent so many years having to bite my goddamn tongue that I can still feel the teeth marks on it, so don't you dare try and tell me that I should've done more! If I'd've gotten caught by the wrong superiors before I'd had a chance to get where I am, then none of what's currently going on would be happening!"
Tears welled in Steve's eyes, spilling down his cheeks before he even realised they were there. And Tony said
"Ah, Captain," he said as he casually took out another war dog. "So good to see you again!"
"No, it's not—huh?" Bruce asked. "What the hell is a game of thrones? Is that like chess?"
"Yeah, we do, actually," Peter protested, grinning as he felt his cheeks turning pink. "Papa does it most of the time, says it's a waste of money to have it sent out when he's perfectly capable of doing it himself. I mean, all their fancy suits get sent out still, but he washes all of our regular everyday stuff, and cleans his own uniforms."
"Okay," Natasha said slowly as she and Steve led Scott into the living room, where he immediately began pacing a path between the two big couches. "Um… well, I'd offer you some coffee, Scott, but—"
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, highlighting the relevant statements and handing the tablet to Steve, who quickly read it over.
"Eh, just another stupid problem with Damage Control," Dad grumbled, tapping rather firmly on the tablet. "No big deal, nothing for you to worry about."
“Which means that
Tony sighed as he curled his fingers around the mug and brought it to his mouth, his eyes fluttering closed as he swallowed. "Yeah, I bet. Can't take the chance, though. Don't want him getting sick right before school's out for the summer. It's bad enough that…" He trailed off, but Steve understood what he meant. Peter had missed the final three months of his last school year because of the trip to Afghanistan, and everything that had happened afterwards.
"Which we completely understand," said Steve. "I promise that we do. But please, Your Highness, I implore you. There are potentially billions of lives at stake here, and if it comes down to saving those lives or saving the stone, well… I don't personally see that as much of a choice."
"Is Peter doing okay?" he asked as he pulled on the t-shirt, raking his fingers through his mussed-up hair. Peter had been having nightmares recently too, the poor boy, on top of all of his other odd symptoms that had so far managed to stump not only Tony, but also his entire team of medical specialists. They had scheduled an appointment to meet with an acquaintance of Director Fury's who was a genetics specialist, but that wasn't until the fall, and both Steve and Tony were rapidly becoming more and more concerned about Peter as the weeks went on.
"Oh, don't worry, Captain Rogers," Ned said eagerly. "I'll make sure Peter's out here waiting with me, just in case he forgets or something."
It had taken all of Steve's inner strength—and more that he didn't know he had—not to lose it completely when Tony went unconscious in his arms, the elation he'd felt at his husband's safe return quickly tempered by Tony's weakened, unstable condition, and his own unbearable grief that Peter wasn't with him.
"Hmm," he said as his eyes landed on a rather large file, titled Alternative Budget Proposal, sponsored by some senator from Nebraska that Peter wasn't familiar with.
And while knowing about JARVIS's existence and having the knowledge to actually manipulate him enough to mess with the aircraft were two completely different things, Peter was still very glad that he'd taken the initiative to create more layers of encryption to JARVIS's programming. If Project Phoenix hoped to have any chance of succeeding, Peter had to make sure that JARVIS was kept safe.
All of which happened when he was crushed by falling debris while running a secret mission inside a hostile country where the very people who were supposed to protect him and Papa and the rest of their team had just hung them out to dry.
Was Steve really worth all of that?  Was he worth the inevitable embarrassment and tabloid fallout that would accompany Tony’s removal from the company that his own father built?  Was Steve worth ruining Peter’s inheritance, and forcing them out of their home?
"I'm just gonna wear something that I'd wear to one of our Decathlon competitions," said Gwen. "We're only going to a matinee, so there'll be people there in jeans and stuff."
Sweat was pouring off his body by the time Steve jogged to a stop outside the barracks door, his arms and legs so overloaded with lactic acid that he could barely feel them. He walked in a wide circle for a couple more minutes, occasionally stretching his quads and hamstrings and shaking his arms loose as he sucked in huge gulps of air, trying to re-oxygenate his overworked muscles. He did not want to tighten up suddenly during his flight later that morning.
“Mmm, you and me both, honey,” Tony said as he pecked Steve’s lips again.  “How in the hell did our lives get so damn busy anyway?”
"All right, that's all well and good, but then what about Thanos himself?" Dad asked. "From what you guys said, even without the gauntlet he still packs a wallop, right?"
"So you try something else," Peter said. "And if that doesn't work then you try something else, and you just keep trying until you find something else that you love to do. You just gotta keep swimming."
Peter watched as the patrol car drove away before climbing into the backseat of the truck grinning like a fool, which he realised a few seconds too late when Dad shot him a questioning eyebrow.
"But I thought you guys already had a ship?" Sam asked. "Isn't that how you got here in the first place?"
“Cap, we can handle the rest of these guards while you and Tony search for the cube,” Natasha says.  “Soon as the outside’s clear, we’ll follow you inside.”
Peter shot Ned a sharp glare, gripping the brass doorknob with his nearly frozen fingers. "Fine!"
"Both Captain Rogers and I would appreciate it, Mr Chairman," said Tony, smiling when he felt Steve squeeze his knee under the table.
Tony shot Steve a look, one that Steve had taken to calling his
"I didn't get a name," Sharon said. "But that also meant that I didn't want to risk asking for it either. I've had Captains Wilson and Barnes in here with Peter for most of the day today because I felt it was in Peter's best interests, so if I was wrong about that, I apologise."
Steve tightened his grip on Tony's hand, his heart lighter than it had been in days. This was the perfect example of the kind of optimism he needed to see at the moment.
"Thank you, sir," he said, hoping like hell that he sounded like he meant it. "That's quite an honour."
Tapping his middle finger on the papers, Fury huffed out a sharp breath, his one visible eye narrowed.
"Is there no way to move it away from the lake?" Steve asked. "If it's drawing its power from the water, moving it away might help."
"Is Peter doing okay?"
And the movie, while definitely not the best he'd ever seen, did turn out to be at least decent enough for him to want to see again.
Thank you so much for all of the kudos and kind comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story!
"Well, good," said Tony. "The perfect place for you guys to hide while Sam and I pick off the stragglers."
"Yep, pretty much."
"Well, I guess you're not much for pleasantries today, are you, Steven? Well, okay, I'll try not to take it too personally. We can just get started then, since you seem like you're just raring to go." He glanced down the hallway, nodding at someone out of Steve's eyeline. "You can come on down, sweetheart, I guess we're ready for you."
he thought as Thor landed a few metres away, grunting as he swung his giant axe at the seemingly endless incoming targets. After a particularly violent swing he noticed Steve, greeting him with a polite nod.
Steve let out a heavy sigh, scrubbing his palm down his prickly face. He'd have to shave before Tony came home, or he would never hear the end of it.
"Steve!" the voice insisted, this time accompanied by a firm hand on his shoulder. In his dulled-down state, it took a few heartbeats for Steve to realise that the hand was smooth, rigid, and heavy, and way,
"No, I definitely do not," said Steve. "In fact, I was kind of hoping that we could recreate our wedding night, if that's okay with you."
Tony shook his head, his eyes trained on Steve's collarbone. "I don't—I don't know, honey. I'm just—I'm just—"
"Nat, you don't have to," Steve said, wishing with all of his might that he could just disappear into the uncomfortable infirmary mattress. "And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I can't be what you want me to be right now, but—"
—was finally
"Master Peter is sleeping comfortably, Captain," answered JARVIS. "All vital signs are within his normal parameters."
"They should be here in a few minutes," Peter said, just as Papa's truck pulled into the parking lot. "Or now, I guess." He forced himself to attempt a smile, earning a quirked eyebrow from Gwen in return.
Bucky rolled his eyes. "Are you still planning on ditching Sam and me this afternoon?" he asked, each word enunciated like he was speaking to a very small child.
Chief Stacy frowned, pursing his lips. "Look, Captain, I'm not exactly sure what your son might've told you about me, but—"
The elevator doors had barely slid closed when Steve turned to Tony, curling his arm around his waist.
“No!” Steve gasped as he dropped to the ground, clamping his hands over his ears in a futile attempt to block out the horrific, bone-chilling sound.  It wasn’t something that he’d ever spoken of out loud, but the thought of ever again being trapped like he was, of slowly being submerged into icy water, frightened him more than almost anything else.
“Jesus Christ, Obie!” Tony snapped.  “I’m not five!”
"Eh, kinda. But at least it worked," Peter said. He pushed himself back up to his feet, offering Tony a hand. "Dad, did you really give me spider legs? They're so cool!"
"I always just got roses, girls seemed to like 'em just fine," said Bucky, whose glowering face was partially hidden underneath a low-lying Mets baseball cap. While Director Fury had finally managed to get Bucky a replacement military ID, complete with an altered date of birth that listed his age as thirty-one instead of ninety-five, he didn't yet have a driver's licence or any other New York State ID, so he was still very careful when he was out in public.
Steve's arms tightened even more around him as he sucked a mark into the top of Tony's shoulder, soothing it with his tongue. "On our bed, mo grá, where I can lay you out in front of me and touch as much of you as possible."
“I love you, buddy,” Tony murmured as he kissed his son goodnight.  “Sleep tight.”
"Oh, sure you wouldn't, until he just kills the both of you and takes the stone anyway," retorted Tony. "Or didn't you wizard-types think of that?"
T'Challa sighed, glancing back at his army. "Yes, it is important, Captain," he said. "But if this conflict has taught me anything, it is that sometimes we Wakandans place too much emphasis on what was, and not enough on what could be. You have my permission to reveal the location of the stone. I only ask for one thing in return."
"Well, it sure seems like you're ready for this next competition of yours," Papa said. "I was pretty impressed with how fast all of you were answering those questions."
"Steve? What's going on? Is Pete okay?"
And now, knowing that he
But these last few days, filled with nothing more strenuous than sunbathing and playing frisbee on the beach, lazy meals on the patio of their villa, sightseeing in a town where they were hardly recognised, and lots of alone time with Tony, had managed to recharge Steve in such a way that he could almost say that he felt like his old self again.
I'm pretty sure I've created a monster."
"Will you boys and girls be needing anything else?" the waitress asked as she stepped back, eyeing Sam up and down.
A second later his phone beeped with the probable location, an area not too far from an abandoned playground, close to a lake.
“I believe this brief article might be helpful, Master Peter,” JARVIS piped up.  “I have translated it from its original Russian for you.”
"Well, isn't that nice of you," Gwen said. Her green eyes were sparkling as she placed her hand on Peter's knee, sending a burst of warm fuzzies shooting up and down his leg. "So, is this Han Solo movie we're gonna see supposed to be any good?"
"Yeah, I kinda got that," Tony whispered. "And I know that you visiting him has really helped keep his spirits up since he's been in the hospital, so—"
"Which is why it would help if Mr Wizard here could just teleport us there instead!" Tony stated. He picked up a small rock and launched it towards Strange, grimacing as it hit some sort of personal deflection shield and bounced harmlessly away.
"No, nope, nada. Don't you
Tony's chest was heaving, his entire body flashing with current as he looked up into Steve's eyes, nearly blown black and so filled with unabashed adoration that his heart nearly stopped.
"Um… how do you know that the stones were destroyed?"
"And I've told
“We’re almost done, hon!” Tony called from Peter’s bedroom.  “Took the kid awhile to find a pair of pants that were long enough.”
the very one that Tony managed to catch a glimpse of not one, not two, but
Steve shrugged as he took a sip of his drink, swirling the hot, minty liquid in his mouth before swallowing and trying hard to ignore Sam's pointed look. Tony had always told him that he was an easy person to read, and it was times like this when he really wished that he wasn't.
sucks, but I seriously cannot tell you anything else about it right now,” Tony said firmly.  “Now, what I can tell you is that even though Steve’s having trouble, he’s still a grown man.  He knows how to take care of himself, so he will be fine this weekend while I try and figure some stuff out.  Okay?”
And now those demons were out for blood.
"Tony, we've finally managed to find the source of the decryption key for these files," Bruce said, removing his glasses. "Nat and I theorised that the key was located in a Russian text of some kind, and so we've had JARVIS running simulations pretty much ever since we got back from Mongolia, and I think we've finally found the correct text."
Schmidt Lane 4: 47.56
"Okay, so, you know you don't have to worry about scaring me, right?" Gwen cut in. "My dad's a police chief, Peter, and I've already lived through a bunch of the same stuff that you have, so… I doubt whatever you saw down there is much different."
"Pretty sure Peter would protest that one, sweetheart," Steve said as he sat back, quickly ridding himself of his clothes. Tony's heart gave a flutter as Steve tossed his t-shirt onto the floor. No matter how many times he got to see his husband's glorious body, it still never failed to amaze him.
"Да," replied Bucky.
"Judging by the displacement of the surrounding leaves and grass during the incident, it would appear to have been caused by a human," said JARVIS. "However, if that is indeed the case, he or she was too fast for me to visualise."
😭 = I got you right in the feels
"Understood."
“Pete, it’s okay if he doesn’t want—” Tony started.
"Even when we're not doing anything," Steve added. He grinned down at his husband, pulling him close and nuzzling his temple. "Although I absolutely would not be against doing something once we get home."
"Me too, Dad," Peter whispered. "Me too."
That finally got Dad to smile. "Oh, yeah. That makes more sense." He stepped back, checking Peter over from head to toe, giving him a playful bop on the nose. "You sure clean up pretty good though, bud."
Somehow, Steve doubted it. As he had told Senator Davis at the hearing, no one else could possibly understand Steve's perspective of crashing into the ice having recently witnessed the Nazi's rise to power, and being able to immediately recognise the exact pending signs almost as soon as he was defrosted.
Steve shrugged, swiping at his nose. "He asked me to tell him about the Stark family, so I basically just reiterated your credentials. I didn't say anything that wasn't already common knowledge throughout the Air Corps."
"Shh," whispered Tony. "Just… please, stop." He pressed his lips to Steve's forehead, tilting his chin up to look at him. "There doesn't have to be a next time, okay? I've got some plans that I'm gonna get working on ASAP that should prevent something like this from ever happening again, so—"
"What?" Dad exclaimed. "How the hell would it be able to do that unless—?"
"That's a bit hard to believe," Natasha said with a frown.
All within around three seconds’ time.
"That I didn't like gals?" Steve asked. "Yeah, she did. I didn't know that she did until Tony and I went to visit her during the whole Project Insight mess, but apparently she had at least guessed it back during the war."
"Nothing that you need to be worried about, Peter," Papa said, way too fast. "Dad and I are just checking up on a few things, okay? We should be back tomorrow in time to pick you up from school."
"Oh no, that's not it at all," Sharon assured him. "I don't think I've ever seen a more loving or overprotective father than this kid's dad. I mean, the only reason he's not in there with him right now is because he was afraid that he'd lose his job. It's just… well… you know our government, right? I mean, you're around it every day, so…"
Uncle Bucky sighed, scrubbing at his eyes with his palm. "I just… I just don't know what to do with myself. My whole life has revolved around the Air Corps. It's all I've known since I was old enough to know what it was, and now—"
All of which meant that by the time they finally got back to the repaired car, it was not only almost dark outside, but none of them had eaten anything since breakfast. After stopping to buy just enough food to tide Peter and Steve over until they could get home, Steve had insisted that Tony and Peter rest while he made them a dinner big enough for the entire team, complete with appetisers and dessert.
"Anyway, have you heard from Fury at all?" Steve asked. "Has he been able to get a handle on the damage?"
he exclaimed as he squinted up at the guy, who appeared about as stunned as Tony felt. "What the hell are you made from, iron?"
"I'm ready," Bucky said firmly, his rifle trained on the alien now barrelling towards them, flanked by four Chitauri warriors. "Should I take 'em out?"
"A six-year-old who's just had a major, life-threatening operation, Howard," Maria said. "And six isn't the same as sixteen, you know. There is quite a bit of difference."
"Hello," she said with a friendly smile. "I'm Gwen Stacy."
"Are there any issues?"
"Okay, okay, I get it." Tony scrubbed his palm down his face. "Look, I gotta get going now, but I'm gonna be coming out there as soon as I can this afternoon, okay?"
"Что?" the colonel demanded. "Это ваша обязанность подчиняться!"
your fault."
"So that's why I think we need to move the sceptre," Peter said, finally pausing to take a breath. "'Cause I'm thinking that one of these semi-enhanced people can run really, really fast and was trying to steal it when the drone fired at up at the Compound, so—"
"Ah uh. And how long would it take to double the range on the current drones?"
“As long as you promise to go easy on me during our first chess game,” Steve added.
Not exactly what he would've expected from a bunch of stuck-up pilots, and while Tony wasn't quite ready to completely dismiss his long-held stereotypes about pilots as a whole, pieces were chipping away pretty fast.
Not that he didn't want to take Tony to bed. On the contrary, it was starting to get ridiculous just how often Steve's thoughts were bombarded with images of Tony lying naked beneath him as he explored every little dip and curve of his glorious body, the sounds he'd make from those beautiful lips and the way his eyes would squeeze tight with pleasure. He'd gotten just a touch of that the previous night when their hands had starting wandering a bit more than usual during one of their intense makeout sessions, but so far Tony was allowing Steve to set the pace for their physical relationship, and as much as he hated to admit it, Steve was still pretty nervous about taking that next step.
"Well, you were a kid," said Peter. "And you were healthy, right?"
“No, no, honey, I’m not—
"Steve, honey,
Steve woke with a start, shivering and panting as he shot bolt upright on the bed. He gasped as he hugged his knees to his chest, glancing frantically around the room as he tried to get his bearings, his lungs screaming for air and his skin burning from the freezing cold Arctic water that he had just crashed a plane into for the second time.
He just hoped that his luck wasn't about to run out.
"Help!" Peter screamed as he attempted to zigzag, his heart jumping into his throat as the crack zigzagged right with him, finally catching the heel of his left foot. Peter screamed again as he was pulled into the freezing water, his arms and legs flailing as he attempted to break free of whatever it was that was holding him, dragging him down, down, down towards the very bottom of the lake.
"Ah, I found one!" Tony exclaimed as he emerged from the depths of the third junk drawer. He signed the paper with only a bit of his usual flourish before handing it back to Peter. "Did Papa happen to mention what he was planning for dinner tonight before he hit the hay?"
"Yeah, and I s'pose having a kid on the way doesn't factor in there at all, huh?" said Chester. "Say, you and Sarah pick out any names yet?"
"Ah…" Steve shot Natasha a questioning look, getting a shrug in response. "Ah, sure, Scott. JARVIS, can you please direct Mr Lang on where he can park his van? We'll meet him at the front door."
Steve's mind reminded him, causing him to scowl. It was something that he frequently said to both Peter and Tony, whenever the situation granted it. But he often had difficulty believing it himself.
"Like the tesseract," said Tony.
"Yes, I believe it works, Stark," Thor said after a moment or two, blinking rapidly. "And I thank you."
"All right, so, you mentioned using an old drug from the SI archives?" Tony said.
"And I thought you were already asleep, sweetheart," Papa answered, winking at Peter. "Which you should be since you didn't get any last night."
"Captain Barnes's aircraft was attacked by an unknown energy beam just as it emerged from the atmosphere, sir," said JARVIS. "I am at this time unable to determine if—"
He crawled into the bed, cuddling up right next to Tony with his head resting on Tony's chest so he could hear his heartbeat. Tony buried his fingers into his thick blond hair and dug his fingertips into his scalp, pulling a soft moan from Steve's throat.
"Yes, if you want to call it that," answered Steve, this time letting out a full-blown laugh. He bought Tony's hand to his lips again, kissing it over his wedding ring. "I don't think you can blame me for looking forward to bringing my husband and son home. And if that home just happens to turn into that incredible estate we stayed in on the Italian coast, well… then so be it."
Bucky paused, his right foot halfway into his shoe as he breathed in and looked at Steve. "If I'm honest? Pretty much right after our first date."
He could remember, but he sure wished that he couldn’t.
"It's probably 'cause the drug companies are just greedy," Peter added before Steve could come up with anything else. "They know people need the medicines they make in order to live, so they think they can charge whatever they want for 'em."
After they went and visited Peter, of course, which, despite his overall exhaustion, Tony couldn't help but admit he was very much looking forward to. Without the worry of getting to the hospital and then leaving again before curfew hanging over him, Tony's shoulders already felt at least three tons lighter.
All Tony could think about was that he had to get out of there, somehow had to get Peter out of that godforsaken hospital and somewhere else, where he could be safe. He'd heard various reports over the years of a few people who'd managed to defect over to Meridia, so maybe somehow he and Peter could—
"Here we go, little guy," Papa said softly as he set Peter down on the living room couch, with he and Dad settling in on either side of him while Dr Cho took out her stethoscope to listen to Peter's chest.
Wanted to watch as their newly-reunited family worked together to defeat the most nefarious villain the Avengers had ever encountered.
“Hello, Mr Wilson,” Tony said, grateful when his voice didn't catch.  “Ah… my name is Tony.  Tony Stark.”
At least the rain had stopped, leaving only the fat droplets that sprinkled down from the tall trees lining the walkway to shower them as he and Tony headed for the barracks. He had intended to talk to Tony about Operation Darkstalker, or at least ask if he'd ever heard about it, but after all of the rather unexpected events of the evening he had decided to wait. It was late, both he and Tony were exhausted, and he still had a patrol shift in the morning.
"I know you're not," Tony said quickly. "You're sixteen now, which you seem fit to remind us almost on a daily basis."
Dad's eyes went wide behind his glasses. "You did?"
looks. "C'mon, Dad. I know I'm not an official Avenger, but I'm not eleven years old anymore either."
"So, what you're saying is that HYDRA's probably got Papa in a building that's pretty much invisible?"
"All right, then," said Dad. "Go on and have some fun. Or, at least as much fun as you can have in a house filled with geeks eating pizza and drinking Dr Pepper." He glanced over at Ned, eyeing the hat he was wearing. "Nice hat by the way, Mr Leeds. Looks very… distinguished."
"Pete?" Dad yelled as he flew overhead again, with Uncle James not too far behind. "Pete, you stand down now, okay? There's only two or three of these bastards left and we've got 'em!"
"No, not exactly," Gwen said. "And he didn't tell me where he was going, just that he needed to leave right then or his whole plan would be ruined. But he did admit that he was going to search for his papa."
Mr O'Carl said as they exited the store, with Ma carrying her brown paper sack filled to the brim with what food and other supplies they could afford for the next week.
"My dad and Steve are gonna come and visit me tonight, so I'd love to look nice when they get here."
Or didn't wear. Steve really wasn't picky when it came down to it.
Tony rolled his eyes, a sharp stab of pain piercing his heart.
Thank you so much for all of the kudos and kind comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story!
Sucking in a deep breath, Steve unzips his dark blue Team USA-issued sweatsuit jacket and slips out of his matching pants, draping them neatly over the back of the chair behind him.  From the corner of his eye, he sees Schmidt doing the same, frowning slightly as the charismatic German blows a final kiss at the stands before mounting his starting block.
And that was the reason why they had won.
It might've been easier for Tony to ask for the moon. Or for the military leaders to overlook their massive prejudice against his family and allow Peter to have his surgery.
“Well, that sounds pretty cool,” Natasha says, taking a sip of her tea.  “Seems like a good way for you to get back into it, hmm?”
"Yeah, I think we've finally got 'em nailed down," he said as he checked his fuel gauge again, wondering why they hadn't yet been called back to base. "Who would've thought it would be so tough?"
Tony grimly nodded. "Yeah. And the fact that you didn't even notice tells me that you're a lot worse off than I thought, so—"
After crossing the street, Peter hurried over to the bookstore’s storefront, smiling widely as he noticed the hand-drawn artistry covering the plate-glass windows on either side of the door.  The left side featured a fully-loaded bookshelf drawn in a rainbow of colours, complete with bookends and three tipped-over books on the top shelf, while the right side was the picture-perfect reading nook, complete with a squashy beanbag chair, an adjustable reading lamp set on a small table, a glass of water, and a bowl filled with something that looked like popcorn.
"Yes, baby," Tony whispered as Steve suddenly sat up, his free hand slipping between them to grip their erections. Tony cried out as pleasure shot through his body like an arrow, forcing himself to open his eyes so he could watch his beautiful husband's face as Steve threw his head back with a loud groan.
There will be a time jump in the next chapter where we will be introduced to Tony, Peter, and Steve. :)
“Okay.  And what makes you so sure the Tesseract isn't here?” Steve asks.  “Wouldn’t this be unable to exist if it wasn’t?”
"All right, JARVIS, can you please tie that drone's camera to my computer screen?" Peter asked as he slipped on his glasses.
"Yes, sir, I would agree," said JARVIS. "Increasing the thickness of both gauntlets by three millimetres would offer a fifteen percent increase in the suit's arm strength."
"Dad, please!" Gwen pleaded. "I thought you'd wanna ask Peter about school and stuff, not interrogate him with questions about his parents' jobs."
"Peter's fine, sweetheart," Steve assured him. "He's just… sleeping, like he was when we got here. Dr Cho checked him out a few minutes ago, and she said his lungs are clear and his ribs are healing just like she expected them to."
"Just my parents," Ned said, shooting Gwen a knowing look. "Geez. Must be nice. Hi, I'm Peter, and my parents are Iron Man and Captain America, but to me they're just my dads who make me clean my room and take out the trash."
Peter squeezed his eyes closed, rapidly shaking his head. "No, I-I'm okay, just really c-cold. Could you please make my room a bit warmer?"
Mr O'Carl said as he finished wrapping up Ma's purchases. "
"Damn, these guys are sure on something today!" Bucky exclaimed over the comm as Steve launched into yet another dive, trying to shake the surface-to-air missile that was tailing him. He'd already managed to shake two of the things, the second one just barely, but they just kept coming, launching every few minutes from near the Meridian border.
"I'm guessing it was because he was either scared or paid off," said Grandma. "Or both."
"I love you so much, little guy," Steve said as he cupped Peter's round cheek in his hand. "And I promise that as soon as I get back we're gonna get you fixed up, okay? You just gotta stay strong until then."
He licked his lips, giving his head a hard shake. "Holy cow, Gwen, I'm
that we have eighteen thousand of ‘em ready to go!” Tony repeated.  “How many more do they need?”
"Okay, so I'm absolutely sure that you didn't make things worse," Tony cut in. His heart was thudding so hard it was practically echoing, but he couldn't afford to panic now. Not when Steve was right on the verge of it. "You're way, way too smart for that, so why don't you try again, yeah?"
And the distant voice of Peggy Carter, ensuring him that they would look for him, that they would find him.
"Born out of nothing but blood," Steve spat out.
"Which means that the Triskelion mess won't be done by the time Congress is back in session," Steve finished.
"Okay, right there, JARVIS," said Peter. "Can you please triangulate the position where that camera is paused?"
And while Tony knew that Steve would say the same thing about him and Peter, to Tony, it wasn't quite the same.
"Well, I'd like to say that I'm sorry, guys, but… I'd be lying," Sam said as the final Mets batter struck out to end the game and the entire stadium erupted in boos. Steve watched as the frustrated batter slammed his bat down onto the plate as the entire Nationals dugout emptied onto the field, the players all celebrating their playoff win.
"I believe Master Peter has come to the realisation that it is no longer worth asking detailed questions regarding your missions, Captain," JARVIS said. "Since such questions only serve to frustrate him when he is denied answers."
If anything, he was embarrassed.
"It's okay."
"Gods, you're just so fucking
"Watch yourself there, Captain Rogers!" Colonel Phillips barked as he took a step back. "It never does a pilot any good to have his eyes on the ground!"
"JARVIS, is Pete okay?" he asked once his lungs decided they'd had enough. Tony had checked in on Peter on the way to their room and found him completely conked out, but…
And seeing both it and Anthony listed amongst other people who were supposed to be patriots was even more difficult. Howard Stark had turned out to be nothing more than a traitor, and Steve still couldn't understand how he had managed to be acquitted after his massive and hugely expensive trial.
But with no other visible doors or exits he couldn't figure how it would be possible, and he couldn't remember being put in there in the first place since it was right after he'd been forced to see all of those horrible visions.
"Yeah, sounds good," Peter said. "See ya."
"Sir, the intense heat from the fires has sealed the canopy shut!" shouted one of the emergency team members. He tugged on Steve's arm, attempting to pull him away. "We need you to step back, we're waiting on the salvage equipment now!"
"JARVIS, pull up a map of the eastern coastal U.S. areas, yeah?"
"You will absolutely
Tony moaned as one of Steve's fingers slowly pushed inside him, followed quickly by a second. Despite the rubdown that Steve had given him he was still so tense with desire that he thought he might explode, grappling at Steve's neck to pull him down for another deep kiss. "You think I'm about to let you go off to space now that you've gone and said something like that? That is positively the hottest goddamn thing you've ever said to me!"
But instead of responding, Winter Soldier stayed quiet, gripping the arms of his chair as he stared straight ahead, his lips pursed so tightly they had almost disappeared. Tony's heart skipped a beat as Bucky sat straight up on the bed, still gripping Sam's hand, his chest heaving with every stuttered breath as he studied his alter-ego.
"This is over in that tree over there," Peter said, pointing out his window towards the large oak tree a few metres away. "And I've seen the momma bird a few times too, she's dark blue with red tips on her wings. She's really pretty."
"God, I've missed you so much, mo grá," Steve rasped as he kissed down Tony's jaw to his neck. "It's been so long, and I need you so badly. Le do thoil, an féidir liom tú a bheith agat?"
"Cap, I've got two heat signatures breaking through the treeline," said James as he flew by, followed directly by Sam. Outside the domed area, Steve could see orange flames and smoke rising up from the forest where a few of the projectiles had landed.
"Is there a reason why you never told me that Loki tried to use the Mind Stone on you?" he asked.
"I am Groot!" he said.
"Yes, he did. This is a Stark family project, Dad, so you're just gonna have to accept that."
Steve frowned at the mention of Obadiah. "Well, I can't say I'm not glad that we don't have to worry about him anymore."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're right."
was about to happen.
"I mean, I
"And what exactly is that supposed to mean?" Thor asked, groaning as he stretched out his legs.
He had just finished eating his lunch—Grandma had ordered him to take a nap after breakfast, using the excuse that his heart rate was too high for him to be doing anything more strenuous than sleeping—when he heard Uncle Sam, Uncle Bucky, and Uncle James all talking out in the hallway next to the kitchen. For all the times that the doctors and nurses in the hospital had spoken about Peter like they hadn't realised he could hear them, it was almost funny how often the adults in his own family did as well.
look.  “Dad can just pick us both up at closing time and we can go to the Tower together.”
Ned gave a nod, his face relaxing into a more sympathetic look. "Yeah, okay, but why the hell didn't you say anything to me about it? I had to hear about it from my mom, don't you know how embarrassing that is?"
"Of course, Captain," replied JARVIS. "Would you like me to continue recording this news coverage?"
“It sure seems like it!” Steve says with a frustrated huff.  “I watched him break the window and go through, but now—”
“Well, that’s good,” Tony said as he rested his palms on Steve’s arms, rising up to kiss him gently on the lips.  “You ready?”
"Right, but still. They may have had some of HYDRA's resources at their disposal, but for them it was personal. This," and he swept his hand around the lab, "isn't. This is just another HYDRA research lab, albeit one that's very large and very high-tech and apparently that came with a list of enhanced individuals."
Tony had warned Steve about how weird it felt to get yanked into the tunnel, so he was able to brace himself as Tony flipped his various switches and knobs and counted down from three. But he still wasn't quite prepared for how harsh the tug actually was, like a parachute opening directly behind the small of his back. As soon as he was inside the tunnel the warp trails appeared, exactly like he was flying on one of
The fact that Steve was apparently living through history in the making yet again was never far from his mind.  Discovering that HYDRA had been embedded inside SHIELD ever since the late 1940s, and had managed to trickle down into every single part of the organisation had led to several changes that Steve was still getting accustomed to.
Tony thought with a frown.
"Barnes! Rogers! Is there some sort of problem that I'm not aware of?" Phillips suddenly yelled from across the hangar. Steve's heart gave a flip as he saw Anthony standing next to him, attempting to look anywhere besides directly at Steve.
He patted Little Steve's package, giving him a wink. "
"How much of what you just told me did Sam tell you to say?"
And hope like hell that it wouldn't be the last time they were able to do so.
"How—how many are left?" he stammered past his dry throat, his mind spinning way too fast to do the math.
It didn't hurt that Steve had made sure to keep the kitchen stocked with plenty of easy-to-snack-on-but-still-healthy foods, mostly made by his—and Peter's—own hands.
"Is it that obvious?"
“Yeah, maybe, but…” Tony’s shoulders drop as he looks away, twisting his hands.  “Steve, JARVIS is offline.  I—I can’t get him to work, so… it’s probably because of wherever the hell we are, but I’m not sure if I can—if I can do something like that without him, so—”
"I'd be a lot better if everyone would stop asking me if I'm okay," Peter answered as he slid on the glasses. They were a bit too big for him, which Steve thought was adorable despite himself. Peter looked like a child playing with his father's glasses, which, from what Tony had told him, had been a pretty common occurrence when Peter was little. Something about how a two-year-old Peter thought it was really funny to put on his daddy's glasses when Tony was trying to work, and then refuse to give them back.
“Oh, sure!  I can do that!” Peter said, just as his phone buzzed in his pocket.  Apparently Dad had actually left the office on time for once.
The aftermath of that horrible time, when even a four-week-old Peter seemed to notice that things had suddenly gone horribly, horribly wrong, is still a bit fuzzy in Tony’s mind.  The sheer cacophony of emotions he experienced, emotions that began with abject disbelief and numbness and quickly morphed into devastation and pure, unrelenting anger, all while being forced to care for a baby who still believed that nights were for screaming instead of sleeping and who wouldn’t sleep at all unless he was literally tied to Tony’s chest, was by far the hardest thing he’s ever been through.
"This is gonna work, sweetheart," Steve murmured into Tony's ear. "It's gonna work because we're in it together, and as long as we're together, no one can stop us."
Instinctively Steve smiled, already running through possibilities through his head of how he might ask Anthony out when a thought suddenly occurred to him.
.  You know, the one you took to the Fireman’s Ball last year?”
"Shh, buddy, don't try to talk, okay?" Tony soothed, brushing Peter's hair from his forehead. "We're gonna get you taken care of as soon as we can, don't you worry."
My family is on vacation this week, so next week’s chapter will probably post a bit later on Monday than usual.  I hope everyone has a great week!
"Yeah, 'cause we got caught with our goddamn pants down! Again!" Tony snapped. He bit down on his bottom lip, hard enough to make Steve wince. "Jesus, Steve, how could I have let this hap—"
Peter nodded, keeping his eyes closed against the harsh late afternoon sun. "Yeah, that was probably him. The girl's name is Gwen Stacy, but I didn't really ask anything about her dad."
"Fine," Tony said with a playful pout. "Then I'm gonna go find Pete, make sure that he remembered to shower. Somehow I doubt that Sam would appreciate all of his hard work being ruined by a stinky teenage boy."
Steve shook his head, his lips trailing across Tony's temple and cheek. "You've got me, sweetheart." He pressed a hard kiss to Tony's lips before pulling back again. "Can I—can I have you tonight? I want—I want to feel you around me before I have to leave, and—"
There were a few seconds of silence before Colonel Phillips clapped his hands together. "So, are we all good to go here now?"
"Yeah, you two seem to do that a lot," said Dad, smirking. "And what exactly were you talking about this time?"
"Mmm. Well, that hasn't changed at all," Peter muttered. "Papa's never liked talking about what he was like before he got his serum all that much, only when I ask him something specific, and he never liked for me to see him when he got hurt during missions and was in the hospital. I guess he thinks it makes him look weak, but—"
And if he did, well, it was likely going to be one of the strongest tests of Steve's will that he had ever had in his life. Even now as he sat next to his son, trying to project an image of calmness and support, Steve could already feel his blood start to boil at the thought of laying eyes on even a holographic version of Obadiah Stane, the only man that Steve could say with absolute certainty that he hated more than Johann Schmidt.
pull something like that again, you got that? Not
"You need me to help you use the bathroom?" he asked. "Is that it?"
"Okay, but—"
"Yes, well, we need to be heading back to the precinct now," Stacy said firmly, shooting Steve a rather apologetic look. "Have a nice day, Captain, Mr Stark."
"And I've told you that you can drop the 'Captain', right, kiddo?" said Sam. "Round here I'm just Sam, all right?"
"Gotcha," whispered Tony. He tucked Steve's forehead against his neck and tipped his head back against the side of the tub, tears of anger and fear prickling his eyes.
"Yeah," Steve whispered, his blue eyes darkened to navy. "But I was thinking, maybe tonight…"
"Yeah, well, when you put it like that, I'll admit that it does sound pretty bad," Lang muttered. He dropped his head, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Look, as soon as Hank told me about the Pym Particle, or whatever the hell it is, I told him that I thought we should just call you guys. You know, the Avengers?"
He also hadn't ever had a single original idea in his life. Pretty much everything Hammer Industries had ever produced was a knock-off of one of Tony's designs, such that Tony had even been forced to take him to court a few times over the years for apparent patent infringement.
"Eleven," Steve answered. He checked his watch, a replacement for the one Killian stole from him down in Miami. "And it's only half past eight now, so that would give us a good ninety minutes or so."
"That's just so freaking
“No, no, you're fine,” answers Tony.  “I’m just—since JARVIS isn't here, I’ve gotta—I’m calculating the amount of force I’m gonna have to use, and… well… I just wanna make sure I don't screw up the math.”
"Ah hell," grumbled Uncle Sam. "After that mess down in Georgia I think we've all earned the right to some boredom. Haven't we?"
Steve smiled, leaning in for one final kiss before escaping into the hallway, where he nearly ran smack into Peter as he came barrelling out of his room, a small, flat disc in his hand.
"Captain Rogers! Do you have any plans to run for political office?"
"Uh huh," he said. "So, you feel like drawing a bird's nest?"
"Please, don't do that," he said. "Tell me."
It’s as if the gun goes off directly beneath Steve’s feet with how quickly he leaps from the block, entering the pool with the smooth grace of a professional diver.  The cool water sluices easily across his freshly-shaven skin as he counts out six butterfly kicks before breaking the plane of the surface.
"Nothing wrong with protecting a kid," Bucky said as they exited the locker room. "I had plenty of practise protecting you, didn't I?"
Peter's lips stretched into a smile as he opened his notebook, flipping his pencil around his thumb as he studied what he hoped were the final code fragments for JARVIS. Dad had told him he would be testing out his latest updates that afternoon, and as long as those were okay and once Dad got the last of his changes uploaded, then JARVIS would be ready to escort Steve and his two teammates out into space for their trial mission.
Steve breathed in as he nodded. "Yeah, something like that. Did you sleep okay?"
"Uh huh."
“Yes,” he whispered.  “As ready as I’ll ever be.”
"Like that, babe?" he whispered as he pressed another kiss to Steve's hipbone and climbed back up his body, feeling quite self-satisfied. Steve huffed as he curled his arms around Tony and rolled them over, dipping his head to kiss him.
“No, sir,” said JARVIS.  “There are no records of other agents being briefed on Captain Rogers’ mission.”
😭 = I got you right in the feels
Almost instantly Tony's mouth went dry. He had just seen Rogers earlier that day for his second simulator session, and he had seemed just fine.
“Y-you left!  You l-left m-me, and—!”
He couldn't become the man who killed the Avengers because he didn't prepare enough for what was coming.
"Yeah? Well, I'm not surprised. You've always been the master chess player." Tony's heart fluttered as Peter barely nodded in reply. He had been getting more and more fatigued even before they had moved him, but it seemed that just in the last few days he'd gotten so much worse. Peter's skin, which had always been cool to the touch, felt downright frigid to Tony now, with his lips a scary, bluish-grey colour. Sarah had increased his oxygen flow the night before and said that he was looking better because of it, but, like everything else, it was still only a temporary fix.
Peter sheepishly shook his head. "Not really. This is pretty much the first time I've even talked with a girl where they weren't looking at me like I smelled funny."
“The interface is holding steady, sir,” said JARVIS.  “No issues detected.”
Finally, after almost three agonising days of counting and deploying and collecting evidence, the time had finally arrived for Steve to deploy and initiate the tesseract. With Carol's four satellites completed, she reentered the atmosphere to a six-aircraft escort—one of whom was Rhodey—and a hero's welcome once she touched back down onto the runway, and was now standing amongst the too-large crowd of pilots and other soldiers who had all collected inside the Control Room to witness Steve deploying the tesseract.
Tony's eyes flashed with guilt, only for a split-second before he was able to turn his face away, but it was still long enough for Steve to notice.
Of course, Tony had had no idea that was the case when Regina was hired, and neither did anyone else at Stark Industries.  Including Obie, who had given the final go-ahead to hire her.
“We don't,” he said quietly.
Steve made a sort of choked off noise in his throat, and Tony cringed as his mind finally caught up with his mouth. "Oh, geez, honey, I didn't—I didn't mean—"
"Yes, sir," Tony said quickly. "Thank you."
Steve glanced down at their joined hands, his gloved fingers tightening around Tony's armoured palm. "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he murmured, his voice shaking. "But I can't—"
"I am, Captain," replied the major. "And good luck to you."
Drax let out such a heavy sigh that he nearly collapsed as he turned to Quill. "I really prefer it when we wing it."
"Gwen?" Peter said in disbelief, jumping back in horror as he saw her clinging desperately to the edge of a ledge. "Gwen, what're you doing here?"
Carol nodded, like it was completely normal for a human—or humanoid, Steve supposed—to be able to fly through actual space without a ship. "Yep. I was about two galaxies away when I got Fury's signal."
"Uhh," Peter stammered. "Do you want me to tell you the truth, or what I think you'd wanna hear?"
Tony gave a short nod, his eyes turning mischievous as he reached his hand between them, cupping Steve's already resurging erection. He leaned forward, pressing kisses along the shell of Steve's ear as he whispered, "You ready for more now, baby? 'Cause I wanna ride you."
Carefully, Steve trails his fingertips down the expertly folded ribbon and across the raised markings on the centremost medal.  A knot rises in his throat as he recalls how proud he felt that day, when he leaned down so the Olympic official could drape the medal across his neck, congratulating him on his world-record win in the 100-metre freestyle.
And now, Papa's life was depending on him.
"That information is currently on a need-to-know basis, Captain," added Phillips. "And I can assure you that as soon as it's necessary for you to know, you will know."
"Yeah, okay," muttered Tony, barely noticing her walking away as Steve handed him his paper, his lips pursed in anger.
"Yeah."
"One of them should be an FBI transport chopper," said George Stacy. "I've already made arrangements for a secured holding facility in Atlanta until we can figure out what to do with the prisoners."
He'd have to ask Dad to show him what they did once the battle was over.
“All right, then that’s assumption number one,” said Tony.  “Now, who else do we got?”
"They were experimenting with that drug," Peter said, grabbing his polar bear and stuffing him under his chin. He let out a hard shudder as memories from the Miami bunker flooded his mind, of him lying there, strapped to a freezing cold concrete slab as the Aminacin burned through his veins like molten lava, while he bit through his bottom lip to keep from screaming from the almost unbearable pain.
“Good afternoon, Master Peter,” JARVIS said as Peter stepped inside his bedroom.  “I trust you had a good day today?”
the someone was.  Just as Tony had feared would be the case.
"Well, unfortunately, that does present a bit of a problem," said Thor. "Seeing as how the Earth possesses little in the way of interstellar travel—"
And the fact that he'd literally ran into Anthony earlier hadn't helped either. Not in the slightest.
Despite the busyness of the street, the coffee shop was fairly empty when they arrived. After placing their orders, Steve and Sam settled into a table in the back corner, where Sam shot Steve a wary look as he eyed Steve's large peppermint tea.
"God, you're insatiable," Tony breathed, slipping his hands under the waistband of Steve's loose pyjama pants to grip his deliciously firm ass. "How'd I get so damn lucky?"
"Yeah," Steve said, huffing out a sharp breath.
But not Peter. 'Cause he was still "just a kid".
"Got it," Natasha said. "I'm on 'em."
say anything like that ever again!" he rasped in Howard's face, barely restraining himself from punching the smug look right off it. "I don't give a

for him. That I'd tear the whole world apart if I had to, just to keep him safe." He raised his head, locking eyes with Steve. "And, that I'd never, ever make him wonder if I loved him."
"I will try," Tony said honestly as he laid back down, allowing Steve to pull the blankets up to his neck.
seeing that look in Steve's eyes,
"Thanks," said Ned. "I'll see you on Monday."
"I'll admit, it is pretty cool to be able to get the facts from people who actually lived through them instead of a book," Peter said as he pulled out his algebra textbook, balancing it on the pile in his arms. "But seriously dude, you gotta quit talking so loud about Uncle Bucky, okay? With all the new scrutiny the Avengers are under, we gotta be extra careful until we can get all his stuff sorted out."
Before Peter could regain his bearings, the image dissolved into pixels again, reforming to show Papa and Uncle Bucky in another, smaller hospital room, one that Peter guessed Uncle Bucky was in right before his surgery.  Image Papa’s right hand was wrapped in a thick bandage, and Peter’s heart lurched as he watched him rake his left hand through his hair, yanking so hard on the strands that he let out a soft cry.
"I've already made arrangements for all that, Ms Carter," said Colonel Phillips as he stepped up next to Tony. "Scans and tests first, then a private room that should be big enough for the three of them."
, DUM-E reappeared, whirring and warbling like R2-D2 on steroids as he motored back to his corner, seemingly unharmed by the particle experiment. Peter breathed out a sigh of relief. While he trusted his and Dad's calculations, the first experiment with a new piece of tech was always a bit nerve-wracking, and even more so when it involved people. Or beloved bots, as it were.
"Yep, that's the one," Steve said with a nod. "It's always something that I wished my papa and I could've done. After that, I've already promised Peter that he can teach me how to climb a tree. There're so many beautiful oak trees in the woods behind that lake cabin that would be perfect for climbing, so…"
It was time for Langara to be reborn.
Gwen gave Peter a smile that sent ribbons of warmth coursing through him, which was good because it was absolutely
"I'll save you guys a seat," he said with a mock-salute.
“Then I say we flush the goddamn rodent out from his little underground rodent tunnel and get the hell outta this popsicle stand,” Clint says as he comes up next to Thor, fiddling with one of his arrows.  “‘Specially since it’s cold enough here to make actual popsicles.”
Tony gives a nod.  “We’ll be watching for you.”
Awesome moodboard made by Stella @therollingstonys thank you so much!  💖
"Hey, guys," Tony said quietly. "Steve and the rest should be here in a—"
"Oh!" Tony said on a gasp as his eyes swept across his husband, as tall and strong and beautiful as ever. A second later his legs gave way underneath him and Steve rushed forward, lifting Tony into his arms.
"Well, that's just great," muttered Sam. "So we just gotta cover this entire field until these things somehow run out?"
"Namibia?" Bucky said, confused. "Why would anyone attack there? Are they hiding some super-secret tech too or something?"
"Steve—"
"C'mon, big guy. Let's go," Tony said when Bruce started muttering to himself, finally flipping the final switch.
“Pretty sure you’ve just proved who the asshole is, mister,” said Carol.  She yanked hard on Obie’s arm.  “Now, c’mon.  You’ve got a jail cell to meet, and James and I have plans for later.”
"Don't let him close his fist!" Gamora yelled.
And now, with both Steve and Peter missing, Tony knew that Bucky was struggling pretty hard.
"Got it!" Sharon said as she yanked out the tube. She quickly shrank back, allowing Steve and Tony to rush to Peter's side as his body began to relax, his eyes slowly blinking open.
"Me either," Steve said. He pressed a kiss to the top of Tony's head before releasing him and holding out his arm. "Shall we?"
But Steve didn't even break stride as he shook his head, his grip on Tony's hand tightening. "No, you don't. Not tonight."
"Don't think those guys really care about local law enforcement there, Sam," said Clint. "But you're at least right about Bucky. Pretty sure Peter has him wrapped around his little finger."
"We would never ask you to do anything that would put your people at risk, Your Highness," Steve said. "Just the fact that you've agreed to form this alliance with us is proof enough to me that your intentions are pure."
Steve gave a slight shrug. "I'll figure something out. But the most important thing is that you're not alone anymore, Tony. There's the two of us now."
"And you've updated the program that calculates the go/no-go points?" That program had been one of the first things Peter had written, and it had worked so well on the trial mission that Tony hadn't given it much thought since.
