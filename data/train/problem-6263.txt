Tony seemed to go on about food for a while; his eyes lit up as he spoke. It was cute. "The only word I understood in all of that is vegan, I think," admitted Steve. One of his doctors had been vegan when he'd just gotten out of the ice, their colleagues had given them shit for it in the lab. He'd liked their sense of humour, the way they all joshed around with each other; it had reminded him of the Howling Commandos. "But you said Italian. So I want Italian."
Tony remained in Steve's lap, silently staring, his fingers idly stroking the fabric of Steve's pants.  How much he was getting was unclear. He had managed to mumble an apology to Steve and say something about Kunar, but that was it.
Not that Tony was married to Christmas in particular.  Before he'd hired Pepper, he had celebrated Hanukkah with Obadiah.  His childhood had been a confusing mismatch of holidays; his mother and father and one of his nannies had pushed Christmas, while Obadiah had pushed Hanukkah, and the other nanny, perhaps just to be contentious, had pushed Kwanzaa.  The result was that Tony associated winter in Long Island with wearing a dashiki, lighting a menorah, and then unwrapping presents while avoiding a very drunk Howard. For Jarvis, Christmas meant a hell of a lot of work because every year they threw a massive, relatively secular holiday party, where Tony was dragged around and had to meet a lot of his father's friends and shake a lot of hands.  If he played his cards right, he normally ended the night sick from a combination of too much candy and too many sips of champagne from indulgent adults who delighted in Tony's intelligence. Tony never saw another child at any of the holiday parties; he was his father in miniature, a mascot who got a lot of gifts and was showered with attention but, at the end of the night, always felt relieved that it was over.
After a fair amount of arguing at the gate, they let the car through, and Happy dropped Steve off at the entrance.  "Knock 'em dead, Cap!" he called.
"...you're not a fan of the Starks either, huh?" asked Cece, picking up on the aggression immediately.
"Don't be ridiculous.  It's not the Winter Soldier, it's just Tony.  Tony doesn't like people touching his hands or wrists," said Pepper dismissively to Sitwell.
?  Steve, can you go get me some shrimp real quick before the show starts?  I didn't know they had shrimp. Hey, you, do me a solid and pour this into a coffee mug," demanded Tony, thrusting his glass at one of the many aides scurrying around.  She took it for him and disappeared. Tony said, an aside to Steve, "I've
"I think we'll have enough of a problem with you following orders already," Steve pointed out dryly. The Nat/Clint backstory was a complicated one, one he wasn't fully aware of yet. He knew it had been a messy time- a lot of fighting and a lot of-
," said Tony softly, stroking Steve's cheek with his thumb.  He noted that Steve was using "vous," the more formal tense.  Was that because they were being formal?  Or was that because Tony was an Alpha and Steve was an omega?  "
He wasn't sure when his breathing steadied or when he finally dropped off to sleep; he woke as they were landing, his body drenched in sweat, his muscles sore from being clenched.  He felt like he'd aged years; he probably looked like hell, but in a way, he felt that was better, because when he saw Pepper, she would see and understand why he had needed to see her.
"He went to bars, a bit," Steve said with a shrug. "But I didn't go out much. Omegas weren't really supposed to go to those kind of places, you know?"
Peggy had never let being a woman get in the way of rising through the ranks of the SSR.  Steve wouldn't let being an omega prevent him from doing what needed done, either.  He never had.
"...which we appreciate.  However, it doesn't mean he gets to hijack Friday's press conference for his little crusade."  Malick sipped his coffee calmly.
A group of nurses walked past in the corridor. They were chatting amongst themselves; they quieted when they glanced in and saw Steve's sleeping form.  Tony glared back protectively, arms wrapped around his omega.
Pepper cringed.  "No.  Bad idea, Tony.  Justin's presenting tomorrow.  He was very insistent, so we gave him a slot, but--"
Then Steve was slammed into a wall and his head swam and he dropped down to the floor as he was let go.
"Just stay out of the way," Kate huffed as they were ushered into another room, one of the nurses helping Steve walk. Another nurse blocked off the cameras that tried to follow, shutting the door behind them and locking it.
DeSoto frowned a little.  "Maybe I don't wanna walk around without a collar 'cause I'm scared of getting shot again!" he said defensively.  "And-- and I don't even like fighting. I only do it 'cause he tells me."
"Any information at all, Tony, anything could be useful... come on... what does he feel?  That's the easiest part, emotions. What's Steve feeling?" prompted Natasha softly.
Tony groaned.  Beneath him, Steve was still lost in thought; Tony nosed his neck.  "Steve?  You okay?  ...penny for your thoughts?"
"No can do, Tony.  I've got to attend a conference on geothermal energy this weekend, so I'll be out of the country until next month," said Reed, stretching across the table to shake Steve's hand.  "Although I was actually hoping to pick
Tony doubted SHIELD would help him clean up his act.  Better organizations, notably AA, had tried.  "...Assuming I even pass the test.  That psyche test, that was insane, Steve.  And... my psyche, it's not exactly healthy, probably."
"Fight you myself?  That would hardly be fair.  After all, you've been artificially enhanced.  This isn't your true self. Not physically. And not socially.  No. There's nothing natural about you. But we'll fix that. Witch?"
Steve got his good arm up and pressed against Bucky's left, knowing that if that metal arm pinned him down it was over. He had to keep it up and away from his face and torso. He felt his fingernails digging into the gaps between the plates and felt sick. The look in Bucky's eyes was empty and distant. He was alone. And he was starving. And he was so, so
Steve wasn't entirely sure who was being made fun of: Sean or him. Either way, he didn't like it. Natasha was right; they should go.
Tony didn't think it would be hard to disprove Spiderman's status.  All he had to do was figure out the guy's secret identity.
Damned Avengers.  Tony was looking forward to kicking them all out once he got his new element synthesized.
"Yeah.  But it probably won't be sleezy," said Tony.  "It'll probably be some five-star Ritz. And you can't let on that you're uncool with any of it.  Bite him, if you have to, just get him out of there."
"I know very well," Steve hummed and leaned down to tug on Tony's bottom lip gently between his teeth. He had burst into laughter when Aria had seen Tony naked for the first time. She'd walked in with her usual coffee and seen a butt-naked Tony inches in front of her just as she walked into the kitchen.
His eyes widened when pieces of the suit began shooting across the room at Tony at an alarming rate. "Tony! You already have concussion; you didn't need to give it to yourself again! Oh my God..." Steve was at his side at instant, shield forgotten on the floor. He moved to help Tony sit up then inspected the back of his head with a frown. There would be a nasty bruise there later.
Steve shivered beneath him at the touch, his fluttering closed as he sucked in a soft breath. The hot wet touch of Tony's mouth and tongue were enough to make him tremble. Make him
"Tony, calm down, please.  Stop shouting.  I'm fine.  Oh my God..."  This wasn't comfortable. But Tony still couldn't hear him. "He's not going to put me down anytime soon, is he?" He sighed.
Tony felt a prickle of discomfort and he realized why after several moments; she hadn't yanked up the sheets to cover herself, which would have been normal.  She'd only sat up, but now she was sitting there, staring at them as if not at all concerned about her nudity or vulnerability.
"...it's all faked," he whispered to Steve as blood splattered everywhere.  "They dye corn syrup red... it's just special effects."  He made a mental note not to show Steve
"Why am I even arguing with a confused little breeder?" asked Gideon, sounding amused.  "Stupid Alphas like the Starks and bleeding-heart betas like Fury put all these ideas in your head... I shouldn't expect you to understand.  Take Donner back to the Triumph so that he can carry on with his little life and find a nice Alpha to take care of him."
he is." She shot him a glare back. "You're on the team now. Your welfare is our responsibility." Was there perhaps a hint of tenderness in her tone? It was hard to tell. "Get used to it."
"Except it's illegal to have arranged bondings and it's illegal to sell people," said Tony, leaning his elbows on the counter and pouring himself a glass of orange juice.
Tony opened his mouth but nothing came out; the lump in his throat was too big.  He closed it after a moment.  What was there to be said, anyway?  He'd mated Steve because there hadn't been a mark there.  Except there was, maybe, a mark covered up by the serum.  A claim laid by another Alpha who death was now no longer a certainty.
Steve almost fell asleep himself on the drive himself, his breathing soon falling into sync with Tony's. Happy switched the radio over to music and the drive was almost peaceful. Aria and Pepper were basking in the afterglow of their success, and Beth just looked grateful for some quiet.
.  "It's rare for the gland to really swell up like that.  Though it does happen, especially after... well... for lack of a better term, forced bondings."  He walked over to a sink on the wall and squirted out the fluid into it.
after him. In fact, he was pretty sure he preferred that idea too. "So..it's not like an interview? We just say we're good? There ain't any...questions?"
Steve loved riding a bike. He loved the power between his thighs and the speed. He was, undeniably, an adrenaline junkie. He felt free like this, even with Tony's arms around him. He felt better.  Some days Steve was often tempted to just...ride. Ride as far as he could go and never turn back. But now he had a real reason to stay.
Captain America's face was... it was like home.  He felt an intense draw to him.  Like they'd known each other all their lives. He felt the same way about Captain America that he felt about Colonel Karpov.
"I doubt they use omegas as guards," pointed out Sam.  "Could've been a janitor or something. Not a threat."
Tiberius shifted Steve into his lap.  The only thing to do was to let it pass, he supposed.  It was only because of Steve's heat that he was having these momentarily flashes into Bucky's mind.  They couldn't be pleasant, though. Steve's skin was clammy as if he were ill. Steve mumbled something in Russian.
Steve nodded and let Aria take his hand when she reached for it, leading him back the stairs like a mother might a child. "You rebel. Stepping outside three hours early..." She was tipsy. He could tell. Aria didn't usually make jokes.
a man who's got some insecurities," said John loudly, obviously not the slightly bit worried about being overheard.  "Girls, you want a picture with Captain America?"
You're doing it now, as you're celebrating your anniversary, dressed in your wedding suits which still miraculously fit, and there is only one explanation for the smile that instantly grows from your heart as the lines on his face arrange into a smile too: you are just as in love as you've been a lifetime ago.
"You w-won't kill him," Steve wheezed, somehow still talking despite all the hormones clouding his brain. He hated the fact that his body was responding, that he was still slick despite all this. He was repulsed at himself. Maybe his body struggled to portray his true feelings but as Steve looked up at Gideon there was nothing but contempt in his eyes.
Natasha was edging down the hall; she picked up Tony's face plate.  Normally, Tony would have lost it at someone else touching it-- he was extremely protective of his suits-- but he didn't really care at the moment.  His world had shrunk to Steve. His priorities were getting him to safety and mating him. End of list.
Doctor Gleason was. He looked oddly comfortable in their over-priced, over-large, over-gadgeted kitchen, piling the final pancake onto a plate before turning around to see Steve. "Ah! I thought the smell might coax you down," he tried for a warm smile. "That's quite a crowd outside. Very loud and stupid."
The soldier stared at him, blankly, not knowing what the Avengers were or who Tony was.  He doubted very much that Tony could kill him, though. No one could. People had certainly tried.
are the reason omegas are still being vulnerable. How can we stand up for ourselves if people won't even listen?"
"Tony, she's a doctor, she just wants to talk to him," said Maria, who had Tony's arms pinned behind his back and was wrestling to keep him under control.
He made sure he'd had a few drinks, enough to settling his stomach and the shaking in his hands, before he called to JARVIS.  "Hey, let Steve know I'm up and in the shop.  Code's still 1009.  Oh, and ask him to make me coffee?" hollered Tony over the guitar.
"Also... HYDRA never knew we were mated," he pointed out. "My bite mark was gone on the surface, after the serum."
He opened his eyes.  His own reflection stared blankly back at him and his breath fogged up the glass.
Tony pulled his omega against him, smiling.  "Pretty awake, yeah," he purred, kissing the top of Steve's head.  "I would still appreciate a cup of coffee, though."  He propped himself up on one elbow, looking down at Steve.  The soldier was curled up against him sweetly.  There was something strangely dichotomous, almost perverse, about seeing an omega in such incredible shape, with a body so hard and toned.  The serum had made him look every bit an Alpha.  Not that you could always tell just by looking at someone, but the truth is, no one would look at a picture of Steve and possibly think he could be an omega.
Fury yanked a hard right and Steve swore that, for a split second, the car went up on two wheels.  They bumped over a curb and tore through a small garden plot on the curb, ruining the flowers.  It didn't matter.  The black SUV behind them had closed a gap and there was a loud crash as a shotgun shell took off Fury's sideview mirror.  He swore again.
Tony lapsed into silence.  Obadiah had died two years ago and the circumstances had not been pleasant.  Tony often found himself wondering about it, late at night, when he'd been drinking.  Obadiah had attended his graduation, had taught him piano, had picked him up at the police station when he'd gotten his first DUI.  Obadiah had been a man with remarkable control of his emotions and how he expressed them; Tony never knew at what point Obadiah had stopped caring about him and begun loathing him.  Tony knew he was difficult, and couldn't help but feel he'd earned Obadiah's wrath; or maybe Obadiah had always secretly hated the boy that took over the company he'd worked so hard to build up, the boy who inherited it unwillingly and never bothered to take it especially seriously.
Wanda simply made a noise of acknowledgement, focused on the delicate thread of thought, wispy as the strand of a spider web, that connected her to Stark.  His mind was different. A nebula of thought, multiple intersections of individual ideas and observations, and she was finding it hard to manipulate.
The soldier crossed the narrow, snowy, empty street toward the motel on the other side and let himself in, making a beeline for the stairwell.  It was eerily empty and echoed. He climbed up the stairs purposefully.
Tony look over at Steve, still holding his hand.  "I know they're having a big brouhaha after the show but I'd rather... spend some private time," he said quietly.  He gave Steve a tight smile. "Bet you that shield would work just as good as a trash can lid for sledding," he added.
A very, very, very small lie.  Tony had been with men in a few contexts but none of those seemed important.  A blowjob was a blowjob and when you were high on MDMA in a club, you didn't really care who was doing what to you.  And naturally, sure, he'd double-teamed a few ladies in his time, that happened occasionally; you didn't want to be the only billionaire at the coke party who was going to throw a fit because there was another guy balls-deep in the other end of your lingerie model.  But he lacked the vocabulary to explain this distinction to Steve and he was pretty sure Steve could guess at that, since Steve had seen how he lived.
Steve blinked in surprise.  Had Tony just…?  They’d warned him that he might try something like this, but that had seriously seemed to come out of nowhere.  He paused for a moment.  This had caught him totally off guard.  Steve was on a mission, he hadn’t even been thinking about...
"Last year, the grand prize was Donner Malick.  I suppose because he looks like a certain someone..." said Maggie, a glint in her eye.
"It's a good thing we did a test run," she said quietly.  "I don't think he'll pass.  There's... a problem."
Tony made sure he was dry before climbing in beside Steve, wrapping his arms around the blond.  Spooning Steve was a weird experience; Tony was used to holding people much smaller.  He checked the clock on the bedside as he settled down with his omega; it was almost five.  He nosed Steve's hair apologetically and closed his eyes, drifting off still thinking about the metal arm on the table downstairs.
Richard breezed in as if summoned by Donner's cries.  He checked his watch. "Well, your contractions are happening much more regularly.  I'd say you're due in another hour or so, Donny."
Donner nodded timidly in the corner.  Gideon had always known exactly where Donner was, all the time.  For an Alpha to not know where their mate was was certainly upsetting.
"Sure, you don't have a safety net but the reason you don't is because of this stupid statusist Alphas-first-then-omegas culture, which you're feeding right into by putting yourselves up for sale! My brother sold himself like this because our parents wanted him to.  And he's fucking miserable. He hated his Alpha but dad told him, 'don't you dare come home' because it would have brought too much
"You want me to get that?" asked Tony, pointing to the phone.  The last thing poor Steve needed was to be bothered by God-knows-who; if it was a reporter, Tony was going to go mental.
"Hey, Steve?  I wanna change my answer.  I would've chosen you even if you were little.  I would've wanted to bond you.  You're the best mate a guy could ask for," said Tony.
Tony's tone sounded different but Steve didn't frown, he just complied, trusting Tony explicitly as he rolled over beneath his Alpha. The sand was soft beneath him and he didn't care that it was getting in his hair and all over his clothes. This was actually going to be the first time they had sex since his heat. They'd both been sore and things had been… awkward. So this felt important.
“Of course not,” said Tony, who was yanking his tie loose and walking into the bedroom to flop down on the bed.  “Just rub my shoulders, will you?  You can leave once I’m asleep.”  He closed his eyes.  He didn’t want to admit it, but he needed some comfort.  He felt tired and uncomfortable, and the full breakfast in the room made his stomach turn.  He wanted to pull his shirt off because he was too hot, but he didn’t dare.  The last thing he needed was Steve seeing the veins on his chest.  Besides, who knew if he’d go and tell Pepper?  After all, Steve technically worked for both of them, and he sort of seemed like a squealer.  Tony didn’t want Pepper to know.  She had enough on her plate already.
"You guys both kicked ass yesterday," Banksy tried to point. "You can't let this get you down." Even though it was evidently getting him down too.
Steve almost blushed at the comment and then looked up, expression softening as Tony pretended to size him up just so. He cocked his head and met his gaze before he sighed fondly. "Well then," he placed his hands on his hips and gave him an expectant look. "Get out of bed, Tony." He said, voice not quite commanding but certainly firm.
Tony let Steve towel him off and the two of them curled into the massive bed together.  Steve snuggled up to Tony.
"Thank you, sir.  But I'm a good omega," repeated Donner stubbornly.  He didn't want this man thinking he was a trouble-maker like Rogers.  Donner had never voted and never gotten to attend university because of Gideon, although he'd been accepted, which he felt like was an honor all by itself.  (Gideon had not let him keep the acceptance letter; it was one of Donner's few prize possessions, but once Gideon had bought and bonded him, he'd made Donner tear it up and throw it out so that he didn't get any "ideas.")
The doctor shrugged. "When a body is trying to reject the bond bite it becomes more agitated and red; it heals slower and so infection is more likely.  No serum in the world can change that."
"Our first appointment's at eleven," Steve said as he munched on a piece of fried bread. It was already past ten. He was dressed in a smart pair of jeans and a casual light blue shirt himself. His neck had healed completely from the night before. There was a fresh indent of teeth, but they were faded. There was no sign of any cuts that had caused his gland to leak, thankfully. The bite on Steve's shoulder was also, of course, completely gone.
Another wave of panic seized him and his good arm got goosebumps.  He gritted his teeth but that made them hurt.  Dr. Liebmann had warned him off solid foods for at least a week. If he could have anything, it would have been human company.  He didn't mind being ignored; he would have just liked someone to be in the room with him.  Being alone was terrible.  He would have even preferred to be with Dr. Liebmann, who patted his head a lot and talked directly to him, which almost made up for the excruciating pain of surgery.  But no one needed him right now so he was by himself.  He lay on his cot, clutching the picture of Captain America, being careful not to crinkle the glossy magazine page, and stared at the ceiling, alone, waiting for it to pass.
Tony was already moving; he slithered over to Steve and in an instant was in his lap, pressing into him, clinging to him.  Steve could feel his body trembling. Tony huffed against Steve. A confusion of terror and arousal coursed through him. Once again, he was forced to conclude that heats were not nearly as fun as he had previously thought.
Steve sat cross legged on the bed as he picked his way through fish and chips, and a prawn cocktail.
Steve's vision was fuzzing at the edges. He let Tony lead him and push him into the car. The flashes from the media's cameras still lit up the car windows. He shook his head, screwing his eyes shut and opening them again. He curled his legs against his chest, slumped back against the seat. He wheezed a little.
"This is the twenty-first century Buck. There's cameras everywhere," Steve breathed, taking another sharp turn with ease. "You have a mobile, right? Please drop it out the window. They'll be able to track it."
"Good choice," she smiled, still looking a little dazed at both of them. "I'll back in a moment with your drinks."
Tony shrugged off his jacket and undid his tie and shirt buttons, kicking off his clothes until he was in his underwear before flopping onto the bed with Steve.
Steve seemed to gathered himself back together and exhaled softly, straightening up in his chair. Malick didn't look happy.
It was well into the afternoon before Judy found Steve.  "Hey, Captain. ...you didn't break for lunch, did you?" she asked, leaning against the wall of the dorm to sip on her bottle of water.  Steve was helping another pair literally turn over mattresses. Every inch of the place was being upheaved and scoured; Brent Walker, the lawyer, had explained to Steve that they needed enough charges that, even if the institutions were found innocent of one or two, they'd be able to get them on the others.  "Steve. Take a break," said Judy, putting a hand on his arm. "All the kids are back at the camp and quite a lot of them have been asking after you." Her mouth suddenly turned up in a tiny half-smile. "Also, your mate... he was just bailed out. The, ah, headmaster is charging him with assault. He seems happy about it."
"Mine," repeated Tony eagerly, loving how readily Steve's body responded to his, arching into him.   He'd peeled off his clothes quickly, easily; he threw them aside, his eyes never leaving Steve's, his whole body tense with anticipation.  He practically attacked Steve's mouth; he reached down automatically to check if Steve was ready but he needn't have bothered; he could smell Steve, smell his arousal; it was also
75% of all property in a divorce proceedings. (Steve had been using Google a lot). And in the past six months 79% of Omegas who'd wanted to get abortions were unable. The reasons offered differed between states but usually came down to finances; omegas struggled to keep jobs ("heat leave" was only a legally recognized right in 11 states) and were, on average, paid far less than their Alpha and beta counterparts.
. They were all betas in that too. "I'm really bad at this, aren't I?  ...Aria said I should get treatment for PTSD, like...for a soldier," ventured Steve.
"You moron," said Pepper affectionately.  "...they have Barnes's name on them... how on earth could you--"
Tony nodded across the courtyard.  A man and a woman, both Alphas, were seated with another woman, an omega.  The two Alphas were having an animated, pleasant conversation and wearing matching wedding bands.  The man's hand was on the omega's thigh; she was listening placidly, one hand over her heavily pregnant stomach.
He was not supposed to think of himself as "he."  He was not supposed to think.  His programming was bad; soon, they would take him-- it-- to the chair.
me you were bonded.  You think I wouldn't maybe want to know that before I took you?  You don't think maybe that's the sort of thing your mate's entitled to know?"
Vim and Vigor stayed shoulder-to-shoulder; Vigor looked alarmed as he followed Tony.  "Are we in trouble?" he asked.
Steve knelt down in front of him to meet his gaze and Donner looked alarmed. "Please," he whispered. "You gotta see this ain't right. All we're doing is trying to protect you Donner. Because we're scared for you, scared about what's happened and what will happen if you go back to him. But we can't
England had banned the camps they were looking into with Project 84 back in the nineties. It seemed America had some catching up to do on that front. And stuff like conversion therapy still existed for homosexuals and acers and the like. Again, it was banned in England. Although they did seem to have some gross old Alpha groups, like the 'Bullingdon club'. They weren't perfect. And they were
. There had been a flicker of recognition, something... something which had made him loosen his grip. He wasn't just a monster- there was a part of him left in there.
"Tony. I don't want you to hear it right now," Steve whispered, running his fingers through his Alpha's hair soothingly. He wasn't in the right state of mind; it would just take Tony even more upset. And he didn't want him to... to think about what had happened before. Heats were supposed to be special, intimate. But it seemed they couldn't have one without someone taking advantage of it.
Steve moved to place his hands on the bed, bending forward a little in the process, his ass in the air. He gave it a little wiggle as if to silently tell Tony to
Steve shook his head. "I know Bucky's scent. I wouldn't mistake it for something elses'. Not even a relative, Tony. It's like how...I'd always recognise yours," he pointed out awkwardly.  "I would never get you and Howard mixed up."
and the main thing keeping him from doing so was the knowledge that Steve could wrestle him to the floor like a kitten.
"Hey. Hey it's okay. I know you're sorry. It's okay Tony I promise," Steve said in a mantra of words and moved to pick him up in one easy movement. He carried him into the bedroom and set Tony down on the bed before going to fetch a towel and wrap around him. Steve curled the towel around his shoulders, putting himself in front of Tony's distant gaze so he could see him. He was still wet himself but it didn't matter as he wrapped his hands around Tony and rocked him gently.
The process left Wanda exhausted; on the planes, she spent most of her time with her head on Pietro's shoulder, sleeping like she was dead.
want a quickie?" he murmured playfully, acting shocked.  "Since when did you like to live so dangerously?" (Steve, unlike Tony, had a strict habit of getting to appointments on time.)
Steve was grateful once they were alone. All he wanted was to be in bed. He dropped down onto the mattress, hands bunching up in the sheets. He sighed. "Do you think Rhodey would ever date another Alpha?" he asked, simply desperate to talk about anything
"Just insane," George said. "He won't stop cooking for me. He's a terrible cook; it's very awkward. Once, I refused to eat his lasagna, and he started crying. But he cleans a lot, which is nice. He's a 'nice' person, I guess. Very excited about the baby too.  He keeps talking about birthing pools..." George pulled a face. "But he stopped talking about 'Giddy' about a week or two ago. So I guess that's something."
"Four... three..."  The cameraman mouthed the last two numbers, two and one, then pointed to Steve and mouthed that he was live.
Tony was trying to peek into the chapel; when the woman moved he got a whiff of something... odd.  He looked over at her, examining her critically. She was protesting to Judy, saying she didn't know what this was about but couldn't just hand over the kids to a stranger.
"Well, we've kind of got our hands full at the moment," Steve pointed out with a quiet, forced laugh that was soon echoed by the rest of the table.
It was such a simple question.  No one had ever asked him that before.  Yet he didn't known the answer.  He felt confused and upset that he didn't.  Was he?  At times he'd almost felt like he and Karpov were pair-bonded.  They were, after all, inseparable.  Karpov had been his handler for as long as he could remember.  But they were both Alphas.
His hands trailed down to cup Steve's balls, roll them around a bit, gently; Steve was still eagerly riding Tony; Tony waited for him to clench against before grasping his member again to jerk it.  They'd gotten good, really good, at coordinating their orgasms, something Tony considered was evidence of a strong relationship.
Tony couldn't take her word for it; he threw down the bottle and darted into the living room.  Steve and Phil were touching; Tony practically slammed into Steve and then took a snap at Phil.
Steve tried and failed not to laugh at the sight- "Sorry. I just....you look so unimpressed down there." He tucked his head over the edge of the bed and winked when Tony glared up at him before laughing again. "It's cute. Really."
Those were the two worst words he could have imagined hearing.  He kept his gaze steady as he explained what had happened.  There was no way to sugar-coat it.  He was incapable of lying.  The conclusion was simple: he had failed.
"--the problem is that... with betas... I don't have to care about them.  I fuck them and that's it.  No... no commitment.  With omegas I feel... when I'm around
"Steve, here..."  Tony reached over to pour some syrup on Steve's waffles.  (Steve wandered back to the table and seemed excited to discover a few uneaten ones.)  Tony leaned in too close; his mouth began watering and it had nothing to do with the food.  He felt his cock twitch.
"Where are we going now?" asked Bucky.  They were in an airport terminal in France.  Pietro was watching the news, trying to figure out what was going on.  There was a lot of talk about
"I apologize," repeated Tony, quietly, more calmly, more sincerely.  He cleared his throat and reached up to rub his arc reactor awkwardly.
The man grinned maniacally as he was hauled to his feet.  "...you lose, Stark!" he said, laughing hysterically.  "Not-so-invincible Iron Man!  ...you lose!"  He burst into a fit of laughter and Tony stared at him, completely and totally lost, the beginnings of a killer headache starting behind his eyes.
"Oh, thank you," said Tony breezily.  "Uh, about the knot. You can... take that out, though, right?  Let's say, hypothetically, you didn't want to leave it in... maybe you... had somewhere to be or something..."
"There's coke in the house?!" Steve looked mildly horrified. He was mildly stunned and Tony easily slipped out of his grip.
He wished Steve hadn't gone to Yemen, either, but it was his fault.  He had pushed his omega away. Like a fucking idiot.
Tony stared down at his fingers while Steve talked.  He had mixed emotions about Barnes. Instinct was telling him that this other Alpha was a threat to be reckoned with, and Tony's more conscious insecurities were glad that Bucky sounded so broken.  But he also felt some degree of sympathy. Not just for Barnes... for Steve, for whom Barnes was one of the only remnants of his past.
It felt so right. Steve felt so at peace. This was where he was meant to be and this was what he was meant to do. Steve moaned.
"Tomorrow, you wanna go see Churchill's war rooms?" asked Tony.  "I know you've already been there but I think it'd be cool... and then you can choose the next thing to do... as long as it's not Trafalgar square..."  (The last time Tony had been there, a pigeon had landed on his head. Tony was not a fan of pigeons, who probably carried all sorts of germs. Pepper had gotten a picture, which Tony had made her swear never to show anyone.)
Tony looked out the window.  Surely they were nearly there.  He was starving; he hadn't realized how tired he'd been.  While Steve was off making speeches and wooing the media, Tony had been in the shop, diligently trying to perfect the Mark VII without breaking any more bones.  His right hand was out of commission for at least three months and he couldn't afford another setback like that.
"He got me Cheerios," Steve said, offering absolutely no context. They were the honey flavor, too; the box that had been murdered at Steve's old apartment had been plain.
"As a matter of fact, he is," said Tony.  He let go of Steve's hand, but only to wrap his arm around Steve's waist and drag him closer to him.  "Who better to benefit from an Expo that showcases the wonders of the future than Captain America, right?  And I think I speak for every progressive, forward-thinking American when I say that I wholeheartedly support his stance on advancing omega rights.  It's that kind of dynamic, modern thinking that helps us move forward as a society, and helps our best and brightest, regardless of status, really shine in the tech market."
Sam sniffed the air.  For a moment the two of them were frozen, huffing the air; Tony's eyes were closed, concentrating.  But it was already gone.
Steve sighed and walked up behind him, curling a hand over Tony's before he could pour himself a third. "You need sleep, Tony," he murmured and nuzzled against the back of his neck. "Honeymoon period is about indulging ourselves in lots of ways- sleep is important too." Steve let eyes slip shut for a moment.
"--he wasn't my Alpha then and he certainly isn't now. Just because he put his mark on me doesn't make me his. So will people stop goddamn
Impossible, though, right?  That man had fallen to his death, apparently, decades before Tony's birth.  Tony wracked his brain.  A photograph?  Book?  Magazine?  Newspaper article?
Aria was milling among the sound technicians, SHIELD agents, and caterers, still tapping away on her phone. Sam moved to greet Steve properly, pulling him into a hug. "Hey man. Kind of excited. but also not sure what to expect tonight. Don't know how many of the rumors are true about Stark’s crazy parties.  Also, do you know if Colonel Rhodes is single?"
"Right.  The 'gas leak,'" said Tony.  "Aside from the Hammer program to reverse-engineer the suit, is there any other agency that's working anything?"
"I don't care," said Wanda.  "...anywhere but here. For your own safety, Pietro.  We have to get rid of him.  Now."
"Oh, thank Tesla..." he breathed, wrapping his arms around Steve and hugging him.  He let out a chuckle.  All that stress for nothing.  Natasha's fault, getting them all worked up like that.  "I told you, didn't I?  ...the media would kill me if I knocked up Captain America... I told you... geez..."  Tony pulled away to give his arc reactor a few whacks.  His heart was running.  He couldn't believe how convinced he'd been, for a split second, that they might actually be pregnant.
protect me. You literally beat Vanko down and then saved me from an explosion and then flew me to goddamn hospital, Tony," Steve protested with a soft sigh. "You didn't do
"...we were supposed to buy 'em together," he added grudgingly. But he knew Steve had only gotten them in the first place to make a political statement and crash Malick's conference, so he guessed he shouldn't care.
"Gross.  I like it," said Tony.  He looked over at Steve, whose ears were pink.  He could feel Steve's tension and he felt a pang of desire for his poor, sweet omega.  "...I..." He dropped his voice, trying to be discreet. "Listen, Clint, I'd be a shit dad.  I had such a shit dad myself, and--"
With the faceplate on, the world had opened up to him like an over-ripe fruit, dripping information everywhere.  His field of vision wasn't just the scene below him, but a dozen more things. Tags on the plants identified them; a small red circle on the ground was Steve, his name and a slew of information; floating text told him the time, the temperature, which direction he was facing, the air pressure, air currents, humidity, outside visibility; a bit of text popped up in the corner to tell him he had three new voicemail messages, but once he'd read it, it vanished, replaced by a small floating red circle with an X through it.  The amount of symbols and text floating around shifted with his eyes, never blocking his vision, always just on the periphery.
Donner beamed a little.  "No!" He rocked Granite slowly while she suckled, one small hand flailing and eventually grabbing the hem of Donner's shirt.
Tony's brain, usually quick to comprehend, took several seconds to appreciate what Joey and Steve were talking about.
"Every day, Tony," she teased, kissing his cheek, leaving another mark on his skin.  "Are you going to suit up later?  Jenny and I were hoping Iron Man would put in an appearance..."
Tony growled softly, but it was a friendly noise.  He and Rhodes went back far enough that Tony didn't feel especially threatened by him; Rhodey was like an older brother.  It helped that Rhodes had maintained a respectful distance from Steve the entire time he'd been there.  It was a conscious effort.
Of course there was some bad stuff.  Speculation on which Alpha was dominant.  Plenty of forums and boards where people called Tony a homo.  He'd expected that.
"THEY HAD TELEPHONES IN STEVE'S DAY!" yelled Tony suddenly from the living room.  Clearly, he'd been eavesdropping.
"Well, first time for everything," said George after a moment.  "Champagne's a hell of a drink to start with, huh?"
Tony snuck a peek at his watch and was grateful to see it wasn't long before they wrapped up and turned over the show to the performers.  He knew that the "babies" question was going to come, though. Probably at the very end. He'd been steeling himself for it. The answer was, of course, "Steve's still young," with was a vague "no" and also a bit of a joke.  The perfect answer.
"Gleason said one of these every hour and then ten of the white ones every twelve... dear Lord, that's a lot..."
Tony's eyelids were already feeling heavy.  "Yeah... it's got... pretty strong... output... electromagnetically..." he said, struggling to stay awake.  He looked over at Steve.  Sleep was clawing at him, trying to drag him under.  "See you soon, Rogers," he slurred quietly.
"How come there's no coffee?" demanded Tony, deciding to ignore the fact that Steve was strong enough to lift a two-hundred-pound barbell with one arm like it was nothing.  His eyes roamed over Steve.  His biceps were glistening with a sheen of sweat; he looked ready to tear out of the shirt he was wearing.  He had no idea why a guy of Steve's build needed to train but he figured it was some weird military thing.  He assumed Steve might wonder the same thing if he walked down to the shop and saw Tony soldering together circuits.
"You sexist, close-minded, shit-eating misogynist!" snarled Pepper.  "Donner wants to have his baby and he's not going to let some selfish pig like you take it away from him!  Donner's a good mom and more of a man than you'll get be. Now get the hell off the property-- it's private and we
"Teamwork isn't something you're born with." Steve pointed out quietly. "You have to learn it, and you have to want to learn it. We're a team. I'm the leader, sure, but it's a democracy- not a dictatorship. The key is communication and respect. And you'd have to respect me as an omega and a captain. Do you think you really could?" Steve asked softly, voice empty of judgement and more curious than anything else.
it!" said Banksy.  He was wearing a lavender suit with a bright gold tie; he dropped into an armchair with a kick of his legs, shaking back his tiny ponytail and grinning.  "You are brilliant, Steve, oh my God,
"It's fine," Steve assured him. He could feel Tony's own guilt pang in his chest and he felt bad for his mate. Ty did have a point, however. He wasn't blaming Tony solely, he was just making the point that no one did anything. All it would have taken was one person and he could have gotten out sooner.
Kitty reached up and took off the the platinum collar when Steve appeared to be struggling with it and went to gently place it back in the case. Lydia obviously wasn't prepared to get as hands on and Steve was oddly glad; the woman seemed like she held something back that Steve couldn't put his finger on. And it wasn't just her status. Behind her eyes there were questions; she was probably curious about why captain America would want a collar, of all people. But she wouldn't ask- that would be bad business.
"I would love to name it after him," Steve murmured and ran his fingers through Tony's hair before kissing his forehead. He leaned their heads together for a brief moment and sighed, feeling a chunk of Tony's anxiety float away at the touch.
Steve.  I'm kidding.  That was two years ago, it's not a big deal," said Tony uncomfortably.  The only way he was able to think about this stuff at all was through a lens of humor.  Sarcasm was his best defense; Steve's expression was serious and that worried Tony; the last thing in the world he wanted to do was get serious and forsake getting a blowjob.
"Stop smelling weird," said Tony, voice cracking, and he felt his eyes suddenly get watery.  He reached for Steve and buried his face into Steve's collarbone, mortified with himself, hoping Steve hadn't noticed and already feeling guilty for making a request that Steve couldn't possibly accommodate.
But truthfully, Tony wasn't much better.  Steve's pheromones played him like a fiddle and Tony doubted he'd be able to deny Steve any request.  Tony would have thrown himself over a cliff with barely a hint of hesitation if he thought it would help Steve get off and improve his chances of mating.  His body had decided self-preservation, dignity, and basic comfort were no longer concerns; they'd all been replaced, entirely, with satisfying Steve.
yet?  ...no, actually, you know what? You choose. You have a big speech tomorrow.  Whatever you want. Even something... animated and
Tony frowned, considering this.  "Y'know, you're like, the second or third meanest Russian currently in my life," he said after a moment.
The moment Tony's mouth was on him Steve arched up. "Shit, Tony!  ...not gonna last like this. Oh-oh G-God..." Steve's eyes rolled back in his head and he stiffened, clenching around the toy before he came into Tony's mouth. He rode out his orgasm with small thrusts of his hips.
"Yeah, I mean... we weren't supposed to talk about sex. People like to think of you being all pure and stuff, which is pretty stupid. Because
"W-where's my arm?" he asked suddenly, panic rising in his voice, and for the first time since the forties, he realized his left arm was missing.
"World's favorite superhero?" repeated Tony.  "Oh, that's great; thanks a lot, jerks.  I dedicate myself full-time to being Iron Man and I've practically stabilized the Middle East, but sure, let's hear it for Stars an' Stripes over here."  He was half-joking.  He was much more interested in this omega psychologist.  Was she an omega?  You couldn't tell in pictures or on the television, something Tony often found disconcerting.  He wanted to ask if the guy on the fridge was an Alpha, because if he was, Tony might have to kick some ninety-year-old ass.  But Steve's tone when Tony had asked about him in the first place had held some sort of quality that had made Tony hesitant to ask anything else.
"Oh my God, Steve doesn't want to talk about that stuff right now!" scolded Taylor, giving her a friendly slap on the arm.
"Do something!  Do something!  They're going to kill each other!" yelled Pepper.  But no one tried to interfere; sticking a hand into an Alpha fight was as dangerous as sticking a hand into a dogfight.  Steve had once watched Bucky get into one and he'd had to have a hose turned on him.
Gleason nodded slowly and looked over to Tony. He could see the tension in the alpha's shoulders. Slowly, the doctor set his bag down.
Trickshot looked worried.  "His-- his full name's Clinton Francis Barton, we were born in Iowa.  He's blond?"
Before Steve knew what he was he was turning around and kissing him. He smiled against Tony's lips. "So," he murmured and bit down on the alpha's bottom lip softly. "What do you wanna do for the rest of the afternoon, huh?" The way Tony was simply looking at him was making him feel hot all over in plenty of different ways.
The sensation hit him out of nowhere.  He'd been in a phone booth (phone booths were surprisingly difficult to find for some reason), making his way through the Cleveland yellow pages.  There were only six Karpovs listed and none of them were Vasily. But of course Karpov wouldn't use his real name. So now the soldier was just calling every Russian name in the book.  He was on page 16 of thousands of pages and progress was slow because he had no money and had to call collect.
"Hiya," said Tony, reaching out to shake Sean's hand.  Sean looked scandalized. He was wearing a red wristband.  "What's with the wristbands?"
"We asked him!  We asked him if he was bonded and he said no!  None of the reports from the forties mentioned it.  They would have mentioned it, wouldn't they have?  Wouldn't Lukin had mentioned it?"
. Tony knew he was going stir crazy inside the house as it was. The only thing getting him out at the moment was interviews and jogging; it was September and the only thing he had to look forward to was the stupid talk show interview in
Rhodes waved a hand dismissively.  "I'm fine, I'm totally fine, I'm on administrative leave until the investigation is over."  He took a few steps toward the table Tony was standing on, clearly ready for Tony to fall over.
Tony tried to respond to her but just made a noise, a noise he didn't even know he was capable of making, a half-growl, half-moan of longing.
"We figured Aria would delegate out the tasks to us, and we'd be able to get the whole thing off the ground for you, while you're being harassed by the government," said Jeff.  "Oh, and Brent's got a legal team all set up for you and Tony."
, and it felt like coming up for air. He gasped sharply.  His senses were reeling.  He felt like he'd just stepped off of the Cyclone on Coney Island.
They were in a van parked on the sidewalk and there was a fire on the beach.  There was a third person there.
. Of the drag of Tony's fingertips and the wet heat of his tongue. Steve could feel himself responding down
God, Tony, are you kidding me?  You've got all of Steve's omega friends and about six reporters down there and you're peacocking around with a girl on either arm like you're single--"
"...yeah, I think I saw that one.  Howard Stark and Obadiah Stane," said the lawyer, smiling.  "Howard was hilarious... Stane, not so much."
"I don't think you're Gideon's type," Steve murmured. "He might try and spent time with you, try and covert you or something but he definitely won't try and sleep with you," he assured him. When Tony had finished throwing up and drunk the water he held out a hand to help him stand.
"S-so are you telling me that every time I have a heat, Bucky is going to wake up?"  Wake up disoriented, alone, and scared.
He managed to drift off to sleep again. Steve was sleeping an awful lot recently; at least, it was a lot for
Steve's legs ended up curled over Tony's shoulders as he thrust into him again, meaning he was practically bent in half as Tony fucked inside. The serum meant he was flexible though, in many ways...much of which Tony hadn't even really seen. He still had to grip onto the sofa for support, his biceps bulging and quivering with effort as Tony ruined him. It felt so good. So
idea what a huge liability this is for the team?  If your brain thinks it's connected to the Winter Soldier?"
"Oh, he loved Maria very much, too.  No, there was never any doubt about that.  But it was different, you know. Her being a woman and Edwin being an omega."
"Stevie," he said suddenly.  He wasn't even aware the name had fallen from his lips until he'd heard it himself.  The moment he'd said it, though, he genuinely wanted to cry.  He hadn't felt anything this strongly in... ever, actually.  Not that he could remember.
to Steve; Steve's body was eager and willing, but he still took his time when he felt the base of his knot pressing against Steve's wet hole.  He moved his hips slowly, working it in as gently as possible.  His body shuddered when he finally felt Steve's body give, pulling him in, clenching around him; he whimpered unintentionally.  "Yes... oh... good... fuck..." he whispered, forgetting how he'd teased Steve earlier for saying the say thing.  His hands roamed over Steve's shoulders and arms, feeling the smoothness of his skin, the warmth.
The dust settled as he opened up a hole in the ceiling, and Clint, Natasha, and Phil peered down at him curiously.
Now he remembered.  Steve's old fling had gotten him tulips.  Tony stared at the flowers.  ...surely those weren't from...?
Upstairs, Tony slipped into the lounge, closed the door behind him, and settled next to Steve.  "I got you ice.  And medicine.  And this necklace," he said, setting then on the floor beside the couch.  Steve's smell was making his mouth water.  "...you gonna be okay?"
"Pizza sounds great!" said Ian enthusiastically.  "I have a meeting with Mr. Stone in--" He checked his watch.  "--two hours, so let's hustle."
"...one time, when I was three, I read in this science book that an egg was so strong that you couldn't break it on the axis.  So I took an egg into Dad's workshop and put it in a vice... turns out you can totally break an egg in a vice. I guess they meant you can't crack it by hand."
Tony wasn't even sure why he had wanted to come in the first place.  He didn't know Clint or Natasha; he wasn't an Avenger.  He'd just wanted to spend more time with Steve.  But they would have a hell of a time explaining why Tony was there at all.
Tony grinned.  "Yes. Yes it does.  So afterwards, we'll have to go take a shower together... or go skinny-dipping in the pool.  We can shoo out the reporters, if you want, go for a swim. Unlike the ocean, my pool is heated.  Should be a cool eighty degrees." (Steve had seen the steam rising off the pool into the cool night air earlier.)  (Tony had absolutely zeros qualms about being naked in front of his party guests; he'd probably slept with a good third of them, anyway.)
Tony cleared his throat.  "Let's sleep, Steve," he said quietly, stroking Steve's neck, nosing his hair.  "We'll deal with SHIELD in the morning, then we'll go home, and... I dunno.  Maybe we can get through the week without any more bullshit.  ...Seriously, I swear, I don't normally get attacked more than once a month. This has been a busy week for me..."  He tried to sound light-hearted, but he couldn't help but worry that he was putting Steve in danger.  What could he do, though?  Steve was a soldier; he would always be in danger, as long as he was fighting, as long as he was with SHIELD.  It wasn't Tony's fault Vanko had come out of nowhere.
super old?" Steve pointed out and Sixteen blinked and pulled her face in thought. "He attacked me. I didn't even know I was carrying a whelp. But my friend got hurt too, I took him to the hospital, and then blood started running down my leg, and then I realized. It was pretty horrible."
He grabbed the box of pills off the table and fumbled with it, but managed to shove a blue one into Steve's hand and a bottle of water into the other.
The press release was as boring as expected, and as cheesy as the lines Tony had produced before. Steve didn't really remember it, nor was he especially aware of what he was saying. He remembered hearing Tony's voice, and then his own, and thinking that the lights around them were too bright in the living room - couldn't they see the huge, windowed walls? There was enough light in here already. It was a nice day outside. They didn't need any more lights.
"No.  You're not a freak.  You're amazing," murmured Tony, reaching up to touch Steve's cheek.  "...thanks," he added, grudgingly.  "...I didn't mean to fight him, I just... when he said that... I snapped.  Steve, you're perfect.  You're better than perfect.  And we both know, even without the serum, the real you... you're a fighter.  You're a leader.  They chose you because of your spirit.  You're the most badass omega ever.  That doesn't make you a freak.  It makes you a fucking
"The beach will empty. The house won't be," Steve pointed out softly. "But try and drink some water and sober up Tony. At least a little, for my sake."
"I can't wait to be home and in bed," Steve murmured. And he felt like, oddly enough... even with Bucky, and the conference, they were going back
It was pretty typical of Tony to get distracted and flirty when they had somewhere to be in an hour.
someone."  He passed the program to Steve to pluck a drink from a passing waiter.  "Any workshops that look good to you?"
Dr. Brennan looked disapproving.  Being an Alpha, both Steve and Tony sensed it; Tony glanced at her and his neck prickled.  "...you guys can go now," he said dismissively.
how the mind works.  That is why you can't even control him, you think you can just rewrite a person's brain like it's a storybook."
"--oh, really, Level Seven clearance?  And what good does that do you if you're losing track of the captain every other day, huh, Jasper?"  He slammed the phone down. "Incompetent idiots," he muttered darkly.
"...fits like a glove," he joked, seeing her eyeing the gauntlet.  He passed the drink to his unsheathed hand and flexed his fingers, listening to the gear whir quietly.  "...not bad, right?  I really want to get into models that self-assemble, though.  Can you imagine if they were
"He's dead already." Steve murmured as they pulled up outside the office. He looked up and gave Tony a grave look. "I can feel it in my bones. I just don't think we'll find him in one piece, Tony."
Tony pulled out his phone and checked.  "Yep.  Aria released it.  We're ready the rock n' roll," he said, and offered Steve his hand.  Steve took it, and together, they stepped forward.
"De nada.  I don't have a visual on Clint.  Primary objective isn't visible.  I'm going to go around the front.  ...that okay with you, Cap?"
She looked across the lot, watching a few people unloading a set piece off the back of a truck.  She knew that Aria's question came from a place of concern, but what else could she say? Tony's life had never had the slightest bit of normalcy or consistency, and he was emotionally stunted, immature, self-absorbed, and had terrible judgement.  This was the longest monogamous stretch Pepper had ever witnessed; Tony's relationships usually lasted an average of two or three months and ended in an explosive fight that often involved alcohol. Steve had been an incredible stabilizing force, but no one person, super or otherwise, could reverse decades of damage.  She was rooting for them, but if she'd been asked to bet money on everything working out neatly... well, she wasn't so sure.
Trickshot's face broke into another smile.  "You mean I've been getting the crap kicked out of me for twenty years trying to go save my little brother and he was doing just fine this whole time?"
He stalked back toward the quiet backstage area, still pressing the cloth over his split lip, furious with Steve for breaking up the fight and furious with himself for not doing more damage when he had the chance.
The elevator chimed and the doors slide open.  Tony pushed Aria out of the way to wrap an arm around Steve's waist.  "You did great. Seriously. With all the shit he was saying to you, you really kept your cool, Steve."
A moment later he was holding an omega against him.  And for the first time since the whole mess had started... Justin actually looked afraid.
The rooms were numbered.  Steve was poised in front of room number 1 like he was in the midst of a very suspenseful gameshow.
"Who gives a shit?" she said and Steve blinked. "Doesn't matter they thought about you. You kicked ass and now they're all dead."
Steve kind of missed wearing Tony's robe in the morning, even if his own one was softer and fit a lot better.
Steve wasn't sure what they'd give Tony, either. Any tech they could give him would barely be able to rival Tony's own goddamn phone. The hamper was heavy when he was handed it. Wisdom gave them a toothy smile. "And congratulations, of course."
Even though they'd slept on the plane ride over, they fell asleep again, their  bodies curled together.  It was already so early that pre-dawn light was filtering in through the west-facing windows.  Tony only slept a few hours before he was waking up, and it was already morning, and he felt disoriented and shitty.
Tony staggered away with a lot of good-natured good-byes to the other Alphas, letting Steve drag him up to the room, feeling dizzy and content.
A door slammed; the asset turned with excitement.  Karpov was striding over, but he was no longer in his uniform.  He was wearing a coat and had a duffel bag over his shoulder.
.  But it didn't work that way.  Steve's body had pledged its allegiance to the other Alpha and nothing sort of death would change that.
Steve was interviewed by a nice beta man named Marcus. He had a high pitched lilt to his voice and wore a plaid jumper and skinny jeans, along with glasses that were too big to his face. He was friendly and polite and welcomed Steve with a handshake, telling him it was an honor and that he liked Steve's scarf. For the interview itself he led Steve into a small room, pointing to a sofa for him whilst he took an arm chair for himself. On the way through the Times building a lot of heads had turned; it seemed Steve's arrival had been highly anticipated.
He was barely aware of Steve leaving and barely aware of him returning.  He looked up as Steve pushed a mug of coffee into his hands.
Tony didn't protest; he took the water and drank it gratefully.  "Okay.  Fine.  ...what's your problem with Pierce and Malick?  I can feel you, you know.  If you were an Alpha, your dander would've been up."  (Omegas lacked the muscles Alphas had on the back of their necks; if they'd had them, breaking the bonding gland would have been rendered impossible.)  "Aren't they SHIELD guys?  Or something?  I think they're Fury's bosses."  He leaned into Steve, throwing an arm around his waist for stability.  "...is he gonna be okay?" he asked worriedly.
"I'm sorry I threw up on you," he said, tone lightly teasing and that drew a finally genuine smile out of Pepper, even if it was only a small one.
"You see, this sort of insolence, this Ludheim doesn't have to deal with, this is why she doesn't care if we let all your programming go to hell.  You used to be so much better and now you're constantly asking questions.  You've been out of cryo too long and you've become annoying."
"Creepy as hell, if you ask me.  Just leave him alone. They'll end up banging on their own, once he snaps out of... whatever
"...yeah, you be my messenger.  She'll kill me if I tell her myself.  I think this'll be the third time I blew off that meeting..."
The date is December 31st, 2010, which means that some of Taylor Swift's songs are anachronistic... but the titles were too plot-relevant not to put in there.
, I thought-- Christ...."  Tony grabbed the edge of a table to stabilize himself, reaching up to press a hand to his arc reactor, panting.
Tony was curled into an impossibly small ball with a mountain of sheets enveloping him.  "Titanium's boiling point is like three higher than samarium," he informed Steve groggily.  He sounded like he might be waking up.  "And that's why Rhodey can't sing Stevie's part."  Or not.  Even in his sleep, Tony's brain clearly jumped tracks smoothly and frequently.  His eyes opened groggily again and he smiled at Steve.  "My omega," he murmured lovingly, closing them again and curling up even tighter.
Tony gestured in the air.  "But, okay, courtship, that's for pair-bonding, right?  Let's say they're
And Steve.  Steve was losing it. More than losing it; actually, he felt just about ready to have an angry cry. But he didn't want to do that in front of Pepper and Aria and Happy too. Maybe it was a little arrogant to expect Donner to be
The omega beside him looked young too. He was ginger and pale, freckles littering his cheeks. Sera grinned lazily, completely unashamed of his nakedness and the fact that he was very turned on. His arousal hit Steve the moment he'd broken down the door; he was in full heat. "You know," he grinned. "This is just like a dream I've had."
DeSoto looked at Steve with a sad expression as Tony gently put an arm around Steve's waist and tried to lead him away.  "C'mon... don't say anything... c'mon... just come..." muttered Tony out of the corner of his mouth.
They remained knotted for a half-hour; by the time Tony's knot had subsided enough to pull out, he was able to get erect again, and the he went right back to pounding Steve into the mattress.
"No.  I'm here to pick up Donnie," said Gideon.  He leaned to the side a little, to look over Tony's shoulder.  "Hello, Donnie."
Every Saturday, Steve went to the base, and every Saturday, he had an induced heat. They used the dart he'd kept from the fight to recreate the inducer to the point where it was almost identical. The only scientists around were betas. Clint opted into the same treatment as Steve. It was good to have him back, at least on the weekends. After all, there was no one else Steve could do this with.
Tony followed Steve into the hotel and they crept up to their room.  The bed was freshly made and the headboard had been replaced already.  There were fresh flowers on the table in the living room. For some reason it all felt very perverse, how neat the room was, and the two of them standing in it after what had just happened.
Steve's breath hitched as Tony squeezed at his firm buttocks and he couldn't deny that he was aroused. His eyes darkened a fraction, especially at having Tony so close with his breath tickling at Steve's neck. "I think I get the picture," he breathed, voice soft as sin.
While Tony had no real interest in doing anything other than  limping around the house and fucking Steve as much as possible, he wanted Steve to get what he wanted.  He was willing to bend over backwards for him; he had expected that Steve, who was only a couple of weeks away from turning 93, would have all sorts of weird old-timey traditions he wanted to do.  So far, they'd been so busy bickering and trying not to get killed, they'd barely had time for anything else.
"I know it's hard for you to understand as an Apha, Tony, but I don't really think of you in terms of... 'dominativeness'. And I certainly don't compare you, to anyone I would never do that.  And I don't know where you get the idea that you're not very dominant from. You're literally always in charge in the bedroom and I'm always goddamn putty in your hands, Tony. And I know you don't see it like this but screwing Captain America is a pretty ballsy thing to do, if you think about it. That's something Bucky couldn't do, not even when I was big. So please stop comparing yourself to him because you're incomparable.  Don’t stack yourself up against other Alphas; they ain’t the ones I’m bonded to. And I didn't mate a bad Alpha, Tony." Steve murmured. "I wouldn't have. And it's okay to have bad thoughts, you can't help that… but you gotta understand when you complain about wanting women... that doesn't feel good. That feels pretty shit. That's literally unattainable for me; I can't look like one or ever be one. It messes with a guy’s self-esteem, Tony. If you really don't think you can handle this monogamy thing, then that's okay, you just can't expect me to stick around to watch… I've been through it once before and my heart can't take it again Tony. It just can't."
His left arm was numb.  He woke up because the truck had stopped, and he blinked groggily.  He flexed his left hand, trying to get some feeling back into it.
"Just lay back... just relax, okay?  You're pleasing me... feel..." said Tony, sinking to his own knees in the water and pressing his cock against Steve's thigh.  "Feel that? That's how pleased I am... you're a good boy, Steve... you're my good boy..." He reached out and ran a hand over Steve's wet hair.  Both of them were panting a little.
"Yeah.  Time to go," he agreed, trying not to dwell on what Steve had just said. Tony struggled to capture a sense of peace, of happiness.  He had to be confident.  Had to steel himself for the upcoming media onslaught.
This was an ongoing conversation.  Bucky would often ask about feelings.  Sometimes, Wanda would point to a person in a magazine and say, "She's happy," or, "He looks concerned."  Bucky would take notes. The whole thing was exhausting to the twins, but at least it provided a distraction.
Steve's eyes had been closed. He hadn't really been trying to sleep but he'd figured just resting would be nice. And if he didn't at least look like he was sleeping then Tony was unlikely too. But then the other asked a question and Steve's eyes fluttered open again.
. I can't feel it anymore; I didn't know. I swear to God, I swear...I would have told you if I thought it was still around. I don't want another Alpha.  I want
"...I'm just going to be glad when this all dies down.  We're basically drowning in orchids.  I wanna go back to being Iron Man," said Tony, closing one eye to concentrate on screwing down a small bolt.  "Didja find a time for us to go do the simulation thingy?  ...if it's all the same to you, I would prefer if Natasha weren't there.  ...the thing is, when you... when you're around other Alphas, you kind of size each other up, and she's... well, let's face it, Steve, she's a total badass.  Not that I'm intimidated.  I just... I don't want to do it in front of another Alpha."
"Don't make this awkward, Doug.  Scram," said Tony, pointing toward the living room and, beyond it, the front door.
Joan and Maria were both beaming.  Tony couldn't help but feel a bit jealous.  He sometimes forgot about how buff Steve was, how good-looking.  Tony was used to being fawned over, but the two Jameson omegas barely seemed to notice him.  On the bright side, John being so friendly with them had clearly impressed everyone in the immediate vicinity and they were getting a lot less glares from Alphas.  Some of the omegas were watching Steve with interest, clearly a bit more relaxed now that Joan and Maria had broken the ice. Plus, Malick had stormed off. Tony would take giggling Captain America fans over Malick's malice any day.
You didn't have to be a math genius to figure out that, with six appointments, if Tony got the VIP treatment at each one, he would have imbibed eighteen glasses of scotch by the end of the day.  Tony wished he and Steve had talked more about what they wanted before going on this excursion; he didn't think even he could handle this much alcohol and braless redheads being thrown his way. No doubt all of the other jewelers, each vying for business, were going to try to get on his good side with similar techniques.
"Ah!  Ah, ah, ah!  Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah!" said Tony in protest, darting after Steve.  "Hey! Wait! Wait-wait-wait! Stevie!" Tony fell into step behind Steve as he wove through the mass of writhing bodies, pulsing to the music.  The lights had been lowered and he was at least getting less attention, though people were still excitedly calling out to him. "Steve! Hey! Look, I'm sorry, it didn't seem like a big deal!  Look, you know I'm a big idiot, c'mon, I didn't know it was bugging you that I was hanging out with Ji-Yoo-- she's twenty-six, by the way-- but now that I know, I won't put my arm around her anymore, I thought that was okay!
Pepper crouched on the floor by Tony, who had balled himself up against the side of one of the couches and was breathing heavily.  Her hands were out and open in submission. "Tony... Tony, it's me... you're home. Tony."
Trembling and sweating slightly, Tony took Steve's hand and let him haul him to his feet.  After all this time, he was still in awe at how remarkably strong Steve was, at how easily to pulled Tony up, like a parent swinging a child.
Steve looked over his shoulder.  No one was there. Had there ever been?  Was this some sort of screwy flashback? A side effect of the SHIELD subconscious simulation thing?
"He didn't," Steve assured with her with a wry smile, watching Tony clutch at the pillow with a fond sense of amusement. "And yes, much better. My head doesn't feel like it's going to fall off anymore."
Tony cast a desperate glance over his shoulder at the nest, deliberating which was the fastest way to get to Steve.
"You can love someone, even if they treated you badly," Steve said softly, not entirely sure why he was saying this. "It doesn't make you any less of a person. It just makes them an idiot for not seeing it."
Steve was still trembling as he got out of the car. It was like he was drunk or something. No. This felt better. When Aria grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the house he moved easily, despite his size. He was pliant right now; it came with the pre-heat phase. He was rambling about something in French. An old poem that Falsworth taught him. It was something flamboyant about death and war and it was all very meaningful, Steve assured her when Aria said she had no idea what he was on about.
Christine was pulling out a tape recorder.  "Is this the first time you two have seen each other since--"
Steve was only vaguely aware of them pulling into the driveway, the group of protestors outside thinned considerably. Maybe because of the late hour or maybe because of today's events. Steve couldn't be sure.
Yes, that was likely it.  The soldier was not really used to having chit-chats.  He mostly just agreed while Karpov monologued. But he felt like he needed to say more than merely "yes, sir" to this poor omega, who was hurting so bad that it was actually making
Tony grinned at him while pulling his phone out. “Ah, but I have a well thought-out argument to convince you.” He tapped away at his phone for a moment before holding it out to Steve.
Things got a little fuzzy for a while as Peter drifted a bit, he was pretty sure Mr Stark was talking to him, but he couldn’t focus on the words. What could have been hours or just minutes later there was suddenly a lot more people around. He was sure that the Black Widow was asking him where he had been staying. He told the possible figment of his imagination that his class was at the Bright Angel Lodge in a bunkhouse and the figure promptly vanished so he guessed he must have imagined it. Then a while later his teacher Mrs Skinner was kneeling next to him and gently touching his shoulder.
Tony grinned back at Steve pecking him on the cheek. “Yep, he just gained eight extra Uncles and two more Aunts and there’s nothing he can do about it. Poor kid won’t know what hit him.”
Howard motioned two of his men forward to take his wife to the car and gestured his third man to him. “Jarvis, take my son in the second car with you, get the baby seat from my car.” Jarvis nodded and took Anthony from the shaking nurse and left the room.
Steve let out the laugh he was holding in, grabbing Tony’s face in both hands. “No, nothing like that Tony, you just keep surprising me. You put a lot of thought into this trip didn’t you?”
“I get that Steve, I do, I just thought that it might be too long a hike in the heat for both Morgan and me. I thought we could get a different view from the air then just have a short hike from the landing meadow to the river.”
Peter nodded, panting breathlessly his eyes never leaving Tony’s. Tony glanced up at the lookout railing and it was only at that moment that Peter realised that another pair of hands had joined his in holding the little kid. He followed those large hands up, muscular arms to the grim face of Captain America. He blinked uncomprehendingly at the face of his other idol, then turned back to Tony when he heard him speak again.
He pulled back to see that Tony had a look of something like horror on his face as he looked over Steve’s shoulder. As Steve started to turn, Tony uttered a breathless word that made his blood run cold.
He was intensely curious about his father's and Jarvis's bond.  With both of them dead, he had no easy way to look at it, aside from old records.  Unfortunately, being an omega and a servant, Jarvis wasn't in most of them. When he was, he was regulated to the background.  There was zero indication they were bonded, except one photo of Obie Tony found where his father and Jarvis were in the background, slightly blurry, their hands possibly touching.  But that was it. As for other records, there was no bonding certificate (which meant, thought Tony with relief, that it had not been arranged, at least), and no income records for Jarvis at all.  He was like a ghost.
The growl Tony let out trembled over the surface of Steve's skin. He was busy trying to catch his breath back, his cheeks pink and flushed, blue eyes dark with lust and something more. Steve curled his arms around Tony's neck, fingers tangling in the dark, thick hair at the nape on instinct. He needed something to hold onto. When Tony kissed him it was languid and Steve licked into his mouth, unafraid to explore as his body adjusted to the intrusion. When the alpha drew his mouth away Steve had even pinker cheeks than before.
wasn't grammatically correct and Karpov had warned him that Americans in particular clung stubbornly to their unhealthy love of democracy.  It was like an addiction, he'd explained.
"We're kidders, we like to kid around, Tony's my buddy," explained Justin.  "He's great, he's a great guy, he's gorgeous, you know... a gorgeous mind..."
"Mmph," replied Tony, mouth full, waving Steve away dismissively.  He had said his part, let Steve know he was respected... he didn't want to go on and on about it.  Worse, now he felt guilty about his drinking.  Tony didn't consider himself an alcoholic, even though he did shake a little if he went too long without it.  But he was a functional drinker and functionality had always been Tony's top priority in accessing whether something was good or bad.
"Okay..." Steve frowned a little when Tony suddenly stood, his words blunt and tone detached. He didn't protest. He had a feeling that if he did Tony wouldn't listen. Before Steve could worry a moment longer, however, his phone was ringing in his pocket.
After stepping outside the hotel, he picked a direction and walked in it, his feet taking him towards Brooklyn automatically before he even realised where he was going.
"Yeah, Dad put on a good face for the camera," said Tony, eating the crust he'd managed to isolate from the rest of the pizza.  "He was
.  Tony felt a sharp pang in his heart and winced a little, knowing Steve probably felt it, too.  "Sorry," he muttered. "Still getting used to it."
"Steve, when... when you were in heat... we were both out of control..."  Tony fumbled with his words. "...your old mate..." Tony took a deep, shaky breath.  "He was... he was a... more dominant Alpha, wasn't he? Sometimes I... feel him..." He tapped his chest.  He buried his face deeper into Steve's chest. "Steve... Pepper... Pepper says... but... but the thing is, Steve..."
Eventually he came to a resolve and called the number. A sharp, female voice answered. "Who the hell is calling at this hour? You better have a good-"
"I'm going outside of SHIELD. I can't trust SHIELD with this. You know as well as I do, Captain, just how riddled with rats we are."
Pepper rubbed her eyes, confused.  "No... no, not that I'm aware of. I suppose they can get nest possessive, but not really
Within twenty minutes he was showered and boarding the jet, setting the coordinates before he began preparations for setting off. Steve was dressed in jeans and a hoodie, nothing special. He'd left Tony a note on the bedside, just so he didn't worry. He honestly couldn't wait to see his friends again; Steve had missed them more than he could express.
"Did you know omegas had twice as many scent glands in their necks than Alphas?" said Dr. Gleason conversationally.
"Of course I can.  You're my omega, aren't you?  Come on." Gideon turned and began walking back to his car.
Clint sat down and attempted to set Lila down, but she began crying again, and so he sat at the table with her in his lap.
Would Tony love an omega child?  Yes, of course he would. Tony had been born an Alpha and had spent a brief and unhappy childhood, particularly post-puberty, feeling like he had to live up to his father's dominance, and always falling short.  It had been stifling. Tony felt that, as an Alpha of very low hierarchical standing, he was more than capable of accepting a child that was an Alpha of equally low standing, or even an omega. It was a new generation, after all.  Omegas weren't second-class citizens anymore, at least in theory. Omegas could get educated, get jobs, be independent, be fulfilled, be happy, productive members of society... Tony knew that even if he failed as a parent in every other sense, at least status and gender wouldn't especially be an issue for him.
"...thank you so much for your help, Francine.  Please forward me the referral and also, if you could send a link to a donation page, I'd like to contribute to your school for its upstanding work.  Give my regards to Ms. Turner," said George. Francine thanked him and he reached over to press a button and end the call.
"Is that your main regret?  That your actions affected others?  Because they certainly affected you as well."  It was unclear if she meant Steve being in trouble with SHIELD or if she was referring to the bite on his neck.  Because she was an Alpha, there was no doubt in Steve's mind that she could smell the fresh mark. Of course, even if she were a beta, Steve's records had probably already been shared with her.  She likely knew more about Steve's condition than he did.
"Plus one of the guys on the board was sent to a conversion camp as a kid that messed him up real bad.  I think they're got every right to be a bit more militant," said Phil petulantly. "Anyways, the Horseshoe Society is pretty much run by just the one councilman, Jeffrey Walker, and he hasn't been very active lately."
Tony was dead asleep and didn't move as Steve got into the sheets. He shed down to his boxers and then curled up against his mate, trying to ignore the thought of DeSoto outside. It didn't take him long to actually drift off in the end. It had been a very long day...and tomorrow would be even longer. And Steve was worried. if he couldn't get through to
Tony's dander rose.  In fact, it spiked like it hadn't since the last time he had been fighting in the suit, in Yemen.  The collar pressed down on the sensitive hair, and it was painful enough to make Tony's eyes water slightly.
"Rex," he returned awkwardly. He stared at Steve's hand for a moment before eventually shaking it back. He gripped Steve's hand tightly. "I saw you in the audience today. Didn't think this place was your kind of...scene."
"The what?" Steve's nostrils flared a little and when he went back to Trickshot's room. And then he saw it. "Jesus Christ," he muttered.
"I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound rude, but why is someone from SHIELD personnel getting involved?" Steve asked, ignoring their initial spout about self-destructiveness.
He didn't have time to recover; he was yanked back up and slammed down again.  Augmented reality was down; the screen was mostly static.  The suit couldn't handle the amount of electricity that was being dumped into it; the other man's reactor was, at a glance, probably producing about as much power as the Three Gorges Dam, and unless Tony could deactivate it, he was royally screwed.
"Steve... I know it's hard to admit that our statuses influence us but... c'mon.  That breakdown wouldn't have happened if it weren't for..." said Phil softly, glanced down at Tony.  Fury, Hill, and the other two agents were attempting to pull them apart; Tony was snapping in between extremely creative curses and everyone was trying not to get bitten, without much luck; Hill had already taken a bite to the hand.  "...instinct and emotion plays a bigger role in our lives than in betas'. That's just biology," said Phil, softly, as the betas in the room finally managed to pull apart the Alphas.
Steve moaned wantonly as Tony's teeth sink into his mark. Thank God. It felt like he was being truly reclaimed- especially after that dream. He was Tony's- the Winter Soldier couldn't touch him here. He was safe. He rocked up into Tony's thrust best he could, whining and whimpering loudly as his alpha stretched him open. Steve panted and his back arced up prettily, his cheeks flushing a darker shade of pink as he felt the edge of Tony's knot tease at his hole. Steve gasped, clawing at the floor uselessly. His own cock was furiously hard and leaking against his stomach and sometimes got dragged along the floor when Tony thrust in particularly hard. Steve let out desperate sounds as he felt himself getting closer, clenching around his alpha's cock as he encouraged his knot inside. When his knot finally squeezed inside it was like all the air had been knocked out of Steve's lungs.
Pepper decided to switch the topic.  "Danielle McDavid seemed nice. Are you planning on following up with Status Alliance?  Tony mentioned you and Irshad hit it off in D.C., and I always thought she was more involved with the Horseshoe Society."
"Captain. Mr Stark," JARVIS said again. Was it possible for an AI to sound impatient? Steve was beginning to think it was.
"Oh-- oh, no.  No. This is my cousin and his mate," said Donner quickly.  "And this is... um... Al?"
He focused on licking Steve's hole, tonguing it, letting Steve wiggle under him, Tony's arms wrapped around Steve's legs so he couldn't move too far away.  "Mmmm," he repeated, licking wetly as Steve whimpering above him.
Tony glanced over as Steve threw his phone against the wall.  "That wasn't nice," he said lazily before turning back to the movie.
Tony went back to his salad, actually eating it now, relaxing a bit.  No one else came up to them, but there was still the occasional click of a camera phone and, in one particularly irritating moment, a flash.
"You can come over," Steve murmured after a beat. "I don't have a spare room though; you can take the couch," he offered quietly and thought about them sharing. Thought about pressing the curve of his body up against Tony's under the sheets and blushed darkly. "Or... whatever."
He reached for Tony's hand and pulled him down to peck him on the lips. Tony's intelligence would never cease to be attractive.  Overwhelming, but attractive.
The word "king" brought to mind, at least for Tony, a man in furs and codpieces and a big gold crown.  The Wakandan king was a regular man. He was wearing a regular suit. He was sitting at a table with another, younger man, but rose when they entered.  The rest of the restaurant was empty except for all the security all over the place. His hair was just beginning to grey but he still had a spring in his step, the vitality of youth.  He shook Steve's hand before turning to Tony, who was slightly irked at his omega being greeted before him.
. The difference is, you could be a product of your situation, and you might be happy... and even if you screw up along the way then it's okay, because
Tony burst into giggles at the sight of Steve's box.  "Oh my God. This is so cute." He picked up a large silicon penis and wiggled it at Steve.  "...they're all knotted," he observed with a small smirk. "You wanted Alpha cock." He examined the dildo in his hand.  It had to be about eight and a half or nine inches. "...dear Lord. This thing is ridiculous." He looked at the other dildo in the box.  It was even bigger, girth-wise. "Are you insane, Steve? ...you're gonna give me a complex. Bend over," he added, still holding the one he had been earlier.  "I want to see you take this whole thing. I want to knot you with it and then jack you off." He laughed, running a hand over Steve's thigh.
"Yeah," agreed Tony quietly.  "Sleep." He folded his arms over his chest, his chin down, listening to the steady beeping of Steve's heart monitor.  This was probably the most the two of them had ever talked about these serious issues: Tony's trauma, Steve's ex-mate, and Howard, the line that connected the two of them.
Confusion was settling even harder into Tony's gut.  "Well, we came here together, remember?  How are you going to get home if I leave now?"
Tony could barely keep his hands off Steve while he took his pills.  Steve's whole body was clammy and shivering.
They'd patched up Steve's hand, removed the glass and wrapped bandages around it. Steve was all cleaned up and then moved into an MRI and then an X-ray. If Doctor McCloud noticed the extra scar tissue on his neck she didn't mention it. They'd given him new hospital clothes. They were white and awkward-fitting but it was better than nothing.
It was hard not to be excited by their presence. They practically radiated the fierce, stubborn attitude that Steve treasured, and he couldn't help but be thrilled. Whilst he was sure this sort of thing, or something similar to it, must have existed in Wakanda in the forties...in America, this would have been unimaginable. And it still kinda was. Omegas weren't typically allowed into the army, and even if they were allowed in as doctors or cooks they certainly weren't allowed near the front lines. But these omega women looked terrific and deadly and strong. Steve could see the soldier in their stances and he liked to think they could see it in his too. He even met one woman's gaze and he was pretty sure she smiled at him. It was hard for Steve not to grin back.
him either," Banksy said. "He can sell you again any day he chooses to Donner. You need certainty and you need stability for your baby, and that isn't going to happen with Gideon. He thinks with his stupid knot, not his heart. He doesn't treat you like you deserve to be treated."
Tony found himself thinking about Banksy ad Boswell's relationship.  Boswell was about thirty years Banksy's senior, and it must be difficult for him to stay up late having parties.  Tony wondered if he and Steve would ever end up like that. Physiologically, Tony was about fifteen years older than Steve, and Steve didn't look like he was someone who was going to age normally.  At forty, nearly forty-one, Tony felt perfectly healthy and capable of keeping up with a much younger crowd, but he worried. Steve looked like a fuckin' co-ed.
He'd felt a little odd ever since Steve had said he wouldn't be Tony's omega on the battlefield.  The fuck did that mean?  Tony had mated him, fair and square.  Steve was his omega at all times, wasn't he?  Even though Tony hadn't initially wanted an omega, now that he found himself with one, he had a certain set of expectations.  And Steve was breaking all those, and then some.
"He said, 'Don't try and stop me.  I'm gonna walk to Iowa if I have to.'  We're in Rhode Island, and I said to him, 'come on, Tricky, you're being crazy, listen, your brother's probably not even there anymore, just calm down, if you behave yourself, maybe Alpha'll take you to the next one.'  And Tricky said, 'no, I don't care, I behaved all week for that-- that
He gets down on one knee and pulls a ring out of a pocket, holding it up to you. At this point, your vision is so blurry you can barely make it out, and you nod, hand over your mouth to stop the sobs, before he’s even said it. A laugh bubbles out of him, then recedes into a smile oozing with tenderness.
Life tends to swerve and get turbulent, especially when you're a superhero. But some things are a constant, you learned.
There are times when you are the one toeing the line, when the world spins around his determined face as he speaks words that don’t reach your ears, clinging to you like he’s ready to fistfight death were he to decide to take you away from him. It’s almost like another dance, the one you’d dance as everything crumbles to dust and fire licks your skin and he is the last thing you see before you close your eyes.
You stand on tiptoes to kiss him again, but wince at a sharp pain right below your ribs. There's no need to look at him to know the look he's giving you.
He asks, reluctant but confident, and you're too shocked to answer before he carefully lowers your hands from your eyes and takes them in his own. And, just like that, his hand is on your waist and your hand on his shoulder, both of you swinging slowly to the sound of distant traffic, gentle breeze and static buzz of electronics.
“Before I met you, I- I was lost. Everything was just… too much. And then you came.” His face splits into a smile so full of love you have difficulty resisting the urge to kiss him. Tears start welling up in his eyes, and you feel your eyes filling up as well.
You've done it infinite times since then, in your bedroom and workshop, on rooftops and pavements, surrounded by trees and long stretches of sand and foaming waves of an ocean.
He's looking up at you, face beaten, bruised, swollen. His eyes hold nothing but accusation and anger, anger at
The first time you dance, it’s soon after a day of fighting a flock of very stubborn aliens. You put the weight of the world on your shoulders when you realize the only way to win is if you risk your life, most likely losing it in the process.
Tony leaned it to nuzzled Steve's throat.  "There's at least one thing I wanna do today," he purred.  Suddenly he paused. "I mean
"Look, can you drive?  I want to stay with Steve," said Tony, who remaining flattened over Steve, clinging to him desperately and unwilling to be more than an arm's length away from him.
Steve's fists were balled up around the couch's fabric, threatening to tear it.  Tony let go of one of Steve's wrists and slipped his hand under Steve's stomach, finding his erection and wrapping a hand around it, jerking Steve in rhythm to his thrusts, Steve's precum warm and slippery on his skin.
"It was a wake-up call alright," Steve whispered. "He's trying so hard. He's been so...good about it. It's almost scary. He tries to touch my neck so I know it's okay but I..."
. When Phil had said he was a keen 'nester' he hadn't been joking. Blankets from all over the house, along with cushions and even toilet paper had been molded around chairs and even a table to make a sort of den. It was almost tall enough for a man to stand in and several meters wide either way. Phil had gotten some kind of music playing device inside and was currently blasting out S
Steve moved to sit on the edge of the bed, still feeling sick beyond belief. He couldn't think. He didn't want to imagine--
"We just stopped by to check in... it seems we both thought this would be a good time," said Dr. Brennan with a smile.
For the first time, Tony was glad Steve was going to be spending Saturday with Clint in some middle-of-nowhere safehouse, just to get away from the media for a while.
A lot of people were still looking at him. Were they supposed to approach him or was he supposed to approach them? God, Steve hated this.  He was a soldier, not a celebrity.
... he didn't hurt you, did he?"  It was a ridiculous question, but Tony reached out and shoved up Steve's t-shirt to check his stomach.  There wasn't a mark on him. Several people cheered at Steve's abs.
Tony held Steve, considering.  Should he try to do that?  ...Gleason had said it was tricky but Tony was a fast learner.  Frond's words were echoing around and around in his head:
He realized he was worried about Clint now. What if he got hurt? Or worse killed? The tesseract had done enough harm. Steve screwed his eyes shut again and just focused on his breathing.
Tony smiled a little when Steve observed his height.  He had determined he was a solid five inches shorter than Steve, and the suit more than made up for that.
"Sure, sure," said Tony, scribbling one more autograph before letting Pepper and Steve drag him off.  He eyeballed Pepper as she and Steve murmured to each other.  He liked Pepper a lot, more than he cared to admit, and it didn't sit well with him, the idea of her and some uppity, unpaired, too-independent-for-his-own-good omega ganging up on him.  Tony loathed feeling like he was nothing more than some little performing show dog who had to be directed and coached.  He'd run the company fine before Steve, before Pepper, even.  Sure, he had fun, he liked to drink and schmooze, but it wasn't like he was a moron.  He knew what he was doing.  He'd been groomed since birth to take over Stark Industries; even as a child, he'd been used to the press, to the delicate world of sound bites and headlines.  He'd practically been a mascot for the company: Howard Stark's genius boy, the prodigy, the wunderkind, the soon-to-be heir of the biggest weapons manufacturer in America, bar none.
"I'm not talking about trios, Natasha. But I'm also not willing to abandon someone whose been my friend my entire life even if he did..." Steve trailed off. People forgot Steve had known Bucky since he could remember. They hadn't always been bonded and fighting each other, and even once they were bonded, they had good days. Very good days. Bucky had been a part of his life longer than anyone else had. "He needs me now. More than--"
He was out of the bathroom in twenty minutes, toweling off his hair and loping toward the stairs to suit up.  Steve's shield was sitting by the door. Tony had tried to pick it up, once. It was a lot lighter than he'd expected.  Maybe the weight of a bowling ball.
Steve smiled, feeling so very stupid for feeling left out the night before. He needed to get his emotions into check sometimes. "I'd like that."
Steve loped down into the garage and took bike over to his apartment. It was a little ways away so it was about ten by the time he arrived.  It was a pleasant day; Steve drove without a helmet, enjoying the wind in his hair  He was hungry but he knew there was an unopened box of cereal left in one of his cupboards still. Steve took the steps two at a time, forgoing the lift. When he got there the door was open. He pushed it open to see Fury sat at his dining table. His apartment felt so small after living in Tony's for so long.
the American flag," Aria said, rolling her eyes as he neatened out Steve's tie for him. She had him in a midnight blue suit and a crisp white shirt underneath with a black tie that was a little on the thin side. He looked well put together; his hair had been re-combed.  It looked no different to Steve but Aria insisted it was "better."
"Anyway, I hope you have a good day Tony. I just thought you should know," Tiberius said, sounding a little tired.
"He wanted to call the baby Grant, but then it was a girl," Steve tried to explain as they piled into the back; Tony laid out on top of him.
While he carefully sculpted his goatee, he thought about what Steve had said.  A test run might be a good idea.  Maybe SHIELD didn't know everything he'd been through, but his own mind did, and Tony had only just wrestled his panic attacks under control in the last year.  The first few months that he'd come back had been brutal; the only people in the world who had witnessed him in a flashback were Pepper and Happy, and both of them were sworn to secrecy.  Tony wanted a heads-up if any of that was going to rear its ugly head during a psych eval.  After all, no one had put the guy with the metal arm in Steve's brain, but there he was.  The subconscious was a murky and unpredictable thing.
Aria sighed. "If you turn up with something not designer it might be perceived as a little... rude. You're already both wearing collars. You'd be pushing it, Steve."
Better to do a test run with Steve than to try it for the first time in front of Fury and all the rest of them, though.
The crowd laughed good-naturedly. Steve felt mildly disturbed. Did most of the Alphas here not get their omegas off during sex? What was
Soon they began talking about dates and locations and Steve's mind admittedly switched off. This is what he paid Aria for, after all. And every appointment was made with a strict reminder.4
He reached up with his right hand to hold the other's wrist, then nuzzled against the back of his neck.
the exhibition but Tony was clearly delighted. Steve was happy to follow his Alpha around. The smile on his face and the light in his eyes was totally worth it. Steve noticed a few people staring but most people seemed to be leaving them to their own devices. They passed one corridor and there was a kid who looked about ten who was practically staring at Steve. He gave the boy a little salute and his face lit up. Then Steve had to march on ahead to find Tony in the part about keys...wherever the hell he was.
Ah, yes.  Aunt Peggy.  Another one of Dad's old pals.  Somehow, Tony had never pictured her as being drop-dead gorgeous.
Steve's chest seized a little. He was one of those optimists who still thought people were inherently good. But they could still surprise him, it turns out. "That's kinda amazing," he murmured and Aria went quiet for a brief moment.
He poked his head into Steve's studio.  His old arc reactor was glowing from the wall and Steve was sitting beneath it, clutching his phone.  "...hey, Stevie," he said wearily. "...don't worry, they'll leave once they realize it's just us. Come to bed.  ...don't worry about this; he's just trying to mess with us. We'll be in England in a couple of weeks anyway... we kinda need the break, huh?"
Steve smiled as Tony passed him and ran his fingers through his hair. He watched his Alpha walked to the door, admiring the curve and dip of his back before he rolled off the sofa. He tugged on his boxers and shirt and then wobbled to the door. He felt a little tender down there after...everything. Steve sighed and ran a hand through his hair himself, dragging it out of his eyes. He blinked at the sight.
"...believing in people really isn't my thing.  It's yours," said Natasha bluntly.  "But in this case, Steve, it's not a strength.  It's a weakness.  You can't let a tulip delivery make you sympathetic to a HYDRA agent.  The Winter Soldier isn't a sympathetic person.  Hell.  He's not even truly a person at all.  Don't forget that."
Steve sighed in relief when Tony started stroking him. It was hard to really buck up into the touch with Tony stuck fast inside of him but somehow he managed it. He moaned quietly in appreciation, eyes only half open as he teetered closer and closer to the edge. The pleasure of it burned low in his belly and he didn't quite have the same urgency as before when Tony was eating him out, but he was still very much desperate for it.
