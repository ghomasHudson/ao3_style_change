Dean toyed with the edge of the blanket. “I’ve been thinking about that. Now that Roman is gone, there’s no need to continue pursuing justice for Benny, right? I can stop, take a breath, decide what it is I really want to do with the rest of my life. Doesn’t have to be investigative work, right? Could be, but doesn’t have to be.”
She frowned slightly, looking him over. “You do look a bit tired. You need to stop staying up too late reading. It’s not good for you. But in any event, it’s not me you need to apologize to. The Director, however, that might be a different tale.” She shook out his coat in the hallway before hanging it on the hook just inside his office door. “You had a visitor today. The Director wasn’t pleased that you weren’t available.”
“Dr. Novak.”
“Cool!” Charlie explained. “All in the same crockpot, though? Don’t the sauces get all mixed up?”
“Thanks. Anyhow. He’s thinking of staying?” That was interesting. Dean hadn’t really thought Hester’s city-boy family would have any interest in the property. Part of him was disappointed. Not like he’d be able to afford the place himself anyhow, but… if it had come up for sale, he would have at least tried.
The caverns echoed weirdly. He carefully made his way about one hundred feet deep, keeping his hand against the smooth cavern wall, before he started hearing the low murmur of voices over the sound of the water on the rocks. The darkness was frightening, but there was just enough luminosity from lichen to allow him to make his way forward despite the lack of a lantern.
Castiel looked around and sighed. “No. It’s… well. It will take a great deal of time to restore the books to their proper places, and more importantly, to assess how much damage has been done to them, and how much they might be repaired. Or what can’t be repaired.”
He’d barely looked around when the back door opened and another man – had to be Castiel – walked in. Dean couldn’t quite hold back the half smile of appreciation. Dude was hot. Dark hair that it looked like he’d tried to tame, but still stuck up here and there. Tall, fit. He and Gabe had very little in common as far as looks. And then the guy looked up and met his gaze, and holy hell, his eyes were
Cas twirled a noodle around his fork to buy a little time. “No one has ever asked me that before.”
“Grandmother.”
“Whoa.” He’d been roomies with Cas for years, and this? This might be the most frightening expression he’s ever seen. “You could probably zap me to green goo with the strength of that glare. Sit down. I’ll get us beers, and you can tell me what’s got you in a state.”
* * *
“Ah, Dr. Novak, right on time,” he said, sounding surprised. That was entirely fair, Castiel had to admit. He tended to get lost in whatever he was doing and lose track of the time. If it were not for the lunch with Dean he likely would have been late today as well, but there hadn’t been enough time after his return to truly fall into his studies so deeply that nothing else penetrated his awareness.
Maybe… maybe this was a time to take a chance.
“Didn’t know he was married. How about that.”
Charlie grinned at him and gave him a fist-bump. “Awesome, dude. So bi? Mostly the ladies because it’s just easier?”
Gabriel accepted the invitation and eased inside, sitting down on the floor in front of Castiel. “So. They’re gone. Mikey and Luc. They didn’t want to delay returning to Chicago. I’ll stay here with you while you figure out what’s going on. Okay?” Gabriel was usually loud and obnoxious, but he could also be gentle and soft with Castiel, when he needed it.
Cas doesn’t know why that makes him tingle inside. Of course? Of course.
If he was a different man, Cas would cry about now.
It was getting harder to concentrate.
Dean snorted. “Happens when your dad takes off for weeks at a time, leaving you on your own. Ellen and Bobby looked out for us once they realized what was going on, but that hadn’t happened yet at that point.”
Dean swallowed again. “You don’t want to get a job out on the west coast? High powered firm in the big city? San Francisco, Los Angeles?”
Today he was wearing a navy suit with a white shirt and blue tie. It was the one where the jacket didn’t fit quite as well as it should. Dean knew all of his suits. He had five of them, one for every day of the week. Three of them were navy. The only one that fit really well was his charcoal gray suit, the one he usually wore on Wednesdays.
Cas nodded. “There are few things that can top a good cheeseburger.” He glanced over to Dean, a smile lurking in his blue eyes. “We could go to Burger Heaven. And top off the meal with a slice of celebratory pie.”
“Both. Well, separate plots, mostly likely, though there are certain flowers which serve as natural deterrents to wildlife nibbling on vegetable seedlings. I should likely start with a small plot, learn what I need to. I’ve never grown my own produce before. It’s probably too late to special order particular seeds or plants, but I can get things that are common to the area, and learn what I need to know. Apparently there are quite a few things to learn. Things like soil density, the nutrient balance, how much to water things… and different plants have different ideal treatment, though many can do quite well even under less than ideal circumstances.”
Castiel felt hot, which was ridiculous given that it was late February and the heat in the house wasn’t really keeping up with the cold outdoor temperatures. Likely the insulation was one of the things that would need work.
Cas touched his nose, confused, then shook his head quickly to clear it. “Yes. Clean nose. Understood.” He reached out, then, touching Dean in the center of his chest. “Thank you. This is very important to me, and I appreciate what you are doing. Thank you.” He hesitated a moment, then leaned forward and placed a quick, chaste, kiss against the corner of Dean’s mouth, then turned and slipped out of the small room.
“As a matter of fact, yes, though I didn’t have long to study it.” Castiel admitted, feeling mildly disgruntled. He knew many ancient languages, but he was particularly fascinated by Enochian, perhaps because of its very rarity, as well as the scholarly debates about its origins. Unlike most languages, it wasn’t clearly devolved from a particular geographic region, and its linguistic roots were hotly debated in academic circles. “The texts we examined were in other languages – Greek, Latin, some Assyrian.” He tipped his head to the side. “You’ve asked me why I was at the Roman estate, but why were
“Something warm and natural. Dean suggested cherry; it’s a hard wood and very durable, as well as being beautiful. I want something more traditional. Somewhere that I want to spend time, somewhere welcoming. Nurturing. With enough space to make food preparation easy.” He was vaguely aware that he was getting dreamy. That could be alarming, exposing himself that way, his desires and vulnerabilities, but… it was Gabriel. Gabe might tease him, might say the most outrageous things, but he’d never actually hurt him deliberately.
“Why just the two oldest? Why’d the other two get left out of it?”
Cas looked around. “Can we speak somewhere more private?” he asked, his voice dropping into an even lower register. That voice did something to him, caused a shiver at the base of Dean’s spine, and a quick wordless fantasy of listening to that tone in an entirely different context.
“Would you, though? Really?” Charlie asked. “If it was just one date?”
“Noted,” Cas said, reaching out to pat her lightly on the shoulder. “I won’t report you to the office.”
Once they’re seated, he leans closer, so close that their arms are touching along their full length, from shoulder down to where their fingers are still twined together. He pulls Cas’ hand over to rest on his thigh, and leans closer to brush a kiss against the shell of his ear.
The streets were relatively quiet tonight, likely because of the chill. The temperatures were certainly warmer than the dead of winter. Havenport could be dreary during January and February, but soon there would be spring flowers, and the last of the snow would disappear. Castiel spent most of his time indoors, given the delicate nature of the books he was usually working with, but when he indulged in reading less valuable books for pleasure, he liked to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine and the sound of the sea.
“So. Cas. What brings you here today with this idjit?”
“Okay, close your eyes,” Dean said when they got to the hallway leading to the kitchen, before the turn that took them into the room.
“Okay, so obviously I don’t know all that much. But news gets out. The Walker dragon was killed, looked like another dragon took him out. The security cameras weren’t working for some reason, so there’s no footage of it. Still, there aren’t too many things that can break a dragonkin’s neck when in draconic form. So there’s that.”
“Records are also available at the County Records Office, or they should be,” Adler countered. “Pull them for me.”
There were a few people out and about, though not many. A pair of men, likely farmers judging by the overalls and dusty work boots, stood beside a pick-up truck filled with bags of feed, chatting amiably. The one facing his direction nodded and briefly raised a hand in greeting without pausing in his conversation. Cas nodded back but made no move to cross the street or introduce himself, which seemed to be perfectly acceptable.
“Mm, yes. While Mrs. Albright was still drafting the will, actually, but again now that Cas is involved. She warned me that the will would have to be tightly written, because she expected her older nephews to challenge her decision to leave everything to the youngest.”
Friday afternoon found Castiel being driven through the gates to the mansion recently acquired by Mr. Roman, then escorted inside to a beautifully appointed private library. The walls were covered with mahogany bookshelves intricately carved with scrollwork and laden with books. There were comfortable overstuffed chairs, and tables holding artwork.
“This happens, sometimes. I don’t understand it, but I also don’t argue with it,” Castiel said. “When my mind is consciously occupied with other things, it seems that my subconscious continues to work through puzzles, and then when I am relaxed or content, suddenly the fully-formed thought will break through in a eureka moment.” He rapidly flipped through the pages, not as careful as he usually would be with the delicate old text, until he found what he was looking for. “Dean. Come here.”
The guy— Castiel? that was an odd name — gave her a flat look, but then turned back to Dean. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dean,” he said, and gave him an appreciative look, head to toe. Dean’s skin tingled under that regard.
“And voila!” Dean made the final stroke of the paintbrush with a flourish, stepping back to admire his handiwork. He turned to Cas, a grin on his face.
Dean was breathless when he broke the kiss, resting his forehead against Cas’. “More, please,” he whispered.
“The ones with the caramel?”
“Must you tell tales on me before we’re even settled?” Cas complains half-heartedly. First the tray story, now the one about him preferring to spend his time sketching crown molding patterns rather than playing outside.
“Not as much as I would like to. But gotta admit, I’ve got a fondness for Vonnegut.”
Cas was surprised to find that he was actually tempted by the offer. “Yes… yes, I will consider that. Thank you.”
“This. This is divine.”
“Well. Interesting story, that.” He ran his hand through his hair. “It was given to me by a young man who thought it was important. He wasn’t able to read it, either.”
“Fine. See a hot prospect, make sure they don’t work for Sandover before making a move. Got it.”
“Yes. There’s a pool not far, in an adjacent outbuilding. It’s not an Olympic sized pool, but it’s large enough to swim laps.” Cas stops, plays with the edge of the blanket. “And there is a tennis court, though none of us play it.”
Dean’s phone vibrated.
Cas enjoys watching Dean at the country club. Cas knows him well enough to know that this type of setting hits all of his buttons, everything that makes him feel inadequate and out of his league – and yet, almost no one can really tell. Cas knows because his smile gets brighter, his laugh louder, his body language more exaggerated.
“And Dean! It’s been a long time since we’ve seen you in person, though Cas has sent the occasional picture, of course.”
He shook his head, unable to form words quite yet.
“Hey, Sam.”
Cas met his gaze, arched one brow. “Are you thinking of holding out on us, Dean?”
Now he feared they’d portended something much more ominous.
Just that easily Cas joined the Quest for the Most Divine Lunch, as she’d started calling it. That first day Charlie gave Dean a look that surely must have inspired that saying about the cat that got the canary.
All these months that he’d seen the strange lights on the horizon, dancing green and blue with streaks of violet, to the north. He’d thought them odd, almost lurid, yet with a compelling beauty. He’d never seen anything like them before. Still, he’d never been much of a naturalist, so when his colleague had dismissed them as curious but likely some natural phenomenon, Castiel had accepted that.
Charlie laughed. “Well, we had to come here. It’s a tradition, right? The place to be when celebrating anniversaries.”
Dean scrabbled to pull the gag out of his mouth, throwing it to the side violently. “Cas!”
“It smells great in here. Thanks for having us. I brought some wine for the adults. And brandy.” Cas held out a paper bag, supporting the bottom. “Brandy has always seemed fitting for holiday dinners. After dinner.”
“We are indeed.” She lifted her glass to clink against his beer bottle. “You seem to be hung up on the anti-fraternization policy. Any particular reason?”
“No you don’t. Last year you made a face and pushed them all to the side, and some of them got stuck under your plate and stained Eileen’s nice tablecloth.”
Gabriel bumped their knees together and handed him a package of M&Ms. “You could,” he said thoughtfully. “This place is yours now. You work from home anyhow, and you make enough to get by. I’ve been thinking for a while that you should make a fresh start.”
Cas ran his hand through his dark hair, making it even more disorderly. Dean had to swallow, because shit, the man was hot and that didn’t do anything to lessen it. “The painting. ‘The Flight’. It is currently in Michael’s possession, but it is still Novak Hoard. The Walker Wing knows that its destruction would strike a serious wound. Novak is already weakened with Michael’s theft of the work, but that is nothing compared to the impact of its obliteration. And make no mistake. Walker would obliterate it.”
“I’ll come,” Dean says easily, standing up and holding out his hand to take Cas’.
Castiel watched him take a big bite, chewing enthusiastically. “’S’good.” Winchester was apparently a man who was open about his pleasures. That thought made Castiel shiver.
Cas stared at the ceiling of his bedroom, flat on his mattress. He’d mostly calmed down after the movie and then the ride home, but his skin still felt extra sensitive, and there was a vague sick feeling high in his stomach.
“They returned to Chicago?”
“Maybe.” He couldn’t deny that he’d considered it, but damn. How do you just go from talking about the latest details on the remodel to just dropping in a little ‘by the way, I’ve had both boyfriends and girlfriends, and the style of the plumbing makes no difference to me’? Big deep conversations weren’t his cup of tea. He hated talking about anything that smacked of emotions.
“Oh man, Cas, that’s not cool, dude. Not when your friend is a carpenter. Not cool. Tell you what. I can whip up something quick --  and don’t even start to say it. Bookshelves are easy as pie, man. Actually a lot easier than pie, because pie is hard.”
“That’s kind of a lot of effort. Maybe next time.”
There was something a little off about Cas’ tone, hollow and slightly distant. That revelation earlier about Cas’ life before he moved to Caroline was clearly huge, and also just the tip of the iceberg. There was so much that Dean didn’t know about his friend.
Dean was glad he was already sitting. “What? Why? I thought you liked it here.”
“Yeah?”
And oh God, oh God, how was he supposed to deal with the sudden realization that something he’d firmly held away as being impossible wasn’t so impossible after all?
“Not a lot. Not my job.” It was, perhaps, misleading. He certainly knew more about the collection than he generally let on, if only through osmosis. Bobby and by extension Sam sometimes fell into discussions about the royal art collection over beer and burgers, debating the significance of different works, and where they’d originally come from.
“So… what do you think about maybe getting together sometime, after Sam and Eileen are back, just me and you?”
“Yeah. You going to get a car, ever? I could hook you up with something from Bobby’s, if you just want something basic to get you around.”
Three more nights. They still had three more nights here. Three more nights of sharing a bed with Dean.
* * *
Castiel blinked at that, then nodded. “Yes, yes. You’re right, of course you are. I would be most displeased if any of my books were to catch fire.”
“That is the only delivery I am currently expecting.”
“Oh. Hm. Are… are you available to start on the other projects?” His tone was carefully flat and blank, which Dean found oddly encouraging. The fact that Cas was trying not to let any emotion show in his voice meant, had to mean, that there was emotion he didn’t want to show.
“Thought he was doing that yesterday.”
Cas’ smile grew wider as he imagined it. “Yes. Yes, it would be. Completely awesome.”
Cas nods, feeling his mood immediately improve. “You will like my grandmother. I’m glad you’ll finally get to meet her.”
Cas’ smile turned fond. “Claire is beautiful. I have some new pictures, if you want to see them later.”
Judging by the look in Sam’s eyes, yes. Yes, he had.
“Yeah, we talked about it about half a year ago, Dean, when we were at Bobby’s. Enoch River is, was, one of those communities that was destroyed. Never really made any of the news cycles because it was a relatively small rural community.”
“You’re a decrepit old man,” Charlie offered.
“Castiel!”
“I don’t know what to say, Dean. Maybe you should give him a call? Talk it out? Maybe it’s not as bad as you think.”
Cas looked around the turret room. It still wasn’t much. He’d relocated a small folding table and chair he’d found in one of Great Aunt Hester’s closets, setting them up as a work surface after cleaning the room as much as he reasonably could. Scrubbing the floor took time. Some of the spots on the floor he didn’t want to think about too much. Getting the roof replaced was not a project that could be postponed indefinitely, if there were the occasional small animal getting inside. He was fairly sure there were mice in the house. Perhaps he would get a cat. Or at the very least some live traps to set out. He liked mice, but that didn’t mean he wanted to share his living space with them.
“You okay there?” Dean’s voice was closer than Cas remembered, soft, quiet, gently capturing his attention without demanding it. It helped to ground him in the here and now.
According to the information in the book, the salt of the sea water needed to mingle with blood. Roman pulled forth a blade from within his robes, examining its edge with an unholy glee.
He missed the bleak look in Cas’ face, since the other man was figuring out how to fasten his shoulder belt. “Yes, I would like to meet her.”
“Cheddar sounds good.”
“Then I’ll stick with my own version.” Dean lightly slapped Cas on the shoulder. “What do you want me to do? Set the table? I brought the wine. Not even the cheapest stuff. You should be proud of me. I usually prefer whiskey. You drink whiskey?”
“Fair enough, and I’d have to agree. On first reading they seem like a straight-forward adventure, but then there are themes and shit that just sneak up on you. I like that they don’t shy away from difficult stuff, but that they’re still hopeful. There’s enough depressing crap going on in the world. I like to have some go-to fiction for when I want to feel good about something.”
She blinked, arching a brow.
Dean showed up soon afterwards, knocking before letting himself in. “Hey Cas. Oh my God, that smells amazing.” He came through to the kitchen, his nostrils flared.
He moved past to open the door.
Adler walked by then, stopped, and backtracked to Dean’s door. “Ah, Bela. There you are.”
Damn. Damn, damn, damn.
Cas swallowed and lifted his chin, forcing himself to meet Dean’s gaze. “In addition to my academic works, I also write some fiction,” he said, his heart pounding so hard he thought it might burst right through his chest. He’d read that phrase so many times, thought it rather over the top and exaggerated, but in this moment it felt real. “The fiction, frankly, pays immensely better than the academia. But it’s not something I’ve ever shared with anyone other than my editor. No one else knows this, Dean. No one.”
He can work with that. He’s had to deal with it before. Not often. Dean’s usually the one that has some sort of emotional crisis. Cas is the steady one, the reasonable one, the logical one. Dean’s temper gets him into trouble now and then.
Dean still wasn’t getting it. Cas knew he wasn’t being very clear, and yet… why was this so difficult to say? Why?
Maybe she wasn’t so awesome after all. Dean narrowed his gaze at her. “No. Of course not.”
“I can help with the cleaning.”
“Part of my job, son. You haven’t brought anyone home before. I have a lot of catching up to do.”
“Oh, oh, this is one of my favorite scenes,” Dean said, leaning forward. On the screen, the huge doors in the Hornburg opened, and Aragorn walked through, returning from the presumed dead. “He just looks so hot right here. Those eyes. And the scruff.”
“Yes, I did. What about it?” He jumped down over the front steps to land on the walkway.
Marketing and administration, to be specific.
“Sure!” Emma said, turning towards him. “Land of the ice and snow!”
“Guess so.” He caught that damned lower lip between his teeth.
He might not have shown up until Saturday, though.
Cas took a series of long, slow breaths. “Gabriel warned me they were up to something. He also told me I should inform you, which I didn’t do. I suppose… I suppose I was hoping that if I ignored it, it would go away. I know better. I really do.”
He pressed the doorbell firmly, listening to the chime inside, smiling slightly at the melody. Cas had insisted he wanted something far more interesting than the usual ‘ding dong’ sound — so he bought a door chime that played the opening bars of the Minute Waltz.
“I wouldn’t give you anything that couldn’t be fixed easily, in the unlikely event you didn’t do a great job with it.”
He’d seen how wonderful the large windows overlooking the garden were, with the transom windows above the ones that opened to catch the breeze and let the fragrance of the flowers and grasses inside. He’d felt his heart swell the first time he stepped onto his new patio, imagining the table and chairs he’d add, the grill as well, perhaps a water feature nearby so that he could listen to the sound of falling water. He’d helped to muscle the new appliances in place, handing Dean his tools as he installed them.
“What did you assign Cas? He’s still coming, right?”
Under Cas’ watchful eye, Dean stretched out and cracked an eye open. “Good morning,” he said, voice still rough from lack of sleep.
Castiel hesitated. Should he investigate? It was likely nothing of importance. Certainly he’d never heard anything quite like it before, but that didn’t mean much. It could be something as simple as one of the residents practicing some unusual musical instrument. Yes. It was almost certainly entirely harmless. Even if it wasn’t harmless, what was he going to do about it? Hit it over the head with his book satchel?
Dean took another look around. “Your family has. You are no longer a beneficiary of that wealth?”
He’s beautiful. There’s no other word for it. Absolutely beautiful.
Cas moved to Dean and touched his shoulder, allowing his fingers to briefly caress his neck before sliding down his arm and away. “Show me your final work, then.” He leaned in and brushed a kiss against his cheek, still feeling a little flutter of pleasure that he was allowed to do this.
“Perhaps I can offer my assistance as well.”
Dean has known, objectively, that Cas is from a wealthy family. There are the small things, the way he doesn't think twice before dropping money on whatever he wants when he decides he wants it. His thought process goes through whether he really needs the item, what benefits he'll get from it, whether it's worth the space it takes in his life, whether the quality lives up to his expectations. But while he might evaluate whether an item is worth what it costs, he never stops to think about whether or not he can afford to pay for it.
“No, can’t do that. Or… well. Could I time shift? Would you be okay with me coming over on Saturday?”
Dean, however… Dean fascinated him. He didn’t think he was imagining a connection between the two of them, the seeds of a friendship. At least he hoped he wasn’t imagining it. Dean might be this warm and inviting with anyone as a tool of his profession. That was certainly grounds to be cautious and not to get invested. Besides, Dean did not live in Havenport. When his case was finished, he would be leaving again.
“Excellent. Now that we’ve all been introduced, let’s get started with orientation. I’ll be walking you through the additional forms we need you to fill out now that you’ve been formally hired, and the Employee Handbook. The forms are in the front pocket of your binders. The Handbook is also available as a .pdf document on the company Intranet, but I find it is easier to review with a printed copy. Feel free to take notes, and ask questions at any time. These sessions are much more interesting as an interactive discussion than as a lecture.”
That evening, there was a soft, tentative knock on his door. That was weird. He lived in an apartment building with security. Granted it was rudimentary security compared to the palace, but still, it was security. He wasn’t expecting any visitors. Maybe it was just one of the kids in the complex, running around selling raffle tickets for some sport or another. Maybe girl scout cookies. He didn’t think it was the right time of year for girl scout cookies. Maybe chocolate bars? Those could come around any time of year. Ridiculously overpriced chocolate bars that weren’t even that good, but still, chocolate.
She rolled her eyes, looped an arm through each of their elbows. “Fine. Burger Heaven it is. But only because celebration or not, I can’t push
“Hey there Peanut,” he greeted Mariel, scooping her up and swinging her around. She giggled. Damn, but there were few things that sounded as wonderful as a baby giggling.
Zach rented out a pavilion outside of the clubhouse for them to use as a staging area and a place to relax between activities. It’s outdoors, but there’s a roof to protect them from the elements, and comfortable seating. There’s also a server on duty, ready and able to obtain drinks or snacks on demand. There will be a luncheon promptly at noon. Grandmother will be out for that, though she’s not spending the whole day on site.
(Or so Dean tries to tell himself, though deep down he suspects that if push came to shove, he might… might… choose Cas over Baby. It would be painful, though, and he might not ever truly get over it. Good thing that Cas would never make him choose. At most he’d push for ‘in addition to’, rather than ‘instead of’.)
If he’d only known just how much he was underestimating his friend.
There had been the weeks of practice working with flowers, taping and wiring and forming them into unnatural arrangements. On some level he objected to that. Personally he preferred wildflowers growing in their natural environments, not these hothouse flowers artificially bred for specific characteristics, fed dye to alter their natural colors, raised with painstaking attention to nutrients, water levels, amounts of sunshine, all to force them to bloom at exactly the right time. Wildflowers attracted bees, who made honey.
“Better than spending the night with Mikey and Luc back at the hotel, I suppose.” Gabriel knew how to handle the two of them better than Castiel did, but Castiel suspected even he found it exhausting. “I’d be shocked they even chose to come to the funeral, but we both know it’s all about the reading of the will tomorrow. Family rumor has it Hester was loaded, even if she chose to live in a tiny town in the back of beyond, in a house that’s practically crumbling around her.”
* * *
Dean’s eyes widened when the shadow just sort of…
He picked up the pace, not quite jogging, but lengthening his stride and moving quickly. There was a lot of distance to cover. Soon he rounded the corner to the vast hallway leading to the antechamber, slowed down, and eased around the edge of the wall. He paused a moment to let his vision adjust; it was dimmer in here, without the floodlights illuminating the courtyard proper.
“Yeah, I’ve done some work here and there. Would have liked to have done more, but what can you do?” He shrugged.
“I’ll ask if I can see some of his work. You should come too, if you can manage it. I can do all the talking. You can just look and listen.”
“Dinner will be served in about an hour and a half,” her husband adds.
Over dinner Dean couldn’t help but notice Cas watching him more than usual, with that little furrow between his brows that meant he was trying to figure something out.
He opened the bottle and drank a third of the contents in a single long pull, wiping his mouth afterwards. Plucking an apple from the bowl of fruit on the counter, he went to sit down beside her on the sofa. “What are you working on?”
“She is quite lovely,” Cas said. “You are fortunate to have her in your life.”
Luc and the newcomer moved to the dining room. Michael nodded crisply, not bothering to stand up from his seat at the head of the table. “Mr. Winchester. So good of you to join us. Please, have a seat and we can get started. You’ve just met Luc. I’m Michael, this is Gabriel, and Castiel is half hiding. Pay no mind to him, he’s always been odd.”
“They do not qualify as gifts when they are my belongings to begin with,” Cas pointed out acerbically. “But yes. The delivery truck arrived and brought the boxes. Is there any sort of labeling system?”
He lowered himself down into a crouch. Castiel touched his back. “Dean, no.”
Dean frowned. Special occasion?
“And your noble, if misguided, determination to be responsible and considerate.”
Cas took an involuntary half step backwards, alarm spiking through his veins even though he knew everything was okay. It was okay. It had to be okay.
“I looked, yeah, while you were upstairs the other day. There’s an old wreck that’s missing two wheels and is half rusted out. Even if you could get it running I wouldn’t trust it. You need something reliable.” Then he grinned. “Reliable, but stylish. Maybe something red with some zip to it. Low-slung and sexy.”
“Alek has always been my favorite character. I’m looking forward to a whole trilogy focused on him. He’s so interesting. Quiet, but so much going on in his head, you can tell, even if Emmanuel hasn’t really explored his thoughts, with the way he uses third person limited.”
“Right. Anyhow, I know you’ve been dying to get your hands on the place.”
The room was small, prosaic – a typical boarding house room. Castiel had stayed in one similar to this when he’d first accepted the position at the museum, until he’d purchased his cottage. Dean pulled out the simple chair from the desk, turning it towards the bed. He sat on the edge of the bed himself.
“Unlikely. It’s more likely that not finding anything will just convince them that it’s hidden and they need to dig harder.”
“Thanks, Cas.”
Cas pulled his lunch out one item at a time, arranging them neatly in front of himself. Dean scanned it curiously. The dude usually ate healthy, except for when he indulged in the cheeseburgers with them. Today was no exception. The sandwich looked like some sort of whole grain bread with turkey and sprouts, plus a container of carrot sticks and celery, and an apple. The grand finale was a small container of home-made hummus.
Castiel tightened his lips. He would not be charmed. Clearly Mr. Winchester relied on charm to get his way, and undoubtedly had success with his efforts. That smile, the twinkle in his green eyes, the way his nose crinkled… Castiel had a weakness for green eyes and freckles. He refused to let that weakness influence him in any way.
Dean grinned. “Me too. We should do it again sometime. Maybe without the business part.”
Dean grinned at him. Quintessential Cas, going on about small things. The thing was he was genuinely interested in it. In everything. “So what kind of meatballs?”
In his experience very few humans would fail to notice if his fingers suddenly lengthened and hardened into sharp talons, or if his pupils turned to slits and the irises began to glow. Preventing that from happening took mental discipline, and was exhausting.
He poured the rest of his old drink into the new and headed over to the table with the others. “Hey,” he said. “Thanks for the drink.” He grabbed a chair and pulled it over. “I’m Dean.”
“When the guys come back tomorrow I’ll make sure we check with the fire department first to make sure if there are any other precautions we should be taking.”
“Nonsense, there’s no reason to stay here. It’s musty and dank and dreary.”
“That’s what I thought. Come on. Let’s go grab something. Maybe at the Rusty Anchor again? The food there was good.”
Dean grinned, feeling a surge of warmth at the gruff nickname. He much preferred the superficial insult to anything flowery and gushy. Besides, it was Bobby. Bobby could get away with pretty much anything with him and Sam. The converse certainly wasn’t true. Bobby had never let them get away with much of anything.
Anxiety kept him up most of the night, though he thought he might have gotten a little sleep now and then. Once the sun rose, he hauled himself out of the chair and sought something, anything, to occupy himself. Scrubbing down the kitchen counters, mopping the floor, getting down on his hands and knees to reach into those little corners that usually got ignored… anything.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“You’re welcome. I think.” Gabriel bit into the chocolate, then extended it towards Cas in offering. Cas shook his head. “Your loss. Anyhow. I think I’m going to head out tomorrow. It’s important to get to your apartment before Mikey or Luc think about breaking in.”
Adler leaned back in his chair, playing with his pen. “I think you should promote Bela Talbot.”
Cas took a large step forward and wrapped his arms around Dean, hugging him tightly, surprised to feel the sting of tears in his eyes. “It’s amazing,” he said, voice thick. “I can’t believe you crafted something so beautiful for me. It’s perfect. It must have taken you a very long time.”
He rubbed his temples, feeling the migraine to end all migraines coming on. Of course that’s when Adler knocked briskly on his open door, stepping through and closing the door behind him without waiting for any sort of a response.
Dean’s eyes light up. “Yeah? We could go exploring? Wasn’t there a town not far from here?”
He refused to acknowledge what the way he said ‘Mr. Winchester’ did to him.
“So you have indicated. Repeatedly.”
There’s no way Dean would ever date him. Cas knows exactly Dean’s type. He’s lived with him since college. He’s
It meant, however, that it was just Dean and Cas at Cas’ house for dinner.
That got him a quick laugh. “Slightly unhinged, is it? Why do you say that?”
Fuck. Wasn’t he just telling himself he knew how to turn on the charm?
“I would like that. Yes.” He nodded and stood up, stretching his back with a pop, rolling his shoulders to relieve some of the stiffness. “You should take some of the candy with you.”
He likes their normal relationship, most of the time. He likes Dean a great deal, or he would have never invited him to continue rooming together after graduating from college. He likes Dean’s sense of humor. He even likes his taste in music, though he still pretends like he only tolerates it. Years of exposure to Led Zeppelin, Metallica, and AC/DC have eventually resulted in his appreciating them more than he would ever admit. He suspects Dean knows, but the pretense is a part of their relationship that he enjoys.
Regardless of his personal feelings on the matter, refusal was not an option. He’d be unlikely to refuse in any event. One did not turn ones back on this type of opportunity. Dean’s book was turning out to be something of a disappointment so far as his professional reputation was concerned; perhaps Mr. Roman’s collection would offer material more suitable for academic discourse.
He led Cas through the doors, making a point of being completely relaxed and casual, though really he was anything but. He could acknowledge to himself, if not to Sam, that he wanted Cas to like the place. Wanted him to like Ellen, and be comfortable here. He liked Cas, liked him a lot, so it made sense that he’d want his friend to hit it off with the people and places that were home to him. It would be awesome to spend the occasional evenings here at the Roadhouse with Cas, drinking a couple beers, shooting a round or two of pool, booing and cheering whatever sports event was on the TV.
“Agree.” Cas sighs.
Castiel nodded. “Yes, of course. Though I suppose there is little ‘of course’ about it, after yesterday. To be clear, then. Gabriel has my full trust and confidence.”
He briefly considered calling Sam, but he couldn’t do it. He’d have to explain everything. He couldn’t handle Sam’s sympathetic cooing, or Eileen’s kick in the pants. Maybe he needed them, both of them, but not yet.
That didn’t sound good. Dean sat on the corner of his desk, one knee hitched up. “Tell me what?”
Castiel hadn’t come across any works in Enochian in quite some time. It was an exceptionally rare language with very few extant works – which was a large part of his excitement over the book coming into his life. Before starting his translations in earnest, he picked up one of his own books and read through it, letting the familiarity of the work remind him of how to read and understand the language. He’d always had a knack for languages and recognizing patterns and symbols. When he’d realized those talents could be used to study ancient texts in dead languages, he’d known his life’s purpose.
“After Sam and Eileen are back?” He looked confused.
“If they didn’t find what they were looking for? Yes. Yes, I do. People who would murder others aren’t going to have any qualms about breaking and entering.” He looked meaningfully around the office.
“That doesn’t make sense.”
“Not yet, but he should be soon. He was out at Hester Albright’s place, meeting with her great nephew about the terms of the will.”
Dean nodded. “Same day you did. Or maybe the next day, I guess. Same day I heard, anyhow. Adler got made acting HR, and how the hell that happened I have no idea, but that’s a different issue entirely. Anyhow, he came in and was all up in my face about Bela. I just… right then and there, I decided it wasn’t worth it. Sandover isn’t worth it, not with that crap going on. Has it always been going on?”
He didn’t do that. He hadn’t done that since the first few months with Bartholomew. Casual invitations were anything but.
“Is there room in your shower for two?”
“Yeah. I still want to reach out to her and apologize. And I’ve been blowing off Charlie’s calls and texts. I kind of expect her to show up at the door soon.” He considered that. “I should text her and make some sort of arrangements to get together. Soon. Or she really will show up at the door.
“Ah, well. Yes. I suppose it isn’t.” Cas shrugged one shoulder slightly, feeling his face grow warm. “They’re advance copies.”
She stood, her gaze hardening. “You’ll regret this, if you don’t work with me here. I can make your life a living hell.”
“So what happened with the actual Danny?”
“Don’t get a whole lot of fuel efficient cars around here, but if you’re not driving a lot that’s maybe not quite as much of an issue.”
He took a shuddery breath. “No, I don’t think that I am. But I will be.”
“He got some of that veggie pineapple shit, but not just the veggie pineapple shit,” a woman said from the other side of Dean’s younger brother.
“You make it sound as though the heavens should open up and shine a golden light on it.” He put his notebook away and pulled the plate closer. The burger really did look and smell amazing. Cheese melted over the sides of the thick patty, slices of perfectly cooked bacon peeking out from under the crown of the bun.
Dean chuckled. “Why does this not surprise me?”
“Oh. That is a very good idea.” Cas pulled out his phone and scrolled to Gabriel’s name -- pretending that scrolling was necessary. All of his contacts fit on one, maybe two screens on his contact list, and half of those were services rather than individuals. It was a silly pretense, he supposed, and yet he couldn’t stop himself from doing it. It didn’t dawn on him right away that Dean would just assume that Gabriel was at the top of his contact list, rather than that the number of contacts was so pathetically small.
He’d had more hook-ups than actual relationships, but one of the four relationships that had lasted longer than a week was with a guy, and overall, it had gone well.
Dean tugs at the sleeves of his sports jacket as he and Cas descend the long stairs down to the main floor and the formal dining room. He’s been thinking about how best to go about this. He’s slightly behind Cas, which means that he can see his best friend is tense. His shoulders are hovering about two inches higher than usual, and his posture is perfect. They should have practiced going out together in public. Not like they really had time, but they should have figured out a way to make it happen anyhow.
“You sure did,” Dean said, beaming at him. It was ridiculous that Dean’s pleasure in his accomplishment could make him feel so warm and gooey inside, and yet… and yet. “We’ll leave ‘em in here for now, and maybe tomorrow or someday soon you can come paint them. Sam’s going to be arriving soon; we should get upstairs and I need to make sure there’s nothing embarrassing hanging out in plain view. Not that I mind embarrassing my brother, but I’ll give him a break today.”
“In that case I will wish to change my clothes. I’ve done some exploring back there; it can be muddy.” He lifted his foot, extending it out the side of the desk to show Dean the loafers he was wearing.
Adler led him around next. His own team was small – two senior sales associates, three junior, and an administrative assistant. But then there were a lot of other people to meet, too. There were colleagues at his same level in the organization, Directors of different regions. More sales associates, more admins. Then the President, Gordon Walker himself, and the rest of the executives.
Cas swallows and slowly places his hands in Deans.
"Cas can show you where the bathroom is," Chuck continues, thankfully missing Dean's reaction entirely.
“Huh. Maybe you’ll get a chance soon. Or if you end up destroying his kitchen temporarily, you could offer the use of yours.”
They continued to talk about what Castiel had read so far in the book, and branched out to discuss how he had come to study Enochian in the first place. His answer boiled down to ‘because he could’ – and since it was a language that to the best of anyone’s knowledge had never been spoken in the vernacular, it was unique and therefore interesting.
“Ha.” He set his case down under the hall table, then came over to bend down and press a kiss to his daughter’s head. “She been asleep long?”
“Mr. Adler.” Dean straightened. “How can I help you?”
Cas stepped farther in, avoiding Dean’s gaze. He seemed to find the bookshelf inordinately interesting. “Yes,” he finally said, turning. “It’s why I’m here, now. I wished… now that that the wedding is over, it was my thought that we could, perhaps, talk. Unless you do not wish to.” He ran his finger along the edge of the bookshelf, then pushed his hands into the deep pockets of his coat. “I would understand, if you do not. I asked a great deal of you with no explanation. I thank you for listening.”
What a stupid thing to say. Clearly his brain was still offline.
Castiel looked around as they dutifully returned to the staging area, wondering if Dean was anywhere nearby. He wanted to see the man again, even knowing it would be unwise at best, disastrous at worst. The last thing he needed was for security to be more aware of him than of any of the other workers, no matter the reason. Awareness meant attention, and attention meant reduced opportunity.
The one suit he owns he bought nearly ten years ago when he was interviewing for jobs.
He took another sip of his beer to give himself another moment to consider. “I’m still working on that one,” he admitted. “Which I guess means not completely straight. I like women. Most of my hook-ups are with women. But… not all.” He mumbled that last into his bottle.
Cas hesitated, leaned forward to brush his lips against Dean’s forehead. His lips were cool, his scent dry but somehow warm, like cinnamon and apples. Comforting.
This was his own fault, opening the door to more personal topics. He shrugged one shoulder. “When I was at university, I took a course in languages, discovered I had an aptitude for it. And then I discovered the library at Oxford.” He’d been a shy, introverted American boy in a prestigious British school. The loneliness and homesickness never went away, until he discovered he could lose himself with the books.
Dean flushed. “I’m not. I didn’t make the door. I just turned it into something else.”
Cas didn’t do anything of the kind. He lowered his chin, looking up at Dean through his lashes, his blue eyes deadly serious. “I have become aware of a security threat that I need to communicate to you. It is urgent, and I, we, weren’t certain that if we went through normal channels that it would come to your attention.”
“This place seems… hospitable,” Cas said, choosing his words carefully. He was an author. Word choice was important. “Friendly, comfortable, casual.”
Dean looked up when Kevin slid another tumbler of whisky onto the counter in front of him. “From the guy in the trench over there,” he said with a grin. “By way of the redhead with him, but he didn’t stop her.”
“Five… four… three…. Two… One! Happy New Year!” Charlie exclaimed, bouncing up and down, blowing her little horn and rattling the noisemaker.
Castiel tried not to listen, instead losing himself in the e-book he’d brought along. The easiest way to handle the way Michael and Luc made him feel was to simply absent himself, physically if possible, mentally if he was stuck in the same room. It had taken him years to learn that trick, and it didn’t always work, but at least most of the time it kept his stomach from roiling.
“Sure, that sounds great!” She reached out to fist bump him.
Dean stepped up beside him, letting his shoulder nudge against Cas’. He closed his hand into a fist to keep from reaching out to thread their fingers together. If other days hadn’t been the right time to throw that into the mix, this sure as hell wasn’t the right time. Supportive friend. Supportive friend. That’s what Cas needed, so that was what Dean would be.
He caught his lower lip between his teeth and considered. “Yes. I believe I would enjoy that.” He sounded rather surprised.
“Depends on the weather. Sometimes I walk. Yeah, sure, we can do that, sometime.” He hoped it was one of those ‘sometimes’ that never actually came.
He closed his eyes as he lowered his head against her. If he couldn’t entirely halt the undesired tears, he could at least hide them.
Castiel stood up and went to find the cleanser and some paper towels. By the time he’d finished polishing what was actually a lovely table, the lawyer had arrived. He straightened, feeling his shoulders tense and his pulse race.
He carefully saved his work, then stood up and stretched. If he was going to do this — and he was going to do this, he told himself — then he should get going. He was dressed well enough for an outing. Castiel made a point out of dressing for work even though he didn’t have to, the ritual of showering and then getting dressed in something nicer than sweats and an old, worn tee helping to shift his mindset into ‘author’ mode. If Dean was going to be over and working in the house, sometimes he would dress a little less formally, in case he ventured into the construction area. More usually, he wore trousers or jeans that were still stiff and deeply colored, along with a cotton shirt. If it was cool he’d add a sweater or sweatshirt, but that was rarely the case anymore since the furnace had been tuned up.
“You were going to!”
“You going to be okay here by yourself, though? You don’t have a car yet.”
Almost.
Inappropriate, Winchester. Inappropriate.
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas stepped in as well and waited for the door to close.
“So. You in?” Charlie looked hopefully at Cas.
Cas laughs faintly. “Thank you for that.” He’s been victim to that before… people thinking that hey, Cas is gay, and this other person they know is gay, so that’s all they need to have in common in order to date. Even though he knows they mean well, he still finds that offensive.
Still, Dean was uncomfortable. The stakes were so high. Not everyone approved of a human marrying a dragon, even when that dragon was the ruler of the whole continent.
Damn. Dean could already feel his next few free evenings evaporating into oil changes, new exhaust systems, and teaching Cas basic auto maintenance. He’d have to check the steering and the brakes, take a look at the timing belt, make sure there weren’t any leaks — all for an ugly-ass car that in his opinion should have never been on the road in the first place.
Cas doesn’t know what to do or say, so he forces a weak smile. “Thank you, Dad. That means a lot to me.” It did. Or it would, if it were true.
“It took some time, yeah,” Dean admitted, his arms sliding around Cas, too. “Worth it. I hoped you’d approve.”
“Yeah, go for it.” Gabe waved vaguely towards the door.
“You’re welcome.”
“Okay...”
Cas’ gaze narrowed. “Luke has been sheltered and confined to a narrow world, and dreams of a different life. It is entirely understandable and justifiable that when one of his few freedoms is curtailed that he should be disappointed. Perhaps the tone of voice he uses when expressing his disappointment at not being allowed to go to Tosche Station to spend time with his friends is indeed slightly whining, but he is frustrated and feels trapped.”
“Cheers,” Dean agreed.
Progress on the house started moving along quickly once the structure was in place. Cas agreed to let Dean bring in a larger crew in the interests of getting the work done, while Cas brought his laptop to Dean’s apartment, where he could work in peace and without the mental stress of having way too many strangers in his space, where he might run into them at any moment unless he stayed in his office. That wasn’t an option, actually, because the office had no bathroom.
“She was… reluctant to discuss the specifics of the situation, but she was extremely upset. It has nothing to do with you directly, let me assure you of that. I’m not at liberty to discuss in any more detail, I’m afraid. The legal department is involved, and you may be on the receiving end of some of their questions, but I’ve been warned not to say anything more than that.”
“It’s possible. Damn. I didn’t expect that.” He looked around, shoulders tensing, his fingers twitching until he shoved his hands into his pockets. “I am so sorry if that’s the case. I never intended
Maybe he’d find out someday, maybe he wouldn’t. In the meantime, he needed to do what he could to help the guy through it.
Castiel Novak stood outside his office. “Dean. I’m glad you’re still here. Do you have a moment?”
“Ah. Okay, so we’re safe on the anti-fraternization front.”
“I like it,” Cas agreed. “It makes the green of the trees outside more intense, and in the winter it will make the room seem visually warmer.”
Two days until Thanksgiving, and he had no idea what he was going to do for the holiday. Truth be told, it didn’t feel much like a holiday. Sam and Eileen were spending the day with Mildred, the woman she considered the next thing to a mom, six states away. Bobby was off on a hunting trip with a friend, a rare opportunity he hadn’t been able to pass up. That was fine, Dean was happy they were all having a good time, but it meant that it was just him and Emma.
His heart thundered in his chest, and heat rose in his face. This was a risk, a huge risk. Involving anyone on Michael’s official security team could mean terrible things, but if they didn’t do it, and Walker succeeded in getting to ‘The Flight’ before Castiel did…
“I did. Unfortunately for us – fortunately for her, I suppose – she’s spending the holiday with her son in Florida.”
Dean reached under the table with his foot, nudging the side of Cas’ shoe with his own. “You will be,” he agreed. “In the meantime… if you need to stay here tonight, then I’ll stay too. The room Gabe was using is still made up, right?”
“What?” Dean couldn’t think. What was even going on? Not ten minutes ago he’s been mourning the best friendship he’d ever had, thinking he would never see Cas again, and now… this?
Dean watched him, stretched out his own legs. “Hey, Cas.”
Fire. There was fire! Castiel’s eyes widened as he looked at Dean, incredulous.
Given that it was the new moon, it should have been too dark to see anything—but there had been a slight green-tinged glow coming from the northeast, in the direction of the rocky section of coastline. That too made him uneasy. It had started some two months ago. When he’d asked his colleague, Dr. Engelbret, about the phenomenon, he’d suggested that the bioluminescent mosses inside the sea caverns had perhaps become excited and with atmospheric conditions, were visible from a greater distance than customary. That sounded unlikely to Castiel, but Dr. Engelbret was the expert in natural history, so he’d convinced himself to defer to his judgment.
, and he would be most unhappy if it met the same fate as his office. Thinking of his office still made his stomach turn.
“It’s an addition to a home. The family is expecting triplets, and don’t want to move, but adding three more children to the existing space isn’t going to work. They’ve decided to invest in expanding their current home. The budget is limited, though, so I have to be cognizant of that with the plans.”
She scowled at him, but he could see the amusement in her eyes. She leaned forward on the bar. “So you making progress there? What’s the new guy like?”
“Not really, no. The library was well-appointed considering he’s not been here long. An extensive collection, though I only spent time with a few pieces. I didn’t see much of the rest of the estate. I was escorted directly to the library.”
“Not precise enough.” She was clearly frustrated by that. “I’ve got a 92 percent probability that he’s in town, and although there’s a chance he’s not after the same thing we are, it seems ludicrous to assume he’s not. The Walkers have destroyed pieces of your Hoard before, and haven’t made any secret of their intention to wipe out every bit of it. Taking out ‘The Flight’ would, to their way of thinking, be a blow to both Novak and Anges.”
“There is a rusty anchor outside the entrance. It may have originally had a different name. I’m not certain.”
Shit.
Castiel considered protesting further but closed the book instead. When first he’d started his tenure at the Museum, he hadn’t known what to think about Mrs. Crombie. She’d been the one to help him find his house and had introduced him to his favorite pub – owned by her brother. He wasn’t sure why she’d chosen to adopt him. Maybe because he was by far the youngest of the Museum’s experts, or maybe because he was new to Havenport and hadn’t known anyone else.
Cas is nervous. Incredibly nervous.  Why did he ever think this was a good idea, bringing Dean here? No one is going to believe for a minute that he and Dean are dating. His parents and siblings have met Dean before. They’ll see through the charade in an instant. Perhaps not his mother; he loves her, but she can be blind to the most obvious things if she wants to believe something different. But his father will know. And Gabriel? Gabriel will not only know, he’ll fall onto the floor laughing. There is no one more skilled at poking holes in Cas’ ego than his older brother.
Gabe sighs and leans closer, bumping their shoulders together. “Don’t worry. I don’t think anyone else has figured it out. Mom and Dad are just so happy to see you two together, and the douche cousins are too busy trying to be douches without Grandmother picking up on it and disowning them.”
Cas considered. “Yes, I will be okay.” He thought about the fact that he’d gone for years without Gabriel stopping in to check up on him, during that time his brother had been ‘finding himself’ in Asia, but he knew better than to bring that up. It wasn’t like he’d actually done well for himself during that time, and Gabriel still felt residual guilt over not seeing what was happening sooner.
Dean could just see it, Cas with his endearing awkwardness, his sex hair and brilliant blue eyes, his sharp intelligence but socially inept ways, his insecurity. He dreaded where the story was going next, but hoped Cas would continue. He didn’t say anything, but simply held Cas’ gaze, silently communicating his attention.
“We’d love to have you,” Dean interrupted him, shocking the hell out of himself. Where had that come from?
He’s long since gotten accustomed to the thought of Dean naked in the shower when he can hear the water running. He may still indulge in daydreams about joining him, but it’s nothing new for him.
The kiss quickly grew heated, hard, desperate, but with a wondrous edge of tenderness. Dean had never felt anything like it. He felt like he was floating, disconnected from reality. Was this really happening?
“Hell yeah, man. The moment I saw it was out there. Might take the day off work, curl up in my recliner and read it as soon as it comes. Turn off the phone, close the blinds, pretend like I’m not home. And then I’ll be chomping at the bit until you’re finished too and we can talk about it.”
Fuck, fuck. A small, rational part of his brain recognized that it had been a slash that barely connected, or else he’d already be dead, sliced clean in half.
“Yeah. Not digging the ‘red pepper aioli’. What’s wrong with ketchup and mustard and dill pickles?”
“Emmanuel’s works do that for you?”
This was everything.
Castiel nodded again.
He scowled at her. “I’m not always anti-social.”
Dean turned a beguiling shade of rose.
It isn’t quite so neat and tidy as all that. Cas reluctantly agrees, which Dean counts as a victory, but the rest of the arrangements aren’t quite as easy as he’d hoped. He has to cash in some favors at work, and then he has to upgrade his wardrobe sneakily enough that Cas doesn’t catch him at it, and quickly. They’re heading out on Wednesday around noon, and it’s already Saturday.
Cas fixed Dean with a flat look, then pointedly turned towards Charlie, dipping a carrot stick into the hummus.
“Yes.” Cas looks, too.
Just because Jessica and Mariel were not Dean’s did not mean that Dean was gay, or even bi. Just because he hadn't specified ‘wife’ when talking about having children of his own did not mean he wasn't assuming that configuration. It was most common, after all, and for a reason.
“Yeah, you did, but I understand. It’s a lot. Guess I’m not as surprised as you are that Hester would have cut Mikey and Luc out. She really didn’t like them. I’m probably more surprised she didn’t leave the whole thing to her causes, but she must have remembered you fondly from when you were little. You always were a polite little cuss. Weird, too.”
Though if he’d come with Danny as originally planned? He would have expected to share a room with him. He just wasn’t thinking.
Gabriel chuckled. “I’m sure you’ll figure it out. When you decide you’re interested in something, you always do. Sounds like you’re doing okay there. Did you get a car yet?”
Cas is a big-shot architect now, and has to wear suits to work whenever he’s meeting with important clients. When he doesn’t have to wear suits he still has to wear nice, business casual attire. Cas has plenty of wardrobe choices for the trip. Dean kind of hopes he brings that one designer tee, the blue one that fits him really well and brings out the color of his eyes.
“You didn’t answer the question.”
“Why?” On the surface it was a simple question, but Castiel suspected the answer wasn’t simple at all. “Obviously you don’t owe me any answers, but… I would like to know. If you are willing to tell me.”
Castiel caught the quick flicker of Sam Winchester’s reaction to that. The man didn’t say anything, to his credit.
“Sam and I have been thinking about remodeling our kitchen. It’s not bad, though, so we’re in no hurry. It’s just not really to my taste. Kind of dated. I’m not a big kitchen type of a girl anyhow, so it’s not a priority. And now we’ve got Mariel, and maybe in a couple years there will be another baby, so.” She shrugged, and laughed. “Well. Pizza? Don’t know about you, but I’m starving.”
“Awesome. Talk to you more later, Gabe.”
He was not impressed by her sudden mock innocence.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean considered where they were, then tapped Cas’ shoulder before heading off towards the arcade surrounding the courtyard. Tucked away in a corner was a small, unassuming door, nearly unnoticeable. Dean touched his security card to the electronic lock, waited for the light to turn green, then stepped inside, holding the door open for Cas. He wasn’t sure what the room had originally been. Maybe storage? It was empty now, though, aside from a couple worn wooden pallets and a lot of dust. He sneezed.
“Come on, Cassie. Most people don’t talk like that. It’s cute. And so very, very you. Don’t ever change. Well, not that part, anyhow.”
“Yes, three different varieties.”
“Don’t forget the nail polish. It could. Or just blankets on the sofa and recliner. I don’t have a guest room, but I wouldn’t want you to drive home in the middle of the marathon. Besides, it’s New Year’s. There will likely be libations involved.”
“Um. No. Not yet.”
“It’s all right,” he said, choked. “It was a long time ago. Just… what you said… made me remember.”
“Oh. Well. Hello, Mariel. It is very lovely to see you again.”
double dates was out. Confessing to the Bela incident was out. That left…
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean struggled against his restraints but was barely able to move.
“As I’ll ever be.” He pulled on his tan trench coat and followed Dean out of the house, locking the door behind himself.
Cas had to close his eyes tightly against the sting of tears. It had been so long. He should be over the pain. “He… had an accident, after I left. Before I even reached England. A carriage, in the narrow streets. They said the horses spooked, and Alfie was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” He shrugged. “A most unfortunate accident.”
“What?” he finally said.
He grinned. “Nope. Don’t know exactly what I
“Yeah. They are, because they’re dicks that way. I’ll work on them, but I don’t expect it to succeed. They like keeping you under control. They like keeping me under control too, but I’m better at making it more pain than it’s worth. You, you don’t like the conflict. Living here, though, you have a shot at making them forget about you. You okay with talking to Winchester?”
“Yeah, I am.”
Deep down, he knew Sam was right. But knowing it and doing it were two entirely different things. Maybe he could find a way to casually drop it into the conversation. Sam was right. It was only fair to let Cas know that he wasn’t straight.
“It just occurred to me… and it should have a while ago. Your kitchen here’s going to be a mess for a month, yet. You want to use mine, when you need to cook? Or even hang out at my place while we’re working here? It’d be a lot quieter. You wouldn’t have this awesome working space, but you wouldn’t need to be using the headphones.”
And yet the pieces weren’t fitting together quite right. Something was definitely off.
Cas’ breath hitched, and he smiled a soft, tiny smile. “My brother always said I should come visit, there was someone he wanted me to meet. I wish I’d done so before the accident. What kind of grown-up stuff did you have in mind?”
“Of course not.”
He couldn’t imagine ambitious Naomi Ross knitting. But who the hell knew? He’d been wrong about bigger things than that.
Sam looked up at that. “If you’re going to need help with the repairs, my brother runs a handyman service. He can do just about anything, and has contacts for anything he doesn’t do himself. He’s done everything from hanging pictures to major remodels. Plus he lives right here in Caroline, rather than having to go farther out.”
“We’re celebrating getting the safety hazards done at Cas’ place.”
Dean chuckled in disbelief. “All right. Yes. Yes, I still want to kiss you. Have for a long time.” Since they’d first met, if he was honest, but that kind of honesty he still held on to, unsure if it would scare Cas off or not.
Three days of solid work on translating the book Dean had brought to him left Castiel feeling more and more bemused. The text was starting to come together, but it was ever more clear that this work was entirely unreliable from a historical perspective. The discussions of magic made it clear that either the author was delusional or had a vivid imagination. Perhaps it had some value as a work of fiction, though it wasn’t coherent or linear enough to make a good read, even when translated.
“Well, she could have!”
He’s not drinking fast enough to get really hammered, though. Just pleasantly tipsy, which is enough. He doesn’t need to be
He rubbed his temples, feeling the beginnings of a headache. It might help if he could shift into his dragon form, but that wasn’t an option, not in this decidedly human-scaled apartment. Even if he was outside he wouldn’t risk it. Michael would undoubtedly sense the presence of another dragon, and he would have no opportunity to get back inside the palace once the dragon ruler knew he was there. His only course of action was to remain in human form until it was time to leave. That element of the unexpected was critical to their success.
There was no way in hell that Dean was going to do that to him. He cared far too much about the guy for that. The whole friends with benefits thing could work, sometimes. But not with Cas. Cas was too emotionally fragile for that.
Cas frowned at his monitor, unable to concentrate on the words dancing across his screen. Normally he had little difficulty keeping his focus on his writing; he knew to allow himself occasional short breaks where he looked out his windows, seeing what was new and different that day. Sometimes it was the particular color and formation of the clouds in the sky. Other times it was a hawk circling in the sky, looking for some sort of prey.
“Catching frogs is a hell of a lot of fun when you’re a kid, isn’t it.”
“You know. Boyfriendy types of things.” Dean waves his hand dismissively.
When the family had arrived in the town of Caroline, Kansas for Great Aunt Hester’s funeral, Michael had immediately declared the place a dilapidated ruin good for nothing more than tearing it down and plowing it under, then selling the land if they could find a buyer. He was of the opinion that getting any sort of money for the place would be a challenge, but it would be an insurance liability if they just left it there. Lucifer thought they should burn it down; he'd always had a fascination with fire. Gabriel kept making jokes about bats in the belfry, referring to Hester herself, who had been known as an eccentric. Castiel himself said nothing at all, staying outside as much as he could, reading up in the turret when it was too cold to sit in the broken down gazebo out back. Still, he thought there was something soothing and friendly about the place, even if none of his brothers could see it.
He drove completely through the town before turning around and doubling back to a parking spot on a side street near Sam Winchester’s office building. Taking a deep breath, he got out of the car and straightened, inhaling the warm sweet spring air. This was nothing like the big cities he was accustomed to, Chicago or even Topeka. The air was fresh and scented with lilacs rather than car exhaust, the light was clear when it wasn’t filtered through a faint layer of pollution. If he listened intently he could hear the susurrus of the nearby river.
Castiel fixed him with a glare. “I am the Curator of Archives at the Hieronymous Society Museum of Antiquities. Surely you did not intend to caution
“Hold on there, Cas. I didn’t say anything about not accepting anything,” he protested. “I might need a minute to process. I mean, this is huge.” Then he laughed, a faintly hysterical chuckle. “No pun intended. Because, yeah. Huge.”
“Thank you. It isn’t large, but it suits my needs.” He took Dean’s outer coat and hung it on a hook beside the door. “I hope you like cod. As you might imagine, seafood is plentiful here in Havenport.”
“The front gardens, or the side gardens, of course.” Then he decides to mess with Dean, just because he can. “Or the rooftop garden, or the vegetable garden. Or the herb garden. Of course.”
Dragon, yeah. But damn, that attraction was still there. And those eyes, those eyes!
“Some of your cousins, on the other hand… let’s just say I can see why you don’t always spend Christmases here at the old family homestead.” He winks.
“Less than you might think. They don’t have all the fancy electronics like modern cars do. It’s a challenge to find parts when something can’t be repaired, but most things can be repaired with a little elbow grease.”
Dean nodded, looked at Cas. “I rest my case.”
“Awesome,” Charlie said, popping in between the two of them to snag a tortilla chip and dunk it into the bowl of seasoned taco dip. “I’m going to go get the first movie queued up.”
Dean could hear the unvoiced ‘for now’ in his brother’s voice, but thankfully he didn’t actually say it, so Dean could pretend he didn’t know it was there. He appreciated Sam’s concern for his personal relationships, or lack thereof, but that didn’t mean he wanted active interference. He could manage his own love life, thank you very much. Just because it had been a while since the last person he’d bothered introducing to his family… well.
After their beers showed up, Charlie lifted hers, waited for them to do the same. “To us. And to Wizard Technology, Inc.”
“Thanks,” Dean said absently, still focused on properly greeting the baby.
“Get out,” he said, his voice frosty. “You are behaving entirely inappropriately.”
The wedding was the next day, and there was still so much to do. Most of the structures and supports had been assembled yesterday. Today the potted plants would be installed. Many of the greens were still rooted and therefore didn’t have to wait until the last minute like the cut flowers did. There was trailing ivy, wisteria, white lilacs. The colors were mostly whites, sometimes shading to peach and pink. Roses and ranunculus and other blossoms would be wired in amongst the ivy and other greenery.
Cas’ gaze was immediately drawn to an ugly-ass gold Lincoln Continental pimp-mobile.
“They’re quite useful. I appreciate having a hot meal waiting for me when I get home after a particularly long and difficult day. Would you find an outlet and plug it back in? The meatballs aren’t really done yet.”
Dean shuffled through the contents of the box. “Not in here, but maybe in another box?”
Their colleagues were waiting in the reception area to meet them and escort them to their offices. Dean spotted Zachariah Adler right away. The guy was impossible to miss. He wore a dark gray suit with the jacket buttoned up, a comb-over, and a wide silvery tie.
Still, Dean caught sight of Cas still standing in the kitchen, watching him as he grabbed his gear out of the truck.
“That’s what I was told.”
“Hush. There are good reasons for it. Honestly, I don’t mind. I’m happy. But I’ll miss you.”
“You’re presuming guilt.” Castiel sliced a bit of cheese from the wedge to give himself something to do with his hands. “Did you come to Havenport because of him? You followed him here from… wherever you were before? Kansas, did you say?” He knew Roman had come here from somewhere in the Midwest. Kansas was as likely as anywhere else. He hadn’t paid particular attention, because he didn’t see the information as relevant in any way.
“I am looking forward to it. I have some flats in the spare bedroom where I am starting some seedlings. That room gets good sun for the purpose. I’ve never tried to start seeds before. Hopefully my efforts will be successful.”
“Yeah, he is. And before you say anything, yes, I gave them your name and number. That place definitely needs a lot of work, and Gabriel outright said that neither he nor Castiel are particularly handy.”
“Uh, no. Not really. Just… maybe try and make some overtures? At least let him know you’re open to more. You never told him anything about Aaron, did you?”
good look.
“Awesome — as long as you didn’t get just that veggie pineapple shit.”
“Mr. Dean?” Claire said.
Castiel tipped his head to the side again. “You seem displeased by that.”
“It really was. How’s the progress on the house coming? Dean thinks it’s making good time. He’s so happy to be able to work on it, I don’t know if he’s told you. He’s always loved that place, kept trying to nudge Mrs. Albright into doing some of the work you’re having done now, but she’d gotten to a point where she didn’t want to have the disruption. I can respect that.”
Cas got into his car, smiling to himself when he got behind the wheel. He was still pleased with the Continental—not least because of the good-natured insults Dean cast her way whenever he saw her. He waved at Dean’s neighbor. He hadn’t yet spoken to the man, but he’d seen him enough times that his face was now familiar and unthreatening.
“Yeah, that’s him.” Sam turned towards Cas. “Aaron Bass is a friend of ours from high school. He was actually between me and Dean in school, a year behind Dean. Great guy. He spent a lot of time hanging out at our place.”
After a meal consisting of food left over from the gathering after the funeral, Castiel traced his hand over the spines of the books in Great Aunt Hester’s library, pulling one at random and bringing it with him to the front room, settling into a wing chair upholstered with roses and with a lace antimacassar draped over the back. It too smelled a little musty, with a faint lingering fragrance of lily of the valley.
“Oh.” Momentary silence. “I suppose that might have been useful, huh?”
It looked good. Far too good.
Dean grinned and swept her into his arms, lifting her high overhead. “Hey there, Peanut! Good to see you, too. Love you.” He blew a raspberry against the underside of her chin. She giggled.
If only Sam were right here, so they could speak in person rather than over the phone.
He shrugged it off and got back to work. He had the marketing brochure sample to go over, after all.
Cas nodded. “Yes, they neutralized it before they left, and tested the area afterwards. Thankfully he hadn’t gotten very far with his preparations, so there wasn’t much to clean up.”
The laughter faded. Dean leaned forward, his face filling more and more of Cas’ vision, until his lips brushed over Cas’, so light and airy that Cas wasn’t even sure he’d felt anything. He made a sound of protest when Dean pulled back again.
“It?” Cas questioned, his expression confused.
“Hey,” he said, smiling warmly, but keeping his voice quiet. He raised his hand in a friendly half wave rather than extending it to shake, guessing that physical contact would also make him less comfortable. “I’m Dean, and you must be Castiel.” He pronounced the name carefully, hoping like hell he’d gotten it right.
Castiel cast another glance through the window, then his shoulders sagged and he turned back towards Dean. “Hello, Dean. I got disoriented returning from the rest rooms, and then I couldn’t resist stopping for a moment to admire the art. It’s magnificent, isn’t it? My apologies, however. I am aware that loitering is against the rules.”
“I thought you said you didn’t work magic. I… perhaps we should discuss it further in the morning. I confess that right now I am so tired I can hardly see straight, let alone think coherently.”
the god-damn anti-dating policy even if I think it’s stupid!”
“I am presuming guilt,” Dean admitted. “There isn’t enough evidence yet to pin anything in particular on him, yet my instincts scream at me he is responsible for many evils including and beyond the death of Mr. Tran.”
“Parts of them. There wasn’t anything even remotely magical about them. They were histories, books of poetry. Ordinary classics, first editions, rare books. Beautiful, but not occult in nature.”
Dean laughs. “That’s one word for it. Place like this seems like it should have a name. Like… like those old English manors in all of the Austen novels. Pemberley.”
He stopped, took the risk of pulling out his pocket-watch and squinting to read the time. It was fast approaching midnight.
“No, but Sam Winchester does. You’re going to have to talk to him, find out what the situation really is. He seemed like a nice guy. I’ll stay if you want me to.”
Dean laughed and kissed him.
Castiel was glad it was Gabriel drinking the coffee. Gulping too much hot coffee wasn’t a good idea. He couldn’t be asking what he was literally thinking, could he? He couldn’t want to know about the fit of worn denim. “About what?” he asked, with just the right amount of curiosity. He hoped.
“Dude!” Dean exclaimed at about the tenth box. “You read SFF?” He held up a book.
“And what, pray tell, makes it ‘believable’ in your estimation?” Cas just sounds curious, not defensive or argumentative.
“Ah. Yes, undoubtedly so. I would imagine that security for the wedding of the year is very serious business.”
Fuck.
Fuck. Was that not okay? “Uh, yeah, sorry. Guess I’ve been shortening it in my head. I’ll stop if you don’t like it.”
“So I’ll just send everything.”
“But you don’t know that he wouldn’t.”
That he wasn’t certain of.
“God, no. Don’t… yeah. Come in.” Dean stepped aside, staring at Cas.
“See? Fancy stuff. Tagliatelle. Not just noodles.”
Pull it together, Winchester.
“Excellent.” Mr. Winchester grinned again. “I’ll be back tomorrow to see how far you’ve gotten. I’m willing to accept transcripts along the way.”
“What am I going to do with you?” Cas sighs.
“Are there really three sitting rooms?” Dean murmurs as they head to the door, leaning closer.
“I know I will. Damn, do you know how hard it’s going to be to finish up working this afternoon, knowing that’s here?”
“Supposed to be,” Cas agreed.
Cas backed up into the shadowy space behind a potted wisteria, giving himself time to assess the situation.
He was both terrified and thrilled to say those words, to see Dean hear them.
Dean took the bag, looked inside. A bottle of a nicely aged Scotch whisky was there.
He’d been shocked when Adler offered him a job at the end of the convention. It meant moving across three state lines, but both the pay and the title were huge steps up, so after talking to his brother Sam and Uncle Bobby about it, he agreed, despite some minor reservations about just how well Adler lived up to the oily sales rep stereotype.
The guy was maybe an inch or two shorter than Dean, about his age. His hair was such a dark brown as to nearly be black, styled in artful disarray. Either that or it had been styled more conservatively and he ran his hand through it so much that now it looked perfectly, deliciously mussed. He wore a navy suit with a blue striped tie and white shirt. It didn’t fit particularly well but still managed to look good. His shoulders filled out the jacket nicely, and though the trousers were slightly baggy, it still looked like he had great legs. He kind of wanted the guy to turn around so he could check out that ass.
“Do you always call her Grandmother?” Dean asks, curious. “Never anything like Gram, or Gammy, or Nana? Even Grandma?”
“If I had a date for New Year’s Eve, I wouldn’t be considering your invitation. A slumber party would not be where I hoped the evening would end.”
She blinked at him, then made the most adorable tiny hiccupy sigh and snuggled into his chest. Damn, but he loved this little girl. He wasn’t even reluctant to admit it, didn’t care what anyone thought. Mariel Rose Winchester was the most remarkable person in the universe, and he was privileged enough to be her uncle.
“Gabriel is the other brother?” Dean ran his fingers lightly back and forth along Mariel’s spine. She shifted slightly under his touch.
“Maybe start there? See how he reacts.”
“Yeah. I hope you like it?”
Dean was well aware that the idea of going out was going to make Cas tense. But maybe if he went with Dean it would be okay. And the Roadhouse was a safe environment. Ellen would make sure of it. Hell, if it got to be too much he was pretty sure he could bring Cas into the back room, where it would be more quiet.
“Did that. Sheriff’s here.”
“I’m working security for the wedding,” he explained. “Spent some time vetting out the people doing the event. If you’re working for Stark Designs, you would have come through the process.”
“Mm, time is relative. When you get to be my age it’s odd what feels like forever ago, and what feels like practically yesterday. Yes, I do remember. You and your brothers. The others were so much more… brash and outgoing, always competing, always trying to outdo one another. But you just wanted to learn everything you could. She kept an eye on you, you know. As much as she could, when the rest of the family made it difficult. She had a soft spot for you, and always wished you would be able to visit again. She understood why it was difficult, but… well.”
Cas followed Dean inside the shop. Suddenly Dean felt nervous. Why had he done this at the spur of the moment? It meant he hadn’t had time to clean up. He worked neat, tidying up as he went, but tidy wasn’t necessarily the same thing as spotless. And then there was his apartment. Had he remembered to put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher? He usually did, but had he this time? Shit.
“Winchester. Talks like he knows what he’s doing, and he’s local. Plus he worked for dear Great Aunt Hester.”
It was difficult to talk when his throat felt tight and he knew his face was flushed. But something about her was kind without being pitying, open and warm. So he focused on her and somehow found the words. “I greatly prefer it to Chicago. The house is everything I never knew I wanted, and will be more so in time, after the renovations are complete. Whenever that will be.”
“Oh. He said he owned a sweet shop.”
“When we came here when the kids were young, the others usually went outside to go run around the garden paths,” Chuck says. “Cas, though? He wandered through the house studying the architectural details, and cataloging where repairs were needed.”
“When do you want to do the grand tour thing? You need to get familiar with the town, at least. It’ll make it easier when I leave again.”
“Cas, you were involved in the interview process. You know how well qualified Billie is, and how lucky we were to get her.”
“So. What’s up, man? Why did you need to see me?”
“What are the penalties for violating the policy?” Abby asked, her pen poised and ready to take notes. Brown-noser. Dean looked for and located a wedding ring on her left hand. He considered asking a snarky comment about why she needed to take notes.
And Dean was taking all of this in stride, just another day at the office. For him, was it just another day at the office? He’d said as much, if not quite so explicitly. He’d been reticent, saying the bare minimum. But then he’d just whipped a sword out of nowhere and
Cas frowned. Something was off. He stood again and turned to survey the apartment. The small apartment. The small apartment that was completely bereft of baby gear – or, for that matter, any evidence of a cohabitant.
be a blow to both. Not the crippling blow they undoubtedly hope for, but a serious one. Do we have anyone else in the area?” He knew the answer to that. They deliberately kept their presence small. Charlie was here because Castiel needed some support, and her skills with electronics would help when it came time to execute the retrieval of their Hoard.
Cas’ jaw tightened briefly, but then he shook his head. “No. Well, as a child I lived in a large house, but the landscaping was all professionally maintained and any interference was not tolerated. Later I lived in a modern high rise.”
The kitchen itself still made him cringe, just like it had last year when he’d fixed the sink. The lighting was horrible, and while it had a couple windows, they were small and cracked and fogged over so badly that the best that could be said for them was that they let in some light. Some.
“And the movie. Okay, yeah. So it’s like that?”
“It could, yeah.”
“Yes, well, your intentions appear to be entirely irrelevant, don’t they.”
Dean could practically feel the chill winds of winter emanating from his eyes, the blue shifted from summer sky to icy cold. He refused to cower, though, even though Cas was suddenly downright intimidating with nothing more than the quality of his gaze and the way his voice dropped another half octave in challenge.
Great Aunt Hester had excellent penmanship. The letters were perfectly formed and beautiful, even if they had a slight wobble and uneven pressure. Castiel, the envelope was labeled. Just his name, the single word.
If he looked up to watch Mr. Winchester leave, and happened to observe how strikingly his coat fit across his broad shoulders, then no one need ever know.
“Not really. It’s skillfully done. They look almost alive, the way they’re fighting.”
“Castiel?” The knock on the door was soft. “Cassie? It’s me. Gabriel. They’re gone. Can I come in?”
“Yeah, she did last a long time. Impressive.” He tossed the can on top of the cookie sheet. Castiel winced at the loud banging sound it made.
“I know.” Cas smiled, warmed by the fierce protectiveness in Gabriel’s tone. Usually he presented himself as an affable fool, but when his protective instincts were roused he turned into a fierce warrior.
Dean can tell that Cas wants to jump at the idea, but is fighting it. The guy hates to ask for help on anything, hates to accept help even when it’s freely offered.
“Well shit.”
“What’s in the neighborhood you like?”
“A favorite. A favorite book of the six he’s published so far.”
Cas was threading his way between the tables towards another stack of crates, watching Masters. Dean saw the threat before anything happened -- a box sticking out rather than being safely tucked under the table, right in the guy’s pathway.
“Pulled muscles are nothing to sneeze at, buddy,” Dean said. “I’ve had the occasional fall off of a ladder, and it sucks, especially when you don’t have anyone around to help you.”
Dean.
“You sound like Jess. She’s an artist. Goes on about color theory once in a while. I pretend to tease her about it, but really it’s good to know when I do the occasional painting job. Sometimes people know exactly what they want, but other times they just say ‘blue’ and want me to pick the right blue. With what I’ve learned from Jess, I know better why a particular blue will or won’t work with their woodwork and trim.”
They continue working in silence for a short time longer until everything’s put away.
“Mostly just my own. I mean, I can appreciate a beautiful set of wheels, and I have
“I’ll send you a box once I’m back, or have one sent out. Not sure I trust the equipment here, or I’d make some.” He sent a disdainful look towards the old stove. “So. Can you take a look around, give us some idea of what sorts of things need to be done?”
“Yeah. Both. They independently questioned me about the terms of the will. I didn’t say anything more than that I don’t know the details, but that you’d be able to pay for the renovation without tapping family funds. Hint hint, it’s actually good for you two asses if Cas has an independent means of supporting himself.”
The problem is that he’s enjoyed this evening, enjoys having Dean’s attention directed at him. Having Dean casually brush his fingers against his arm is a form of torture all by itself, not even counting the soft affectionate kisses. He wanted so badly to turn his head so those kisses aimed at his cheek would land on his lips instead.
He moved into the shadows, wrapping himself in the darkness. Castiel could still see where he was, but only by enhancing his vision towards his dragon form. As a human, Walker was indistinguishable from the walls.
“Of course not.” Charlie smiled one of those obnoxious smiles.
“We’re in the living room,” Jess called back.
Gabriel made a face as he pulled out some old cans from the back of the cupboard. “This looks like it’s about twenty years old. Maybe thirty.” He shuddered dramatically.
Cas laughed. “Yes. She would. I would like that. Do you think she’ll be pleased with this development?” He gestured vaguely between the two of them.
“Dean? You mean, hot dude at the bar Dean?”
When he reached the museum and headed for the stairs, Mrs. Crombie came towards him, distraught. “Dr. Novak. Oh my dear, oh my dear, I am so very sorry.” She placed a hand on his lapel, withdrew it quickly as though burned. “I don’t know who or why, just… oh my dear.”
“Mariel is a lovely name.”
“I have,” Cas says. “I’ve looked at various house plans on the internet, and considered what I want long-term, and looked at my monetary situation. It doesn’t make sense to me to only do the bare minimum of what needs to be done. If I’m going to renovate, I would prefer to do it all at once.”
After a moment the door opened. “Dean Winchester? Hi, I’m Gabe Novak. Glad you could make it so quickly.” His handshake was firm and brief, his hand small but strong. The guy was on the short side of medium height, with whisky-colored eyes and thinning hair worn a little too long. Beyond that, though, he was anything but average. Weren’t Zubaz about twenty years out of fashion, if not more? These were a purple and brown zebra stripe, with a loud Hawaiian print shirt in green and red. A Snickers bar poked out of the shirt pocket, unopened. Definitely a far cry from what the guy had been wearing at the funeral, when all four of the Novak brothers were properly dressed in respectable suits. Not that Dean had really paid much attention, but he was certain he would have noticed a Hawaiian shirt.
Castiel wasn’t so sure, but at the same time, the idea of trying it was oh so tempting.
He cleared his throat. “So… first up, let me say I’m sorry for your loss. Mrs. Albright was a wonderful lady. We’ll miss her in Caroline.”
The walls still needed to be painted, the pendant lights installed over the island, the new cabinets put in, and the new flooring as well.
Dean steps in closer, so close that Cas can feel the heat of his chest. His thigh brushes against Cas’ as he positions them, resting his hand on Cas’ shoulder, tucking his thumb inside Cas’ collar. “Close your eyes and listen to the music. I’ll lead. Just follow.”
Ah. What he thought about hiring him. That was a safer topic. “Unfortunately we can’t ask her whether she was satisfied with the quality of his work or not.”
“Hell yeah. He’s one of my favorites. Kind of new, still, though, so not too many books out yet. Well, there are six out, so I guess that’s not super new. He’s got great characterization, and the worlds are so complex and yet real, you know?”
He pressed the button to text Dean.
And… oh shit. He didn’t actually say that, did he? No. Noooooo. His stomach plunged somewhere in the vicinity of his feet.
“I know, right?”
Mrs. Crombie gave him a patient look. “The Director will wish to speak to you as soon as he knows you’re here. If I were one to wager, which of course I am not, I would wager that he will insist you pay a call on Mr. Roman.”
Cas tensed his hands and took a deep breath. “Well.” He swallowed back his irritation. “I see. Thank you for taking care of this for me, Gabriel.” He reminded himself that he really was grateful. It would be a long time before he voluntarily returned to Chicago, now that he’d finally escaped.
He was a gorgeous dragon who had saved Dean’s life when he didn’t have to.
He brushed himself off, though honestly there was little dust or dirt to remove. He hunched in on himself and followed her the rest of the way to the crates, feeling the gazes of the other workers burrowing into his back. He shivered, not liking the pinpricks of attention.
Castiel leaned back in his chair, raising a brow. “Translations take time. What makes you think I would have anything at all to tell you yet?”
“How very generous of you.”
He picked up a frozen turkey roast, one of those meatloaf-shaped things that came with gravy in a plastic packet. No need to go any fancier than that, really. It was still turkey. Buy a box of instant stuffing, another for mashed potatoes, toss in a can of corn and a pre-made pumpkin pie and they were golden, right?
The entire wedding is on the grounds. The ceremony is in the West Garden. Dean tries very hard not to roll his eyes at the idea of having a West Garden. He thinks he’s mostly successful. Since it’s on the property they don’t have to drive anywhere to get there.
“Yeah? How private are these bets? Can I get in on the action?” Dean grinned at Cas.
Dean stifles a grin.
“Skeet shooting. I forget if there’s actual target shooting or not.”
Cas chuckled, shaking his head with what Dean hoped was fond indulgence. Better that than polite tolerance. Sometimes it was hard to tell with Cas. “Okay. It’s good.”
Dean pointed a finger at Cas. “You don’t even joke about things like that.”
He stepped inside, stopping just inside the door, watching while Dean closed and locked the door again.
“Not much. It still looks like a whole lot of nothing, but we’re actually down to the last steps for the kitchen. The appliances are scheduled to be delivered the end of this week, and I want to have the cabinets installed and the countertops in before then. Tomorrow I was planning to to the first coat of paint, then install the cabinets and the flooring and the backsplash. We won’t get all of that done tomorrow, but it’s only a couple more days. So we’ll need that final paint color decision from you.”
“You’re doing fine. If you want to tell me, I want to listen. Take your time. Take all the time you need. I’m not going anywhere.”
Dean opened the passenger door before going around to hop in behind the wheel. “Next time I come over, if I’m not hauling a bunch of construction gear, I’m bringing Baby. You need to meet her.” The pick-up was practical, but now that the weather was getting warmer, he desperately wanted to be driving the Impala. There was no comparison between the two.
Cas shook his head. “No. I appreciate the sentiment… but if anything, I am more determined than ever to sleep right here. I am not going to allow my brothers to drive me out of this house. I refuse.”
“Claire’s mom, yeah. I thought you said she and Jimmy got together in school.”
“You knew that, Gabriel. You’re the one that hired him.”
Then, because he’s a martyr and can’t help himself, he asks, “You think we seem right for each other?”
Castiel flushed lightly, a shade of pink flushing upwards along his neck to the tips of his ears. He didn’t say anything, but he nodded.
bed. The singular bed. One queen-sized bed. In a room with both of their bags.
“We broke up a week ago,” he admits. “Dean offered to step in so that I wouldn’t have to deal with the aftermath.”
“Which is weird to you, because in your head he’s still your gangly moose of a baby brother?”
Cas tipped his head to the side. “Excuse me?”
“But Dean—“
Cas held out the cover to the DVD to show him. “Star Wars.”
“Sir. Are you attempting bribery of a court official?”
“We are not here to discuss the remodel right now, though,” Cas said, squaring his shoulders, meeting Dean’s gaze across the table. “We are here to discuss last night.”
Perhaps it also explained the strange lights to the north, in the direction of the sea caverns. He wanted to run this theory past Dean, see what he thought. Castiel checked his pocket-watch. 5:30; approaching dinner time. Surely Dean would return soon.
where I’d hope a hot New Year’s Eve date would end.”
“Are you kidding, man? Of course it will be! September 15th. Mark your calendar. Better yet, pre-order. I already did.”
“Just hang on, buddy. I’ll be right there. Call 911.”
Dean snapped his fingers. “That’s why you look familiar.”
Cas looked up. “I wish I could say that I simply woke up one day and realized that it wasn’t a healthy relationship. It wasn’t that simple. The catalyst was his anger when he discovered I had been researching the means to start a family. He had no interest whatsoever in having children, and the way he communicated that to me was vicious and hurtful. Enraged. It became physical. I couldn’t stay in the condo after he stormed out, so I packed a small bag and left. I didn’t intend for it to be forever, just long enough for him to calm down. But while I was out Gabriel happened to call, and once he realized what was going on, he got on the next plane back to the States. Long story a little less long, he stood up for me and refused to let Bartholomew see me alone, and had him investigated. It turned out he had been stealing large amounts of money from me, from our family. That information turned Michael and Luc against him. He avoided prison time; I think my brothers wanted to keep the ‘scandal’ quiet.”
He groaned, shifted to press the ‘talk’ button. “Send… help. Antechamber.”
Cas stepped inside and settled on the guest chair, keeping to the edge rather than fully relaxing. “I was going through your paperwork and saw that you’ve listed the local Stay-Inn as your address. Do you have more permanent housing arranged?”
“’Good’ is far too weak and insipid a word for Zepp,” Dean protested, indignant.
“I wouldn’t be surprised in the least,” Cas agrees.
Sometimes, though, Dean would interrupt him, like today. “Heya, Cas.”
Cas smiled. “Ah. Self-interest. In that case, how can I deny you?”
Cas managed to do both. Rich worlds, rich characters with a stunning depth of emotion.
They’d actually met at a convention in Omaha, of all places. Dean hated conventions – at least the boring kinds related to business and industry, rather than fun stuff like gaming and comics and movies – but sometimes he drew the short straw at his old job and got stuck manning the booth. Sandover’s booth had been right next to his, and Dean had ended up chatting with Adler during slow times on the floor.
“Have you decided, then, what you want to do? As far as fixing up the kitchen?”
Images flicked through his mind at that reminder — red and blue-black, a confrontation between huge dragonkin, so violent that the ground shook. “The dragons.”
After locking up his office and stopping by to inform Mrs. Crombie of his departure and ask her not to let anyone into the office without notifying him, Castiel left the premises of the Hieronymous Society Museum with Dean Winchester at his side.
He straightened up in his seat, bracing himself. “Hello, Bela. How can I help you?”
Dean looked away and scratched the back of his neck. “Why.” He turned to once again look Cas in the eye. An expression of sadness crossed his face, lingered in his beautiful eyes and the way his mouth turned down at the corners. Castiel wanted to comfort him – and that thought frightened him. He didn’t want emotional attachments, particularly not to beautiful men who were only in town for a short time.
Sam, Jess and Mariel arrived a short time later. Mariel looked adorable wearing a pair of light blue overalls with a light green polka-dot top under it. She had two fingers in her mouth when they walked through the door, but pulled them out immediately when she saw Dean, and started bouncing in Sam’s arms. “De de! De de!”
“Awesome. I’ll give him a call and see if he’s free tonight. I think he is.” First, though, he pulled out his tape measure and notepad to make sure the bookshelves would fit just right.
He should talk to Cas, but Cas was HR. All the more reason, officially, to talk to him. But unofficially? The idea of discussing this with his friend, with… okay, man up and admit it… with his
After dinner, Castiel retreated to the room he’d claimed as his own, turned on the bedside lamp, and fluffed up the pillows. They were very new; Gabe had declared he didn’t want to sleep on the flat, worn pillows on the guest bed, so he’d driven out to the nearest bigger town and bought new bedding. Castiel decided he didn’t mind. He piled them up, using them as back support. He took out the heavy envelope Sam Winchester had given him, turning it over to look at the handwriting on the front.
“Not that I’ve been able to determine, but I haven’t finished cleaning. Obviously.”
He shook his head to clear it, not as a negative. “I… it resonated with me, that’s all. My family has a certain amount of wealth.”
“Not good bye. See you later.”
“Yes.”
Cas adjusted the distance between the plate and the edge of the table.
* * *
“Okay. You can open your eyes.”
It was fun, though. At first Cas kept his contributions to the conversation cautious and business related, but before long? He was sharing dry observations about incidents in the news, going on a mini-rant about the plight of bees in the world, sharing his outrage about modern politics, and contributing his own opinions about the relative merits of the day’s lunch choices. He was funny as hell, though it was a subtle humor. Sometimes it took Dean a couple beats before he got it.
Claire and Emma giggled at that. “Are we going to do the thanks thing?”
“Somewhat. Mrs. Crombie does keep me informed about local events. I understand that he’s moved to Havenport recently, purchased the Debensham estate and undertaken some renovations. I further understand that he comes from a wealthy family, though I’m unclear as to what industry they have made their fortune in.”
“You’ve looked into them?”
“Ready to head out?” Dean asked, pulling out his wallet and tucking payment under the edge of his plate.
“I have no doubt that it will.” Cas heard a slight movement, steps on the wooden floor, and then he felt Dean’s warmth just behind him, before Dean lightly brushed his fingers over Cas’ sleeve. “Thank you. You really haven’t told anyone else? Not even Gabriel?”
“Cas is in the market for a working car. He’s been relying on delivery, so it’s about time. Got anything promising?”
The sizzling snap of electricity absolutely had to be his imagination. It had to be.
“I see that you are here alone today, Dean.” Cas moved towards the kitchen counter where the coffeemaker was plugged into a newly replaced outlet, one that should be able to handle the load without sparking. It was making a burbling noise, promising hot coffee in the near future.
“Two oldest… hey, is that who those two dudes in the expensive suits at the diner were yesterday? They looked about as out of place as I’ve ever seen anyone.”
The house was even more peaceful after Michael and Luc left in the rental car, though Gabriel was running on and on about random topics ranging from whether there really were bats in the belfry here to the contents of the cupboards to whether the ancient refrigerator would live through the night. Castiel simply let him talk, rarely responding. It was a rhythm he was accustomed to and didn’t disturb him.
“I’ll take you up on that.” It isn’t so much that Dean is really all that interested himself in the architectural details of Cas’ grandmother’s home. It’s more that Cas himself is passionate about architecture, and Dean has always loved listening to Cas when he loses himself in something. He comes across as so reserved that it’s just a delight when he forgets himself enough to really let himself go. He fondly recalls one occasion where Cas went on a twenty-minute rant about the addition one of their neighbors put on the side of their home.
About a month into his job, Dean flopped back on the bed in the Stay-Inn, phone in hand, and rang up Sam.
Most of the main construction in the kitchen was complete; the framing was done and the drywall in place, the door and new windows installed, the new subfloor and all of the plumbing and wiring were complete. So all of the main structural work was done, but there was still most of the finishing work to do.
Jimmy and Cas were identical twins, but he’d never once thought that Jimmy was attractive
“Just another few days,” Charlie said, touching Castiel’s shoulder soothingly. “And then we’ll have it back.”
“Dean, is it?”
“Hello Gabe,” Cas says with a sigh.
She controlled a fond smile. “Yes, he’s been checked out. He’s going to have some lovely bruises, and he’ll be sore for a few days, maybe a week or two, but nothing more serious than pulled muscles and deep bruises. Might be a good idea to visit the doctor in the morning, just to be sure.””
“Fuck yes, I like that. But you’re right. I’m a mess. Let me… let me take a quick shower, huh? Here you are looking like a dream, and I’m a mess.” Dean brushed his fingers over Cas’ shoulders. “This is my favorite suit of yours. The Wednesday suit.”
Ever since that day, Dean had definitely noticed that Cas’ normal business attire did not fit him nearly as well as those jeans.
“What business is it of Sandover what people do when they’re not at work? How is this even legal?”
“To quit.”
“I will explain more to you, but not here. Somewhere with greater privacy. I can help you return this office to more order.”
Cas obeys, and Dean is right. It’s that easy. It helps that it’s a slow song, and Dean isn’t trying any elaborate choreography. It’s not like Dean is a trained dancer either.
His second identity he kept strictly private. Even Gabriel didn’t know about Steven Emmanuel. The Emmanuel works were imaginative, fantastic, a world he could escape into that was nothing like this world. He’d written them for himself, and after completing the third novel it occurred to him that they might actually be good enough for publication. Now, at book six, they were solidly successful, earning far more than dry, scholarly works ever would.
“More immediate, though… what are you going to do about getting your stuff out here?”
“Why is privacy necessary?”
“It’s a pleasure, gentlemen. As I mentioned, I’ve been Mrs. Albright’s lawyer for a few years now, and she designated me to be the executor of her estate, until it’s been fully distributed to her beneficiaries.” He opened his briefcase and brought out some papers. “It’s been established that the four of you are her sole remaining blood relatives. And your children, of course.” He nodded towards Michael before sitting down across from him. He waited as Luc and Gabriel sat on the other sides of the table, sparing a quick glance to Castiel, who chose to remain on the edge of the room.
“Yes, yes, of course.” He reached to unclip the cards from the hem of his shirt and handed them over.
“You act as though you have experience with that not being the case.”
Okay. Maybe he did understand. It was similar to the process of poking at a bruise or a sore spot in your mouth.
Even a month ago it wouldn’t have been, but Cas was comfortable, now, with the entire Winchester family. “Yes, it’s fine. Would you like a cup of coffee? Dean is undoubtedly already helping himself.”
Cas chuckles. “Maybe.”
“No, but I’ve never told him anything about Robin, Cassie, or Lisa either.”
“And the rest is history? You even have room for more books if Roman donates some?”
“I’ve never—“
Somehow having Gabriel call him weird didn’t cut the way it did when others used that term. Gabriel didn’t use the term negatively, he supposed. He wore his own weirdness proudly, even if it was an entirely different variety than Castiel’s. Gabriel’s was born of defiance and rebellion, whereas Castiel, when he had been a child, just worked differently. Things that were obvious to others he was entirely oblivious to, and vice versa. He could spend hours watching insects or the way rain fell in patterns on the windows, appreciating the random beauty of the way the paths streamed, parted, rejoined.
Dean shook his head, his heart aching at what Cas had been through. He knew Cas was leaving a lot out, keeping the details unsaid, but shit, even this much was awful. “How’d you get out of it?” He asked softly.
Cas met his gaze, hesitated a moment, then nodded. “Yes. It was. The pumpkin patch and corn maze were enjoyable, as was the Farmer’s Market.” They had a trunk full of purchases to show for it.
Chuck considers that for a moment, then nods. “I hope you aren’t still nervous. I’m very happy it’s you. I must say, I’m not entirely surprised.” He smiles and his whole face lights up. “You guys have been living together for years.”
“Nah, man, I should be able to do it. I can run the wires down to him from inside the walls, and he can stay downstairs. I can do the parts that are in there. The county inspector will need to check the final work, though.”
Charlie walked up to the host station. “Reservations for three, under Bradbury?”
“Yours?”
“No. No. Nothing’s going on. Did you use the expensive wine in this sauce? It tastes… well, I don’t know how to explain it, but it doesn’t have that same weird aftertaste that it does when I try to use wine in cooking, but I usually use the crap that they sell at the grocery store for two bucks a bottle.”
“Hell’s bells, man, you did it! Oh my God, you
Gabriel arched a brow at Castiel after the rumble of the pick-up truck’s engine faded in the distance. “So? You think you’ll be okay with him being around? Haven’t seen you engage that much with someone you’d just met in a long time.”
“Cas…”
He started talking about them, answering Dean’s questions as they went. When two plates appeared on the table, just inside his peripheral vision, he blinked in surprise. “The burgers are here already?”
Castiel saved those for later. He wasn’t particularly hungry, though he appreciated the two bottles of water that Gabriel had stuffed in his pockets. He thought he might look up that recipe with the tater tots. It was strangely delicious, and he liked to cook. He found cooking soothing, the repetitive motions, the concrete result at the end. He needed to eat, so it was practical too.
“I have reason to believe that one of the Wing is present and intending to disrupt the wedding proceedings. He goes by the name of Gordon.” He pulled out his phone, quickly keyed in his code to open the lock screen, and turned the screen towards Dean.
“Yup.” Charlie opened the refrigerator and started putting the beer inside, moving aside things in the way. “He’s bringing the munchies. He said he might bring something to contribute to dinner, too, but we’re good if he doesn’t. Heck, we could just survive off of snackies if we have to. There will be a wide variety of them. Probably too many.” She shrugged a shoulder. “But New Year’s needs lots of those cute little hors d’oeuvres things. I made a few different things.”
“Yes, Dean?”
Castiel hissed softly when his gaze traveled higher. Dean. It was Dean. The man was… well. He was
Cas turned towards him. Dean felt that damned flare of interest again, and ruthlessly pushed it down. This was not, repeat
He knows better than to mess with anything in Cas’ office, though, and Cas isn’t so much into sports, though he doesn’t mind the occasional baseball game when Dean talks him into going.
There was a pause before Cas spoke. “Mr. Winchester. I need to see you in my office, please. Immediately.”
Cas flushes, because… well, because that’s entirely true. He does love them, but a professional architect should not be seen in an old t-shirt with potentially polarizing statements emblazoned on them. “Yes, I’m wearing actual pajamas. Almost my entire family is here right now.”
, Castiel recognized the man. Today he was wearing a brown and green plaid flannel shirt, without a jacket. A strange twisting sensation moved in his gut as he watched Dean bend down over the stroller and lift out a small child. He turned towards his companion, a lovely tall blond woman, and both of them laughed. Such an idyllic, perfect scenario. Handsome man, gorgeous woman, beautiful baby.
“Triplets? Wow. That ought to be interesting.”
He’d ask his questions then, about what this Enoch River had to do with the painting the cute florist was so interested in.
After a long, difficult conversation, he and Jess came home to Caroline. Home for Sam, anyhow. Jessica had been born and raised in California, but she’d settled in to life in Caroline with a determination to fit in and enjoy herself.
Cas didn’t protest any further. But when Dean got back upstairs from cleaning out his brushes and rollers, the floor cloth had been neatly removed and the rest of the supplies taken down. He just gave Cas a look that was returned with a perfectly innocent arched brow. “Fine. But I’m helping move your stuff back in.”
“I didn’t always work alone. I had a partner. Benny. He was a good friend, and we worked well together. Then he was killed.”
Cas arched a brow at him, his expression going soft. “You thought of them that way too?”
Dean stood to come stand near to Cas.  Not too close, not invading his space. But near. Supportive.
When the sun reached its zenith Dean chunked his shovel deep into the earth and leaned back. “Time for lunch,” he declared, not leaving Cas any room for argument. “This is hot and thirsty work.”
“Yes,” Castiel agreed, shivering with heady desire. “Inside.”
“Um… no? Though I have seen videos of Zepp concerts. God, what I wouldn’t give to have been able to see them live.”
Dean moved to walk slightly ahead of Cas, eyes scanning the street as they moved along. There were many dark corners, a few alleys. Castiel didn’t usually pay much attention to them, since he walked this direction daily. Familiarity caused inattention, in his case. Far too often he paid much more attention to mentally teasing apart translations than to where he placed his feet. Translating wasn’t an exact science, after all, particularly with dead languages. People used idioms that didn’t make sense on a superficial level, so sometimes a literal translation wasn’t the most accurate one. Even a work as popular and well-known as the Bible had multiple translations, where some particular choices could notably change the meaning.
“Zach. Good to see you again.” Dean smiled and shook hands with Adler.
“Oh.” Gabe had the grace to look abashed – briefly, anyhow. “Did you want to decorate the place yourselves?”
“I don’t dance, Dean, you know that.” Cas is flustered.
* * *
“The thanks thing?”
But more important yet was the threat of Walker. After getting settled in and doing enough to disappear in the general madness, Castiel excused himself to use the bathroom, taking his phone with him. Once in the privacy of a stall he took it out, looked for Dean in his contacts.
“One of what?” Now Dean’s curiosity was piqued; that was completely obvious. He leaned forward slightly, his green eyes sparkling with interest, his body language open and eager and filled with anticipation.
Cas barely has time to catch his breath before Dean is moving forward to press their lips together. His lips are plush and soft, warm, silky. Cas has dreamed of this in the dark secrecy of his room for years. He’s seen Dean kiss some of the people he’s brought home, and while he didn’t go out of his way to watch, sometimes it was impossible to miss.
“Well, yeah, it’s better with more people. I could have Sam over. You’ve met Sam.”
Usually.
“You like that.” It wasn’t a question.
“If I was smart I wouldn’t have bought all this stuff,” Gabriel complained. Castiel knew he didn’t mean it. He’d driven out to the general store and bought plenty of cleaning supplies — rags, cleansers for different surfaces, detergent, sponges, mops, dusters. Rubber gloves and face masks, just in case. And an extra-large box of heavy-duty trash bags.
Heat surged, and Dean surged with it. Cas was no innocent virgin, it suddenly dawned on him. He knew that, of course he did. He’d known Cas was in a relationship for years, had lived with Bartholomew, clearly slept with him. He was experienced. And yet his shyness, his reticence, had led Dean to expect a certain tentativeness in his kisses.
They didn’t stay all that long, which Cas was grateful for. More people started arriving, and Cas was starting to feel his shoulders tense.
Dean sat. And waited.
Dean gets home with his new purchases, but leaves them in Baby’s trunk for now. Last thing he needs is for Cas to see him with an outrageous number of shopping bags. Dean and shopping bags don’t really get along. He avoids them wherever possible. Unfortunately it’s not always possible.
“The Novaks. You’re having Claire and Cas? I thought you said…”
He cleared his throat. “Dean?”
“From what we saw of the bank account balances, Hester left you enough to get this place totally fixed up, even without touching any of the family funds.”
“And I was not planning to be able to move to a house of my own. Yes, that is good advice as well. Thank you.”
“Make sure to fill out those forms by the end of the week, and bring them to me in Human Resources,” Cas said, wrapping up. “My office is on the sixth floor. You can also send them interoffice mail if you prefer. Your department admin will fill you in on the requirements for your business line.”
“Yeah, man, it’s good. Meeting with clients and figuring out how to help them is more fun than I expected. It’s cool to eat at different places in town, check out the hot local bar, all on the company dime.” He left out the part about his boss being an ass, mostly because he didn’t want Sam to have anything to worry about.
“Oh shit, it got late,” Dean suddenly exclaimed, looking at his watch. “I really should be heading back to my place.”
Cas took it, a strange warmth in his chest. Dean had bought him a gift? It wasn’t his birthday or Christmas, more traditional gift-giving occasions. Not that he expected Dean to give him gifts for those occasions. They were friends, he was confident in that now. As confident as he could be. But not all friends exchanged gifts.
The door to the antechamber remained closed, but there was someone nearby.
His shoulder brushed against the door frame as he stepped through, feeling the transition from the wood floor of the hallway to the stone of the kitchen. Dean positioned him in a corner he knew was beyond the island, by the windows, facing in.
“I know. Believe me, I know that. I wanted to give you a head’s up, though. They’re not letting it go right away. Maybe they will, if they don’t find anything.”
It might be nothing. There were people who had legitimate reason to be here. But one didn’t get to advance in the security field by assuming anything unexpected was legitimate. Assume the worst.
Dean took a sip of beer, then another, licking the foam from his lips afterwards. “Do you recall hearing about Mr. Tran? Word came that first day we had lunch together.”
Cas growled. “Perhaps so, yes.”
Once he felt confident that he remembered how to read Enochian, he picked up the book and started reading. A formal translation could wait until later; he wanted to get a sense of what the pages contained.
“You actually want to hear me discuss the history of this home?” Cas is surprised.
A wave of mingled relief and fear washed through Castiel. This was a precipice, a narrow ledge, and he could be poised to fall to his doom--and in human form, so he couldn’t just unfold his wings and fly away.
“Dr. Novak?” Mrs. Crombie timidly spoke behind him, a tentative hand brushing against the wool of his coat.
“I quit my job,” he opened without any preamble.
There. It was done. Now he just had to wait until Dean texted him back. Hopefully he would. It was entirely possible that he would have his personal phone turned off. If he didn’t hear back within a reasonable amount of time, he would have to take more direct measures.
“Yeah, I know I don’t have to. But I want to. Do you really want me to leave?”
"Wasn't mocking you, Cas," Dean says, reaching out to squeeze his arm affectionately. Cas' eyes widen before he remembers that they have an audience in his father, so the casual touching is obviously just part of the act. "Just amused, because it's so you."
Charlie worked some of her magic on the laptop. “No one else in the city, but there are some people we might be able to call on, in a crunch.”
Cas blinked, hanging back and pushing his hands into the pockets of his trench coat. “What do you mean? A car?”
“Medium, please.”
Luc answered the door. “Hello, Mr. Novak. I’m Sam Winchester, Mrs. Albright’s lawyer. We met at the service, but I know there were a lot of people there. I’m sorry for your loss.”
“Huh?”
“Eileen? Oh man, Eileen is awesome. She totally kicks ass. Keeps Sam in line just by giving him a look, and that is so cool to watch. I liked her a lot. She’s deaf, so took a little bit for me to remember to face her when I was talking, but she reads lips quite well. I need to sign up for an ASL class, though, so it’s not all on her. That hardly seems fair.”
How absolutely mortifying. “I need to… to go. It was nice to talk to you, Sam. Have a good day.” He hunched his shoulders protectively and turned, walking quickly back towards his car, pretending not to hear Sam calling after him.
“Roger that, boss man,” Garth said, smiling cheerfully.
“It’ll be worth it. I hope.” Dean’s smile faltered a little, then brightened again, but there was a definite edge of nervousness.
He parked and headed up the steps of the front porch, not letting himself give in to the nerves.
Dean blinked, stared at the phone before bringing it back to his ear. “Hi, Cas, nice to hear from you. How are you doing?”
“Damn straight it does. You really think they’ll call me?”
Dean laughed. He would not have expected that out of Cas. “Sure. If that’s how you want to put it.” He crossed over to the old turntable. He moved the speakers so they’d be directed towards the kitchen, then located his prized vinyl and started it playing. “Yeah?”
“Yeah, well… you aren’t wrong,” he grumbled, pulling out a dollar from his wallet and handing it to the extortion artist. She smiled and tucked it into her small beaded bag, a gift from Eileen. He pushed their cart towards the meat section.
He wished, then, that he’d had time to call Sam or even Bobby, ask a little more about this Walker Wing. He had official information, of course, but more and more he wondered just how much of that information was censored, even from security personnel who should be fully informed about potential risks.
“Most likely. But you’re not going for a perfectly manicured look anyhow, are you?”
Sam just rolled his eyes, but for all that, Dean knew he was serious. This house was close to Main, just a couple blocks away from Sam’s office in what the locals called the Professional Building, because the old brick structure happened to house not just Sam’s legal office, but an accountant, a dentist, and an insurance agent. The house’s location alone made it attractive to Sam and Jess when they’d moved here from California. The price made it even more so. Sam might be a lawyer with a degree from a prestigious law school, but he was also a young man newly married. He’d stayed in California at first, but he’d been miserable.
Dean remembered many hot summers during his teen years spent here, helping Bobby fix up the cars that could be saved, eventually doing most of the work himself with only the occasional word of advice from the older man.
Dear God. Dean was experienced, and accomplished at, getting rid of bodies.
Cas is sitting slumped on the couch when Dean gets home from work. He’s eating ice cream right from the carton while Dr. Sexy plays on the TV, dressed in sweat pants and an old tee.
“You said the reception’s open bar, right? And they’re serving some sort of fancy-ass meal? And entertainment for two days before the wedding itself? So it’s essentially an all-expense paid vacation at a country estate?”
He didn’t know what to think, other than that it had to be his fault, somehow. His unintended confession had to be the reason, no matter what office gossip had to say.
He wondered how long he would have to wait until it would be warm enough to start working on those projects. There was undoubtedly something he could begin immediately, clearing away some of the brush, deciding where he wanted to plant things, reviewing articles and gardening catalogs.
* * *
“Clean.” Castiel moved one of the chairs over to the cabinets and climbed up onto it, opening the doors and looking inside. The upper shelves held various bits of china, delicate porcelain with pink roses and gold trim. There were also pieces of glass serving ware, and a silver platter. The pieces were not, perhaps, to his taste, but they were quite nice. Some would be worth keeping and using. The idea of sitting in the front room with a cup of tea served in a delicate cup while a fire roared in the fireplace rather appealed to him.
“Hell no,” Dean disagrees. “One weekend of potential embarrassment and awkwardness between us in exchange for them getting off your case for the foreseeable future? Totally worth it.”
The first few efforts had been questionable, but now? Dean could honestly say Cas had improved immensely. He loved the way the guy applied himself to anything he took an interest in. There were no half measures where Castiel Novak was concerned. If he was going to do something, he was going to master it.
“Ah. Yes, yes, of course.” Well shit. How was he supposed to negotiate this one?
“You can set that as a life goal.”
“Well. You can hardly hole up in here permanently. Even if you did, you’d just end up putting yourself at risk. If they want in, eventually they’ll give up waiting for you to leave. For now, though, just bring the book with us?”
“I called Gabriel, even though I knew Bartholomew would be furious about that too. It was an international call, and therefore outrageously expensive. Gabriel thinks it wasn’t the money, it was that I was talking to someone who cared about me and had a more objective point of view. Gabe knew something was badly wrong, so he returned home. The rest of the story is ugly and lengthy and … and sad, but it ended with me on my own again, this time in an apartment leased by the family under Michael’s name.”
“Hm. I have studied some art.” He turned back towards the closed door to the antechamber, where that big painting of two dragons fighting was centered in the glass. “This painting, for example. Do you know anything about it?”
It was Cas’ turn to be struck dumb.
Castiel cleared his throat, putting on an expression of disgruntlement. “I should think that would be rather self-evident.”
Mr. Roman himself sat behind an immense stately desk. “Good afternoon, Dr. Novak. Thank you for joining me.” He stood up to shake Castiel’s hand. His grip was firm, his hands pale and smooth save for a rough patch along the side of his ring finger.
He caught himself against a nearby table, but his momentum jostled it, vases clinking together and rattling. A gasp sounded from the nearby workers. A vase on the end started to roll. Shit, shit, fuck. He lunged forward, but the box tripped him up again. Somehow he managed to twist his body just enough to avoid crashing into the table and taking it down with him.
Thoughts of Alfie brought a familiar pang. Castiel took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Time and distance softened the ache, but it never entirely went away.
Emma and Claire came into the kitchen then, Emma careening in to collide with his legs. “Daddy. Can we listen to the Zepp ‘Frozen’ song?”
“So if not when you were a kid, when?”
By the time Jody Mills left and Cas limped his way into the makeshift dining area tucked into the corner of the sitting room, Dean had the meal all set up. “You sure you want to stay here tonight?” Dean asked even before Cas had made it to the chairs. “If it creeps you out or anything you’re more than welcome to stay at my place. You can have the bed. I’ll sleep on the couch or something.”
“I’ve been worried about finding Naomi’s replacement. Replacement’s probably the wrong word. Successor. There are some internal candidates, as you know. I’m not sure any of them are really the best choice. But we’re at a bar, playing trivia. Not at work. So, you know. Trying not to bring that up right now. Leave work at work.”
“You want to stay right here, then, and confront whomever may come after you?”
Right now, he didn’t really know why they had come for the funeral either, or even how they had been notified. He did know, however, that he liked it here. It felt right. Soothing.
“No, Dean. Not just a little red and white can.”
“Gabriel. Or at least he arranged for it. I believe he did most of it himself, or at least supervised. He would not delegate such a personal task even farther.”
A wave of fondness swept through him at her word choice. We. She wasn’t a dragon, but she considered herself part of the Novak Wing, even after everything that had happened. Maybe the more so because of it. Shared crises tended to either bring people together or drive them apart. Those humans who remained with the Wing were fiercely devoted to the Novaks, and vice versa.
“Who, me? Hold out? Be anything less than fully committed? No way!” He gripped the noisemaker. “Bring it on, New Year!”
Ellen set a bottle of beer in front of Dean, popping the cap off and tossing it into the bucket behind the bar. “Rumor has it you’ve been working up at the Albright place. That why you haven’t been around much lately?”
“I wouldn’t do formal landscaping. Perhaps some gardens.”
making?” Cas questioned, arching a brow at Dean.
Dean went still. “I can’t tell you that, not right now. It’s premature, not to mention dangerous.”
Dean returned shortly, his jeans still bearing a damp spot, though clearly he’d tried to dry it as best as possible. “It’s better, anyhow,” he said, settling down again. “So. Where were we?”
“Sitting in an armchair with a book, in front of your very own fireplace. With the old wooden windows. It’s so stereotypical I could almost puke, but still. It’s a good look on you. Would be better if the armchair was a rich buttery leather instead of that old velvet monstrosity, but hey, not everything can be perfect.”
He stole a sideways glance at Dean, who had picked his beer bottle up again and started peeling the label off of the amber glass. Oddly, that nervous gesture helped Cas to feel more grounded. “Does Sam know?”
