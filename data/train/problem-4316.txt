Cas narrowed the space between them, it felt nice how natural Cas was about it, how his hands went around Dean’s waist like they always belonged there. Dean’s hand fidgeted, undecided on where to rest them and ended up keeping them by his side. If he got his hands-on Cas, he’d no doubt be late picking up Charlie.
“Yes, so good.” Cas replied not even skipping a beat. Dean relished it. “Your turn now.” He put a hand on Dean’s chest, pushing him back to lie on the bed. He went, falling back into the soft comforter, feet still on the ground.
“Yeah, we’ll see about that short stack.” Dean joked. Charlie dealt him and Sam the cards. They played a few hands of blackjack, some rummy and even a go fish to spice things up and it was good. Normal, almost.
“What?” He snaps. He doesn’t mean to. Cas stiffens up, tries to loosen his hand after being stung, but Dean doesn’t let him go, he doesn’t want Cas to let go. They keep on walking.
When he got back Cas had everything set up, plates, chopsticks for him, fork for Dean, two beers and the clothed lower half of Cas’ body along with the clothed upper half of Dean’s body on the tv, clear as day.
Dean let go to strip his top, then stepped back into Cas’ space, hands finding home in Cas’ hair. In the darkness he could make out Dean’s face getting closer to him, lips edging to his, stopping a fraction away to whisper, “Consider yourself tempted.”
The command was quiet but present, sending goosebumps over Dean’s body. He found himself slipping under the command, wanting to do whatever Cas told him. Moans and whimpers poured from his mouth as he brought himself close to the edge. Behind closed eyes he was picturing Cas on his bed, splayed out, naked, skin flushed, and lips swollen from catching his teeth on them.
They both got a few solid hits in by the time Dean had Cas in a choke hold. His sides ached, his jaw hurt, and the taste of blood flooded his mouth. Cas wasn’t looking too good either.
“I’m going to…” Cas’ voice trailed off then Dean felt a warm palm wrap around his shaft. He bit back the moan that was trying to come out. Hot showers just think of hot showers, maybe even a girl in the hot shower, all suds and bubbles and soft skin being rinsed under the hot steam and yeah, that’s a good image. He closed his eyes, letting himself drift off to his little fantasy as Cas worked his hand up and down Dean’s cock.
“It’s always good.” Dean admitted, a little breathless. His eyes widened at his admittance, he opened his mouth like he was about to back track when Cas pressed his thumb into the slit of Dean’s cock and all that came out was a desperate whine.
“Yes, sir.” He hears Dean mutter. They read in silence while Castiel tries to get his blushing under control. He knows his ears always give him away. Dean calling him sir was not helping with his concentration. They swap papers when Castiel finishes marking them and they get the lift back up to their floor when they’re laundry is done. Its somewhat amicable.
They talked non-stop as they made breakfast. Dean frying the bacon while Cas whipped up the pancake mix. The coffee flowed as smoothly as their conversation did. They spoke about their families, their Thanksgiving plans, their jobs, what their childhoods were like. It seemed they both made a point to talk about the good moments, not wanting to sour their time together. Dean was on board with it, he did have good memories of growing up peppered in-between the not so good ones. Cas did too, being the youngest of four brothers he had lots of stories of what he and his brothers got up to growing up.
There were stains alright, oil stains smeared on parts of Dean’s face, his neck, his arms. Stains on a body that was about as far removed from his imagination as he could get. He was about Castiel’s age, a mechanic, good with his hands probably and Castiel was struck with how fast his body reacted to him. It was like being a teenager all over again. His brain just shooting off too many images for him to keep up that he needed to get away from Dean and then he
“You’re going to need protection. Gordon is still hell bent on killing me, once he gets a whiff that you’re out he’ll be after you too.”
He strips out of his running gear, leaving himself bare and climbs up onto the bed when Dean stops him before he can straddle Dean’s legs. His hand firm on Cas’ chest.
“I can still remember the first lecture he ever gave. He was talking about the ultimate story we can tell is the lives we have lived and continue to live,” Jess smiles thinking back to that memory. “That our stories mattered, that we were interesting enough to make someone want to read what we had to say if we wrote from within. Our dreams, our imagination, our experiences are all worthwhile and not to be afraid to use it when story telling.”
It didn’t take long for Cas to realise how much Dean craved Cas to take him. His beautiful pleas and body practically begging to be touched and held down. It had Cas fantasizing endless ways to bring Dean pleasure. How stunning he’d look wrapped in ropes, tied to a bed and crying out for Cas. He got hard just thinking about it.
good days. One with him leaning against Baby, one of him and Sam laughing their heads off and one of him post the Ice Bucket Challenge with his wet top clinging to his chest because he looked damn fine in it. He also included one of Charlie and him that Sam had took, she had fallen asleep on his chest one sunny afternoon out in the garden. It was cute and it also let people know that he did have a kid. So yeah, four of his best photos. Benny could be doing the exact same thing, or worse, none of them might be the guy. Dean’s seen Catfish.
He turned his head to look at Dean. When did they get this close? Dean’s breathe was hot on his face, his green eyes searching in Cas for something. They were awfully pretty.
“I’m under no illusion you could take me in a fight Dean. You are stronger than I am and yet if my memory serves me you lay there moaning and writhing on my bed while I swallowed your cum drop by drop. Don’t tell me I made you do anything you didn’t want to happen.”
Too consumed by his thoughts Dean let his guard down, too distracted by the memories of Cas’ tattoos, his body, he didn’t register that the shower room had emptied rapidly, well emptied of anyone other than a group of particularly white shaved head prisoners.
Dean turned his head, eyes glaring at the man he had spent the best part of two months successfully avoiding.
He was nothing but a petty thieve to begin with, he had to work his way up the chain of command, prove himself and he did. The tattoos were symbols of his status, each one earned in blood or service. He met Gabriel along the way, the Pakhan’s youngest brother, they were of similar age and grew to be brothers. Eventually they were both sent to America to help out the Pakhan’s sister, Anna. She was head of the Bratva over here.
When he walked to his front door, he was met with the back of a brown leather jacket and sandy blonde hair styled hair.
He did, riding Cas with a fever he could only explain as an animal in heat. Sweat dripped down his body as he fucked himself back on Cas, driving his cock deeper and deeper inside of him, never wanting it fully out, only want Cas filling him up. Cas’ brutal grip on his ass cheeks were going to leave bruises on him for days, same for the hickey’s blossoming on his neck to replace the faded ones. He loved it, to have Cas’ mark on him, staking his claim that Dean was his and no one else’s. Loved everything about it.
He stopped in his tracks, eyes taking in how obvious it was Dean sitting on Cas’ bed. There no doubt that he was him, even behind his glasses he could make himself out. Cas must distort the image or something when he edited it. Dean had been used to seeing slightly pixelated versions of their videos, not the HD version he currently saw on the tv screen.
It looked like Cas had done some setting up of his own too. Mixing bowl and scales among other things that probably had names that Dean didn’t recognise all laid out on the kitchen counter. Dean dropped the canvas bag next to them.
Eventually he did turn around, he couldn’t ignore Cas’ commands forever. Cas took his face in his hands, wiping away his tears off his cheek bones even though more continued to fall.
“A date would be nice,” Castiel replies. Dean’s eyes brighten at that, the smile on his face growing. “To make it up to me.”
Castiel hadn’t connected the dots that the person Jessica had texted that day in his office was Sam, the Sam from the bakery who has been buying more cherry pies recently for his brother who loves them, and that Dean loves cherry pie. Conclusion being Sam is Dean’s brother and by the looks of Sam’s arm swung around her shoulder, Jessica and Sam are together.
It was two more beers later when Cas came home, equally buzzed. Dean could hear him from the couch dropping his keys and grumbling to himself which he did when he had had a few.
Dean shut his eyes, biting his lip harder fighting the urge to answer even though they both knew the answer was going to be yes. Cas felt generous and started to move down Dean’s thighs.
He opened the other two conversations that were ticking on. One with a woman called Lydia, the other with a guy called Benny. Lydia had sent him a peach emoji with a question mark.
“Then fuck him.” Cas talking nonchalant about Dean fucking someone did things to him. It was like they were talking about the damn weather Cas was that casual about it. Dean wasn’t a prude, definitely not but the way Cas’ said fuck had him debating taking off his flannel from the warmth. That didn’t deter him from storing the audio bite of Cas saying fuck in his wank bank because his deep gravelly voice saying fuck over and over was what Dean had been missing in his nighttime sessions. He needed to stay on track though, not get carried away with fantasies that were too easy sometimes. Fantasies were one thing, actually doing it was another.
He passed it, moving on to Masters who was standing outside of his cell, topless, trousers slung low on his hips. Cas didn’t pause, didn’t talk to him just walked right into his cell and Masters followed in.
Cas got up to walk back outside, with his coffee in hand while Dean served up two slices of apple pie. Cas was sitting on the bench that Dean had also made. It wasn’t a standard size park bench. He didn’t have enough wood left over from the tree house, so it was more a loveseat. Dean debated bringing out a chair to sit on from inside, but he didn’t really fancy it. One, wanting to be close to Cas and two, their body heat would help them being outside in the cold. He plonked himself down beside his friend and the lack of shock or tension from the guy let him know he was ok with it. When Cas relaxed into it more, let his leg go lose and touch Dean’s he knew he might be more than ok with it. Dean hoped his dumb face wasn’t giving anything away.
It was a difficult situation. On one hand Dean was glad Cas had saved him from the Nazi, that he didn’t have to experience what they were going to do to him, if he even survived it. On the other, the display Cas did of his power over the Nazi for the sake of Dean was never going to go unnoticed. Dean wasn’t part of the Russian gang, the only logical reason why Cas intervened at all was because he owned Dean.
“It wanted it to be you too,” Cas admitted, voice cracking under the weight of what they were doing to each other. His hand went to grip Dean’s thigh tight. “I’ve wanted you for so long Dean, you have no idea how long I’ve wanted this, wanted you.”
“There would have been easier ways to go about that than stealing my phone from my pocket.” He advances on Dean, tries again for his phone. The extra inch Dean has on Castiel he is using to his advantage. His arm strains to reach it from Dean’s grasp. Their close, an inch between them and Castiel can feel Dean breathes on his face as he tries to make himself as tall as possible.
“Slack your jaw.” Cas pushed Dean’s jaw down with the order and Dean obeyed letting it relax completely. “That’s a good boy.”
He stuffed the cloth back into his overalls. It was coming on 12:45. He needed to get going if he was going to make it to Cas’ work on time.
“Cool stars.” Charlie said pointing to them. Dean agreed, the stars were cool, but Dean couldn’t even read the address let alone the time. Cas plucked it from his hand, turned it over and Cas had written the details in legible writing. Time, address and his phone number.
He could love this man outside of these four walls too, out in the real world. When their sentences were over, that bedroom he imagined could be a reality and they’d have a life together, whatever they wanted, however they wanted…then he remembered the cross in the center of Cas’ chest. Cas belonged to something bigger than Dean. The Bratva. He remembered the code that Cas had spoken about once. The rules he lived by. They were similar to the ones that Sam and he had unconsciously lived by, except the one about relationships. Cas couldn’t have one, or at least that was how Dean remembered it to sound like. He had to be sure.
“Feels good huh?” Dean asked, he pressed his thumbs harder into the muscle. Another sigh, this time more audible. Cas put the notebook down, let it rest on his chest still on his marked page as he stared at Dean.
They both lean over the counter to inspect the markings that Gabriel has pressed into the crust to differentiate the fillings. There isn’t much left, two berries, one apple, a spiced pear.
“Gross Dean come on! This was a clean shirt.” Sam pushes Dean away. Sam had a few inches on his brother now, gave him the unfortunate upper hand.
He looked up to keep an eye on Charlie. She was in the train, pretending to drive it with another kid. Her choo choo noises carried over to him on the bench. He re-opened the messages.
He’s in a good mood because him and Cas are back on good terms after nearly a month of avoiding his obnoxiously cute neighbor. Looks like Dean could still hold a grudge.
The expectation of something happening once they were locked in for the night was there. It was what they did before the Empty, Dean assumed it would carry on after he got out. It didn’t though, Cas made no advances on Dean and he wasn’t going to go looking for it either, at least not tonight. He was shattered, eyes hanging out of him. Tomorrow was another day to see if the Russian was still game for mutual orgasms.
And it didn’t take long for Cas to pick up on it, his hands started to move further down Dean’s back, kneading into the top of Dean’s ass. Dean hid his head in the pillow, trying to hide the pink on his cheeks from the Russian and muffle of his moan. There was nothing straight about this, literally nothing about getting off to a guy who had his hands on your ass.
They did for Anna. She’s beautiful and managed to be freed from the grasps of the nuns are twelve years old. Adopted and managed to have some sort of a childhood though everyone knows once you’ve lived in Heaven’s Little Angels you do lose a part of yourself in there. Her eyes would never be as bright as they could be. They sucked that out of you in there.
Huh, that was weird. Usually a no-go area. Dean wasn’t about to tell her that, perhaps she didn’t know the correct protocols and he needed those boxers and top to get him through the week. He huffed some resemblance of a thank you and headed in the direction of the laundry room.
Christ, he sounded pathetic, but it seemed Cas got off on it, his hand reaching down to take a hold of his cock trapped in his jeans. He cursed quietly, rubbing himself once, maybe twice before he got himself under control and moved his hand back to Dean’s cock, those skilled fingers and warm palm taking a hold of him and bringing him over the edge.
,” Cas moved his hand up to Dean’s jaw to get a hold of it. “And put my cock in this pretty mouth.” He started to tug Dean’s head down. This wasn’t happening. This can’t be happening. Cas wouldn’t do this to Dean. He never does this to Dean. Cas never wanted Dean to do this kind of thing unless Dean wanted it to even though he technically
“No, I just…” Dean moved to sit on the chair. “I used to beat the crap out of anyone who looked at me the wrong way in here and now it feels like I’m back to square one.”
He likes messing with his brother. A daily duty he feels obliged to fulfil. The sound of Sam’s voice lets him know he’s rattled him enough for one day.
“People no,” Cas licked his lips, taking in Dean’s commanding presence. “You though, entirely different matter. I could watch you all day.”
“You son of a bitch, it’s so on.” He said and mirrored the action, slicking his hand. Cas sped up. Dean followed.
“I bet you’ve tasted every pie in this place.” Dean remarks with a new tone Cas has yet to hear from Dean, envy. Dean does love pie.
“Sammy, I told you already, just keep with the puppy dog eyes and eventually you’ll get that sucker down to only asking for five dollars.”
Thing was, Dean had all day. He was one year into his sentence, a whole lot more to go. Dean had so many days in here he wasn’t even gonna try counting. For now, he was just gonna try to not get sent back to Empty.
The only safe haven he has is the bakery where he hides out on Saturday eating more cookies than he has sense. Gabriel and Kevin are busy serving customers out front, Castiel hides in the back reading his book and enjoying his broken dark chocolate chip cookies.
are making brownies.” Dean clarified. Cas took out butter, flour, chocolate, eggs, sugar, vanilla essence, more chocolate, cocoa powder and a packet M&Ms.
He could have blamed the alcohol, or the fact that he knew that their heating was going to get shut off again for the second time this year if they didn’t think of something quick. His friend looked over at him, head tilting trying to understand the smile that was making its way onto Dean’s face, then he clocked what he was insinuating.
He wanted to say that he gave Cas the biggest glare of his life but he’d be lying, no, instead he looked at his friend longing, earnest, blissed out and vulnerable because he’d give him anything he wanted as long as he got to cum with Cas’ hand on his cock.
“Not forever Dean,” Cas said. His sure hands moved down his body, taking two handfuls of his ass and squeezing. Christ it felt good. “I can’t keep doing this, pretending I don’t feel things when I do, pretend I don’t want you every waking moment.”
Castiel checks his phone. 8pm. Ok, so not too late for Castiel to be this annoyed at him. He has yet to even see the guy and he’s already annoying. The building had been quiet for the last four years, apart from one six-month period when drug dealers lived downstairs and the place had to raided. Other than that, the only interaction he’s had with his neighbors is when he’s checking mail, in the lift or doing laundry in the basement and even then, it’s a few words at most. This guy isn’t even a day living here and he’s disturbed Castiel’s sleep and precious cookie eating time.
41, 42, 43, 44. Dean pushed through his second set of push-ups that morning. Being in the Empty meant he didn’t get enough space to be able to do this outside where he usually worked out. The cubic space he got to stand in for half an hour a day he could stretch out his arms and touch either side easily. No room in there to actually break a sweat. He refused to lose his strength in the Empty, especially as he was supposed to be going back into Purgatory, into gen pop today, if the warden kept his promise that was.
“Just shuffle.” Dean handed him the cards. He needed a distraction. Masters moans were louder than usual, Dean couldn’t take it, throwing his cards down and storming back up to his cell to drown out the noise by sticking his head in his pillow, or down the toilet. Anything to not hear what Cas was doing to Masters. The things he wanted done to him.
“Sure sweetheart.” Dean released her from his grip. Bella walked back towards the stairs to attend to her friend who Cas had made up. “Cas what was—”
Cas groaned, feeling Dean squeeze his hand that bit tighter around their cocks. The heat of Dean’s erection sliding against his was pushing him over the edge. “Fuck, I’m—”
They take a stroll through town after breakfast. Dean feels good, good food, good coffee and well, Cas aint so bad either. He was nervous, couldn’t sleep very well thinking about Cas’ story and their date, texting Sam at stupid o clock in the morning asking the best place for breakfast. When he saw Cas in his pajamas, sleepy eyed and soft part of him wanted to pick him up, bring him back to bed and nap for the whole day tangled in each other’s limbs. He wanted to do that one day, that and lots of other situations he had running around his mind. Situations he thought he’d never get to experience till around 3am last night.
The heatwave finally dies down. Dean was just about done with the sun and all it has to offer. Fixing up cars in that heat was unfair. A normal September day rolls in and he manages most of the day without wrapping the top half of his overalls around his waist. In a rush to get home and change for his shift at the Roadhouse, Dean keeps his overalls on, the sleeves tied in the front. His face and arms have oil smudges on them, and his hands are a mess but fuck it, it wasn’t like he is going to be running into anyone. His apartment building is a ghost town.
Dean puts it upon himself to figure out a pet name for Cas because well, Cas isn’t entirely sure the reason why, but Dean tries none the less. They’re in bed, post orgasms and Cas is smearing Dean’s cum on his stomach, making patterns and enjoying his afterglow while Dean rambles on above him.
“Would you like me to read aloud?” Cas suggests. Again, like it’s no big deal. He doesn’t necessarily want to get into the habit of falling asleep during Cas reading to him even if his reading voice is gentle and the lack of much infliction sort of lulls him off. Fuck it, he’s tired.
Cas smiled, bringing his mouth to Dean’s ear to whisper into it, “I’m going to break you Dean, till you’re begging for me to give you release.”
Dean followed the girls to get a look at their many masterpieces. His phone dinged again. This time it was the photo Cas had taken. It gave him a big goofy smile and he saved it immediately. The girls had painted on every page Cas had left out. Stars and symbols and sponges decorated the pages with the galaxy colours the present provided. They weren’t half bad, a few might even find their way onto the fridge at his home. He noticed one of them, it had four figures in it. Two tall ones, two short ones under a bunch of star sponge prints.
He took the chair, creating some distance between them. Cas noticed him shuffling it back but didn’t question it, choosing to sit on the edge of his bed, elbows on his knees waiting for Dean to start talking. He forgot how much ink Cas had on his arms and hands while in the Empty, he was practically a walking Russian mural.
“You’re a bit of a dick, you know that.” Dean says. It’s not a question, no infliction in his tone. He’s upset Dean, somehow. The talking needs to stop, Castiel really needs to read these papers. He hands Dean one he’s already marked in hopes that will work. It earns him a warm smile.
Cas took Dean’s hand off of him so he could turn Dean around, pushing him over the back of the couch. He shoved Dean’s jeans and boxers down in one go, pooling them at his ankles.
He shot out of his chair so fast it fell to the floor behind him. Uncaring he left his room at pace to cross the space to Cas not even knocking as he entered. Cas sat at his computer desk, head turning to see Dean standing there in his pyjamas, glasses still perched on his nose and dick tenting in his pants.
This was what he was worried about. Cas protecting him like that. It looked like he was stating a claim, marking what’s his and that no one was allowed to touch him. If anyone else had seen that, they would have walked on, none of their business. It shouldn’t have been any of Cas’ business, then he made it is, he made Dean his business and the whole fucking prison knew about it.
“It’s true,” he moved his hand further up Dean’s thigh, such assurance and confidence in his movements. It was everything to Dean. Cas’ tone, dark and smooth, like a siren in the ocean so alluring. His breath warm on the side of Dean’s face. “I want to hear it again.”
“I could show you,” He reaches out to touch Dean’s chest, a flat palm resting over a slightly faded tattoo. He smirks at the bodily reaction Dean has. He worries when Dean’s eyes shut, unsure if it’s to revel in his touch or Dean working at the auto-shop then a shift at the Roadhouse. “If you’re not too tired that is.” He brushes his hand over Dean’s peck, catching his nipple with his movement.
After his run he was waiting with bated breathe for Dean to arrive. He hadn't even showered, still in his running gear. The endorphins were simmering in him and he needed more. He needed Dean and when the boy finally arrived and opened his bedroom door Cas couldn’t help himself, getting off his chair and walking over to shove him against the door in a loud slam, his hands reached for what they sorely missed.
Castiel swipes his thumb to where the smudge ends, behind Dean’s ear where his hairline begins, it means Dean has to crane his neck to the side for Castiel to get to it, which he does with ease, giving Castiel his whole neck to touch. He refrains, barely. Castiel does this action twice, maybe three times. Something about Dean exposing his neck for Castiel is enticing.
Cas had managed to get himself up off of Dean, now sitting upright though with Dean’s legs over his as Dean was in no mood to move at the moment. The mention of Cas getting sick was churning his own stomach.
“I think question four was the hardest, I mean how are you supposed to answer in a hundred words or less, wait…what’s that?” Jo asked, eyeing up something on Dean’s neck.
Dean wasn’t going to let it happen that easily. He couldn’t. He had to fight, he had to try. Dean shoved Alastair back. The Nazi stumbled, laughing. The other AB crowded his space, punching Dean in the stomach, making him keel over. The other kicked the back of his leg, made him drop to the tiled floors hard. Alastair watched as his men held Dean down, pulling Dean’s arms back hard till it hurt. He wanted to shout, cry out for help but he couldn’t. He’d either die for snitching or let Alastair do whatever he wanted to do to Dean and have some chance of surviving it. The urge to fight was so strong in Dean though, he wanted to tear them apart, hear their bones crack. He struggled in the Nazi’s grip, if he could just get away.
Cas pushed Dean's head back down onto his cock. Dean let his mouth go slack, knowing what was coming and couldn’t fucking wait for it either, with his hands braced he felt Cas lift his hips up off the bed, sliding himself deeper into Dean’s mouth till he hit the back of his throat. He gagged a little, a reaction he couldn’t control. Cas eased back down just to ease back up again, building up a motion that was toe curling for Dean, spine shivering and downright excruciating. Tears filled his eyes as he got skull fucked with a relentless pace.
“Don’t try anything stupid Winchester.” He warned. Dean huffed, slightly snarling his teeth trying to keep his rage inside of him. The dining room had their eyes on them both. Cas even came out of the kitchen to see what was going on. Their eyes met for a split second. Cas looked like he was about to come over when Balthazar physically blocked him. Zachariah pulled his attention away by shoving him towards the exit.
“If I say that to him, will he piss off too?” Dean asked planting himself in the chair. He ran a hand over his hair trying to soothe himself back to some rational state of calm. The heat nearly made him sweat through his clothes, his hair damp from it.
Cas inhaled deeply, chest rising under his trench coat. Dean knew that breath. He was about to possibly disappoint his daughter. “Maybe another time, your Dad is coming to take you to your swimming lessons and then back to his for dinner and a movie, remember?”
He thought she’d want a relatively PG kiss goodbye. He was wrong. Lisa pressed her chest against his and snaked a hand under his coat to get him closer. When he deepened the kiss, her breath hitched. She told him next time she’d drop Ben off to her parents so Dean could come inside. Dean wasn’t opposed to that idea. He needed to clean his brain of Cas and she’d do the job just fine. The last few months all he’d been able to think about was a 6ft man, she was far from that image.
“Ok.” she ran back to her friends satisfied with the turn of events. Dean still had to make sure it was ok what he did though. They both started to get up off their hunkers.
The Russians were out during yard-time. Cas sitting in the middle of their table acting like nothing had happened when the whole Purgatory knew they missed count. Nothing was secret in there.
“But Dean,” Cas tilted his head in confusion. “The connotations of wearing someone else’s’ clothes…”
He gets handed his burrito, still warm wrapped in foil. They eat in silence for a bit before Cas feels the need to drum up some conversation. He is the guest after all.
“Keep your hand under the tap, I’ll be back.” Cas lets go of Dean’s wrist and rushes out of his apartment. Dean pulls out one of his stools to sit on to wait. The cold water starts to numb his hand.
That explained the sudden bout of nerves in his friend. He had been watching them. Dean nodded, pursing his lips unsure what to do with that information. Granted there was a part of him that was curious to see the uncut versions of their videos. He only got to see the finished product once Cas uploaded it. “How’s it going?” he asked trying to be casual.
“No Cas, I…just put your top on.” He puts his top on begrudgingly. Dean sighs. If this had been Sam, he would have shoved him under the shower to snap the sober back into him. His patience wearing thin at this stage. He gets Cas’ pajama bottoms up and turns down the duvet hoping Cas takes the hint to get in without instruction.
. It felt like a slow burn that Dean was willing to go along with, the innocent Cas that Dean didn’t want to scare away. He was going to play the long game as painful as it was starting to become.
“Yeah,” Dean shook his head, recomposing himself. “I’m good, promise.” He dropped the stack of food onto the coffee table, spreading it out to give Cas what was his and Dean what was his.
He felt the tear drop to his cheek, not really sure what he’s hearing, reeling Cas’ words over and over. That didn’t sound like he was saying no because he wasn’t saying no, he was saying yes. Yes, to Dean and to Charlie and to a life with them. The shock of hearing his name in that tone had sent Dean spiraling when he didn’t need to spiral. Cas wasn’t going to leave. He was going to stay.
“Kinda is,” Dean replied. He sat up in the bed, suddenly feeling more awake than when he got in. This was going to a story for the ages. He could tell. “So, what happened?"
“You for real?” he sounded so elated that if Cas had a heart, he’d almost feel bad about the fact he just wanted to keep Sam busy for ten or so minutes while he went in search of his older brother.
Dean inhaled, exhaled a shaky breath. “I thought-” Crap his eyes were welling up, he closed them, not wanting the tears to fall. “I thought you wanted me.”
They stayed like that for a beat or two. Dean’s head buried in the crook of Cas’ neck panting at how full he felt, consumed by nothing but Cas and trying to keep himself from cumming untouched because it had been so long since he’d been fucked, and it was a sensory overload. Combined with the weight of what it meant to have Cas, his Cas inside of him, he knew he wouldn’t last long once Cas got moving.
Taking a breathe, he took a bit of a risk and put his arm around Cas while his head was down. The gap was there for him to do it without much effort. A smooth move, if Dean was on a date in a cinema and not in a cell in Purgatory. He waited for Cas to pull away, tackle Dean to the ground, shiv him in the neck, none of those things came. His hand rested on Cas’ bare shoulder, probably wrapped around his wings and all it took was the tiniest tug and Cas’ body fell into Dean’s side.
The thing was that Dean had started to like Cas, like him more than just his body. Along with the mutual mind-blowing orgasms came the conversations after, their friendship kindling in their afterglow when the lights in their block were turned off. It was like the darkness brought this blanket of safety between them, safety to tell each other things they’d never tell anyone else in here.
“We going to actually do some work or are you going to…you know…” Dean hesitated to say it. Cas turned to see the slightest tinge of pink painted itself onto the tops of his ears. It made Cas smirk. He had given Dean a week to seek him out and he only managed three days.
“I’m gonna – shit,” Dean had to choke back another moan. Cas was making it a bit difficult for him to form words with his damn skillful hand. “Let go a bit, if that’s cool?”
Dean looked around, saw her standing there in her favourite polka dot pajamas, hair a mess from tossing and turning in her sleep. “What’s wrong kiddo?”
How they got here? Funny story. The same as most of their genius ideas came about, they were drunk at a house party.
“And how the hell would they be able to cook up something like Angel Grace in Purgatory?” Sam questioned the legitimacy of that rumour. It was a bit of a stretch to think something like could be happening in here in broad day light.
Dean’s car comes up to their apartment building at around one in the morning. He waits till he hears Dean in his own apartment before going over. The pit in his stomach won’t be going away any time soon till he deals with this. Dean and he were finally in a good space, no arguing, no miscommunications and one glitch in Castiel’s brain could potentially ruin it.
“Cas, it doesn’t need to be perfect, I’m going soft over here.” He looked down at his dick trapped in his boxers. He got himself hard on his own. They didn’t need to drag this out longer than they had to. A quick hand job and nothing more, then they could get back to their Terminator movie marathon.
They laughed. It was light. Good, Dean needed it to be light if he was going to get through this. His boundaries of Cas remaining in fantasy land were well and truly dismantling. He didn’t need for the whole land to sink under the ocean. He could chalk this up to just body anatomy and needs rather than feelings, or desires or whatever else Dean felt for the guy. Like he said early, who could blame him for getting his rocks off to that? Anyone would have and Cas seemed pretty lax about sex so, yeah, it would be fine.
This lasts about three weeks before Castiel decides he needs to be brave and do something about it. On his calendar is a meeting with Jessica and he takes the opportunity to bring up Dean. She never brings up that night, Castiel appreciates it. He is going to have to in order to figure out how to get past the concrete wall that was Dean’s anger. She knocks on his office door.
Sam stepped in, suited and booted straight from work. Not even the corporate world could get that brother of his to cut his hair. “Charlie’s getting her shoes on upstairs.”
“Yours?” it doesn’t work. He sighs, putting the paper in his lap to lift his head up to Dean who’s leaning over as far as he can to get a look at them.
“Are you?” Gordon ran his hand along the steel table. “Seems to me that the Russian has lost interest in you these days.”
Dean’s at the auto-shop, doing what he usually does, fixing cars, talking to Benny and trying not to piss off Bobby too much. The last part doesn’t go too well, he’s whistling underneath a car he’s working on and gets a kick in the ankle. He can see the boot and knows the culprit it belongs to.
The riot was under control for the time being though murmurs of another one was getting loud among the inmates. Sam sat on the bench out in the yard with the Russians, never too far away from them now. A heaviness found itself in his chest as he thought of his brother. If he was ok, if he was still sane after over two months of being locked up in nothingness. He missed him. The carnage would be easier with him around.
Okay so he might have been looking, sue him and just because the confusing emotional feelings for Cas were gone didn’t mean the
Panic flared in Dean and he pushed the man away from reach. Cas stumbled, hand on his chest where Dean had forced him back. Had he read this all wrong?
Dean just hushes him, clearly in no rush and Cas regrets ever letting Dean Winchester into his life because he’s a tyrant and Cas doesn’t do small and precious, he doesn’t but then Dean licks the shell of his ear and he whispers, “Be good for me angel.”
Despite spending the majority of his life cooped up in an orphanage Castiel’s life had turned out ok. The orphanage left much to be desired, between praying, learning and more praying Castiel was just about done with God and all he had to offer. Heaven’s Little Angels (don’t let the name fool you) was about as loving and affectionate as the hellhounds he learned about when he was a kid. Nothing says ‘we care’ more than putting that kind of fear into an 8-year-old.  He was just relieved the place didn’t eat his soul completely away, others weren’t as lucky.
“Good. I love skull fucking a pretty mouth.” A smirk found its way to Cas’ face. Dean mirrored it, face flushing with the compliment he’d never been given before by someone. Girls never tended to go around telling Dean he had a pretty mouth. Cas saying it though…
“Linda.” she put her hand out. He shook it. The Stepford wife’s collection cackled like a coven of witches, two of them were even dressed as such. It suited them. “I’m tempted to feed some sugar to their kids, get them nice and hyper, what do you think?”
A couple of evenings ago he was in on a Wednesday night, Sam ditching him to study in the library or whatever lie he spun in the afternoon cancelling their plans to hang out. Dean knows when Sam is lying. He didn’t push it, probably wanting to see Jess or something. This left Dean planless and with no food in because his plan was to go get a bite to eat with Sam. Cue Cas knocking on his door till, he answered offering him dinner like
“Come in Jessica.” He stands up from behind his desk. She comes in, bag on her shoulder, blonde hair tied back off her face. Jessica sits on the chair opposite him about to take out her notebook to listen to the notes Castiel has made on part of her draft. She knows he isn’t one for idle chat, likes to get to the point of the meeting and not waste time. This time was going to be different, awkward, for both of them.
“I do work here,” Dean replies. He isn’t too sure how he feels about Gabriel still, apart from the time he hated the guy for shacking it up with Cas that turned out to be not true, he still hadn’t made his mind up yet on the baker. “What’ll it be?”
“Allegedly.” Bobby pointed out. They all rolled their eyes at that. Allegedly meant yes. There were cameras in the dining room. People would have seen that. Shurley would have seen that. Cas must have some sway up in Purgatory to only get essentially a slap on the wrist of two years in Hell for something as rough as that. Then again, the way Uriel was treated was similar, he got away with so much. The guards were as scared of him as the rest of them were.
Cas told him everything, no details spared just one continuous monologue of his date, from when he saw the guy in the bar to now where he was fucking the guy from behind in the bathroom stall. It had Dean aching in his pyjama bottoms. From the story Cas clearly liked manhandling people, liked it a bit rough and it was everything Dean loved in a sexual partner. He liked that kinda of attention on him, liked to be roughed around and when the other person knew how to do it right, do it like Cas sounded to be doing with this guy, it was downright euphoric.
Two drinks and three songs later and his jealousy had quietened down. Meg had found him sulking and dragged him onto the dancefloor. With the sundown the sea of hot bodies became one and Cas moved his in time with the hypnotic beat that blared through the speakers. His hands holding onto Meg’s as they danced together.
“Not really.” She admits. He can see her eyes starting to well up. Castiel isn’t great with emotions, especially sadness. He wasn’t allowed to show it at the orphanage, never show any weakness to the other kids, never let God know you’re sad because he created you, you need to be grateful for your existence. The sadness in his students usually related to academic stress, Castiel could cope with that kind of sadness. It was more a release that needed to happen, a bottling up of keeping it all together, the load of work, the pressure of the college, the pressure of parents, etc.
“Who’s going to stop me?” Gordon continued man handling Dean, pressing into the cuts on his chest making Dean cry out in pain. He was writing underneath Gordon, wincing as he drew blood from Dean’s cuts. When he felt Gordon’s hand slip under his trousers he shouted out for help, hoping someone, anyone would hear him.
Castiel finishes up a lecture Friday afternoon already counting down the hours till the weekend. He’s not even looking forward to his weekend he finds it unnecessary to be delivering new material to students when they have their mid-terms next week. The students weren’t listening and that is just the ones that manage to show up. Many of them locked in their rooms or the library trying to cram as much as they could into their brains. If he was course director, he’d be offering revision lectures but sadly he didn’t have that kind of authority, Naomi wielding her power over him demanding new material to get ahead of the game before the break. As if anyone would be studying over the holidays.
He unfortunately had to go pick up Charlie, not unfortunate to go see his daughter, just unfortunate he didn’t get enough time to repay the orgasm or get up to much else other than the best blowjob he’d have in a seriously long time.
Dean looked over at his brother. Sam had fought back his own tears. His head held a little higher, shoulders pushed back like their Dad taught them. Memories came to Dean of their Dad squatting down in front of them when they were kids, giving the boys a pep talk before he left for another job that had no end date. They wouldn’t know when he’d come back, they wouldn’t know if he’d come back.
“I’m never leaving the bar again,” he states matter of fact when he returns. Dean shakes off the unwanted attention and turns to face the bar to take another order. A familiar face is staring back at him.
His precum wasn’t enough though, not enough to avoid a chaffed rub out. Cas knew that and licked his palm to help him. It was obscene and Dean saved it to his memory wank bank. Cas’ spit covered hand now back on Dean’s cock and jerking him off with a confident steady pace. All Dean could do was hold on for dear life and pray he kept his mouth shut. Cas did anything but kept his mouth shut. It’s like the silent, brooding Russian enjoyed not only ruining Dean with his hand and mouth, no, the sick fuck liked to use his words too.
“Yes, each drop is an inmate. You want little Winchester to be added to it?” he threatened Sam. If Dean didn’t do it, Balthazar was going to kill his brother. He had no choice.
“So, what you’re saying is,” Dean starts to talk. Castiel turns his head so fast he feels a little light headed. Dean is still looking at the ground. “that we got off on the wrong foot.”
The sound of Cas’ lips popping off of his skin was obscene. He went on his elbows to see Cas admiring the mark blossoming. “And?” Cas asked, slightly smirking at Dean’s reckoning. Dean watched as Cas became friends with the inside of his thigh, all lips and tongue and
“Relax lev.” Cas whispered low enough for just the two of them to hear. Somehow the pet name helped. Being called lev by Cas was something he missed being in the Empty. The name meant Cas was content and Dean liked being the reason Cas was feeling that way. Maybe he could be a decent enough prag for the Russian after all. Making them happy was part of the job description.
The thumb nail was Cas’ hand over Dean’s boxers. What a tease Mr. Novak, not even letting the good people get a look see at the goods. He settled himself back further onto his bed, sitting horizontal with his back against the wall, laptop in lap and beer between legs. Dean hovered his fingers over the mouse pad, to click or not to click. Fuck it, he wanted to see it.
He had been keeping things from Sam. Trying to tell himself he was doing it to keep Sam’s mind at ease when probably it was more to avoid the judgement and concern his brother would give him. His attraction towards Cas was something he kept inside the cell, clearly the Russian didn’t have the same sentiments if his minions were picking up on it.
Dean nodded.  “Course sweetheart, doors always open for friends.” Dean smiled at her. He shared the smile with Cas too. Cas returned it warmly and easily.
Dean was too emotive for his own good sometimes, the feelings of the last exchange he had to do were bubbling up to the surface, the way Cas threw him off of him like he was a fly that needing swatting. He didn’t need that again. The face Cas gave him made him think he wasn’t about to lose a pint of blood which was something. His harsh edges were soft, eyes almost apologetic as they looked at Dean.
“How about because of the tiny detail that Gordon wants to slit my throat? The only reason you own my ass is, so you can protect ME. I shouldn’t be the one having to protect YOU, especially from your own damn stupidity. You die, I die remember?” He shouted, louder than he intended.
Cas watched him go, finding it hard to pull away from how the fabric of his shirt stretched over his back, how it rose a little showing a strip of skin above his jeans. Dean looked over his shoulder to see Cas looking back at him. Green meeting blue once more before he vanished into the pounding music to press his body against hers.
“No, I’m not with any gangs.” He replied. The guy sat up on the bed, swung his feet around to plant them on the ground in one swift movement. His elbows resting on his kneecaps. There were more tattoos on his other hand, symbols and letters. Dean spotted something creeping out under his sleeve, the end of feathers maybe.
He stayed for ten minutes after then said he had to go pick up Charlie. He didn’t have to, not for another hour but he didn’t feel like staying any longer. Dean got what he wanted, or at least a version of what he wanted. What he really wanted was yet to come.
“Cas, fuck me, c’mon just fucking – fuck – fuck me.” He blabbered, completely incoherent and riding the fingers stretching him open because yeah, he was eager and needy and when it came down to it basically a massive cock slut.
“Well lucky for you the mood struck me today,” Dean reached for his book that he left on the bed, he opened up a page that had a piece of paper in it, detailing their project. Cas took it before Dean could, scanning his eyes over it.
Dean wants to tell them to turn it down, that’s it’s a Wednesday and coming up close to midnight. He does, he really does then everyone starts singing along to the chorus and he can’t help himself joining along. He’s happy, he’s buzzed and it’s a great song to sing to.
“Let’s see what you picked then.” he said. She pointed to the galaxy poster paint set, fully equipped with intergalactic paint brushes. Metallics paint, glitter paints, the whole nine yards for ages 5+. Claire was four, close enough. He took it off the shelf and handed it to his daughter to hold. She liked holding things. Dean didn’t.
Being pushed up against walls had turned into muscle memory for Dean, it meant sex, it meant good times but right now all he wanted was to punch Cas in the face yet his body betrayed him, heat rising up his neck at the sign of strength from his friend, his lover. Their bodies this close always set him off. He licked his lips, unaware of the move till he clocked Cas’ eyes darting down to them.
Cas walked through the back door. For someone who worked in the kitchen his apron was always spotless, like he never actually did any cooking in there. He had a smoke in his hand.
“We all got our eyes on you Winchester.” He heard to guard say as he walked off. Dean dropped his head between his shoulders.
Dean’s face flushed. He forgot about that. A couple of whiskey’s and a particularly lonely night he was sending Lydia explicit messages about what he’d do to her if they were together. Though admittedly when he talked about sliding his cock into your full lips, they weren’t hers he was picturing.  The ones in his mind matched the ones he was currently looking at, slightly chapped and pale in colour. Ones that were dying for some moisture Dean would be more than happy to give.
“You can throw her in the bath, warm her up.” Dean joined him, shoving his hands into his pockets. Now that they had stopped running around, he was starting to feel the chill.
Perhaps Gabriel was less secretive with his brother. They seemed to have an actual relationship with one another beyond the whole prag thing. Sam might know more about it or be in a better position to get more information about it.
Cas had altered their account to premium and set it up so that they received their money at the end of each week. The money rolled in with each new video and one drunken night just outside of Sioux Falls they did a live show, getting nearly a thousand dollars from it alone. He wasn’t entirely sure if he came from Cas’ mouth or seeing three zeros on the screen after the one. It was a close call to make.
His eyes are green, not one shade like Castiel’s blue but a spectrum of forest colours all rolled into one iris with the tiniest sliver of amber close to his pupil. Castiel could write a short story on what he thinks about when he looks at them. He thinks of the first day of spring, lush fields, new life, flowers blooming. Dean coughs before he gets any further with his imagination and takes his eyes away.
Dean didn’t par-take in their conversations during lunch, too busy in his own mind trying to figure out how his conversation was going to go with Cas. This was possibly his last meal as a free man, soon to be property of one Castiel Novak.
Cas’ glare seemed to have silenced them both from what they were talking about. He wondered if the other two were picking up any Russian. Questions for later.
“You have got to be kidding me,” she sighed. She turned her attention back to Dean, kissing him and Cas found it hard not to growl. Bella pulled away, “Rain check babe?”
The feel of Cas’ erect cock pressed against him was a nice reminder that Cas loved doing this to Dean as much as Dean loved being the subject of it. The cherry on top of this play would be the taste of Cas in his mouth.
Dean stepped into his cell. He was hesitant, it had been his cell for almost a year and he suddenly felt like this wasn’t his space anymore. Not with what just happened. That little display had been for a reason. The guy outside the cell, waiting for Dean to come back a power display of what kind of person Dean was about to be sharing his cell with. Not that Dean needed any more convincing how terrifying this Russian could be. Even relaxing on his bunk, reading a novel he had a presence.
Dean debated what to send. He had no idea, pulling up blanks. Did he want to go out with Benny? His profile pictures showed him as a handsome guy. How true could that be though? People lied on the internet all the time. Even the photos Dean picked were of him on
He joined Dean, frantic hands reaching to his friend’s jeans trying to pop the buttons. The alcohol didn’t help making this a smooth process. Eventually he got the last pop and reached in under Dean’s boxers, not wanting to drag this out, needing his hand around Dean’s erection. He hummed feeling its warmth. Too long he thought, too long since he got to touch Dean like this. His friend bucked into his hand, moans escaping him as Cas brought him to fully erect with ease. “Fuck Cas,
“Meeting a friend.” Dean replied casually. He wasn’t lying. Cas was a friend. Friends had lunch together. It was a thing. People did that all the time. Didn’t make the nerves in Dean’s stomach settle any better. He had a been a butterfly farm ever since dropping Charlie off at pre-school.
Dad talents,” Dean helped him the poor guy out. “I build this one a tree house in the summer.” He wriggled Charlie in his arm.
“Fuck you Cas.” He snaps, full of venom. He shoves Cas making him stumble off of the stool, that look on Cas’ face from earlier is back, wide eyed and confused like he doesn’t understand, like he doesn’t fucking
He shows Cas in the middle of the wood that he isn’t going anywhere. Sucks marks all over his body, holds him down as he fucks Cas from behind, growling
Cas took a grip of the top of Dean’s hair, taking a fist of it to keep him in place. He was used to submissive, pliant Dean, well this wasn’t what they were used to. Dean pushed Cas back. He stumbled. Dean pushed again, and again till Cas hit the back of the couch and Dean pounced on him, attaching himself to Cas’ neck, biting hard.
He spotted Sam and Charlie leaning against one of the fences chatting. They kept to themselves, not wanting to draw too much attention. Charlie saw Dean first, hit Sam’s chest with the back of his hand and Sam turned. His lurch of a brother smiled at him as he crossed the yard.
“Claire was also very excited today,” Cas told him. “She had me set up the paints before breakfast.” He gestured towards the coffee table where Charlie and Claire were kneeling by. The present that they had given Claire was all ready to go. Newspapers
“You’re gonna need a title if you wanna see inside the Queen’s house. She can’t have just any ole peasant in there.” Dean explained with exaggeration, like this was obvious.
After a mouthwatering plate of seafood, some laughs and a couple of beers Benny brought Dean into his room and fucked him.
Dean dropped his bag, crossed the space and embraced his Mom, lifting her up and swinging her around. He hadn’t seen her since Christmas, sure they spoke on the phone, but the lack of money and intense college year really limited his resources on being able to make the trip to see them. She smelled like home and Dean sank into it, suddenly realising how much he had missed this space.
When Cas got to his room, he had to stop to admire the beauty that was Dean, strung out on his bed, cock hard and heavy lying on his stomach. Dean even had his hands above his head like before and Cas hadn’t even asked him to do it. His inner need to show Cas how good he’d good be again knowing no bounds. It ached him to his soul.
Dean brought himself to the moment fully, forgetting fantasies and distractions. He let his arousal wash over him, feeling the tingles he had been forcing down to come up and scatter over his body. He sank further into the bed, feeling the sheets encase him. They smelled like Cas, that tea tree body wash he liked using. When Cas took his other hand to fondle Dean’s balls Dean’s stomach clenched again and his hands grabbed fists of the duvet beside him.
He shot Cas a text given that his roommate is out friends requesting the login details. Cas send back the link to the site along with the username and password.
Dean underestimated his ability to forget things. Thursday, they exchanged four sentences, four max. Cas needed to get Claire home on time to see her other Dad. His usual hatred for the ex was replaced with gratitude that he wanted to spend time with his daughter. The less around Cas the better. Every syllable out of his mouth Dean could trace back to a noise he made the previous night.
He saw Cas read it, or at least attempt to read it. Dean wasn’t too sure how well the Russian could read English now that he thought about it. The books he was used to seeing in Cas’ hands were never in English.
Dean is a bit taken aback if he is all that honest with himself. The idea of Cas standing in front of an auditorium filled with students is a surprise. Cas told him that night he wasn’t a people person and yet he did that, he does that, daily. He speaks to students and relates to them on a level that has Jess calling him her favourite professor. It reminds him of that night when he was doing his laundry and reading those short stories. The attention to detail Cas gave every one of them, Dean jotted it down to being particular but no, he did it because he cared about his students were writing which turns out, was themselves.
His words had Dean cumming untouched. His body jerked and cries tried to leave his mouth, so Cas gagged him on his fingers to silence him. Dean reveled in it, felt so full of Cas and the images in his mind of Cas’ words only made his orgasm that much sweeter. When he was spent, his body laxed into Cas’ chest. Cas’ fingers fell from his mouth and ass and arms wrapped around him to hold him tight.
“You’ll never have to find out.” Cas replied non-chalant. Dean hated how his heart seemed to swell at that comment. He could just about cope with having the hots for Cas because Cas was a damn sex God and who wouldn’t but feelings, feelings were…complicated, messy and Dean never saw himself liking a dude like that before. It messed with his mind.
“Only if you hurry the hell up.” He stammered out in frustration. Cas teasing him was not helping the situation of him lasting any longer than what would probably be two minutes till the end of the story.
Crawling up the body before him, Dean rose up on his elbows to meet Cas’ mouth, kissing him with enthusiasm. His tongue asked for permission and Cas gave it to him. When they met, he sighed contently, using his body to push Dean back down. Dean took Cas’ face in his hands clearly not finished kissing him and brought him with him till their bodies were flush together.
Dean obeyed, hands reaching back to get a hold of himself. He waited for Cas, waited with bated breath till a cold touch pressed against his rim, pressed inside making him hide his muffled moans into the pillow. A reflex he had grown accustomed to, having to keep quiet, he didn’t have to though and when Cas pushed in the second finger Dean didn’t hold back, letting the moan vibrate out of him, letting Cas know how good it felt.
“Trust me, I do.” Cas pushed on Dean’s wrist, to try and get out of it. He was breathless, chest heaving, he’d gone a few rounds meaning Dean could try and take him seeing as he was fresh. He shoved Cas back, Cas stumbled, hand reaching for something to get a hold of. He couldn’t find anything and fell, landing flat on his back on the tiles. The shiv fell from his hand. Dean kicked it away, towards Balthazar who picked it up and put it in his pocket.
When Cas answered Dean felt a bit of stage fright. He wasn’t as drunk as he had been last time, partly because he had to drive to and from the date and dropping off Charlie, so he didn’t have any whiskey. Whiskey usually helped him feel freer and more relaxed.
Dean ran a hand over his face but went, finding Cas pacing around one of the storerooms, mumbling in Russian to himself. His hands still in fists, anger still seeping through him.
Thanksgiving complete, Charlie was tucked in bed, Amelia clocked out early too for work tomorrow which left Sam and Dean the last two standing. He had a belly full of food and Sam managed to grab the good beers, none of this low-calorie crap Dean was used to drinking around Sam’s place. He twisted off the caps and handed his brother a cold one.
“Sure.” Dean replied. On the inside he was elated, booze to settle the nerves was just what he needed. If he hadn’t of driven, he’d have downed a few beers at dinner to help him out too.
“Your attractiveness as nothing to do with you being a good man,” Cas dropped his head back onto the pillow. “Being a good man is in here.” He poked Dean’s heart hard.
“What else did you paint kiddo?” Dean asked trying to untangle the knots of his insides. She showed him ones that had dragons on them (not dragons) and ones with more moons and stars and one where she was saving a princess from a tower (again its more abstract than in the literal sense). Cas grabbed more paper from his office and the Dads joined in on the painting while the brownies baked. The picture Charlie drew almost coming to life if Dean looked hard enough.
Dean had his exam in the afternoon. He showered, changed and plonked himself back down onto his desk. Cas’ chat window still open, along with the video he had sent him. He couldn’t look at it. Dean pulled at his face with his hands. “Get it together man,” he mumbled through his palms, “It’s just sex, its nothing. It doesn’t mean anything.”
“I love the sounds you make,” Cas whispered. How his voice could be gentle, and his motions brutal was a mystery to Dean at that moment. “You’re so good for me Dean.”
“It would have been a bad idea for you to see my office because when you’re around me Dean, you make it difficult to think about anything else but you,” he speaks as he steps into Dean’s apartment, barging past the body in his way. “I would not have been able to concentrate for the remainder of the day had you come into my office and done what I assumed you were suggesting.” He cuts himself off before admitting anymore. With that out of the way Castiel breathes.
Dean shook his head. He saw Cas’ dick, it was decent, thick, another finger might have helped but Dean kind of liked the slight pain of a stretch. When Cas pulled his fingers out, he let go of his ass and got himself up on all fours.
The bed moves and Dean lines himself up behind Cas. Dean runs hotter than Cas, creating a cascade of goosebumps over him. He takes Dean’s hand, bringing it around to his front, letting Dean figure out the rest by taking a hold of his cock again.
“Was it worth it though?” Castiel squints his eyes at Dean unsure of that question. “Being with your buddies, drinking, reminiscing about the good ole days.”
Dean scoffed, he hadn’t even finished that sentence though he was going to go with something along the lines of ‘incredible’ or ‘insane’, both were good descriptions of what just happened. He took a few more breathes in euphoria before coming back down to earth.
“He isn’t,” a Russian accent came from inside his cell. Dean looked over the guy’s shoulder, seeing that Russian from the yard lying on the bottom bunk. He was reading a book. The one with those cold blue eyes. The one who was in Hell not two days ago for who the fuck knows was now Dean’s new celly. That’s just what he needed to make sure he wasn't going to get sent back to the Empty, a psychopath in his sleeping quarters.
Cas sped up to the point where he sussed Dean was close to cumming. The boy’s breathe becoming labored and stuttering with each pull on his cock that Cas gave him. When he felt the moment draw to its conclusion, he put Dean’s cock back inside his boxers and palmed him to bring him over.
“I can’t when you...” Dean said voice broken and wrecked. The Russian pressed his head to Dean’s temple, his breathes hot and short like Dean’s. A small relief that at least Cas wasn’t as calm about this as Dean assumed then a hand dipped under Dean’s top, reaching down to skate over his chest, brushing over his nipple and Dean arched into that so fast, chasing that hand for that touch again. When the Russian gave it to him, fingers rolling his nipple gently Dean bit his lip so hard he tasted copper in his mouth.
“You’ll do what? Zachariah tells me you have to be a good boy or else. Now do me a favour Dean,” he stepped into Dean’s space. Dean stepped back, hitting the tiles. Alastair brought his hand up, caressed the side of Dean’s face. “And be a good boy for me or else."
That seemed to either spark something good in Dean or piss him off, either way he did, moving back out and snapping forward with speed. Cas knew this, this he could work with. He arched to meet the thrust that stung a little too much, just short of painful and just enough pleasure. His glistened chest rose up to touch Dean’s, heat on heat and the necklace Dean wore pressed into his sternum. The cold shook Cas.
“You’re bleeding.” his voice concerned, and Dean doesn’t have the strength to keep fighting. He wants to get cleaned up, he wants to go to sleep and pretend today never happened.
“You won’t,” Dean replied. “This aint my first rodeo.” He slid his own finger into his mouth, then joined Cas in opening him up. He hissed through his teeth at the pain. It burned a little but a good kind of burn, like whiskey or Cuban cigars.
Dean scoffed, memories of last night coming back to the forefront of his mind, this time he didn’t fight them away in the morning like before. He let them roll in, adding to his ever-growing arousal. Now with worries sidelined for the time being they could get back to pressing matters at hand. He leaned back down, rolling his whole body into Cas, loving how Cas arched up to meet him. “You earned that title last night, you didn’t even cum, did you?”
When they got to the dining room there was a gathering of shouting and roaring inmates. They pushed their way through to get to the front to see what was going on. Once Dean got a view, he could see it was Cas and Gabriel going at it behind where they serve the food.
“That’ll cost you two sprays.” he encroached on his daughter. Spray hidden behind his back. She sat down on the floor right there and lifted up her rainbow polka dot pyjama bottom trouser leg to reveal the graze. Charlie didn’t squirm once, so Dean loaded the marshmallows in, even made himself one and they curled up on their couch to watch the Powerpuff Girls before bedtime.
Once retrieved he lay down on the bed. Dean now topless with his back to him and Cas could make out the freckles that scattered across the tops of his shoulders and down his arms. He wet his lips at the sight. His hand twitched like it wanted to reach out but that would mean something Cas didn’t want it to mean so he diverted his hand to the lube, coating three of his fingers to open himself up.
He wanted to ask how Dean knew that Cas wasn’t one for paying attention but that would open up a conversation he wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to have. They needed to stay on track, no digressions. That didn’t mean Cas couldn’t get his own back at the slight dig. He refused to let Dean think he could get one over on him.
Dean took in every word as the pace turned ferocious. The top of Cas’ cock slightly touching the back of Dean’s mouth every few thrusts. He felt himself gag and craved more of that, wanting to take all of Cas, as much as he could without throwing up. Cas’ hands held onto Dean’s face, one holding his hair, the other holding his cheek. His eyes started to water from the sensation, jaw beginning to ache from being open for however long it had been.
Kissing Dean was heavenly, the way he liked to moisten Cas’ lips with his tongue, letting his own plump ones slip and slide over Cas’ with loud smacks that vibrated Cas’ bones. He rolled his hips down, brushing their erections together and he couldn’t help but smile when Dean shuddered from it.
“What, no ready and action?” Dean joked, trying to make light of the situation. His friend scowled at him as he maneuvered his way in-between Dean’s legs. It wasn’t new for them to be around each other in their boxers. They were dorm buddies in first year, didn’t manage to rip each other’s’ throats out so then found their own place off campus for second year where their friendship really took off and it was pretty much solidified in third year, so yeah, seeing each other almost naked wasn’t anything out of the ordinary.
He turned to look at the guard. She was from Hell and new. He sighed, pointing to the pile of clothes beside him. “Pair of boxers and a top are missing. Probably still stuck in a dryer or something, it’s happened before.”
. That’s a name he hadn’t heard in a while. One of the only serious relationships Dean had when he tried to have an apple pie life. He wasn’t built for that kind of life and it didn’t last, obviously.
“I’m horny.” Cas clarified. His eyes dragged over Dean’s body. The Russian was not going to make this easy for Dean. Cas got what he wanted, always and Dean was not giving him what he wanted.
Dean shook his head. He couldn’t. He wasn’t like Cas. He wasn’t strong, sure on the outside he was but deep down they both knew that was a bunch of bull. In these moments when he crumbled under Cas’ touch, they knew he wasn’t all that. He loved chick flicks, cuddling and when he got upset, he ate his weight in pie. Dealing with homophobes would crush him.
The decision to stop driving his daughter to and from pre-school and cut through the park was equally the best and worst decision Dean had made. It was the best decision because it meant Charlie tended to tire herself out on the playground and by the time, they got home she was practically falling asleep into her dinner. It was the worst decision because he had to pry her away from the playground on the way to pre-school in the mornings meaning they had been late on more than one occasion. This was one of those mornings.
They both glared at him, unimpressed. Dean looked to Cas briefly, their eyes met for a breath then darted away. Dean’s free hand reached behind to scratch his neck. His nervous tell. What had he to be nervous about? He didn’t do anything, unless he was nervous being around Cas. After what he pulled, Cas wouldn’t be surprised if Dean even wanted to continue living with him.
That thought made Dean groan, stomach clenching like it did multiple times in the video. He could see the moment he let go, one of his fists come into view to take hold of the bedding and he started fucking up into Cas’ fist.
Dean woke up still in last night’s clothes with a banging headache, ringing in his ears and a churning stomach. He was gonna hurl. Stumbling out of his bed he made his way to the bathroom, getting there just in time to empty the contents of last night into it. It stung. Gabriel’s weird ass drink stripping his insides. The sweet sugary neon orange still the same colour as it was last night. Gross.
He spread his legs on instinct, brought his arm around the back of the sofa to make space for Cas to get closer to him. Dean checked his watch quickly to see how much they could indulge in this moment before reality came back to them. It wasn’t enough time for a fuck.
He stirs awake again, this time in the morning, sun coming in lighting up his apartment. His hangover is brewing under the surface. Dean’s breath is slow and steady on his hair, still asleep or dosing Castiel can’t be certain. He tries not to move, enjoying the closeness.
Castiel loaned him the money for the deposit on the building and six months’ rent because he has more money than he knows what to do with. Gabriel managed to hand it back and then some despite Castiel assuring him he wasn’t expecting it back. He was glad to help his friend out.
hard.” Her voice crumbles. “It feels like no matter how much I study it just won’t go in.” more tears fall.
Cas welcomed it, slipping his leg between Bart’s to press them closer together, bringing his own hand around Bart’s shoulders to keep him close. Cas wasn’t much of a dancer but this, this he could do. The slow grind to the sway of the music, crotches rubbing, creating enough friction to entice. Bart dropped his head to Cas’ shoulder, mouth hot against his neck as his hands moved to take a hold of Cas’ ass. He closed his eyes, reveling in the touch. It wouldn’t be the first time Bart and he had done this, if they were heading in the direction Cas sorely hoped they were. A few more moments and he’d take Bart upstairs, show him all the things he wanted to do to Dean.
He claimed Dean’s mouth with fever, eliciting a sweet moan from Dean that allowed Cas to slide his tongue inside without any protest. Not that Dean would ever protest. He’s submissiveness giving over to Cas’ every whim. He cherished it, never taking it for granted, always with Dean’s needs at heart.
Charlie waved the present in her arms. Dean could see her through his rear-view mirror. He hopped out of the car and plucked Charlie from her seat, present still in hands, wrapped horribly but Charlie insisted on doing it herself. It was covered, that was a good enough base line to go off of. She wrote in the card too, again a four-year-old could only write so much, mainly Charlie worked in symbols and hieroglyphics.
“I know, just…” Dean looked at Cas. The man’s hair was more of a mess than usual, Dean did that to him. Dean wanted to do more than that to him. “What now?”
Dean caught his breath for a second then pulled out, collapsing onto the bed beside Cas. They both stared up at the ceiling, reeling in what happened. One fuck and he’d leave. That was what he promised but his body already felt lost without Dean being near it, on top of it, inside of it. He ran his hands over his face, got up to sit at the edge of the bed.
He dropped to his knees, hands grabbing at Cas’ jeans trying to undo them as quick as he could manage. Cas wasn’t fully hard, though once Dean wrapped his mouth around him that changed. He sucked Cas down, taking him to his hilt now used to the feel of his cock in his mouth. He breathed deeply through his nose, on the pullback he wrapped his tongue along Cas’ shaft, and he felt Cas’ knees buckle a little.
He smiles into his pillow at his adorable…neighbor. Whatever Cas is, he’s adorable and Dean can picture Cas lying on his bed debating over how to phrase and word his message to make sure Dean understands. Its adorable as fuck. Also, who calls them sleepovers after the age of 7?
It didn’t take long before there was a hand around his waist. He turned, seeing Bart grinning wickedly at him. He wasted no time. His body pushing up against Cas’, hands making their way under his shirt.
“Can I text someone? It’s not Dean don’t worry.” She says. Castiel nods. Jessica takes out her phone to communicate with someone. Castiel waits patiently. It doesn’t take long for a response to come in.
“You’re welcome.” Cas smirked, slightly chuffed with himself for parenting Dean. He put on the black one, tied it around his back and then around the front in a double knot. Dean mimicked it then went back to his phone to retrieve the recipe. He discarded the notifications from Bumble.
Dean being bi was not public knowledge in Purgatory. He wanted to keep it that way, promised Sam not to tell a living soul once they landed themselves in here. Charlie figured it out early on being gay himself, he also kept the secret safe as Dean kept his. Charlie would be prime prag material for a daddy, especially if they found out he liked it in the ass. Appearing straight kept them away, unless you were Dean apparently.
Dean cursed, a multitude of fucks and shits and oh god’s rolling off of him. His knuckles white, fists full of bed sheets while he held on for his life. Cas leaned back, seeking to take in more of what was happening, back to resting on his knees he pushed Dean’s thighs apart, watching as his cock slid in and out of Dean.
The bottom bunk moved. The guy back lying on his bed reading his book probably. He didn’t need his new celly seeing those looks either, getting ideas that it was something Dean did or something that he could take from Dean. They were similar build but if he was like any of the other Russians in here, he could take on someone twice his size and still win. Dean couldn’t take that chance. He hopped off the bed needing to set some house rules.
“Probably.” Cas smiled. Dean loved when he made Cas smile, felt like winning the jackpot every time the sides of lips lifted because of something Dean had said or did. He really had to go but he had one more thing he wanted to do before he got to his car and had to put his Dad brain back online.
“Boss.” One of the AB holding Dean’s arm said. He wasn’t looking at Alastair or Dean. His eyes set on something behind their boss. Alastair turned his head. The Nazi’s body was in the way of Dean for him to be able to see what was happening, what they were looking at.
Benny came back out, looking for the next cannister. Cas hopped down and Dean got himself up to grab the next one. He was more careful with them now that he knew there was a chance any of them had the chemical in it that was important to Cas.
“You two get caught doing the nasty in the library on Wednesday?” he winks at them both. They neither confirm nor deny that comment, instead change the subject back to Dean, which means they totally did.
He looked over his shoulder, Cas was staring at the ground not wanting to look at Dean either. Their confessionals hanging in the air and unsure where to go with it. It terrified him but at least he wasn’t alone in his fear. This was big for them, there was no point denying that. What they did now with this information was anyone’s guess. They couldn’t just jump headfirst and ride away into the sunset. It was complicated. It wasn’t going to be solved today though. They needed time to think about it, think about what it meant.
“Let me guess, you’ll kill me?” Cas interrupted him, eyes fixated on Dean, not one bit intimidated by the bad boy attitude that seemed to have resurfaced. Cas knew now what Dean looked like, what he sounded like, what he tasted like. He licked his lips, catching the lasting pieces of Dean’s cum, making sure Dean saw it before he left, slamming Cas’ door behind him that it shook a picture frame.
He never had Cas down as being a particularly funny character, perhaps talking to Dean in English removed that part of his personality. Cas had great English, fluent as far as Dean could tell, some metaphors and idioms were lost on him and sarcasm, he wasn’t that great with either.
Thankfully the alcohol was keeping his jitters at bay, sober Dean would be freaking out a bit by now, slightly buzzed Dean on the other hand, totally on board with all things liberating and stimulating. Once on the account he found their video easily.
Zachariah stepped in.  “You must have a guardian angel Winchester because I honestly have no idea how you’ve managed to wrangle your way out of this place,
Dean went back to Cas’ cock, closing his eyes to get back to what he was doing beforehand, giving Cas his perfect blowjob. The strands of Dean’s soft unstyled hair moved between his fingers and he gripped it tight. It earned him a moan from Dean that rippled through Cas’ very being. Dean appeared to be trying to take as much of Cas’ in his mouth as he could manage, only getting so far.
“What did you do?” he asked through panted breathes. He came to a halt in his garden, hands on his knees to get his breath back. The sound of his heartbeat in his ears felt good. The way his legs felt like they could give way any moment felt even better.
Cas dropped his forehead to Dean’s, trying to reel in his need to just take him already, make him feel good, the best he’s ever felt before. “If you want to stop at any time just – “
Cas moved quick, like a fucking cat or something. He slipped out of Dean’s grip with ease, was off the bed, in Dean’s lap, hand grabbing Dean’s hair pulling it back and pressing something sharp into Dean’s neck before Dean had a chance to even register what was happening.
Then Cas mouth was on his, furious and dominating. It was different, it wasn’t love, it wasn’t affection. He was pissed and he was showing Dean just how much. Well two could play at that game. Cas wasn’t the only one with a fight to pick. Dean fought back, all teeth and tugging, snarling into Cas’ mouth as they battled it out at the foot of the stairs in his childhood home.
This is the usual antics that tend to happen while at the auto-shop. Dean fucks up, Benny saves him, Bobby gives out to both of them shutting them up for about an hour then Dean fucks up again and so on it goes. The fuck ups aren’t actual fuck ups, like Dean wrecking a car more than when it came in, its usually more Dean is irritating Bobby either by accident or on purpose. This hour’s fuck up being Dean’s in a good mood.
Dean had been released from his cuffs and back into the wild of Purgatory he went. Its 8am, yard time. It gave the prisoners time to stretch their legs, get out in the open, or at least more open than the concrete walls they were confined before their work detail. Not that Dean needed it, his work detail was outside, but he enjoyed yard time.
“You stole my phone,” Castiel shrugs. He needs to not look at Dean’s mouth for a moment, he’s too fixated on it for his own good, a moment of weakness on their date when he swiped ice cream off of it not really thinking, just acting. Dean’s face went as red as the stop sign, they were standing under.
The more Dean responded. The heavier Cas’ mouth got. Those subtle kisses and teeth grazes being replaced by bites and long licks and Dean was crumbling after each one, hands gripped so tight onto the metal rod holding him up as Cas did his worst to Dean. Control becoming a distant memory as Cas licked under Dean’s armpit, something Dean never experienced before and now needed it more in his life than he thought possible.
Dean comes first, spilling into Cas and then he’s pushing Cas back. He goes, falling back into his comforter. He’s unsure what’s happening till Dean bends over and takes him in his mouth. It doesn’t take long for Cas to come after that, those lips, he knew those lips were made for this and they are. Plush and warm and eager. Some of his come falls from Dean’s mouth onto his stomach and that’s ok because Dean isn’t used to it.
Cas mimicked the action, reaching for his own and watching Dean under hooded eyes as he took his time walking over.
Cas’ in casual clothes, a fitted blue top like his eyes and equally fitted black chinos. He doesn’t know which he preferred, the suit, the pajamas, the casual attire, all of them fill Dean’s mind with ways of taking them off. He’s glad Cas is looking at the pie, gives him a chance to fully appreciate the way the top tightens around his upper arms.
The waiter came back with their burgers. They smelled incredible. His mouth was already salivating over the cheese oozing out of the sides of it. When he took his first bite, he rolled his eyes into the back of his head and hummed with appreciation. He caught Cas smirking at him.
“Let’s go Winchester.” The guard tugged on the cuffs, on hand on Dean’s shoulders to guide him out. He went willingly. The urge to make some snarky comment about how he was more than capable to walk himself back to Purgatory was there on the tip of his tongue. He held it. The warden was out in the hall, arms crossed over his chest giving Dean a stern look.
When Cas was done, he touched Dean, telling him to move. He did, barely, just enough to get higher up the bed so he wasn’t hanging off the end of it. Dean rubbed his head into the pillow, content and sated, sleep slowly creeping up on him. The thought of having to go back to his room and leave Cas ached him.
.” Cas called out to him. Dean got up off the chair, shook himself back to some sort of respectable stance, fixed his hair, fixed his dick more importantly and joined Cas outside.
“I didn’t kill him for them.” Cas handed Dean back the piece of paper. He lay down behind Dean, one hand behind his head, the other on his bare chest. “I killed him for you.”
When he saw Cas’, hand lift off his balls and onto his hip Dean felt his orgasm rise up. He jacked off, the sound of his skin slapping and Cas’ name on his lips as he came shattering him, leaving him breathless and sticky, much like the Dean in the video, panting, cock twitching and come splattered on his stomach from Cas’ hand job.
“Sure Cas, vegetable oil my ass,” he replied without much thought to his words. Cas suddenly coughed on his smoke and turned to look at him in surprise. Dean suddenly clocked why. “That is not what I meant by that!” He blurted out. Idioms lost on the Russian. The pink now turning red. He did not just tell Cas to vegetable oil his ass.
He put on the TV, let himself settle in, enjoying the tingles of phantom fingers that were on his body not an hour ago. Dean hadn’t forgotten the minor detail that what pushed him over the edge was picturing Cas on his cock, but he didn’t need to share that with his friend. Somethings were allowed to be just for him to know and others to never find out. He repaid Benny for his generosity, that settled Dean’s guilt about it.
They ate in silence while watching the girls run around the garden and tree house pretending to fight off an invasion of aliens who were trying to destroy the castle. It was one the better Saturday’s he had in a while. It was nice spending time with Cas, nice not having to feel the need to fill it with conversation. The girls were entertainment enough for them.
“Happy Thanksgiving man.” Dean replied and took a seat on the sofa next to Riot, resting his feet on the coffee table in front of him.
“Dean, a lot has happened in Purgatory since you got thrown in the Empty.” His brother walked to an empty bench, sat down and gestured for Dean to sit too.
And with that Cas moved out of each other’s grips, to the top drawer of his bedside table to take out a bottle of lube and tear off a condom from the strip he had. This was it. Dean flipped himself, grabbing two pillows, one to put under his hips, the other for something to hold onto. The bed dipped again. Cas was kneeling behind him. The silence had returned, apart from Dean’s heart in his ears he could hear the bottle cap popping open, the sound of the lube being squirted onto Cas’ fingers.
Dean burst out a laugh at that. Suddenly he didn’t feel so cold. His phone buzzed again, an email reminder about the Fete quickly followed by an email reminding parents of Charlie’s class about the bake-sale. It had completely slipped his mind. He had to bake something. Dean remembered the cookies at Claire’s birthday party and the delicious chocolate cake he got a slice of when Cas had cut it. He had made that. Dean opened up his messages with Cas again.
“I heard your old man got put down today,” it was Gordon. His voice was low as he leaned into Dean’s space. Dean ignored him, kept walking into the crowd that was exiting the yard. Gordon stayed glued to his side though, clearly not done antagonizing Dean.
I'm thinking two more chapters? And maybe some smutty time stamps but we're near the end on this one x
“We didn’t touch your burrito Dean calm down,” Sam interjects. “Though that was pretty funny when I did that.”
With that hanging threat Gabriel joined the brothers, jamming his lollipop back into his mouth and leaving the others with a decision to make.
Gordon’s death was the talk of Purgatory for a few of days along with the unexpected suicide of the other gang member who was found hanging in his cell. There was a half ass inquiry into what happened. If anything, Cas had done the world a favour smiting that man from existence.
With a huff Dean turned around, letting his leg drape over Cas' and hand wrap around his stomach. Cas let out a sigh, like he had been holding his breath for a while. Dean didn't ask, he never did. If Cas wanted to talk he would, most of the time he didn't. The Bratva came first, always and Dean had to accept that. What he got was these moments, few and far between when Cas would come to him for one night, sometimes two if he was lucky. This was the deal he got when he decided to fall in love with someone from the Russian mafia.
He assessed the situation. The shed was too far for his liking and he was tired, exhausted even. He could just do a shitty job on the last fifty meters though chances were the compound supervisor would just make them do it tomorrow. Dean was just about done with this damn road.
Dean wants to know more about these mental notes Cas is keeping on him, on them, whatever he’s keeping Dean wants in on. His brain automatically drifts to mental notes of the sexual kind. Dean learnt some of his own last night. How Cas likes his dick being touched, stroked, teased and any other adjective Dean can come up with that involves jacking off someone. He likes making people feel good, part of his DNA is doing it but making Cas feel good, making Cas cum is a whole other ball game. Pun intended. The rush he felt bringing Cas over that edge found himself toppling over into euphoria too.
He started to protest as Cas pulled his finger out, hips rising to chase it, not wanting to feel empty. Cas’ quiet groan spurred him on, rising up on all fours, presenting himself to Cas for more. It didn’t take long before Cas’ finger was back inside, and Dean preened at it.
Cas doesn’t respond. He doesn’t know what he was even looking for in a response, it’s not like Cas can deny it. He saw it, with his own eyes. When he can’t take the silence any longer, he walks away defeated to sit on the edge of his bed, head hanging low between his shoulders. He’s too tired to tell Cas to piss off, get out of his apartment and his life, go back to avoiding each other, go back to when he didn’t need to know what made Cas tick. When he didn’t think this small spark could turn into an almighty fire between them if they took the time to let it grow.
“They’re getting impatient.” Dean said, showing Cas his phone screen. The rolling comments popping up one after the other after the other. Somehow, they had the most intense following,
Dean pulled back to get a look at Cas’ face. It was less sad. “I’m sure we’ll come to blows one way or another. I’m stubborn and you aint no angel.”
Gordon laughed, the other member holding Dean’s arms down joined in too. He saw Gordon drop the shiv, leaving it beside Dean’s waist. His hands moved over Dean’s chest. He hated the feel of it. Those hands didn’t belong on his body.
Dean stepped up, waiting for his tray to be loaded with food. He noticed his brother ahead of him was getting way more than anyone else was.
“Yes, the bath will take too long.” Cas agreed. He had taken out some mince, onion, tinned tomatoes. “I’ll make bolognaise.”
A group had surrounded them, eager to watch the bloodshed. This was the plan, Cas’ big plan to fix Dean’s problem. He was setting up a fight for Dean to remind those in Purgatory who he was and with the baddest of the bad in here, the Russians.
“Alright then, I’ll bite. Where were you?” he asked then he remembered Russian’s never handed out things for free, he had the fine print to deal with before he landed himself in hot water again. “Wait, you’re giving me this information because you want to, right?” Cas looked at him attentively as Dean continued to explain himself. “Balthazar aint gonna come knocking for me to do something for you again cause if that’s the case, you can keep your damn secrets Cas.” That came out stronger than he intended.
“Sorry I should have asked first,” Cas looked down at the ground. “I thought it would be…something the viewers would enjoy.”
Cas noticed what he was doing, eyes blown watching as he took in Dean digging in deep to the bruises. He moved Dean’s hand away and all Dean wanted to do was complain. He glared at Cas for not letting him do what he wanted but Cas shook his head like he wasn’t allowed to do that. There were no rules about touching yourself. There were no rules at all really, except first one to make a noise loses and winner gets whatever he wanted.
“You can come over again after class. I have to go for a run, so any time after 4 works.” Cas said, about to walk away before Dean stopped him.
Dean sped up to Cas’ movements, wanting to finish in this moment as he did in that moment. He pulled at his bottom lip, eyes glued to screen waiting for the moment that pushed him over the edge, when Cas pushed Dean down into the bed.
They filled their summer on the road in Dean’s car. Most people got summer jobs, earning money to tie them over and sustain them for the next academic year. Cas and Dean had a different plan, re-opening their str8laced_unlaced account and reaping it for all its worth. After buying a new couch, second hand from a charity shop they saved every dollar that wasn’t spent on paying for cheap motel rooms and gas. They sub-let their apartment so that was taken care of which meant the only thing they had to worry about was about the content of their next video.
Cas managed to get to History class in the nick of time. He refused to spend any longer in classrooms than he had to. His desk in the back corner unoccupied as always.
Dean looked down at himself. He had showered, styled his hair a bit more than usual and was wearing a charcoal shirt with his least raggedy pair of jeans.
He patted his fingers down further, eyes never leaving Dean’s as he took a delicate hold of his cock, warm and flushed in his palm. Dean’s mouth fell open. His breath hitching in the back of his throat. This close to him Cas could hear everything, savouring each note. He pumped him a little, his fist engulfed the head of his cock and re-emerge tugging the skin down over the head. The more he went, the louder Dean got.
Cas nodded, spreading his legs wider to show Dean how right he was. Dean pushed Cas’ legs out with his thighs, then he felt the blunt head of Dean’s cock touch his readied hole. They both shuddered at the contact.
The Russian answered with moving himself off of the bed and into Dean’s lap in one quick swift movement like he had before. One hand braced on Dean’s shoulder, the other moving down his chest at an equally swift pace. This time Dean didn’t have to hold back as much, this time he could let some of his enjoyment show and not worry about losing control under Cas’ touch. He rested his hands on Cas’ waist as Cas went to work on him, resting soon turned into gripping as the Russian got his hand on Dean’s cock under his trousers.
He closed the chat window with Cas and opened up his emails. One from 7am, reminding parents that the pre-school was still open despite the weather. Education continues no matter the weather apparently.
“Oh yeah,” she remembered. “Can I come another time?” Claire asked. Surprisingly no tantrum, perhaps the kid really did like her other Dad. It wasn’t like she knew he possibly tore Cas’ heart into a million tiny pieces.
Dean had spent the first six months here establishing some sort of a reputation for not taking shit like that from anyone, the lewd looks, the comments, the casual groping, before, if any of them even tried it they’d get what was coming to them. Now all he could do was keep his head down, bury that rage inside of him and try not to lash out. There were cameras in the common areas if he did anything Shurley would know, he couldn’t hide.
He watches them for a moment, the way Dean is smiling at them so full of love and affection, how he laughs so hard he throws his head back almost hitting somebody behind him, how they stand so close to each other shoulders constantly touching even though there is enough space to avoid. It’s like Dean is a universal magnet for those around him, Cas included.
“Can’t hurt.” Sam agreed. They heard tiny footsteps making their way down the stairs steadily. “Is that who I think it is?” Sam leaned back out of the door frame to see Charlie coming down ready to go.
“Dean’s got a kinky girl in his bed,” Jo grinned ear to ear. “Check out his neck,” she reached up to yank at his collar, giving Meg a little look at the collection of bruises Cas had pressed into Dean’s neck the night before. Dean pushed Jo away.
Charlie looked up from the cross word he was working on, eyes bright and brows bouncing with interest. “Details
