“Survive?” Balthasar snorted. “Wouldn’t be the first time I faked my own death. I deal in powerful artifacts. You’re not the only angel with tricks up his sleeve, my friend.”
demanded the inner voice.
Cas, I want it, want you to," Dean chanted between his teeth, arm aching, back bowed, cock straining toward his stomach staining it with precome, in the play of light and shadow on the bed, "
“A priest?” he asked. “And an angel?” he continued in a lower voice. “Won’t that, uh. Ruin the atmosphere?”
"And - "

without you, Castel, angel of the Lord. So put that in your pipe and smoke it, because I ain’t goin’ anywhwere, and I wanna
“I’ll show you mine since you showed me yours?”
Dean sat up, looking around.
" Dean shouted, as Castiel finally took Dean's cock in his hand and jacked him once, twice -
“Not only you,” said Castiel. “You were my second indiscretion.”
Castiel accompanied Dean on his now-daily constitutional in the silver birch forest. Despite Samuel's finding them there, he seemed to find it secluded and peaceful enough to share his thoughts with his valet, which many people said was the same as keeping a secret to yourself.
“Balthasar. Yeah.”
Michael laughed.
That was all right. Dean seemed to know.
At first, it was just a game, like many of his other conquests.
“But if you stay,” he said. “If you stay with me, Cas, I’m gonna make it up to you, I swear. I'm gonna make you the happiest fuckin’ man in the world. Angel. Angel man. Man-gel. What the fuck ever. I mean it.”
Dean closed his eyes against a little shudder of want.
the slick-slide glide of fingertips through feathers
" Castiel sighed, against his lips, and fell, and fell again, and the sun came out from behind the clouds into a clear blue London sky.
That is a quote from an important seahorse scientist, word-for-word.
Castiel smiled fondly.
“Please,” Dean managed. “Stay.”
“Castiel,” Dean said, his voice a fine tremor running through it, “Angel of the Lord. Will you marry me?”
Blank gray wall.
'the profound' is another word for the deepest parts of the ocean
Castiel fixed him with a look like the deep blue sea. Infathomable, inscrutable.
"It's okay, I'm okay," Dean said. "God, you feel so fuckin' good. Been dreamin' of this a while, Cas,
Case in point: the British phrase 'who's she, the cat's mother' is extraordinarily bizarre to Americans, as they would not understand why you would not refer to someone as 'she'. It is one example out of many in which our cultures are extremely different from each other, although they do seem similar at surface level due to a shared language. I personally think that the shared language masks the fact that these are two wildly different cultures and is a little detrimental because it means that those from the UK and the US are expecting something familiar if they move to the other nation and then find themselves at a disadvantage because it turns out that the place is, in fact, a foreign country, with all the things that entails.
I’ve been a whisky drinker as long as I’ve been drinking. It is my drink of choice – some would say my poison.
“In this, our combined knowledge is essential,” said Castiel. “I have commanded armies for centuries and I know the value of supply chain disruption.”
"Ready?" he asked.
“I – you know what, I don’t know,” he said. “No, I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Dean’s younger brother, Sam.”
Nothing sounded as noble and high-class as Dean felt Castiel deserved, and so all he had to offer was silence.
"Fuck you, Gabriel," said Dean.
“Sam. I am not driving across
"What the - " Dean started, and then turned to Death, who was still standing next to him, munching on something deep-fried with an air of evident contentment. "
“Not now, Cas.”
“Cas – ”
But to him, it was his undying devotion to Dean that he most feared having exposed.
“I don’t know, he’s starting to grow on me.
Then Cas was sliding up behind him, still bloody and bruised, and putting his hands firmly and gently around him.
Quite far indeed.
like lightning, it could strike anywhere, like there was a
He laughed when he saw one of them, and set the needle into the groove.
He drove back to the motel, the vial in his pocket a heavy promise, and took the steps two at a time.
"And you can be the scholar, as long as the man of action
Sam sighed.
Here Dean became painfully aware of Sam’s presence, and got closer to Castiel, speaking in a harsh whisper.
“Yeah, while the damned blade swings closer by the minute! Pit and the pendulum. I read.”
“See?” Dean murmured. “You are loved.”
"Did you find anything?"
He stood to leave.
"So you didn't wish to propose to her?"
Light crept across the floor of Castiel’s chamber.
A pity, that Castiel was a warrior, and not a painter.
Dean blushed.
Dean was starting to think
He fell asleep almost immediately, his arms wrapped around Dean's waist.
“What? Like,
"I'm sorry for Dean's behaviour. Ever since his return, he's been," Samuel searched for a word. "Agitated."
"I don't understand that reference."
“Shh, beloved,” Castiel reassured him. “Soon.”
And also, everywhere, men who were strong, and warlike, smiling at each other, some of whom held hands, even above the table.
Sunflowers are weird.
It was automatic, now; Dean acquiesced, Dean offered himself, Dean spread his legs to allow Castiel entry.
Dean, coming up behind him, also noticed this and swore.
" he breathed, because he was fully hard again, and he was only human.
He was eating a chocolate muffin Castiel had brought him, tearing it so he had a piece in each hand.
“Well, I don’t think I can stay here any longer,” he said. “I only hope the townspeople aren’t too upset with me.”
“I was outnumbered,” he explained, clearly a little embarrassed.
Dean sighed, scrunched up the paper, and dropped it into the metal trash can.
Lightning struck the water outside.
“China? What – ”
"Then was the sun jealous?" Pasion called out, beside Dean.
Bright and beautiful, Dean’s head was thrown back onto his pillow, where he writhed in the shameless pursuit of pleasure. He thrust up into the tunnel of his hand and planted his feet on the bed to give himself more leverage.
" Dean swore.
"Even then," Castiel said. "A wise man taught me that any moments I have been fortunate to have with you, any life that you've been willing to share with me, should be treasured. I have lived a long time, Dean, and am likely to live even longer - even after you are long gone from this world. So what's a moment, or a lifetime, in comparison to all that? I was willing to accept whatever you had to offer me, even if that meant a working relationship alone."
Castiel could only nod, frantic.
As he cleaned, he wondered what had happened to Dean while he had been in the colonies, and what Castiel could do to soothe the sorrow that seemed to have haunted Dean since his return.
are, of course, but I think this is probably enough.”

was the one I wanted?!”
Cas’s feet shot out and wrapped around her ankles, pulling her to the ground in one motion. He stood from the chair, ropes dropping to the ground from where he had clearly untied them while she had been distracted by their arrival and conversation.
“Gotta admit, you got me there,” he said roughly. “But look, Sam. No fuckin’ way. I came here to get Cas, to get through to him. You’d have done the same.”
Castiel laughed again, and then pulled Dean close.
“You remember that old song they used to sing, the one about, there’s a lake full of stew, and one of whisky too – ”
“Well, one of ‘em cheated. And subsequently got killed.”
“That’s it,” cooed Castiel, “my perfect sacrifice. You wanted this, to be utterly possessed by me, and now –
Sure, he recognized all those feelings now:
“And the trinity, yes.”
Standing there was -
“Fuck you, Cas,” Dean mouthed off, and then happened to look at the angel.
"Well, we don't know this guy, we're in the big city, there's a case here we can't make heads or tails of, and frankly he's paying you
Or maybe that was just his mind playing tricks.
Dean’s reactions, Dean’s desires.
"That's not my name," he said. "And I've never seen those men before in my life."
“Yeah,” Sam agreed. “That’s a
“Including my brother,” he put in. “Corsairs aren’t exactly pirates. Privateers. And I used my position to take care of the people here – before. Before you ever showed up. Did you feed these people? Clothe them? Take care of them?”
He stared at the warm wooden paneling of the wall across from the bed, and wondered about many things.
“Honestly?” Castiel said. “I don’t think so. I think we were the thing that no one expected to happen.”
Dean knelt down close to it and looked carefully.
"Sam,
“They’re the yin and yang of the road,” said Mac.
The tears had already dried.
"Long as you get a little tail on the side, is that it?"
Then he winked.
Once he felt composed again, he spoke.
The story Michael is referencing is one of my favorites, although it is very sad. It's called
“Hello, Dean,” he said.
to something that had Dean's heart aching every time he looked at Castiel.
The door opened, and there was a woman wrapped in purple and dark turquoise silk standing there.
“Come, sit,” said Castiel warmly. “Tell us more stories.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Or being absolutely tongue-tied when he showed up.”
,” said Posy, flopping back onto the ground from where she was seated, waving her arms in the air.
He took another sip of beer.
Castiel blinked at him.
"Oh."
"Got an explanation for that, Castiel?"
Until now.
He wished his own story had been much of the same.
“And I’m not cheap!”
"Don't you dare hang up on me again, you son of a bitch," growled the voice on the other end of the line.
Dean blinked again.
“Buddy. We’ve gotta talk,” said Dean, at the exact same time as Castiel said:
“Okay. Fill us in then, Einstein.”
Sam just nodded, staring in awe at the building in front of them.
Now, he watched the sunrise, as he always had, Dean's eyes fluttering open, his body bed-warm.
because there was an aphrodisiac in that, too.
He rubbed his forehead.
"No, you didn't do anything wrong," said Castiel softly. "Nothing at all. If I'd wanted to stop, I would have, and I didn't."
"What about Cas?"
“Well, what would you do, Dean?” Sam demanded. “It’s either this, or you take out half the planet.”
“I will await the end of your story this evening,” said Castiel abruptly. “I will kill you in the morning.”
“You know that, uh. That thing you brought up. About BDSM. Maybe I’d like to try it.”
“Like that, do you, angel?” Dean asked darkly. “Like me dirtying you up?”
Sam looked uncomfortable.
“It’s not therapy, no,” he said. “You know about BDSM?”
" yelped Castiel, slamming his hand against the bookshelf and making it rattle.
Castiel stood.

“a full-time bodyguard”
“I was raised in a – let’s just say, extremely religious household,” he said. “So I may not understand entirely, but run parallel.”
Castiel snorted and then nuzzled into Dean's neck, breathing deeply of him now that he could.
Other ways to please him.
He knew he was being short with his brother, and that if Dean was in Sam's position, he'd be exactly as suspicious - hell, even moreso.
“You’ll never be alone again,” said Dean. “I promise. I know I’ve been a dick in the past, but – Cas, I didn’t know.”
“Coward,” muttered Castiel.
Castiel rolled over, a soft smile on his face, presumably to respond.
And for some inexplicable reason, Dean
Castiel, ashamed, reeled everything in, until he looked like a man once again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel abruptly cut off his whispered prayer and turned his head toward Dean faster than he’d ever seen him do it.
All these things had been revealed, and they two reveled in the fact they had found each other again, across centuries, beyond the plane of death and back to life again.
That night, in his own rooms, with a fist in his feathers and the other around his cock, Castiel came on a silent scream.
“Dean,” Castiel greeted him warmly. “I’m so sorry if I said something to upset you. It was unintentional. I don’t – I’m not very good with social cues or, or.”
The man grinned, insouciant, rebellious.
this exquisite torture, this heaven, I
, how well do I know you, really?”
Still, there were nights like these, when he was back in the old days again, partly for the moneymaking possibilities, partly to keep his hand in.
Castiel groaned loudly now, beyond himself in his terrible
So Dean let fear lead, and knew in his bones that there would come a day when it was all Too Late.
“C’mon, baby,” he muttered. “Let’s find Cas.”
Dean was powerless to stop it.
Maybe Sam was right after all, and this
Dean realized that his brain was currently the consistency of crème brulee.
“Apparently.”
straight-up shrieked like he was being murdered, in the sheer unabashed delight of it, this near-pinnacle of pleasure, because he was now beyond caring about anything but the hard line of Castiel where they were joined together.
"I doubt we've stopped them," he said. "Just slowed them down a little. And I can't stay here anymore - not after what I've done. It's not safe."
“If these men are the real Dean and Sam,” he started.
This was too much for Dean in a day of too much.
Sam nodded.
whatever it was, it wasn’t
“Hell yeah,” said Dean with enthusiasm. “But that’s why I like it. Call it the vagaries of the human spirit or something.”
Castiel blinked.
"Not forever, just for a little while."
“I will be,” he said. “I think. Lemme go get cleaned up and I’ll be right back. You got any more, uh,
“I think it depends,” he said.
something that his dad and society couldn't take away, if it lived only within his own mind.
“As to why, I imagine it has something to do with the bond forged between us,” said Castiel. “So we share our dreams as some soulmates share heavens, despite being unaware of the fact. As to how long? I cannot say.”
“Yeah, but in the traditional way,” Dean replied.
Castiel stared at Dean as if he no longer understood human language. Then through his lust-addled haze, the words connected.
"What?" Dean asked, growing more irritable by the minute.
Dean was walking through the bunker, hurrying past Castiel’s room and –
Castiel went very, very still.
Castiel looked up, in a panic, now.
It was impressive.
only to leave Dean there, hard and aching and disappointed, confusion and rejection slamming into him like a physical thing.
Still, he stood in the arched doorway and watched fondly as Cas squinched up his face and passed a hand across his eyes.
"Ah, ah, yeah, yeah," Dean said, bouncing up and down on Castiel's hard cock, humping up against him, seeking any chance at further contact, mindless, as if he could not possibly get enough, addicted and lost in the intensity, lost to nothing but animal drive.
“Can we talk?”
Dean caught his hand.
Dean, on the other hand, was grumpy about having enjoyed another good night's sleep.
anymore, kinda like when that turducken sandwich got him high.
"Of course!" she said. "I've grown partial to one or two of them in my old age anyway. You're all welcome to them. I can't be in five places at once."
"Now," said Felipe, "if the food here isn't to your liking, I've squirrelled away a little something in case we get peckish."
"Okay," said Dean. "So what's this work that needs doing?"
He relaxed when he recognized Sam standing above him, and swung himself into a sitting position.
the rough steel wool of him cut and dragged bone-clean like a rusted rustless thing dropped in a vat of Coca-Cola,
"What brings you out this way, Garth?" asked Dean, and there was an edge of suspicion in his voice.
It was the kind of out-of-the-way place you didn't see too often these days, where you could still smoke indoors because the local cops didn't give a shit about it.
Castiel narrowed his eyes.
Dean had never bared this much of his body before to a stranger, not without a million-dollar clause and insurance, but riling up Castiel was worth the effort.
Did you recognize that Dean was singing the 50 States Song? as he figured whatever was interpreting for him would probably use the definitions of the state names and therefore sound fairly mysterious ;)
“You shut your whore mouth,” said Castiel.
“Holy shit,” said Dean. “Holy shit, Cas.”
“Oh,” Dean replied. “Figures you’d know. Health nut and all.”
The party kept going, but Dean pulled Castiel away from the crowd, head a little turned with the wine and with the evening.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So… even though Dean might not want to die, you'll kill him anyway?” asked Sam.
There is evidence of this phenomenon everywhere – even Legally Blonde shows a rich blonde lady who gets treated poorly by her classmates at first due to her way of talking and manner of dress, despite her being incredibly bright. This woman, conversely, would be immediately accepted into drifter and hobo society, should she happen upon it.
the cogs in Dean’s mind were turning.
Dean nodded, but at the look in Castiel's eye, he said:
Abruptly, Dean turned to him on the path.
Eileen was kind of similar. She’d show up and hang out with Sam for a few days and then she was on the road again. Sam was content with it, so it worked for the both of them.
For Dean was young, to Castiel, although relatively old, nearly of middle age in human years as Castiel understood it.
Currently, Dean had the distinct impression of Cas hooking his chin over Dean’s shoulder and looking down into the pot.
“Is that, uh, doin’ it for you or something?”
I wanted you - but I wanted you to want me more."
ed at him again and Castiel recalled the many times that Dean said he hated that sound because it seemed so arrogant.
" quoted Dean, because given any and all opportunities to quote
“Cas,” he said, and held out a hand; Castiel, as always, went to him.
Not that he needed to; this was heaven.
"I'll wait," he said quietly. "Thank you. Ma'am."
Sam emerged from the tiny bathroom, toweling off his hair.
I find, as Americans, it is a place we don't romanticize or think about very much, if at all.
Dean paused, and straightened up from where he had been turning rocks over with the stick.
“Okay, thanks,” said Dean, and he went outside to Castiel’s front door. He knocked on it, but no one answered.
Sinking down, down together in a torrent neither understood nor could command, pulling, grabbing, scratching at each other’s clothing to reveal to peel back to find the wanted skin beneath;
in the word was getting Dean all misty-eyed.
“And there’s no organization of monsters?”
Sam shook his head, and then grinned.
He looked at Sam, who gave him an encouraging nod.
They had been trading punches, bruised and bleeding, over some infraction Dean had committed, being far too careless on a hunt.
“How d’you know that?” he asked.
Thing was, it was the truth:
The world was filled with smoke and light.
Dean returned with glasses of water for them.
It hadn’t eased the tension, it had stoked it.
“See? I couldn’t
“Apologies,” said Cas.
the unknowable being made of love and light.
“What?” asked Sam, giving chase as Dean ran off.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
and everything, I don’t want to be – the place is beautiful, the people are so nice, but…
“I assure you, it was entirely unintentional.”
“Yeah?” asked Dean stupidly, wanting badly to ask, “Are you sure you want this?”
“Then think of me as being just down the hall,” said Dean with a rakish smile that set Castiel’s heart on a sideways gallop. “Either way you look at it.”
The desire to drift also switches from Dean to Sam in a completely arbitrary way, like they wished they’d done it the other way around from the start once they realized that Dean played well with the nerd crowd. However, it always struck me as the same kind of fantasy that nerd guys have about getting the cheerleader: Dean’s the cool one and wouldn’t it be awesome if the cool one/jock type
Castiel gritted his teeth.
Besides, there had been a faint hum coming from the vial before, an ongoing vibration in his hand against his skin, but he’d only noticed it now that it had stopped.
He knew the people of this pueblo very well, their grandparents and their grandparents’ grandparents. He had been here since time out of mind.
"You prefer the physical," he said.
"Where are you going?"
“Then fight for the island, Sam.”
But not too disinterested, either.
“Oh, no, I’m not interested right now,” he said. “I’m sorry.”
“Excellent choice, sir,” said the man, but again, as if talking to Sam, who had returned to the counter with his charger.
Castiel sighed, bobbing the tea bag in his tea.
"Move in with me."
“We don’t know if he’s dead or alive,” said Sam. “Besides, Cas told us Balthasar’s address, he lives nearby, right?”
“Ugh,” he informed his brother expressively.
Castiel leaned forward, gripping Dean by the nape of his neck.
While in there, he resolved that this time, he’d actually speak to Castiel.
Dean felt sideways.
Dean took a cautious sip.
Dean struggled, but it was for show, and Castiel knew that; the angel leaned down and whispered in his ear:
"I'm not askin' for everything, Cas," he said, "I know I screwed up bad. I know I - I don't deserve it. I'm just - I'm askin' for now. For today. If we can start over again, somewhere."
“But I’ll say you sure as hell keep you promises.”
It was a dinosaur, a relic of a former time, and still took cash.
He looked off into the middle distance, wistful.
Castiel put his hands on Dean and steered him toward the refrigerator. Then he turned him around to press him very gently against the front of it.
“He will return,” Cas said, right next to his ear, making Dean jump a mile.
"I love you," he said, startling Castiel with his frankness. "God, I love you. Beyond anything. Beyond everything. It scares the hell outta me sometimes."
Castiel blinked at him.
So, don’t let them put you down about fanfiction, about reading it or writing it or enjoying it, no matter how weird. In fact, the weirder the better, because if I have to read one more overwrought awful sex scene in ‘literary’ works my eyes are gonna roll straight out my head and down the alleyway. Some of these people I have to question if they have indeed ever had sex at all or only heard of it in passing from an alien.
"Yes, why?" Scully replied.
“No,” said Dean’s mouth. “I just think we ought to watch our money, you know, since we’re doin’ the big-spender thing here with this fancy hotel.”
"Gorgeous. You're so fuckin' gorgeous, Cas, you know that? Like a Renaissance painting."

"Yeah, well," he said, a little of his fire gone out, "I'm readjusting."
He wasn’t the type to be a real shithead to waiters or anything like that, because he did have some manners. But he also lived in a world where everything he did was carefully choreographed because everyone was constantly watching him and that did not make for a polite personality.
"My name is Castiel," said the man, and that whisky-rumble was even more pronounced here in the quiet, "but for the duration, I'd like you to call me
but for nerd girls.
Dean stared at him, thoughts going wild in a mind that had been eerily calm for the duration.
The tree that was his body also looked strong and well.
And, true to his word, Castiel backed off, returning to his corner.
“Oh, there you are,” she said. “I’m so sorry for all this bother.”
He recognized the old
“What the actual fuck, Cas.”
Dean knew there were no more places to run.
"I'm not sure I deserve all that," he muttered.
"Whatcha doin'?" asked Dean, although he could see that Castiel was cleaning the floor.
What's the problem, anyway? You've known that we do this the entire time you've worked for me! We're under
Dean looked down at the precious red velvet cake still left on his plate.
And so he was, for all intents and purposes.
"Where, exactly, are you calling from?"
“It’s – it’s! Ah, hell. The damned virus! That whole, the thing about supply lines! It was true. Trust the devil to lie for fuck’s sake. Well. Lie and tell the truth. Anyway – ”
But now –
He didn’t know how to respond to kindness.
Castiel was alarmed to hear the soft movement of fabric, to know that Dean had taken himself in hand, out here where anyone might encounter the two of them.
Dean blinked.
New ones, coming in all the time.
He waved a hand at the general state of things.
Castiel no longer stayed in Dean's room when he woke, preferring to do his work and then leave before his charge opened his eyes.
He folded his arms.
Castiel blinked up at the sky.
Afterwards, Castiel cleaned everything with a wave of his hand.
Dean also experiences that panic of drunks everywhere,
"Yes. Terribly."
Sam hung up the phone and ran a hand through his hair.
Castiel sighed and crossed his arms.
“Then I’m gonna do it, Sam,” said Dean.
Dean's eyes fluttered closed.
"I trust last night went well," he said.
He wanted that
“And there you go again! Totally resistant every time I bring it up. Like you’re an agent who has begun to believe his cover story.”
fortunately interrupted by a sharp rap at the door.
look that he had patented while growing up with his overgrown hairball of a brother.
Then, Dean ran to the machinery and loosened the screws, freeing the angel.
"I also like to be thorough," said Castiel, in that bone-deep growl that made Dean shiver.
"Dean," he said. "This will be as permanent as you wish it to be."
“It was an accident!” said Dean.
And he was - his lover, was one of the natives,
Castiel looked surprised, and then kissed back, helping Dean out of his clothing.
Castiel stared at the man, and then up at the crucifix.
I hope it will be enjoyable company.
Or at least, not entirely.
Castiel breathed.
Then he disappeared.
He was looking at lychee in jelly when someone tapped him on the shoulder.
And Castiel, hanging heavy and threatening-gray, like the best of the summer thunderstorms, lightning waiting to strike,
Dean had lived, by now, at least three lifetimes.
A wild guess.
the Shadow had told Castiel.
He walked inside, more cautious now.
He stared at the bottle and sighed.
“Good,” said Castiel. “Because I am going to make you feel incredible, and I want my name to be the only thing you know.”
“Fuck,
“Where do you think you are?”
“I’m yours, Castiel, I belong to you,” Dean assured him again. “Fuck me, take me,
The dawn was approaching, and the birds were waking, beginning to sing in the trees.
"I'm just going to the bathroom," said Castiel. "I'll be back in a moment. All right?"
But Dean wasn’t having it.
There was silence then, but only for a moment, because Dean said:
“What the hell was that?” asked Dean, getting to his feet.
"I may have harboured -
“I don’t know. I always assumed that the Empty just didn’t understand me very well. Or,” he said, on a light laugh, “now that I think of it, the Shadow appeared to me as Meg.”
"Granddad?" Mulder and Scully repeated at the same time, and looked at Skinner.
and he said so.
, and it's a lie well-meaning friends will also parrot.
“You’re going to tell me what you want, Dean Winchester,” he growled. “So that I can fulfil it for you.”
"I can assure you that I am familiar with kinds of sex that you have never even heard about before," said Castiel.
Castiel made a sound then that Dean wanted to hear again and again for the rest of his life.
Not that there hadn’t been drifter serial killers, but there had been serial killers of all different kinds of people. Somehow the
Dean wagged a finger between the two of them and nodded. Sam glared at him and Scully just gave him a long-suffering look, clearly assuming he was suggesting they get together.

"I hear tell there're big storms in these parts," drawled Dean from behind him.
Then:
And maybe, in the end, that was the truth of it:
As his eyes adjusted to his surroundings, all he could see was an endless march of white and blue.
Castiel shuddered on a sigh.
some long-forgotten lover told him once.
"Greetings," Castiel said, and shook Sam's hand warmly. "You must be Dean's brother, Sam. A pleasure to meet you."

Eventually, he saw him walk down the hallway and slow cautiously near Dean's door.
This may be a little inelegant, but then I always did prefer writing fiction.
Castiel wasn’t sure how he should feel about what he had just witnessed.
"He was man enough," said Castiel.
Then she giggled, and scooted off down one of the grand hallways.
, as you call it.”
?” Dean asked. “For what?”
“You know what I mean.”
instead of sir.
He sat there in the plush pillows of the window seat and was amazed at how soft and comfortable everything was, how welcoming. It reminded him of hot chocolate when you first get indoors on a cold winter’s day.
the first time.
“And it showed you that you aren’t the monster you seem to believe yourself to be.”
"You're a douchebag," returned Dean, winding his arms around Castiel. "And Cas is twice the angel you will
The vines and trees and grasses grew until they filled the room, their own private little garden of Eden.
Dean unbuckled his own jeans and they hung there, unzipped, as he fumbled in his pocket for the lube.
so don't twist yourself into knots trying to avoid it, lad."
There were two doors – one in, one out. Beyond the first, in the darkened store, it said ENTRANCE on what looked like a rainbow Lite-Brite toy.
“You know I’d never want you like this.”
"I thought you considered me Irish."
Staring into his eyes, Dean said:
“You sure are dedicated to your job.”
He went through his daily duties with the usual aplomb, but his nerves felt like they were skittering beneath his skin.
USA Up All Night ran in the 80s and 90s and often featured sexploitation films.
Castiel stood waiting patiently next to him.
I’ve – I’ve, I’m so
thought Dean.
"Hold that thought," said Dean, getting out of bed and pulling on his trousers.
Also, it's just super shitty to charge eight bucks because you poured two-buck chuck into a Mason jar, ironic or not.
“So what do you wanna do now?” Dean asked.
“So what movie do you want to watch?” Dean asked, as he got everything together.
Dean stared up at Castiel, who was staring down at him, one wing over the both of them, confident and sure.
he reminded himself sourly.
on a loud high harsh whine that was no less music to the ears of the one for whom it was intended,
I learned all of the above things and several more in my twenties, living alone on the American road, and feeling my way blindly through society. These things that other people think of as things
“Damn,” said Dean.
Then he rolled his eyes, laughed, said:
“Figures.”
Castiel made a dismissive noise and rolled his eyes.
The defensiveness also tends to come from a place of discomfort, because it forces them to ask themselves if they need to examine their own drinking habits, too.
what that word means.”
“You said there’s nobody, I’m checking. If I get bit by a rattlesnake you better suck the venom out yourself.”
The man blanched.
Surprised, Dean looked up at his brother, and instead of anger, he saw something that looked more like…
Multiple appendages pierced Dean’s skin, drawing blood, and pumping him full, as both Dean and Castiel cried out in the strange joy of their mating –
He disappeared out the door, and Dean’s eyes followed the graceful motion of his sleek black wings.
"Seven years, give or take."
"Communication is key, in these situations," said Castiel. "I will give you half of your payment now, the other half at the end of the week. Does that suit?"
Dean turned toward him, his sunlight as if he were a sunflower.
yourself, have you?” asked the man, with a little shake of his head and click of his tongue. “Naughty.”
Unfortunately, his mind was elsewhere.
Dean nodded dumbly. She winked.
"Ah, good," said Dean. "The seafood course is here."
“It’s not just the war,” said Dean. “The war – it was shitty, yeah. But it also brought back memories I really wish it hadn’t.”
“I’m America’s Sweetheart, remember?”
Castiel shrugged.
"I'm very sorry, Dean," he said. "I did what I could. There are other gods I could speak to, but from what I gathered, we're here for the duration."
The man got to his feet, and the shadows disappeared.
He yawned and stood up.
It was a few days later, and he had gone on a case that ended with him chopping things up in the sewer.
They dressed, wordless, to the surprise of Heracles and the general expectation of Pasion.
And she threw the coffeepot on the ground, where it shattered into a million pieces.
"C'mon, Cas, please," begged Dean. "Touch me."
Blue, and white, with gulls wheeling overhead.
"They make you promise not to giggle at the statuary," she said. "I'll have you know, I've seen things, young man."
From thicket-cutters around a small spring on the mainland, to the people of the wind;
Another thing Dean Winchester knows:
“I mean…nothing. Just, a strange turn of phrase to use. Something I’ve heard before, it’s ringing a bell like I saw it in a movie once a long time ago or something.”
I thought, and - why didn't you tell me, Dean, you know I'd have been supportive, I don't understand - "

the Thousand Year Dragon. Legend has it the tree is thousands of years old but experts have argued it’s really only several hundred. It’s in the Canary Islands, in Africa. Well, Spain, but physically in Africa.”
“What the hell you think I’m doing?” Dean said. “Sometimes –
“Oh, I mean, be my guest,” Lucifer said lightly, gesturing at Dean’s surreptitious attempt to get at his cell phone. “Call Sammy! That’s who I’m here for, after all.”
"Garth Fitzgerald IV," he said. "At your service."
“It’s okay to want nice things, Dean.”
He stared out the window this time, blankly, at the people passing by outside.
Sam, meanwhile, had made himself comfortable on some cushions.
“Okay,” he said. “Okay. Well, if this
” he sighed. “
"I came here to say I'm sorry," said Dean. "We need to talk, Castiel. A real conversation."
Castiel was looking everywhere but either of them.
"In my true form I'm taller even than that," said Castiel smugly, coming up alongside him.
He motioned to Dean to continue.
"Heracles says we have to meet for the orgy," Pasion told them. "We go to fight in the morning."
Say what you want about angels, but all that healing crap was far more utilitarian than holistic, in Dean’s extensive experience with the species.
After a good dousing of water, the scattering of the ashes into the wind behind the motel room’s back door, Dean spent ten more minutes in thought,
They emerged into a larger room and found Castiel, tied to a chair, and a woman leaning over him. A turntable nearby was playing the song as she sang along to it.
Dean wipes his hand down his face melodramatically.
calling
“What, Cas?” Dean asks pompously, maneuvering Cas’s legs so that he can straddle him instead, before leaning down on one arm to lick around Cas’s neck. Having made Cas come in a matter of minutes has him smug again, feeling as though he’s a master teaching a novice. That is until Cas grabs his ass with one hand, his back with the other, and flips him unceremoniously onto his back.
But instead, he just asks, “How you feeling?”
“You have no idea what you’re talking about,” Durga spits. “I
Dean can feel it like a heat lamp when Cas turns to look at him. He chances a glance. Cas is biting his lip and pursing at the same time, like he’s keeping a secret. Or about to pull a prank. Which would be concerning for Dean, if Cas’s eyes weren’t filled with such fondness that he can’t help but relax.
Dean doesn’t quite understand the sentence. “I what?”
“This will be useful for twenty-four hours, after that, it’s just a paper map again.”
A small flame ignites in the center of his palm, which he quickly shakes out.
this.”
Their supposed siren is walking with purpose towards the building’s door. She flips a lock of blonde hair over her shoulder, her hips swinging in a tight dress. Dean lets out a breath that’s almost a whistle.
Cas clicks his tongue. “You’re exhibiting the behavior of an adolescent human in the early stages of socialization.”
Dean just grins like an asshole. As usual.
“Shit, I don’t know.” Dean leans back, lets out a roar. “Shit!”
“Right? I mean, why are these guys popping up everywhere? We never figured out what brought them to Santa Rosa.”
“What?”
“Yeah for like two seconds before he turned tail for some girl or something.” Dean’s chewing on his lip. “He doesn’t know anything, just said it seems like a curse and fucked off.”
Cas raises his glass sort of meekly. Dean clears his throat, shakes his head, assessing.
Sam turns the trinket over in his hands. It’s a tiny glass-beaded rope about the width of a pencil, with a metal ring on the end. It’s intricately, geometrically patterned. He cannot imagine a world in which he uses it, but still, the gesture makes him smile. “Thanks, Cas.”
“Yeah,” Cas mutters, not looking up.
Dean wants to address the Kali thing again but suddenly Cas appears by his side, trench coat swishing against his jeans. Cas squints as Dean straightens and looks into the middle distance, then at him in the mirror, the thrusting of his toothbrush slowly coming to a halt like a train.
“Yeah, you know. Celebrate a win?” Dean mumbles, chewing his lips.
He remembers the sparring match, Cas a heavy weight on his ass, pushing him into the floor, holding his arms down. He convinced himself it was leftover Gabriel spell. Except that was months ago, and he’s laying here in bed now, touching the spot on his sternum that Cas shoved. Picturing Cas towering over him with determination and intensity. It stirs something. Specifically something in his jeans.
Cas puffs a breath out, looks out the window. Dean sighs again, swings his knees onto the seat and fully turns around, says, “Look at me Cas!” and reaches out to grab his lapel. Cas finally looks up at him like he’s grown a second head. He slinks back, and his utter bewilderment pulls a smile wide across Dean’s face.
feel is what I feel? What do
“You alright back there?” Dean asks gruffly.
“Isn’t that cute? How’s that binding spell working out for you?”
“I’m going to trap Gabriel…and kill his…head off,” Cas mutters, not looking up as he searches the shelves. Dean grabs him by the shoulders and spins him around.
Cas only wrinkles his brow and says “Hmm,” as an acknowledgment.
He pulls the notebooks out to start, but without an index or table of contents, he’s stuck leafing through them and skimming. And there’s not much information about grace or its properties or what could affect it, just a bunch of instructions for which sigils do what and how, or recipes for spells and their incantations with phonetic spelling.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says sincerely, as if this was a great favor.
Cas squeezes his fingers into Dean’s elbows and gnashes his teeth. There’s a sound like a wind tunnel and Dean’s stomach drops when Cas throws him to the ground. It’s not until after the light explodes and disintegrates, after the unmistakable thump of a body to the ground, that Dean realizes there’s no rash from asphalt, but instead just a bruise from a hard wooden floor. He opens his eyes and registers all at once the library and Cas in an unmoving heap across from him.
“It’s gonna be okay,” Eileen says from the backseat.
“So, you summon any other gods searching for magic crossbows?” Dean asks over the steam from his coffee. He holds it with two hands up to his face, blowing on it.
Cas has had a lot of experiences. He’s like millions of years old. He’s taken vessels before, and he’s had sex even. But this—Dean, his mischievous smirk inches away, his callused hand roaming down the expanse of skin over his ribs, down to the softness of his stomach, around the protruding edge of hip bone. It’s overpowering.
They knew the objective was to get answers, but they were both pretty proud of themselves nonetheless. Taking out some flesh-eating creeps and surviving is enough some days.
you. You can’t—you can’t tell me you don’t…want to…” he trails off, looking back down to Cas’s lips.
“What the f—”
“What the hell was that, man?” He asks hoarsely. Cas turns his hand in the air and stares at his palm.
“Come on, man. Don’t be a baby. It’s
“And I don’t want to hurt you,” he says flatly. He turns to leave but can feel Dean’s swing coming before he sees it. He grabs his wrist, pivots behind him, and firmly shoves his back so he takes a few steps. “
Your divine wrath is to be used for the liberation of the oppressed. Not…not this.”
“Holidays are...a lot of them are celebrations of human survival. When it comes down to it. And in a universe that is, apparently, apathetic to their existence. Mostly. Present company excluded,” he almost smirks. “But I rarely felt my survival was...It wasn’t until after I fell...” he looks away, sips again, “that I could feel anything close to...to human. But then, after having died multiple times, if anything it made it all feel...inapplicable again. To me.”
Dean doesn’t understand. Cas isn’t sure he wants him to. He looks back at the book in his lap, fiddles with the brittle page. They are silent for a minute.
“You said Gabriel brought a potion?” Cas cuts him off again, turning to walk away. Dean grabs his arm instinctively, spins him around to face him.
“How am I gonna get better, huh?” Dean punches again, not sure why he’s demanding, “I mean, unless you’re too tired or something. If trenchcoat baby needs to go sleep...”
And Dean’s heart is racing so hard it almost hurts. He’s had a lot of
“As far as we know,” Eileen signs.
A guarded look of understanding dawns on Cas’s face, “Are you…attempting a ‘chick flick moment’?”
It lands in Dean’s stomach, knocking the wind out of him. He doubles over, waving a fist haphazardly in Cas’s general direction. “Man, I’m not—Can you just fucking chill?” he breathes once he gets his bearings.
“How were there so many of them?” Sam asks as the church empties of people. “I thought—lore says they only come around every fifty years.”
“Yes, I checked every room.” Dean shakes his head, then the talisman. “Is this thing broken?”
“Glitterfeather’s Magical Emporium?” Dean asks, incredulous. “That’s the store’s name?”
“Are we…interrupting?” Eileen raises an eyebrow with a smirk.
Cas reaches over, his fingers hovering an inch from his cheek. Now that Dean
Eileen surveys the whole scene, the effort to suppress a laugh pulling her mouth in all manner of directions. She pulls her phone out and steps into the room, holding it out to Cas.
“We have to find them, and fast. The warding here is not enough to contain her for long. She’s wounded but she’ll heal.” Kali paces the room.
“Damn!” Gabriel exclaims, inside the dungeon already. “How did you do that? I gotta hand it to you guys, you just keep on surprising.”
“What?”
“Look asshat,” Dean starts intelligently. “You’re gonna give me the skull stick. And you wanna know why? ‘Cause I’m the one outside the circle. And circle takes the square. Staff. Thing.” He shakes his head.
“Uh…” Sam says.
“I brought you a present,” he says cheerfully, holding up the liquor bottles. “Time to have a chat.”
Dean sighs. Everything’s such a production. He grabs the seat back and twists his neck around to face Cas in the back seat.
this works,” Dean corrects, glaring at him.
. He becomes aware of his entire body, waiting for Cas to finish.
“How are we supposed to do that?” Sam asks, incredulously.
“You call this managing it?” Dean snorts, takes a gulp. “You been pouting in here a week.”
,” he rolls his eyes and crosses his arms, “I have, it’s kind of a…personal item.”
“Kevin?” Sam asks.
Cas just shakes his head. Dean shrugs and steps back into the bathroom to finish brushing. When he looks up, Cas is looming in the doorway. Dean holds his gaze in the mirror. Then he makes the conscious decision to slowly spit the toothpaste in the sink in a manner that anyone (but Dean) might describe as pornographic. Neon blue flashes in Cas’s eyes as he takes an audible gulp, then blinks and shakes his head. The lamps in the bedroom flicker out silently.
with a look, since he can’t come up with the right words.
“So, we thought it was a shifter because of the doppelgangers,” Sam explains over the phone as Dean shifts lanes to pick up some speed, “but Eileen talked to a witness that said, get this, her dad had to
“Look, I’m as freaked as you are,” Sam says foolishly. Dean gives him a hard glare until Sam amends, “Okay, okay, I mean I’m freaked out too. But we can’t let the monsters go. We have to figure out how many we’re dealing with.”
,” Dean continues, “You need to know if what
Dean stills entirely, his face and chest suddenly hot. He knows he’s good looking, and he has certain features that

what you’re doing.
When Dean’s palm is healed, their hands drop to their sides, both flexing subconsciously.
“Might as well be,” Cas shrugs. Dean shakes his head and realizes Cas still has his shoes on.
“Let me go,” Eileen says from the back. “I’m disarming. I’ll say I’m a…a journalist.”
Cas adjusts his folded arms, eyes trained Louise slow kissing a man in a motel room. He mutters, “I thought you didn’t like ‘chick flicks.’”
“Dean? You seen Cas?” Sam asks from the hall. “We got everything ready in the library.”
Cas says, “You...” and Dean says, “I...” and Cas says, “You just...you kissed…me.” It starts out as a question but ends as a statement of fact. There’s no denying it. Dean takes a step back, grasps the counter behind him to steady himself.
Back at the bunker, Dean locks himself in his room and starts whisper screaming for Gabriel. He appears after a minute wearing a toga. The skin that shows is shiny with oil, which makes Dean gag just a little bit, but he’s in no mood to address it.
“Holy fucking shit,” Dean breathes, watching the ash float to the floor. He feels Cas relax against his arm and when he looks up, Cas has his palms out in front of him, blue light sparking in his hands. He looks up at Dean with palpable relief. They share thick smiles as Cas reaches up to Dean’s hand—still holding up the gun—and lets his grace curl out over the cuts from the glass, to heal him.
Cas tries to keep his eyes open, to watch the movement of Dean’s tongue flicking out of his exquisite mouth and along the length of his dick, but the sensations keep drawing his eyes closed. And when he notices the movement of Dean’s hand, stroking himself to the same rhythm, and Dean’s eyes cast upward to meet his own, he feels a wave of static over his whole body.
“Guh,” he moans intelligently, swinging his legs over the edge. He kneads at more knots in his bare shoulders.
“Sounds like a waste of energy,” Dean chuckles.
Cas takes big ugly gulps from the mason jar, dribbling green sludge down his chin and onto his coat. It’s like 3 AM and Dean is somewhere between collapsing and running laps. He scrubs his hand over his face, sits on the edge of the table, waits.
“Yeah, like, we can cross that bridge later.”
Dean shares a look with Sam. Eileen’s voice wavers, “Um…guys?”
got rid of the bastard. Don’t go calling him back here, okay?”
Cas scoffs and mutters something too lowly under his breath for Dean to hear.
the blood of a whole town in New Mexico on your hands?”
“Alcohol impairs the information processing center used to inhibit impulses. I’m under no illusions about your sexual orientation or desires. You don’t have to say it. I’m…” Cas trails off, flinching.
Cas disappears. Dean pouts, just a tiny bit.
, apparently to ask directions to a piece of equipment
,” Kali growls, stepping closer.
“I don’t want to—”
, Dean thinks simply. He’s grinning when Cas finally opens his eyes, his breath evening out.
“Let me out,” she demands, her voice shredded and low and all around him.
Dean rolls his eyes dramatically to no one. Sam must be Skyping with Eileen again and fantasizing about traveling like honeymooners and probably painting his nails and braiding his hair, too. He wanders down the hall to the library, where Cas is reading a paperback novel.
“It’s sort of hard if we don’t know what
Cas struggles rabidly against Dean’s hand, which is now clutching him by the shoulder. But then there’s a thunderous crack and Dean’s thrown in the air, crashing into a bookcase. Something pops in his shoulder at the same moment a thick book drops onto his skull and he loses track of his hands.
“I don’t know, I think he needs to rest, man. It looks like his battery is drained. And not to be that guy, but—the rakshasa are still out there.” Sam runs his hands through his big dumb hair.
“What happened?” Kali’s head tilts like a dog hearing something far off. “Did she…were you…”
Sam and Eileen roll their eyes in unison.
“Shut up,” Cas mutters back, pushing the hem up with his thumbs, skating his hands up over Dean’s chest to pull the shirt over his head. “I only needed to confirm that you’re as emotionally compromised as I am,” he drops the shirt on the floor, “and now that I know, I’d like to continue to engage in our previous activities which seemed to be leading to sexual intercourse.”
“Wait,” he pulls back an inch to whisper, “let’s go to my room.”
“I can manage—” Cas starts before Dean cuts him off by banging the bathroom door open.
“Don’t try and bait me, you’re not good at it,” Gabriel rolls his eyes. Kali circles over to Eileen, who is holding the marker up and gesturing to the map. She takes the marker and carefully draws three more X’s, revealing a circle of targets. Kali and Gabriel share a worried look.
“So we’re just keeping a deity strapped in the dungeon?” Dean asks.
Things get mostly back to normal for a few weeks, until Christmas.
“That’s a bit weird, isn’t it?” Gabriel folds his arms. “Rakshasa popping up like moles. In middle America.”
Before the crowd of townsfolk behind them can even start murmuring in relief, Gabriel appears. He snatches the weapon from Dean, narrows his eyes with a scowl, then an alarming smirk, and disappears again. Sam and Cas exchange a worried look, but Dean just shrugs as if to say,

“How do you people keep getting in here?!” Dean roars. “Do we have

“We sure this is a siren?” Sam stage whispers, tightening his grip on the bronze knife.
“Shredded ‘em pretty good,” Dean murmurs, dabbing around the cuts. He drops the cloth by the sink and grabs an alcohol swab, pressing lightly to the wounds and eliciting a soft hiss from Cas. He pulls gauze and tape from the plastic kit.
Cas kisses him back, just in case it is his last chance. He brings his hands up to Dean’s chest, pressing firmly into the muscle, while Dean pushes insistently, gripping the back of his head. They start to shuffle backwards, until Cas bumps into the desk, jolting him enough to pull away.
But Dean’s never wanted to kiss a man before. Even ones he knows are attractive. Ones he’s…attracted to? Is that it? Has he always been this way and never once considered it?
“What the fuck is a witch-killing bullet? That’s the stupidest…” She eyes the counter for blunt objects behind her as Dean takes a few more steps forward.
Still nothing.
“Durga. Please.” Kali’s whips recede into her hands. “This isn’t you. You’re a goddess of
“Well, you know of anyone that might have a grudge?” Dean questions, waving a sausage link on his fork.
“Cas, that was…” Dean reaches for Cas’s wrist to pull him over top of him. When he settles, Dean pushes a hand through Cas’s hair and kisses him, slowly and resolutely. “I’m not sure I’ll ever recover,” he whispers with a laugh.
“Cow mutilations.” Dean deadpans, tightening his grip on the wheel. He looks at Cas in the rearview, who’s just staring out the window, a muscle flexing in his taut jaw.
Dean grimaces. “Yugh. So what then? What did you do? Cause nothing’s been going on here.”
The reflection of Christmas lights in Cas’s eyes. The warmth of his laughter, and the wrinkles emerging in the bridge of his nose and around his eyes along with it. His soft black hair cradling the halo as Dean leans in, tenderly, for a kiss. He remembers not just what happened, but the feelings, too. How something was loose and bouncy in his chest, something tight in his throat.
Cas leaves an inch of space between their palms as usual. And then, for seemingly no reason at all, Dean can’t help but close it. His heart starts skipping. His eyes are roving the room, embarrassed. Mercifully, Sam is busy tapping away on his phone. But Cas notices the heat of his flat hand, then the blush crawling up Dean’s neck—confusingly—and says nothing.
Cas shakes his head, silent, lips moving for a moment.
“Okay, so. You’re telling me this Durga chick, she’s trying to unleash these, these rakshasa demons as revenge. For—”
Dean has the sudden, unmistakable appearance of a man, blackout drunk, with an idea. He holds up a finger and runs to a storage room, comes back with a handful of crafting supplies. Dean starts wrapping pipe cleaners around in loops. Cas looks on, amused and curious. He’s had a few glasses of whiskey, which has just warmed his cheeks, but Dean’s been drinking since the afternoon, and he only has the tolerance of a human. A functioning alcoholic human, sure, but even so.
Cas rolls his eyes and shakes his head. “Dean, you are…”
“Fix it,
“If this has something to do with my power, I should be there to examine it,” Cas asserts.
So he swings the door shut behind him and dusts his hands on his legs. He takes one purposeful breath. He doesn’t have a plan. He’s making it up as he goes.
“Cas?” Dean knock on his door. He’s got two fresh bottles of gin, which he thinks Cas likes, and two glasses in his fingers.
Dean searches his memories. The last witch they encountered definitely got dead. Burnt to a crisp. And that was a while back. “No, I don’t think so…I guess I don’t know.”
Cas drops the jar onto the table and stretches his hands, making fists. He lifts his arms, slowly flaps like a chicken.
“I told you, it was research. Why are you fighting me?”
“Solange,” Cas slurs, “She’s…a singer. She’s Beyonce’s…her…”
Apparently taking after Dean, Cas deals with his feelings like a man. Which is to say he converts all negative emotions into rage and then directs that rage outward. In this case it is justified, but the amount of fury and malice in his voice when he growls “Gabriel...” startles Dean.
The woman straightens with obvious alarm. Then Kali appears and grabs her arms from behind, a rope of red light wrapping around her entire body.
“Actually, yeah,” Dean says. “See we been doing this a long time. We got silver bullets, demon-killing bullets, witch-killing bullets,” he notices her tic just slightly at that, “devil’s trap bullets, brass bullets, salt bullets—”
“Limp again, huh?” Dean chuffs, a little too satisfied.
“Cas,” he breathes. “I have never in my life felt about
“So, let me get this straight,” Dean leans back in his chair at the map table. “The goddess falls in love with a witch, who mindwhammies her into raising a bunch of demons so that they can build an army?”
“Your place just happens to have a special chair with magic handcuffs,” Gabriel explains, inspecting his nails. “We might have to come back here alone,” he waggles his eyebrows at Kali, who rolls her eyes and redirects her gaze to the captive.
you,” he takes a heavy step forward, gritting his teeth, “I don’t—I’m not—You can’t keep
“If you say useful again, so help me…” Dean mutters. Cas gives him a sharp glare.
Dean shuffles a little bit. “I don’t I guess, but I keep checking on him. And I keep texting him ‘Still alive?’ and he responds ‘yes’ to those. So.”
“My grace will come back and this will all be unnecessary,” Cas notes flatly.
Cas nods as he pulls his pants up over his hips and buttons them. “Yes, of course. Anything you wish. I won’t tell anyone.”
Dean stumbles into Cas’s room, which is a thing he has because he lives there.
Then, after slicing his hand and crushing the ingredients, Dean holds the talisman over the map table. He chants a phrase in Latin and the amulet magnetizes to a spot in the middle of the United States. Kansas, in fact. “Alright, so the angel’s in the in-field.”
Cas gestures around and knocks over an empty bottle in the process. “Oh,” he says, and crumples a little. Dean stops the rolling glass with his foot and offers his hand.
Cas lifts two fingers to Dean’s mouth, presses them to his lips. Dean closes his eyes and sighs without hesitation. He lets the grace flow in and around his mouth. Tastes it. Cas’s breath catches when Dean parts his lips just enough to take in the tips of his fingers. He tentatively licks across the pads. Cas goes stock still. Dean opens his eyes slowly, lids heavy, gold lashes catching in the light. He looks deep into Cas’s eyes and thinks
“Okay. So we’re on the neighborhood watch. Looking for someone that has to be invited inside, and looks like someone else, but we don’t know what.” Dean folds his arms.
Dean closes his eyes and shakes his head, clarifies, “We
“I don’t know,” Cas says lowly. His shoulders sag, drained of fury. He looks around for a minute before adding, “I’m going to my room.”
But I’m not some…some
“Huh,” he says, stupidly. “I have died, though. Like a lot.”
He and Cas stare at each other from across the room for several moments. Dean looks back at the tree. “I guess it’s nice,” he says more to himself, “these decorations. But he didn’t even…”
“Why?” Dean asks over his shoulder as he starts picking up some books off the floor, arranging them in his arms. “I’m just helping you—”
Cas’s mouth falls open but he can’t summon a single word so he just nods slightly, unable to glean anything but desire from Dean’s face. Even if it doesn’t end up exactly how he wants, Cas thinks this might be his only chance.
I mean the bandaging.”
Cas is still on top of the sheets when Dean opens the covers on the other side of the bed. The shuffling of cloth and weight as he settles in on the mattress stirs Cas, and Dean freezes. But Cas only rolls onto his side, facing away, and folds his hands up under his chin. Dean lets out a breath of relief and falls asleep before his head hits the pillow.
Dean looks over at Cas still standing by the doorway. There’s a few locks of hair sticking up, a bit windswept, but otherwise he looks pristine. He’s standing with his arms at his sides, palms up, as if to say,
Sam nods, gulping. Dean shoots him a glare, but he just holds his hands up and shrugs.
“No wait, it’s not…standing.” He wrestles with the wire with both hands. He’s in front of Cas, elbows bumping on his shoulders, as he fidgets with the thing in his hair. Cas watches his face intently, his eyes catching on Dean’s mouth where his tongue pops out to pull his lip in to bite, as Dean firmly concentrates on the task at hand and not looking down into Cas’s eyes. “There,” he says finally, dropping one hand to Cas’s shoulder, the other gesturing to the tree. “Now we have an angel for the tree.”
“I guess it’s time to read more angel lore,” Sam nods positively, like an eager nerd.
“Why do you keep saying that? What is that?”
He’s up on the hillside, leaning his elbows against a rusted and forgotten handrail, shoulders hunched, looking over the field off to the side of the building. From across the way, Dean can see his puffs of breath.
“And also that exposure is hazardous for you. For everyone.”
Sam swings the door open and freezes. Dean tries to cause him psychic damage by thinking the word
Dean moans around a mouthful of dough and filling. “Oh my god, what’s in this?” He takes another bite and his eyes roll back into his head.
But at that moment john came home. He looked at the boys. He looked at the mud they'd dragged everywhere and he went from zero to 100 real quick. It didn't matter than he never cleaned up anything and he sure wasn't going to have to clean up mud and that kids were always cleaning up after themselves. It only mattered that he'd come home from his work and it was unclean. Dean and sam each crawled to a different corner and stood up. The floors shifted under john's boots as he walked across the room from the main door and took a look at everything and closed the window which then made the room's smell to fully manifest. And well, dean had forgotten himself, he had forgotten how to behave so he did the mistake of argueing with sam on whose fault it was and who should clean it up. Sam slipped a little and made the glass of water on the floor to spill. As they argued john pushed dean to the kitchen to start cleaning there. But really, dean had forgotten how to be, he was screaming at sam heatedly that he had made all the mess and he should clean it himself. John screamed at dean to do it now and dean, he really wasn't paying attention, he was pushing against football players bigger than himself every other day at practice matches, his muscle memory was beginning to forget what it was like to break under force. He pushed back a little. And john got surprised. John did not like being surprised. He grabbed dean by the back of his neck and he shoved his face into the mud on the floor and he told him it was his job to clean It up. Now. Images of school, his classmates, his team mates, they all danced around dean's head, what would they say if they could him right now?
Cas wanted to cheer dean up but he had no idea what could lift the miserable cloud hanging over him. So he produced his flurecent marker from his pocket and drew a star on dean's palm. Dean was ticklish but he endured not scratching it to let it dry. Cas gently blew on it. and then it was time to leave.
Jo was silent. She was counting her split ends trying to distract herself from wanting to cry, ellen gave her a pat on the back and left her room. Jo sat on the floor with her back leaning on the bed Frame and drank her chocolate milk. She liked dean very much, but now that her mom was off her back, she felt guilty. So what? Who was expecting true love at high school? Why couldn’t she date dean and be happy about it?why was she picking up the phone to call him over? What was the point of this if she could just do it tomorrow after lunch ?
The highschool boy took a step back and glared at him. No one called him cas at school.
“I could bring some weed and we could ditch the dance halfway” dean’s smile had fully emerged.
Dean woke up when cas stirred awake, it must have been early morning, it was cold and quiet but they were huddled together.
Castiel looked up, he felt dean’s hands on his cheeks who then peered into him and blew gently on his face “is it gone?” He asked.
"so let's go" dean said.
And after a few seconds he released him and went back to the tv room to settle on the couch and turn on the tv. He yelled at them to bring him beer. Sam's face was pink and he hurriedly fetched a cold one from the fridge and took it to his dad.
They continued on their meal, ordered fries and milkshakes, the rain had stopped by then. Castiel paid and they went back to the car, the sky had cleared, the moon was shining, dean howled jokingly. “Come on dimitri “ cas rolled his eyes and howled with him. Their spirits had risen even with sticky uncomfortable clothes. Dean drove back and cas annoyed him by changing from the cassette to local radio stations playing girly pop songs.
"we should wash up" cas said.
The boy scratched his head.
Cas burst into a high pitched laughter. “ dean I’m just escorting her to the dance, she’ll be dancing with her girlfriend not me”
Cas shakes his head as if to shake the grace out of his eyes. “You should just leave. Until Sam and Eileen get back.”
Dean swallows thickly, glancing down at the contact. He stills. Cas stills. Dean looks back up to Cas’s face, his eyes glinting with brazen determination. “Oh yeah?”
there’s action—just shut up and watch,” he sputters.
“Holy shit,” he laughs, still stroking himself lazily. “Gonna need to keep the lights off next time.”
They wait a minute while nothing happens before Dean finally sinks onto the bed next to Cas’s feet. “I don’t know,” he says, wiping a hand down the full length of his face. “I don’t know.”
He’s said his name too many times.
“Huh? Oh, no, I was in the gym,” he says over his shoulder as he leaves.
“Mira, she…I think it was a spell, but I…I remember. It was me…” she trails off, tears or sweat rolling down her face. “Is she…”
“I thought you were better!” Dean whines, but Cas looks a little pale. A wisp of neon circles his irises. “No, Cas, not here!” Dean shakes him by the shoulders. There’s too many people around. And they’re all staring at the commotion. But light is dribbling out of Cas’s open mouth. “Cas, please!”
A shuffling noise and a click, then the knob turns slowly in his hand. He drops it as the door creaks open two inches and a single eye peers out from the darkness.
“You’re not gonna hurt me, Cas, it’s ok.” He puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder. But Cas swats it away harshly. Dean clicks his teeth and rolls his eyes. “What’s with you?”
Maybe it’s because of the daybreak bubble, or the uncertainty of whether or not Cas is even okay yet, that Dean allows it.
Dean, perpetual man of action and impatience, gives a meaningful nod to Sam before jumping up, kicking through the glass with his boot, and throwing himself through the window into a roll and crouch. He has his gun aimed before the woman can run out of the room.
Cas glances back from his stare out the window at the bar door, arches his eyebrow at the silence.
Then, almost as if on autopilot, and if you ask him, definitely stress- and sleep-induced psychosis, Dean crawls into the bed with Cas.
“Busy?” Gabriel arches an eyebrow, unbelieving.
Dean tinks his glass against Cas’s. “Well then. To surviving.”
They get into a fight about something stupid, neither understanding why or what they’re really mad about. Dean’s drunk and a little belligerent, so he starts pushing Cas by the shoulders, who stands static and sharp.
“Was that…” Cas asks, trailing off nervously. Dean opens his eyes and looks down his nose at Cas. He’s kneeling between Dean’s legs, naked and waiting, face open.
“It just redirects blood...when grace touches you.” He wipes tears from his eyes. “I don’t know
? Mr. Backseat Brooder? Sir Sulks-a-lot?”
Cas shrugs, “He said he’d call back after they talked to another witness. They were thinking a shapeshifter but now they’re not so sure.”
Dean sleeps with his exquisite mouth hanging open like a trout. It’s incredibly unseemly, and yet. Clean moonlight paints blue shadows across his face. The rhythm of his rising and falling chest moves Cas, deep in the pit of him, like a song. How he or Dean got here seems so irrelevant.
“What happened to you?” Kali’s voice softens just a little. Durga looks away, around the damp, dingy room. “Who did this to you?”
?” Gabriel waggles his eyebrows, pervily. “Not even when Cassie gives you a big sip of the blue juice?”
While Sam is elsewhere doing something nerdy or boring, Dean and Cas stakeout the bar that all five victims frequented.
“Hey,” he says softly, raising his hand to reach for Cas’s arm. He hesitates with his hand hovering in the air as Cas just looks at him with wide eyes. Dean can almost hear Cas’s heart thumping, or maybe he’s just projecting.
No amount of baseball stats could stop the rush of blood in Dean’s body.
blackout.” Frustration is bubbling now from Cas’s stubbornness. He just stares straight ahead, lips pursed in conviction. Dean folds his arms, leans in. “I didn’t say you had a beautiful mouth or something, did I?”
Dean pulls each knob until the water runs warm enough over two of his fingers. He points to the flowing column and Cas obediently, if stubbornly, pushes his knuckles under. Red splashes around the bowl, swirling into pink. Muscles tick in his jaw as the water stings, pulling debris and little bits of broken flesh down into the drain.
While performing a locating spell on a particularly nasty witch, Dean slices his palm and pours his blood into a bowl.
Cas looks out the windshield at the road stretching in front of them. Trees and telephone poles dot the fields rushing by either side. Orange bleeds into red in the sky. Robert Plant’s voice moans and wails through a static peppered with percussive beats before a guitar tears back in. Dean notices the warm glow reflecting from the sunset across Cas’s skin. He has the distinct thought:
Sam ambles up the steps with Dean trailing close behind, followed by Eileen and Cas. Once on the landing, Sam and Dean stay ducked beneath the window, their guns already out of their waistbands. Inside, a woman huddles over a table with a large stone bowl. It looks like any other apartment, except for the papers, books, branches, bottles, crystals, and other bizarre detritus littered on the floor around the room. A wisp of smoke crawls out from the bowl as she drops in it something too small to see. Her nearly floor-length curly black hair bounces slightly around her when she lets out another frustrated shout.
“Dude,” Dean sits down on the bed, “just show me. I have to know now.”
” Sam squeaks. Eileen’s eyes go wide as saucers.
“Angels don’t sleep,” Cas says reflexively, staring doubtfully at the hand before him.
“We’ll take care of that. You stay here,” Dean props himself on his elbow. “I don’t want you going Super Saiyan on us again. I can’t keep carrying you around, Cas, my back ain’t what it used to be.”
“I’m back,” Cas announces from the side of the room. He strides over to Dean, holding out a pastry in a napkin. “I brought you an empanada.”
“She’s dead,” Gabriel declares when Kali looks away and bites down.
“Uh oh. Doesn’t look friendly,” Dean mutters.
“For…for…” His hand is still on Dean’s wrist, firm.
When nothing else happens, he snaps. He takes a step back, aims, and kicks the door so hard the frame splinters, sending shards flying. Light from the hall spills into the dark room. Cas is sitting cross legged in the bed, palms up on his knees like he was meditating, but he looks at Dean with wide eyes and a gawking mouth.
He cupped the receiver and turned away.

He couldn’t believe it.

Slowly, the body morphed into Michael’s usual vessel.
He sighed.
“This is
Dean got another motel room, not saying a word to anyone else, not even to Castiel, who followed him in the door and then his hands were
"Gentlemen," Scully interrupted. "Truce, for the moment. Let's find out what's killing these people, and then we'll deal with the rest."
Dean wept, and held Castiel's shoulders, as the angel cruelly jerked him off and then stopped just as he could feel Dean's orgasm nearing. Dean screamed, and sobbed, and begged, but Castiel was relentless.
"Whoa, Dean, what the hell?" Sam said.
Castiel froze.
The director looked like he was counting to ten in his head.
So wildly, terrifyingly different that he’d just stuffed everything down and did what he’d always done-
Cas, I’m gonna put a bell on you,” he grumbled.
He touched Castiel's cheek then.
"Oh my God.
So he shot Castiel a wicked grin, and then smoothed his hands down his chest and his stomach.
"Well, yes," said Castiel. "I doubt I could manage all this on my own."
Castiel still looked uncertain.
“You’re a monster,” he said, still so beautiful, “and even if you weren’t, you’re in a dude suit, and I don’t swing that way.”
“Well, yeah,” he said. “Ain’t that what all the old stories say?”
“Then I think it’s best if I stay in your room with you tonight.”
“What’s the matter?” Dean asked. “Don’t you want – uh, to?”
” Dean groaned.
Despite these pearls of wisdom dispensed at meets and conventions, most drifters and hobos still learn this the hard way.
“So I think it’s good Castiel is there.”
“What?” Dean snapped.
Sam’s eye caught his, and he visibly recoiled.
“You are welcome to share my home,” he said. “But these things I tell you – these are the truth. Please honor my wishes.”
He sighed.

Castiel looked as if he barely tolerated the question.

“Oh for the love of – ”
“Me.”
Dean stared at it for a moment, and then got up and hobbled to the sink, washing himself off and cleaning up as best he could.
“What?”
But he had never seen it in the sunlight.
"You! It's -

Castiel was still wrapped in his bindings, but did not look overly concerned about the situation.
be that dumb.”
“How do you know I did it?”
“That so?” he asked. “Well then! Legends breakfast together. You hungry?”
"Yeah, I'm sure," he said. "Besides, what you said about how - how there's stuff I don't know. Well. I wanna know."
“Not to down on anyone’s religion but,” said Dean, “this ain’t exactly the time for Hail Marys. You can say ‘em when we get outta here – not that Chuck’s listening, but you do you.”
Books piled everywhere. One of those old-fashioned globes in a wood casing. Palm plants. Overstuffed pillows and couches here and there, throw rugs on the floor.
Wordless, Castiel held out a hand, and without a word, Dean took it.
Dean rolled his eyes. So he wasn't all there yet.
The brothers embraced as Castiel looked on.
Dean sighed in frustration.
Circumspect, these days, because that was the requirement, and he could adapt.
Dean swallowed hard.
"I don't wear underwear, Dean," he snapped, irritable.
"Mind your language," said Tildy, and suddenly her mouth was filled with rows and rows of teeth.
“What the fuck for? No. Absolutely the fuck not,” said Dean.
“You want us to go alone?”
Dominant. Possessive.
A sense of the absolute washed through Dean like a wave.
Dean writhed on the bed, uncaring, as Castiel stood and watched.
Afterwards, they slept, in the cool soft winds off the sea, in the scent of night-blooming jasmine.
He crawled into his bed, and Castiel stared as he brushed his hands up his chest, mouth dropping open as he circled a nipple and pinched it between his fingers.
He felt his orgasm rise in him and he started babbling

Dean returned his smile, just as fond.
“Of course!” he said. “You're a legend! How often do you get to meet a legend, after all?"
“I have to admit,” said Sam, “seeing it up close…this is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences. I’m glad we came.”
When the night closed in again, Dean was ready.
“Tell me no, and I will stop,” whispered Cas.
“I’m workin’ on it.”
In the light of the streetlamp outside the motel window, Dean Winchester sat at the little table with paper and pen.
“He threatened you,” said Castiel, as if that was all the explanation necessary.
"If you'll admit it, then sure."
“Yeah?”
Suddenly, Dean was kissing him.
And she had called him a
"Well, yeah, man, I guess," said Dean. "It's just - don't get me wrong, Cas, I'm glad I made it up here. Hell, I'm fuckin'
“Well that’s too bad, sugar, because you ain’t my type. But if you put in a good word with either of these two, well…”

“Did you even leave last night?” asked Dean.
Sighing, he shut off the light and went back to bed.
He went to check the church and ensure there was no one awaiting his counsel, and then returned to the house with an eagerness that surprised even himself.
“Was that – are you all right?”
“I would never do that,” said Dean, as sure of this as he was sure of the fact that this was a table, that was a bed. “I would never abandon Sammy. Never put him in danger or make him sleep outside.”
Dean was lanced through with shame. It ate at every corner of his being. How
"I - tone it down, Sammy, I'm gettin' to it!" the Dean on the phone snapped.
"Now that's all well and good," said Colin. "But now who will take us in? We cannot go back to living in the forest like beasts."
Dean gaped at him.
“It’s a walkie-talkie,” Sam explained helpfully. “Ash made it. We can talk to Ellen this way, or anyone at the Roadhouse. I thought it might come in useful. Well. Ash did, anyway. I assumed it would be confiscated as contraband so I wanted to wait until I knew we were alone.”
A chance, before he had to hide this part of his heart again.
It rang, and rang, until there was a loud thump on his wall.
"Not this time," he said. "What you've given me is enough."
"Miss Kensington, for Mr. Winchester."
"Yeah? What're you gonna do about it?"
"Tell me what to do," said Dean. "I don't know."
“What my brother means,” said Sam, swooping in to save Dean from some almighty faux pas, “is thank you. What can we request?”

He’d heard of his brothers and sisters discovering an infatuation with one of the humans, but it was something he had never understood. The
"Michael," he said.
The brothers did everything together. They had been close growing up. Why they should behave differently as grown men - well, Castiel's expectations after Dean's experiences in the colonies had given him the right to hope.
and it was an incomplete truth, but it was enough.
“Sir?”
“Here, my life is…uncomplicated. I get satisfaction out of serving – that wasn’t a lie. And here…”
And then Dean got insolent.
"I'd advise you to move along," said Castiel evenly. "If you've come all this way scenting a human, know that this man is protected."
"Werewolf," said Dean, by way of explanation.

The moonlight blessed the palms and the garden was still paradise-beautiful, but the entire mood had shifted.
The journey back to Winchester Estate dropped in temperature as they went, as things cooled between the two of them like coming down from altitude.
"I'm not like other girls," Dean said, and laughed. "You remember, back in the day, when I said I'd rather be down there on Earth than a Stepford bitch in paradise?"
"I saw a lot of things in America," he said slowly. "Most things were incredible, just - new ways of being, I guess. But I also saw horrible things, the way some of 'em kill, all that matters is the other guy ain't the same, so, doesn't deserve to live."
Castiel's eyes shot open wide as he watched Dean from every available angle, debauched and perfect, hedonistic and wild.
“Okay,” said Dean. “Cas, are you sure?”
“Yeah.”
” said Dean.
"I miss
These are just a few recent observations from the road. I do hope things will improve. If we can work together, we can secure a better future.
But Dean still just could not let things stand.
And this from civilians.
I'd expected this one to go on a little longer, but here we are. :) Hope you are all staying safe and well.
“That’s too many damned pillows.”
I learned then that storytelling could save people, offer comfort in dire circumstances, be a companion where there was otherwise none.
“How?”
The door opened, and there stood Cas, in a warm blue sweater and loose fitting jeans, looking for all the world like comfort.
They kissed, then, and the sea was blue capped with white outside the window, where the palm trees swayed in that eternal spring.
No. And these two men were such contemporaries they died on the same day! Ask, then, about Lope de Vega, or other literary luminaries, and…same. Interesting, then, so do you like Shakespeare or you like feeling superior to others because you pretend to like Shakespeare?

Castiel stared at him.
Dean was exhausted.
to get approval from my parents, from my family. When they figured out I was gay, it was worse.
“That’s right. Now move.”
“You ever get the feeling this is just…I don’t know. Not enough? Too much?”
Sam gave him the look of a man who knows things he is reluctant to share.
And he gave Dean a significant look.
Dean's eyes were sad and resigned.
And because Dean did not have the appropriate words, he remained wordless.
“Dean?” whispered Castiel.
. This thing they were doing now was all a part of that  lifestyle.
Aloud, he said:

Castiel considered this possibility.
He knew this would happen, as he hadn’t shown at the night library for the first evening in centuries.
