Dean blushed, wiggling a bit shyly. "That was wonderful, Cas. Actually, I kind of want to do it again." He grinned.
Dean wiped his sweating hands on his trousers. "I didn't call my dad yesterday, Cas," he said, his voice panicky. "I didn't let him now I was staying over at yours."
Dean shrugged sheepishly, grabbing a menu and blindly staring into it, not being able to really concentrate. How was he supposed to pick a burger when he was opposite such an intimidating persona who wanted to talk to him? Talk about Dean of all things.
He started up Spotify, clicking on a random song and setting it on shuffle, before opening his browser. He decided to check his e-mail first.
After they’d adroitly exchanged the twins, each man ending up with a toddler settled on his hip, Dean tilted his head in the direction of the kitchen. “I have something to show you. Want to chat over a cuppa?”
Once the tour was over, both men settled in the living room, drinking tea and talking about anything and everything, covering topics from bee keeping to formal dinners and Dean's expectations of their potential life together.
“So,” Meg asked when Dean opened the door that morning, “are you ready to try again,
"Cassie talks about you a lot," a whisper next to his ear woke him up a bit.
“I’ll collect fub- er, I mean Gabe,” Charlie said, colouring up a little at her near faux pas.
Dean swallowed. "Yeah."
Castiel kissed him one more time before raising Dean’s legs up and over his shoulders and then slowly aligning himself with the younger man’s heat. They locked gazes as the alpha gave a firm, steady thrust, which pushed his blood-filled organ cleanly through the loose ring of muscles and deep into Dean. Stopping moving for a bit, Castiel watched his lover’s face for any sign of discomfort. When the omega just moaned and thrust his hips up against his mate, the alpha released a ragged breath and slid fully inside, settling his hips flush against Dean’s.
Charlie giggled. “You walked right into that one,” she told her friend.
“I’d better get going, or I’ll be late for the meeting.” Castiel leaned down and brushed his lips against Dean’s before straightening back up and striding toward the garage. He paused, looking back at the younger man, a twinkle now discernible in his blue eyes. “Keep the boys’ sticky fingers off of the scones,” he deadpanned. “Especially John’s.”
Gabe smirked at him but his eyes were soft. "My brother, Castiel, talks about you a lot."
“Um,” the omega confessed, “that was me. I talked it over with Meg. I just couldn’t stand everyone beating you up for helping out my dad,” he added passionately.
“I thought we could have dinner - just the two of us,” Dean responded, turning his head to smile softly at his mate. “Celebrate your birthday a little early.”
"I'm ready, Cas," Dean breathed into his lover's mouth hotly. "I am so ready."
“Let’s talk about it over lunch,” Dean suggested. “How does cheesy tortellini with tomatoes and basil sound?”
"How's the temperature?" he asked when he entered the room.
Dean came to a halt and stared at his lover. "Wha-" he squeaked out, "a car? What do you mean?"
Castiel frowned. "Maybe if I explained a little further or-"
It took all of Dean's self-control not to roll his eyes. "Because he's not interested in me," he said exasperatedly. "I didn't want you to get your hopes up."
What was the point of having a living room if it didn’t get lived in? he wondered as he fluffed the throw pillows at one end of the sofa. The senator obviously didn’t have children. Or if he did, they were probably banned from the living room.
Then again, he was getting a bit lost in the politics of it, thought Dean. He had never been interested in anything like that before and suddenly he was getting all this information and it was seriously muddling his brain. He felt as if he couldn't really trust his judgement; yet he reckoned he shouldn't just blindly trust Castiel's either.
The two men fell asleep snuggled in each other’s arms, both resting more deeply than they had in days.
Dean unlocked the front door, stepping into the small hallway and chucking his jacket on the hanger and toeing off his shoes violently, leaving them in the middle of the floor.
Dean frowned. "No? Then what have you..." he trailed off as he came to a realization. He recounted what he had been doing and immediately knew what Cas was talking about. "You were watching my butt as I was bending over," he stated matter-of-factly.
"Come in."
"Thanks for the lift," he said, smiling at Cas.
Dean stared at Cas' half erect manhood and felt his palms getting sweaty, his stomach clenching in anticipation and - curiously - his mouth watering. He reached out as if in trance, closing his hand loosely around the girth. It felt really soft to the touch and heavy in his hand, completely unlike what he thought it would feel.
The other man chuckled. “Eloquent as always Dean-o,” he quipped.
“You heard,” his father growled. “Get out.”
Castiel grabbed his hand to calm his jittery movements. "That's the whole point of trying new things, Dean. You don't have to be nervous; there's no right or wrong here. If you don't like the meal, you don't have to finish it; all I ask is that you try."
"Do you even
“You won’t believe it,” the omega warned him cheekily. “Bobby has given me the best present ever - he somehow managed to scour up a 1965 Chevy Impala! Isn’t it awesome?”
Castiel nodded. "Yes well, I understand if you feel uncomfortable now."
At Dean's curious look, Bobby rolled his eyes. "I don't have a tag saying Dean yet; I have to order it and you can slap it on then. Until then, welcome to Singer's Salvage Yard, Perry."
The smile lingered on Dean’s lips as he entered the kitchen area. Noah, he recalled, had crawled under the kitchen table that afternoon - Dean pretending he didn’t see him - while Aaron had somehow gotten past the child-proof lock on the cupboard under the kitchen sink and squeezed himself in next to the waste bin. Then he’d opened the container of Windex and glugged down some of the liquid. It was only when he started coughing that Dean and John had realised he was in there.
That made all three omegas snicker, and even Meg cracked a smile.
The teenager nodded. "You have a pretty house, Castiel."
"Don't mind her." Gabe waved her off. "Come with me; I want you to meet Cassie."
“No,” he assured his mate, a soft smile on his face as he gazed at the Castiel. “I mean,” he backtracked a little, “I wasn’t exactly thrilled at first, considering what Dad used to be like, and how it made it harder to find a job. I still don’t want to be pigeonholed into being a stay-at-home husband and father, who, like, cooks and cleans house all day. But” - he paused, barely keeping his sudsy fingers from going to his stomach - “I wouldn’t give up you or Noah or Aaron for anything.”
“Then it doesn’t matter if it’s drugs or booze - addictions are dangerous no matter what,” Gabe finished ominously.
Dean did as he was told, then watched as Gabriel measured out 300 grams of flour, 200 grams of regular sugar and two tablespoons of cocoa powder and poured it all in a big bowl together. He then gave Dean a couple sticks of cinnamon, some star anise, cloves and regular aniseed and told him to grind it all up.
He got Jo talking about her mother's joint called Roadhouse and about how she often helped her out behind the bar.
“Sure, if it’s that easy,” the omega teased in return. “You’ll work it off it no time whatsoever, chasing after my scamps.”
Up till now Dean had only been half listening, but that got his attention. “Work?” he croaked in a hoarse voice.
"Yeah, whatever. Do you want a bag or not?"
“Or we could just let the twins and Dad have at them,” Dean offered. A spark of his usual good humour returning, he smiled mischievously at his husband. “Or Sammy when he gets home from school.” His younger brother had a bottomless pit for a stomach, Dean reflected fondly. Sam could manage the platter of scones all by himself.
The man looked so pathetic that Dean shot a concerned glance at his mate, mouthing, “Drunk?”
Dean nodded. "A big job. Sure you want me on it?"
“Plenty of time,” John grunted. “We can introduce my grandsons to the fine art of automobile restoration.”
“Okay,” he mumbled, pleased.
Rushing into their bedroom, Dean shook Castiel awake, spluttering an explanation of what was going on. He couldn’t remember John ever being so out of control before, which had him almost as terrified as Sammy.
Castiel slid his finger over the side of his glass, obviously feeling uncomfortable. "I don't identify as an omegaist because I don't want to have to live up to certain expectations or assumptions. I- uh, I understand it's hard to understand-"
Dean had to admit he still had trouble grasping how being tight-fisted was a good idea in Cas’ opinion. People needed money, so why not give it to them? He pulled up a few Internet links leading to economic articles to add to his list - maybe he would finally understand what that ‘economic bubble’ was that Cas always kept talking about in the press, the concept of which had evaded him so far.
"You are welcome to call me Castiel then, Bobby," said Cas and maybe Dean was wrong. Maybe he did realize the privilege he had been offered because his voice sounded almost awed, though still professional.
"Yes. That," he said petulantly, a bit peeved he didn't manage to say the word himself.
Cas’ eyebrows rose in surprise. “I hope it’s not going to cause you problems with John,” he murmured. “I wouldn’t want to make things even more difficult for you.”
Gabe evidently had a similar thought, mouthing around a large bite of pastry, “But
"And there was this couple sitting right in front of me, some neighbourhood kids. An alpha guy and an omega girl, obviously dating but not mated."
He brought the laptop and set it on the coffee table, opening up Spotify and choosing a playlist he had added the previous evening. One of the people on the site had talked about an American omega band that played songs that were mostly meant to empower omegas.
Charlie finished setting up the movie and went to the kitchen only to return with an outrageous amount of crisps. "So," she started, "I have simple salted ones, then barbecue, salt and vinegar, shrimp cocktail, onion and sour cream, paprika, and some cheese puff balls or whatever."
His youngest obviously needed a bit more reassurance, Dean thought, his heart twisting. “It’s okay,” he told the boy, smiling softly at him.
Cas gave him a disbelieving look. "Is this about what your father said the other day?"
"Yeah," whispered Dean, never meeting Cas' eyes in favour of staring down. He moved his hand again and watched the length twitch. This was brilliant, he thought, sliding his hand the opposite direction now. And again. And again until he was stroking Castiel in a regular rhythm.
Dean found himself grinning at the other man and he felt the rest of his nervousness leave his body.
Charlie grinned. "Sure, though you really don't have to worry. Senator is a good guy."
"How are you?"
He arrived at the brownstone half an hour later and found Castiel’s wingtips in the hallway. The omega grinned as he realised his mate was home. “Cas?” he called out.
Meg had just pulled out various photographs, spreading them out on the table and suggesting, “Shall we start with the movers and shakers that you’ll need to be able to recognise?”
"I really like your car, Cas," he said as he ran his hand along the glove box.
The omega added ‘learn tennis’ to his list.
Benny snorted. "That's not fun, that's sad. Besides, aren't you a bit young to drink like that?"
Once both of them had got up, Charlie hugged Dean, gently brushing at the dark circle under his right eye with her thumb. “Dean-cess,” she started tentatively, “do you think the only reason you’re so tired is because of stress from
Castiel growled, unused to his mate talking dirty. “Are you, sweetheart?” he teased, hands slipping underneath the waistband of Dean’s trousers. “Let’s do something about it then.”
"Thank you."
"Yeah, well, we had dinner together."
Or the relationship with Lisa. Dean figured that was quite an important part of his life since she was his first and only relationship but how did that influence him? The only thing he could think of was that he was no longer a virgin.
He was met with a stocky guy in a expensive-looking suit and a self-satisfied smirk on his face. "Hello," he said in a posh English accent, "my name is Crowley, the manager of Hell's Autoshop. Sit down, boy."
Bobby still looked dubious but he nodded. "Well go on then; text your boyfriend and then get back to work. There are three oil changes waiting for you in the back and if you finish before two, you can help me with replacing a clutch on that Beamer over there," he told him, pointing towards a nice BMW.
“Yeah, that’s what my partner said,” Dean replied.
"Sorry? I thought you were lying in a ditch somewhere, Dean! What the hell were you doing the whole night that you couldn't have texted me? One measly little text, Dean!"
"Where the hell have you been, boy?" he growled out, pulling Dean inside by his arm and slamming the door closed behind them.
Castiel looked at Dean intently. "About you, for example. How are you doing at your new job? Are you enjoying it?"
I hope life's treating you well. I heard from Charlie that you got the job you wanted, so CONGRATS!!! We need to celebrate that. Now what I'm writing to you about (other than reminding you of my awesome existence), my big bad brother asked me about you and wondered if you'd be willing to meet up with him sometime. To be serious, I think his intentions are anything but pure - Cassie probably wants to make sure you vote for him the next time there's an election, you should never trust politicians!
, Dean fumed to himself. He was a grown up man, a skilled mechanic that could support himself - and Sammy - if need be. He was glad his brother was over at a friend’s and wasn’t there to see this woman treat him so condescendingly.
, when the song abruptly ended. Before he could start complaining, a male voice informed him they were interrupting the program because they had received some very alarming and sad news.
Dean shook his head, sliding from underneath the car and gong over to the motor oil canisters, choosing the appropriate one after double-checking the brand. "Not really; he didn't even meet him."
“I guess.” Dean nodded in acknowledgment.
taking his breath away. He took in a shuddery gasp of air, filling his air-deprived lungs.
"I need you to take a picture of me."
"It's not my money to give out, Dad!" insisted the omega, frustrated at his father's attempts to guilt-trip him, "I'll buy Sammy whatever he needs for school - using my own money - but that's all you're getting."
Castiel had stayed home since then, trying to cajole him into getting up, repeatedly telling him it wasn’t his fault - that Dean had been exonerated. Dean didn’t believe his husband though. Who else was responsible, if not him?
John calls the twins “die kleinen Käfer” which means “the little beetles.” Käfer is also the German nickname for a Volkswagen Beetle. “Käferli” is a diminutive for Käfer.
"Hmm?" hummed the alpha against his skin, causing Dean to forget his line of thought as he moaned. It would have been so embarrassing had Castiel not immediately followed him with a moan of his own.
Castiel seemed taken aback for a second, before a small smile spread on his face. "I suppose I will have to watch the films then."
Dean nodded again.
He got an 'OK' and a smiley face in return. A fricking smiley face.
He did encounter a few websites that seemed to genuinely try to help but Dean discovered they weren't very helpful. There was one site that looked kind of promising though, so Dean started reading.
Dean swallowed his mouthful. "I know that, but he's a politician. He's expected to have a serious relationship and if it's serious, there's no reason not to mate. It's because of his image or something... Gabe told me."
Dean pulled a box of PG Tips out of the cupboard, raising his eyebrows in question.
Castiel leaned over to him, pecking his lips again. "You're welcome, Dean."
Good thing he didn't want children then. Crying and pooping babies, snotty toddlers or obnoxious teenagers. Little people who would come to him with every little thing because they couldn't deal with it themselves. Small, dependent human beings he wouldn't know the first thing about caring for. He had never felt the stirring in his heart that Lisa had always talked about. Never felt any sort of parental instinct that would insinuate he was going to be a good father.
God, Dean loved this playful side of his mate. He leaned back against Cas, ready to jump him then and there, but then his stomach let out a loud rumble.
“Of course, Dad,” Dean reassured him, hope spreading through him. “Sammy’s always welcome at our house.” The omega realized he was proud to call John ‘Dad’ for the first time in years.
Gabe rolled his eyes. “Have you ever seen a Nutella you could
Castiel gave him a wry smile. "Of course, if you find something I haven't tried."
“Yeah,” Charlie agreed, sidling over till she was next to Dean. She wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulders and leaned her head against his, one of her red curls tickling his cheek. “You can’t do that from in here, Dean-cess.”
Dean gritted his teeth. “Of course not!” he protested, “Why are you always asking me that? Cas isn’t like that; he’s not some knot-headed alpha.”
“Hello, Sam. Hello, Sweetheart,” the senator said, a smile on his face. “What are you doing?” he asked as he walked over, dropping a kiss on Dean’s head.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” the twins insisted, their voices overlapping so that it became nearly impossible to distinguish one from the other. “Horsey, Gumpy!”
"It means that I admire you, Dean."
“Yeah, okay,” Dean mumbled, rather embarrassed by the praise. He felt like he should’ve done more to help his dad, even though he had no clue what that could’ve been.
Dean felt a bit suspicious. A powerful alpha was asking to see him with not many people around; this was raising all the red flags John had planted in his head. "What do you want to talk about?" he asked after a while, noticing people slowly losing interest in their conversation since it didn't seem like they were going to discuss anything interesting, and he couldn't help but feel a bit relieved at that.
Dean almost rolled his eyes. Seriously, could Castiel be any more romantic?
His dad shook his head. "I don't get it. Is there something wrong with him then? He can't get it up or something?"
idea? Momentarily distracted from his woes, Dean could only stare at the brunette in shock. The flags of colour in her cheeks drawing his attention, he barely noticed that she’d changed her hair from shoulder-length tresses to a short, pixieish cut which really suited her features.
Of course not, Dean. I thought about your arguments and found them valid.
Dean shrugged. "That I would try to see him as often as possible."
Dean smiled back as he transferred the soup to a couple of containers to freeze and checked the dishes for food that needed scraping off before loading them into the dishwasher.
Dean looked at his feet. "Oh."
Dean tried to think back to what had happened. It was hard to remember the specifics when he’d been so frantic about Aaron. “Um, I’m not sure,” he hesitantly replied after a few minutes. “The nurse at the ER reception desk could’ve, though; she was really suspicious, especially when she saw that I’d brought Aaron in two other times. A couple detectives did show up while I was waiting to talk to the doctor and find out how Aaron was.”
Dean jumped straight at the opportunity to show off. "I'll do it, no problem. I used to build fires in our backyard all the time. Dad always said I was very good at it, well until I had to go and-" he cut himself off. "Never mind."
Benny nodded, still smiling. "I know what you want to ask. What's a beta doing fighting for omega rights? Let me tell you something, brother, betas might not have it as bad as omegas but we're certainly not on equal footing with alphas. Not by a long shot. A beta could never become a President for example."
“Trade you,” John suggested, as Noah imitated his brother’s actions, reaching out and burbling, “Dadada.”
The other man sighed theatrically. "Haven't found a prince charming to have them with yet."
Dean was still flabbergasted. “What? You mean I can work on her?”
Dean let the spoon clatter onto the counter, hurrying over to his mate and gripping his biceps. “I’m so sorry, Cas, I never meant to cause you so much trouble.”
"Dean-"
“Yeah, you’ve kinda grown on me,” Dean admitted, smiling conspiratorily at the woman as he pulled out the PG Tips.
The first sound he heard was a loud, raspy noise coming from somewhere to his left and after turning his head, Dean identified the source as Jo, who was lying on her back, her arms thrown above her head and her mouth open in a loud chainsaw-like snore.
Castiel made love to his fingers and then the palm of his hand, before kissing his way back up Dean’s arm.
"Probably, yes."
He’d done that ever since he could remember anyway, since his mother was dead and they didn't have money for a maid, but he used to go out with his friends after school and just hang out.
Dean raised his eyebrows, setting the tea on Sam's bedside table. "Really? Show me the thermometer."
Bobby stood up, pretending his knees didn't creak. "Well, I can't tell you what to do, boy, but I can tell you what not to do. Don't do anything just because your dad wants you to or just because you feel you have to do it."
“Erm, it’s gonna be a while before Santa gets here,” Gabe informed the twins.
“How about making us a cup of that cardamom-cinnamon tea you like?” Castiel requested. “I’ll get changed and then we can curl up in bed with a cuppa.”
The politician shrugged again. "They wouldn't have been wrong."
photo, though he wasn't sure what reason he wanted to use yet.
He could see him getting angry again though. "Then how are you not mated? What did you do, Dean? Did you mouth off at him or something?"
"What do I do then?"
Dean had scrutinized the pictures, trying to figure out if they were good people before settling on having to find out later.
Blenching, he gasped, “They can’t, can they?”
Castiel dabbed at his lips with a serviette. "In theory, nothing. But our country doesn't have the money to do that, Dean, not without substantially raising the taxes.
His father walked past him, heading for the pot of freshly brewed coffee Dean had made, and tousled his son's hair. "Don't worry about it; omegas sulk sometimes. It's all the hormones, I think."
“Sure,” Cas agreed, “we can do that.” Looking at Dean, he suggested, “Why don’t you pack a bag for your dad, sweetheart?”
Blue eyes fixed on Dean, Castiel let go as well, knotting deep inside his mate’s body.
“Dean-cess is practically still a teen,” came an impish remark.
Castiel sipped on his drink before clearing his throat. "Nothing is ever free, Dean. You have to pay for your own health care in one way or another; what differs is the effectiveness of money redistribution. With the system now, you have to pay your own health insurance if you want the insurance company to pay for certain surgeries or treatments, and the hospitals themselves are subsidized by the government from the taxpayers’ money."
Dean grinned at the girl's enthusiasm. It really
Still, it was good to know that there were couples out there that were equals - well, Becky seemed to have the upper hand actually.
I was just doing the same thing. What exactly were you thinking about?
"Not that I know of." Dean shrugged before narrowing his eyes at Cas. "
would probably be imprinted on his retinas forever.
Dean folded his arms over his chest. "No, I'm not listening to this."
"He must hate me," he sighed in between heavy hiccups.
He had talked to various people from an overly enthusiastic omega called Becky to a shy and reserved beta, Chuck, and a if-looks-could-kill serious alpha Rufus. He chatted with Kevin, an omega his age, and played darts with a different omega whose name he couldn't remember.
"Nothing," said his boss with an exasperated look on his face, "You sure you know what you're doing with that man?"
The alpha let his lover go, watching him step back to the cooker and stir whatever he was cooking. “Should we do some research then? I can have a look at which facilities in our vicinity have the highest success rates,” he offered.
“Bobby wasn’t thrilled,” the omega disclosed, “but he didn’t protest all that much either. It’d do him good to see that you’ve changed, and to realize there are other decent alphas besides Castiel.”
"Whatever."
Charlie slid closer to him on the bed, folding her hands in her lap, his own hand still clutched in her fingers. "If he wants to give omegas equal benefits, he has to lower the alpha ones."
"Oh," Dean said in realization. Castiel wasn't uncomfortable; he was aroused. He leaned forward, kissing the other man forcefully, feeling a bit more brave after the unfinished hand job.
The little boy looked puzzled at the last word. “Unless they say you can,” John clarified.
“You really don’t think I could have stopped Aaron?” Dean searched the beloved face that was just inches from his own.
"Dad!" he cried out scandalised before shrugging his left shoulder. "He probably has omegas throwing themselves at him all the time anyway. Not like he needs me to do the same."
Dean showed him the ballot paper he had received in the post before walking over to the privacy cubicle to mark his vote. He made a cross in the square next to the word 'yes' and put his ballot back into the envelope.
"Cas?" he breathed out.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows in thought. "What are you having?"
“You were sitting right here in the kitchen,” his husband reminded him. “Noah distracted you-”
His dad had put the twins down for a nap, and then he and Bobby decamped to the living room to watch an episode of
"No," said Dean too quickly. "I mean, yes. It is."
"Hi," he said, a little breathless.
Dean shrugged in answer.
Dean shrugged. "It's going well. We were actually just talking about mating," he said, which was technically not a lie.
“Yes,” the mechanic replied, trying to appear confident, “I’m interested in those blue boy shorts in the window. Do you have them in a size medium?”
The redhead frowned in concentration. “I dunno exactly when. Fifteenth century? Sixteenth?”
"Damn," sighed Dean, "that makes sense."
There was silence on the other end at first, then John’s soft voice pleaded, “Please, don’t hang up, Dean.”
Dean sent the mail before he could start doubting himself. He was nervous about the meeting despite making sure it happened in a public place, but it wasn't likely Castiel was going to try anything since he was a publicly recognized person.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the politician. "Do you mean to tell me you've tasted everything there is to taste?"
Cas didn’t remark on his weakened state. Instead he simply offered an arm that Dean could use to brace himself against and rise to his feet. Castiel then wrapped a robe around the younger man’s pajama-clad body and guided Dean out of the bedroom.
"Dean," mumbled Cas against his mouth, hands tugging slightly at his hair.
Castiel smiled softly. "It's all right, Dean. This is probably useless anyway; my hair is impossible."
Castiel smiled indulgingly. "They're predators, Dean; I wouldn't call them cute."
"We have Pilsen, Radegast, Budweiser, Gambrinus and Kozel."
Dean who stood a few metres away from her looked out of the window. "Charlie," he admonished her, "we can't go out."
"You mean dating?" asked Sammy with an eager smile.
Dean nodded. "I know, everyone keeps telling me. I don't know the guy though."
Dean was jittery with nervous excitement that morning, two weeks after he and Meg had succeeded in changing the rumors about Senator Novak and his omega mate. Castiel was still something of a hero for helping out his downtrodden father-in-law.
“It’s the
"Hello, Dean." Castiel greeted him with a grin and a kiss on a cheek. "Are you ready?"
Castiel chuckled and did it again, before sliding another finger in. This one Dean could feel a bit more that the first two, since he was clenching his inner muscles around the fingers.
Castiel stared at him. "Why would I- Dean," he said, his voice astonished, "you are a very intelligent young man and I happen to like talking to you. Not every alpha sees omegas as sex objects; I thought we had established that."
John waved him off. "What are you babbling about? Of course this changes things! Our days of living hand-to-mouth are over. Now that you're the senator's wife, he'll take care of us." He paused for a beat to consider things, before continuing more quietly, "Just so you know, I am very grateful to you, Dean. I was wrong to assume you couldn't take care of this family."
happened but it needs changing."
Sam coughed again. "I don't know, Dean. It seems harmless."
Dean quickly snapped out of it. "Yeah, sorry. Got lost in thought."
Dean didn't even have to think about it. The newest toothpaste commercial was everywhere. It showed a pretty young omega man brushing his teeth before going to the bedroom to his alpha mate and kissing a path down his chest. When he got to the belly button, the video cut to a black screen with the words,
was in poor condition and would require a great deal of careful restoration work before it would run again, but this was exactly what he wanted to give Sammy for his eighteenth birthday.
Dean took offence to that. "Look at them, Cas. This one has like twenty legs; it looks like a sun. Oh and that one over there is orange and blue."
Charlie pressed her lips together in a tight line. "Have you texted
“You’re a walking stomach, I swear.” Charlie shook her head in fond exasperation.
“Huh,” Sam grunted.
Dean smiled but didn't otherwise comment. He hadn’t really expected to see Castiel so soon and he had to admit he was a bit apprehensive about talking to him again. What if he mentioned John writing to him? What if he told him he could never be interested in someone like Dean? What if he didn't want to talk to Dean at all?
And that was such a far cry from the usual 'call me baby' that Dean was left speechless for a moment.
Dean gave Castiel an apologetic smile. "I have to go."
Dean paused, hesitating. “Yeah, uh… like I said, I’ll be right back.”
Dean smiled, resting his hand on Cas' thigh as they pulled out of the parking lot. "I'm more than all right, Cas. I feel... warm," he finished with a grin.
Castiel sighed. "Not yet, no. That is a, ehm, a hole in the law."
"And you didn't get the job, I heard."
He had also noticed an announcement saying the omega movement managed to push a draft bill stating mated omegas could vote differently from their mates, something Dean wouldn't have been able to even imagine before he read it. He didn't understand why an omega would want to vote differently from his mate but he could admit it was good to have the opportunity.
Dean tried not to blush. "So? I wanted to know if you were threatening Cas or something."
It was this line of thought that gave Dean the bottle to send his next text.
"You do that, sweetheart."
Dean entered the house, and forcing himself not to be bothered by what just happened, he flopped down on the couch, settling in front of the television. He was sure Dad blamed him for the fact Castiel wasn't interested in him. He didn't say it or even imply it, mind you, but Dean knew his dad well and he knew how his mind worked. In his head, he thought that had Dean presented himself better, he would've caught the senator's interest. He wasn't going to change for anybody though, he swore to himself.
Castiel still seemed hesitant. "You do realize that if we want it to take, we are going to have to actually have penetrative-"
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean grinned. Cas did it, he thought triumphantly as whoops of celebration filtered in from the living room. He actually did it! His celebration was interrupted by the clatter of the pregnancy test as it fell to the floor, causing the omega to look down.
It was several long and pleasurable seconds later that Dean came back to himself from the haze of lust and arousal he had been drowning in. Castiel was mouthing at Dean's non-existent abs and Dean's level of anxiety abruptly spiked.
“I’m gonna get clean and stay clean,” John earnestly vowed.
"I did," Dean told him, equally as slow. He had no idea where this was going. It was as if his dad was drunk and couldn't properly receive information but Dean couldn't smell any booze on his breath.
Dean snorted. "I'm not ashamed of having money; that's ridiculous."
"Do what?" asked Castiel with a tilt of his head, and the gesture was so familiar that Dean felt much better at seeing it.
"It's just that-" Dean interrupted himself with a grunt, "he wants me to mate someone rich so we get out of our money trouble and he found out that I know someone like that. I think he wants to try and set us up somehow but I know the person is just going to bolt and I don't want that."
He went to sleep a lot later than he was used to, his head hitting the pillow way past eleven o'clock, still thinking about all the new information he had read about. He even started thinking of taking his own
Castiel smiled at him. "Well, we can just continue the kissing if you want."
Dean raised his eyebrows. “So you diddled him.”
His boss shook his head fondly. "You did enough, boy. You should take a break."
Dean nodded, quickly striding over to the bathroom and pulling out a bottle of Paracetamol from their medicine cabinet. He brought it over to Sammy's bed along with a glass filled with water and made him swallow it.
Castiel finally met Dean's eyes and seeing the uncertainty there, he hastened to clarify, "You don't have to worry, Dean; I have several guest rooms in case you decide to spend the night. Nothing untoward is going to happen."
Dean almost pouted. "You asked me what was wrong; not like I wanted to talk about it."
"Not necessarily; have you ever heard of second and even third hand smoking?"
All right, so this turned out a bit weird. I hope you still like the chapter though :)
"Good," rasped Cas, staring at Dean intently.
Benny raised his eyebrows. "No dipping for you, Shortstuff; you're just going to drown with how much you're planning to drink."
Dean glanced up from the pan he was stirring on the stove in surprise when he heard Castiel declare sharply, “No, he does
Castiel looked at his watch - an expensive looking watch, Dean noticed and immediately felt ashamed for even thinking about it - and nodded. He flagged down the waitress, paid for their food before Dean even realized what was happening and then stood up.
Sighing heavily, Dean glanced at his childhood home one last time, before making his way to the bus stop. It was time to go
The redhead, and Dean should really try to remember her name, heaved a tired sigh. “Commiserations, more like,” she remarked. “We have four of our own and they’re little devils. All they do is scream at each other and pull their hair.”
Dean bristled at that. "Dad, I told you I didn't want kids."
Charlie beamed. "Right? It's gonna be kickass."
But those were all things other people thought about him; that didn't mean it was true. For example, he didn't think he was weak and he definitely wasn't a breeding machine - he didn't want to have children.
"Not really. I mean, there were some people but no one was interested." The fact that he himself wasn't really interested, not at all, was left unmentioned.
Dean huffed out a laugh. Even if he were really hungry, he couldn’t possibly eat all of those. As it was, the thought of food made his stomach rebel - he’d eaten hardly anything in days - but he might be able to keep the tea down.
of the toxic substances children in that age range have been known to ingest. The statistics bear out that a much higher percentage of small children swallow whatever they can get their hands on.”
"You're going to stay with me, right?" he asked Charlie who had followed him back to the blanket.
When he went downstairs again several hours later, two bags of clothes in hand and his notebook case over his shoulder, he didn't see his father anywhere. He let out a sigh of relief at not having to go through yet another confrontation, but felt uneasy nonetheless. John being out of the house during the happy hour was never a good thing.
Castiel shook his head, stepping closer and taking Dean's hands in his own bigger ones. "Nothing to apologize for," he said breathlessly. "That was very pleasant. Maybe too pleasant."
Castiel grinned predatorily, pushing Dean back to lie on the couch. “Good,” he rasped out before pouncing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was thinking about the light blue...” the omega responded slowly, unaware that he was licking his lips as he studied the array of available colors.
Dean shrugged. “Whatever.”
"People don't like to hear this but we do need to manage our money carefully and think about the future; we can't just keep giving to everyone who outstretches their hand."
“Thank God,” Dean mumbled, his concern transforming into anger now that he knew his dad would be okay. “You bastard,” he muttered.
“What do you care? John is your father.”
“Both,” his brother answered honestly. “I never realized till you were gone how much crap you dealt with from Dad, without me ever knowing it was happening.”
About halfway there, Castiel seemed to become abnormally nervous.
Sammy nodded, rubbing his sniffly nose on his shirt sleeve, making Dean laugh and shake his head at the boy’s manners. Of course, he mused, it wasn’t like he’d never done the same thing at Bobby’s garage.
John lumbered into the room after the twins, Bobby right behind him.
“Quite a change, eh?” Meg noted as she followed the omega to the kitchen.
lift your head up and listen to the truth,
He immediately regretted the cheesy heart at the end but couldn't do anything about an already sent text. Well, Castiel would just have to get over it.
“‘’kay,” the two-year-old readily agreed, his sullen expression easing.
Sam closed the book, laying it carefully on his bedside table. "What's up?"
Dean choked on his words, as the hot feeling of embarrassment spread through his chest, his lungs suddenly deprived of air. "Dad, that's... that's... I can't believe you said that."
"I don't want you to feel pressured," said Castiel, and hell if that didn't make Dean feel more pressured than before.
He almost rolled his eyes. "I don't have one."
Relieved at the mood lightening, Dean teased, “You never know. That might be Sammy.”
"You should talk to him, Dean."
Dean huffed out a breath at the feeling. "It's great, Cas. God, it's-"
Dean shrugged in a typical mardy teenager fashion. “I bollocksed it up, didn’t I? I went in with the tact of an elephant and it went only downhill from there. I should’ve waited for you to come with me.”
"But there's potential?" asked John, a glint in his eye.
Dean struggled to breathe, so he didn't answer.
“Nngh.” Dean rolled his head from side to side. “Not until you’re inside me. Please.”
This chapter has been co-authored by eureka1, which is the reason it got done much more quickly than has become normal. Please, send some love her way if you still like this story and remain faithful :D
Dean nodded and immediately felt his T-shirt sliding up his torso and over his head. He tried to do the same thing to Castiel but quickly realized that a buttoned-up shirt would be much harder to take off.
“Right?” Dean concurred. “They’ve got two calendars up in their room now. One to mark off the days till their birthday and the other to mark off the days till Christmas. Neither one of them is happy about how long it is till Father Christmas will come, but Dad pacified the boys by reminding them that they’ll get pressies for their birthday.”
Dean cleared his throat, cursing his swollen throat for how whiny it made him sound. "He asked him for money, Charlie. Just like that. A man he has never met before and he asks him for money."
“Gumpy,” Aaron carrolled, bringing Dean back to the present before he started brooding about the ongoing injustice toward omegas. The little boy wiggled in the omega’s grasp as he stretched pudgy arms toward his grandfather.
“God, yes.” Dean moaned in pleasure as Cas pushed inside, all thoughts of anything except this moment vanishing.
Dean was about to answer, when his phone started buzzing in his pocket. “Uh, oh, sorry,” he mumbled, patting his pockets to try and locate the device. When he finally pulled it out and looked at the screen, his already unhappy mood worsened. The word
He was standing at the cooker, checking the soup, when he heard the distinctive purr of Castiel’s Lincoln Town car, so he turned the oven on to heat the garlic bread. Less than a minute passed before strong arms encircled him from behind, and Cas looked over his shoulder. He inhaled deeply, clearly savouring the scents that perfumed the air, before husking, “What’s all this?”
A white-haired old lady glared at him, admonishing, “Watch your tongue, young man!”
"Well, come in so you don't freeze," said John suddenly, waving Dean inside.
Dean took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. "All right, I'll have the duck then," he said finally, smiling at Cas hesitantly. He felt bad about the whole situation, going off at Cas like that just because he was an insecure brat.
"But I don't like cheese platters; you know that Dean," whined the boy quietly.
"But I don't know, Cas! I don't know what any of those things taste like."
Dean wiggled again, prompting another pat. "You don't think it would just be rubbing the salt in? You know, seeing this house and everything?"
Dean smiled a slightly wobbly smile. "Sure."
“Well,” Gabriel waffled, brushing the boy’s overlong hair back from his forehead, “it couldn’t hurt to practise being good.”
"Then zip it and go on; it's not going to replace itself."
Noah raised his head, his tears vanishing in an instant. Ignoring the last bit, spelled words holding no interest for a two-year-old, he asked, “Santa? Where Santa?”
Dean looked down at her, giving up on catching a glimpse of the senator for the moment. "You don't like him?"
Masters’ expression didn’t actually change, but Dean was certain she was smirking.
A second later, the newspaper fell out of Gabe’s hands and onto the table, a chunk of the sugary sweet the older man had just bitten off landing on top of the newsprint. “What? How can they say that?” he exclaimed, his voice thrumming with anger.
Dean grinned at his friend, amused as usual when that nickname was mentioned.
“Well…” Dean grinned as he finally succeeded in setting the correct time on the microwave. “I may have bribed them with
"Okay?" whispered Cas.
"I'm, uh, I'm Dean," he introduced himself with an outstretched hand.
Charlie smiled. "This is my better half Gilda. Gilda, these are my friends, Jo, Benny, Dean, Gabe and his brother Castiel."
The older man grinned. "Yeah."
As he was sitting there staring at his computer and contemplating his inability to even think about feelings, let alone talk about them, his phone chirped. He looked at the little display and grinned to himself.
Gabe loosened his arms around Dean's chest but didn't let go of him. "I'm so proud of you for getting a job, lil bro."
Dean knew she was really only trying to make the sale, but he couldn’t help but feel her idea had merit. What the heck, he decided, she was right, and Castiel would definitely appreciate both colours.
After a few minutes of searching, Dean finally came upon a more promising part of the Internet. There were articles from omegaists about what it was like to be mated and how their lives had changed. Skipping a few horror scenarios about omegas having to give up on the omegaist movement because of their alpha, Dean clicked on a very short article from someone called Becky.
"Shhh!" Charlie shushed them. "This is the good bit, you yentas!"
John gave the Hot Wheels car a push, sending it racing across the table toward Dean, who stopped it with a finger against the hood. “How would you feel about restoring one of these?” the omega asked.
Dean shook his head in disbelief, pouring himself another cup and dousing it with sugar, while Meg pulled out her Blackberry and began tapping at it.
still a kid.” It made him happy that his brother was enjoying the last of his childhood, with no pressure about how he’d presented. “I think he’s almost as excited about building a fort in the living room as Noah and Aaron,” he told Castiel. “He and John were having a debate about who was going to man the Weber barbecue as they drove off, the twins chanting, ‘Hotta dog, hotta dog.’”
"What was that?" asked Cas.
Gabe popped a caramel in his mouth. "Yeah. Why?"
Dean bit his lip. He would feel emotional? He already felt emotional; he didn't need more of that! However the image of Cas holding him close, whispering nice things to him was comforting. It might not be too bad; he would just tell Cas he loved him before rolling over and falling asleep, right? No big deal.
Dean decided not to waste his breath on talking and instead pressed their lips together again. Cas must've licked his lips at some point, because Dean could feel moist lips against his mouth.
“Not normally, no. But the detectives were remiss in not offering you a copy, so there you go.” She smirked. “Besides, Victor owes me one.” She paused for a moment. “Or five.”
Gabriel paused and Dean nodded again.
The alpha looked up at him. “Budge up then,” he instructed in a hushed voice.
As Dean sat on the bus, having been freed a seat by a middle-aged beta, he thought about how unfair his life was. Why was his sex so important? He understood that omegas were naturally nurturing and usually wanted a big family with many children, but that didn't mean that every single omega was the same. His high school girlfriend Lisa who had presented omega when she was fourteen, a whole year before Dean himself went into his first heat, had been a very delicate and caring person and wanted a whole bunch of kids. That was also the reason she broke up with him right after he presented, as omegas couldn't impregnate anyone and Lisa hadn't wanted to waste time with him while there were perfectly fertile betas and alphas on the school's football team.
"But you are so young, sweetheart-"
"I'll have a glass then," said Dean and watched as the waitress wrote it down before turning around and leaving them to choose their meals.
They fell into an uncomfortable silence, the older omega brooding and Dean unsure how to comfort him. “Um, what now?” Dean asked hesitantly when he had the spices ground to a fine powder.
Dean shuddered, tightening his hand on Cas' thick bicep. "I did nothing but think about it for days, Cas. I want you. I want to be your mate and I want you to be mine."
Castiel leaned forward. "Dean, I don't want you to think that what your father says or does has any influence on the two of us. We're all right."
He arrived at the restaurant with minutes to spare but Castiel was already seated at a table. He walked over to him, starting when Castiel stood up to welcome him.
With a deep sigh, he turned away from the couch, proposing to Cas, “I’ll write a note telling my dad that Sammy’s with us. Would you mind calling Sam in here so he can pack a bag?”
Bobby smirked. "What, you want more? I would've thought you had enough."
"Fuck off, I was sipping whiskey with breast milk."
Bobby, his face flushed with misery, added, “We weren’t blaming the kids, though. If only I hadn’t left that can of g-a-s-o-l-i-n-e out.” He hung his head in shame, clearly unable to look Dean in the eye.
"And yes I know it's also Harry Potter’s birthday today, but I was here first!"
Cas sighed. "She's thinking no such thing, Dean. You were polite. She was professional, and you ordered a drink that you'll most likely like. What's the problem?"
Gabriel pouted. "Well that's a deal breaker, sweet boy."
Dean settled back into the couch and returned his eyes to the telly, feeling conflicted about what he had learned. On one hand, he was glad to know Cas talked about him; on the other hand though, he felt a little bit like he'd betrayed him. Like he shouldn't know what Cas was thinking unless the man actually told him. Wasn't that what communication in relationships was all about? Telling each other things? How they felt?
“I think it’s that whole religious schism thing,” Charlie commented, speaking quietly so as not to disturb Meg, who was just saying, “Lieutenant Henriksen, good morning.”
"What?" asked Dean, rubbing at his cheeks to get rid of the salty mess his crying fit had left behind.
The nineteen-year-old shrugged. "I wasn't sulking."
The political coach sighed as she slid a slim cell phone out of her pocket. “I’ll just give the precinct a ring,” she announced as she pressed a couple of keys on the smartphone.
“Sounds good,” John replied. “I could do with a jolt of caffeine.”
The alpha chuckled again. “Do they know they won’t be getting chocolate cake?”
Dean then checked his mail, finding messages from both Charlie and Gabriel. Gabe's e-mail was very enthusiastic again, asking about Dean's dinner with Castiel and about how he was doing at the new job. Dean replied in positive terms to both questions, assuring his BBOF everything was all right.
He came to a lot later, his legs loosely wrapped around Castiel's hips and his mouth wide open, still breathing heavily. "Ungh," he told his lover.
"Dean," started Castiel patiently, "imagine how many people go to the doctor even though they don't need to. They get a cold or a bump on their head and they go to the clinic to have a chat. These people will think twice before they go to the doctor if they have to pay, which will leave more time for the real patients. Patients who need help and who won't have to wait for hours in the waiting rooms anymore."
Dean tried not to think about the times he’d come home from having just been with Lisa and believed that John was clueless about his little affair. Apparently not.
The man opposite him hummed quietly. "How old are you again?"
“They do make sure I get plenty of exercise. I swear I haven’t been this fit since my army days,” he declared with a chuckle, confirming his son’s surmise.
Dean walked further in, noticing he could see into a large living room through an open archway to his left and a tastefully decorated dining room on his right. He turned to Castiel. "Do you actually have any doors that close?"
"Sammy?" he called as he knocked.
"No, no," Dean stuttered out. "I mean, I'm not looking for a relationship or anything but it's not, uh, unwelcome."
Once they entered the building, dark fell over them. The only things in the room that really shone any were these small labels underneath the water tanks that contained information about the animals inside. Dean found himself glad that Castiel was holding his hand.
Then again, Dean mused, warmth suffusing him, Cas had always been really considerate of him and concerned for his well-being. Maybe it wasn’t such an atypical question after all.
Things sped up after that - skin slapping against skin and sweat dripping from Castiel and landing on Dean, the omega swiping at a droplet with his tongue and inhaling it.
Dean blushed, though whether it was from embarrassment or pleasure, he didn't know, and turned around to pick a pair of shoes. "These good?" he asked Castiel, showing him a pair of black trainers.
"Five hundred," muttered the older man but he didn't disagree with Dean, which the omega took as a victory.
"Dean?" came Castiel's voice from right in front of him and Dean had to use all of his energy to focus his eyes on Cas' face.
“-but it’s hard to control predatory journalism, especially from a distance. Besides which, I can’t do it all on my own.
Dean gasped, arching his back as Castiel kissed his way down his flat stomach. The five o’clock shadow on his mate’s face only added to the stimulation, scratching against his sensitive skin. “Ah, Cas,” he whined as his lover found
that, right?"
His face drooping, Bobby apologised again, “I really shoulda put that can-”
“Good job,” Dean praised him. “You hungry?”
Dean fidgeted in his seat. "What exactly do you want to know?"
"Well." Dean smirked as he watched the tepee catch fire. "I am a pro at building fires."
Dean followed his boss into one of the garages at the back. What was the man talking about? What parts? “What sort of car are we talking about?”
Castiel - clueless as ever - interrupted him: "Oh, it's all right, Dean. I have a few minutes to spare."
Castiel looked at him again intently. "Dean, I don't want this to be something we rush. We have managed to pace ourselves so far,p; would you not rather wait for a while longer?"
While his brother collected some of his belongings, Dean finished the note, explaining to his dad that Sammy would be staying with him and Cas until John sorted himself out. If he couldn’t commit himself to going through rehab, Sam wouldn’t be returning anytime soon, Dean scribbled. He set the note prominently in the center of the coffee table, figuring his dad couldn’t miss it there, placing the model of a green Ford Mustang that he’d assembled when he was eight years old on top of it.
“Isn’t it obvious, Senator?” he asked, feeling like he was a part of a roleplay.
P.S. Anyone has any ideas of what you'd like to see in this story, let us know :) We might take some inspiration.
Dean tagged along with the rest of his group, which received a key to room number 216, and went upstairs to choose a bed - if he was lucky - or a spot on the floor - if he wasn't.
"Samuel Winchester," Dean said in his best parent voice, "tell me what's wrong."
It really sucked to write this chapter, I had so much trouble stringing words together that I honestly thought I'd never finish it. I'd really appreciate if you gave me some love :)
They arrived at the shop a few minutes later, Dean's hand still on Cas' thigh and his mind still on the kiss.
“Erm, were you serious about posting it on the front gate?” Dean asked, feeling foolish as he posed the question. You never knew with Meg, though; she just might consider that the best thing to do.
Castiel stepped even closer, fingers tracing over Dean’s chest lightly. “Because I’m a taken man,” he teased.
"Dean." Castiel tapped his chin with a forefinger lightly and Dean forced himself to lift his head.
Charlie tilted her head. "Dean, honey, you know he was probably talking about alpha welfare right?"
“-no one could have suspected Aaron wouldn’t put that container down after one whiff.”
She piled them all on the floor in front of them, returning back to the kitchen, and Jo and Gabe immediately grabbed a bag each, Gabe then turned to Castiel. "You want those weird ones you like?"
He thought about how John would be secretly glad he had some help in taking care of the finances. He would realize Dean was good for more than just cooking and cleaning. He used to be good at lots of things, which all just somehow fizzed out after he presented.
Since they were both finished with lunch, Dean grabbed their plates, rinsed them and placed them in the dishwasher. “Let me show you an article I read about myself,” he proposed. “Then you’ll understand why I’m so concerned.”
Just when you think it's all rainbows and sunshine ...
we need to rise up together and change the world view.
in it; that sounded just like the thing he was interested in.
Dean bit the inside of his cheek to prevent himself from saying something sarcastic. "We are not going to be an influential family, Dad. It's Cas that's influential."
“She can be a right pain, but she knows her stuff,” Roche remarked.
Dean entered the bathroom and almost slammed right into Castiel who was standing at the sink, trying to tame the mess on top of his head he called hair.
asked the woman and Dean could've kissed her.
"I'm going to come, Cas," he whispered.
“That’s it,” his mate praised him, running calming hands down his sides. “Good boy.”
“Hmm, bossy,” Castiel murmured, his lips curling up in a smile against Dean’s side.
"Okay, I'll call him."
Castiel looked him in the eye. "Dean," he started seriously, "I assure you I am completely fine."
His mate was so good to him. A soft smile on his lips, Dean decided to buck up and do his best to be an active part of his family again. Just sitting in the kitchen and having a cuppa would be a good start. “Smells good,” he murmured appreciatively as he shuffled closer to the table, where a lone place setting waited in front of the chair he normally sat in.

When they finally pulled up in front of John’s house what seemed like hours later, Sam dashed out from behind the old oak tree growing in their front yard and threw his arms around his older brother, nearly sobbing in relief.
“I, um, I know I didn’t do right by you and Sammy.” John stumbled over the words a bit, red flags of embarrassment in his cheeks. “That makes me all the luckier that you and Castiel took a chance on me - letting me help you look after my grandsons. Not that I ever expected to be a grandad so young, mind you.”
The omega sighed, nodding. “I know, I’ll just miss you, that’s all.”
On one hand, he thought the army was useful and it was commendable to fight for freedom; on the other hand, it was true what Cas had said. That they needed to resolve their own problems before trying to help others.
Dean immediately started giggling. "You should never try to speak Czech ever again, Cas. Even I could tell that was terrible."
“They found out my name,” he admitted. “The tabloids are full of articles about me now.”
Even Dean could see that unless he took his phone and read the text, he wouldn't get the answer to his questions.
Meg bestowed a shark-like grin on him. “I understand Nurse Minger has been reprimanded for jumping to conclusions, and also that she’s been put on bedpan duty for the next month.”
The omega shook his head resignedly. “This is the reason I want to become a better mate for Cas. All these articles calling me unfortunate, dumb and gold-digging are just showing Cas in a bad light.”
"Hey!" cried out his little brother in indignation, "I was listening to that."
"You feel so wonderful, Dean," Cas breathed out.
Dean shrugged. "Well if he's hot."
They were almost to Colorado Springs when Charlie informed them that they were meeting another omega, Gabriel, at the edge of the city. "His brother couldn't drive him since he has some work-related meeting to go to and Gabriel doesn't ride on the bus."
"Pleased to meet you too," he said, remembering some proper behaviour and dropping the senator's hand.
Dean had been perusing the website for Cas’ country club for all of four minutes, to see what they offered in the way of tennis instruction, when his mobile began ringing, the volume rapidly escalating. “Darn it,” he muttered - having just had the brilliant notion that perhaps he could combine tennis lessons with tutoring in Spanish, if he could find the right instructor.
Dean turned his brother around and pushed him back into the room. "Now come on, champ, we're going to play a video game and you're going to like it."
He then started playing some of his new songs, head bobbing to the beat as he waited for an answer. He didn't have to wait long.
The alpha had already left for work, but Dean still couldn’t stop fretting and blaming himself for bringing all this trouble onto Castiel. So much so that despite the way Bobby had badmouthed his mate in the past, the omega even talked the matter over with him. The older mechanic first expressed his surprise over the fact that John had found the gumption to check himself into rehab, and then he was startled to find himself in agreement with Castiel regarding the rumors about Dean being an alcoholic - which was to let it go. Bobby recommended, “Do your best to ignore the tabloids, Dean. Sooner or later, some other ‘scandal’ will come up, and this tempest in a teapot will be put on the back burner.”
At least he wouldn't have to lie to John when he asked if he caught somebody's eye. He'd be able to say a resounding, guiltless 'no'.
"Excuse me," said a tall fair-haired man that had just entered the shop, "I'm here to pick up my car?"
His father sighed. "There will come a day when you'll have to re-evaluate that opinion, son. Not everyone can choose who they end up with and some things are more important than that."
i'm thinking about you <3
The older man nodded his head thoughtfully. "He was probably just trying to protect you. I'm sure he didn't mean to mislead you."
When Cas suddenly asked, “Do you ever wish you weren’t an omega?” the younger man looked up, blinking in surprise at his mate. “That you’d been an alpha or a beta and could make different choices?”
"Well, I brought some party games and a karaoke machine but I thought we might go out to Memorial Park near our hotel and have a picnic."
"This is nice," Dean said, looking around.
Now he took a deep breath and lifted his head, narrowing his eyes in a conscious effort to focus them. He looked around the mostly bare room he was sitting in, studying the other men seated in uncomfortable plastic chairs. They all seemed fairly competent, well except that wiry guy in glasses that sat right next to the door, but Dean wasn't really worried since he was more than competent too.
"Oh, well, you can rest assured that I have no intention of providing him with the money to do that."
“Social studies,” the teenager mumbled, writing a couple words in his notebook. “But I’m done now.” He grinned, closing both the notebook and the textbook.
The only real condition that came out of Castiel's mouth was that Dean was required to appear at most of the official functions that Castiel was forced to attend, since it would present a bad public image for Cas to be seen alone when he had a mate at home. Dean wasn't too happy about it but didn't really have any objections, so they didn't argue about it.
"How did you enjoy your trip?" asked Sam when he was settled more or less comfortably against his pillow, tea in hand.
Dean sighed. “Yeah, well… these people are just gonna write whatever they want.”
Dean closed his mouth. That made sense. So objectification wasn't only thinking about people as objects, it was disregarding their humanity. Their feelings. Dean thought about what Senator Novak would feel if he heard Jo's comments about his looks. Would he feel dejected because she didn't mention he was a nice, hard-working person?
"So you decided to fight for omega rights instead?"
“You know what?” Meg interjected before he could remove a tea bag, “I think this calls for coffee.”
"I try and right the wrongs that are still out there. I admit I might not represent the opinion of everyone but that doesn't change my point of view."
Castiel followed right behind him, pulling out a chair for Dean to sit in, and then sliding it back in once his husband had settled into the seat. “I got some scones from that bakery you like.” Cas directed his attention to the plate in the middle of the table that was heaped high with a variety of the pastries.
"You say that now." His father sheugged. "You'll see when you take a wealthy mate; you'll want so many children, you'll die of happiness."
They searched for the remote for a good four minutes and when they finally managed to locate it, they turned the archaic telly on. A black-haired host showed up in a blue tinted studio on Channel 24, a fierce expression on her face.
"Are you all right, Dean?"
Gabe sighed before popping another bonbon in his mouth and muttering, "So Benny's the only one with a ball and chain."
“Santa’s not here,” John informed the twins, who immediately sported identical, crestfallen expressions.
Castiel ran a soothing hand down his back. “Sweetheart,” he sighed. “It’s going to happen again no matter what you do. The press is always going to find something to write about - no matter how perfect you are. If it’s not this, then it’s going to be that.”
As soon as Dean finished the sentence, he thought that that might actually be the reason Castiel saw something in him. Dean wasn't besotted like the others but he was still pleasant enough - unlike Jo. That might be why the politician was interested.
He vaguely felt his body moving as Cas helped to turn him around and settle him on his back. Then he felt soft pecks being left all over his face, avoiding his mouth as he was still gasping for air.
Dean clenched his fists together on the kitchen table, a whine of distress escaping him as he recalled how the people in the ER had taunted him and John. The nurse who’d been bombarding him with questions even motioned a security guard over, as though fearing Dean would… The omega still had no idea what she’d been so scared of. True, he’d been frantic to get to Aaron, with the beta nurse refusing to provide an update on how the tyke was doing, but it wasn’t like he’d actually hit the woman.
“I will, Dean. You’re a good son,” John acknowledged. “Thanks for making me do this. I needed the help.”
And Dean did. Forgetting about the tragedy for a while, he told Cas about what Bobby had said - though he put it into nicer words - and  he added some of his own thoughts and through it all, Castiel actually listened to him.
Dean kissed his lover, whispering in his mouth, "Shut up, Cas."
"I will understand if you don't want to. I can always just ask Gabe to contact you again," said Castiel, his face all understanding and professional.
“He said that maybe it would be better to pay for some sort of therapy rather than just give him money. Bobby thinks that would just enable his addiction, you know?” Dean looked up at his alpha. “It’s like treating the symptoms instead of the illness.”
?” the brunette woman asked in a silky-smooth voice.
They lay in a comfortable silence after that, Dean pressing his cheek against Castiel's shoulder and humming in contentment. The alpha was running a hand slowly up and down Dean's arm, leaving goosebumps in its wake and leaving the younger man feeling breathless. Feeling the hard, toned body against his, the omega felt a stirring in his groin again.
The omega snorted. “What are you doing here?”
Later that day when Dean was sitting in his room, reading news articles about the merit scholarship referendum, he noticed a link to the Liberal Party official website. He clicked on it, figuring he might as well educate himself on Cas' opinions - and when the hell did he start calling him Cas? He knew that it wasn't going to be a hundred percent accurate since Castiel did lecture him about labels and not assuming about people but he thought he couldn't really screw anything up.
"Yep." He nodded. "All good. I'm perfect."
What came next were the most exhausting two hours of Dean’s life. Getting introduced to more people than he’d met in the last nineteen years put together and having to exchange pleasantries with all of them, while trying to remember all their names and hobbies. He could see that some of them had clearly received the came coaching he had, though they weren’t being so obvious about it - maybe he should try and be a little more covert about it too.
“What’s this?” Cas asked. “Something for my birthday?
Charlie rolled her eyes. "Yeah we know, grandpa, now that you have properly ruined the mood, can we have some fun?"
"Good morning," he greeted the other man as he stepped inside.
Charlie sighed, rolling her eyes. "Okay" she said. "Well, I do have to go and pick up Gilda from her ballet class now; are you going to be okay?"
Dean sighed, lifting his eyes from the computer screen for a bit. Being a good mate seemed like a lot of work. His gaze fell upon a picture of Cas and an older man, standing on a tennis court with rackets in their hands and polite smiles on their faces.
Rufus grumbled from somewhere behind him. "Stupid kids, going out this late. I'd like to see how many of you end up mated to some thugs forcing themselves on you."
Gabriel grinned. “Oh, I’d be the most fun parent in the world, Dean-o; you bet your lovely bum on that. My kids would know so many pranks that the school would have trouble keeping up.”
“That, my friend, is a surprise,” teased Bobby. “You said you had a 67 Impala?”
Noah’s brow furrowed. “How’s we do that?”
Meg snorted. “Listen, angel, I’ll give you an example, okay? Remember last year, how Senator Amarillo and his wife used a surrogate to have their third child? They said it was because Mrs Amarillo was ill and didn’t want to strain herself, so their friend Carla had offered to carry for them.”
“Oh, ancient history.” Gabe shrugged dismissively.
Dean hmmed. “Yeah, I remember. That was sweet of her.”
“I can take care of the dishes,” Castiel offered, pushing back his chair.
The senator glanced at him apologetically after swallowing his mouthful. "I'm sorry, these just make me... very happy."
The walk home was very upbeat with Dean feeling like he could walk several miles and never get tired. He never knew what being given a chance would actually mean to him. Sure, he was the only candidate to apply for the job but Bobby still could've sent him home when he smelled Dean was an omega - and he did smell it; Dean recognized the twitch of the nose people did when they smelled him.
Dean shook his head with a grin, pointing Charlie in the way of the kitchen. He was glad he could talk to the energetic girl again.
“But-” Dean mumbled, unable to completely exonerate himself.
Crowded into his kitchen doorway were three people. Meg was front and center, with Charlie and Gabe staring over her shoulders.
Dean nodded, appreciating the honesty. "I don't think I want you to know my life story," he said quietly, "but I suppose I can tell you something. I live with my father and brother in a small house, and uh, we don't really have it easy, you know?"
Dean turned to look at Gabriel. "Huh?"
Dean cringed. "No, I don't. I actually feel like he's being really honest but that's why I feel weird about it. I mean, what politician is honest?"
Dean thought that while that was kind of neat - an alpha supporting his omega's political agendas - he wouldn't really want to mate someone who didn’t have an opinion. He might not like everything Cas did but he did appreciate that he had an opinion that he was willing to stand behind.
“Wow.”
Dean grinned at the way Cas awkwardly pronounced the Czech word, noticing the waitress hide her smile behind her notepad. "And I'll have the duck with red cabbage and potato dumplings."
Benny raised his left eyebrow but didn't comment and Dean suddenly felt very self-conscious. Was it weird that his dad checked up on him constantly? He didn't want to seem like a loser who couldn’t take care of himself.
They played something between fifteen and twenty games before flopping down on the blanket in exhaustion. Dean closed his eyes for a moment, and it was a testament to how good he felt around these people that he fell asleep.
Sam smiled hesitantly. "Okay, just make sure he's nice to you, okay?"
Castiel tilted his head to the side, sizing him up. "Of course," he said after a while. "I promise that if we get mated, we don't have to vote at all until omegas can vote separately. If our opinions differ, that is."
The politician stared into his eyes for a beat, trying to read whether Dean was truly comfortable, before smiling and tugging his boxer briefs down and over the younger man's excited erection. Dean felt the warm air hit his privates and shuddered in anticipation, lifting his eyes to Castiel's.
Cas must’ve read his mind because he didn’t push Dean about eating the scones, instead gently coaxing, “Try a bite if you feel up to it, love. They’ll keep till tomorrow, if not.”
“I should have kept my eye out for Aaron!” Dean cried out, his voice full of anguish. “I
It the past week his father had researched Castiel from top to bottom, from right to left and despite not completely agreeing with his politics, he concluded that he would make a good mate. John had also tried to contact him on his official e-mail but since Castiel hasn't called him or otherwise contacted him, the messages must have not reached him.
Charlie spread a large, old-fashioned, checkered blanket on the grass and sat down right in the middle of it, her face beaming with contentment.
Charlie grabbed his hand. "Of course not. Castiel is not an idiot; he knows it's not your fault. You're not responsible for what your dad does or says."
"No, just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean that I'm stupid or that I don't understand. I am allowed my own opinion."
He was still mulling over the problem when he got home that evening, walking in to Sam sitting at the kitchen table, doing his homework.
He didn't get a reply but it wasn't like he really expected one, so he stuffed his phone back into his pocket.
"Um, sorry?" Castiel's face was confusion itself.
. That was how he thought of it - with capital letters. He felt like his life had come to a screaming halt and couldn’t stop dwelling on that horrible day; he’d been doing his best to hide away from the world ever since.
Don't get him wrong, he often thought of being with Castiel like that and he was looking forward to finding out what it felt like in real life. Especially now, sitting next to a casually dressed Cas, seeing the way his tight T-shirt showed off muscles that no politician had any business having - Dean wasn't going to deny he was a bit hot and bothered. But having sex for real?
attitude that needs adjusting,” he asserted. “Within ten minutes, you’ve condescendingly called me ‘pet’, ‘puppy’, a ‘mardy teenager’, ‘stupid’, a ‘five-year-old’, ‘angel’ and ‘brat’, acting as if I’m too retarded to even notice that you don’t think much of me. If you can’t treat me as an equal - just because I’m an omega - then, no, I can’t learn from you.”
He was no better than Lilith, he realized. He was just as self-centred as her, only caring about omega rights after he himself ran into a wall. Would he abandon the fight if he ever found a security in a mate and a family?
“Sweetheart,” Roche remarked fondly as a svelte blonde woman came up to him, “this is Castiel’s mate, Dean Winchester. Do you think you could introduce him around to some of the other spouses? Meanwhile I’m gonna have a chat with Novak here.”
“Aren’t you excited, Dean?” Charlie asked, nuding her friend in the side. “It looks like omegas are finally going to have some actual rights. This is what we’ve been working towards for so long!”
Castiel slid one of his hands downwards to stroke the thin length, coaxing a loud moan out of his young lover's throat.
Castiel nodded. "Of course, that applies to the alphas. Omegas usually reach about only a half of the welfare alphas do. I would much rather bring down the outrageous alpha benefits to the omega level, so that it would pay off to work."
The omega shot off of the couch, heading towards the kitchen. “What are you waiting for then?” he teased the older man. “Come on!”
