His own cock was drizzling, making his thighs sticky and wet but he held strong. He clutched the crop and stared over his prize, this beautiful man trusting him wholly to not hurt him but to make him soar.
“No.” Sherlock whispered. “Is he in Defense?” He glanced at John.
“What now?” John called.
misbehaving boy. John kissed his lips. “A shower? We have to get ready for dinner soon.”
“Alright?” John said, “ready?”
“Thank you, Mycroft.” He said. “Truly.”
“I want the crop.”
"You are." Greg kissed the side of her head where she was nestled against his shoulder. "Strongest woman I know."
"Let's try the glazed ones." Mary said. They each took a bite.
“It was more convenient this way.” Sherlock shrugged. He sat still, staring at John tucking into the food. John had fed him off his own fork and it had been…kind of nice. Intriguing. Certainly worth more investigation. He cleared his throat, caught his dom’s eye, and glanced pointedly at the pasta box. John took the hint and gave him more lasagna. He didn’t usually do feeding. He didn’t enjoy it himself as a sub. Too obsequious for his pride. The times he’d tried it as a dom, it often felt awkward and forced. With Sherlock though, it felt as natural as is could have been. It was still a bit odd, but pleasantly intimate in its own way.
"Tiny fruit pies on sticks. Like cake pops, but pie instead. I'm making apple, cherry, and raspberry. They're great for parties."
and see if it could go anywhere, but what he wanted wasn’t the issue here. No, it was all up to Sherlock. It would be completely reasonable if he didn’t want to take a new dom now and possibly not ever. Not after the rough go of the relationship he’d just had.
“Where is it?” Sherlock said, getting into the front seat and slamming the door behind. The car smelled like coffee, cool fresh air, and Lestrade’s cologne.
“It was. Didn’t we talk about rudeness before?”
“Meddling bastard!” He hissed, and stormed towards the bedroom.
“Don’t like the paddle. I liked before though.”
"Och, that looks nasty." Mel patted Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock kissed him, relief flooding his limbs, and John kissed him back.
“That’s okay.” Sherlock looked up at him, eyes wide and open and pleading. “Use them, John. Please?”
The knock on his door slammed across every one of Sherlock's exposed nerves. He was flopped in the pillows on his bed. The curtains were drawn, blocking out the obnoxiously cheerful sunlight. Stubble shaded his face and he needed to bathe. He could smell himself. It was gross, but he didn't care. He'd met with the stupid Swiss delegates two days ago and signed their stupid treaty on Mycroft's behalf. He didn't even read what he had signed. For all he knew, he had agreed to a war declaration.
Sherlock nodded quickly and they strolled up to the scene.
The young man’s skin was sallow from him having been cooped up for days in a hospital bed and his face had a sunken, pinched look of bad health. He stared up at Sherlock, surprised, and took a shaky breath. “Um…I don’t know?”
“No, just sore. Tight.”
“Me neither….”
“Betsy is coming by to help Mrs. Hudson. They’re finally going to meet.” John took a bite of bacon. “I told them they didn’t have to cook, but you know.”
Once the meal was finished, Sherlock brought his plate to the kitchen and reached for his coat by the door.
Curious, John took the blue-cased Android and put it to his ear. “Who is this?”
"Oh yes, you little troublemaker, I do know the King personally. Do you know the name Lord Sebastian Moran?"
Sherlock was at the table the next afternoon, typing up another entry in his journal. His fingers were barely able to keep up with the flow of information and data spewing from his brain as he graphed his blood test results from the sample taken after the bondage session and compared the data to previous experiences with Seb. The blood chemistry varied greatly. His time spent with John in bondage starkly contrasted with the data he’d gathered after Seb had fucked him into the mattress. His time with John yielded higher levels of oxytocin, which was integral to the bonding process. Endorphin levels had been high and he wasn’t surprised at that. That was likely the cause of John nibbling on his chest for a bit. Sherlock grinned at the screen as he detailed serotonin and dopamine readings too.
“Text me the address.” He said.
“Certainly he would say I’m his arch enemy, but I assure I’m nothing as dastardly as that.”
“Nope.” Greg and Donovan stood up. “If we do, I’ll let you know.” Greg said.
He paused on the steps, listening. The soft whines of a violin floated down and John looked up at the closed door. He didn’t know that Sherlock liked listening to classical music. Maybe it was for an experiment. He opened the door to the kitchen and set the bag on the table, delighted to see that Sherlock was the one playing. He stood in the sitting room doorway and watched him push the…the wooden sticky bit over the strings. He knew nothing of the violin except that Sherlock playing it was one of the sexiest things he’d ever seen. His sub’s eyes were closed gently as the sweet notes filled the room. It was a slow song, but not melancholy—more like a lullaby. John couldn’t narrow it down any more than that and he wanted to go over there and kiss him hard.
“This was very naughty, love.”
The music rose and John looked up across the courtyard. It seemed to be coming from an open window. John stared at the window and hoped he'd see the person creating such a mesmerizing sound. A figure moved across the space, shadowed, but holding the violin to her‒his?--shoulder. The figure turned and torchlight flooded over his features.
They'd been working on the case all morning. John and Sherlock had arrived at NSY at half eight and they'd been sifting through evidence, making calls, brainstorming, and consuming heroic amounts of coffee when Lestrade finally announced they were all going outside to get some lunch take a well deserved break.
They got coffees and sat on another bench. John glanced at the slim brushed silver chain around Mike's neck. Was that a
Sherlock turned away from the forensic tech. “He probably worked as a repairman of some kind, maybe fixed home appliances or the Tube.”
“No.” Sherlock mumbled.
"Get ready," Sue said.
John crept forward on his hands and knees. It was easier that way. Not as far to fall if he came across more stairs.  The grit and grime of a long abandoned place dirtied his palms. The floor might have been made of wood but it was so old and chilled it was hard to tell. He moved towards the light and peered down. The crack was too small to see anything through, but if he tilted his head he could just barely hear voices. Shouting. Amidst the shouting was the sound of breaking glass and fists slamming furniture.
“You’re thinking very loudly.” John said with a grin. “And I think something else is more interested now too.” John tilted Sherlock’s head down to stare at his own dick. It was fully hard now. Sherlock took a deep breath, his pulse starting to race.
"Fuck."
“That’s the point. You don’t enjoy it, so you avoid breaking the rule.”
John laughed, then growled and spilled hot and hard over his sub’s hand.
They stared at each other in fumes of rage. Finally John grabbed his jacket.
“—No.” John said firmly. Sherlock drew his hand away.
Sherlock’s cock jerked higher and John grinned.
Sherlock wasn’t in the hall. John hadn’t really expected him to be.
"I hope not." Greg said. "He sounds like a strong person." He squeezed Molly reassuringly. "He has to be to have put up with Sherlock his whole visit, right?"
Sherlock didn’t need any urging. He straddled John and they snogged hard, their hands rubbing up and down each other’s back and chests. John broke the kiss and hugged him close. “Sore still?” He asked, touching his thighs and bum.
“I took half a dose.” John grumbled.
They both stared at other, then burst into giggles.
“A case?” John asked.
Sherlock smiled at the note and slipped a hand back to his bum. Oh, he was sore. He rubbed fingers over the skin and hissed. They’d fallen asleep really fast last night and Sherlock fancied he could still feel subspace edging around his mind. He didn’t like being in subspace alone. He wanted John.
Sally Donovan, soldier of the royal guard, crouched before him and put a hand on his shoulder. He saw the single shot pistol nestled in a hard leather holster on her belt. A wicked silver dagger was sheathed just in front of it. A hard red leather chest plate was buckled around her torso and she smelled like gun oil and hide as she drew nearer to him.
He put the leaflets down and made sure he had his wallet and phone. Now where had he put the keys? They couldn’t have gone far. He patted his pockets and didn’t find them. Hm. He went into the kitchen, no, the loo, no. The bedroom? He found the bag on the chair and his keys beside it. He picked them up, jangling, and shoved them in his pocket. Alright then, coupon, money, keys. He stepped out of the door and shut it, jogging down the steps. He couldn’t wait for that naan, and maybe a nice chicken curry…
John shrugged. Why not? “Sure.” He took a bite of his pie.
John didn’t move.
"Or that new waiter at Angelo's?"
“I would
"I hate it here too." Sherlock sat up. "Jim is a loathsome little toad."
Mycroft rubbed his brow and Sherlock suppressed a smile. It was clear Mycroft hadn't expected Sherlock to have given his winnings away. "I hardly need the money." He shoveled more eggs between his lips, his table manners awful on purpose.
“Y, yes, sir.”
John stood there, feeling like he’d just been slapped across the face. Never had he been rebuffed so succinctly.
John gulped and nodded, looking down again.
"Where?"
Sherlock scowled at the wall. A smack. How childish. He reached up to massage his temples—
Weird, that’s what this was. Very, very weird. John glanced around the space with a soldier’s eye, noting nothing threatening save a metal letter opener on the desk that could possibly be commandeered as a weapon. Again he wished for the gun—he just felt safer with it tucked in the back of his trousers.
“I asked you to spend the night and now I have to leave. If you want to go back to your flat, I understand.”
The receiving room he'd entered was filled with engraved furniture and luxuriant sofas and chairs. There was one window in the far wall, covered with green velvet drapes to keep the cold air out. It wasn't working. Every place in Chilgrave was cold.
John paused his strokes, his hand on Sherlock's arse. "You know what I mean, cheeky." He said. He felt Sherlock smile against him.
Jim pulled on his arm, putting pressure on the shoulder socket. The old harpoon injury flared in pain and John grit his teeth.
a thing or two yesterday.”
“Do you like books?” He asked.
John pulled away from the kiss. “I’ll see you tonight, love. Be good.”
Sherlock’s breakfast containers. “Get forks, love.” He brought the food into the sitting room and Sherlock followed with utensils, perplexed. “Get the flag pillow and kneel beside me.”
John leaned up, looking down at his sub. He was delighted at how pliant he had become and his inner dom swelled in pride. He had reduced this glorious, genius man to a mewling, spacing wreck. It felt pretty good. His erect cock jerked in agreement. His Defense was still simmering low and he grabbed the lube, slicking himself up with a growl.
"I already do." John teased. Sherlock stared at him for a moment and John blinked. Uh oh. That might have been too much. Sherlock bit his lip and looked away, his face pink and his mouth smiling. John, feeling both smug and giddy, read his recipe again. He'd brought out enough yeast for about four loaves of bread, figuring that in case three loaves went wrong he still had a fourth to fall back on.
“What’s the problem?”
They got back to the flat a few hours later, just as it was starting to rain. The sun had long since set, and John was glad he didn’t have to go in to work until eleven the next morning. It was getting late.
“Mike.” Sherlock shoved the alcohol at him. Mike took it, surprised.
“Sherlock Holmes requires a certain touch, Doctor Watson, one that his former dominant was unable to provide. I suspect you’ll grow bored or irritated with him soon enough, but before that inevitably happens, I’m going to offer you a rather large sum of money if you keep me informed of his goings-on.”
the crop at the chair again and once more, Sherlock startled. John grinned. “Oh, this will be fun. Lean forward, put your hands on the mantle.”
“He was on my rugby team. He winked at me after practice one day and that was it. It was, well, I wouldn’t say like a switch being flipped. It was more like I found
The next morning at work, John called in a couple favors and by the end of the day managed to procure a vial of blood contaminated with black plague. He’d thought about it, and decided Sherlock might like it to play with, given how he liked to experiment and apparently collect limbs in towels. He’d appreciate it, right? He nestled the glass vial in a cooler with ice packs and locked it up, then bit his lip and stared at it. Was it too much? It was pretty weird. But then Sherlock was hardly normal. John was suddenly having second thoughts about this whole thing. He pulled his phone out and texted Mike.
He left and went back to the cab, idling by the curb. It was empty save for the driver.
“John.” Mike said.
“Oh God!” Sherlock shouted and pounded both fists into the table, making the glass pipes jangle dangerously and the skull nearly tilt over.
“Hi John!”
“Sherlock, do you need to talk or anything?”
“Are you just worn out from talking about…everything?”
"Abusive?" John suggested.
Molly let out a breathy sigh, panting, flushed, and limp with the aftermath of pleasure. She wriggled in the bed sheets and groaned as Greg popped up from under the blankets. His chin was slopped with saliva and her own slick and he gave her a saucy wink.
“Don’t be embarrassed love, I’m a sub too you know. I know what it’s like to have your dom upset with you. Of course, Frank had a different view on things…it was a different time, then.”
Sherlock glanced over, staring at John’s thick stiff cock. His own reared up a little higher and the dom’s pride swelled. It took Sherlock a long time to get erect, and he was pleased that just the mere sight of his cock was enough to get the detective’s body interested. John got up on the bed and wound the silky black ropes around his sub’s chest. He brushed his hands in long strokes over his smooth skin as he bound him up underneath his arms and criss crossing his sternum. He wound one end up around his neck, mimicking a collar and gulped at the sight of the dark band around his pale throat. He slipped two fingers underneath and gently tugged. “Alright? Not too tight?”
“I wish. Gotta go to Jim’s dinner thing tonight.”
"Good. What about you? Girls and boys? Er, just girls…?"
“Tallish guy. Sub. Dark hair—he was a student at the College?” She pulled Owen’s ID—still in the evidence bag—out and showed him.
"Behold, John Watson. Your new home. For now."
“I mean it. You’re the smartest person I’ve ever met—by a long shot. And I love you.”
John handed her his extra copy. "They meet Sundays at seven. Mrs. H is hosting this month so it's at 221."
“Good. Now, make me some tea.”
Sherlock strolled up to B’s door. His gaze zeroed in on a white thin cardboard envelope only slightly bigger than a sheet of A4 leaning up against the black shiny finish. Possibly post, but it was never left on the pavement. He put his leather gloves on and picked it up, examining. Thin. Cheap. He sniffed it. It just smelled like cardboard and possibly car exhaust. The markings on the envelope were generic—it could have been purchased it in any chemist’s or Tesco. It had his name and address in Arial font on a sticky label affixed to one side. There was no return address.
“—I think he’s been abducted by the killer and I think I might know who the killer is.”
“Why?”
Melissa pulled the white sheet and cream cotton blanket back and untied his gown and Sherlock got his first look at his body. White strips of bandages and gauze covered his ribs and left waist. The worst of it was on his arms and he remembered then that Logan had slashed his arm pretty deeply. He’d worried that he was going to bleed out and die. He gulped. A bandage was taped over his abdomen and the long slice on his waist was starting to throb. The deep cut in his forearm was starting to wake up too. The nurse set to work. John grabbed a pair of gloves and helped, binning the used gauzes and keeping up a bright monologue to distract him. “Everyone sent flowers. Mike and Betsy sent the big one, and Lestrade and his team sent those white and yellow things. Molly’s are the roses and Mrs. Hudson sent the purple tall ones. There’s some of those dipped biscuits you like from her too.”
“Get on the bed, then. Knees and elbows.”
They took a long time, soaping and rinsing and kissing. John massaged shampoo into his sub’s hair and Sherlock gently washed every inch of his dom’s body, lost in thought as he did. Was now a good time to ask him to move in? They were in the shower, but did it matter? Would John say no? It would be fine if he did. Sherlock understood the desire to have one’s own space. Better to do so now, he decided, while he had the courage and the oxytocin whizzing through his veins made his brain hum a little quieter.
John glanced at his hand, then his face. Sherlock waggled his fingers and gave his dom a small smile.
They exchanged thank yous and goodbyes and Sherlock and John took the lift down and wandered out into the sunshine. "Tube, I guess." John said. "A cab to the hospital would cost a fortune."
Sherlock internally rolled his eyes at his own cringing stupidity. What did he care whether John lived or died? He was just one of dozens of criminal whores at Jim's castle. In theory John's existence should mean nothing at all to Sherlock. But John had told him his whole life story and Sherlock wasn't bored to tears. That alone set John apart. Well, that and his lovely handsome face.
John turned the water off and patted him dry. He gave himself a cursory wipe and wrapped a terry dressing gown on.
“Hello.” Sherlock said. “Goodbye.” He started to turn away, to go into the flat—
"What are you doing?" John called.
John finally pulled his fingers out and smacked Sherlock’s arse. “Roll over.”
Sebastian’s voice was laced with disgust and shock.
The trip to the bedsit went mercifully fast. The place had come furnished, so it was really only a few boxes of personal items that needed moving. The driver helped them unload in B’s foyer and Sherlock gave him a big tip for his trouble.
"Fix it!" Sherlock demanded.
Sherlock looked away and bit his lip. He took a shaky breath. “I see now.”
“Michael,” Lestrade began, “a cab picked you up outside Ferndale, does that sound familiar?”
“Tea for me.” Sherlock called. The leather sofa creaked as Sherlock lay down.
Normally he kept track of all of John’s work shifts. It seems he had forgotten to do that this past week. That was unlike him. Not long after they’d first started dating, he made a point of hacking his dom’s laptop to get his schedule so he would always know where John was. Today he had no idea, and that bothered him. Sherlock glanced into the kitchen. No. He looked at the desk and saw John’s closed laptop and a sticky note taped to the top of it. A phone number was written down, along with the word ‘landlord.’ John must have called him today. He was moving in, after all. Sherlock wondered suddenly if that’s where John was. Maybe he was spending the night away. Maybe he thought he wouldn’t have nightmares in his own flat—away from Sherlock. John had been moaning his name last night through his tears. Sherlock gulped. He wouldn’t be surprised at all if John was away for the night.
Sally Donovan, as John had learned was the guard's name, was standing outside the door again. She smiled.
“Sebastian.” He turned around, standing straight and peering down his nose at the man. Seb had always hated that Sherlock was taller than he was. Good. He looked more or less the same. Maybe a little more sallow in the face. He’d been drinking a lot, Sherlock could tell by the look in his dark eyes and the flush riding high on his cheeks. He was very familiar with how Seb looked while tipsy.
Sherlock frowned at him and picked up the cooler, bringing it to the table. John actually found he was sort of nervous. Was it a good gift? He hoped it hadn’t spoiled. He didn’t think so—they’d only been gone a few hours. Sherlock opened it and extracted one vial, his eyes immediately focusing with interest and surprise as he read the label.
This last criteria was the hardest to measure and Sherlock was considering removing it entirely. This endeavor was nebulous enough as it was.
“Hey. Sh….” John patted Sherlock’s leg. “Stop that.”
King Moriarty and King Mycroft Holmes were sitting opposite each other, each an in armchair angled toward the fire. A low wooden table was between them and John shuffled over to it and carefully set the tray down, mentally cheering when nothing tilted or spilled. He picked up the teapot in his right hand, ignoring the pressure on his sprained fingers. He didn't trust his left arm. His shoulder was puffy and aching and when he'd been setting the items on the tray before walking in, his grip had faltered dangerously. He placed his left fingertips on the teapot lid to anchor it and filled both cups with dark liquid.
“Close, but not quite.” Sherlock winked at him over his shoulder.
Sherlock saved the document and stood up. He’d been on his stomach on the floor, as his bottom was still mighty sore. He opened the door. “Good morning, Sherlock.” She set the tea platter on the kitchen table.
had been…interesting. Definitely a journal entry. Sherlock had been fine inside with Coel, even bordering on the more dominant edge of his submission as he maintained control of the situation. But John storming inside and slamming Coel around, his red hot anger and boiling blood had dropped Sherlock’s control in an instant and made him tremble. He crouched down, hugging himself. What he really wanted was to roll onto his back and show his belly. He’d upset his dom, and his natural submission was roaring loud, telling him to do whatever John wanted. He’d let the man fuck him right here in the street and then piss all over him if that’s what he demanded.
“Oh.” John stared back at the telly. “How long will you be doing that?”
"Shut-up." John said mildly. He pointed at the exam table.
"Ah yeah. You know those legendary healers you hear about now and then? The ones even princes and kings travel to see? That can practically perform miracles and are so good they get accused of being a witch on a daily basis? That was mum…” John trailed off. He hadn’t spoken to anyone this much in weeks. Hell, even his highwaymen crew hadn't known this much about his childhood and he'd trusted them with his life‒no, don't go there. Don't think about them.
"Honestly? I'm terrified." The words came out before he could stop them and he clamped his mouth shut.
“Do you need anything else?” John asked, glancing at the officers.
rest and food. When that engine between your ears runs too fast and hard and hot, when you're in danger of crashing and burning, I'm going to rein you in—case or not."
“I’m so glad that case was short.” John mumbled, patting Sherlock’s hip with his clean hand.
He wandered into a little storage area where he and Molly restocked their herbs. Unlike the stone walls out there, this small space was almost entirely wood. Ancient dark wood floor, grimy under his feet. Slightly lighter ceiling. In the slatted pine walls every few feet was a pillar of stone, giving the room a very boxy feel. John flared his nostrils. This space smelled of old paper, mineral-salty rock and the sweet dusty musk of decayed plants. If he really tried to imagine he could almost liken the smell to his childhood home and his mum’s dried herbs everywhere. He picked up a lantern and moved into the space. He wasn’t really looking for anything in particular. The shelves were well-stocked. He turned to put the lantern back by the door when a mark on the floor caught his eye.
“Problems at home.” Sherlock mumbled, coming up to his dom. “She’s discovering the horrors of dating Anderson…” Sherlock pulled out his phone and texted Lestrade:
“When did she usually come in?”
“Okay.” Sherlock rested his cheek on John’s chest and sighed, peaceful and happy.
"Sherlock, come on. We're going to be late." John called down the corridor to their bedroom. The door was half open and John could hear Sherlock rustling around.
on skin and Sherlock shivered. John did it again to the other side, then slapped the flat disk of plug poking out of his bum. Sherlock squirmed on the floor and John smirked when his boy’s cock tried to stir—unsuccessfully, as it was all tied up in the leather.
"Astounding." John shook his head back and forth.
“Would you say you have a good idea of the regular clientele?”
“Yes, you pompous arse.”
“Is his Defense usually like that?”
“Sorry.” John put the phone down. “He’d better not make abandoning dinner a habit.”
"Why didn't he pay?" Sherlock asked. The look John gave him made him shrink back into the pillows.
"Coward!" The merchant sneered. He staggered upright and pointed a finger at Sherlock. "You're a coward and cheat!"
“Someone’s in a strop.” Mrs. Hudson said from behind the refrigerator door.
John chuckled. "Would you like to do it again?"
“Not that. You should be in jail right now, do you realize that?”
“Sure, that sounds good.” John thought of hot fresh garlic naan and his mouth watered. “I was looking at collars on my lunch break. Leashes too.” John tugged up his pants and Sherlock stood, fixing his trousers.
“Oh, God. There we go.” John’s tone was satisfied and he had one arm thrown lazily over his forehead. “I love you so much, Sherlock. God, sex is so easy with you.”
“Here…” Sherlock held out his wrists and John cuffed him again.
“Mostly. Sick of me?” John teased.
“At Bart’s? Why?” John blurted, alarmed.
“He’s a submissive.” John said, a smile coming onto his face as he thought of Sherlock. “He’s brilliant. In every sense.”
"How are you decorating them…?" He asked, not seeing anything else.
"You should put the results on your website." John said.
The sub in him was eager to comply and he looked up at Sherlock with a pained, pinched look.
“Yes.” Sherlock smiled.
“We should shower. You’re sweaty.” Sherlock answered.
The corner time last night had been tedious as all hell, but afterwards, once John had gone to bed, he’d made a nice big space in one of the parlors in his palace for this case. He’d stashed all the relevant information about the limbs before passing out on the sofa for the night. This morning, after kissing John goodbye and watching him head for the Tube to get to the clinic, he’d also jotted physical notes on yellow lined paper and pinned then up on the black and ivory wall in B’s sitting room above the sofa. Fortunately John hadn’t insisted on a ridiculous punishment that would have taken even more time today. The case, The Work, was first priority now.
“Really?” He perked up in interest. “Like what?” When John didn’t say anything, Sherlock tried guessing.
Sherlock leaned off the mantle and got to his knees before his dom. He opened his mouth and sucked John’s cock in as far as it could go. He couldn’t get him all in his mouth, unfortunately. John was just too big. The dom didn’t seem to mind and Sherlock decided he’d practice this so he could give him this kind of pleasure. John sighed and leaned back in the chair, clenching his arse muscles to gently fuck his sub’s mouth.
The doctor paused. From what Mike had said, Sherlock managed to push away everyone that came near him. The fact that he was this relaxed in John’s—a dom’s—presence spoke volumes. He hadn’t been this content at the dinner party but he was perfectly alright having this strange dom in his home touching his injured arm. John felt there was something to that, but he didn’t know what.
"Apricots first or brioche first?" He looked dubiously at his pan and layered the bread. It didn't quite fit, so out came the knife. Across the way, Greg was simply stuffing the pieces into the pan, crushing down the apricots already laid within. The cameras were at the front of the tent.
"I can't!" Mike bit back a laugh. "No mere mortal can."
“How do they know?!” Jim Moriarty howled.
DI Paul Dimmock was having a wretched day. First he’d overslept. Then there was traffic. Then the buffoons in accounting still hadn’t quite figured out how to begin getting his pay rise from the promotion applied to his paychecks. His first case as a Detective Inspector had gone well enough (thank the fates) but this second one was a mess and this ‘consulting detective’ Lestrade had recommended was, at the very best, a loose cannon.
“Thank you. I will probably take you up on that.”
"‒No, no." Sherlock grumbled. "I don't think it." He didn't, truly. He just didn't want to be scolded at.
John took one more fortifying breath and Sherlock gulped, trying not to tremble. Seeing John get so…so,
“Son of a bitch.”
“And while you may be able to
John put the envelope down and rolled onto his stomach. They were eye level and John reached for his hands, grasping them.
There were a couple more like that and John swallowed hard. He’d never even told him that he had PTSD. Sherlock, the genius, no doubt figured it out. A few pages were marked with sticky notes but John didn’t touch. Sherlock had gotten those books for him? To understand him? He was incredibly touched by the gesture and he had the sudden urge to give his sub a big hug and kiss (though sans pigeon feathers, thanks). He wandered back into the kitchen and started preparing an early dinner for the two of them, aglow with love for his sub. Love? He licked his lips. Did he
“I don’t know. How long do you think you deserve to have them on?”
“Hey, Mike. It’s us.” John answered.
“We are talking about
“—One more word out of you that’s not your safeword is getting you thirty minutes!” John bellowed.
John spat in a loud whisper.
all the way up and then
"Bakers," Mel said, "for this week's showstopper, you have to think small."
“They’re utterly disgusting, love.” John kissed him on the nose and everyone laughed.
Sherlock buried his face in John’s knee and the doctor stroked his damp hair. “What do you need me to do?” John asked.
Mike sent a text back.
God, but Bart’s had changed. And it wasn’t just the new coats of paint. Old classrooms had been converted to computer labs—indeed nearly every room had at least one computer. It was amazing what this generation of future doctors had access to.
“What?” Sherlock looked up.
“Would I be able to substitute a few items?” Sherlock asked, looking at his neck and hands. “I have a sensitive palate.”
“You know what I mean.” John gave his bottom a pat. Sherlock grinned and hopped to his feet.
“Stand there. Fifteen minutes. No complaining. No fidgeting.”
Sherlock recovers and they both give their statements regarding the case. John has a big surprise for his sub.
She leaned back and sighed. "I'm sorry, John."
“Yes, but I want you naked more.”
boring, run of the mill stuff. He finished the tiramisu and scraped the bits of cream and crumbs onto his fork to lick clean.
Today Sherlock strolled into the surgery at noon and surprised his delighted doctor by declaring he wanted them both to go to lunch. They popped over to a little cafe up the road and got soup and sandwiches. The day was pleasant and sunny and warm so they sat outside under a wide striped umbrella as they ate.
Callum thought for a moment. “I’m not familiar with it…”
“Oh, um…the suspect made it as far as the Thames before I jumped out of the police car and tackled him.”
John blinked and looked over his shoulder and sure enough, the ropes were all laid out. Three bundles, black, white and purple, were wrapped up neatly. John cleared his throat and got to his feet and sat on the sofa. He ran fingers over the black ropes. They were silky and sateen under his fingertips, soft enough to feel good but rough enough for the fibers to cling and hold tight. The white ropes made him frown. Thin and acrylic, it was more like cheap clothesline than anything that would be worthy of being wrapped around his sub’s flesh. It would dig into the skin and hurt. John picked up the purple ropes, noting appreciatively that they were less rope and more pashmina silk scarf. A sinfully soft roll of flat plum fabric.
Sherlock smiled and John sighed, shaking his head fondly. “When you’re up for it.”
They’d parted ways amiably. Both agreed that the less their respective family members knew, the better. Janine was perfectly lovely but as Sherlock preferred men, he was hardly attracted to her. Janine had some artist she was madly in love with and it suited both their interests to pursue what they wanted. Sherlock didn’t have a plan yet for eliminating the future wedding but he was certain something would present itself. Until then he would let Mycroft think he was getting married.
"John, you're assigned to his Majesty tonight."
“You got there in time.” He said.
“I damn well did!”
smell like it!"
He listened to the cheerful girl on the other end telling him he was chosen as a
“No. He’s trying to find the murderer.”
John was walking home from Ella’s appointment, feeling slightly better about things and debating about stopping to get a coffee, when his phone jangled and vibrated. He pulled it from his pocket and stared at the name on the display. Sherlock. The phone warbled at him again and John thumbed the button, taking a fortifying breath and putting it to his ear.
She blinked. “Sherlock? What—can you not find him?”
your help."
John looked at his watch. “Lestrade? Where?”
Sherlock nodded and John reached around, finding the knots on the white acrylic rope. These were the least comfortable, so he wanted to get them off first. He fiddled with the knot, tugging at the fibers. It was tight. He hadn’t meant to make the knots so strong. He dug his fingernails into the thin cotton, trying to pry a loop free.
“Of course not.” Sherlock scoffed. “I simply read her wall. People put their entire lives online. I can see where she works, who she works with, what she likes to eat, her family. No word though since her departure.”
A nod.
"No. I don't know!" Sherlock looked up at him, anguished.
about stars?) and opened the book at random. The spread pages contained a brown and green moldering deer skull. Mushrooms sprouted out of an eye socket and streams of orange fungus spread across the dying grass below. Sherlock went very still, his mouth half open in awe as he took in the details of the image. Mike watched him, pleased, before quietly asking,
"Kneel down." He hissed. For a brief, horrible moment, John thought that Jim was going to force him to suck one of them off. He sank to his knees and when he neither monarch made a move towards him, he relaxed minutely.
“Do you want to safe word?” John asked. He looked his teary sub in the eye. His heart clenched and broke a little at the sad expression on his sub’s face, but he didn’t allow himself to show it.
“Were you married?”
“How long will you be gone?” John asked.
The morning dragged on until Sherlock regretfully told John he had a meeting to attend. John was loath to leave but he did so without fuss (and he was proud of himself for that). He left the guest suite and shut the door behind.
“Lots of naughty subs have felt this paddle and it’s made every single one cry. Since you only disobeyed me a little bit, I’ll make sure you don’t cry, but make no mistake,” he slapped the paddle against his palm. The clap! burst out and Sherlock startled. “You will be sore.” John took him by the forearm and sat on the edge of the bed. He pulled him down, mindful that he couldn’t balance as well without the complete use of his arms, and adjusted him over his lap. His prone body was supported by the bed and he was resting on his bent elbows.
The thought of the concubine made that hard, tight thing inside of his chest loosen and calm. They had talked for hours about this, that, and nothing at all. They dozed side by side and John left when the candle clock read five and sky was turning grey with dawn. He'd squeezed Sherlock's hand and wished him a good day before slipping silently out of the room like memories of a pleasant dream burned away by sunlight.
“Oh?” Sherlock glanced back up. “You don’t mind me practicing on you? Won’t that ruin the final effect?”
“Something like that. I do hope they catch the killer soon and bring that boy some justice.”
Sherlock continued, “we’re here with the Inspector trying to find the person responsible for killing those subs.” He turned to Blair, “you’re clearly his dominant.”
Of course, Sherlock gave the sofa arm another almighty kick.
to walk in on me fucking your brother.”
Sherlock bit his lip. "I, no, that’s not what I—” he rolled his eyes. “May I kiss you?"
“Yes, yes. Thank you for the meal, Betsy.” He nodded graciously and grabbed his coat, sweeping out the front door.
"Mycroft is making me go to Hibern with him." He grumped. He settled back in his chair, legs out straight in front of him. The blanket was soft on his bare shoulders and the fire was warm. He was starting to feel better, sleepy with food in his stomach.
He was far less interested in the 'why' of it all. He was royal and thus a target. Jim ruled with an iron fist and groups like John's highwaymen hellbent on Jim's demise bubbled up all over Hibern. These groups existed in Britannia as well (there was always someone who opposed the crown) but it wasn't nearly as heated as the climate in Hibern. Funny how treating your subjects well made them less likely to want to kill you.
"It's fantastic!" John breathed.
He rolled over and pulled at the man, encouraging him to come closer. John seemed surprised, but he tentatively scooted closer and Sherlock cuddled his dom, tucking his face down into the crook of John’s neck and fitting their legs together. This was much better.
“Fine, fine. Eat with us, then work on your case.”
He jogged back upstairs with the food and found Sherlock in the kitchen. He was wearing his sleep trousers and his dressing gown, standing in front of the near-boiling kettle. His thumbs were flying over his phone.
The mere sight of John was enough to dispel the brief flash of fear. A grim smile graced the shorter man’s face and he had an eyebrow cocked in both sternness and amusement. His eyes were twinkling with delight and Sherlock smiled, relieved and excited.
Sherlock snorted in laughter, but it felt good to hear him say that.
it is that you get from being immobile.”
Sherlock looked at him like he was a moron. “You honestly expected me to panic?”
“No.” Lestrade said.
Sherlock sighed and reached for his phone. Now that it was finally coming out into the open, he was relieved. He was also slightly terrified. He had no idea how John would react. The worst thing that could happen would be that John would leave him. If he suspected Sherlock was cheating, he could be gone with the wind.
“Yes. Like this on you…” Sherlock rubbed his hand over John’s chest, fingering the buttons on the suit. He touched the waistcoat and rested his hand on the hard bulge in John’s trousers. He dropped to his knees before his dom and unzipped his trousers.
“Like a little gift.” John pushed into the kitchen and set the cooler down on the table.
“The nightmare still?”
John nodded.
He may as well have not even been speaking. He had his gun drawn and glanced frantically between John and Sherlock. If he went near the sub to help, John would probably attack. But if he did nothing, John would probably kill Logan.
“It’s a waste of time.”
"Prince Sherlock left last night, John. Late. He went back to Britannia."
“No!” John shouted. He stepped towards his sub and pointed at him. “He is a
“Never ever delete those steps—Ow!”
John didn’t have to wait long to see the hierarchy in action. Since he was new to the herana, he anticipated the others might take an interest in him. After breakfast on John’s first morning, Buck put his foot out as John walked past. He stumbled.
Sherlock smiled. “They don’t usually involve cab drivers with a death wish and a dash over the rooftops.” He paused. “Or someone saving my arse.”
“Well, that you have. Water?”
Sherlock wanted to haul John to bed, tear his meager clothes off and demand to be fucked. He wanted to tuck John away, safe and sound and keep him from harm. He wanted to take him apart piece by trembling piece. He wanted to learn all of John's sweet spots and learn all the things that would make him shudder, gasp, cry out, and shiver. He wanted to feel John inside of him, filling him, fucking him. He wondered how John would sound, what noises he would make, how he tasted. He wanted to learn everything there was to learn about this magical, wonderful man. Oh how he wanted.
“Rotate your foot. Tell me if it’s tight.”
He looked down at John, peaceful and quiet at his knee. He wasn’t sure what to do now. He didn’t want to do something wrong and pull John out of subspace, but he didn’t want him bored down there either. Although, Sherlock reasoned he was never bored when he was spacing. He had half a mind to Google something but John lifted his face out of his leg and wormed his way up to the sofa. Sherlock pushed his computer onto the table when John curled around him in a little horseshoe shape, his side over Sherlock’s thighs and his knees tucked up against the back of the sofa. He rested his head on the pillow under Sherlock’s other arm and let out a long deep sigh, going still.
. Do you have any idea how worried I was?!”
"When was your last tetanus jab?" John asked.
"Uh-huh." He could hear her eyebrow rise. "And I'm the Queen of Britannia. To bed with you. I'll send for Healer Stamford."
John nodded and pulled off his own gown and then slid under the covers with his sub. Sherlock lay on his side where there weren’t any wounds and John tentatively rested his hand on his unmarked hip. Sherlock took a deep breath, enjoying the strong familiar scent of his dom. His cock was hard and red and his whole body was flushed and tense.
you how to cut up a beast.” Sherlock shifted in the metal chair, enjoying irritating the suspect. Really though, if he couldn’t be arsed to even speak correctly, how did he expect to get out of prison? He adjusted his scarf and a pleasant waft of the scent of John’s undershirt that he’d nicked before his flight grazed his nose, just enough to make him think of his dom again, home in the warm bed. Alone. He’d woken to see Sherlock off, even making him a big paper cup of coffee to have in the cab to Heathrow. The detective had sipped it gratefully in the car and had been more touched by the gesture than he cared to admit.
"I don't love that you're hurt."
“A wealthy dom, perhaps?” Sherlock looked at one of the receipts. “Ah, a Vincent Coel paid with a credit card at
grateful that his beloved sub had come back safe and sound. Christ, just the thought that he would be out there somewhere getting hacked up. Bleeding and hurt…
He could practice his oral skills. He wanted to get good at pleasuring John but he was unused to the size of his cock. Surely he could practice with a dildo and some stretching exercises. There
"Yeah. Listen, Mrs. Hudson is part of a book club and they're doing this thing in December where they read a book every week. Like an extra challenge."
Harry rolled her eyes.
"Hey, John." Greg muted the television.
John stared at him blankly. Sherlock was sure this had been a terrible idea.
“Here.” A tall man with grey stubble and a weather-worn face stepped forward, giving the body another disgusted gaze.
“I was just trying to help.” John added. He felt he should say more, but Sherlock clearly was done with him, so he left the room and the acidic detective therein with his head held high.
"Sherlock!" She shouted over the whining strings.
Mike had a thought. “Why don’t you come to Bart’s with me after this? Check out the old stomping grounds for old time’s sake?”
“Oh, God…oh I’d almost forgotten how good this feels…”
Sherlock blinked. "That's preposterous. That‒no."
“Just, tell me what happened. From the beginning.” The puff of warm breath crystallized in front of Sherlock’s face as he watched Mr. Berwick—a dominant— fidget in the chair across from him at the rickety table.
She looked at his thin face and prominent collar bones. His eyes were dull and flat. The bruise on his eye was turning greenish and his lip was scabbed dark with blood.
“Fine.” Sherlock strode off and John rolled his eyes fondly. Sherlock was adorable when he was on the hunt, all enthusiasm and bright intelligence. He was proud of him too.
“We were dating.” She said in a croaky voice. “He had just broken up with David, and…” her eyes filled and she dabbed at them, “and we were just…” she started crying harder, “I loved him. He was the one, you know? We would have been married.”
“Just to be absolutely certain….” He mumbled. His phone chimed.
Mel's straight-laced little submissive sister who got good grades and played football on occasion and dabbled at the trumpet before telling the lawyer anything. When he'd agreed to investigate, he expected to come up with a body and the usual bad news about a young life cut tragically short and he could tell that's what Mel was expecting as well. "Good girl turned druggie jewel thief" hadn't been on anyone's radar.
“Your attitude.” Mycroft said dryly.
“Did he hurt you?”
John jerked awake in Sherlock’s wide bed, panting with fear. Christ. He rubbed a shaky hand over his face and chest, still trying to wipe the phantom blood from his clothes.
John sat crossed legged on the floor in front of the green chair. He threw some pillows in front of him and Sherlock knelt down.
“No it isn’t. You’re going to get sausages and beans, a piece of toast with jam and two eggs over easy. Tomatoes on the side.”
Sherlock nodded. He looked down, suddenly ashamed.
“No.”
John couldn’t really find a reason to argue with that, and he certainly didn’t mind spending so much time at 221. He wondered if Sherlock would ask him to move in soon. He practically lived here anyway. That was a big step though, one John didn’t want to broach with him yet. Sherlock valued his independence, that much was obvious, and he might prefer John to have his own space. They hadn’t even been dating for two months but John realized he was ready. If Sherlock asked, he would move no question. Moving in together meant sharing a bed with him every night, which would naturally lead to sex.
“Who is it?” Sherlock asked.
John thought, his heart skipping disappointedly in his chest.
John took a deep, annoyed breath.
"Why hello
“Are you up to talking for a bit?” Greg asked the detective, pulling a small black recorder out of his desk drawer. Donovan slipped into his office then, a pad of yellow paper and a pen in her hands. She gave Sherlock the tiniest smile. “Recovery going well?”
“I’m too big!” He yelped, nearly falling backwards.
“Oh great, thank you, Mrs. H.” John got up and flipped back the cloth, taking a thick chocolate chip muffin and biting into it. “This is amazing.” He mumbled.
"Yeah, coming." John stepped into the room in his terry striped dressing gown and gave Sherlock a naughty grin. "Started without me?"
“Were the organs removed prior to his death?” Sherlock asked.
John piled the bandages together and grabbed a few more packets of ointment. He stuck it all into a plastic bag and turned to his sub.
switch and flipped that. I mean, I was still definitely a sub, but now…I pictured him on his knees in front of me and I couldn’t believe how pleasing that idea was. I had never ever considered or imagined anyone kneeling for me before. I couldn’t help but think of how sweet it would be to bind him and fuck his arse.”
He hadn't been very good at hiding his feelings about Sherlock. He was certain there was footage of them laughing together on breaks and helping each other out during challenges. More than once he'd noticed himself staring at the taller man with a great sodding smile on his face. He was pretty sure Sherlock had been checking him out here and there as well. He was vaguely worried about how the producers would edit this particular series. Would his idiot crush be obvious or ignored completely?
“John…” Sherlock mumbled.
"I would, but see, I'm married." Sherlock held up his left hand. The silver ring caught the light.
“John? What was it?”
“Give me—give us a chance.” John said. He licked his lips. “I know you just left a bad dom and if it’s too soon, I get it, but…I think this is worth trying.”
Twenty minutes later, John was taking his jacket off in Sherlock’s sitting room, the cooler on the floor by the door. “What’s that?” Sherlock asked, taking his coat and eying the little box. He didn’t have time to hear an answer though, as his phone rang and he lunged for it.
“It’s an experiment.” He said, shifting self consciously on the bed.
Seb looked at the leash and collar and made a face. “Oh look at you. Collared like a bitch.”
“What kinds of toys?”
“I’ll go with you.” John said, standing.
“My body always takes longer to catch up. It’s a side effect of my intellect.”
so upset about.”
There was a shove on his back and John flew out of the crowd and into Sherlock's arms. The detective had tears in his eyes and he planted a kiss on John's mouth. John kissed back, delighted and thrilled. He dipped Sherlock towards the grass and felt his hands clutch in his shirt. A new wave of cheers and hoots erupted from the crowd. John pulled them back up and they broke apart.
"Idiot! Yeast needs to be mixed with warm water to work! Do you have more yeast?"
John took him by the hand and brought him to the bed. He pulled back the blankets and Sherlock got in, burrowing under the covers. John sat on the edge of the bed and propped his ankle up on his knee, untying shoelaces. Sherlock reached out to touch his back, rubbing his hand up and down John’s checkered shirt as he pulled off one shoe, then the other and placed them together neatly on the floor. He slid into bed and Sherlock snuggled into his side, pushing his face against his neck and wrapping an arm around his chest. John slid his arm under him and pulled him closer in a half hug. Sherlock draped one leg over John’s and the doctor grinned in the dark. Lightning flashed and Sherlock sighed, content, his warm tea and mint breath tickling humid on his ear and neck. John stroked idly up and down his shoulder, just enjoying the closeness and the living, breathing warmth of being so near another person in bed again. It was nice having a sub in subspace so nearby again. He’d played in the army with some of the other medics or while on furlough, but it had never gotten as far as one of them being in subspace. It wasn’t allowed. There was even medication to prevent it. It would have been dangerous as hell if someone was far under and they came under attack. By his count, it had been at least eight years since he’d had a spacing sub under his watch. Jesus. He took a deep breath, tilting his head and kissing his forehead. Eight years in the army. Goodness.
Sherlock rolled up into a sitting position, absently rubbing his thigh for a moment, gaining his bearings. He wobbled a bit when he stood.
Sherlock finished the last vibrating note off the violin and let his right arm fall gracefully. He glanced at John's pasta and, quick as a snake, set the bow down and twisted John's fork so the speared ravioli popped into his mouth. John blinked, surprised. Sherlock winked at him and gulped it into his mouth and launched into a spirited "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing." John shook his head fondly as he finished off the food. Sherlock could be a right prick sometimes, but times like these more than made up for it.
"I, well, I was helping an injured baker."
“No, Sherlock. I won’t have it. I told you at the police station—no sub of mine is going to be rude.”
“No, sorry.” Callum said. “He’d kneel by her feet though.” He tapped the card. “Lucky bastard to get a dom like that.”
"I'm sick of all you idiots!" He shouted. He reached for his side table and hurled a decorative metal statue of a dog at the young man. His aim was off but the valet yelped and ran away. He must have fallen asleep because he awoke to the horrible noise of something banging on the fire grate. He growled and surged upright, staring at the back of the young servant girl clearing out the ashes in the hearth.
“How on earth did you work
Hello everyone! There's some miscommunication between Sherlock and John in this chapter. I have no idea if any readers will be triggered/bothered, but I'll be blunt while trying not to spoil: They have a scene. Things go somewhat wrong. These things will be resolved in some way before the story ends.
“Eat?”
“To see what you’d do. Where are they, Sherlock? If you don’t tell me, I’m afraid I’ll have to punish you.” John raised a brow at him. “Hm?” Sherlock’s cheeks colored and he looked away. John was tickled. “All trussed up like this, I could do anything to you. Anything at all.”
“Look how horny you are.” John glanced over his body with a feral smile on his face. Sherlock watched him in the mirror with wide dark eyes. “You made me so hot, squirming and moaning. Open your mouth.”
“I know, John!”
John couldn’t speak. If he opened his mouth the only thing that would come out would be a snarling, wretched wail. This was real. This was happening. There would be no one to run in, knives up and guns ablaze, to rescue him or his people. They were alone. He was alone.
"Nothing."
why‒"
“Get out of my head!” He growled. He ruffled his hands through his hair as if trying to scatter the memories.
“I thought I could get proficient so that I could make it feel better for you—”
Sherlock froze. He hadn't expected that.
“Acceptable.” Sherlock finally started eating, tucking in like a man starving.
“I’m done listening.” He grumbled into the cushion.
"Sure." John took the offered beer. “Betsy, do you need help?”
"Fine." He grunted. What choice did he have? Refusing to see a guest would lead to a beating. Sherlock though….his heart lifted before bitterness crushed it down. Sherlock was probably looking to get the sex he'd missed out on last night. Why else would he have requested him specifically?
They went out of the cave and mounted their horses. The other members of highwaymen were Jake, the twins Dot and Mot, Edgar, who had one eye, Peggy, young and firey, and Ivor, whose only English was "We hate King Jim." These were John's best raiders so the group was small tonight. He called attention and explained what was going to happen.
“Jooohn!” Sherlock twisted again, rolling completely onto his side, his arse away from John. This was
“Just seeing how you were.” Mycroft strolled down the hall, twirling his umbrella.
“That he buggered off after a killer—or got kidnapped.” John remembered the flirty chef and Sherlock’s unusual response to him. Could it be…?
He jerked awake, staring blindly around the dim bedroom. He saw the window and the armchair in the corner, but nothing looked familiar. There was a hand grabbing his good shoulder, insistently shaking him. He smacked it off with a raged growl and shoved the person beside him into the headboard. The wood bashed against the wall with a tremendous
"Hm? Jim?"
“Yes, yes.” Sherlock grumped. He’d heard all this before, of course. Saltpeter was an essential component of gun powder. Mycroft was determined to arm each soldier in Britannia with a pistol and obviously a gun was useless without bullets.
“John.” Sherlock leaned away from the microscope, staring at him. “I don’t know what what Mike is playing at, at being matchmaker or other—but I’m not interested. I’m not interested in having a dom right now—or indeed ever again, and even if I was looking, I would never choose someone like
“Go at your own pace. You’re doing perfectly.”
Sherlock stayed quiet.
“I like that you go into Defense when you see me threatened.” Sherlock admitted.
Sherlock sighed and rubbed his head.
Sherlock glanced at him curiously and beckoned him over. John shook his head. Sherlock mentally shrugged and then focused on the teen.
It was Sherlock's choice. The injuries were his own, not John's, and even though if it was up to him he would force Sherlock to go to the finest hospital in the world, in reality there was absolutely nothing he could make his sub do.
“Beautiful.” John straightened up and wiped the back of his hand over his mouth. Sherlock was panting and his nipples were two spots of red on his flushed chest. Perfect. John leaned down and grabbed a pin, opening it and closing it carefully over one rosy nub of skin. Sherlock hissed.
“John, right?” Lestrade said, crouching beside them. He was holding a paper cup of coffee and John’s mouth watered. “You bailed this one.” He nodded at Sherlock.
Sherlock kept talking. "I only got to see him a few times when I was there. I wanted to see him again, Mike, but I had to go. I broke my promise to him and John— he did
Sherlock relaxed slightly. It was true that the Palace was built on fertile grounds rich with forests, lakes, his bee hives, and his falcons. Contacts could come to him and even bring him the things he needed. But still.
“Nope.”
“Fine.” He said. He got off Sherlock and the detective leaped up, pulling his clothes back on and giving John a peck on the lips before he strode back to the sitting room. John scowled at the bed, but then chided himself for being selfish. Yes he wanted Sherlock all to himself to hold and kiss and cuddle and smack and hug and tie up all day long, but someone had
"Of course." John looked down, not wanting to maintain eye contact for too long. Some guests got upset about that. "You got all of that just from looking? It's amazing. It's quite…extraordinary."
"I can't take your bed."
“That sounds good.” John said in a throaty voice.
"Hey, stop that!" Sherlock snapped. He may as well have been shouting at a wall. The little horse bucked and lunged. Sherlock was an expert rider and had been in the saddle since before he could walk. He knew perfectly well how to tame an agitated mount. This horse, however, was clearly done with him and rather than risk a real, damaging fall, he took his feet from the stirrups and sort of half fell, half dismounted on the next buck. The horse lunged forward again and Sherlock landed flat on his arse in a puddle of mud between a wide oak tree and a log fuzzy with green moss. He grit his teeth as the chilled mud seeped up into his trousers. The horse trotted off and flung its head up, thrilled at the victory.
"You don't." She corrected. "Naughty boys who get high and worry us half to death don't get to have cake."
He closed the door behind the driver and saw John grinning down at his stuff. He slipped his hands around his doctor from behind and kissed his temple.
They both looked down at the limbs. Caucasian. Most likely male, from what he could tell. “What do we know?” John asked.
"‒Sherlock." Betsy interrupted. "Can you refill my wineglass, please?" She said please, but it was clear it was an order.
Sherlock did and he followed his dom down the hall to the loo. John ran a warm bath and helped his sub into the tub. The groan of pleasure from Sherlock’s mouth as he slipped into the steaming water was obscene and John took a deep breath as his brain pumped some more happy dom chemicals into his body. Sherlock was deep in subspace. He felt good and it was because John had put him there. Blue eyes peered up at him plaintively and he held out his hand. John crouched outside the tub and kissed his palm.
Mrs. Hudson popped into the kitchen with a plate of frosted biscuits.
on each cheek and then rubbed hard to get deep at the muscles. His actions weren’t entirely altruistic. Sure he was glad to take the pain away but he was having a great time grabbing John’s butt. He lifted his doms cheeks and saw the hint of hole. He licked his lips as excitement started to pool in his hips. It would be so easy to just slip in. He was inches away. He edged his fingers into John’s crack. The dom didn’t move. He trailed his index finger lightly over John’s hole.
John complied and stared down into the glass. His stomach was starting to feel better.
“What? He
"Thank God!" Mycroft snarled. He hung his head, composed himself again, and looked up. "Never again."
"Five thousand." Sebastian said.
“But?” John said.
"Hello." The young woman gave John a genuine smile. "I'm Molly Hooper. I'm one of the concubines here. What's your name?"
“Out!”
"None that I saw."
John sighed. "Stand up."
"‒those bruises are huge and you're getting x-rayed." John told him. "This isn't an argument or a request, Sherlock." His voice rose in volume. "You could have internal hemorrhaging or hairline fractures, or, or anything. You're getting looked at today whether you like it or not! This isn't an argument!"
Sherlock stared at the boring person and shut the door without a word. He groaned and stomped over the bed, collapsing into it in a heap. Why oh why did the world have to be so tedious?
"Sh…" John rubbed the back of Sherlock's sweat-dampened head. "Relax, love. I won't give you another until you relax." John stroked his dark curls, absently twining the soft strands around his fingers. He stood beside the bed, naked, leaned over his submissive. His cock was stiff and dark, brought to attention by the deliciously lascivious sight in front of him. The dark whip of the crop was clenched in his left fist. Sherlock was stretched out on their white duvet, naked and on his belly. His legs were spread, his ankles cuffed and chained to each end of the footboard. He hugged John's fluffy pillow, now wrinkled and damp with tears. His bum and thighs were slashed with pink splotches and faint red welts. His whole body was flushed and the air itself was ripe and heavy with musky arousal.
"And you promised him something?" She prodded gently.
He hung up.
“Anything you see that seems relevant—”
Sherlock, the genius arsehole, looked smug. "I tweaked it a bit."
“Yeah. You seemed kind of, well, concentrating. Didn’t want to disturb you.”
John felt something cold clip to the leather collar at his throat. “I’m going to keep you right here until I want to go again.” He pulled out of John’s body and he stifled a scream as the raw flesh pulled painfully.
“Not you.” Dimmock said.
Sherlock scowled harder into his cup.
didn’t even know then.” John murmured to him.
He gave him a tired smile and rested his head back on the seat. "Not bad yourself."
Sherlock tried to push past the guy‒likely the look out and meth supplier. "You really think so?" The guy cocked the gun, arms still outstretched. Sherlock stepped back.
John sighed. “Maybe.” He mumbled.
“Yes. You’re a doctor, you’re familiar with reading dead bodies. What do you think?”
The cameras were getting every second and John vaguely wondered where the medic had gone. The loo, maybe? He should have been up here by now. Another, more cynical thought popped into his head.
“This came out of the printer once you’d gone.” John held a piece of paper out to him. “It’s probably nothing, just the ‘page two of two’ of whatever it was that had you running out of here before. Did you want dessert?”
As soon as Sherlock snapped his fingers and tore everything off, John could see how much he wasn’t enjoying any of it. He wasn’t in subspace. He was hurt and frightened and the bitch of it all was that John had no one but himself to blame.
The argument had been simmering for days. Tetchiness on a case, followed by Sherlock stupidly endangering his own life once again, followed by John passive aggressively making himself dinner and not inviting Sherlock to eat, followed by body parts stores in unlabelled containers (something Sherlock knew John hated), eventually lead to a shouting match.
“Can I see?”
"Stop." John said. "She wasn't flirting. She knows we're together and she has a steady sub." John mouth twisted in disbelief. "Come on‒we're bloody married, she's a woman,
“No you don’t.” Sherlock said.
“Oh, giving me orders now? You
"Oh? They're leaving soon?" John's heart dropped to the floor.
“Lying to your dom is never a good idea, dear. You need minding.” She sipped.
was interesting….
He had his rescheduled appointment with Ella today, so he wanted to get some food in himself before he left. He made chicken and vegetable soup from scratch and while it was simmering, he headed to the loo to piss. He’d just unzipped when—
Sherlock didn’t answer, but he came sweeping back down the hall with his phone, stabbing out a harsh text and slamming the ‘send’ key. Moments later, the phone rang.
He argued with himself,
“Like it?” Sherlock wriggled and John palmed his bottom, grabbing two handfuls but letting go when Sherlock hissed. “Aw, hurts?”
The door unlocked and both men entered and headed for the stairs. John was grinning to himself, thinking about the roleplay, but Sherlock’s thoughts were elsewhere entirely. He’d looked up Vincent Coel’s address this afternoon, and he lived delightfully close to Mike’s. Lestrade had said he spoke with him, but Sherlock really wanted to talk to him himself and pick up the pieces Lestrade undoubtedly missed. He had a plan to speak with him, a plan that John
"Oh we both know that's not true."
“I have to go to work soon, love.” He poured himself some coffee.
“Oh yeah?” Lestrade looked up at her. “Is it a nice area? I’ve never been.”
If anyone's interested...I had a specific MF face in mind as John's 'dom face'. It's the top one in this gifset:
Sherlock knew who the killer was the moment he stepped on the messy scene. A young male dom sprawled dead on the wooden floor. Bloody footprints—men’s, size ten work boots—everywhere. Furniture was overturned. Pillows were ripped and broken glass was thrown across the floor. A brunette woman standing off to the side, away from most of the debris, was sobbing her heart out into a tissue. Freshly graduated barrister, bilingual, blue leather collar, sub. Sherlock spoke to her first. “How did you know him?”
“What’s your name?”
“It sounds like you had a busy day.” John said.
“I think I learned my lesson.”
"Please tell me. If it's important to you then I want to know."
Some of the tension bled out of John’s shoulders and he turned away from the stairs to face him. “Yes, you are.” He kissed him on the lips.
Ash grey clouds crowded the sky the morning of the Holmes’ departure for Hibern and pellets of frozen rain clattered on the ground. Sherlock and Mycroft saw the weather from behind the plates of glass in their heated carriage as they were transported down to the docks to board their respective ships. The carriage, roomy though it was, was crowded with both brothers and their personal guards: Greg Lestrade was here for Mycroft and Sally Donovan was acting as Sherlock’s personal guard. Sherlock and Mycroft faced each other, their guards on either side.
"Bake!"
"Not really." The man paused. "I'm here for work, actually."
“Yes. So?”
"New one. Direct from the King."
That hadn’t been enjoyable. He wasn’t
“Oh, your obliques and latissimus dorsi are sore.”
“John?” He heard behind him. He stopped, then frowned as a man he didn’t know bustled up to him.
Jamie kept him pinned down until police arrived, and Dimmock was less than impressed to see him.
"I will, John." They split apart and John didn't have time to say anything before Mrs. Hudson tugged him into her arms.
“John?” A hesitant voice made him stop his angry stomps. Mrs. Hudson was at the bottom of the steps in a pink dress and slippers. Her flat smelled like sweet cake and he could hear voice inside. She had friends over. The doctor instantly felt bad for disturbing them all, not to mention horribly embarrassed that strangers had overheard their fight.
“Didn’t care for them?”
"Thanks." John said. He looked to his sub. "Ready to go?"
The detective sat up and pulled his laptop onto his thighs and clacked away, his hand coming back and now and then to stroke John or rub his shoulder or simply rest in his hair as he read a webpage. After half an hour of comfortable silence, Sherlock wondered if he should have John do something else. He wasn’t in the mood for tea or coffee. Would John want to be hit? He frowned and looked down at the man at his knee. A few marks always helped him nudge further into subspace, but John seemed to be doing fine on his own. He wasn’t sure how hard to hit. His dom wasn’t one of the corpses in the morgue that could unlimited blows. How many hits could John take? He didn’t want to hurt him. How did John know how many times to whip him with the crop or smack his bottom? He supposed that’s what the safeword was for. If John’s judgment was incorrect and Sherlock wanted the activity to stop, then he could stop it. He, the submissive, had the control.
“The murderer is out there—”
“Congratulations.” He nodded at the new accessory.
"Ooohh!" Her eyes went wide.
“Are you tired?”
“John—” Sherlock said as the doctor whirled towards the door and threw it open. “Christ, you’re like a wild animal.”
“Eggs. Sausage.”
John gave him a quick kiss on the lips. “If you can’t use your feet correctly, you don’t get to use them at all.”
Perhaps he could just make himself readily available sexually. John liked sex. A lot. He was already available though. He enjoyed having sex with John and he already let the doctor do all kinds of things to him.
“There we are.” He set them and the chain on the table.
?” Mycroft asked in a drolling tone that John really didn’t want to deal with now.
make you focus.”
“Anthony loved me.”
It was then that John noticed some glass tubes and a magnifying lens beside the platters. One tube was filled with water and the others contained something yellow and green, respectively. There was an odd contraption about twenty centimeters tall on the table that looked like a small brass telescope bolted to a stand and aimed at a little gold platform. John stared at it, wondering what on earth it was.
