"Yes, an old soul indeed. You're still a young man, yet you find yourself drawn exclusively to music from decades ago and nothing remotely current. Why is that?" Sherlock stepped even closer, his eyes flitting across Johns face. John looked slightly wary in return. "You prefer this music because it represents a simpler time in your life. It takes you back to the music you grew up listening to, back when your family was happy, before the bitter divorce, the out of control drinking of your younger sister that drove another wedge between the family, and the war that left you with an intermittent tremor in your left hand, and a slight psychosomatic limp. Which used to be more pronounced and in need of a cane, going by the way your hand hangs there, as if searching for something to hold, and the slight hitch in your hip as if you're used to leaning on something. But that's all resolved now."
Mycroft took note of the conventionally attractive Hollywood blonde who was seated behind a clear desk, staring seriously into the camera as if she was about to impart some legitimate breaking news about war torn Syria or blow the Trump-Russian collusion scandal wide open, instead of what she was there to do.
"Oh, I didn't really hear most of it, but it looked like he got into a row with Henry, and their rows are usually about one thing. Sherlock coming out. Specifically, Sherlock not coming out. I told Henry to give that shit a rest but he's gotten all socially aware lately, on this big "the world needs more out gay singers" tip, and likes to push him about it. Bloody annoying."
"Best new artist Grammy." Sherlock cut the silence, affecting an air of boredom. He felt a small bit of satisfaction at how it made John jump and continued on. "Do you know how many winners of that award go on to linger in obscurity? It's more of a curse to win it than an honor really."
The bar was packed, and he was accosted by several people who wanted to chat, take selfies, or buy him a shot. He didn't refuse the shots, for that would be poor form indeed, and after slamming back a Jaeger Bomb or two (absolutely vile) he stumbled his way back to John, pleasantly buzzed.
"Well can you at least promise I won't end up lying dead in a skip somewhere?" John shot out, exasperated. For all intents and purposes, he should be flaming mad by now--and he was--but there was also a tingling thrill of anticipation coursing through him. Excitement. Danger. He hadn't experienced this feeling since Afghanistan. His left hand was completely still on his thigh.
But no matter how good Sherlock was, no matter how he attended each and every session as promised, and did his duty like a good little popstar, a part of him wanted to tell everyone to piss off, become unfindable for the foreseeable future and figure out how the hell he was going to fix this problem.
Mycroft couldn't begin to understand the things that went on inside an artistic mind, let alone one gifted with the maddening genius that was Sherlock, but he endeavored to try. "Is this loudness the catalyst for your change in behavior?"
A high pitched, almost cartoonish male voice asked in a mocking way over the dim mobile phone footage of two hulking guys, the words "SECURITY" emblazoned upon their backs in bold white block lettering, as they held a much smaller figure down onto a dirty sidewalk.
"Seriously? You hike for thirty minutes and this is how you repay your lungs? Do you even know the horrible shit that are in those things?"
"Sounds like a lot of pressure to put on someone's shoulders." John scratched at the back of his head. "How old is your brother?"
The session wrapped at about two in the morning; they all seemed rather pleased with the results of the night, and as they said their goodbyes, Nikki bounded up to John and gave him a big hug, exchanged numbers, and told him to give her a ring sometime if he was bored and needed someone to show him the town, or get a drink with. Sherlock rolled his eyes and left for the waiting car, leaving him to catch up.
Sherlock knew he was being a brat, he knew it and hated it, but he couldn't bring himself to stop. His head was louder than it had ever been, and when he tried to sleep at night his thoughts crashed into each other, and seemingly made a physical whooshing sound inside him, as if he'd held a seashell up to his ears. He felt hopeless.
"You seem to like them enough to display them." John volleyed his back, his tone light and teasing. "And I can see how this big and beautiful house is a burden indeed."
"Hey," She said breathlessly, pushing through the crowd to sidle up next to him. "John, right?" She looked unsure if that was his name, though she knew very well why he was there. Sally was every bit the Hollywood type. Young, beautiful, with kohl rimmed eyes, and a crop top showing off a sliver of toned belly.
Ugh. Sherlock stood up, made a frustrated grunt, and tore off towards the other side of the club. Sherlock was livid, at himself, at Henry, at his life, at everything and everyone. This was not what he needed right now, not after all the shit with his music and with John, and the emotions were just too much to fucking handle. This was one aspect of his life, while not ideal, had always been under control. It had been manageable, and he didn't need heart to hearts or guilt trips about it, no matter how well meaning they might be.
"Not really into what the kids are listening to." John chuckled. "My tastes run more to jazz, Motown, and prog rock bands from the seventies and eighties. I'm what you would call out of touch."
I know we are all HEARTBROKEN over Sherlock's flounce from social media but that just means it's time for all of us to stay strong and band together. Also, our lovely moderator HolmesIsWhereTheHeartIs has an extensive archive of ALL of Sherlock's now deleted Instagram posts(as well as an archive of his tweets) and is in the process of putting those up shortly. YAY!
Sherlock had kissed him. Sherlock was gay (or bi, or pan or who knows really?) and had kissed him right on the mouth. Just thinking those words was enough to make John laugh out loud in the quiet room.
Sherlock sat with his feet dangling into the pool, nursing a beer and ignoring every one of his guests who made eye contact with him or tried to start up a conversation. It was painful just to have so many people over, making a mess and being generally annoying, and there was only a handful he found tolerable enough anyways. One of them was Henry, who was busy chatting with some friend of a friend Sherlock barely knew (it was obvious they were currently discussing him, going by the looks thrown his way, and surely this meant some other pointless drama was about to unfold) and the other, Sally, had disappeared shortly after they'd arrived.
Mycroft assured him that it was under control at the moment; Sherlock hadn't been causing any trouble, and they would just have to sit tight for the time being, until he was needed. Maybe they won't need me after all and I'll be sent back, John wondered, and the thought left him uneasy.
Yeah, just to say don't always believe what you read in the gossip rags, and keep an eye out for some new music, which is really what we're all here for, no? Trust me you will not be disappointed.
"So, let them then." A deep, haughty voice replied from the other line. "Let them unleash the hounds of hell upon me for all I care." He sniffed.
"... other candidates, but your skill set matches best with our needs. A doctor and a soldier. We are incredibly lucky to have found you Doctor Watson."
A series of images flickered across the screen behind the unnecessarily dramatic voice over, and it took all his strength not to turn away from the screen in disgust. Clips of a younger Sherlock, about sixteen, all bright eyes and dark floppy curls, looking impossibly innocent and smiling lopsided grins in front of seas of screaming and crying teen girls, were interspersed with pictures of an older, harder Sherlock. The hair was still floppy, the girls were still there, but this time they were on his lap, scantily dressed and taking shots, all while he smirked at the camera as if to say, 'I dare you'. And the light was completely gone from his eyes.
"My Dad loved this album. Played it to death every time he got into one of those moods. You know, one of those 'my life didn't work out exactly the way I planned and now it's time to escape' moods." John looked wistfully upwards, as a hand scratched at his stomach. "So basically, every bloody day."
"Oh, right. Yea. I've actually known Sherlock since school and he likes to keep his inner circle tight, with people he's comfortable with." She fidgeted for a minute, then leaned closer. "Hey, look I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention to Sherlock what I, you know, let slip. It's not my place and..."
The splash of someone diving into the pool, combined with the sound of the front door opening, slamming into the wall, and a male voice with a heavy southern twang shouting out "Howdy, howdy! Let's get rowdy, rowdy!" like some sort of bad movie catchphrase, shook him out of his trance, and made him turn around to see Sherlock entering behind a rather handsome and very well sculpted man in what the Americans called a "wife beater" and a pair of cowboy boots.
They headed back to the house well after midnight, but neither were the least bit tired. Well, Sherlock wasn't. He was in that weird state after a night out where he still had a reserve of pent up energy wanting to be expelled, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to dance, shoot the walls, or go running around the block screaming at the top of his lungs. John, however, simply had a glassy look in his eyes and all he seemed to want to do was eat.
Soon after another conversation with Mycroft in which he complained about his lack of purpose, he decided to be proactive. He did some research into some of the haunts Sherlock liked to frequent, and gave them each a visit, making friends with the bouncers (several were ex-military so that was easy) and did his best to convince the management not to allow Sherlock into their establishments. That was an idea doomed from the start; as Sherlock's presence gave them notoriety and brought in clientele--aka money--there was no way they were going to deny him access. The bar tenders were more agreeable though, especially when given generous tips(courtesy of Mycroft's bank account), and several agreed not to serve Sherlock.
"We both know that will never come to pass. It's an empty threat you trot out every time your emotions run amok. Music is too important to you to leave it behind."
"That was amazing!" John turned, a bit breathless, and his face was so close. The way the stage lights made his eyes sparkle was too much to take. Sherlock was so fucking screwed. Without preamble, Sherlock turned and made his way back to the bar for another drink, leaving John standing there, watching him disappear into the crowd.
“Right then, up we get!” he croons to Rosie, the little girl giggling from her spot, strapped into her portable car seat. “Ready to see Uncle Sherlock?” Grabbing her overnight bag in one hand and the car seat in the other, John nudges the door open the rest of the way, nodding to the chauffeur and passing the bag to him before turning and closing and locking the front door.
“Nothing. Happened,” John replies, his stance straightening in defiance. He will not let Mycroft bully him like this, he cannot let the man blame him every time Sherlock takes an unprecedented tumble into oblivion. “Is that what you think, hmm, that I’m the sole cause? You don’t have the right-!”
“Sherlock Holmes, I love you. Will you accept me as your friend, your lover, your confidante? Will you grant me this wish, for all I ask is that you be mine?”
"There's more to labels that just plain old 'gay' and 'straight', Sherlock. Surely you know that?" John teases, his tongue darting out to lick his lips, Sherlock both loves and loathes when John does that with his tongue. "I'm bisexual. 'Gay' just isn't quite the most accurate term to describe who I am."
John’s eyes are widened almost comically, though nothing about that moment is funny. His jaw is clenched, his hands in tight fists against the sides of his body, his forehead creases visible. Sherlock thinks he can see a vein angrily pulsing in John’s temple, and he is not surprised when he finds himself overwhelmed with the need to crowd the older man into his arms and assure him that whatever he’s seen is not actually there, that he is only imagining it.
“Oooooh,” John moaned, eyes wide open in pleasure as he widened his stance to adjust to the feel of the plug inside him, nudging his prostate and sending shockwaves through his entire body. Sherlock removed his fingers, wiping them on his own trousers before caressing the doctor’s sides, soothing him, suckling on John’s neck, waiting for him to relax.
“Why do you keep saying that?” the baritone voice replied, quieter than before. “I am anything but.”
Anyway. When I'm down, the fluff (ALL THE FLUFF) comes out to play, so there you go dear lovely readers, FLUFFY JOHNLOCK. TOOTH-ROTTING FLUFF ALERT.
“God, Rosie, shhh,” John sobs, trying to calm her down, but it isn’t helping things, is it, to be about to go into full panic mode, himself? He walks about, rocking her, praying that the motion will soothe both of them, and eventually Rosie’s cries turn into wet whimpers, and he walks up the stairs to her bedroom.
The two men stand there, wound around each other for what seems like ages until they hear the unstable pitter-patter of tiny hands and knees approaching them, quickly followed by a tiny grabby hand latching onto Sherlock’s leg, followed by John’s, and finally with a mildly entertaining huff, Rosie pulls herself up and starts demanding in her baby talk as to
Sherlock groans, already dreading bumping into his landlady and having her gush to him how happy she was that the two of them had finally ‘
!”s, a moment later, his heart stutters in its beating as a familiar hand comes into contact with his back, right over where his frantic heart is.
John swallows around the hard lump in his throat, flicking the bottle open to pour some lube down Sherlock's exposed cleft and some on his own neglected cock. He groans at the sensation; seeing Sherlock's pink hole presented to him only serves to ramp up his need for release. Tentatively, he slides his forefinger past the ring of muscle, breath hitching as it pushes in with no resistance.
“John. Thank you for letting me have this. I love you,” Sherlock whispered, loud enough for John to catch.
I was thinking of maybe doing a 30 days of porn series sometime soon so you lovely people have new content from me in between waiting for updates for this story. What do you guys think? Or should I do an omegaverse fic? Will anyone be interested? :)
“I know it’s fine,” Sherlock recites, the fact that they’re replaying that first night sending an odd thrill through him. He takes a deep audible breath, gripping tight to the hand clasped in his. “In fact, I might have a boyfriend, yeah.”
, Sherlock-“ John’s eyes widen at that, quickly moving to close that gap between them, wanting badly to take it all back and start all over again.
“Ah yes, won't be a moment,” John giggles, straightening his torso and sitting low on Sherlock's thighs. He pulls off his jumper and button down, flinging them in the general direction of the floor. As he gets to work on the button and fly of his jeans, a cursory glance back at Sherlock's face only makes him speed up, shifting his legs to get his pants off as well.
John swallows around the tightness in his throat, his next words dying on his tongue, because it hurts, boy it hurts, because what Mycroft just said is nothing but the truth.
,” Sherlock purred, lips brushing the soft lobe of his partner’s ear. He nudged forwards just a little more, bringing his groin flush against John's arse.
John, seems to have worked it out all by himself and instead appears to be on the verge of another nervous breakdown as he says, “
In John’s eyes, it starts with Sherlock’s forgiveness, and while the man in question has readily bestowed it upon him, John is still unable to accept that Sherlock was so quick to grant him absolution when, by right, after all the hurt that John has dealt him, forgiveness should be the last and hardest step on the road to reconciliation.
“You forget, Sherlock, that I can appreciate aesthetic beauty, be it man or woman, and Mrs Roberts was such a pretty thing too-”
Sherlock snaked a hand down to wrap around both of their cocks, cursing under his breath at the shock wave that shot up his spine, leaving him breathless with anticipation. The sensation quickly became too much too fast, and he released his hold quickly, placing a light kiss on John's swollen lips before sliding down, taking a moment to lick around and into John's belly button, fully aware of which spots on John's body usually brought on sensory overload.
It took all of his willpower to pull away, pulling the older man to his feet, leaning down to rumble directly into John's ear. “Not yet, John, not until I have you riding my cock.”
Rosie barely put up a fight as he shushed and gently lowers her onto her little bed, her eyes already heavy-lidded and her lips suckling her right thumb. John tucks her in all tight and warm, his heart thudding in his chest as he thinks,
“Okay.. okay.” John gives two small stuttering nods. He knows that he has to take this slow, that taking care of Sherlock is his top priority. He has been hinted here and there that Sherlock has close to nil experience in intimate relations, let alone romantic attachments with anyone else, and that if he and John were to do
Instead, Sherlock settles for standing still, waiting to see what John will do next, now that he has seen damning evidence of all Sherlock had let himself suffer through if it meant that he could keep his friends safe.
, John groans, inwardly. It takes him a while to register that Rosie is wailing now, and John himself is a mess of tears and shaking sobs. He stands, trying to shush his frightened daughter, his salty tears running down his cheeks and settling in her soft hair, where her head is tucked underneath his chin.
Two days later, John is just getting off the phone with Marlene, informing her of his impromptu weekend away, when he hears the curt knocking of the front door.
Sherlock let out an embarrassingly loud moan, and proceeded to flip sunny side up and haul the doctor up and on top of him, naked crotch coming in direct contact with denim-clad one, eliciting combined groans; it didn’t take long for them to start rutting against each other. Sherlock held onto the arm rest beneath his head for dear life, and John held onto Sherlock, his jeans already open and the hot, hard length of him sliding against Sherlock’s healthy erection.
Maybe Sherlock’s brain had gone offline without warning, because the next thing he knew, John is kissing the knuckles of his right hand, the touches featherlight and all-consuming.
: Just got off the phone with Jeanine. She will do the best she can to bury this press wise but says the only way to truly fix this is an intervention. Or an asteroid. To obliterate the earth. Other than that, just hope for a bigger story to blow this off the front page.
"Danger time? Hmm, and why would you think that? My brother has been exceptionally well behaved lately."
As the door continued to swing farther open, John was met with even more to take in. The back of the wall which had been exposed, and a good expanse of the wall behind the bar, was dotted with shiny plaques and what looked like silver and gold records encased in thin glass. There was even a gold statuette on the edge of the bar and...
In the beginning Sherlock had been a peculiar child, quiet, socially awkward at times and prone to bouts of intense ennui that often manifested in saying quite cruel things and throwing epic tantrums, but all of that was before he found music. Afterwards, the worst behavior he had been capable of was staying up all hours, writing song after song and banging away on the grand piano his parents had bought especially for him. Or there were the days he would screech away on his violin, his green eyes manic, as he proclaimed he was writing the world's greatest symphony, a symphony that would never come to fruition as, such was the case, his mind would eventually be taken up with some other endeavor and the whole thing would be forgotten. But that was alright, that was more than fine. Sherlock's childish flights of fancy were his way of "quieting his brain" or however he liked to put it at the time. Sherlock had always possessed an intelligence and an energy that, if left unchecked, could surely run roughshod over everyone and everything, but it had always been contained. Controlled. His parents had once called music a godsend when they had seen how Sherlock had taken to it, how his chaotic mind had found refuge in simple things like melody and harmony and musical scales and singing.... oh the singing was beautiful.
Never had he craved oblivion so much as he did right then, and he let his shame and righteous indignation lead him to the men's room, where after a brief stall check, he locked the door, took out a small pocket mirror, credit card, and his trusty twenty dollar bill. He dumped the baggie onto the mirror, cut it into equal lines, and began to snort.
Ah, yes. To be honest I am glad we are discussing this because the reports of his behavior over the last few months seem to have gotten out of hand. I've known Sherlock since he was 15, and he's a good kid. Well, now he's a man--my how time flies--but it still holds true. I can't imagine what it's like living under a microscope though, where everything you do is observed and picked apart and judged, and have there been some incidents that weren't so great? Yea of course. But look, there's a difference here between blowing off a little steam and a full on break down, and I can assure you that's not the case. A few out of control nights, who hasn't had that (laughs) in their lives? As for rumors of drugs, no. There's no way. Like I said, I've known him forever and I know how much he values his talent. I know this all sounds like some sort of PR blow off but there's no way Sherlock would be risking his future, and his love of music, so recklessly.
"Shit. He's just a kid!" John shook his head; he was barely able to make it to classes on time at that age, and definitely not mature enough to handle whatever Sherlock has to deal with. No wonder he was blowing off some steam.
"Yes, it is, in a manner of speaking, a job. You will be compensated and such, though I imagine it's quite different from what you're currently doing. But it will make better use of your talents than simply being a low man on the totem pole at St. Bart's."
Sherlock perked up a bit at that. How...unexpected. He ignored the way the words "ex-military" sent a tingle of excitement down his spine. This was not the time to give in to his baser instincts. Besides, he was more curious at why a doctor would take a job as some sort of live in minder to a celebrity. He knew Mycroft would compensate him well but, but it was a bit unorthodox. Unless he was one of those types, desperate for fame or to be near fame that they would take any of the scraps they could. He had met enough of those types to last a lifetime.
She seemed to consider this for a moment, before nodding in assent. She smiled, amused, and pocketed her phone, standing up with purpose. "My name is Anthea."
"The label wants to solve this Sherlock. You know they just want what's best for your career and they've assured me they support you one hundred percent in getting past all of this and moving forward."
Tonight, the social media-sphere was set abuzz by candid snaps of popstar Sherlock Holmes in what looks like to be a heated clinch, with backup dancer and Instagram model, Sally Donovan. The 20-year-old beauty, whose followers have reached one million since joining Sherlock's last world tour, posted a pic Saturday of herself, sitting on Sherlock's lap, in an almost kiss while looking into the camera. While it looks like all fun and games, sources say that the two have grown close, and their flirty behavior has grown into much more. Despite the reports of Sherlock's intense partying, and stories of his womanizing ways, sources say that the two are in a committed relationship and are "quite happy". While their couple hood is new, they aren't looking to put it under public scrutiny at this moment by making it official. It looks to us though, by these photos, that the two won't be able to keep their little love affair a secret for much longer!
John swallows around the sudden influx of saliva pooling in his mouth. He has seen his flatmate in various states of undress around the flat in the years they've lived together, but it is something else entirely when said flatmate is undressed
The two men stand there, in the heart of what used to be their home; two friends fighting to recover from what had to be n-th time their relationship was put to the test.
After the last update, my work life went haywire. The clinic I work at moved in to a new building, a multi-storey one, and coupled with moving all the equipment and handling the transfer of patients and running up and down one floor to the other, I found myself too worn out to sit in front of my laptop and churn out a chapter worth letting you guys read. It didn't help that the worst case of writer's block slammed its way into my head. I got flustered over nothing and everything and my anxiety and moodswings grabbed hold onto me and wouldn't let go.
Try as he might, John is not surprised to find himself falling into his old habits; It is as if he never left Baker Street in the first place. He prepares two cups of tea, sits in the familiar red armchair, and even opts to tap away at his laptop, helpfully brought over by Mycroft’s men.
Sherlock could feel John's cock already filling back to full mast, beating down the surprise at the nonexistent refractory period to make way to the self-satisfaction of potentially giving John his second orgasm in less than an hour. The movement of their bodies served to provide adequate friction to the erection sandwiched between them, prompting Sherlock to make the slightest angle adjustment, bringing the head of his cock to press against John's prostate with each thrust.
Well, he and John aren’t together yet, per se, but maybe after tonight, their relationship may - or may not - officially cross the threshold from platonic to romantic. Sherlock would be lying to himself if he says he didn’t feel any different at the thought of being in a romantic relationship with John.
Where his mind is concerned, deleting unnecessary bits and bobs of information is simple enough - all it requires is a cursory flick of the wrist, and the offending item is gone. It does not take much to rid his hard drive of rubbish. Sherlock quite enjoys the immense satisfaction of filling every nook and cranny of his mind palace with information the ordinary human mind wouldn’t even be capable of storing.
They come down from their high together; they shudder with oversensitivity, feeling each other’s rapid heartbeats, hands clasped tight, lodged between the mattress and Sherlock’s heart.
“No, no, I’m exactly where I want to be,” John says in a rush, eyes lowering in mortification. He cuddles his daughter close, breathing in her lovely baby scent, the warmth and weight of her in his arms doing wonders to his stammering heart.
Ivan shut his eyes, prepared to die.  But there was no pain.  Heat, certainly, and a sensation of being... stroked?  Ivan opened his eyes again and looked down at the flames twining around his bare ankles and calves, rising steadily.  Even as he watched a tendril of flame rose up to stroke the tender hollow behind one of his knees.  It was oddly pleasant.  And then something more than pleasant as the flames rose higher, licking and stroking the insides of his thighs, so that an answering heat began growing in his belly.
John resigned himself to the inevitable.  “All right.  I will stay up all night with you.  I will take the phone message for you.  But Sherlock?  If you attempt to leave this flat without first phoning the information in to New Scotland Yard, I will knock you down and
“Highly so. At least for all such catalysts discovered to date.  The topic is something of a Holy Grail for aspiring biochemists.”
Indeed Sherlock stalked forward until he was close enough to rub his baby bump against John’s stomach. Dizzy with desire, John pulled Sherlock’s head down for a kiss, neither short nor chaste.
Sherlock wanted another date. That was good. Sherlock probably wanted more time to research. Oh. Dating protocols.
More corridors.  Ivan was sweating in the heat now.  Then they hit a corridor Ivan thought he remembered.  And then, a staircase.
I am?  Look, you, I’ve been seen by the finest doctors in...” – the imperial court – “uh, that my father could hire...”
“There’s something else that should be obvious, but I’m going to say it anyway. Mary had no business saying what she did. This isn’t going to be her family. Her opinion doesn’t count.”
Sherlock refocused on John from whatever corner of his mind palace he’d begun to retreat to. “Yes.  Of course.  I always want tea when you make it.”
“Want your own bed to yourselves again? Yeah, I remember that feeling.” Lestrade chuckled. “If you don’t mind my asking, how are you handling nursing?”
John remembered the two skulls, bison and human.  Did Sherlock engage in some bizarre form of taxidermy?  As a hobby or a profession?
Brief silence. Then Sherlock rolled back and snuggled up against John. “I could tie you up?... Oh, you like that idea!”
Sherlock spent the better part of the next four days either in his mind palace or communing with his pile of purloined reprints and the pair of laptops, his own having joined John’s on the coffee table. John watched him jump from one machine to the other, audibly impatient when pages were slow to load.  Peering over Sherlock’s shoulder as he delivered tea, John caught glimpses of what appeared to be yet more journal articles, occasional media coverage and once, a statement of financial transactions embellished with dollar signs rather than pound symbols.  He decided not to ask about that last.
Molly turned pink and actually smiled a little.  Pretty woman, when she wasn’t dithering over Sherlock.  Pretty eyes, nice hair.
“Oi!” They both turned as Lestrade came up behind them.  “I just wanted to say thanks for coming out.  The thing is, the doc’s right, at least partly.  The threatening-message reports got side-tracked, and they shouldn’t have been.  That’s why I came myself on this one.”
Before, Sherlock had viewed everything around him in a calculating, disconnected manner. He’d driven everyone else away, thinking them inferior for dabbing in something as mundane as emotions. Even when he was consulting for the Yard, he’d struggled to understand the emotional drive of the most common of murders.
teacher, John!” -- and as the minutes pass, they are both getting dizzy with the need for air. The detective breaks away first. His eyes are blown, his lips reddened and there is a telltale flush to his cheeks.
John’s eyes are trained on him, fierce in its intensity, and something about it makes Sherlock want to run away and build his walls back up before either of them can do something they might later regret. Maybe John sees Sherlock’s building panic in his eyes too, because his grip on Sherlock’s bicep tightens ever so slightly and he keeps pulling Sherlock in until the taller man has no choice but to lean in and stand still as John’s arms lift and wrap around him in a hug that feels neither firm nor reluctant; It is as if John wanted to give Sherlock the choice to pull away and reject the embrace.
He squeezes a dollop of lube onto his palm. Hand hovering in between their slick bodies, John takes a moment to take stock of Sherlock's shivering body and the hands that don't quite seem to know where to go.
Sherlock never asked for a best friend all his life, never thought himself deserving of one after all he’d been through. But John had limped his way in. Insignificant, weary, unassuming,
“Holy fu-!” John hollered into Sherlock’s neck, mouthing at his clavicle, inhaling the scent of their lovemaking. Sherlock grinned into the blonde man’s hair, nudging his face up to lock their lips once more, this time round tender and slow as the two men took a moment to bathe in the intimacy and closeness of the position.
He’d told himself that the only way they could pull themselves out of this mess was if Sherlock got rid of the feelings he’d let break through his mental defences. Moving to lay himself on his back on the sofa, Sherlock adopts into the familiar position with his hands steepled under his chin, and delves into the most hidden corners of his mind palace, uncovering every single memory of John he’s kept thus far.
If the fact that Sherlock has archived each and every moment he’s spent in John’s presence, no matter how small or big,
They are each other's better half, each other's best friend. Partners for life, essentially, in every sense of the word.
Encouraged by this, John rubs the tips of his middle three fingers along the sensitive skin of the perineum, from just below the wrinkled skin of Sherlock's balls to the edge of the furled rim of his entrance. Back and forth he goes, applying a gentle pressure on the skin at random intervals while Sherlock continues pushing forwards to press his hard length against John's thigh and backwards against John's hand to seek out more of those teasing touches.
and random facts about a case or two that he was working on. The last text he'd received had been so out of the blue that John still doesn't know what to think of it.
Mycroft clears his throat from behind him, and John cottons on that he has been standing at the door like an idiot, braced to open it, but unmoving. Swallowing hard, he pushes the door open and lets himself in, eyes automatically coming to focus on the pale figure on the bed.
Sherlock turns, gingerly picks up the letter John had asked Molly to give him shortly after Mary’s death from where it sits inside the skull on the mantle.
"That's- that's good. If I ever came across those responsible, I would have had them all by their throats for laying a finger on you."
Sherlock lets loose a look as if scandalised, mouth opening to ask John what on earth would have possessed him to feed their daughter dessert at this time of day when he spots his beloved standing in the corridor. John holds steady in his hands an impressive-looking cake, his face adorned with that bright, fond smile Sherlock loves so much.
He wants to take it all back, but there’s no way out of this, except to move forward. Before he can do that however, he would need to have a final word with John. Sherlock needs to be sure of what transpired between them lest he misunderstands, and if necessary, give him the chance to bid John a proper goodbye before he submits himself to Mycroft’s supervision.
didn't it? So OOC it's not even funny. But my poor flu-wracked brain couldn't fix it so I had to put it up. Let's just ignore this pile of rubbish shall we ><
With a gasp, Sherlock pushed in, careful not to go too deep too fast, letting John get used to the stretch and fullness. He leaned forwards, folding John down further, opening up his hips until their faces were a breath’s apart. As he stared into the deep cobalt blue eyes he loved so much, Sherlock gritted his teeth, pushing in all the way until his groin was flush against John's arse.
- and never mind that he is covered almost head to toe in baking flour with a giggling Rosie at his feet; Sherlock lets the doctor pull him in, and the two men embrace for an uncertain amount of time before Rosie squawks her protest and the two break apart, the detective taking the chance to place a firm kiss on John’s forehead as a silent thank-you.
He tilts his head just right, places his mouth on that patch of skin, and very, very lightly, presses his tongue just
“Sherlock was found unconscious in a derelict part of North London just an hour ago,” Mycroft announces, his stern gaze making John want to cower in the corner in intimidation.
A minute later, Sherlock caught sight of their ride in the distance, immediately withdrawing his hand from underneath John’s and drawing back, nudging John to pull his own coat tighter around himself. The darkened skies overhead worked to their advantage, ensuring that one could barely tell they were both sporting impressive hard-ons.
John stands outside Sherlock’s room, his hand sweating where it grasps the handle, his skin prickling with anxiety and regret.
Once they were both safely ensconced inside, Sherlock slammed the door closed, uncaring of the neighbours, especially since Mrs Hudson is away at her niece's for the night. He spared one glance at John who was leaving against the wall at the base of the stairs. Their eyes met, and there was a split second of silence before they were both overcome with giggles.
I know this chapter sucks, but right now I'm feeling like what my Sherlock is feeling: dejected and rejected by everyone.
“I see it now,” Sherlock hiccups, his voice barely audible over his suppressed sobs. John’s heart breaks. “You never would have chose me. You’d rather have anyone but me.”
His chin propped on John’s shoulder, Sherlock murmured nonsense into his ear as John writhed, caught between the fingers buried in his arse and the hand pressing against his cock. Suddenly, he pulled his hand out from John’s pants, only to reach into his coat pocket for the anal plug he stashed in there just before they rushed out of the flat for the case. One-handed, he coated the plug with lube from a small bottle, throwing the empty bottle aside and snaking his hand back down the doctor’s pants, telling him to bear down before carefully inserting the two fingers along with the plug.
Tip-toeing his way up the steps to the flat, John tries to hold back a wide grin, wanting to sneak up on his flatmate. He braces himself to find the flat in disarray, but once he pushes the door open, he is surprised to find it almost… clean. There are no stray cups of tea on the floor, no experiments spilled onto the kitchen table, nor is there any additional bullet holes in the wall (there shouldn't be any, really, seeing as John now keeps his gun somewhere he knows Sherlock wouldn't have thought to search).
John doesn't rush, letting Sherlock's body slowly open to let him in. He wants to give Sherlock this, give him pleasure, and surround him with love, so much love.
He feels Sherlock’s hand squeeze lightly at his elbow, the welcome touch grounding. “What were you thinking about?” the man asks, though John doesn’t doubt for one second that Sherlock already has an inkling that it wasn’t anything particularly pleasant.
. The smile that no one else gets to ever see because it is reserved for John, and John alone. This much John has deduced on his own, not needing to mention it to Sherlock because it is that smile that flays Sherlock open and exposes him for the human being that he is -- one who desires to be loved and in return, loves fiercely and with all his being.
To be honest, the detective feels excited, unsure and fearful all at once; and as John turns to entertain and clean up after Rosie, Sherlock smiles to himself, grabbing the nearest clean beaker near him to fill up with water and placing the two flowers inside.
John almost chokes around his mouthful as he registers Sherlock’s first ever curse, wrapping a hand around the base and pulling up, only to tongue at the foreskin, tasting the few drops of precome gathered at the head. The taste of him is heady and everything he didn’t expect and more. Being able to bring Sherlock pleasure like this still feels surreal and so John basks in the compliments that start spilling forth from the detective’s mouth. Taking Sherlock in once more, he sucks and pulls, building a rhythm that reignites the spark low in his belly.
Not a minute later, John Watson pushes the door open, and steps into the room with his shoulders slumped, his face the unhappiest Sherlock’s ever seen him.
, groaning Sherlock’s name as he seizes, groin pressed impossibly close to Sherlock’s arse, shifting in quick minute thrusts as he feels his come flood his lover’s insides, eyes prickling at the corners with tears as he rides the force of his orgasm.
The detective shushes her cries with his lips pressed firmly to her temple, one firm hand holding her to his shoulder and the other rubbing her back with just the right amount of pressure as he hums the softest of melodies and sways on his feet.
He nudged his hips forward bit by bit, letting himself fuck John's mouth; John let him, moaning loudly, reaching up to grip Sherlock's hips and pull him in as his nose nudged Sherlock's pubic hair. One hand wrapped around Sherlock's rigid length, firmly pulling and stroking with every alternate thrust of Sherlock's hips.
“Oh Sherlock… the way you look right now,” John says, taking the opportunity to run his eyes over every inch of the long, lithe body presented to him. “You're brilliant, you're out of this world.” He resumes kissing Sherlock who is now blushing furiously.
“It’ll keep you nice and open until we’re home,” Sherlock promised, his mouth kissing every inch of John’s face he could reach.
John hadn’t gone far, that weekend. He’d changed his mind, opting to visit Harry a few towns over, instead of taking a short trip out of the country. She’d been weary at first, having John at her doorstep after having spent a considerable amount of time apart. But she’d let him in, her instincts as elder sister taking over, having seen his crestfallen state, fussing over him; John had let her, collapsing onto her couch with his head hung low and shoulders slumped in dejection and shame.
John watches, mouth watering at the sight of Sherlock's gluteus muscles flexing with every desperate thrust alternately forwards into the pillow placed under his hips and backwards, impaling himself on what looks like three fingers.
John startles awake to the sounds of banging and the rattling of his front door, only to wince as he realises that he’s been sleeping on the unforgiving floor, and not his bed.
I apologise for the late (and eek, shorter??) update, same old thoughts bringing me down more than I should have allowed them to. I'm alright now. My thoughts went through the same peaks and troughs as Sherlock's here, lol :s
He lets out a loud groan as he comes down from his high, letting the ghosts of Sherlock's orgasm wring the last few spurts of come from his still-twitching cock. He doesn't want to pull out yet, so he rolls them to their sides.
John heaves a deep breath and does not reply, only moving back into the kitchen to place the cake in a thankfully-clean-section of the fridge. “The cake can wait,” he says with a smile, returning to where Sherlock and their daughter stood in their tight embrace. “Come on Rosie, give papa a big birthday kiss, and I’ll bring you to see your nan downstairs.”
Sherlock feels John shudder against him, and it is only when he registers the man’s uneven breathing does he realise that John is crying quietly, his whole body tense with the force of his restrained sobbing. He immediately pulls back, shushing the smaller man with a kiss to his forehead and wiping away his tears with his thumbs.
“What brings you here, Mycroft? No war to wage in some faraway country?” Sherlock croaks, hissing as an attempt to pull himself upright results in a considerable amount of pain flaring from just below his ribs.
“John!” Sherlock howls, one hand finding its way to John’s head where he tries to hold on, the other scratching nails down John’s back. John worries the bite with his tongue, soothing the burn, kissing and licking his way down to Sherlock’s chest, pausing at a darkened nipple, wasting no time in pulling it between his teeth. He sucks it into his mouth as he gives his first thrust, moaning deep against Sherlock’s chest as he feels Sherlock’s hardening length against his own.
“Mhmm, it's soaked in your scent. I missed everything; your face, your smile, your smell, god, it's why I had to choose your sodding bed and the pillow I know you never fail to cuddle when you sleep. Sorry about that,” Sherlock pulls back, face flushed in embarrassment or arousal, John can't tell.
“You're mine, aren't you, John?” he growled, mindlessly, teasingly grinding his hips, his other hand keeping the coat wrapped around the two of them.
He told her everything she needed to know. He didn’t leave any stone unturned, and when he’d finished, his chest tight with the effort to hold in his grief, Harry simply tutted and pulled her into a tight embrace, shushing his pitiful, trembling form with her gentle hands. It had been a long time since either of them sought comfort from the other, but John was eternally grateful nonetheless to know that his sister was there for him, no matter what.
John whimpers; Sherlock’s hold on him tightens, the taller man rubbing John’s back in a soothing, calming pattern in an obvious attempt to encourage John to regulate his breathing, which he soon does, still unable to bring himself to pull back from the embrace, lest the tight cocoon of warmth and affection they’ve built around them shatter and John’s world comes crashing down again.
John hmm’ed an affirmative, standing up and scrambling to get his drawing materials ready; Sherlock now sitting upright on their sofa, already unbuttoning the buttons of his midnight blue shirt. When John returned to the living room, he took in the sight of a nearly-naked Sherlock Holmes shuffling from foot to foot by the side of the sofa, his clothes already neatly folded and placed on the nearby armchair.
He conjures up the letter in his mind's eye, John's scathing words staring down at him in reproach, each one a blinding pain in his heart.
The next morning found Sherlock spooning the smaller man, teasing John with bites of his earlobe, neck, shoulder, inhaling his scent, the scent of
If I was to guess I would say that Sherlock isn't straight. But since he's now rumored to be dating his other backup dancer Sally...maybe he's bi? Anyways, hope I answered your questions. To all the other anons, I now consider this subject closed.
Today had been a bad day; it started at a label meeting in which a table full off suits shouted at him about "planning the launch strategy for an album that's not even half done yet" and progressed to someone slapping down a copy of the L.A Times, where an interview he had done months ago had been turned into some sort of 'should we have seen this coming?' hack job suitable for lining litter boxes everywhere, and had completely twisted his words.
John grimaced. "Sorry about that. Speaking of which, you wouldn't, ah, have seen Sherlock this morning, have you? I really need to talk to him."
With a groan and the pop of several joints, he flopped onto the sofa and dug into his food, mindlessly shoving it into his mouth. Some days were worse than others; some days he felt almost normal, like he could be ok and he could make this work and be content, but the majority of time, such as tonight, he felt such emptiness inside him that he couldn't even enjoy simple pleasures like a good meal.
"It's already done brother mine. He will be here in two weeks. I tried to warn you earlier, but you have been most tricky to get ahold of."
"Well, then I would simply stake out every Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton across the globe until I find you. You are nothing if not predictable Sherlock, and your love of creature comforts will prevent you from being truly unfindable, as will the fact that you are highly recognizable, and in today's age of camera phones and social media, imminently traceable."
I could spend forever just like this, Sherlock thought, warm and safe, pressed up against John, and forgetting the rest of the world and the problems that plagued him. He wanted to dig his fingertips into the warm flesh and never let go, but he knew that would probably be a bit not good. The real world was not going to go away though, and after a few silent moments, John cleared his throat softly.
"I think not. Not until you tell me what the hell this is. Is this some sort of threat? Do I exactly have a choice here?"
"I told you Anderson, I do not want a rap feature. While I respect the inherent artistry of the genre, it is not something I feel works with the music I want to make."
"Good luck!" Sally called after him as John dashed to the front door. He scanned the crowd as he went, but he was nowhere to be seen. He pushed out into the cool night air and looked up and down the sidewalk, past the people still queuing up to get in.
After a few moments of quiet reflection, she spoke. "A few months ago, you put in an application to work with V.I.P Security Solutions, looking for part-time employment as a bodyguard, but you were declined because of your slight limp, your PTSD following your traumatic wound in the service, and your depressive and suicidal tendencies."
"Sherlock is more than your average, mouth breathing twenty-two-year-old. He's special. He's insanely talented, possesses a genius level intellect, and he can handle the pressure flawlessly. But the pressure has never been the issue. If anything, he thrives on the chaos." Mycroft ran a hand through his hair, and for the first time looked, and sounded, genuinely ruffled. Maybe this ice man had a heart after all.
"Yep." He replied, popping the P. "The label said it didn't matter. They said they could set me up with the best songwriters in the game. Most popstars don't write their own material after all. But I am not most popstars." Sherlock sniffed, as if the mere notion was ridiculous.
Sherlock snorted and looked over to Sally, who was chatting on her mobile, oblivious. Henry was one of the few who knew he was gay, in fact he was the first person he'd come out to, so he wasn't sure what he was getting at. "What? That's ridiculous."
"Ok, how do you possibly know all of that? Do you and your brother have mind reading abilities? He did something similar too... this whole reading your life business. His was a lot creepier I must admit."�
"Now I'll be taking you to the house, but keep in mind I won't be doing this regularly. I'm the housekeeper dear, not your Uber driver, so just this once ok?" She said sternly. "L.A. is nothing like London unfortunately. There is a public transport system but it's just not the same. Sherlock has a car you can use if you know how to drive, since he refuses to drive it. He wastes so much money on taxis and that nonsense. So you should be just fine. Now strap in, it's rush hour."
"I'm a determined man John, I get what I want. Always have. And I want you. Your application for bodyguard work tipped me off to your existence, and I proceeded from there. I have been surveilling--"
"This is exactly why I want to quit!" Sherlock exploded, his voice taking on that needy, desperate quality it did right before he took a nosedive and deigned not to speak to anyone for a day or two. "The label doesn't care what I want. Greg doesn't care what I want, and you certainly don't care what I want! All I am is a product! A commodity to be bought and traded and I've had enough!'
The seat was leather as supple as he'd ever felt, and though he wasn't a tall man, he had so much leg room he couldn't help but kick his feet up in the air like a little kid, enjoying every second of something so novel as flying first class. The man in the seat next to him, a bespectacled older gentleman in a business suit, looked a bit scandalized for a moment, before turning his attention back to his copy of The New York Times with a sniff. Well then. John wasn't going to let anyone ruin his childlike glee. No Watson's before him had ever taken a trans-Atlantic flight, let alone one in style, and he was going to make up for all of the generations that came before him (going to Afghanistan had been the first and only time someone in his family had flown anywhere). Putting on his brightest smile, he signaled to the flight attendant, wanting to get in on a little of that hot towel action, and the woman came over with a smile, depositing one into his hand.
It wasn't as awkward as he thought it would be, having John inside his orbit like this. Being in his home, involved in other aspects of his life, well that was one thing, but bringing him to the place where he let loose--sometimes a bit too loose--was another. To let John see him like this, using the lights and the noise (and ok, a few shots) and the energy of the crowd to drown out his mind, was a huge step. Not that John knew what was happening, of course, but Sherlock felt it just the same. Overall it was a tamer version of his usual outings; there were none of the usual suspects pushing various mind-altering substances at him, and none of the sheltered privacy of the VIP area where anything went, but it was nice. Wholesome almost. And it was working; his head was momentarily clear and that's all that mattered.
"I am such a shit babysitter." John giggled as they burst through the front door. "Don't tell Mycroft ok? We can't let him know." He mock whispered, swaying into Sherlock and bumping his nose into his shoulder.
Sherlock had fumed so hard that even John gave him space, and he deleted several emails from God knows who about a party in Malibu, in favor of sulking on the sofa in his favorite ratty pajamas until he'd moved over to sulk at the piano instead.
Sherlock pulled back to look down at him, and in that moment, with John so close, smiling so sincerely, and those bloody blue eyes doing things to him, he let the first instinct of his booze addled brain take over, and he swooped in and kissed him.
With a great, put upon sigh, he popped his earbuds in, cranked the volume up on his phone, and lost himself in his music, hoping to finally be inspired and clear the constant cacophony in his head.
The coat is the star of the show: a long and sweeping custom made wool number from British luxury apparel company Belstaff. It has the look of being distinctly classic, upper crust, I-went-to-Harrow posh, while still giving us something that feels fresh. We'd love to see this silhouette in different fabrics and colors. A bit heavy for May's warm temperatures, but it surely kept him warm in the path of Anna Wintour's icy gaze.
But Sherlock, maybe sensing this, stood up, spun on his heel and began marching back down from where they'd come. "I'm ready to leave now." He called over his shoulder.
He left it at that, but he was certain his meaning was clear, and when it was obvious that Sherlock wasn't going to express more about the issue, he changed topics. "So, you're home then? Or are you still locked up in the clink, wasting your one phone call on me?"
Sherlock tried his best do look affronted, but it was pointless. Two seconds later both had dissolved into laughter so hard that they both gripped the wall to stand upright.
John was smaller than he'd imagined, and the idea of him being the thick-skulled brute he'd accused Mycroft of hiring was downright laughable. He was a good foot or so shorter than himself, with sandy blonde hair and a face he couldn't make out, as he was bent over his stack of records, and his frame was small, though his back and shoulders were broad enough compared to his slim waist. If Sherlock noticed that he was rather fit, with denim that clung to well-shaped thighs and arse, then that was neither here nor there.
"Look Sherlock," John dropped his voice, and took a step closer, ignoring the way it made Sherlock flinch. "If we could just, I don't know, go somewhere quieter and talk? I think that would be good."
The results brought up page after page of links (over two hundred and fifty million results it said at the top of the page), and he scrolled through them with interest. Near the top of the page was his Wikipedia entry, and he clicked on it.
"Oh, so I see. Had to spend hours picking up red cups for your party here and couldn't be arsed to let me know you were alive?"
Out of all the emotions he now had no control over, the ones he felt for John were the worst. His initial attraction to the man had grown into a full-blown crush, and he wasn't sure what to do with that. He hadn't felt anything remotely romantic for anyone in ages. Out gay males in pop music, if not unheard of, were rare, and he'd been burying that part of himself for years, even if occasionally he'd toyed with the idea of pushing the closet door open.
The footage of the altercation cut away to show a black man in dreads smirking to a room full of millennial types as they smirked back at him. "
A black Range Rover came to pick John up at the airport, and he waited a minute, seeing if anyone was going to hop out and help him with his luggage, but it was soon clear that would not be the case. After stowing his suitcases in the boot, and after a moment of hesitation as to whether he should get into the back or not, he awkwardly slid into the passenger seat.
"You have eclectic taste." John said abruptly, gesturing towards his vinyl collection. "I don't think I've met someone so young who even knows who Rush is."
"My brother has issues. I won't lie to you. And I've been letting things slide for too long. It's time to do something before he hurts himself or others. You see, my brother is an industry unto himself. Hundreds of people rely on him for their livelihood, and he's been jeopardizing his career, his future, and many other things with his reckless behavior."
Sherlock bit his lip to stop the surely embarrassing smile that threatened to spill across his face.
"Don't whine, it's unattractive." John ambled down the hall, looking down as he picked at the crumbs of a biscuit lodged in his jumper. "You could always stay in and watch Cupcake Wars with me." He grinned teasingly.
"I can't write a thing. Not a chord, not a melody, not even a damn lyric. It's been this way for months. The place in me where a million songs used to live is now a gaping black hole."
John was briefly surprised that Sherlock had apologized. "Uh, ah, yes. Right then. Thank you. Now why the hell do you have a gun and why were you shooting it at your wall?!" He was at Sherlock's side in an instant, and ripped the gun from his hand, disengaging the clip and setting it on the table with shaky hands.
"Well then they are fools." Mycroft said with all the conviction he felt, as he paced up and down the hall. Oh, the aggravation caused by small minds. The bane of his existence. Then, with a softer edge to his voice he added. "But it is 2017 and things in the entertainment industry have changed considerably in the last few years. I am sure Greg would have no issues if you wished to tell him... what was on your mind. You know he's not like the others."
Sherlock flipped himself back around to look up at his brother. If he could have this conversation pouting into the back of the sofa cushions, he would, but he wanted his dear brother to see the full brunt of his displeasure. He took him in for a moment, his thinning hair mussed, shirtsleeves pushed haphazardly up above his elbows, and a tie hanging limply from a perspiration soaked collar. Still not used to the L.A heat then. Good, let him suffer. Or better yet, he could take his arse back to London.
It was a shame then that he was out of his stash, and his go to guy was being heavily monitored by his bastard of a brother. This would have to take the edge off instead.
The thought of him sends Sherlock's pulse skittering again, and he gasps and tries to delay the inevitable. Loving John Watson has been simultaneously the most rewarding, and most painful thing Sherlock has ever let himself experience, and he can't help but wonder if he could have saved himself the heartbreak a long time ago, and stayed dead after he fell from the roof of St. Bart's. He could have died in isolation somewhere in Europe, and no one would be none the lesser. John would be happy with Mary and the family he's always wanted. Sherlock would have suffered, yes, but ultimately his sacrifice for John Watson was for the sole purpose of keeping him alive, and alive, John
She’d sent him on his way the next morning with nothing more than a few quiet words and a kiss to his forehead, just like she always did when she watched him walk to school on his own all those years ago - the two of them having only started fending for their own selves after their mother disappeared and their father started coming home drunk and violent almost every night, too upset at himself and too plastered to care about his children’s wellbeing.
The man did not look amused. "No one forced you to do anything Dr. Watson. She did not threaten you nor did she hold a gun to your back--"
This was by far the strangest conversation Sherlock had ever had. Here they were, not even formally introduced yet, and they had fallen into some sort of banter as if they were old friends, which was ridiculous. Sherlock didn't do friends. It was not as if he didn't want them, it was just impossible to have them in his line of work. Genuine people were hard to come by in the entertainment world, and it was hard to nurture any kind of relationship when you were always so busy, or away from home. Besides, this man was the enemy, here to trail him and tattle on him and make his life a lot less fun; the last thing he needed was to form some sort of attachment.
I am sitting here in a quaint little coffee shop in Brooklyn, NY, the kind of place that hipsters flock to by the dozens, with its kitsch and it's ecofriendly free trade coffee and random boxes of obscure vinyl records placed here and there for the caffeine addicts to flip through at their leisure, waiting for Greg Lestrade, CEO of Capitol Records to breeze through the door at any moment. He's running a bit behind schedule, but such is the life when one is as incredibly busy as he is, and word from the label is he's out meeting with a perspective new artist in the area, hence our unusual meeting location. Whoever he's meeting must be incredibly lucky, as it takes almost an act of God himself to move this very important man from his vaulted tower, and into the world of us plebeians. Rumor has it, the last time he went in person to check out a potential artist signing was for the British boyband Deduction, and we all know how that turned out.
"Did you hear what I said Sherlock?" Mycroft repeated, trying his best not to raise his voice; snapping at his brother now would only lead to nothing but a fruitless argument full of vicious insults and expletives, or else he would clam up entirely and say nothing. No, it was better to hold one's tongue, to be firm, but not accusatory. "The facts are as follows. You are contractually obligated to Capitol Records for another two albums. Considering the success of your previous album it is highly unlikely that they will let you out of your contract. They have been waiting on you to get your act together and finish your follow up, and as Greg has so generously reminded me over and over again, you are running out of time before they decide to pursue this in a manner that would be.... unfortunate."
"Home at last." Mrs. Hudson announced, pulling up to a house at the end of a street that dead ended into a cul-de-sac, and from what he could see of the house over the privacy fence, it looked more like an industrial building than the house of a popstar. In his head, he'd pictured a sienna colored Spanish tiled roof and palm trees reaching towards the sky, but this was rather sleek looking and cold. Mrs. Hudson made quick work of entering in a security passcode, and the front gates swung inward, opening to a drive that wound up to the imposing structure. He spotted no less than five security cameras aimed at different points in the perimeter--surely Mycroft's doing--and the whole thing had a very prison block feeling to it.
Going back to google he did an image search, and suddenly John felt the bottom drop out. These were more recent pics indeed; everything from press photos from the red carpet, to highly stylized magazine covers, flooded the page and he was shocked by how different he looked. Sherlock had definitely grown up. He was not so cute anymore, and John felt a strange sensation twisting in his gut. Sherlock was fucking gorgeous, that was undeniable. He was a bit strange looking--taken separately he's not sure his features would be aesthetically pleasing--but all together it gave him an exotic look. He was pale, with a rather long face, and the lingering baby fat had vanished, leaving strikingly high cheek bones, and on top of them sat slightly cat like eyes, bright green. His hair was dark, almost black, with threads of Mycroft's auburn-like color running through it, and those lips... He had lips fuller than any mans had a right to be, with a pronounced cupid's bow, and in every single photo they were curved into a haughty smirk that just screamed 'I am better than you and I know it'.
John" she whispered as if there was someone else nearby to overhear them) the boys had set her up with a cushy gig. Her official title was housekeeper, but since Sherlock was rarely home, it didn't leave her with much to do, but there's a Mrs. Turner who is the housekeeper next door for two married "homosexual actors" that she's friendly with, and she spends an uncomfortable amount of time waxing poetic about how it's so wonderful that the world is changing and how the neighborhood has "all kinds" of people like them.
aaaa CLIFFHANGER! Sorry to end it here, that was not planned whoops. I will be now working on more chapters to post when I get them done. Thanks for reading!
"It's slang for cocaine. It's like from the eighties or something. My Dad used to throw it around all the time."
"Oh really?" John blinked. Shit. Maybe it was just paranoia, but he'd seen his sister melt down enough to know how throwing something unexpected into the mix could tip a situation from 'precarious' over into 'full blown disaster'.. A sort of vinegar in the baking soda volcano. He hoped to God all Sherlock was doing in that bathroom was taking a piss. He leaned around a rather bulky man to try and get a good look. The men's door was still closed.
They ended up in a lane that was slightly less packed and began cruising along nicely. "It's a good thing you're here dear." She smiled warmly, and her eyes were so tender that John was ready to hear something about how Sherlock really needed someone like him, or some other sappy nonsense, but she simply patted him on the shoulder and said "We can use the carpool lane."
Tonight, had found him in a relatively new club on the strip, one whose name he didn't even recall, but it was Moroccan themed and exclusive as hell. Sherlock lounged in a circular cabana on a raised platform in the VIP section; it was full of brightly patterned cushions and partially obscured by gauzy curtains, and he was surrounded by his core group of back up dancers, otherwise known as the only people he could tolerate socially. Sally, Rebecca, Henry, Grayson, and Brett were spread out around him, chatting amicably, and playing with the gold hookah in the middle of the cabana.
A shower of plaster sprayed from the wall, sending pieces ricocheting across the room, and Sherlock aimed his handgun a bit higher, seeing if he could spell out "fuck off Mycroft" in bullets. He got as far as the F when both Mrs. Hudson and John came barreling around the corner, ducked down and covering their ears. They spoke at the same time:
John groans to himself, dismayed at the prospect of the long journey ahead. He’d driven away the one person who mattered most, making the worst decisions of his life along the way. He couldn’t help Harry when she needed him, he married an assassin, and had seriously hurt his best friend.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock answers, willing his feet to move and follow John out the door, but not before twisting around and checking his reflection in the mirror once more. John
John doesn't want to draw it out. He knows they both need it hard and fast this first time round, and so he withdraws all the way until only the head of him is buried inside Sherlock before his hips snap forward, aiming directly for Sherlock's prostate.
Already gripping the base of his cock, Sherlock pulled back slightly from the wall, positioning John at an angle against the wall. He then proceeded to lower John onto his waiting cock, letting gravity aid their coupling.
The house was imposing, reeking of old money, the kind that was so old they had simply stopped calling it money and just called it 'wealth'. Calling it a house was not even accurate; it was more like a country estate from a Merchant Ivory film, all ivy-covered columns and forbidden love affairs. John would have killed to take a better look at his surroundings, for it wasn't every day that a beautiful, and possibly criminal, woman stole you away from the mundanity of your day and into something a bit more clandestine, but with the way he had to scurry to keep up with her, sightseeing was not on the agenda.
John blinked, momentarily taken aback. "And you are more than a popstar Sherlock. You're more than a song on the radio or a photo in a tabloid."
