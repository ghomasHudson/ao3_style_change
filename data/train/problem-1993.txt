It was the second time that he had the fortune to see Sherlock’s erect member but for him, it was the first time he had seen John like this.
John’s mind went blank. He couldn’t think of a single thing to say. So he lost it and started giggling.
As soon as John came downstairs after another sleepless night, their gazes full of infinite sadness met. They just looked at each other for a few minutes, neither of them in need of words. When John’s eyes became watery and he had to swallow hard, he broke the gaze and went to the kitchen to make himself breakfast. Sherlock’s eyes followed him the whole time.
Bar feed and with his curls, in a greater mess than usual, the Omega seemed much younger and less untouchable.
John was stunned. He just stared at Sherlock for a moment until his head snapped up and he lifted one questioning eyebrow.
John felt like he was falling, tumbling through nothingness,g and there was no end to this black hole - until he flinched with the gentle impact of an embrace. Two long arms snaked around him and pulled him against a body that he knew better than his own by now.
Sure, he had had his work and had been successful with it. But at the end he had been alone in his flat, composing sad music and even sometimes looking out the window while watching the happy bonded couples on the streets.
“Do you really think that? So do normal humans often just appear in front of you? That would worry me if I were you.”
The man cleared his throat a little nervously. “Yes, hello ma’am.. I think I’m at the wrong door. I’m looking for John Watson.”
John, shaking with anger and - if he let himself admit it - a little fear, wrested his arm free wordlessly and walked away. He went straight to Sherlock and gently reached for his arm, while the woman he’d been dancing with looked scandalised.
“You’re Mr. Božić? Gregor Božić?” A little internet research had turned up some basic facts about the shop, which was well-regarded locally, and its owner.
"I'm not sure it's irrational," John says, his face grim. "Okay. Let's work, before it gets worse. I'll be your hands, you be my mind."
After long minutes, Lestrade cleared his throat. “John… I’ve been meaning to ask you. Are you…okay? In general? I know things have been difficult for you since…”
“I take it back,” John whispers as they reach the top of the last flight. “This looks much more like a serial killer’s home than our flat does.”
After a pause that feels like an eternity, John says, "Of course. Of course I want that. I've always wanted that." His voice is thick with emotion. He looks around again as he collects himself.
After a few moments tramping in silence Sherlock says slyly, in his most darkly seductive voice, "But I thought your sexuality
“Fuck you. What, I’m supposed to let you overdose and cut yourself and do whatever the hell you want until you die in here, then I can come in and clean up the mess?”
“Sherlock, what the –” he begins as soon as they break apart, but before he can finish the sentence Sherlock is on him again, kissing him with brutal strength, hands on his chest, pushing him back onto the bed, trying to force his tongue between John’s lips and climb on top of him at the same time.
“Not any more. But it’s effective. I’m sure he’s not the only nursery owner or farmer who keeps an old tin around to kill rats with. Oh…fantastic! Only one garden centre that is within walking distance – Gentle Billy’s Plants and Garden Supply, a cheerfully ironic name. Text Lestrade right now, hurry up… ready? ‘157 Bridge Rd, St. John’s Woods. Garden shop. Look for something missing from the pesticide shed and a man with size 12 wellies.’ Got it?”
She clears her throat. “Boys, we’re paying attention to me now. And you can get up and put yourselves back together. I really don’t need to see what happens next here.”
"And what exactly am I supposed to do once I'm there? Mingle? Because I really feel like these are not exactly my kind of people."
"It's done." Sherlock says, not at all sure that it is. But it had better be because even the memory of the knowledge is fading, he wouldn't know mercury from what's-it-called if they both him in the face. "Now, to test it."
“So, someone who spends a lot of time gardening. Maybe a groundskeeper, from one of the nearby houses? Had a grudge…or…or an obsession of some kind?” John can tell the answer is close, he feels it and Sherlock has that expression he gets when he’s just on the edge of a solution, groping for it through the fog.
Sherlock stands abruptly. “Well, this has been... terrible. Are you going to do as I’ve asked, or do I have to take care of it on my own? I do despise lawyers.”
He broods in the taxi on the way home, not so much as to when or whether John will return – John always returns – but about what could have made him so touchy in this case. John barely dated any more anyway, a fact that Sherlock couldn’t deny he’d had a hand in.
John shrugs. “Name one occurrence in life that doesn’t require such a particular and delicate set of circumstances to bring it about that it seems impossible that it happens at all. Everything is vanishingly improbable, when you think about it. It happened. I’m me, you’re you, and we’re here. Leave it.”
But it does not go on. For better or worse, Sherlock’s agents in disguise drag John off of him and bundle Sherlock away to the morgue and the moment is lost.
Every so often, after a long period of working without rest or after a string of particularly difficult cases, Sherlock Holmes will stay in bed for several days and do basically nothing. This has happened twice that John knows of since they met, both times prior to the redefinition of their friendship. The first time he had been certain Sherlock had the flu, and the second he had assumed your basic falling-off-the wagon bender. But neither had been the case.
With an aggrieved sigh Sherlock rolls over and props himself up on his elbow. “Mrs. Hudson can pick up what we need – she always does her shopping on Thursdays. Lestrade can sod off. And if you don’t need to go out, there’s no reason for you to get dressed.”
John swallows and takes a deep breath. Sherlock expects anger and disgust, but gets neither. “Did you just…?”
John barely registers his words before blinding pain explodes in his head as Sherlock plucks the shard from his shoulder. He is unable to stop a scream and Sherlock looks away, surprisingly squeamish. The next thing he knows, a soft silk shirt – expensive, tailored, emerald – is being held to the hole in his body, and Sherlock’s heavy wool coat is wrapped around him. Sherlock’s face, pale and tight-lipped, is the last thing he sees before passing out.
“Well, cancel. The coroner says the ligature marks on the body are like nothing he’s seen before. I need you to look at them.”
Mycroft chuckles. “Oh, the charges would have been cleared whether our friend wanted them to be or not. No, I showed him what Sherlock could do for him. It didn’t take much nudging. He was eager to make a name for himself. I only asked that he keep Sherlock…busy. And out of trouble as far as he was capable. The arrangement worked better than I had hoped. Lestrade had real need of Sherlock, and Sherlock listened to him more than to me, because Lestrade had something he actually wanted.”
For the first time in weeks, John grins unselfconsciously. “Definitely.” He pillows his head on Sherlock’s chest, grateful beyond measure to be nowhere in the world but there.
Moriarty cocks his head in genuine confusion. "You couldn't have known. I changed everything. You were deaf and blind."
John lets go of all conscious thought, the last of his anger, and any inkling of the existence of the woman at all, indulging completely in the velvety warmth of Sherlock’s ceaseless pulsing against him. It is like being cast into a warm pool and finding that he can float without any effort at all. The pleasure is intense, but not overwhelming, building slowly but never quite pushing him over the edge. He allows himself to get lost in the sensation so completely that it’s a shock when after long minutes it finally stops.
“Are you going to kill me?” he asked, trying to sound defiant, but with fear writ large in his features.
“That’s not the point. You’re not a vigilante, you’re a consulting detective, so start acting like one! You can’t just kill someone for threatening me.” John’s voice is loud, angry, and scared. Sherlock forces himself not to cringe away from it.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about John, but I’m pleased you’re well. I didn’t expect them to release you this soon.”
Mycroft coughed. “While I appreciate your anger at me, one typically waits to find out one’s visitor’s business before attacking him,” he said primly. “Now, if you will let me go I will tell you why I am here and then you can decide whether you would like to continue in your attempt to murder me.”
“Well, you wouldn’t know, you weren’t there, were you?” John growls. “And you know perfectly well what I’m talking about, don’t change the subject. The kidnapper. You murdered him in cold blood while he was lying there in the gutter, didn’t you?”
John shoves Sherlock's shirt halfway up his back, one hand fisted tightly in Sherlock's hair and the other gripping his waist and tapping furiously with his thumb.
“Yes, I figured as much. But maybe anything potentially deadly can go up here? In the nice, safe hood?”
? Thank you for telling me. Yes, I will. No, I can handle it. I said I can handle it! Fine, tomorrow. Piss off.”
“Well,” John says with transparently false cheer. “Neither did I. But it turns out I’m quite good at it. Who knew? That’s not a…
Finally, shortly after three am, John stumbles through the door. He’s been drinking, more than just his usual few pints while watching the football. There’s whiskey on his breath, Sherlock can smell it from across the room.
Sherlock licks his lips. “I need her to exist. That’s why I saved her. She’s like… my equal and opposite force. She’s the balance to me in the universe, what might have been. Not like Moriarty. He’s what I could become but mustn’t. And not like you. You’re my complement, my other half.”
Sherlock remembers. His eyes fly open and the brightness of even the very dim upstairs room is dazzling, almost painful. He can see again, in normal colors, everything around him. The ugly plaster ceiling is nothing short of an artistic revelation. It worked.
Her too-obvious coquettishness, brassy and unpractised, brings home just how young she really is and John dials back from the encounter, trying to figure out how to get a look around without her appointing herself his own personal tour guide.
was the biggest thing. And anything after that was trivial in comparison. It was just supposed to be...formalising it. It seemed like such a small thing after…”
“I’m more worried about what you need right now,” John said hesitantly. “What you want. Tell me. Please.”
Sherlock is stunned into silence. He scrambles for words while John goes to the door without looking back him. Just as John is reaching for the doorknob, Sherlock manages to get something out.
The other man’s eyes narrow. “Yes, that is convenient… that’s what worries me. You knew where to find us and you know more than you’re telling, about a lot of things, I suspect. Something about this isn’t right, and it’s above my paygrade. The bosses will have to deal with you. Who knows, if you’re as clever as you seem, you might end up with that job after all. Or…” he gestures graphically. “Not.”
“He went to public school at aged 11, and there were dormitories, of course, and yet somehow there was always a buffer zone of empty bunks around Sherlock’s. At university no roommate lasted more than five days, he ended up in a single as a default. You’ve met his closest chum from his uni days.”
As they go, the youngest of the group, a lieutenant named McNabb, lags behind long enough to tell John, quietly, “I read your blog, it’s brilliant! And you and that detective fellow, Holmes? It’s… well, I think it’s nice is all. Good for you.”
“Indeed. He seemed to be able to see that my brother was not an ordinary junkie and to have some compassion for him. I thought perhaps we could come to a beneficial relationship.”
“I said no. Mycroft can deal with his guilt on his own. I don’t want to see him, I don’t want talk to him, I don’t want his help or his money or his empathy. Mycroft Holmes can go fuck himself.”
“You don’t believe that,” Sherlock growls. “Despite your determined attempts to appear otherwise, you're not stupid. You know what's happening to me. This won't get better. It will probably get worse. This is all there is for me now."
She rolled her eyes, as if annoyed by his mere presence. “You want see room? Upstairs. No English,” she said, grabbing a key off a hook by the door.
“Whoa,” John said steadying him. “You shouldn’t be standing. Look, sit down and I’ll take care of Moran.”
“Uh, step-brother, actually,” interjects the prospective client in a thick Australian accent. He shrinks back as John and Sherlock slowly turn identical, venomous expressions on him. “That seemed important but…now… it doesn’t...it’s fine…”
John looks up at him, so sadly, not even angry at being trapped like this. “There’s nothing you can do. It can’t ever be like it was. Life doesn’t work like that. Now, just let me go.”
John takes all that in, wide eyed, and Sherlock starts to worry he's too far gone. But then he nods sharply and, without warning, dives away, out of Sherlock's range of him, and Sherlock's world plunges back in the complete darkness and the swaying of the tube car. His lifeline is gone and he's alone on the speeding train.
“Wrong?”John was appalled at the thought, “No, no no, Sherlock nothing is wrong.” Sherlock was alert on his lap and was staring at him anxiously awaiting an explanation. “You didn’t do anything wong. I was just getting a little too… er, excited.”
"Sherlock! Sherlock come back" For the first time since the fall John was crying. There were thick tears rolling down his cheeks. He placed both of his hands on either side of the man’s face, his rough thumb pads on those perfect cheekbones. "Sh..sherlock, P..Please I'm Sorry..." He sobbed. "God I'm sorry, I love you damn it. You can't just leave. Don’t you hear me? I love you!" He planted a kiss on his lips lightly, once, twice, before sobs started to rip through his chest, shaking his whole body, his head now resting on Sherlock's chest. "Sherlock, please." A few minutes later John could hear the wail of sirens coming closer.
John blushed, a rare reaction for the boy, and Mike smiled, John must have it pretty bad if even the thought was making him blush. “It doesn’t matter. I don’t think he’s interested.”
"Sherlock. It's John. I'm here. Can't you hear me?" He grabbed his shoulder shook him lightly. "Oh Sherlock." The dark haired man looked awful. He was burning up, his face pale and beaded with sweat his curls plastered to his forehead. His defined features looking hollow and dark, losing their natural beauty in the depth of the drug.
“Sherlock, stop this right now,” John’s voice was bordering on anger and it took Sherlock by surprise enough to make him look down at the army doctor. “It is not your fault, Sherlock. Mary made the decision to save your life for a reason. Mary saved your life because-” John’s throat closed up a little, was he really going to do this right now? “She saved your life because she knew. She’s always known.”
The younger man threw his head back with a loud moan and another firm drag of his nails down the doctor’s back. John was certain that Sherlock had drawn blood with the last one but couldn’t bring himself to care as he repeated the motion. He was angling his hips just so that he barely grazed Sherlock’s prostate with each trust, driving the younger man to the brink of insanity.
John went to work and felt more peaceful than he did for a long time. He joked with some colleagues and he felt sanguine.
The Alpha had taken over Lestrade’s job then and so it was perfectly obvious that they would work together.
After work, he made himself dinner while humming and after watching a bit of crap telly he went to bed.
Sherlock hunkered down before John, and tried to get his attention with a gentle hand on his knee and a quiet call, but he failed. Instead, he wrested the card from John’shand and read it.
“Very well brother. So… I had an extremely interesting conversation with a certain Miss Adler. She told me everything about this so-called ritual Dr Watson performed.”
Now she smiled at him a really big smile and John knew suddenly that this girl was in love with his dead flatmate.
He dared to crack his eyes open. The room was dim. That was very good for his eyes which burned. They started to tear but he didn’t want to close them again. He was alive. He was really undeniably alive and back. Admittedly he felt really bad but that was okay because this was a proof for his liveliness.
This seemed to soothe him and he began to talk with a gleam in his eyes. He told John about the gruel murder and John hung on his lips. When he was finished John had only one question.
Finally, he could touch those incredible curls and he grabbed them hard which made Sherlock gasp in response.
“No, it’s not your fault. But it was just a really bad day… but it doesn’t matter now. I mean you’re here!”
Everything was in his place and there was no human or animal. He checked every room and saw if he had locked the door but everything was fine. Maybe the crash was really just in his dreams; he thought and went to bed again.
“Welcome to my world, John. Oh and you passed it by the way. But please let us talk about something different than my insufferable brother.”
As if he could read his mind Sherlock was suddenly sitting across of John in what was apparently now officially his chair.
He closed his eyes and noticed for the first time that he was shaking. Sherlock just held him for what felt like hours, until he fell asleep.
He knew that it was ridiculous but for him, John was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen and he wished that he could stop the time so that they could stand there for eternity.
When John woke up the next day, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen again. He remembered that he had to call the mental hospital on some point to let them know that he wouldn’t come. So he did just that and then made himself tea and breakfast and went to get a cab for visiting the shop.
When both were only in their pants, John decided to take charge. He started to slowly kiss his partner without any hurry.
“You know I think it’s rather suspicious that you suddenly come here, talk to me about a cold case and try to tell me who the murderer is. Is someone feeling a bit guilty?”
Sherlock’s face softened. “I know. I’m glad they’re trying. It’s just ridiculous that they’re still uncomfortable with certain subjects. And they still stiffen when they see us touching in any way. I mean we already avoid kissing when they are around, but they still look like they are biting into a lemon when we hold hands.”
Maybe he could finally live in a flat on his own and prove that he wasn’t just an addict anymore away from his annoying brother.
John tried to remember, and he was surprised that Sherlock even gave him the time when he already knew the answer. John knew he only let him think about it because he was trying to distract him, and that thought in itself was a beautiful distraction. It caused  a smile to sneak to John’s lips.
Sherlock avoided looking down and tried painfully to think of something disgusting like Mycroft naked but then John touched his legs to get them out of the trousers and so his mind filled with John.
The younger one was the opposite of that. He was a bit wild not in a childish way. He was passionate about the things he loved. He played the violin and that more than well.
“I only refused it because I have feelings for you and I didn’t just want to be a solution to a problem.”
Sherlock stroke over to John’s side and they stood shoulder to shoulder in front of Mrs Hudson and Mr Watson.
Sherlock craved his touches and although he loved being intimate with John, he loved the quiet days even more.
He felt her urge to put her wet hands in front of her to avoid to fall on her face. Reflexive tears filled her turquoise eyes when her chin hit the dusty sink board with a loud
Lestrade pursed his lips and just looked at John suppressing his anger. Then he stood up to go right out of the room, leaving John once more alone.
“Well okay… you see the killer, Liam Bellamy had once a wife and a daughter. But his wife died in childbirth and so he was a really loving and caring father for his daughter. She was his whole world.
John’s eyes had gone wide during his speech and then he had put a hand on his neck, pulling him down, while pushing himself up to kiss him.
During his second sentence, he looked at a dark-haired man who was now really angry looking and the woman named Sally had a dark-red coloured face now.
A giraffe-like woman stepped toward the sink, washed just her fingers (without wetting her palms) and left without looking around. Her brown eyes and hair lingered for a moment on the mirror before she gently closed the door.
How could someone like him, someone, who was rude and being honest most of the time didn’t even care about the others?
John chuckled and began to gently caress Sherlock’s scalp through his hair which made him almost purr in reaction.
The brothers didn’t really talk to each other. It was like two strangers living together. I remember when they were little, they played often together and deduced people together.”
“Yes, it is indeed unfair. But I don’t think that you want to start a fight at a wedding, do you? And as far as can I see, you really want me to come along. I believe this is the only way to make it possible.”
When they arrived, Harry was already there. She hugged John. “Merry Christmas. I’m so glad to see you, I want to tell you something.”
He had sat down and slowly lay down until they had both been lying on their backs, staring at the ceiling.
He took off his jacket and went to the living room. There he stood in the middle of the room, his hands on his hips.
“Um… okay here’re the terms. You drink something and then you’ll wait if you have to go to the toilet. And then if this happens you can try to eat something. Deal?”
The next morning John didn’t see Sherlock until he finished breakfast and was reading the newspaper in his chair.
First John wanted to laugh because of this reaction but then he couldn’t because his breath was caught when he noticed that their faces were only inches apart.
“Besides I somehow enjoy your company and that’s not just because you’re the first person I have talked with in ten months. You’re interesting and until now you never bored me but we have only known each other for about three days so… don’t interpret too much in it.”
Slowly he moved in front of the detective and sit down on the bed but he got no reaction from his friend.
As soon as John opened his eyes after a better sleep that he hadn’t had for a long time, he felt a bit anxious.
That’s the reason why Sherlock often was the centre of attention when they were among Alphas although that stopped almost immediately as soon as he began to speak.
As soon as he arrived at the Holmes estate he was feeling something similar to fear- something he wasn’t used to.
Usually, such moods could only be cured by John but the DI was confused to notice that he couldn’t find him anywhere.
“Oh come on, John! Don’t be so naïve! I wasn’t the nicest human being! I had more enemies than anything else! And now I’ll invite some of them to my house!”
her, out of curiosity. For weeks. Grace Wilkinson and her tiny red-haired family, living on the outskirts of the City. It was like looking into a well, like making a wish.
“Everything hurts. It’s like every muscle in my body is cramping. And my skin…is so sore like I had sunburn on my whole body. And everything is just too much. Too loud, too bright. Help me, John.”
John took a moment to consider everything and he knew that Sherlock was probably right but as soon as he looked into the ghost’s eyes he knew the decision was made.
He was dressed in a grey pyjama bottom and a blue t-shirt, his blue satin dressing gown which wasn’t closed, hung lose over everything.
She hugged him hard, squeezing the air out of him. Then his parents began to ask questions about the wedding, and John entwined his fingers with Sherlock’s and relaxed.
John put himself between them before Sherlock could deduce something embarrassing about Greg and declare it out loud.
He asked one of his colleagues out on a date.  Her name was Sarah.  She was really nice but they were too similar. They agreed on being just friends.
So maybe it was him being in pain. But that also seemed ridiculous because of the fact that he was fine.
John also nodded and then left to do the shopping while Sherlock was sitting in his chair speechless.
Sherlock hummed approvingly, and so they stayed like that until Lestrade intervened. He cleared his throat demonstratively until they took a step back and faced him. He grinned.
Her birth had been complicated and John had really been close to losing both, his mate and his daughter but in the end, they had been saved but it was sure that Sherlock would never be able to get pregnant again.
John crouched down in front of his flatmate thinking while his fingers itched to remove that one rebellious curl that had fallen in front of Sherlock’s eye.
He knew it would be too much to actually go inside so he only opened the door so it was a crack open so he could smell John clearly and sit down on the floor.
He laughed at his own thoughts. Then his mind snapped back to the moment where he had felt John’s breath because his face had been right in front of it.
“Obviously, John, but he has to talk to the police to explain me. So that they’ll causeless trouble about working with me.”
Askiss turned into something more heated, John pulled away, and they pressed their foreheads together, both panting.
John laughed and shook his head while he shot Sherlock, who was grinning while drinking, a fond look.
After two weeks of really little sleep while having a lot of work at the surgery he was working at, John decided to make an appointment with his psychologist.
“Oh great! Now I’m crying! Are you happy now? I’m crying for the first time for at least twenty-five years! These damn hormones.”
Now John felt a bit foolish standing in the door to the living room out of breath and the look which Sherlock gave him didn’t make it better.
Sherlock pointed to three different girls, still grinning. “I suppose I’m better at these things than I thought I was. Or do you think it is due to gender? Maybe I’m just bad at flirting with men. What a shame. Why am I only good at something that’s so useless to me?”
“Oh yes, that’s what they did. They could look at you and know everything about you because of the states of your clothes or the twitching of your hand. They were brilliant. The younger one always said he wanted to be a detective after rehab. He helped me with some issues with my husband.”
Then her eyes went wide and she looked like a delighted child who just discovered a treasure full of candies.
Mrs Hudson smiled. “Oh, no Sir, you’re at the right door. I’m his landlady, Mrs Hudson. Are you a client?”
“Because I was obviously too weak to carry her farther and so I just carried her far enough for closing the door. And I put a pillow under her head, so she’s comfortable. You could at least give me credit for that.”
He looked into it and there was indeed a really panicked looking Sherlock. His eyes moved wildly like he wanted to look at everything at once.
The first sign for what was happening was the sinking snow around them-slowly you could see the grass beneath it.
“And then? I think that was the moment I knew that I was screwed. I had never met someone like him before.”
But he didn’t really pay attention to what he was reading because of a thought that befell him at night.
John had come after all very often to visit him but only they had known that this time wouldn’t be like the others.
John nodded into nothing full with emotion. He let his gaze wander through the whole room but he was alone. He nodded once, accepting that he wouldn’t see him again. He turned around to go to his room when he heard a voice.
“You know…” (embarrassed laugh) “I’m a bit short seeing and I’m not used to wearing my glasses when I go out. So I’m sorry if I…” She trailed off and continued rubbing her soaped hands together, seemingly trapped in her own thoughts all of a sudden.
Everyone knew what happens if an Alpha bites an Omega outside of heat. It forces the body to go into heat within hours which is painful and very stressful.
Just for one moment he foolishly thought that he might have changed his mind about bondings and that he maybe had discovered that he had feelings for him.
John could only stare at the beautiful man in front of him while he was opening his belt and trousers which didn’t hide his interest even a bit but John was pleased to see that Sherlock was in the very same state.
He looked immediately around to find the source only to see him with his back to him, wild discussing with Lestrade.
Sherlock’s wrists were still pinned in John’s hands, and he loosened his grip, smiling and shaking his head. His thumbs smoothed Sherlock’s skin as he admitted, almost shyly, “I love you so much.”
From that day they avoided that topic and just waited for Lestrade. They talked about everything and nothing. One evening John decided to play a game. He wanted to learn more about Sherlock and so he decided that they could ask each other alternating questions. After a bit of effort at persuasion, Sherlock agreed.
At this Sherlock was practically clawing at John’s back which would definitely leave marks but John didn’t mind in the slightest.
Right, aver she had finished high school, she had bonded with Lestrade’s and Molly’s son with whom she had been together for a year before that.
John thought that this was probably his last chance to ask, so he did. “Did… did something happen to you? I mean... something to make you think about this so much, and think it’s so bad?”
He couldn’t talk further. His voice had broken at the end and now he was fighting against the upcoming sobs in his throat.
“Don’t look so worried, John! Dad met her. I mean, knowing that she is my girlfriend. He … he was nice to her, and he said that he was happy for me.”
For a while, only their synchronic panting was to be heard until John’s knot swelled completely and united them.
“You know… I have always believed that something supernatural was in this house. I mean no one wanted to live here for long. And then you John came to me and asked me all this questions and this just confirmed it.”
John froze. He turned around very slowly. There in front of the mantelpiece was Sherlock Holmes. He stood there with an amused look on his face.
Lestrade tried to conciliate but the three of them just glared at each other. After a few moments, a sniffing sound broke the spell.
Half an hour later the blond man came back with a wheelbarrow. He stepped back into the grave only to notice that nothing had changed.
That night John dreamed about pale skin pressed against his and a familiar baritone voice moaning his name. He caressed the smooth skin under him while saying the name of his lover. He kissed the pink nipples and moved slowly upwards until he kissed his impossible long neck. The moaning grew needier and so he choked it with his lips. He put his hands into the dark curls then a hand sneaked to his hardness. John gasped and so a mouth was pressed to his ear. The voice only said two words.
He wore a dark tailored suit with a white shirt underneath and everything suited him like a second skin and showed how skinny he was.
He tried really hard to stay professional no matter what although seeing Sherlock topless again after such a short time was really something.
Sherlock nodded too, and went to the kitchen to make tea. He watched John out of the corner of his eye, and cringed as he saw how John was, once again, staring at nothing, lost in thoughts that belonged to the past. He had calculated all the possibilities that they had, and the one he suggested was the safest one - but he worried about John’s mental health.
“Oh I see, you have some attachment to him. You’ll get over it, I’m sure of that. You can always just delete him from your mind palace.”
“If you really wanted to get rid of me that bad you just had to ask me to move out! I even asked you if I should go and you said no! This is a really grotty way to do it! I never thought you would do something like that! After everything that…”
Lestrade leaned now on the doorframe on the room where Sherlock stood in front of a few plants that were possible sources of the new drug.
“Don’t you worry, Ms Wilkinson. We last met ten years ago. You were my daughter’s teacher till 3° grade, at primary school.”
On New Year’s Eve, the fireworks exploded over their heads and he could marvel at the colours that were shining on his partner’s face.
Lestrade told him that Liam got a life-sentence.  John gave that information to Sherlock who just nodded.
He let his gaze wander through the room until he stopped at the mantelpiece. The stones there looked weird. For a moment he thought he had seen something being reflected by it but it was probably nothing. He finished his tea and went to work.
John only laughed at that and after a bit of scrolling, he found her real name. It was Irene Adler and it was an ordinary name which made John only shake his head.
John would ask questions and he couldn’t deal with that just now. He needed time to think, time to make a plan and to be honest, he was looking forward to a quiet evening with John.
He also was proud of himself that he had managed to climb the stairs without help although he was exhausted and shaking everything he did it.
He thought about how proud his parents were when he went to the army as an army doctor and always showed off with him as the proud parents of a man who wanted to serve his country.
Luckily, by now, everyone was used to his sense of humour. Everyone laughed, and John could finally relax.
Sherlock lifted his fingers and looked at them but nothing looked different. Then the prickling got worse. It felt like about a million ants were crawling over his whole body. This was getting uncomfortable. Suddenly he realized that he couldn’t move anymore. He was paralysed. He could only move his eyes. Then there was a feeling that he hadn’t felt for a long time. Fear.
John was frozen. He didn’t know what to do. Hesitantly he lifted two fingers to put them on the neck to feel if there was a pulse. His fingers were shaking. That was embarrassing.
As Sherlock didn’t answer, he leaned forward and sniffed along his neck and that’s where Sherlock had enough.
John stood up and put his cup into the sink, and then he hesitated. He had a presumption why Sherlock had reacted this frustrated earlier. He thought a moment about how he could approach that subject again but then he decided that it would be the best just to say it. If he was wrong then… he didn’t want to think about this possibility.
He looked at the crowd of people and police officers and waited for someone to volunteer the answer. He was met with silence, and after letting it stretch somewhat uncomfortably, he sighed, frustrated.
They both groaned at this but John held still for a while before Sherlock was adjusted to the stretch and gave him the signal to move.
“I know that you see that differently but I want to bond because of love and have children and not because it’s convenient. I’m sorry that this will happen to you but I can’t help and I would appreciate it if you would never ask me that again okay?”
“But actually I just want to thank you. You saved my life. You didn’t need to do that but you did. I mean you were though the reason why I thought I was mentally ill but I think that you didn’t calculate that I would kill myself instead of moving out. So I forgive you and I’m just truly thankful that you saved me. I …okay that was all I wanted to say. Okay.”
Every time Peyton told them about a special exciting case, they would come and “help” or just spending time with her since she didn’t really need their help anymore.
First, he gently removed the jacket and let it fall to the ground, and then he grabbed the jumper John was wearing that day and put it over his head.
That was the only thing he had learned back then in The Clinic, in group therapy, seven months after Maddie’s death.
So...my knowledge in chemistry is...not really existent :D But I asked a lot of people and did a lot of research for this chapter^^ But if something can't really work in reality then please just ignore it and enjoy the story :)
Sherlock gasped and cramped a bit but when John looked at him he gave him a nod and so John massaged his hole further and used his knowledge until Sherlock was gasping for a completely different reason.
John cleared his throat. “We have to tell you something,” he started. Now he had the attention of everyone in the room. He froze for a moment until Sherlock’s left hand grabbed his right shoulder to show him that he was there. He inhaled deeply.
Without meaning to Sherlock barred his teeth and snarled. This reaction shocked him that much that he was back in reality, blinking.
Obviously encouraged by this, Sherlock started to open his own shirt. Then he also removed his trousers and started to work at John’s belt.
With that he placed a kiss in Sherlock’s wild curls and said man had a serious blackout and didn’t react at all which made – to Sherlock’s irritation- John laugh.
It became clear quite quickly that John showed no intentions of continuing their actions, and Sherlock’s stare morphed into a pronounced pout.
“And what if it was?” Sherlock demands, harshly. “How would you know? I was out of my mind, I needed something drastic to bring me back. I know you think you were just out of control, but you know me like no one ever has. I’m yours and I know you never would have hurt me, not in a way that matters. If you can’t trust your own judgement…trust mine?”
"The mercury," Sherlock says slowly, the word feeling alien and thick on his tongue. "It's in the adjuvant but not the Hound drug. It reacts with the... the... things.. organophosphates... in the drug and precipitates out to create a... coating. What's it called? Conductive film, a build-up on the myelin sheaths that impairs or disables their ability to function. It makes the effect of the drug unpredictable... and lasting. Everything goes..."
She cut him off. “It doesn’t matter what you are or aren’t. But you need to face the fact that he’s the most important thing in your life. Until you do, you’ll always be making promises you won’t be able to keep.”
Sherlock allows himself to be roughly untied from the chair without a struggle and frogmarched out of the room and through a narrow corridor. He focuses on discreetly flexing arms and legs to restore circulation.
Sherlock opens his mouth in stunned self-defence before he realises John is teasing. John has to stifle a laugh behind his hands at the appalled expression on Sherlock’s face. Sherlock only realises how worried he’d been when relief shoots through him that John is joking with him again.
“What are you talking about? And how do you – no, you know what, never mind. I really don’t want to the answer to that.”
Sherlock opens his mouth and licks. It's the inside of John's wrist. He laps at it and then cranes his neck to follow all along the inside of John's arm to his axilla, raising gooseflesh under his mouth as he goes. "Salt... curry from dinner... coconuts... antiperspirant... sweat... copper... nutmeg."
Sherlock shakes his head. “No. The contract is still active, Moriarty is dead so he can never recall it. They are not watching as closely as they were, but…it isn’t safe.”
Out of practise, it takes him a little time to craft the right persona to go unnoticed. There's not much to be done about his height or features, but shoddy clothes, a few days’ growth of beard, and a stocking hat, when combined with a stooping, sullen posture, do wonders for concealing his identity.
John grins to himself. “I would think that should be obvious by now, but yes. Tattoo your name on my heart, I’m all yours.” Sherlock perks up noticeably and John amends, “
When John has stilled and Sherlock can go without air no longer, he releases John and then dissolves onto the floor besides him, physically and emotionally spent. He doesn’t know what he expects to happen next, but it isn’t for John to settle solemnly next him, to fit himself into the curve of Sherlock’s arm and rest his sandy head on Sherlock’s chest, to stroke Sherlock’s leg with his foot and let out a long sigh. John feels different now; the pain is still there, but it’s dulled, and the fear is gone. Any space that had existed between them, the small amount before he’d gone and the yawning chasm when he’d returned, has been erased. John feels real. John feels like his.
“John,” Sherlock says, not a question. Even in her anger at him, she’d wanted to spare him the knowledge of the full extremity of John’s grief.
Ms. Adler, still clad only in Sherlock's best dressing gown, asks him a question and he ignores her.
“Yes, thank you.” So Sherlock is still feeling guilty, John thinks, a little smugly. Or at least thinks John is still angry with him a bit, which amounts to the same thing in Sherlock’s mind. While he plays the violin often, both for his own sanity and John’s amusement, the only times he ever
“Just because he acts like he doesn’t need or care about anyone doesn’t make it true, even if he’d prefer not to believe it himself. He talks to you when you’re not there, John.”
"I did think of contacting his immediate family after his remains were... returned to them. But I fear contact with me might only add to their distress."
Sherlock is silent for a long time and John waits patiently, relieved for a break from talking and hoping his friend won’t require further explanation.
John shakes his head. “Do you think you’re going to die? Is that what this is is? Do you think he’s going to kill you?
Sherlock turns onto his stomach. John promptly straddles his waist and Sherlock is made vividly aware that John is also completely naked.
When John finally turns back to look at Sherlock, his face is a battlefield of emotions and his aura is riotously coloured. "Sherlock..." he trails off.
Sherlock feels his climax begin to grow, a barely remembered sensation known only from distant teenage wankings, starting in his belly and spreading out through his pelvis, his spine, his buttocks and at last between his legs, unstoppable now. He stills and jerks and John stops his stroking and just holds them together as Sherlock shudders under his hand, hips twitching and pressing into John’s body. Sherlock can feel the warm wetness of his orgasm spreading between them, slicking their stomachs, their cocks, John’s hand.
Sherlock began to laugh, very quietly at first and then louder, as though he had just gotten some great cosmic joke. He had thought he had been hallucinating again while Moran was speaking, but he now realized what he was actually seeing and he could not keep himself from chuckling at the utter absurdity of what was happening.
"We've got it under control," John tells Bryant soothingly. "Nothing is going to happen to you. Just call if you find out anything about a shipment and we'll be along immediately, and if there's problem with the police we'll handle it for you. Okay?"
“I don’t believe that was my question,” Sherlock said, struggling to sit up. He began unhooking himself from the various IVs and monitors they had him tangled up in. Machines beeped and nurses ran in to check on him, thinking he was coding, but Lestrade waved them off.
John nodded. It was bad, but not a fatal overdose. Nothing to do but ride it out, now.  “Sherlock, why did you come up here to my room? Why are you wearing my trousers?”
And, of course, Mycroft is right – he will never find all of Moriarty’s associates much less bring them to justice. But that’s not the point of this exercise. Criminals are not notorious loyal, particularly past death. But Moriarty would have accounted for that, he would have installed ways to make sure his orders regarding Sherlock stayed in place long after he was gone. That system, whatever it was, is what Sherlock needs to dismantle in order to get his life back.
Mycroft gives him a look of weary patience. “Sherlock didn’t tell me anything. Do I really need to explain to you how this works?”
from her, or maybe it’s that it’s hard to feel like part of a couple when the other half barely acknowledges your existence.
Mycroft rings off and Sherlock puts his head back against the tree and closes his eyes, wishing he could go back to not feeling anything at all.
Sherlock plunges his face into John's hair and breathes him in. "You smell of... palm trees and hot sun and lust and herbal soap..." he manages.
Sherlock gives a low chuckle and makes a sudden turn. “Ricco’s down this way does a nice strip. I exposed his daughter’s fiancé as a con-man before she could marry him.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to reply but is stopped by a cold spray right by his face. It hits John too and John sneezes.
“Just one of them. And my business is my own. I can assure you, however, I’m no friend of their organisation or anyone in it. And I have no quarrel with you.”
The no-more-drugs rule is never explicitly stated, and Sherlock is not sure if it is actually a rule at all, but he certainly doesn’t seem to need them as much with this new activity serving to both calm him and stimulate him variously as needed. And he has a sneaking suspicion if John sees drugs again, condoms will also miraculously appear, and that is something he is interested in avoiding at all costs.
“Not… really. Only take a minute, just a little paperwork.” Sherlock is extremely chuffed with himself for actually remembering something John had said he’d wanted. And right before Christmas, too. Sherlock doesn’t care about Christmas - except for the presents and lights and the chance of some creatively festive sex - but John loves it. He wonders if he’ll be able to count this as John’s Christmas present.
Pain radiates from various parts of him where he hit the floor. Everything is still silent and dark, his head still spins and his stomach still turns, and fear is rooted in in his mind, but he’s a person again. At least he thinks so. He's Sherlock Holmes, isn't he? And John Watson is with him. Frantically trying to speak to him.
“The ship – no name, just a registration number – left Reykjavik two days ago,” he tells John reluctantly. “Ultimate destination of Mersin, Turkey. But it’s scheduled to make port in Inverness on Friday on its way there.”
John can see this is not an idle request, Sherlock stirring again already at his touch, and he smiles, pulling Sherlock on top of him and rising to meet his mouth, the heat of his body, the thrust of his hips. John runs his hands up Sherlock’s back, tangles them in his hair, and then slips down, beneath Sherlock to take his length in his mouth, feeling him grow hard under his lips, gripping his buttocks firmly to control the speed of his motions. John has never done anything even remotely like this before, but it feels completely normal and he can tell from Sherlock’s soft gasps that he is on the right track.
“Well, it’s only a five right now John,” Sherlock informs him primly. “I put the address in your phone. Take a coat, it’s chilly.”
Mycroft sits and sighs. “You would really like to believe that, wouldn’t you? Do you honestly not see what you are doing here?”
When Christmas morning dawns, Sherlock is still locked away. John cancels on Harry and snags a few hours of sleep in his own room before going back downstairs to the deafening silence of the closed and impenetrable door. He sits in the kitchen, drinking cup after cup of coffee and futilely willing it to open.
Sherlock glances at John. “Neither. I felt like dancing. I haven’t done it in a long time. You were the only person there who was not completely odious to me. It made sense at the time. Did I embarrass you?”
Weeks pass. John heals. They do not speak of that case or the events surrounding it. New cases come, some exciting, some dull. There is a new tension between them. They are careful around each other. When they touch accidentally, both jump. John starts looking for a new girlfriend, feeling hard up but unable to resign himself to casual sex. He fails, miserably, unusual for him – he gives off the ultimate nice-guy vibe and has never had trouble getting a date before, although with Sherlock around keeping them has been much more of a challenge. He refuses to think of the possibility that his heart is not in it this time.
“I can understand why. Some weird stuff happens in this house. That’s why I want to know what happened there.”
But he was also very sensitive although he didn’t show it very often. I remember when the family dog died, he cried and cried for hours but after that, he didn’t talk about it anymore.”
Everyone seemed comfortable and content. Even his father’s arm lay on his mother’s shoulders. John looked to Sherlock to ask - without words - if he was ready.
At the same time, he was glad that John was safe for now because he was smaller and protected by a shadow although it wouldn’t have lasted forever.
When John prepared to go downstairs he hoped it wouldn’t be awkward because of what he had said. His dream didn’t help but he was the only one who knew about this. Or so he hoped at least.
He deduced every dark secret from his unwanted admirers which always let John feel the pride of him.
“I wanted to bond with you so badly because I couldn’t stand the image of someone else getting you, believe me. But at the same time, I knew the possible consequences and so I let you free. But never ever doubt my intentions, John.”
“Oh, sweetheart of course not. This kind of rituals we’re talking about is way older than money. You’ll demand life and that’s what you’ll have to give in return.”
He packed everything in his backpack and started to push the wheelbarrow to his car that he had wisely rented.
“Yes, he deduces. He can figure out more or less everything about  you with just one look. When we first met, the first thing he said to me was ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’”
The enthusiastic explanation he’d prepared about his current experiment died on his tongue. Instead, he focused his considerable powers of deduction towards  John.
Sherlock laughed. “Sure. We had a really hard case to solve, with a lot of bodies, and I was really frustrated so I yelled at a few incompetent police people. Then  I suddenly had a breakthrough, came to a sudden realisation, and  just told everyone what happened and solved the case. And when I looked around, everyone looked completely baffled, but John was just staring at me with this weird look on his face, and then he marched up to me, grabbed my face and kissed me. Then he fell on his knee and asked me if I wanted to marry him. For a moment I was so perplexed that I couldn’t say anything, and then I recovered and said yes. The end.”
Sherlock felt hands on his cheek. It was moving quickly, in frantic movements. Who? Who would be worrying about him? These hands were much too large to be Mrs. Hudson's. Much too rough too. These hands they... they felt the size of John's… John’s hands...
“Honestly, John, you’re the first person I’ve ever allowed to leave a single mark,” Sherlock looked over at his doctor, his eyes had widened a little bit at that and his breathing accelerated, clearly a little aroused by the information despite the very recent orgasm. “If I cared about visibility at all I wouldn’t have let you leave them in the first place. I do rather enjoy your possessive streak. I hadn’t expected that one.”
John could feel his orgasm drawing near, curling in the pit of his stomach, and he slid on of his hands from Sherlock’s hip to take his erection in hand and stroke it in time with the rise and fall of his hips. “John,” Sherlock moaned, his hips stuttering and the muscles in his thighs beginning to flutter. John quickly flipped Sherlock back onto his back and thrusted into his lover hard and fast, aiming right of the man’s prostate.
The men remained in silence for several minutes, only the sound of their breathing between them. Sherlock slowly tipped his head down so his nose was almost touching John’s now dry hair and inhaled slowly, John had always calmed him simply by existing. Sherlock dedicate the smell of John’s fresh washed hair to his memory, safe keeping for the next time he was feeling overwhelmed by the world around him. John centered him. Brought him back to reality. Sherlock had always hoped that something greater would develop between him and his best friend, but after the fall, after he had betrayed his friend so greatly, nothing had ever been the same and the possibility faded away with Sherlock’s hope. John had fallen in love while he was gone and Sherlock had stood aside as the only person he had ever loved got married and started a family.
Sherlock very slightly heard his phone go off through the haze of his mind. Part of him knew it was John and that John was probably worrying. But another part of him said that thinking that was irrational. John didn't care. John had left him. Sherlock took another hit of a drug he couldn't remember the name of. The name didn't matter. It helped the pain.
“John, why are you still being so kind to me?” Sherlock’s voice sounded as though he was on the verge of tears and he was still refusing to meet John’s eyes.
It was several minutes later when Sherlock finally pulled away, “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.”
Sherlock led the blonde outside and quickly hailed a cab. After giving the address he sat back in his seat and looked out of the window, he may be desperate enough to have gotten this far, but there was no way he was about to do foreplay in the back of a grungy London cab.
All John could focus on was the thump of his feet on the pavement like the second hand on the clock ticking as time passed by. He skidded to a stop in front of 221B twisting the handle slamming the door behind him as he rushed up the stairs. "Sherlock? Sherlock I'm here! I'm coming" He called.
“Sshhhh,” John soothed the younger man, running his hands up and down the sides if his narrow body, “I’m going to take care of you, Sherlock.” John, true to his word, leaned down and took the entirely of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth, the tip hitting the back of his throat as he fought back his gag reflex.
John took out his phone for the sixth time in the last two hours and texted Sherlock. "Sherlock, Lestrade said he has been trying to get a hold of you all day. Are you alright? -JW”
“John,” Sherlock breathed, frustration hinting at the edges of the pleasure in his voice. “Touch me, kiss me, fuck me, anything you want. I’m yours, John.”
When he was spent, John collapsed onto the bed next to his detective. They were both breathing erratically and they looked at each other, eyes full of admiration for the other. “You,” John struggled through heavy breaths, “are amazing, Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock tried so hard to will his lips to move. To create words but he couldn't. He pushed his vocal chords to make noise and a small whimper-ish sound came out. That was all he could manage but he hoped it was enough.
A doctor came out.  “Friend or family?" He had asked John. But Watson didn't know how to answer. He wasn't family no. But, was he even allowed to be considered a friend?
John sighed, “I supposed I’m doing as well as can be expected, Sherlock.” John paused. Something was bothering the detective and he was going to figure out what it was. John lifted one of his arms and brushed it through Sherlock’s hectic curls, “However, this was traumatic for you too. Are you okay?”
Sherlock froze momentarily, eyes wide, before melting into the kiss and taking John’s lower lip between his teeth and biting softly, forgetting the man he had abandoned in the hallway. After several moments the kiss broke and both men pulled away breathless, leaning their foreheads together.
“From the moment you returned, she’s known that I would never be able to love her the way that I love you, Sherlock. She knew that if I had to live without one of you I would always choose to have you,” John was crying now as he looked up at the detective. “She saved your life because she knew it also meant saving my own.”
“I just wanted to ask you something and I didn’t want to do it in class,” John cleared his throat awkwardly. This was it. Be brave, Watson. “Sherlock, I- the person I have feelings for-” John kept his eyes to the ground unable to look the dark haired boy in the eyes.
When they reached their destination Sherlock tossed some money at the driver and led the other man inside, swiftly past Mrs. Hudson, and up the stair to his flat where he opened the door to a rather unexpected sight: John was already home and was sitting in his chair reading the paper.
John chuckled. Sherlock was right of course, but it was more than that. The London sunset was peaking through the window, painting the detective’s pale skin with subtle shades of orange and pink. His face was flushed and his hair was a bloody mess as his curls shifted gently with each movement. Sherlock really was stunning, there was no question.
Sherlock had never once in his life begged to be fucked. It always tended to be the other way around, he liked to have men beg for him. Make them plead until he fucked them or let them fuck him. Other men had been more than willing to do so, desperate in their wanting, sometime it had even seemed too easy.
Sherlock was slipping deeper and deeper into the darkness. Even within his deep subconscious, he could sense that he had only so long left. He hoped when someone found him that it wouldn't be John or Mrs. Hudson. That was the last thing that he wanted.
Sherlock heard the voice clearer now. He knew this voice. This was John. No. Not John. He didn't want John to remember him like this. Sherlock willed his eyes to open slightly. "J-John I-I-" Sherlock's voice cut out and his body fell slack. He was out. He had very little time left.
John looked into his lover’s eyes, so full of emotion behind the arousal, and gasped. “I love you too, Sherlock Holmes. Of course I’m sure.”
“Oh, sod off,” Sherlock breathed, his breath hitching as John quickly inserted his finger the rest of the way and crooked it to brush the detective’s prostate. He waited only momentarily before removing the finger entirely and reinserting it beside a second, pushing them in as far as was possible. Sherlock hissed at the suddenness but it turned quickly into a moan as the pain melted away into pleasure. “Now that’s what I was expecting from Captain John Watson,” Sherlock smirked, watching as John’s pupils dilated. “Oh, do you like me calling attention to your rank, Captain?” Sherlock’s voice twisted seductively around the title, observing once again how John’s body reacted. This was going to be fun.
When he walked through the doors everyone was looking at him, something he had become relatively used to lately as a side effect of his social status and openness of his sexuality, but this time it was different.
“You want more? I’ll give you more, Sherlock,” John’s voice had turned almost dangerous in a matter of seconds and Sherlock felt his cock somehow becoming even more interested in the situation as it strained against the tight material of his trousers. He struggled in an attempt to lift his hips and make John more aware of the material that still covered the bottom half of his body, but his attempt failed and only make John’s wicked smirk turn more sinister as he leaned down and attached his lips to one of Sherlock’s nipples, biting at it, just the right side of too hard. John grabbed Sherlock’s scarf that was conveniently draped over headboard where he had most likely flung it before going out earlier that night and used it to tie the younger man’s wrists together above his head and then wound the ends around the headboard, effectively trapping him.
John grinned, his stinging eyes being soothed by the tears that were now pricking the corners of them. "Oh Sherlock. I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry. Please forgive me.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, he knew he had no reason to feel nervous, but still, the feeling persisted, “Go on a date with me?”
Sherlock’s vision went black for several seconds. He had had lovers in the past and it had entailed blowjobs, but the knowledge that it was John’s mouth around his cock made everything that much more exhilarating. Time seemed to be standing still, the only movement that mattered was the slow, wet drag of John’s lips up and down his length and the flick of John’s tongue over the tip each time. Sherlock tugged against the scarf that held his wrists captive, he could easily slip out of the soft material, but he had absolutely no wish to do so.
The other boy’s eyes went wide, he hadn’t expected the anger. “I-I just thought that you would want to know.”
Sherlock signaled the blonde- honestly he should have paid more attention to the man’s name- to wait in the hall for a moment. “I thought you had the late shift tonight?” Sherlock questioned casually.
“You? A long day? You’re captain of the rugby team, the most popular boy in school, tons of friends, and evidently a secret admirer,” Sherlock scoffed, but listened intently for the blonde’s response. He had been horrified to walk into school and find his confession taped up on every wall, but was thankful at least that no one knew, he supposed there were some perks to not having anyone to tell his secrets to so long as he didn’t have to worry about them being revealed. But he was curious of what John must think of this whole situation. Had he asked Mike Stamford to make the fliers?
John just barely nodded. His wife.... yeah. John had one of those, didn't he. Bloody hell he'd screwed up.
John attempted to walk past Sherlock without making eye contact, but when he was only maye one step away from each other the detective’s deep baritone spoke, “John.” The doctor’s eyes immediately snapped up and he was instantly lost in the current deep blue shade of Sherlock’s eyes. They were mere inches apart and he glanced from his eyes down to Sherlock’s lips. In his new level of closeness he could clearly see that the man’s lips were swollen and the jealousy that was coursing through him took control and he leaned forward to capture them with his own.
“Please, John,” Sherlock moaned, suddenly free of his hesitations. “Please, John I need you. Please fuck me. I need you to fuck me.”
Of course, after Sherlock had realized he had fallen head over heels for his flatmate the work did little to distract him from that. So for four years Sherlock had had an itch in his mind palace that he had been entirely unable to scratch. It was infuriating honestly. Surely after four years there should be some sort of relief, but it seemed that with each passing day the urge only intensified.
Mike rolled his eyes, “John just came out at bisexual, it wouldn’t hurt to find the bloke who is  -how did he word it?- ’hopelessly in love’ with him.” Mike pulled out his cell phone and snapped a few pictures before zooming it in to enlarge the writing. “This handwriting is really unique, surely someone’s ought to recognize it.”
“I got off early, slow night,” John replied with a shrug, not looking up from his paper. “Where’ve you been?”
John paused momentarily. He couldn’t very well just ask Sherlock after that comment. What if Sherlock turned out to be straight? It would completely ruin this small friendship -was it a friendship?- that they had formed. “Well if it’s that simple a question, why don’t you answer it?” That would work, not too obvious.
John spun the detective away from the door and walked him backwards until his knees hit the bed and Sherlock fell effortlessly onto the plush mattress. Sherlock rushed to place himself fully on the bed and John followed quickly after him, straddling his hips and steadying himself with a hand on either side of the detective’s mess of curls. Sherlock took advantage of his now free hands and pulled John’s jumper up, John got the memo and quickly finished the John and removed his vest after it, baring his chest completely before returning his lips to his lover’s. Sherlock’s hands began to travel the muscular expanse of John’s back, arms, and chest, dedicating a room in his mind palace to the memorization of every inch of skin.
Sherlock's heart sped up again. What did John mean by that? What was he saying? God Sherlock was confused. He couldn’t comprehend what he was hearing.
Regardless of John's words Sherlock continued to try to speak. He managed to gain control of his jaw. "J-John" Sherlock stuttered out, his voice raspy and heavy.
Around noon the next day, Sherlock was aware. He couldn't move and he couldn't speak. But he was aware. And he felt the hand that was holding his. He was confused. Who would be doing such an intimate thing? And to him, of all people?
John heard the heart rate monitor pick up and he picked his head up looking over at it then back to Sherlock. God he was going to be okay wasn't he.
“Honestly John, I didn’t think it would be this easy to make you beg,” Sherlock smirked. “I was really hoping for a little bit more from you.”
John smiled cockily into the younger man’s neck and shifted his hips forward, not stopping until he was buried deep inside of his lover.
“You’re beautiful, John,” Sherlock breathed as he leaned in to rest his head on John’s upper thigh and wrapped his hand around the thick cock just inches from his face. He gave a few slow pumps, listening intently to the heady moans coming from above him. Sherlock removed his hand and moved in closer, pressing featherlight kisses to the shaft and slowly traveling upwards.
And now, only hours after the man’s wife had died, Sherlock had almost thought it appropriate to make a love confession. Not one of his best moments.
Now it was John’s turn to look surprised. “Oh?" His lips curved into a wide smile, "you’re the one who’s ‘hopelessly in love with the rugby captain’?” John teased.
The paramedics rushed in and John let them lift the lifeless woman from his lap, trying to ignore the sympathetic looks they were giving him. Mary was gone long before they arrived, John knew that. There would be no bringing her back.
Sherlock smiled as he leaned down to press their lips together that was different than the previous ones, if was slower, more intimate. Sherlock removed himself from his lover’s lips only briefly to finish removing his shirt before removing and connecting their lips once again. Sherlock rolled his hips down, mimicking his earlier actions on the sofa. Sherlock slowly began to explore John’s skin, his neck his collarbones, his soft yet muscular chest and coarse hair that lightly coated it. Sherlock slowly inched his way down the smooth expanse of skin until his lips met the edge of John’s trousers and poised his hands on the button before looking up at John for one last confirmation.
“It’s okay. I didn’t mean to pry or be rude. I guess I’ve just had a long day,” John sighed, thankful Sherlock had broken the tension.
“Yes,” Sherlock half moaned. When John slipped his finger into the first knuckle Sherlock pushed down on it, trying to bury it deeper. “I’m not a virgin, John, you don’t need to be so gentle.”
And this is how the detective found himself in an upscale club in central London with his lips attached to those of an attractive blonde- who he was trying to convince himself he was attracted to for reasons other than his similarities to his flatmate.
“Ah,” Mike gave his friend a small smile and grabbed his shoulder. “Well, does it hurt to know all of your options mate? Maybe that fella is the one who wrote the message.”
Several minutes passed until they were both breathing normally and John left the room to grab a flannel to wipe them off. When he returned he wiped his lover’s chest before spreading his legs and leaning down to look at where his own release was dripping from Sherlock’s well fucked arse, he took a moment to appreciate the sight, the proof that Sherlock was his and no one else’s, before wiping it away.
The rugby captain pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. “I’m sorry, Mike I didn’t mean to yell. I just… I kinda… I have feelings for someone already,” John rubbed the back of his neck, one of his frequent nervous ticks.
John shifted back and brought a hand to the younger boy's high cheekbone, looking into those beautiful blue eyes. "It’s okay, Sherlock. Because rumor has it the rugby captain is hopelessly in love with you too.”
The moment their lips met both men knew that things were going to work out. Their lives would continue on. The pain, the heartache, the loss, would all be manageable so long as they had each other.
“It’s okay. I’m just going to take care of you, John. Relax. Breathe. I’m here for you.” John slumped easily against his best friend and sighed as Sherlock’s nimble fingers massaged shampoo into his scalp.
It took only a few more minutes until Sherlock was clenching around John’s cock as his orgasm hit him and he came in ropes across his chest with John’s name on his lips. A few more thrusts into Sherlock’s tight heat and John was following him with what had to be the most intense orgasm in his entire life.
Sherlock smiled gently down at the army doctor and nodded, John was generally too proud to ask for comfort, how could he deny him when he was desperate enough to ask for it? Sherlock moved to the other side of the bed and laid down before he realized he had no clue what the protocol was here. Did John just want him to be here with no physical contact? Did he want to talk? Did he want to be held? Sherlock decided he would stay still until John initiated the next movement.
After several more thrusts, Sherlock wrapped his legs around the older man’s hips and squeezed him tightly, using the leverage to roll them over so he was now seated on his lover’s cock. “I love you, John,” he moaned as he rotated his hips, “But that was getting to be ridiculous.”
This... this was John. Sherlock felt his heart rate speed up therefore making the monitor beep faster. John... John was here... John was holding his hands... John kissed his hand... John... didn't want to lose him..?
“John, you misunderstand,” Sherlock spoke softly, opening his eyes to look into John’s own bright blues. “I am struggling to convey my own emotions, but I assure you, John, I do reciprocate.” Sherlock tipped his head down cautiously, allowing John the opportunity to pull away from the gesture. He didn’t.
Sherlock's heart started racing. The monitor next to his bed was going crazy. John cared about him... John... John loves him... John loves him! God why was he incapable of speaking or moving? Why couldn't he tell John he loves him to and throw his arms around him and kiss him?
He tried not to let his brain think of the peculiar nature of this situation. He was naked as the day he was born with Sherlock Holmes pressed to his back, fully clothed, as he bathed him. Long ago John had fantasized about showering with his best friend, but he had never imagined that it would look like this when it finally happened. So much had changed between now and then. John had moved out of 221B, gotten married, had a child. But now life was changing again and he had no idea where it was headed.
“You know I don’t have a regular sleep schedule, I’ll be fine,” Sherlock responded, looking at his fried with a great deal of concern.
“Sherlock,” John choked out, looking up the the detective. He felt lost. This couldn’t really be happening right?
What Sherlock did not know though, was that every Friday the rugby team would hang out behind the wall and joke around, reading some of the fresh ink. And it just so happened that only an hour after Sherlock had left, Mike Stamford discovered the tiny scribble.
John sighed, “Mike. Of course it was Mike.” John took the flier and ran down the hall to Mike’s locker, looking for the boy with murder on his mind. When he finally found him John shouted, “Mike! Why on Earth would you do this without talking to me?”
His thoughts continued through the night as the sun rose and flooded the room with natural light and John began to stir awake. John yawned and slowly opened his eyes. He smiled when he realized Sherlock was still there with his arms wrapped around him. “Good morning,” John whispered, his voice still a little bit rough from crying.
Sherlock heard John's voice and tried to will himself to speak. But he couldn't move his mouth. He couldn't force his vocal chords to make a single sound. 'Dammit Sherlock! Say something!' He told himself.
"Get him in there now! N..now!" John sobbed not wanting to pull himself away but knowing he had too.  "Sherlock, it’s going to be alright. Sherlock Please hold on."
Sherlock stood straight again, removing his gaze from the microscope and turning toward his lab partner. “I happen to be gay, John.”
John steadied himself on one arm so he could begin working on the button’s of Sherlock’s purple button down, “I love this shirt, but it needs to go now,” he managed through ragged breathing. When the buttons were undone, John ran his hand over the long expanse of Sherlock’s chest, enjoying the smooth skin of the body below him. Slowly he began trailing kissed down Sherlock’s jaw and neck, stopping to kiss each dark bruise he had left in his onslaught earlier. His lips trailed down to the detective’s beautiful, prominent collarbones, he licked a trail from the base of Sherlock’ sternum to the hollow of his throat and the low moan that was released from the younger man’s throat urged him on.
John began enthusiastically biting and kissing down the detective’s neck. He let his lips trail down to Sherlock’s collarbone where he sucked and bit a dark bruise into the sensitive flesh and then repeated this along the entire expanse of the younger man’s pale neck. When he was finished John pulled away momentarily to admire his work and Sherlock observed John as he watched the doctor’s pupils dilate impossibly further.
John started trusting his finger into Sherlock’s body with a renewed vigor, suddenly out of patience to play games and desperate to have his cock buried in the tight heat that wrapped deliciously around his fingers. After a couple minutes he once again withdrew his fingers and reinserted three, going all the way to the last knuckle.
Before too long both John and Sherlock were packed in the back of one of the ambulances that had shown up. There wasn't much the workers in the back could do but try keep him on oxygen as they made their way to the hospital.
John turned to leave but Sherlock grabbed his hand and pulled him back towards him and led him down the hall and into the abandoned auditorium, Sherlock turned back to him and grabbed the blonde’s face between his hands. The next thing John knew, his lips were pressed to the softest lips he had ever felt and his hands were around Sherlock’s small waist, holding him close.
Sherlock adjusted the water temperature until it was satisfactory before turning back to the older man. Sherlock gently removed John’s clothing trying not to make the moment seem to intimate, but not wanting to rush him either. When John was stripped down Sherlock walked him over to the shower and stepped in behind him, still fully clothed.
"Sherlock! It's John! Please!" He could hear the footsteps up the stairs. He kissed him again frantically. "Sherlock I’m sorry. If you can hear me.... please god. I love you don't leave me.”
Sherlock Holmes was a wonderful lab partner, smarter than any of the other students in the class, John included, but he never insisted on doing the lab himself. In fact, Sherlock seemed to even value John’s opinion sometimes, even when he was entirely wrong.
John laughed a little, “Unsettling? No, not at all.” John paused for a moment and pulled his head back from the microscope to allow Sherlock a turn. When Sherlock was no longer looking at him John gathered the courage to finish his thought. “I just feel bad for the bloke because I already have feelings for someone else.”
“Well, I had to do something after you completely shut me down by saying you were married to your work,” John argued.
Home. Where was home now? To go back to the house he had shared with his now deceased spouse didn’t feel right. 221B? Would that become home again? John let his thoughts wander as Sherlock pulled him from the ground and let him out of the building and into a car.
Sherlock immediately stopped his ministrations and pulled away from the blonde’s neck and looked at him with wide eyes. “What’s wrong?”
John sighed half in pleasure and half in frustration, but he had lost the will to fight against his body’s demands. He placed one of his hands on the detective’s hips and the other moved to Sherlock’s jaw to remove his lips from his neck so he could attach them to his own. Sherlock sighed into the kiss and quickly slipped his tongue between the older man’s lips.
After the teacher had given the lesson and they were left to complete the lab procedures Sherlock spoke again, “I didn’t mean to snap at you, John, I’m sorry.”
John placed his lips on Sherlock’s and pulled the other man closer to him until their chests were pressed together. “God, how have we been so stupid?”
“John. I need you. Fuck, I need you, God, John.” The detective was so overwhelmed that his words were running together.
When they arrived Sherlock gently, hesitantly took the widow’s hand and directed him out of the car, into the doors, and up the stairs. When they were safely inside the little piece of the world that John had always sworn seemed safe from the outside world despite the mayhem that overtook it frequently, Sherlock gently removed John’s jacket and directed him toward the bathroom.
John sat up once again surprised. "Sherlock...Don't. Shh." he pressed a finger to the others lips, "you don't need to tell me how dumb I'm being I know."
Everything suddenly clicked in John’s head and he felt a sudden and intense surge of jealousy. Sherlock had clearly not been expecting him because he was bringing someone into the flat. Someone who was responsible for the state of Sherlock’s appearance. John cleared his throat awkwardly, “uh, I was just uh... “ he stood and set the paper down on the table, “going to bed.”
Somehow John knew this was his fault. There had to be some connection with him and what Sherlock had done. “Sherlock! Sherlock come back to me please!" John pleaded. He picked up his phone like he should have done the moment he got there and phoned Lestrade. When the DI picked up he practically yelled into the phone, "I NEED AN AMBULANCE NOW GREG. 221B NOW." He didn't even give time to hang up he just dropped the phone and put a hand to Sherlock's cheek.
Several minutes later Sherlock broke the kiss and the two men leaned on each other, breathing heavily. “You’re a bloody idiot,” Sherlock managed through ragged breaths. “How long?”
“We’re both so stupid,” Sherlock laughed as he leaned down to connect their lips once again. This time the kiss was deep and passionate, both men seeming desperate to be closer to the other. Sherlock began walking backwards until the back of his knees hit the sofa before turning them around and lowering John to the sofa and straddling the shorter man’s hips, never letting their lips separate.
Sherlock looked wrecked, his neck and collarbones had countless bruises that would definitely visible no matter how the man attempted to arrange himself tomorrow, his lips were swollen and parted slightly, a dark pink tink covered his cheekbones and traveled in a lighter gradient across the rest of his face, and his eyes were alert but not in their normal way, Sherlock looked as though most his mind was floating far beyond his reach and what remained of it was this moment and his arousal and John. The rest of the world could have burst into flames and Sherlock wouldn’t have noticed or cared because John fucking Watson had him tied to a damn bed and it was more than he ever could have dreamed of.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, “Shit. One moment.” Sherlock turned toward the door and took a couple steps before turning back to look at John, “Don’t go anywhere.”
Sherlock vaguely felt pressure on his lips. Had...had someone kissed him? He was very confused. Was he imagining all this?
“You heard me,” John retorted, looking down at his lover with his best Captain Watson smile. He leaned in closer, kissing up the man’s bruised neck until he reached his ear. “Your Captain told you to say please. I want you to beg for my cock, Sherlock. One little word and I’ll fuck you until you can’t move,” John whispered filthily in his ear. He continued his mantra as he licked and bit down the detective’s neck, relishing in the moans but making no attempt to progress any further as he waited.
John quickly hopped from the bed to grab the tube from the drawer before returning to his position between the younger man’s legs. He slicked up his fingers and dragged his index finger from Sherlock’s balls to his tight hole and circled it gently, watching the other man squirm beneath him. “Is this okay?” John asked hesitantly.
“Hey, guys! Come look at this!” Mike called out to the team. The young men gathered around where Mike was pointing to see, fine letters that read ‘I’m gay and hopelessly in love with the rugby captain.’ “We have to find him.” Stamford insisted.
“Nothing. I didn’t mean to say that. I suppose my brain is exhausted,” Sherlock tried to brush it off.
“I know, I’m sorry Sherlock. I shouldn’t have done that. I had no right. Now I’ve ruined your plans for th-” John was cut off by the detective’s lips pressing to his own and he couldn’t bring himself to care about what the end of his sentence was supposed to be. John brough his hands up to tangle in the taller man’s dark curls, an action he had imagined doing countless times but never believed he would be able to make a reality. Sherlock’s hands went to John’s hips and slid up to the small of his back where he used the leverage to pull John closer until they were pressed together and John could feel Sherlock’s still present arousal against his hip.
“W-we should talk,” John gasped, fighting desperately to keep his mind clear enough to think properly.
It took several minutes. Both men were on their backs staring at the ceiling when Sherlock gave in and placed a hand softly on John’s shoulder. It seemed as though the dam broke with that because in an instant John’s face was pressed to the younger man’s chest and violent sobs were released as his body shook violently. Sherlock wrapped his arms around the doctor, one hand going to card fingers gently through John’s hair. Sherlock made no attempt to speak, he just remained a solid presence for the doctor to rely on.
John looked up at his lover, stunned silence filling the air. “Sherlock,” John managed, trying his best to keep his voice even. The other man looked into his eyes and John spoke again, “are you sure? We don’t have to do everything tonight if you don’t want to. I don’t want to pressure you.”
John flinched a little at the threat, it wasn’t like Sherlock to be so hostile. “Sorry, I was trying to be a good person. I’ll just stop then,” John snapped before rising from the desk to gather the materials for the lab and remained silent.
Sherlock felt a pressure in his stomach. He knew what this meant. He wasn't going to get his wish. And he would have to deal with the punishment of his actions. He knew Mycroft wasn’t going to just let this go.
It was stupid really. The wall had all sorts of writing on it, sexual confessions, love notes, dark secrets, no one was likely to even notice the tiny scribble that Sherlock was adding to it. But, that was rather the point wasn’t it? He didn’t actually want anyone to find it, but there was a part of him that needed to tell someone and since he didn’t have friends to gush about it with, the wall would have to do. Sherlock finished his note and capped his marker, sighing as he looked at his own handwriting that now seemed to be taunting him. His secret was out there for the world to see now, but he doubted that anyone would even pay it any mind.
Lestrade burst through the door of the flat to find John sobbing as he was hunched over Sherlock. Just behind him was two men with a stretcher.
John awoke and remembered where he was and gently stroked the rough pad of his thumb over the smooth skin of Sherlock's hand. His face resting on the edge of the bed and his eyes growing heavy. "I'm sorry Sherlock. Please don't leave me." John said quietly.
Sherlock knew he had to do something to ease this feeling, certainly there was something capable of soothing this horrid feeling. Drugs were not an option however, he would never forget the way John looked at him when he found out about his history of usage and though he was attempting to move past the infatuation, the last thing he wanted was an angry and disappointed army doctor in his flat. So Sherlock was down to only one other option, the one he wanted least he was going to have to interact with other people.
Sherlock furrowed his brow, “Of course I’m sure, John.” Sherlock wrapped his legs around the doctor and used the leverage to roll them, pinning John’s arms to on either side of his head. “You are the one thing I have always been sure about. But you should know that if we take this step there is no going back for me. If you aren’t positive that this is what you want I need to know now and I will let you walk out of that door and we can pretend that none of this ever happened. But if you are sure,” Sherlock paused, “You have already consumed my life, John Watson, and I love you.”
John had always enjoyed science, in fact he intended to pursue a medical degree in University, so it came as no surprise that John was always excited to go to biology class on lab days. Except it wasn’t his favorite class because of the academics, but rather the fact whom his lab partner was.
John burst through the door. "Sherlock?" he looked around to find Sherlock on the couch. "Oh god... Sherlock!" He rushed to his side, oh no... He shoved his fingers into the others pulse point feeling for something, anything. There was a heartbeat. It was faint, but it was there. "God Sherlock! Can you hear me? Sherlock!"
The doctor smirked into his lover’s skin. He, John Watson, had reduced the great Sherlock Holmes to a moaning and mess beneath him. “What do you need?” he teased, his breath ghosting over the younger man’s nipple.
When he finally got back there it was 3 in the morning and John was physically and emotionally drained. But he sat next to him and took his hand in his again. God he never wanted to let it go. He placed a gentle kiss on one of his knuckles then rested his head on the side of the bed. Knowing that Sherlock would not be coming to within the next couple hours, John drifted off to sleep for the night.
“Oh, John darling. You never got in touch with me after the other day and you were rushing home that fast that I was worried. So I thought I should come and look if everything is fine. I also found some more photos of Sherlock if you want to-“
Nevertheless, his features showed a sharpness that took his breath away. It was as if he had known everything about John or maybe about everything in general.
“Okay… then I suggest that we wait until the case is closed. Then we’ll know if that was the thing that was holding me here. If I’m still here after it…I would… agree to try the ritual.”
“It’s not funny! Look what I’m wearing! He knows that I detest ties! Detest, John! And the colour! Horrifying!”
“Look, I saw you two together and I understand that you love each other. No one could overlook that, and I won’t try to force you to leave him. I also understand now that not all homosexual men are like I thought.”
When he woke up, the first thing he noticed was that Sherlock was playing his violin..He watched, fascinated, until Sherlock noticed that he was awake and stopped playing. He put the violin gently down, laying the bow beside it, and sat in his chair across from John. He waited expectantly.
Once again, it was unnecessary. No one had ever been surprised before at a man with a white rifle-like thing under his arm.
Meanwhile, John wanted to help him and so reached with his left hand between them to stroke Sherlock’s length painfully slowly.
Now they both saw themselves confronted with the possibility that Sherlock would be gone as soon as the case would be closed.
Sherlock made a desperate sound to that and tried to hold John where he was but he only shook his head.
He stood barely an inch away from him and for a moment John felt paralysed by the intense gaze. Then he hesitantly started doing what he had said.
“Um…there are a few things indeed. I miss my violin. I miss cigarettes. I miss London. I mean I wish I could wander through the city, see everything, feel everything, the pulse of it. I even miss tea … and even if that sounds weird I somehow miss breathing, sniffing, freezing and sweating. I always said that my body is only transport… I mean when I was alive… but even now I would give everything to have this transport. I mean I rarely slept back then…but now I would give everything to just feel exhausted. Wow… all of that sound so unlike me. I would deny it but John really, Sherlock Holmes misses being alive.”
He went back to his room and sat down on his bed. He put his head in his hands. He stayed in this position until it was time to go to work.
“How dare you? You’re such an unthankful, disrespectful child! How can you just bond against my will? How will I explain this to Mr Wilkes?”
This was the moment where the life of Sherlock, the lonely Alpha who would never have a mate, who was weird, who was called a freak or worse truly began.
Omegas were physically way weaker than Alphas and Sherlock got to feel that as he was pressed face forward to the wall.
“Do you remember how I used to tell you that someday you’ll be begging for me to fuck you? If my nose isn’t wrong I would say that this will be the case very soon.”
Then Lestrade took over and they all told what they had found during the investigations and Sherlock interrupted often to tell his opinion.
Sherlock shrugged. “I don’t really know, without a lab. I think he put the hairs in liquid nitrogen and then crumbled them up and put them in her drinks. I can’t examine the drink or the bar equipment here, so the others will have to analyse the utensils and liquid to see if it matches pandas. It might not have been deliberate - the reaction to something ingested will be a lot more significant than just being around the same allergens in the air.”
“It’s just, I thought I would never meet him again and now…Sherlock… I’m really sorry about what happened to you.”
At this, Sherlock squinted his eyes and grabbed John’s shoulders hard while taking deep breaths in an attempt to relax.
John thought for a moment about that. “You said that she was working at the zoo…and that she recently broke up with her long-term boyfriend.”
She took his hand and pulled him into another room, where they were alone. As soon as she let go of his hand, John was desperate to know what his sister was so keen to tell him..
“What are you talking about? There are no such things as normal colours. That’s completely illogical.”
Sherlock was suddenly like under a spell and his laughter died. While John was doing his handstand, his jumper and undershirt were sliding so there was just John’s bare belly. Sherlock was grateful that John had pinched his eyes together in utter concentration so he couldn’t see him staring at him. It was muscular but not too much. There was no six-pack or something like that but it was obvious that John was fit. Sherlock had to swallow hard and tear his gaze away until John was back at his chair.
Now John definitely did choke on his tea. He was coughing wildly while Sherlock began to drink the rest of his cup greedily.
“You are the only one who could seriously let a crime scene appear like a romantic scene from a movie.”
Wonderful, completely perfect John-he still couldn’t believe it and now he even had gotten his first kiss from him.
He flushed the water again and looked down at the body he had had to destroy to make this graceless world Grace-less.
He shook his head and focused on Sherlock who still sat in his chair. He looked annoyed and frowned at John who cleared his throat.
“Oh, come on, Sherlock. I basically pressured you to do this. You didn’t want this when I asked you to bond with me the first time. You only agreed because I blackmailed you.”
This had been his thinking until they had all presented and wow he would never forget how different they had acted.
He knew that John was a romantic. But to be honest he had never even considered that he would be that determined.
He was staring at nothing, his left hand curled into a fist while his other one was clutching at a card - an invitation? A cup of untouched tea stood right before him. It looked to be stone cold.
Evolution had made the mankind weaker and weaker, burying their instincts under layers of rational explications. Unlike animals. That was a challenge worth accepting – fighting with animals. Against them and for them at the same time, trying to re-learn from them the essence of being alive.
As soon as John was brought to Scotland Yard to give his statement he was surrounded by the smell of a really upset Sherlock.
She had seen his dead body; she had spoken at his funeral. She met the unusual coloured eyes and then she heard his distinctive voice.
It was half empty – just a handful of wet tissues and the silhouette of a brownish tampon were resting on the bright green surface of the sack covering the bottom of the bin. Oh, there was also a strange collection of coloured leaves, somehow. And slices of nails all over them.
John had known that he was bisexual since he was a teenager. Because of his family, he had never acted upon those urges until he met Sherlock.
He lunged at the Omega and Sherlock knew immediately what a stupid move it had been to punch an Alpha when he was alone.
He put his arms under his armpits and pulled him out of his coffin and grave while walking backwards.
He made it clear on the day they met that he wasn’t interested in bonding or in relationships in general and so John had accepted that it was a lost cause.
“I think you should know that I had also a few boyfriends in my life. I mean it was nothing serious. But none of my previous relationships were. I mean I never loved someone. Not really. I mean…okay… that’s it… I think. Good night.”
He climbed wordlessly into the bed and soon the only sound to be heard was the even breathing of him.
“No, I was just against it because I was afraid that you would change your opinion and then would be stuck with me and would end up hating me. And I… just couldn’t stand that idea of you … looking at me like everyone else always did.”
John climbed into bed, pondering the problem. The question with Sherlock had moved from one of if to one of how and when. John was, and had been for some time, comfortable with the confirmed bachelor flatmate status they enjoyed, the solving cases, the pseudo-domestic arrangement. And, at least given his reaction to the unexpected snogging, it seemed sex certainly wasn’t going to be a problem.
Sherlock processes this for a second and then turns again, forcing himself to walk away in what he hopes is an even pace.
Sherlock darted through the streets of London, moving quickly, circuitously, blood pumping and mind whirling. Watching his movements, no one could possibly derive his goal with any level of certainty. He’d already disposed handily of the two men on foot, one woman on a bicycle, and the black town car which appeared to have been shadowing him. At least one of the men on foot had been a bobby, probably one of Lestrade’s men. The car and the bicyclist had certainly been his brother’s. As for the other man, he suspected Moriarty, although that was probably not subtle enough for his taste. In the end it didn’t matter who was following him and why, provided he could get rid of them.
Sherlock brought a hand to each of John’s hips, holding them down to the bed as he continued teasing the doctor through the soft cotton. When Sherlock decided that the man below him was thoroughly debauched he eased his grip on the man’s hips and slid his thin fingers under the band of the red pants in front of him, swiftly pulling them down to join John’s trousers on the floor. Now able to see all of the man in front of him, Sherlock took a moment to appreciate the view, John’s hair was a wild mess on top of his head and sweat beaded at his face that was flush with arousal, the heavy rise and fall of his muscular chest as he breathed rapidly, the soft yet defined lines of muscle tone down his abdomen and his legs, and Sherlock’s eyes finally came to rest on the doctor’s hard cock that rested against his stomach and was already dripping precome from the tip.
“Hey, John,” a student came to stand near him as he spoke, John thought his name was Jeff, but honestly he wasn’t sure. “Did you make these?” The boy handed John a flier that had a large image of what appeared to be the confession wall, but it was the writing in the photograph that caught John’s attention. Underneath the photograph someone had typed ‘If this is you or you know who this is, please contact Mike Stamford. Information will be rewarded.’
“John,” Sherlock gasped at the suddenness. He took in his new position, his hands were once again pinned to either side of his head and John had his knees anchored on either side of Sherlock’s slim hips with his strong calves hooked over the lean muscles of his thighs. Sherlock was effectively trapped and he was loving it. John looked down at his lover, eyes displaying the most maddening combination of arousal and needed that Sherlock thought he had ever seen in his life.
John reached up and untied his lover’s wrists, moaning when the hands went directly to his back and nails dragged firmly down his back. John pulled out torturously slow before snapping his hips back with an obscenely loud noise at his hips made contact with Sherlock’s arse.
John’s already flushed cheeks turned a shade darker as he mumbled his reply into his friend’s shoulder.
Sherlock dipped quickly out into the hallway and John heard another voice that confirmed his hypothesis and took a deep breath, closing his eyes to calm the intense jealousy within him. He had no right to be jealous, Sherlock had made himself quite clear multiple times that he had no interest in John. And what had John done in response? Kiss him. Good one, Watson. Now he’s out there shooing away someone he actually likes so he can come in here and deal with the problem you’ve created.
“John, I’m going to help you bathe, is that okay?” Sherlock placed his hand on John’s cheek to move his head up so he could look into the vacant blue eyes of his best friend. John simply nodded and returned his eyes back to his downward glance.
“Thank you,” John breathed. He couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes, knowing that the bottom of the shower would be tinged pink from his wife's blood running off of his body. So instead John focused on what he feel, hear, and smell around him, a tactic he’d learned in the military to help him out of these moments where he felt disconnected from reality.  Sherlock’s thin fingers were stroking through his hair, the soap suds trickling lightly down the side of his face, the smooth material of Sherlock’s wet button down against his back, the soft smell of the shampoo, the sound and feeling water hitting his body. Slowly John was coming back to himself as Sherlock began washing his body, but he remained still and silent.
“God, Sherlock, you’re beautiful,” John whispered, his voice softening slightly. “I love to see you all marked up,” John ran his hand down his lover’s neck, pushing slightly on the bruises as he passed them. “Love to see the proof that you’re mine,” his voice became dangerous again and John adjusted his legs so he was now situated between the detective’s and pulled the godforsaken tight trousers and pants off of the man’s slim frame in one swift pull.
Again, without a reply from Sherlock the pit of his stomach twisted. It was taking far too long for him to haul a cab. As minutes ticked by and he became more and more anxious. "Oh Hell." he said finally breaking into a full on sprint towards the flat. If he kept at this pace it would take him somewhere around 15 minutes to get there. He knew something was wrong. He had to get to Sherlock.
John nodded and laid his head back on the pillow, lifting his hips when Sherlock prompted him so the younger man could slid his trousers from his body. The detective slowly licked at the outline of John’s cock through his pants, mouthing at the width of him straining against the cotton fabric. “God, Sherlock,” John moaned beneath him, rutting his hips up gently.
“I’m so sorry, John,” Sherlock sobbed, looking down at the doctor who was holding his now dead wife in his arms.
John rested his elbows on his knees gripping his phone in both of his hands tapping his thumbs on the screen waiting for a reply. But after 15 minutes without one he stood up. "Mary I'm going to check on Sherlock, I don't know when I'll be home, don't wait up." He called pulling on his coat before sending another text reading. "I'm on my way over -JW"
John took one more second to ensure the detective really was ready, not letting his lust fully cloud his judgement, before pulling out and slicking his cock and placing it against Sherlock’s sensitive arse. “Say please,” John smirked down at his lover.
“John, I need...,” Sherlock moaned. He didn’t even know what it was he was asking for, he just knew that he needed something, anything.
After they were as sufficiently cleaned as one could be without a shower, John returned to lay beside his lover and took a moment to appreciate the number he had done on Sherlock’s neck. “You are definitely aren’t going to be able to cover these,” John said, suddenly a little bit concerned. “I guess I got a little bit carried away. I’m sorry.”
In this position Sherlock was suddenly aware of John’s arousal pushing into his inner thigh. He smiled into the kiss and lowered his hips until his arse was pressed fully to John’s lap and ground his hips down experimentally, relishing the deep moan that fell from the other man’s lips. John threw his head back and Sherlock took the opportunity to attach his lips to the base his lover’s neck. He slowly bit, licked, and kissed his way up to John’s jaw before working his way back down, pausing occasionally to suck a dark purple bruise into the soft flesh.
John opened his eyes and looked at the beautiful man in front of him, “Of course, Sherlock. Nothing would make me happier.” John connected their lips once again. The kiss was slow, passionate but not sexual. It was the kiss of men who were finally at peace.
John had calmed down enough to take the initiative to grab Sherlock's hand and keep it firmly in his. He had to be quiet though. He knew ambulance protocol. He was a bloody doctor after all.
John’s face turned bright red and Sherlock let out a loud laugh of relief, “That was rather the point.” Sherlock reattached his lips to John’s neck and ground his hips down once again, dedicating the sound that fell from John’s lips to his memory.
The next day as John was arriving at school he received a text message from Mike Stamford. The rugby captain looked at it for several moments trying to understand what he meant. ‘You’re Welcome’ was all that it said. John quickly tapped out a response before grabbing his bag and heading into the school.
“Do you want to get out of here?” The other man, Sherlock had truly not paid any attention to his name, asked.
Sherlock was slowly starting to come to. He was so disappointed. He was positive now that he was not going to get his escape from the pain. He had nothing in this world to live for. Not without John. He still could not feel his limbs and it was still quiet but that could just be the hospital. God he didn't want this. He didn't want to feel like he would be able to open his eyes soon. He never wanted to do that again.
Sherlock hid his face in John’s neck to hide the blush that that was so present it was travelling down his neck, “Maybe.”
John Watson on the other hand had never been one to hesitate in the realm of romance or sexuality. This of course changed entirely when he fell in love with Sherlock Holmes. But could one really blame him? Sherlock had told him up front that he considered himself “married to his work” and denied advances that he hadn’t even been making at the time. The reason John normally had such a sense of self-confidence was because he had rarely ever been turned down, his charming yet domineering Captain John Watson persona had never failed him before, but how was he supposed to confidently pursue a man who had made it quite clear that he was not interested?
As he sat there squeezing Sherlock's hand he thought about how stupid he was. How dumb he had been, especially after Sherlock came back, to get so invested with someone else. God he actually loved this man in front of him. More than he could ever love his wife. This man had saved him, make his life loads better from the first minute. Now he was so stupid as to leave him alone and let him do this to himself. God was he stupid.
John’s heart sank, clearly Sherlock didn’t feel the same. He had made a fool of himself. He knew he should have kept it to himself, “It’s okay that you don’t feel the same, Sherlock. I just wanted to tell you. I-uh, I need to go to practice.”
John waited in the lobby. Lestrade had been sitting with him for a bit, but he had to get home to his wife as it was getting late.
John couldn’t bring himself to care about how ridiculous it was that he wanted to have Sherlock as his and only his even though they had only just kissed minutes prior. “Mine,” he practically growled as he captured Sherlock’s with his own and bit down roughly on his bottom lip.
“Fine,” Sherlock looked up at him this time and John saw why Sherlock had been unwilling to turn his head previously. It looked as though the boy had been crying.
They arrived at the hospital and Sherlock was wheeled into the ER as fast as the men and women's feet would take them. John however wasn't allowed to follow.
The beeping heart monitor proved Sherlock could hear him. John chuckled. "You're going to be alright. Don't strain yourself." John yawned and tangled his fingers in Sherlock's. "I'm sorry, I'm so stupid."
John rolled his eyes at the snarky comment but really couldn’t bring himself to care that much. The view he was enjoying now was better than anything he had ever seen. He trailed his strong hands up Sherlock’s smooth legs and to his hips, gripping them tightly and guiding him as he lifted and lowered his hips. “You’re beautiful like this, Sherlock,” John breathed.
“Sherlock,” John starts again with difficulty. “When you were… at your low point. When I thought I would lose you. I did something unforgivable. At least, I’ve not been able to forgive myself for it. I went to a place I didn’t know I could go, and I almost went too far to come back. I’m afraid… afraid it might happen again. I might hurt you again. I can’t risk it.”
“Everything!” John exclaims, frustrated. “Everything when it means that you’ve stopped acting like there
“All right, don’t start that again,” John orders in his most medical tone. “That’s how you ended up here in the first place. You’ll have to excuse my partner, he’s just very eager to hear what you have to say. Okay?”
John doesn’t know what he’ll do if it gets any worse – Sherlock isn’t going to rest until he finds this man or it kills him, and John is afraid the latter isn’t at all unlikely the way he’s going. And he’s getting more and more unreachable.
John dribbles some of the warmed oil between Sherlock's shoulder blades. He leans down and whispers in Sherlock's ear. "We're going to test your senses. You have to tell me exactly what I'm doing as I do it."
His hook connects with jawbone, but in doing so John loosens his grip on the ID card just enough for his opponent to tear it out of his hands. The man spits blood at him and turns on a dime, fleeing down the hall toward the centre of the vast complex. John is instantly in hot pursuit – the little devil is fast, but John is no stranger to impromptu foot chases and the slipperiness of the recently buffed floors level the playing field a bit more. Still the man is a good twenty feet beyond John when he crashes to a halt in front of an unmarked door and waves the ID before the pad beside it.
The day plays out very much as the one after he lost his sight, although managing to be both more incomprehensible and even more dull. John takes him to hospital, he has another scan, they wait for results, they find nothing wrong with his auditory centre, they find nothing wrong with his ears, they take more blood, they run more tests. And Sherlock tries not to scream with anger and frustration and hate at everything around him. It wouldn’t be satisfying anyway. He couldn’t hear it.
There are gaps in his knowledge, Sherlock realises. And they're getting bigger. But before he has a chance to let that thought sink in and truly unnerve him, John leaps out of his stool, landing in a half crouch facing the door and brandishing the stool as a defensive weapon.
She grins at his inspection of the room. "Ghastly, isn't it? I suppose this is what event decorators think women like. Still, better than trying to drive here in a wedding dress."
“I told you,” Sherlock mumbles, “nothing is going to happen until at least February. Well, I say nothing… We needn’t concern ourselves at present.”
“Don’t tell me what you think I want to hear, you’re rubbish at it. And don’t give me some repentant bullshit. I’ve seen you cry on cue too many times for your emotionally manipulative act to work. The truth. It wasn’t just for me, was it?”
But it still goes too fast, and in hindsight is tainted by Moriarty’s tentacles infiltrating their lives, almost unnoticed at first.
