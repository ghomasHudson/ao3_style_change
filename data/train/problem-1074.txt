"Also," Lestrade looked to John. "Your broom on fire at the first Quidditch match, still nothing?"
Sherlock detached himself from Anderson's grip and put down his hood, smoothing out his face to a normal expression.
"Well by those standards, I shouldn't have called myself that either." He felt his mouth turning into a grin, trying to keep the laughter out of his voice.
Sherlock sighed. "Yeah I was still hurt. My back and some ribs weren't in great shape." He shook his head. "I know by now how to take care of myself by now though."
"I bet that was terrifying, Christ," Mary laughed, without much humor and Sherlock found a smile spreading onto his face.
Sherlock grunted in pain before he could stop himself, but hugged Lestrade back tightly, hoping the man hadn't heard.
Three weeks later he was hugging goodbye to Mrs Hudson, making sure sigerson was firmly locked in his crate, and boarding the Hogwarts express.
John's broom was on fire. Worse yet, on fire and seemingly out of his control. Sherlock's heart pounded madly as he watched Madam Hooch try to aim water at the broom, but it sped off, John barely holding on as it twisted through the air. In a heartbeat, Sherlock had laid flat on his stomach, urging his broom forward, as everyone around him froze, watching in horror.
"And what were you? Leather jacket bad boy?" John grinned at the thought.
Sherlock gave him a glare, not breaking eye contact until Mycroft did.
Lestrade held Sherlock's gaze for several moments before nodding. "Fine. I'll probably be asked to work this one. Wish there was someway I can prove he was blackmailing."
Sherlock finally met John's steely eyes. "No lies this time. Promise."
She looked at him for a moment, before helping him up. "You really know how to make an appearance."
Sherlock thought for a moment. Then smiled. "We might not have to...."
"Screw it," Molly said, sitting behind him. "Sherlock, you have to look into our Defense Against the Dark Arts professor."
John tried to remember what he'd been dreaming about. "What's going on?" He dug around for a clean shirt, reminding himself to get laundry done soon."
Sherlock nodded. "Saved me some time, although I was hoping to test a new corrosive on it." He looked from Fischer to Will. "I would also advise you to stop asking her about marrying your son, Mr Fischer. Miss Adler's roommate turned out to be her girlfriend."
"Do you mean Greg?" John asked. There was no way.
"At least you and Bell treat him well," Mrs Hudson said softly. "If anything happened to my boy, I'd have to hunt whoever was responsible down. And you'd look the other way, Lestrade."
Sherlock nodded. "Although if sticking my neck out with you allows you to get hurt on a continuing basis, I'm going to have an issue."
"Kidnapped," John said, keeping his voice light. "What can you do, eh, Lestrade?" He saw Sherlock smirk out of the corner of his eye.
"Second great war?" Sherlock looked over to John, who'd paused, wand at his side.
He and John jumped as a steady hand came down on one of each of their shoulders.
"I'm wondering what exactly the photo has in it," Sherlock said firmly. "Three friends who for all intents and purposes seem like good uni-age kids involved with it, and yet Fischer senior says it would tarnish Will's reputation. And Irene at least thought it might hold her friends back."
Mycroft rolled his eyes. "If I believed that, why would I have to check in on him so often?" John looked away. "My brother," Mycroft said in a softer voice, "Could be a scientist, a brilliant chemist, or a philosopher. With that brain of his. But he's a detective, running around solving problems; goes to America with an acting group, ends up saving your landlady from her abusive husband." John blinked, unaware that Mycroft was privy to that knowledge. But he assumed it was in some file somewhere. "Makes friends with the best, least corrupt detective on the force." Mycroft shook his head. "He wanted to be a pirate as a child, but a pirate in the early 1800s, swooping in on various ships and liberating slaves from their captivity."
'Sir, we have your brother's orders to. This isn't your choice.' The woman up front was still going by Anthea, even though Sherlock didn't know her real name. 'Unless you are going to either John Watson's or that inspector's. Then I'm fairly certain he would only lose his mind slightly.'
(See the end of the chapter for
"Some idiot at the Prophet up to no good." Anderson snorted.
John nodded.
"Go on back to your compartment. Everything is fine." He attempted a smile to look more convincing. She nodded and headed out, leaving him to sit and let out a shaky breath, turning to the window to wonder if everything would be okay.
Two weeks later he stood in the hills across from Mycroft, running with his wand out, flashes of lights sparking through the air, his brother turning equally quick to shoot light at him.
"Should try to time a meeting at the Ministry with milverton or smallwood at the same time. Without telling him or Lestrade, obviously."
"Yeah. She wants to do math or something at uni, if she ends up going. She also wants to travel the world." John shook his head.
Sherlock laughed. "Well you were the one who ran out of the flat to take a walk and consider my biology."
"Sherlock!" John called, sounding further away than Sherlock knew him to be. He breathed in and out, too quickly, trying to focus on the scent of the smog, the gasoline puddle left from a car a few feet from where he knelt. London night--
"I know, I'm sorry..." He looked up at Mr Watson. "Is he home, by any chance? Was kinda hoping to...tell him myself ..."
Mr Watson blinked again and then smiled slightly. "No..no, sorry, he went with someone to Diagon Alley to pick up their books for next term." He shook his head. "Sorry...shock. Do you want a ride down there?"
As always, thanks for reading. Leave some comments, or kudos if you're enjoying so far.
He found a compartment to himself and sat alone.
Sherlock walked in and stood by the window, John not far from beside him.
John blinked. "Leads?"
"I did," John said proudly. "Paid a first-year 10 sickles to knock her hat off on the stairs. I was gracious enough to pick it up for her."
'Have you seen John yet?' Mrs Hudson asked gently as they broke apart. Sherlock shook his head.
"And you should to explain yourselves," Sherlock said seriously.
"Oh, that's new," Bell said, grinning at Sherlock.
"Shut up." John's eyes met Sherlock and Sherlock felt very small suddenly. His convictions over keeping people safe from Moriarty's empire, from the plan that he and Mycroft devised, turned to water under the scope of the anger and pain that was behind John's eyes.
Irene hesitated. "I destroy the photos under the condition that you guarantee my safety." Nell looked like she was about to protest. "It's the only thing we can do at this point."
Sherlock looked to the girl, she had only sympathy in her eyes, and back to John. He shut down.
But he found himself looking up every so often to watch John's brow furrow in concentration, his friend poking his tongue out between his teeth as he worked something out. And Sherlock wasn't sure how firm his resolve was in anything, besides the fact that he might only be able to pine silently until he was more sure of John's feelings.
"And right now. I miss you. I've missed you all summer. Every step I ran, every breath that I took in a panic, everything that happened, during all of it I just hoped I'd be able to make it back here." Sherlock met John's eyes. "You are my friend, John, my best friend. And I owe you a thousand apologies, but I'm starting with this one: I'm sorry." He inhaled deeply and stuck out a hand for John to shake.
"Whoever killed Milverton is safely in hiding, and will probably stay that way," Sherlock muttered. "They intend to keep themselves safe. What they did will keep others safe." Sherlock looked at Dumbledore. "I supposed you heard that that threat of Mycroft's was caught the same night?"
"He took a long walk and then came back and we talked it out," Sherlock admitted. Somehow it felt more realistic to leave out the part where he'd sat with John's gun, pondering suicide if his friend hadn't accepted him. John was still the best man he knew.
"I was supposed to meet him for a make up meeting and I heard someone shouting the spell for the Imperious Curse." Molly looked fearful and Sherlock swallowed. "I knocked and he came to the door a few seconds later; he seemed normal, but I could've sword I heard him shouting before."
Sherlock nodded mutely and John swallowed heavily. "Rather that then them trying to hurt you directly," John said softly to Sherlock.
Molly nodded. "They didn't find anything, told me I must have been hearing things." She looked at Sherlock. "I wasn't. But I don't want to go snooping around in his office or ask him anything funny. He might complain and I'd be in trouble for accusing a teacher of something, twice."
"Sherlock," Molly laughed. "Snape's tough but I'm actually quite good at it. Talk to John."
"I think he made it clear enough that he doesn't want to be around me for a while."
He waited a couple seconds.
"He knows some important things, but not a lot, John." Mrs Hudson smiled. "Sherlock and I are very different; he's very private."
John laughed, embarrassed.
"Alright. Bed then, both of you. Tell me about Milverton in the morning."
"I need you to keep an eye on someone for me." Sherlock slowly told her what he wanted. He had thought about this for a long while; the last time he'd asked someone to spy in depth was Carl Powers, who'd been killed because of it. Sherlock had taken his time researching how he could best deal with Mycroft's case of threats against the Ministry (and, Sherlock suspected, Hogwarts) without getting so directly involved that he would have to leave school. There were other matters on his mind. Namely a certain chaos that still had whispers around every corner, and of a few clippings back from the days of Moriarty that had yet to name a mastermind. As much as Sherlock had wanted to blame the two murders with blackmail ties on his old arch-enemy, there was something nagging him to look into it further.
"Do you know what he's done? He always does this, he thinks it's some kind of game, ruining people's lives, hurting them, playing with danger-"
Sherlock sighed, looking up to the front steps, and then walked forward, pulling out his keys and walking to the door, he looked back at Lestrade, before unlocking it and pulling it open, he'd barely stepped inside before he heard a scream of fright and something heavy and metal collided with his face and he blacked out.
"Or what?"
"What?" Sherlock asked. Lestrade frowned.
"It isn't hurting him," Nell said softly.
Sherlock was silent in the cab ride, staring out the window moodily, his face still serious. John wondered about him, thinking back to a couple incidents previous. Mrs Hudson thinking they needed two bedrooms, Angelo assuming he was Sherlock's boyfriend... Sherlock insisting women weren't his area.
"Damn right," Lestrade said again, his voice thick with empathy. "First time someone tried to kill me, I couldn't sleep for a few days. And that was when I was 20. Can't imagine how this has been on you." He looked up at John and Sherlock. "I'm gonna take you both back to mine, and get ahold of Mrs H to say that you'll be staying the night. You both go home in this state and she'll be beside herself with worry."
And he believed her. "I'm transgender. It's not relevant, but I've never told a friend by choice before. So. There we are."
"Spending break with Sally?" John asked. Anderson nodded.
Lestrade and Sherlock started keeping in more frequent contact, the two bouncing ideas off one another as to how to best find Moriarty. But Sherlock's website remained without any activity or comments, and Lestrade was running out of resources to use to find the man. At the end of the second week, it seemed they would both resume their intensity if anything interesting came up. Lestrade asked them both to go for a pint sometime in the next week; John agreed, Sherlock was hesitant.
John looked at him, disbelievingly. "No, it wouldn't."
Sherlock made a small noise in his throat and watched her walk away.
"Not that you would," Lestrade said. "Not that you're together--"
Mr Watson frowned. "Magic," he sighed, after a beat, shaking his head. Smiling faintly, he let Sherlock pass him.
Back to Sherlock, seeing blood running freely from under the curls. "You're bleeding." Somehow it seemed enough to say that.
"Fischer and Son," Sherlock said. Fischer senior shot a look back at Sherlock.
"And now you're admitting defeat in two matches." Sherlock grinned. Mycroft sighed.
"We would've never wanted to hurt him," Nell said.
"You, for instance?" Sherlock said lightly, his piercing eyes meeting Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's look grew deadly serious.
"Potions," John groaned.
Is the burn slow enough for everyone?
" 'I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit,' ” Sherlock laughed. "Fitting for both parties, maybe."
"You didn't tell me," Mrs Hudson said, looking from Sherlock to John.
No more separating these two in this series.
"Not get kidnapped, probably," Lestrade said, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Alright, give me what you got." He looked at Sherlock, pen and paper at the ready.
"So you are here because of Mr Fischer," a dismayed voice came from the doorway. John and Sherlock both turned to see a young woman, taller and thinner than Nell, with dark hair and startling brown eyes.
"Well, then, if you'll just let us go--" Sherlock started. Lestrade's grip grew slightly firmer.
Sherlock nodded gratefully and flicked some of the powder at the fireplace before stepping in the green flames and saying clearly "Diagon Alley!"
"This does mean a lot, thank you, Will." Sherlock held up the photo. "I hope you two end up very happy together, and I wish you both the best." He smiled. "If he gets into criminal law and ever needs someone like me, well, you know how to contact me."
'Soon, ill probably have to,' he said softly. 'How is he?'
Sherlock opened his mouth and closed it. He looked at John. "John, I have no idea how-"
But if Lestrade was bothered by the image, he didn't show it because a second later the sounds of walking had resumed and Sherlock heard the sounds of a cupboard opening in the small kitchen.
"Can't believe you're back, honestly," Anderson said, laughing as Sherlock walked to the door. He stopped as he heard Sally's steps stop behind him, and turned to face her, no one else in sight.
"I was just about to wake you," she said to him, smiling. "We've both got presents under the tree in my flat; I'll summon them up here after breakfast."
"I told you, it would be easier to do this if I wasn't in school. As it is, nothing is out of place."
"We need to get into Snape's office, somehow, during class. It's the only time it'll be unlocked and he won't be in."
"Sorry! Sorry!" Nell rushed into the kitchen and John followed, seeing black smoke pour out of the oven as Nell opened it. "It's my brother's birthday, I was baking for him when he comes over later. Totally forgot."
He opened his eyes burrily sometime later, to Lestrade and Mrs Hudson peering over him. Lestrade burst out laughing.
"'If Sherlock Holmes lives, John Watson lives'. You sap."
"Mycroft was here," Sherlock said, sitting down opposite John. "You never look that bothered unless you've spoken to him."
"Why were you watching what I was doing instead of getting me into trouble?" Sherlock said, glaring at Snape.
"you as well. I think I can expect great things from you both." Dumbledore smiled and the two of them left his office.
Will grinned. "For sure. Thank you, Mr Holmes, Mr Watson."
Snape looked at Sherlock, thick brows furrowed. "You know perfectly well why that was an exception."
"So he could cause a lot of trouble," John muttered.
"What time is it?" John muttered, turning and reaching for his phone. 9am.
"That he is so close to me should remain something under wraps. If the ministry were to go foul one day, he is someone I can rely on. Having known friends inside the ministry can be dangerous."
"It's crowded as hell in here, thanks," Anderson muttered, still red, as John moved to sit beside Sherlock so Anderson and Sally could have the other side of the table.
"If I heard anything of note, I will of course let you know. I would assume you have been thinking the same in that it's someone trying to get to you, Sherlock, by hurting Mr Watson?"
(See the end of the chapter for
I've gone back and forth on a lot of ideas for this stuff, and finally just sat down and typed one up, so hopefully this plot doesn't get too stupid.
"I'm not bothered." Sherlock raised an eyebrow and John laughed. "He had some information for us, but it can wait. Mrs Hudson wants us over for dinner, and then we've got those photos to sort, right?"
"Holmes!"
"Gonna pay Mrs H extra to replace those windows." John shook his head as they exited the car.
(See the end of the chapter for
He frowned at her. "Aren't you gonna go after him?"
John sighed. "Great. Supposed I couldn't avoid his texts forever."
"I'll stay in," Mrs. Hudson called. "Too cold, though the snow does look nice tonight."
Sherlock looked up, thinking. "Maybe he wants to ask about the Quidditch match. Or..."
"Get that look off your face," Lestrade muttered, looking at Sherlock. "Don't think for a second that we don't know that you wouldn't have done what you did without some kind of good reason behind it." He sighed very softly. "Listen, I've got a mound of paperwork back at the office to work on so im gonna head off for now. Let me know if you need anything, alright?" He smiled. "Just glad to have you back. Be careful," he said meaningfully. "Mrs Hudson dont let him get into too much trouble."
Long time no see.
Fischer cut his son off, "But as long as she has that photo and is prepared to use it as blackmail, I fear my son is not safe. We want the photo back. And any existance of it wiped from whatever hard drive it's on."
John sighed. "You want us to look into it?"
"So, Moriarty has police ties?" Sherlock asked, bringing up yet again their breakfast conversation. John nodded.
Sherlock looked at the group, feeling like he did finally have a family, and that this was the best birthday he'd had in years.
"Talk to him," Molly said. She was pulling out homework.
"You need a Snape hair," John pointed out.
"Good night."
Mrs. Hudson "tsked" and Lestrade laughed a little. "Some idiot let him grab his wand and I didn't react quickly enough." Lestrade looked to Sherlock. "Still in one piece, though."
"Hopefully not, Mr Holmes. Keep up the good work, you two."
Sherlock shrugged. "We were asked to look into it by Dumbledore. As everyone keeps telling us that the terrorist stuff at the Ministry is dangerous, John and I thought it best to check which date would bring you and the aurors to the Ministry so we don't end up crossing paths." Sherlock shook off the guilt at blatantly lying to Lestrade after the man had just said all that.
As they started down the hall to exit the hotel, Will Fischer caught up with them.
"Lestrade." Sherlock rolled his eyes. Lestrade smiled.
"Supposedly not Lestrade, though."
"It's a very long story, Mrs Watson," he said tiredly, and smiled a little.
He shook his head, pulling his textbook closer to him. These were all hypotheticals. At the moment, he had school to focus on. And two cases now, both of which he placed importance above that of romantic entanglement. The work was what mattered, and if he wanted to do more of it after Hogwarts, he had to keep doing well now.
Sherlock smiled more as he heard a forced cough (John would probably believe it was genuine) as Lestrade entered the room, purposefully looking at a piece of parchment. He looked up at them.
"If it was just me," Smallwood growled, "we wouldn't be here. But how many people, good people, did you decide to dig through the dirt to find out the worst about? And then to threaten them."
John stood and pulled Sherlock into a tight hug. "Alright. Alright."
He heard John's intake of breath, listening closely for any signs of emotional pain.
Snape nodded dismissively and Sherlock hurried out.
More to come :)
William's voice finally broke and he sounded teary as he ducked his head down. "I'm doing medicine, but... my father, he's so homophobic, he doesn't know. I've never come out to him, any mention of that stuff and he just..." William looked up, his eyes red and wet. "Irene and I were supposed to be friends, I can't believe she would ever-!"
Sherlock shrugged. "Honestly, it's okay."
"Listen I should tell you, if you're gonna come out to me, Mrs Hudson already let it slip that you're gay," she looked more nervous than he felt, and he let out a laugh.
"That's exactly what might be in danger of getting leaked," Dumbledore said solemnly. "Not only that, but we have been informed that this man wants to target other prominent members of the magical community as well."
Sherlock smiled reassuringly. "Email me details as to how to contact you further. And where you will be staying. I hope this won't take long to work out."
A+ time wise that The Seeker was released in the 70s and this series is set in the 80s. Thanks, the Who.
Sherlock and John sat on the small couch and John looked to Sherlock. "They couldn't steal a laptop or whatever from here?" he said under his breath.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flash of green, then red light heading toward them and his breath caught in his throat. John was leaping out of the way, shouting in shock, and Sherlock stood rooted to the ground, the London street disappearing into trees of the forest he rushed through after his escape over the summer. His breath caught in a panic as Lestrade leapt on top of him, forcing him to the ground, the red jet clipping Lestrade's left arm. Pinned by the older man, Sherlock felt a soft shout tear from his lips and he thrashed away from Lestrade, as the man stood, left arm hanging limp at his side.
"I should have said... it was a really rough summer." His voice caught and he closed his eyes, focusing on the warmth that the tea was giving him.
Will smiled weakly.
Sherlock shrugged. "Mayybe. Then again, no one does guess it."
"Er-" Sherlock saw John flash a look of concern at him. "Yeah. It was bad for a couple of weeks but Mycroft's healer did good work when I got back."
"Want me to take you?" Sherlock shook his head and she sighed. "Okay, don't be back too late if you can help it. I'll try to get dinner ready around six, so be back then if you want some."
"What?" Sherlock looked to John, who smiled.
He spared her another look. "Not exactly."
Irene frowned. "I took the pictures of him and Godfrey. He's always been a little shy and Godfrey and I respected that. But he also said he wanted me to be safe from his father."
Sherlock looked over at John. "Over the summer, I went out to take down much of Moriarty's empire. And investigate some other things." He watched as John's brow creased. "He might be asking about that."
"Definitely not you, Lestrade," John said. "How've you been--?"
"And he's probably got his office charmed so students don't sneak in at night," Molly said. "I heard another student talking about it; someone tried to sneak into Flitwick's office once to fix a paper. All the professors have charms on their doors now."
John flicked to a text and sent, "Swimming lessons went fine, sherlock bumped his head," to Mycroft. He then pocketed his phone, prepared to ignore any calls for the next twenty-four hours, determined "not to see" any mysterious black cars if any were to pull up next to him.
"Are you planning on stealing it?" John paused. "She seemed like she's not a bad person; I doubt Mr Fischer has anything to worry about." Sherlock hummed.
He had little time to register the Watsons' faces before he was whisked away.
".... and then the poor woman didn't know I worked with the bloody police department and excused herself to the bathroom! I then get a call from a co-worker and sure enough there is a missing convict. I quickly followed her into the bathroom to see half her body outside the window!" Greg finished with a loud laugh, tears streaming down his face.
John smirked. "Of course. He makes it easy considering he never sleeps and when he does I have to make him."
Greg froze as he slowly looked at Mycroft. "But you have looked at me like that before and I always thought you were just pissed at me because Sherlock constantly is and calls me a 'muppet' if I say something stupid."
John frowned and felt a stab of suspicion as he stared at the back of Sherlock's coat. "Intoxication, huh?"
Joan smiles sadly. "And here I thought you would love to be part of this."
Mycroft carefully pulled out a voice recorder that had recorded Sherlock's entire speech. Sherlock slowly took it and nodded at Mycroft, a silent thank you. Mycroft nodded back and left 221B.
To say that Greg was having an off day would be an understatement. "Um, I love you too?" Greg joked.
There was silence except for the comforting squeeze from John's hand. Joan, on the other hand, had been silent before breaking out into laughter causing the rest of the women to do the same.
Susan turned around and smiled. "John! Hello! How are you?"
Mycroft nodded in understanding. "Well if I found out my fake husband killed a woman for my life I would be just as pissed.... just kidding I would love that, it would mean he is as crazy as me."
"Um does a John Watson live here however?"
"Oh hello boys! Wonderful to see both of you." She said.
"Alright everyone! You're free to go as it is 8! And remember, check your purse when you get home and have a hopefully safe night!"
John looked at him with a look of confusion, admiration, and a tad of annoyance. Susan didn't seem bothered and instead took Rosie out of her arms.
Sherlock couldn't move when she sad that because he was feeling something he shouldn't ever feel; guilt. "I will make sure they don't take photos... I'm sorry for this, really I am but I have to leave or he will die too."
Greg frowned. "An airborne poison? Unless it was in a spray bottle and this mystery murderer was going around spraying people, I doubt it was that."
"Because soon enough the bet I have going on with myself over you is going to equal our little Johnlock deal."
John seemed to have an internal fight with himself but gave up as he picked up Rosie. "Just, we will discuss the case when we get home but for now we are going to sing some nursery songs with Rosie."
Greg makes a mental note to give Mycroft a 20 after that comment but keeps silent as Sherlock's eyes open up instantly.
Greg, who had been walking around the crime scene with Mycroft, frowned at Sherlock. "Wait a minute you said 'her game.' How do you know it's a woman?"
"What does that even mean Mycroft?" Sherlock snaps.
"Because I..... well, John Hamish Watson, I love you."
Sherlock smiled softly and sat across from John in there chairs. "Yes I recall it when our eyes met up with each other."
Sherlock frowned again and opened the door to see Mycroft's arms holding Greg who had a goofy smile on his face as he was twirled in a circle.
Yes yes yes I have been very late with updating yes yes yes I am a terrible person BUT I'm a terrible person with an excuse ayyyyyy! So I'm in Europe lol, and I'm from the US so I'm super excited and it's a lot of fun but as I had a 7 hour flight I decided to write another chapter and boom here's an update! Yes I'm gonna be working on ANOTHER chapter ASAP to make up for how terrible I am but yeah as always please review and favorite as it gives me hope and inspiration to write more and I'll see you in the next chapter!
Mycroft arched his eyebrows and shrugged, standing up and fixing his jacket. "Sounds good I'll see you in the cab."
"John? JOHN?!" Sherlock cursed as it went to voicemail but he knew he had to calm down or everything would blow up in his face.
"Uh hey he still has to pay-" the taxi driver began but in one swift movement Sherlock whipped out his gun and pointed at him. "Ok you know never-mind tonight is on me!"
"Okay, so now we gotta check her background history." John murmured to himself, biting on a pen but his lips were still burning from that kiss and he was just out of it for right now.
Greg's face heated up instantly as it became a dark red and he cleared his throat with a low chuckle. "You know you can't keep doing that."
At first it was silent, John's gaze locked on Sherlock's serious expression with a mix of disbelief, confusion, and a tad bit of anger.
Joan just stared at Sherlock before letting her eyes drift over to John. "John, my dear fellow parent, what do you know about what happened to you? When you had that mysterious drug incident."
John stared at him as Sherlock turned on his heel and walked away. He stopped at Greg, who was watching them with a close eye.
----------------------------
Sherlock didn't know where to go first. He thought going back to the apartment would cause Mrs. Hudson to go all mother hen on him and call John demanding them to start off on a better foot. But Sherlock was not in the mood. He walked along the streets searching for something whether that be a serial killer, robber, maybe if he's lucky a homicide. But that all was ruined by a phone call. People. Not something he was in the mood for either.
To be continued! Don't worry the fanfic isn't over but I thought I would end this chapter as adorable as I can in apology for the previous chapter! I appreciate so much the feedback I'm getting from everybody and I'm so glad you all are enjoying it! If you have any more suggestions, comments or requests for future fanfics, please comment below! yousaydoctorisaywho out *mic drop*
"But that just doesn't make sense." Sherlock spoke aloud.
Sherlock blushed slightly as he just tightened his grip on John's hand and walked the two of them to their car, ready to go look at some more dead bodies...... hey nobody said their lives would be normal!
John smirked at that and patted his shoulder in thanks as he jogged out of the police headquarters.
Joan rolled her eyes and pushed John on the floor as he inhaled more and more. "Don't worry I promised I wouldn't hurt Rosie... never made a promise about you though."
John felt panic rising in his throat, anger boiling up close behind. No, he can't have this happen.
"MOUNTAIN- you know whatever shut up Sherlock." John groaned as he saw Mycroft slowly hand Greg a $20 bill. "The point is that Sherlock and I hired this woman to be our babysitter. Her name is Kat Grinly. When we dropped Rosie off she seemed concerned about having a child at her apartment and was incredibly nervous but I was too worried about the reservations I didn't pay attention to it." John said as he stared at her face. "When we picked Rosie up we noticed that Kat was nervously biting her nails and all the lights were on in her house and she was startled when the we rang the doorbell. Sherlock started to deduce her and scared the poor woman even more and I politely grabbed Sherlock and Rosie and left."
"How dare you." John stated.
"Okay now I'm ready." Sherlock said, pleased with himself. "John I want to start off by saying..... I'm sorry. I didn't want to tell you about Ketamine because I knew you would overreact like you always-"
John didn't get a chance to even ask what he was blubbering about because he was gone without seconds causing the sweater wearing blogger to just stare in utter confusion. Sherlock, on the other hand, was nearing thoughts of murdering rage as he ran up the stairs of 221B by sets of two. As he slammed open the door his eyes met with John's coat from the Taxi ride that had been carelessly thrown by Mystrade (yes he just called Mycroft and Greg Mystrade because honesty, it is obvious) during the event where John was having an overdose attack. Running over the jacket he picked it up and as soon as he did, something hit the floor next to him. Letting his eyes follow to the noise that was made, Sherlock's eyesight began to color red with rage as a familiar bottle of the antidote rolled onto the floor. Picking it up, he stared at the bottle and realized what he had done. Not only did he murder someone, but he didn't play the rules of the woman's game. And everyone knows that cheaters always lose.
"I said I'm going first, it wasn't a question, Greg." Sherlock growled as he marched over to the door and yanked it open, his coat flying backwards from the change of direction.
"Sherlock? Oh is that you? Hello!" A high pitched voice spoke from behind him.
Sherlock turned stiffly on his feet towards the fellow police officer. "What do you want."
By the time John and Sherlock got to the scene, all the police officers were chatting and taking pictures of the crime. Greg and Mycroft were talking to one another and to Sherlock's surprise, Mycroft was softly smiling at whatever Greg was saying.
"Bugger off unless you have something intelligent to say." Sherlock growls out.
"Then it looks like you're in a tough situation! You know I have a decision making class on Friday-"
Greg chuckled. "You know him so well you know that he isn't just sleeping?"
John frowned, there's obviously something Sherlock knows and he doesn't. "Sherlock you're not going to do anything rash, are you?"
Greg smiled. "Yes that! You never mentioned that part of the conversation before with Joan. So that was her plan? She is getting rid of the weaker links?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Of course you humans have such a limited imagination when it comes to murders. No, Detective, it wouldn't just be a 'spray bottle.' It can be passed through the mouth either through intimate closeness or even just your breath. Which makes it incredibly easily for parents to be affected. Speaking of, John come here."
"Sherlock, yes."
"Joan." He addresses.
Joan quieted and Greg growled out in frustration. "Then what the hell are we going to do now? Either you go make up with him in twenty minutes or you go and sell your bullshit to the police officers."
Sherlock sighed and dragged a hand down his face. "I needed a distraction."
Joan had been watching Sherlock's face with a tense expression but calmed slightly by John's words. "No I get that. He probably is just confused as to how we can calm down with herbs but they are organic and have shown some surprising results."
"I have a murder case and-"
The two boys arrived at the scene and if Sherlock wasn't so good at a poker face, everyone would see him on the verge of panicking. At the moment he just had a large dose of inner hatred for himself. He stared at the woman on the floor and wouldn't move despite John slowly walking over and investigating her.
Mycroft chuckled as Greg's realization blossomed across his face. "Really Greg you had to ask didn't you?"
Sherlock rubs his thumbs over John's hands, remaining eye contact. "I would kill for you John Watson, normal or not."
"Uh, I'm gonna uh just you know.... investigate.... yep." John murmured more so to himself as he lifelessly hailed a cab.
"That was amazing!" The patient couldn't help but agree but for a different reason. "Right, it's going to need sedation. Propofol to relax everything so I can get to the giant test tube you have inside you and extract it. Any questions?" He snapped off the gloves and put them in the bin, turning his back to give the patient a modicum of privacy to recover and arrange himself comfortably.
As everyone toasted their happiness, Sherlock leaned over to kiss his best friend, his John.
The flat felt cold and empty. Nothing like it used to be. Before. When the space had been full of life and sound of a crackling fire and the smell of takeaway and crap TV.
"Well, that's if they let me research what I want to research. Every idea I put forward they argue it's too expensive or too dangerous or not ethical." Victor laughed again.
"Mind if I cut in?" Janine smiled as she made way for John Watson to take her place in her partner's arms. She stood back and watched as the taller man's face lit up so completely at the switch.
"Research!" She squealed with delight, the colouring book forgotten.
The older Sherlock watched Victor carefully having not taken much notice at the time. He saw the tears as they formed in the man's eyes, watched as they tumbled over silently down those beautiful cheeks. Watched those lips that he had loved to kiss press into thin lines as they attempted to stop the sob that was desperate to break out from making a sound. His heart ached to know just what pain he had caused his friend, his lover, with his actions.
"There's a link?" Sherlock grabbed his phone and quickly searched for the information, his eyebrows shooting up into his hairline at the answer.
"Cold?"
"Sherlock 'Olmes?" Sherlock nodded, still reeling at the unexpected appearance of his next visitor. "Shinwell Johnson, at your service." The man bowed low and grinned once again as he straightened up. "You can call me Porky though."
"The feeling is mutual."
"Secret's out, boys."
This year would be different. This year there was a small box hidden in and among the tree branches as well as an envelope hiding under the presents. This was the year where John would ask Sherlock to marry him and Rosie would ask him to be her papa.
They materialised in the garden that was so familiar from the last visitation. It was that of his parent's house, where Mycroft, Mummy and Daddy were all spending the festive season. It was a cute little cottage painted pink with a thatched roof. Sherlock did have some fond memories of the place but as always, they were locked away lest they allow all the bad ones to escape too.
“Sherlock!” He wasn’t sure whether it was his name being called that woke him, or the weight of a nearly two-year-old Rosie Watson landing on his sternum. She giggled when he peered at her from under the edge of the duvet.
"Victor..."
"Hey, Sherl!" He turned when she tapped him on the shoulder as he rummaged through the coat rack to find his beloved Belstaff. She knew all about the famous detective with his silly hat and the, quite frankly, gorgeous coat.
"Oh, don't get me started on the efficiency quotas. It's a restructuring nightmare! Redundancies in the spirit world is a very taboo subject in that there's literally nothing else to do. Well, there's reincarnation but most people have done with life once they've suffered through it once. Anyway, that's beside the point. I can't tell you the message because I buggered it up before so I'm just here to prepare you."
"Well prove it, throw all these bloody drugs away and promise me that you will never inject anything."
"Some things, Mrs Hudson, are best left to the imagination."
"Perfect. Get dressed. I'll be back with that paperwork in a few." As the door closed, Sherlock smiled and imagined a future with someone like John in it. He made a mental note to write a thank you letter to the manufacturer of the giant test-tube. He had a feeling that he was going to owe them a lot after today.
Rosie was almost six now. Her first Christmas had been fraught with tension and unhappiness; passed from one adult to another. It was a good job she would never remember it. That, however, didn't stop John from recalling it with a sadness that overwhelmed him every, single year.
“But John, I’m…”
The room sat in darkness except for the gentle glow of the streetlights outside. Every now and again, an amber glow appeared brightening, then dimming, followed by an exhale.
"I could have done worse, I suppose." And yes, he could. They had showered him with affection and love all his life and all he had done was repel it, unwanted as any form of sentiment was.
"You died to keep him safe. You would never have left him if you hadn't needed to." He turned to face her, really stared into her eyes and let her see his heartbreak. Just for a second, he showed her what it was like without the mask, without the persona, without the coat and the hat and the blog and the cases. Just him.
"Don't worry, John, Harry's just being a smart-arse again." John had barely noticed, checking his phone for what was obviously the hundredth time that day.
"Sorry? What?" Sherlock looked up confused by the non sequitur.
"Wow! Sherlock Holmes, lost for words." She watched him swallow thickly, take one final drag of that cigarette before using the butt end to light a second before grinding out the remains of the first under his foot.
"I don't have my parents anymore. I have one sibling who was married to Clara and who is now getting divorced because of a drink problem. But, Harry is short for Harriet." John grinned mischievously.
Making his way downstairs in the dark, the light having faded long since in the winter gloom, he heard a noise from the kitchen. Half of him hoped it was John, the other half hoped for an intruder to liven up the day. He crept down the last few steps, avoiding the ones that creaked, and sneaked around to the kitchen door. It was already partially open, allowing him to see a sliver of the light that was pouring from the room. Well I didn't turn the light on. He glimpsed through the crack wishing that he had John's gun even if just as a deterrent to anyone with an idea of causing him some damage. When the person inside started to sing to himself, Sherlock froze in shock.
“Open it.” He smiled at her bossiness. John said she was learning that from him. He couldn’t really disagree. Sitting up, he accepted the envelope and followed her instructions. At once, she snuggled into his side, under his arm. On the front of the card was a bee buzzing around a birthday cake. “Read it.”
“A recovering drug addict with a very dangerous profession and dubious hobbies who also has a fuck tonne of enemies. Yeah. I know.” Sherlock swallowed and looked away. “But her father is a recovering alcoholic with a violent temper and a very dangerous hobby.” John’s hand came to hold Sherlock’s. “We make a good team. We’ll see her right.”
"Yeah, good point. Got any?" Archie looked at Sherlock questioningly as the older man wracked his brain for any stand-out moments.
"Yes, love, that's right." She nodded thoughtfully.
"I remember building snow animals in Regent's park." Sherlock smiled at Rosie's memory.
"Bring your gun, John."
"And when will that be? Three years and you're nowhere near. You haven't been on campus for months, your tutors have written you off, you haven't even got any books or papers in here at all!"
The stage was set. He just needed John to return home from the surgery.
Sherlock desperately wanted to hear John's answer but as the man himself opened his lips to speak, Porky took Sherlock's arm and the room disappeared around them.
"What? Can't I care about the fact that my baby brother is put in harm's way by that freak and yet he won't even spend a day with his sister without constantly checking his bloody phone? I'm his family. What's Sherlock to him?" John stood abruptly, knocking the table, causing the glasses to fall over with a clang.
He moped around in his pyjamas and dressing gown, unable to settle anywhere or into any activity for long at all. He tried texting Lestrade for a case but was told to 'piss off'. Apparently, he was 'on holiday from babysitting the consulting detective'. He tried to resist texting John knowing that it would annoy his flatmate. He was even starting to wonder whether he actually should have gone with Mycroft but quickly shut down that line of thought, throwing himself onto the sofa in a huff.
"Sorry, guv, you've been reading too much Dickens! Nah, we had to change the title. Ghost was too religious-sounding so they made it more secular. This means we can visit anyone from any denomination without discrimination now." Sherlock caught himself nodding and frowned.
"Sherlock, this has to stop."
"I'll stand, thank you. You have a military-style haircut and you can't help almost marching down the corridors. You stand at parade rest." The doctor laughed.
"Hopefully." Synchronised tea-drinking.
But he did leave me one thing. A gift. He gave me a way out. ‘Mrs Hudson has refurbished an apartment on Baker Street.’ Twenty-three days later, I was moving in and then met this man. My husband. John Watson.
The room was busy and full of noise and unpleasant smells. People coughing, pressing dressings to injuries, holding sick bowls. He closed his eyes, praying that the doctor would arrive shortly and put him out of the various miseries from which he was currently suffering. Time passed and he settled into his mind palace, an ear at the ready to hear the assumed name and reorganised his files on the experiment he had been conducting when this unfortunate side-effect occurred. His name was called and twenty minutes later, he was back in the waiting room, having been through triage and then X-ray where he had had the mortifying experience of having student radiologists invited into the booth to witness their first of undoubtedly many variations of this condition.
When the film finished, Rosie was asleep in Sherlock's lap.
He left the room and the patient changed from his suit into the super-unflattering hospital gown worn thin from so many hot-washes. He tied it best he could and contrived to lay on the bed with the least discomfort he could manage. A knock came a few minutes later and John returned, smiling.
"Good. And will you promise that you won't ever inject drugs?"
Recovering himself, he pushed the door open fully to reveal a man rummaging through the cupboards. He was wearing a flowery dress in tones of yellow and orange. It swirled around as he opened doors and looked through the contents, still happily singing to himself.
Sherlock sat on his bed at Baker street, still feeling the heart-wrenching loss of Redbeard, Victor and to a large extent, his innocence. It hurt to remember those events. They had been locked away in the lower levels of his mind palace for years. Even the good memories were kept under lock and key for the bad ones inevitably followed. He wasn't sure what the visitation was meant to achieve but it had definitely made him think about how those events might have led him to become who he was today. He was no longer an active drug-user but who really knew for how long? You never truly recovered, he knew that. He could still feel the pull when he was at this most vulnerable and right now, it was calling his name quite insistently.
"Not too much call for pirouetting, ya mean." They both snorted a laugh and continued to smoke. After a few moments, Janine was wondering if he would say anything else at all. He seemed to have disappeared into his thoughts, the sadness in full view for her to see. "You look sad when he can't see you." He turned to face her sharply, mouth open slightly in what looked like shock. "What? I've seen it before. Hiding behind a mask to protect the ones we care about."
"Ye've seen enough for you to make yer own mind up on that score. There's one more place I want to visit and my time is runnin' short so we need to 'urry." As they moved towards their final place, Sherlock looked back, aching to see John's face one more time.
"Why? Fancy an experiment yourself?" The doctor laughed.
"No, please, Sherlock, darling, if you love me, will you please promise to never inject yourself with drugs." Sherlock bit his lip and stood.
Unless John was now too worried to let Sherlock out of his sights. After all, they had decided tonight was a Danger Night. Maybe he should play it up a bit, disappear out for an undisclosed visit to someone. Mycroft would follow him on the CCTV and would ring John and then he wouldn't be able to go to Harry's and all would be well. Could he get away with it?
The film got started.
"I'm your gift. You get to unwrap me."
He smiled at John, stood and picked Rosie up. "Bedtime, Little Bee."
But of all these friends and lovers
"B..b...but... you're.... dead!" Rudy laughed, a full belly laugh that echoed around the room quite unnaturally.
"Soldier. Your left arm is stiffer than your right suggesting an injury of some kind. Tan lines to the wrist and collar but no further suggesting it wasn't a holiday as you stayed fully dressed for the most part. Hot country. Conflict. Afghanistan or Iraq." The patient finished through gritted teeth as he felt the probing, gloved up fingers begin their exploration. It wasn't in pain that he grimaced, it was to try and stop the images of the man behind him wearing his dog-tags, getting him ready for something more romantic rather than more intimate. It couldn't get much more intimate than it already was. He could feel his body stirring with the thoughts that were rushing through his mind.
"Well, let's see. The victims were dressed in Christmas jumpers, wore a bow and were next to a Christmas tree. You don't need to be a genius to see the obvious connection there. Tea?"
"I find you interesting. Plus, I want to ask you some questions. Like how you could tell all that about my from my phone and what sort of case requires giant test tubes." Sherlock smiled.
"How bizarre! Pray, elaborate."
"That long?" Her words a whisper.
"Not much imagination needed really, Sherlock." She muttered with a sly grin and walked away as he flushed an even deeper red before moving to stand at the window, watching the snow drifting past. He smelt John's aftershave before he felt the heat of the man himself, moving to stand beside him.
“I had a feeling it would be one of those nights.” His voice barely carried the distance to the person next to him but still it hung, like an ominous cloud between them. “It’s time for you to leave this place. Find somewhere else.” No response. Just the flicking of ash into an ashtray sitting on the arm of the sofa. “I hear Martha Hudson has finally returned from Florida. She’s had a house on Baker Street refurbished.” The smoking man simply lit another and maintained the silence. “Remember the list.” He stood, pointedly stared at the syringe, spoon and tourniquet, then left.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well then, they're idiots." The patient looked up and smiled.
Leaning over his daughter’s head, John lightly placed his lips against Sherlocks. “To new beginnings.”
"Everyone had to remain inside and wear masks. It was most strange. I suppose I had been reading Ivanovsky's dissertation."
"Hardly my style."
"He was Kermit the Frog. He was married to Miss Piggy." John chuckled at Sherlock's expression after this announcement.
"Whether you'd told me before or after 'Afghanistan or Iraq'." John smiled and leaned over to kiss his beloved.
"Right. Well, I'm free with no plans so I'll take you home. Just as soon as you've come around fully, we'll get you out of here and home. How does that sound?"
"Yes, Bee?" He was sat at the kitchen table, using his microscope to analyse the glitters from the baubles.
"We never got snow in London." It wasn't quite true. It snowed but nothing like this. Too warm and densely populated.
The following morning, John packed his bag and departed early to get the train to Harriet's. She lived in Chelmsford so he took a cab to the station and that was that. He left with assurances that he would return on Boxing Day and that Sherlock was not to do any experiments that would require his immediate return from his sister's. Sherlock once again frowned as yet another plot was foiled. He sat at the kitchen table, allowing the silence of the flat, the entire house in fact, to become deafening. There was nothing to do. No one to talk to. He was back to it being just him and Billy the skull once again.
"Dinner? I'm starving and you will be soon. Dinner?"
"Why do you need someone with you?"
"That was the last answer I would have expected. Okay then, you don't look like a policeman and I doubt one would go to such extreme lengths..."
"Hmm?"
TW - implied and referenced drug use.
"Are you flirting with me?"
"Feeling."
Sherlock let his hand drop to his side, his gaze never leaving the man before him. Affection. That's what was making his heart hurt at John's words. A deep, raw ache in his chest that he had felt before but only with John. It happened when John was away or his life was in danger. He'd felt it deep within him at the Pool, first at the thought of his betrayal and then at the imminent danger John was in. But weren't sociopaths not meant to feel this way? He'd been training himself to switch off these emotions for decades, yet here they were, clouding his mind, making him question his entire way of thinking.
A moment later, they were standing in another sitting room, this time with a view of the beach in Brighton. Sherlock knew at once who they would find there and right enough, Mrs Hudson and a slightly younger woman who looked almost the same entered the room carrying cups of tea and biscuits. They sat in armchairs overlooking the beach and sipped their tea whilst talking of random things. Sherlock had almost lost interest when something finally caught his attention.
"Yeah, didn't need to be a consulting detective to know that your name wasn't really Scott Sigerson." Sherlock raised an eyebrow in question. "When I called your name, you looked around for someone else first. Been watching who got called in before you, huh?" Sherlock chuckled. "Well, giant test-tubes stuck up your arse aren't considered that serious medically. Plus, we all like to have a laugh at the x-rays." The smile disappeared and the patient flushed beet red again. "Don't worry. I'll keep these ones to myself. Seeing as it was for science, not for some weird masturbatory fantasy." The doctor winked and walked over to the computer to schedule the procedure.
"Da! Sherlock!" She ran down the stairs from John's old room, along the corridor and straight into her fathers' bedroom. Jumping on the bed between the two men, she started telling them all about the snow heedless as to whether they were actually awake or not.
"I say, Holmes. Have you read that chap Wells' story? The Time Machine?"
"Tell me, please, have you started injecting yourself?" Sherlock sat up looking at the worried face of his boyfriend.
Sherlock was excited. For the first time, he wouldn’t be alone on this particular date. So many years had been spent with nothing more than cigarettes, cocaine and heroin as his only companions. This year was different. This year he had a friend.
"Mrs Hudson?"
Greg jumped in surprise when he walked into what he assumed was his empty office. There was John, in his chair, with a lap full of Sherlock. Greg fled, hopefully unnoticed, and smiled. Time to claim the winnings on that bet.
"It's The Grinch." She said seriously as if that was all the question and explanation that was required.
"I pushed him away. Made it impossible for him to stay."
"Sherlock, you utter bastard!"
They sipped their tea as John started typing up the blog post and Sherlock corrected him on the details.
"I do wish they would just get on with it, though?"
"This no longer gets you sent to a gaol in Berkshire."
"Do you always speak to your patients this way?"
"There's a blanket in the car. I'll soon get you warmed up." He would look after Sherlock. He had made a vow; to always protect his baby brother.
"Plastic. I'm not an idiot." John raised an eyebrow. The patient rolled his eyes. "I'm not a total idiot."
"That's the general idea. Got any you fancy going to see?"
"T'sfor an experiment."
She replied, "Merry Christmas, boys."
"John?" A short, sandy-haired woman in her late-forties walked out of the kitchen carrying a bowl of roast potatoes. Sherlock deduced that this must be Harry, John's older sister. She looked well, better than the last time he had seen her. He had followed John once as he went to visit following her release from rehab, again. She had looked gaunt and pale, sunken-eyed and far too thin for her frame. Maybe she was taking it seriously this time. A taller, brunette followed behind her and John was the last to leave the kitchen.
"If I had told you that this would be how we would end up, would you have believed me?"
They walked in silence out of the french doors that lined the wall of the garden room. The sun had long since set and the evening air held a slight chill, quickly taking away the 'too-warm' of a moment ago and leaving her shivering slightly instead. The man beside her noticed at once and after slipping the rectangular box and lighter from his coat pocket, placed it over her shoulders before walking ahead of her again. He stopped on the patch of flat lawn a few steps down from the terrace, the moon highlighting his cheekbones as he ripped the wrapper from the box and fumbled out a cigarette, lighting it and taking a deep inhale before turning to look at her. He gestured for her to take one.
"You've never supported me."
Now to get him remembering birthdays...
"We?" At Rudy's annoyed look, Sherlock shook himself together. "Sorry. Who is we? What did you do and why is it having a negative effect on me?"
For tomorrow was Christmas Eve. Mrs Hudson would be off to her sister's for the week leaving a pile of mince pies for Sherlock to live off while she was away. Mycroft would go to their parent's in the morning (it was his turn this year having owed Sherlock a favour for some legwork he had done during the summer) so he couldn't even see his brother. Not that anything but sheer desperation would induce him to seek out that particular form of torture. The morgue would be closed and everyone of interest at The Yard would also be spending time with their families even though he had no idea why Lestrade would want to spend time with his wife. Not now he knew that she was sleeping with the PE teacher. Again.
"You think so?"
"I don't even think you know what love is." Victor spat out the words and turned away to hide his tears, his anger receding rapidly to be replaced by nothing but an empty sorrow.  "Last Christmas, I thought I could see our future. Living together, hopefully getting married if it ever became legal. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. And now you've thrown it all away. For drugs!" He gathered up his coat and a few of his things before heading to the door. "Goodbye, Sherlock. I hope you find the one who can set you on the right path eventually. I'm just sorry it wasn't me." And he left, walking out of Sherlock's life forever.
"No. I think I've seen enough here." He took a deep breath to try and quell the almost overwhelming feeling of sadness and longing he felt. If he could, we would appear instantly, sit in the chair set for him and enjoy being with his family. After everything he had put them through over the years, that they would still want him there and still care about him was a testament to their love. He vowed to try better in the future to spend more time with them, even if it was just in short bursts. Little and often maybe. Yes, that would do nicely.
Opening another email with yet another, far too easy to solve case, his phone made a moaning sound. The familiar noise stopped him in his tracks and he simply sat and stared at the phone. Eventually, he tapped to open the message.
"I know an excellent Chinese takeaway that's on the way to my flat. They do excellent dim sum." He finished with a smile.
"I don't think they're that different from non-gay weddings, dear."
It had started after the incident at Sherrinford. Drinks after work once a week. Text messages. Phone calls. Dinner. He'd assumed it was under some false sense of duty to begin with, a task that had been handed out by someone who had his own issues to deal with instead. But now, he wasn't so sure. Now, he was thinking that he had an actual friend. The first one he had ever had.
"Why do we eat turkey at Christmas?" John looked at his daughter who was busy with the new Christmas colouring book Mrs Hudson had bought for her. She was sitting on Sherlock's lap as he typed on his laptop, the pair of them sharing the desk as had become their norm. Sherlock looked up at John as did Rosie, the pair of them waiting for an answer.
"Right. I take it you're here to show me Christmas as it is now. Today, in fact."
"That's not true. I can a great deal about you. And Mummy and Daddy." Mycroft paused to allow his younger brother to recover slightly. "It hurts to lose people or things you care about, doesn't it?" The boy nodded and stroked the collar once again. "How would you like to never hurt like this again?" Young Sherlock looked at his older brother, questioningly. "I can show you how and your heart will never ache like this again." The brothers looked at each other for a second before the younger one nodded, almost imperceptibly. "Good. We'll start tomorrow. I'll show you how to stop."
"Good to hear. So, tell me, was it just standing on the floor and you were naked and slipped and the rest is history..." The patient had never been so embarrassed in his life! He felt his cheeks flame hotter with each passing second.
"You were shot." John turned to look at his patient.
"Shall we have a look inside? Something smells good." Sherlock sniffed the air and smiled as he realised his mother had cooked one of her famous roasts with all the trimmings. He hadn't been a fan of food since his days as an addict. It has wreaked havoc on his metabolism and to this day, couldn't stomach more than a few mouthfuls of food at a time. Unless it was sweet things. Then he could manage a bit more. But the smell right now made his mouth water and his stomach rumble.
"Oh Myc! You shouldn't spy on your brother! He has to have some privacy, he's a grown man." Sherlock thanked his mother silently for backing him up. "And besides, he's living with someone, isn't he? You might catch an eyeful of something you wouldn't like if you keep spying on him." Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Greg shared a look with Mycroft before stepping forward and looked at Sherlock in the eye seeing the glazed look. "Damn..."
John frowned and scrunched his nose before nodding and walking over to Sherlock. He was being cautious as the detective didn't seem his normal self; that is if he even has a normal self.
When they got back to the apartment, John was wheezing with laughter as Sherlock chuckled deeply.
He turned at the mention of his name and eyed the other man. "John?"
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose as he slowly walked to the window. "Sherlock I understand you're upset-"
"I need to test something because we've both been around the children. If Rosie was at the daycare-"
--------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
"I don't want him." Sherlock mumbled but Mycroft shot him a glare.
At first Sherlock was silent but he turned his steely eyes towards Greg. "Emotion."
Sherlock felt his throat close up slightly as he coughed and hung up the phone, not bothering to answer. He stood up and walked to the window and saw that John was sitting on the edge of the ambulance with Greg chatting to him, phone in hand as if he had just told Sherlock that the anecdote he took killed not one but two people. However if Joan hadn't given one to John, why would she not give one to another person? Balance? She had been perfectly fine killing one at a time.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond but the door opened with Greg and John leaning against each other. Greg softly helped John sit on his chair with a smile before turning to Mycroft who smirked.
John frowned down at Sherlock, okay frown is too nice of a word... maybe glowering? Fuming? Shaking with anger?
Sherlock at this point was pissed as he quickly spun around and threw a vase on the floor, shattering everywhere. "I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE! Mycroft, if John discovers what happened here, he will never forgive me and feel guilty. Now I know what guilt feels like and if I don't take it well, neither will he."
John sighed as he sat at the parent night. He was pissed at Sherlock. No, he wasn't pissed; he was hurt. But anger was his default mode for when Sherlock does something stupid so that was his only excuse. Him and Rosie were sat on the carpet during which Joan was having everyone do some exercise with their babies. John was not in the mood and was lazily moving Rosie's legs back and forth like she was pedaling a bike.
Greg stared with his mouth open slightly as Sherlock basically said exactly what happened at the meeting. "Sherlock you need to come down to the station and state exactly what you said to me if we want to make sure Joan doesn't hinder our own process."
Maria frowned and something flashed across her eyes, a cry for help. "I don't know what you are talking about...."
"Drunk, Sherlock. I was meant to go to that parent meeting but I couldn't because... Well I don't know why but I woke up with a headache and no understanding of the night's adventures so PLEASE, do me a favor, and just leave me alone for right now."
John was at Joan's meeting.
Check bottom of chapter for notes from yours truly ;)
"Let it go," he mutters.
Everyone was silent including John who just stared in silent admiration. Finally Greg cleared his throat.
Sherlock blinked in confusion and sighed. "John, to begin I just want to say-"
Sherlock nodded in consent and sat at the table as John grabbed the dinners and place them down in front of the two boys.
For a moment, it was normal. Then John's look grew serious.
"You think this was all a ploy to get you to name the girl Sherlock?" Sherlock grinned. "I say I'm a sociopath, but I do know some people."
I'm going to give a rough estimate of 3-4 chapters. Hold me to finishing this one this month. Comments are very very appreciated; they keep me motivated.
"Well I'm glad. And tired. I'm gonna head to bed. Text me if Lestrade turns up with anything this week."
'He was a mess after you...left,' Lestrade admitted hesitantly.
Sherlock shook his head, trying to squash bad memories. "There was nothing else that could have been done," he said. "I was already stuck in a place that faking a suicide would be believable. It worked out to--for the most part--play into Moriarty's hands."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Godfrey?" Sherlock asked.
"I think you have Transfiguration in seven minutes, Sherlock. You wouldn't want to be late." Dumbledore smiled, standing and gesturing to the door.
Mycroft grimaced. "You know my feelings on this sort of thing. Alone protects you, Sherlock."
"You nearly might have," Sherlock muttered. "Let me pose this in a way that's actually helpful: what can we do to assure your safety, but also guarantee Will's?"
John followed Sherlock into the Fischer's hotel room, and they both stood before Mr Fischer, Will Fischer sitting in the corner, nervously.
John shook his head, standing and following Sherlock downstairs to where he heard the kettle whistling. "You boiled water for tea?"
"Do. Not." Snape said lowly.
"If it means helping that young man, I don't mind breaking the law at all," John said firmly. His mind went back to Sherlock's face when he had asked if Will Fischer was safe from his father and the cold hard feeling that had settled in John's stomach. Something in his face made Sherlock nod, looking more at ease.
'I got hurt,' Sherlock said tightly, looking up at Lestrade and gritting his teeth. 'Badly,' he said in response to Lestrade's look. 'I was...I had to take care of some things that related to Jim Moriarty's death at the end of last term. It got me in a bad spot with some bad people. Mycroft had to get me out.' He sighed carefully and closed his eyes. 'It's fine now.'
Sherlock took a breath in, closing his eyes. "Difficult. What's her name?"
"Where--?" But John was silenced as Sherlock started at some quiet noise, and pulled him behind one of the larger potted plants against the windows.
John put his hand on Sherlock's back. "C'mon. We can visit her tomorrow for lunch."
" 'Mr Holmes
"Mycroft Holmes informed me that Moran got ahold of a wand, somehow, and injured Greg Lestrade in the process." Dumbledore's look darkened. "I heard you two were in the area, Mr Watson and you. We are lucky nothing more serious happened."
"As much as you try to, John used to protect me," Sherlock fired back. "I haven't forgotten after father's death."
"No lies this time?"
He heard John sigh as they walked out the front, spotting Mycroft standing in the street, conversing with two people who must be aurors. Lord Moran stood in the center of the small crowd, a calm look on his face. He then looked over, spotting Lestrade, Sherlock, and John, and his brow furrowed. Sherlock turned back to Lestrade. "So he really didn't put up a fuss?"
Molly and Sherlock looked at him, wide-eyed.
There was a knock on the door. Lestrade frowned and stood. Sherlock and John watched him, curiously.
John laughed, reflecting on how often Mrs Hudson shared about her husband's drug ring over the past months.
"Did you ever find out how she died? Besides who did it?"
"Do you think he'd want me to?" Too late, Sherlock caught the eagerness in his voice and looked down into the depths of his pumkin juice, scowling at Molly's laugh.
"So, I'm sorry I couldn't say more about why I was calling you here in the owl; it's not a long story, but it's not one I would like to say in any way other than in person."
Long overdue update.
"It's your decision," Sherlock said softly. He didn't want to let what he thought might be feelings for John play into it. If he was making enemies, he still had to decide how close he should keep people he cared about, and he didn't want to decide based on some hope that John was leaving Mary for him. For all he know, John was completely straight and had no interest in him whatsoever. And as Sherlock's last boyfriend had hung himself, Sherlock wasn't keen on having to deal with anything happening to John, or being reminded of that if he were to get in another relationship.
"Shut up," Sherlock said, but a corner of his mouth turned up in a smile, betraying him.
By the time several police cars and Lestrade's familiar car pulled up, John had a strip of his cardigan pressed to Sherlock's forehead and Sherlock had his coat wrapped around them both for warmth. Lestrade hurried over to them as soon as his feet hit the ground, looking more concerned than John had ever seen him.
Sherlock smiled. "Happy Christmas, Mrs. Hudson."
'He brought me back to London, don't worry about what Mycroft wants...' Sherlock paused. 'I don't want to bother Mrs Hudson so late. Might give her a heart attack. And John... well again, sneaking in to see him late at night wouldn't be the best. Do you ...mind if I stay here until the morning?'
"She doesn't," William said. He exchanged a look with his father. "She said she had a photo of...of me..."
Sherlock immediately tackled the gifts marked "from the Watsons". Mr. and Mrs. Watson had gotten him a potions book and a deep navy-blue sweater, respectively. Sherlock smiled, tugging the sweat over his head.
"You let me grieve for 4 months. How could you let me do that? I thought you'd...killed yourself."
"Lestrade," Sherlock said, "What group is it, exactly?"
Sherlock let a smile tug on the corners of his lips. "I have to don't I? Astronomy and History of Magic are gonna be rough."
"The music isn't bad," Sherlock said, "but I'd never heard of it before. Makes me want to mess around with the violin."
"I spoke to Mycroft about your time away," Lestrade said somberly, as the pair set off down Baker Street. "Or rather, he contacted me." He looked at Sherlock seriously. "I can't believe he let you do that."
(See the end of the chapter for
More to follow.
"A monster," John said darkly. Something dark and sad flashed across Lestrade's face and John looked down, tension clear in his frame. Sherlock took John's hand in his own reassuringly. John smiled at him.
An hour into the trainride, Molly Hooper walked in. Sherlock flinched at the sound of the door opening, standing up straight and then shivering violently as she threw her arms around him as he stood.
"Yeah. We should get outside; I doubt the building is very steady after this." Somehow, Sherlock's voice was less shaken than he looked.
Sherlock nodded mutely and stepped out of the car, pulling his bag and Sigerson's crate out with him. Lestrade didn't pull away yet, seemingly to make sure Sherlock got inside safely.
All he could do was act.
Sherlock frowned, tying his scarf around his neck. "Are you ready, John?" he called.
"Care for a walk?" he asked Lestrade, after the wizard had finished helping Mrs. Hudson clean up. Lestrade nodded.
Sherlock and John made their way through the building, flushed with what they had scene.
Sherlock would've liked for things to remain this way for a long time. Whatever Lestrade's place in his life was, Sherlock liked it. He would've liked to just disappear from the world and have Lestrade keep his place. Lestrade made a better family member than much of his real family did, Sherlock often thought.
John continued, "If they're busy, there's less chance there would be trouble, because Milverton couldn't ask anyone else to show up, they'll all be dealing with Police presence. And then milverton would be stupid to do anything to us, because again, police presence heavy in the building."
"Because Milverton deserved it," Sherlock said shortly.
"I'm just... not sure about it. And lately I've just been seeing her as a friend. Since that day in Diagon Alley, I've been thinking that maybe I just asked her out as a way to...move on after your death. I think I needed someone, and people like Murray and Mike just weren't cutting it. Even Molly. She's sweet but she's... young." John shrugged. "I dunno."
"What's this?" Sherlock looked inside, seeing a long, black hair. "You didn't--"
Sherlock sighed. "When does he ever say anything useful?" He looked over John's head. "Molly, this is the Gryffindor table."
"How the hell did you know?" he sputtered. Sherlock smiled.
'I don't remember you being this good,' Sherlock said, grunting as he shifted in the back seat.
"We have to get something of the person we change into," John said, two weeks later, as the two of them sat in Defense Against the Dark Arts, waiting for class to start. "Who are you thinking?"
"Solved the problem easily," he muttered. "You got the same 30 seconds in the room with the man; he deserved it, yeah?"
"You're sure you're safe?" Sherlock asked gently. Will nodded.
"I wouldn't mind a double date with them," John said, smiling offhandedly. Sherlock blinked. "Just not anytime soon."
Sherlock flew above everyone, squinting for the snitch. He'd found it twice but held off on diving for it as the Ravenclaw seeker didn't seem good at all at seeing anything. Gryffindor needed the points anyways. Already up by 90 was good, but if he could hold off longer, it would put them at a better chance of beating Slytherin this year.
John looked up at him, torn somewhere between punching him and forgiving him. "Practices start next week. I only had two spots to fill, and you were one of them. Our first game is soon but with OWLs this year, I was putting tryouts off."
Originally, this scene had no Mrs Hudson, but it felt like a disservice to leave her out since she's arguably the biggest part of most any Sherlock Holmes' family.
Sherlock smirked. "Well then I jumped off a building."
"Yes, definitely." Mycroft sighed. "This is all a pain. One day I want a team to do this, but no one else is this trustworthy."
"You're smoking now."
"I'm assuming you will do the right things because it's what you've been striving to do for the past five years," Dumbledore met Sherlock's eyes. "Our choices say far more about us than anything else."
She looked curiously from him to John. "You're the two from that blog, aren't you?" She looked at John again and John shifted. "His blog. Love that stuff, it's brilliant. Irene's not in trouble is she?"
"We both know that would never work with Sherlock. He'd sense them the moment he arrived." Mycroft smiled bitterly. "I trust you're both doing well."
"I told you exactly how I was feeling after Victor died. If I'd been inclined to lie, I might have been much more cheerful."
"I don't," Sherlock whispered. He looked up to find Dumbledore smiling sadly at them both.
"Theater students always seem like trouble," John said, shaking his head. Then, with a glance at Sherlock, added, "And now I know to be suspicious of the nerds..."
Sherlock shared a bemused look with John and then they both followed Dumbledore up the stairs to his office. John's jaw dropped at the enormous amount of magical objects around him when he stepped inside, and Dumbledore led them to his desk, offering them the two chairs before it and then sitting himself.
"Most people tend to keep silent about it. It was a hard time, filled with mistrust and sadness." He looked down. "My mother died during it. One of Moriarty's family was among the people that killed her."
Nell's eyes narrowed and Irene looked from Sherlock to John. "After Fischer's previous attempts to trespass, there hasn't been a night we haven't been ready for another attempt to steal the photos."
"Milverton really agreed to meet you here this late?" John asked, looking at how dark the hall was.
John shook his head. "Not while we're in class." He sighed. "That Potter kid would be about what 5 or 6 now, wouldn't he?"
"My husband left the record with me before they put him to death," Mrs. Hudson said. "John got sherlock a t-shirt with some of the lyrics on it, show him Sherlock."
Sherlock laughed out loud, causing several people to stare at them. "You're serious?" he said.
"Yeah." John smiled. Then his look grew serious. "I'm thinking of breaking up with Mary."
Sherlock chuckled and let a silence stretch on for a few moments. "Are we in a place where we can joke about those things now?" he asked curiously.
He started up the stairs to their flat and Mrs Hudson called after him, "You both come for dinner when Sherlock gets home!"
They sat down in speedys, ordering sandwiches and tea, and gossiping about John like teenagers at lunch (although he wouldn't know from experience, only from overhearing).
"And even you," Sherlock said seriously. "I never blamed you for being angry. Any of the times. I wouldn't keep staying by your side otherwise." He looked at John, blinking as he realised he'd been leaning slightly across the table toward his friend and tried to ease himself backward.
"Please--" Milverton started to say, but Smallwood cut him off with a threatening flick of her wand.
He snorted painfully.
"I hate you," Sherlock repeated, looking defiantly up into Mycroft's face until his wrists were released and he tried to support his weight on his legs as he stood and ended up falling to the floor slickened with his own bodily fluids. "I ...hate you..." he said weakly, and Mycroft took his arms and helped him to stand.
Sherlock's non swollen eye found it's way up to his current abuser and he swore as he recognised the face that lay beneath the hood.
"I thought you were dead," John said in a small voice. "I've never lost anyone I cared about...loved so much."
"Don't be an ass," John muttered, smiling faintly. He stood as a tall man with blond hair and a young man with similar features were led in by Sherlock. "hello, John Watson."
"You're assuming I'm on the right side. I'm hoping it isn't because of my house, sir," Sherlock said, looking out the window.
Sherlock nodded. "Pity we'll be out of Hogwarts by then. His parents were supposedly great wizards; he'll probably do well."
"Yeah and you got all worked up about it. I knew from the beginning, you know."
"I was washing dishes," she said apologetically.
"Save that strength for getting out of here," Mycroft whispered roughly as they passed through the door. "When you're safe and back in Baker Street you can hate me all you want but for now let's make sure that's possible."
Snape let out a mirthless bark of laughter. "That old hat knows who we are. It doesn't make mistakes, Holmes." He looked at Sherlock. "If you were meant to be in Slytherin, you wouldn't be asking to make a potion to help anyone, or to get some practice at the NEWT level." Sherlock opened his mouth to reply and Snape cut him off. "In my office, evenings when I summon you. You are to come on your own, I don't want to see any sight of John Watson. Or any of your little friends. I am to be with you at all times. Understood?"
"Really." She said. "Go rest up someplace, you look like you've been through the mill. I'll see to John." She smiled.
Something in Sherlock's heart wrenched and emotion caught in his throat as he nodded and hugged her back tightly.
"The actor?"
She turned her mouth corners up in a small smile. "Okay."
John turned to Sherlock, every thought in his mind telling him his friend must be gay. He wondered why it mattered so much to him, to know what his friend was, what sort of people Sherlock was attracted to. Maybe he just worried for Sherlock, and wanted him to have some kind of human connection.
"Sherlock."
Class was just starting as Sherlock slid into his seat, barely listening to McGonagall's lecture. He knew he would pass the Transfiguration OWL fairly well without much revision, but if the examiner was anything like mcgonagall, he would have to work a little harder.
"We're all human," Sherlock said softly, and John looked up to find Sherlock's eyes as soft as his voice.
"John. If you don't want me near you, I won't. It doesn't mean I don't consider you a friend." Sherlock swallowed heavily. "I probably always will."
"Mr Watson relayed his concerned to me about wanting to be a healer in times of action." McGonagall was wearing a smile rarely seen. "I thought that was an excellent idea, considering the times of struggle we've been through. And still might reach."
"Irene emailed me last night," he admitted, sticking his hands in his pockets. "She told me the full story. I should've been honest and trusted her, just told her how my dad was but..." he shook his head, smiling bitterly. "It's embarrassing to admit you're scared of what someone might do."
Sherlock looked to the front page and froze for a moment. the headline "CHARLES MILVERTON MURDERED" was slapped on top of a large photo of the man's face. He skimmed the article below, relaxing slightly as he saw no signs of accusation.
Sherlock sighed, pried her off him. "I need everything to continue how it was. Or as close as it can be." He met her eyes. "Thank you tho, Molly."
"Well, if you're gonna be like that-"
"Friday night. You're planning on seeing Milverton at his office in the Ministry? Not in a more neutral place?" Lestrade frowned. "Dunno if that's the best course of action."
People moved past him at their normal paces and no one looked twice at him, so Sherlock felt quickly more at ease, checking the shop windows for signs of John as he hurried by, wondering if he should linger in one place and see if his friend were to walk by.
"We won't let him see any of the other photos," John said, and Sherlock looked up, meeting John's eyes, the clear grey ones cold and hard with resolution. "We'll get them away from Irene, and we'll keep you safe."
"Damn right I am," Lestrade said, meeting Sherlock's eyes and smiling slightly. "Alright?"
"What are you--?"
"Did he send you out there?" John asked.
Sherlock got to his knees, shakily. "Playing?" he snorted.
Sherlock spun around quickly, wondering how he hadn't heard Lestrade come in. Lestrade looked at Sherlock with searching eyes, and then a gritty smile broke out across the man's face before he crossed the room in two easy strides and pulled Sherlock into a tight hug.
I will not be editing what I've written already here, because I want that progress to show. I grew with this series and I will continue to grow with it.
John punched him, square in the face, Sherlock let out a bark of bitter laughter that John mistook as amusement and tackled him, down the stairs flat on his back on the ground. Sherlock bit his tongue in pain, grounding loudly as John attempted to throttle him.
And John finally turned, Sherlock smiled, and John was standing, standing looking unsettled and shocked and afraid, disbelief and anger chased themselves around his friend's features and Sherlock stood quietly, allowing it.
"Well, I'm just glad you didn't give her a heart attack,' he said, giggling as Sherlock sat up, glaring at him. 'Apparently your stupid brother didn't let her know.'
"We'll keep poking around," Sally said. "Also I overheard McGonagall. You two on the auror track?"
"Did you come here to ask after our health?" John asked. He still wasn't sure what he thought of Mycroft. Something about him put Sherlock at edge whenever his brother was around, and John knew he didn't like that.
"No, just me, I'm afraid, for now," John said. Mrs Hudson huffed.
Mycroft said. 'Be careful. It's still a dangerous climate out there. There's a threatened terrorist attack on the rise and in your absence a new teacher as been called to Hogwarts. As well as this, I have some things of my own to take care of at the ministry.'
"I was there at the end of last year, just before I was supposed to leave Hogwarts." Sherlock was silent for a moment. "Lucky, really that I wasn't expelled. I didn't think that Dumbledore or Mycroft had anyway of fighting against Moriarty's plan to prove I was a fake at academics.
"I don't give preferential treatment to students, Holmes. Least of all someone from outside my own house."
"Soon I'll be in America, with Godfrey." Will pulled something out of his pocket. "Here, this is for you, as my thanks. It doesn't mean a whole lot to you, probably, but..."
The son, William, shook John's hand. Fischer ignored it. "Yes. Delicate enough that I don't want it told to more than one pair of ears."
"Also, Sherlock, I did as you asked and passed along all the info I found for you to that Inspector Lestrade. He seemed really grateful. Hopefully nothing dangerous happens at the Ministry," Sally said worriedly.
"Oh really?"
Sherlock sat back and looked away. "No."
"Ohhh, that's a lyric by a Muggle band," Mrs. Hudson cried, "My husband had one of their albums from someplace or other, but never listened to them. I'll dig it out for you in a bit so you can listen to it. I think that song is on there."
"About?"
Dumbledore inclined his head. "Thank you both. If you do find whoever tried to harm you, Mr Watson, get in contact with me soon. That sort of thing has no place in this castle."
"No, this one stays out."
"I left and came here. Mycroft and I are on better terms now but I wasn't going to spend anymore time at his than I had to."
It was two days before John came into the common room, late at night, looking slightly worn, but on the whole, healed. Sherlock was relived, although he tried his best to appear relaxed. He didn't, however, avoid eye contact and bend back over his astronomy homework.
"Thanks," Sherlock said. He looked at the attached card.
Sherlock frowned. "At least he won't be threatening people anymore."
"Your parents were some of the fighters in the last Wizarding war," Dumbledore said softly. "And your quest for justice both inside these walls and out has not escaped notice. Sometimes we create our own demons, other times they are just looking for someone to prey on." He looked wistful. "Just be careful. Enemies you make have a way of coming back to you, at costs you are often not prepared to sacrifice."
"Does John know?" Sherlock nodded. "And you didn't tell anyone by choice you said, oh god, was he okay with it? He has alot of internalized..."
"Um yeah!" Nell looked to Irene. "Irene you know where--" Irene nodded and hurried off.
"Didn't know you played," Lestrade said, sounding impressed. "is that friend of yours, Bell, coming?"
Quickly, he dove down to field level, smelling something like smoke. It wasn't long before he saw what.
Dumbledore shrugged. "I think we should be cautious. There's always something bigger out there, isn't there?"
Mary looked from Sherlock to John, where they sat in the entrance hall, before John's Divination class.
Irene sat back in her chair and sighed. "He's making a huge deal out of nothing. Will's father expected me to come back and marry Will, I'd said yes as a joke, I honestly thought Will was joking when he asked." She shook her head. "That was the day I came out to him."
John sat back, fumbling for his phone as his ringtone went off, realizing he'd forgotten to silence it. Mycroft's name flashed on the lock screen; John hit ignore call, silenced the phone and repocketed it, mulling over the difference between the Holmes brothers. At least Sherlock's texting didn't tend to be so annoying.
The three of them piled around Lestrade's kitchen table and began to eat breakfast. Lestrade pulled out the Daily Prophet and set it on the table. "You both know anything about this?" he asked, mouth slightly full.
"He's dealing with the same threat that Dumbledore wanted to take over from me."
Fischer rose and shook their hands. "And you're positive no more harm will come of this?"
"Right, well, good luck in Divination John, I heard Trelawney is on the warpath today." She waved to them both as she hurried off.
Lestrade hesitated. "If you two had been investigating Milveton at the time..."
Sometime later, Sherlock and John left the Three Broomsticks, stopping into Honeydukes briefly to stock up on sweets, and headed back to the castle.
"I would take it up anyways," Sherlock said firmly. "I don't like people who prey on other people's private lives."
Mycroft frowned, shooting sparks from his wand and Sherlock twisted far out of the way to avoid it before sending a jet at Mycroft, lightning fast and it seeped into his brother. Mycroft raised his hands in defeat.
'Sherlock, what's-'
John hurried in silently when he heard the muffled sound from Sherlock, and found his friend, bleeding from the eyebrow, laying on his back on the floor, and fending off Irene's firsts. John grabbed her from behind, quickly dragging her away from Sherlock and she screeched, biting his fingers. John swore loudly, shaking his hand, as Nell rushed into the room, and saw Sherlock rising to his knees. The four of them locked gazes with one another, waiting for a movement.
Sorry to Mycroft fans if he comes off as a bit of a jerk, but i feel like these two had a lot of issues to work out before they could get to how they were when Mycroft appeared in the Conan Doyle canon.
"What about Polyjuice potion?" suggested John. "The downside is that it takes a month, but if we use that time to figure out how to get through his locked door, we could use the potion to become a couple of teachers and go in without him thinking anything of it if he catches us."
"My son was due to be married a year ago." Fischer shifted. "His junior year in college, he met a woman his age that he was quite enamored with." William blushed. "He asked her to marry him, and she said yes. This year she disappeared. Came to London, supposedly on a gap year. She's American, although she'd been in the UK for quite a while."
"You were there for Milverton," Lestrade said, beginning to walk with them toward the front of the building. "You're gonna tell me what happened so I know if he's gonna be a problem later for you both."
John shook his head. "Just wasn't right. I think you need a certain person to be with you while you're a colleague and friend of a detective." John smiled slightly. "Dangerous work, odd hours, and all that."
"So what did Dumbledore say about Milverton and Moran?" John asked at dinner, piling his plate high with chicken and potatoes.
"One fixed point, no matter what happens," he breathed, keeping eye contact with John. "Your acceptance, no matter how eventual." John smiled faintly. Sherlock decided he didn't want to think about things, or worry anymore. How much trouble could have, and nearly, separated the two of them before this? He leaned over and kissed John softly on the lips, before pulling away, face feeling far warmer than it did before.
"Next time let someone else handle it, me, or anyone else who thinks you being alive and safe is more important than winning a battle," Lestade said. Sherlock looked at him.
Sherlock didn't sleep that night. He sat on the couch until the early hours of the morning, absently petting Sigerson and looking out the window to the London streetlights outside. He wasn't sure he wanted to go back to his life at Hogwarts, in this world. He didn't know if he even could, after the summer "vacation" he'd had.
"Someone is with him," Sherlock breathed into John's ear. He felt his heart pumping quickly, distracted by John being so close; oatmeal scent of his friend's hair filling his nose.  Sherlock shook his head. Not now.
"No, but I should extend the curtesy of asking after you both on both accounts." He turned to John. "I take it you are fully recovered?"
Mrs Hudson laughed. "John, how was your Christmas?"
"So you want me to ask everyone what their Ministry employee parents have been doing?"
Sherlock shook his head. "Once it seemed all that mattered. I don't even know if Mycroft knows. But I think for now, it doesn't matter."
John thought of the burglary they would have to commit. "You're including me too, right? Because I care too, and I want to see this resolved properly."
"I won't," Sherlock said, flicking the cigarette away. Snape made a face, "-let you catch me again," Sherlock finished, turning to walk to the castle. Snape grabbed a fistful of Sherlock's robes and held him back; Sherlock flinched and whipped his head around to face Snape, silently chastising himself you are fine you are fine youarefine. Snape quickly let go and took a step back.
Sherlock grinned. "Alright."
"Seven years difference at our ages is not that big a difference."
"Didn't know we were doing a double date today," Sally said, smiling at Sherlock, who flushed. John laughed.
"Mycroft?" John asked carefully. Sherlock shrugged.
"Mmm?"
He kept his gaze on the table. "We had magical investigators up here--not Lestrade, though, not his division. McGonagall also called me in for a chat. No leads."
Sherlock nodded. "We'll decide the rest over our break once you've heard from Mary." He hoped it would go easily enough. He had no idea what they would have to say to Milverton, or if their confrontation would only mean them later having to break in and steal anything he had on anyone else... Sherlock frowned at the thought, wondering how many people Milverton might be after currently.
"And what about you?" Sherlock said, his voice soft and kind.
And yet he sat tweeting and arguing with Mycroft at meeting.
"Yup." Sherlock watched as John wandered off to the portrait room to take the quickest path to the tower, wondering if this time, it was John who wasn't telling him something.
"Coping." Sherlock looked away wistfully.
John blinked again. There was fire around the sides of the pool, Sherlock was gently treading water trying to keep both their heads above. "Yeah..." He looked around, ignoring the pain in the back of his head. Moriarty was gone.
Irene rolled her eyes, slowly walking into the room and sitting in a chair opposite Sherlock and John. "Oh, please tell me you aren't trying to flatter me into giving up those photos."
"Irene Adler. It's a pleasure to meet you," Sherlock said. "We might be here because of Fischer, but your reputation as a young actor proceeds you."
Hope you've enjoyed reading this and that it holds as its own little story for a while.
"Don't you drink with the minister in the Hogsmeade pub on some weekends though, sir?" John asked.
"New development, as of last night." Sherlock smirked at Lestrade. "Lestrade knew, though he pretended not too." Lestrade's face grew pink.
Something in Lestrade's voice told Sherlock he understood, without him having said anything, exactly Sherlock's thoughts throughout the past few hours. Sherlock didnt know how to express how grateful he was that the inspector hadn't said anything to sway Sherlock's thoughts either way.
Today wasn't the day John would be let in, or the day John would pry his friend to open up. He figured, as he passed Sherlock a mug of tea, that that would come naturally, like John's breakup with Sarah recently. He knew Sherlock had probably figured it out, but held back from asking, just as John was now.
"Unless he memorized it all. Knowledge is power enough, just starting the rumor is even more dangerous."
"You can have the seeker spot, but I want the field back to train the team until you and the new keeper start with us," John said.
"How bad were you hurt over the summer?" John asked. "And were you still hurt when I hit you in Diagon Alley?"
John grumbled, opening his eyes slowly. "Smells like bacon," John said yawning. Sherlock nodded. "Morning."
"So you were never in love with him?" Sherlock asked, cocking his head.
"Lord Moran, Shackbolt, and Davies are the ones you want to watch. Let me know if anything changes," Sherlock said.
'I remember you being that rude.' But Anthea smiled. 'I'll take it as a compliment, sir.'
"Mmm? Oh, name of his son. It'd been in the paper's earlier this year that the son of Derek Fischer was graduating. Top grades, wants to do medicine or something." Sherlock waved his hand. "William, his name is."
John met Sherlock's gaze and the two started to make their way out of the ministry as quickly as they could.
'NEVER do something like that again, Sherlock.' She looked up into his eyes, and he felt shame at not telling her, not giving her word. 'I will not lose my boy again, do you understand?'
"Fear is an infectious condition," Sherlock muttered.
Sherlock laughed bitterly before he could stop himself, and a sharp pain rushed through he chest. He gasped, clutching his injured ribs, slightly regretting his refusal of any kind of magical medical treatment from Mycroft's staff. Lestrade jerked, his face quickly becoming more concerned, but Sherlock shook his head and took a step back as he leaned against the wall, making sure he could still breathe steadily.
John took off his coat, hanging it on a hook in the hall before following Sherlock into the front room and watching his friend carefully prop up the photo on the mantle.
"What can you tell us about Godfrey Norton?" Sherlock asked, without preamble.
His brother ran his tongue over his lower lip and let out a breath. "Well..." He cleared his throat, walking over to Sherlock. "Thankfully, you're in this good of shape then."
"Sherlock," Bell said, not taking his eyes off his work, "I trust you're well and healed from the summer."
"Do you think we should talk to him about it? He probably knows and works with whoever it is." Sherlock nodded slowly.
"It isn't my fault they make so much private," Milverton hissed.
Sherlock gave a cold laugh, standing to his full height. "You mean you didn't know Will's father is horribly homophobic or that he might be in danger if those photos were proven real to his father before he's able to move out?"
"My father has only seen one of them, and told there were more," WIlliam said in a shaky voice. "If you do see them, please don't let my father see them as well."
"What is-?" But John closed his mouth as McGonagall walked in to start the lesson.
"Stop here." Sherlock had his hand on the door handle as the cabbie slowed. John looked around. A couple buildings, a phone booth, and a 24-shop.
Sherlock shot him a look. "If you can do good, you should do good." He looked to Dumbledore. "I'll keep in touch. With both problems."
"I'm right here..." Sherlock gasped, trying to even out his breathing. Lestrade turned back to him. "He's mad at Mycroft... not at me." He felt himself shake slightly.
John couldn't judge the tone of Sherlock's voice. "Yeah."
"We were actually looking to speak with you," he said. William looked from Sherlock to John, who smiled friendlily.
Sherlock nodded. "I didn't get the impression that there was someone Will knew well in the photo, but if Irene was friends with this Godfrey Norton..."
John caught up with him, four days later, a potions vial in his hand, seemingly empty. He handed it to Sherlock.
So hey, if you've stuck with me this long, things won't be changing too much, but there will be some differences. And I promise it'll be in the name of a better, more complete, and better story that I feel good about.
Sherlock nodded. "She baked, didn't she?" he asked, sounded like he was forcing exasperation. "We'll have leftover desert food for the coming week, knowing her."
"Yes."
"Shame about it," John said. He looked over to Irene, who re-entered the kitchen, thumbing something in her pocket.
Sherlock smiled warmly. "Of course, John. See you later."
John grinned.
'Don't drop me at Baker street,' Sherlock said quietly.
"Yeah but-"
William Fischer opened the door to the hotel room where he and his father were staying.
Mycroft smiled tightly. "How are things with John?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Client coming up at ten." Sherlock moved to lean against the well, idly watching John pull on socks.
William spoke in a more steady voice. "I don't know. We're supposed to be friends. Or were. I know she was really upset and scared when father came after her to marry me." William looked up at Sherlock. "I was, too. He's... forceful when he sets his mind on to something."
"What do you mean, not exactly? Your body was at my feet you fucking bastard."
John nodded, setting his bag down and pulling out ink and quill to start on Flitwick's essay. "I'll help. I think you're right about having the place to do good. We've both been at work on helping people for the past five years. Making enemies or not, it's important."
Sherlock approached the patio slowly, suddenly nervous of how John would respond. But he put that all to the back of his mind as the sprung careful up the three steps, feet treading lightly on the wooden boards, and carefully approached there table.
"I know." Sherlock's soft voice preceded him into the kitchen. "Just not as fine as it should be, yet."
Sherlock shot back a grateful look, some light in his eyes that made John smile faintly. "Well then, let him come." And John followed him into the flat.
Fischer sat forward. "Really?"
"You would do that?" John said. Sherlock nodded. "Even though you're just in it for the puzzles?"
The air in the room froze. A light smile preyed upon Dumbledore's lips. "If I had many more people half as perceptive as you, we would be able to win the fight against those who would wish to do us harm before they gained any traction."
John shrugged. "Can't turn down your best mate after he's saved your life."
"I don't care what she does, Mr Holmes--"
"For good reason," John said. "In theory, I'm good. In practice not so much." He looked at Sherlock. "Have you checked in with any of the Slytherins? A couple of Mary's friends have parents in the Ministry, I bet they would be good ears if anything is going on."
"Er. Right. Yeah." Sherlock looked over. John was looking intently at his shoes.
"You sound confident in that assertion." Dumbledore's eyes had always been piercing, but some days, moreso. Sherlock held the gaze.
"I'll have your arms in next," the torturer said in anger, spitting on the boy's unkept head as the boy shivered, wrists chained to the wall so he couldn't wrap his arms around himself. He pointed his wand at the boy's left arm.
They paired up for vanishing spells practice, something McGonagall insisted would be on their OWLs.
Sherlock closed his eyes and smiled faintly before heading out to John.
Sherlock and John sipped their tea in silence for a few moments, Sherlock trying to ignore the fact that his hands were still shaky. He was lost in thought until one of John's hands covered his own on the handle of the mug, incasing his hand in further warmth. He looked at John.
"Good. Then part two: low on your radar, but important." Dumbledore shifted, and John narrowed his eyes, wondering if the headmaster was uncomfortable with the next topic. "Lady Smallwood, who is important in the ministry, is being blackmailed."
He had Sally Donovan poking around for information about Shackbolt; her parents worked in the same office as him and Sally had said that they knew most of the gossip around the office. However, she'd seemed reluctant at first to keep tabs with them. Moran was someone Sherlock could keep track of; it wasn't hard to sneak into the village occasionally at night and talk with people who knew him-Moran had close ties with the school and drank in the pubs in Hogsmeade every weekend. And Davies had a son a year under Molly.
Mrs Hudson smiled at him, but said nothing. John put his head back and groaned.
"Are you insane?" Sherlock asked. "What if we got caught?"
"We'll see about Christmas," Sherlock said. "Trying to see what Lestrade and Mrs Hudson are up to. Bell got back to me last week; he's gonna be busy at Mungo's, apparently. But he might be able to come by for New Year's."
An hour later he trudged into the Gryffindor common room, thoroughly tired out. But feeling better than he had in weeks. He'd forgotten how much he'd actually loved flying.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, standing and shouldering his bag. "Afternoon, Professor."
Sherlock blinked, looking up at John.
"I think if you keep away from her she'll definitely keep away from you," John said.
John nodded. "It was nice to meet you properly, sir," he said.
"Yeah," John said firmly.
"Oh, are you boys back already?" she asked. "I was planning on asking you both to have dinner with me." She smiled at John.
"He seems to think there's a danger lurking out there. But he doesn't have eyes everywhere, or contacts. He's limited." Sherlock shook his head. "I sent him and owl once I got back but..."
"No, I don't either." Sherlock met the man's eyes. "Good Morning."
"You've become quite sassy, John, not sure it's growing on me." Lestrade looked Sherlock in the eye. "You were in his office last night. I'm pretty damn sure I know the pair of you well enough to assume you didn't murder him. But there's no way you snuck in there and didn't see something to do with this."
"Where is Dumbledore's office, even?" John walked evenly alongside Sherlock; either Sherlock was walking slowly or John had finally matched speeds with his friend's long legged strides.
"And you speak as a man who tries to keep a private life and a low profile," John said, amused.
Irene nodded. "I'll do my best to help with anything, as long as it's not getting involved with Will's father." She smiled. "Nice to meet you both, Mr Holmes, Mr Watson. Nell and I read your adventures quite a bit."
John sighed, exchanging a look with Sherlock, who motioned for everyone in the room to sit.
"Mostly," Sherlock smiled at John. "Man who's a very important businessman in Germany. And his son. He used a fake name on the website though."
"Oh, we're home," Sherlock breathed faintly, sounding relieved a little while later. John looked out at 221b, the boarded up windows letting out little light.
"Auror track?" John looked to Sherlock.
Soon they were pulling up at Baker Street in Lestrade's car. He turned to Sherlock. "Do you want me to come with you?"
"Sherlock-"
"Good you two are pairing up. Both of you finishing off the next three years on the auror-required studies," McGonagall commented as she watched Sherlock and John take turns practicing on a matchbox.
Sherlock blinked before drinking a large amount of butterbeer.
"Yeah, they were great," John said, sounding thankful. Mrs Hudson beamed.
"Yes, in fact. It seems two people weren't answering their texts after escaping a bomb in a swimming pool." Mycroft shook his head. "Anyways, we have leads on Moriarty.
"Sherlock." He opened his eyes and looked at John. "You don't have to tell me anything until you're ready." Sherlock smiled softly.
Everyone was rushing down from the stands and onto the field, Hooch was landing not far, Sherlock sat up to see McGonagall running to them, concern on her face. Mary wasn't far behind, looking somewhere between murderous and teary-eyed. Sherlock looked down at John in time to see his friend faint--he pawed John for injury and was relieved to see nothing besides a few burns. He struggled to his feet quickly, pressing the snitch into Hooch's gloved hand and ignoring the shocked look on her face before slipping through the crowd to get away and get some air. He vaguely heard McGonagall call his last name but continued on until he was outside the field, finally able to breath.
All they could do would have to be good enough.
"Brown hair, not too old." Sherlock shook his head. The most surreal conversation he'd ever had. He was glad to be able to call Mary a friend. "Now you can have a good laugh at John for his reaction when I came out to him." Sherlock shook his head. "You've had one of the best."
"That's something, though. A connection to Dumbledore." At everyone's questioning look, Sherlock explained as he slung his bag over his shoulder. "My brother seemed to imply that whatever is afoot in the Ministry might also affect the school. Need more data though to see how."
He held open the door for them hesitantly. "Alright."
"Is that potions? Need any hel-"
"Had a scuffle with Miss Adler and her flatmate." Sherlock gestured to the healing cut through his eyebrow. "In the midst of it, as she tried to wrench the harddrive from my hands, it broke."
"This is the eighth night in a row," Snape growled quietly.
A jet of red light hit the boy squarely in the back and he fell on his face with a cry of pain, curling into a ball and shivering slightly as five man surrounded him in a circle.
The man stood slowly, before walking over to face sherlock and roughly grabbing Sherlock by the hair, eliciting a whimper from the abused boy.
Irene looked at him, flushing a little. "Godfrey Norton. Sort of a heartthrob at the uni he and Will are still at. He's in the photo to. It would be real shit of me to get him into trouble as well."
"I cant believe you told her, you're usually so private."
"We'll probably have to. Or else next time it might catch him off guard if it's someone closer to him." They pulled up to where the Fischers were staying. "For another day, though."
A grin broke out across Anderson's face, and he laughed slowly. Sally sniffed and raised her head, the back of her hand wiping her eyes slightly.
Not sure when I'll start working on part two, or if I'll stick to Hounds as the show did, but it'll be up soon.
A few minutes later they were sat in a private room in the Three Broomsticks, pouring over pages of information on various employees at the Ministry.
Sherlock frowned. "Tricky though, isn't something like this out of our depth?"
"And on Christmas too," Mrs. Hudson sighed. "Horrible time of the year to be stuck in hospital." Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock snorted, but with real amusement. It felt funny in his throat.
"I'll just find a hair of his in his office or something." Sherlock shook his head. "Who were you thinking?"
He flinched as Lestrade knelt before him, a firm hand back on Sherlock's right shoulder, this time grounding and comforting.
Is the angst better this year at Hogwarts because instead of family and bullying, Sherlock's doing the emotion?
"You would think Mycroft's owls would get here at the regular time with everyone else's mail," John remarked.
John's familiar tread hurried down the stairs from his bedroom and then down to the front hall. "Sorry. Definitely need to do laundry." He looked at Sherlock. "Remind me again why you think simply talking to her will be any good?"
Lestrade smiled. 'I'll even take you to Mrs Hudson's myself tomorrow. I'm off work, no major cases.Do you want food or water? You can take my bed if you want--the couch folds out into a bed-'
John blinked. "What, you know her?"
"Sorry," John said, looking between Sherlock and the two Ravenclaws. "Last all four of us were in a room together, you two hated him."
This takes place on Jan 6th (if you didn't know SH's birthdate)
Sherlock nodded, setting his face. "We'll get the photos from her; she keeps them on a flashdrive. We'll destroy that and wipe her laptop. I'll report back to your father sometime tomorrow, and make my own excuses for why the drive will not be in his hands." He looked at William. "Don't worry. How soon until you're able to move away?"
"John I told you about my father in our third year. The only ones who knew about him were Bell and Mycroft, and Mycroft only knew to an extent."
"I've been reliably informed that I don't have a heart," Sherlock said, pointedly. "But as someone said quite recently, while threatening a friend of mine, it isn't quite true." He looked at John. "We need to clean this up neatly so that kid doesn't have to fear from his father. If not, I'll find a way to keep him safe."
"What?" Sherlock asked in a low voice, looking out the sides of his eyes at John. John would never know how Sherlock could read people to tell when they were about to ask a question.
It was dark in Lestrade's house after Sherlock had picked the lock and let himself in, locking the door behind him so as not to raise suspicion to Lestrade. He wandered around slowly, backpack slung over one shoulder in the least harmful way to his injured body, surveying the photos on the detective's walls, looking at the cheap furniture, empty bedroom that barely looked used...
"Suppose you're still not getting caught this late."
John made a step closer. "No, we haven't seen them," he said comfortingly, wondering what could be so worrying about the photos.
"I hope they'll be happy together," John said softly. Sherlock turned to him.
Sherlock looked at him. "And we make a good team."
"Not quite," Sherlock said quietly, still looking at John.
"I'm Nell," she said, leading them into a room and gesturing to the small couch. "Nell Huxleigh."
Molly looked at him sadly. "You can do that on your own, definitely. I bet it would be someone in your house. " Sherlock bowed his head in acknowledgment. The point of rivalry between the two houses didn't escape him. "What about John?" Molly said softly.
"Then I'll come to the practice before the first game."
"Because it's the one thing that didn't seem to cross Fischer senior's mind," Sherlock said, tilting his head. He led the way out the door and hailed a cab.
"Yeah defeated by that baby." John shook his head. "Crazy, I'd only heard about the Potters."
"But you died, you jumped off the astronomy tower... last year we all..." She was shaking her head and looking from him to John and back.
"You smell of cigarettes," John said lowly.
"Suppose that's changed to," Sherlock sighed. He turned to look at John fully.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock snorted. Then frowned as John spoke again. "So your mother?"
"So it's not about John nearly being killed or my... stint over the summer," Sherlock said slowly. Dumbledore inclined his head.
John gave him a look.
"This needs to stop. I don't care whatever is going on in your personal life, or whatever you help out with, here or elsewhere." Ah so Dumbledore had informed at least some of the staff, Sherlock thought. "You are not above the rules, and you are smarter than this." The black eyes pierced daggers into Sherlock's and Sherlock sighed. "If Gryffindor mattered to you I'd take off 40 points. Regardless I don't want to catch you again."
Mary giggled. "I looked up the definition on one of those websites. "A fair haired
"Are you...?" John trailed off, looking into his friend's eyes, thinking to the hardness in them when he'd heard of William's father's homophobia. Would Sherlock trust him? They hadn't known each other for very long, considering. "Nevermind," John muttered, looking away and out his own window. Sherlock huffed.
Sherlock pulled on his heavy Gryffindor robe and scarf and followed Lestrade out the door.
He cleared his throat. "Vo-You-Know-Who rose to power, then there was a war against him and his followers. It wasn't pretty, because many of us got wiped out. And then, for some reason, he went to kill the Potter family-"
They sat down and make quick work of breakfast. After they were done, Mrs. Hudson cleared the table and summoned the gifts with two quick wand movements. Sherlock admired her skill in wandless magic; he hoped one day he would be able to do it.
Sherlock felt himself flinch heavily as the green jet sprung from Smallwood's wand and hit Milverton. Sherlock's flinch had tilted the potted plant, making a thump, and John's hand clutched Sherlock's wrist in anxiety. As Milverton crumpled to the floor, dead, Smallwood looked their way, advancing to the plant, wand at the ready. Sherlock's heart hammered against his chest.
If you've been reading this fic long-term, thanks for sticking with it (really, means alot).
John watched as the two filed out.
Bell snorted. "Hope you fired the bastard. That's not so simple a mistake." He pulled out his wand. "Mind if I?"
John nodded. "Do you think it would work with some of her cat hair, or do you think that counts as an animal transformation?"
"Very," Mycroft said icily. He then took to inspecting his fingernails. "I talked with the man, turns out he was the wrong sort for the job. Blathered on about Moriarty for ten minutes. Which wasn't much useful."
"You'll just have to put up with that risk, then," John hissed at him. "We agreed; I'll be a look out."
"So did everyone else, believe me, it wasn't just you-"
John snorted. "Important software?"
The torturer pockets his wand with a hurried "I'll be back for you," again in Polish and rushed out of the cell slamming the door behind you.
When he got out of the shower, he slowly walked back to the couch and his backpack, riffling through it to find a clean t-shirt, and froze when he heard Lestrade walking through the hall. The footsteps also froze outside the doorway to the room that Sherlock was in and Sherlock didn't dare turn around, knowing Lestrade could see that marks of 3 months of abuse on his shirtless torso. He didn't want to see Lestrade's face or know what Lestrade was thinking. He didn't want questions or concern.
"So Milvertone is dead," Dumbledore mused. "My question, Sherlock, is why are you so unwilling to tell me who it was?"
"Irene Adler," William said softly.
"Concerned that having you with me might compromise us," he muttered, pausing beside the wall of the flat next to Irene's.
Here's what's been up. Since high school (a looong time ago) I've been working on this little series here. Lately it's been a good part of a year without touching it, a year at least without seriously working on it. My writing and what I want to write about has changed alot.
"Sherlock?"
'The orange juice,' Sherlock called back, closing his eyes briefly before pulling on his t-shirt. He hovered in the doorway until Lestrade handed him a glass, noting the Lestrade looked as if he hadn't slept either.
"Two butterbeers please."
"Once I told him that was more in line with being a superhero, but Sherlock insisted that superheros were inferior to pirates, because pirates were ordinary people, without powers." He looked away, still smiling faintly. "Never fully understood my brother."
"No!" Irene looked unhappy. "Will's been one of my best friends. I would never do that to him. Or Godfrey, for that matter."
Mary titled her head. "During this conversation I'd assumed you were blond and a child when you'd chosen your name..."
Sherlock thought for a moment. "I think we're going to have to speak to Milverton over break. Find out what he's up to. Mary or Mycroft might be able to help us get into his office at the Prophet, or maybe meet up with him at the Ministry somewhere." He paused as he saw Anderson and Sally walk in through the door, holding hands tightly, their faces red from the cold wind. He tilted his head, grinning, and John looked over as well. Sally pulled off her hat with her free hand, her hair springing out and Anderson watched, his eyes soft. Sally hurried up to buy them butterbeers and Anderson looked around the room, making eye contact with Sherlock then John and blushing, before heading over as John waved at him.
Sherlock found himself smiling slightly. "You found a good choice in girlfriend, John."
"There are some things that one would like to keep private. The people who have targets painted on their head are trustworthy and in a position to do good if things turn foul, whether in the Ministry, or here. Or if we were to have a second great war. There are many things that could cause a waver of trust in even the best of people."
"Did you tell my brother that?" he asked curiously.
She waved him off, seeing him to the door as sherlock went up to his flat and looked around, admiring the dust and stuffiness of the place.
'Right,' Lestrade said softly. 'Is it just the ribs?' His eyes searched Sherlock's clothed frame.
"Mmm."
Sherlock watched he walk off. Then he turned and went his own way.
Sherlock blinked at the timing. "What? You two seem good together."
He and John both dropped their jaws in surprise as Milverton backed into the office at wandpoint. A moment later, Lady Smallwood followed him in, murder written all over her features.
"You're not talking about a second great war are you?" Sherlock said, his voice small in his throat. McGonagall shot him a look.
"I'm assuming good news?" Fischer asked, looking from Sherlock to John.
Sherlock knocked carefully on the front door, taking a heavy breath to steel himself. Then the door swung open and Mr Watson was staring at him, clear and total shock over his face.
"what the hell hit me?" Sherlock asked, groaning and rubbing his forehead. he watched as Mrs Hudson made a face and pointed to her frying pan on the counter.
Sherlock grinned. "Morning, John."
It was still early in the morning when he decided to borrow Lestrade's shower and change into clean clothes and be ready when Lestrade woke up to go wherever he would go next.
Hope you continue reading, thanks for keeping up this far (check out my fics for years 1-4 if you haven't yet, it means a lot)
"Oh yeah for sure. Just making sure you're okay. He'll forgive you, you know."
"What do you think, John?"
"Sherlock wha-" John stopped. "Have you been thinking about him all term?"
Sherlock looked over to where John was sitting to see Mary come over and kiss John on the forehead. John laughed, smiled. She looked up to meet eyes with Sherlock. Sherlock looked away. "I'm leaving it open to him," he murmured.
John helped her fan out the kitchen. Sherlock strode in. "Can we turn off the alarm?" he shouted above the noise. Irene poked her head around Sherlock's tall body.
Sherlock snorted softly. "You're smarter than you look, you know that?" John laughed softly at Lestrade's face.
Anderson and John groaned. "We can't go one day without OWLs talk," John said. "A reminder of how I'll fail out of the auror track with potions."
