Predictably, Sherlock knew a restaurant where the owner owed him a favour and was happy to stay open a bit later than usual to accommodate Sherlock and John. John’s saag gosht was amazing. So was Sherlock’s murgh kari when John asked for a taste, but Sherlock himself merely picked at it – and that only when he wasn’t occupied with shredding a piece of makki di roti.
Ivan thought her chances of survival were higher than the silent man’s.  But at least they had chances.
my maternity clothes if you take my backaches and never-ending trips to the loo as well!” she snapped. “I’m more than ready for this to be over.”
Sherlock frowned and seemed to be about to speak, but John was addressing Mary, who’d lowered her chin.
“She’s nursing. My abdominal muscles are contracting. It feels as if... Actually, I can’t think of anything comparable.”
“As you’ve noted yourself, what we are about to attempt is dangerous.  You should take this, but don’t let the guards see it.”  With that he plucked a long, crimson red feather from his wing and handed it to Ivan.  Ivan carefully tucked it inside his shirt, but when he looked up again, Sherlock was gone.
John had drawn his gun and taken the safety off the moment he was out of the pub.  The distance was hardly ten metres, but in the poor light and with a moving target, he had almost no way of ensuring that he’d shoot the killer instead of Sherlock.  Still, he braced for a shot, hoping to get an opening.
“Did your wife write this, sir?” John asked - and then kicked himself.  He hadn't meant it to sound as if a beta
“To the university. Uncle Don said that Dr, uh, Dr Fook-oh?  That Dr Fooko worked there, he’d looked it up on the Internet.  And I said it was late, Dr Fooko must’ve gone home by now, we should come back the next day.  But Uncle Don said that scientists never sleep.”
“So why not tell us?” Lestrade asked – and then answered his own question. “Because he’s tracking them down himself.”
My Grade 10 biology teacher for showing the class a film in which a new born joey about the size and shape of a jelly bean hauled itself up the vast expanse of its kangaroo mother’s belly to the safety of her pouch.  I sat perched on the edge of my seat, terrified but unable to either look away or breathe, until the joey vanished into the pouch.  What if Mumma ‘Roo had sneezed?  Or been startled?  What if a strong wind had kicked up at the wrong moment?  It was a traumatic experience – and one that instilled in me a huge respect for the tenacity of life.
Sherlock moved up. John leant forward.  He had no trouble seeing Sherlock now in the dim street light that filtered through the curtains.  “Hi there, handsome.”
She pushed past Lestrade into the flat and set the tray down.  “Don’t expect me to be doing this for you again, John Watson.  I’m not your housekeeper!”
off his face.  I wanted to do something and I didn’t know what to do and the lady kept telling me that help was coming, she kept
Not Sherlock’s. This curious flatness had nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes and his boring, security-mad client at all. John had his own life, and so did Sherlock. A life which included his new megfriend and alfriend. Would Sherlock want John to be his best man? He wouldn’t want Mycroft, certainly.
that had been Sherlock started to become paler in colour, as the form that Muircheartaigh’s spell had trapped him in started to give way to something new.
“Miranda Caustlin gave you her phone number while you and Gavin were in the pub two weeks ago,” stated Sherlock as the cab pulled into traffic.
“Marfa Hudovna, how long have I been gone?  For I know this tree was not here the last time I came to your house.”
“So beautiful,” John said again, and held him, gentling him, letting him come down slowly. Sherlock slumped against him, so very much like a dead weight that if it weren’t for his heaving breaths, John might have worried.
“Please,” said Foucault, and stretched out his hand for the card. “I am the last of the research team that did this wrong to Donald McKinsey.  I would be grateful for the opportunity to make even this small amount of recompense.  I will call your DI Lestrade, Mr Holmes.  Thank you.”
Inside, the keep was dim, cool and eerily silent.  There was no one in sight – no guards, no servants, no courtiers.  As Ivan hunted for a route that would take him to the north tower, he began to realize that what he’d derided as sloppiness in the security arrangements was rather the supreme confidence of a powerful sorcerer who could rely on his magic alone for protection.  Trying to ignore the chills this thought gave him, he continued to try this corridor and that, eventually discovering a winding staircase that he was fairly sure ascended the north tower.  He was about to start climbing when the ever-so-slight noise of fabric sliding against fabric caught his attention.  He spun about, sword at the ready, but no one was in sight.  However, he noticed that the stairs led down as well as up.
“Things moved more quickly than she expected a second time when she surprised you while you were getting your things and the two of you quarreled. She took a second pregnancy test again that evening. The test was negative, although at this point it was at least two weeks after the possible conception date. She decided that it was time to cut her losses. She packed a bag, informed the landlord that you’d be along to clear things out and left.”
time, it was years ago and my financial resources were more restricted than they are now... Yes, he’s here... Fine!”
Sara blinked at what appeared to be a change of topic but answered readily enough, “The gem amethyst is called thus because it is said to be efficacious for this purpose.  And there are certain herbs that can be useful as well.  But you ask because...?”
But Sherlock replied quite seriously.  “Humankind’s opinion of itself of overinflated.  Various other animals are at least as interesting – if not more so.  Personally, I find bees fascinating.”
“No, they’re generally only recommended for children at least four or five months old. But look, for the first month or two you should still be able to get around pretty well. It’s the next three months that things get tricky. We could use Skype, we’ve done that before. I do the footwork, you handle the deductions.”
“John, I didn’t take the risk of sneaking back into the UK in order to shoot the one beta who might be willing to carry this child. Furthermore, the woman who helped me do it had also managed to find out what agency Sherlock’s birthmother used to work with. Speaking of which, does Sherlock have a sister?”
“How many betas were there in your class at medical school? How many did you serve with in the army?”
“Breakfast, dear,” replied Marfa Hudovna, and she opened the kitchen door and looked at him expectantly.
Another shrug. “Once Janine’s story hit the papers, Lestrade was bound to return with more questions. Mary had already warned me to keep silent but anyone who knows me – including you – would have told her how poorly I listen to warnings. She had a motive and the means. I decided to deprive her of the potential opportunity.”
John smiled back and they shook hands. “I remember you. And if you know anything about mobiles at all, I’ll buy whatever you suggest as long as I can afford it.”
“Remind me never to make the same mistake,” muttered John as they continued along the pavement. Then, in a more conversational voice, “How’d you do that, with David?”
Anger stiffened John’s back and shoulders. “Right. Well. Right, then.” He headed towards the door, then turned on the threshold. “I’ll be in touch. If I remember to.”
Ivan went, through the hangings and up the narrow, twisting stairs.  He could feel the tower quivering beneath him like a nervous horse.  When he emerged onto the battlements, the sight that met his eyes was appalling.  The entire keep was in flames, the southern tower already collapsed in a sprawl of loose stone.  Flames flared from all the windows in the walls that still stood.  For the first time, he understood the enormity of the task Sherlock had undertaken and wondered how long the creature could sustain the effort.
“I think we’ve got past that point, Sherlock.  You’re standing there with a great hole gaping open in your chest.  I take it that this is the part where I pick your heart up?”
“A new and ingenious compression algorithm,” breathed Sherlock. “If we could find out what it was...”
“Yes you can, love, come on now,” and with a high, fierce cry, Sherlock did.  Ivan stroked him through it, stopping only when Sherlock reached down to bat his hand away.  Then Ivan cradled Sherlock against him, letting the other man catch his breath.
“Not that I know of. I’ve been careful about that,” Mary replied. Her voice was calm and steady. Her hands were clenched into fists. “And to answer your question, John, I never expected anything of you – except that I thought you might want the option of doing the best by your child. If giving it to St Bart’s to spend its first year in an incubator is the best you can come up with, well, I’ve lost the right to judge, I suppose.”
“Oooh, the puppy’s angry!  I’m so scared!  Did Sherlock tell you that you were worth more than that?  Honesty’s the best policy,
“Father, we don’t know that there’s a curse, it could all just be a coincidence of events.  And Harrieta doesn’t need to marry someone of royal or noble blood, she just needs to marry.”
Mary was light when John could see only bleak grey. She was laughter when John could hear only relentless silence no longer broken by a baritone voice.
“It corrupts the magnetic strip. The card stops working. It’s a common problem – never put your key card with your phone.”
The picture Sherlock painted was so grim that Ivan attempted to lighten it with a joke. “Didn’t that get boring after a while?”
of January with some trepidation, not entirely sure that Sherlock and Mary would neither kill each other in his absence nor collaborate on setting the flat on fire.
“Enough to buy a cottage in Sussex,” said Lestrade, coming in through the door behind them. “Donovan’s heading down there as we speak to ask her some more questions. Up until now we’ve been assuming that Sherlock was in Magnussen’s office for a meeting, but if Ms Hawkins is this pissed off at him, that puts a different face on it.”
“I know how that goes,” replied John. And when Dexter looked blank he added, “Being a doctor, I mean.”
“I’ve performed fellatio before.” Sherlock’s voice was closer now.  John looked up in time to see him settle onto the bed towards the foot.  He was fully dressed except for his shoes.
There were moments of discord, each theme striking precisely the wrong notes to mesh with the other, but these were always resolved.  The music woven by the two themes grew ever richer.  Nor did it ever end.  It simply grew softer and softer, until there was no music but only the two violinists, looking into each other’s eyes.
“Not important, never mind. Can I taste your chicken or have you eaten it all? We should try that out as a fantasy.” Sherlock dropped his voice to breathy quasi-whisper. “Oh, John, this child’s going to have your appetite! My teats will be all swollen and sore!”
“Since 14 years ago and no, he doesn’t have to,” John retorted. “If I may?”  He indicated Sherlock, who was now holding the yellow tape up so that John could enter.
The paperwork turned out to be more than “a bit,” but eventually John made his way back to the morgue, where he found Molly conspicuously alone and indeed, rather surprised to see him.
“You have to stay here long enough to give Mary a chance to turn into someone else,” John realized. “Someone other than Madeleine Holmes.”
“The Committee’s not particularly prudish,” Sherlock noted.  “It is, however, concerned that efficient use should be made of all available housing units.  The poster is attempting to find a compatible flatmate before the Committee assigns someone rather less so.”
Mr Holmes set down his cup and got to his feet. “May I take that for you?” he asked Mary, indicating the suitcase.
Strangest of all, though, were the places not covered by feathers.  At the end of each arm, the creature had a pale, slender, long-fingered human hand.  And amidst the black feathers of its head, its face was perfectly human, although pale and somewhat exotic in appearance, with high cheekbones and silver-grey eyes.
At this there was much consternation among the guards.  They seemed to have no captain among them who might make a decision for the group.  There was some discussion of taking the matter directly to Muircheartaigh, but no one was eager to be the man who would “disturb Himself at His work.”
After supper, John washed up and read medical journals for awhile.  He’d need to do something about getting himself some lighter fare.  Or a telly – did the UBR have television?  It had just been getting going in the United Kingdom at the time John left.
“In his mind, certainly.  If you were to ask him, he’d probably say his arch-enemy.  He does love to be dramatic.”
At which point Toby and Archie made gagging faces and chanted, “Ock, ock, ock, ock!” in unison until thankfully interrupted by a knock at the door.
Sherlock gave his brother a narrow look. “And your team found no significant stores of information elsewhere in the house.”
,” groaned Sherlock.  “If you’re taking advice...”  He lifted his hips from the sofa and shoved at his trousers and pants.
John refrained from entering into a debate on the existence of order in the mess and instead mildly pointed out that he was merely looking for the laptop that Sherlock had
“Had a go at it yourself, did you?” John smiled, imagining a younger Sherlock, eager to follow in his hero’s steps – and possibly win a Nobel of his own.
With a put-upon sigh, Sherlock extracted his phone and dialled.  As he’d predicted, Lestrade was not yet in, but the sergeant on duty took down the time and place of the rendezvous, promising to pass the information on to Lestrade.
“That’s up to the magistrate. In your favour, you’ll be tried as a youth and it’s your first offence.  The charge will likely be criminal damage but not aggravated criminal damage.  It’s possible that the magistrate will accept that you were largely an accessory to the crime rather than an active perpetrator.”
“Yes.  Wants to meet me for dinner.  Talk about old times, he says.  The last time we spoke was that tiff almost two years ago, and now this.  Something’s up, I just don’t know
John had not only made the coffee but drunk a mug of it by the time Sherlock exited the bathroom, blowing a kiss back inside before he shut the door carefully. With only a towel wrapped loosely around his midriff, he gave John a sheepish grin as he slid sideways into the bedroom. John was on his second mug by the time Sherlock reappeared again, this time wearing black trousers and a white shirt.
John wondered just how quietly he and Sherlock could have sex for the next two and half months. He didn’t think they’d been all
Next Marfa Hudovna gave him what appeared to be an empty sack.  “Keep that with you, dear, to hold food for your journey.”
.  The bite of apple Ivan had taken stuck in his throat.  His eyes stung, not entirely from the after-effects of the smoke.  He remembered Sherlock as he had last seen the creature.  Sherlock was,
The Caustlins had taken the Tube to St Bart’s, so Lestrade drove them to the Yard, leaving Sherlock and John to take a cab. As it turned out, this was probably just as well.
The errant hand trailed lower, following the centreline of his torso as she kissed his neck, his check, his ear and finally his waiting lips. She rolled over a bit further, her soft weight partly on top of him as she took his cock in hand. He was kissing her back by now, their tongues sliding together, his arms around her as she began to stroke and squeeze. His mind still ran in circles around the question of Sherlock’s whereabouts, but his body – and a good portion of his heart – responded to the warm and generous woman in his arms.
They walked on in silence. John took deep breaths, trying to calm down. After a long while, he could finally speak again. “Someone did that once, did they? Hit you when you were already injured, then told you to stop whining.”
4)	The names given to biological divisions of mammals use our own species as the norm to an amazing degree.  Because we are placental mammals, placental mammals are considered to be eutherians – literally, good beasts.  Marsupials are metatherians, middling beasts.  Beasts that didn’t quite make the cut.
A few days later, Sherlock was given permission by Dr Dixon to resume his normal activities. (John checked with her to ensure that she understood what said activities entailed.) He chose to celebrate by executing a flying tackle in a filthy alley on a bloke who outweighed him by more than seven stone.
The real Mrs Holmes wore a similar outfit and carried an outdoor jacket and oversized purse, presumably taken out of the suitcase. “Timothy,” she announced, “You’re wife’s going to miss her flight if you don’t hurry along. Off you pop!”
“John,” said Sherlock as they recovered their breath in bed that night, “It should be no more difficult to purchase omega hormones than beta hormones.”
The traffic eventually began to move again, slowly.  As they crept further into the city, John began to see older buildings interspersed among the ugly new ones.  Then it became more like ugly new buildings interspersed among the older ones.
She showed up first thing the next morning just after Sherlock had woken up again, this time a bit more coherently. John met her on the landing near the foyer.
Bloody hell, it wasn’t as if he hadn’t already seen most of Sherlock’s body already, at least from the hips up and the thighs down. He’d spent enough time patching the man up after various misadventures.  He knew that Sherlock carried scars from Mary’s bullet and from the surgery he’d needed afterwards.  Other scars on Sherlock’s back suggested that he’d been beaten.  John knew those hadn’t been there before Sherlock went hunting down the remains of Moriarty’s empire.
Wishing for his bedroll, Ivan wrapped his surcoat around himself and curled up on the ground, pillowing his head in his arms.  Yarkovolos, bright-hair, flame-hair – it was almost as strange a name as Sherlock.  Bright and flame-coloured he certainly was, but why hair?  Why not feathers?
“Did he tell you...,” Muircheartaigh paused, obviously for dramatic effect.  Ivan had seen such tricks before in his father’s councils and among the courtiers.
“I know who they are,” snapped Campbell-Williams. “I read the papers.  And I would hope, Detective Inspector Lestrade, that you haven’t called in your celebrity consultant for the sole purpose of reassuring us that the police are
given John permission to use.  After some grumbling and a few false starts, Sherlock excavated the laptop – a blocky thing that couldn’t have weighed less than a stone – and showed John how to access Uber.
“No, I couldn’t, love,” said John ruefully. “I’d never last for as long as it would take to get you prepared.”
“I was walking across campus one evening and noticed a sharp pain in my ankle. When I looked down, there was a miniature bull terrier attached to it.  I was still trying to pry the dog loose when its owner appeared, offering more apologies than assistance.  I pointed out the obvious: that he was an only child, that his parents’ wealth was self-made in manufacturing, that he was the first member of his family to attend university, that he was only there because if he’d refused to go, they would have thrown him out of their home, that although moderately intelligent he was failing all his courses because he didn’t give a damn and that it didn’t matter anyway because his future career in his parents’ company had already been laid out for him.  Also that it he continued to snort cocaine in his usual amounts, his nasal septum would eventually perforate and that he’d be better off injecting the drug.”
yours, but the clothes are not.  You haven’t lied to Marfa Hudovna – your grip on the hilt is indeed that of a soldier – but you haven’t told her the entire truth, either.  I know who you are, Ivan Watovich.”
“Then for entertainment while we’re eating, we can review our plans as to how this is going to work.”
The seventeen steps were steeper than John remembered. He’d been using his cane on and off.  More on than off, to be honest.  He should have brought it with him tonight, but he hadn’t wanted to listen to the inevitable commentary it would provoke from Sherlock.
He’d done forty years of a life sentence when the parole board released him into a world that neither knew nor cared who he was. Overnight, he went from being a prison celebrity to being no one at all.
Finding himself suddenly looking down the barrel of a gun, he stopped both moving and speaking.  The rest of the passengers froze as well.  The soldier holding the gun continued to stare at his target, while the rest of the soldiers spread out in a line facing the passengers.  A child started to squall and was hastily shushed.
Sherlock’s look of approval was rather appalling to anyone who realized he hadn’t the least idea as to
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but John touched Sherlock’s shoulder and shook his own head.  Let Stevens have a moment to compose himself.
After a mid-afternoon cuppa used the last of the milk, John decided to combine a constitutional with a trip to Tesco’s. He eschewed the familiar proximity of Regent’s Park in favour of the slightly more ambitious goal of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, finally stopping for a break when he reached the Round Pond, where he took advantage of a vacant bench to watch the swans and geese for awhile.
John slept soundly that night. When he woke in the morning, Sherlock was gone of course. John smiled when he discovered Sherlock in the living room, watching the film from the evening before. What surprised him, however, was that Sherlock paused the film to wish John a good morning.
As John walked the candidate – who’d interviewed wonderfully – towards the outside door of the waiting room at 4:39, an older, grey-haired man with a bushy beard stood up too fast and became dizzy, causing both John and the nurse to rush to assist him. The man apologized charmingly in an accent that suggested Eastern Europe. He was especially gallant towards the nurse and struck up a bit of a conversation with her, which she managed with appropriate professionalism. John was quite pleased.
away as fast as he could with Victor’s cries in his ears?”  The sorcerer settled back and stared at Ivan.  Then his tone changed completely, became light and flippant.  “And after all that, Sherlock didn’t even send a card when Victor died!  The man has no heart at all.  Of course, that was
no sorcerer, learning magic through careful study.  His magic was innate, rising from the very core of his being.  And the last thing he had used it for was to buy Ivan time to escape.  Sherlock
“I’ve never heard you complain,” Sherlock retorted. And then as John ran a finger down the pouch slit, “Ahhh! You could... feel inside. If you wanted to.”
John met with Lestrade at 221B the next day. Mycroft had contributed the location of two more boltholes – the blind greenhouse in Kew Gardens and the leaning tomb in Hampstead Cemetery – but nothing had panned out so far. Mrs Hudson had suggested looking behind the clock face of Big Ben and become a big indignant when John refused to take this seriously.
The black-purple colour of the eastern sky, the strains of rising birdsong were all as they had been the day before.  Despite the half-light, Ivan had no trouble making out the path, as it was lined with white stones.  As promised, it led to a grove of tall, white birch trees.  No one else appeared to be there, so Ivan settled down against a tree to wait.  He’d already scanned the trees around him several times for signs that someone was approaching when he happened to glance upwards – and froze.  A huge, dark shape perched high in a tree only yards from where Ivan sat.  It looked like nothing so much as a gigantic bird, a bird the size of a man.
“Of course, that morning,” Sherlock replied archly.  “If other possibilities come to mind, then you’re confusing me with someone else.”
“Well, it’s your basic keep.  Tall stone walls, narrow windows.  Two towers, one to the north, one to the south, each with battlements on top.”
“Okay, great. Thanks for this... Yes, please, before he self-combusts. Ta!” John hung up and handed Sherlock back the phone. “He’s texting you the...”
“It’s not your fault, Mum. It’s the ambulance people’s, for not getting there fast enough.  And... it’s mine, too.  If I could’ve figured out better what to do, with the poker or Uncle Don’s meds or going to the university or, really,
In the ensuing melee, Sherlock discovered that George was indeed easier to throw than Mary. The problem turned out to be keeping him down once he hit the floor. By the time John had disabled Minnie, George was sitting on top of Sherlock with his hands around Sherlock’s throat. John had hoped that the sound of gunfire might cause the neighbours to call the police. He hadn’t quite counted on having the police burst in just in time to see him clock George with Minnie’s gun.
Any protestations Ivan might have made were swept away by the wind.  As the tsarevich, he had had the opportunity to ride the finest, fastest horses, but Sherlock’s powerful wings carried them high above the forest at a speed far greater than any horse could have managed.  They flew so fast that the sun rose in the sky twice as rapidly as usual, for they were flying to meet it.
He picked up a marker and wrote something on the board, the same as what Mr Holmes wrote.  Then he started
“That also is true.”  Sherlock met Ivan’s gaze directly, silver eyes bright beneath the black plumes of his crest.  “Completely so.  Ivan Watovich, I must go, and if I leave you here, you will not survive.”  Ivan knew it.  The corridors were already noticeably hotter, and he could hear the sounds of falling masonry in the distance.
“But not yet, we need to wait until after dark.”  Sherlock began walking again.  Willy-nilly, John followed.
This, of course, immediately sent all three inspectors heading into the bedroom – and away from the refrigerator with the livers in it.
Fine, thought John.  I didn’t want to stay in this ugly building anyway.  I’ll find a hotel in the city.
point regarding Ms Caustlin’s level of danger still stands.  However,” and here Sherlock paused, turned slightly away, looked almost...  Awkward?  “We’re on our way to the Yard.  Lestrade will have got her number for the case, so I should be able to retrieve it for you.”
Caustlin seemed a bit puzzled by the sudden change in subject, and she wasn’t the only one. “Uh, no.  I didn’t.  That didn’t occur to me.”
“And is there a way to tell if someone else has listened to a message before you yourself have done so?”
“Very funny. Seriously, though, it’s been almost two weeks since the shooting and no one’s made an attempt on Sherlock’s life.”
Ivan selected the black feather, but when he would have handed it to Sherlock, Sherlock shook his head.  “I said that
Watching Molly’s face was like watching a building collapse.  Not a grand building but a small, well-made, pretty one.  Then she visibly pulled herself together – hmmm, thought John, tougher than she looks at first – and replied, “Certainly.  I’ll get them.”
.  I was wrong.  It was just same, except with even more opportunities for me to demonstrate my freakishness.”
“Ah, hello,” she said, a bit hesitantly. Nice voice, a bit high.  “I hope you don’t think I’m pushy, but...”
He thought Sherlock might dance with Mary’s meg-of-honour – Jenny? No, Janine. She and Sherlock had seemed to be getting along, earlier. But when John looked around after a bit, he saw Janine dancing with an alpha with light brown hair and glasses, no third partner in sight. He searched the crowd further and spotted Molly and Tom dancing with Mrs Hudson – who had some astonishing moves for an omega her age – but there was no sign of Sherlock.
Dixon brightened a little. “That makes this easier. I’ll give you a summary now and make sure you get a copy of the full surgical report, okay?”
The upside of Sherlock’s abandonment was that Sherlock was going to have to pay his own cab fare.  It was three miles from St Bar... the Cromwell to Baker Street.  John could walk as long as his leg would stand for it and begin reacquainting himself with London, then hail one of those amateur cabs.  And he should pick up some groceries, although Sherlock was going to have to do something with the head in the refrigerator.
the tsarevich, at least for the time it took to ride out of sight and earshot of the capital’s western gate.
Christ. It was as good as a marriage vow – except that it ran only one way, from Sherlock to John and Mary. It was as if Sherlock thought that he had no right to expect or even ask anything from them in return. Then and there, John made a quiet vow of his own. Somehow, he’d make his friend understand just how wrong he was.
“You know what?  I’m not going to argue with you.  I’m just going to wait until you fall asleep sitting there and then
“Yes.  Muircheartaigh spoke truly, you know.  I did escape with Victor’s cries in my ears.  Victor was yelling for me to save myself and flee.  I would have ignored him if I could have thought of any way to save both of us, but I couldn’t, not at the time.  Later on...”
Something in John decided that wasn’t fine at all. He’d pulled Sherlock back and begun returning the kiss before he even thought about it. By the time he
And the memory had stayed with Sherlock for 14 years.  A boy on the verge of puberty had seen, probably for the first time, a man experiencing sexual pleasure – and remembered.  John no longer felt embarrassed.  He felt... humbled.  Less important than the memory itself, for all that Sherlock now looked to him to explain it.
“I do well enough, dear.  Friends like Mariya Tobyevna send me gifts.”  Then she looked thoughtful.  “But some things
“No. Seeing him in his element.”  Her voice took on an unexpectedly wistful note.  “Seeing him shine.”
“It won’t show the man leaving,” called Sherlock from the rear of the alley. “Look at this.  Dirt from the alley floor on top of the bin, probably left there by footwear.  Scuff marks on the boards near the top of the fence and I think...”  Sherlock fished a pair of tweezers and a plastic bag out of his coat pocket.  “Yes!  Denim fibres caught in the top of the fence as he went over.”
“And we’ll tell it, John and I. When it’s grown. When it can make decisions as an adult. When it’s ready to read your pen drive.”
But Wiggins stared back at him calmly enough. “’E looked like ‘e was thinkin’ abou’ it. But then ’e said – ‘No, me blogger would objeck.’ Tha’s what ‘e said.” He stumbled a bit as John let go of him.
“...concerns me. Sorry, what? Your... Sherlock.” The grin John felt stretching across his face was echoed by the bloom of warmth in his heart.
John raised his head. “I’ll be rubbish at parenting too. But each of us will make different kinds of mistakes. Things might balance out okay.”
“According to everything I’ve read,” Sherlock observed, “It’s your uterus that should be doing the work, not the child. Are you sure your uterus hasn’t gone to sleep?”
“Oh?” said John. And then had to swallow back all of ten different things he thought of saying next.
But it had been John who pointed out the obvious.  “She could have left Sherrinford at any time, gone anywhere in the world and remained undetected for as long as she wished.  Instead she left long enough to get Sherlock’s attention, then returned to wait for him.  As long as Sherlock keeps coming to visit, why is she going to leave?”
“Of course, how many others were involved? Who killed him? Janine, working with Mary? Mary, working with Janine? Or was
my family out for a case of untreated anaphylaxis. Find out who the deceased’s GP was, get a list of known allergies and compare it to her stomach contents. She tried a new place today for her mid-morning latte and scone. Either she forgot to ask about ingredients – which is unlikely, she was attentive to her own medical issues to the point of hypochondria – or the server failed to give her complete information. In any event,
In fact, Sherlock was still a bit tense, but John ignored that as he kissed Sherlock’s neck and ran his hands down his chest. Sherlock’s secondary nipples – vestigial on a male beta – rose into tight buds at John’s touch. Sherlock himself arched a bit, then relaxed.
Ivan plucked the feather free.  If Sherlock flinched at this moment – and he did, just a bit – it would appear to be in response to Muircheartaigh’s accusation.  Working quickly, Ivan held the case against his body with one arm while he placed the feather between the index and ring finger of his other hand.  Then he poised that hand over the heart he knew to be Muircheartaigh’s.  He would only get one chance at this.
“That’s not true,” retorted Mary. “I specifically asked John if he thought Molly Hooper might be interested. John can verify that.”
Smoky McPherson was an old man now and his hands were shaky, but in his prime he’d been the go-to guy for tattoos not just in his own cellblock but in the entire prison. Transferees from other prisons thanked their luck for the opportunity to get a tattoo from Smoky.
“I’ll take your word on that. Anyway, Tim – the artist – he’s working up a band-based collection of designs.  Some to hide it or at least de-emphasize it, others to kind of take it and make, ah, a new statement.”
“And now you’ve had an extremely complete version of the explanation I promised you.  Marfa Hudovna has gone to prepare a bed for you.” Ivan looked about, surprised that the lady was indeed gone from the room, as Sherlock continued speaking.  “Good night, Ivan Watovich.”
However, there were others at court who were not pleased at the prospect that a foreigner should one day rise to be tsaritsa.  It was all too easy for them to provide the tsarevna with merry companions who encouraged her in continuing to drink.  They openly mocked Clara’s attempts at persuasion and suggested that only a fool would be moved by them.  Meanwhile, a series of poor harvests had exposed flaws in the trade treaty that had been part of the marriage negotiations.  Clara’s detractors were quick to advertise these.
should have been fine.  However, despite Sherlock’s assertions to the contrary, John was both reasonably intelligent and reasonably observant.  He knew Sherlock’s methods.  He’d heard the questions Sherlock had asked Tyler Caustlin, he’d seen the look Sherlock had traded with Lestrade and he’d heard the question Lestrade had asked.  He’d drawn his own conclusions – and now he found himself unable to put them out of his mind.
“Then you definitely don’t want that one. One, it’s poorly constructed. It won’t last a year. Two, it’s poorly designed. You’ll never use most of the features simply because they’re a pain in the arse to access.”
Ivan checked the sack and distributed more food: bread and apples, along with a pot of soft cheese.  When Sara thanked him for it, he shrugged.  “We’re all in this together.  I’ve got a sackful of food and a sword.  Someone else obviously has a knack for building campfires.”
“We have a report of familial inflation,” proclaimed one of the men, a gangly fellow who was apparently trying to camouflage his weasel-like face with a bushy moustache.  Two burlier men pushed past John and Sherlock and began to poke at things around the flat.
He landed with barely a stumble and looked up at the tower to see – nothing but stone and flames.  “Sherlock!” he yelled.  “Sherlock, you idiot, I’m clear!  Get out of there!”
, I’d wait for you to come to me.”  She had a low, pleasant voice.  “But I’ve got an early flight tomorrow morning, so I’m calling it an evening.  This is for when I get back” – when she leaned forward to tuck a bit of paper in his shirt pocket, John got quite the view – “in two weeks.
The beautiful stranger stepped aside and gestured more or less in the direction of the sofa.  The room was a bit of a tip, with piles of paper strewn everywhere.  There was a bison skull wearing headphones hanging from one wall and another skull, human, on the mantelpiece.
“There’s a first time for everything, I suppose. I’m used to us being taken for a couple.  Just not... a couple of widowers.”
“Were companions rather than soulmates and have nothing to do with the case. Besides Foucault's marriage, I haven’t been able to find mention of any other relationships that aren’t strictly professional – as is, for example, his relationship with Campbell-Williams”
“John Watson... Oh, hi, Steve!... Sorry, she what?... No, she didn’t... I see... Okay, right. Yes. Fine... I’ll take care of it... Yes, I understand. Ah, by the end of next week?... Great. Thanks, Steve.”
“No.  I’m attracted to women more often than men, but with men the attraction is somehow... deeper?  That’s not quite it.  More visceral, maybe.”
“Someone murdered the lord?” asked Svinarnikov.  It struck Ivan that neither Svinarnikov nor Sara Dmitrievna appeared to have heard this tale before.
Pauline Antonelli stood behind the counter of her pub, glaring at Sherlock.  John was surprised to realize how many names he didn’t recognize in the line of beer taps behind her.  What, for example, was W&T Bitter?
John approached and sniffed. Still Mary, still lemon tarts and orange blossoms, but there was something new, something mixed in. Something very much like... gun steel and musk.
“For 0.69 seconds. She came to see me in the hospital after the story hit the tabloids. She called me a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard.”
Finally, Ivan described his father’s desperation that one of his children should marry and carry on the family name.  It was quite the moving account, if he said so himself.
“And religious figures – priests, ministers, rabbis, that sort of thing.  The hospital chaplain and I got to talking about it one slow night in the ER when I was doing my residency.  Jam...”
each other.  I loved her, Johnny.  I never meant to hurt her, and by the end I was doing nothing but.”
John ran forward to grab Sherlock’s arm, hardly aware of Mary doing the same on the other side, hardly aware that he himself was speaking, almost chanting. “Come on, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.”
?  It’s no good, you know.  I may have to rush off and deal with whatever little distraction you’ve arranged, but I
John had one hand firmly planted across Sherlock’s mouth and the other holding Sherlock’s arm behind his back, with Sherlock’s free arm pinned between them. Sherlock first tried to twist away and then tried to kick him.
“Anderson won’t work with me.”  That was definitely Sherlock’s voice, becoming a bit clearer as the two men walked down the stairs.
His frown morphed into a pleased smile, and John found himself smiling back.  No, wait.  This wasn’t something to smile about.
Campbell-Williams snorted again. “Not unless you’d ever met David.  He’s not the threatening type.  But to answer your question, yes.  He’d just published his one and only best-seller, although of course we didn’t know that then.  There was talk of movie rights.  He was... confident.  And charming.  One of the few men I’d met who wasn’t intimidated by my intelligence.  I’m sure you’re familiar with the problem yourself, Mr Holmes?”
John called Mary while the nurses were getting Sherlock settled in his room. They’d already offered John a cot in case he wanted to spend what remained of the night, and Mary agreed with him that he should.
At the palace, the tsar stood waiting to greet his son, looking old and worn.  He had yet more bad news: the Prinzessin Clara had returned to her own country and had her marriage annulled.
He sat for a while, thinking on what he’d seen.  Finally he rose and went down to the kitchen, where he found Marfa Hudovna bustling about.  As she served him kasha and tea for breakfast, Ivan made a point of wondering out loud how she managed on her own in the middle of forest.  But she only laughed.
John had left his own cell phone behind in Canada with Bill because he’d been told it wouldn’t work in the UBR – something about different signal encoding.   Now he wondered if that had been a mistake.
door, stood up and produced a gun, only to have John twist his wrist sharply and remove the gun from him as the Yarders surrounded the cab.
“Mmmm, he may bear further evaluation,” said Sherlock. He propped himself up on one arm, carding the fingers of his other hand through John’s hair.
“In amarsupials, the chorioallantoic placenta develops further into a sort of filter that directly connects the mother’s bloodstream with the child’s.”
“You hit me,” whined a man.  Ivan whirled around to see one of the former slaves, his nose too large – and at the moment, bleeding profusely – in his thin face.
Mrs Hudson set the freshly refilled teapot down between them with a clunk.  “But the short answer is that yes, they are.  More toast, John?”
Sherlock allowed John to pull him to his feet and then headed off to the bedroom, weaving ever so slightly but graceful despite his fatigue.  John turned out the lights and followed, pausing in the loo to brush his teeth.  By the time he entered the bedroom, Sherlock was already under the covers, lying along the edge of the bed on his left side so that his back would be to John.  His dressing gown lay flung out over the foot of the bed.
“Correct.  In all of the posts the writer references both the past and current occupations of the target.  However, although only Wilson was a jeweller, all the posts mention jewels.  What do you know about the Crown Jewels, John?”
“It does for me. Then again, maybe I’m lucky.  With a name like Lestrade I figure I’ve got at least a bit of French in me, and you know what they say about the French.”  Greg winked, and John laughed.
“John, I sincerely doubt that your wife intended to start her day with a visit to a crack house, followed by a spot of impromptu nursing at St Bart’s. Perhaps you ought to head home and attend to her well-being.”
“Only if you go by the road, dear,” she replied – and winked.  “I have friends in Svyatoy Varfolomeyevsk and spend many a pleasant afternoon there.”
“Yes, to spend a quiet day with his son, son-in-law and granddaughter. I’m afraid that you have us as guests for at least the next nine hours.”
John wasn’t entirely convinced that they’d managed to pull the wool over Mrs Hudson’s eyes. She was now supplying them with more casseroles and baked goods than ever, but she’d stopped bringing her largesse up to the flat. Instead, she waited until she heard John coming in the front door and bestowed it on him.
“What’s the magic word?” John asked as he took his hand away to grab the lube and squeeze some on his fingers.
Afterwards, they wiped each other off as best they could with dew-wet leaves.  When Sherlock would have headed back to the house, Ivan stopped him and pulled the shirt off his own back to tie around Sherlock’s hips.  He laughed at Sherlock’s expression.
“And beta?” Mary finished with a grin. “That’s the best way to find your own match, didn’t you know? Look for one for someone else.”
“What’s that tune you’re humming, mate?” asked Lestrade. He and John were standing by while Sherlock had his way with a corpse.
John recognized that it was entirely possible that Sherlock could simply have placed the patches on other parts of his body. However, he drew the line at expanding his inspections.  Drew it in terms of actions, anyway.  His thoughts developed an alarming tendency to wander across that line on their own, without seeking his permission.
“Yes, dear, I see that,” said Marfa Hudovna.  “That would be why he’s half-naked himself – not that it’s an ill sight to see.”
Sherlock thrust faster then, not as precisely but harder, fiercer, driving them both on. John pushed back against him as they moved together. Always together.
Sherlock arrived barely an hour later.  He had bits of stuff in his hair and on the shoulders of his coat that John preferred not to think about but he was otherwise unharmed, even cheerful.
A few yards away, Sherlock stood up with a look on his face very like Madeleine’s and started to walk towards them. “Looks like storm clouds on both fronts,” said John, trying and failing to interest his daughter in a dummy.
They chose to walk home after their late dinner. The skies had cleared to reveal the first quarter moon. As they neared Baker Street, John pulled Sherlock aside into a detour through Regent’s Park. Despite the chilly air, the deserted park smelled of growing things and the coming spring.
The waiter arrived with their entrées. As he was exchanging one set of plates for another, Campbell-Williams took another sip of wine.  It must have gone down the wrong way, however, for she immediately lifted her napkin to her lips with her free hand and began coughing.  She was still coughing as she tried to set her glass down, which was almost certainly why she clumsily knocked it over onto her bread and butter plate.  Wentworth jumped, but the waiter took it in stride.  Brushing off the couple’s apologies, he removed both the plate and the glass and vanished, presumably to obtain fresh ones.
“You were too agitated to sleep last night. You’ve attempted to cover this up – poorly – with make-up.  Your state of agitation is further betrayed by the fact that you’ve buttoned your blouse crookedly.  You were already headed for work this morning when it occurred to you that Baker Street was more or less on your way, hence your early arrival without a previous call.  If the source of your agitation were work-related, you would have continued on to the lab and dealt with it.  Therefore, personal.  But both your parents are deceased and you have no siblings, children or current attachments.  Therefore, your ex-husband.  Not a letter, I think.  Something more immediate.”
Sherlock was married to his work, but really that was no problem. Every good marriage had three partners.
“Donald McKinsey was only a few years older than I. Over the course of the research project, we became, to some degree, close.  I am not sure I would say close
“Umbrella Man.  The pompous twit who kidnapped me and offered me money to spy on you.  That was your brother.”
Sherlock...was rapt. He looked almost as if he was in his Mind Palace, except that the performers were apparently in there with him.
“A traveller passing through, he said he’d heard of the same happening in other villages, said it was sorcery.  But he also said he’d heard tell of a magical creature who lived far to the east who might be able to help.  Someone had to go, and I was the one chosen.”
“Sherlock.” John waited until Sherlock was actually looking at him, then gently touched Sherlock’s cheek. “If there’s a problem, we tell each other there’s a problem and talk about it. That’s all.”
“Angela – that’s Uncle Don’s caregiver, Angela Desimone – had left two messages on my house phone. One was on Wednesday evening.  She’d been in that day to take care of things, and Don hadn’t been there.”
him not to tell you,” Mary inserted. “There didn’t seem to be much point. I’d, well, played my last card.”
No response from the sofa.  John figured he’d give Sherlock one more day with the livers, then return them to Molly himself.  In the meantime, his own breakfast had not been skimpy.  Between him and Sherlock, they were now out of several items that needed to be restocked.  He could drop Sherlock’s coat and scarf at the dry-cleaners on the way.
Two years. That would have been... Oh. Of course. Sherlock must have travelled through any number of places in the course of unravelling Moriarty’s network. He’d never spoken about any of them. Then again, John had never...
“I did. I exploited a weakness in the security system. Access to those floors of the building was controlled by a private lift called by Magnussen’s key card and
smile. And he thought, why not? Two-person marriages had been legally recognized in England since 1931, even though religious conservatives still grumbled their claims that every child deserved all its parents. Mary was no religious conservative and neither was John. Why shouldn’t he and Mary marry and then see where that took them?
The incision was completely closed now, its purplish-red colour fading rapidly.  Ivan bent to place the feather back into the case, but when he looked up again Sherlock was shaking, vibrating from head to toe with a rapid tremour.
The chamber inside was an amazement of books and scrolls, of strange devices whose purpose Ivan could not guess.  Elaborate hangings embroidered with fantastic scenes covered the walls.  On cabinets and shelves, gemstones winked within cages of gold and silver wire, balanced on stands of ivory and rare woods.  At the centre of the chamber stood a large round table and in the centre of the table, an empty stand.  Whitish powder and fragments of bone lay scattered about its base.
“She got the first point right too,” John inserted. “About me not paying attention to other betas. Or didn’t you ever wonder why I only brought megfriends home, never bettifriends?”
“Boring.  I have a search algorithm that hunts for keywords, not all that different from what the censors use.  Religious groups – other than Anglicans, obviously – often use BritChat to communicate, but they need to avoid words like ‘sin’ and ‘salvation’ if they actually want their posts to appear.  I accidentally had a post banned a few years ago during a case concerning several slaughtered sheep of various ages.”
Sherlock gave him a small smile. “I’d think it would be so blindingly obvious as to be impossible to forget.”
It took them some time to regain any degree of sobriety, as they kept setting each other off, but eventually Ivan wiped his eyes.  “What’s next?”
“I’m fine, John,” replied Sherlock, rubbing the back of his head. “However, Lestrade is about to remind you that Tyler is both a civilian
bloody month – the morning he had to drag Sherlock out of a crack house. John was both relieved and disappointed when Molly hauled off and slapped Sherlock – three times. Sherlock certainly deserved it and god knows John
Sherlock snuffled into his pillow, and John stopped himself from reaching to stroke the dark curls.  The boy John had met 14 years ago had grown into a man, and the man, however gorgeous and brilliant, was married to his work.
Ivan ignored him and lifted the beating heart gingerly from the case.  He wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but the muscle felt warm and firm beneath his fingertips.  He was reminded not so much of the stench and gore of battlefield wounds as of a young animal just born.  A newborn puppy perhaps, not able to survive on its own, requiring gentleness and care.
If only.  If only their father had hung on just seven months longer.  If only John had been 21, not 20 years and five months old.  Sure, he would still have had a couple of years of medical school ahead before his graduation.  But he could have negotiated with his father’s creditors, using the promise of his future salary as a doctor to leverage loan extensions.
“The tests Tyuleneva speaks of?  No, there were no tests.  I was told that Sherlock lived in a house in the forest and that is where I found him, although I had been expecting a man and not some feathered monstrosity.  Nor had I expected that his response to my tale would be to tell me that I’d been cheating on my wife with the murdered clerk and that I was right to suspect that the child she’d miscarried wasn’t mine.  Then the creature sniffed that a simple locked-room murder was hardly even a five and that he was only taking it because he was bored.  Without further warning, he grabbed me and took off into the air!  By the time we landed, I was near dead from both cold and terror.”
“The 16-year-old boy in question was actively planning to resort to theft in order to settle his gambling debts – debts that he accrued by knowingly violating his school’s regulations.”
Smiling to himself, John pulled on a clear pair of jeans. Padding shirtless down the stairs, he noticed that there was something in one of the pockets.  It turned out to be a crumpled and very clean bit of paper that had survived both the washing machine and the dryer.  On his way to the kitchen, he pitched it at Sherlock, lying recumbent on the sofa in pyjamas and dressing gown.  It landed on the detective’s chest.
“You’re not unintelligent, but you don’t see what I see. You listen when I explain, which is more than most people do. But you
The boy’s chin went up.  “I’m fourteen, and you’re an idiot.  You managed to step in a mud puddle just getting from your lodgings to your uncle’s
“And yet completely fails to delineate the supposed vandal’s motives in attacking that particular lab at the university. I grant that you may have part of the story, but there’s more to it.”  Sherlock strode back into the alley.
“No, it’s a theory originally put forward by Goodey and Fossall in 1993 and now widely accepted among evolutionary anthropologists,” retorted Sherlock frostily.
But Mary refused to back down. “No, this never would have happened if you’d managed to come to terms with what Sherlock did for you.”
Mary’s jaw clenched and her eyes glistened, but she did not cry. “A child deserves to know who its birthmother is.”
Foucault sat very straight and spoke very calmly. Only the slight trembling of his hands on the desktop betrayed him.  When he noticed John looking at them, he glanced at them himself, then gave a slight shrug and left them where they were.
Then Sherlock offered him a way through, a way to deal. In this flat, in this room, here and now, Mary was not his wife. She wasn’t the woman who’d lied to him since the day they met.
“You’ll be so huge you won’t be able to see your own cock. I’ll get down between your legs and you won’t be able to see what I’m going to do next. I’ll use my hands and my mouth, I’ll touch you
John came back from (yet another) Tesco run that afternoon to be waylaid (once again) by Mrs Hudson the moment he got in the front door. This time, however, she came bearing a warning rather than food.
John was trying for levity, but Sherlock only stared at him, then shrugged. “We’d have ended up rolling around all over it when you attacked me.”
Sherlock shivered once, hard, head to toe, and then went boneless beneath John. “You could be right.” His voice was slightly rough, and John grinned.
The street was hardly more than an alley itself.  Had it always been this narrow?  And amazingly dark, considering the heat from the sun blazing down.  Ivan looked up to check the position of the sun and found that instead he was looking at a roof of old, moss-grown rock.  The houses were gone too – rock walls closed in on either side of him, and why had he thought it was hot?  The cold, damp air of the tunnel chilled him to the bone.  His bare feet splashed in the puddles on the muddy floor.
They used contraceptives, of course, as they obviously weren’t ready for a child with just the two of them. Still, one morning three weeks after the end of Mary’s heat, John noticed a discarded home pregnancy test in the bathroom bin. Mary was apparently taking no chances. John thought it might be time for the discussion he’d been meaning to have.
Sherlock glanced down at his microscope slides, shrugged, stood up.  “I take it that the university reunion didn’t turn out as you’d hoped.  Put the kettle on, I’ll play for you awhile.”
John put down the newspaper he’d been trying to hide behind. “What I’m thinking... isn’t really any of my business.”
Married to his work, thought John, arranging himself for sleep more comfortably, but sleeping in my bed.
The woman was close to tears. “How did you...  How can you stand there and say...”  She broke off as the bartender approached and slid a tall glass of something cold and clear onto the table in front of her, then retreated.
Sherlock complied.  Ivan started to open the case, then paused.  “Am I worried about stray crossbow bolts?”
“A fluke. The killer had no reason to remove the victim’s shoes and never knew about it. It took your forensics techs to spot the tattoo, jump to conclusions, pull the right shoe off and then mistake a mangled toe for an amputated one.”
“Mary stopped using contraceptives after she shot me. It was a back-up plan. She was still hoping to be able to keep you from finding out what she’d done. However, if you
They found Mrs Hudson waiting for them instead the front door.  She’d heard three different versions of the events of the night before – one each from Marie, Billy and Archie – and was not amused.
“Sitting up, rolling over and doing quite the agile tummy creep. We’re looking for a real crawl any day now,” John reported proudly.
, with stronger desired effects and weaker undesired ones.”  And then he rather primly, “It was a birthday present.”
“Certainly.  The doctor who examined me afterwards didn’t know whether to be horrified or impressed.  Of course, this was partly due to my own acting skills.”
But Toby beamed proudly.  “There are four other girls in my class at school named Octobria!  And Octobria Smith’s mother calls her
“I already know how you take your tea and I’m not offering to get you any at the moment. Who’s Dobrieuzi?”
David blinked.  “Oh.  Then what brings you back to London?  I figured we’d seen the last of you after you ran away from that posh kid Da married you off to.”
, Sherlock the arsehole said, “John’s my husband.  I need to see the samples of the particulate matter you found in the corpses’ nostrils.”
“That’s mine, thanks,” said John, holding out his hand. “Yours is, for some reason, on top of the refrigerator.”
Sherlock wasn’t interested in children, sex or even, as far as John could tell, a bit of a cuddle from time to time. That was a stickier bit to get over.
“Because being the subject of your previous experiments has been so much fun that I’m actually looking forward to one in which you try to recreate the effects on an omega in heat on my cock.”
.  Mycroft dealt with Victor’s family and sent a car to take me back to our family’s home.  He didn’t attend to the matter himself, though.  I was able to slip away while his henchmen were packing up my room.”
that the first thing he would do on arriving in your house would be to set up a laboratory – and that he’d persuade you to let him!”
Over the weeks that followed, Mary and Sherlock got along amazingly well despite the fact that Mary was confined to the flat. Sherlock, who could and did leave on occasion, spent as much time as he could there so that he and Mary would be exposed to each other’s pheromones. John would have expected outbreaks of terminal boredom and mutual loathing. Instead, Mary steadily worked her way through Sherlock’s collection of literature on famous crimes and criminals, critiquing them professionally as she went. Sherlock undertook a crash course in human reproduction and all things related. Both seemed equally fascinated by the prospect of keeping bees on the roof.
Sherlock’s idea of “making camp” appeared to consist of depositing Ivan at the bottom of a tree before flying up to perch on one of the lower branches.  When no further action appeared to be forthcoming, Ivan asked, “Is it safe to make a small fire?”
“Anyway. You’re right! About not having a dogfight, I mean. I respect that, and I, ah, respect you. I always have. And I’ve been thinking about you, can’t stop really, and. Well. I was wondering.”
And that’s you told, thought John ruefully as he finished putting the groceries away.  Probably just as well.  Sherlock was brilliant and gorgeous, but at heart he was the same brat John had met 14 years ago.
The answer was perched on top of the fence, offering John his only way out.  He took a deep breath and a running start of his own and managed to grab Sherlock’s hand in both his.  Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulder – his right one, fortunately – and hauled.  John pushed with his feet against the rough wood, and they both went over.  John thought he felt someone grab at his shoe as he did so, but he hit the ground still wearing both shoes, so that was all right.  He scrambled back up to his feet and
“Unlikely.  The hilt’s too plain to suit the taste of the sort of rich dandy who’d be fool enough to wager a sword like that...”
“Lestrade’s not involved. The shop owner called me directly, believing – correctly – that I’d be more effective than the police in locating the thief.  And your assessment of the case is correct, but the shop owner is... an acquaintance of mine.”
“No. Not like them.”  Sherlock grimaced and started to pull back.  Unthinking, John placed a hand on his sleeve to keep him close.
“Your father wants a princess, but what do you want?  Fair to look at, everyone wants that whether in a wife
. Not yet, because as long as my marriage to Mary still holds, she’d have to agree to marry you too. But in two years I can file for divorce on grounds of desertion and then I’ll be...”
“My first marriage,” Marie explained.  She was an attractive woman, perhaps a few years older than John and built on a more generous scale than her petite aunt.  “And you and Sherlock are... married?”
Sherlock frowned and shook his head as, “I still think they’re running a drug lab,” floated back up the stairs.  Finally John heard the front door slam shut.
Sherlock lifted the tape and ducked under it.  “Always, Sally.” He breathed in through his nose.  “I even know you didn’t make it home last night.”
John managed to stifle a laugh, but he couldn’t keep from smiling, and Dexter flushed. “Sorry, that didn’t come out right. I mean, you seem very confident, and I’m... not. But I’m working on that. I’m, ah, I’m actually meeting a beta-omega couple for dinner. I met them at FACTS in September.”
“Mmm, and since yesterday he’s taken you to a crime scene and introduced you to all of his acquaintances.”
Chuckling softly, John laid a hand on Sherlock’s arm, glancing down the bar as he did so to make sure that Pauline was out of earshot.  “That’s amazing, love.  Sherlock, this is my cousin, David Watson.  You met his father at our wedding.  David, my husband, Sherlock Holmes.”
“You mean the truth about Mary. Sherlock, I don’t blame you for that. It’s just... You can’t keep doing things like this without trusting me enough to let me know what’s going on.”
, a piano fitted with a mechanism that extended its available registers. In particular, such a piano was capable of producing a register that sounded something like a cimbalom, a type of hammered dulcimer that was considered to be typical of Romani music.”
The first thing that caught John’s eye as they left the building was the café across the street. “Breakfast,” he said, attempting to lead Sherlock in that direction.
“And the fact that said senior was apparently on his way home from a spot of vandalism at the university?”
“Something,” agreed John.  He looked down and realized he was turning his now-empty tea cup back and forth in his hands.  He set it down.  “And then I told you I’d been assigned to stay here, you put that together with ‘soldier’ and knew who I was, eh?”
John woke in the night to hear Sherlock playing his violin, not any particular melody but rather long sequences of notes that sometimes drifted, sometimes darted about as if reflecting the player’s thoughts. Sherlock drank tea when John made it, disdained toast despite the fact that John had made it and grudgingly allowed John to inspect his arms, which never bore more than two nicotine patches between them.
protect you, John.”  The sudden, intent ferocity in Sherlock’s voice made John shiver.  “Afterwards you would have met Mary and... found comfort with her.”
“...on a dead man who suffered from dementia and a 16-year-old boy trying to deal with a situation he never should have been left with.”
“I want a shower first.  My hair...”  Sherlock divested himself of his coat and scarf.  He frowned as he examined them.  “These will need to go to the dry-cleaners.”
The smile vanished.  “Don’t be an idiot,” Sherlock snapped.  “I can’t escape him – or his ‘favours.’  That doesn’t mean I trust him.  And the fact that he approves of you as my... companion doesn’t mean
“I told him that!” the teen protested. “But he said he could as long as he didn’t mix it with his meds!”
John, looking expectantly towards the door of the house, didn’t immediately notice as the sulky and reluctant boy approached.
Sherlock put his own menu down onto the table.  “If Angelo finds out that you’re my husband just returned after 14 years away, he’s either going to organize an impromptu anniversary feast or take you out back and knock you around with a frying pan for being gone so long.  Actually, he might knock you around first and
surprised. I merely hid it well.” Mary seemed to have regained some composure. “Understanding human emotions isn’t your area, Sherlock.”
Morning brought heavy fog, a sack of rye flour, a second sack of food for the journey and directions.
At first sight, the body proved to be something of an anticlimax despite the missing right hand. Lestrade’s assessment of the age of the amputation had been correct.  John thought the amputation was clean enough to have been surgical rather than accidental, but he couldn’t be sure.
“Actually, your testimony agrees with the information I’ve received from the university. They’ve been unable to identify any specific item as missing.  Everything is accounted for by the debris your granduncle left behind in the lab.  Lestrade, you’d have a difficult time proving burglary.”
And then Sherlock’s mobile rang. Sherlock, who could ignore his mobile for hours on end, leapt up from the sofa, grabbed his mobile and, talking, went into his bedroom and shut the door behind him.
“I’d like to tell him where to stick it!  I’ve got some scones for you, dear, once these louts are gone.  I’m not chancing them putting their greasy paws on my baking, it’s too good for them.”  She went back down the stairs.
John decided it was time for a change of subject. “Where’s Bill Wiggins spending the holiday? Mrs Hudson’s going to her sister’s, so he won’t be able to mooch on her.”
John interrupted, stepping forward.  “Dr Hooper?  Dr John Watson.”  He extended a hand, which she took gingerly.  “Sherlock speaks highly of your work.”
Two days later, John came downstairs for his morning tea and found Sherlock asleep on the sofa, a bit grimy but otherwise no worse for wear.
.  So, you’re getting a divorce, you’re getting a tattoo, you’ve been dating other women all along and plan to keep doing so.  Anything else?”
you because you’re a good person. Not that you can’t also be a royal pain in the arse, but... Greg likes you.
“Did the paramedics happen to catch a glimpse of the younger man leaving the alley?” John asked Lestrade.
The criminal holiday persisted for more than a week. John binned the feet (three right, two left, none from the same body) when the refrigerator began to smell.  Sherlock sulked, vanished and reappeared two days later with a dead crocodile.  He carried it into his bedroom and slammed the door behind him.  The crocodile had already been mummified, so John decided not to argue.
“The officers didn’t get a good look at their faces.  However, an officer managed to get hold of the shorter one’s shoe as he went over the fence.”
“A good summary of my current hypothesis. On my advice, Campbell-Williams is meeting Wentworth for dinner tomorrow evening.”
Mary looked up from where she’d been nuzzling John’s sweaty neck. “Of course I do. He’s not only my husband’s best friend, he’s also intelligent and never dull, plus he’s easy on the eyes. Mind, he hasn’t the first idea as to how human beings tick emotionally, but no one’s perfect.”
“Yeah. He’d stop ranting and listen and answer, pretty sensibly too.  So that was all right and I thought we were going to make it through until Mum got back.  And then...”  Tyler stopped.
“And you haven’t. Campbell-Williams’ field of study rarely involves human subjects or really, any living subjects at all.  It’s possible that she didn’t understand the complications involved.  The remarks were made once, at a reception.  She may or may not have ingested some unknown amount of alcohol before making them.  However, they were picked up by the local popular press because unlike like most of what transpired at the conference, they were understandable by and interesting to the general public.”
“You had an urgent need for your dress uniform. Right. I take it back, John,” Mary snarled. “You’re not honest at all. You’re a coward who didn’t even have the guts to tell me you were moving out.”
“He followed you here for the sole purpose of helping you gain what you were after.  You ran away and left him behind, calling your name.
One guard was dead, another blinded.  The remaining guards were slow and clumsy.  There was no question that Ivan was the better swordsman, and he’d taken up a position with the wall at his back.  But there were still five guards left.  Ivan knew that the only real question was how many he could kill or cripple before he passed out from loss of blood.
“We were arguing about it when the gates opened anyway, with the guards ranged in a row just inside.  The freak said that it was a trick, but I know a chance when I see one.  I attacked and took out two guards, got through the line and ran like hell towards the keep.  I thought even a freak would have enough guts to follow once I’d cut us an opening, but I was wrong.  I glanced around, saw I was alone, and then I tripped.  Or something.  I...  I don’t remember.  After that...  There’s a lot I don’t remember.”
The guards had been nothing more than animated wood.  The spell which had given them a sort of life had now been broken.  Sherlock’s work, Ivan guessed.  But the alarm meant that Sherlock had also caught Muircheartaigh’s attention and would need help.  Ivan started towards the keep, only to stumble again and almost fall, his vision darkening even further.  He bent forward and braced his hands against his thighs, feeling dizzy and weak.  This might, he realized, be the end.
Finally they made it inside the reception hall. Sherlock’s best man’s speech got off to an awkward start and looked to be following the same doomed path as his stag-night plans. In the end, however, Sherlock solved two cases, prevented James Sholto’s death and ensured the arrest of a two-time attempted murderer.
“I won’t be left at home to raise it by myself, John. And I’ll probably be rubbish at parenting. But I want to try to help you raise it.”
Mr Holmes grinned back. “Not as physically active as Sherlock. We leave that sort of thing to you younger folk.” He sipped his punch. “I could never bear to argue with her. I’m something of a moron myself. But she’s ...” – he glanced towards the kitchen, then lowered his voice slightly – “...unbelievably hot!”
“I wasn’t on holiday, John. I was working. And it was hardly the first time I’d had to break in somewhere I wasn’t wanted – ‘on my own,’ as you put it. Is this relevant to your original question?”
“Off by three centuries, but your knowledge of history is hardly worse than the Committee’s.  They’ve adopted both Tyler and Cromwell as revolutionary forbears.  Can’t have people think they’ve imported the concept of republicanism wholesale from the French.”
“We’re interviewing our best candidate this afternoon,” John mentioned casually over breakfast as Sherlock sipped his tea and ignored his toast. “The interview should be over at about 4:30, 4:45, so I’ll have time to pick up some shopping after. Do we need anything besides milk and bread?”
“That Mary Morstan’s past would eventually catch up with her? Do you honestly think her former associates – let alone the associates of her former victims – would be deterred by the presence of a small child?  The one saving grace of this situation is that there’s
John turned to find Dexter smiling at him. “Hi, Dr Watson, uh, John. It’s Dexter? Sherlock’s, uh, well, Sherlock’s ex, I suppose.”
Ivan Watovich had been with the imperial forces for five years when one day, a crow flew into the tent where he and his men sat breaking their fast.  A young soldier named Wigginsky chased the crow out, but it flew back in.  One of the sergeants, Uilleam an t-Moireach, got to his feet and chased the crow out a second time, but again it flew back in.  It landed among the maps spread out on the table before the tsarevich and began to peck at them.  At this, Ivan himself got to his feet and chased the crow out of the tent.  As he waved his arms to drive the bird away, the crow circled his head three times, cawing loudly.  Finally it flew away.
It was only when Sherlock stared at him that John heard, in his own words, the absolute and unflinching declaration of allegiance.
“About 10:30, 10:40? Sherlock had said that the meeting was at eleven, but I remember thinking that the client had shown up early.”
Sherlock shuddered visibly. “No.  I think that John may have.”  He appeared not to notice John’s glare.
The truth was that the last time he’d felt so alive was when he’d made a leap for the fence behind Wilson’s, caught Sherlock’s hand and gone running down the alleys and streets.  The last time before that... was a long time ago.
“Tyler, look at me,” said Miranda. “Were you asking Uncle Don about labs in order to find out more about what to steal?’
“You did. Wait, stop a moment.” Sherlock looked quickly up and down the street. Then he swung both his arms to the left, took a deep breath, rose onto his left foot and did a full-circle pirouette.
She turned and walked away. She’d been holding her gun the entire time. John heard a door slam. The spare bedroom, it sounded like.
John sat down absent-mindedly as names came to mind. Himself. Mary. Lestrade, Mrs Hudson. Molly perhaps. He tried and failed to imagine Molly Hooper, however pissed off, aiming a gun at Sherlock’s heart and pulling the trigger. He shifted in his seat – wait, what was he sitting on?
He wasn’t that man anymore.  The idea of picking up a partner for the night no longer appealed.  The idea of Sherlock appealed... all too well, given that Sherlock had said clearly he wasn’t interested.
John stared. Sherlock met his gaze. John was the first to look away – and towards Mary. “We need privacy to discuss this.
The coffee was indeed decent, and the conversation reasonably pleasant.  John fielded several political-sounding questions from Newbold with bland generalities, appealing to his recent arrival when he was unsure how to reply.  Mike kept nodding encouragingly, and Newbold eventually declared himself satisfied.
It was indeed Janine, wearing a shirt but apparently little else. Janine, calling Mycroft “Mike” and Sherlock “Sherl”, telling John where to find the coffee in the flat he’d once lived in. Janine, slipping into the bathroom to join Sherlock and obviously quite welcome.
As John hesitated, Marie placed a possessive hand on his elbow.  “John hasn’t finished his breakfast.”
“About the divorce laws and the protests and stuff. Especially when they interviewed protestors and the protestors started in against science and scientists.”
Left alone beside the fire, Ivan stared into the flames, trying to balance trust and risk.  He was almost glad of the distraction when his belly growled, although they had no food and it would be useless to try hunting for small game in the dark.  He remembered Marfa Hudovna’s cooking a bit wistfully – and then thought of the sack she had given him.  It still hung from his belt, apparently empty.
By Ivan’s reckoning they came to the road a fortnight after escaping Muircheartaigh’s castle.  By then they had taken to calling the widow and the madwoman Bezmolva and Bezumtsa respectively.  The two were always together.  In each other’s company, Bezumtsa seemed just a bit more calm and Bezmolva, just a bit less sad.
After the first couple of nights, John took it upon himself to change the sheets on his old bed at Baker Street. He went back to the flat he’d shared with Mary for a few more of his things.  Nothing more than he’d need for a week.  He
“His subsequent books were complete flops. It was as if he’d written the one story he had in him.  Meanwhile, my own career was getting on nicely for reasons that had everything to do with my own hard work and nothing to do with him.  He became rather less supportive of me, and I, well, I wasn’t very good at being supportive of him.  I did
“Tyler...” began Lestrade, but Sherlock shifted slightly. John caught the quick furrow of his brows and the infinitesimal shake of his head.  Apparently Lestrade did too.  “Ms Caustlin, we’ll want to ask Tyler a few questions later, but for now, did he have anything unusual to report?”
Shaking his head at himself, Ivan opened the case to place the crimson feather with its fellows.  Inside the case lay the other three feathers.  And a red, steadily beating heart.  Sherlock’s heart.  Alive.
“No, I want someone who knows more about tattooing than I do to compare them. And since we’re already going to be doing the rounds of artists who operate in less standard venues than the police will be checking, we’d might as well get an informed opinion while we’re at it.”
John had barely got used to Sherlock luring him to bed (or vice versa) for sex. Hearing Sherlock’s words now made his heart feel almost painfully full.
“You can’t afford to,” was Sherlock’s cool reply. “The damages total more than £20,000” – Miranda gasped – “and you’re not that well off.  If you were, you would have hired a caregiver for your uncle seven days a week instead of three.  You took the trip to Spain because you won it in an office pool and you haven’t been able to afford a holiday in years.  That’s why you felt you needed to take advantage of the chance now, despite your misgivings about leaving both Tyler and your uncle on their own.”
“I called 999. The lady kept telling me to stay on the phone, that help was coming.  She asked me if I knew how to do compresses, but I didn’t and she said it was more important to stay on the phone anyway.  Uncle Don...  He was panting and grabbing at his chest and sweat was just
She kicked the coin towards Sherlock, making him bend to pick it up. When he straightened up holding it and spoke, John could hear the pain in his voice.
John stared at his room. There were... boxes.  Not all that many, and on investigation they appeared to contain nothing more dangerous than the remainder of John’s things.  But they had definitely not been there when he’d left Baker Street for work that morning.
“I don’t recall thinking about them much before then, either,” retorted Sherlock.  His eyes roamed Ivan’s upper body, settling on the left shoulder.
interested in finding a beta? Did you ever intend to have children at all? Or were you planning to let the years pass and then blame bad luck? Certainly you were only driven to try to conceive when you realized that a pregnancy might be your last chance to hang on to John.”
But Sherlock’s pouch slit... No mere line this but rather two distinct lips, both glistening slightly in a way that made their rosy brown colour glow. John reached out to touch, watching Sherlock’s face carefully. Sherlock, propped up on his elbows, watched as well – not John’s face, but his hands. When John’s fingers began to stroke the slit, Sherlock’s mouth opened in a soundless “o.” He seemed entranced.
“None of this has any impact on you. It all happened years ago.  And yet you care about it.  You ask questions, you listen to the answers.”
“Do you know what the characters mean?” asked Ivan, watching the black-feathered head bent over the stick.
Sherlock smirked. “You should know. You were there. Remember the Sumatra Road Underground station? The Tube carriage wired to be a bomb?”
Within the moist warmth of the pouch, Sherlock’s teats were noticeably larger. They must have grown gradually over time. How had John not noticed?
they’d been happy together.  The same had been true for most of his childhood friends.  There’d been a few notable exceptions.  One boy’s parents seemed to spend all their time yelling at each other.  One girl’s father spent long periods away from home, and her mother always looked sad.  But generally marrying their soulmates seemed to work out for most people.
Sherlock smiled then, genuine and warm in a way that made John feel a bit giddy. He got hold of himself and continued.  “I meant the bit about my ‘societally-endorsed objection with colour change.’”
Thus began one of the happiest periods in the young tsarevich’s life.  Often bored at court, he found new purpose amidst the dust and blood of the battlefield.  He learned quickly that there is little glory to be found there, but he had never yearned for glory.  Rather, his heart and spirit were nourished by the camaraderie of the troops, where men fought side by side and spurred each other on to greater acts of courage.  Captain Ivan Watovich became known as an officer who took good care of his men and who would never ask them to do anything he would not do himself.  They followed him into battle with high hearts.
“Yeah, it should be compatible. Ah, I noted the use of the passive tense. Do you need a hand? I’ve got time.”
, but Sherlock would be wrong. John had observed. He just hadn’t allowed himself to think what his observations meant.
After a moment of silence, Clipboard Man repeated, “Abrams, Atkinson, Barton, Brennan, Catherwood, Charles, Cole.  Please board the Newcastle bus.”
Then he had to swallow, hard, but Sherlock didn’t seem to notice.  “You spent eight years in Canada under the impression that you’d be there for the rest of your life.  You experience physical attraction to other people under the right circumstances...”
“No, having come this far we’d might as well see it through. At least I can show you off when we get there.”
“Even before that the system was self-balancing to some degree, since secondary gender isn’t settled until puberty. In family groups with large numbers of children, large numbers of alpha/omega individuals and/or scarce resources, a higher proportion of adolescents will present as betas. Under the opposite conditions, a higher proportion will present as alphas or omegas, depending on their primary gender.”
At the door, Sherlock turned. He’d obviously recovered a bit because his tone was definitely teasing as he purred, “John, I’ve had a lovely evening.” Then he slipped inside and shut the door behind himself.
John pulled a chair forward and sat down at the bedside. “You’re right, of course. She also provided breakfast to Bill Wiggins. My wife saw fit to wrap my gun in a couple of shirts and hand it off to a homeless crack addict to carry across London.”
She held it up to show John a blurry profile shot of Dexter, obviously caught trying to escape the photographer. “He’s not the type to welcome this sort of attention. Janine’s going to lose him over this. Whatever she was paid, I hope it was worth it.”
He couldn’t make out the sun’s position through the thick branches, but eventually the pale sunlight that managed to filter through began to fail.  Ivan had no desire to be caught outdoors in this uncanny forest at night, but there was nothing for it but to ride on.
“No,” replied Sherlock curtly. “Hmmm, almost all the media stories showed close-ups of the Cherni Kucheta tattoo. Anyone could have seen it, but it’s relatively intricate and would be difficult to execute by someone untrained.”
“Yes, of course. And that’s not a bad thing. At least we can be sure that no one in the wedding party will have a mysterious criminal past.”
There was no tube connecting the plane to the terminal, as John had grown accustomed to in Canada.  In fact, there was no terminal.  The passengers descended a set of portable stairs directly to the tarmac.  There were no other planes, only a rather shabby looking air tower and a clutch of what appeared to be storage buildings.
The shopping basket was glaringly devoid of produce, so John added a few apples, the Cox’s Orange Pippins that he himself liked and the Bramleys that Sherlock ate raw just to be contrary. When had his grocery shopping become all about Sherlock’s tastes?
He rode mainly west but whenever a choice of westward roads presented itself, he chose the road tending north.  Thus he came eventually to the stone bridge that spanned the river running down from the mountains and crossed it to enter the haunted forest beyond.  Ivan looked neither to the left nor to the right, but spurred his horse forward along the forest track, his heart beating hard.
“Maaahhhhhh! Maaahhhhhh!” said Madeleine. Up until now she’d been reasonably content. Now she started to screw up her face and kick. Hard.
at New Scotland Yard will answer the phone, refuse to listen to me and either hang up or at most grudgingly consent to leave a note on Lestrade’s desk.  Meanwhile the opportunity will be lost!”
“No, I said that his curse trapped me in that form.  Without my heart, I couldn’t switch back and forth as I had always done.  And as now I can do once more.  Ivan...”  Ivan felt the rumble of Sherlock’s whisper in his ear, the vibration of Sherlock’s chest against his back.  “Ivan, I can still take you flying.”
Sherlock gave him a sideways look. “Really, John, are you sure that suggestion came solely from the music?”
“And enjoy being knotted without getting hurt. Omegas outside heat don’t. Betas never do. And Sherlock... Hey, Sherlock? Look at me. That’s better. I want you to consider something.”
“Sarya Tyuleneva, as you are entitled to your anger, so Ivan is to his joy.  We have a long journey ahead.  We won’t survive by fighting each other.  Now apologize.”
A loaf of rye bread and dishes of butter and sour cream already sat out on the table.  Marfa Hudovna dished out two large bowls of borscht, and they sat down to eat.  After a moment, Ivan began to chuckle.  When Marfa Hudovna looked at him curiously, he explained, “It’s so
