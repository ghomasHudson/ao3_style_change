“If?” Castiel’s heart races in his chest even as he holds his breath. Dean sighs over the line and Castiel can see him in his mind’s eye leaning against the Z-1, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, phone clutched in the other.
A whine slips from Dean's mouth without his permission. He doesn't know how to process any of this, but he knows he's turned on. A light touch to his cheek brings him back to Cas, who is standing by him.
Dean's confused, and a small ounce of jealously curls around his ribs for a second before he gets it. He grins, bad feeling banished, and yells, "Polo!"
"It doesn't feel like. It feels like one of those movie moments. You know, like Hallmark or something. The couple lays in bed and has blissful pillow talk while the world goes on around them, oblivious."
Cas stares at him for a long moment, but he finally nods. He gives Dean a quick kiss on the lips, then steps back. "I'd like you to undress. I'll take your clothes."
The building Dean brought him to was a fairly popular hotel. It was painted white and had large columns covered in some sort of ivy that Castiel didn't recognize, though it looked familiar. They went through the lobby without even a passing glance at the woman manning the desk and right onto the elevator. Castiel was uncomfortable now. He felt sticky and gross, and something edging on shame, which Dean seemed to pick up on. He was giving him a hard, assessing look that Castiel didn't quite understand. Dean didn't know him, why would he be worried about Castiel was feeling now? But then... He supposed that what Dean was doing with him wasn't exactly normal, but he couldn't be sure. He wasn't stupid. He and Dean had used each other. And it had been enjoyable.
"G-green. Green, Sir. Oh - oh God." A tremor runs through Dean, and Castiel smiles and runs a hand through Dean's damp hair, quieting the whimpers.
Dean joked and he heard a watery chuckle from the other side. It made him smile. There was a scrambling sound and Dean stood up as well. For some reason, he trailed his hand across the wall as he walked. He went out to the living room and pulled open his door just as Cas raised his hand to knock on it, apparently. He was standing there with his arm awkwardly hanging in the air, an embarrassed look on his red face.
"I would like that." He rumbles, and damn, Cas's voice makes Dean's cock twitch in his pants. The implications of that statement have Dean's brain flying off to every porn scenario his mind has ever played for him. He wonders what Cas is into sex-wise. Is he kinky? Dean's going to go with his gut and say hell yeah he is. If he likes exhibitionism, he could be into all kinds of other things, Dean's mind reasons. The thought is exciting, and he presses a palm down into his growing erection, trying to stifle his reaction. It's doesn't work very well. Cas must notice him wriggling in his seat a little because his smile grows, showing his teeth now. He leans across the table a bit and lowers his voice even further.
Dean's ass is exposed to the open air, and even after being sated, the position does offer some delicious thoughts to pass through his dirty mind.
"Hush. I know what you need. And I will give it to you. When I decide to. You trust me don't you, baby boy?" Dean looks up at him with big, pleading eyes.
Later, when Castiel is sleeping and Cain is standing guard, so to speak, it’s him that sees Dean’s caller ID pop up on the screen. It’s him who silently watches the phone ring until the notification is gone. Castiel is sleeping soundly, none the wiser. Cain will do what he has to do to protect him, and right now, he needs to sleep. It’s the first time in days that Cain’s seen anything resembling peace on his face and he’d like to keep it there as long as possible.
"Yes. There he is. That's it." Castiel murmurs, pleased. God. Dean is so responsive. He's amazing. Castiel adds a third finger, and Dean twists in his bonds, trying to fuck himself on Castiel's finger. He lets him. The more desperate Dean is for an orgasm, the sweeter the torture of not getting one will be. When Dean is loose and slicked open, Castiel removes his fingers. Dean whimpers.
"Why are you hurting, Cas?" Castiel didn't want to answer. He didn't want to be hurt. Dean leaned forward again, but this time instead of going for his throat he started mouthing at Castiel's jawline, mumbling in between licks and kisses. "Not gonna - hurt you - Don't want you - hurt. Tell me - now." Dean's rough tongue traced a line across Castiel's stubble to his earlobe which he nibbled at softly, making Castiel lose the ability to think. When he realized that Castiel wasn't going to answer he pulled back and now Castiel could see the scowl on his face. "Tell me, little mate. What is it?"
perfectly. He traces a finger over his length encased in the cloth lightly, and Dean gasps. Cas can see how Dean tries to curb his natural instinct to thrust up into the touch. Good. He's learning. Most likely not even aware that he's doing that.
Cas had been talking faster and faster, spitting out the words and sounding more on edge by the second. Dean shushed him.
"Why did you do that?" It looks as if Dean pulled a layer of skin off with his teeth. Castiel doubts very seriously that he bit it hard enough to do that.
Cas shakes his head, “It’s okay,” Dean slides off of him sticks his hand down Cas’s boxers. He immediately wraps his hand around Cas’s cock, “Don’t worry about- oh fuck!”
"Oh, God." The heat's gone for a moment- "You can call me Sir," -then they're back around him, a tongue flicking out to taste him.
That's what it feels like anyway. Dean doesn't like doctor's offices at all, but his mood swings haven't ever really been this bad, and he thinks it's because Cas makes him so happy. If he's just normal, then his mood doesn't usually sway that much. But Cas makes him so happy. It's throwing is unbalanced brain out of whack even more, and for every high, there has to be a low. He doesn't want Cas to have to deal with that. Maybe antidepressants would sort out his hormone issues if that's what it is. He's pretty sure that's what it is. It makes sense, really, but he's no doctor, so who knows?
Dean laughs, "It's alright, man. I like talking to you. Tell me what you did today." Dean lays down on his back with his phone to his ear, closing his eyes and just listening to Cas's smooth rumbling voice. It was comforting as hell, and Dean didn't care that he thought that. Not one damn bit.
As he slides his bag in between his feet, it hits something under the bed. Dean bends and looks and sees a cardboard box with a lid sticking out from under the blanket a bit. He just shoves it back under, gently, in case it's something breakable, and starts pawing through his clothes. He's looking for -ah-ha! There it is.
“So… Should we cut to the chase, or?” Dean asks quietly, staring at the table and tracing a finger over the rim of his coffee lid.
Dean laughed and joked, "You should be. So what's up, man? Why're you crying?" There was a heavy sigh from the other side of the wall and another sniffle.
"No, I do. I just... Don't want to do this part, I guess. It's been a really long time since I've been in one of these." He gestures at the room.
Castiel settles down at his desk and begins attempting to write. It's a piece for a magazine, but his focus is everywhere. He can't seem to get a single sentence down without his mind wandering off to some distant place. After forty-five minutes of endless backspacing and frustration, he gives up. He is never so distracted, but something's off today. Without thinking about it, he drags his cellphone out and presses two on the speed dial. It picks up after two rings.
He could do as he pleased, he supposed. There was still the question of what to do with himself, but he had a feeling that Dean had the answer to that. "I am not going to speak to him. In fact, it might be wise to get rid of my phone. They can be tracked." Dean looked impressed. "Good point. I'll take care of that for you." He moved and went into the bathroom. Castiel heard a crunching sound then the swoosh of plastic and Dean was back out looking proud of himself. "What did you do?"
"We'll come with you," Dean says, and grabs Castiel's arm as he stands. He turns back to Castiel, "Please?"
"I can. I know about the warrants, John. You're wanted in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas for assault, robbery, and a slew of other things. You're in no position to tell me what I can't do. You're going away for a long time, old man, and when -
"C-Cas. H-hands. Hands, ple-please." He pleads, and Cas immediately takes his left hand, the one that isn't occupied in Dean's ass, and pulls an end, and the whole thing unravels. Dean figured out what was wrong. He couldn't hold onto Cas, and he needed it. Dean needed the warmth, the steadiness of Cas's body. Dean only belatedly realizes he spoke those words out loud.
Cas isn't looking at him, they're alone, and Dean can just stare as much as he wants to without it being weird. Cas' black hair is so tangled it looks like a rats nest on the pillow and he knows without looking that there's a line of drool leaking from his mouth down onto the fabric of the blanket. Cas is no longer God's perfect soldier, he's wonderfully, breathably human and Dean loves it. He loves him.
Dean likes the look on Cas. He wonders if he looks like that when he's asleep. Probably not. He shakes his head softly and slides up the bed and onto Cas. Dean's legs brace against either side of Cas's hips, and Dean rests his head in the crook of his neck. Hands come up across his back, and Cas rumbles into Dean's ear. "Good morning, Dean."
A frog croaks from the nearby woods and Dean looks up at the sky. Everything seems crystal clear tonight - the air, the sky, his mind. Like he can lay everything out and look at it objectively. His skin chills in the night dew and he rubs his arms but makes no move to go inside. He doesn't want the clarity of the moment to disappear. He sighs deeply, drawing in the cool night air and replenishing his lungs. He feels like he's healing. Like the air is traveling all through his veins and straight into his soul, letting him finally let go of that old, stale, breath. He supposes this is what it feels like to let go of your past - or not have it hang over you, anyway. Dad is going to be going away for a long time, and Dean can finally relax. He's starting to put the pieces together, he thinks.
The truck smells like old liquor and greasy gas station food. There are holes in the leather from cigarettes, not that he smokes, but most of the girls that he pulls do. An old rock ballad plays on the radio - one he murmurs along to when he remembers it's on. John narrows his eyes at the headlights blinding him from the other side of the road. Halogen headlights should be banned, in his opinion. His truck rumbles as he turns onto a quieter street and drives down it slowly, searching. His eyes glint in the darkness of the cab against the streetlights, malice shining in them. He checks his mirrors, knowing nobody is following him, but it's an old habit from his days of scamming tables in poker. He ran into quite a bit of trouble with that.
Cas turns around with an arched brow. "Was there anything you didn't enjoy or wish had been different?"
Cas chuckles, but he also narrows his eyes after a moment before stepping all into Dean's personal space. They're nearly nose to nose now, and Cas seems imposing all of a sudden.
"I don't know about all that... but you could always give me a little demonstration," Dean whines as Cas's thumb flicks over the tip of his dick and he shudders. Dean reciprocates, trailing his hand down Cas's side till he reaches the edge of his boxers.
As she leads them into a small hallway away from the waiting room, the pit in his stomach grows. He drags the back of his hand across his forehead, grimacing at the slime of nervous sweat. He wipes it on his jeans and grimaces. "Oh, I'm fine. How are you?"
"Of course, I mean it. I only tell you the truth, baby boy. We're going to go upstairs now." Castiel says as he starts walking, still holding Dean like a... like one would carry a child.
B: He won't. Besides, he's your intended mate. That doesn't just apply to you, you know. He wants to be with you too.
Back at his house, Castiel stands in his kitchen for a long time, looking around. Before yesterday, there had been dirty dishes and takeout containers everywhere. Wine bottles had littered his kitchen counter and he’d not done laundry in days. But after speaking with Cain Castiel had decided to try and get back to normal. How else was he supposed to get closure? Was
Most likely, considering this was a rather seedy motel that had all the doors on the outside. It was shaped like a very large, squared off U, with the main office being right in the middle. The cheap pink and orange decor was a little nausea-inducing, but he was sure there were worse designs. Dean came stomping back out of the double glass doors holding a key in his hand. When he reached the Impala he went around to the back seat and pulled out a duffle bag before shutting the door, a little hard, again. When he was walking by the front of the car he stopped and looked at Castiel through the windshield. His jaw was set and almost looked clenched shut.
"Angelic, hmm?" Cas leans forward and presses a kiss to Dean's forehead, "I can accept that, but only if you tell me you're beautiful."
Cas looks up at him and tilts his head, eyes far away. There's a whoosh then all of a sudden all his clothes are gone and there's a naked Cas kneeling between his legs staring at his junk like it's the Holy Grail. Fuck, he's beautiful. All tanned skin and sharp planes. Jimmy Novak had a lithe, muscular body, and fuck if Cas doesn't wear it well. He can't see his cock from his angle, but he can see the dark trail of hair leading to it. He hopes like hell Jimmy Novak was well-endowed because Dean wants to be split open on Cas's cock. Dean's mouth is watering just looking at those dusky nipples (and shit there's actually a little freckle above one and he wants to bite there) and muscled arms. "If you're uncomfortable, say something. I've permitted you to speak and make noise. Use it." Cas's voice is stern but Dean hears the underlying worry there.
Under that wall, there's a hardwood bench. It's polished, smooth and dark, and gleaming. Dean wonders what exactly that's for... It has metal clamps on either side of it, lengthwise, but he doesn't understand what that would be for. He looks around again, trying to take it in.
B: Ah, nothin much. Found me a pretty little thing who was willing to donate, so that was nice. Courtesy of my buddy down here. How's things with Hot Wings?
Cas starts talking about college and how he got his degree. He tells a funny story about a man named Balthazar and something they did with guinea pigs. Dean's drifting in and out as he listens. Cas's voice is low and soothing, and Dean falls asleep to the pleasing lull of it.
boy. You won't cum!" Cas grinds out. Dean gets the picture. He's picturing floggers and paddles and leather-
"Wait, wait, Cas. It's alright. Listen, as crazy as it sounds, I care enough to listen, okay? I'll listen. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here, alright? I've been there and I know how it is. My brother tried to commit... Well, it was a few years ago. He technically died for about three minutes before he was brought back. I lived a lifetime in those three minutes. Grief kinda follows me around, I guess. My mom first, when I was just a kid. My dad a few years back. The silence from that... it can drive you crazy sometimes. And other times there's so much damn noise that your head feels like it's going to explode, and you feel like you're just going to snap. But- But I'll listen, okay? I can be here for you to talk to."
He stands up and stretches with his arms outstretched towards the stained ceiling with a wince at the twinge in his lower back. Crap, he needs some aspirin. He shuffles to the bathroom to take a piss. The bottle of painkillers is mostly empty, but hopefully, they'll take care of the cricks. He shakes two out in his hand and takes them dry, barely registering the bitter taste. When did life get like this? He has a shitty, run-down apartment that he's barely affording. He's working two dead-end jobs and he's hardly making ends meet, not even making enough to keep his ten-year-old brother fed. He's taking more aspirin than he can count; his liver is going to shut down soon if he keeps this up. When had he even bought this bottle? Last week? The week before last? Something like that, Dean can't remember. It doesn't matter anyway. Shit. He has to call and cancel his cards today. He needs to do that soon before he forgets. But first, food.
If Dean seems overly nervous, Castiel will ease him into it. They can scene in the bedroom, which is a familiar place for him. But if not... Well, the possibilities the playroom offers are delicious. Castiel takes a deep breath and tries to still his mind. He reassures himself again that he's ready.
I know it's super short, but in my defense, things are really really crappy right now for me. I do have ideas now though for where I want this to go. I wanted it to be a short BAMF Dean and Cas fic, but every story I write wants to turn itself into 200,000 words. I will avoid that here. (I hope.) Lol. I kinda have a jist of the storyline though now, so it should be updated a little more often. Thank you guys for being patient with me. Much love. <3
Cain promises that the Impala will be returned to Castiel's driveway by morning, and Castiel makes a mental note to buy him a very expensive bottle of scotch as a thank you. They both received some basic first aid from a couple of EMTs that arrived after the police were called. They'd given Castiel a painkiller for his nose, and they'd said Dean was in shock. Their instructions were to report to their general practitioners within the next 48 hours to get checked out fully. Dean's eyes are glassy the entire ride home. Nothing but whimpers escape him when they hit potholes, or Castiel goes around a curve too fast. He's not entirely sure what's wrong with Dean. Physically, he sustained minimal injuries, but mentally... it doesn't seem like he's here at all. Castiel's never dealt with someone that's in shock before. The paramedics suggested rest.
Sam tries to smack him from across the table, and Dean dodges. He bursts out laughing at the indignant red flush on Sammy's cheeks. After a moment, Sam clears his throat and gestures behind Dean. Dean turns and finds Cas standing there behind him.
"As much as I like it, I did say I wasn't just interested in sex. I'd like to get to know you. Do you feel the same?"
One of his favorite features is Cas's lips. They're plump and pink and have small white spots where the pink fades into something lighter. Dean loves looking at them, but he loves kissing them more. For now, though, their breath stinks, and Dean has to pee. He rolls out of bed, trying not to disturb Cas, and goes to the bathroom. When he's finished there, Dean shuffles to the kitchen, yawning. He wants coffee.
They updated their contract, and there are more things on it now that Dean is willing to try. And Cas had promised him it would be Dom first this time. Boyfriend always, but Dean knows he's going to be sterner now, and he's going to have to be on his best behavior if he wants to be a good boy for Cas.
Castiel gives the other nipple the same treatment before pulling away, taking in the way Dean looks. He's flushed and panting, pink mouth open, eyes closed, and dick hard and leaking pre-cum into a puddle on his stomach. Castiel has a wet spot on his shirt from it. He pulls it off and throws it on the floor by Dean's clothes, and now they're both naked. "You may open your eyes."
The man's hand is warm and very strong, Dean can feel the taut muscles and rough callouses, and he likes it.
After universal nods, Sam hurriedly pulls his laptop from the bag and opens it, excitement lit in his eyes.
Cas nods as if to say 'that explains a few things' and continues rubbing Dean's thigh through his jeans. Then the hand is gone, and so is the comforting warmth that was spiraling through him at the contact. Cas stands up and walks to the other side of the booth, encouraging Dean to scootch over and let Cas sit down. When Cas is seated, he leans forward until they're nearly nose to nose.
Cas slams into him before tensing and spraying Dean's insides with what's sure to be ropes of cum. Dean can feel it twitching inside of him, and he clenches his ass around, riding his own wave of pleasure, vibrating with tension on top of Cas. He opens his eyes and looks down at where his twitching, rock-hard cock is spraying cum all over Cas's naked chest, marking him up, and he swears to God it's like he has another orgasm.
Castiel always loved the smell of the Quarter. The thick air was heavy with the scent of fresh bread, and oily meat, and rich cheese. Fried foods too, as well as odd, tangy, smokes from various burning herbs, mainly marijuana but plenty were just incense pouring out of the numerous tourist shops selling cheap trinkets to take back home and show the folks. Old wood, fresh paint, many types of flowers and other vegetation, the potent yet not unpleasant smell of people sweating and walking in the not exactly oppressive heat. It was only February, and already it was almost 70 degrees. The humidity was high, and it cloaked his skin in a warm blanket that after all the years here he was completely accustomed to.
“No,” Castiel chides him and gently pulls Dean’s lip out from between his teeth. “None of that. I want to hear all of your noises, kitten. Give them to me.”
"Me too," Castiel smiles too, though his is a little more mischievous, "Now, are you ready to play, sweet boy?"
"God, you are perfect," Castiel murmurs, and Dean twitches. Castiel moves in front of Dean and sets the toys there on the carpet. He drops to his knees in front of Dean, looking up at his beautiful boy, all tethered and aching for him. He runs his hand lightly up Dean's upper thigh and
“Come on, cowboy, roll over. We have all day. There’s nothing to do today but sex. I think we should just do that. But for now, you’re heavy. Lay over there and cuddle me.”
"Times are hard, but they ain't that hard." He mutters to himself as he opens the cabinet. He smiles when he finds a box of Lucky Charms in there. Awesome. He loves these. Sammy does too, luckily. It's about the only food they actually agree on. Dean pulls out a plastic Tupperware bowl from the cabinet and pours all the remaining Lucky Charms into the bowl (which isn't a lot.)
"I'm going to go get it. You better be sitting up by the time I get back, or I'm going to eat all the sausage."
Castiel can hear the humor and allusion in Dean's voice, and it makes him smile. Was it always this easy to be domestic? To cook and just talk with a partner? He doesn't think it was.
They're both sweat-slicked and smelling strongly of sex and exertion. Not to mention being covered in release.
"So who was your first Dom?" Dean questions as they chow down on a pineapple and ham pizza they ordered. He knows that people dis them, but he likes the combination, and Cas seems to be pretty ambivalent about it. Castiel chews and seems to regard the question thoughtfully. After he swallows, he begins to speak.
"Of course. You're always welcome here. Besides, I miss you." Cas's palms land on his hips, and he leans forward and draws him into another kiss that leaves Dean smiling and happy. "I miss you too."
"You ready, Dean?" Sam pipes up. He looks pretty cute in his black tux. Dean ruffles his hair which makes the twelve-year-old complain loudly. "Dean, stop it! I'm not a kid anymore."
“I plan on doing a lot more of that, but yes, you may touch. Let’s see how desperate you can make me for this cock,” Castiel says as he takes hold of Dean’s dick. He knows what a picture he must make right now, leaned over Dean like this. He’s baring one of his most vulnerable places for Dean to touch, and he appreciates the reverence that he takes with it. It’s the same that Castiel does for Dean. Every touch is holy, sacred, vital.
It took forever to come down from the high of his release because Dean didn't stop his ministrations, he just gradually slowed them down. And not until Castiel was whining and trying to get away from did he finally let him go. Dean popped off his now softening cock and licked his lips lewdly. "Damn, Cas. You're amazing, man, and we are definitely doing that again." He crawled up the bed until his knees were bracketing Castiel's hips. He was surprised to feel a wet spot on Dean's jeans. He looked up in surprise and Dean just smiled. "You get me hot, Cas. What can I say? That was awesome." Did Dean come just from giving Cas fellatio? His partner got off on giving other people pleasure. He filed
"Of course. We made the plans, they just haven't panned out yet. There's been a lot going on. We haven't-"
"May I see where you were just talking to me from? I'm curious if we share the same layout." Dean shrugged.
"I agree. That was amazing... Are you still wanting more, Dean? It's fine if you're not, I will most definitely not hold it against you. You've been amazing tonight, more so than I ever could've hoped."
Dean listens as Cas explains the various theories behind the purple honey. He makes and eats his Ramen noodles as he does, chicken flavor - those are his favorite. Dean drains them and throws in some ranch. Now he twirls them around his fork as he listens to Cas's voice. Dean didn't realize that he had missed his voice today. When he says as much, Cas hums.
"If you're not comfortable with it, it's fine, Dean. I'm perfectly happy with how we are now. It was only an errant question."
Shit. Did he really just do that? He did. He's sweating the whole time he's walking to the post office, wondering how this will go.
"Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I mean... We should probably talk. Like, uh, what's your last name?" Castiel laughs, and Dean immediately falls a little in love with the sound. "My last name is James."
"Hmm," Cas hums, looking thoughtful. "My boy snuck away and cleaned himself up, did he? Did you do that for me?"At Dean's nod, he continues, fingering the waistband of Dean's panties. "And these? Are these for me too?"
The last thing he remembered was leaving Memphis. It had taken them about eight hours to get from New Orleans to Tennessee, and Castiel had been tired for some inexplicable reason. He didn't even remember laying down across the seat to rest on Dean's lap. Suddenly he received a sharp slap on his right buttcheek making him jump up into sitting position, pulling him rudely from his comfortable haze. It wasn't harsh. He was wearing pants, and the slap wasn't hard but it was the shock of it more than anything. Dean was laughing. "I thought that'd wake you up."
scene without penetration. It would keep Dean from hurting himself physically, but Lord knows about his emotional state later.
"Cas. Cas, wake up, sweetheart. Come on." Castel pulled himself from the hazy depths of sleep only to find himself laying across the front seat, curled up on his left side with his head on Dean's lap and Dean's hand stroking through his hair. He didn't want to wake up. He was so comfortable and warm. The smooth rumble of the Impala's engine was soothing and spelled safety for Castiel. He liked it like this. A warm leather smell encased his senses, and underneath that, he could smell Dean.
Wearing toys in public is alright. Bondage, even suspension bondage, is a-go. Suspension bondage is a HUGE go. He wants to do it so badly. Just the thought of being trussed up, hanging from a ceiling at Cas's mercy is beyond appealing. It's downright orgasmic.
"Yes, yes, yes," Dean chants, his hips stuttering. The wave rises, rises, towers over him, and then it crashes.
"Gorgeous, baby boy. Damn gorgeous." He says into Dean's ear, and his knees nearly buckle. Cas grabs his ass and pushes upward. Dean gets the memo and hops, wrapping his legs around Cas's waist and his arms around his shoulders. He's never known another person to be able to carry him without trouble, not even his gargantuan baby brother. But Cas seems almost supernaturally strong because he does it with ease.
That makes Cas pull away. He laughs deeply, his head thrown back and his eyes closed. Dean watches him, fascinated. He's never loved to watch someone laugh so much, but with Cas, his laugh is like a balm for Dean's soul.
Then Cas's cock is being guided past his lips and into his mouth. It's warm and velvety smooth - but not as hard as it could be. Dean plans to remedy that.
Dean whines and his hips start rocking on their own accord. The friction is heaven on his aching cock and he almost cries with relief at finally moving.
"Because to be so open to every emotion in such a harsh world is... commendable. People build walls and block themselves off from feeling things to protect themselves. You, on the other, you - you open yourself up, taking in every situation wholeheartedly, even when it hurts you. I can't help but admire that bravery." Dean takes in Cas's solemn expression and his kind eyes, and he can't help the pink stain rising to his cheeks. Nobody's ever said anything like that to him before.
Deflection, one of Dean's better skills. Chuck averts his eyes and gets a large stack of mail out of the box. A very large stack. Doesn't look like he's checked that in a while. "I-I'm fine. Making progress, actually."
Dean just hums, and his breaths are soft and slow. Castiel smiles and pulls away from him a little, then cuddles into Dean, laying down again. His boy is asleep, safe, and cherished. Castiel spends the next few minutes thinking about Dean and what he's learned tonight, not just about his past, but about their relationship dynamic. Hmm...
The hot drag of Cas's dick in him is heaven and Dean's eyes closed of their own accord. He slams himself back against Cas's unmoving form, trying to gain the movement he wants, the intensity he needs, the fierceness he craves. He needs more.
Dean sputters around a sip of coffee. After he’s swallowed it and wiped his mouth he says, “You act like you can see it.”
"Wipe your mouth off, sweetheart," Castiel says softly, looking over at Dean. He does, then Dean looks over at the bed stretching behind him. "Is it bedtime?"
The man grins and the warm chuckle slides through Castiel's bones as the man begins to laugh heartily, making his heart palpitate. That was an unexpected reaction. The man, whose name he still hasn't caught, sidles in between Castiel and the next bar stool until he's leaning his left side against the counter, blocking he and Castiel into a small intimate box of warmth that was rapidly becoming too hot. And what was that smell? Could it be him? If so, he smelled amazing. Like leather, and wind, and brandy. It was intoxicating and Castiel had leaned closer before even realizing it. The green-eyed man's breath was warm, puffing over his neck and into his ear, making Castiel shiver delightedly. "It's funny you ask. I've been looking for a... companion. Come with me." It wasn't exactly a request, but it definitely wasn't a demand. Castiel clearly heard a note of hope in the man's voice, and he understood what he was most likely propositioning. Could Castiel do that?
"Ugh. It was just so damned stupid. The clients were hovering over me the whole time I was looking over the Maserati, which is a great car, by the way, and they were questioning me about everything. These idiots didn't know the first thing about cars! They questioned my credentials and qualifications, like I'm stupid or something and not literally fixing their precious piece of garbage. It was ridiculous!"
He accentuated his point by leaning down and inhaling deeply from Castiel's hair. "It's not something you should feel embarrassed about or something. I wish you could see what I mean." Me too, Castiel thought. Something was still missing though and it was making him nervous. Dean still wasn't holding him. Did Dean not... want him anymore? His face was buried in Castiel's hair, but that was most likely just because Castiel smelled attractive to Dean. Maybe Dean just liked the smell of him. He supposed it was understandable, but it still hurt. Pain began making it's way from the center of his chest and out into his limbs, making him weak.
"Cause you're special, Cas." He murmurs, more feeling behind the words than he intended, but they're still truthful. Cas's eyes widen minutely, then without warning, his finger slips inside Dean.
"You're mine, Castiel Novak. You're staying with me. I'm not letting you go anywhere, Sunshine." Dean grabbed a handful of Castiel's hair and pulled his head to the side, exposing the left side of his neck for Dean's hungry, perusing eyes. "Mine." He growled and his fangs descended just a moment before he bit Castiel again right on the mark he had made the night before.
"I was hoping you'd say that. Lay down on your back, Dean. We're going to play some more, baby boy. You sure you're up for it?"
And best of all, it's not just about Cas. Cas makes Dean want to be better. He's playing with the idea of going to the doctor and asking them about antidepressants or something. Doctors freak him out. He hates the sterile offices and the cold eyes of the bored nurses. He always feels so judged and unprepared for the things they ask. Like, going into stores and flirting with cashiers or whatever, that's easy.
"Tell me what's going through your head. I'm here, Dean. I'm here," He feels tears prick at his eyes, and he closes them, squeezing them shut. " I, I just - you - I can't take you believing those things too. I can't. It hurts."
"Ca-as?" He draws the word out, looking warily at the suspiciously cheerful little hives. Cas turns around and smiles when he sees Dean and extends his hand, "Come on, Dean. They won't hurt you if you intend them no harm. Besides, even if you get stung, it won't kill you. It's estimated to take approximately 1,100 stings to be fatal."
Dean cuts himself off as he rocks his weeping erection against Castiel's abdomen. In the process, he's grinding against Castiel's erection caught between them, and the sensation makes him groan. With a frustrated noise, Castiel lays a hand against Dean's hip and stills their rocking, much to Dean's despair. He whines and lays his head back against Castiel's shoulder, panting. He soothes Dean, "I've got you, sweet boy. I'm going to take good care of you. You just have to trust me."
that they have right now. Cas takes a deep breath and slowly leans into Dean's hand until his palm is scratching against the stubble on his cheek and his fingertips are nestled in his soft hair. Dean's tongue snakes out and he wets his bottom lip before drawing it into his mouth to bite it. Cas opens his eyes and looks over at Dean, his gaze intense and speaking volumes. Dean does the only thing he can think of. The only thing that feels right. He nods.
His emotions are unstable, most likely because of his hormones. Last night he was exposed to an increased level of endorphins and serotonin. The spike was too big, Castiel thinks, and now Dean's brain is reeling, saturated with hormones. His brain releases more chemicals to try to counteract it in an endless cycle. One thing Castiel does know, he needs to research, and Dean needs to go to the doctor. He also needs to make sure that he's content and as safe and happy he can be.
Castiel settles back against the mattress, adjusting his position a little more on his side, curving towards Dean, and he strokes his hand over his face.
Dean looks over at the coffee pot, smiling when he sees that it's full. He loves fast coffee pots. They're a blessing on his tired life. He pulls a chipped blue mug out of the cabinet and pours the coffee in, adding two spoons of sugar and stirring. As he takes a hot sip, it occurs to him that he moves around this kitchen with more ease than he does his own.
"You don't have to hide from me. Not your emotions, not your apparent lack of acceptance for compliments, and definitely... not your sounds." Castiel punctuates the last sentence by slipping his finger inside Dean, who is sopping with Castiel's cum and lubricant. "Show me your appreciation with your noises. Your moans are music to my ears."
He shoves the eggs into his mouth so he can move on from that subject. Why does he keep doing that shit? It's not like he does it on purpose, but it's like his brain just goes off on a tangent, and the outside world becomes background noise. It's annoying and dangerous. Dean remembers the time he nearly caught the kitchen on fire when he went into his own little world while making homemade french fries. That had been great. Grease fires are fun. Jesus, he needs to go see a doctor. He's looking at his plate as he eats, but he watches as Cas moves around the counter and stops by Dean. He struggles to snap out of the weird haze his brain keeps slipping back into and looks up at Cas, who's standing close. Dean turns the spinning stool until he's facing Cas. He steps forward into the space between Dean's legs.
He has no idea what to do, or how to fix this. Running's not an option. He's not worried about dealing with his dad. It's always something or the other that he's done wrong or hasn't done to the exact specifications given to him by the old man. It's Cas. He's only had the teaspoon-sized version of all the baggage Dean's carrying. How's he going to react to John showing up here, or wherever Dean is and causing trouble? He has a laundry list of things that he doesn't need John knowing about, and the biggest of those would be about his boyfriend. The hell from that almost makes the thought of being a hermit profitable. Hell, logical. Why can't he just live a normal life? He puts his head back down, screwing his eyes shut in frustration.
At the pet name, Castiel lost his will to resist. He broke. "I just- You don't want me. You want my scent. A minute ago you weren't holding me, you were smelling me. And I - it's understandable, but I-" A thick finger was pressed against Castiel's lips, effectively stopping the flow of words. Dean's expression had softened now. "Cas, for being such a smart guy, you're kind of stupid. Of course, I want you. I love the way you smell, because fuck," He groaned. "But I lo- like you too. As a person. Not just your scent."
Dean wakes up, and his body feels weirdly floaty, and his mind is fuzzy. His tongue is thick, but he still manages a muffled, "Cas?" There's movement in front of him then he feels Cas stroking his hair and his cheek. "There you are. How are you feeling, Dean?"
Castiel finds the small shudder shooting through Dean at the words fascinating. He wonders if he could push Dean into submission with 'sweet boy.' It seems to have that effect on him. When he uses the phrase, Dean relaxes, and Castiel can see him visibly un-tense and become more pliant. Castiel will have to use it with care. He doesn't want to accidentally push Dean into a subspace that he's not prepared for. Neither of them is ready for that at this point, he doesn't think.
His mind was fuzzy when he came to again. He saw a hazy version of Dean kneeling beside him, patting something on the side of his head and it hurt. He tried to move way but a soft pressure on his other ear prevented him. He realized it was Dean's hand. "Dean." He rumbled, his voice scraping against his throat and he started coughing. Dean looked at him worriedly and sat him up so he didn't choke. "No, Cas. Don't talk. Your throat's all fucked up. Please, just shut up, okay?" Castiel sent Dean a scathing look, at least to the best of his ability anyway. He felt so light headed. "Come on. Lay back down. I got to get this bleeding to stop." Castiel noticed how Dean was licking his lips, and his eyes were wide. Dean was
Dean grabbed Cas's other hand so he was holding both of them. He looked into his eyes, and without breaking eye contact, he sunk down onto one knee.
So good! Don't stop." Dean pants. Castiel chuckles and pushes his fingers into Dean slowly and gingerly, loving the gradual build.
"A friend of a friend of a cousin of mine. They knew I was looking for one. It cost me quite considerably." The man says, and Dean nods.
He doesn't feel as exposed now, with Cas touching him instead of just watching him. The safeword thing was a good distraction. Cas steps around him until he's pressed tightly against Dean's back, a hand traveling up his throat to brush at his lips slightly with the fingertips.
Cas nods and smiles, cleaning his last bit of syrup from the plate with a swipe of waffle. He stands, grabbing Dean's already cleared plate as he goes. Dean stays sitting in his chair, swiveling around to look at Cas as he goes for the sink. Even in sweatpants, he looks delectable, and Dean wants to bite him. He rolls his eyes at himself and openly stares at Cas's ass as he moves around, washing and rinsing the plates and putting them in the dish drainer.
Dean whines and whimpers through the words and Castiel pulls off his cock and starts jerking him with rough, furious strokes, using his considerable spit to slick his hand. "Please God, Sir! Please! Please, I'm so close! Sir! Fuck!"
"Oh, you've got company. Hi, hot wings." Castiel was confused for a moment before something clicked. "Hot wings?" Dean asked, obviously confused. "I think Benny is referring to the fact that I am named after the angel of Thursday." Dean looked dumbfounded. "Oh. I didn't know that." Castiel moved and extended his hand. "It is nice to make your acquaintance.
Castiel bucked his hips in a futile effort to try to get Dean off of him but it only succeeded in making him laugh and press his body down more firmly against Castiel's. Of course, having the opposite effect than what he wanted. "I don't like being held down. I don't want you controlling me." Dean smiled warmly, if not a bit sarcastically before sniffing the air rather obviously. He took a deep inhale and closed his eyes as he exhaled. His bright green eyes flashed a deep red for a moment before returning to normal. What had just happened?
"Hmm... Assless, huh? That's good. That's such a good boy, Dean, wanting to surprise me. Being quiet and not waking me up to get yourself clean for me. That was very thoughtful of you. I love this surprise. Did you prep yourself as well?"
Castiel closes his front door and turns the locks out of habit. He discards his shoes, coat, and keys at the table in the corner, and Dean does the same. He hasn't said anything the entire ride home and Castiel's anxiety on the matter is beginning to rise, try as he might to remain patient and calm. Dean visits the bathroom, and Castiel takes the time to throw a blanket on the couch and settle in. He hopes his relaxed demeanor will put Dean at ease. The conversation begins to pick back up after Dean's return, even with him perched on the edge of the couch like he might have to run at a moment's notice. Castiel notices that he's picking anxiously at the skin around his thumbnail and has to resist the urge to grab his hand and stop him.
"Noticed that." He gasps as Cas slides back in. This time he bottoms out, and Dean groans, shuddering under Cas's touch. Then Cas pulls back and rams back in, and Dean shrieks. Finally! Cas doesn't stop. His hips start thrusting in a steady rhythm that seems intent on teasing Dean. Slow, slow, fast, fast-slow.
His ears prick when he catches the sound of bare feet quietly making their way down the stairs. Dean keeps his eyes on the floor, even when the door opens and he hears Cas's footsteps come inside. Dean's facing the wall with the holes, so he can't see Cas anyway. He makes sure to be still and tries not to think about how hard his heart is pounding. The footsteps come towards him, and then there's a soft caress along his shoulder.
Also, big thanks to utterxnfatuation because I was road-blocked on this fic until I came across some of their work. It's thanks to their poetic style that I was able to write this.
"No, no. Don't apologize. I should've told you immediately. It's a natural assumption that a pacifier is for a child, so it's only fair that you assumed that. I will ask, though, why were you under my bed?"
Dean rolls his eyes and lays back down on Castiel. "No more tickling," he says quietly. Castiel nods and says, "Okay. No more tickling. Are you okay?"
"Uh..." Dean completely blanks. Him dominating Cas? Jesus, could he even handle something like that? A hand lands over his and squeezes his fingers.
"Hey, Cas," Dean says as he walks up the path and onto the steps, stopping awkwardly in front of Cas for a moment, then throwing his arms around Castiel in an embrace. He was unprepared for the hug, but it's nice. Dean is warm against him in a delicious way. Castiel wraps his arms around him, holding him to his chest and breathing in his scent.
Her grin stretches across her teeth somewhat creepily. Dean tightens his hold on Cas's hand, who squeezes back in return. The world opens up as they round a corner. The narrow white hallway turns into a bright office setting. The artificial light makes the blue walls and checkered green and white tiles a little too bright - it makes him feel dizzy. But at least it's prettier than the off-white blandness of the rest of the facility.
"Hey, you need some help?" Dean calls. The guy turns around and Dean's flooded with emotions as the face comes into focus. All floppy hair, tan skin, and white teeth, it's his baby brother. Dean's jaw drops.
He drags the orange prescription bottle out of the white pharmacy bag and turns it over in his hand.
Cas shakes his head, smiling, "You're not weird. You feel everything very strongly. In today's world, that is a mark of a brave person, rather than a weak one. I admire you, Dean."
Dean grins and wiggles his hips, looking down then back up at Castiel with a pleading look. Castiel laughs."I suppose it is my turn to reciprocate isn't it?"
Dean looks up at Cas then back down. His thumb strokes across Dean's cheekbone in a reassuring gesture.
"Well... I just kind of wanted you to know what you're getting into. This... I mean, last night, it happens sometimes. I'm like that. If that's not something you want to deal with, I'd understand." Cas's hand slides up his back and curls into his hair soothingly.
"A vampires mate is usually someone they chose themselves, but not always. Sometimes you just run into them, and you know. It's like a soul mate, I guess. It looks like Zachariah Adler's boy is yours. You're going to have a reaction like that until you're mated with him. Then it'll calm down some." Dean rubbed his hands over his eyes unnecessarily. He just needed a minute to think. "Shit." He muttered under his breath. Benny nodded sympathetically. "Yeah. But still, it's a chance."
"Sir! Cum! Gonna cum if you d-don't stop! Oh, God!" Dean yells, and Castiel immediately turns the dildo off. He removes the vibrator from Dean, turning that off too and laying it beside him. Castiel stands and moves in close to Dean, making sure his body doesn't brush his sensitive cock. He grasps Dean's face in his hands, soothing his whimpering boy as he trembles with need, sweating and flushed and gorgeous.
He's tired, but he doesn't want to sleep. He gets Cas to sit his empty cup on the nightstand, then he scootches down the bed and wraps his arm around Cas's middle, and lays his head over Cas's sternum. The sound of his heart beating is comfortable, and he's warm, all wrapped up in the blanket and around Cas. Cas slides down further into the bed, and his hand comes up to stroke through Dean's hair. He likes that, and it makes him beyond comfortable and sleepy. He falls asleep watching Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich kick some alien ass while he's wrapped around his boyfriend. For once, he didn't regret it or feel guilty. He just feels nice, and he lets himself float away with Cas's soft, soothing strokes through his hair.
He groans loud when he feels a slight scrape of teeth across the top of his cock, and he looks down at Dean, who's looking up at him. Even with his lips wrapped around Castiel's shaft, it looks like he's smirking.
“Keep me waiting and I’ll show you just how bossy I can be, boy.” Even with his head buried in the pillow, Castiel hears Dean gulp from behind him and allows himself a small smirk. It’s so easy to get him all hot and bothered. But God, this is good. His skin is flushed and he’s sweating but the air conditioner is blowing, chilling him at the same time. He hears the click of a lube bottle behind him and then lets out an easy sigh as one of Dean’s fingers eases its way inside of him. Castiel had stretched himself out a bit in the shower for preparation’s sake, but the gentle ache of having someone else do it was wonderful. After another moment, Dean adds another finger, and Castiel groans, pushing his ass back against Dean’s hand. He’s always been greedy when it comes to sex. He wants more,
It's hard to imagine him doing this with anyone else, right now. It feels so right with Dean. It feels like Castiel was made for this. Then again, that could just be the exhaustion talking. He extinguishes the lights and climbs into bed. He'd love to spend so much more time with Dean like this since he knows it's not likely to happen again anytime soon, but he can't right now. The exhaustion is making his eyes droop and sag and he can barely string words together at this point. He takes a deep breath as he lies down and squishes his head into the pillow. Slowly, fingers creep over Castiel's abdomen and he looks over and sees Dean staring at him with wide eyes.
Jeez. He leaned up against the brick wall and breathed in deeply, trying to clear his head. This alleyway was a dead end, and he was alone in it, thankfully. There was a huge crowd about ten feet to his right, cavorting down the street excitedly. The alleyway was shadowed and it was likely no one would even look his direction so he'd be fine to stay out here for a few minutes, but regardless he should go back in and at least tell Benny he was ditching out. He didn't want to take the chance of losing control with an innocent human. He felt fine, but he wasn't sure if it would happen again or not. Right as he was about to push off the wall and go back inside to find Benny the door pushed open. Dean tensed before the dry smell of cinnamon and the marsh met his nose. It was a blessedly familiar smell. Benny.
He climbs into his car, and the silence envelopes him. He takes a few deep breaths and tries to clear his mind. As keyed up as he is, he'd prefer to go somewhere with alcohol, but that's not in the cards at the moment. With a sigh, he puts the keys in the ignition and pulls out of his driveway. The drive goes quickly, thank goodness. The Red Light Gods are working for him today, so he makes record time to the diner. Dean's Impala is already parked at the side of the building. Castiel smiles fondly and pulls in next to it. The swell of love that bubbles inside him just from seeing the car makes him feel a little better. Everything will be okay. His favorite person is in there waiting for him.
"Fuck, so good, Sir!" Dean calls, and if Castiel could grin, he would. Since he can't, he increases the suction on Dean's dick and revels in the soft gasp he gets for it. It's been a long time since he's had this much fun with anyone in the playroom.
The apartment is silent in his absence. Dean had sent him to Bobby's several weeks ago. Dean refuses to think it's because he can't provide for him, but he knows it's true. It's easier to think that Sam just likes visiting with their faux-uncle Bobby. Which, while true, Dean knows they'd both rather if they were together. They've never spent so much time apart, not even when he was with Lisa. Sam always came with him. The absence of his dorky little brother sends an ache spiraling through his chest and he cannot adult anymore today. He's done with it.
The feeling of all his extremities going numb and his entire center being compressed under enormous pressure grows until Dean feels like he's going to combust. Maybe he will shatter violently all over the room. He was talking, uttering a constant stream of whimpers and shrieks, all intermingling in a song of pure need and want and mindless pleasure.
"Yep. Mr. and Mrs. Zorch-skin-burger or something. Anyway, we landed the deal! It's twenty-two thousand so far, but there might be more since I have to dismantle the engine. Twenty-two thousand dollars, Cas. It's the biggest deal we've gotten the entire time we've been running the garage. God, I'm so excited. It's a '69. They only made literally 69 of those. It's like the rarest Camaro out there and I get to work on it." Dean releases a happy sigh, leaning his head back against the back of the couch. Dean can feel Cas smiling at the other end of the phone.
"I would certainly hope that strangers don't routinely stick their hands into your pants in public places. That would be odd."
Morning sunlight is shining through the white curtains and giving the kitchen a dreamy, Saturday-pancake-morning-with-the-happy-couple-movie-haze.
Dean sings along and scrubs the exterior of the Camaro, shaking his hips and admiring the gleam of the newly washed paint, already rinsed off the suds. Cas had to take a phone meeting this morning so Dean came to work early instead of going home. Besides his music and the hum of morning rush-hour traffic outside, the garage is quiet. He needs to replace the alternator on the Z so he can move on to other repairs; he hasn't had the time. Spending time with Cas, dealing with his daddy issues - it's been time-consuming.
"I told you I wanted to get you a collar. I want you to help me design it, and we'll order it. It will be yours. I want you to be mine. If you'd like to be, Dean."
"Uh, first of all, sorry. I didn't actually knock him out. He kind of... fell. Because I punched him. But he grabbed me and tried to throw me. So I, uh, yeah - Anyway, this is my brother, Sam. I'm Dean."
"Was the scene- was the scene okay for you?" Dean asks quietly, trying to keep his voice from betraying his anxiety. Cas puts the spatula down on the counter and steps in front of Dean, placing both hands on his cheeks and looking him in the eyes.
Dean chews his sausage thoughtfully, mulling over the information Cas just gave him. He swallows before he speaks since Cas admonished him for it a minute ago.
“There it is. God, Cas, you’re gorgeous.” Soft lips press against his ass cheek and Castiel can’t help but be touched by the gesture. He whimpers when Dean tightens his grip on his cock. “Are you ready for me, yet? Want me in that sweet ass of yours? I could keep at this all day but it seems like you’re close already, Cas. Gonna cum for me?”
“This is so hot. I’ve never been so turned on making somebody else feel good before. Cas, Cas, please.”
"Yeah. Sounds nice," Dean murmurs, eyes closing and opening slowly. Castiel smiles softly at his exhausted partner. He's adorable like this. He gets a slight moan from Dean as Castiel undoes the knots on his legs, releasing them from their binds. He draws them out, stretching them and checking the muscles for tenseness. He runs his hands over Dean's thighs, squeezing a bit and receiving a whine from him, "Feels good, Ca-Sir... God."
"You gonna drive back to town in that thing? Hurry up!" Dean barks and swings into the driver's seat. He hears Sam exclaim,  'awesome!' as he grabs his bag from the car and locks it.
"Perfect." He murmured and stroked his hand over the dashboard carefully like he was afraid he was going to break something. "Okay, house rules, Cas. Driver picks the music, and shotgun shuts his cakehole. But, since I'm guessing you're a little new to the music industry I will give you the prime opportunity to start your musical education. Pick a tape." He gestured to the small box filled with tapes from his favorite bands. This was his road music, and he'd honestly be happy with anything Cas picked. He loved it all. "Thank you, Dean." Cas started reverently going through the tapes, reading the labels carefully. He read through all of them and then handed Dean one, which made him grin. "I know nothing of music, but this one is intriguing."
"Yeah, Cas. Fuck, you were hurt. You were hurt and bleeding and unconscious and I couldn't protect you. I didn't protect you. I didn't keep you safe, and all this-" Dean gestured at Cas's bruises and disheveled look, "It's my fault. I let it happen, and I shouldn't of. I should've been there. I should've known they were there, dammit, none of this would have happened." Cas calmly sat his bowl on the nightstand and came over to Dean. He carefully grasped at Dean's waist, his palms finding Dean's hip bones like there were magnets attracting them. His blue eyes were wide in understanding, and there wasn't any sign of condemnation or anger. Dean balled his fists at his sides, refusing to hold Cas like he wanted to. Like he needed to.
"Uh, no, I don't guess so," Dean shrugs. He'd love to ask her about the artwork in the room and see if that was her doing, but he doesn't want to be weird.
As it is, Dean’s having a hard time keeping up with what Sam’s saying right now. He takes a sip of his scalding coffee and struggles to tune in.
He laughs out loud at the fact that Dean called him a ninety-year-old woman. Gabriel will enjoy that. He writes his reply out and wonders what exactly he's doing. This could be dangerous. Perhaps he should assign a security detail to Dean, just in case someone finds out about these letters.
Sam left for Stanford not too long ago. The hole he left in Dean's heart is still aching with a wailing solitude, but lately, he hasn't been thinking of it as much. He's been thinking of Cas, who, incidentally enough, is carving out his own niche in Dean's heart. Dean's not even sure if Cas knows it or not. He probably does. Cas is a smart bastard like that. Dean perks up when he hears a groan from the bedroom. Cas's morning voice is huskier than usual, "Marco?"
" Cas punctuates the words with slow, hard rolls of his hips and Dean's eyes roll back in his head. He feels teeth scrape across his throat sharply. "Focus, Dean."
"Please fuck me, Sir. You said that you'd like me begging for your cock, begging for an orgasm I have to earn. Have I earned it, Sir? Will you please fuck me?" Cas closes his eyes and groans.
"Cas. You alive, sweetheart? You with me?" Dean's voice was humorous but a little tense as well. Castiel had to fix that. He tried to talk but his thick tongue wouldn't cooperate. He tried again. "M'kay." Was all that managed to come out form his attempted sentence of  'I am okay.' Dean breathed a sigh of relief against him, and Castiel vaguely realized that he was still being held up, and that he was wrapped around Dean like an octopus, gripping tightly to the black jacket. "I lost you there for a few, sweetheart. How was your tour of the solar system?" When Castiel's rusty brian processes started working again and he understood what Dean was saying he responded, "Fantastic." Dena chuckled against his throat and Castiel realized he was being carried somewhere.
Dean crooks his finger and draws it out of himself, bringing it around for him to look at. The pearly white mess is making his mouth water. He pulls away enough so that Cas can see what he's doing, his black feather-fanned blue eyes wide with disbelief.
"Very. But that's why part of the reason why I want to get you a collar, Dean. You'll know that-" Cas nuzzles against his neck, scraping teeth gently down his skin, "That you're mine... That you're wanted."
"Of course not. But I know you want to try it. To drink from me. I'm allowing you a chance to do it." Dean had to bite his lip to keep from groaning at the words."Cas, you don't know what you're asking."
His boy is all flushed and sweaty, cock already red and leaking. Castiel grins and takes him in hand. He pumps him slowly, luxuriously, and slides even closer to nip at Dean’s collar bone. Dean whimpers as his hips jerk against Castiel’s ministrations.
With consent given, Cas leans back in and nips at Dean's bottom lip. Once, twice, then his tongue is sliding along Dean's lips. He opens them and lets Cas in, reveling in the man's skilled tongue. He could only imagine how that tongue would feel on his cock. Cas bends back a little, their mouths separating, but his hands slide over Dean's chest. "Are you alright with following orders?"
As amazing as it is to work on a legend, he'd still take his Baby over the Z any day. An engine roars outside and he looks up, that sounds familiar doesn't it? Dean shakes his head. It doesn't matter. Bobbing his head to the music, he thinks. The fact that his doctor's appointment is tomorrow is nearly enough to make him sick. He truly doesn't want to go, but he knows he needs to. Hopefully, Dr. Bradbury will be cool and not some stuffy know-it-all.
"Shall we rehash our original discussion about bees?" Dean has no idea what he's talking about for a second, then it clicks. Oh yeah. In the cafe that day. He blushes as he thinks about it.
Dean nuzzles his nose into Cas's throat and mutters, "I guess just because you're supposed to be stuck with me."
Dean cleared his throat and gave him a small smile. "'Cause you're hot, Cas. That's why." Castiel swallowed around an unexpected lump in his throat before speaking.
"I'd really rather not, Cas. It's personal." Castiel sighed internally. "Alright. I understand. Um... Is it safe to assume that I am not going to be a special case?" That broke Dean out of his angry stance and he actually chuckled. "Of course not. I told you, I'm not going to hurt you."
John rolls, and grabs Cas's ankle. He yanks it out from under Cas, sending him into the pavement. John climbs on top of him wicked fast and starts punching him in the face. Dean sees the blood fly from Cas's nose and he sees red. All the fear, all the abuse, it all slides away in the face of this new thing.
"Okay, and how often have you been bothered by moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite – being so fidgety or restless that you were moving around a lot more than usual?"
Teeth nip the shell of his ear, and Dean leans back into Cas, relaxing into the warm words and body behind him. "I endeavor to show you those things, but a physical reminder of it can be a wonderful way to remember. I want you to be mine, Dean. Ever since I first laid eyes on you, I knew I wanted you to be mine, and now here we are. So what do you say, baby boy? Do you want to help me pick out your collar?"
Dean excites Castiel in the best of ways, in ways that no one else ever has. Just thinking about him bound and splayed on display for Castiel has him feeling like magma is pumping through his veins instead of blood. He's never met anyone like Dean. He's sassy and arrogant at times and sarcastic and brash. Yet so incredibly soft and almost delicate at others. His sassy boy, but his kitten as well. Castiel needs to stop thinking about this unless he wants his partial problem to become a full, raging problem.
"Why?" She asks, an amused light in her eyes. He flushes and nearly stammers but manages to keep his words clear.
"Yeah. I really do," Dean implores Cas to understand, "I want this. I want this with you. I just... This is a whole new world for me, and I want you to show it to me. I just don't want you to be disappointed if it goes wrong, or I'm not good at it or something."
He heard a rough cry from behind Gigantor. "Dea-" It cut off suddenly, sending terror and rage coursing through him. Fuck. Cas. He took the bat to the dude's head again and this time he went down, out cold on the ground. Dean dropped the bat in shock at the sight that the big guy had been hiding. Cas had collapsed onto the floor and a guy with a white suit on was standing over him. Bart. Little wifey's hubby. What the fuck? Barty rushed him suddenly and Dean saw with a glint of silver that he was pulling a blade from his suit jacket. With a roar, Dean moved forward and slammed his fist into the guy's shoulder and he heard a loud crack of the bone splintering and disconnecting.
He sighs deeply. He can't ignore the soft request. He looks over slowly, his fist still clenching the faux leather seat hard enough to hurt his fingers. Cas's eyes are kind when he meets them, soft and understanding. "Dean, it's okay."
Dean folds up the chair he's been sitting in today and puts it in the backseat of Cas's car next to the crate with the rest of the vegetables then climbs in the passenger seat. Cas gets into the driver's seat more gracefully and starts up the engine, immediately turning on the air. It's hot outside today, and even though it's winding down to evening now, it's still too hot. It feels like he's been put into an oven and set to bake for a while. He pulls up his T-shirt and uses it to wipe his sweaty forehead, relishing the cool air on his bare stomach for a moment. He pulls the shirt back down and reaches around to grab his seatbelt. When he pulls it over his body he meets very intense blue eyes, staring at him with some burning ferocity. He freezes. "What?"
"What do you call me, Dean?" His voice is rough and grating. Dean can tell Cas is about two seconds from losing it. So, just to be a little shit, he makes his voice
"Cas. Cas. Yes. Please, Cas. Castiel!" He nearly screams at a very insistent rub right across his gland.
He knows ejaculation and orgasm are not the same things, and they can be separate, though he's never experienced it. Oh, God. Multiple orgasms. Shit, he's going to spontaneously combust before the night is out. Dean feels another finger pressing at his entrance, and he tries to relax his muscles to make the slide easier. Nobody's more surprised than him when it doesn't hurt at all. Well, Cas is apparently the sex master. He did say he wouldn't hurt him.
Castiel is sitting on the couch, having finished his article, and Dean is lying with his head in Castiel's lap. "Because we've already scened twice, and you're unaccustomed to the strain. I'm not going to hurt you."
"Fuck, you're amazing." Cas pants and Dean can only agree, just vice versa. He can't believe he was lucky enough to find a sex god of a kinky boyfriend in a coffee shop.
"You act like you're allergic to anything green that's not a pickle, Dean. It wouldn't kill you to eat some broccoli every once in a while or something."
On the phone, a webpage pops up. It's full of pictures of collars! There are all different kinds and styles, and looking at them makes Dean's heart race.
"What, you don't? Dude, did you see his face?" Cas smirked, and Dean realized he was trying to keep his composure. "Oh, it was definitely amusing. I didn't realize a person could turn quite so red. He does an excellent impersonation of a stop sign." That sent Dean into another fit of chuckling and that kept him floating high and happy until he made it to the interstate. After they'd been on the road for a while, in comfortable silence with ACDC filling the gap, Cas asked him, "Where are we going?"
Cas was so close now that Dean could feel his exhaled breaths on his skin. "When you asked me to come with you-you said it was only for the night. But now..." Dean growled possessively without thinking about it. He buried his face into the crook of Cas's neck, his teeth scraping across the skin there. "You're mine, Cas. Not going anywhere, baby." He smelled a faint frisson of fear but it was tinged with Cas's happy smell too. Dean growled again and bit gently, exerting his will to keep from leaving a mating mark. He didn't break the skin, he didn't taste Cas's blood in his mouth, but god did he want to. He could almost taste the slick velvety slide of wet lifeblood sliding across his tongue and down... Mmm. He knew Cas's blood would taste amazing, probably like ambrosia to a vamp if he tasted anything like he smelled. "Dean, your fangs." Cas whimpered against his ear."Sorry." He breathed and made them retract. He hadn't even realized they'd slid out he'd been so caught up. "No. It's okay." Cas leaned his head back and completely exposed his throat to Dean, surprising the hell out of him. Did Cas even realize what he'd just done? That this was an extremely submissive gesture.
Castiel smirks as he tortures Dean with the vibrator, running it up over his turgid cock, and around his balls. Castiel leans back on his heels, not ceasing his motion, but takes in the picture before him. Dean is vibrating with need, trembling, and covered in a thin sheen of sweat. His golden skin is flushed and begging to be licked. His cock is leaking a nearly steady stream of pre-cum onto the floor, gasping and whining on every breath as he thrusts his hips abortively into the air. Castiel is perfectly content on his knees here, watching Dean come apart under his hands.
B: So what're you planning to do with Hot Wings? Did you tell him you stalked him? Or about the intended mate?
"What?" He whispers. "I love you," Cas says again, nuzzling his nose against the back of Dean's head and Dean closes his eyes, reveling in the feeling.
Hot blood exploded into his mouth and holy fuck, it was amazing. Hot and wet and perfectly smooth coppery blood. Cas's blood. He was drowning in it, reveling in it. Fuck, Cas tasted amazing. Dean let the control on his power slip and doused Cas with his scent. Pheremones surrounded him and Cas pushed himself further up against Dean's mouth. Despite him trying to control himself, he couldn't help it. He bit deeper, claiming him with a bite mark that would leave a hell of a scar. Dean wanted it there. He wanted everyone to look at Cas and know he belonged to someone. Belonged to Dean. Castiel Novak was his. His mate. And his alone, and everyone would know now. Another vamp could never touch him without facing Dean's wrath. He would kill anyone that even tried to touch Cas. God, his blood was intoxicating and delicious, just like he thought it would be. It filled him and satisfied him in a way that no other blood ever had, not even after that very first kill as a fledgling. Cas was fucking amazing.
Dean feels blood rush to his cheeks and then he's blushing, still holding the seatbelt like a moron. He lets it go and then cocks an eyebrow at Cas. "Oh yeah? You like what you see?"
People accept his pamphlet and then when he turns around they're crumpled and lying in the gutter. He'd much rather just not litter in the first place. He managed to find himself a stool in the corner at the very end of the bar. He wants one of those blue slushies that he keeps seeing people drink but he'd better just stick with water. When the buff bartender finally makes his way over to him and he orders it the guy just rolls his eyes like Castiel was wasting his time. He probably is honestly, but he's thirsty. He takes a long draw from the bottle and sets it on the gleaming wooden bar in front of him. It's aged and varnished wood, and actually quite beautiful.
Dean growled low in his throat at the words. He didn't even have to hear Cas say them for the words to have an effect on him.
He's not sure Cas is even home. Dean's about to walk off the porch and just go home when the door opens. Cas is standing there in nothing. Almost nothing. He's wearing black cuffed yoga pants, like the ones Sam used to wear, and a black tank-top. He looks rumpled and sexy like he's been working out.
Castiel is clenching down on Dean’s fingers again in no time. He laps at the tip of Dean’s cock and licks up the precum there as Dean adds a third finger. God, it’s tight. Castiel groans as Dean pushes them in further, wider, and his hole
Dean opens his eyes and grins down at a flushed, sweating Cas. He's restraining himself from just grabbing Dean and fucking him with abandon because Dean can feel the vibrating tension radiating from him.
He scanned the area around the car before discovering why Cas had gasped. Zachariah was standing on the sidewalk looking pissed and staring right at Baby like he knew Cas was in here. He really shouldn't be able to tell it was Cas, Dean'd gotten the windows tinted so the sun wouldn't bother him if he had to drive during the day, but Zachariah was friggin' freaky. Dean wouldn't be surprised if he was some sort of mutant or something. Maybe there was some troll blood in there or something, that would explain a lot. "Dean, may I roll down the window?" Dean glanced over at him, surprised, but then put his eyes back on the traffic in front of him. "Sure, Cas." Then Cas did something Dean would never forget, no matter how long he lived.
P.S. By the way, I know next to nothing about apiology. I tried to Google and learn, but as we all know, that's not always the best method. Please remember this is a fictional world and forgive me for inaccuracies.
"Mates." Castiel agreed, hoping they would have the discussion now. He wanted to know. "Okay. First things first, this is a monogamous relationship here. You're mine, I'm yours, either of us fucks that up, there are repercussions." Warmth filled him at the thought of Dean being his.
Castiel steps backward to allow him through the door, and Dean steps inside, looking around. The entrance goes immediately into the living room, and it's an extensive, spacious area blanketed in light pine wood and gorgeous oak finishing. Dean starts to smile as he takes it in, and something warm flutters under Castiel's ribs.
"Mmm," Dean mumbles inaudibly and floats for a while. He's not sure exactly when he falls asleep, but it feels good.
Cas laughs and rubs his thumb over Dean's knuckles, and forks up a piece of waffle. Dean finds himself watching Cas's long fingers grip the fork. It almost seems artful. He has thin fingers. Long, tanned, work-roughened, and beautiful even. Dean's eyebrows knit together, and he looks down at his pants in confusion, shifting in his seat to relieve the sudden pressure in his pants. Did he seriously just get a semi from thinking about Cas's hands? Jesus, he's weird. He looks back up at Cas, looks away from his fucking fingers, and turns back to his plate. Okay. He's good. Just weird. He and Cas start talking again. Soon, he forgets about his mysterious boner and leaves it at the back of his mind for later analysis.
Dean snuggles closer up against Cas's side and hums happily. He's content here with Cas's arm wrapped around him, lying on his chest and listening to his heartbeat. Cas is fast asleep, but Dean's brain won't turn off, so he lays in the darkness, looking up at the ceiling and watching the moonlight dance across it through the curtains. They left the window open for some air, and he can hear crickets chirping. After all the ups and downs of the day, it's peaceful. Dean can still barely believe the reality that is his life. Cas was so... fine with it. He didn't even blink an eye.
“That’s the idea,” Dean laughs and Castel bites down hard on his shoulder. Dean moans and his hips falter in their tempo. Two can play at that game. Dean tightens his fist around Castiel’s cock right as he changes the angle. Now the sensitive head of his cock is dragging across Dean’s skin with every movement. He wants to cry, it feels so good.
"Yes - Yes, Sir. That was... awesome." Dean smiles, and the sight is breathtaking. Castiel shakes his head at himself and starts unbinding the rope from Dean's chest. The light red lines sculpting his skin are not angry and raw, just there, thin and beautiful, showing the design wonderfully.
He finally gets the gown situated, and he sits down on the table. The paper crinkles under him, and he hates it. He glances at Cas for reassurance, and his smile calms Dean somewhat.
"If this gets too tight, or starts to hurt, or tingle even a little, tell me immediately, alright? Can you do that for me?"
"Do you wish that you could take the plug from me? Take it and shove it in your wet little hole? Hmm, greedy boy?" The plug starts sliding in again. Dean clenches down around it, relishing the gradual slide.
"Well, not exactly. I don't take issue with the fact that you always know what I'm feeling, just that I can't. There's a power imbalance here, and you have the upper hand. I'm just this puny little human and I don't understand what you're even doing with me. Or why you would want to mate with me." Dean hauled Cas into his arms and laid down on his back, holding Cas cross his chest. His fingers played through Cas's silky hair as he spoke.
Dean reflexively ducks his head, and heat rises in his cheeks at the compliment, and Cas asks, "What'd I say about hiding from me?"
"It's not something I'm dealing with, Dean. I'm more than happy to take care of you when you need it. It makes me happy. You do. So please stop thinking that you're a burden because you're not."
It occurs to Dean then that he has been really submissive when it comes to Cas. He's literally letting the guy control his orgasm right now. Surprisingly, the thought doesn't freak him out. It only spurs him on. It's hot.
"I don't... I don't know. I just wasn't sure if the scene was okay for you. I know I messed up a few times. I just didn't - d-didn't want - fuck." Dean curses and clamps his lips together. Cas looks down at him, and Dean mentally cusses his thick, stupid tongue. Why can't he just say what he means? And Cas, fucking
like that don't get to have you, you understand me?" Castiel growls against Dean's mouth. Dean moans, and shoves his hips against Castiel as best he can since he's pinned to the pillar, "Yes!"
"You finished, old man?" Cas glares down at him, and even from his position, he can see the wheels turning in his dad's sick brain.
"Okay, Dean. That's fine. Now hush, sweetheart. Just breathe. You're safe with me. I would never hurt you. I've got you."
Both Dean and Cas have a milieu of errands to run, and they end up spending a couple of hours just doing that. Dean has to go pay his electric bill, Cas has to visit his office in the city and return some library books. Eventually, they split ways so that everything can get done on time.
He could accept that. Probably. With some time to wrap his mind around it. The next series of questions was what was troubling him. Dean had said he knew a lot about him and that he had meant to talk to Castiel three years before. He hadn't given a reason for why he disappeared, but then he had felt it necessary to explain that he was in fact not human before he could explain. "Why did you disappear when you helped me up three years ago?" Dean just kind of blinked at him and retracted his teeth. "Really, Cas? No questions, no 'eek, a freak!', nothing?"
They fall asleep curled up next to each other with chocolate-flavored kisses from Cas's bag of mini Hershey's bars that Cas had on the nightstand. Dean raided them. He had questions about why there was chocolate right by a bottle of lube, and Cas had just winked and promised he'd show him later.
Oh, by the way, in the last chapter I totally jacked John Winchester's words from a Supernatural episode. Where Dean is describing vamp weaknesses and nature, those are mostly John's words. No copyright infringement intended, lol. Remeber Alex Annie Alexis Ann from Season 9? Well, in this AU, she ended up being Bobby's goddaughter, and Alex's granddaughter is a hunter that Dean knows and cares about in present day. Just thought I'd throw that in there so there was no confusion. Are we curious about what happened to Sam yet? *evil wink*  It just mentions Bobby and Crowley. Bobby is in Heaven, but I think I'll be introducing Crowley soon. Thoughts?
He knows exactly how hard to swing, exactly how hard to push, taking a submissive to places they didn't even know they wanted to visit. He knows how to test limits, how to keep his submissive guessing, but assure them at the same time that he will do nothing to put them in danger. It's a fine line to walk, and Castiel walks it well. He knows this from years of experience and much practice. After some time, he can make Dean quiver and shake in anticipation and pleasure at the very sound of his voice or the touch of his hand on a bare shoulder. When he's domming, Castiel is clear and clean, and confident. He's sure in his steps, in his walk. His voice demands respect and submission.
is the only word his brain can create and process at the moment. A dude is standing right next to him, incredibly close, much closer than any stranger should be standing. It's the guy with the stubble from the window booth he noticed earlier. His hair is black, and it's everywhere, sticking up in all different directions like he just got laid. His lips look pink and chapped and perfect. Dean finds himself staring unabashedly at this beautiful man. He has the bluest eyes Dean has ever seen, and he can't look away. So when the guy gives him a slight smile, the only response Dean can come up with is a very eloquent, "Uhh."
"What?" Dean asks, beginning to laugh. Cas bursts out laughing, his sunshine smile fills Dean's soul and he starts laughing too. He doesn't even know what he's laughing at, but seeing Cas dissolve into laughter makes him happy, and he feels pleasant and content in the warm shade of the canopy over the stand. Dean wipes away errant moisture from his eye and looks over at Cas, all flushed, tan skin and ruffled dark hair. His eyes are crinkled from either laughter or the brightness of the day and Dean has the sudden urge to kiss him. He doesn't know if it's okay though. They're in public here, a place Cas comes a lot, so Dean's unsure. He looks away and down at the produce, thinking. A voice in his ear makes him jump, "Are the vegetables that interesting?"
Dean wakes to warm breath coming across his face, and it doesn't smell pleasant. He cracks an eye open and chuckles, his throat rusty from disuse. The side of Cas's face is squished against the pillow, and his mouth is open. With the sun shining in a bright halo behind Cas, Dean can see the age difference in themselves. Cas has eye crinkles and forehead lines where Dean does not. He has the tiniest glint of silver at his hairline by his ears. It's almost impossible to see, and Dean doesn't think it'd be noticeable for several, several, more years. But he can see it just now, studying him. Cas's skin is tan, lined, and loved, obviously sun-kissed and wind-hugged. He looks like a man that loves the outdoors, and Dean knows that's true.
"Oh, fuck! Caaa- Mmmmm." Dean closes his lips and moans instead of calling out Castiel's name, but it was close. He wonders if Dean is going to break the rule. That would be fun to see.
"I mean, sure. We got along. After everything happened with Dad and Cas took you home, we got some food. It was so weird eating takeout Thai next to someone like him. He's so... put-together."
Dean grabs his toothbrush and the mostly used tube of paste and hustles back to the bathroom to brush his teeth. The minty freshness makes him feel rejuvenated, and when he throws them back in his bag, he's smiling. His toothpaste bounces out, though, and tumbles under the bed. Dean sighs and gets down on his knees to grab it, sticking his right arm under. His fingers brush something round and smooth, and he pulls it out. Dean stares down at it. Perplexed. It's... a pacifier? It's pink and has a faded purple H written in a curly-cue script on the front part. It's covered in a fine layer of dust. Does Cas... have a kid? Dean's stomach drops, and he feels himself still. Cas would have
His voice was husky and low, and Castiel loved it. "Yes." Castiel wasn't sure of what to do with his hands, but Dean did. His right hand gripped Castiel's hip hard, and his left came up to the nape of his neck, running his fingers over it in a way that made Castiel shiver in anticipation. Dean leaned forward slowly, and then Dean's lips were on his. He had expected something gentle, or maybe soft, he had no idea why, Dean was the literal image of a bad boy, but... His thought ground to a halt when Dean pushed him firmly up against the bricks, and his tongue licked across Castiel's bottom lip, asking for entry he assumed. Castiel opened his mouth slightly and then Dean's tongue was running over his.
A harsh knock on the door sounds right before a wheezing Gadreel pushes it open and comes in, pulling a bloody Alfie behind him. Castiel immediately sobers. "What happened? Report, now."
The sudden clicking of a camera catches him off guard, and he eyes Cas curiously. For the first time, Cas seems to be a little shy, maybe sheepish, as he looks around his phone. "I wanted to catch you laughing. You have a beautiful smile, Dean."
Dean jumps into action and hands the bottle of lube to Cas. As he lubes up the fingers on his right hand, he says, "I think I'll leave these panties on you, baby boy. I love the way they look on you. When did you discover you had a panty kink? Or did you do this because you thought I'd like it?"
Cas groans loudly across the phone, and it spurs Dean on in the most delicious of ways. Dean complies immediately and wraps his hand around his aching cock with an unforgiving grip. He fucks into his hand and then back against his fingers once. Twice.
turn. I'll get what I want later. I promise you that." There's a dark promise in those words. The implications are delicious. A shiver skates up his sweat-slick skin as Cas's finger glances over his prostate again.
Besides, there's nothing wrong with a good hug. If Dean should happen to be trying to suck Cas's lips off his face, that has nothing to do with anything. Cas laughs and squeezes him, then pulls him inside without letting him go. Dean steps back and smiles broadly, liking the light blush across Cas's stubbled cheeks.
KAL and mea, and critterdee_67 and those of you that commented on my earlier chapters, I love y'all too. <3
Dean wakes up with his alarm blaring and his muscles protesting how long he's been asleep. Fuck, he needs to ask Cas what kind of bed he has because Dean's is about as comfortable as laying on a pile of gravel. Dean rolls over and smacks his alarm for it to stop screaming at him and collapses back into the pillow. His eyes flutter closed, and he mentally reminds himself that he can't go back to sleep... Can't go back to sleep...Can't...
The edges of the lapels are a little worn, but it's nothing noticeable. Cas walks over and takes it from him, pulling it off the hanger. His face lights up with excitement and he slips it on in a hurry. The sides curve around him and fall across his muscled body in the most perfect way. It hangs to just above his knees, and the collar is properly turned down. The light tan is a nice contrast to the black henley Cas is wearing, and the buttons are all the right color!
He feels like a kid sometimes, but he won't lie and say that crawling into Cas's lap or being carried is in any way a turn-off. Dean loves that he's smaller than Cas. Dean was wondering if Cas had a bit of a daddy kink because of the baby boy thing but not, which is one hundred percent A-Okay with him.
His eyes were swollen, and his hair was a mess. It looked like he'd been running his hands through it. He was in sweatpants and a t-shirt, which was odd. Dean had never seen him in anything other than a business suit and a trench coat. Good to know the guy did relax sometimes. Dean stepped back and swept his arm grandly towards his modest apartment.
Dean gasped in a lungful of air. Cas-scented air, so it didn't help any. He smelled absolutely amazing right now. Dean couldn't even describe it. Apple pie, and rain, and strawberries and just pure awesomeness. That was the smell of love, he guessed, at least for Cas. And now something acrid was mixing with it. Fear. Dean threw the phone behind him on the bed and enveloped Cas into a giant hug, breathing a sigh of relief. Right now insecurities didn't exist, fear didn't exist. Cas loved him and that was all that mattered. Now
Dean's green eyes ease up from behind the pillow and Castiel can see the happiness gleaming in them. He peeks up over the fabric long enough to stick his tongue out at Castiel, but then he hides again. Castiel laughs and tickles Dean's sides. He squirms and giggles until he's out of breath and yells stop. Castiel does, not wanting to push him too far in such a vulnerable state. He's had a very stressful day.
"You could've fooled me. Do you always run from intimacy? Or is it because you initiated it?" Dean gulps. Fuck. Cas apparently knows him pretty well. Well crap. In defeat, Dean lays his head down on his arms, which he brought up to rest on the counter. He sighs deeply.
"I'm gonna give you a minute, Cas. Just come back when you're done, I'll be in there with the Ice Queen." Castel just nodded in response and he heard Dean's near silent footfalls retreat down the hallway. He walked further into the room, remembering. Here had sat a desk on which everything had been arranged obsessively by mother.
“Christ, you’re so pretty,” Dean whispers. Cas almost misses it as he turns around and straddles Dean in the other direction. But when his brain registers what was said he gives him a soft smile and bends to kiss him. After a minute Castiel pulls away, gasping for breath.
"I don't want to go home. I would like to stay with you if that'd be acceptable." Dean seemed floored by Castiel's admission and then he broke out into a wide grin.
Dean sighs and rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands. He needs to get his mind off this. He has enough to deal with right now. Cas had had to go into his office because they'd called some sort of urgent meeting or something. He isn't overly upset about it, but it's been a rough couple of days. They never talked about whatever Cas was so worked up about this morning, and anxiety is beginning to gnaw away at Dean's insides. Lord only knows what he'd done that made Cas not want to talk to him about it.
Cas smiles and huffs as he carries Dean into the bedroom. They cross the threshold and Cas sets him down on the bed gingerly, showcasing his strength in such a way that stuns Dean to his core.
his mind says. Unbidden, the dream begins to roll through his mind like a black and white film montage, silent and heavy.
Castiel was a little taken aback, but he was curious too. "I would like that. Are you sure you don't mind?"
"That's not quite true, is it?" Castiel's smiling brightly. He can feel Dean's lips quirk up. He gets another headshake, and it makes him laugh. He leans his head forward and nips at Dean's earlobe, teeth grazing slightly. He notes and revels in the shiver that races down Dean's spine. He murmurs into the shell of his ear.
When he woke up it was about an hour later, according to Dean. It had just been a cat nap, but he felt better. Dean had ordered food from room service and Castiel had tried french toast for the first time, which was amazing, frankly. Breakfast usually was either dry toast or bland oatmeal, if he ate at all. He had three servings of french toast, which made Dean laugh. After he had been taken care of in that department, Dean had insisted that Castiel shower.
"Do you want to stay with me tonight? Not... you know, anything, uh... Not sex, but do you wanna sleep here? You can use the couch if you're more comfortable... I just don't wanna leave you alone to deal with everything by yourself. I'd like you to stay if that's okay with you. We can talk and stuff if you want, or watch some Netflix. Whatever you want."
But playing out in the open and having nobody know about it? Hell yeah. The thought of it gives Dean a little thrill.
Dean lays back, placing his head on Castiel's thigh like he was before. "Scoot up a little, and turn on your side." Dean complies, and then his mouth is panting hot breath onto Castiel's cock, and he has a feeling he's going to get hard just from being in Dean's mouth.
Castiel couldn't help the whimper that escaped at the pain and Dean shushed him gently. "S'okay, Cas. S'okay. Just feel. Let go." Like last night Suddenly an entrancing smell filled the air. It was thick, and gorgeous and reminded Castiel of how garages and antique cars smelled. Old leather, and worn wood, and petrichor. It was delicious and he couldn't help but breathe it in deeply.
Dr. Bradbury gingerly opens the door and peeks around. She smiles as she shuts the door behind her and pulls the rolling seat out from under the counter. The tablet she's carrying makes the Tardis sound, and Dean's interest is once again piqued.
"You've done an excellent job, Dean. She seems to be in perfect condition." Dean felt like a maniac but he couldn't help grinning so widely. "Oh, wait till you hear her purr. Sounds like a cougar. Come on, hop in shotgun, hotshot. We're going for a drive." Castiel grinned a wide gummy smile that Dean hadn't really seen in its full glory and it had his undead heart doing donuts, figuratively speaking. Dean slid into the warm leather interior with a feeling of pure contentment, and Cas slid in beside him on the other side. They shut their doors in tandem and without preamble, Dean stuck the key in the ignition and turned her over. Her smooth rumbling sound was music to Dean's ears and he fell in love with her all over again, just like he did everytime he got in her. He looked over at Cas who was a little awed and smiling brightly.
Cas's arm pulls away from his stomach, and Dean misses the security immediately. When his arm comes back, he's holding his phone, and he's unlocking it. "This is what I wanted to show you earlier."
Not that he had any regrets. Not about that particular decision anyway. No, his engagement ring was pretty in the sunlight. Sturdy and solid against the pulse he could feel in his finger if he crooked it the right way - it'd been that way ever since he broke it in that bar fight in Tuscaloosa. The light also happened to fall on his soon-to-be-husband. Dean looked over at his sleeping angel with nothing short of pure contentment. It was rare that Cas woke up before him. Since Cas fell, he's always slept longer, deeper, and harder than Dean ever has. Which Dean's thankful for. He's spent too much of his adult life hiding what he's thinking or feeling, and in these moments he's unrestricted.
"Come on. Come for me, little mate. Do it now. Now, Omega!" Dean commanded, and Castiel had no choice but to obey. The heat in his veins and gathering in his bones exploded out of him. He shot hot come into his boxers and shattered against Dean as he felt sharp teeth crash through the sensitive skin on his neck. He moaned loudly at the pain and the pleasure of it, both sensations warring through his body until he couldn't separate one from the other. Dean's hips didn't stop moving, and the now familiar pull of blood being dragged from his body by a greedy mouth didn't stop for a long time. Dean's hips twitched against Castiel's all throughout his orgasm, and much longer afterward, dragging little whimpers and whines from him because he was so sensitive.
, there's slightly less risk of that, but it can make the symptoms worse, unfortunately." Her face changes to a look of sympathy, and she addresses Dean directly, "This medication might not work for you right away. Or at all. A lot of patients have to try several before they find one that works for them. With Miva, there's an increased risk of mood swings, anxiety, weight gain, decreased sex drive, nausea, and vomiting. It's not a pretty list."
Dean writhes in his bounds, rocking his hips against the vibrator thrusting in and out of his hole. Castiel is holding him against the wall. Even in the ropes, Dean is still moving too much. Not that he cares. Dean has been moaning and shrieking for so long it hurts to swallow because his mouth is so dry.
Castiel chuckles. "That's what I'm doing, sweet boy. I'm untying you, then we're going to go upstairs and take a bath. Then we're going to cuddle in bed, and you don't have to protest that you don't like it. I know better."
"What's the weirdest place you've ever done it?" Dean asks curiously, looking over at him. Cas hums in thought and makes the turn towards the house.
Dean looks up from his plate, where he’d been polishing off his lunch, surprised. It melts into an easy grin. “Yeah, that’d be cool I guess.”
Shit, too late. His fangs descended before he could stop them and he clapped a hand over his mouth, hoping Cas hadn't notice. But, of course, he did. His eyes widened, but not in fear, surprisingly. Just shocked maybe. "Dean, are you... thirsty? Or is the correct term hungry?" Dean willed his fangs to retract again, pissed that he'd lost control like that. Cas seemed to have that effect on him. "Either one works. But uh, yeah."
Dean hums the affirmative and turns his face so he can nuzzle against Cas's jaw. His stubble is rough on his nose, but with all the steam and maybe Dean's current mindset, it feels soft. I love this, Dean thinks.
Castiel knew Dean wasn't exactly telling the truth, he just couldn't pinpoint what exactly he wasn't being truthful about. He decided to drop it for now. He was exceedingly patient, and he would just bring it up again at a later date. If Dean didn't answer then, he would just continue to do that. "Okay. So... What now? I'm not going home...?"
An accidental whine falls from Dean's lips. Cas is so authoritative, even over a text. Dean could easily imagine it being Cas's voice telling, no,
Dean bounces with excitement as he walks through the doorway. Maybe today will be a good day after all.
" Dean tears his hand out of himself and sits up, looking for anything to cover himself with. Cas is standing by the tv, facing the bed, watching him with dark eyes. In desperation, Dean grabs the pillow from beside him and puts it in front of his groin, effectively hiding his still-hard cock from Cas's intense gaze. What the hell is Cas doing here? Dammit, can't he get one night to himself? Cas tilts his head and steps forward. "Would you really rather I wasn't here? I
Dean arches his back and maneuvers his hips back, shuffling his legs further along the shelves. Cas helps him by pushing his knees. He feels his left one brush the wall but lets it slide back down an inch or two. "I think that's as far as I can get."
It turned out that "as soon as he was ready" was about forty-five minutes later. Dean thought it would probably be the stupidest thing on the planet for Cas to go home right now, and Cas had said he didn't really have anything personal at home anyway which just made Dean shake his head in disgust. Assholes. Abusive assholes at that. He shook his head trying to clear the dark thoughts from his mind. If he kept up on that train of thought somebody might get hurt. Now, it was time to introduce Cas to someone very important. Baby. If Cas didn't like Baby they were going to have some major league issues. Nobody disses Baby. He checked out of the hotel, swiping a fake credit card to cover the bill and their tracks, and then dragged Cas outside. Thankfully, Dean had actually thought ahead of time and had parked at the back of the building which was cloaked in shadows. It wasn't like if sunlight touched him he was going to burst into flames, or, God forbid, glitter like a friggin' disco ball like that stupid McDreamy wannabe thing with the fluffed up, fucked up hair from that teen movie. What was it called? Midnight? Something like that.
They make him feel cute. He pulls the bottle of lube out of the drawer on the nightstand and throws it on the bed. Since they were sleeping on the bed sideways, Cas's feet are dangling off.
Dean latches onto the first syllable, though, and manages to get his thick tongue to form words, "Hiya, Cas. I'm Dean. Nice to meetcha."
"He's right. I'm only going to say this once. If you touch a hair on their heads, I will bury you, John Winchester."
"Mornin', Cas," Dean murmurs roughly, and Castiel opens his eyes, peeking out through his lashes for a moment. A sleep-mussed Dean is smiling softly down at him, golden bars of light slanting across his face from the morning sun shining through the blinds. The warm smile he gets when he cups the back of Dean's neck and pulls him down for a kiss makes his insides feel warm and soft.
"Could you uh... not call me that? Right now, I mean." Dean whispers it so quietly that it takes Castiel a moment to understand what he's asking. His brows draw together in confusion at the request. After a moment, he decides to follow his gut. The worst he could be is wrong.
"Are you going to stare at my rear for the rest of the morning? I can pose if you'd like," Cas says without turning around, and Dean nearly chokes on his tongue as he starts laughing.
"I agree. But can we nap first?" Cas laughs and swats him on the butt as he gets up, holding out a hand for Dean, who rolls his eyes but gets up on his knees and walks across the bed to the edge where Cas is standing. He tugs on his hand and brings him closer, then kisses him deeply, savoring the connection. "You were amazing, Dean. You know that?"
His left leg is guided over the soft but firm platform thing, and it's kind of comfy. The process is repeated with his right leg, and now he's being supported by mostly his legs. The backs of his thighs sit comfortably on the padded bars, leaving his ass exposed to the open air. The slack that appeared in his arms disappears with the dragging sound of the rope, and then his body's flush against the wall again, and he's taut with tension. "Can you spread your legs farther?"
rubbing across his pucker. Dean presses his hips into it as much as he can, but Cas's grip on his hips once again stops him.
Castiel winced internally at every sick word leaking from Zachariah's frog-like mouth. He hated to hear him talk about these good people like that. It sickened him that for so many years he had believed everything Zachariah and his mother had preached in their church. But he had a small note of pride for how he had overcome those beliefs and now held his own beliefs. even if he didn't act upon them. This was one of the days he hated the most, honestly. Mardi Gras was tomorrow, and everywhere, the preparations were laid out, and the scent of upcoming celebration was on the air. He hated having to follow Zachariah around and pretend to believe something he did not.
Dean freezes for a second, then he breaks out into a huge grin and throws himself back into the pillows with a cry of, "No, I not!"
Inside the barn where everything began, dust rose in shafted sunlight, and shattered glass littered the floor. Scarred and graffitied runes and sigils painted the walls and ceiling. Candles had been placed on the floor and tables, the ones that had ones held all the weapons that he and Bobby had had at their disposal.
When Dean wakes up, he's drooling onto Cas's shirt, and his eyes feel like they're stuck shut. Despite that, he feels good right now. Cas is warm and breathing deeply underneath him. Dean lifts his head a bit, and he can see that it's almost dark outside now. They've been sleeping for a few hours then. Dean's muscles are sore, but they're a nice kind of sore. His thighs hurt more than anything. Granted, that could be because of the way he's been sleeping and not because of the scene.
How is it that someone he met less than a month ago has become so important to him? He honestly has no idea, and now that he thinks about it, he is kind of scared. He's not going to give it up just because they're moving fast. Cas is the best thing to happen to him ever.
"I know. You may not have a collar yet, my sweet boy, but you're still mine. If I endeavor to do nothing else today, it will be to teach you that."
Pleasure tingles along his bones at making Cas sound like that. Dean pleased him. He feels something soft come up over his eyes, and then a band being slid around his head. It feels almost chilly on his eyes, and he likes it.
"Of course not. Come on inside. You boys like tea?" Castiel climbed the steps and followed her into the house, Dean close behind. "Yeah, we do," Dean said, flashing her a grin. Castiel stepped into the entryway and looked around. There were colorful coats hanging on a coat rack by the door and a jumble of shoes under them. By the looks of the woman had small children. Perhaps they were at school because the house was relatively silent.
"My dad... wasn't a nice guy. I guess he started out good, but after Mom died it just kind of went downhill. I raised Sam, and myself, really. He was a drunk. The short of it was basically - and I don't think he really meant to do it - but one night, he was really out of it; been drinking all day. Sam was about five."
"Fuck," Dean mumbles. That backfired. Then he grins and looks up at Cas. "I guess that makes "baby boy" more accurate, though, huh?"
"Such sweet words," He murmurs. Cas doesn't pull away from Dean's throat as he re-lubes his fingers, then they're pressing insistently, though gently, at Dean's clenching hole. They slide in, and he sighs in contentment. This feels so damn right. It's like coming home. He makes a soft noise when Cas's finger starts circling his prostate, not grinding against it. But rubbing in small circles over and around it. It's driving Dean crazy. He feels a low heat building, and he knows what that means. Fuck. Cas is really going to do this. Cas starts rubbing slightly faster, and Dean
"No. Supernatural hunter. I kill the bad things out there. The ones that hurt humans, and that kill just for the fun of it."
Castiel takes a deep breath, Dean's weight moving with him. He honestly doesn't know how to answer. "Partially, I suppose. I didn't originally intend to come here. There actually is a problem with my car-"
"On your phone?" Castiel interrupts. He does remember Dean sitting next to him on his phone for quite a while.
Castiel grins at his enthusiasm and drops to his knees, not hesitating in grabbing the lube and slicking the fingers on his right hand up. He reaches up with a smirk and begins to circle them around Dean's rim. Dean moans and tenses. "Ah, ah. Let me inside, baby boy. Relax for me."
Dean runs his finger over the heavy paper stock and smiles, "Do you give your number out to everyone that comes here?"
The word has Cas's gaze sharpening, and he asks, "Are you wanting to initiate a spontaneous scene, Dean? Just to clarify."
"It depends on who I'm writing for. I'm doing this because she's my friend, and her words need to be out there. If I write for journals or scientific magazines I do get paid, but this is for a friend."
The next day when Dean wakes up, the first thing he does is take stock of his emotional situation. He feels mostly all right. A little blah, but not bad. He's embarrassed, but at the same time, if anybody had to see him like that, he's glad it was Cas. Cas is sleeping right next to him, and Dean's sprawled partially on top of him. His mind supplies that it would be a good time to slide down under the covers and wake Cas with a good morning blow job, but his body says nah. That's alright. Cuddling is good. It feels nice to just lie next to someone and feel their warmth and heat. It's pretty awesome. Dean moves slowly, so he doesn't wake Cas, but he raises his head and looks up at his boyfriend. He likes the word on Cas.
The words make Cas smile, and they kiss. Their musk-covered tongues taste like remnants of each other. They slide against one another in a lazy, slow dance that has happiness melting ore underneath Dean's ribs. As if by some unspoken agreement, they both whisper 'circus' when they pull away, and Dean grins.
He shuts his phone off and puts it down on the bedside table without a thud. He continues to stare at it for several moments, trying to clear his head enough to even process what Sam just said. It doesn't make any sense. A sticky, almost sickly nausea is building in his gut, making him feel like he ate one too many eggrolls at that restaurant on Seventh Street. With a rolling stomach, he shakes his head and pushes off the bed. Cas is still quietly sawing Z's behind him, tucked under the comforter like a little kid. It's kind of cute. He pads out of the bedroom and into the dark hallway. He sneaks through the house until he gets to the glass door in the living room that leads out onto the back deck. He slides it open with a quiet swish and steps down onto the stained cedar that Cas built his porch out of. Leaves are strewn across the bare boards and hoarded in the corners where it meets the house. Random ones crunch under his feet as he walks over to the rail and leans over it, hanging his head and thinking.
"Well, I thought you wanted my mind out of the gutter. What I wanted to say was that when you're around I'm consistently picturing bending you over every available surface and all manner of dirty things I could do to you. Those cucumbers earlier gave me some thoughts that-"
He whispers the words again, and Cas groans deliciously. He starts fucking into Dean at a furious pace, and sweet fuck, that's amazing. Cas is hitting his prostate every second or third stroke, slowly taking him closer and closer to the edge the more he does it. Then there's a sharp pull on his nipples, and
The way he charged John and just unleashed onto him... Castiel's going to be reliving that moment for a very long time. It was beautiful.
He sighs and sets the cup back down on the counter and pinches the bridge of his nose. Everything with John and the police sapped him of his energy, and he expected that Dean would need some comfort, but not this level of total control from Castiel. He doesn't want to mess it up, otherwise, Dean might not ever want to be little again. His whole body hurts from the fight and his knuckles are bruised and aching. He needs about four more aspirin and a chiropractor, he thinks with a wry chuckle. Oh, what it is to not be young anymore. He hears soft footsteps on the wooden floor and turns around to find Dean there, clutching a pillow to him, looking for all the world like a lost toddler.
As he grows closer, it occurs to him that it's too quiet. There's no buzzing. The silence is a bit unnerving, he's used to the background hum of the thousands of honeybees by now, always flying in and out of the hives and landing on one of eight million of Cas' flowers. He's never really thought about what bees do at night. Maybe they sleep? Dean approaches the second hive in the bunch, he's not sure why that one, but it's as good as any other. He reaches the boxed hive and as his eyes search the top in the moonlight, he spots a lone bee lying on the cover. With furrowed brows, he bends over to take a closer look, wondering if it's dead. After a solid minute of evaluation he decides, no, it's not dead. Just sleeping. There are tiny, minute movements.
"Cas," He whispered gruffly and Cas's eyes shot open. He jerked away a few steps before even giving Dean a chance to speak. "I-I'm sorry! I d-didn't mean- I don't know why- I'm sorry-" Dean walked over to him and wrapped his arms around the panicking man, grasping him in a tight hug. Cas's arms wrapped around him too, despite his freakout. "It's alright. It's alright. Calm down. Cas, listen to me. You listening?"
There hasn't been a lot of time for introspection since he and Dean had started dating. Everything seemed to bubble up inside him with a sense of urgency all the time. Had he stopped to think about what he wanted out of all this? Were they looking at marriage and kids or just a long-term engagement? Castiel has no idea. He couldn't imagine living without him now, though. Dean had wormed his way into Castiel's everyday life in a way that no one else ever had. He couldn't do anything simple without thinking of Dean every time. Even making breakfast, the green of the bell peppers would remind him of Dean's eyes. They fell somewhere between hunter and kelly green, but they seemed to change every time Castiel looked away.
Dean whistles lowly when he sees the car. Holy shit. It's silver beauty. A 1969 Camaro ZL - 1. There were only 69 of them made. It's one of the most coveted Camaros out there, and one of the rarest.
"Sweet boy. So perfect for me. So amazing. Thank you for giving me that. I know you're sensitive here. It's alright. I've got you."
"Am I laughing, brother?" Dean snorted, but Benny was being serious and his humor quickly dried up. "This is important, Dean."
"Okay, so after you pick it up, I want you to go ahead and take one right away to get it in your system. Then start on a morning schedule, and take it with a little bit of food, okay? It doesn't have to be a lot; it could even be a granola bar, just something. I'll want to see you back in three weeks, and we'll see how it's working. Does that work for you?"
Castiel is excited. Too much, probably. Dean's on his way here, and they're going to scene together. Well, that's the plan. It's possible Dean will get nervous and not want to go through with it, and if so, then that's fine. Castiel will be a little disappointed, but not in Dean, just that they will not get to experience that together. He's sure that Dean will enjoy it if they scene. If they scene. Dear heavens, what a sentence. Nerves thrum through him and make his hands tremor minutely. That's not how it will be when they scene.
Dean's checking to see if everything's okay? He must be nervous. Perhaps he needs more time before they scene.
“You get used to it. I think. Hell, I don’t know, man.” Dean swipes a hand through his hair and shakes his head. “Cain is scary though, isn’t he? How’d you manage a night there without freaking out?”
After searching in the bathroom cabinet, every drawer in the house, and in his various jacket pockets, he concludes that no, he doesn't have any aspirin. Which means a trip to the store it is, he thinks grimly.
Want and need was thrumming through him and Castiel's hand grappled on Dean's lapels and pulled him as close as he could. Dean responded in kind by pressing harder up against him and forcing him to bare his neck because Dean tightened his grip on his hair and pulled, making Castiel's hips jerk without his permission. Dean groaned and his mouth traveled down Castiel's lightly stubbled jaw.
Dean shakes his head and stabs a piece of egg with his fork. "Yeah, I'm good. Just zoned out is all. This is seriously good, dude."
He handed the phone to Dean and waited for his reply. Would he be rebuffed? Or what he get what he wanted tonight? Dean looked down at the screen then chuckled to himself. Dean looked over at him with such a look that made Castiel's mouth go dry. It was downright predatory. His stomach dropped and then Dean was pouncing on him, crawling on all fours across the bed, forcing Castiel back up against the pillows, then Dean was straddling him. Dean grabbed his hands by the wrists and pinned them against the headboard with a steely grip. Dean's lips were nipping at his jaw as he spoke, only serving to drive Castiel wilder.
She flits away without preamble, leaving Dean to swallow around the lump in his throat. The door to the room yawns cavernously, and he aches for the familiar inside of the Impala. Cas rubs his thumb across the back of Dean's hand soothingly.
"I love you too." He replies quietly. Cas gives a little hum before promptly falling back asleep and releasing a light snore. It makes Dean smile and he realizes how perfect this feels, it's not a temporary thing. It's not something he can throw away, ever. This is a lifetime love. God, now he sounds like a Hallmark movie, but it feels so right. Cuddled into Cas like this, it feels like home. He always tried to make wherever he and Sam went a home. Whether it was an old house or a motel room, he always tried to make it homey. It never seemed to make a difference with Sam, but the kid deserved a good home. Laying here now, it occurs to him that maybe the old saying isn't wrong. A home isn't always four walls and a roof. Sometimes it's two arms and a heartbeat. This feels like forever. With the warmth of their combined heat and Cas's soft breathing, he's lulled to sleep, the stress just dissolving away under the weight of being so comfortable. He's at home.
Dean looks away and sighs. "Normally, yeah, it'd probably be fine. I'm just... I'm not in a good headspace."
He doesn't even give it another thought, he just throws the car into gear, squealing included, and heads towards Dean's automotive shop.
Pep talks have never been his strong suit. He just says fuck it and pushes the Impala's door open and climbs out, shutting it with a bang that echoes on the still night air. It's a nice neighborhood. And he likes the way the house looks. Big yard, ball goal on the garage. All that suburban shit Dean never thought he'd get to have for Sammy. But here it is. And inside the house he's admiring... there's a mob boss that Dean might just love a little bit. Well, fuck. Nothing to do but to do it, as Sam would say. Dean stills his shaking hands by putting them in his pockets only to draw them right back out again. He's too antsy for this. But if he doesn't do it now, he'll lose Cas forever.
A sudden beeping brought reality crashing back down for him. That was his phone. Oh no. Zachariah. "That damn thing's been going off since last night." Dread was filling him as he realized what was going on. He had never texted Zachariah last night. "I need to text-"
The Carpenters play softly on the radio in the background of Dean's whirring thoughts and his stomach grumbles angrily. Life is against him today. He's just not supposed to tell Cas about his dad. He finally nuts up, only to be interrupted. He sighs and looks out the window at the houses and trees rolling by. It's sunny and bright out, kids are playing in the yards, but it all seems distant from himself. An ache in his ass makes him smirk and Cas catches it out of the corner of his eye.
He pulls out of Dean with careful precision, not missing the slight wince flitting through his blissed-out expression. Dear God, that was amazing. His blood is still singing, and his breathing sounds harsh in his ears. Castiel takes a deep breath and moves around Dean's side, where he's panting. Castiel places himself over in front of Dean and slides the blindfold off his face onto the floor, fingers trailing over his skin. He leans over and captures Dean's lips with his. They're slack at first, but he quickly responds. Enthusiastically. Castiel pulls away, murmuring against Dean's lips all the while. He starts trailing the rope with his fingers so he can begin untying him.
Castiel walks over to the counter where he has the toys he chose for today laying out. He grabs the Paloqueth wand vibrator, a large purple dildo, the lube, and the metal nipple clamps. He turns around and is instantly aroused at seeing Dean spread out and tied up on the shelves, tremors running through him and cock already hard.
He didn't exactly like that idea. "Dean, I-" He interrupted Castiel. "Dude, this is so weird to say out loud. How 'bout we just play it by ear and you figure it out as you go, because honestly I don't know how I can make you understand something this complex without freaking you the hell out, and I'd really rather not do that. You're not going to be made to do anything against your will because I'm not like that. You're mine and I'm yours, 'kay? That's pretty much all there is to it."
"Hey, hey. Don't do that. It's alright to cry, you know. We can talk about it if you want, or you can tell me to go fuck myself and I will, but you don't need to try to hold it all in like that. Believe me, I'm the most emotionally constipated asshole I know, and it sucks." A soft, hiccuped laugh erupted from the other side of the wall and Dean smiled.
He feels a glass push against his lips, which he grabs with a huff because he's not a baby. It's orange juice, and it's surprisingly good. He drains the glass and hands it back to Cas, who murmurs, "Good boy," in his ear. The words send goosebumps down Dean's spine. Then Cas is urging him to eat a granola bar, which he does. It's one of the awesome ones that are stuffed with chocolate chips, and he likes it a lot.
"Yes, and you're not going to hurt them. Come with me, baby boy. I promise it will be worth it. I want to show you something."
"Perfect ass. I can't wait to claim you there. To fill you up with my cock. Would you like that? Hmm? Answer me. Come on, sweet boy. You can't be that far gone already." Dean blushes furiously at the way Cas talks. He's had more than his fair share of dirty talk but, holy shit. Those nasty, wonderful words rolling off Cas's tongue in his sex voice are reducing Dean to mush faster than anything ever has. He struggles to answer.
Prompt from FB group Destiel Forever: Don't embarrass a guy by telling him his fly is open in public. Just be a man, walk over there, and slowly zip it up for him.
"Blood bags? Are you- Do you steal donated blood?" Dean shot Castiel a flat look because his voice was so incredulous.
John laughs, "Yeah, respect. After seeing what he's been up to? I've seen you, boy. Fucking another man, or more likely being fucked. You always were a pussy, even as a kid. I thought I whipped that outta you, but I guess it's time for another lesson." John takes a half step forward.
"It's alright. I'm not leaving you for long. I just have to grab something. Grab the wall." Dean obeys and puts his hands against the wall so that when Cas leans over to get something out of a drawer in the nightstand, he doesn't fall. Then Cas leans back, and he's got a blue tie in hand. Cas presses kisses up Dean's chest, then lightly grabs a nipple between his teeth, pulling slightly and making Dean cry out. Cas pulls away with a smile.
Dean's sleeping. Castiel's not sure exactly what to do. Perhaps he should not let Dean know that he sees Dean sucking his thumb? Should he wake him? He doesn't want to. He's perfectly content sitting here holding him. The need to have the Little talk is becoming more and more of a pressing need. He's not sure how Dean would take it though, and he doesn't want to ass anything else to his already overfull plate. But he doesn't like keeping things from him. He should at least introduce the idea. Castiel looks down at his boy, still rubbing his hand over Dean's strong back, thinking. He does love this man. It's not right to keep things from him. Castiel needs to tell him. But when? Later tonight? Surely not when he wakes up, he'll be disoriented enough as it is. Unless Castiel is mistaken, in times of anxiety and panic, Dean slips into his form of a little space anyway, which is what he believes happened a few minutes ago. As soon as his thumb was in his mouth he calmed down some and he was asleep a few minutes later. As he thinks more about when to broach the subject to Dean, he begins to sing. It's the same melody he sang to him after their session recently, one Dean seemed to like.
Dean sighs but loosens his legs from Cas and puts his feet to the floor. It's warm, thankfully. Dean's eyes are only half open, so the room is kind of blurry. He lets go of Cas and stands there, swaying a bit. He just wants to be close to Cas right now. Luckily it's only a moment later that Cas starts directing him into the tub. Dean steps into the water in front of Cas. The water is hot and glorious as he settles down into it, sitting in front of Cas. The tub is large. It's more than comfortable for them both to be in here. Dean just settles back against Cas's chest and moans at the hot water lapping at his skin.
The vibrations keep getting stronger and stronger until he is almost on the verge of cumming. Castiel backs back down and takes the vibrator away, leaving Dean to shake and moan pitifully, clenching on empty air. His nipples are sore and aching, and every breath of chilled air from Cas's mouth is making him arch and shriek. Dean is pretty damn sure that Cas has been sucking on ice because when his lips wrap around his abused flesh, they are cold like winter air. It feels like a balm to his heated skin. Cas’s arm thrusts forward, and Dean feels his knuckles brush against his ass cheeks. The vibrator changes angle so that it is buzzing right against his abused prostate, the vibrations so strong his body arches off the wall, straining against his restraints and his thighs screaming at the stretch.
"Oh." The simple word seemed filled with emotion but Dean didn't know what. Shiz he was tired. Analyzing everything was frustrating and putting him in a bad mood.
"And yet I am right." Dean just shook his head and hugged Cas again. His heart had slowed to a normal pace, and his scent was right again. He smelled... content. It made happiness thrum under Dean's sternum. After a few minutes, they released each other and got back on the road again, now playing a twisted version of Twenty Questions.
He raises off Dean’s cock again, mouth slack and brain foggy, “God, yes. Just like that. Mmmm. Fuck.”
Sam looks uncomfortable but he smiles sadly, "You'll take care of him, won't you? I mean, you know, long-term?"
"You may speak, Dean, unless explicitly told not to." Well, that's simple. Cas turns round to face him, his eyes bright and wearing a smile.
Dean's stomach drops through his body down into the very bottom of his shoes and his heart stops. His dad is leaning against his truck, black leather against black metal. He's a little more grey, a little more grizzled since the last time Dean saw him. There's a tire iron sitting on the hood, just behind John. His grin sends ice through Dean. It's like a wave of cold water washing over his insides. He was going to use that on Cas.
By now it was an old, familiar anger seeping through his veins about the issue, but it didn't matter. He wasn't ready to make his move yet. But he would. He swore it as he watched Castiel from his hidden vantage point in the trees. He walked into the grey house that he called home, silent and almost small behind Zachariah. "You done stalking for the night, brother?" Benny appeared beside him, smirking. Dean shoved his shoulder more playfully than anything but stomped off into the woods, knowing Benny was following. "I wasn't stalking." Benny laughed heartily behind him. "You keep telling yourself that. How much longer you going to follow him instead of actually doing something, boy?" Dean sighed. This was an old conversation. "Broken record, Benny. Soon, I've told you."
After the last hive is visited, they go inside for lunch, and Dean wants to take a shower. He's all hot and sweaty from standing out under the sun for the last two hours. Dean tries to talk Cas into taking one with him, but Cas firmly says no, and Dean pouts. He perks up when Cas says he has a surprise for him. He wonders what it is, and his mind runs over all the possibilities as he soaps up his body and rinses off. Maybe it's something related to their 'playing.' Maybe it's something for a date. Who knows with Cas?
A sated Dean is a cuddly, affectionate Dean. He's incredibly cute and endearing. As Castiel thinks about it, he notices Dean starting to stir and push the blankets away. He's sure Dean would call him creepy for sitting here watching him sleep, but he was mostly thinking. He doubts that will make a difference, Castiel thinks with a smirk.
As he moved across the bed a strong hand grabbed his ankle and dragged him back, then a large body was draped over his. Dean had pinned his arms under him and he was leaning on his back hard enough that Castiel couldn't move them. He still had leverage though, so he bucked and threw Dean off of him before scrambling off the bed only to be caught again before even taking two steps. He was spun and pushed up against a wall before he could even react and then Dean's smiling face greeted Castiel's cold glare.
And he had been. He had found this place after all. It was a half burnt out old house, but he and Sammy stayed in a back bedroom. It still had a door and everything so they didn't get too cold at night.
But he was nervous. What did Dean want from him? Castiel didn't even know his last name. "Dean? What is this?" Dean gave him a warm smile and leaned back away from him slightly, Castiel immediately wished he hadn't. "It's whatever you want it to be. But if you're open to new ideas, I have a few suggestions." Castiel smiled slightly, intrigued. "Would you inform me of those then?" Dean smirked. "No problem, cowboy." Castiel was going to object that he wasn't a cowboy, but then Dean was leaning in close. He was only a couple of inches away and then his bright green eyes were boring into Castiel's. He licked his lips again and asked in a hushed whisper. "Can I kiss you, Cas?"
"Oh, sweetheart, you're fun to play with." His tone was making Castiel angry. He was not some toy who could be used at his whim and controlled by his ego. He was his own person and he was in control of his life. Not Dean. "Let go of me." He rumbled and Dean just smiled and pressed closer. "Why are you fighting me, Cas?"
"It's just me, Dean. May I come in, please?" There's a long pause. Then a silence. Is Dean going to let him in? The door opens kind of quickly and surprises him. Dean's standing there in jeans and a t-shirt, and he looks tired. Dean gives him a small smile and asks,
“You’re bossy,” Cas chuckles as he settles down next to Dean again. “Has anyone ever told you that?”
This is what was wrong. Cas isn't here. Dean exits the shadowy entryway back onto the moonlit porch and pulls his phone from his pocket. The black screen reminds him how much better he needs to get at charging it.
"Off!" He exclaims, and Castiel laughs and begins unlacing Dean's boots. He takes off his socks too and throws them at the hamper in the corner. He sets the boots on the floor by the nightstand and sits back down on the bed in front of Dean, who's sitting with his legs crossed up under him now, still hiding behind the pillow.
They need to talk about kinks and limits and safewords, and for the love of all that's holy, Castiel's never looked forward to a conversation more. He can't wait to do an actual scene with Dean. One where he can punish Dean for calling him anything but 'Sir,' and test the limits of his endurance. And the aftercare afterward. It's something he's really looking forward to.
He leaves the box on the stoop and doesn’t bother to knock. Running back to his car like a scared 12-year-old doing a ding-dong-ditch has shame rising within him but he simply can’t care anymore. Everything’s fucked, and now he’s alone. Again.
"Uh, yeah, I can see that. Jeez, you been working out or something?" Dean looks him up and down. He's grown at least three inches. He's filled out a little in the arms and chest, but he's still a walking string bean. He looks healthy in the way that young college students usually do. Like you can just tell they've been in the sun, and are full of vitamins and hope and shit like that. Dean chuckles and shakes his head.
"Yeah, sorry." Sam casts Castiel a look before looking away, subtly eyeing Cain, who looks bemused at the situation.
Silence falls, and Dean's entire face heats up as all the blood in his body feels like it rushes to his head in light of the adrenaline rush. He shakes his head and pulls free of Sam's grip.
"So what're the rules for this thing. I'm assuming your bossy self is going to have some." Cas eyes him with a squinted look, almost like he's studying Dean. It makes him squirm slightly.
"What can I getcha, hon?" She asks again, and he remembers he was here for coffee. He squints at the menu above her for a second before ordering a number three.
A pink blush rises to stain Dean's cheeks and he looks down at the rumpled sheets beneath them. "I'm not."
"One I've never had." Dean gasps out, and he delights in the laugh that gets. Even tied to a ceiling, he still gets tingly when Cas laughs. Cas's cock runs over his wet hole. Dean groans at the sensation.
They don't speak for several minutes. There's no need to. When Cas's cock softens, he pulls his hips away from Dean long enough for him to slip out of his sloppy hole and then settles back against him. As Dean comes down from his high, he realizes his mistake, and anger fills him. Fuck. He was doing so good, but then he had to slip up. Dammit. He almost had it. With a huff, he rolls over onto his right side, bringing Cas with him as he goes since he refuses to let go of Dean. He tries to get himself situated, but Cas wraps his arms around him and keeps him held tight. "No. Stay here. You feel so good right here."
. He didn't know Cas would be so picky about a friggin' trenchcoat of all things. They'd been in four different clothing stores already and none of the coats they had found had been good for Cas. "This one's lapels are odd, I don't like it." "It's very grey, Dean." "I don't think having a coat hanging down to my ankles is very smart considering the work we do. That seems dangerous." "Why would it have red buttons?" "Dean, that coat is
"Wow, Cas." He says softly, not wanting to speak too loudly in case he scares the bees. Cas warned him about that. If they perceive him as a threat, they could attack. Dean doesn't like getting bee-stung. His boyfriend is so talented and smart.
"What's next?" Dean asks in a choked whisper. He feels cold metal sliding down his throat, and he doesn't understand what it is until Cas starts swirling it around his nipple with a slight metallic clanking, like a chain. Dean moans when he figures out it's a clamp, raising his head up and flopping it back uselessly. "You want it, baby boy?"
Looking up, he caught sight of the woman who was standing against the stove clutching her heart, pale and terrified. He was in front of her in an instant, dripping malice and anger. He was ready to fucking snap and somebody better be giving him some answers. He crowded into her space and she pressed back further against the stove with a whine escaping her lips. He growled, "You're going to tell me what I want to hear, and you're going to tell me now, or you end up like dear old hubby over there."
"Fair enough. I want the whole truth. I want to know how you know all these things about me and what exactly we are doing here." Dean sighed heavily and rubbed his face with his hands vigorously before standing to walk back and forth across the room again. "Alright. Truth? I know a lot about you. When I saw you like three years ago or whatever I went to talk to you but I- Shit. There's really no way around this."
I hope you liked it, I had a lot of fun writing it and I'm really excited to be getting around to some John and Cas interaction. *insert my evil grin here* As always, if you liked, it, loved it, or just want to say hi, leave a comment! I love reading them! <3 <3 <3 I hope you're all doing great.
She leans forward and asks with a conspiratorial whisper, "I take it you're not exactly a zero on the Kinsey scale?"
Dean makes a needy sound and bucks his hips up into Castiel's mouth. He removes his hand from his cock and uses it to grip Dean's hip. Then he takes all of Dean's considerable length into his mouth and to the back of his throat, swallowing around him expertly.
Well, that's fan-freaking-tastic. Dean just shakes his head and puts Baby in gear, carefully maneuvering her out of the cramped space and eventually out onto the highway. He feels better out on the open road. It's not so constricting and he can let Baby run a little wild. Which is why he ends up speeding a little. Which is why he ends up swinging into the parking lot a little too quickly. He parks carefully and notices Cas has a white-knuckled grip on the door and is looking at him with a confused look. "Dean? What was that?"
Dean shakes his head a tiny bit, making another negative noise. Castiel decides to just go with his instincts. "No, I think you definitely are." He starts to tickle Dean's sides, who gives a very unmanly squeal and sits up, pulling away from Castiel. Betrayal blazes in his eyes and makes Castiel grin. "See? I knew you were awake."
It'd been two months and he still wasn't tired of looking at it. He hadn't ever thought he'd be one to be tied down. He'd thought about settling down with how old girlfriend Lisa once, but he'd never really thought about being married. Not like domesticity and pancakes on Saturday living. That just wasn't the Winchester way. At least not for his generation. His mom and dad though, they'd had the whole kit and caboodle. Two kids, the house and the car, the happy home. He supposed that if they could do it so could he.
Cas looked up at him, and Dean saw happiness brimming in those eyes for the first time tonight. "I would like that very much, Dean. Do you want me to sleep on the couch?"
“Yes,” Castiel nods firmly, deciding fuck it, and reaches out for Dean, who gradually leans into the embrace and then steps into the circle of his arms, leaning his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
"No! God, no, Dean. I had a three-day weekend with no classes so I thought I'd come out and hang around with you for a while. Everything with Dad kind of worried me, so I thought it'd be better just to be here. I called you once I hit the city but it went straight to voicemail."
Just like last time, Castiel is the one at the table when Dean walks in. The coffee shop is full of a quiet kind of life. A couple of people talking at the counter, glasses clinking, a muffled laugh, and a scattered cough. The atmosphere was happier the last time they were here. Summer had been in her last dying days, the sun shining bright and basking the cafe in a golden glow that had surrounded Dean like a halo. Now the mid-September air is gloomy. The sky is grey, clouds rolling across the city as if even they don’t want to stay here. People are quieter, the air more hushed and cold. Castiel is in his trench coat, and under that, he’s in two layers of shirts. He’d be surprised if they had to wait until Halloween to get snow. Based on how quickly it was turning cold, this winter promises to be an ugly one.
"Sounds like it, Judge Judy." Cas tilts his head and stares at Dean with a gaze that seems to go right through him. "You make a lot of television references. Not even good television, I might add."
With all the strength he could muster he pushed Dean way. Which wasn't a lot, and it wasn't very effective, but Dean did stumble back so he counted it as a plus. Castiel's eyes were beginning to adjust to the darkness and he could see the vaguest outline of Dean's profile. It was more like just moving darkness, but he could almost tell where he was. Dean's sharp intake of breath alerted him that he had actually surprised Dean by doing that. At least he could still do that. Not that it mattered. Before Castiel could take another breath Castiel was forced up against the hard door, Dean's frame trapping Castiel between the door and him. Castiel's arms were pinned on the side of the door by Dean's hands. Hot breath puffed against his skin and he could just barely see the glinting of Dean's green eyes in the heavy blackness. Dean leaned in and scented Castiel quite obviously, right above the mark that he had left with his teeth, and Castiel had to stifle a whimper. Dean breathed in deeply then moved his head back to look Castiel in the eye.
"We need to do that. Zachariah will look for me. If he finds me..." He left the end of the sentence blank, correctly assuming that Dean knew enough of Zachariah to know what Zachariah would do. Dean gave a small smile. "Cas, you know the bible right?" Well that was an odd question. "Yes, of course, Dean. I would have been very hard-pressed to not know it after all these years." Dean nodded understandingly. "So, Proverbs 18:21?" Castiel knew it and recited it.
Silence descends onto the room so thickly one could hear a pin drop. It stayed for a beat, two beats, and then- "What? You didn't do that?" Dean questions.
"Tha-thank you, Sir." Dean manages, a small smile gracing his lips. They look dry. "Would you like some water?"
No, the playroom is the place where's he's in control. He designed and built it in the basement after he bought his house. It's a room built for pleasure, built for safety and comfort, and protection. It's a room that allows you to show your most hidden parts openly, without shame. Castiel's already bought and cleaned and stored new toys there for Dean. He had them express delivered from the online site he deals with. They're fast and efficient, thankfully. And discreet as well. Dean should be here soon. Just thinking about it, Castiel has arousal thrumming in his veins and a semi-hard cock in his pants.
Dean just shakes his head. Cas leans over and turns the burners on the stove off, and moves the pans to the back burners. He comes back to standing in front of Dean, and Dean looks up at him, biting his lip. Cas uses his thumb to pull his lip out from between his teeth and gazes at him with eyebrows drawn together. "What is it? What's wrong?"
"Yeah, I'd say so. She's a beauty, sir." The man grins, and Dean knows he says the right thing. He just landed the job. He can feel it.
Castiel wants to say, but he holds his tongue. Castiel is going to lay hands on John Winchester if he ever sees him. What parent leaves a nine-year-old at home alone to watch their younger sibling?! Castiel can feel anger churning, but he stays quiet, listening.
All day long, it's been buzzing voices and ringing phones. The usually comforting sound of metal on metal is still ringing in his ears, giving him a headache. Dean's been strung tight all day, a bowline about to snap, and finally, the tension is releasing.
. Which was ridiculous. He hadn't known him very long at all, and yet... It felt like he'd known him for years. Dean was so incredibly kind underneath that gruff exterior. Castiel felt privileged that he got to see that part of Dean. He loved it. He loved what his strong hands could do to Castiel's body and the things he could make him feel. How he comforted him, and teased him, and broke him out of the bonds he had been in. Or helped him break out of them, rather. If it hadn't been for Dean he would still be trapped back there with Zachariah and the Church. "What is that, Cas?" He felt Dean's nose bury into his neck and inhale deeply.
“I’m fine with that. I’m also starting therapy, by the way, and I don’t want to miss any sessions, so, yeah.”
"Of course. I understand. I'd like to get to know you more too. Do you only want to know of my sexual history?"
"I'm assisting in the writing of an article with a colleague of mine. She's advocating for environmental rights for bee preservation, and she asked me to give my viewpoint. She's hoping to have it published online by the end of the month."
"Dean," Castiel interrupts firmly, then continues in a soft voice. "I need you to breathe, sweet boy. Just breathe for me. It's alright. I'm here, and I have you, and we're okay, no matter what it was earlier." Dean takes a shuddering breath against his skin, and Castiel continues talking. "You didn't push me into anything I didn't want. I greatly enjoyed what we did earlier. Like I always do," Castiel presses a kiss to the crown of Dean's head, "But if you're ready to tell me, I need to know why you initiated that scene. I know something's wrong. I want to help if I can, and I need to understand. Can you tell me?"
Dean rears his head back and slams it into John's. A crack sounds and Dean's vision is spotty, but he ignores it. He rushes against John, pushing him to the ground. Dean pulls his leg back, and without a single thought of the consequences, he kicks his father in the ribs with all the force he can muster. The meaty thunk of Dean's steel-toed boots against John's bones is beyond satisfying. So he does it again. And again. Again. A red tinge washes his vision and Dean can't hear anything. All he can feel is his toes aching and the primal, visceral satisfaction of hearing his father whimper as Dean drives his foot into his body again. Before he's satisfied, strong arms wrapping around him, securing him. Dean jerks and tries to get away, unaware of the tears streaming down his face.
"Hey. Stop. You haven't fucked anything up. If I hadn't wanted you to do what you did that day in the coffee shop I would've stopped you. You're the best person I've ever met, Cas, and I don't regret a thing. Not any of it. And yeah, I'm new. And we did this all weird and it's a little jacked up, but so what? It's us. And that's okay. I mean, maybe it's not like this on your end, but uh, it seems to be working fine to me. And listen, I mean... Cas, look at me."
