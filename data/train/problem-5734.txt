"Come on, Sam…" Steve tried coaxing, another smile finding its way to his lips, "You don't mean that. I'm not mad, we are still friends, right? I can talk to Ross, we can put together a better team, New and better Avengers – you and me and Bucky-"
He dared to open his eyes, blinking them a few times to find a clearing image of Bruce looking at him with his worry lines digging deeper in his forehead than Tony ever saw them. "…Big green…" he slurred, opening his eyes a bit wider, and then he finds the other person by his side, and his heart sinks. "B-Bruce…" he whimpered and lunged at his friend, grabbing at his lab coat in an attempt to pick himself up and move away from Steve who had the same stern and cold expressions as he did in the nightmares.
"I heard you've been giving the nurses trouble with your infamous stubbornness." Bruce quipped as he got closer and put his hand on Steve's tense shoulder, rubbing at it to sooth the muscle. Steve sighed and gave him a thankful smile before returning his eyes to Tony.
Tony was returned to his and Natasha's room the same night, Bruce managed to convince her to stay for further supervision, partly by reminding her she could stay and watch Tony past visiting hours that way. The Black Widow was not the only one on the team who could so easily manipulate people. She seemed to have realized it the moment Clint smirked at her with one eyebrow raised and retaliated with a long, cold stare.
A large bit damaged yet functional War Machine armor stood in sentinel mode next to where Tony's bed would've been had he been there but was now an empty spot. It's empty and emotionless eyes surveying the room and scanning everyone who entered. Natasha, who sat on the bed on the other side of the room, looked at it warily.
His stare followed as Steve walked around the room, fully aware that if the man chose to attack again, there'd be nothing and no one who will save him in the middle of the night. He could press the duress button again – but wouldn't that just put civilians in harm's way? Steve was willing to do all sorts of things to him as he lay dying, in the middle of a battle and with full intent for him to die as a result. Why would he care to go through a couple of friendly nurses in order to get to him and finish the job?
He took him to where the breathing machine stood and placed the mask over his mouth, watching as small bouts of steam covered the clear plastic as Tony took in the oxygen before letting it out again, nearly invisibly breathing. "Call Pepper, tell her… but no one else. No avengers, no press… just Pepper." He whispered as he sat down and placed Tony's head in his lap. "Tell her where we are going, but she shouldn't come over, not yet."
No. no. he couldn't think that way. Mistrust and caution were essential, but also caused the rift between them to deepen further. Whether Tony really was undergoing a severe medical emergency or not, Steve had to show him that he would be there for him, that he would work to rebuild the bridge of friendship and love between them. If Tony tried to do something wrong that would hinder that effort Steve would be the bigger person and deal with it.
"You son of a…" a voice said behind him, and Steve turned to meet the eyes of Colonel James Rhodes – the man's hands clenched at the sides of his body as he composed himself and progressed towards him, his eyes closing as he took a deep breath. "Steve," his voice was icy, causing a light shudder to pass through Steve's body before he could help himself. The use of his first name had caught him off guard, as the Colonel usually referred to him by his rank.  "You were told to keep your distance. Bruce told you, the nurses told you,
"Sir?" Jarvis' voice rung in his ears but had no follow-up, just waiting for him to ground himself and answer again. The AI was prohibited from calling Rhodey or Pepper unless the situation absolutely required it, a panic attack happened too often to warrant it, and Tony made sure to make that clear after too many accidents over the last few weeks.
Bruce reached for a small holographic screen tablet, designed by none other than Stark Industries to function as an easy and accessible patient database for the doctors and nurses, containing their file and recording every medical procedure and medicine administered. The last time Tony received any pain-killers was when he himself prescribed it. No wonder the man looked like he was lying in hellfire. He raised an eyebrow at Steve who looked at him back with clear annoyance in his features.
"I… I don't…" Tony closed his eyes and gritted his teeth. He made too many promises that he couldn't keep, promises he didn't remember making. He knew Rhodey would not lie to him about making them, but his mind pushed the idea of making them into an abyss of uncertainty. "Tell me… tell me again, please." He exhaled the words and looked up to his best friend, who was eating his breakfast in silent, without meeting eyes with him.
It would've been better if he'd just died under that blasted building, if Steve had never been exposed for what he truly was, and could still be part of the team – it would have been better in the long run, the world needed Captain America more than it needed Tony Stark or Iron man or both of them combined. And Steve was right – he wasn't fit to even carry those names now, in this state. It would have been better to have died a hero than be reduced to this, and by insisting on staying alive he was inviting this suffering upon himself, time and time again.
"Sh, sh…" he murmured as he leaned over Tony, his hands moving across the blemished skin covering the now nearly naked Avenger's torso, moving down, trying to get a feeling of every piece of Tony, memorize the way his soft belly felt under his fingers, and the little sounds that were made as one hand sunk lower to touch what it was never allowed before. "Help is coming… I'm helping. Okay, Tony? That's okay with you right?" a single stroke made Tony's head shoot back into the wall behind him – albeit with no great force, and gasp for air when a second one came soon after. Tony was murmuring things again, his eyes were unable to focus as he thrashed his head from side to side, hurting himself, writhing under Steve's touch.
Steve did re-cast them when he came back the night before. He even did so with the efficiency and expertise one could expect of someone who had treated broken bones before, so the end result didn't look bad or unprofessional.  The damage that had been done before could not really be reversed, however – not without surgery, maybe not at all.
The absurdity of the entire situation was beyond frustrating, and the man to blame for everything was lying still on the bed right in front of him, infuriatingly still and silent.
It was frightening. Even when the man was sitting around calmly and talking at them with a familiar smile, there was something… not right all about him, about the way his body moved. It was still Steve – there was no denying that anymore. Clint wanted to be able to deny it, to think there was something else taking the place of the beloved hero or making him act the way he did, but he no longer could, not after seeing that face and hearing his words.
Steve took a step forward. "Yes, Tony. I am… I'm so happy you finally understand." He beamed, "We had a bit of a rough time, but we will do better, the avengers are gone, Bucky is back… everything is going to be much better when it's just the three of us, we don't need anyone else-"
"No- Steve, he IS alive." Bruce was coming out of the building, a rescue team carrying a stretcher behind him, many people were crowding it so Steve and the others could not see the body lying on it or what was happening to it clearly. Steve stared at Bruce for a long moment, incredulous. He knew for a fact that Tony was no longer alive when he left his body inside, he
Soon, he let loose the sounds and pleads that pooled in his throat, he let himself get lost in the pictures he conjured for himself, of youthful fantasies and experimentation, when whoever did the touching did not really matter – just until the point where it did.
There was a general ache all over his body, and a heavy feeling in his stomach that just refused to go away but excluding that and the shrapnel in his chest, he was completely healthy. Jarvis could not detect any signs of mythical creatures manifesting specifically to use him as a masturbatory plaything –and surprisingly enough, there were no signs of a heatstroke or dehydration either.
"If I do that," He started, his voice cautious and his eyes readily searching for changes in Tony's expression, "I need you to promise – and Tony, I mean honestly and with full intent to follow through, no take backs or regrets – I need you to promise you will rest, and take the painkillers. Too much pain is no less dangerous than bleeding, and I can't stress enough how important it is that you sleep well." He watched as the light in Tony's eyes shut off, then the tension in his shoulders became a helpless slump. He wanted to comfort him and didn't know how. "We want you to feel better soon, we want you to be safe." He whispered, "me, Steve… everyone.
The pharmacist was easy to charm, as he did not hide his identity from him and banked on him being an Avengers fan. The man bombarded Steve with questions about the things he wished to purchase. Was the asthma medicine for someone on the team? Captain America didn't need an inhaler, so maybe it was the archer – what was his name again? Oh, right. Hawkguy. Hawkeye? Never mind. For Captain America, it was on the house – the simple, over the counter stuff. Everything else Steve had a good look at, memorized the names and smiled at the pharmacist as he put them back in their place, promising to come back with an appropriate note from a medical doctor.
"When Sam came with me to visit Tony, he thought Sam was going to finish Rogers' Job by killing him." Rhodey had told them when a consensus about Rogers position in the group was met.
He hated Steve. He hated his touch and the way he looked at him tenderly as if he truly loved him, as if Tony could love him back. He hated the words he said to him as he kissed him along the jaw and whispered in his ear and he hated that he couldn't say so.
"Bruce told me he thought you had some involvement, that you were somehow forced to… to do something to him, or to watch, that you were not able to stop what was happening to him. He said Tony was… projecting what happened in his hallucinations into his reality, mixing things up." The man's hands steadied, the shakiness of his form evaporated as he took the steps required to get him one arm length away from where Steve stood. "I have no proof; I can't-do anything to you right now. So Captain… knowing that I believe that everything Tony said about you is the entire, honest truth – defend yourself to me, right now. Explain to me how you justify assaulting my best friend. You can do that, or I can go and get the evidence I need to ruin your entire fucking life."
"It's Colonel to you, Captain Rogers." Rhodes said coldly, "and as I was saying, Tony is entitled to decide if he wants a person who is triggering his attacks with their mere presence to be in the room with him, it is
It was a nice little break from dark thoughts and hallucinations he knew were lurking back inside his head, it kept away the nagging little thought about maybe still not having awakened from his sleep. Being able to answer the nurses' questions put him at ease, at least somewhat. He could recall memories, numbers, and equations. Numbers and words didn't mingle or got confused, memories were not erratic or fogged before the attack and those after it might not have been vivid, but did exist.
"Oh, hey Steve." Bruce smiled, "here to see Tony? he is resting right now but I'm sure Clint and Nat would appreciate the company."
Thor was the only one who'd been talking that entire time, his voice was gentle and not booming like usual – even he looked deeply disturbed and a bit lost. She tuned in to the conversation – a telling of an ancient Asgardian tale Thor hoped would give the others some profound message that would make it all better. It was a nice story, telling of the Dwarves and their mighty forges in Nidavellir. Clearly, in honor of their own Blacksmith/Mechanic, he recounted the many mighty weapons made at their forges, including his own Mjolnir, and wondered aloud if perhaps Tony would like to see those forges when he got better.
The problem was that instead of letting Steve guide him with the same lax quality his body possessed before, Tony chose to grab the shaving knife, and somehow – despite his nylon covered, casted hands – succeeded in the endeavor.
"There's no time for that. Just… what are you running, if not my queries?" he poked the hologram of a process in order to view it, only to be greeted by a blaring alarm telling him his access had been restricted. The Hulk roared in his head. How dare they? He should smash it, destroy it. It was hurting the metal man.
Bucky was admitted into a private mental facility, his care funded by a Stark Industries charity fund. It was all done under the radar, far from prying eyes. And Steve knew, he just did – this was done by Tony, a grand gesture like he loved to do to show his devotion. Another voice, smaller and definitely more annoying, tried to convince him that maybe it was the other way around. Maybe Stark held Bucky as leverage against him, a misguided attempt at provoking him. But even if it was, Steve was far too grateful to fall for it.
"Not that I don't understand the urge, but Honey, what the fuck possessed you to punch Rogers?" Tony whispered as he held Rhodey's un-bandaged hand between his fingers as a cut on his brow was being glued shut, "While you are a very talented, strong, macho man, you are still a squishy human outside the War-Machine armor… Rogers is a super soldier… you… he could have killed you with one punch…" Tony realized he was sobbing more than talking then, and he stopped. Only looking at Rhodey pleadingly. He lost his dignity and humanity, he couldn't lose him too.
Tony must have told Rhodes to deliver the news to Steve, because the glare he gave him had no sort of compassion or sympathy in them towards him.
People were quick to peg him a selfless martyr for the sacrifices he supposedly made – enlisting in the army, letting mad scientists perform their dangerous magic on him, taking on Hydra with limited resources and against orders, Even crashing the Valkyrie into the ice - an act of heroism – he gained from all of those actions. Love, adoration, loyalty so fierce it preserved for years after his perceived death.
Summoning courage and begging himself not to cry, Tony breathed in before letting out a shuddery exhale. "You are being disgusting." Instead of physically pushing him away, he tried a verbal approach and tried not to shudder as two warm hands slid under the shirt he wore – Steve's shirt, drenched in his musk and loose from being stretched across his wide body for too long, Tony wore it willingly, despite the way the scent of it turned his stomach whenever he caught a whiff of it, just to not have to see the old and new marks left on his body from Steve's rough treatment.
"Don't be mad, platypus… I needed… I needed to work. Do something. I can't… be in just that room all the time." Rhodey didn't answer, his fingers moved through Tony's - much in need of a haircut - hair gently, and Tony knew he understood and will not further reprimand him on getting up. "I couldn't make anything…" he whispered, "It's gone, everything… just blank, not there anymore."
"Tony wouldn't hold trusting your friend against you, and I don't either, okay? You've made a mistake, everyone on the team did." Rhodes' voice is calm. Not the stony, terrifying -the calm before the storm- sort, only resigned, tired maybe. "If I said I don't blame you at all, or any of the Avengers, that would be a lie. But I prefer to do this with all of you than without. The only things that matter in finding him, now." He concluded before leaving the room, the heavy boots of the War Machine armor pounding the floor on his way out.
"I'm sorry." Her voice when she sobbed in his ear was something Tony was certain he'd never get to hear, but there it was. And he couldn't even feel a bit smug about it.
. Anything would be better than him just being the same old Steve who had raped Tony to death under a collapsed building. Anything would.
... " Steve hurried to his side when Tony's legs gave out under him. He was freezing after having stood wet and naked in the chilly air of the facility for the last several minutes, his skin was developing a worrying bluish tang of color where he was the palest. Tony writhed under his hands, his fingers clutched on the handle of the knife as he tried and miserably failed to keep it in a threatening position on his throat. It was in Steve's hand not soon enough, after only grazing the skin of Tony's neck twice more.
Not really refused, not that he was on a hunger strike or something. He simply couldn't hold anything down in his stomach.
When Steve talked again, his voice was soft and deceivingly sweet. "You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, Tony… it was the best you could do in such a short time. It wasn't perfect, but it damn well served the purpose we set for it."
He had long given up on the notion that Steve was in any way the same one he grew up idolizing, or even the one he thought he was working side by side with as equals, as teammates and perhaps even friends, the man had proven it far too many times to count by now. But somewhere in his subconscious those images of him still existed, and with every shout he heard Natasha make, the louder the disappointment and outright fear rung in his ears.
Rhodey gritted his teeth. "Why is captain rogers on this list, Jarvis?" he may have sounded angrier than he should have. None of this was the A.I.'s fault.
The silence between them remained consistent for several more moments, and just as they saw Happy draw closer to them with a carton box bigger than his head, presumably full of donuts, Tony broke it.
to die. Steve saw it in his eyes, heard it in the words he said… and he… Steve paused that train of thought. "You said he is resting, he woke up?" he said, turning to find Bruce's eyes surveying him. The man nodded and his features turned heavy.
"Nah." He said, firing-up the repulsors and taking off the ground. He didn't face the others as he spoke. "Get ready, and listen closely. This is how we are getting in."
He made his way to the facility the next day, given the special clearance needed for him to step out of that apartment. He ignored the small cuff beeping around his ankle as he passed the threshold and sending the information to Ross' people, ignored the voice telling him he was just a puppet for the military to play with, now. Once he and Tony were united again, this was all going to resolve itself.
When Bruce got in the room the first thing he noticed was a distinct stench. The nurses didn't really get the opportunity to do some basic hygiene routines for Tony because of the amount of time required for his surgeries and recovery, he smelled like he had just finished a week-long binge in the lab without a shower, the smell of blood and sweat with the additional smell of antiseptic in the air, made it all the more unbearable. He found himself sympathizing with Ms. Song's rant for a moment before laying eyes on Steve.
Not many people were able to take on the Iron man suits, even unmanned. Whoever that person was, he was a lot more dangerous that he anticipated. Strong – yes, but also very determined in his quest to take Tony away, no matter the stakes. "I take it we have nothing on this psycho, Jarvis?"
Steve thought of Peggy, and the Howling Commandos. He thought of Howard Stark. All those people had believed in him, loved and respected him and his decisions, even those they did not agree on in the beginning. They knew that Steve was rarely wrong, that his strategic mind was no less perfected than his body – and their trust in him was absolute to the point of disobeying orders from higher command.
"I… truly thought this would be different. But you could never see, could you?" he muttered, a bark of laughter rolling out of his mouth as he crossed his arms across his chest, while Tony was still lying motionless, scared to move in the wrong way and provoking Steve to touch him again.
He was so tired, he barely grasped the meaning of Pepper’s words. What she thought happened... “That- wait, what? no, we haven’t…” he knew it was meaningless, she’d already made the decision to come over, which meant she was booking a flight as soon as the conversation was over. “it’s not about Steve, Pep. I just needed some me time.”
"I would respect his wishes and get the hell out." Rhodes finally gritted under his breath, and Steve, judging by how the man tensed at his own words and closed his eyes to leave himself vulnerable, knew he wasn't being honest with himself, not at all.
He called Rhodey, finding his voice brittle and weak as he pushed himself against the thin mat his body was propped on. He called Rhodey, and Jarvis – just to hear their voices and know they were okay would have been all he needed to let himself go and fall back asleep. All he got was silence and darkness. Somewhere in his mind, there was anticipation – a predictive, false sense telling him how soon a bag would be pulled away from his head, and people around him will shout at him in intangible language and hold his head straight by pulling on his hair so a camera can catch his likeness. Logically he knew that he wasn't there – he wasn't back in Afghanistan, not in a cave. He knew, logically, that calling out Pepper's name, or Yinsen's, was going to help him zilch… but he could think of nothing else to do.
Everyone returned to the tower at some point during the night, in the morning each of the Avengers, minus Tony and Steve could be found either snoozing away at the common area – i.e. Clint, or eating a small breakfast in the kitchen, i.e. everyone else. No one was in a conversational mood, and no one wanted to look the others in the eye.
Clint got up from where he sat, grasping one of his arrows in his palm so tightly it's metallic form bended a little bit. "If you expect any of us to work with that sick, disgusting rapist-"
"Haven't you heard anything we told you?" Clint hissed from the other side of the room, "Did you even look at the pictures? That man is deranged, he killed Tony Stark. And you want him out there?"
She didn't rush to a conclusion – Tony and Steve had an excellent working relationship, but privately they were a couple of bickering old ladies who could not seem to decide what they should argue about next – yet always finding something. There was a lot of unresolved tension between them, and sure – she could see it grow in one way or another into different things. For Steve that change seemed to have triggered already, maybe for Tony it did not - or did, but in a different way?
They looked into each other eyes, deadpan expressions lasting but a minute before they both burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter, just in time for Pepper and Happy to come back and stare at them and the small metal sphere hovering above their heads in confusion.
Tony stopped asking to go back to the hospital when Steve hit him for the first time the night before.
Of course, if Tony chose not to come, then he would have to go to him, they had to have communication between them if they ever wanted the relationship to work out, they had to meet.
It was fine, he said - tracing the curves of Tony's lower stomach with his hand, Tony was strong. He could endure it just as well. He just had to try and be positive.
Before any of them had a chance to check what happened, Rhodey turned to face them, just barely holding a cellphone in his trembling, injured hand without it falling to the ground. The duffle-bag did fall and clashed against the floor with a deafening metallic racket. His face paled tremendously compared to a minute before that, and the Avengers paused their scrambling around for their gear and information to stare at him.
He didn't remember. All he could remember was pain, and cold, and Steve touching him in all the wrong places, just as he did now. "Bullshit." He muttered, immediately followed by a pained whine when Steve's hand squeezed down on his flesh at the sound of his voice. He bit his lower lip, reminding himself not to do this, not to anger him. Not
He knew she could tell when he was using his Press smile, so he didn't try to use it on her just for the sake of fake comfort. He kept stroking her hair and letting her stay close as the car sled across the road in relative silence, until they arrived at the Avengers tower.
First of all, he had to keep Tony safe. And that meant keeping him away from stress and loud noises, and from the interference by those who did not understand why all of this was necessary. Second… well, he was angry – justifiably so. Tony had shown no progress. He lied, pretended, manipulated him for his own gain once more. He deserved this, and it will no doubly benefit him more than it could do harm, anyway. Steve was even generous enough to let him have the breathing machine with him, so there should be no further complaints once they are secure again, once the Avengers give up and walk away, made aware finally that they were not needed or wanted near them, not at the moment.
Ross growled at him but gestured at his goons to carry Steve out of there. "You will not get away with this, Stark. This is much bigger than your little grudge."
"It's him." She supplied as Rhodey sat through it, watching the pictures change like an extremely slow, excruciating movie. "I worked with Steve undercover - he is very bad at it… changing his posture, his mannerisms. Someone else would not recognize it, maybe. But I am a professional. It's him."
I recommend listening to some Whales singing while you read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=savCAd6RyPI
It took time. Jarvis had to explain several times how to get to the concealed entrance to the room, guide him through a convoluted set of tunnels that started with a secret door in the floor in the living area, and continued for a while. The updated floor plans Jarvis sent to his armor stated the room ended up being right next to the living area, but as the AI slowly and calmly explained – breaking a wall could result in a disaster as the still did not know the exact layout and where Tony was actually at, and pulling a door off its hinges would be far less risky, so they took the longer path.
Rhodey wiped tears from his eyes, gritted his teeth to rid himself of the remainders of rage and self-hatred. This has been just like Afghanistan. The same kind of breakdown. If anyone saw him, they would be mortified that a Colonel in the USAF would act in such a childish way. He was not wearing his uniform, but he was defiling them with his behavior no less for that.
He could make use of the Avengers, the Hulk and Thor at the very least could take care of some of the heavier stuff. He had no qualms about fighting alongside them again. Moral and trust was low between all of them and that was a bad starting point. But he needed them, Tony needed them – even if they didn't even believe in him still being alive, even if they didn't believe in him at all for the better part of their acquaintance.
He was convinced that as soon as Tony saw his new look, he would feel better, the bitterness and the mean words would go away and be replaced by bashful tameness and awe, and they would move on the next part of the night Steve had planned.
Suddenly a hand roughly met with his chest, pinning him down as another went to his pelvic area, pushing his body down against the bed. Tony couldn't scream, he could barely make a coherent sound as his throat felt constricted – like something was lodged in it.
They filled him in, every person in the room adding his or her own tidbit about the occurrences after the Iron Man armor got debilitated with Tony inside it and flung aside. The breach he created in the defenses of the enemy's invasion army – Bruce noticed a slight twitch in Tony's eye when the word
Steve yawned beside him, cutting abruptly his amateur humming as his hand slackened a bit around Tony's waist, allowing him the slightest freedom to move his body somewhat away from Steve's warmth.
Despite everything, he still held on to the idea of Tony by his side, alive and happy. It was still within the scopes of fantasy, as it turned out… Steve wanted to believe otherwise for a while, but was proven right in his precautious thinking – when put to the test, Tony still had enough arrogance in him to deceive and lie to him for benefits, and that just didn't fit the bill of what he was trying to achieve.
The exhaustion roaming through all his limbs convinced him that sleep, rather than food or a bath to wash off sand and salt from his skin, was everything he needed. In fact, he could barely keep his eyes open and his legs dragged under him as he tried to get himself over to his bedroom. Soon, he gave up and practically passed out on the sofa, with the towel around his hips slipping away to the floor and revealing his nakedness, but he could care less about his nakedness. He was just so tired, and it was his home. He could sleep naked on the sofa if that’s what he wanted to do. In the blink of an eye, his eyelids dropped closed before he managed to lean down comfortably on the leather-clad surface of the sofa.
Although, seeing him now walking through the tower like he had nothing to worry about, Rhodey would have rolled his eyes and told him the exact opposite. He was the most idiotic person he had ever met, probably.
"P-… Platypus…" Rhodey didn't even realize his eyes were closed when the creasing of his face eased at the sound of Tony's voice, "You shouldn't squeeze on my hand t-that hard, it was just barely put back together, you know…" Rhodey stared, his mouth agape at seeing his friend laying, now lax and seemingly calm on the hospital bed, ogling at him with those big, brown – almost too expressive eyes that could melt his anger or indifference without a blink, and were always so full of regret and pain and now a hundredfold more so.
Tony nearly missed the sound of something clashing against the wall besides him while wallowing in piteous self-hatred, he did not, however, miss the chirping and clicking made by the thing that created the clash after getting shot out of the small ventilation chute at incredible speed, then hovered while barely keeping its battered form in the air in a jumpy circle around Tony's head, like a cartoon bird circling a disoriented character, which was a rather precise analogy, as it were.
With Tony, his relationship had always been weird. When Steve came out of the ice and was briefed on his future teammates, he was so happy to find out Howard had settled down and had a son who would too provide consulting to whatever team he would end up on. He was then less pleased to find out that said son had all but run his father's legacy to the ground with a frivolous, spoiled lifestyle. Sure – Howard was not much better with his own social life back in the day, drinking and sleeping around, flirting with everything that moved – but he also provided the troops with weapons and protection and had not shut everything down to feed his own ego, as Tony did when he started out as Iron Man.
Jarvis took a moment longer before he replied. "Yes, sir." Then, he piloted one of the suits he controlled to stop Ross earlier and had it softly pick Tony up in its metallic arms. "You are safe now."
Natasha ignored both of them and got up, walking a few meters away to stand by the window and look down at the bustling city-center of Manhattan. "Even considering everything that happened, Steve had been acting… weird." She said quietly, tilting her head to sneak a glance back at the team. "I guessed he was there when Tony got assaulted, I know Bruce theorized the same." She caught Bruce's subtle nod and silently returned her eyes to the window.
"No diagnosis, Steve. Just your opinion." He says quietly, "You were there, and if I can judge by your reactions to anything Tony related in the last few hours, you also saw what happened to him." Steve turns his head now, teeth bared in barely restrained anger. Bruce could feel the turmoil of excitement from The Other Guy, and could only beg to any deity he can think of not to change just right now. "no need to get mad, Cap. I may not be a Red Room spy, but you are not very subtle either." He hurried to say, and Steve seemingly calmed a little, even if his brows were still scrunched in a stern frown.
"You come near the tower – near Stark, and I'll bash your head in with your own fucking shield, man." He said, and left, shutting the door just a bit too harshly behind him.
"Steve!" The voice that startled him came from behind him when he parked his motorcycle next to a pharmacy, he recognized it but did not turn to meet Sam's eyes as he removed the helmet from his head, waiting for his friend to land behind him. "I thought you were looking for Bucky, man. What is going on?"
Steve moved to wrestle the knife away from him; he was unconcerned for the wounds Tony might inflict on him as the serum was guaranteed to heal all by the next morning.
"Awesome." Tony got up slowly, his breath heavy and mind beginning to cloud. He took his oxygen-emitter out of his dash pocket and took a few moments to just breath, ignoring and pained grunts the super-soldier sprawled on the floor, covered with small glass shards was making. He rearranged his clothes, taking special care at smoothing any crumple that could hint at the rough treatment they suffered moments before.
And yet Steve loved him. At first – as he'd love and respect a teammate, a fellow hero. He'd loved Bucky, Peggy and the Howling commandos, he'd loved Howard Stark – and so he loved his son as well. They worked together seamlessly, moved as two sides of the same coin do, and in a fight were unbeatable when they worked together. Soon Steve learned to tolerate and after a while, even like the feisty banter and nicknames, learned to read Tony's movement and predict his moves. They became friends of a sort – as Captain America and Iron Man, Winghead and Shellhead – and that worked.
Bruce's glare was icy and hard, and as he got up from the stool he sat on while taking Steve's blood, he was shivering with rage. "Rights? Steve, do you even realize what you've done? You dare talk about rights after you stripped another human being of his? As for the purpose of this cell – it is meant to hold dangerous things that pose a threat to others. between the two of us, the one whose lack of self-control caused the death of our teammate was not colored green."

He stopped with the paintings and moved on to the work area, where he pushed unfinished diagrams and schematics off the table along with work tools and incomplete stereotypes, he knew things broke when they hit the floor, he knew and he didn't care. What good were any of those things Tony was building – he noticed a schematic for a new rocket launcher for War machine – what good was any of it if it couldn't even protect his best friend?
A sense of impending doom was the exact description of what he was feeling on the way to the tower. And said doom arrived promptly as he watched the video and the still pictures, again and again. Some of the time with commentary from other members of the Avengers, later - alone in his room. A feeling of a noose tightening around his neck every time.
Had the cabin survived it’s meeting with the Avengers, and not demolished thoughtlessly, Steve could have taken Bucky there, to be secure and taken care of, just like planned by him and Tony before everything went bad.
Rhodey stayed quiet, but the look he gave Tony was a guilty one, and his injured hand came to rest on top of Tony's on the bed rail. His eyes alternated from looking at Tony directly to finding any other spot in the room to look at. When the nurse finished treating the wounds and left, he finally spoke.
Of course, the door had been sealed shut and he was trapped inside the small room, which, as it were, Tony had started to realize was way smaller than he initially thought. Suddenly it felt like the walls were closing in on him until vertigo hit and he went down to his knees, covering his head as he closed his eyes and breathed deeply. He heard a crush and a shout, again, it sounded like Natasha. Steve would not hurt her, right? She was one of
Steve caught another glance between the two. "A trial? For…?" he kept his face as neutral and still as he managed, but no one would blame him for the low, gurgling snarl that started to form at the back of his throat. A violent vision of both spies' heads smashed in his powerful fists filled his mind for a moment before he shook it away, feeling the pinch of a twitch in the muscles of his face.
She found Steve standing outside Tony's room, at first glance he looked tired – but okay, but as she got closer she caught glimpses of mussed hair, a split lip and a little bruise on the cheek turned away from her, she went to his side, leaned on the wall and handed him one of the cups. If he wanted to talk – he'd talk. In the meantime she looked around, finding several spots where the struggle was evident, and the worry started to gnaw at her after all.
Once he was in the right mind-set it became easier to just go along with it, ignore the small pained sounds Tony made and pretend they're sounds of pleasure, a proof of him wanting this as well. he pushed against the body under him and then lifted Tony's thighs, pulling them to circle his waist and kissed the lax throat of the body under him again as his fingers fondled and squeezed at the man's balls. A moment when he wondered if he'd be able to arouse his friend in such a state caused him slight anguish until he felt the limp cock firming under his fingers, although slowly. It was all the confirmation he needed to go ahead with this, the knowledge that Tony wanted this too, found what was happening good, too.
Steve sighed in disappointment, with the tone of resignation mothers often have when their children misbehave. "If I have to force-feed you, I swear to god, Tony. I will." His hand rubbed Tony's shoulder where it was bruised an ugly purple and blue, it was the one that got dislocated when Steve had his way with him the first time and was not healing very well due to his constant movement required for his protection against further attempts. Tony gritted his teeth and hissed at the added pressure, feeling the taste of bile on his tongue. At that moment Steve shoved his fingers into his mouth and pried open Tony's jaw, which in turn allowed him enough time to feed him from the canister of soup. After he perceived the desired amount was placed in Tony's mouth cavity, and while completely ignoring his flailing body, held Tony's jaw closed and with his other hand blocked his nostrils until he swallowed. The food in his mouth mixed with the bile that rose as he gagged on it, unable to open his mouth to let it all out, and not able to breathe at all either, Tony worked his throat in attempts to swallow down the entire disgusting mix without gagging again.
The cold look was back in Steve's eyes, the set of his jaw turning firmer and sudden force in his grip over the back of Tony's head. The pain of his firm hold was not as horrible as the rest of the aches all across Tony's body, however it was distinctive - it's warmth and insistence and the texture of the glove striking against his skin, all resulting in a choked gasp leaving Tony's throat. The sudden shift of strength, sending a wave of panic down his spine.
bug going around at that hospital and infecting people? Not that it was entirely impossible, but the chances of that happening were too low to deprive Tony of pain relief after getting his thigh torn apart a second time, it was unreasonable.
"Jarvis… c-call… Rhodey…" He whispered as he absent-mindedly tried to make sense of the words spoken by the TV's newscaster. A serious misconduct within the ranks of the Avengers, no one knows where Captain America is, rumors of a violent confrontation.
Despite his feeling of helplessness, Rhodey managed to chuckle. "You know me so well, Jarv. Turn on the Jacuzzi jets, then."
No one had seen Captain America for the better part of the week, when he showed a picture of Steve in civilian clothes and the 'look' he used undercover, with the cap, hoodie, and sunglasses, people shrugged at him. And the question of
When only stunned silence answered him, Rhodes once again laughed, his breath wheezing through his broken nose. "You all… you work so hard at making up excuses, when you have had the means to prove or disprove Tony's words for… how long now, Doctor? A couple of days at least, since you tested the SAK in the lab Tony provided you downstairs without any of the bureaucracy delaying the process."
Tony seemed to relax a fair amount at his words, and Rhodey smiled down at him as he fell asleep again when he finally heard the sound of the repulsors that indicated an Iron Man armor arrival. This armor was smaller than War Machine, and Jarvis piloted it into the room with little difficulty. It's face unnervingly glared at them before the mask retracted and the front plates of the armor opened to accommodate a body.
get to meet, the man Tony will never, in his life, compare to. He wanted to laugh but even more than that – he wished to just
When Steve came into the room just moments after the nurses left, Tony controlled himself if only barely. He kept breathing the air provided to him at a moderate pace, focused on the burning pain in his throat and chest and everywhere else to remind himself that waking-time Steve was different from sleep-time Steve, and as long as pain was present, and the ability to recite Pi in his mind was not completely gone, this was fine. He was awake, and Steve was just Steve.
It never took. The pain didn't go away; it just went deeper. Every mistake he'd made worsened it still, and at some point, the suits didn't help anymore.
"I was going to make him confess what he did to you… threaten him into giving me proof." Rhodey said quietly, "He tried to convince me that you are crazy and that I am crazy for believing you, and then he said he
Sometimes, Steve pondered his relationships with people in the past. He thought of his drunkard father, and his mom – the sickness that took her from him and plagued his own life for many years, hardened him against difficulty and hardship. He thought – fondly- of his best friend. Bucky was always there for him – always affirming and supportive, ready to defend and protect Steve's choices, even while reprimanding him for the idiocy and stubbornness that led to them.
Steve wanted to do this for so long. He took in the sight of Tony writhing, gasping in his hands, moaning when he added a finger to the effort of stretching him enough. He didn't have lube on him, obviously, so he used spit hoping it's be enough for scissoring and expanding the elasticity of Tony's entrance. He leaned to kiss Tony's forehead, murmured an apology and a plead for tony to be patient, a promise that soon everything would be better, they would feel so good soon. Steve knew he was helping Tony right now, distracting him from the other pains plaguing his body with a bit of pleasure. Tony deserved that, at least.
"Uh… yeah. Usually. I guess he just needed some time alone, you know? After that whole showdown with Colonel Rhodes. I can't say I blame him." Sam sighed, sneaking a look at the exhausted Colonel who leaned against the counter, his broken hand shaking and his face as good as made of steel. "I can't believe he still thinks Steve would do anything like that, even after we told him Steve is not even in the country right now. He is not letting up."
"Hell… this is…" the voice was shaken, still echo-y. Tony heard the words, but couldn't quite process what was said. It was like listening to someone talk from under water, broken up, slurred words.
"Is doing well enough without Captain America." Bruce spat, his stature seemed a bit bigger, and his skin a bit greener, before he inhaled and exhaled slowly and calmed down, "the world doesn't need a murderer, a… a rapist… claiming to protect it."
He would've told Bruce about all the times Tony tried to kill himself in the cabin, and how he stopped him time after time, saved him from the self-destructive tendencies he possessed, how he pushed away the inevitable by caring for him in a way that none of them would, even when it meant to dare use some force to get Tony to comply against his nature. Steve kept him alive, but he also instilled humility in the egocentric avenger, something that was ought to be done long ago.
Tony was losing consciousness, he saw darkness and was pretty sure he was currently burning in the infernos of Hell.
He hardened his expression and abandoned the attempt to appear accommodating. "You are always like that. Always so sure you know
He barely managed to gain support by holding to the kitchen counter and waved away any of the Avengers who rushed to his aid. Shooting vile glares at them. "If you want to help, find Rogers." He said while gritting his teeth. And they looked at him helplessly, still unable to believe that this could be possible, that he, of all people, would do this.
The look in Rhodes' eyes changed, softened and dampened for a moment before hardening yet again, his fists were shaking in complete contrast to the rest of his steady body as he stared at Steve in silent dismay. Eventually, his fists unclenched and he crossed his arms over his chest defensively. "Tony told me all about what he
He made sure Tony would be comfortable and as warm as was possible, and then longingly stared at his lover's lips. They were pale and dry and cold when he touched them, not unlike a dead person's. he reasoned to himself that later he would be able to kiss him awake again - kiss him until the color comes back to his lips and cheeks. Tony could not fight him forever – had to recover soon, even if he could be stubborn for a long time, Steve could out-stubborn him, he could wait.
I've heavily edited the previous chapters and had the story Beta'd by the amazing Serinah and NerdCat who both had done a wonderful job and helped me a LOT, so please send them good vibes and a lot of love.
as I've mentioned before, I'm a student with nearly zero free time for personal projects, so getting this done was not easy, but I'm really glad I did it.
was no longer warranted. They didn't say so to Rhodey or Sam, of course, but sentiment lingered in the air. Tony was either dead or slowly dying, and if he was alive, the chances that he would stay that way were slimming with every moment that passed.
His eyes closed but he was not asleep as far as Steve could tell. Instead, it seemed that he was experiencing one of the panic attacks Bruce had talked about at the hospital.
Tony froze at the invasive touches, he kept his eyes open as Steve leaned in to nuzzle his neck, staring at the ceiling. How long was it since Jarvis told him it'd be twenty minutes until the police arrived? He counted in his mind, letting himself escape from the scenario as the touches became more direct in their direction and intention.
Natasha was released from observation that same afternoon, Bruce went to get a couple hours of well-deserved sleep and put a different doctor in charge.
When Steve nodded sternly, his eyes focusing on Tony and more specifically, on where Bruce was still touching Tony's arm after finishing with the syringe, Bruce let out some held up air. The Hulk felt unsettled – not just angry – he was always angry. This was something else.
"he came in here unauthorized and attacked me, I merely defended myself." He said under his breath, "And made sure he would never do this to anyone else." He turned to look at Ross, watched as the goons picked up the body, Still the one of the super soldier, but not for much longer.
The chase began to look hopeless, and the only one who didn't seem to let that take him down was Rhodey, who kept going out at every woke moment and kept looking.
Rhodey kept quiet, his healthy hand turned into a fist. "It's just the three of us, then." He raised his hand to his ear-piece. "War machine, activate. Jarvis, are appearances by Steve Rogers listed on my navigation systems?" he nodded to himself as the A.I. confirmed, and turned to Natasha. "we are going hunting, War machine will be patrolling and gathering data. I will be driving to places where the likeness of Rogers was sighted. You… either come with me or try to make your dumb-ass teammates stop chasing aliens.
There was something deeply provoking in hearing Ross telling him, about a month after his release, that Bucky had been brought in before he ever had a chance to go look for him again, and by none other than Colonel James Rhodes.
Maybe he should've painted, Tony loved his art, didn't he? He had those doodles of the avengers hanged up in the common room. It was something to consider, for next time.
Rhodey tightened his grip as he listened to Tony's rambles and quiet sobbing. His best friend wasn't the same person. Not like he wasn't the same person after Afghanistan, or after New York – both have left a visible crack in his friend's armor, and on his soul. This time it was nowhere near being just a crack, it shattered him in and out, leaving jagged pieces to be picked up and reassembled excruciatingly slowly, and as time went by Rhodey became more and more convinced that too many pieces were missing now for it to ever be possible. He resented the thought, told Pepper and Happy and the crew of private therapists and doctors who unknowingly tried to convince him to not get his hopes up, not understanding that his hopes shattered the moment he saw Tony in the padded room, He told all of them, and most of all to himself, that it was wrong. That Tony was strong enough to overcome. Tony was invincible.
"It was an interesting time since they separated us…" Steve said, "locked me up… had you make that ridiculous announcement to the press." Tony bit his lip, the words simply did not come to him so he could retaliate. "I almost felt offended until I remembered that what you show the press is not the
It wasn't months, not yet. Weeks? Not many. Tony could still remember the names of the doctors who took care of him at the hospital, and the nurses who looked at him with both adoration when he told them tidbits of gossip and pity when his anxiety caught up with him, he hoped they were all okay, that they didn't get caught in Steve's path or tried to stop him. The thought brought him pain, and he couldn't handle more of it – not anymore.
He didn't like having to think of his team-mates as potential threats, but such evaluation was necessary for a situation like this. He had many times criticized Tony about his lack of forwardness towards the team, the lack of trust that they'd understand and partake in his sometimes crazy schemes. Well, now he understood what Tony meant when he said that they would not appreciate why he had to do things even if they looked a little crazy.
Tony's eyes focused on him, glazed over for a moment, then recovered as he smirked and then chuckled grimly, "No… But you did… you did make sure… he stayed down. Right?" Tony licked his lips, his head hurt trying to recall what Rhodey told him about that moment, when he saw Steve's face and just… couldn't help his rage. Normally he wouldn't have had a hard time imagining it, but nothing was normal anymore.
"Sir," Jarvis voice paused for a moment, waiting for the lightheaded man to tune back into reality "There seems to be a malfunction with the main entrance's doors."
"You just want me to tell you how amazingly skilled you are at creating things that risk your life." Rhodey chided in good spirit, "That cabin was impossible to find, Tones, seriously. You gotta let your enemies get at least a clue if you want things to be interesting… and then getting in, if Natasha hadn't been touched by a divine spirit of wisdom and sent in the robot through the vents, it wouldn't have happened…" his voice turned soft. "Natasha and Barton managed to knock him out, I think it was Natasha who finally did him in with those electrified batons you made for her, I didn't bother to check when I came in."
Rhodes was frantic, and she watched him walk around, calling people on his phone and talking – cool, calm and stone-faced. She watched him relay the news to Pepper, his hands shaking and eyes closing tight when the yells of the woman breached through the speaker, intangible but clear in their pain. She heard him lay out Steve's description to whom he described as friends, people who would give a shit as the Avengers, according to him, clearly did not.
Clint had his mind wrapped and taken over, he saw others under the effects of mind-control and brainwash and this wasn't it. Steve have not changed, only their perception of him have.
"My brother died repenting for his crimes against Midgard, as you well know. I will not hear his name and memory be tarnished this way." He said with a dangerous tone, "Even he would find the act of plundering a man's body on his deathbed deplorable and beneath his honor."
And with Steve, he failed so damn spectacularly, stupendously. He put a tracking device on him, not because he didn't trust that he would do what he said, but because he wanted to make sure he wasn't going to do something stupid, just so he could have an eye on his friend and make sure that he was really alright, come to his aide if he wasn't.
"Do you need to go to the bathroom?" the pacing stopped with those words, followed by silence from both of the people in the room. Tony opened his eyes, the anticipation and dread not yet leaving him completely. Steve was just standing there, however. "Well? I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to avoid a repeat of yesterday." He steadily crossed his arms as he said the words. Tony could feel his gaze going over his features, exploring them.
Nobody said 'Maybe' or 'But'. The Hulk roared and made cracks in the asphalt with his fists, and Clint had to sit on the sidewalk a moment, his legs shaking and eyes unblinking as he covered his mouth with one gloved hand while removing his hearing aid with the other, breathing a little heavily.
So he smiled, and was about to call Steve by some nickname to get him to come over, he wanted to apologize for his little freak-out, get over that one particular barricade on the way to recovery. His words died in his throat all too soon.
"Is it paranoia if someone is really coming after you?" The question left Tony's mouth carelessly as he stepped in in the dark common room of his tower, the Avengers tower, the place that was supposed to be their home and refuge. And instead ended up being a lifeless husk, devoid of life and happiness. Now, lights started to turn on with every step he made, systems coming online one after the other as Jarvis took control of them, after having abandoned them when Tony's stuff were moved out by Pepper's people, when everyone still thought he was dead.
He waited around for a few more hours, buying other supplies. He thankfully still had savings from his work for S.H.I.E.L.D before Hydra revealed themselves, so he could make any purchases he wanted without relying on Avengers resources.
Steve froze a moment, questions running through his mind – how had he not recognized a heart attack? Was Tony faking it?
Rhodes blinked at him, and the corners of his mouth perked in a pained smirk. "What are you talking about? Tony loves attention, the more the merrier." He said, shaking his head as he put his hand on Sam's shoulder in a friendly gesture. "but be prepared, Happy might start crying at some point, and it's not a pretty sight."
Pepper called around noon, snapping Tony out of his nearly trance-like state working on the plans for the new suit. She wasn’t angry, per se, annoyed and worried was more like it, and perhaps a little more than usual.
The ex-Avenger has apparently focused his efforts on diplomacy overseas, where he used his influence and commanding expertise to consult foreign governments on bringing in Hydra Cells currently operating on their turf. Rhodes found Bucky in Budapest, recognized him and managed to get him back to the US safely and under the military's and the press's noses.
Bruce couldn't have that. "I'm sure Tony would be delighted to see you, Steve." He said, widening his smile, "He is alive thanks to you. We wouldn't have found the location until it was too late if you didn't pass us a message, and removing all that debris from his chest probably saved his life even before that."
"Thank me, definitely." Rhodey shot back, taking a bite of the buttered bread in his hand, "They can find out with the rest of the world, when you are better." He peered at Tony through half lidded eyes, finding him staring back at him with a hint of horror. "You are going to get better, Tones. You promised me."
Steve gritted his teeth together and his hand moved again to gain a hold on Tony's jaw, cupping his face to make him look into the blue eyes he was once sure belonged to an ally, but not so much anymore. "Do you, Tony?"
The man was awake, but his eyes were shut closed with his brow creased with lines of pain and effort, his breath was quick and shallow like he was trying to get too much air but was getting too little instead, despite the oxygen mask strapped tightly over his mouth and nose and around his head. He sweated so much a thick sheen made every patch of bare skin of his body shine, he was too pale and his entire body looked tense and trembled horribly.
"He just holed up in there, giving my nurses the 'Captain America' glare and barks orders at them!" Her face was one of pure rage as she talked about Steve, slandering the Captain for about three minutes for the way he treated the employees under her command. She kept on talking for ages, so Bruce couldn't really be blamed for drifting away from the conversation a bit. "-"-Even the Colonel – Bless his heart, he was so polite all the time. He got up and got out of the room when it was needed to change a diaper… even if he did leave that armor around all the time. He let me touch it, actually. Mr. Stark designed that thing – did he not? Such a brilliant young man, so sad, so sad." She shook her head, looking genuinely gloomy on Tony's behalf. "No one deserves what he was through, you just can't go through it and be the same. No wonder he gets panicked."
Tony worked. He used to love working, used to lose his head and sense of time in a flurry of ideas and thoughts. He used to produce plans and prototypes by simply being in a workshop, but now it felt like a roadblock was permanently set inside his mind, so work meant letting Jarvis do simple calculations he used to be able to do in his sleep while he watched the news and tinkered absent-mindedly with a piece of tech he could not remember the purpose of.
." His hand moved, stroking Tony's limp cock with newfound vigor. "You moaned and smiled and you whispered my name, and it took time – I won't say it didn't, but you got hard! And… God, Tony, I know it hurt, I know… It wasn't the best time or place…" he paused to listen to Tony's choked moans as his strokes managed to do what they, scientifically speaking, could not have managed during the first time because that was not how bodies worked – a fact that Steve was not willing to accept. "But you can't say that you didn't enjoy it, you can't say it didn't help."
Tony kept quiet, his breathing heavy and ineffective. He knew Steve had tried to initiate conversation between them, or hear some words that Tony had no intention of ever saying. He lowered his eyes to watch him hook the machine into a hidden, biometric panel protected power outlet and bit his lip at the sound of whirring once it started working. He was impatient and an idiot, which was why he outstretched his hand to take hold of the oxygen mask on his own, only to freeze in that position, when it was unsurprisingly grabbed by Steve first.
He knows Steve understands he should not go to Tony's room again, he knows he understands Tony would not be able to bear the sight of him – and that it's not his fault, or Tony's. he just hopes the man's stubbornness would not compel him to try to change things on his own.
Natasha managed to squirrel away from under the pressure of the shield against her body, rolling to the side. She nursed her arm under her chest, and Steve vaguely recalled that it had broken during the invasion. "You should not be in active duty with your arm like that." He chided, expecting her to smile at him in defiance and keep the banter going, instead she pursed her lips and shot another round of electricity in his direction, which he deflected with the shield a second time.
"Not if I found him," Steve said, and Tony snorted a distressed laughter. Steve didn't seem to notice, "That's what the facility was for, Tony. to have him be comfortable and safe while we-"
Hey guys, so sorry for the late update. I've been swamped with assignments and homework so I had to put fanfiction on hiatus for a while. I am still swamped, and the semester is just now coming to an end (it began late) so there are a lot of big projects and tests that I am currently working on, but I do intend to finish this story, so stay tuned. :)
He squirmed and moaned under Steve's hands, whimpering as the orgasm built up, deliberately hastened by his imagination. He pled for more – faster, harder – And Steve was happy to provide, unaware that it wasn't him Tony was asking this of.
He wiped Tony's face from the sweat that clung to it from before, his gaze hovering over his fluttering eyelids and the troubled creases between his eyebrows, taking them in with a sad smile. bad dreams again – if he only he let him, Steve would've made them go away, Tony could've been sated and relaxed instead of wallowing in this miserable existence.
– moaning and giggling under him as he pushed in, too big to go all at once, an inch by inch turning his lover into a heap of lustful mess. Tony moaned and gasped beneath him, his breath rate too fast and short to be of any actual help to his damaged lungs. Then suddenly he whimpered loudly under him. His eyes blowing wider and filling with yet more tears. Steve made further effort to push inside him now, groaning when Tony clenched around him. "Yes, love… you are so good." He attempted to reassure him when Tony made another desperate sound, "So well… you are doing so well, you know that? Feels so good…" the gasps and whimpers continued and accelerated as Steve picked up the pace, burying himself as deep as he could before pulling put and then repeating once again. "Ssh, sweetheart…" he murmured and brushed his lips against Tony's forehead when a gasp came to close to being a scream, disrupting his fantasy. "Be good. I'm trying to help, ok? Just trying to help."
Sam stopped answering him after that, and Rhodey thought he accidentally driven him away with the bad joke, only for Tony to exclaim half an hour later that he smelled pizza and thank them for being the best friends in the world. Apparently, Sam had taken him seriously.
She finally lost her patience when Tony put back the inhaler and took out his phone, instead. It was already bombarded with any mention of his name Jarvis had encountered online, and about fifty new messages from each one of the remaining Avengers – sans Steve.
Before, he was willing to let Tony die if that was what he had to do to keep his image untarnished in his mind, but after seeing him with the knife to his throat Steve didn't want that to happen anymore, the pain of losing him all over again would drive him crazy.
He scoured the street, went back to the store – the pharmacy, and how stupid was he to not notice that the first time – and found it mugged. He called it in and toured the skies. For the entire night and another half day before returning to the tower, exhausted but unable to sleep.
"Sh… baby, it’s okay… I will help you, make you feel good." Another stroke made Tony freeze, a pitiful sound leaving his throat when Steve mouthed at it, harshly sucking and bruising the skin further. He tasted salty with sweat and blood, and smelled so too, with an addition of another stink Steve couldn't quite place. He imagined he smelled of grease and aftershave, like he thought it must have been like in his dreams… it made everything more bearable if he could picture brown eyes looking at him with laughter instead of crippling pain in them, a hand moving to rest on his back instead of laying crushed and mangled, never to hold another power-tool again. It made it all bearable, a more desirable situation to be in.
Recognizing Tony's distress, Steve smiled calmly and raised his hand to stroke along his jaw and down his neck, disrupting the bristles of facial hair that would soon be gone. "You will look so beautiful, Tony," he encouraged softly, his thumb brushing his lower lips as he leaned in, holding Tony's head still between his fingers without an effort. "Don't worry about anything, all you have to do is stay still."
you are alive because I did what I did, Tony. No one else would have done it for you, they would have left you there to die." He dragged him across the room, letting Tony's lose clothes tangle around his feet until he tripped and fell, only kept from hitting his head by Steve holding him up. He didn't get a chance to collect himself and stand on his own before Steve hauled him off his feet, hoisting him over his shoulder like a sack of flour and knocking what little air he managed to gather out of his lungs.
He couldn't stand it. He held on to the man's sweaty hand, steadying it's acute shaking just barely as he watched him scarcely managing to breathe the air provided for him, crying and attempting to scream at the pain his entirely broken body was projecting. This was everything they were afraid of – Jim and Pepper, Happy too… this scenario of having to watch Tony actively dying or in this unbearable amount of pain was, by Tony's own decree, something that should not have happened. His Armor should have protected him – that stupid, horrible…
When Steve did look at him again, mere seconds later - his eyes were hard and cold like ice, his jaw set the way it usually did when they argued over their many disagreements. Tony became hyperaware of the sound of the soldier grinding his teeth, then sighing exerted and tired. One of his hands was at the base of Tony's head now, caressing softly at his cold, rigid skin. Tony hummed appreciatively at the touch of leather gloves, gaining a hesitant look from the man accompanying him besides his concrete deathbed.
"People are already calling us out for lying to the public about his whereabouts, to them no statement at all
"… Tony? You have to stick with me, don't fall asleep, you can't fall asleep. I will help you. Stay awake."
The only reason Ross knew was because Rhodes decided it was better that Steve knew and stayed put instead of going out to search for his best friend aimlessly.
Bruce looked over Natasha's body, finding more and more evidence of the brutality with which she was struck time after time, the lacerations that were left on her body from contacting the sharp edge of the vibranium shield, and the nearly smashed bones that would be untreatable by regular means. It was a wonder that she managed to remain awake – nevertheless he met her eyes and silently asked for permission before cutting the fabric of her shirt and splinting the dangling arm. He was done just in time to see Wilson dragging Steve's inanimate form through the opened door looking bloody and beaten in a way he suspected the two spies could not have caused, and just barely notice the gun Sam held, aimed perfectly for Steve's knee for the possibility he might wake up and try to run, or worse.
But it was absolutely depressing. Clint had no desire to be the one walking out of there and having to face Rhodes, who had kept his hopes high and refused to even acknowledge the possibility of his best friend not being there anymore. The least he could do was try to look around some more, maybe find something of Tony's to bring back with him, or a clue about the location of what was left. Steve acted and talked like there was nothing wrong at all, like He and Tony were a single entity, or a couple of some sort. It was sickening, but it also meant that perhaps Steve kept something to remember Tony by, something that would keep his sick delusion going.
"Jarvis," He breathed, tearing away more of the singed flesh and throwing it aside, uncovering more of the light metal. "Make a note to find a more… durable solution for the skin."
Tony screamed, well, he tried. And as a result his chest convulsed in a fit of painful coughs and snorts, but that was nothing compared to what the intrusion of his body felt like. His whole body felt as if on fire, as clichéd as that is. A body this broken shouldn't be used like that was what he wanted to tell Steve, only he couldn't speak now. His mind all but shut down all motor functions, he could do nothing but feel pain coming out from every atom making his body. He wished the numbness came back…
… Some suggested the two Avengers had a romantic affair behind the backs of their teammates and had eloped, another suggested that it was actually Iron Man who caused the disappearance of Captain America and blamed a Russian conspiracy, and more ideas of the sort kept polluting the air all around them for as long as TVs were around.
The small wound Tony caused to himself had already stopped bleeding by the time he was done, and barely marred the sight Steve uncovered, which was very satisfying.
Howard was the example that Steve was most fond of – Peggy moved on and got married, Bucky was with Hydra and couldn't remember him – not his fault, of course. Howard? Howard focused all of his resources on Steve, including his own person. He neglected his family, neglected Tony. For Steve's sake. And with the little pang of anger at that mistreatment, Steve found it made him feel… not exactly good; but appreciated, wanted, not entirely forgotten.
"Why do you have to be like this?" Steve's voice was remorseful, deep and heavy in his ear. "Always a pessimist. Can't you at least try, Tony? for me?" Tony shook his head before feeling another pinch, afterwards he stayed completely still. He found himself wondering detachedly if Steve was aware of himself when he hurt him, if it was on purpose or just an automatic reaction. He didn't respond to Tony's whines of pain and did not seem to care for his erratic breathing patterns. Did he think Tony was faking it, still?
Bucky was safe, so he could now, faster than expected, begin to work on his plan to get them all out of there, going rogue, working together with the two people he cared for most in the world without the meddling of outside forces, for the betterment of the world like they had always dreamed of, seemed like a nice enough concept.
"My teammate got hurt, Bruce. How am I supposed to react?" he asked with an exhale of pent-up air. "Tony didn't tell you anything?" Bruce almost got dizzy by the change of attitude that suddenly overtook Steve. His arms were no longer crossed and he was standing straighter, looking directly at Bruce.
Of course, it could be simply because he had to see his teammate all covered in bandages and casts, with the very few places not covered by those otherwise decorated with bruises and cuts. Clint counted them, over and over, his sharp eyes finding every bump or weirdly shaped appendage and adding them to the list of his reasons to kill every single one of the enemies they could subdue alive. Monsters, all of them.
"Steve, did something...?" keeping his voice as soft as he could, Bruce thought back to the meeting of the morning before, how Steve asked about what happened to Tony but did no really seemed surprised, how he avoided visiting for so long and then just suddenly become this protective.
He closed his eyes and bit his lip in an attempt to calm himself, wondering if the shark got spooked by his thrashing and decided not to take a bite out of him  and instead went away, but he didn’t dare look. The salt water he swallowed made his throat scratchy and trying to get his voice to come out was painful, but that was not what stopped him from calling out for help.
"I don't have any tools, don't have anything… I… I can use… to escape… I just…" he gulped down air and nearly choked, his throat felt constricted. "P-please…" Steve increased his volume the more Tony tried to talk, the more he coughed, the more he sobbed. His song started sounding angry, almost vicious, and his hand on Tony's waist tightened its grasp possessively in a way that made the air escape Tony's lungs faster than he could get it in. "Please… just… let me have just one thing, Steve. I promise I will stay, I promise…"
As for the beard, Tony had worse bad-facial-hair-days so he sucked it up. He had no doubt that Steve wouldn't give him a knife to shave with, not even a safety disposable razor. He didn't bother mentioning it.
Tony’s eyes flashed to where the eyes had been, they, and the entirety of the inhuman face – were now gone, replaced by a patch of bubbling water. He opened his mouth and drew breath, ready to scream for his life – when he felt the first tug on his leg, powerful and unrelenting enough to make him lose his grip on the only thing that was keeping him afloat, and he forgot  his resolution to scream and maybe get the attention of his team. Instead, he attempted to regain his hold and kick away the nightmare creature that had its horrible hand on him.
It took Tony a couple of seconds to comprehend what was happening. The little sphere chirped excitedly in his ears for several seconds before he managed to recognize it as the prototype robot Rhodey had shown him, it was a little dented at places, rough handling messing up the perfect metal-work Rhodey had been right to be so proud of – and it was there, now descending into his casted hands, warming the exposed bits of grimy skin as it purred mechanically.
"So we can't just easily hack our way in, then. Uh. It's okay." Rhodey breathed in, panic settling in the pit of his stomach. He'd hoped Tony had left some kind of a back door, a line of code just subtly not completely perfect, just enough for Jarvis to exploit and get in. but it was useless if Jarvis had no access at all.
"Yeah…" He swallowed, his throat dry. "Tell… Tell everyone I'm sorry, okay? I… I tried, I really wanted… but… I don't think I'll be coming home again. Rhodey—he will take care of you, and Pepper too, the tower is theirs, okay? Everything is theirs." it was becoming so hard to breath, he needed the machine to do it but hadn't the strength to crawl over to it. He felt weighed down, and the walls… they were closing in on him, the room felt so much smaller suddenly, but the distance from where he had sprawled when he fell to the machine and nest of blankets seemed to only get much bigger.
When he followed the tracked signal from Steve's jacket, the Avengers found it on a surprised, terrified out of proportion teenager's shoulders, who apologized and begged and explained that didn't actually steal it - in that part of town nobody would have let go of the opportunity to steal a bike with the keys left in the ignition, so he was actually just keeping it safe from actual thieves. The kid squealed in fear when the Hulk pounded his fist on the asphalt and growled at him and they let him run off.
At the moment, Tony's vital signs were going crazy; the man was trying to breath normally where his body was currently getting its oxygen from a chest tube, and he was definitely panicking. Bruce vaguely remembered Tony making an offhanded comment about third-rate anesthesia wearing off too early to expose him to the horrors of open heart surgery in a cave in Afghanistan. Bruce thought he was joking, back then. Now he wondered how he could ever consider anything coming out of Tony Stark's mouth a joke. The man has been so brutally honest, always coming on too strong… too strong for some people. Not for Bruce. He adored it, he found it amusing, even when the self-deprecation was so evident in the genius' words.
"You are fucking insane." Rhodey told him when he came back to the mansion, finding him sitting in the dark, like a parent waiting to reprimand their rebellious teen for staying out the entire night. "What do you think is going to happen now, Tony? this is worse than actually telling a terrorist your fucking home address, this is worse than getting kidnapped – this is going crawling on your knees back to your fucking kidnapper and kissing them on the lips and begging them to take you back- that what this fucking was."
"Mute." Tony whispered, raising a hand to massage his temple as the AI's words cut off. "Sorry, bud… just… just do what I told you to do, okay? Direct all resources there."
His skin pinpricked with goosebumps and he shivered.Even though he felt boneless and there was barely any strength left in his muscles, he still managed to curl his legs closer to his body in a semi-fetal position.
He didn't speak, it seemed that Steve needed to unload some crap, and Tony hoped to find a justification he could agree with. Aliens made him do it. He was an alternative Steve from another dimension. He was brainwashed. an
Steve didn't feel up to it, he looked up at his friend's face and smiled weakly, apologizing. "I just… I need to stay around here for, well, you know. There's still a lot of paperwork to fill." Sam nodded, he probably knew Steve would be worried about Tony, but the real reason still eluded him.
He was leaving. Tony felt a wave of relief followed by a tsunami of anxiety. Steve was going away and Tony would have to stay in the small building alone, barely able to walk, barely managing to breathe. And who knows when he would come back and what he would do then.
He was pulled away from his thoughts by Steve's lips on the corner of his mouth, a peck inquiring for permission for further access. Tony closed his eyes and pried his lips open. To let him taste what he made Tony swallow, maybe. Because he was scared of what will happen if he didn't… maybe.
Steve did feel the sting of guilt in his chest when he thought of his teammates. He wished that he could let them in on his plan and showed them that it was the best scenario for everyone, for himself and Tony, obviously, but for the team, for the world as well. Everybody would benefit from this, eventually.
One final tug on his leg pulled him further down, a long and bony arm wrapped around his midsection to assist the other one, and the last traces of oxygen Tony managed to preserve was gone as he was pulled  towards the dark depths of the ocean.
There was so much stress in his muscles he thought he could break someone's bones without any help from the Other Guy, as puny as he was in this form. he was holding back on Him, and the Hulk didn't like being held back, it didn't like that his Metal-Man was hurt and sad, he wanted to
Bruce didn't believe him, neither did any of the other Avengers. None of them would make an effort to keep Rogers away – and it was clear that they, in fact, could not. Captain America was the leader of the Avengers, the man with a plan, the symbol. Tony was never supposed to even be an Avenger; he wasn't fit for it. Narcissistic, so self-centered he was willing to rip the team apart over what might have been a dream or a misunderstanding.
Instead, all the words remained inside his mind, boiling and turning into rage like water turns to fumes.
It was also unapproachable, surrounded by hidden weapons and alarm triggers. They spent two days just scouring the area, finding the location and trying to find a flaw in the design. There wasn't one.
Tony stood silently and listened as Steve kept rambling on. It was a scary thing, hearing the plans Steve had and knowing how horribly twisted the execution of them will be. He wanted to take Barnes too, probably wished to make him heal the same way he tried to make Tony 'heal', slowly killing him in the process.
The Avengers kept insisting that he was dangerous. Stark industries were pouring money into the efforts of lobbying against him. Thankfully, the people did not agree. It was in the news almost daily. Tony's Press conference when he came back from the dead got dissected, every detail about his looks, his words, and even the watch he wore on his wrist were supposedly meaningful enough to warrant a panel of men discussing it at length for hours, all getting it wrong. The billionaire's refusal to give further comments on the matter has given even more fuel to the conspiracy theorists.
A wave of panic tore through Tony as he momentarily stopped breathing again. "What…" he breathed deeply and blinked before he saw Steve's hand move toward his face, and immediately retreated from it almost unconsciously, his eyes moving from the outreaching hand to Steve's now frowning face. His breathing was suffering from the shocked state the question placed him in, and the words nagged at his mind and chased away any other sobering thought he managed to stack in there before.
When they got to the hospital, they found Pepper – and a giant teddy bear in Iron man colors, and a two bouquets – one of the flowers and one of red, gold and silver "get well" balloons, all held awkwardly by Happy Hogan, who looked like he had not slept in a week. When Rhodey offered to relieve him of at least some of his burdens, the bodyguard shook his head and frowned in full offense.
His murmured rejections went unanswered as Steve leaned down, his free hand cupping Tony's chin and cheek to turn his face for a breath-stealing kiss, just like before. Silencing him and ignoring any complaint that was impossible to make.
Clint had always been clever, he picked up her lack of answer and knew what it meant, and they continued stalking toward the hut, managing to avoid traps and a few more shooting guns, which were then disabled using most of the special arrows at Clint's disposal. He was left nearly empty-handed when they finally reached the spot where the partial floor plans claimed the entrance was. There was no indication of that on the outside, however. What they saw and unfortunately smelt seemed like nothing more than rotting wood panels.
"Sir, the police forces outside – they were dismissed by general Ross. His tone may indicate that he is displeased. He demands access to the tower immediately."
"I just… he suddenly started shaking, thrashing all over the place." Steve murmured, "I tried to keep him calm and used too much force when I kept him from climbing-- falling off the bed—and the stitches just tore." A guilty undertone slithered into his voice as Tony's body reacted to his words by giving another intense shudder, "the oxygen mask fell when I tried…" another shudder, Tony moved his head slightly to the side and if even possible, the creases in his brow deepened even further.
Sam confirmed the words with a grimace, remembering the shift on Tony's face – from excitement and happiness for his friends being there and the pizza, to a frightened child crossed with an angry lupine creature who would have pounced him had he not left immediately.
"We vetted all the doctors here, Dr. Garcia was one of the surgeons who operated on Tony, they're very accomplished and knows what they're doing." He said with the same frostiness he used on Ms. Song a few minutes before, only to regret it when Steve looked at him with injured baby-blues, like an over-grown Labrador. "Steve, I understand how you feel. I am worried for his well-being too but I can't- I will not be here all of the time, we can't be here all of the time. Tony is due for a long recovery period and at one point or another a different Doctor will have to take care of prescribing his meds and taking care of him and we will have to trust them."
"But you do." Finally, his voice rasped dryly as he opened his eyes and looked straight at Steve. The uneasiness in his gut burned. Steve looked at him in surprise, as if not accustomed to get replies from Tony. then he smiled and his face lightened up the way it would have months ago, as they joked with each other or had some rare, cute conversation about their lives. For a moment, the monster turned back into the Steve Rogers he knew.
A part of him kept wondering if any of it could ever be fixed. The uncertainty was maddening – at least in Death Tony could have spared him that feeling of unrelenting hopelessness. Now that the man hanged on the line between life and death, stubbornly refusing to choose one of the two, Steve would have to either be patient and see what happens or…
The two spies exchanged subtle glances, Natasha's face remaining stony while Clint's frown deepened and eyes darkened. "Cap…" This time, it was Hawkeye who addressed him, shaking his head slightly, "Steve, please. We can still try to fix this." He said with a voice emotional and dreary, "at least… we'll make sure you are treated with respect and dignity and get a fair trial. Alright?"
If before there were whispers of speculation still making rounds, now the audience fell entirely silent, waiting in anticipation for him to talk. From the corner of his eye Tony captured the doors open, and saw the curly red hair of Natasha as she hurried inside, finding the horrified, angry stare she froze while bearing.
, Tony. you already know that I don't like it this way." He leaned in, crushing Tony against the wall and sliding his hand further down, his grip on his collar loosened a bit as his strength rerouted to his torso and hips, grinding and pushing Tony against the wall.
When he shut down again, muttering and rambling on and on Bruce decided to just let it go. He made sure once again that all the machines were properly hooked and attached, and that all the wounds were clean and freshly bandaged to his satisfaction. Tony was shaking under his hands the whole time, keeping his eyes fixated on Bruce as if to convince himself that he wasn't anyone else. He also kept talking without so much as a break to breath, only inhaling once every few moments as if trying to keep sleep away with the mere power of gibberish rambling.
"…Bruce. Wasn't the hologram enough? Haven't you ever watched Rogers spar?" it was Natasha's voice that answered him now, but he could still hear Rhodes muttering about it being useless in the background. "Look again, bring in Clint to take a look. It's the same brawler style Rogers uses when he fights without his shield, it's the same body type. There are still pictures too, I'll send them to you if you want an actual look at what was happening." She somehow almost sounded desperate in a weird and unsettling way. "Please, if you really want to help Tony, stop repressing what your gut tells you, stop wasting time."
Fear settled deep in Tony's gut. 'Protect him'? did that mean he'd have to stay inside, closed off from the world again? Rhodey would not do that to him, he would not force him to stay. Of course not. But if Steve was out there, if he was coming for him… what else? Three suits of armor could not keep him safe, Rhodey could not stay by his side all the time, Rhodey could not stand against Steve, the super soldier, the American Icon that was loved and revered as a hero still if he came for them. He would get hurt again because of him, because he was protecting him…
"I'm going to buy us… like, a hundred pizzas." He declared as he stood up. "This hospital food is disgusting, Bruce." He said when the man's condemning look stuck to him, "Rhodey probably hadn't eaten all day, and I…" he bit his lip and closed his eyes, "I need to do something. I can’t be useless right now."
"Yes, Sir. The arm's repulsors seem to function perfectly well and on cue, power levels are raising quickly and will soon be at ninety-five percent."
– But that too had soon dwindled, sightings of Steve were non-existent from the moment he left city limits in a stolen car – which they found drowned in the Hudson River near New Jersey, of all places.
The silence between them for the next few seconds was eerie, both sets of eyes burned into the other person with intense emotion – anger, hostility, just a tiny bit of fear… the room seemed darker around them as they each tried to keep their demeanors frozen and unyielding, refusing to break eye contact before the other person did, refusing to let another word cut the silence, as if in admittance of some offense.
"Your beard is turning grisly." He mentioned as he swiped the towel down Tony's hollowed cheeks, soaking remains of thick soup from his beard and picking out unidentified bits out of it. "It's too long and mangled. Doesn't that bother you?"
"You never told them you found me." Tony said, carefully, as Rhodey came to sit by his bed, holding on his lap a tray with a varied breakfast on it, for his own sake, as Tony was still being given nutrition through a tube. Tony didn't even look at the food. "They don't even know I'm alive yet... I knew you can be petty, Honey-bear, but that is…" he closed his eyes and breathed deeply, "I don't know if I should be mad or… or thank you…"
"Barnes was lucky it was Rhodey who found him." He replied, his voice gaining volume and stability as he turned his back to Steve, keeping only an eye on the super soldier, "Anyone else, and he would have been detained…" slowly stepping away from the desk, Tony made his way to one of the cabinets on the opposite wall, attempting pointlessly to ignore the sound of Steve's steps right behind him, keeping the exact same distance between the two of them.
The hut was rundown, oozed decay and filth. It was hidden in a patch of lame forest not too far and not too close to the city, and appeared on no satellite map Jarvis could pull up. It was almost impossible to find – all records of it were wiped from the databases at the tower, Jarvis could barely pull up any backups of the floor plans, and even those were incomplete.
The way he felt, then, when he saw Bruce comforting Tony, was less envy and more… a grudge - maybe - of some sort.
"I hate you. Hate you. Hate you." Tony repeated the mantra as Steve carried him to their bed, dressed him in warm, clean clothes he'd bought on his outing and tucked him in under warm and thick blankets. He suffered through the repetitive chant, only sometimes interrupted by a cough or a series of dry heaves onto the air. The bluish color of Tony's skin was not going away, in fact it got slightly more pronounced around his lips and fingers, he was shaking uncontrollably now, his heart beat loud and faster than normal.
He couldn’t hear Jarvis’ reply, if there even was one. If Jarvis wasn’t alarmed, it meant nothing bad was happening. He was okay... The whales were back –he was okay.
Tony inhaled it hungrily and reached to grab with flimsy fingers at Steve's wrist in an attempt to convey his need for it to stay where it was and not move away.
Once he finished the sandwich the helmet closed over his head once more, and he headed to the lift-off area, preparing to leave again.
The location is nice – quiet, but not too far from the city. The road is not too bumpy and his motorcycle rides on it well enough, even if the ride is not the smoothest he ever made, it's not the worst either. There are roads in Brooklyn that are more or less the same, so it's really fine by that standard.
was wrong with him, but something has been wrong with him since New York. Nightmares were just nightmares. His existential crisis wasn’t something that medication could fix.
"Tony, Tony." He held the man's and gently and felt his fingers curl against his palm, Tony's eyes roamed the room blindly before fixating on his face, he repeated the man's name in a whisper and let his other hand wipe a tear that run down his cheek, "You're safe, you're okay now. I've got you, I got you Tones…"  the machines beeping calmed the more he talked, his friend's eyes trained on him and his hand clutching desperately to Rhodey's. someone pulled the curtain around them – Bruce, he was standing on the other side of the bed, preparing a dose of Valium to put their friend down again. Tony seemed unaware of him; of anything, in fact. His lips parted then closed again like those of a fish out of water behind his oxygen mask, and Rhodey's heart shattered at the pain his eyes expressed, or the way he tried and only barely managed to squeeze his fingers around Rhodey's.
Some part of him wanted to believe that the person who did this to Rhodey was not his teammate, was not the person who assaulted him, was not… waiting outside his room again. A shudder caused him to bury his face in his casted arms against his knees, not really crying – not in the ugly sort of way. For a moment he still wanted all of this to be a dream.
Seeing Tony like this – happy, relaxed and not so much in pain as he looked when they got there seemed too good to be true, and as with most things that seemed that way – it really was so.
"And yet you begged for me to do this? Do you think I am stupid, Tony?" Steve rolled him so he laid on his back, his other hand – the one that gave him the hand-job just moments before, covered in his spill, held to his chin to keep him from looking away. "Who was it? Who were you thinking about?"
The expression on Steve's face remained neutral during Tony's thrashing and honest effort of breathing properly, he remained unfazed by the noises Tony's throat was making while trying to draw down air enough to keep himself alive. Just like before he seemed undisturbed by his teammate's peril.
For Steve it was different, Rhodes knew from debriefs about the Winter Soldier – both from the Avengers and the military, that Steve had been chasing a man who did not want to be found. He was relentless, convinced that he was the one person who could get his friend back from the clutches of Hydra by sheer force of stubbornness. It didn't matter much that the man, by all known reports, had long been out and on the run from both Hydra and the Avengers, wanting to keep to himself and be peaceful – Steve wanted him back, and he was determined to get him no matter what.
His breath caught in his throat and his knuckles tightened around the edge of his board, he felt something… something scaly and slimy brush against his legs and his entire body instinctually flinched. A primal instinctual force took  control of his motor skills as soon as his mind had failed, and at that exact moment the Mesmer broke, Tony took a shaky breath, and another - when something sharp – teeth, no. a… a hand?
Some people on the team said this was just the pair of them flirting – but Sam saw, well… Sam experienced Steve's form of flirting, and had seen the way Stark could schmooze reporters and young fans until they all had hearts in their eyes, and from his point of view flirting was not really what he would call those interactions between the two.
Rhodey looked back at Sam as Tony struggled to get his breathing back in order, the man looked scandalized and hurt and shook his head at Rhodey while mouthing that he had no idea what Tony was talking about.
Steve smiled at him warmly, knowing he had a friend who believed him was really comforting. "Are you saying or asking, Sam?" he said, placing his own hand on Sam's arm when he sighed in relief and smiled back at him. It seemed that he successfully countered the question.
When Steve tried to sooth Tony by putting a hand on his shoulder and saying some comforting words, Tony's entire body pulled away from him at once, and his words turned from silent murmured intangible grumbles into cries of rejection. "Tony, you have to calm down." Steve tried more assertively, his hand found Tony's arm, and he pulled it back, which made Tony's voice go silent abruptly.
He had a hard time pointing out what was causing him to feel like someone sneaked a cube of ice down his collar when Steve met his glare with his eyes, genuinely questioning the reason for their being there, berating and bantering as if in the middle of practice as he re-broke Nat's hand under the weight of his shield and body. It was still him, by all accounts. Clint prided himself with a sharp eye and some decent spying skills, but he still felt that if he didn't know what Steve had done he'd have no way of knowing that something was wrong. The tone of his voice when he talked, the set of his jaw when he glared at them with a frown were the same, his body language did not change.
"What have I done?!" He whispered mid laughter, his breath whistling with effort. "I… I done nothing. Steve. There was nothing I
I meant for chapter 20 to be the last chapter, but then it got so much longer than I planned, so consider this ending part 1?
There wasn't much more to do in the room, he just had to survey the bathroom, imprint every single terrifying detail into his psyche, and then he would re-join the fight, and they will take the super-soldier down.
A few years ago, When Sam was still in the military, Tony Stark announced he was shutting down weapons research and development at his company. A few days after that, Iron man was revealed to the world, and the man came out as the new superhero with a statement few people were able to ignore.
But no amount of preparation could help him process what he saw when he came into the room, nothing could ready him to the sight forced on him or to the reaction of his body to its existence. He couldn't control the gritting of teeth at the sight of the nearly skeletal body and the visibly distorted arm in an insufficient and dirty cast that could do no more for its recovery than leaving it bare could, he couldn't stop the tears at the sight of  deep colored bruises on far too pale skin, he couldn't stop the turmoil of his stomach culminating finally into a gag in his throat when his eyes finally caught on and reached the face of the body he was looking at, unable to make a connection to who he knew as Tony Stark.
Tony bit down and gritted his teeth, trying to stop more voices from coming out. as far as Steve was concerned, physical reaction meant he was enjoying this, meant that it wasn't against what Tony wanted. Even if the reaction was completely imaginary – even if Steve was making it up to rationalize the rape.
He wanted to do it peacefully, sit everyone down and talk about what had happened, he just wanted to do it after he and Tony had their relationship figured out – but was he ever given that opportunity? From the moment he realized he was given second chance at it, at every turn, someone was there to stop him from talking to Tony. of course, at first it might have been for the best; he was misguided. He thought Tony could not possibly be the same anymore, that his Tony was already - and should stay – dead. There still was a sliver of that thought hanging in the back of his mind, bugging him. But… he couldn't really let him go again, not without knowing, really knowing if there was anything, even the slightest reminder of Tony in there.
Despite Bruce's assertion that Rhodey had to sleep and eat, he found himself unable to. He had Jarvis order something in but had not taken the takeout out of the containers since the night before.
friends, helping with his campaign to extract the Winter Soldier from Hydra's grasp and taking down Shield and all those other things they did together. Her relationship with Steve was not based on her spying on him when they first met, at the very least.
It took a while. Rhodes insisted Tony needed him there – what if he woke up with another anxiety attack? What if one of his too many enemies decided to take advantage of the situation? His voice was laced with sleep-depraved paranoia. Bruce told him he would be no help to the man if he got hospitalized due to exhaustion, and Steve interjected harshly that the man
"Oh Tony…" Steve's eyes softened when Tony finally managed to move one hand enough to grasp on the wrist of the hand at the base of his neck. He leaned down above him, each of his eyes meeting Tony's with a noticeable frown. He sighed – or groaned as his other hand moved up and down Tony's thigh. "I was afraid you'd be broken now; you know? I thought you wouldn't try to fight anymore. That you'd just give up?" His voice was soft but had an undertone of rancor, and Tony couldn't linger on his words because his mind was going so fuzzy and wrong with the lack of air. "That'd be just the worst, wouldn't it? It would be the least Stark thing you can do. He never gave up, did he? So how could
Back to the shout. It sounded familiar, it certainly did not belong to a man, so it wasn't Steve's voice. But Tony couldn't fathom where he'd heard the voice before then, and was baffled by its existence. His curiosity was what compelled him to eventually abandon the rare comfort and warmth that surrounded him and struggle to get up on his knees, blinking away the remains of sleep from his eyes. He wanted to stay where he was, just wallow in the comforts and warmth of the blankets and forget whatever nightmare had caused him to wake up, but then he heard another shout, and then he recognized the voice.
was used, he filed the reaction and kept talking -  allowed Sam and Natasha to reach the leader and take out the power source they were using. After that Thor and the Hulk were quick to pick any stray soldier and take the rest of them down. They thought they had all of them but…
"But it is. I can understand why he would not want Steve to come in – I don't think it's the right way to handle it, but I see why he prefers that… but the rest of us? does he blame us too?" Clint's eyes shut close for a second as he breathes in, hands forming fists as he tried to remind himself the mantra Natasha recited to him the day before, same as he did for her through the years – there wasn't anything he could do, it wasn't his fault. It was hard to believe that it mattered at all If Tony thought it was.
That was his opinion until the attack on Manhattan, where he, and most of the world, witnessed the Avengers fighting for their sake against aliens, of all things. And Stark specifically, taking a nuclear warhead through a wormhole, with no guarantee that he would be able to come back alive.
The Tower was empty and dark, the Avengers were only living there on and off and it seemed like most of them were out there helping or at the hospital with Tony. Rhodey was forbidden from both by Banner, and he knew it would not be responsible to try and fly his suit after not sleeping for two days. With War machine, the risk of causing damage was a lot more present, as JARVIS was not installed in the suit.
Steve lifted his head and stared longingly out of the window, following a cloud of ash and smoke trailing out of the destroyed portion of Manhattan. "I'm not the one with a medical degree, Dr. Banner." He said, "I assume, between the two of us, you are the one more qualified to give a diagnosis." Bruce knew he failed at keeping his voice blameless, he bit inside his mouth and coughed a bit.
"Rhodes combed through a freaking desert for three months when Tony went missing in Afghanistan, it's not that surprising." Clint said when Bruce questioned the sanity of going on scouting with no leads and no new information, "Everyone thought Tony was dead back then, too. But the bastard is really hard to kill and stubborn to a fault, the Colonel knows that better than any of us." the arrow he played with in his hand split into two pieces before his face softened, disheartened. "He is probably building himself another fucking armor right now and will free himself before we can even count to ten. Any minute now."
Rhodey and Sam were out nearly all the time, Clint and Natasha were scheduled for the morning, and were keeping an eye on the queries run by Jarvis and the news in the meantime, and Thor was searching in more remote locations, despite no one believing Steve had gotten too far with an injured, barely recovered Tony and no known means of transportation.
But no, they weren't together. He knew that. Bruce had been teasing him and Tony about a supposed attraction just like everyone else – if a bit more mellow, never jealous or angry of the bond Steve and Tony obviously shared. Steve couldn't imagine a scenario where he could do something like that with his own lass – or lad, in Tony's case. Just the thought of having to share spat him now, despite not having paid any attention to their relationship before.
Natasha and Clint were back at her bed and were pulling the curtain around them to give Tony privacy as they talked among themselves. Rhodey was still sitting in his chair with his eyes every bit unfocused as he was tired from so many hours of wakefulness, Bruce made up his mind to get a spare bed in the room for the man before he exhausted himself completely. He injected Tony with the drug that would at least block some of the pain if not all of it for the duration of the night and watched as Tony's face relaxed, the lines in his forehead turning shallow and flatten while his body numbed.
The pictures of the fight that had taken place were a blurry mess, and it was almost impossible to see the human participant in it. The fact that they were wearing a cowl wasn't helping much either. After the armors were down, he made a special effort at tearing them down before heading to the bed where Tony was somehow, unnaturally sleeping still, and worked on slowly and delicately unhooking and detaching every piece of medical equipment, before thrashing those as well.
He kept seeing Steve's face looming over him in the darkness of the room, and his chest felt like fire was burning right through the center of it, just as it did under the rubble and the crushed chest-piece of his suit and later – how it felt when his breathing efforts were stopped by a pair of lips clashing with his own, and a tongue invading his mouth with violent determination. He remembered it fuzzily, from the verge of his consciousness with barely any air in his lungs.
The repulsor ray hit the door once, then it hit it another time. The door wasn't as heavy and enforced as the main entrance to the cabin was, on account of it being hidden so thoroughly. It came down when he shot both of his gauntlet repulsors at the same time, the third time. Rhodey kept his eyes closed a few more seconds, staying rooted where he stood as the dust settled and inhaling the filtered air his suit provided. A he opened his eyes, his mask receded and revealed him to the mostly empty room. The walls were white and padded to stop the dweller of the room from harming himself, on the far side, there was what looked like a nest of dirty blanket and some pillows, and next to them was a small breathing machine, but no one was using it at the moment.
He knew the man would follow him and believe in him. Bucky would, too, once the mind control thing is dealt with. All in all, the Avengers as a team followed his lead with next to no complaint, believing justly that he knew what he was doing.
They both watch as the figure leans in, his hand tracing lines across Tony's sleeping form as his head descended nearer and his hand cradled Tony's head to lift it and close the distance… Rhodey shoved the ball back into Natasha's hand and wiped his tears.
"Anyone of us would have reacted the same way, Doctor Banner. Accusing our Shield-brother of such an atrocious act should be unthinkable. I'm sure the Man of Iron would soon realize it himself." Thor supplied with a soft smile, laying a heavy hand on Bruce's shoulder, who shook his head slightly but said nothing in turn.
"Yeah, well. I couldn't really figure out what it was for after I built it so…" he watched as Tony quickly reassembled the little sphere and hooked it on to the StarkPad with a cable he cannibalized from another prototype all while typing on the workstation's keyboard furiously. For the first time since Rhodey last saw him Tony's face had lit up and the tension left his shoulders and back.
“No… no. It’s fine. I just need to rest.” He bit out just before Jarvis could repeat the question. Locking himself in the workshop seemed like a perfectly valid coping mechanism. Maybe it was time he created a deep-sea suit. A perfectly portable armor, easy to deploy underwater, complete with electrical deterrents. Yeah. That sounded like a perfectly good idea.
He repeated his tours of the skies of the city for two more days, joined by Clint and Natasha in the quinjet and Rhodes in his armor. These were useless, none of them had no idea where else to look, and no further sightings of Steve were found since that one night.
"I actually hoped you would have come to your senses by now, the entire world is telling you what they saw in the video you leaked, and it wasn't rape. but you, you convinced yourself, didn't you?"
