Sherlock reached into his pants and closed his fingers around John's cock.
Some trigger warnings: you may have been able to tell from the summary, but some discussion of addictions, and a mention of prostitution (super quick, barely even a line)
“Not going to a hospital,” he said. John sighed.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John said under his breath as his eyes ran over the mess of bruises scattered along his chest and stomach. His brow furrowed, however, when he encountered some old bruises. “These aren’t from today.” It wasn’t a question. He ran his fingers lightly over the yellow and green spots covering Sherlock’s side, leaving a trail of goosebumps in his wake.
His brow furrowed at the thought.
He ran a finger from the sensitive place just behind Sherlock's cock and circled it over his entrance, not yet slipping it in, just teasing. After a few moments of this, Sherlock whined and pressed back against the finger. John allowed his finger to slip in and Sherlock gasped under him at the sudden intrusion.
And if there was one thing that Sherlock knew, it was how to deal with addiction."
“You went to see your sister today,” Sherlock started, knowing how much it turned John on to hear his deductions. John settled back in his chair and smiled.
“Yeah that’s what I thought. You don’t have any other injuries, do you? Any on your legs or anything?” Sherlock quickly shook his head again. There was no way John was getting anywhere near there.
“How do propose we catch him? My husband isn’t the type to confess, and he certainly wouldn’t do it to me,” she asked when the left the house. Sherlock looked up and down the street, checking if there were any cameras that could have caught someone coming up to the house. He saw nothing and was mildly disappointed, but not surprised. He did, however, notice a homeless woman across the street, sitting under a tree. He ran across the street without checking to see if any cars were coming and left Mrs. Hudson swearing in his wake. He didn’t pay her any attention; he was focused on the homeless woman.
“No problem, Sherlock. Please, come to me if this ever happens again.” Sherlock nodded before leaving the bathroom and the warm coffee shop, his usual sweeping stride broken by a slight limping.
, because nobody cares about
They dozed a for a bit more, before Sherlock got restless and John got hungry. They padded downstairs (Sherlock wrapped in only a bedsheet, John in nothing but his pants), trading kisses and soft touches, both hardly believing that the other was there. John made them eggs and toast and bacon, while Sherlock deduced the news before opening the newspaper and was right
“Okay,” he replied, his voice hoarse and breathy. John gently pushed him to his feet, and he stood on shaky legs. John tried not to smirk again, but knew he failed.
John added a third finger and watched with awe as Sherlock fucked himself on them. Finally, he couldn’t stand it anymore, thinking he might burst if he didn’t have Sherlock right then.
“I’m sorry Captain, please Sir,” whined Sherlock, all but thrashing on the bed. John decided to let it go just this once, mostly because he was so aroused he couldn’t see straight. He lined his cock up with Sherlock’s hole and thrust in, in one smooth motion.
“Yes,” he replied. John giggled.
John hoped that maybe changing the subject would help.
“How. Could you
“Yeah, be warned, he may have traced it back to you. You should expect a full-blown police investigation sometime soon,” Sherlock said, smiling to show that he was joking. John laughed along, though he looked slightly worried.
“Just knock, Mike will let you in. If he’s not in…if he’s not in call me okay?”
“I could spend days on this neck alone,” John murmured into Sherlock’s smooth skin. Sherlock snorted.
Sherlock looked down at Mrs. Hudson to tell her, before he remembered that she was asleep. He knew that telling Mrs. Hudson wasn’t what he wanted anyway. She was a wonderful lady, and he was grateful for her asking his help, but he ached to be able to tell John about it—to tell John about everything. He ached to see his eyes crinkle up as he smiled, he ached to hear his infectious giggle—the one that was different every time depending on what made him laugh, and Sherlock swore that there was a specific giggle for when Sherlock made a deduction that made him laugh.
“My brother,” Sherlock explained. Mrs. Hudson nodded her understanding.
He buried his face deeper into the cushion, the worn leather muffling his keening cry. He couldn’t go on like this much longer.
“I had this…friend, I guess,” he began with a shrug. “Then I started to feel things for him that were…more than friendly. And that doesn’t often happen to me, as I’m sure you can imagine.” Mrs. Hudson smiled softly at him.
come visit me on my tumblr (astronautsxandxaliens.tumblr.com) to talk about series 4 and other things dear lord everyone hold onto your heads WE HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT!!!
?” Sherlock was jostled as Sebastian Wilkes shoved his shoulder. “It’s not like you have
“Brat,” John chuckled affectionately and dipped the tip of one finger into the jelly and brought it up to Sherlock’s lips. He wrapped his lips around John’s finger and sucked lightly, flicking his tongue against the tip, causing John to take a sharp breath.
Sherlock snagged his purple shirt off of the hanger, knowing it was John’s favorite on him. He buttoned it up slowly, feeling the soft fabric settle around his shoulders. His hands were shaking slightly and he found himself feeling something he hadn’t in a while—he felt nervous. Not much made him nervous anymore.
In the hopes of making my prolonged absence up to you wonderful people I have written you guys a chapter of almost total smut.
No, it was much better to continue hiding behind his books and pretending to get some work done until they left.
He didn’t bother with a condom this time, but added lube to his cock before lining himself up with Sherlock’s entrance. Before he could do anything more, however, Sherlock began turning himself over.
“Do you think it’ll annoy him if I get the cheap stuff or the expensive stuff? He’d hate it if he thought I was spending his money on expensive alcohol, but the sight of cheap alcohol might actually just cause him to vomit on the spot,” Sherlock said giving John a grin that could only be described as ‘wolfish.’ John chuckled. He had only ever met (and ‘met’ was generous term to use for their encounter) Sherlock’s brother once, but what he had seen of him made John think he was a real prick and the thought of annoying him, however childish, made John smile.
“Eh, no from the looks of it, you need all the brain cells you can get your hands on,” John replied. Sherlock looked at him, affronted.
"That was amazing," Sherlock murmured quietly. John knew he had said it more for himself, but he allowed himself to preen anyway. He was about to respond, but looked to see Sherlock was sound asleep. With a soft smile, John let his eyes drift shut and his body to relax as he fell asleep as well, wondering what the morning would bring.
“That’s not true.”
All of the sudden, he felt a hand in his hair, carding through it lightly at first, before gripping it tightly and forcing his head back. He gasped, the feeling going straight to his already impossibly hard cock.
(See the end of the chapter for
John closed up quickly, doing possibly the worst clean-up job that he had ever done. They didn’t talk much, but the air between them was heated, tense. When John was locking the door for the night, his hands were shaking slightly, causing him to fumble around his keys.
“Thank you for your input, we will test both the gun and the wounds accordingly,” said the man, clearly forcing the courteous words through gritted teeth. Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“My chemistry partner. We have a project and she is horribly inept at chemistry,” Sherlock said with a shrug. He looked up to see three pairs of vaguely amused and not at all convinced eyes. Sherlock amended his earlier statement—he always hated how observant his entire family was.
“Hello, John,” he said. John fought not to shiver when he heard his voice. It really should have been illegal for a teenager to have low of a voice. They talked normally for about half an hour until another customer came in and John had to go. Sherlock seemed to be acting normally, but his eyes kept lingering on John’s mouth and John noticed him licking his lips more often.
“Got it out…? So that’s what that was?” he asked, his voice thin and brittle. Sherlock gave a sharp nod.
The second encounter happened just a week later. It was a Saturday—a busy day for the café, so John was working with Sarah. He liked her, and their date had gone well, if a little boring, and he intended to ask her out again. Soon, he hoped.
“John! I was waiting for you, of course,” he replied as if it should have been obvious at first sight.
“No, your friend Sherlock ate them all when he was here, remember?” Mike said, looking peeved.
“Sorry, but you wouldn’t happen to be Sherlock
“Oh my god, I thought the other lads were taking a piss,” he said, looking at Sherlock as though he wasn’t quite sure he was real.
John doodled on the corner of his paper and wondered if this was how Sherlock felt all the time. If this was what he meant when he said he was so bored he could feel his brain rotting. Because John did have to admit, he did feel like he was getting progressively stupider the longer he had to sit and listen to his professor ramble on about something completely irrelevant to the exam they would be having in a week.
“Yeah, sorry must have dozed off a bit there,” he replied.
“Exactly what you were hoping I would do—making a move,” Sherlock breathed.
“You want it harder, do you?” John asked. “Aren’t you a needy little cockslut?” Sherlock shuddered around John’s cock, his fingers tightening in the sheets.
"John, what did you do?!" Sherlock exclaimed, grabbing John's hand. John stopped his rant as he looked at rapidly swelling hand, which he had jabbed into the strange gel. Just one more thing that was going wrong today. "Rinse it, John, before it gets too bad." John stuck his hand under the sink, inhaling to start yelling again.
Finally, both boys collapsed on the bed next to each other, breathing hard and still giggling softly. John reached down and laced their fingers lightly together, unable to keep himself from touching Sherlock even for a few seconds.
“You’re very loyal, Mr. Watson,” Mycroft called.
“Look, Mike’s told me about your bloke, okay, and I’m sorry, mate, but you can’t just keep locking yourself away in your apartment and hoping the next Bond film will hold all the answers to your problems.” The words came rushing through the speaker of John’s phone as though the words were burning Bill’s mouth and he wanted them out as soon as possible. John sighed, looking guiltily at the stack of Bond films sitting next to him.
"No, of course you're not. And I'm already really looking forward to working here with you too " John said and laid an arm on her shoulder, before looking up at Sherlock with a smile.
Sherlock smiled a little at that, "Maybe it's just because it would have been nice to have someone who actually gets me and who I could talk to without being judged in any way, so I guess that's what I want to be for you two." he said and hummed a small laugh, "The awful thing was that it took me so long to realise there were such people in my life. Jane found out I'm interested in men on her own at some point, but I never dared to just go up to someone no matter how close I was to them and just be who I actually was, well that was until I met Victor, my first boyfriend, who insisted on going to my father and asking him for permission to run off with me.. and well we were going to run off anyway, so it didn't really matter, what really stunned me back then was that my father told him and later me, that he and my mother were completely alright with whatever would make me happy." he said with a smile, "I'm not sure if you can imagine how rare people like my parents were back then, I mean it was still all in secret and neither of them would have wanted for it to become public knowledge, but they did let me go off with him. I.. erm.. I didn't see them very often after that, I think they visited me thrice, before they died. Well, before my father died, my mother obviously didn't die, but she faked it, not knowing I was a vampire as well.. It's so ridiculous that we never found out she was still alive until a month ago."
John, who felt like he was intruding a moment, stepped quietly outside again, closing the door behind him. "I love you so much, darling. And I'm glad neither of us have to worry about you getting your tea anymore." Violet smiled and ruffled her hand tenderly through his hair, before pulling back.
"Yes, we'll come to speak of that in just a moment." Mrs. Hope told John with a smile, before turning back to Sherlock to think about her fellow teachers. "Hm, well there's Greg Lestrade. He teaches Geography, maths and physics. I can't think of anyone here who's ever had problems with him." She said finally. "You can talk to him later on and he'll tell my what you two have agreed on. We can discuss your wage after that and obviously only after I have a copy of your documents. How does that sound?"
A few seconds later Paul pulled the needle out against and gave her a plaster. "So, just press down here and that's that. I won't bother you again today." He said with a smile and closed his bag again, before taking his gloves off. "You've got some very patient daughters there." Paul told Sherlock with a chuckle.
John began to stroke Sherlock's face soothingly with his thumb. "It's over, love. None of it was real." He assured once more and sighed softly. This was worse than what Harry had told him... How could he not have noticed Sherlock was suffering right next to him? "Thank you for telling me this. Are your other nightmares similar to this one?"
Sherlock chuckled, "Yeah I can relate, though you get used to it very quickly." he said and smiled, "Actually with so many vampires around, I have to be much more on guard not to say things like that when I'm not around vampires."
"Not the only thing we'd break if we didn't keep them." Sherlock said, moving behind John to wrap his arms around him and rest his head on his shoulder, "I'm glad she didn't get to read Victor's letter, though."
"Mmh, I don't get to kiss you nearly as often as I'd like to." John remarked, before asking. "Are you sure you don't want a scarf?"
Sherlock smiled, "Something to look forward to." he said and chuckled, taking the steaks off the stove and filling their plates.
Rosie shook her head, "I can practice the letters some more until you're back!" she chirped, taking a bite of her lunch, "Maybe you can try to figure our how to write 'sober' and 'rise' all on your own." he said and smiled, "You can write both with the letters you've learnt."
Fay put on her pokerface again, wondering quietly why they were acting so strangely. Well, she'd figure it out eventually. In the meantime, she continued to drink until she almost felt sick to her stomach, not looking up at the two men in the meantime. John returned the look, but waited until she had finished practically the whole bottle. "Are you feeling hungry a lot of the time?" He asked her eventually and her eyes narrowed. They wanted to bribe her to make her talk. So that's what that had been about. She surely wouldn't tell them anything about their group, so she decidedly turned her head away and stayed silent.
"Maybe what?" Sherlock asked and frowned at John, before looking into the bag, "Well, I was actually going with self made fried noodles.. but I'm sure I can throw together a quick Bologna.. you know, it's more child-friendly." he said and chuckled as he started to unpack the groceries.
"Mhm.." Sherlock hummed, settling back against John again, before frowning a little and moving to turn around, before he sat down in the same spot again, just this time with his legs on either side of John, "There, better. If we'd have kept sitting like that, I'd have gotten a stiff neck by the end of the night." he said with a chuckle.
"Would you mind if I don't wear that purple shirt for a few weeks?" Sherlock asked after a moment together silence, resting his head against John's chest, "It's just.. it's what I wore.. to.. erm... That funeral.." he mumbled quietly.
"That kid has a point..." The older officer said and gave his colleague a look, before radioing the station to call for backup. Their foster father stared at them with wide eyes and all but ran up to William to beat him into a pulp, though the older police officer stepped in fairly soon and handcuffed him, giving his colleague a took to do the same with William. "Mr. Carter, I hereby arrest you for deferring police actions and presumed tax fraud." He said and walked the both of them downstairs. His wife had a look of pure terror on her face when they passed her.
"She's a bit better with a people though." Charlie commented. "But yeah, she definitely has this whole starting a new life business down." She commented, watching Greg come to their car. "Hey, you two." Greg said with a smile and lowered his head to look into the car through Charlie's door. "Glad you've found this place. Shall we go inside then?" He asked and Charlie got out of the car right away. "That's the spirit!" He chuckled. "Already excited then?" Charlie nodded. "You've no idea."
Aha. He was about to start here, wasn't he? And John wasn't much more than ten years older than her then by the looks of him. "Really? You're right by the way John's a short one." She chuckled, before putting the picture back on Rosie's night stand.
"Really? That'd be awesome!" Charlie smiled; she hadn't even thought if Mrs. Hudson. "Do you want to go downstairs after we're done with your poster?"
"Nah, I guess we're just irresistible, that's all." John teased with a smirk, before taking another bite from his croissant.
"Still alive, don't worry." Sherlock said and laughed, shaking his head and taking John's hand to support him a little, John seemed to feel incredibly embarrassed about bursting in. "We were about to come back downstairs again, actually."
"Mhm.. I know.. You're still okay with me coming along?" Sherlock asked and bit his lip, starting to feel nervous about it. He hadn't actually had the kind of boyfriend meets parents stuff yet. This was a first for him.
"What a shame. And what else am I supposed to call them?" John said, chuckling a bit as well, before beginning to work on one and pressing his body a bit closer to Sherlock.
"He looks just a few years younger on that picture, but apart from that.. I'm fairly sure that's him." John said after a moment and Charlie nodded tightly; she wouldn't be showing them this picture in the first if she wasn't sure. "He did make a comment about vampirism. I only remember it, because I had to explain it to Charlie." John said after a moment, before asking "..Is that the guy who wanted you to turn him?"
"Yours skin's already healed." John noted surprised, before chuckling at Sherlock's expression. "Yeah, it is. And it's nice I'm able to do that now. But I really didn't expect biting to feel so... gratifying."
"I'll think about it." Charlie said truthfully and sighed. She hadn't ever really confided into anyone completely, so she was quite unsure of that kind of concept. "Is this kind of thing something normal for you to get involved in? You sound so... composed. The way adults try to sound, when they want to reassure you, just that you actually do have a plan."
"Better start believing it, because I'm not letting you off that particular hook." Sherlock said with a chuckle, "You're in for life." he said with a smirk.
Sherlock grinned, "Hm... perhaps if you ask nicely, I will let you take one photo." he said and smirked, "But don't you post it anywhere, I have to live with that one flying around the internet for quite a while." he said and chuckled.
"Thank you sweetheart, I appreciate it." John said and had to chuckle himself at that. "I think Vanessa put it next to her own car. Can you already spot it?" He asked her with a smile.
Charlie smiled back at him and nodded. "But just for your information, there are no ex-girlfriends on my side."
"Doesn't she already feel caged in as things are right now?" John said and ran a hand through his hair. "But even if they're just after Charlie; next time they'll try to get her it will be two."
"We avoid me and if we meet Victor, we'll tell him what's going on." Sherlock said immediately, "He'll believe us." he said, knowing that was true. No matter how crazy the story, Victor knew that Sherlock would never lie to him. "He'll help us find Rosie." he said, only now feeling his pulse quicken a little at the thought of seeing Victor again, not that he still felt the exact same for him, but he still missed him and loved him, even if it wasn't in a romantic way anymore.
"Roman-? Oh, right, Janine." John said with a chuckle. "You haven't told them about my turning yet, though, have you?" He asked after a moment; now that they were back from their honeymoon John really needed to meet up with Harry to talk about that.
“Sure, love. And please make sure Charlie doesn't fall while I'm away." John said with a chuckle before turning to get some blood. It was sweet how Rosie was always so keen to hold the people's hands when she thought that they might get hurt. "Maybe you want to get changed though, wouldn't want tomato juice stains on your dresses." He said and Charlie nodded, before slipping out of her shoes. "Let's go upstairs then"
Angelo smiled happily at that, "Well, let me tell you, if you ever have a restaurant, never give your recipes to your friends or you won't see them so much anymore." he said jokingly and Sherlock rolled his eyes, "John and I were here last week, Angelo." he said and chuckled.
Charlie pulled her hand back and blushed, looking quite embarrassed. "I haven't exactly washed my hands and I don't want you to get sick too."
"Mmh, I agree." John said with a nod. "As long as she hasn't discovered anything she found disturbing or something like that I'll leave her be."
"Well, I hadn't really thought ahead that much to be honest. I'd say though you should probably meet Harry and our parents separately though to relieve the tension a bit. I mean, we've invited her and her wife over next week. Maybe a few days after that... What do you think?"
"Alright, I wouldn't put it past you given the right circumstances." John said. "And I don't even know anyone who owns a dog and would have a reason to come over."
Sherlock just couldn't get that grin off his face, "Oh, nothing, nothing, I'm just very convinced you're the woman of his dreams, that's all." he said and chuckled, "Oh and he's a detective inspector at Scotland Yard. Just got promoted... again.."
John put his own, much slimmer portfolio onto the table too. "Oh yes, naturally, thank you for that." Mrs. Hope said with a smile and took the folders. Taking a look at John's first she skimmed his handful of certificates from his rugby times as well as the three summer camps he'd worked at, his CV and a copy of his graduation certificate. After looking at all of them for a while she nodded. "Yes, thank you. That's all I needed to see. Now.." She slipped the papers back into the folder and took Sherlock's. "That's quite an impressive record. It's been a while since I've seen someone apply with a diploma from the nineteenth century." She said with a chuckle as she went carefully through his documents.
"Oh yeah." Donna said and cleared her throat, "Your.. erm.." she looked with a disapproving frown at Sherlock before looking back at Charlie and putting the smile back on her face, "You.. father.. is right.. it's better you feel somewhat comfortable in your shoes, so no matter how lovely a shoe is, if it's already uncomfortable wearing it for the first time.. it's not gonna get better, just try another one."
"Ah, now I can see why you thought it was real." Sherlock said and smirked at John, "Because I can see him lecturing his to be son in law shortly before the wedding."
"Uh, no that was me." Sherlock said and smiled, "I thought they'd like that better than the plain grey it was before." he said and smiled, "So.. you want to see your room? It's not ready yet, obviously, but on the bright side, you get to do all the customising."
"You hear that? We're VIPs." John told her with a smirk, as he set a bottle of water on the table and sat down next to her. "Are you all comfy there?"
"About Charlie's new school?" Sherlock asked, leaning a bit into John's touch, they really didn't have enough alone time, then again, there was nothing they could do about it right now. Leaving the girls with their family for a few days might be safe, but they probably both wouldn't feel good about it.
"Yeah..." Sherlock mumbled and buried his head into John's neck again, "Guess I'm on the losing side on that particular area.." he murmured against John's skin, before he started kissing John's neck, partly to distract himself, but also because it was sort of a reminder for himself that John was still here after all, that he could still touch and hold him.
"No, we haven't yet, but knowing John I'm sure they're be great." She said and gave John a smirk. "To be honest, I thought it'd just the four of us and Mrs. Hudson around here." She said with a smile, though that had obviously mainly been because this was only temporary anyway; living friends, as Sherlock has put ut. Meanwhile David was very glad to meet the girls (despite of the state of this flat). "Is that so?" He asked Charlie and gave John a pointed look. "Well, there's a whole bunch of us that'd all be happy to meet you in time."
"Awesome, thanks." Charlie said with a smile and looked up when she saw John coming back to them, balancing three mugs of tea. "Just in case you wanted something warm in your belly.." He said and put them next to the plate. "It's good to know Rosie and I aren't gonna starve here." She said and chuckled. "Though I should probably mention that two of the mugs were meant for Sherlock and me." He added with a smirk, which made Charlie laugh a bit. "Yeah, you know, I did figure that much."
John nodded at that. "Interesting. How times have changed, I mean. A history lesson's all included with you, isn't it." He drew away a bit and tugged lightly on Sherlock's arm. "Let's have a look then, shall we?"
John frowned a little... that sounded familiar. "Nevertheless, prevention is better than cure. But it's nice of you to come."
Her heart skipped a beat when the taller one attacked her (she recognised his voice). She immediately began to struggle against his grip to free herself and get back. "Let me go, bastard!" She snarled and kicked his shins with all her strength. She had to get out of here as soon as possible. She couldn't fail another misdion and certainly not be captured in the process... Meanwhile the other one (why weren't they in the living room?!) shot upstairs where she knew Charlotte slept.
Sherlock chuckled a little as Rachel turned around, for a moment feeling very good today, then he turned around and remembered he had to spend the majority of it with Mycroft, "Well then, I suppose we'll go and meet another colleague of mine, aren't you excited about today?" he deadpanned.
Five minutes later, John went quietly down the stairs and back into Mrs. Hudson's flat to find Viktor snorring and Scout looking up to inspect him. "The windows are closed and they're both fast asleep." John whispered and wrapped his arms around Sherlock from behind.
"The trip has just made us veery tired." John said with a smile. "Erm paps, one last question. Did you think we were going to pack your shirts too?" She asked him after a moment since that he wasn't wearing one even though John was; and she could kinda see him actually forgetting half his suitcase.
"If it was something really serious she'd sure tell us." Sherlock said and shrugged, "Maybe she's still going to and just didn't want to interrupt us before." he said and smiled a little, "So.. how did you like regency me, by the way. You didn't say much about it."
"Maybe she thought it was awkward until now." John suggested with a bit of a smile, because that seemed like quite the step in their relationship. "You might've felt more like a dad to her today."
John nodded and let out a long sigh. "Yeah, it seems I don't give them enough credit. And you're right about aunt Beth." He said with a wry smile. "I'm sorry about that again. I didn't expect it to go that ugly and I should've said something in your defence... But yeah, we know where my parents stand now." He commented with a wry smile.
"Why do you say that? It's the dead and mouldy stuff I don't like. I'm fine with living things in the flat. So, as a soon to be doctor, I decides that every chance at resuscitation will be taken in here." John retorted and returned the smirk.
"Nine. I think that's enough for a start and it's definitely enough chocolate for us." Sherlock said, gently tapping Rosie's nose with his finger, making her giggle, before he stood up, "Oh and I bought those as well." he said, pulling a pack of colourful pipe cleaners out of his coat pocket, "We want our bees to be fuzzy, don't we?"
John chuckled a bit and pecked his lips. "I hope none of the actual students agree. But good that you mention it, we need to go on another date sometime. Just the two of us."
"Yeah I will be seeing him soon enough." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "Can you copy the letter too? I'd really like to show it to John and Charlie, if that's okay. It's just really sweet."
"I wasn't go.." Sherlock began, being cut off by a snort he just couldn't suppress, before he cleared his throat, biting his lip hard, "I wasn't going to say.. anything."
Sherlock smiled down at her, he wouldn't admit it, but the way she called him 'Lock' was quite heart-warming. "I'm helping Lock cook!" Ally pointed out, "I can pick the noodles!" she exclaimed proudly and Sherlock chuckled, leaning down to pick up Amy as well, "You both can." he said, walking back over to the cupboard.
"Hold on, her first impulse was to call the vicar?" John asked, almost chuckling at the absurdity of that.
"That'd be lovely. We haven't had a big family Christmas in way too long." Violet replied and went with him to the door.
Rosie grinned, "Yeah! Sherlock said I can wear a really pretty dress when they get married and whoa! We can wear the same dresses!" she chirped and Sherlock chuckled, "Hm.. actually, Charlie.. would you like to try design your dresses yourself? No pressure, we can still go out and buy dresses for you if you don't like what you come up with, I just thought you might like that."
"Yeah, probably.." Sherlock said and Richard smiled, "Right.. Harry.. I'd really like to meet her too, actually." he said and thought for a moment, "When do you plan to actually let your family know then? I mean.. Now that I've met you.. I'm kind of eager to meet the others too."
"You only want to see us all in the costume." Sherlock said and laughed, shaking his head, "I'd like that. Though it might be difficult to dance in a fin tail." Emma said with a laugh.
"They look like troll feet!" Rosie chuckled, looking down at her feet, the green paint had spread over them a little in the paper socks, they looked so funny!
"Yeah, that's true." John said and took another sip, feeling like the blood was helping with his recovery. "You know, it's strange, if I didn't know better, I'd think I'd just came down with a bad flu."
John nodded at that and began to walk up the stairs. "Jesus, when she held your wine glass in her hands and had blood dripping from the corners of her mouth... I thought I was about to either die or murder something there for a second." He admitted with a shake of head.
"I had no idea I'd turn John on like that wearing a dress." Sherlock said with a giggle, shaking his head, "Those shoes are horrible though, I have a lot more respect for women wearing those every day after a week of practising." he said and smirked, sitting up a bit. "Oh and you can have the dress Harry." he chuckled.
"Oh.. that's good thinking." Sherlock said and smiled at John, "While we're at it, with that free space behind the walls.. it shouldn't be too hard to put in some sort of secret room in either of their rooms, maybe Narnia style, making the back of their wardrobes shiftable so that they open into a secret room they can hide in, the way their rooms are placed, maybe they could even lead in the same room, like a panic room of sorts, just for the worst case. I doubt it'd really stop someone from taking them, but it sure would make it harder to find them, which gives them more time to call someone."
"Yup, I made an older girl tell me after reading that there's a subject called 'vampire studies' on her time table. I mean, this hole story - well, all of those little lies you're being told as a child - doesn't really add up, if you've once only cut your finger and put it into your mouth." She said and shrugged and let them into their room. "Also explains why practically no one comes by to adopt."
"Well, I was mostly thinking things like sex on drugs or alcohol when people are unable to give consent, not telling a partner about your own STDs or STIs, sex as payment. You know, things that should be obvious, but that I want her to have heard at least  once."
"Uh maybe let her be for tonight at least?" Sherlock said and chuckled a little, taking John's hand to make sure he wouldn't go upstairs, "Just let her enjoy it a little. She's only just met him, she's probably replaying their meeting in her head and staring at the photo she took of him, writing a diary entry.."
Sherlock nodded, "Alright." he said and cleaned the crook of John's arm with rubbing alcohol before he established the vascular access and attaching the tube, taking a deep breath as John's blood started to fill the transparent tube, leading into the measuring cup, where Sherlock had attached it with some adhesive tape. "And there we go..." he said and looked up at John.
"Don't think so." Sherlock said quietly in reply to John's previous question, not wanting to wake up Rosie who had dozed off on the sofa, using her book as a pillow, before he turned to look at Charlie. "Why did he leave so soon?" he asked, he had actually thought they would have to eventually drag him out of their house.
"You know, I doubt that occasionally seeing us kiss would harm them." Sherlock said and chuckled, "I mean.. after all they see people kiss on TV and films all the time, even in Disney films they kiss."
"When they believe you and well for that matter, believe me too, yes, then I'll turn you." William said and meant it, though he wasn't quite sure if Jim was stable enough to ever be let out of here.
"John can you untie.." Sherlock frowned, turning around to look at the girl, "What's your name anyway?" suddenly realising they didn't even know that.
Rosie smiled happily, hugging his leg for a moment longer, before she let go, looking at the clock at the wall across them and frowning a little, "When the long handle is on twelve and the short handle is on five it's five o'clock, right?" she asked, looking up at Sherlock, who smiled, "Yeah, why.." he asked and Rosie's eyes widened, "It's dinner time!" she exclaimed and looked at the two men, "Do you want to have dinner with us?" she asked happily.
Ron smiled as he knocked at Charlie's door, "It's me! Can I come in?" he called through the closed door.
"Obviously. And hugging a lot, obviously." Charlie said with a small chuckle and wrapped her arms around him too. "You're almost as bad as dad in that regard." She said and chuckled.
"There are other places to wear diamonds! I'm pretty sure she's aware of that too and just wants a navel piercing." John said with a huff, finding Sherlock's idea still borderline ridiculous.
"Fair enough." John chuckled and leaned over the gear stick to kiss Sherlock properly, bringing one hand up to cup his cheek.
"It really seems to have been a realistic dream; you know me well apparently. And it's okay, we don't have to do this today." John said and kept his hand on Sherlock's back. "Now, it's practically freezing outside. Unless you want blood ice cream, I suggest you go back inside." He commented looking at the glass in Sherlock's hand.
John sighed once he stood in front of the bathroom mirror and made relatively quick work of brushing his teeth and washing his face. What a day... Once he'd dried off his face with his towel, he returned to their bedroom and slipped into his plaid pyjama bottoms. "Hey, love." He said with a smile and climbed into bed, spooning Sherlock from behind and kissing his neck.
"Well.. yeah.." Sherlock said and blushed a little deeper, "But about Molly, don't feel bad for her, she knows I'm gay and it's common sense that it's not going to change, therefore, it's up to her if she clings to that crush, or moves on." he said and shrugged. "I can't do more than telling her the truth."                       "Well, that's true; I'm not blaming you." John said, smirking a little at the still apparent blush on Sherlock's cheeks. "So, let's experiment on Monday then. I'm busy on Sunday, but Monday after my lectures sounds great."
"He's Molly's boyfriend! And he repairs the computers at the orphanage." Rosie chirped happily and Sherlock took a deep breath, "Bee, why aren't you downstairs with Mrs Hudson?" he asked, they could hardly discuss this in front of her. "Mrs Hudson doesn't have milk, so I wanted to take some from our fridge!" she explained.
"You know, you could at least try it on, before pretending you're not sure." Sherlock said and laughed, handing the dress back to Charlie.
Sherlock chuckled, giving a small round of applause for the little girl who looked really happy about the attention she got - which she was probably starved off, really. "It's really pretty, isn't it?" she asked with a chuckle, turning around a few times to make her skirt go woosh.
"Eh... it's a mixed one.." Sherlock said with a laugh and shook his head, "I'd say it's generally a good impression of all of them except Beth. If you haven't noticed, she isn't that fond of me." he said and rolled his eyes.
"What fools we have been not to see it." Sherlock said with a chuckle, opening the door for John as a cab pulled up in front of them. "Took you long enough, I've been driving up and down the street the whole time, what were you doing in there?" Harry asked, chuckling, "Actually, no, I don't really wanna know. Off to Mum and dad's then?" she asked, "Uh.. thanks for waiting around for us.." Sherlock said with a laugh.
"I am though. Not in a dangerous way, but in a I just can't say no way." Sherlock said and rolled his eyes about himself as he nipped at his glass.
Charlie was quiet for a while, before eventually sitting down on the worktop. "I mean obviously I am very thankful to hear that you care about us that much. Just.. if something should happen, I don't know, life's just shit sometimes. I mean, do look for us, obviously. But if there really is nothing to be done about it.." She shrugged slightly. "Life would just go on either way, so of course you could get over it. You didn't have to take us in in the first place, so it wouldn't be fair if it upset you that much."
"Oh no, we did stay with her until she sold the house. It was just before my eighteenth birthday anyway, so it felt like a good time to leave and start a new life." Scott said and sat down next to William and John. "Can't tell you how thankful I was I didn't have to play this family Russian roulette anymore."
The rest of the morning passed uneventful, mainly because John went out soon, leaving Sherlock with the usual anxiety he had when he wasn't with John, though something had taken the edge off of it, making him less panicky about it. Perhaps the fact that he had actually talked about it with his mum and John made it better. Richard had agreed to come around later in the morning, so that left some time for Sherlock to go out and buy some paint and wallpaper.
"Thank you." Rosie said and smiled happily as she took the photo, holding it carefully. "Can I see your photo too?" she asked and really wanted to see how Charlie had looked when she had been little.
Sherlock nodded and snuggled back up to John, not really sure what to say to that, he just couldn't shake off the fear that John would say no in the end. That he'd decide to leave him. Even though he said it wasn't a decision like that, it still kind of was. It just terrified him.
Sherlock smiled at that, "That's very true." he said and gave him another smile, "All of that shouldn't negate the years you did serve the country though. It's ridiculous that you don't get a proper pension."
John nodded at that. "It's so strange to imagine your that old already. I mean, I think I've already told you, but most of the time, well, practically all the time, I don't realise it." Unless they talked about it, age really was just a number; at least for John.
"It looks really good!" Rosie said and tilted her head a bit for a closer inspection, while Sherlock returned carrying two large boxes stacked on each other, "Here you go." he said as he set the boxes down, "Whoa! You have /a lot/ of Christmas decoration!" Rosie exclaimed.
Sherlock smiled, walking past John into the house and up the stairs, "So it's Watson-Holmes for both of us then?" he asked and looked back at John. "Well let's hope I will never have to write down my full name again once we're married. William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes is pretty long." he chuckled.
"Yeah, hopefully. Though, in my opinion he'd be entitled to some anger" John said with a shrug and put his coffee down. "I really like Richard, you know. He really is a good man."
"Are you mad? Of course I do! And I'm pretty sure Rosie will say so too." Charlie beamed. "You really want that too?" She asked, looking back and forth between them.
"And I genuinely appreciate that." John said with a smile. "And I'm as sure as I can be, that has to be good enough."
"Trust me, learning the names of all of the bones in the human body, only to regurgitate them in an exam a few weeks later, isn't fun nor particularly practical." John said with a wry smile, though he really quite liked this Ron. "But I don't want to turn you off medicine, it is all worth it in the end. But yeah, I absolutely agree, it's shocking how few people will give first aid. I've been an EMT for almost three years now and I've never seen any bystanders already getting started on CPR." He said and shook his head a bit.
"Perhaps the fact that I wouldn't tolerate anyone treating him with any less respect than he deserves. Even you or your wife. John is the best man I've ever had the good fortune to meet. I was serious when I said, I'd walk right out of here with him if you treat him badly and I meant it. I'm the first to encourage him to turn his back on his family and never look back if that family doesn't treat him right." Sherlock said and smiled, "I think that may be what you would dislike most about me. That I won't sit and watch you patronising him for being brave enough to be true to himself."
"Eh no, actually we all met separately without knowing how deep the family ties run there." Sherlock said and snickered a little, "Actually we all just met again through the Watson family, neither of us knew the others were still alive."
In front of the church were all the familiar faces from Emma's birthday. A few feet away from the church stood for example Gareth talking to Mark and John's Emma's young niece. They were all wearing either black suits or dresses and looking grief-stricken. "Sherlock, you haven't had the chance to see John yet, have you?" David asked, once they stood in front of the church.
Janine sighed as it drove past them. "So you, Clara, your brother and Clara's friend were turned together then?" She asked after a moment, thinking about the people she'd been turned with.
John leaned into Sherlock and kissed his temple. "Okay, that sounds much more sensible now and I agree. Nevertheless we still have to restrict her internet access and which Apps she uses when." He said. "If they weren't in danger, I wouldn't agree. But then again, in that case I wouldn't have a say at all in that matter." He said and huffed a laugh.
John chuckled and brought a hand up to Sherlock cheek. "Yeah, I think that's good enough." He smiled, before leaning in to pull Sherlock into a kiss. He was already a bit wistful about not being able to snog Sherlock in the flat whenever he wanted.
"Erm.. it's gonna be a surprise." Charlie said and scratched the back of her head. "Which roughly translates to 'I don't know yet.' You know, I just don't want to give them something they won't like, so, I'm still brainstorming."
"I'm curious to find out what exactly that means then." Charlie replied truthfully and gazed out of the window. It wasn't like Molly, Rachel and Greg had been ignoring them, so well, she didn't really know what to expect.
Charlie watched out for cars before getting inside they're own. "Hold on, I'll just help you." She smiled as she strapped Rosie in, before buckling up herself.
Lowell shook his head at that, "I don't know what's up with that anyway, it's almost getting ridiculous how many people suddenly pop up again." he chuckled.
Sherlock nodded, "Well.. we have a flight to catch then.." he said and held John's ticket and passport out to him."
"Spoken like a diplomat. You know, I have to admit, there are so many things one can't explain that a completely rational individual may believe in vampires. Things like, contradictory records on injuries or an unexplainable fatigue or nausea." Dr. Moran said with another look into the file.
"Yeah, I should probably go and talk to her." Sherlock said, taking John's hand without even thinking about it. After what just happened, holding hands didn't seem like a big deal anymore.
"Yeah! It's amazing!" Rosie said with a big smile on her face, before looking back to the camera, "Alright, now say cheese!" Sherlock said and started the timer, before quickly moving to stand between them, lifting Rosie up so she was in the middle and high enough for all of them to fit on the photo.
"Oh, I'm 106 years old." Rachel replied with a smile, figuring she had to be the youngest of the three. "What about you?" She asked John, who replied. "I'm actually twenty years old; biologically as well as datewise." Rachel bit back a little giggle and looked a little stunned at John. "One can never tell. I was going to say you've aged well." John chuckled at that. "Well, thanks nevertheless." Rachel glanced back at Sherlock. "So it's only you wanting to work here?"
“You’re disappointed in her continued drinking and her crumbling marriage—don’t waste your time, I give them about three months, tops. You feel attracted to a friend of yours, and you hope he’ll make a move, because you’re too unsure about to do anything and you’re concerned about his age.”
Sherlock paused when he stepped into the bright morning sunlight, squinting slightly. He had been planning on going to school (it had been a bit too long since he had been there last), but now the prospect seemed nauseating.
Yet here he was, actively
“Sorry, was he serious?” Lestrade asked, glancing at Sherlock nervously.
“So what have you been up to for the past couple weeks? You said you went to Florida,” John said after a few moments. As much as he wanted to get to his flat as soon as he possibly could and completely take Sherlock apart, he had missed so much more of Sherlock than just sex. He had missed being able to talk to him and listening to his stories and commenting about how brilliant he was as they both pretended that it didn’t make Sherlock blush every time.
John Watson was too honorable for his own good.
He swiped a tongue over one nipple, and Sherlock arched off the bed, moaning. John looked up at him and grinned, loving the way Sherlock was squirming under him. He ground his hips down onto him, their clothes cocks meeting through layers of fabric, and Sherlock threw back his head, digging his teeth into his bottom lip to avoid shouting out. John reached up and pulled the lip from his teeth.
“You’re Mycroft Holmes,” he said. If Mycroft was surprised that John knew him he didn’t show it. He merely gave an oily smile.
“Come on, John, it’s been so long since you’ve come out with us,” Bill had said over the phone.
“Yes, I am high, but don’t worry I’m done with it. Today was a…relapse. It won’t be happening again,” he said, not meeting John’s eye.
But he supposed that Lestrade was not the worst company they could have been in. And it would be helpful to have a friend on the force for when they would inevitably arrest the wrong person again.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean”—
"What--What do you mean?" Sherlock asked breathlessly.
He got dressed quickly, running late to class (again), because of Sherlock (again). Sorting through his things, he quickly found a pen and paper and scribbled a note telling Sherlock he had class. He knew Sherlock would probably roll his eyes and mutter “obviously” under his breath, but he didn’t want him to think and John had left because he wanted to.
“Great, me and some of the others will come pick you and Mike up at around nine,” he said, before quickly hanging up, not wanting to be on the phone long enough for John to change his mind.
“What? But you’ll be hours!” he protested. John’s grin widened.
“Not right now, but soon. You underestimate just how…sensitive my scalp is,” he said. All of the sudden, and evil grin erupted onto John’s face.
“Thanks, you’re a lifesaver, Sarah you really are,” he said gratefully. The words were right there, on the tip of his tongue, asking if she would go out with him again. The words were right there, yet somehow, he found himself only bidding her a good night and walking out. When he reached the street, he started the short walk back to his flat wondering why he hadn’t asked her out again. He liked her, she liked him. There was no reason not to.
“Excuse me, you need me to do what exactly?” John asked. Sherlock sighed as if John were being the unreasonable one here.
“Right, I should probably get back to work. Sarah’s probably wondering where I am,” he said, not meeting Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock nodded.
“What now, John?” asked Sherlock, his voice muffled against John’s skin.
“Well, if you would be, ahem, amendable”—
“Arse,” Sherlock said, narrowing his eyes. John grinned at him in mock apology, not in the least bit sorry. Sherlock was still for a heartbeat, then he suddenly surged upward and found all of John’s ticklish spots with unerring accuracy. John tried to give back as good as he got, but it was difficult when he was so breathless from laughing so hard. It was worth it, however, to hear the giggling sounds that Sherlock emitted, which he would most certainly never make had he any kind of control over it. John himself was laughing in a way that he hadn’t heard himself laugh in years, probably longer.
“Why not?” she asked coolly.
Sherlock broke off with a hoarse curse as John slipped the tip of his finger quickly. He slowly pushed his finger all the way in.
“See you later, Sherlock,” he said, sticking an arm out to hail a cab.
“Sherlock? What are you doing?” he asked wearily. He could see the empty boxes of biscuits littering the room. Sherlock looked up, smiling brightly.
“I like the sound of that,” he said, his voice so low it was almost a growl. Sherlock shivered. John pulled away from him reluctantly and did the worst closing job he had probably ever done, but he couldn’t focus when he could feel Sherlock’s intense gaze on him the whole time (particularly when he bent over). When he finally finished with cleaning everything and getting everything ready for whoever would be working the next morning, he walked over to Sherlock and stood on his tiptoes, kissing him again, thinking that he would never get used to the feeling of his lips against his own.
He added a second finger when he felt that Sherlock was ready for it, but he was so relaxed that Sherlock barely even felt the stretch.
“We shall be back tomorrow then,” Sherlock said, smiling brightly into the man’s dismayed face. “Until that time, we shall be doing your jobs for you, and finding your murderer.” Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson left the man glaring after them and Sherlock couldn’t help but looking over at Mrs. Hudson and smiling a bit. She shook her head at him, but returned his smile.
“Go away, Sebastian, or I’ll tell the class what you go up to last night,” replied Sherlock dismissively, sending his text to John, not even bothering to look at Sebastian and his loyal band of buffoons.
"Fuck Sherlock, you feel so good," he said.
“Jesus, I thought that one guy would never leave,” John said with a groan. Sherlock licked his lips at the sound, noticing how John’s eyes followed the movement. He smirked, leaning forward in his chair.
“As in America? Why?” John asked, wondering where this was going.
“Mm, let me try the raspberry,” he replied, opening his mouth and making no other move towards it.
Jesus, he really was a pervy old man.
“The housekeeper said she was baking cookies when the killer barged in, causing her to knock over the bag of sugar, which spilled everywhere on the table. The killer then, supposedly killed the housekeeper’s boss and presumably tried to burn the letter, but the table caught fire. But, the police showed up merely two minutes and fourteen seconds later—a personal best for Scotland Yard, I think—and the table was already almost completely burned. Not completely impossible if it had just been wood, given the type of wood and the size of the flame, but you forget! The housekeeper spilled sugar all over the table! Sugar doesn’t burn, and as I’ve just tested on your table, there are no household spices which could counteract the inflammable qualities of the sugar. Meaning, she has to be lying about something—but why would she lie if she had nothing to hide?” Sherlock finished a deep breath. It took John a few moments to get his brain to start up again.
“Well, they were
"You're so fucking sensitive," John muttered. After a few moments to catch his breath, Sherlock struggled with John's trousers with slightly shaking fingers. Finally, he managed to unbutton them and pull them down with very little help from John, who was fighting not to laugh at the sight of Sherlock battling with his trousers.
“Mike, shut up,” John replied. Before suddenly remembering the night before (well, that same morning really). “Fuck,” he said softly.
“Do whatever you need to,” John said, smiling. Sherlock descended on his chest, nipping and licking and kissing the skin in a very organized and methodical manner. John narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “Are you…categorizing what I taste like?” he asked, amused. Sherlock lifted his head, looking slightly guilty.
“I still have no idea”—
“John, really, do you think that with a brother like Mycroft there would be any chance that I would get anything less than regular checkups? I’m clean. And we don’t have to worry about you, you’re training to be a doctor, you get checked regularly as well,” Sherlock replied abruptly.
“Would either of you like some eggs or bacon? Coffee?” John said quickly before Sherlock did anything that could possibly get him arrested. But when he looked up at Lestrade, he found that the man was smiling.
Sherlock shifted in his seat and checked the time on his phone, wishing the plane ride would end soon.
“What are you doing?” he asked quietly. Sherlock smirked impossibly wider, leaning in until he was off his chair and his mouth was against John’s ear. John jumped when he spoke.
“Nobody cares,
“Yes, please,” he all but whined. The hand in his hair tightened and he thought he was going to come right there on the spot—there was no way John could have known his follicles were so sensitive.
“What, now you and Mike are talking about me behind my back?” he asked, teasing. Sarah giggled. From the corner of his eye, John saw Sherlock getting up and making his way over to him.
“I went to Florida,” he said abruptly.
“Fine, fine, I’ll come out with you guys,” he acquiesced. He could hear Bill’s grin through the phone.
“Well, when I first started, all the others were joking around with me, telling me all these horror stories and such, and they bring up this kid, who, a few years ago, got picked up out of the gutter after overdosing on cocaine, who woke up, yelled at them all about a recent case, and then passed back out. About a week later, they solved the case and realized that he had been right. Ever since then, this Holmes kid would call them and leave them these horribly rude ‘anonymous tips.’ I thought for sure they were just taking a piss, I didn’t think you were
"Yeah, that's true." John smiled back at him, before shaking his head a little. "You know, looking at you I get why people compare us to Disney films."
"Yeah sure, I just... kind of feel like a toddler in a retirement home." Harry joked and still looked dumbfounded, "Hey, mum is just roughly 30 years older than you." Sherlock said, looking at his cousin with a laugh, while he fumbled out his phone to look up a photo of Carl, holding it out to Janine with a smile. "His name's Carl." he said, still grinning as he imagined the way he'd react, hearing about her age.
"Yeah, my mum's mum." John said, before frowning. "Oh, you haven't met my other grandmother yet, have you?" He asked as he followed Vanessa into the kitchen.
"He absolutely hasn't." Sherlock said and frowned again sitting down next to John, "I guess part of it was that he witnessed how I felt after Victor died. Guess that wasn't exactly encouraging him to go and find someone for himself."
Sherlock chuckled at that and leant over to peck John's lips, "Erm Dolores?" Sherlock called and chuckled a little to himself, "Do you have shoe too?" he asked and Donna rolled her eyes, before turning to that family. "Sure, right over there." she said, not even bothering to offer to help this time.
Rosie had already pulled all her clothes out of the wardrobe and was now chuckling and entertaining herself, by sitting next to the pile and trying to hit her suitcase on the bed as it knocked at the door, "Come in!" she chirped, chuckling as a sock flew past her suitcase, landing on her bedside lamp.
"Oh.." Sherlock said and rolled his eyes a bit, but mostly about himself, for still being surprised that they were overheard sometimes, having two little spies living with them. "Well, yeah, we'd like that. If you want it as well, that is. You don't have to feel like you have to agree."
"Yeah, in my experience Santa can be surprising, so don't you worry about that yet." John told Rosie, after returning Sherlock's look. "By the way, what did he get you last year?"
Sherlock smirked, "Well, I've got to postpone that exploration, though. Is there a flower shop around your flat? We could share a cab and you go change while I get the flowers." he said and reluctantly removed his arms, before he climbed off the sofa to go refill his glass. "You want some more lasagne?" He asked, picking up his glass.
"I'm certainly glad we're all living here then." John said and kissed his cheek. "I'm sure you'll like Vanessa though. From what I can tell she does a great job of keeping them entertained." He said, remembering that she still thought Sherlock was a girl, a thought that made the earlier anger bubble up again.
"Me too!" Rosie said while Sherlock smiled down at his girls, before opening the car door and setting Rosie down on the floor so she could get inside, trusting that Charlie would help her with her car seat as they usually did as he walked around the car to get in as well.
"Nah, he's not like that at all. As long as you're being genuine, I don't think you'll have a problem with either of my parents. Same goes for Rosie and me by the way." Charlie said and chuckled.
"I don't think I want to know if he'd actually do that." John said, remembering the thing at the exhibition. "Roll up in a tank and a black dress and I'd marry you instantly." John chuckled; he was only really able to make a joke about that, since it seemed to him as if the matter of them marrying was just a question of 'when'.
John smiled and had to keep him himself from kissing Sherlock all over again; swollen lips really wasn't the look they should be going for. "Really, love? I remember me being the one to talk you down when we stood in front of that doorstep. It did help with my own nerves though in all fairness."
Charlie bit back a laugh of her own. "Yeah, that makes sense. And would they be able to use straws?" She asked her little sister as if seriously pondering that question.
John's jaw tightened just a little at the last part, but since he knew that was ridiculous, he swallowed another bite before saying. "Yeah, that's him. Any idea what he's doing there at this time of the year?"
"You're welcome to ask everything you want, you know. I was just sort of surprised..." Sherlock said and sat down next to John at the table after pouring himself another glass. "With most injuries, the best you can do for me is get me home and convince people I do not need to go to a hospital since you're a doctor.." he said and shrugged.
"Here, bloody put that on already." John said without any anger, once he saw he was shivering, and took off his jacket before holding it out for Sherlock to put his arms into it. "You're getting sick isn't going to help anyone. Where do you want to look for her then?"
"They're gonna adopt us?" Charlie asked, her both gaping wide open. Could they do it that quickly? She didn't want to get her hopes up too high. "Are you sure he wasn't talking about a sleepover?"
"You're impossible." John huffed a laugh, still staying close to him. "I'm almost glad there's not a rhinoceros hiding in the cupboard then."
"Not now." John said, a soft frown on his face and his eyes glued to the wall, as he began to go through those conversations with Victor he'd had in his dream.
Sherlock smiled, typing out a quick message and inviting Richard over, not mentioning John yet. It really would be difficult to explain all this in a mail. "He sometimes does.. rarely.. I mean.. I think the last time was a year or two ago.. it's just that for him.. I'm the closest connection to his roots.. that knew him before he turned and knew people he knew.. " he said and shrugged.
Charlie woke up to what she thought sounded like the front door falling shut. Wait, what? Weird, it was still dark outside. Weren't John and Sherlock still in bed? ...Did someone from that network manage to break in after all? With a frown she got out of bed to investigate this. ...And she sent Sherlock a text, just in case.
"You did." Sherlock said and gave her a smile, "John and I just realised that we couldn't imagine to let you go back to the orphanage anymore.. we've been thinking so basically since you've moved in, but it took us a while to work up the courage to take on that responsibility, to be honest."
"Well, that's kinda the idea of Christmas, isn't it?" John said, looking up to her with a smile, and passed her that piece of carrot. He and Sherlock hadn't exactly talked about that yet, but since they were planning to invite her over for Christmas anyway, they were obviously going to get her something.
"No, I really don't think that. I mean I know that that's a major part of your life, so I get that you want to talk about him. Besides I think he's an alright guy, so I wouldn't mind having him over every every now and then."
"Well.. That's what we agreed on, haven't we?" Sherlock asked and smiled a little, "Speaking of telling you things.." he began and looked towards the stairs, just to make sure the girls weren't anywhere near and could overhear them, "John and I are.. well, we're thinking about actually adopting the girls after all.. It's not a final decision yet, I'd just.. well, I'd like to know what you three think about it." he said, genuinely interested in their opinions. After all it would be a decision that would affect the whole family.
"Yeah? That is really huge." John said with a smile, sounding impressed, and took her hand. "I don't think they've got animals quite that big though, but they've got sea lions, you know."
"I'm not tired at all!" Rosie said and smiled, this was way too exciting to be tired, "Did you find something out about the bad guy?" she asked as she stood up.
Sherlock sighed, standing up and still glaring, he grabbed a blanket from the sofa and put it over Fay (because some reasonable part of him did still know that she was just a kid), tucking her into it so it wouldn't fall off, she couldn't pick it back up if it'd fall down after all, before he turned away and picked up Fays things from the table, just in case. "Shall we shall we carry her downstairs then?" he asked, looking at John.
"Perhaps it'd be better if I did.." Sherlock said, "Who knows, maybe if your dad sees you're with a respectable young man, rather than someone wearing a tight pink leather top, hot-pants and over-knee boots..." he said and laughed softly. "I guess it's the stereotype most fathers fear.”
John chuckled when he followed Sherlock's gaze a few seconds later and waved to them, before knocking on the door.
"I want to meet them too!" Rosie said and hopped a little on her feet, "Can we go in now?" she asked and Sherlock chuckled, nodding as he knocked three times at the door and waited another minute, which was a signal they had agreed on to let everyone know Rosie was about to come in and get into position. When that minute was over and Rosie looked about ready to burst from excitement, Sherlock opened the door, where all her family (even Mycroft which was a very special treat for Sherlock) waited for her in bee costumes and called, "Happy Birthday!" when Rosie walked in, her eyes wide as saucers. "Woah... We're IN a BEEHIVE!" she called and looked around excitedly.
"No, it wasn't." John said and closed his eyes, resting his head back on the bed. "Don't laugh, but I feel like I'm about to panic" He admitted after a while, because (even though it was irrational) he'd just drunk actual blood and had liked it and all of that was terrifying.
They had a relatively quiet ride to Janine's place, which was partly because Sherlock dozed off every couple of minutes, waking up with a 'what did you say something' which had Janine in giggles nearly the whole time until she eventually got off and left Sherlock alone in the cab to be woken up by the cabbie when they arrived at 221B. Quickly paying the man, he got out of the car and the fresh air did help wake him up a bit as he unlocked the front door.
"I mean, I've told dad that I'll give him Richard's number when he wants to talk to him again." John said and shrugged lightly. "I guess we'll just have to wait until that happens. And truth be told I don't think telling Richard would do any good; even though he is entitled to know "
The kiss consoled him a little, though he wouldn't have thought that his sister and boyfriend would bond that quickly. Harry swapped phones with Sherlock, still smiling. "Take care of that one, Sherlock. Call me any time, if you need some tips on how to annoy him." Harry chuckled and put the money away. "And don't let dad intimidate you."
"I kind of doubt you're going to find much boys in a boutique for prom dresses." Sherlock said and chuckled a little. "Plus, we're already torturing John with shopping, you can't put him through watching you flirt." he said, smirking teasingly at John.
"Why can't it be both?" Charlie chuckled. "By the way, would suggesting to watch a film to celebrate this be pushing my luck?" She asked with a chuckle and John kissed her head in response. "It would. Now, do you think you can manage the stairs on your own with that knee?" With a bit of a smirk, Charlie considered asking John to carry her up the stairs for a moment now that she was on his lap anyway. "Mmh.. I mean it still hurts a little. Could you maybe..." She said with puppy dog eyes (she'd become good at those). "Course I can." He said with a smile, before standing up holding her bridal style. "If photography doesn't work out you could always become an actress." He teased her with a chuckle.
Rosie smiled, "Okay." she said and followed Charlie down the stairs, "Do you want to see Sherlock and John? They made a photo with me and printed it for me!" she said and grinned, "It's in my room!"
Jane smiled, "He sounds like a good father." she said and chuckled again, "I always told him so, you know. He was always so good with the kids in the neighbourhood. He'd never admit it, but they love him and he loves them." she said grinning.
"You've got a lovely family from what I can tell." Viktor commented. "I don't think many people your age can claim that. Well, not people at all, I suppose."
"Okay!" Amy agreed with a smile. "Then I wanna go with Lock" // John chuckled a little, before looking over at the even shorter blonde. "Seems fair. What do you think Rosie?"
"What is something about yourself that you think might make me tell John to stop talking to you if I knew it? In other words what would I dislike most about you?" He said, still looking straight into Sherlock's eye. "And don't you lie to me."
"John... Jamie was lobotomised in a sanatorium in the 1950's.. I wouldn't put my money on long or happy." Sherlock said and looked at the bag, "You know maybe I could find out who they were if I extract..."
"Yeah, I get it. And I definitely agree that spoiling them is okay, but only to a point before it starts to become character damaging." Sherlock said and pulled John into his arms for a moment, resting his forehead against John's. "But I don't think it is so far."
Charlie had genuinely hoped he wouldn't figure it out that soon. She swallowed and looked down, figuring he'd probably be able to tell if she was lying anyway and she really didn't want to go down that road. "Erm, yeah, first of all I'm really sorry, but I didn't really think about it when I did it." She said, wishing she could just tell him in private. "I broke that promise I made to you this morning when I was at the ball." She began quietly, feeling as if a she'd been run over by a lorry. It hadn't even been a week since New Year's Eve and now she'd disappointed him again.. Meanwhile John raised and eyebrow at that kind of beginning. "It wasn't Jane's fault...  I'm sorry, it was just a few minutes and I just- Lowell was going to show me his-"
"Sure." William said with a shrug and started to take off his clothes, "Am I going to get my personal stuff back when I get out of here?" he asked, quite confident that he would soon get out, "And is there any chance I can call my brother? He's overseas in America at the moment, that's why I was with a foster family."
Sherlock smiled, following John out the room (finally, really it did feel somewhat awkward to be in John's parents' bedroom if he was honest). "Hmm, do you mind if we skip the sandwiches after all? I'd really favour something more.. liquid." he said as they walked down the stairs, his stomach growling in response. For some reason the his hunger had grown much worse in the few minutes since he had mentioned it. Perhaps his stomach was just a bit upset from drinking so much in so little time before.
"Okay, agreed. I like that better." Charlie nodded, before climbing onto the worktop to get out the pasta from the top drawer. "How does John feel about all of this anyway?" She asked him agree a moment.
"Okay, fine, I had that coming I guess. So, almost one year ago the twins were about to turn two and as you can imagine I didn't really have much of a clue what to get them. My then-girlfriend Sarah though had a younger brother who was I think six at the time. So when she had to look after her brother one afternoon, I went with her and she took us to that toystore and helped me pick something out for them. I got Amber a gift for them there as well. It's her turn this year, but if we're already there, I think we can get something for their birthday too."
"I can believe that,, Juan's really nice." Charlie smiled. "Do you know what Dad is doing?" She asked and closed her eyes.
"No.." Rosie said and shook her head, "But I'm sure it's really pretty!" she said and tried to lift her suitcase, grimacing a little, it was a lot heavier than it looked.
"So would I." He replied and smiled into Sherlock's neck. "I'm glad we could agree on that." He murmured and ran a hand down Sherlock's side. “Might be some extra motivation.”
"Well yeah.. basically.." Sherlock said and looked at her, visibly dumbfounded at the question, "I mean.. it's food .. were you thinking we'd use food against you and like.. ration it to make you behave the way we want you to?" he asked and frankly that was a ludicrous idea. He sure wasn't going to stop trying to find out more about the network and what they could do to stop them, but he wouldn't even think about using methods like that.
"Oh yes, that's one thing I'm very grateful for too." Sherlock said and pecked John's lips again, "Although maybe we should keep avoiding snogging in front of your parents as much as we can." he said and chuckled.
"That's a very interesting proposal." John said with a chuckle, stepping into the bathroom. "However, I still don't think I'd like Mrs. Hudson to ever walk in on that."
"Hm, I'm very glad about that too." Sherlock said and gave her another smile, "This whole being a dad thing.. it used to be scary which is why we struggled a bit with the decision, but it's actually pretty great." he said and chuckled, "Even though we constantly worry about you two and John and I barely have our bed to ourselves anymore."
John could've said that they'd never hated her at all and that certain family members were merely disappointed and acting out of frustration. He didn't though, because he found that having people just hate you was better than disappointing them. Instead he went for a more comforting but still honest approach. "I think he's just getting his priorities straight. And for him you are obviously far up there."
Sherlock chuckled a little, "Yeah, well given our pace, we should be on honeymoon already at this point." he said and looked at the lake, "So are we going for a boat trip or did you plan on using the bridge?" he asked, looking at John.
Amy smiled at her sister and nodded, before going with her sister to the door. After John had opened it for them he watched them go safely downstairs, before returning to Sherlock. He was still pulling himself together, but the worry and slight look of panic on his face were evident as he looked at his boyfriend. "So she's a vampire?"
"No, feel free to do that after I've showed you your room. Just stay in there from eight pm until six am, we're checking." He said, stopping in front of one of the doors and motioning for William to go inside.
"Something like that." Sherlock said and chuckled, "Speaking of cars, we should get into ours now. You look like you could fall asleep standing." he said and leant over to give him a brief kiss.
"I can imagine she'd like that quite a lot." John smiled, looking out of the window to see that they'd pretty much arrived. And a few the cab stopped right in front of Covent garden. After he'd pulled out his wallet to pay the cabbie (before Sherlock got the chance to do so this time), he slipped out of the cab and onto the street.
"Ah, good to know. And now he's invited us over for Sunday, yeah?" John asked, shaking his head a little. "Wonders do apparently still happen."
"Yeah, I think Vanessa and Paul will be more grateful for that particular present." John said with a chuckle. "Now we only have to get something for Amber and Mark and then our cousins will be off the list. Amber has told me she wanted the piano arrangement of some musical, so we can give that to her from the both of us."
Clara spit the blood-wine mixture back into her glass, coughing to get the rest out of her lungs. "/Mycroft/?!" She asked with wide eyes; she'd thought hell was gonna freeze over before he wanted to find a partner.
"I've no sodding clue. At least the walls are thin." He said, sounding pretty pissed off and regretting to have just said that. "Jesus..."
Sherlock chuckled, "Hm.. we could throw them away and buy new ones." he said with a grin, before he rinsed his mouth with mouthwash.
"Well, they're certainly smart enough to be your sisters." He said with a chuckle and tucked the older sibling in. "Honestly, I love Amber, but next to those two, we both look like idiots." He commented with a shake of head. "Anyway, you've never told me you're that good with kids."
"...and then we started to make school cones! Janine said that where she grew up when kids start school they get a huge back like a cone that's tied at the top and it's filled with a whole lot of sweets!" Rosie chirped as Sherlock opened the door for the three of them, before he set the girl down on the floor, handing her her bag, "Oh yeah, I've heard about it." Sherlock said and smiled, locking the door behind them before he walked over to the stairs, "Literally translated it'd be school bag, but bag as in plastic bag not like hand bag, wanna take a guess what they're called in German, Charlie?" he asked with a smile.
John chuckled softly seeing the way Sherlock was looking and pulled him into another kiss. "I like the fact you taste like wine and not that mouth wash for once." He commented with a chuckle.
Pressed even closer against the other two, John laughed as well. "An adorable dork." She said with a chuckle, turning his head a little. "Are you ever going to release us, so we can continue on the couch?"
"You can tell them about the other thing too." Sherlock said and leant over to peck John's lips, "But thanks for trying to preserve my dignity." he chuckled.
"No, I trust that you wouldn't." Emma said and smiled, "And.. well if I may say so, you two are wonderful grandparents." Sherlock said with a chuckle, "Oh, speaking of grandparents, John you haven't told David about my Christmas present for you, have you?"
"That's amazing. I sincerely hope I'll met a few more people from my past again." Janine said with a smile. "You know, actually I practically chose to become a vampire at the time together with a friend. Well, we thought of it more like demigods at the time, but you know, times change." She said and shrugged. "I've never told you about that sect, have I?"
"Hey, love. Everything alright? I'm in an auditorium right now." John said quietly, wondering what was wrong; Sherlock usually never called him at uni.
"That's.. a lot.." Lowell said and frowned, "How did you meet all of those?" he asked and Sherlock shrugged, sitting down on John's lap and moving one arm around his neck for support. "Well.. it's kind of a long story to be honest.. and we had sort of a long day.." he said, looking at John with a small smile, before he looked back at Lowell, "Look, I'm way too tired to go into all of this at the moment.. you could just give me your contacts and we meet up another time?" he asked, he really wanted to talk some more to Victor's brother and he could understand his curiosity, but the day really had been stressful enough. "Oh. Yeah, sure, I'm sorry.. I didn't mean to intrude, really.. it's just.. well.. it's intriguing to have found someone from my past.. or at least who knew someone of my family back then."
"Oh yeah" Charlie said and glanced outside, beginning to bag the last few things up. "When's Dad coming home today?" She asked, waiting for Sherlock pay and come pick Viktor up.
"Oh, yeah, I was actually. Long before my teaching career..." Greg remembered with a chuckle. "I was there right in the beginning; one of the first police officers of the Met once the police force was a bit more organised. I'd like to think I was young back then, but I guess I'm just very old right now." Greg said with a laugh. "Did Myc tell you that?"
"Yeah!" Rosie chirped, looking around for a bin for the stick of her lollypop, before spotting one in the kitchen and heading for it, "Can we have a lot of sweets?" she asked with a smile, "Because on parties people on TV always have a lot of sweets." she said and Sherlock chuckled, "Well, we'll see what John has to say about that. But we will have pizza."
John chuckled a little at how dramatic Sherlock was making this look and covered him with the duvet, before getting out of bed to get the thick woollen blanket they kept in the wardrobe. "I doubt she'll be able to do much against that."
Sherlock nodded, "Understood." he said and cleared his throat, "But since we're talking openly, it's probably best to tell you something else, John and I have been sort of dreading to bring it up and it's not yet official, but we have been talking about getting married. As I said, nothing official yet, we're not engaged, but I figured it would just be fair to give you a warning, so you are prepared once we are and come around letting you know, rather than just dropping that bomb on you out of the blue." he said and knew it was still a bombshell, but given that he couldn't prepare Mr Watson for the fact that he'd soon be reunited with his own father, he figured it was just fair to prepare him for this at least. And it would also make actually telling them about the engagement easier too.
John smiled a bit at that. "And I'm sure at least Sherlock would appreciate that a lot." He said with a chuckle. "And sure, I'll go tell him." John said and glanced at his watch. "If I'm quick, I think I could be back before the others come here. Especially the way I know Charlie." He said, figuring she wouldn't voluntarily leave a ball any earlier than necessary.
"Well.. going by the tradition neither of us is supposed to wear an engagement ring.." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "So I thought it'd be nice if we'd both wear one instead." he said and gave another shrug, "And I've been actually really annoyed back then I didn't get the opportunity to give that ring to someone.. you know... since the law didn't allow me to.." he said and Rosie frowned, scrunching up her nose and looking almost disgusted, "The law decides who can marry who? That's stupid. Was it made by hombophobs?" she asked, looking back and forth between her foster dads and her sister.
"Beautiful? Debatable. Very, very debatable." William said and rolled his eyes, taking a step back, mainly because he didn't want to have that angry sweaty face right in his face, not because he was scared of that ridiculous man. "I'm just not interested, deal with it."
"Yeah, I know, it feels the same to me, but I'm sure about it." John said with a nod. "And I trust you, so you may feel special now, because I'll still smack anyone else who comes too close to my arteries." He added jokingly.
Sherlock smiled, "While I really don't think your parents would know why exactly we're late, I still think we shouldn't be late." he chuckled, signing the card, before handing John the pen. "We have to drop by at a flower store on the way there, too. So we should probably get going.." he said and smiled.
"Alright." Victor said and smiled a little, "Oh and in case Sherlock wants proof that you really are a friend of mine.." he said and chuckled, "Give him this." he said and pulled an old askew Roman coin out of his pocket, "It's a lucky charm, he knows I'd rather swallow it than letting it be taken away from me. My father and I found it on our field when I was a little boy. He gave it to me." he said and smiled."
"Hm? Yeah, course. Weird dream, that's all." John mumbled absently, before going back to staring at the other side of the room. Because his subconscious had forced him to make a decision last night.. now was the time to contemplate it, apparently.
"So, you little violin prodigy," Sherlock said quietly, so only she could hear, "How about we're starting up those violin lessons tomorrow?" he asked with a small chuckle.
"Yeah these things tend to get more expensive the longer you wait so.." Harry said as she put her chucks back on, they didn't go so well with the dress, but oh well. "Hm, I'd offer to help, but if it's not about the chemical side, I'd be useless." Sherlock said as he took their glasses and brought them over before he went to grab the wine and bottle of blood, bringing it into the living room. "Well let's go then." Harry said and walked over to the door, "Hey Sherlock can I borrow that coat of yours? It's chilly outside." she said and Sherlock just nodded, "Take it." he said and chuckled as she put it on, having to lift the hem like a dress, "Good god you're a giant.." she said and laughed as she walked out the door like that.
"Well.. most of it was trying to cure me in various creative ways.. like creating a Pavlovian reaction to images of naked men.. you know, torturing the subject while showing them certain images so whatever those images show will eventually be linked to discomfort and pain subconsciously.." he said and gave a small smile, glancing at John, "Can't say it worked."
"No need for that, I just need to see that she's actually with you, if that's not too much trouble. Then you're good to go on your trip." Sally explained as affably as she could. It wasn't strictly necessary but she didn't trust this bloke.
"It's what fathers do." Jane said with a smile, "Speaking of that, are you sure you and Sherlock aren't blood related? Because I can see some very apparent similarities in your behaviour." she added with a laugh.
"Yeah, do that." John nodded with a smile. He found himself looking forward to playing with Rosie (and Sherlock of course); It was really a shame he had to go to work today and leave earlier. At least now he was sure it would be the right decision to make this his main side job. (Should he be accepted at least)
Sherlock nodded, taking his mother's hand, mostly to just be assured she'd not just disappear again, before leading her up the stairs, "So.. let me get this straight.. Amy and Ally are your biological children?" he asked as he led her into the flat. "They actually are my sisters? By blood?"
John gave Sherlock a warm smile. "Yeah, I've got a feeling mum will definitely love you after today. Sign my card, so we can give her the gift I got her together, yeah?" John said, moving to walk towards the kitchen and pulling Sherlock with him.
"Good, I'm glad." John said and closed the door behind himself, careful not to be too fast, because damn, Victor was impressive; the story book picture of a trained 18th century soldier. He could definitely see what Sherlock liked about him and he certainly didn't want to get into a fight with him in any case."Right, you call him William here." John remembered and shook his head a little. "Okay, so first off, do you already know about his, erm, I don't know how to put this in case-" John began carefully, before spotting tell-tale bruises on Victor's neck; thank God, he already knew about the vampire thing. "Good, forget what I just said." He said. "Going by your literal love bites, I'm safe to assume you know about the vampire thing too, right?" He asked, just so that they were on the same page.
David nodded at that, still wearing that poker-face. "Good answer." He said and stepped closer towards Sherlock, completely ignoring their height difference. This young man was smiling a bit too much for his liking and David wanted to make sure he wouldn't forget their conversation any time soon. His voice dripping with authority, he spoke again." And same goes for me. If I hear you aren't doing what you've just so passionately said or treat him badly in any way, I'll come after you myself. Understood?"
"I don't know if I'll get them to do that." Sherlock said and frowned, "But well, we'll have time to teach her at home." he said and smiled, "That's also not bad. And of course if you want, we can go through some more advanced material as well." he said and smiled, "I guess you're quite bored in school, aren't you?"
"Oh don't worry, what you actually missed was once again panicking about Rosie disappearing." Sherlock said and sighed, "She actually didn't completely pay the sandwiches.. she didn't have enough pocket money so she wrote the cashier a note that she would come back on monday and pay the rest and left all her money on the counter, before she just walked out of the shop."
Charlie pocketed her photo and turned on her torch, before beginning to walk back downstairs. "True. That's why you shouldn't hang it up on your wall. But if Sherlock frames it for you, you can still put in into your bookshelf, drawer or hang it on the inside of your wardrobe." She suggested.
Sherlock smiled and handed the driver a fifty pound note, "Keep the change." he said and got out of the car, holding his hand out for John, "So... lets see what they have to tell us then.." he said, "Either way.. after today I at least won't have to fake a migraine anymore, so that's good." he said and chuckled.
"Don't be like that, love." Sherlock said and leant in to press a chaste kiss to John's lips - given that he had had some of the blood sauce before, he really couldn't do anything else, so that'd have to do. "You're the only one I'd exchange make-up tips with while looking antiquities.." he said with a chuckle, before sitting down again. "Wait so.. you're really related?" Harry asked, glancing at Clara questioningly, "So one of your parents was a sibling of one of his parents?" she asked, unsure how to phrase the actual question about Sherlock being just as old or if he was a descendant of Clara's family.
"Okay! Did you know that when you're lost and it's really cold outside, you have to cuddle too, so you don't freeze?" Rosie asked as she took John's hand, "Like the bees!" she said and started to tug the two men along again.
"No, and I'm glad it doesn't." John said and wrapped his arm around Sherlock to hold him close; even if he wasn't exactly strong right now. "By the way, you think I could beat you in a race now?"
“Well.." Sherlock said and was about to form some sort of argument about him staying because Sherlock might not leave him, but he still didn't want him to go, but then decided against it, "Maybe he'll be proud of you for going through with it.." he said and sighed, scrunching up his nose a little at his own words. But he just really wanted John to be happy and if possible without compromises. The chance of John getting the respect and pride of his father he deserved kind of trumped his own fear.
"Me to." John said with a smile. "And if it weren't for the fact I like looking forward to celebrating that with the family, I'd almost be surprised we're still not married after almost two whole months." John joked and leaned in to kiss Sherlock.
"He did?" David asked, before climbing down the ladder now that the lamp was working properly. "From all I can tell I have no doubt that you will, Rosie." He said with a smile; and it was true, she was unusually talkative for her age. So both of the girls they'd taken in were that smart?
John chuckled a little and sat down next to Rosie on a chair that didn't have a personalised cup right in front of it, figuring they had spare ones when children wanted to switch tables. It was a bit tricky, but his boyfriend would have more trouble to sit down properly. "Really? I have two cousins your age who could eat pasta just about every day."
"Hm if you've got some names they maybe used more often, like I do for instance with my three first names, I tend to use them in turns." Sherlock said and chuckled, "If you've got some data and maybe even a good enough memory for some sort of composite sketch, Mycroft has a lot of contacts and I'm sure we could get some history students to help find specific people for a few pounds too." he said and shrugged, "It'd be a nice challenge, if you would like to find them that is."
Amy grinned back up at her cousin's boyfriend, before 'running' over to him. Wrapping her tiny arms around him (at least partly) she snuggled into his side. He was one of the good grown-ups, she could tell.
"Yeah, I guess I'm still in denial about that." John said and huffed a laugh, before taking Sherlock's hand to walk outside. "It looked cosy on the picture." Charlie commented with a smile.
"It's a good idea!" Rosie said and looked out of the window again, looking at all the posters and adverts outside, "John, do you think we can pet some of the animals?" she asked curiously as she started to undo her seatbelt.
"Well it sounds not horrible.. which would be a step up." Sherlock said and sighed again, pushing the blanket away since he had the excuse of getting changed now, if that got him out of this hell fire cocoon he was game.
Charlie's eyes widened at that. "Executed?! I know it used to be bad, but-" Bloody hell... But it was nice to know Sherlock didn't immediately fall in love with a guy he'd spend the rest of his life with.. She sort of always thought that's what he'd done. "So what's Victor like?"
"Nice to meet you." Sherlock said and unlocked the door, waiting for Rosie and Charlie to get in first, just to be safe.
Amy followed Rosie and looked around with wide eyes. "Your home is so big." John watched them with a smile and took Sherlock's hand. "This was a great idea. I think this is the happiest I've seen Rosie."
"Okay.. who was the weirdest boyfriend you ever had and why?" Sherlock asked with a chuckle.
"Oh don't be such a baby, love." Emma said and Sherlock couldn't hold back a chuckle now. "It's for Rosie. Can you imagine how disappointed she'd be if everyone's there in costume and only one party pooper isn't.." she said and looked at her husband.
Charlie stopped and thought for a moment if it was wise to tell him she was a vampire.. Then again, she had already chosen sides hadn't she? And it'd be a hard lie to maintain.. "said with a smirk, figuring that
"It's a serious problem, you know." John said, washing the tomatoes, before beginning to chop one up. "If I'm not careful I'll be keeping you in my arms for hours just because you're too comfortable lean into." He chuckled, looking up from his tomatoes.
"631.856.217 pounds and 32 pence last I checked.." Sherlock said and couldn't help but laugh at John's expression.
"See you two tomorrow then." Sherlock said with a smile, before turning back to the elevator to call it already.
The next morning John awoke slowly and nuzzled back into his boyfriend's chest at first without opening his eyes. Breathing in Sherlock's familiar smell, he took his sweet time to wake up properly. Even after two weeks of living together, waking up next to each other was still as precious a moment as it had been the very first time.
"Oh speaking of the pie, I invited Viktor over again for Saturday, I hope that's alright with you two. There was no way he could take all the dog food with him at once." Sherlock said as he stood up to empty and rinse the dog bowl.
Sherlock eventually returned to the living room, walking over to John's chair, "Six plastic bags and I've put it into the fridge, so it's less likely to something leaks into my bag when I bring it to the university and the plastic bags rip for some reason." he said and straddled John's lap, smirking at him, "And I could have at least made a quick check on female or male."
"What took you so long." Sherlock murmured with a nasal tone, glancing up at John and lazily reaching for the blood John was holding, nipping at it. "Why do you look like you're enjoying this?" he asked, sounding slightly offended.
"What flavour?" Ron asked, really enjoying the impressed expression on Charlie's face. "We can mix them too you know, if you want chocolate and strawberry for instance." he said and took one of the 'double cups' as his dad called them, they were plastic ups with a little wall inside so one could have two flavours in the same cup and the lid had two separate straws as well.
"Oh okay I can do that!" Rosie said and laid back, closing her eyes firmly, "Are you lying too already?" she asked, but didn't peek to check, because then the starry night she already imagined would probably go away.
"Sherlock, I've been a teacher for quite some time now and I've known this girl for well over two years. When making pedagogical decisions I always think about the child's well-being first and by telling me otherwise you'd be insulting me severely." Greg said soberly. He didn't really know where that had come from (Sherlock had seemed more composed when he'd first met him) and he didn't really take offence, but he wasn't going to put up with an attitude like that before their first lesson together. As if he didn't know that making a child cry was awful.. What a wonderful morning this was indeed. "Now, I won't have a conversation like that out on the corridors, so if you want to talk to me about one of the children, we can do that in private." He said with a sigh. "Anything else?"
“Hm.. I think you might be right" Charlie said, looking at herself in the mirror. "What do you think, dad?" Yeah, purple looks very pretty on you." John smiled and pulled out his phone to take a picture. "Now smile for Rosie" He said and took the picture when she grinned into the camera.
"Yes, tea. And if you promise not to hit anyone, we can untie your hands, not your feet though." Sherlock said and gave her a proper parents look, "If you do hit someone or try anything, your hands are going to be tied up again."
"I'm fine." Sherlock said, laughing again as he watched Charlie, "Do you think she'll sleep tonight?" he asked with a raised brow, though he was still smiling.
"Sherlock I've literally no idea... Maybe he could think Molly's not a threat anyway?" John suggested with a shrug. "Or Rosie mistook him for someone else.. though that would be quite the coincidence."
"I can't believe you're someone who'd put something like that off. Maybe someone"s hid a skeleton somewhere in there." She joked with a chuckle and followed Sherlock into the other room.
"Hm.. well, obviously I can't be sure, but there is a very good chance that John and I won't need the flat on the next few July 27th's.. at least not in the evenings, since obviously you'd have to go through the usual afternoon with cake and family, but after those John and I definitely have a lot of 'getting out of the way since we're just boring adults' to do with Mrs Hudson." he chuckled.
"Sure you can." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "She's actually pretty much my best friend." he said with a smile, "And I think she'd be glad to meet you. She really likes talking about her works, she actually teaches about them at Cambridge, must be frustrating not to able to tell people that she isn't just 'interpreting' the books and guesses what the author meant, but that it is exactly what the author meant." he chuckled.
Sherlock chuckled, "Hm.. what do you think, John.. should we have a long, dragged out breakfast, before opening the presents?" he asked, looking at his boyfriend with a smirk.
"No worries, that makes sense." Viktor nodded. "But back to your problem, that girl might approach me again or I might just see her on the street. What do you want me to do when that happens?"
Some time before nine, John and Victor returned to the empty shed. They'd spent the past few hours partly at Victor's camp and partly looking for Rosie themselves. Victor's mates had promised to look out for her, so now that they were about to meet up with the others, they couldn't do much more than wait. "So, when did you decide to join the army?" John asked him, as he closed the door behind them.
When Jane turned back to the dancing crowd and realised that one particular pair was missing, she rolled her eyes, murmuring, "Dammit, Sherlock, are you sure she isn't blood related to you?" to her self before she excused herself and made her way through the crowd to look for the two troublemakers.
"Always." Sherlock said and ruffled her hair, "That's what I'm here for, you know. Well that and cooking, driving you around and pocket money, obviously." he joked.
"I- yes, dad. I'll keep that in mind." David said after a moment and looked down on the table for a short while. "You've already met Harry and John then?"
''Ah, okay. Are we talking just maths here or anything else?" Greg asked after a moment, because with their shortage in teachers he believed Dorothy would hire people even before they were teachers. But damn... this fellah reminded him of someone.
Sherlock hummed into the kiss, moving his chair closer to John's without breaking the kiss, moving his arms around John's middle as he was close enough, "You know.. this would be way more comfortable in bed.." he said and broke the kiss just long enough to stand and pull John up from his chair and right back into his arms, where he brought their lips back together.
"Nope." Charlie said with a chuckle. "It's much smaller. And maybe your mum can show us the recipe. I really like cooking." She said with a smile and took another sip.
"Can you really get us some cookies, Lock?" Rosie asked and Sherlock smiled, "Anything for you, bumblebee." he said and tapped Rosie's nose, making her chuckle. "Any other orders?" he asked, looking back and forth between Charlie and Rosie, "Hot chocolate? Tomato juice?" he asked with a smirk.
"Hmm, we could get muffins for breakfast in that case. Or waffles with syrup." John suggested. Not because he was hungry, but because waffles with syrup were a much nicer thing to think about. Maybe that'd help put Sherlock's mind at ease a bit.
"That's right, so take all the time you need. At least until the shop closes that is" John told her with a wink and Charlie grinned at them. "This is soo awesome. Like, seriously, best. Shopping trip. Ever." She said, already looking around eagerly.
"Just to make me more comfortable with it," Sherlock said, by which he meant, letting Charlie try it out and see if it was okay for her, "We could try it out first, like maybe you stay home alone for about half an hour while John, Rosie and I go to the supermarket down the street?"
Sherlock smiled faintly and yawned, holding his throat as he did so. "Maybe bring a truck load of aspirin too."
"Oh, no sorry, it's just that rolling my eyes is my body's natural reaction to hearing, thinking or speaking my brother's name." Sherlock said and nudged John's nose with his own, "I wouldn't roll my eyes about you feeling weird about this. I was just saying that it could be worse.." he said and cupped John's cheek with his hand.
"I have a feeling you're right about that." John said with a chuckle and got inside the car. "Nah, just because we could, that still doesn't mean we actually want to do everything ourselves." The response came from the back, just before Charlie buckled Rosie up. "And there we go."
"Highly gifted?" Viktor offered with a smile. This family was becoming more and more likeable in his opinion. They surely weren't ordinary, though, he could tell.
The next day passed quite uneventful - luckily, as that meant Rosie and Charlie hadn't been caught breaking into Mrs Hope's office a second time, after retrieving his phone from Charlie, who he had given it to to send him the photos while he was in class, Sherlock made his way to the registrar's office, hoping he could somehow get a hold of older adoption files. Arriving he walked up to the guy at the counter, smiling at him.
"No you couldn't have. And thanks, I appreciate it." John replied, noticing this was the first time he'd ever thanked someone for refrigerating a brain. "So, how was your day?" John asked with more of a smile and rested a hand on Sherlock's thigh.
Sherlock smiled, rolling his shoulders a bit after that fierce hug, "Yeah, he did. They're real though. My grandfather's.." he said, practicing his story already. "He served in the second world war.. been a while since I had an occasion to wear them." he said and chuckled lightly. "So.. which of them is 'uncle David' then?" he asked and swallowed as he looked around, "Does it happen to be the guy who's shooting daggers at me with his stare." he asked quietly, still looking at the man and his wife who had her hand on his shoulder from the corner of his eyes.
Charlie giggled a bit a followed Lowell into the kitchen, loving the fact that the first thing they were doing together was breaking the protocol; and it wasn't like Jane was really gonna notice the short time they were away.
"Sure." Sherlock said and carefully lifted Amy out of the car, trying not to wake her up as he carried her over to the door, "Thanks for coming with us today, by the way. I really think it was good for Rosie to get out of there for a while." he said, looking down at his sleeping sister. "And find some new friends." he said with a chuckle.
Charlie was lying on her bed when Sherlock opened the door, her face hid in the front of John's shirt so she didn't see much of the light. He'd sat down on her bed a while ago and she'd been lying half in his arms ever since, while he ran his fingertips over her head. Her sister had spent most of the day in here with her, thankfully in silence. When Charlie heard John talking, she just grunted a bit. "Hi love. Have you got the aspirin?" John mouthed, when he saw his fiancé (he still felt excited about that).
"He is, but he's already been that before he was assaulted." Victor said and smiled, thinking for a moment, "Are you going to do it? If I don't turn.. will you? I assume the matter's come up since he knows how to do it by now."
"That's... underwhelming news to be honest." Charlie said and looked over at Sherlock. "But I'm getting driving lessons out of it, so I'm not complaining."
"Lying to her about it won't make it any better though, and I think Harry will tell her anyway." Sherlock said and smiled, "You know.. perhaps what really brought the change was the fact that he realised he doesn't want to lose his kids love and trust over this. And I really wouldn't say he gave us his blessings. He really didn't look happy about it when I told him. It was more light... grudgingly accepting it as something he can't change."
"As long as I'm your favourite hobby, I'd be okay with that." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, smiling at John, "He did forget to mention that he's also planning to join the service in his free time," he said, not in an accusing tone, but he just thought Charlie should be prepared for this, rather than hearing about it when John actually had to go.
"Well for vampires it's not standard to have a doctor at hand and yeah, I'd suggest that if you've got one to go to, go to them. Infections are still a threat for vampires. They don't kill us, but they can get really uncomfortable, because we still get the same symptoms." Sherlock said and smiled, "Luckily we do have Molly, Paul and John now." he said and smiled, "We're well on our way to start up our own little vampire community, with all the vampires we know telling vampires they know about these things. And maybe there will also be some other lucky kids to get genuinely adopted, now that more vampires will know about the orphanage."
"Good call." Paul said and walked up to the girls on the sofa. "Hello Rosie, hello Charlie." He said and opened his bag. "Hi Paul" Charlie croaked and watched him. "Sherlock called me last night and told me you two were sick, so I thought I'd have a look at you. Is that okay?" He asked and Charlie nodded.
"No, I'm good." Sherlock said and smiled, "It's really gotten better.. I'm a lot less .. paranoid." he said, taking another bite of his sandwich, "Although I'm not sure if that's because except for uni John and I are doing practically everything together."
"Well what did he say he use to be like?" Jane asked with a soft chuckle, "Well the way I know him .. he's aloof, sometimes rude, childish, yet he's got a soft heart, which more than makes up for that." she said and smiled, "What's he like in your time?" she asked curiously.
"Good, now I feel a bit more reassured." John said with a soft chuckle and leaned forwards to kiss his cheek (he didn't really need a repeat of yesterday, frankly), resting his hand on Sherlock's thigh.
"True. It would at least be good to know when she got into the network." John nodded. "We'll break the news to Charlie tomorrow morning, I mean it's only Sunday, so we can't really keep a girl in the basement from her if she's here all day. Are we going to tell Rosie though?"
Sherlock chuckled, "Ah, same thing actually.. another reason why it's fortunate to study biology and chemistry over and over again." he chuckled, shaking his head.
Wait, what? Charlie almost stopped dead in her tracks at hearing that. ...Bisexual? So this was a date after all? "What? No, not at all. I was just taken by surprise a bit." She said, giving him a genuine smile. The game, she thought, was still on.
"They're well.. probably going to end up with a little hangover, Clara at least, but basically they're all well." Sherlock said and flopped down on the bed next to John, "By the way, before I forget to tell you, Charlie's sleeping on the sofa, she's been watching her videos all night.." he said and yawned.
"OH! Coming!" Charlie called and ran to the front door, a big smile on her face when she saw them. "Hi dad, hi paps!" She said flung herself into John's arms while Sherlock was busy with the little ones. "Hi there. I'm so happy to see you again" John said and wrapped his arms around her, having to step against the wall because of her impact.
"Hm, right.." Clara said with a frown, not sure what she had expected here. "Oh, there she comes." She said and gave Janine a smile. "I hope you haven't missed me too much" She said with a chuckle and picked her glass of champagne back up after sitting down next to Sherlock.
"Yeah, I think after the second one he decided to take us in." Charlie said with a bit of a grin.
"Yeah. Sounds more posh than it is. There are a few young teachers, so that's cool." he said with a smile.
John laughed a little, as he hailed a cab. "Right. If I'm going to come clean, I should do it properly. But I'm sure, they'd stop listening after the first part."
"What did you do in a sanatorium in the fifties?" John asked with a frown and turned his back on the window to turn around to look at Sherlock.
Rosie smiled and mirrored Charlie's position, turning a page just when she did, except that she couldn't read what her file said. "Is that your file?" Rosie asked after a moment, leaning over to look at the file Charlie was holding.
"Of course I won't" Naturally this really was nudging him towards a certain decision. "I've told you that my whole family turning wouldn't change my mind. I'm just that selfish. You don't have to worry about me, okay?" John said with a sigh, hoping this would come off as comforting rather than egotistical.
"Really?" Charlie asked Rosie with a smile, happy to play along. "Is that why they use bowls and not glasses?" Meanwhile Viktor chuckled fondly at how happy Rosie looked to get to explain things to her family.
"Yeah. I wanna stay.. with you." John said and was able to calm down more when he felt warmer a few minutes later; though his shock symptoms were becoming frightening, as if his body was telling him he was soon going to die. "How much?" He asked about ten minutes later.
"That's right, but I do end up sharing the foods with him that we can both eat. But he can't eat for example onions." Viktor explained kindly to Rosie. Meanwhile John remembered that this was there first completely blood free meal in... months. Or was it? "Did you by any chance put tomatoes into-" He began to ask Charlie who shook her head. "No no, I used the traditional recipe."
"I don't know.. No, I don't think so, actually." Sherlock said and sat up a bit, closing his laptop, "I mean, I know it was the plan, but I don't really want something to happen to spoil your party."
"Well anyway, not that I don't appreciate Ron getting beat up to save Charlie, but I'd really like to have more between Charlie and a kidnapper than a fourteen year old artist." Sherlock said with a little smile.
Sherlock smiled as he returned with three bottles filled with blood (he had taken his own as well) and one filled with orange juice for Ally. "Are we all set?" he asked as he put the bottles on the backseat.
"You're welcome, William." The nurse said and took some notes on a a clipboard before collecting William's clothes and leaving again, locking the door behind himself.
"I don't think you're irresponsible, love." John said seriously, before pecking his cheek.
"Thank you." Sherlock said and only now realised how much it actually meant to him that he could celebrate his birthday with his mother again. Or rather celebrate his birthday again at all. Since Victor died there had been no one to remind him that it was a special day, so this kind of felt like too much already, but he had to admit that at the same time, he really liked it.
"It's no problem." Ron said and Rosie grinned at him again, "Thank you." she said, because she knew the look Charlie gave her meant she should say thank you. "You're welcome." he said as Rosie hopped up on the bed, "I'll get some tomato juice. Do you want tomato juice too?" she asked, looking back and forth between Ron and Charlie.
Sherlock chuckled a little, "Being a housebreaker doesn't mean your food is bad." he said and Harry chuckled to himself, starting the car again. "I really can't believe this, you know.." Harry said with a smile, turning to her brother again, "I mean.. dad didn't seem like he'd ever come around and now.. it's nice to think my family doesn't actually hate me as much as I believed." she said quietly.
"Of course, you can. I can use every little helper." Mrs. Hudson said with a warm smile, waiting for Sherlock to let her down. "I was thinking we could make a cherry pie What do you think?" Meanwhile Charlie had returned to her Dad's side and leaned back into him, before he put his arm around her.
Rosie grinned at that, climbing onto her bed to reach her kinder egg bees, pulling one off, before she got off her bed again and walking over to David, "Here, for you!" she said with a smile, "Sherlock, John and I made it together."
"Sure, see you in a minute." John nodded and took his little cousins by their hands, frowning a little at Rosie, who almost seemed upset. "So, we'll just have to go down here and through the door at the very end over there." He explained to the toddlers as they walked to the hive.
"What's that?" Charlie asked. "Isn't intelligence how well you do on an IQ test or how quick you understand stuff? How can you be smart about feelings?"
"Well.. I could have my mum bring that up. She will get it.." Sherlock said and shrugged, "I'm sure she can wrap that up in all sorts of fancy terms Mrs Hope will love." he said with a chuckle, before he pulled out his phone, "But one step at a time, first I have to ask her about the zoo." he said and typed out a message.
"I think she likes it." John said with chuckle as he watched her with a big smile. All of the prepping had been so worth it. Charlie of course ran straight after her to point out some of the details. "Here, right in there's a honey fountain." She said after she'd caught up with her.
Ron gave her a little smile, "You're worth it." he said, placing the peas aside since he rather wanted to continue the drawing while he waited for John, "If that was all just a trick to get rid of me, you really have to come up with something better." he joked, trying to make her feel a bit better about it. He didn't love the situation, but that wasn't enough to scare him away.
"Well, if they do and they tell you about keeping it from your friends and possibly just disappearing from their lives.. well, John and I are the best example that it isn't always necessary. You should think for a while about it if you want to tell someone about .. well all of that, but sometimes, it really is worth it." Sherlock said and looked at John, before looking back to Charlie, "I just wanted to tell you that, since I'm not sure how they'll handle that in class."
"Seriously? I've barely met him and I know his name." John said, looking a bit incredulous at Sherlock's obvious disregard for that.
"Okay." Rosie said and looked up at Paul, "Can I look into your bag?" she asked curiously, though her voice was still raspy.
Sherlock chuckled, "I'm serious, I told him that we've talked about it and that I just think it's fair to give him time to get used to the idea instead of springing it as a surprise on him. He appreciated that. I mean.. he wasn't exactly happy about the whole thing, but he didn't shoot me, so I suppose that's as much of a blessing we can expect from him at this point."
“So they are.. and that almost everywhere." Sherlock said and smiled as he took the box from John again, taking the ring out and smiling at him, "May I?" he asked with a wide smile, quite eager to put that ring onto John's hand.
John smiled and stood up to walk over to Sherlock, watching his boyfriend's expression. "Fine, but tonight you're mine." He said, before pecking his cheek. "You really like him, don't you?'
Sherlock was about to ask if he was supposed to leave the room, or the house, but decided to just return to John and Emma, so he just nodded and made his way out of the room, going back downstairs and giving John a wary look as he returned, not sure what to say, really. He had no idea if that went well.. or not? Had this just gone horribly wrong? There was the possibility that David would throw him out of the house when he'd come back downstairs.
"Hm, well it would be more sustainable." Charlie chuckled and sat back. "Did you decide to become like us though?"
John didn't agree entirely, but chuckled warmly and went back to eating his food. So as not to upset his new boyfriend with a joke on being unfaithful, he bit back a comment on how he best liked those hot. "I really like this, you know. Us two cooking and eating together, I mean." He said commented after a while.
"I'd actually prefer getting to kiss you on our wedding." Sherlock said and chuckled lightly, "Although... if you have decided by then, we might not have to keep worrying about that when we get married."
Sherlock chuckled, "Yeah... I reacted similarly." he said with a laugh and shook his head, "But yaeh he does, with Amy, they needed someone as a guardian they trust and who'd know what Amy needs if something should happen to both of them. Amber isn't old enough to get custody, so .." he shrugged.
"Mould is technically alive as well, since it's a fungus." Sherlock said and smirked, "Therefore, by your moral codex, you must not hurt it." he said and chuckled, moving over to John and pulling him into a kiss.
"Oh, that would be great." John said and went over to the desk to give Ron both paper and a pencil. He had definitely a lot more respect for this boy. "Can I still have a look at your nose and lip?"
"I think it's romantic to be honest." Charlie said and suppressed a giggle; she'd died just about four times while he'd sung. "And I really like the song; it feels kinda personal."
"Oh, well, erm..." John scratched his head a bit. "Yeah, right now he doesn't want to have  anything to do with Richard. Like, at all. I think he feels betrayed and abandoned by him, the way he talked to me on the phone afterwards. He said a proper father should act differently, well, I'm paraphrasing here. He's not really great at talking about emotions; even threw Sherlock and me out after we'd told him." Violet nodded slowly at that. "Yes, that sounds much like your father... I'll try to talk to him."
"Well.. it's completely up to you, of course. I just wanted you to know that you do have that option.. what with six vampires in the family, possibly seven even, it might be worth to seriously consider it." Richard said and frowned, "Sorry if that came off as pushing you to do it. I didn't mean it that way."
"Okay, love. How about we bring some milk downstairs together? I wanted to have a little chat with Mrs Hudson anyway." John said, really just wanting to ask Mrs. Hudson to keep Rosie downstairs for a few more minutes so that they had some time to talk. With that he set Charlie back on the ground to stand up and get that milk for Rosie.
"Hm, but the colour is really great on you." Sherlock said and looked at John, "What do you think?" he asked.
John stood up and walked over to Sherlock and sighed. "It's a good thing that orphanage exists. I don't know what would've happened to those kids otherwise... I mean... if they'd got picked up by some criminal ring instead, it'd have been even more difficult to escape that than for 'normal' children." He shook his head a little and took Sherlock's hand once he was done cleaning.
"Oh hey, how about you try that one." Sherlock said and took another dress, which was more of a wine red, but mermaid style, it had the same neckline as the one before, but no sleeves, yet he did want her to try out various styles of dresses so she'd find what she liked and didn't feel forced to pick a kind of dress he found suited her best. "It's a mermaid dress, let's see how you like that." he said and stuck the dress beyond the curtain of the changing room, without looking into it.
Sherlock smiled, "I'll help you with that too. You know, I can always throw my studies and help you out with yours more and helping out with that orphanage too. That sounded like they could use some more help. Mum told me they currently have about seventy kids there, if you can believe it and that's only the one in London." he said with a frown, still confused about the motive behind turning kids and killing off the parents.
"Well, yeah.. but to be honest, I think he was extra hesitant because one of his kids was still undecided since becoming more or less immortal also means he'd have to watch you die if you after all had decided against it." Sherlock said with a shrug.
"It's a good thing you're sure about that, otherwise marriage might not be the best call for us." John said and huffed a laugh. "At the very least it'd feel like that to me. I'm as sure about us as can be, but there are some things I feel we need to do as slowly as other people. At least kind of."
"You know, it's a good thing that you thought about getting back inside. But we keep it there for emergencies and getting cake isn't really one, is it?" John asked her with a raised eyebrow need to work on that."
"Yeah, I think that'd be taking things too far; she's only a young girl." John said and shook his head. "I mean, I just hadn't even thought about her teeth, but we won't make that mistake again. The way she's restrained right now, she's a danger to no one."
John chuckled a little into the kiss, struggling not to chuckle and keep a straight face when he eventually pulled back from his lover. "Yes, it's completely different." He responded, smiling at his soon to-be-fiancé. "Gotta get through the day somehow."
"Yeah they're feeling better, but I thought it would be good for them to spend some extra time in bed with tea and soup." Sherlock said and poured Paul a cup of tea.
"Well, she climbed over a fence into his backyard.." Sherlock said and laughed a little, "That's about all I know."
"Yeah, she really is." Sherlock said and smiled, "Anyway, I guess Mrs Hope is expecting us already.." he said and gave Molly one of his most charming smiles, "It was very nice to meet you."
"Shut it, you, I've already said I don't give you lot enough credit. And I didn't bring a stress ball, alright? Let's only hope everyone continues to like each other now that Beth's gone." He said with a sigh. "And in case they don't, you may want to know dad keeps a gun in his night stand." He added in good humour.
John cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably. "No, of course not. But in that moment... jealousy just got the better of me, I guess." He said sighed and looked up at his boyfriend. "I'm sorry, it's something I should probably work on. In my defence though, Harry wasn't exactly helping."
"Not too great for the environment though." John commented jokingly and got inside the car. "And it's not like I'm afraid of driving, but having three squealing toddlers in the back is just some pressure I don't need right now."
"Everything that means more time with you is alright with me." Sherlock said and smiled at John, for a moment just getting lost in the moment before a honk from behind the car sounded, probably to let him know it was green already. "You guys are like a bloody Disney movie.. no wonder not even dad could resist that." Harry mumbled and chuckled a little, slowly recovering a little.
"Mmh, I think in honour of Rosie I'll dare you to take a shot of actual ketchup." Clara said with a chuckle, figuring that was a harmless enough start.
"No condoms," he said. John sighed.
Sherlock kissed his way to John’s nipple, where he flicked his tongue against it, causing John to arch his back and give a choked moan, before he took Sherlock’s hands and gently pushed him back against the bed. He ground down on Sherlock’s erection with his own, catching Sherlock’s groan in his mouth and tasting it with his tongue. Then he did it again, and again, and again, unable to stop himself—the feeling and sounds so beautiful he didn’t know if he would ever be able to stop. Sherlock finally pulled back with a choked gasp.
“But why would you get milk when you could get chocolate milk? Chocolate milk, John. It’s genius. It’s revolutionary. It’s novel,” Sherlock said, looking at the chocolate milk with a kind of starry-eyed longing.
person.”
“Right. How old did you say you were again?” John asked. “Just asking!” he added when he saw Sherlock’s scathing glare.
in Sherlock’s mind.
“Really? Mike was complaining that you were in an awful mood this morning.” John thought back to the morning and remembered waking up with an aching shoulder and pounding head. He shrugged again.
“Who’s speaking?” John demanded.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Go do your job,” Sherlock said. John was tempted to stay just where he was just to show Sherlock that he didn’t have to do what he said, but decided that his job was worth more than a childish show of stubbornness.
despite having taken advanced chemistry last year, I'm really pretty clueless so if there's a mistake just roll with it, please.
“Need what, Sherlock?”
John huffed out a laugh.
The love they made was soft and warm and bathed in early morning sunlight, causing their skin to glow and their hair to shine. They both thrust into the circle of John’s fist around them (Sherlock’s arse being a bit too sore to take any more at that moment), their breaths puffing from their mouths together, mingling and fusing. Sherlock couldn’t help but imagine the cells of John’s body leaving and entering his own, mixing with the cells already there, their bodies combining and merging as one, they were almost close enough, almost. He was close enough to see the individual hairs of John’s impossibly long lashes, close enough count the number of different shades of blue in his eyes, close enough that he could no longer tell where he started and where John began. With every thrust he felt them get closer and closer together, and he never wanted to stop.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed, the word stretched over a moan. “Please, harder, Captain.” John smiled and gave in, setting a bruising pace. Sherlock gave a yell and arched up off the bed, precome pooling on his stomach where his cock lay.
“Yes, yes of course you were right…you were—that was bloody brilliant,” he sputtered. Sherlock looked at him, eyes slightly wide.
“No, don’t, I want to see you,” he said. He saw a flash of wariness on Sherlock’s face and mentally kicked himself once more for not doing this the first time they had shagged. Sherlock lay back down and John waited until he was making eye contact before he slid in. He watched as Sherlock’s mouth dropped open in a sigh and his eyelids drooped as he seated himself fully inside of the taller boy. He slowly pulled back, keeping their eyes locked together as they found the perfect rhythm. It was slow but steady and hard.
“Alright, so you know my story, let’s hear yours,” he said sitting down in the armchair across from Sherlock’s.
He sent, hoping Sherlock wouldn’t be too busy doing whatever it was that he did, to answer.
“Closest one to your flat and I ate all your biscuits,” he said, grabbing one of John’s hands and pulling. “Now come on, I need you to buy me alcohol.”
When their lips finally met, it was like worlds colliding, huge and explosive, but then they shifted and the sigh that John felt across his lips was a warm breeze through a sun-filled clearing, soft and so, so, sweet. He swiped his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth and felt sparks dance between their mouths, and swore that it was the best thing he had ever felt. It was as though it was they had never touched before—their first time was hot and wonderful, but it was rushed and hard, where this was soft and warm and perfect.
There was something almost enchanting about him, with his light unusual eyes, and wild curls.
“Okay, okay, why were you in America?” John asked. Sherlock shook his head, his curls shaking limply, with less than their usual life and chaos.
When Sherlock woke up, the bed was empty. He rolled over, and his fingers encountered a small piece of paper. He brought it closer to his eyes and recognized John’s hasty, messy handwriting:
Until next time, my lovelies!
“I’d like to meet Mrs. Hudson, she sounds like quite a woman,” John said, laughing, thinking that any woman who would trust a teenager enough to take him to Florida so that he could get her husband executed, was probably a person that John wanted to meet. Especially, if that teenager was Sherlock. Sherlock didn’t have very many friends in his life, and the fact that this woman would choose to be one after knowing him for such a short time said a lot about her ability to judge character, in John’s mind.
“Yes, Captain,” Sherlock replied, his voice hoarse with arousal. John sucked in a breath, his pupils blown wide.
“No, he’s actually studying chemistry,” John interrupted before Sherlock could insult the poor constable. Sherlock glared at him, and John returned it with a firm one of his own.
"Sherlock! What the bloody hell is wrong with you?" he said, pulling back. Sherlock looked slightly embarrassed, but didn't apologize.
"What is it, Sherlock?" he asked, smirking. Sherlock groaned at the loss of John's mouth and pushed at his head slightly, urging him back toward his cock. With a soft chuckle, John returned his mouth to its earlier position on Sherlock's cock.
“What? How did you”—
So I'm not super happy with this, and it's kinda short, but it's Sunday, so here you go! I may go back and edit this throughout the week if I have time. We'll see.
Until next time my lovelies!! (I'll try not to make that too long from now, but I'm gonna be in Ukraine until mid July so we'll see how it goes. To any of you who might live here, Здравствуйте! And hit me up, we can hang out!!)
John had to laugh at the obvious distaste in Sherlock’s voice. He sat back in his chair, grinning from ear to ear.
“Well, go home, I’ll close up tonight.”
Just when he was at his last string of self-control, the door was flung open and Captain Watson strode in.
“Sherlock? Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to you?” John exclaimed when Sherlock entered the shop.
“Sarah, really? But it’s only midnight, there’s still two hours until closing time,” John said. Sarah smiled again, resting a hand on John’s arm.
“You’ll forgive me for not believing you,” Mycroft said. “Particularly after last night. In fact, that’s twice now that Sherlock has spent the night at with you. Shall we expect a happy announcement soon?”
“Not helping, Sherlock,” John said, leaning back when he felt Sherlock’s hands travel up to his chest. Sherlock pulled away, smirking, leaving John feeling cold, even though the night was warm. He finally managed to lock the door and he turned away with relief, only to meet Sherlock’s eyes, dark with arousal. The breath left him in a gasp and took one step and pressed himself against the taller boy.
Yet Sherlock suspected it was more than simply the fact that it was sentiment that prevented him from deleting all the memories—he didn’t particularly want to. The thought of going back to the time before John was a dreadful, dreary one. Yes, being in love with John Watson was painful, but it was far preferable to the horrendous boredom that was his life before John had entered it.
John, his friend, was about to see him shirtless.
Finally, John couldn’t hold himself back anymore. He opened his mouth and took the head into it, flicking his tongue against the slit lightly, smirking around it when Sherlock cried out and tightened his fingers in John’s hair. He sucked harder, but still not hard enough for Sherlock to gain any real satisfaction from it, preferring to keep teasing him.
"We're both clean and I need to feel you, John. Please." John shuddered at the words in arousal. He was so hard he was worried that he wouldn't last longer than a few seconds inside Sherlock. He poured some more lube onto himself, hissing slightly when the cold liquid hit his heated skin.
“Jesus if I had known you could suck cock like that I wouldn’t have waited so long,” John said, voice hoarse, tucking himself back into his pants. Sherlock palmed himself through his trousers, hoping John would take the hint. John grinned, his eye glinting.
But that was problem with sentiment—it didn’t delete properly. No matter what he did, Sherlock kept getting interrupted by thoughts of John. Images from the night he had spent at his house, how John looked in the morning with his hair a mess and nothing but a pair of pants on. Images of John talking with him in the coffee shop and being impressed by Sherlock’s deductions rather than disgusted by them. Images of the wicked grin on his face when he thought of annoying Mycroft.
fingers, a light bruise forming on his neck from
Sherlock practically kicked the door of his room open and turned to John, but the ex-military man had him pinned on his bed in seconds. Sherlock looked up at John with wide-blown pupils, hips thrusting up into John's. John lowered his head to Sherlock's neck and placed several open-mouthed kissed there. Sherlock turned his head to allow him easier access, but John sat up, straddling the detective's thin hips. Sherlock whined, but John quickly shushed him by almost ripping Sherlock's silk shirt off and beginning to suck on his thin, muscular chest.
“Ugh, talking. Talking’s boring, why would you ever want to do that?”
“So I was right, wasn’t I? About everything?”
“I don’t care, I’m not coming. Maybe later.”
John read the text for about the tenth time, wondering what it could possibly mean. He knew he was being ridiculous, but he felt horribly disappointed to look up and find the genius gone. He had been looking forward to the late night conversation with Sherlock.
"You arrogant arse," John said, grinning. He pulled Sherlock back to him, pressing himself against the taller man. Sherlock smirked and lowered his lips back to John's. Despite the nickname given to him by Irene Adler, when Sherlock ran his tongue across John's lower lip and nipped at it lightly with his teeth, John felt breathless and could tell that this was not the first time Sherlock was doing this. John took Sherlock's lower lip and sucked on it, earning himself a delicious, breathy moan. John felt heat pooling in the pit of his stomach just as he felt Sherlock's erection pressing into his stomach. He reached and palmed Sherlock. Sherlock moaned again, rutting against John's skilled hand.
“You’re training to be a doctor, there’s no way you would miss the signs of drug use and your caretaking nature make it impossible for you not to be worried.” John shook his head, amazed.
“Don’t you dare come, you’re coming with your cock inside me, John Watson,” Sherlock said, repeating John’s own words back to him. John couldn’t help a huffed chuckle.
“Don’t bother,” he said, turning away and making his way back to the car.
“Sherlock, Jesus, of course I won’t be seeing anyone else, don’t be ridiculous. The thought of having anyone after having you is…boring, to be honest.” Sherlock’s lips twitched upwards in response. “But, if we are…romantically involved, as you put it, I have to say that I would not be okay with you seeing anyone else. In fact, I can be…quite possessive. I hope you are okay with that.”
Sherlock, who had climbed on top of him and was straddling him in his chair, and was slowly grinding down onto him. Holy fuck, Sherlock was much better at all of this than he had any right to be. John let out a breathy moan into Sherlock’s mouth and reached down to Sherlock’s arse, squeezing lightly.
Sebastian paled.
“Fuck, sorry,” he muttered, pulling back, but Sherlock hummed around his cock and held him there, wanting more. “Oh, fuck,” John cursed again, gripping his hair and thrusting in again, slowly. Sherlock moaned around his cock, and John groaned in response when he could feel the vibrations down his shaft.
He stopped for a moment when he pulled out John’s erection. He couldn’t help moaning a bit when he took it in his hand—feeling the heavy size of it in his palm. Christ, he wanted it inside him. He had always known John was large—it was an easy enough deduction—but it was entirely different to be face to face with it.
You may have noticed that I now have a (rough) estimate as too how long this will continue. That is because, friends, I have finally bullied myself into making a (rough) outline, and (sort of) know what I'm doing and what will be happening with our favorite boys.
“Of course, what did you think?”
“You recently lost that rugby scholarship didn’t you? I imagine working at that coffee shop must be hellish.”
Luckily, I decided to write gay fanfiction instead.
it, do you? And just what are you going to do to stop me?” John asked with a smirk. Sherlock merely gave his own smirk in reply.
If John wasn’t home soon he would have to just wank and accept the consequences. He pulled his trousers down and away from his heated, oversensitive skin, enjoying the brief calm as the cool air of their sitting room hit his cock.
John, he knew, came at the same moment he did, and he knew because he could
“Sherlock Holmes, are you asked me to be your boyfriend?” he asked, his smile growing into a grin when Sherlock began to blush.
"Then hurry up and fuck me already," Sherlock tried to snap, but the effect was lost when Sherlock's voice strained and he let out an involuntary whimper. John smirked before suddenly snapping his hips forward, sliding himself all the way into Sherlock, until his thighs met Sherlock's arse.
“Yes, okay, I slept with Sherlock Holmes last night,” he said, rolling his eyes again. Mike grinned.
“Piss off.” John chuckled lightly, and a moment later, Sherlock joined in. John listened him, loving the sound.
“They’ve just arrested the wrong man,” Sherlock said, pointing to the television where the police were shoving a handcuffed man into police car. John looked at it, baffled.
“God, I hate closing,” John said against Sherlock’s lips, feeling them lift into a smile.
“Fuck, yes, Sherlock, you were fucking made for this, to be on your knees, mouth full of cock,
John jumped when Sarah called his name.
“I think you just have,” he replied. John giggled and bit down on the skin in retaliation, pulling a choked gasp from Sherlock. He sat up to pull off Sherlock’s shirt and ran his hands across Sherlock’s pale chest, wondering how his imagination could have failed him so spectacularly. None of his wet dreams could possibly compare to the beauty of Sherlock there, in the flesh.
“Yeah, everything’s fine,” he replied, trying to understand why Sarah’s smile didn’t send flocks of butterflies erupting through his stomach and a gentle tingling in his hands—that was, after all, his body’s response to a smile from Sherlock. And John knew he was fooling himself—he didn’t want to go on another date with Sarah. She was nice, and friendly and simple and uncomplicated, but utterly and completely
“Let’s see who the freak was texting!” he crowed, opening John’s text. “John? Who’s
“Er yeah…hello,” Mike said, clearly confused, but with a proud smile slowly creeping its way across his lips. “Lestrade, why don’t we give the boys some space for a few minutes? I’ll uh, show you around.” He led the tall man, but didn’t leave until he winked at John and Sherlock.
“Sherlock what about”—
“Hey,” he said, dropping down into his customary armchair across from Sherlock’s dark grey leather one. Sherlock looked up from his phone.
Surreptitiously, John pulled out his phone under the table.
John finished washing the last mug with a sigh, checking his watch. He still had an hour left of his shift, but there was nobody left in the shop, so he sat down behind the counter, and rubbed a hand over his face. He got out his textbook and notes, knowing that he should be studying, since he didn’t have anything else to do.
He made sure his fingers lingered over John’s for a long moment when he took the coffee cup from John’s grasp, and when he walked away, he could feel John’s eyes follow his arse, so he swayed hips a touch more than strictly necessary. Though he imagined that John thought him horribly naïve and inexperienced, the truth was that Sherlock had tried sex. Quite a lot. Not with anyone from school—they all hated him, of course—but as soon as he was old enough to pass for eighteen, he had been sneaking into bars.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry, but I can’t say for sure right now, it depends on how the labs are doing right now,” the man said, far too smug to be anything close to sorry.
He sighed bitterly. He was supposed to be over this by now. He was tired of thinking about John, he was tired of thinking about how he was tired of thinking about John. He had hoped that perhaps the further away from him that he got, the easier it would be, yet here he was, on an airplane to America and still thinking about him. He buried himself angrily in his book and tried to get reabsorbed in the up-close pictures and the complexities of the lives of bees, but it wasn’t the same.
“John, you haven’t left this shop before two in the morning in weeks. It’s fine, I’ll do it,” she said, giving his arm a small squeeze. John abruptly remembered that he had been planning on asking her out again, but everything with Sherlock had pushed it from his mind.
"Four."
“Is everything okay?” she asked, feigning concern.
John sucked in a breath when he saw Sherlock spread out on the sofa, legs wide and cock indecently exposed.
“I believe it’s crispy enough, now,” he said, looking for all the world as though everything had gone exactly as he had planned it. John couldn’t help but giggle as he took the bacon off the stove and put it on a plate.
Of course John would be ashamed of him. Of course he wouldn’t want people to know that he was friends with a loser.
Hadn’t Sarah said he was in high school? Why wasn’t he using his own library for God’s sake?
“Are you ready for me, Soldier?” John asked, his voice rough with arousal.
"John, please," Sherlock whimpered.
“I can’t do this,” he replied, buttoning up his shirt and extricating himself from her grasp. “It was nothing you did, I just…” he trailed off, unsure of what to say. He and Sherlock had never been in a relationship, so he couldn’t even say that he had just gotten out of a relationship.
"Two." Sherlock's fingers scrabbled against the wall fruitlessly.
Hello my lovelies! I'm finally back home! From here on out, updates should (hopefully) be regular again.
After the last customer left, John made his way over to the armchairs and sat down heavily in his.
“Get in the car, Mr. Watson,” she said, her voice slightly firmer.
“’Morning, Mike,” John said, warily. Mike raised his eyebrows and smiled knowingly.
In truth, Sherlock was only now, leaving the bedroom, but he figured that seeing each other wasn’t the best idea.
“Oh, that’s good, I’m glad that you know how this looks, I’m glad I’m not the only one thinking how much it bloody looks like you had a bag of cocaine in your pocket!” John’s voice was hard, yet quiet, and his breaths were coming in short little bursts. He still wasn’t looking at Sherlock.
“No.”
“Well, go on then, tell me about it, since you’re so clearly dying to,” he said, giving Sherlock’s hand a squeeze, feeling happier than he had in a long time.
“Necessary? How is it necessary? Aside from the age issue, which we’ve already discussed what more could you possibly want to talk about?” Sherlock scoffed. John floundered a moment before grasping onto a topic with relief.
“Yes, yes, yes, John do it please!” cried Sherlock, gripping the sheets with slender fingers. John pulled his fingers from Sherlock and watched his hole gape open. He was so aroused he could barely breathe. He roughly spread some lube on his cock before suddenly stiffening.
"Yeah just started a few days ago," John replied with a nod and a smile. He had wanted to continue the conversation but all of the sudden found his hands empty and small pile of coins shoved unceremoniously in his direction. He watched as Sherlock - though he didn't know his name was Sherlock yet - curled up in one of the cushy armchairs in the back, and stared off into space, leaving his coffee untouched.
Taking a steadying breath, he left, hoping he wouldn’t be back until the next morning. He decided to walk to the coffee shop, both because he was low on cash and the sun was shining brightly—an odd enough occurrence in London.
“I told you, John I was bored. Everything was too loud and too much, I needed something to make everything go quiet, I needed some relief. Cocaine makes everything speed up until it’s running at the same pace as I am, and I needed that,” he said, waving his hands as he tried to explain. He knew doctorly, perfect John would never understand his need for it, but he tried to explain it anyway.
“I’ll mark the day,” he said.
“What are your intentions with Sherlock Holmes?” Mycroft asked after their silent battle for dominance.
“Yes, I would be ‘amendable,’ you berk,” John replied, unable to stifle a giggle, before suddenly growing quite serious. “But, I do feel like a have to say that if I find out you’re using drugs again, it’s over.”
“Get both, it’s his money after all, isn’t it?” he said. Sherlock looked at him with something like awe.
until they could come no more, and collapsed against each other, trying to find the way back to their own bodies, but reluctant to leave the other.
That was ridiculous. John was a doctor, a caregiver. It was in his nature to care about everyone. That didn’t make Sherlock special.
Yet John was ridiculously loyal to a fault. He would never have even looked at another girl without thinking about his girlfriend.
His results were mildly disappointing. It felt nice, sure, but all the skin and the sweat and the grunting rather put Sherlock off. He did, however, discover that he was gay, a fact which had never really bothered him. Of all his sexual
“I’m fine,
“STDs,” he blurted out.
"Yes, Sherlock?"
“Your
“Sorry, I forgot about that,” John said, unable to keep the smirk off his face. Sherlock looked up at him from under his thick lashes and bit down on the skin right under his collarbone. He licked at it immediately after, however, so John knew he was forgiven.
and it was really quite elementary, I would expect a bit more from someone with ambitions to become a detective,” Sherlock replied, glancing at John’s toast. John handed it to him without a word, already picking up a second piece and applying a smaller, more normal amount of jelly onto it. It was Sherlock with the sweet tooth, after all.
“You like it when I call cockslut? A dirty little cockslut?”
. Go, you’ll be late to your…whatever it is you’re going to,” Sherlock said through gritted teeth. He still hadn’t opened his eyes. He cursed himself for not listening to John when he talked. Maybe then he would have had some kind of forewarning.
“Me and Sherlock are friends,” John insisted. He supposed he should have expected this. He wasn’t even sure why he was surprised that he was getting the stereotypical older brother talk.
Some trigger warnings: a mildly graphic description of a fight. And when I say mild, I mean really, super mild. Also, like a one-line reference to child abuse.
“Is that what you think? What you want?” John forced the words past his teeth, formed them with unwilling lips. The last thing he wanted to do was to give into Sherlock’s lunacy, but he didn’t know what else to do. Looking at the pack of cocaine, all he could think of was Harry, always saying she was getting sober and always inevitably falling off the wagon again. Loving her was hard, but he was her brother, that’s what he did.
Now, though he wanted nothing more than to just go back and forget about it. He wanted to have never seen John Watson, to have never felt that form of emotion towards anyone.
“Leave me alone, John, I’m fine!” Sherlock explained, moving to shove Jon away from him, but he miscalculated (his eyes were still closed, after all) and suddenly found himself in exactly the position he didn’t want to be—with his dressing gown wide open, making the tent in his pants painfully clear.
"Stop," he gasped, "please John, I'll come if you don't stop." John smirked again as he pulled away from Sherlock, adjusting his own cock from within the confines of his trousers.
). The taller boy had curled up against his side, resting his head against John’s chest. Their legs were tangled together along with the linens.
It would get Mycroft off his back for a couple weeks about going, and might even help his boredom. Downing the last dregs of his coffee, Sherlock made his decision.
Sarah left as soon as the evening crowd was gone, leaving John alone with just a few customers and Sherlock. By midnight everyone else had cleared out. John wasn’t quite sure why they stayed open so late—how many people wanted a coffee at one in the morning?—yet he was glad they did. He liked closing, the place was still and quiet and it wasn’t like he’d be sleeping anyway. It was usually calming.
"Please what, Sherlock?"
“Take yours off too,” he murmured into John’s hot mouth, pushing the coffee-stained shirt up John’s chest. They broke away from each other for a moment to allow it to slip off, before coming back together, Sherlock’s large hands exploring the previously unavailable skin. John gasped into Sherlock’s mouth before sliding down his body to return to his earlier position between his legs. He pulled Sherlock’s pants off hastily and found himself face to face with Sherlock’s cock. He could honestly say he didn’t want to be anywhere else. It was shaped like the rest of him—long and somewhat thin—and John was practically salivating for it.
“Sherlock I really don’t think this is a good idea,” John said, his voice barely above a whisper.
“Do you want to go sit down? Some coffee?” John asked. Sherlock nodded and turned away. Unsure what it was that he was nodding too, John simply followed, figuring that Sherlock wanted coffee he would tell him. They settled into their seats, and John’s heart ached from how familiar it all was.
“Boyfriend then? Which is fine, by the way,” John pressed, heart almost in his throat. Sherlock looked sharply at him.
“Answer it,” he said immediately. She looked up at him, her eyes wide.
“Me neither,” he admitted.
He took Sherlock’s hand, the long fingers cold, despite the warm night and called a cab, knowing he wouldn’t be able to make the walk home if Sherlock kept looking at him like that.
“Which means ‘no,’” Sherlock muttered under his breath so that only Mrs. Hudson could hear him. She cast him a sympathetic look, but had no more control over the situation than he did. “Will you know by tomorrow?”
“Can I?” he asked softly, tugging gently at the waistband of the pants to make it clear what he was asking.
"Six."
He leaned down to John’s neck, the older boy lifting his chin helpfully unable to stifle a small smile at Sherlock’s almost child-like wonder. The smile turned into a gasp, however, when Sherlock unerringly found that spot below his ear that never failed to turn him on, and sunk his teeth delicately into it.
They stayed in Florida for the rest of the case, just to make sure that Mr. Hudson got the death sentence. When they found out that he did, they celebrated by going out to nice dinner.
, John, please I want it inside me, I want to come with it inside me,
It took nearly everything in him to keep his eyes closed.
All of the sudden, Sherlock gave a loud moan, digging his fingers into the bedding under him. John felt him twitch and clench around his cock. He grinned, knowing he had found Sherlock's prostate. He continued thrusting, aiming for that spot as Sherlock writhed and whimpered under him, beyond words. John sped up his thrusts until he was pounding into him, the bed frame hitting the wall with every thrust. Both were beyond caring about the neighbors. Sherlock had closed his eyes, his face one of completely blissed out delight. He could do more than chant John's name over and over in a breathy voice, his cock leaking steadily on the sheets below him.
