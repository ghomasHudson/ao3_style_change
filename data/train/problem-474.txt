Sherlock grinned. Now that John no longer feared Mycroft, he was free to be as blunt and confrontational as he wanted. The sight of him facing off against Mycroft, stance firm, steely gaze daring Mycroft to protest the insult, filled Sherlock with glee and an appreciation that sang in his bones.
A note? Sherlock sucked in a breath, instantly on high alert. He steepled his hands, fingers clapping in glee.
“Sure, I’ll try my best, but I can’t make any promises. He is really stubborn. You know, you didn’t have to kidnap me to tell me all this. You could have just come into my office.”
Sherlock filled the rest of the meal with selkie-free anecdotes that didn’t infringe on John’s privacy, which pleased Mrs. Hudson immensely. Her enthusiasm for John’s imminent arrival quenched and his meal finished, Sherlock headed upstairs to his own flat. Mrs. Hudson stayed downstairs to give him and Mycroft a chance to talk alone, which Mycroft very clearly wanted by showing up here at all. He grabbed his luggage before Sherlock got a chance to and carried it up while Sherlock trudged up behind him. He was able to put his weight on his right ankle to climb up the stairs now, but only at a slow pace, so he had to endure Mycroft staring at him from the top of the stairs while he did so.
“Alright,” he said. “I agree to your terms. I will leave him be and give him the documents he requires.”
Only when John turned to him did Sherlock dare meet his eyes. It wasn’t an empty gesture. Genuine gratitude softened John’s upset features.
“Fine, then. Although the circumstances dictate that I am, in fact, special, and there’s nothing either of you can do about it.” Sherlock lied on his back and picked at his nails. “Even though you’ll probably do this with Mycroft in a moment, I will still have been first.”
Sherlock lost count of how many times he sent Mycroft that message, only to receive an unsatisfying,
He escaped to Barts to continue his experiments, unable to concentrate in his own kitchen. Greg saved him for a couple of days with a robbery and homicide on Wednesday. Only a six, but it scratched the itch. The man himself also provided a much more fascinating study than he ever had before, although there was no new information to be gained. His divorce was proceeding with all the sluggishness that these legal matters took, and he was in no less of a depressed slump over it. He hadn’t spoken to Mycroft, but Sherlock lacked the experience to tell if that was bad or simply part of the process. Mrs. Hudson told him that it was the latter.
“What are you leading towards, Mycroft?” Sherlock asked, forcing his mind to shift gears back into the present moment. Mycroft continued to scrutinize him with surprise and close interest. Too close. Sherlock chaffed at the feel of it.
“By all means,” he said. “Be my guest. At least I don’t have to worry about you pulling out an album of my baby pictures, Mrs. Hudson. I need some tea.”
There he was, appearing at the threshold like an overgrown bat with lofty ideas of itself. Mycroft bore his usual smarmy expression, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes, and he had his umbrella in hand despite having been here a while. He wasn’t about to leave, which meant that he clung to it in its capacity as a comfort item, his grip just a tad tighter than normal. The signs were so subtle that anyone else would have missed them, but not Sherlock. Mycroft was nervous. Uncertain. Sherlock hadn’t seen him like this in years. Had their phone conversation really shaken him up this badly?
“Every time I call, which is why I almost never do. That and the constant questions on whether I’ve found someone yet. I’m sure that they’d be ecstatic to hear that I’ve chosen someone who lacks the proper equipment to give them a grandchild. Or be acceptable in their antiquated view of respectability.”
John rushed to the sofa. He sat with quiet expectation, hands rubbing softly on his lap as he leaned a little forward, the most attentive and intrigued audience that Sherlock could wish for. Raising his bow, Sherlock closed his eyes and began. He had made sure to memorize the tune to perfection, both to not have to bother looking at his sheets and for the visual aesthetics of the performance. If he weren’t injured, he’d be standing and making full use of his limbs to dance with the music as it rose and ebbed like the waves that had inspired it. As it was, he could only manage a gentle sway without tripping up his notes. He hoped that it conveyed the proper effect, nevertheless. He had never felt this insecure about a composition before, this uncertain that he had the right to even attempt to capture the experience of John’s world when he could only be allowed to glimpse a tiny piece of it in cinematic footage and the tales that John wove at his request. He wouldn’t dare to speak to John’s experience, only try to share his own curiosity and delight at the honor that John had bestowed on him. The glances he snuck at John gave him hope that his message was being received, for John looked as enchanted as that first day when Sherlock had played for him, awed and taken in by the artistry that Sherlock so seldom had the chance or wished to share with another. John’s happy smile sparked warm elation in Sherlock’s skin even more vibrant than the allure of the sounds washing through his body. If only he’d made the song longer so that he could delight in this for more than this brief moment.
“Don’t feel any rush to come back in a hurry. Take all the time you need to get acquainted with John. Oh, this is so exciting. I had hoped that he’d become a good friend when you said that you were staying with him, but I never thought this might happen.”
“The rest of the tour can wait,” Sherlock said, unbuttoning his shirt. “The only room in this flat that should concern you for the moment, doctor, is my bedroom.”
Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson both shot Mycroft equally sharp looks of disgust. Mrs. Hudson shook her head in that disappointed way that always made Sherlock feel like he was eight years old and had just broken a vase. Mycroft’s face pinched, but he didn’t have the decency to look the slightest bit contrite.
“To be honest,” he said, voice a bit stronger and less apologetic now. “Some of your claims are a bit far-fetched. How could you possibly identify an airline pilot by his thumb?”
“Oh, it’s not as bad as all that,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Greg is actually very proud of your job, even when he complains about not knowing half of what you’re up to.”
He gripped the railing, breath shaky. Sherlock slipped an arm around his back, holding him close, right hand on John’s. His birthdays must have been lonely ever since, a cruel difference to his former experience.
“Did it sound right to you? I mean, for the theme. I tried to give the strongest impression I could of what I feel when I listen to your stories and how I view the ocean now through your eyes, but I have no idea if I managed it.”
“I’m afraid that John has to head off to work now,” he said. “So this lovely discussion will have to be cut short.”
“You can choose to trust me, but you won’t, so fine. You win. But I won’t tell you anything until he allows me to.”
“He had no record past twelve years ago and appeared in the nick of time to tend to my brother. He was a suspicious character. Possibly dangerous. I had to make sure that he wasn’t.”
John’s tail flickered. He moved his head from side to side, blinking his eyes open before focusing on Sherlock.
Sherlock’s face didn’t show anything but cocky rivalry, but it was so obvious what he was doing. Gratitude swelled in Mycroft’s chest as he set his umbrella by the wall to open the checkers box.
“You know, when I told you, I had no idea who you were. If you were trustworthy. It was bloody stupid of me, really. You could have sold me out to your super powerful brother and I wouldn’t have been able to do anything about it. But Mycroft deciding not to press the issue even after we’d agreed to… You’re the better judge, but I feel much better about telling now that I’m not being coerced to. I certainly have established more trust with him than I did with you before.”
Yet as John continued to wrap the bandage around his foot, Sherlock’s preoccupation with biological differences faded, his focus narrowing exclusively on how those hands felt and not what their temperature might signify. John, as always, was treating him with careful care, making sure that the pressure on his flesh was firm, but not too tight or painful. His hold shifted from his sole to his heel and to his lower leg as necessary, his touch gentle. Always so gentle. Sherlock wasn’t much accustomed to being touched other than by Mrs. Hudson and the occasional pat on the shoulder from Lestrade. Yet he enjoyed it immensely despite not having much chance to receive it. Flustered awe from being touched by a non-human gripped him now. The sensation of John’s thigh pressing against his heel and his hands gently tending to him made his breath grow short and his eyes narrow at John’s downturned head. He struggled to keep his toes still and not wiggle them in restless confusion at how much he yearned to lean into John’s touch and gaze at his face until he’d gotten his fill of every freckle, every laugh line, every sand-colored eyelash. Handsome in a puppy dog way, Sherlock had called him. An accurate assessment, but his regard was no longer so flatly objective.
“He’s not doing anything of the sort. He just needs some time to clear his head of this Susan.” Mrs. Hudson hissed out the word like it was made of acid. “Greg knows what he wants.”
He sounded like he really did hope. Mycroft didn’t make a habit of looking uncertain in front of people. So Sherlock wouldn’t need to stuff him with wine to get him to take his guard down. Good. That would have been irritating.
“I didn’t want to move. I figured my stomach could wait, but it’s a little much now. I can just grab a sandwich from the café downstairs if you’re not hungry.”
The quality of conversation didn’t get any better through the rest of the night, but at least Mrs. Hudson was enjoying herself. Apparently, Sherlock and Mycroft were very entertaining when they weren’t actually trying to hurt each other’s feelings. Mycroft cut out the weird smiling after a while and gave as much as he got, which was fun. Despite his petty comments, Sherlock did enjoy himself, which was odd. Enjoying Mycroft’s company was a thing of the past, like playing hide and seek and learning to read. Not that there hadn’t been times after that. And it wasn’t terrible. He may have missed this a little. He wouldn’t be making all this effort if he hadn’t. Still, it was a relief when Mycroft left and Sherlock was able to retreat upstairs to the comfort of his violin. God, he was drained.
“You travel as often as you can. That’s why you chose the human life. You love the land life, so you suck up as much of it as you can. The sights, the food, the music. Art in general. You have books on everything. Photography. The cinema. History. Fiction. Humans fascinate you, but not only our endeavors. You practice medicine. Anatomy. Disease. How the human body works and how it breaks down. Selkies take human form, so this might be typical behavior for your kind, yet I sense that this isn’t so. Not to this extent, anyway. If this lifestyle were common to your kind, you wouldn’t need to reveal yourself to a stranger just to have company.”
How was Sherlock supposed to deprive himself of such charming beauty having just discovered it? He grinned into his pillow, fluttery hands tucked under his chin. Despite reassuring John, he had been a little nervous that having him here for the full night might be too onerous, but his presence had been a huge comfort. No longer was he a lonely body in his bedroom, staring at the ceiling, the sensation that the room felt much too empty sticking in his throat. He would be fine if John decided not to repeat the exercise, but not without some disappointment.
“Uh, well. That’s all, really. I mean, I was surprised. I’ve never known you to be in a relationship before and you roll your eyes at romantic stuff. I was thinking you might be…” Greg shifted in his seat, looking even more uncomfortable. “I don’t want to assume.”
She spoke slowly, as if to a child. He probably looked like a child with his legs folded up like this. That was what everyone thought of him. That he was childish with his meltdowns and his whims. That he needed to grow up. Only a few knew that his brain didn’t work that way, but telling the world wouldn’t help anything. It would only make it worse, his actions even more suspect.
“I chose to live primarily on the land, remember? I can’t say that I won’t miss it, but I miss you more. And I didn’t live near the ocean for a long time when I was at uni. But I am going to need my weekends away.”
Mycroft accompanied Sherlock to the building after he had decided to take the first floor flat and required Mycroft’s assistance in relocating. Rather, he wanted Mycroft to pay for a moving crew and would have been fine if Mycroft absented himself, yet he knew that Mycroft would be taking a look for himself, both at the flat and Mrs. Hudson. No kidnapping this time. He wouldn’t do that to an older lady whom Sherlock genuinely cared for. There really was no need for Sherlock to threaten him in case he so much as considered it. Sherlock must have warned Mrs. Hudson about him, for there was a knowing look in her eye when Sherlock introduced him.
“Can you please fast-forward past that?” he asked, voice small and aggrieved. Sherlock acquiesced, skipping ahead to a nonviolent segment on otters while John kept his gaze firmly on the floor, hands curled into fists on his lap, his left trembling until the danger was past. Concern pooled in Sherlock’s belly, but he didn’t comment on it. This was the one segment that he had not inquired about. The answer was obvious enough. Why wouldn’t selkies have natural predators? John had clearly had a run in with a shark. Or someone he knew. Or both. Yes, both evidence of a personal trauma and grief appeared in the desolate wrinkling of his brow and the tormented gasping of his breath.
“Nothing.” Sherlock shook his head and lowered his hand, smiling with half-hearted desperation. “Just, a little warning next time would be nice. But I like it. I get what you were trying to tell me. I’m the one who’s honored. Thank you.”
“Well, I don’t know how to brush them quietly. Just don’t listen to me brushing. And what do you mean, questionable taste?” He glanced at the telly, which was playing some dull, mind-numbing comedy. “What’s wrong with this?”
“Sure, but how often does that stop you? And you’re just solving cases, not seeking people you care about. Claimed to care about. But I’m the one who abandoned them, so it’s fine for them, isn’t it? Why should they want to have anything to do with me?”
Mycroft startled, snapping out of his observational haze, a coping mechanism he used to calm down. Greg sat beside him. The weight of his body mere inches away made Mycroft gasp. What was happening to him? He shut his eyes, sucking in a breath. It did nothing to fortify him.
“None taken. Not my system. My culture is a lot more reasonable about these things. Yours is the one that’s delusional. No offence.”
Questions erupted to the forefront of Sherlock’s mind, bottlenecking and spilling out in rapid bursts, unable to modulate his thought process into a coherent stream. John, the selkie, the impossible creature that should not exist, looked at him with pity and guilt in his eyes, all too human, everything about him so perfectly human that Sherlock barely bit down on a scream of despair before it filled the room.
“Are you a selkie, too?” Sherlock asked Greg, peering closely at his face, not that there were any signs to see, anyway, except for the way that Greg’s eyes widened in shock and alarm. He and John must have recognized each other by scent. John’s sense of smell wasn’t as acute in his human form as in his seal one, but it was still remarkably impressive.
There was logic to what Greg was saying. Practicality dictated that one should not be too old when having children to have the stamina and time to raise them properly. Greg was 41 by now, which didn’t give him much time for maximum potential.
“We’re friendly,” John had said. “I trust him, obviously, at least with my safety. But I don’t know what I’d call him.”
“Oh, you most definitely kidnapped me. It’s just that reprimanding you would kind of go against the purpose of this call, so I’m being nice. But seriously, cut that out. It’s not okay.”
“I know how to answer the phone. I just don’t see the point. We both know that’s what you were going to ask about, so we might as well get it out of the way now.”
The floorboards above them creaked as Sherlock and John walked across the sitting room, stopping a couple of paces away. Mycroft’s eyes narrowed.
“Me, too,” he said. He pet Mycroft’s arm, squeezing for a longed-for second. “Come on. I bet you haven’t eaten since you got home, have you?”
Sherlock put the folklore book in the bag and started picking it up when took John it from his hands.
“Give him a little credit. He didn’t become a detective inspector by sleeping his way to the top, you know.”
Sherlock’s smile widened. Giddiness surged through him at the easy acceptance with which Greg said the word.
All four of them went. John even invited Mycroft, who excused himself with a work thing that may have been completely fabricated. The trivia was as boring as expected, although at least they had the courtesy of including a chemistry question, even if it was silly. How many elements began with the letter H? Really? That was the best that they could come up with? But it put a smile on John’s face, which stayed for the whole night, so the annoyance was well worth it.
“Yeah,” Lestrade said. “Mrs. Hudson said that you became friends with the doctor who helped you after the attack.”
“That’s hardly dinner table conversation,” Mycroft said, looking down at his plate while a blush threatened to redden his cheeks.
Sherlock dropped his head back, which annoyed him further, as the backrest was so low that it only reached up to his shoulders.
John’s expression hardened, his jaw clenching, annoyance flaring into anger. Interesting. Did the man truly believe himself to be a selkie, or did he have something to gain by fooling Sherlock so? For a second, it looked like John might yell at him, but he deflated with a weary sigh and shook his head at himself.
“Never mind,” Sherlock said, growling, good mood completely evaporated. “Don’t tell me. I’ll figure it out. Anyway, the doctor’s name is John. I know his name. I call him by that name. And he’s coming over. I’m afraid that I’m going to have to leave you now. So sorry. There’s no need to keep asking me when I’m coming home. I’ll let you know.”
Mycroft warmed, both at the sound of Greg’s voice and the question, which wasn’t a mere formality. Greg knew perfectly well how trying this day could be after his botched coming out declaration. Greg always called him on Mothering Sunday to check up on him. At first, Mycroft had protested that there was no need, but Greg insisted. Who was Mycroft to deny him?
“My culture respects individualism, but you still have obligations to your community. To your family. You’re expected to be an active member of society. How could I while spending most of my time on land? The best I would be able to manage was to visit, and not often. Not even that while I was studying. I had no time at all, and I knew I wouldn’t. I lied and said that I would, but they did the research for themselves. I shouldn’t have lied. It just made things worse. Now not only was I leaving, but I was accused of deceiving them, which was true. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t being malicious about it. By this point, the matter had escalated to a hearing with the ruling council. You need to be granted permission to absent yourself for as long as I wanted. You can’t just declare that you’re leaving and go. They told me that I had to decide. I could live on land for up to three years if I wanted and remain part of the clan. That was a generous extension on their part. Originally, they had said only two years. But if I stayed for longer, I couldn’t be in the clan anymore. How could I be a part of it if I wasn’t present?”
“Anyone might change their minds about anything in the future. I wouldn’t worry about it if I were you. But have you thought this through? You’ve only known him for two weeks.”
Sherlock flinched inwardly at the peeved tone in Greg’s voice. Not quite angry. It took a lot for Greg to get angry at him. Yet he was uncomfortably close to it. Why? Sherlock hadn’t done or said anything to annoy him, had he?
“I have promised to do so, and I will. Sherlock is free to do as he wishes, with whoever he wishes, without my knowledge.”
He resumed his reading, skipping ahead to the parts covering seals and the animals that they ate and encountered. His breath shuddered as he saw a picture of a killer whale, which ate seals. He frowned at the horizon, scrutinizing the water, imagining a killer whale or a great white shark breaking through the surface with a selkie caught in its jaws.
“That he will. Sherlock is incapable of restraining himself. Hopefully, John will give him some perspective.”
Sherlock swallowed it all eagerly, only now realizing how immensely dry his mouth was, or how much his ankle was throbbing. John took the empty glass from him and placed it on a side table.
Greg ignored him until late that Saturday afternoon, finally showing up in a police cruiser while Sherlock paced around the sitting room, hands steepled to his face.
Of course not. He knew that. He wasn’t completely incapable of understanding other people’s feelings. But couldn’t they hurry it up and get back together already? He hated this worrying that his mind kept doing without his consent. He was usually so good about shoving all these emotions away when they were being irrelevant so that he could focus on his work, but now they kept niggling at him like mosquitoes puncturing his skin no matter how much bug repellent he sprayed on himself. How did other people manage this feeling thing all the time? It was smothering him. Then there was Mrs. Hudson. She had mentioned some story about seeing a ghost as a child, so the supernatural wasn’t completely beyond her consideration. But selkies and werewolves were another matter. He had been frightened for days, unable to sleep, but she wasn’t logic-based like him, so maybe she would handle it better. She was tougher than she looked. Maybe John was right and he making too much of a fuss.
“I suppose,” Mycroft continued, flashing a rueful smile. “That if you did save Sherlock’s life, the least I could do is trust you. For now.” He glanced down, frowning. “Although I can’t figure out how you managed that. You’ve never met before and the evidence from the beach was very definitive. If it’s the case that the seal turned to attack Sherlock and you saved him from it, there would be proof of it.”
The word was a sad murmur, but Sherlock would not be guilted. He needed to get away from this man and forget everything that had happened as soon as possible, if he even could. But he must try. For the sake of sanity, he must.
Greg looked away for a second, betraying his response. Mycroft raised his hand to his own face, turning away for a second in shame.
“Well, a hello is nice. The one you gave me when I got here today was very nice. I’m not going to complain about a missing hello here and there.”
Sherlock smiled, worry replaced by warmth as he admired the soft affection on John’s face. God, he could spend hours in a quiet study of John’s every feature.
Sherlock pressed his lips together in a poor approximation of a smile, which was meant to relieve the tension, but probably did the opposite. He gripped John’s hand.
That had been one time. Sherlock had infiltrated an art gallery to catch a thief and was so used to popping the collar of his Belstaff that he had done the same to his uniform jacket without even thinking about it. It wasn’t like he’d looked out of place and made people remotely suspicious. Greg was making too much out of the situation.
“Please stop,” Sherlock said, placing his hands on John’s shoulders and neck. “I don’t need that. I understand you didn’t mean to. It’s how you’re built. How your mind works. I overreacted. I don’t know why I left the room like that. I know you would never demand anything of me.”
“Oh, not you, too. I liked it better when you were freaking out. I will not apologize for viewing the world according to logical, scientific principles. Which you could help me with by donating a small sample of blood.”
“A difficult one. I may have lied to him in the past about my affairs. He has, annoyingly, tasked himself with my safety, and he sees your mysterious past as a threat.”
No, he wasn’t afraid. He had been neck deep in selkies for two days and John wasn’t going to hurt him. It would be ridiculous to be afraid of him now. So why was he so jumpy when John’s steps descended down the staircase? His breath shortened and he had to wipe his sweaty palms on his trousers as he stared at the seal skin John held to his midsection. He was naked once more. It made sense. Much less awkward than changing down here in front of Sherlock. A glimmer of uncertainty clung to John’s face as he stepped forward, peering at Sherlock, likely verifying that Sherlock did want to do this and wouldn’t fly into hysterics like last time. Heat burned Sherlock’s cheeks in embarrassment, which was compounded when John, in a grand show of cosmic irony, asked if he was okay.
To Sherlock’s immense disappointment, they awoke on their respective sides of the beds. Well, the fourth time that Sherlock woke up. He normally woke up several times a night, his mind unable to shut up even in sleep, but this was the first time since childhood that his senses had been instantly attuned to the breath and sight of someone else lying next to him. And John was an infinitely better bedmate than Mycroft, who snored and complained that Sherlock’s feet were cold. John lied on his back, one arm under the covers and one splayed out on his side, hand almost hanging off the side. He looked much as he had yesterday on the sofa, and just like then, Sherlock curled up to watch. John’s breaths raised the blanket in gentle waves. There had been some tugging over it in the middle of the night when Sherlock pilled it all on top of himself and had been awoken by John yanking on it, protesting that he was cold. Maybe having two blankets would help. Although they could still deprive the other of their warmth by rolling over it in their sleep, as John had. A good width of the blanket was tucked under his body, leaving Sherlock with barely enough to cover his own. Perhaps John should sleep in seal form, which required no blanket.
Earnest words from an honest man. Usually honest. It would have to do. He didn’t have the energy to stay angry at Greg, nor did he want to. It wasn’t him who invaded Sherlock’s privacy.
“I’m not really a fan of small talk,” he said, his annoyance abruptly banished by the awkward uncertainty that he’d suffered earlier in the cab.
“He’s been putting more of an effort in general,” Greg said. “He was even a fraction less rude than usual during our last case.”
“I want to. I used to take heroin and cocaine. Sometimes other things, but those were my main ones.”
No. That wasn’t possible. Sherlock had clearly seen wrong. The man had come from somewhere else. But where? Had he been here all along? But what happened to the seal? Nothing remained of it but a crumpled mess of skin on the rocks, like it had been violently eviscerated and deboned in the blink of an eye. Impossible. The man crawled toward the water, splashing it on his face, then turned around, standing up to approach Sherlock.
No less frustrating than the case that had brought him here. Gregson, a colleague of Lestrade’s in the local force, had asked him to put in a good word with Sherlock after being stumped on a robbery for over a week. Having no other cases to entertain him at the time, Sherlock took the chance to get out of the city for a bit and seek inspiration among the majestic cliffs, but such was proving peskily elusive for both the case and his composition. He was beginning to fear that this one might join the ranks of his unsolved cases. That did happen on occasion, no less irritating than the last. But he wasn’t giving up yet. There were still a couple of avenues of inquiry that he could explore.
Before long, the sound of a car reached his ears. A blue-grey sedan, four years old, came from the north, parking as close as its driver dared without risking getting stuck on the pebbles. John emerged, dressed in a jumper and jeans. Sherlock’s eyes widened. That’s where he had seen him. The man who had heard him playing the violin. That had been John.
“We tried hard not to advertise it,” Greg said. “But you didn’t completely miss it. You caught on that I was seeing someone before Susan. You commented on it.”
There was nothing bloody dramatic about it, but Sherlock let the matter go as John deposited him on the seat. It had sped up things considerably, not that he would be admitting that out loud. He scooched back on the seat so he could stretch out his legs and keep his injured ankle elevated. Once he was settled, John fetched Sherlock’s discarded shoe and sock and got into the driver’s seat and turned on the car. As he drove off, Sherlock pulled his phone out of his pocket and called Gregson, informing him about what had become of his thief. He left out the part where he had hallucinated John emerging from a seal. He hardly needed to become a laughing stock simply because his jarred brain had decided to malfunction for a moment. Gregson wanted to know John’s address straightaway to look for him, but Sherlock held off on giving it to him, shushing John when he supplied it after Sherlock told Gregson that he didn’t know it. Gregson’s interference could wait until after Sherlock had gotten a chance to learn more about John.
John taped Sherlock’s bandage closed and returned his foot to the sofa. Sherlock pursed his lips, displeased at losing his comfortable spot on John’s lap.
Mycroft’s smile softened into a fond and awed “I can’t believe Sherlock actually asked to breathe the same air as me” expression that made Sherlock squirm with awkward embarrassment. Would this ever stop feeling weird? God, he needed a cigarette. It was times like this that he wished that he enjoyed drinking. It would be so much easier.
They sat in Mrs. Hudson’s little-used dining room. Even when she had overnight guests, they tended to eat breakfast at the kitchen table. But this was a proper dinner, so they would eat it at a proper table. Mycroft better appreciate the effort they were making on his behalf.
“Uh, yeah,” John said. “We can do that.” John grinned at Sherlock. “It has to be your name, of course.”
John took him by the torso again, easing him onto the seat. Once he was down, Sherlock pulled his legs inside, careful to arrange his right ankle into the least painful position. John shut the door for him and went around the car to get in. He pulled away into the road, driving them back towards his house.
“I accompanied Victor to the airport to say good-bye. Mycroft tailed me, made sure to keep me in his sights so that I wouldn’t slip away afterwards. He took me to his house. Stayed with me the entire day and night. He knew that if he left me alone, I would run off to get a fix. I ended up staying there for a week. But he couldn’t remain with me all the time. He had to work. I promised not to leave. He wasn’t sure if he should trust me. I didn’t know if he should, either, or how much I meant to keep my promise. Well, I did for that week, distracting myself with books and puzzles and figuring out unsolved cases that Mycroft left with me to keep me busy. Highly illegal for him to do that, but he has never fussed overmuch over that. It did keep me entertained for a bit. Victor emailed. We were in contact, but he was so busy with the move that he only wrote to me twice in that week. I read them over so many times.”
“Sorry,” John muttered. “I’m glad you didn’t and that you’re sober now. Does he think that I’m getting you drugs?”
“Mrs. Hudson, this is my brother Mycroft. Mycroft, this is Mrs. Hudson. Do feel free to ignore him, Mrs. Hudson. I do.”
Mycroft shifted his umbrella back and forth about an inch, gripping it tightly by the handle. That was his disappointed motion. He been so eager to discover John’s secret before forcing himself to quit pushing.
“God, you sound like Mycroft. I don’t need any sort of influence, stabilizing or otherwise. But he is wonderful.” A smile jerked on Sherlock’s face at that. “He loves music. He’s smart. Not as smart as me, obviously, but who is?”
“Nor can you play a record in the sea,” Sherlock said, opting to switch to a form of musical appreciation that John could engage in.
Too much of a penchant for rules aside, working a case with John was exhilarating. Not only did they discover crucial evidence together, but they ran a daredevil chase across tiny side streets and rooftops. Sure, their suspect had been a bad guess, but God, had it been worth it to see that delighted grin on John’s face. Both out of breath, laughing as they shared a joke, adrenaline pumping in their veins as they fled from a cop that happened by. They walked the rest of their way to Baker Street, too wired to take a cab or the Tube.
Yet they grew even more delighted when he described his awe upon standing in the tower of a bridge in Prague and gazing at the medieval city spread out below, painted in reds and golds from the sunset. Or being thrilled by the simple taste of chocolate ice cream. Or exploding in laughter when watching the slapstick antics of Monty Python.
“I think I should try it in this one,” he said. “I don’t want to accidentally crush you in the middle of the night as a seal if I roll over.”
With one more glance at Sherlock, John wrapped the skin over his head and torso. The magical transformation was no less astounding now than it had been all those times before. As it encased him fully and John sank to the floor, Mycroft stiffened, clutching his umbrella. John’s body slimmed, and his face lengthened into the adorable snout that Sherlock had petted. Sherlock’s heart thundered in his chest, breath growing short through the wide smile on his face, but it faltered as his delight retreated under the sudden onslaught of dread at Mycroft’s reaction. He wouldn’t have John carted away and experimented on, not after giving his word, not when it meant betraying Sherlock’s trust in such a vicious manner. Yet the icy grip of nerves gnawing up his spine gripped him still as he studied the fearful shock on Mycroft’s face and how every muscle was tensed so hard that at any moment they were liable to snap. Sherlock must have looked much the same when John had revealed himself to him.
“Your fear was entirely justified,” Mycroft said. “John was afraid of the same. But I would never do anything to hurt you.”
“Come here,” he said and reached up to cradle Sherlock’s head, his fingers so gentle on his jack and neck. Sherlock leaned down eagerly, a desperate laugh bubbling in his throat, grasping John’s head as well. Their foreheads met, noses rubbing together, Sherlock’s uneven breath mingling with John’s steadier one.
“No, you can’t. Nor are there paintings or films. Or tea.” John raised his cup. “Also brilliant. The small trips weren’t enough for me. Every chance I got, I stayed for more time until it was too difficult to do so without some sort of proper documentation. So I decided to get some. We have people who do that, too. Most don’t decide to go to uni, though, and I’ve never heard of anyone else going to medical school.”
“That’s alright. You have a busy life and you’re building a new relationship. That’s time consuming. Don’t worry about me. I’m fine.”
“I only want to avoid misunderstandings.” Mycroft interlaced his fingers and placed his hands on the table, but that was much too businesslike. This was a personal matter. He removed his hands, placing them back down on the armrests. “I like you. I enjoy your company immensely. Conversing with you.” He smiled a bit. “Kissing you.”
“It’s not your fault,” he said. “You were just thinking out loud. Our situations are completely different. Your parents sound very different from mine. I made a choice. Now I have to live with the consequences. And it was for entirely different reasons, too. I think mum would have liked you.” John’s face grew wistful. “Except, well…”
“I composed this one some years ago,” Sherlock said, flattening his tone a bit else he betray himself. “I consider it my best piece, so you’ll have to adjust your expectations for the rest accordingly.”
“This brave front you’re putting on is embarrassing,” Sherlock said. “Weren’t you terrified only a moment ago?”
Sherlock nodded, mouthing “yes” even though Mycroft could see it in the rearview mirror, trying to impress upon John with his gaze that it was okay. His relationship with his brother might be a shamble of lies and underhanded manipulations, but Mycroft wouldn’t betray him like this. Nor would Sherlock, if it came to it. There had always been an invisible line in the sand that neither was willing to cross. Just because they didn’t get along didn’t mean that they didn’t care, not that Sherlock would ever be admitting that out loud, not for the greatest, most mind-tingling case in the world.
“We didn’t say much at first. Then he asked what kind of wine Mrs. Hudson likes. I told him that if he didn’t bring the most expensive rosé, I’d kick him out. Then he started going on about wines, knowing full well that I don’t know a damn thing about it. He shut up after I glared at him for long enough. To make him suffer, I started talking about the Marvel movies. His look of horror that I even know anything about them made up for trying to show me up earlier.”
Greg dropped his head on the table, his groan reverberating across the surface. Mycroft moved in closer, spreading his arm across Greg’s shoulders, then stopped himself. How much closeness was too much? They didn’t touch apart from hugs and hands on arms these days. Even this much might be overstepping. He began retracting his arm.
“Sherlock told me what happened,” Mycroft said, peering carefully at John without giving the appearance of doing so. “I’m glad you’ve returned. We’ll leave you two to talk.”
Sherlock would never have imagined anything like this ever happening to him. How could he have? Selkies. Fairies. Ghosts. Creatures of legend. How short-sighted his perspective had been. He had never been so glad to be wrong.
“I shall repeat what you told me, then. I want you to be happy. That wasn’t gong to happen with us, no matter how hard we tried.”
As Greg closed the door behind him, Sherlock sank back on the sofa, limbs spread out akimbo, more tired than he had been in ages. John sat beside him.
John squinted as he gazed out at the ocean, his eyes growing shiny. He blinked rapidly. Sherlock stroked his hand with his thumb.
John’s eyes fluttered open, squinting at the brightness of the sunlight filtering through the curtains.
“Of course,” Sherlock would say, smiling at him. When he could, he grabbed his violin and played him a tune to dispel the tension from the room and his memory. The sounds deepened the affection in John’s eyes, making it warmer, less unknowable, and Sherlock’s breath relaxed as he glided his bow over the strings.
Mycroft had smiled at that. He hesitated over his reply, certain that he should not be suggesting this, but it wasn’t like he would be developing a romantic entanglement with Greg, anyway. That wasn’t in his nature. He should make that clear.
John came down the stairs, clad in a dressing gown, his skin bundled in his arms, bare feet padding softly on the steps. Mycroft’s eyes widened, taking in every detail of the scene, already putting the pieces together even if he was too skeptical to believe them. He turned to Sherlock, but Sherlock looked straight ahead, all his reassurance for John, who was nervous again, hands gripping his skin a little too tightly. He met Sherlock’s eyes and smiled briefly, letting him know that he was okay. Sherlock relaxed a fraction.
“That’s all I need.” John stood up, tapping his hands on his thighs for a moment, gaze steady yet nervous on the door. “Okay, let’s do this.”
Sherlock dropped his head against the back of the sofa, raising the phone away from his mouth so that Mycroft wouldn’t hear him hold back a scream behind clenched teeth. Why did Mycroft always have to guilt him and make everything so damn difficult? Why couldn’t this one thing, just one, be simple?
“Sudden. I realized I need to get out for a bit. Take a break and do something with no relation to Susan or work or Sherlock assuring me that he’s not going to do something stupid at the next case.” Greg snorted. “Which he will, let’s be honest.”
A few, silent moments passed, then his phone chimed with a text. He grabbed it from his pocket. Lestrade was messaging him.
“I had little warning save for Sherlock implying that John and the seal that saved him were the same being mere moments before John transformed in front of me. I was hardly prepared for it. Although, to be fair, I wouldn’t have believed it otherwise. But it wasn’t under duress, in case there’s any doubt in your mind. I had agreed to let the matter go. He chose to show me. He had every right not to after the way I had treated him until that point.”
“I’m very glad to see you, too. Thank you for giving my brother an earful, even if I missed the show. Do you have anything made? I’m starving.”
“No more than the usual ache,” Sherlock said, cursing how shaky he sounded. “It’s nothing. I’m fine. I was just thinking.”
John jumped off the sofa and leaned down, taking Sherlock’s head in his hands and rubbing his nose and cheek against his. They had not done this since that first time. John’s touch was firmer than before, more hungry and desperate and filled with need. Sherlock shivered, fearing that John might kiss him even though he hadn’t tried to proposition Sherlock, unless Sherlock had missed a clue, which he might with his wretched inability to perceive such things sometimes. But John didn’t stray near his lips.
“It might take me a minute,” he said in a deliberate fashion, “to process this, yes. I never would have considered that this was even possible.”
Greg stepped inside slowly, eyes never leaving Mycroft’s own. Mycroft sucked in a breath. He was gazing into the eyes of a wolf, and that wolf was Greg Lestrade. How was this possible? He crouched down and reached out a hand, leaving it hovering between them. John had explained that werewolves were as physically affectionate as selkies and dogs, especially with their friends, so Greg shouldn’t mind, but Mycroft must still ask.
“No. It’s Lestrade, the DI who referred me to the case I was working here. He’s texting me about a new case.”
“Of course we’re worried,” Mrs. Hudson said. “We love you. We couldn’t not worry about even if you had some boring office job and never put yourself in harm’s way.”
As soon as John put down his fork, Sherlock did as well, too eager to get to the better part of their evening to care about his body’s need for nutrition. He’d consumed enough for his stomach to leave him alone for a while. But John remarked on the “coincidence” and made him continue eating until Sherlock was able to convincingly declare himself “full”. They couldn’t lie down right away without their stomachs cramping up, so they cuddled on the sofa for a bit while watching telly. Rather, John watched telly, for Sherlock tossed his legs on John’s lap and rested his temple on the top of John’s hair, arms wrapped around his shoulders. John reached up and rubbed his nape.
“Precisely. You don’t. But if you’re so concerned about me languishing in solitude, it will please you to know that Greg will be joining me this evening. Yes,” Sherlock added at Mycroft’s subtle brow rise. “I know his name now.”
“I wanted to see how you’re doing,” he said, as mildly as if he were commenting on the weather, if he was the sort to go in for that kind of thing.
Greg hesitated, brows drawn in annoyance, but after a moment he sighed, shoulders sagging, and stood back.
John’s eyes widened and he sat up, utterly startled, as if Sherlock’s words were anything less than the truth.
Mrs. Hudson’s face softened. If she were physically here, she’d be touching Sherlock’s shoulders right now to physically reassure him. She didn’t try to deny that most people just saw him as a tool to be used or a pesky annoyance, for how could anyone deny that? Those who actually liked him and weren’t just grateful to him because they owed him a favor were very few. He could count them all in one hand. Once, long ago, he had feared that Mrs. Hudson might be amongst the latter, but she had stuck by him, calling him regularly, calls that Sherlock would answer despite preferring to text, inviting him over for tea and dinner, putting up with his infodumping and rants of whatever was annoying him that day, and offering him a place to live when she bought the building at 221 Baker Street. A much nicer place than the tiny, cramped one bedroom that Sherlock had been stuck in before in a much less central part of the city. And, to ensure that he could manage it, she insisted on giving him a discount on his rent so deep that Sherlock was sure that he wasn’t paying her even half of what the space was worth.
“Not a word.” Sherlock smirked. “Decline, by all means. You know that we wouldn’t be so closed lipped if it wasn’t something fat and juicy.”
Mycroft smiled. Poor John was tying himself into knots with all that rambling. Yet what he said was oddly touching. Mycroft had certainly not received any similar declaration from Victor, although they hadn’t interacted anywhere near as much, or as intimately, even after years of Victor being in Sherlock’s life. Mycroft had referred to John as his brother-in-law earlier, but that had been to tease Sherlock, not as any sort of serious declaration. However, family relationships were very close in John’s culture. He might have considered Mycroft to be just that since he got together with Sherlock. For the second time in as many days, Mycroft found himself oddly at a loss as to what to say.
“During one of my early conversations with Greg about you, we began to speak about other things. He invited me for ice cream.”
Sudden exhaustion swept over him. Why did his parents always have to ruin everything? It was 2019, for fuck’s sake. Who cared about respectability anymore except for old bigots who refused to accept that the world had moved on without them? John squeezed his hand and kissed his knuckles. Sherlock rested his head on John’s shoulder, tucking in as close as he could. Damn these armrests. He really needed to get that bench.
“Do you think you may have ever felt the sort of love they show in films?” Mycroft asked Sherlock on one of his visits to his flat.
“Earlier, I should have asked how your month went. I could see that you’re still separated from your wife and that it had not gone well, so I didn’t see the point in asking you what I already knew, but I can see how that might have felt a bit one sided to you. So I’m asking now.”
“I’m not sure whether to be glad or sorry that you didn’t take that picture,” she said. “There have been times when I’ve let Marge have it. Oh, the look on her face… I would have liked to have framed that.”
Sherlock did so, taking in the foyer at a glance. It was a pretty typical house. 1990s construction, yet remodeled in a modern style. Crisp, off white walls. Pleasant art prints for decoration, along assorted knickknacks. A frame had once stood on a tall, slender table beside the door, where a small wicker basket held Greg’s keys and wallet. The size indicated the sort that usually held family portraits. It had clearly been a picture of Susan, or Susan and Greg together. The were various such instances visible through the sitting room, as well. The pair were quite fond of photographs. There were obvious gaps between the remaining ones on tables and on one of the walls of the sitting room where some had been removed. What remained were of Greg, relatives and friends. Not shared friends, surely. None of the furniture had been dusted in ages, although the floor had at least been swept within the past week. A stack of cardboard boxes was wedged between the fridge and the counter. A coating of dust clung to their upper edges. Greg had purchased the boxes, had stored them in the first place that he could think of to get them out of the way, and hadn’t bothered to put them anywhere else.
“What was?” Mrs. Hudson asked, keeping her voice just as low. “I’ve seen him get cross plenty of times.”
John slid off him and lied on his side, back to Sherlock, who pressed himself behind him and draped his right arm over his torso. John grabbed it, wrapping it more securely. He did the same with Sherlock’s right leg. Sherlock quietly let John arrange him however he pleased until they were lying still, John’s head tucked under his chin, limbs encasing him in a secure cocoon, John’s fingers twined in his.
“I know,” he said. “I could tell in your voicemail. I suppose I should have known that something like this might happen. You love taking risks. Mycroft told me. Greg told me. What we did today more than fits the bill. But you considering getting into a murderer’s car knowing that he’s a killer... That’s too much, Sherlock. That’s too fucking much.”
“I haven’t deleted anything you’ve done,” he continued, forcing his tongue to move as he looked firmly out the window. “Including the not bad things.”
Sherlock gaped at him, breath held in his throat. He scrutinized John’s face. The weary line of his mouth. The worried shoulders. The pleading gleaming in his eyes.
“Never mind all that,” Mycroft said. “Is there a reason why we’re going to John’s house beyond the need for privacy?”
Then Greg had to squash their buzz by being an impatient busybody who couldn’t wait by the phone like he was supposed to. And of all the insulting excuses to snoop into Sherlock’s flat he chose a drug bust? Sherlock might have to rethink this friendship thing.
“Small? I… I appreciate that you find me adorable, but I’ll have you know that I’m a very respectable size for my people. You’re the giant.”
His cheeky expression would usually have annoyed Mycroft, but not this time. It made Greg’s face even more handsome, a feature that Mycroft had been allured by from the moment that he looked at Greg’s file. Fine bone structure, a strong chin (a particular weakness of Mycroft’s), soft, brown eyes, an easy, radiant smile, brown hair slowly going grey, giving him a delicious salt and pepper look. A thorough search into his background revealed a couple of male dalliances, so he wouldn’t necessarily be adverse to Mycroft’s advances. That is, unless he didn’t go for the “arrogant” type. Although, once Greg’s irritation at being ambushed on the street and dragged here had died down, Mycroft had detected signs of appreciation for his own looks.
“How could you possibly have known?” Sherlock asked. “Wait. Are we sure that we’re both talking about the same thing?”
“No, it doesn’t. That’s the complete opposite of how this works. And you’re healing. Your body needs nutrients. I’m taking you out to eat. I’ve got nothing made at home. This will be faster.”
God, he really was a fucking idiot. He ripped off the clothes and put on pajamas instead. A dressing gown served just as well as a layer to hug around himself. Typical, household garb. Nothing suspicious about it at all.
“Of course I am. You’ve been mopey all day. I hate it. Mrs. Hudson is free tonight. She can come with us. And Greg, too, if he can.”
“The thief was killed by an animal,” Mycroft said. “His injuries leave no doubt about it. So it can’t be that.”
Greg. The reason why Mycroft was being so infuriatingly odd. Shocking that Mycroft mentioned him at all.
Sherlock scowled. Damn it, maybe Mycroft was right. Mrs. Hudson had been quite shocked when she’d first seen his specimens, but surely John wasn’t so squeamish, was he?
“He knows I conduct experiments and study the effects of wounds and foreign substances on the body, so it shouldn’t be surprising. It’s not going to scare him off.”
Besides, his current chances were decidedly male inclined courtesy of Greg, who interrupted his bleak musings by calling him. Smiling at his name on his mobile screen, Mycroft stood up and walked out of the screening room, leaving the beach scene playing behind him. They had been in communication since their talk, but in a limited fashion, reminiscent of when Greg had first gotten together with Susan. Greg needed the distance, yet it ached nonetheless.
“I just wanted to ask you how your trip went. I know I already asked you in my text, but it is the sort of thing friends do.”
“Hello, Gregory,” Sherlock said with a wide grin, a feeling of well-being radiating through him. “Where’s my case?”
He hurried off down the beach. Sherlock followed him with his gaze until he was out of sight, then turned to the corpse, crawling towards it. The proof of the animal attack was even more conclusive up close. Sherlock couldn’t see evidence of the animal’s return to the sea, but it was difficult to determine its movements at all on the pebbled ground. The entire thing was decidedly suspicious. A seal arriving precisely when the thief had been about to plunge a knife into Sherlock, killing his attacker, then disappearing, replaced by this mysterious doctor. A most unlikely sequence of events, yet he was certainly not about to explain it away by succumbing to the man’s idiotic insistence that he was a selkie as if Sherlock were some fool.
“Except for Mrs. Hudson. Lestrade claims not to be, but he’s lying. So yes. You are a rare breed. It’s refreshing.”
“Of course you do,” Mrs. Hudson said, smiling fondly. See? Not offended at all. “I didn’t mean to keep you two for so long.”
“That’s alright. I can endure some loud films. I’ll abstain from commenting on their quality, as well.”
“I don’t think so,” Sherlock said. “Is this about Victor? I didn’t feel that for him.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed further as he scanned Mycroft’s person, not that there were any relevant clues for him to find. “No, this is about you.” Sherlock’s eyes widened. “Are you… Are you in love with someone?”
“That’s alright,” Mrs. Hudson said. “I’m used to secrecy. Sherlock himself isn’t forthcoming at the best of times.”
“I don’t know what to say,” John stammered. “I’m so overwhelmed right now. I never thought… Thank you.”
“But no one gets anything exclusively on their own merit,” Sherlock said, frowning. “Or despite of it.”
Sherlock dropped into his chair. Fuck, his ankle was killing him. He snatched his hands out of his pockets, unable to keep his fingers still anymore. He shouldn’t be biting his nails. He’d told himself to stop. They wound up horribly mangled every time, and he had to cut them even shorter, but he couldn’t manage to yank his fingers out of his mouth. Mycroft pulled up the desk chair and sat down across from him.
“I’m headed there right now. That’s my brother Mycroft. He’s basically the British government. But don’t worry. I won’t let him hurt you, understand? You will be okay.”
John rushed forward and took Sherlock’s hands in his, squeezing gently, looking intensely into Sherlock’s eyes.
“I’ll bandage it again in about a half hour.” He frowned suddenly, uncertain. “That is, if you’re willing to stay that long.”
“Please,” Sherlock continued, forcing the towel on his chest down a fraction. “I’ll be right out, okay?”
“Yes, that’s certainly a plus. I’m never bored with him. It’s so hard to find non-boring people. And he doesn’t treat me like a freak.” Sherlock’s fingers wiggled in his lap. “He likes me for me, not just the usefulness of my intellectual abilities.”
“I trust you have a car waiting for me downstairs, else you wouldn’t have let him text me. I’m going to go fetch him, and he will be leaving with me.”
“You’re too easy,” he said. “Mycroft isn’t as menacing as all that. He just likes putting on a show for the lesser mortals.”
“It’s the first instrument I remember hearing,” John said. “We went to this music festival in Galway when I was small. All I remember are bits and pieces. I’m not sure how much of it is real anymore, but I have this clear image of a woman onstage playing a guitar. It was a folk song, I think. If I’ve heard it since, I can’t recognize it. Who knows how much of it my brain has altered every time I think of it. But I know that moment happened. The feeling of joy and wonder at hearing that amazing sound was very real. There’s nothing like that in the ocean. We sing. That we do. Not me. You do not want me to sing for you. It sounds horrible. But instruments don’t really come into it.”
None of them were holding back now. John was free to transform whenever he wanted without worry, and he did to Mrs. Hudson’s delight. John thoroughly acquainted himself with Mrs. Hudson’s flat in seal form, cheerfully hopping about and snuggling up to the two of them on the sofa while Sherlock filled her in about the aspects of his month-long stay in Dover that he couldn’t get into before. Sherlock and John had planned on going to the National Gallery, but they stayed in all day enjoying their newfound freedom, postponing it for the next day. They did go on Sunday morning, but cut it short because Greg came over to the flat. Now that Sherlock was over (almost over) not being able to see the obvious, he could enjoy Greg’s lingering amazement that he hadn’t been able to keep his closely guarded secret from Mrs. Hudson for more than two months. Really quite embarrassing when you thought about it. A repeat of two weekends before ensued with the addition of Mrs. Hudson. John and Greg shifted into their animal forms and snuggled together, as well as with everyone else. Sherlock curled up with John on the floor for a while, since John’s seal form was too bulky for the two of them to be on the sofa. Sherlock wrapped himself around him, John’s snout resting on his collarbone, and closed his eyes, listening to Mrs. Hudson coo over Greg’s cuter form as she pet him on the sofa. Contentment washed over Sherlock, a smile growing on his face.
Sherlock turned over, careful not to jostle his ankle, and shut his eyes again for more sleep, but his body failed to cooperate. In the quiet, he heard John snoring in his study. They had both left their doors slightly ajar in case Sherlock needed something in the middle of the night and wanted to call John, as if he couldn’t get around on his own. But John insisted and it was his house, so Sherlock gave in. He lied on his back, the sun lighting bright red behind his closed eyelids, listening to the soft rhythm of John’s breath. Seal snores weren’t that different from human snores, it turned out. It was faint to Sherlock’s hearing, so it would be loud were John lying next to him, yet not unbearably so. Sherlock wasn’t accustomed to suffering much snoring around him, and, like most, didn’t find it particularly pleasant, yet John’s soothed him. The living presence of someone else in the same house as him was comforting. Sure, Mrs. Hudson was just downstairs at Baker Street, and the building had all been one house back upon a time, yet this felt different somehow. The proximity, perhaps. Or the friendship that they had professed in such a silly, yet delightful fashion yesterday. Or the excitement that still thrummed through Sherlock at having a friend at all, unsought, yet most welcome. Mycroft was right. He did do better with a friend. Not that Sherlock would admit that to him.
She led him inside her flat past Mycroft, who stepped to the side. Sherlock got the urge to stick his tongue out at him, but managed to smirk, instead. Strictly out of politeness, Mrs. Hudson offered Mycroft some food, as well, but Mycroft wisely declined, no doubt sensing that it would be weird for him to accept food that she had made specifically for Sherlock. Like all mums, Mrs. Hudson expressed love through feeding her charge, which was Sherlock. Most certainly not his annoying brother who only stopped by Baker Street to irritate him. Mycroft was envious of Sherlock’s relationship with Mrs. Hudson. No matter how many airs he put on about not caring about their estranged situation with their parents and not needing friends, he couldn’t disguise that little glimmer of yearning under his indifferent mask whenever Mrs. Hudson coddled Sherlock in front of him. And was it really necessary for him to arrive early and wait with Mrs. Hudson when one of his spies doubtlessly informed him the instant that Sherlock walked through the doors of Scotland Yard?
“It’s just Greg,” Sherlock muttered as he lounged on the bed while John fastidiously tugged at his jumper. “He’s seen me much more casual than this.”
“Not everyone panics, though,” John said, but he began to look pensive. “Some people are delighted. And she’s pretty sturdy. Look, we’ll be careful, alright? I don’t have to transform while I’m there.”
“Liar. Your breathing is still altered. I bet your heart rate is, too. And you’re gripping your umbrella like it’s the only thing keeping you from going insane.”
Sherlock, at least, continued to improve. One of his past clients had invited him to rent a flat at a building that she had just purchased. The location was ideal. Baker Street, right in the heart of central London. An old Victorian home had been divided into three flats. The client, Martha Hudson, would take the one on the ground floor, while Sherlock had his pick of the other two. Mycroft had done a thorough search into her background as soon as he was informed that his little brother had high tailed it to Florida to recover sufficient evidence to condemn Mrs. Hudson’s husband to be executed. She was around their mother’s age and was a cheerful, kindly sort. Her past was checkered, to say the least, but evidence suggested that she had been as ignorant of the true extent of her husband’s business as she claimed. This, however, didn’t keep her from pocketing a substantial portion of his illegal gains after the trial was over, which was how she was able to afford central London property, a tasteful Aston Martin, and to charge Sherlock a pittance to rent a flat from her.
He crossed his arms over his chest, gaze guarded and uncertain. Why? Sherlock wouldn’t let Mycroft lock him up. He must know that.
He pushed past them and went inside, finding the kettle steaming and ready on the stove. He poured himself a cup and turned to John and Mrs. Hudson, who were engaging in scintillating formalities of small talk, complete with complaining about the rain. This was England. What did they expect? Bright, sunny skies all year long? But he couldn’t hold onto his annoyance, not with John right in front of him, finally in London and getting to know Mrs. Hudson.
Yet if John hadn’t happened to swim by at just the right time, he would be dead. Like Mycroft had said. John, who was watching him from the window, Greg probably at his side. He could feel their gazes on the back of his neck, apprehensive, concerned, wondering what he was doing talking to this cabbie when there was a killer on the loose. Always missing the obvious, even John. Oh, John, can’t you see it? Can’t you deduce the only possible explanation of all the facts?
“No. I mean, I don’t think so. Yes, I want to get back together, if he stops being pigheaded about not interfering in my future happiness. I don’t think kids are in the cards for me anymore. I told him that.”
“I’m sorry,” John said, resting his forehead on the side of Sherlock’s neck. “I can’t imagine how horrible that must have been.”
“I warn you,” Sherlock said. “I sleep at odd hours, play the violin when I’m thinking, and I’m prone to
“Thank you,” Greg said, grabbing his coat. “I don’t need to get into more trouble right now.” He frowned, unsure. “Telling him that I’m a wolf is likely to go okay, right? He’s not going to freak out? It’s not like it’s all new information by now.”
Mycroft’s voice drooped even more. Sherlock could see him rubbing his forehead and closing his eyes in exhaustion.
Mycroft wondered if Sherlock knew that John was criticizing his living habits like this with him. The poor man felt awful about talking behind his back and cut himself off before going much further, but how could anyone fault him for being upset by Sherlock’s utter lack of hygiene? Mycroft certainly wouldn’t consume anything made in that kitchen. When he was there, he only ever had tea prepared by Mrs. Hudson in her own kitchen. Mycroft hoped that John would change his mind about letting Sherlock risk his health like this, and insist that he adopt a proper system for keeping his specimens. Lord knew that he’d never listen to Mycroft, but he might to his partner. Sherlock had always had a better track record of heeding his friends over his family. Although, in the case of their parents, that wasn’t a bad thing to do.
Greg took a moment to gather his words together. The whole thing was so unbearably awkward. Sherlock shouldn’t have said anything. But, no. He needed to say it. Greg had accepted and supported him without a moment’s hesitation, like a friend. Yes, they were friends. Work friends, Sherlock had thought, of a sort. But Sherlock trusted him. He depended on him far more than he’d realized for cases, and now for emotional support. Greg never made fun of him. Well, not in a malicious manner. Any comment he occasionally made was the light-hearted sort used in amicable joking between friends. Greg had already considered them friends. Despite Sherlock’s ignorance of his first name or refusal to ask how he was. He always asked Sherlock how he was doing, because that was what friends did. It was a bit unfair now that he thought of it. More than just uneven. How had Greg not complained before? Had he complained before? Maybe Sherlock had deleted it or not paid attention. People were so hard to read sometimes. Especially when Sherlock wasn’t focusing on them. Greg depended on him to solve his cases when he and his detectives were too thick to manage it. Would Greg have put up with him for as long as he had if he hadn’t been so desperate to see justice done to keep calling him back?
“It’s a committed, platonic relationship. More intimate than friendship. It can be monogamous or not. In many ways, it can seem like a romantic relationship to an outsider, only it’s not. I’ve only read about them, though, not been in one, obviously. But for my part, when I think of what I want with you, I think along those lines. I would also like something monogamous, unless the lack of sex is going to be a problem.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, standing up. “Very much so. I know I said I wouldn’t cut you off, but it has been a long week and I want some time alone with my partner.”
John touched Sherlock’s shoulders, gentle, so very gentle. Sherlock sank into his hands, then his body as he stepped forward and hugged him tightly. John returned the gesture readily, laying a soft kiss on his collarbone. Sherlock trembled at the gesture. So he hadn’t scared John off. If he had decided to touch Sherlock less for fear of giving the wrong impression, Sherlock didn’t know what he would have done.
Sherlock pulled up the video chat and called Mrs. Hudson, aiming the phone only at his face, his left leg jiggling. It took a while for her to answer, which made his leg shake even more, but her face finally popped up on the screen. Well, half her face. She still hadn’t learned to aim her camera properly, but the half that he could see looked delighted at the unexpected form of communication.
Though not with Susan, it would seem. Two months ago, not even two and a half years into their marriage, Greg called him in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, distressed, his breath short with barely suppressed hurt.
“I won’t, don’t worry. Out of curiosity, though, is there a particular reason why you don’t like that term?”
So, he should give up control then in this instance. Was that even a choice anymore? Of course not. He had taken it the numerous times when he reasoned that spending another night with Greg wouldn’t be as problematic as he feared. There was no question of severing relations with Greg now. Even if Greg weren’t Sherlock’s, and now John’s, friend, and even if it was possible for Mycroft to never see Greg again, how much would the oncoming years dull his affection? There was no guarantee that it would extinguish them completely. Despite himself and his conviction that romance was not the proper term for what he felt for Greg, Mycroft found himself a sad cliché shown in romcom after romcom, pining like a besotted child for the company of that one person that made him feel truly comfortable and not like he had to put on airs all the time. Sherlock had once been that person, but their childhood was long past. Besides, Greg not being his sibling brought incalculable advantages. And pleasures.
“Oh, shit,” Greg said, every muscle in his body stiff and on its guard. “Uh…” He rubbed his face, frowning in inner turmoil. “Fuck it. I’ll tell him. If he knows about John, then it’s okay, right?”
“So did I. At your age, the chances are slim if you want to have any chance of keeping up with them, which you do. Best face facts now and avoid false hopes. I told Mycroft that he was being an idiot. When isn’t he, really? I honestly don’t see what you see in him, but I don’t want you to be unhappy, so if you must, I suppose that’s fine. I could have worse for a brother-in-law.”
“I’m sure,” Greg said into his mouth as he pulled back a couple of inches. “So please don’t ask if I am, because I’ve thought about this so many times that I’m tired of my own thoughts. And you clearly want this, too, so…” Greg flashed a hopeful grin. “Are we good?”
“Oh, don’t look at me like that. He took it in stride. He pointed out how much more knowledgeable he is than me at certain important things.”
Greg’s eyes implored as keenly as his words. Mycroft held his breath. He shouldn’t. Greg wouldn’t thank him for being selfish no matter what he said, but he wouldn’t abide less than total honesty from him, either. A drawback of their close association was that Mycroft found it increasingly difficult to lie to him. Greg knew his tells. He caught him at it each of the few times that Mycroft attempted it.
“I suppose.” Sherlock frowned. “Why are you looking at me like that? Surely I’ve apologized in your presence at some point before.”
The note beside John’s train on the announcement board changed from On Time to Arriving. Sherlock rushed to the end of the platform and craned his neck to the side, peering down the tracks. The train came into view, a small pinprick growing in the distance, followed swiftly by the sound of the engine slowing down before reaching the station. A grin broke across Sherlock’s face and he gave a little jump, excitement thrilling through his veins. Someone beside him looked at him funny, but sod them. Who cared what some random person thought? Once the train stopped, Sherlock rushed to one of the middle entrances, where John had texted that he was sitting.
“Yes, you want me to be happy. I get it. You think I haven’t given this any thought? I know what people think when they first walk in here. I’ll warn him about the specimens, alright? That way, he won’t be surprised. That wouldn’t turn him off me, anyway. He’s not petty like that. If he were, he wouldn’t be worth my time. But he’s not. The lack of sex might do it, but he’s not complaining about that.”
There was only one potential solution. Sherlock despised himself for even considering it. Mycroft would never accept it, not without proof, but it was not in Sherlock’s right to give him that proof.
“No. They’re simply activities that can be interpreted however the participants want. I must say, I’m relieved that you haven’t protested that it’s not possible not to feel romantic feelings or called me cold for it.”
“Mrs. Hudson,” Mycroft said, turning to her with a charming smile. “Thank you for the invitation.” He held out the bottle. “I thought this might be suitable for the occasion.”
“As for your lack of musical talent, that one too easy. You love music. That would be clear to anyone who glanced at your sitting room. Yet the only instrument around, a guitar, is covered in dust. A light layer. You do clean it on occasion. But the strings are still new, hardly touched. Nor do your fingers show evidence of you playing on the regular or recently. There are tiny calluses on the tips of your right fingers, but fading fast. You had taken up the activity, but then stopped. There’s a book on how to play the guitar on your bookshelf. The creases on its spine only reach halfway through. You began studying it, but gave up. Why would you give up if you had any talent? If you played any other instrument, that would be in the guitar’s spot. Your body would also show signs of it, which it doesn’t.”
Mycroft put his phone down and picked up his fork, but didn’t touch his food. His brow wrinkled. That warm feeling in his chest remained.
More than willingness. Joy. Happiness glimmered in John’s eyes as he listened to Sherlock explain the tortuously long tribulations of the carpet killer case from last year, which he’d almost been forced to give up on. It purred when Sherlock pet him in his seal form, leaning into his touch, coaxing deeper massages out of him. It emanated from him as they watched telly together, John laughing at Sherlock’s mockery of the insipid storylines and myriad inaccuracies of the genre series that John watched.
The details poured out of him in a gushing torrent of frustration and confusion. Crowing in glee when Greg finally caved and gave him the case. Examining the body at Lauriston Gardens with John. The thrill of sharing a case with him. Their easy comradery in this, like in all things. Chasing the cab across Soho. Laughing with him. The joy of adrenaline surging through his body. Yelling at Greg for breaking into his flat under the pretext of a drug bust, of all condescending things. Figuring out that the cabbie was guilty. Following him downstairs. Confronting him on the street. Considering going with him, just for a second. Well, no more than a minute. It couldn’t have been more than a minute.
Checkers was followed by chess, which was followed by Operation, of all things, but Mycroft’s objection was only half-hearted and they both knew it. Mycroft had been supposed to have a meeting that afternoon, but he postponed it for the next day so that he could stay. Sherlock hadn’t suffered his presence for this long in ages, and he wasn’t about to forfeit it for some appointment with a cabinet minister, important or not.
“You’re welcome. You handled it a lot better this time. I have to admit, I was a little worried that you wouldn’t.”
“It’s a joke,” Sherlock said quickly. “God, I’m not actually going to do that. Would you stop worrying, please?”
Sherlock sucked in a breath, shocked. He rarely heard Mycroft use that tone. Quiet, firm, and devastating. He was bloody furious. Of course he’d figured out what Sherlock almost said. This wasn’t just an idle connection between him and Greg. He cared about him. Truly. Could he love Greg? But Mycroft didn’t feel love like that. He wasn’t interested.
It proved surprisingly hard to wait until the end of breakfast to inform Mrs. Hudson about his new, happy state. He almost slipped when she sent him another puppy picture, basically her new way of saying hello since Sherlock responded more readily to them. He waited impatiently while John got showered and dressed, scrolling through his news sites without actually focusing on any of the stories until John finally returned downstairs. He stopped at the end of the staircase, shoulders tense, hands bunched into nervous fists at his sides. He wore his usual attire, an off-white cable knit jumper with jeans and brown, leather shoes, and his hair was brushed to perfection. Soft. Approachable. Perfect for snuggles, but Sherlock must control that urge else he mess up John’s appearance and delay the announcement even further.
“Yes, you should have,” he said, stiff, not wanting to give an inch even as his worry grew. “Apology accepted, if that’s what it will take to get you to move onto what happened with Greg already.”
The creature that had executed such murderous violence yesterday peered at him with such concern, his hold soft and cautious on Sherlock’s ankle, his motions deliberate as he peeled back the bandage, careful to cause as little distress upon the injured tissue as possible. Sherlock’s ankle was a big, purple bruise in John’s hands, which stroked lightly atop his foot, checking that he hadn’t missed anything in his examination yesterday. Did selkies have doctors? Or was this discipline another human activity that John had wished to submerge himself in?
Sherlock scrutinized Greg. Everything about him looked normal. No expensive items of clothing. No signs of Mycroft’s affection. Nothing indicated any kind of connection to Mycroft at all. Had there been any and Sherlock had just ignored them? Christ, he should have paid closer attention. He was never as observant as he hoped to be. Mycroft was. Mycroft always was. He must have schooled Greg in how to lie to him about this.
“I know you love looming over people like a vampire,” Sherlock said when he was halfway up, “but would you quit staring at me?”
“Yeah. I wasn’t planning to. Things just went in that direction. Are you sure you’re okay with this? You look better than before, but you’re a little hard to read sometimes. I was expecting you to be more freaked out still.”
Sherlock scowled at the message. Mycroft couldn’t even see or hear him. How could he always deduce him so easily?
“Perhaps not,” he admitted. God, how he hated bowing in defeat to Mycroft in anything. “But afterwards… After a couple of years, you should have told me. Both of you.”
“Okay, then,” John said, not sounding fully convinced, but he was extending the skin. Sherlock clasped his hands, hardly daring to breathe as John sat on the floor and pulled his skin over his head. The effect was as shocking and fascinating as before. In a quick, few seconds, the man disappeared and a seal emerged in his place. Sherlock’s eyes widened as he gasped. An icy tremor ran down his back and arms, but it wasn’t fear. He wasn’t cowering this time, not moaning in distress as his world view imploded around him and a primordial terror screamed through him. The hours spent with John telling him stories and soothing his injuries had done the trick. An awed smile bloomed on Sherlock’s face as John edged forward, slowly at first, large, black eyes watching Sherlock so carefully, so concerned with not spooking him this time. Sherlock’s smile widened and he reached out with his right hand, palm up.
“You’ve never been interested in that sort of thing. You’re always calling it nonsense and saying that you’re going to delete it from your memory.”
Sherlock’s hands squeezed together. Right. This was it. There was nothing to worry about. Greg wasn’t even straight himself, not that he’d ever been open about it, but it was obvious enough from how he didn’t discriminate in his ogling, even though he thought that he was doing a good job of dissembling with his colleagues. Greg sat down on the sofa beside him, not super close, but enough that Sherlock could see him leaning toward him from the corner of his eye.
“I am not fretting,” Mycroft said some seconds later. “You would have begun speaking immediately were that the case.”
“Are you? You’re not just putting on a brave front like you do? You can tell me to fuck off if you want. I’d deserve it.”
“I’ve been chased by sharks a couple of times, too. That’s why I… Well, you’re so observant. You probably had already figured it out just by looking at me.”
How little they knew. Maybe Sherlock should come out to them. Destroy their fantasy once and for all, and make it clear that either they accepted their children the way they were or they wouldn’t have them at all.
“Please do. But wait until I get back so that I can enjoy the chastised look on his face. I rarely get to see it and it’s such fun.”
Huh. He hadn’t meant to mention that last bit. He hadn’t referenced it directly, so there was still time to backtrack and avoid the subject, although John would certainly ask what he was talking about.
John finally did as he was asked and they were off to the crime scene. He never enjoyed riding in a police cruiser, but John balked at paying for a cab when Greg could take them. Sherlock scowled at the partition between the front and back seats the entire way but kept his mind on task, mind buzzing with possibilities as he soaked up every detail of the files that Greg was finally letting him look at. And John was here with him this time. Finally! Talking through cases with him over the phone was nowhere near the same as having him at his side, examining a body right in front of their eyes, dazzling John with what was really basic observational skills, but John praised him and gazed at him like Sherlock was the most amazing being that he had ever seen. Coming from John, a living miracle, that meant more than Sherlock could ever express.
Greg sighed, passing a weary hand over his face. Beside them, John uttered a soft, “oh,” eyes wide in shock. Sherlock turned razor sharp eyes at him. John turned to him, eyes widening in realization at what he’d just done and shook his head, squeezing his lips.
“You thought about having sex with me,” Mycroft said, embarrassment and shocking vulnerability cringing in his stomach.
Another half hour passed before John emerged from the water. Sherlock looked up at the sound of flippers scuttling on the pebbles, the adorable sight of John hopping along making him smile. It was a pity that John couldn’t spend more time in this form. He was truly a sight for sore eyes. Not that his human form was bad to look at.  Not at all.
