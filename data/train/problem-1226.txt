Sherlock examines him to see how he’s reacting to this, his words are positive so that’s a good sign.
“No John tell me you’re not going over there, they can survive without you I’m sure” he’s already knows what Johns about to say.
John waits about two meters away from where Lestrade is talking to press, to not alert them that he and Sherlock are at the crime scene. Lestrade doesn’t need the extra drama the press cause when he and Sherlock are at a crime scene.
He checks his watch and excuses himself from the table, dropping his bowl back at the kitchen window and makes his way to the Colonels office.
Sherlock, through the computer seemed to relax at Johns’ reassurance. But continued to be irritated.
“John I would very much like to have your penis inside me now so if you would kindly hurry up and fuck me I would be very appreciative.”
For a split second Mycroft’s face looks confused?, Sherlock’s never seen the look on his brother’s face before. Just as soon as it was there, it’s gone again.
“Imaging how I feel. Seeing Lestrade all the time, he’s constantly looking for Mycroft to turn up at a crime scene or make any excuse to see him. I swear that’s the only reason he calls me to crime scenes half the time.”
He’s fully dressed and waits for John in his chair. He doesn’t have to wait long because he hears John’s footsteps down the stairs.
In the daylight John can see the base better, he notices the concrete walls with barbed wire on the top and the four guarded checkpoints to enter and leave through.
He pulls some gauze and bandages out of his pack and cleans the wound before he wraps his leg up. There’s no exit wound. He’s not going to bleed out. Well, not for a while anyway. It’ll be much worse to take the bullet out now and have the bleeding increase. At least if it stays in, his blood might be able to clot and stop flowing. He’s feeling light headed already.
John sighs, “I’m sure that’s not the case but at least he’s helping to get the work you do recognised. That’s nice at least. Probably one of the nicest things Mycroft Holmes has done in his life.”
Sherlock braces for impact. Locks his heart back up and uses his brain again. John’s about to say that he’s met someone. Or he moving out. Or he’s staying overseas indefinitely. Sherlock’s not sure he can handle what’s coming now. He takes a deep breath and reminds himself that he’s Sherlock Holmes. He doesn’t do feelings or caring. Mycroft’s voice in his head says ‘Caring is not an advantage.’
He knows Sherlock won’t bother when he’s gone. John takes his old dog tags out of his bedside drawer and the only two photos of him and Sherlock, one at his wedding and the night they met and put them with his stuff to pack.
And yet, Sherlock could no longer deny his attraction towards John had evolved. The extent of it became clear over dinner at Angelo’s. John’s flirting was a bit more obvious than usual because of the alcohol and it was becoming so easy to make him smile that he got caught up in the moment and flirted back. He couldn’t believe what he had done. Neither could John judging by his reaction, his reddening cheeks a pleasure to watch. Until Sherlock realised what was happening and panicked, deducing the passing waiter as a distraction and quickly pushed everything down.
John can barely hear a word he’s saying but gets the general idea of what’s happening. The plane takes off and he uses his flight time to catch up on rest the Lieutenant Colonel has suggested. It’s going to be a long day.
“I’m surprised you let your staff have the day off Mycroft, but I’m sure you have enough experience with food that you know what you’re doing.”
Suddenly there was the sound of a door opening and a light spreading into the hallway. They broke apart quickly, Sherlock pulled his belstafe tightly around him to hide his half open shirt and erection. John just adjusted his pants and combed a hand through his hair.
“John, may we please have penetrative intercourse? You promised we could for my birthday.” John chokes on his tea.
John lets his eyes rest on his flatmate for a few more seconds and smiles fondly. He exits, closing the door to the flat and his civilian life behind him.
He looked up through his lashed to see John who was suddenly very awake and had moved onto his elbows to watch Sherlock with hungry eyes.
And he’s retreating suddenly out of the room. Sherlock can hear his footsteps on the stairs before he can understand what’s just happened.
After lunch they go to some shops and Sherlock’s parents treat him to some new clothes. He is an adult and capable of buying them himself, Sherlock argues. But his mother insists, because she wants to pick them so Sherlock actually looks respectable.
As soon as that was done though, John pounced. Kissing Sherlock both harder and softer at the same time. He started to rub his palm against Sherlock’s flagging erection but the contact had it interested again. The feelings were so overwhelming and Sherlock couldn’t think straight. Well honestly, nothing about John’s hands unbuttoning his trousers and moving them into his pants to grasp his bottom was anywhere near straight.
There are small buildings with writing on the door he assumes are for the senior officers and the tents for the soldiers to sleep in are actual structures made with heavy duty canvas and metal. There a plenty of people walking around, some armed, some not, all wearing the same as him except maybe those without the top jacket layer of the uniform.
When he finished bandaging himself up, he searches the pack for some anti-inflammatories, antibiotics or pain killers. He find a few of each and downs them with some water from his canteen.
He now has less than 24 hours left before he has to leave. And if he’s being completely honestly he can’t bear the thought of leaving Sherlock but he just has to, his country needs him and if there’s anything John Watson loves move than Sherlock Holmes, it’s his country. He tucks that last revealation away to think about later, or probably never, he doesn’t have time for any of that.
Sherlock finally got up from the couch and showered, put a pot of tea on and reheated some lunch Mrs Hudson has put in the refrigerator.
“John, while I retrieve my violin, would you like to accompany me and I shall give you that tour you wanted earlier.”
This continued until the afternoon, Mrs Hudson bringing lunch and tea up but Sherlock didn’t even acknowledge she was there. Sherlock got sick of playing and lay down on the couch in his mind palace and only when his phone rang in his bedroom did he get up.
“Mrs Hudson ever the optimist, why are you here? Why do you continue to impose yourselves on our lives? You’re just our landlady”
“It’s Serbian John. ‘Nas dvojica protiv sveta.’ It means, ‘the two of us against the world’. It’s what kept me going while I was away. Maybe it will do the same for you.”
John decides to wait until after dinner to tell Sherlock, no use ruining a good meal, his last at Angelo’s for a while.
Most of the base is asleep as it is nearly three o’clock in the morning but there are still Soldiers doing the night rounds and staying guard, one of whom is apparently someone John has to share the quarters with as there is only two other men fast asleep.
“Yeh probably, let get this over with anyway, had a date planned with a friend of a friend, seemed nice but she wasn’t really understanding about me cancelling and I should apologise”
Sherlock showers and dresses in his best suit, dark navy, and tucks the dog tags under his shirt as he buttons it up.
“He clearly wants you to make a good impression as tonight will basically be an informal interview.”
John leaves the flat door unlocked for Sherlock when he finally comes home and has a shower, changing for bed.
John didn’t sever their contact from the hug earlier and didn’t pull away from him when they were holding hands. He didn’t even twitch when Sherlock rested his head on his shoulder in the cab and just now in the couch John didn’t seem uncomfortable. It could be indicative of a fond friendship where there is no more personal space boundaries or it could mean that John likes being close to him.
Angelo brings desert for them, just simple churros with chocolate dipping sauce. Sherlock gets it all over his face and John can’t stop laughing, Sherlock’s annoyed at first,
At first I planned this to be just one big giant fic but I really wanted to add some Mystrade into it and I know some people aren’t fans of that so I thought I would split the fic into two. And then I realised that not only does Sherlock and the readers deserve closure but John does as well.. So this will be a three part series.
The gunfire has slowed down but he still hears shots ring out. There’s a  commotion at the door as Smith helps Fred bring a bleeding George through to where he is.
When he returned to the flat mid morning after his case for Mycroft, which had taken nearly twenty four hours, Sherlock was about to go to bed but heard his laptop chime.
Mrs Hudson finishes some decorating with John and tells them to hurry and get ready for the party. Sherlock goes to hop into the shower and notices that he forgot to take off John’s dog tags. He had little time alone since John arrived and forgot about them completely. He goes to take them off but realises he can use them to help test John. If John’s angry at him for taking them then he obviously has overstepped the friendship boundaries and if he doesn’t get angry, John might like the fact that’s he’s got them.
John’s tongue is suddenly at his lips, demanding entrance. Which Sherlock relents to. They cling to each other as the kiss deepens even further. The feeling of John’s tongue against his own draws a moan from Sherlock’s throat.
He sits alone on the long benches by himself not avoiding people but not yet ready to mingle, he wants to just get to his meeting with the Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel so he know where they will place him.
“Don’t give me that John I know why they’ve called you back and not any other doctor. With the way you shoot you would have to have had a lot of practice so I know you’re not a normal doctor John, don’t insult me”.
While John started to panic, Sherlock turned towards him, trying to get him back to him, but the excitement in his expression was just a tad disturbing. "You have to go back!"
"I watched him being arrested and taken away to never be seen again. There were rumours that he was to be taken to an asylum on an island far from London, but I did not want to hear of it. I was prepared to leave everything of this event behind me after the funeral. Only one thing never sat right with me. He had kept everything of Victor. Everything but his heart. I could never understand why he would take it out when it was the one organ keeping the body alive."
On the call of his name, Wiggins took a step forward. "The vamps are streaming into the city like salmons down the river. Acting like animals at night, but right now they're silent. Won't take 'em long to press forward, though. Ah, my news, ser. It's 'bout the Queen."
"Maybe." Lestrade took a long moment to look back and forth between the two of them. "But not all of them."
"Alright," Sherlock whispers to Rosie, trying not to raise his voice to a level on which it would break. "The two of us can manage while Daddy is out, can’t we?"
and, especially in the last chapter, from Doyle himself. And yes, I admit to having been inspired by the first
"May I have this dance?" He didn't demand this time. He asked. Putting himself in a position in which the answer could be a rejection, could be a
"But if there was only one in the world," he whispered, and put his hand to Sherlock's strangely warm cheek, stunning the detective and reducing him to eyes blown open, "it would be you."
"Pardon me?" The policeman knitted his brows and looked at him in confusion before his mouth then opened in sudden comprehension.
They had reached the end of the street in a slow pace that kept the world from spinning too fast. Still, the world of their thoughts appeared to be revolving around a somewhat mad and fireball-like persona. Maybe Sherlock Holmes was using witchcraft too, after all, to be stuck in the minds of those who meet him and stay there.
Sherlock does as he wishes (he'd do anything) and can feel him bending over (the warmth is gone for a moment, it's horrible), but he leans back down on him, his chest and belly and thighs against Sherlock's back and hips and arse, and damn, he wants. He isn't sure what he wants precisely, but he wants. There's the sound of a cap being opened, a bit of creaking and
"Smoke bombs," he whispered under his breath before only the seconds later the thick smoke clouds were billowing out, quickly climbing up the walls and spreading across the whole alley.
"Of course!“ Lestrade's rising temper turned up the volume and the strength of his voice. "Of course I'd be expected to do bad police work, give out case files to complete strangers, because it was so bloody likely that The Great Sherlock Holmes had it all worked out, sending out men who he apparently trusts more than his closest friends! Of course I should've known you would just take some time off, return from the depths of God knows wherever you've been-"
"Earlier this night you have accused me of playing the hero. It is very unwise to make people into heroes, Doctor."
John was convinced that it had to be the wine talking out of him that had made his mind hazy and tired as he looked at him and thought that
"Apparently you haven’t because if you look at the number of thumb-ups-" Sherlock leans over to scroll down on the touchpad. "There, twelve thousand positive to one thousand negative. Are you saying twelve thousand people are just wrong, John?"
"We have been trying to evacuate the buildings they invaded and rescue the survivors," he began, pointing at the outer areas closer to the edges of the map. "They are coming from over the walls and making their way to the inside."
"Clarity," Mycroft answered so eloquently that he must gone through this dialogue in his head beforehand. Sherlock always assumed that was how the man won all of his arguments.
has the potential to give John exactly what he didn't know he needed but now finds himself hoping and craving for.
His gaze shot at Irene Adler and his grin was meant to show teeth rather than express gratitude. Irene's own aggravating smile was fairly honest compared to whatever he was doing. But it made John understand, at last. She was the result.
"No, no, no," John interfered. "But these are not human. There is more to a human being than the ability to think, is there not? You cannot just throw together a few odds and ends, bit of gears and cogs and create life!"
"Do as he says," he told them in an exhausted tone before straightening his posture and shouting, "Holmes, really?"
"You're very confident in your abilities, I see. Well, John Watson," she slowly wandered around him as if to measure him up and render her verdict about this or that. It only made John twitch uncomfortably. Why was she so intimidating?
John tried very hard, and tried genuinely, not to let his mind wander at this. It was only that the way Sherlock said it suggested... well, actually it didn't suggest anything. John simply liked him too much. But then he remembered that this was the same man who had not known he could fire bullets from a gun in his arm. Which reminded him again that he was dangerous. And how inconvenient it was that it had always been the dangerous people he fancied the most.
Now he looked at him with a long intensity in his cloudy eyes like he was seeing something in him that had not been there before.
But he didn't think. The only command that could control him now was in Sherlock's voice. And there it was.
It took a lot out of his opponent to stay calm. He pressed his lips together, closed and opened his eyes once more. "My name is under strict concealment. I couldn't possibly tell you, even if I wanted to."
It was not as bad as John had presumed. In the end, they did, in fact, mostly talk about the conditions of his employment, what could be asked of both parties and what could not. Now that John actually knew what it meant for him to work here and what he was expected to do, he noticed he was a bit … not disappointed, that would be ludicrous. It was just that, since he had heard of Moriarty being this criminal mastermind, he had expected slightly different conditions for the work that was to be done. To keep quiet, for example. Or perhaps a tolerance for corpses and their disposal and not asking questions. But no, nothing.
"And why would I do that? Why would I help out a robotic copy of a mad detective that has gone wild? After all, there must be a reason for you being here."
When John took a deep breath, he was surprised by how much it felt like he was coming back to life. "Hold on. Are you saying he wanted you to be involved in a battle?"
But then he still has the evidence of their time together, throbbing with renewed interest between his legs at the memory that is playing in Sherlock's head. He will have to take care of that, eventually. It won't simply go away at this state. Usually he would be annoyed now, regarding this kind of activity as tedious and thinking less of himself for having to give in to his transport. But today everything else seems to be the complete opposite from the life he thought he was living.
There it is. The mask slowly drops and Sherlock Holmes is left stripped and naked. For a few moments only, of course. But all those seconds are enough, and they feel like hours with both of them just looking at each other. It is different. It is sad and to realise that again and again, and not being able to do anything about it, hurts.
"Yes!" In an act of desperation, John took one of Sherlock's hands, and he could not help but feel proud at surprising the detective. Sherlock looked at him with widened eyes but made no move to escape his grip. "I believe in you. I believe that I know you, genuinely, and that what you have shown to me was real. You feel so real to me, Sherlock Holmes. I wouldn't care if the whole world despised you and told me to keep my distance."
"Sherlock Holmes," said he, and threw his own arm at John. Due to quick reflexes, he caught the hand along with the whole arm before it could hit him in the face. Certainly the strangest handshake to date.
He watched him walk up and down on stage, arms behind his back. He reminded him of a caged animal behind bars, having lost its mind from being watched by thousands of eyes for too long. But despite Moriarty being one man against a good twenty, his position left no room for misinterpretations: He was the superior party in this scene and all the scenes yet to come. Something mad and deadly was looking out of the darkness of those eyes.
. So could it be that perhaps James Moriarty, the possible criminal mastermind, was actually, in a very questionable and twisted way, on their side? An idea to save the people of London and win this war that could only come true after lots of people were murdered first.
"Baker Street was finally a place I felt content enough coming back to. From then on, the work gave me enough of a distraction to keep my mind at bay, additionally granting me the satisfaction of lowering the number of England's lunatics. Due to my obvious advantages over the police department, my help to them soon provided me with a reputation and I became the world's only consulting detective.
Sherlock opened the first two buttons of his coat and took out a long wooden pipe. He placed it between his lips (that John's eyes couldn't help but be drawn to in that moment) before he then took out a box of matches. John wondered if he should warn him about fire in a small room, but then he had already lit his pipe. The smell of burnt tobacco filled the air, and the ash glowed in an orange pond of its own embers. Soon the smoke was all around him. He coughed.
That provoked a laugh from the inspector. "Well, not exactly how I'd put it. Certainly not how he would've put it, either. But, uhm, in a way he trusted me. More than any other Scotland Yarder at any rate. Shouldn't you have figured that since he's apparently sent you to me?"
They swap positions and Sherlock lets his hands run up his thighs, his hands still shaking and his heart still pumping too fast. He has to put his head down, and his jaw lays above one of John's hipbones because he has trouble holding it up himself.
They both burst out laughing. The rush of adrenaline hit him like a giant blast. He didn't know how Sherlock's system worked, but he had to feel it, too. They were laughing and giggling like schoolboys.
John blinks at him a few times. Then he kisses him on the mouth, deeply. Deeply, like he loves him. "Good. Brilliant.
John tries to adjust to the fact that his life is now regulated by different kinds of maniacs. He decides to be where Sherlock Holmes needs him to, and once he realises that Moriarty will put his dubious plans into action much sooner than they expected, he knows that there is no other way. He has to be involved and fight.
She looked upset, and he felt guilty for a second, but still could not stop smiling. When he shot a glance at Sherlock he saw that he was smiling, too, and so John began to chuckle. Sherlock's deep voice reached his ears with quiet laughter, and John joined in. They laughed, absurdly, for no reason at all, until Mrs Hudson stomped away as if she was personally offended.
"You envy me?" John laughed. He expected this to end in a comment about him being simple and Sherlock being complex. But it didn't.
"So, as you know," he started, looking at him with a straight face, "I am, at the moment present, not a part of the human kind with which you are familiar. I am being kept alive inside of this body consisting of mechanics and technology too complicated for the common minds of the dull."
Irene held out her hand for him to take and her smile broadened. "Nice to meet you. Dr Watson, I believe?"
"And with this, I will have to enlighten you again, Dr Watson, and ask you this: is the man not in the mind rather than in the transport that forms around him? Willing to enlighten you again and tell you that what holds it all together, and what brings all that to life in this new shell of mine, is a soul. This is what he couldn't take from me. And maybe the soul is bound to be where it belongs."
but that wasn't so easy when there was coffee in one's mouth. He put the mug down on his desk, which was completely overflooded with what appeared to be the papers and case files. "Oh, so you really are a colleague then? And I even thought you are far too well dressed and clean-shaven for a rough sleeper! Smelling better, too."
"I hope you don't drown, you bastard." And with that, John shoved him over the railing to watch him fall into the river water. The other guards caught up, all bending over to see if Moriarty would emerge on the surface. He was smart enough not to. Either that or he couldn't swim.
"Uh-uh, Mary," Moriarty warned. "If you'd pardon the milady's behaviour. It is, indeed, fairly impolite to joke around in an interview."
Sherlock started smiling a little smugly and tilted his head, as he had apparently said that out loud, that little
"Serving you breakfast, so you won't starve eventually. Aren't you the observant one of us?" John says, meaning this right here and right now, as if everything about this belonged to a typical morning routine of them. Incredible.
John doesn't let him finish any of his thoughts. He leans down ever so slowly, until his right elbow is propped next to Sherlock's dark curls, which make an untamed mess on the pillow. His other hand, Sherlock notices as his gaze involuntarily drops between John's legs when he gets even closer, secures the towel around his waist, but it slides down a little more. He takes in a shuddering breath and his eyes widen as John's fall close.
He had absolutely no idea what he was trying to tell him there, but it sounded endlessly poetic. He wondered whose quote that was, as he felt like he had heard it before.
. John had never heard that name before. Despite that, he found the interiors to be fitting its name, even though he had no idea what the name meant. Dark wood covered the walls and floor, and the main hall was full of old men with grey beards sitting on broad chairs without talking to each other.
him was just as impressive, sure. But it did make him question which of these superhuman qualities had always been a part of Sherlock and which were only a mixture of high technology and internally controlled manipulation. And, should the latter be the case, would Sherlock even know or remember?
. Your smell was making me mad," John mumbles, continuing to kiss him. By the time he is lightly sucking the skin into his mouth, releasing it, sucking it in again, Sherlock is whimpering helplessly and his knuckles are painted white from the strength of his grip on the chair.
"Oho," he laughed out loud, apparently an act to tell John he was impressed, "An army surgeon! Well, sometimes I do wish, as much as I love them, that my wife, God may bless her, or my beautiful daughter would have borne me a lad to serve Queen and Country. What an honourable work that must be for a man!"
that I am not doing this anymore. If you know anything about where he is or what he is doing, pray, tell me, and please tell me if he is still in one bit."
She had her arm stretched out for him to examine on top of the tablecloth. He touched it with care, mindful not to hurt her. It looked quite nasty, and he didn't understand why she was not wearing anything to at least protect the injury from getting infected. It was certainly a burn wound that had peeled the skin off her arm. The fire must have bitten down to the flesh. How was she not in greater pain?
Sherlock entered the room beneath the Scotland Yard police department like a thunderstorm. John stood next to him with his arms crossed.
, there is nothing he wants to do more than fuck him, mark him, come on him. The hand Sherlock has wrapped around his shaft tightens around him, slowly. The slowest and most pleasurable torture. His hand moves upwards. Sherlock’s eyes are glued to the sight of it, the first little drips of precome leaking out. His cheeks are flushed. He feels his hot breath going fast, and knowing he is so affected by
John only glared at him. The man's expression changed as well. In the blink of an eye, his eyes were made of steel. Done with playing games?
He goes shopping and gets money out to leave Mrs Hudson for rent until he returns and lots of unperishable foods for the cupboards and stocks everything for Sherlock, who is still asleep. John’s uniform and baggage arrive from the base but Mrs Hudson answers the door and lets them up to the flat knowing Mycroft’s men and follows when they bring it up.
“Sherlock, even though I’ve done a few things with a bloke before, I haven’t done that. The whole thing.”
“What? Technically you’re a Captain in the British Army, so you need to dress like one. Even Lestrade will be in his policeman getup. The Superintendent and Chief Superintendent will be there and there’s a rumour that the Chief is thinking about retiring. So there will be a DCI spot available from next year. I’m pretty sure, thanks to my help of course, that Lestrade will be the prime candidate for the position.”
“So um, we don’t have to if you don’t want to. It’s just a stupid tradition. Mrs Hudson will never know if we don’t.”
Sherlock moaned and John capture his lips. John lined his own erection up and wrapped his hand around both of them.
He stands and leans on the flat door and watches Sherlock play for a bit. When Sherlock finishes he places his violin back in his case and looks at John from the mirror above the fireplace.
Sherlock felt it in his toes and shouted out John’s name as he came. The orgasm ripped through him and he shuddered through it. When he started to come down from it, he felt John tense above him and says his name.
John says sternly from where he is leaning against the couch in Lestrade’s office, looking a bit worse for wear himself.
Mycroft actually looks sad that Sherlock’s decided to give up. But when Sherlock asks where his old violin is Mycroft smiles and tells him it’s in his old room. It must be all the alcohol. John’s never seen Sherlock actively want to spend time with his brother and he’s not sure he’s seen a genuine smile come from Mycroft before. A sly grin or grimace, but never a smile.
John chuckles a bit at that, his mood finally returning to something that doesn’t have him about to yell. Johns gotten used to Sherlock’s weird humour and it has become kind of comforting to have around and is something he’ll miss when he leaves.
Sherlock looked up at John. Trying to put all the things he felt for John into that look. John must have understood because he smiled warmly at Sherlock and dipped to kiss him.
John makes his was back upstairs and can hear that Sherlock has picked up his violin and begins to play a song that John particularly likes, he doesn’t know what it’s called though.
They both release the hold on each other immediately, almost like they’ve been burned. John steps back, away from the pull of Sherlock’s body, like he doesn’t trust himself to be near him.
They keep far away from Anderson and his wife. Sherlock wouldn’t be able to help himself. Even with John telling him not too.
Both Lestrade and John look at Sherlock with surprise. They are even more surprised when Mycroft begins to make his way over.
They follow her into the flat and John tries to help her but she shoo’s him away. He takes a seat in his chair across from Sherlock and smiles at him. Sherlock returns the smile and they just sit there like that for ages.
Sherlock moaned at the words John whispered into his ear and ground particularly hard against John. He felt John’s own cock twitch on his right leg in response. John apparently also shared the sentiment about wanting to touch him everywhere, his hand traveling lower to Sherlock’s hardening cock.
“Well, he is a bit difficult to deal with sometimes but I wouldn’t live without him. He definitely keeps life interesting.”
John can feel his come sliding out of Sherlock’s arse alongside his dick. When he goes to pull out Sherlock says, “No. Stay there, stay inside me for a while. I feel complete with you inside me.” John argues he has to check for any damage but Sherlock says that can wait. John breaths out and kisses Sherlock languidly.
Mycroft sighs. “He’s barely been divorced eighteen months Sherlock. And the fact he was married to a women severely lowers my chance with him. He’s probably not gay or even bisexual so I have no reason to act upon anything.”
After loading and suiting up they head out. For some reason John has an uneasy feeling in his stomach as they pass through the checkpoint.
“I’m about ninety eight percent sure that this isn’t my old suit. I know because there’s a small tear, or was a small tear, on the inside of the sleeve and now it’s magically gone and it fits better than it ever has.”
Sherlock reaches for Mrs Hudson’s present under the tree and hears a soft clinking sound when he stands back up.
John apparently had done this before, or perhaps just picked things up from having it done to him because the way he flicked his tongue over the slit left Sherlock breathless and gasping Johns name. John was good, very good at this indeed, so good in fact that when John finally wrapped his lips around Sherlocks cock that he almost came instantly. He managed to control the urge but felt his orgasm build in the pit of his stomach.
He heard the key enter the lock and when the door swung open Sherlock heard a voice swear. Apparently upon inspecting the lock Lestrade has deduced that he hadn’t been broken into and that it was just Sherlock.
They stop speaking and Sherlock faintly hears them apologise for his loss and that John was an important member of the army. They will not cease to try to find him despite mounting difficulty and evidence that suggests he will be recovered. His body. They mean they’ll find and bring his body back. Sherlock just doesn’t want to hear it anymore. Mrs Hudson’s tears have soaked his shirt through.
Sherlock has moved and managed to half cover John’s body as he reaches for the remote. John just keeps laughing as Sherlock struggles and Sherlock begins to laugh as well despite himself, losing his balance.
“Thank you Gentlemen for informing us and thank you for your service. If you don’t mind I need to take Mrs Hudson back inside now. My apologies. Have a good day”
They enter the main ballroom after handing over their jackets at coat check and the place is covered in Christmas decorations, mistletoe and tinsel all over the place. There is Met police officers everywhere but some have brought their significant others so it’s not just a sea of uniforms.
Dressed in his military fatigues once again he tucks his dog tags into his shirt and places his duffle bag near the flat door.
John must have not realised there was anything on him and peered closer to see himself in the screen and wiped his fingers across the patch.
Their connection is broken when a waiter arrives with their food. They both seem absolutely starving and basically inhale their food until they’re stuffed full.
They tell him they’ll fit him with proper dress when he returns, taking his measurements now but it’ll have to be made. John also thinks they don’t give it to him now in case he doesn’t make it back this time.
After he’s been briefed about the base and the patrol he will be going on later with his squad, he is dismissed and LC Knight follows him out the door.
They’d almost been caught by Mrs Hudson. She had already assumed there’d been shagging the whole time but for her to accidentally see it was a different thing.
Sherlock was trembling. He tipped his head back for some support and spread his hands flush against the wall. He’d never felt this before, having only being on the giving end, never the receiving. He regrets things he did while high and looking for a fix. He’d never felt any emotion for the very few sexual partners he’d had in his life, none even resembling anything like the love he felt for john.
“You boys better start getting ready, we’re expected at your brothers at twelve o’clock. He’s sending a car around and it’ll be here in an hour.”
Sherlock just stares back at John, feeling his heart beat faster. John reaches into his shirt and pulls out his dog tags. He adds the present from Sherlock and it doesn’t look out of place at all. He puts them back on and tucks it into his shirt.
Someone explains that the company was attacked coming back from the other base about 200 kilometres away and were coming to join up with the remaining people here. John helps take a stretcher into the medical tent and begins work, some of the men are lucky to be alive and some have missing limbs they’ll never get back.
Sherlock sighs. “Yes John but I can easily shut the website down for a couple of days or put up a “shagging. back in ten.” sign.”
Sherlock woke up warm. A solid, warm body half draped over his. John. John and he had been intimate last night. It wasn’t a dream. John loved him.
Lestrade looks even more confused. “Why would you tell me that? Why do you think I even want to know about your sex life?”
“And you think my relationship with John is any different. I mean yes, technically his wife was a murdering psychopath but still it’s only been barely eighteen months either.” Sherlock sighs. “We’ve had years Mycroft. Even before Mary. He just doesn’t feel anything for me. And as you always say, ‘Caring is not an advantage’”
“And to rub it in that everyone leaves me eventually, and a side prize is that he gets to ogle Grant while doing so”
The tube dropped them a few streets away due to the large crowd that had taken over every inch of the city for the evening. Sherlock was out and gone before John had a chance to follow him. Sherlock then returned a moment later after he realised John wasn’t with him.
A loud shout of “JOHN, I’ve got it, get back in here”, shakes him out of his thoughts, returning to the room.
“Absolutely not darling. It’s a big birthday today, there’s no way I’m missing that. It’s been fourty years since you emerged from my womb and I think that deserves more than a card, don’t you.” Sherlock turns an even darker red and Johns restrained laugh is heard in the kitchen.
“You’ve been getting some action darling. Sex is one of the most important things for a man to experience in his life.”
“You can talk. How long have you been oggling Gavin? I doubt your ‘tea’ was purely for him to report back to you about me. Yes I know about your monthly meeting’s. It’s just an excuse so you can see him.”
“You worry me something Sherlock, these things you haven’t told me about. It makes me upset you were in such a dark place.”
He tucks his thoughts away as they pull up in front of Mycroft’s house. Sherlock has called it a ‘modest estate’ in Surrey, but John would call it a mansion. The driver pulls up in front of the steps to the verandah and open the doors for them. John is surprised that Mycroft himself is greeting them at the front door and not a butler or something equally pretentious.
“God John, I can’t believe you’ll be leaving, it feels like we just got you back. Sherlock will be such an arsehole when your gone”
“I don’t know how i feel about you documenting our sex life but I’m all for you eating more food. You’ve gotten skinnier while I was away.”
“SYRIA! You’re going back to war and you think that’s a good idea John, you’re not fit enough to go. You still have a shoulder injury from the last time you were at war, when you got SHOT!”
“Okay, let me know if you want me to stop at any time. I’m close anyway so I don’t think I’ll last very long.”
“That phone call, you leaving for most of the day, you told me of a bombing yesterday, the pitying look from Lestrade this morning, that delivery earlier. Blubbering Mrs Hudson”
John turns towards him and takes in what Sherlock is wearing. John’s eyes trail over his body and takes in every inch.
After they debrief him they direct him towards the airfield at the back of the base and he greets his commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel H. Ford and two subordinates that will be going with them.
He calculated in his head that John was only on a temporary tour, so that meant he would only be gone twelve months maximum and might get leave for Christmas.
John leaves to his room and as they have a few hours before dinner, he decides to take his time and indulge in things he won’t be able to have for a long while. He hops in the shower for a wank and a quick wash and then fills the bath and adds some bubbles and waits for it to fill as he shaves.
John looks breathtaking. Freshly shaven and hair neatly styled, his garb tailored perfectly to the John he is today not the John that left ten months ago. Bloody Mycroft did this on purpose. Sherlock properly takes in John’s form. His arms and shoulders have defined again, back to before Mary, and has lost his little beer belly he had started to grow.
Sherlock sighs and moves closer to the screen. John can see his eyes are sparkling with tears that have not yet been shed. Sherlock looks at him with so much love and adoration.
They end up in a fit of giggles with Sherlock’s head on the arm of the couch and him practically sitting in John’s lap. John doesn’t seem to mind, so Sherlock adds that to his mind palace for further thought.
John looks a bit shocked and turns a bit pink, then he seems to remember something and his express turns guarded.
Sherlock pulls off and makes his way back  up. They kiss for a bit and John does this thing with his tongue that makes Sherlock moan. He flips them over, reaches into the nightstand for lube and kisses his own way down Sherlock’s body.
John has a moment to understand everything Mycroft has just told him and tried not to think about some of the stuff Mycroft’s involved in.
Sherlock is standing right in front of the door when it opens and is distracted by Johns strong arms and light trail of golden hair that dips below Johns towel, oh how he would like to see where that trail goes.
John sudden change in topic means he must be overwhelmed or he feels awkward talking about Sherlock’s sex life. Or lack thereof currently. John can fix that right now if he wants but Sherlock will give him time. He lets John steer the conversation to a safer topic.
John arrives at the military barracks at 1300 hours and is escorted through the barracks to the medical office. He is greeted by the receptionist and introduces himself.
Sherlock let out a ragged breath, “No John, I want this, want you. But I want it at the same time. Properly together for our first time.”
They get the hint that his short response means he doesn’t want to talk about it and before they can talk to him again the cargo planes engines roars to life.
Sherlock glances over to John, who has taken the safer route and sat next to Sherlock’s father, but the barely contained laughter in his eyes doesn’t really make Sherlock believe his next words.
Once again I am very sorry if this cause any distress or upset anyone, that was not my intention. I hope, now that we all know John is alive, that it gives everyone some piece of mind. I hope you will stick with me for fic 3 if not fic 2.
“Mrs Hudson, delighted you could make it, you brought your luggage? The driver will take you to your sisters whenever you’re ready.”
The voice on the other line says that he's good to hear John shoulder is better because he's about to ask a big favour. Somehow, in his gut John knows what’s coming.
“Well, when I was younger I overheard Mycroft tell Mummy and Father that he was asexual and so I did my own research. I also decided that for the purposes of my career that I would also become asexual.”
But not to worry, a Mystrade sequel is in the works and will continue on in this universe. Sherlock will undoubtably make an apearence.
Sherlock reaches towards the dog tags that are no longer hidden under his shirt. Can’t hide them now. He’s surprised that it’s taken John this long to figure out his old ones are missing.
John suddenly bit down on Sherlock’s neck and sucked, Sherlock moaned louder and tried to grind against John’s lower body. John apparently got the hint because he used his knee to spread Sherlock’s legs and pushed his own between them for Sherlock to grind against.
Sherlock interrupts him. “Of course you need repayment. Can’t you just do something nice for your brother for once in your life. Of course not. Fine, what is it that you want from me. Go see mother on her birthday. Ring her once a month.”
John falls asleep after a while, still worrying about Sherlock but exhausted after not having slept in more than a day.
“Detective inspector, thank you for joining me for tea. I’ll keep you posted about the developments with your application. We should do this again sometime”
Mycroft texts to say he will send someone to deliver his new kit and duffel bag. He leaves everything out on the bed he will need to pack which isn’t much because he’s John Watson, soldier again, and takes time to clean up the flat the best he can.
Knight and John have both barely yelled “TAKE COVER,” when the first bullet rings out. The silence has disappeared but the ripple of the gunfire is deafening.
John is immersed in a conversation with Sherlock’s father but looks up and smiles at him every so often.
“Right, I’ll get packing tonight and make my way out to the Barack’s on the morning then, thanks for that”
He’s getting dizzy now. Light headed. The pain is excruciating. He turns his head towards the door with his last bit of strength. He is about to pass out. He hears yelling from the door. It’s not English. Men flood the room. Johns’ eyes close, he no longer has the energy to keep them open.
It’s night fall when they reach their destination and John doesn’t like the feel of the area.  The abandoned delapodated building is barely standing but is made from stone and looks quite big. John wonders what it used to be before the war, out here in the middle of nowhere. There’s too many hills surrounding the building. Too much ground for them to cover before they set up camp for the night. And it’s quiet. No sound. Except the wind.
“Shit. I’ve just had a quick chat to the Superintendent and buggered off to see you two. No wonder he looked pissed off when I left. Fuck. There goes the job then I suppose.”
The door closed and John turned back to Sherlock. Their eyes connected and they both simultaneously broke into giggles. John leaned against him and used Sherlock’s shoulder to cover up the sound and Sherlock put his hand over his mouth to stop his own laughter.
John just laughs and Sherlock moves to grab the remote. John just moves it over the arm of the couch out of Sherlock’s reach. That makes Sherlock more annoyed.
John quickly gets ready for sleep and hops into his stretcher bed, it’s not as comfy as his bed at home but he better get used to it as this is his life now for who knows how long.
“Oh I’m so sorry sir, we just meant we followed Doctor, I mean Captain Watson’s blog. And his history with the army is what inspired us to join”
It took a bit of time and some arguments but they’re closer than ever now and there does feel like they need to move forward with their relationship but John doesn’t have time to think about that now.
They grab a drink each and they do a circle of the room speaking to a few Sergeants and Detectives they recognise.
Sherlock notices Lestrade looks a bit sad but smiles. He jumps up to grab another beer and offers Sherlock one. He declines.
“Right, best just get it over with then aye” John turns to Sherlock and faces him head on, he really wants to know how Sherlock will react to this news, they’ve gotten even closer than they were before the fall since John has returned to Baker Street after Mary.
“Generally speaking, he is, but he has hinted at Mycroft leaning towards gentlemen as his preference.”
It’s the Privates from the flight over, they’ve obviously spotted him and come over to sit with a friendly face as they haven’t been assigned to a squad yet either.
The first month passed quickly but the second dragged on. They had daily patrols, some day trips and had a two day trip leaving late afternoon. He called Sherlock to let him know he wouldn’t be at the base and he’ll call as soon as he could.
He’s says picking up the phone. He speaks to Daniels and directs Sherlock to the conference room he put the evidence in, Daniels mumbled something about Donovan saying The Freak will want to see the evidence again probably so don’t bother putting it in storage yet cause somethings bound to go missing.
“If you want John, I will tell you everything from my birth until this day, but we have the rest of our lives to figure out each other past. I would prefer to look to the future.” John beamed at him. Sherlock’s voice drops deeper and insanely sultry. “A future where I preferably have your hard penis inside me.”
Sherlock just stares as John reaches out and intwines their hands together. John smiles at a stunned sherlock.
If this chapter distressed you in any way please read the AN/Spoiler note I’ve added in the next chapter.
He double checks he has everything packed and leaves his bag at the end of his bed and his uniform hanging up. As he received new dog tags he leaves his old ones on his bedside table.
Mrs Hudson just pulled her gown tighter around her and sighed, closing the flat door as she wandered back downstairs.
Sherlock decided that now was a good as time as any. He lifted the covers and hitched his leg over John, straddling his hips.
“I mean, as enjoyable as it was John, I doubt your skills in the bedroom could render me exhausted.”
Sherlock closes her door and walks back upstairs and as he enters his phone rings. It’s Mycroft. He called Sherlock earlier. Probably to tell him. And as normal Sherlock had ignored him. He answers.
Sherlock beams at John and their eyes lock, John always loves how Sherlock looks when he’s solved a case.
They put there coats on without saying a word and walking out onto the street Sherlock lets John hail a cab and opens the door for him as well.
As they approach the Eye, Sherlock begins to get nervous. Its a fifteen minute ride to the top and there’s only twenty two minutes to midnight so he better think of what he wants to say to John and make it quick.
Sherlock flushes a bit at that but smiles back at John. They’re interrupted by Mrs Hudson who squeals in delight and says they both look fantastic and insists on a picture.
When they arrive at dinner Angelo has their table set up and if either of them notice the candles or one red rose, neither of them say anything. Angelo’s looks pleased with himself as they have a chat to him and then order.
Hanging up he phone John hops of the bed. “I’m going to have a quick shower and then we better be off to this crime scene. Lestrade sounded like he wanted it over with soon.”
Okay so I got sick of repeating everyone’s rank so LC is Lieutenant Colonel and SS is Staff Sergeant. Also I know some of the military stuff is incorrect, I’m sorry. Also my OG characters are a bit different to normal Sherlock universe characters but I wanted to lighten things up a bit.
Other than that incident the lunch is pleasant and the food is great. Sherlock does ‘compliment’ his brother.
“So Sherlock, what you need to do is what we romantics call a Grand Gesture. It’s a way of showing your feelings for the other person in a romantic, profound way, so they understand the depth of your feelings for them.”
“Yes we could. I can document the amount of food consumed beforehand and see if it affects my stamina.”
John shows her how to use his phone to take a photo and she starts practicing while the boys move to the fireplace. Sherlock pretends to be annoyed but stands still for Mrs Hudson and when John places his hand on Sherlock’s lower back, Sherlock doesn’t move a muscle.
“You said my minor celebrity status? What do you mean by that, I’m not related to the queen or anything, so I’m just an ordinary soldier”
“That’s very nice of you John. Shall we take Mrs Hudson’s present to her downstairs with some tea. It is Christmas morning after all.”
They’ve never talked about any of this before but perhaps with last night, Sherlock should make his feelings know.
“He’s not here yet.” Sally yells to them as they walk away. “Some problem with his dry cleaning, he’ll be here later.”
“He’s busy with an experiment, that’s why I picked up. Yes it’s not important. We can be there in under an hour.” Sherlock grimaces.
“I don’t think I’ve heard Mycroft Holmes describes as fancy before. Sherlock tends to use the term ‘arrogant’ when describing his brother.”
After they finish dinner and John cleaned up he returns to the lounge room to finally speak to Sherlock. But Sherlock had picked up his violin and is about to start playing.
After breakfast the four of them, excluding Mrs Hudson who has book club, take a trip out to the museum to see the new exhibit and then to an art gallery John has never been to before.
After wrapping up the case Sherlock and John finally leave Scotland Yard and catch a Cab back to Baker Street. Sherlock barely manages to make it up the stairs to their apartment as the fatigue settles in and John knows he has to tell him soon because if Sherlock falls asleep now, the next time he wakes up John will already be gone.
“John, I really hate to ask this but I assume you've seen the news about Syria, that was the city next to our base. It took out one of our main hospitals including under half of our medical staff and we're in very short supply.”
Knight has apparently got the same idea as Smith. They gesture to each other and Knight makes her way over to them while John and Smith cover her. She continues over the few meters into the building, the doorway riddled with bullets a second after she enters.
“I’m glad you have such confidence in me Sherlock. I mean, I have been around you long enough to pick a few things up”
Sherlock doesn’t like the idea of John at war, he knows he can handle himself but the thought of John not coming home makes Sherlock angry and miserable at the same time.
Sherlock has flung himself over the couch. Talking to him on Skype every few days wasn’t enough. And now he wasn’t calling at all. He wants to see John again, touch him, hold him. He will forbid John to ever go anywhere for more than a day without him when he returns.
So I know that maybe the characters aren’t how they are in the show but I felt like changing them up a bit to suit the story. Hope its okay.
They all moved back outside for another drink and John told Sherlock off for being a dick to his brother. Another ‘sorry John’ was muttered.
Sherlock takes a few seconds to realise John’s lips are actually on his. His hands move to John’s waist, John’s left still holding the nape of his neck and the other resting on his shoulder.
The Thai arrives and John moves over to his chair and they eat their food in peace, with Sherlock occasionally pinching a piece of Johns phad Thai.
The car ride to Mycroft’s house was long and a bit boring to be honest. John kept glancing back over at Sherlock sitting across from him, thinking about the events of this morning. God if Mrs Hudson hadn’t interrupted them John wonders what would have happened.
He did, however, stay in his bedroom until as late as possible. Hoping not to run into John just yet. He hadn’t finished processing and couldn’t imagine how John would be feeling.
He lays down on the bed, breathing in the smell of John on the pillow and thinks sleep will help. Maybe when he wakes up this won’t be real and John will come walking through the door.
John smiles sadly at him. “It’s okay if you don’t feel the same Sherlock. I’m not looking for anything from you. As long as we can stay the way we are I’ll be the happiest man of the planet.”
“Copy that. I’ll be there. Over.” Watson said before turning back to the man, which he found with his knife untying his hands.
“Me! Childish?! Are you fucking shitting me?!” John tried to shake the man, but it was more like slipping him around.
“Like I said, it depends what you and your partner are looking for. This cotton braid is soft and easy to knot, but the knots get compacted easily and make them hard to untie. You’d need to keep scissors or shears close. The polypropylene braid is a bit more expensive, but the knots don’t compact as easily, and it feels great on skin. Here.” John slid the rope on the back of the man’s hand. “See how smooth it is? It’s also rated, I’d recommend this one if you plan to do suspensions.”
“I use the most efficient methods possible with the resources I have while keeping under the radar. You should be taking notes instead of complaining.” John looked at his partner in disbelief.
It dawned on John that he had gone through this alone. No, he had lost his partner along the way. John couldn’t help the look of empathy on his face. If he had been in the same situation, it was most likely he wouldn’t be alive today.
“And Ms Hawkins?” Stamford nudged Watson with is elbow. “It’s probably because Morgan can’t do anything without his assistant.”
“Of course. You’ve proven yourself quite valuable. And you’d have plenty of time to write between cases. Lestrade keeps saying I need someone to keep an eye on me. Apparently, I keep getting myself into dangerous situations.”
John helped Sherlock straighten then pulled him in for a filthy kiss that was mostly tongue. Sherlock’s chin and neck was covered in spit, but it didn’t seem to bother John. He still licked and grazed his teeth down to his shoulder.
Sherlock’s limbs protested as he unwrapped himself from John. He was sticky. The bedcover felt like sandpaper on his arse. Except none of that mattered as he watched a gloriously naked John walk to the bathroom and come back with a wet flannel. He gently wiped away the drying semen on Sherlock’s cock and stomach before disappearing into the bathroom once more. When he came back, John headed towards his duffle bag. Sherlock watched him, curious to see what he would pull out.
“Sherlock, am I going deaf?” John asked in a gentle voice. Sherlock wasn’t sure John had heard himself pose the question.
The rest of the comments were along the same line: character motivations, how Jane and Edward related to one another, asking if there was more between the two than physical attraction.
She bit her lip and waited, hoping she hadn’t pushed it too far. John’s frown was still there, but she still hadn’t said no.
Sherlock straightened before speaking, his eyes scanning the restaurant while he spoke. “It’s the Warehouse’s version of a prison. Only instead of keeping them in cells, their bodies are encased in bronze. The bronze sector houses history’s most dangerous criminals.”
Holmes closed his eyes and tried to think; the last thing he remembered was being in his dressing room with Ms Hawkins who had just given him a letter from-
Holmes stopped in front of them and looked from one truck to the other. “The motor should announce his arrival. We’ll have plenty of time to hide.”
The words were like music to John’s ears, what with the number of times he had read those same words, acting them out in front of his mirror as a young teenager. He answered without missing a beat.
As soon as Stamford adjourned the meeting, everyone started discussing what to wear and quickly made their way out to get ready. Watson caught Holmes’s attention while Wiggins and Murray were cornering him.
“I’m just saying we shouldn’t leave it just yet. You said it yourself, as soon as we started tracking it, it moved. So there’s a reason it’s here, right?” John didn’t know how, but he knew, just
Watson shook his head. He couldn’t understand how someone so careless could end up working with Scotland Yard. He was starting to understand why Lestrade thought someone should keep an eye on him.
With a pleased hum, John switched to his full hand to massage Sherlock’s arse while the other resumed its place in Sherlock’s hair. “Ten spanks. Count each one and I’ll let you come after.”
Even in their heightened state of arousal, the moment paused and stretched between them. Sherlock’s fingers slowed between John’s legs. Their lips grazed, exploring, gently pressing and sliding as they both took the time to enjoy the moment.
Watson paused. “Well, I haven’t eaten yet, and from what you’ve told me you don’t eat during cases.” He looked hopeful. “Now that this case is solved, I figured you wouldn’t put up much of a fight.”
A Warehouse filled with dangerous artefacts. Watson just couldn’t get his head around it. This was all too absurd.
“Yeah,” Watson nodded to Lestrade. “That’s probably the face I made. So I asked them what I should do.” And paused to eat.
“Tell me, tell me.” Holmes registered he was back to his London accent, knowing it didn’t matter anymore but unable to explain why. “How horrible was it to wear the nurse uniform?”
Let's just say this chapter is the beginning of "shit starts to happen", and it won't stop until the end.
Watson tried imagining it but everything he came up with seemed… different. What he had come to know and expect from a relationship had to be tossed aside. Then again, all he had to base his fantasy on was the memory of last night. Watson couldn’t help but notice how he was the one who had ended up in the more traditional feminine role. He had made dinner, did the washing up… but he already did do those things. Alone. With Holmes it had been… nice. Even if he spent most of it just sitting there reading.
“I like what you hear.” John watched as the woman eyed him from head to toe and flashed him a smile.
And yet John couldn’t help the nagging feeling that Sherlock’s statement applied to two completely different conversations.
The soft petting on Sherlock’s back turned into scratching, making him moan around John’s cock. He added a bit of suction, which caused obscene wet sounds every time John pulled out.
“This isn’t vengeance! From what I’ve learned in the past few days, this job is about protecting people. Manning is part of an organisation that puts artifacts into circulation among the general population and you expect me to sit back and do nothing about it?
The question snapped Sherlock out of his musings. He blinked up at John, who was gently dabbing at the blood on his cheek. The lamp was so close to John’s head it made his hair shine gold, but the angle cast a shadow over his eyes.
“Alive!” Morgan took one last step to the centre of the sound stage and spun, throwing his hands in the air. “This movie depends on the story, and this one is stagnant. Even with my magic I can’t breathe life into it.”
It was past midnight when his eyes started closing on their own. He dragged himself across the room and passed out on his bed, his mind finally at ease.
“That’s an even worse idea.” John wrote something on his chart and then proceeded to check Sherlock’s blood pressure. “What if somebody finds them? If I were you I’d keep them around my neck.”
Holmes felt himself relax, relieved his dialect wasn’t the issue. “I wasn’t shouting, I was projecting.”
“Yes, one of the perks of being Caretaker. So I take it you were the one affected?” Mycroft asked John who nodded soberly. “Stabbed by a glass blade
What would they do if they saw each other again? Assuming Holmes even wanted to see him again. Watson wished he hadn’t panicked, but he couldn’t help it. It had been so odd, waking up cuddled with a man. Hell, that whole evening had been filled with firsts. But somehow it didn’t matter as much until when he woke up with Holmes in his arms, curls tickling his cheek. Suddenly it was real, it wasn’t just an encounter in an alley, or a vivid fantasy, something Watson could forget.
Just then, Sherlock pulls off. He removes his lips with a smacking sound, a filthy sound that makes John want to take his head in his hands and shove his cock right between those kiss-swollen lips again.
. And it is so much more than amazement that John expresses. It is something rooted so deeply in his heart, in his soul, it seems. Like something would've clicked. Like he stepped right into a whirling storm and could never be the same, and not even wanting to if he could, not minding, no regrets, and full of...
"Because I ran away. Because you... helped me to slip through his fangs." Wherever Sherlock was looking now, it was not at John. At the scratches in the table's surface or down at his own chest, perhaps, but not at John. When he looked up again, he opened his mouth just to close it again. That was rare.
He would like to think that pyjama pants, an old tee and a dressing gown are just about appropriate for what he is doing. He is working. He can't remember when he has last done that. But it doesn't matter now, he reminds himself, and it doesn't matter what he is wearing, either. No matter if in nightwear or in one of his tailored suit, he is still Sherlock Holmes and he will still be a detective.
John tried to ignore the thought of Mary talking about him behind his back and simply nodded, "Former knight captain, yes," and was meanwhile lying a hand on top of the one of Mrs Hudson's that still caressed his other.
They all sat quietly around the table in the middle of the room. Even Anderson, who held his possibly broken nose in a blood-tainted handkerchief, seemed genuinely shocked.
"You have never seen this before, have you?" It is John's voice startling him instead, so soft and so quiet. Sherlock can only shake his head.
. Human then. A human being among these dark halls, living in the basement? Or was it a prisoner? Who would imprison someone in a place like this?
Slowly, he opened the door and found himself back in the hallway again. It felt as though it had gotten darker, and through the hallway window he saw that thick clouds had shoved themselves in front of the sun. There was no one to be seen, but he was sneaking over the floorboards like he was expecting them to creak any second.
He kicked her off and pinned her down instead, and in a blink, she was Sebastian Moran again. It didn't matter, same person, same enemy, so he punched him in the gut and watched him spit out air and then, with the incredible strength he had, roll back on him, now with his claws scratching on his armour. The tiger was back, keeping him down with its five hundred pounds and immeasurable strength. It bared its teeth and John was sure if there was ever a time for a tiger to bite a person's head off it was now.
The next day, after almost having overslept thanks to the outrageously delicious wine from the previous night and the nightmare-free hours of sleep, John finally found enough courage to quit his job. Especially Sarah Sawyer was disappointed to hear of his decision. It came to such a surprise, she said, for John had seemed to have grown rather passionate about it, if a little bit tired, over the past few days in particular.
"I'm so glad to see you!" She closed the distance between them to open her arms and hug him. It was a semi-personal hug, a pat on the back. "Could I persuade you into a dance with me?"
Sherlock ordered for him in Italian, the rumbling of his voice wrapping nicely around the syllables, and Angelo went off again before John could object to anything.
The man chuckled, but instead of mockery it sounded like a display of deep regret. He shook his head. "No. I'm working on behalf of my own life. A huge difference, as you may find,
is the word John Watson has looked for. Something he is currently lacking, standing in a cramped locker with Sherlock Holmes pressing him against the wall. He’s kneeling, a sight John can hardly ever not be mesmerised by, and at the moment massaging his hardening cock through the dampened fabric of his underwear.
, he had also not missed to remark) and was more or less willing to listen to what this consulting detective had to offer him.
John nodded. Of course, Moriarty could use a poisoner with influence and money on his side. Or, at the very least, in his secret underground quarters. Poison was not only the most dangerous weapon in a coward's hand, it was also the most effective way of controlling the nervous system. It would explain how he was able to numb the nerves enough to keep his victim's alive during their 'modifications'. Through the use of neurotoxins he could manipulate even the sanest of minds. Sherlock was lucky the maniac had not tried his evil hand on his wonderful brain.
John clears his throat and decides to go along with it. There is no more turning back from here on anyway.
There was no telegram in the hansom this time. He caught himself wishing there had been. That the quote from last time had been a clue, that Sherlock had wanted him to solve a puzzle. Even just as little exercise, a little game. Another secret only between the two of them. Instead there were only empty seats and one strange hat with a flap on each side. It looked like it had ears. Probably a forgotten accessory from a previous passenger.
A hand appeared on his shoulder, and he looked directly into Sherlock's solemn, soothing eye. It was impossibly blue and he almost missed his very loud, very clear advice.
, and John's mouth is on him again, just below his nape curl. He places an open-mouthed kiss just there. Sherlock shivers.
Sherlock can't do anything, not one thing at all but close his eyes and suck in a sharp breath when John presses his clothed chest against Sherlock's flushed skin, and suddenly he has two hands full of his lovely bottom and
The man let out a sigh, but did not look like he was going to elaborate. Shortening the distance between them with only a few long strides, hands clasped behind his back, he raised his brows in an expression of open interest. Was he was sizing him up? John was shifting from the one to the other leg, uncomfortable at being the focus of this stranger's full attention.
"What would life be without nights like this? Hmh? Without a little challenge, a little threat? What if we all stayed the same every day? I will tell you. Staying. Standing in the way of change. We would all be booored to death!"
John climbs the 17 stairs to their apartment and take his shoes and jacket off at the door and calls out to Sherlock that he’s home, making his way to the kitchen.
They both just look down toward the ground guiltily. Sherlock mutter something like ‘Sorry John’ and Mycroft nods to him and stands aside to let them in.
“John. This isn’t going to take care of itself. Get back here and finish what you started.” Sherlock calls through the door.
Now he’ll never see John again. Never hold him again. Never kiss him. Never feel John inside him. Never feel John’s love again. His heart breaks. Slowly, piece by piece until there is nothing left. He is hollow. He is a shell. He is nothing. He is nothing without John Hamish Watson.
They bring him towards John to see if he can patch him up. John manages to kneel over him without hurting his leg too much and begins another evaluation.
. He figured that would have to be him, the changeable man. Mr Moriarty. He should not be disappointed.
It took him a moment, but he nodded. His hand transformed to a gun, just as he had seen him do before. He stretched out his arm, aiming his weapon at... John's head!
Sherlock was still eyeing him suspiciously. He could not know for certain if this was the manipulation of Mr Holmes, the man whose highest priorities were to save his country whatever the costs, or just the truthful words of Mycroft, laying his heart bare for the first time. It was hard to tell because he wouldn't know how that looked like. He wouldn't know.
A loud noise echoed in their ears as the glass cracked around the bullet hole and split into a thousand little pieces. Gunsmoke was swirling upwards from where his hand had been replaced by the revolver. The spiders looked unimpressed, one of them even jumped and tried to ram their fangs into John's leg, but John kicked it and sent it flying across the room.
He said his name a few more times, voice growing deeper and heavier with desperation. He needed him. Just as John needed James. And he didn’t want to need him, but oh, he did. He was all alone, stuck in a war behind the trigger and in front of men he had never seen before and was yet meant to shoot down. Yes. He had killed people.
John, for some yet undiscovered reason, doesn't remember being engaged, believes he would still live and Baker Street and that Sherlock and he were somehow romantically involved.
John, of course, sees that he isn't eating, does he? He has to. As Sherlock, despite holding a buttered toast in front of his mouth for several minutes now, simply looks into the void absentmindedly, and he still feels quite exposed to, well, only the whole of the world. Although, he is aware of the fact that the whole of the world cannot see him right now. (No more hidden cameras in 221B, he checks up on that. Regularly. One could call it overreaction if it wasn't for certain
They look at each other for a long time. Sherlock's iris so blue and clear, his left eye red from the ruptured blood vessel, and there it is, hello again, you sharp and stinging guilt that never fails to surprise him. He bites his lip. That is his answer right there. He has made his decision.
Sherlock pointed at the group behind him. "These people are more of a family to me than you ever were. Except... maybe Anderson, but that's not the point." He shook his head.
"In my defence," he was helplessly saying back to the room. "You were all thinking it, were you not? This is what, the third time this happens and it never … I mean. I'm not saying … But how can you still," He was looking at Lestrade directly now, "
"Just tell me," he whispered, tired of fighting her, tired of distrust, "did you know that I would come and find him? Is that why Moriarty sent me to you?"
It is so quiet when no one makes a move. Sherlock tries to choke down what feels like dust in his dry throat, and it would make him cough. It's an almost biting pain to prevent himself from letting out the hard breath that got caught in his lungs. The running has caused his heart to knock perceptibly fast against the inside of his chest and the cage of ribs, so that he fears it might be heard and echoed in the dark alley, instead of just in his own ears.
Only now he noticed how Sherlock was staring at him. He blinked up to him, then shook his head to himself for having been lost in his thoughts, and caught the other man hiding a smile.
"Oh no." Sherlock could see them shooting from the rooftops as the smoke cleared more. "They are everywhere."
himself to be just the brain. To live alone and swallow down those looks that people would give him. Looks that said everything by people who kept their mouths shut, because they still needed his help. That's what he was there for, after all.
John had already known he had good reasons to doubt Mycroft Holmes. He put his warm hand over Sherlock's in the space between them. Surprise cleared his eyes from worry and he turned around to look at him.
So here they are now, a couple of hours later, making out on the sofa. Sherlock isn't able to keep his hands off John since he knows he is allowed to do all of these things now. But luckily, he doesn't have to. John very happily lets Sherlock climb on his lap for him to be snogged senseless. Physical intimacy with him fills a crack in his heart, and the feelings of this are so new and yet strangely familiar to him. It's so perfect, too perfect almost, to
The world shifted as his head wrapped itself around his name, driving him into bits and pieces of a memory and a fantasy intertwined. The blood was washed from his skin, and his skin felt dry and warm against the rippled fabric of another man’s tanktop. His muscles were evident through the single layer of khaki cloth, and John pressed himself against it further. The wall behind him was cold against his bare back, but he, he was so warm.
"No," Sherlock said as he pressed the full cup into his hand, mindful of letting him grab the handle, so he would not burn his skin.
Reluctantly, Anderson got up to take a leave. On his way out, he nearly bumped into a lanky figure, and Tom immediately apologised awkwardly, as he was.
The smile turned into an unfavourable grin with every bit of kindness lacking to support any authenticity behind it.
"Lestrade." Sherlock kept his hands behind his back, but John instinctively stretched his hand out to the inspector.
“Nothing happened between us,” John said, loudly, much more force behind his words than he had intended. “Nothing happens to me.”
“It’s okay,” Sherlock assures him. His voice is quiet, as if he was afraid of breaking emotions fragile and clear as glass. And when they aren’t clear as glass, they are a thick fog of all the things left unsaid. It’s very hard to see through it, but what he sees is sharp enough. “We’re here now.”
The taller man still held his arm in his other hand and gave a huff. "Not how people usually characterise me. They tend to mistake my sharp tongue for discourtesy." He waved the arm that was unmounted from his shoulder blade, gesturing through the room with it as he was pacing. "To think they knew anything about the detective who solves their murders... But I am not so obvious a trick."
He can only register the sight in front of him with a dizzy haze in front of his eyes, and he slowly blinks after John got off him and now roughly adjusts himself in his jeans.
Now that he had time to run his eyes over him properly, he noticed something else. This was not his first glass of champagne. It was his
"I know," John said, with the same smile he blamed on the wine. In fact, he blamed every word that continued to leave his mouth on that good Italian beverage.
“Me?” John asked, taking a step back. He was still wearing his heavy boots, his uniform. Why was he still wearing his uniform?
“Nothing. I- never mind.” John’s eyes spotted an armoire. “Oh, of course, why didn’t I think of that?” He mumbled to himself, pleased with his discovery as he opened it.
“I’ve already said everything. I’m suspended. So either you reinstate me or leave.” Watson started to walk towards his room, not caring to watch them leave, when the man spoke.
Watson couldn’t help but laugh. It’s what he loved about his team. Even in the worst situations, the most inappropriate times, they still laughed about it all. Watson took a moment to indulge in what he had chosen as his life. Yes, a somewhat solitary life, but still full of thrill. Something that made his blood pump, that made him feel alive, kept his instincts sharp. Something that made him feel useful. His eyes still on the civilians but with his attention on his adrenaline rush, it took the soldier a moment to notice a tall man in a lab coat with a mop of dark curly hair on his head move slowly toward the door on the west side wall. Instinct made Watson feint to check something on his rifle while surveying the man with his peripheral vision. Something was off. Something was definitely off. The man seemed to be using his phone, but was holding it next to the key pad. Was he trying to unlock it? Why wasn’t he just using his key card? No clearance. Then... Watson’s eyebrows shot up when the door opened and the man slipped out. He could feel his gut screaming to follow him. Before the door could close completely, he threw a big piece of desk into the opening, buying him time to follow the man. Watson looked at his team; they were still fighting back the offence. Rogers was pushing a storage cabinet, hoping to use it as cover to get closer to the target.
“It’s just a movie.” Holmes added and frowned when the entire room turned to him with wide eyes. He leaned closer to Watson. “Not good?”
Even though this wasn’t their first time, the urgency was still there, heightened by the recent life-threatening events. The feel of John’s weight was delightful, as was his lips and tongue and light thrusting.
Their guest was now frozen with stupor, her mouth slightly open until she frowned, looked from John to Sherlock and uttered. “How did you-?”
Last night was nothing compared to what Sherlock was witnessing right now. John was looking at him with such desire and yet so much restraint. Seeing the man struggle to keep control was somehow making the overall effect even more enticing. Having it displayed at such proximity was giving Sherlock a hard time to keep a coherent line of thought. John must know that he could see it, was seeing it written all over his face, and yet he wasn’t shying away. John was staring right back at him, struggling to keep his breathing under control. The sight of uninhibited desire was making Sherlock breathless and all he could think about was that all he needed to do was give one little sign. One word, that’s all it would take. How would John react if Sherlock leaned in just a little? If he tilted his head and looked at him through his lashes? How long would it take for John to close the space between them?
There was something about how Moriarty said this that sent chills down Holmes’s spine. All of a sudden, he was back in his hotel room staring at the picture of Morgan asking himself exactly the same thing he was right this moment.
Sherlock turned to him. “Quite frankly before working on character development, you should really read up on meteorology, specifically fog occurrences.”
She was also curious how the colour would look like in natural light and how long it would take for the red hue to start showing again.
“I-I’ll be right back, I need the washroom.” Holmes said as he shuffled out of the booth. He stood and hesitated, looking left and right.
Holmes stared at her and just started laughing, finding the whole situation ridiculous. Ms Adler couldn’t help but join him.
Holmes paused to look at Watson, waiting for Holmes to move to sit back down. Their eyes met, and Watson wished he could kiss him good luck.
The procedure was different then what Stamford was used to. The room was filled with movie journalists, but also the criminal investigation crowd. And instead of a table with individual microphones, all they had was a podium that Jones seemed to have decided was his personal property. He had almost seemed angry to have to move aside to let Stamford speak.
He didn't. And he doesn't now. But oh, it all seems too soon, so very soon and ages too late, and how can that even be?
over his yet untouched erection. It makes his pulse speed up and he can feel it jumping with anticipation underneath his touch.
Eurus smiled happily. She started running, running towards them, shooting left and right without looking. "The detective belongs to me, brother. You have to go!"
He was wearing a dressing gown in a creamy shade of brown, which looked expensive. Only now John noticed that he had changed his wardrobe completely since he had last seen him. His clothes were not dirty or ripped anymore, and not in a state that would ever be associated with someone who had spent the last few weeks locked up in someone else's basement. The dark trousers and the white dress shirt he was wearing clung to his skin and could not be anything but tailored.
Through several heads and faces of shock, John could see that one of the human-looking monsters tried to attack Moriarty, but he reached for the thing first, throwing it over his shoulder and from the stage. What inhuman strength! No matter who was fighting against who now, there was no way that Sherlock and John could win against this horde of bloodsuckers all by themselves. John's head snapped around to focus on Sherlock again just when one of the monsters came running towards him, teeth long and sharp. In an instant, John snatched out his gun, not hesitating for a second too long to shoot the it in the head.
Anthea was waiting for them, leaning against the wall of the building. She wore a little black hat but somehow managed to look at them from underneath it like the mysterious person she was to them.
, wouldn't he? But Sherlock being alive was still a secret. Which brought him into a situation in which the only available option was to lie. "He's, er, I fear that he's not. He's dead."
Yes, where has he heard that before? Probably from the same woman who tried to tell him what it actually is he feels for Sherlock Holmes, has opened his eyes about how deeply his affection for him was rooted, how intense those repressed feelings really were. And, still to this very day,
John cannot be sure as to what would happen next, but he would go where Sherlock leads him. Which is, for now, to a cafe to have breakfast with him.
No. No, no, no. He wasn’t allowed. It wasn’t allowed for him to touch James. It couldn’t last. They couldn’t last.
Somewhere in between he actually remembers to be unnecessarily embarrassed because John has found lube in his bedroom. Almost as if he had forgotten he is now living in a sort of parallel universe in which John Hamish Watson has one finger up his arse and still keeps going. But maybe one does tend to get a little confused under certain circumstances, even with the clever head (with fairly little blood supply and thinking capacity at the moment) of one Sherlock Holmes.
The revolver was drawing back into the arm and disappeared. Within a few seconds fingers and a palm emerged and recomposed themselves until the resulting hand was again the equivalent of his right hand.
John's smile was as sweet as it was cruel, but he could tell that he needed it, too. Damn, since when has he, really? Since when has he needed him almost as much as he needed John? Was this just another lucky twist of this unbelievable parallel world, just like the non-existent engagement and presence of Mary Morstan in their lives? Has he actually never wanted him at all, but here where the
"You're just so hot. Your voice, the sounds you make when I reduce to desperation, your body trembling beneath me,
, hit it gets closer to spilling over. But when it takes him, really takes his spine and bends it, settles in between his cheeks and crushes every muscle, every bone, settles behind his balls before it takes them, too, their fullness unbearable and everything throbs, throbs, when suddenly,
John smiles at him, and Sherlock swallows. He can't get over the feeling that he has missed something. Was it something John has said while he wasn't paying attention for a few moments? Was it a mocking smile? Mocking Sherlock for having stared at him again? Insecurity creeps up his neck and he hates himself for having being fooled by his emotions again. Hatred is also an emotion. A very, very dangerously strong emotion. John seems to notice him struggling, as his smile disappears for a second, and he adjusts himself before going for a more encouraging smile this time. It works better.
John has a hard time finding a response to this that doesn’t only consist of loose vowels. It takes him a good minute, but Sherlock is oddly patient with him.
She turned sharply to strike down an attacker from behind and began slaughtering through the masses. John did not hesitate before mounting Silverblaze and holding his hand out for Sherlock to get on behind him. But Sherlock just stared at him. He cleared his throat and looked away.
"John, what are you doing here?" Sherlock asks, meaning the whole situation, the whole odd morning and the confusing behaviour, and he hopes he could finally wake up from this dream. He just wants his defences back.
"John Watson?" the man asked, with a voice that spoke of too much smoke in his lungs and too much whiskey that had passed his throat.
"What?" For the first time since he had put it on, Magnussen's disgusting little smile fell from his pale face.
) and John enjoyed letting himself be floated away on soft, feathery notes, high as sweet howling, down again to vibrating hums, all contributing to the masterpiece of a symphony, executed by only one instrument, four strings and a bow. John thought he was hearing the piece not for the first time in his life. It sounded quite familiar to his ears, but his head could make nothing more of it.
His face turned more serious, though, and when he spoke again, his voice was lower and somehow softer, as if he was gaining more patience with him. "Yes, this is one of the conditions. The brain is the most high-functioning engine currently accessible to us. There is no machine more intelligent and more complex than a human brain. Extract it and establish new connections similar to nerve cells, there you have a whole and fully developed complex, capable of learning and independent thinking, of storing memories, ideas. Never has it been easier to recreate a human."
"So we could all make it, I see," Sherlock interrupted to get back on the track of the problem. "Then you will be glad to hear, Anderson, that I will not be the one to lend your ear to. John, your moment has arisen."
. She left the stage, but the people kept staring ahead. James Moriarty took her place behind the microphone. He was clapping. A trap.
"Sherlock? Are you?” He slowly, almost playfully, walks up behind Sherlock, letting his hands slide into the pockets of his trousers, feeling his muscular thighs trembling through the fabric.
Sherlock takes more and more of him back into his mouth, and John curses him internally with every swearword he has ever known.
"What?" He asks, a bit surprised at hearing his own voice so quiet and raspy, and that he is hearing it at all. John has said something to him, hasn't he? His lips have definitely moved, but Sherlock couldn't understand a single word he should have said.
His left shoulder felt like it had been ripped from his torso, and all the rain, all the rain, all the rain diluted the red pool of blood as he bled out on the battlefield.
"Hah!" Mrs Hudson laughed at that. "You are probably the first who listens to a story of Sherlock Holmes and try to make sense of him. Had he known you, my dear doctor..."
Irene's mouth seemed to be snapping in two, her enormous head breaking where her jaw should have been, and a tongue rolled out, as long as her body itself. From one second to the next, she threw herself down onto Eurus Moriarty. In one moment she stood there, staring up at the snake queen and in the next she was gone, gone before she could so much as scream for help that would never come. She was being devoured wholly like a snake devoured a mouse. Eurus struggled and kicked against the walls of Irene's gigantic mouth until the outline of a hand was the last thing anyone would ever see of her again.
He knew he couldn't. Sherlock had not explicitly told him not to utter a word to Mrs Hudson. He clearly cared about her, or he would not have asked if she was alright. Which meant not knowing might keep her out of the danger. Nevertheless, he was more than glad to see her. She had her back turned towards him, apparently in a conversation with someone. John tapped her on the shoulder. "Mrs Huds-"
