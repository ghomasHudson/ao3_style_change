He heard Tony’s breath stutter in his throat, heard him swallow, and then he murmured, softly, thumbs drawing soft, tender little circles on Steve’s sensitive, stinging tits, over the warm curves of his pecs, “Yeah, good boy, gorgeous guy, so sweet, you’re so sweet for me, Steve, honey.  Such a—such a good boy for me, aren’t you, handsome?”
“Yes, sir,” he said against Brock’s hot mouth, mouth rubbing wet through his stubble, because he knew it would make him hot, would make him happy.  “Just you, I understand, sir.”
in the back of Steve’s throat, the way he’d screwed up his face, shut his eyes tight—he was almost there, had to be.  He set his bare feet on the bed, put both hands on Steve’s head, running his fingers through his hair, tugging gently at the soft strands to pull Steve a little further down on his cock, softly, but just firm enough that Steve might feel it.
“Yeah,” Steve said, a throb of excitement leaping hot and hard in his chest.  The idea of the pain, of having his clamped nipples weighted and pull and painful like that, the effort it would cost him, was good enough, made him feel hot and achy and wanting down to his toes, made his cock jerk and leak, but it was more than that, it was the idea of doing it
“Hey, Tony, you’re the prettiest dame I’ve ever been with,” Steve said, smiling, rubbing his thumb over Tony’s knee as he leaned in for a kiss.  “But if you find yourself in that sort of trouble, you’d better see a specialist.”
Steve felt himself turning red again.  Tony seemed to be good at making him blush. He wasn’t sure if he was flirting with him or not, but he dismissed that thought as ridiculous.  Tony had always had a reputation as a flirt; this sort of lowkey stuff was probably second nature to him by now, something he didn’t even think about.
.  Steve wondered what Tony would make of what he’d been getting up to in his free time.  If he’d be disgusted.  If he’d heard of this kind of thing before.  Sometimes it seemed to him like Tony had heard of
“Nothing so pressing I can’t stick around,” Tony said, which was probably a lie, but Steve let himself believe it.
“No,” Steve murmured, stroking his hair, “that’s all right, that’s fine, that’s just right—just there, Tony, just angle me a, a little—”
Steve couldn’t help but smile at that.  He always felt warm and tender inside, whenever Tony called him one of those sweet little nicknames he liked so much.  He ran his hand up to the back of Tony’s neck, squeezed gently, and felt him go entirely limp, soft and easy and pliant under his hand.  “I’m good to go on?” he asked.  “How’s that feeling?”
Tony smiled at him, stroked his arm, reveling in the feel of the coarse hairs under his hand, the strong muscles and warm skin revealed by his short sleeves.  “Just like that,” he said.  “That’s just perfect.  Lovely.”  He smiled at Steve a little more, to show him that he didn’t just mean his position.  “Do you feel secure there, supported, like you have full range of motion?”
“Yeah,” Tony said, with a little chuckle, sounding fond.  “You’re gonna smell good enough to eat, Captain Cupcake.  Oh cupcake, my cupcake.”
“And here I thought you had a good imagination,” Steve said, smirking a little, and Tony shivered, smiled down at him, ran both hands through his hair, carding it back off his forehead, rubbing both thumbs against the hot skin there, along his hairline, along his temples.
“I’m going to be thinking about that next time,” Tony breathed.  “I swear.  Won’t be able to stop, stop imagining you getting your mouth on me.  God, Steve, you darling, you gorgeous, naughty thing.  You set your jaw and scowl and look all noble and no one would ever dream you were picturing going down on me.  I sure wouldn’t have ever guessed that.”  He scrubbed one hand across his face, bringing his other down to rub at the hot skin of Steve’s jaw.
“Sorry, sweetcheeks, but I thought you were with someone, too,” Brock said, and Steve flushed, because he still didn’t know what was between the two of them, Brock and him.  Brock stepped forward, ran a finger along the inside of Steve’s collar, and he took a shuddering breath.  He was about to ask if Brock would say they were together; it was right on the tip of his tongue, he could taste it on his breath.
“Yeah, you could have come, no problem,” Tony said against his temple, sounding pleased as his fingers carded through Steve’s hair, held his head close to his shoulder.  “You were right there, weren’t you?  Right there, right on the edge, just from that, just from having your sore little ass massaged and pinched and tortured, huh?  I’ll remember that for next time.  My big, sweet, needy pain slut, aren’t you, big boy?”
He bet if he’d had a vagina he’d have gotten really wet for Steve.  He wondered if Steve would have liked that.  He bet Steve ate pussy really nice.  Even if he didn’t, Tony could have taught him.  Tony knew all about it.  It’d have been like how Tony had helped Steve learn how to suck better cock, taught him all his tricks.  Tony sighed pleasurably, fondled his soft cock a little more, feeling at the sensitivity, letting Steve stroke his stomach, his sides, his thighs, watch him in the mirror.  Steve’s gaze kept focusing on his mouth, and Tony smiled, feeling pleased at that. Sexy.  Steve had really liked that lipstick, huh?
Steve moaned again, nodded, his throat working and his mouth going even wetter around Tony’s cock, moved his hand to pull clumsily at his pants, plucking at his waistband with awkward tugs for a few minutes before he, Captain America, the most graceful person on the planet, just about, seemed to remember how to link his fingers in the band and tug his pants down.  Since Steve, gorgeous thing that he was, was very visibly not wearing any underwear, that sent his big beautiful cock, hot and hard and red, thudding up against his groin and belly, sending precome all over his belly where his t-shirt had ridden up, the trail of blond hair up to his navel, up over the cotton of his shirt.  There was spit slicking down his chin, over the edge of his lips.
“I don’t know about that,” he said.  “I’m no good at any of this domesticity stuff.  But I can follow orders.”
Steve nodded, his jaw setting.  He rolled over, shifting himself back, until he was in between Tony’s legs, then scooted forward.  He put both hands on Tony’s hips this time, big and warm and heady, pressing him back gently into the pillows.  “I sure will,” he said, looking up into Tony’s face, all determined sincerity, and then he was pressing Tony’s thighs gently apart and ducking his head down.  He curved both his hands around Tony’s cock and his balls, and then took the head into his mouth again, suckling gently, wrapping his tongue around it, and then going deeper, bobbing his head up and down.
Steve stroked his hair a few moments more, then gestured at the cookies.  “Pick me out one you helped ice, huh, fella?” he asked.
Tony nodded, sucking on Steve’s thumb a little more assiduously, playing his tongue over the nail, against the pad, grateful for the weight on his tongue, the soft way Steve’s thumb pet over the top of it in Tony’s mouth, as Steve picked up the lube from beside them with his other hand, leaving Tony’s rim feeling tingling and sensitive from Steve’s earlier massaging.
“You were waiting for me,” Steve pointed out.  “I … uh. People seemed to be …” he wasn’t sure how to phrase it politely.  Diplomacy wasn’t his strong suit.  But he didn’t want to be harsh.
He heard Tony flick the faceplate down, and sure enough, when he spoke again, his voice was staticky with the armor’s vocal filter.  “There’s a good boy,” he said, and something inside of Steve went liquid and warm.  He bit the inside of his cheek and called himself an idiot even through the cold haze he was feeling.  He realized he was standing on Tony’s foot with one of his own, the better one, the way Tony used to fly him, but clumsier than ever.  Tony was basically holding him up with that arm under his rump, but still.
Honestly, she and Bucky had just signed up for this show because Steve had—he needed the money, but they didn’t really, and he was grateful for the moral support, just having them around. Everything was so different now that he’d bulked up and started winning, and he wasn’t—used to it.  The attention on him.  Coming out of practice and seeing the press outside still made his stomach flip and roil uneasily.  Having his friends around, having them with him, it helped.
“You’re so lovely,” Tony breathed, stroking his thumb over the dip of Steve’s throat in a way that made him want to tip his head back, bare his throat, helpless for him, so he did, reveling in the way Tony’s breath caught, even in the soft, sweet, hazy space he’d found himself in.  “So lovely, sweetheart, but that wasn’t an answer for me, was it?”
“You feeling ready?” Steve asked, and Tony tensed a little more, but then he relaxed again as Steve kept rubbing at the small of his back in slow, deep, easy circles.
It didn’t take all that much more time before Steve was coming, pulsing and hot and throbbing inside of Tony’s hole, filling him up with more wet heat.  He jerked his hips back and forth, rode out his orgasm, making Tony moan and shiver at the sensations that filled him, and then they just lay there, together. Steve didn’t move to pull out, and Tony still against him, just relishing the ache, the weight, of the metal around his cock, his tight, needy balls, the quiet ache and pleasure thrumming through his entire body, soft and low.  It felt even better as Steve rubbed the back of his neck, down over his shoulders, his back, slowly stroking him with both hands, tilting his head down, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead, kneading at his ass with one hand as he stroked him, big warm hands sliding over his entire body, like they were luxuriating in Tony’s skin.  “Mmm,” Steve said.  “So good. You feel so good inside.  So velvety and hot and tight, your tight little rear clamps down on me so perfect.”
“That’s right,” Tony told him, and Steve could hear in his voice that he was smiling faintly.  “I’m in charge of you right now, soldier.  I call the shots.  Be a good boy for me, all right?”
The whispering around them immediately stopped.  Stark turned to look at him, and then he stared at Steve for a moment before his eyes widened.  He dropped his leg and pulled one earbud out, looking up at Steve.
He was looking up at Steve with total adoration in his blue eyes, and he was warm and real in his arms, and trusting, and Steve just had to dip his head and kiss him again.  “Unless you had anything else you needed to do,” Steve murmured against his lips, when he finally pulled away.
“Okay,” Steve told him. He squeezed his hand on the back of Tony’s neck, knowing that it would soothe him, rubbed there gently, then pushed his head back down, to the pillow.  He could feel Tony start to relax as he did it, in his shoulders, the tremors as his muscles started to unwind.  “I hear you, mister.”  He held his hand there, firm, until he saw Tony relax all over, his muscles uncoiling, saw him go limp over the pillow under his chest, his head sag down into it, heard as well as saw his breathing even out, then moved his hand up, stroked it through Tony’s hair, keeping it soft, gentle.  Just how Tony liked it.  Tony loved to have his hair stroked, petted, just like this, Steve knew that, and he tried to give it to him as much as he could, loved watching the way Tony’s eyes fluttered closed and he’d tilt his head, lean into it, soft little breaths of pleasure escaping his lips.  “Are you still okay with a long scene?” Steve asked, reaching up and stroking his other hand over Tony’s wrist, slipping two fingers under the cuff, against his pulse, to check the fit of his cuff and reassure himself with the steady beat of Tony’s heart at the same time.
Steve smiled at that, a pleased light in his eyes even as he flushed deeply all over again.  “Yeah?” he breathed.
“I’ll try not to,” Steve promised, catching Tony’s hand in his and pressing a kiss to the palm.  He could feel Tony’s little shiver of pleasure all through his body, feel more than hear the way his breath caught, watched as he looked up through his eyelashes at Steve, Steve thought mostly unconsciously.
“Good boy,” Tony murmured again, pushing him down, pushing his knees out and down again, spreading his legs wide.  “Open up for me, all right, that’s my good boy, my good sweet pain slut, such a goddamn slut for pain he can’t help himself, right?  Can you, Rogers?”
“That’s for sure,” he breathed.  Tony was so good with his body, he’d turn himself over to Tony any day of the week.  He’d never known anyone, been with anyone, who knew his body like Tony did.  “You’re . . . you’re good with your hands.”
Steve blinked.  He felt very tired, and his chest hurt.  He couldn’t really feel his legs, but he had the impression that there was something wrong.  He took a breath, tried to remember.  His head hurt.  He’d been walking—he’d had to drag his leg, there had been blood.  He’d worried about—about bears, or wolves.  His chest had hurt.  His helmet had come off in the—there’d been a crash.  He’d—he’d fallen.  Out of the plane.  Hydra plane.  Ugh.  He didn’t want to make a habit of this.  He’d fallen and then he’d found the wreckage of the plane and they’d been dead and the radio had been dead and the experimental mind control drug they’d been carrying had all been contaminated and leaking into the soil.  Which probably wasn’t good, but it had to be injected, so Steve had figured he’d just tell people where this had happened and—once he got back to—where was he—
“I like to know that I’m pleasing you,” Steve said, meeting his eyes, all honesty, pure sincerity, and Tony was really breathless now.  “You always make me feel so damn good.  I’d like to return the favor.”
and then that that was something he would have thought Tony wouldn’t have minded too much, because, after all, from Tony’s point of view he wasn’t really needed too much, was he, and then Tony was taking off into the air, and oh, it was—cold.  It was very, very cold.  Steve held on tighter and tried not to shiver, tried to breathe evenly, tried to—to just breathe.  He didn’t have time for any of the rest of it right now.  He probably didn’t have time for any of the rest of it ever.
Steve went—somewhere else for a while, somewhere where he was hanging on with his fingernails and gritted teeth through the pain, just trying to stick it out.  He could feel himself panting, the little gasps and whimpers that he put all his energy into holding back behind his teeth, the way he was sweating, but he wasn’t aware of much else.  At some point he thought he might have heard Tony speaking into his comm—something about getting Steve off the field and back to real medical care, he was pretty sure, and he wanted to apologize to someone for having to leave them, and taking Tony with him in the process.  He was sure the others could have still used Iron Man with them.  But he was sure that if he opened his mouth he’d hurl, and he didn’t want to do that all over Tony’s armor, and everything hurt so damn much that he stayed quiet.  He wished he was at least standing for Tony to hold him up, though.  That’d have a little bit more dignity than the good old princess carry Tony had him in.  Then something jostled his arm, and Steve was aware of clenching his jaw, swallowing a—loud—sort of noise, and that was all there was for a while.
“Mmm,” Steve moaned, and then his hand was under Tony’s ass again, angling him up as he sucked at the head and then pushed himself down over his shaft again.  The sounds Tony was making sounded desperate and pathetic, whiny even in his own ears, messy and wet, his mouth damp with saliva now, too, sluttish and lewd and needy.  Steve squeezed at his ass cheek and damn if that didn’t go straight to his cock on top of all the rest, even as Steve sucked harder.  Tony hoped he realized how good this was, what Steve was doing to him, how good he was making him feel.  His head was spinning and he was clutching at Steve’s hair, his shoulder, all over again.  He needed it to steady himself, and Steve was—Steve was so steady and strong and warm, even as he rubbed at Tony’s ass, warm and soothing even as Steve’s mouth brought him higher and higher with pleasure.  He was—he was supposed to be the one leading Steve through this, though, he thought with scattered wisps of thought, and gritted his jaw, reaching for the shreds of control that was all he could manage.  But he didn’t want Steve to feel—set adrift, or anything like that.  He wanted him to feel like he was doing exactly the right thing, to please Tony, to make him feel good, to make him happy.  To make them both feel good.
Steve left the living room after that, hightailed it up to his room to put away his shield, his uniform, and wash up.  He hurried through his shower, changed into a warm soft sweater over his undershirt and his warmest pair of lounge pants, slipped into some slippers, and headed back downstairs to find Tony again.
He wasn’t sure how long it went on for—it felt like a long time, but he always lost track of time like this, when Tony was fucking him, in the perfect pushing pressure of it, the stretch and friction deep inside him, the beautiful pressure as Tony’s cockhead hit his sweet spot, pushed past it, every time, the perfect rocking motion he fell into, Tony’s hand on his hip, on his back, at the back of his neck, Tony’s warmth all around him, over him, the way it felt when he pushed in balls deep and Steve could feel the soft slap of Tony’s balls against his own.  Tony was breathless, very breathless, he always went breathless while he was the one doing the doing to, so to speak, doing the fucking, and he pressed kisses all over Steve’s shoulders, all over his spine, along his welted shoulders, against the sensitive, stinging, prickling skin, and Steve whimpered again, gasped and groaned and felt like the luckiest man alive that he had someone who knew how to give it to him like this, that he had Tony.  This was the best part, God, the best part of all.  His cock ached and throbbed, bobbing desperately between his legs, and any other time he’d have been reaching down for it, but not like this.  It was so perfectly sore, sore and painful and hot and throbbing and needy and oversensitized, and he wanted to be good, so good, so he clenched his fists against the blankets and finally let himself press his head down, his cheek down into them, breathing unsteadily and sloppily into the blankets, mouth wet and drooling.  His mouth always got wet when he was turned on, excited. Tony seemed to think it was hot, the way he’d slobber and gasp while he was being railed, but Steve hadn’t quite lost the desire to hide his face, cover his mouth somehow to hide the embarrassing wetness.
“That’s not exactly the point, mister,” Tony said, and there was an odd roughness in his laugh, in his voice, along with an odd gentleness.  “I have to give you some kind of reason not to throw yourself headlong into danger all the time.  De-incentize it somehow.”
“Yeah,” Steve breathed, both tired enough not to bother with trying to sound stronger and caught up in the feeling of Tony’s hand in his. “You should.”
“Okay, so, that’s a strong pulse, that’s good,” Tony was rambling.  “Sensors—let’s see, colder than he should be, yeah, that’s a given, shit—”  Oh, he was—he was brushing Steve’s hair back off his forehead, that was—that was really nice, too, the way his thumb slid along Steve’s hairline, gently, the way he carded the strands back.  “God, that’s a low metabolic rate—brain activity lower than normal—” he hissed between his teeth.  Steve thought,
Steve gave a little hum and pushed his cock up with his hand, laving his tongue down the shaft until it met his fingers, then dragging it back up.  Oh, oh, that was good.  Pleasure shivered through Tony, building irresistibly.  Steve’s tongue was warm, so warm and so perfect, and his grip was firm and certain.  Tony heard himself moan again, felt it in his chest, as Steve dragged his tongue up over Tony’s cockhead, swirled it around, licked up and down each side.  He was definitely taking Tony’s advice, listening to him, obediently stroking his tongue up and down each side of Tony’s cock, over the head, let it get wet and messy, licking eagerly at his tip.
He was just dried off after the bath, and he’d dabbed on a little of the light vanilla cologne that had made Steve inhale him like he wanted to eat him for breakfast the last time he’d worn it (green and fresh and a little floral over vanilla and sandalwood and musk, it was gentle and green and tender and struck him as on the androgynous side of masculine, so he’d thought it would fit), and sure enough, Steve was taking deep lungfuls of the warm sensitive skin just behind Tony’s ear. He felt vulnerable and pretty and exposed and uncertain and incredibly turned on as Steve nuzzled in behind his ear, laid a kiss there, and took another slow, deep breath, stroking the front of his thighs and making Tony squirm.
Tony blinked, swallowed, had to struggle to think clearly for what he felt were understandable reasons.  Steve’s big thumbs were resting against the inner muscles of his thighs, rubbing warm circles into the bare skin, and he felt hot and prickly all over with the awareness of his gaze, as breathless and electric as if this was his first time all over again, ridiculous for someone as experienced as he was, and considering it wasn’t even his first time with
Tony shrugged, pressed back against him, leaving another lipsticky kiss on Steve’s shoulder, feeling his warmth all along his back through delicate lace, against bare skin, his strength, and shivering with it.  Steve stroked his belly a little more, ran his fingertip against Tony’s navel, tugging at it gently until Tony was squirming under him, trying not to laugh, then reached up, still holding Tony at his hip, over the garter belt, under the skirt, and took Tony’s jaw gently in his hand, turned his jaw to press a soft kiss against his lips.  Tony found himself panting into it, twisting back to met it, letting his mouth give way soft beneath Steve’s, feeling their lips sticky, catching and sliding together with his lipstick.
“He had already been pushing it,” Natasha said, “with the partying.  The drinking.  It’s not a surprise.”
“Your jumps,” Tony said. “They’re perfect.”  He grinned.  “And here comes your coach, so let me see myself out.”  He flipped Steve another little salute and turned away.
He was already hardening in Tony’s hand, though, hot and heavy under his fingers.  “Yeah,” Tony breathed, “but you can always go again. I want you to go again, sweetheart. Honeymuffin.  Apple pie.  I got all dressed up for you.  I want you to, to use me.  Show me how much you like it, please?”
“That’s it,” Tony murmured.  “Good boy, that’s a good boy.  Yeah, you like that, huh?  You’ve been so desperate for attention to that big needy cock.  Am I right?  You’d take anything, big boy, wouldn’t you?”
But then he could see Tony, and that made it worth it.  He usually tried to keep his feelings to himself, to keep from making them obvious, tried not to show them, because he was sure Tony didn’t feel the same, but he couldn’t help his breath from catching in his throat just at the sight of Tony sitting there in some battered old chair he’d pulled up beside Steve’s hospital bed.  He had his head resting on one hand, elbow propped on the wobbly arm of the chair as he tapped at a tablet he had resting there, too, his fingers pushed into his hair, mussing it so it curled around them, tousled wildly and falling over his forehead like he’d been running his hands through it a lot.  Tony was, he noticed with some surprise, wearing a Captain America t-shirt and an old, torn pair of jeans.  He was as handsome as always—Steve always loved seeing him like this, less than put together, casual.  It always made him feel like he got to see the real Tony, behind the flash and glamour.  Steve felt something inside him go warm, something that had been knotted tightly relax, and he let out a sigh as he let himself relax into the bed.  If Tony was there, he could relax.  Tony wouldn’t be lounging there like that if they’d been captured or anything else had gone terribly wrong.
“So much better, Tony,” Steve breathed, and let Tony pull him gently in against him, rested his head against his chest, against his heart, breathed in deep of Tony’s welcome, wonderful scent, and let Tony rub his back and stroke his hair.  He felt so safe, so good.  Sure, his ribs hurt, and his leg was throbbing and sore and aching, painful and tender and itching as it healed, but he felt so, so warm, at home, so … protected, secure, like Tony was his shelter, just for him, a shelter from his pain, from stress, from the rest of the world.  Because he was home, he was with him, he was safe.  Tony would take care of him.  He was so grateful.
It did, Steve knew. The bunny fur was as soft as silk, and it really just warmed up skin, didn’t hurt at all.  “You feeling ready for more?” he asked.  He slid his fingers up over the nape of Tony’s neck, curled one of them in a soft tendril at the nape of Tony’s neck, unable to resist, feeling the slight dampness of sweat that was starting to gather there.
“Nice and spread,” Tony told him, sounding hot and breathless himself, as he sat up between Steve’s legs.  Steve looked up at him, but he couldn’t see much through his wet, blurry vision.  That was okay, it didn’t matter—he could feel Tony there, and that meant he was safe, always safe like this, with Tony.  “I love seeing you like this,” Tony said, and now his voice was soft and low, warm and fond, almost gentle.  “Spread out for me, hands cuffed and bound, cute little titties all red and bruising up, cock so hard you look like you’re gonna pop, so wet you could be a water slide, all marked up—helpless, for me, huh, Steve?  Just for me.”
He couldn’t help the thrill of excitement that admission, that request, sent through him, either. As much as he liked it slow and soft, there was something about Tony taking some of their harder implements that just—it was incredible to watch, him writhing and gasping and gripping at the blankets and sheets with both fists, mouth open on a whimpering, groaning moan as he struggled to stay still, even to push his rear out for it, to be good, as rosy, stinging welts formed dark against his olive skin.  Just to see Tony so
, Steve,” he huffed, a little hotly, but his voice was all breathy and low and cracking, too.  Steve smiled.
Hot, Steve decided.  He felt . . . hot.  His head felt hot; his skin prickled.  It seemed to take him a long time to come to that conclusion.  He could feel his nipples throbbing, his cock, the raw, marked skin over his shoulders, over his rear end.  “Hot,” he managed to slur out.
Tony’s eyes softened; something went tight around his eyes, in his face, then smoothed out, his whole face going soft and open with it, like something had fallen away, leaving him wrenched apart, his mouth open, face falling out of its handsome lines into something softer and more disjointed, just for a moment, before his playful smile was back in place and he was pressing a kiss to Steve’s lips that had him parting them, sighing softly into it, before Tony moved away, kissed his nose, his forehead, his temple, nosing into his hair and breathing in, his thumb tracing the line of Steve’s clavicle, along his collarbone.
And Tony had loved it. He’d laughed, but he’d touched his tongue to his bottom lip, bitten it, the way he did when he was actually feeling something real, his eyes had been bright, and his face had softened, in a way that told Steve he was genuinely touched, especially once he’d realized that Steve had meant it for Steve to use on, for, him, in particular.  It had been specially made for them, with white doeskin tails (the finest leather Steve had ever touched in his life; he’d made certain of it, thin enough to be gentle on Tony’s skin, light, soft as a lady’s fine glove, and almost squishy to the touch) and gold fittings, a patinaed metal handle, every inch of it crafted just to look
Tony groaned, grunted, and his face scrunched up, brow furrowing, before his eyes fluttered open.  His face was open, unguarded, sleepy-soft, mouth slack and face blank with sleep.  The lights from the tree flickered over his face in a multicolored rainbow in the dim light of the room.  Steve leaned in, pressed a kiss to his eyebrow, then to his nose, one to the line of his beard, then one to his mouth, and was rewarded by feeling it curve into a soft smile underneath him even as Tony kissed back, his mouth pursing upward into warm, wet kisses against his, Tony raising his head even as Steve pulled back to follow his lips with his, chasing Steve’s mouth with his, warm and lingering.  Steve raised his hand, pet gently along Tony’s forehead, his eyebrow, his cheekbone, as he pulled away, not moving far, staying close enough that his breath still feathered over Tony’s lips, and he could feel Tony’s own against his own wet mouth.
it made him feel vulnerable, maybe.  Maybe that was good.  Maybe he liked that.  Maybe he kept wanting more of it.  Tony wasn’t even sure.  He let his hands lift up, slip over the skirt again, up to his stomach where it was bare above his navel, watching Steve’s eyes dilate, watch him in the mirror.
“And you’re mine,” Steve mumbled, unable to put into words the fondness that welled up inside him, that made him squeeze his arms around Tony and hold him close, the gratitude and softness and how it made him feel overwhelmed that he got to have this, to the point that his throat felt thick and tight and wet stung the corners of his eyes.
“Shh, that’s it,” Steve said, softly, holding him tight, his other hand sliding up again to rub at Tony’s belly, play gently with his skirt, then tuck it in against itself and go back up to stroking his skin. “There you go; I’m deep inside you now.”
Tony blinked at him as he swung toward the side of the ice and saw him there, waiting, and an unreadable expression went over his face.  “Hello there, big boy,” he said, almost a purr, as he swung off the ice and Steve held out his arm to help steady him, but there was something uncertain in his voice, the way he tentatively gripped Steve’s arm.
His hand was big and warm and covered more than half Tony’s cock, and Tony bit his lip, let himself moan, moan and let his head tip back against the pillows.  Steve rubbed his thumb along the underside of his shaft, and Tony shivered.  His own breath sounded loud in his ears.  After a moment, when not much else happened, he lifted his head again.  Steve looked like he was concentrating, a wrinkle between his brows, his forehead creased.  Tony propped himself on the bed, reached down and ran his fingers over that crease on Steve’s brow, back up into his hair.
“Good,” Steve told him, and then reached down, curled his hand around Tony’s cock.  It always fit so perfect in his hand, hot and jerking, smoother than his own, and he rubbed at it, gentle, slow, rubbing his thumb around the tip in circles, around the edge of it, just the way Tony liked, until he gasped and came with a soft, low, broken little cry and fell back against him.
Steve kissed him for a long time, fingers rubbing at the back of his neck, combing through his hair, kissing him deep and slow and hot and soft and gentle, fingers rubbing gently inside him the whole time, against his prostate, and when he pulled back Tony felt dizzy, sweaty and damp, hair falling forward into his eyes.  He slumped against Steve’s chest, his cock really aching now as it struggled against the cage.  He whined, moaned, trembling, rocked his hips back on Steve’s fingers, forward, not even certain of what he was doing, just that Steve’s fingers felt so good, the kisses he was pressing over his cheeks felt good, and his cock hurt, wanted to get hard, desperately wanted to get hard, he
, of course you’re the best,” he said.  “I—you’re the best I could—ever—I still can’t—I can’t believe you’d even—I mean—I mean you don’t have to give me—give me silly compliments to be the best, I—oh, God.”
Even if he could have, he couldn’t have put some civilian in danger just to sate his curiosity.  And Steve hadn’t been able to think straight, not with Rumlow’s heat and energy and sturdy bulk there in his arms, pushing up against him, his dick hot against Steve’s through their trousers, and Steve found himself panting, gasping until his breath almost sobbed in his throat like he’d been running, both arms coming up to fist at the back of Rumlow’s shoulders, pulling him into Steve as he arched his back and pushed his hips up into him, the masculine smell of him and sweat and beer heady in his nose in the way he’d fantasized so much about during the war, about so many soldiers, big and sturdy and strong, pushing into him like this, body hot and hard against his, but he’d been Captain America and he couldn’t, and then Rumlow was running his hand down the muscles of Steve’s thigh through his jeans, sliding his hand around and pushing two fingers roughly down his crease, even through his jeans, against his hole, and Steve could barely feel it through the rough scratch of his jeans and the fabric of his underwear but he still almost came just at that, and he could hear the wild, almost mournful cry he let out against Rumlow’s mouth as he arched and his hips juddered helplessly.  He felt just as helpless, almost, out of control, pressing his wrists against Rumlow’s neck and gasping as his tongue swept across Steve’s mouth, pushed back into it like he was planting his flag there, biting at his lips until they felt wet and swollen and stinging.
When Tony pulled away, finally, Steve was breathless, even more so as Tony pulled away slowly, brushing hair back from Steve’s face, caressing his cheeks, his jaw, running his fingers across his lips, and the way he smiled at him—his heart throbbed in his chest, oddly painful and quick, like he was still arrhythmic, like his heart was too big for his body, too big to be contained in his ribcage.  Tony’s thumb gently traced his bottom lip.  “Sunshine,” he said, thickly, but God, no, his smile was the sunshine, leaving Steve warm, warm from the inside out, as brilliant as a spring day without a cloud in the sky.
Tony smiled a little, the expression a tiny hint of a smirk, obscure and still hard to read.  “So you decided to be my escort?”
Tony moaned.  “Yeah,” he said, hitching, breathily.  “I, um.  I. Yeah, honey, yeah, I.”  He wasn’t thinking straight, that was obvious; he was a hot flushing mess under Steve’s hand at the back of his neck, rolling his hips helplessly into Steve’s hand.
And then he came.  The pleasure crested, went hot and incandescent, radiant, perfectly, like the perfect swing into motion when Tony put his arm around his waist in the armor and Steve put his foot on his boot and they were flying, but while that was perfect and cold and clear and bracing with the wind on his face, stinging and bright, this was hot, all-consuming, nothing but pleasure, sensation, all through his body, lighting him up as he arched his back, cried out, barely aware of how hard he was shaking, of how his fingers were curling tight, fisting in Tony’s hair, of the way Tony was holding him, body supporting him, wrapped around him, the only he was really aware of how every shake, every violent shudder, made the weighted clamps on his nipples swing, ratcheted up the sensation inside of him, so perfectly intense, so painful and yet burning with pleasurable sting, that it just made him come harder and harder, made the overwhelming hot bright agonizing splendor of his orgasm go on and on and on.  He was barely aware of his dick pumping out come, hot and messy, except for when some of it splattered up over his own mouth, over his chin, and he felt so amazingly, humiliatingly debauched, so gorgeously filthy, that it just made him come harder still, and then when Tony’s hand curled over his dick, rubbed at the tip, and he felt how messy his callused fingers had gotten, covered in Steve’s wet messy spend as he rubbed at his cockhead, down his shaft, and it was just—Steve kept coming, stayed in that hot bright place for a long time, such a long time.  When he finally came down from it, he felt warm and . . . and soft, floating, the inside of his head fuzzy.  There were tears in his eyes, and his throat felt raw whenever he gasped, dragged in a heavy breath, like he’d been running, except for him to get that raw ache in his throat and chest he’d have to have been running for, for
Steve bit his lip.  His hole still felt wet, smeared against his fingers.  Come would drip out of him even if he clenched, he was sure.  He took a breath, face burning, and clenched his hole shut, stood up.  Sure enough, he felt a few droplets leak out, slip down his thighs.  Brock watched, and he could feel his eyes on him as he bent over, pulling off the soiled blankets, the sheets.  He wiped the come off his leg with one hand as he started for the laundry, and he could hear Brock laughing at him.
“I know,” Steve murmured, against Tony’s chest, against his heart, where he could feel it beating fast, feel the scars through the soft thin fabric of his t-shirt, the rabbit-quick way it pounded.  He turned his head, pressed a kiss to it through the fabric, slid one hand under Tony’s shirt and rubbed at his waist, the soft skin there.  “I know, Tony.”  Tony showed him every day, even when he didn’t say it.  Steve just had to pay attention.  To remember how Tony showed his affection, his love, all the ways he showered Steve in each little bit of attention, each gift to make his life easier.
“So good,” Steve murmured to him, still stroking his hair, all tangled and sweaty now and very, very curly under his hand, especially around the ends, at the nape of Tony’s neck. “You took that so good, Tony, so perfect.”  He massaged the back of his neck gently.  “You were beautiful, just beautiful.”
“I,” Steve said, and Tony could feel, watch him, swallow.  His voice was breathy, thick and husky with sex and need.  “I. Sure, Tony, whatever you want.”
“Tony,” Steve managed to moan.  He knew his cock was jerking, leaking desperately against his belly, but he didn’t really care about that.  There was Tony and his warm thumbs on Steve’s hot, prickling tits and the way he was talking to him, and he felt helpless and overwhelmed and soft and liquid and
“Yeah,” Tony managed on a heavy, dizzy breath.  “That’s it.  That’s just exactly it.  You look so good on my cock,
“What?” Tony said, on his feet now.  He shoved his hand back through his hair again.  “Why?  Oh.” He seemed to notice he’d dropped his tablet.  “Whatever. Steve!  You’re awake!”  He blinked, seemed to register what he’d said, and shoved his hands in his pockets, rocked back on his heels, and gave a little laugh.  “Well, that’s pretty obvious, I guess.  You knew that, anyway.  But—you just stay there—how are you feeling, huh, big guy?”
When Steve was done with the dishes, he turned around and put one arm around Tony’s shoulders, and, when he didn’t pull away, slid the other under his knees and picked him up.  He knew Tony had seen him telegraphing it when he just laughed and didn’t seem startled or pull away, just squeezed his arms around Steve’s neck.  “You big dork,” he said.
“I sure want it to,” Steve muttered, almost breathed, then smoothed his hand up over Tony’s thigh, stroked along it, and then over his hip, before he leaned in.  There was a moment of his warm breath gusting damp over the head of Tony’s cock, and then Steve closed his eyes and leaned in, opened his mouth a good few seconds before he got it around the tip of Tony’s cock.
He started with Tony’s shoulders this time, dragging the tails softly down over his back between each strike, with no force, let them tickle over the small of his back, before he’d bring it back to the other shoulder in a light thud.  Tony shivered, flinching lightly once, twice, then sighed, seemed to relax under it, all the tension going out of him.  Steve reached out, brushed his other shoulder just to check, feeling the looseness, buttery and soft, of the muscles under his fingers, then smiled to himself as Tony just sighed, shifted on one side slightly and pushed back into the touch, and then pulled his hand back, brought the soft flogger down again.  He went a little harder with it, now—he could go harder with the lamb fur anyway without damaging it, and now that Tony had relaxed, he could take some solid thump with the velvety softness over his skin.  Tony went loose under it, sinking into the pillow, hitching his knee up again, his legs spread wide.  Steve shifted so he could wrap a hand around his ankle, stroking the skin gently as he worked on his shoulders.  The flogger was easily light enough to use without worrying much about his balance or his other hand, and he liked the control of holding Tony’s ankle loosely in his own hand, the way he could feel his pulse thudding in the thin skin under the bone if he rested his thumb there.  Tony just sighed and went even more loose and relaxed under his hold.
Steve just moaned, trembling like he was shivering, his cock trembling, too, against Tony’s bottom lip, as Steve leaned forward to let it rest there, rubbing back and forth against Tony’s shiny wet mouth, rocking up and back on his feet, and his hand came down, clenching lightly but desperately in Tony’s extra-curly, fluffed up hair as he rubbed his hot cockhead up against Tony’s tongue, against his mouth.  Tony moaned to encourage him, then got both hands around the base of Steve’s cock and started to suck, bobbing his head up and down as he opened his mouth wide to fit Steve’s cock in, letting his lipstick smear over Steve’s hot, trembling skin.  Blowing Steve was never neat, always kind of a sloppy affair, and Tony had planned for that, taken into consideration how wide he had to open his mouth, smear his lips up and down Steve’s cock, open his jaw so wide he was drooling uncontrollably just to get Steve into the back of his mouth.
A moment later the spray was on, hot and filling the space with steam immediately, just how Steve liked it, almost too hot to stand it.  Tony was already turning pink, which was adorable.  Steve gave Tony an appreciative look, belatedly realizing Tony had stripped off at some point and was finally naked—the lush muscles of his strong thighs, the high, beautiful curve of his rear end, the sleek strength of his shoulders and back and chest, the way his pretty cock hung between his legs.  Tony saw him looking, because he grinned and raised his hands above his head, stretching them back and shaking his hips and rear in a way that made Steve swallow a little convulsively.
.”  Steve sank down against him, let his head settle onto Tony’s shoulder, roll into the hollow of his neck, let Tony wrap his arms around him.  Tony stroked his hands down over the vast, muscled expanse of his back, slid them down far enough to find bare skin, just a little damp with sweat and pebbled with gooseflesh now that the action was over, and rubbed his hands up and down over the bare skin, before he pulled Steve’s t-shirt down.
Tony felt like he had done that for a long time—his thighs were trembling as Steve stroked them, gently, up and down, murmuring breathless praise, rubbing at his thighs, at the backs of his knees where he knelt, up over his ass—but it was like he’d lost his sense of time, like it had ceased to matter, because it wasn’t like he was going to get hard, wasn't like he was going to come.  There was just him and Steve’s cock inside him, and Steve hadn’t come yet, that was all he knew, really.  So actually it couldn’t have been that long, because Steve never took all that long to come the first time, but it felt like a long time, and Tony’s breath was burning in his throat as he panted, when Steve cupped his hands against Tony’s ass and squeezed, stilling him on his cock.
After a moment Steve gripped Tony’s hip with his other hand, sitting back a bit, patted him, and Tony let his legs slip apart, Steve’s cock fall from between them.  Steve made a hot, needy sort of noise, nosed in against Tony’s neck, took another deep, long breath there, bit lightly at his ear, still rubbing his cock gently through the garter belt.  Tony moaned, encouraging him, rolling his hips, and Steve pressed soft, wet kisses over his neck, moved his hand away from Tony’s needy cock, making him whimper, and slipped his fingers down between his thighs, feeling where he was warm, hot, from Steve fucking between them, tugging at the garter straps, feeling at the soft lace of his stockings.  “You’re so beautiful,” he whispered again in Tony’s ear, and Tony could see him looking at them in the mirror, at his fingers playing over Tony’s thighs, against the lace of the stockings.  He ducked his head, feeling almost flustered, panting for breath. “No,” Steve insisted, his voice rough, husky, warm, and his hand came up, stroked at Tony’s belly.  “You are.”
His legs felt weak, when Tony got him up to his feet, and he leaned on Tony, let himself, let himself moan.  “I like the bed,” he said hazily.  “I can just lay here.”  Honestly he didn’t even mind the come covering him, but he knew Tony would never stand for that.  “Get me a towel or something.”
“Pretty scandalous,” Steve said cheerfully.  “I used one in those days, though.  Never wanted to get a gal pregnant.”
“I don’t know about that,” he said, laughing a little awkwardly.  “Uh.  Anyway, I thought you could join me and my friends for warm downs while we wait for the finale.”
“Good boy,” Tony breathed, his voice ragged with his own pleasure.  “Just look at you.  Dripping all over the bed, aren’t you, hon?  You get so wet.  So wet and so red.  Red all over, so damn red, look at that big red cock.  You must be feeling good.  You like the feel of my cock in your mouth, huh?”  Steve nodded at that, whining softly through his nose as he tugged more firmly at his cock, panting breathlessly.  Tony tugged at his hair lightly, stroked his fingers through it again.  “Yeah, you like that so much, don’t you,” he murmured, letting his voice go soft and fond.  “Love sucking my cock.  Bet you’d do that for me any time I asked, huh?  Go down for me under my desk while I’m on a conference call for the company and suck me down.  Let me come down your throat.  It sure would make doing paperwork more interesting, that’s for sure.  Suck me off in the quinjet after a mission.  You ever thought about that?”  He was surprised, though, when Steve flushed dark and gave a hoarse, soft little
“Hey there, fella,” Steve said, feeling his own smile widen.  His voice came out sounding husky and thick, scratchy and low.  He must have dropped off.  That hardly ever happened to him, but, well, he was tired. “Sorry for checking out on you.”
“Oh, sweetheart,” Steve murmured, feeling the endearment well up within him with the soft tug of warmth in his chest at that
“All right,” Tony said, smiling warily, brightly, as he dug in his bag and slid a pair of sunglasses over his eyes.  Steve had a sudden feeling he’d retreated behind a shield, a curtain, like a suit of armor, as he squared his shoulders, took a deep breath, and turned that stunningly bright smile on Steve.  “Let’s do this thing.”
Steve was beautiful, so beautiful, flushed and staring down at Tony, eyes soft and hot and adoring, and Tony’s mouth was open, saliva drooling down into his goatee, he couldn’t quite swallow all of it back, but he couldn’t seem to care, just working himself, rubbing himself up and down on the big heavy cock inside him, feeling it hot and thick and demanding and yet soft on his needy, clinging insides, the pleasure soft and warm inside him, building with nowhere to go, yet he couldn’t seem to care.  Steve’s hands traveled up and down his body, squeezed, kneaded at his ass, moved down and pulled his cheeks apart, rubbed at the rim of his hole where he was spread wide, rubbing in soft little coaxing circles there, and Tony just moaned, his mouth wet, and Steve said, “You’re doing good, Tony, so good, so, so good, sweetheart.  That’s it, keep riding me, working me, just like that, that’s it.  Atta boy.”  And Tony just moaned, helplessly, the warmth of the praise spreading through him, glowing all through his body, in the tight clench of his body, and worked himself even harder.
“Honey, the bed is filthy, and you’re covered in welts and oil that’s going to work into your skin, and—no, I’m getting you cleaned up.  You need a shower.”  Tony’s voice was implacable, even as he slid his arms around Steve’s waist, kissed his temple.
Steve whimpered, still coming, somehow, helplessly, messily, into Tony’s hand, and then, then, finally, he felt as Tony’s hand squeezed and his rhythm stuttered, the way he gasped and groaned out Steve’s name, and he knew Tony was coming, coming inside him, and that knowledge sent a wave of warmth, of warm, all-encompassing pleasure over him, that and the pressure of Tony’s hand on his cock coaxing another throbbing spurt of come out of him, just the thought of it so good Steve was dizzy, heaving, hot with pleasure, even more so as Tony went limp and heavy over him, panting, his hips still working, thrusting his cock inside Steve, and Steve started to feel the messy drip of Tony’s hot come along his cock, down out of his hole.  That made his cock throb in Tony’s hand again, because, God, it was everything he’d wanted.  He could barely think, especially as Tony stilled, then went flat and heavy against his back.  Steve sighed and let himself sink down, let his legs and arms slide out from under him, not caring at all about the messy smears of come wet all over his chest and pelvis and the bed itself.  Tony was stroking him idly with both hands, up over his arms, his back, his shoulders, down his sides.  His backside throbbed, prickling with sweat against raw welts, the pressure of Tony’s pelvis, his thighs.  It felt wonderful.  Steve blinked back overwhelmed wetness out of his eyes and took a long, deep breath.
Tony clasped his hand, helped him up, helped him turn over, get on his hands and knees.  The weights pulled down on his clamped tits, swaying under him, and Steve lost himself in the pulling, aching pain of it for long moments, rocking back and forth, letting them pull at him, feeling an echo in the bob of his aching, hot, untouched and needy cock in the air, so wet around the head and dripping that every movement of his hips made air touch it with a whisper of cold.  He was shuddering, lost in it, in the sensation, in his head, in his body, and then Tony slid two slick fingers down his crack, into his hole, and Steve felt himself flinch with need, with want, cry out at the sudden pressure, the penetration and sensation, not pleasure or pain, just
Objectively, Tony did think he looked … nice.  Sexy, seductive, even, all vintage androgyny in a way he’d hoped desperately would turn Steve on, and it seemed to be doing the trick.  On his own, Tony would probably have opted for jewel tones and velvety fabrics, deep and rich, but he knew Steve loved to see him in sweet delicates, soft pastels, and he—he had to admit it was different, but not bad, made him feel even more fragile and vulnerable than usual.  He’d chosen baby blue and white, colors Steve often wore himself when he dressed up like this, or chose to put on Tony, to the point where wearing them almost made him feel like, like he was showing how he was, he was Steve’s, when he put them on.  He was all soft silk and lace today, like the white lace applique babydoll he was wearing, feathering down softly over his sides, just brushing the top of the garter belt, trimmed in powder blue that matched the corset-style lacing of his garter belt down the front, with a blue silk ribbon tying it closed.  He’d matched the powder blue shade with his eyeshadow, lined his eyes carefully and coated his eyelashes thickly with mascara, even curled his hair.
Eventually, though, after a long time, when Tony’s skin was really, really warm and starting to look adorably red, Steve put down that one, too, leaned forward and put both hands on Tony’s luscious rear cheeks and squeezed.  Tony yelped, jumped, shivering, gave a tiny little choking moan as Steve rubbed his thumbs along the inside of his crease.  “Awful warm here,” Steve said, gently teasing, and Tony moaned again, gasping, squirming under him.
“Oh, hey,” Tony said, warm and soft.  His fingers carded through Steve’s hair again, and he smiled back down at him, so that it crinkled around his eyes, turned his features soft.  “There you are.”
“Spread your legs a little bit for me, babe,” Tony mumbled, curling his fingers in Steve’s hair.  “I wanna get a good view.  Want to watch you come off for me.  Roll back on your hip, show yourself off for me.”
“You’re so good,” Steve murmured, still smiling, his eyes fluttering closed as he leaned in, let their foreheads press together, gently, hands sliding up to stroke through Tony’s fluffy curls, pushing them back off his face and making Tony sigh, close his own eyes in pleasure as his fingers tugged lightly in his hair, before Steve pressed a warm, damp kiss against Tony’s smeared, swollen lips.  Tony heard, felt himself moan, arched up into it, braced himself against Steve’s sides as he leaned in against him, and when Steve pulled back, Tony felt dizzy, hot, panting, and Steve’s lips were red with his lipstick.  He smiled, reached up to rub his thumb against them.
“No, I—” Tony blew his breath out, trembled under Steve’s hands.  “I want that.  The, the, the strap. Please. I.  I do want it. Honey.”
Steve licked idly at the tip of Tony’s cock, making him shiver all over with pleasurable overstimulation, one foot kicking out helplessly in reflex against the bed, then leaned up and curled his big heavy warm muscled arm over Tony’s hip, rested his chin on it.  “I didn’t cough that time,” he said, sounding pleased with himself.  “I swallowed it all.”  He ran his fingers up the underside of Tony’s cock, a gorgeous tease that had Tony shivering all over again.  “Didn’t spit it out.”
Would Tony mark his chest, his shoulders, like he’d done his back?  Did—did this mean his cock?  More abuse to his cock?  Or did Tony have something else in mind?  Steve’s sore cock jumped, jerking, aching, and he heard the splatter of more of his precome against the floor.  He breathed heavily, excitedly, into Tony’s stomach, shut his eyes against the anticipation.  He felt so soft and slow and floaty, but the anticipation was new and hot, jumping inside him like lightning, like fire.  He knew Tony would probably focus on his—he liked his—his sensitive nipples, the size of him, his—
“Yeah,” Steve said, smiling. He reached around, deftly slipped the ribbon loose on the babydoll, opening it up and pulling it back off Tony’s shoulders.  Tony brought his arms back to help him, sighing as Steve folded it and laid it on the floor, kissed the back of his neck again.  “You really did look so pretty in that,” Steve murmured.  “Loves the way it shapes your body, so you look really kind of curvy.”
Steve’s eyes were fixed on the cage, and he was biting his bottom lip, sucking on it, rubbing his hand on the caged underside again until Tony was shuddering.  “So, so pretty, Tony,” he murmured, voice going low and deep and sex-rough and more than a little New York, and there was a flush spreading hot and red down over his face, his neck, his chest, down over his nipples, his cock already hard and bobbing, leaking so much precome it was sliding down over the shaft, the foreskin, making it glisten.  “You’re so sweet, all locked up for me, aren’t you?  So good and obedient.”  He slid his fingers, his palm, gently up and down the base, making Tony shiver, making him leak a little more wet precome.  He could see it bead up at his slit, fall slowly to splatter onto Steve’s wrist.  Steve smiled softly, licked his bottom lip.  “And you still love my hand on you so much, sweetheart,” he said.  “Just look at you, all wet.  Leaking and sweet for me.”
serving, and he’d thought—maybe he could impress Brock this time, maybe he’d learned how to give him a better blowjob—but that wasn’t what Brock wanted from his dirty mouth, of course not.  He would have wiped off his mouth, if he could, almost moved to do it, but then he felt the belt around his wrists, and of course he could have broken it, but—but he didn’t.  He didn’t want to.  He just stood there with his stinging eyes wide and his mouth dirty and hanging open and let Brock run the cool glass of the beer bottle along his hot, swollen bottom lip.
Steve nodded, rapidly, still not quite meeting his eyes.  “Yes,” he finally husked out, and then covered his face with one hand.
,” he muttered.  “You like whatever I do.  No matter how clumsy I am or—or inadequate, and then you turn around and act like you gotta be perfect for me every time.”
And Steve stroked his hair until Tony fell asleep.  If that didn’t prove he was the best, Tony thought, his last conscious thought before sleep took him, nothing would.
Tony’s hands slid down a moment later, curled around Steve’s knees, then pressed them out wide, looping his legs loosely over Tony’s own, spreading them apart and exposing him in a new way, splaying him out, his hands rubbing up and down Steve’s inner thighs again, as if to expose his hot, hard, aching cock to the room at large.  Steve caught his breath on a moan.  He was suddenly very aware, not just of his cock, but of his hole again, aware of how Tony had worked him open and to orgasm on his fingers earlier, how he was still tender there and smeared and wet with lingering lube.  By the time Tony’s fingers came back up to tug on the weighted clamps on his nipples again, to massage Steve’s tingling chest muscles, he was shivering all over already.  He wondered if Tony would make him come again.  Sometimes Steve felt a little guilty over how eager he got to come, how much he loved it, when Tony could put his own orgasms off for hours and not even seem to mind—hell, Tony
.  Everything in Steve’s body pulled tight and soft at the same time at that, hot and needy, on fire with want.
, get them wet with Steve’s own precome, and he’d—oh, God, that was so hot, that was so—he groaned, gasped, jerked up against Tony, arched his back, unable to help himself, just writhing as everything went white and bright and hot and perfect inside his head with the pure want of it, the one-two punch of hot not-quite-humiliation and the twist of desperate desire.  “Let me in, sweetheart,” Tony murmured, hot, against Steve’s neck, against his pulse, and Steve gasped, gasped and held in his breath, floating on it in that hot bright space where everything was pleasure, for just a moment before he was thinking enough to consciously relax his muscles, bear down, and Tony’s slick fingers—God, slicked up with Steve’s
.  And they scraped him inside, rough and dragging and painful, but God, it was so, so good, too, they felt so
Tony slapped at his tits a little more, and the sensation sparked through every inch of Steve, going hot and bright under his nerve endings each time, even as Tony shaped the weight of Steve’s tits with his hands and squeezed as if weighing them, bouncing them lightly in his hands and rubbing his thumbs up and down around the nipples, against the sides of them, around the clamps.  Steve shivered, felt his cock leak even more, jerking wetly, even as Tony pressed soft, humid, warm kisses down along the arch of his neck, beneath his hairline.  When he pinched at the soft underside of his pecs, Steve gasped out a harsh breath and almost came right there.  He trembled as Tony rubbed gently at those same spots with his thumbs in slow, gentle, almost thoughtful little circles, massaging the underside of Steve’s tits.  It felt so good it left him shaking, and he clutched desperately at the back of Tony’s neck, curled his fingers in his hair and turned his face inward to rest against the warm, soft, scratchy skin of Tony’s neck, feeling his own breath stuttering and heaving, and just hung on.
“Good,” Steve said again, hefting Tony’s caged cock gently, as if feeling the heavy weight against his palm, and Tony felt himself go warm, a tingling twinge of warm humiliation twisting hot and tight in his stomach at the thought that it was probably much heavier, much more present, than Steve was used to feeling with his cock most of the time.  (He wondered if Steve would like it if Tony fucked him with it on.  Maybe he’d ask, later in the week, since they’d agreed on a week with Tony in chastity, this time, and this was only the first day.) “Let me know if it’s not, even for a few seconds, okay?” Steve murmured, rubbing gently at the metal over the base of Tony’s cock.
nice.”  He leaned down, kissed him, gently, enjoying Tony’s soft little moan, the way he arched up into it, all eager, giving and sweet, tasting like sugar and spice and chocolate.  “And trust me,” he added in a whisper against his lips, “the old in and out?  That’s a sure thing.  Tomorrow morning.  That can be your first Christmas present.”
“So I don’t want you walking on it,” Tony said, firmly.  Was Tony really—really here? Steve found himself wondering again.  “I’m gonna get you on your feet, and I’m gonna fly you back to a nice warm quinjet, okay?  And then you’re, uh, you’re going to rest a little while I make some repairs to the stealth system, and then I’ll . . . figure out where to meet up with the itsy bitsy spider I mentioned, and we’ll get you all safe and sorted out.”
“I,” Steve said, with all the distinct diction and firmness he could manage right then, “wanted it.  The welts.  I wanted them.”
,” scratchy and wavering and a low, harsh groan right out of his lungs, out of the very depths of his chest.
, how he turned into a wounded, snarling bear who lashed out at the people who cared about him the most, but he didn’t want to do that this time.  He really did intend to do his best, try to be patient, let Tony tell him what to do for a few days.  Well, maybe one day.  Tonight and tomorrow morning, maybe.
Tony’s smile was still a little strange, but something relaxed around his eyes.  “Same goes for you,” he said.  “Knock ‘em dead, Steve.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve called out after him.  He grabbed one of the little bears off the top of the pile in his arms, and tossed it toward him in a slow loop.  Tony caught it easily, looking startled.  “You can keep it,” Steve said, and knew he was blushing again.
“Mmm,” Tony said, closing his mouth and clearly savoring it, swallowing, rocking his hips and letting his eyes slip closed, his head fall back, in a way that reminded Steve very, very vividly of how he looked in other situations.  His cheeks were even slightly, visibly flushed.  “You’re good to me, babe,” he murmured.
Steve was still in that same pleasant haze as Tony coaxed him back up to his feet, rubbing his thumb along his mouth as he did, his bottom lip, crooking it gently between them for just a few moments, rinsed off his backside, his buttocks, nudged Steve into gripping the sore skin with a gasp and spreading himself so Tony could rinse off his crack, into the sensitive skin of his hole, rubbing at him with two fingers, opening him on them just enough that Tony could push them inside and rinse him out a little, spreading the water inside with his fingers and not the spray itself, murmuring softly to him all the while, praising him, until the very humiliation of the cleaning had Steve feeling even more dizzy and good, hazy and bright and wonderful.
“I do want, fella,” Tony said, smiling.  “Don’t think less of me, all right?  I’m just doing this because you’re my steady.”  He let the skirt fall back over his garter belt, then fell to his knees, turning around so his back was to the mirror, hopefully giving Steve a nice view of his backside as he slid his hands up Steve’s bare, powerful, hot flushed thighs and closed them in his briefs, pulling them down to Steve’s knees in one gentle yank.  Steve’s dick sprang free, already hot and flushed and drooling, foreskin partly retracted to reveal the pretty head, flushed pink and slickly, shiny wet with precome.  Tony stuck his tongue out, leaned forward to lick at it, drag his tongue over it, slide it around the sensitive hot wet skin, so hot on his tongue, slurping and curling it wetly like he was licking frosting up off of it.  He knew it had to look amazingly lewd, sexual, between his cherry-red lips, and also knew that Steve was incredibly visual when it came to sex, so he wasn’t surprised when Steve sucked in his breath like he’d been shot, his abdominal muscles clenching, fluttering, and his cock jumped under Tony’s tongue, leaking soft needy spurts of precome against it. “Mmm,” Tony said, and licked it up. He rubbed at Steve’s thighs, up over his belly, and then leaned down, taking that big, blunt, wet, hot cockhead into his mouth.
But even then, when the black despair lifted a little, and he felt more like himself, he felt better.  Lighter.  And—maybe like he’d be able to figure things out in this new time after all.
red, baby.  So, so red.  Like the strawberries on top of your cupcake tits.  Or maybe maraschino cherries.  Prettiest flush I’ve ever seen.”
, with a vengeance, even as it made something inside him go soft and hot all over again, his mind relax into that strange slow, hot space it got when he was like this.
“Oh, Steve, darling,” Tony whispered.  His face, the back of his neck felt hot.  His skin felt tight all over his body.  “My God.  This is—this is good.  You’re doing—doing really well.  Doing beautifully, sweetheart.”
“If it was,” Steve said, feeling himself melting into the couch as he relaxed, “I’m all yours, Shellhead.  All yours.”
Tony let out a quiet little sob, trembling against Steve’s shoulder, his body gone all limp and soft.
“I hardly did anything,” he muttered, mostly under his breath, but Tony must have caught it, because he gave him one hell of a look.
“That’s it,” Tony panted, petting his fingers through Steve’s hair as his throat worked and he let Tony’s length slide messily and wetly out of his mouth again to lick around the head.  “That’s it, God, does that feel good?  How’s your hand feel on your cock, huh, honeybunch?  That feel good?”
A firm, callused palm cupped his cheek, and Steve gave a heavy breath through his mouth, a dizzy, needy puff of air.  Tony was there kneeling in front of him a moment later, his palm sliding gently along Steve’s shoulder, cupping it where it was raw, then both hands dropping to Steve’s knees, sliding up along Steve’s thighs.  He shivered.  He could feel his cock jerk, bobbing wet and needy between them, precome dripping off of it to splat on the floor, just at feeling Tony’s thumbs traveling up the insides of his thighs, warm and knowing.  He wanted to be good, but even with that he could feel the muscles in his arms, in his shoulders, bunching and straining as he pulled at the titanium magnetic cuffs thick and heavy around his wrists.  He was so grateful that Tony had made them so strong, so strong that even if he was disobedient and bad and let himself pull he wouldn’t break them, they wouldn’t come loose.
.”  Another cruel yank to the sensitive peak that had Steve letting out a broken sounding groan that was damn close to a sob.  It
Steve shrugged.  “Thought about it a lot,” he said hoarsely, blunt and honest as ever.  “Even before we started this.  How you’d—you’d put your hands on my head, let me use my mouth on you, come all over my tongue, down my throat so I could taste it.”  Tony heard himself groan, whimpered, thrust up against Steve’s mouth despite himself until Steve grabbed his cock, thumb sliding up along the side and gently rubbing up along the tip, and Tony fell back into the bed with a low huff of breath, let himself melt back against the pillows.  Steve smiled a little, still stroking Tony’s hot, wet cock with his thumb, making him tremble at the low level of pleasure that sent shivering through him, somehow just as affecting as the more intense, white-hot pleasure of Steve’s mouth on him, but in an entirely different way, leaving him boneless, head sinking into the pillows and his legs sprawled wide.  “So you’ll just have to deal with it, Stark,” Steve added.
He’d called into Stark International before he left SHIELD and had been assured that Tony had already left—Steve sure hoped so, it was eleven thirty at night—so he was figuring Tony would be there in the mansion somewhere.  He’d told Steve he still had “Christmas stuff” to work on and presents to “rig up,” so Steve wondered if he was in his workshop, even at this hour, rather than on this floor at all.
God, it had been a good night.  And it was going to be a good rest of the night, too—Tony didn’t need to be a genius to figure that one out, with Steve’s big hands in his hair, rubbing at the back of his neck, and his tongue in his mouth, and his body warm all the way down against Tony’s.  A good night for both of them.  What more could he ask for?
, because he did the same thing again, stroking and tugging gently at Tony’s balls all the while, and oh, there was no way Tony was going to last.  Steve’s mouth was wet and so, so hot, and his hand was warm on Tony’s cock, on his balls, his breath turning the place between Tony’s thighs humid and damp and hot, and everything felt so good.  Tony knew he was babbling, but he had no idea what he said, other than a vague concept that it had all been praise for Steve, how good he felt and how perfect he was, because that was the only thing he was thinking about, the only thought in his head other than the pleasure of it all, how
Wait.  There was something.  Steve squinted at the sky beyond Tony.  It seemed very light, even though it had to be late in the day from the shadows.  It was snowing, he realized.  “The Accords,” he finally managed.  “You weren’t—you can’t have been authorized to come and, and extract me.”  Rescue him?  But rescue was—was a big word.  A
Steve held him open, then, kneading gently at his ass, and then his hand was there, helping to position himself, nudge his hot, blunt, searing cockhead along Tony’s crack with his fingers, and then he was pushing in, deep and slow, centering himself with his hand curved against his own cock, sucking gentle kisses against Tony’s neck, up and over his jaw, as he did.
Tony’s voice was wavering, low and rough, when it came again.  “God, you’re so good,” he said.  “Yeah, just like that.
himself bruise, then pushed Steve back, put one hand on his chin and tilted his head back until his back was arching, presenting his sore, throbbing
—lasted until Steve got back to his own place, and then, as the door closed behind him, he sagged back against it, closed his eyes.
Tony pulled down a little nervously on the front of the filmy lace skirt he wore over his panties and garter belt, smoothing it out with careful fingers, looking at himself critically in the mirror.  He wasn’t sure why getting dressed up like this always seemed to make him feel so—so fragile, vulnerable and exposed and open to Steve in a way he didn’t feel even naked in front of him, and certainly didn’t feel in the silky lacy panties he wore every day under his suits, even when Steve was running his fingers over them, touching Tony’s cock through them, even pressing his face to Tony’s hip, rubbing his cheek softly against the fine lace, against Tony’s cock through it, breathing out in apparent wonderment, long and deep like bliss, the way he did sometimes.
, where all he could do was gasp and moan and pant against Tony’s skin, rolling his hips helplessly as his cock jerked and pain washed through him beautifully, pleasurably, like fire from his buttocks.  He was so, so close to coming, his cock throbbing, could feel his balls hot and hard and high and tight, tightening every time Tony pinched his rear or slapped it lightly.  Tony ignored Steve’s hole just as much as he did his cock, but Steve could still
Tony was scheduled to go on the ice after Steve, so Steve figured he’d still be warming up.  He was concentrating so hard on his choreography—and getting it
Steve gave a low whine through his nose, and one hand slid down almost instantly, gripped at his cock through his soft pants, then he moaned again, mouth going even sloppier and wetter over Tony’s, loose as he moaned over his cock, rubbed his mouth against it messily, sloppy-wet in a way that had Tony’s heart thumping with want.  A moment later Steve slid his hand down his pants just as Tony had instructed, and his mouth went even wetter and looser, wide open and wet and drooling as he just panted around Tony’s cock.
Steve gave a little gasping whimper of a noise, followed with a little moan, his hand clutching at Tony’s thigh as he dragged his hand up again, rubbed his thumb over his slit, making a smeared mess of his thick wet cockhead.
,” Steve said insistently, searching out Tony’s face and blinking until his eyes were clear, fixing them on Tony’s.  His tongue felt thick and his lips slow and stupid, but he didn’t want Tony feeling any doubt, wondering at all, about how much he had enjoyed it.  It barely even hurt, and the way it did, the sting, the sensitivity, it was
“God, you’re so good,” Tony moaned, mouth hot and wet against Steve’s spine.  “So, so good, sugar, yeah, God, you’re sweet, those inner muscles, the way you clench up on my cock, God, the way you work me, damn, peak human is right, but no, I bet it’s just you, isn’t it, Steve, you’d clench up on me, work me like that, no matter what, serum or no serum, wouldn’t you, you’d work as hard as you could to do it, because you just want to make me feel good that badly, huh, sweetie-pie, huh, peaches?”
Tony’s fingers squeezed at his nipples again, and Steve twitched under his hands despite himself, moaning, even as Tony’s hands came up to brush touches against Steve’s elbows, up and down his arms, down over the underside of his biceps, dropped to trace gently over the insides of his thighs as Steve caught his breath on another gasp.  Tony’s face felt warm against his neck as he murmured, “There, I’ve gotcha, big fella,” and pressed a kiss there, wet and soft just under Steve’s hairline, another behind his ear.  “I’ve gotcha, sweetheart.”  His fingers slid back down, over Steve’s collarbone, tracing it gently, Tony’s thumb circling in a slow pattern over his skin, before his fingertips feathered down over Steve’s pectorals, making him hiss a breath, suck back his own saliva again and bite down on his bottom lip against a moan as Tony’s fingers teased fresh sensation out of the hot, prickling, sensitized skin.  Steve felt so warm, so warm all over, even as his shoulders and rear end prickled and his cock ached, even hotter than the rest of his body, his nipples throbbing and hot and tender and almost numb.  Tony tugged at the weights, teased at the clamps, at Steve’s nipples.  “I bet when I pull these off, you’re gonna come,” he murmured, and bit lightly at Steve’s ear in a way that made him give a helpless wavering breath that was more than half a moan, tilt his head back against Tony’s shoulder as his eyes slipped closed.  He rubbed his fingers into Tony’s hair, massaged them gently into the springy, curling strands, rolled his cheek against Tony’s shoulder.
“Good boy,” Tony breathed, so he could watch Steve squirm, duck his head, whimper and push his hips down into the bed, thrusting jerkily, almost awkward, like his skin was suddenly too tight for his body.  He stroked his hand back through Steve’s hair again, over the back of his skull.  “Good, good boy.  Yeah, you like that, huh?  You’re so good at it, sweet thing.  So good at sucking cock.  A natural.”
“Promise,” he said, and so Steve let himself fall into the soft nest of pillows and blankets that covered the sofa-turned-bed, grab a pillow and curl himself around it.  He could feel the shivers starting, now that Tony wasn’t there to touch him, but the blankets were warm and soft on sensitive skin, and the pillow in his arms was anchoring, and it all smelled like Tony, so he was still hazy sweet when Tony slid behind him and put his hand on his arm, pulling Steve back enough that he twisted around and smiled up at him, and Tony smiled back and kissed him, lightly.  “Promised I wouldn’t be long,” he said.
“Oh, you sweetheart,” Tony whispered.  “How the hell did I get so lucky with you, huh?  I’m so lucky you—you want to—” he had to break off, overcome, feeling his throat close up stupidly, his eyes sting.
“I hear you,” Tony said, a soft, fond smile curving one side of his mouth, lopsided and rueful and warmly tender, as he pulled back, and Steve had to catch his breath, it sent so much emotion through him, pulling tight in his stomach, surging in his breast.  “So,” he said then, still squeezing at Steve’s nipples, stroking and rubbing them like they were the controls to some advanced plane or computer readout or something until Steve was trembling all over, groaning on each breath, shivering down to his toes.  “How do you feel about clamps, stud?”
They kissed, breathless and soft, and then Steve pulled away, stroked his jaw some more.  “I want you to do something for me,” he said, and Tony nodded.
He was rewarded with Tony’s face, the way it lit up, transported with the praise, the way he bent his head, buried it in Steve’s shoulder, chest heaving.
Tony smiled again, leaned in and pressed a kiss to Steve’s eyebrow.  “Yeah,” he breathed, and his breath felt cool against Steve’s hot skin, the sweat gathering there.  “Give me a color, sunshine.  How do you feel?”
“Oh, good,” Steve said, breathing out a long sigh of relief, reaching up and brushing tangled curls off Tony’s forehead.
“Tony?  Babe?”  There was no answer.  Steve ducked into the mansion’s living room (the more casual one where the Avengers actually spent most of their time) from the hallway to see the giant Christmas tree he and Thor had hauled back (with most of the others watching and a few unhelpfully pelting them with snowballs until Tony had put a stop to that), all sparkling with ornaments and lights, pushing back his cowl as he did.  The house felt quiet, and most of the lights were off.  Most of the others were probably asleep already.
“Oh, jeez, sorry,” Steve said, and his voice sounded very hoarse and rough, low and whispery.  It seemed like an awful effort to make much sound at all.  He started to sit up on instinct, as if there was any possible way to pick it up for Tony—it was just a reflex.  The reflexive movement made him realize that his arm had been firmly immobilized—no wonder it felt like he couldn’t move it all.
“Hey,” Steve said, firmly, and tilted Tony’s chin up.  “Any time,” he said, soft and sincere.  “Any time.”
“Uh, no,” Tony said.  “I mean, I, uh, God, I sure hope you’re gonna be fine, buddy, but you’re not going right back to the fight.  You broke your arm, hotshot.”
“Honey,” Tony said, and his voice was husky and thick.  He held Steve’s face for a moment, stroked the side of it, ran his thumb over Steve’s nose, along his wet lips, then tilted his mouth closed and pressed a gentle little kiss to it, one that made Steve’s breath catch in his throat and his stomach go liquid and soft and hot, before he reached up for something Steve didn’t bother turning to look and see.  Tony had said—Tony had said weights.  Steve lay there, trying to catch his breath, moaning a little despite himself, biting his bottom lip, sucking on it, until Tony came back, and oh, he
“Th-thanks,” Tony gasped. His mouth felt very wet, saliva prickling in it as he kept licking at the mirror.  His head was spinning.  It was true that he’d chosen almost his most delicate, pretty pair of panties for this, soft silky lace in delicate patterns.  He was just glad Steve liked them as much as he’d hoped he would.
“Yes, for you,” Steve agreed, his mouth slow and heavy, as he leaned forward without opening his eyes, let his face rest against Tony’s, his mouth soft against the side of his neck.  He could feel Tony swallowing, convulsively, the way he moved his face in against Steve’s to brush his lips over his cheek again in the barest brush of a kiss.
sucking on—only vaguely aware of the backs of his knees hitting a bed.  And then he was down on it, his body knowing what to do even when his mind was a floaty mess, underneath Tony, arms bound under his body, against the small of his back, chest heaving, Tony’s leg between his thighs, pressing them out until they were spread, then spread wider, Steve’s ankles hanging loosely off the edges of the bed.  Steve whimpered, bucked and squirmed despite himself, the marks on his back and buttocks burning, hot against the softness of the bed, the scratch of the covers, hot and bright and wonderful, scratchy and sharp with pain, and Tony patted his thigh, kissed the throbbing ache of his bruising areola with soft lips that felt almost gentle, almost soothing, and called him good, good boy, such a good boy.  There were tears sheening Steve’s eyes by that point, good tears.  His cock felt so hard and so hot and so wet.  It was drooling liquid into his bellybutton.  He felt every inch of the pain slut Tony had called him.  He was panting.  It was perfect.
“Are you ready for me to get started?” he asked.  His own dick was already aching, rubbing against his briefs.  He could feel the wet spot where the head was leaking precome already.  This always turned him on, even as it made him worry, take deep breaths to try to prepare himself, ready himself, be the best he could be for Tony, all that the same time.
Tony laughed and dragged a finger down the center of Steve’s chest, flicked it gently in the wet little pool Steve’s precome had made on the inward dip of his belly.  “I don’t know, big fella,” he said.  “You leak like a faucet someone’s broken in half.  So sweet and so wet.  I could slick you up with your own precome; who needs lube with you, huh?”
Hadn’t it been?  Steve forced himself to think, not just respond, even though his thoughts felt hazy and thick, soft and slow.  “More, Tony,” he said finally, hazily.  “Sir.  Please.”
“You touched me a little,” Steve said.  “You stepped on me with your shoe.  You touched me at the end.”  He rolled onto his side just enough to prop his eyes open, look up at Tony and smile.  “It was good, Tony,” he managed to mumble.  “I liked it.”
Tony’s words echoed in Steve’s head as he turned off his motorcycle, and he sat there, just for a second.
The first time he hadn’t even taken Steve’s clothes off, just unbuckled his belt, pulled it off and tossed it aside, then fisted his hand in Steve’s shirt, at the back of his neck and dragged his jeans and underwear down around his knees.  Steve heard him undo his own belt and shove down his pants, and then he was rubbing the blazing heat of his cock, wet and messy and smelling of sex musk, along the bare flesh between the curve of Steve’s rear cheeks, and Steve shivered all the way down to his toes, down into his core, and his mind just went—blank, blank with desire, with want, with how he felt used, degraded, messy, nothing like Captain America should be at all.  He could feel his mouth wet, drooling into the bedspread, his mouth hanging open, even as he panted for breath.
“I know,” Steve murmured, soft, left his hand flat on Tony’s belly, feeling the slight softness over the muscle, letting the warmth of his palm bleed through Tony’s soft t-shirt. “I always know, Tony, sweetheart.” It wasn’t exactly true; sometimes he forgot, to his own shame, took Tony for granted, his sweet, careful way of caring, the little details that showed his love and care, and his generous nature, but in the back of his mind, he felt that certainty, that—reassuring knowledge, that Tony cared for him, that Tony would reach out and take care of him if he faltered or stumbled or began to fall.
“Shh,” Steve told him, his chest twinging with that soft, warm, tender ache again.  He rubbed at Tony’s neck, nuzzled in against the side of his head, pressed a kiss to his ear, his temple.  “Shh, you were.  You were just perfect.  Do you want to come, sweetheart?”  He used his other hand, felt down Tony’s side, the front of his body, until he could close his hand gently around Tony’s cock.  “You want to come, beautiful?” he asked, practically whispering now, lips feeling damp against Tony’s sweaty temple, smearing wet against his skin.
“You came so beautifully for me,” Tony said immediately, warmly, and Steve flushed, ducked his head down, but he also smiled, enough that his eyes crinkled up.  Tony rubbed at those little eye crinkles gently with one finger, then slid it up over Steve’s eyebrow.  “Gorgeous,” he said.  “You’re so gorgeous when you come, handsome.  I love seeing you overcome with pleasure, just lost in it, giving yourself over to something so good.”  He stroked his hand back through Steve’s hair.  “Did that feel good?”
“Hey, honey, hey, look at me, huh?” Gentle but insistent fingers on his jaw, tilting his head up. Tony’s voice was demanding, pushing into Steve’s consciousness, sweeping over his skin like a prickling touch. Steve blinked stars out of his vision, took a breath. “How are you feeling?” Tony asked. His eyes were soft, deep blue like the ocean, but safe and warm, not like drowning, not like ice. He was smiling down at Steve, and it was crooked, sweet, so sweet it made Steve’s stomach clench and twist tight with feeling, something in his chest twinge and throb, even on top of how it felt to be kneeling naked at Tony’s feet, Tony still fully dressed, or nearly, looking only a little rumpled in his waistcoat and rolled up shirtsleeves, even if Tony’s fingers were sweaty and damp on Steve’s sweaty skin, just as hot as Steve’s flush.  He hadn’t even taken off his expensive polished shoes.
“Okay, big guy,” Tony murmured.  “Yeah, you kneel for me, huh?  That’s it.”  He smiled so softly there was no sting in it at all, nothing demeaning, when he said, “Love you on your knees, my big piece of apple pie.  You’re so sweet.”
. “I’ve gotcha.”  He ran his hand down over Tony’s shoulders again, down over the slope of his back, very damp and sweaty now, and squeezed one still rosy pink curve of his rear, before he took a step back, teased the tails of the flogger up over Tony’s leg, then tossed them back again and started on Tony’s rear and thighs.
“That’s it, that’s just perfect,” he managed to assure him, panting.  “That’s wonderful.  Just keep that up, with—with your tongue for a while, yeah.”
for someone else’s hand, someone else to show him what it would really feel like, and where else was he going to find that?  When else was he ever going to find out?  Sure, maybe it was—was more acceptable these days, for a man to want to take it in the rear, but it wasn’t like Captain America could just go out to a bar and try to make it with a fella even now.
The thing was, Steve wasn’t always that patient in bed, but when it came to fucking like this, he’d perfected the art of going slow.  It always felt like it took a long time for Tony to come from anal, even with a hand on his cock, but Steve just held him steady and kept up a constant pace, stroking Tony’s cock gently the whole time.  Tony couldn’t seem to do anything but feel—the constant warm strokes and gentle friction against his cock, the way Steve knew just how to rub his thumb over the head, stroke him down the shaft, rub at the base of it, and always the pressure and throbbing, sweet pleasure inside of him at the same time, until all Tony could do was to buck up away from that intense building sweet, hot heat inside him, then push himself back down into it again, desperately seeking it.  Steve was patient, seemed focused on making Tony feel good, slowly working him up, building that pleasure with his pulls on Tony’s cock, the constant pleasure on his prostate.
Tony was moaning softly but regularly by the time that Steve stopped, laid the flogger down, and reached up to run his hand gently over the now very warm skin of his shoulders, make Tony gasp and squirm under him, just a little.  “How was that, fella?” Steve asked.
Steve gave a little humming noise of acknowledgment, tugged gently at Tony’s cock with his hand, stroking as he sucked on his tip, wet and messy, slid his tongue over the head again, letting his tongue go sloppy and wet and warm before he sucked again, then slid his tongue up against the slit, just like Tony had suggested.  And oh, God, that felt so good, the way he lapped at him, fucked at him gently with his tongue, then slid his tongue up over the top, once, twice, then swirled it around, lapped at the underside, playing his tongue right where Tony was most sensitive, until Tony was really whimpering, thighs flexing helplessly as he tossed his head back against the pillows.
It was hard to think about anything else once he was under the water.  It beat down on his shoulders and chest and rear with a kind of burning intensity, flaring all his soreness and raw skin into immediate, throbbing pain, but a kind of pain that felt good, cleansing and perfect.  He wavered, gasped, must have, because Tony pressed another kiss to his temple, to the side of his mouth where it hung open, wet and slack, even as his hands came up to slide gently over Steve’s shoulders, and he murmured, “I’ve gotcha, stud, I’ve gotcha."
, Steve thought, still a little painfully, men sometimes dated other fellas now, out in the open and everything—he wanted to, but who had a wonderful relationship with Ms. Potts, where they had date night together every Saturday, and half the time it seemed to be just staying in and having dinner together and . . . .  And it was wrong to be jealous of what they had, Steve told himself, firmly.  At least, of course everyone wanted that, a relationship like that, or he figured they did (he definitely did), but it was wrong to be jealous of it in the way—the way he was.
, he wanted to ask.  He just wanted it to feel good for him.  Tony was finally letting himself take his own pleasure from him, and that was all Steve wanted to be, the vehicle for that pleasure.  Yeah.  That was what he wanted.
“Takes one to know one,” Tony responded, and rubbed one lotion-y finger on Steve’s nose, then slid his lotion covered hand down the front of Steve’s throat, wiping off the excess and making Steve shiver all over at the sensation as Tony rubbed it in.  “Mmm,” Tony said, throatily husky, clearly reading the expression on Steve’s face.  “Now that’s better.  Warming up, huh, stud?”
“I’ve always liked lingerie,” Tony said, but—well, it was true; Steve wasn’t wrong.  He wore panties all the time, they made him feel good, but playing it up like this, well, it sometimes made him feel self-conscious, embarrassed.  And not in the good, twisting, hot sort of way, necessarily.  Sometimes it made him feel—uncertain, strange, a little bit insecure in his masculinity.  He’d been a pretty boy.  One reason he’d first grown the mustache was to look more, well, manly.
“You better,” Brock grunted, his hand rubbing against Steve’s erection through his briefs, all rough knuckles and rougher palm, until Steve could feel himself leaking, feel his sensitive tip catching on the fabric and rubbing until it hurt, until it burned, and Brock just rubbed him harder.
“Aww, yeah, that’s it,” Brock said from behind him, and Steve could feel the slick sound of him palming himself for a moment before the weight of his cock came slapping down on his rear cheek again, leaving a damp, hot trail.  “Should’ve known you’d be a slut for it, huh, Cap?  Got it written all over you.”
“Anything you want,” Steve said, dreamily, still smiling up at him.  Tony was the best thing, he thought.  The best, most wonderful thing he’d ever seen.  “Anything at all.”
“Shower?  Maybe later,” Brock said, grinning at him.  He tucked his dick away, zipped himself up, and Steve felt very aware of the cock lying loose and limp against his own thigh.  “Strip the bed and put the sheets in the wash, first.”
“That’s me, big fella, I gotcha, I’m right here,” Tony murmured against his temple, mouth soft and wet and warm, and Steve shuddered down to his toes.  Tony squeezed his thighs, kissed his cheek, his shoulder, and Steve felt so . . . hot, he was floating, Tony was right there, and he was, he was safe, he felt so good.  Tony’s hands were grounding, firm and callused on his thighs.  His head felt loose on his neck, lolled against Tony’s shoulder.  One of Tony’s hands came up, squeezed at the back of Steve’s neck, holding his head, stroking through his short hair, but the other stayed, firm and grounding, on his thigh.  “Now how are you feeling, honey pie?”
Tony moaned, now, and twisted against the bed, rubbing his hips inward, rocking his chest down against the pillow, trembling, his shoulders pulling tight, then relaxing again, as he buried his face in it, panting.  Steve dragged his hand slowly over Tony’s warm, hot buttock, already starting to show the mark of his hand, a slow, heavy caress, stroked his hand back and forth, until Tony’s breath was coming deep and unsteady in his throat, then hauled back his hand again and gave Tony a nice hard swat on the other cheek, made him gasp, buck up, one hand tightening in the covers as his breath hitched. He could feel the tight muscle as it smacked into his hand, the slight bounce of the round, sweet layer of flesh Tony carried on his rear, the way it fit just into his palm, pressed down with his thumb, digging in, dragging it down until Tony was shivering, groaning, then squeezed and smacked him again.
