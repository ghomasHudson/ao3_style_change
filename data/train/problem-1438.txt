“How’d you get that?” I asked.  “Wait.  Never mind.  Two seconds looking at Swann’s résumé on LinkedIn made you that sure the goods would be stashed down there?”
The lioness rolled back onto her feet, shook her head and let the branch in her mouth fly.  Baskerville hurtled after it and brought it back, laying it at the lioness's feet.  She tossed it again.
“Zoologists sometimes wait months to catch elusive species on film.”
“The woods aren’t burning?”
A flutter of notes came from the flute, but then I heard a clarinet, an oboe and then a bassoon.  I squinted in hopes of discerning if others had joined the four I had seen playing earlier, but their candles were half-covered to light their scores and not their faces.  The violinist tuned his strings, a second joined him and then a third.  The music didn’t sound like it was going to be simple.
“So, these were here last year, but I couldn’t see them or…”  I waved my hand about again.  “…feel them.”
Sherlock shook his head and started to fall backwards.
I walked to his other side and placed my hands so they would support the violin as I might an infant.  He loosened his fingers and I eased the instrument away, laid it to rest in the case as well.
“Not that one,” I protested hastily and despite the fire having burnt low in the grate, the late winter’s morning felt very warm indeed.
“But then you would have missed the looks of awe on everyone’s faces.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “I doubt it,” he grumbled, but he read Greg’s text and set the book aside.
“I’ll only be a moment,” she promised, sliding away.  She looked over her shoulder as she walked towards the ladies.  She smiled when she saw he was watching.
I smiled.  It felt like coming home.
The vision persisted.
“I’m not sure Jim’s ever been interested in me physically…”
John shrugged his left shoulder until his dressing gown fell down the arm.  He twisted and bent it until it was free of the cloth.  He stretched the bare forearm next to the hand where the butterfly lay, wings flattened, antennae drooped.
“Show me your true shape,” John said, sitting and leaning back until he was flat on the bed.  He set his finger on his cheek.
“Oh, I don’t know about that,” I said.
“It’ll be a surprise,” she said, stacking everything up on the tray and whisking it out the door much faster than I would have thought someone with a bad hip could have managed.  “Won’t be two ticks.”
The sky grew pale.  The green smoke wafted higher and higher chasing after the last stars until it finally faded away.
“Were witches ever burned here?” I asked.
I latched the doors firmly.  I could go down to the courtyard in the daylight and examine the fountain to my heart’s content.
He grunted, his shoulders twisting as he held firmly to the spear.
I turned my head towards Mrs Hudson’s voice.  She’d covered quite a distance in the moment I had taken to soak in the greenshine.
He swayed and I reached out for him, grabbing his hips and scattering the stones I’d still had in my hand.  I looked up.  He braced his forearm against the wall and formed an arch above me.
Sherlock followed.
I inclined my head in agreement.  We were heading into territory I knew.
John glanced at the translucent wings opening and closing, groaned and flung his arm over his eyes.
“He doesn’t often say where he’s been, but occasionally he’ll bring something back and it could be from Singapore or Southampton.  If the case is interesting he doesn’t care how far, but he won’t even go to Mayfair if he doesn’t find it interesting,” she said, sitting down and taking up her tea cup.
Fine, fine.  The different colours are pretty though.
“That’s sorted, then,” Sherlock said and strode off into the darkness.
Siròc spread her wings again.
The client took a deep breath.  “Recently, I’ve completed a project for which I had been studying swans.”
“I thought you might.”
“Wrap it in a clean tea towel,” I called as I bounded up the stairs to my room.  “Just getting my medical kit.”  I grabbed my bag from the wardrobe and ran down again.  The glass door at the back of the hall was open and I followed the smell of baking to the kitchen.
“Hydra prefer to bite their prey here,” he said and curved his other hand around the back of my neck.  “In the right place, their long fangs will paralyse the creature they have caught, then they shake it to snap the spine.  They hunt quarry smaller than me and usually in salt water.   It was strange to find one so far upriver and on the shore.  Perhaps I took him by surprise as well.”  He rubbed over the tender skin on my flank.  “Before I lopped off the last of his heads, he took quite a chunk out of me and by extension, out of you.  You’ve healed quickly, considering.”
I couldn’t see who had spoken, but I knew the voice.  It drew me out from among the tall trees onto the meadow, silvery in the moonlight, sloping away into shadows.  A fragrance rose as I walked through the tall flowers, the earth between them warm under my bare feet.
“Then reach back into the water and hold onto the stems.  They are very strong,” he said, sitting back.  “And they’ll like it.”
“That would be too easy,” Sherlock scoffed.
John chuckled and scanned the Pond.  “Well, I see Ms Swann feeding a drift of swans and a lone goose that’s waiting patiently on the pavement by her side.  Ah, she gave him some bread.  Poor bloke.”
I stared, licking my lips.
She stood very still and looked back at him.
“We shall have facts soon, I think,” he said and held up a locket enclosing a small braid of hair.  “This was enclosed with a letter to Lt Simpson from Madeline.  He had kept them together and she had had them back when he died.  I should be able to test the hair for traces of poison.”
Want.  That was the word that summed it all up and he must have felt it burgeoning against his thigh.  I inhaled, my chest pushing against his.  In bed was where I wanted him, and I would destroy anyone or anything that thwarted me having him.  Want.  I closed my eyes – upstairs was too far away.  The floor would do.
Sherlock fluttered above the roof ledge.
Sherlock had already set down his violin case on the sofa and unlatched it.  “Would you mind if I tried it?” he asked as he lifted his violin to his chin.  “I had the bow re-haired and wanted to test it before taking it away from the shop, but the luthier was in a hurry to close and I didn’t have the chance.”
“Busy night, brother mine,” Mycroft said as we joined him looking out over the dark river.
“I got the idea from you, when you were taking the batteries out of your radio.”
“I hadn’t wanted to die from that bullet wound,” I said.  “I prayed not to die.”
“I know she wasn’t,” I murmured.
“Beautiful,” John panted as Sherlock spilled over his hand.
My stomach grumbled.  “I’m hungry,” I said, reaching up to his neck and rubbing back and forth through the hair at the nape of his neck.
I let my head hang lower.  “The leaves are talking about what happened.”
A glimmer above my head drew my eyes as I stepped forwards.  Before me a wide staircase swept towards the upper floors.  I followed its curves past more levels than it seemed the house should possess.  At its apex was a dimly patterned oval that I took to be a skylight.  “It’s bigger than it looks from the street,” I said.
The jolt went right up my spine and spread out in a fan from the back of my skull.  I squeezed my eyes shut and breathed through the pain.  Maybe Sherlock would think I had collapsed and come up to run some experiments on me.  A bruised coccyx was a sure thing.  I exhaled slowly.  At least I hadn’t bitten my tongue.   Maybe the experiments would involve putting me on ice.  That would help with the bruising.
.  I’d thought it strange that they’d changed back into their costumes.  They’d had on denim and t-shirts on the Tube.
John’s arm tightened.  He crushed Sherlock against him and screamed into his feathers.
Someone, pale and slim, moved in the shade beneath the trees.
Dear Patient Readers,  I have no idea how I thought I was going to fit all of this into one chapter, as it has now, as you can see, grown into three!
I nodded.  “Potent stuff.”
I went in.
“All’s well that ends well, then,” I concluded.
“I got them sorted this afternoon,” she said.  “The Detective Inspector seems awfully anxious, Sherlock.”
Sherlock slipped his hand beneath his father’s, turned his head and kissed the back of his father’s hand.
A dim aura of light broke the darkness ahead, to my right and near the level of my shoes.
Sherlock appeared totally confident of where St Bartholomew's walls would rise a millenium hence.  I had already learned how well he knew modern London.  Perhaps he knew it in every age.  So, he led and Lestrade and I followed, trundling our sea monster along behind us.
“Lucky for me,” I said.
“Danger?” I asked, although the dressing gown and slippers didn’t seem the right kit for it.
“Aren’t you worried you’ll get sauce on it?
I hope not.
I thanked him and rushed forwards.  I didn’t know whether Greg had made it there yet or I would have claimed to have been with the police.  It would have been true enough.  Since I'd gone with the phone story, it was fortunate he didn’t call me as I was talking to the guard.  That must have used up the last of my luck.
Sherlock was walking towards me, throwing his garments ahead of him onto the same heap mine were forming.  He stepped to the side, opened the hatch to the incinerator built into the wall, removed some items from his pockets and dropped the rest of his clothes in as he took them off.
“After I found where you preened, I came to watch you swim with your flock.  They do well, but it’s so cold for them with so few feathers.”
“Some blokes shouting and banging on the door with the hilts of their swords, then trying to hack their way through it with battle axes,” I managed to say, as I watched his buttocks flex as he raised his arm and brought it down again.
I tilted my head back.  Something rustled up in the leaves.  “It was this tree,” I said.  “I'm sure.  She pulled me over here.  Her top was slipping off one shoulder, the moonlight reflecting off the glitter in her hair."
Sherlock was still with me when I woke next.  I smiled at that.  It’s not often the case.
On the opposite bank, a chattering group were being helped into their carriage.  “What kind of horses are those?” I asked, squinting.
He looked up at me; eyes not completely focussed.  I bent to kiss his forehead and placing one foot directly behind the other, backed away.  Albeit blearily, his eyes followed me.
"Warm yourself by the fire, John," Sherlock said, reaching for the lantern.  "Listen for the cart coming round.  I'll check on Lestrade."  He clapped me on the back, nudging me in the direction of the open door and headed back the way we had come.
We reserved a table inside.
There.
“I see you have,” Sherlock said, giving me a gentle push into my chair by the hearth.  He lit the fire without even bending over.
She was quiet for a moment more when Sherlock finished, head tilted as though she were still listening to something.  “It sounds well on the violin.”
“Yes,” he said.
She smiled at that and tilted her chin at what I was carrying.  "Good luck with all that," she said.
At the end of the room, a target was positioned between the curtained windows.  It was too large for darts.  There were no pockmarks in the adjacent walls that I could see and the curtains did not appear torn.  Either Mr Holmes was an excellent archer or archery was not practiced here at all.  I was still judging the distance from where we stood when he eased the harp away from my grasp and placed an unstrung bow in my hand.
He clamped his legs about my thighs and reared up over me. Without the veil of his shadow, the stars blazed and I saw that the moon was touching the treetops.  Our kisses had taken more time than I had thought.
Sherlock slid the door shut and pulled a lever.
Sherlock tilted his head.  She hadn’t lost him yet.
“You have questions,” he said and raised his bow. His tone was cool; he did not turn around.
“I didn’t realise there were deer in the woods,” I said when I reached Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock tried to close his eyes and found he could.  He discovered he had an elbow.  He pushed himself up upon it and re-opened his eyes, focussed on Mycroft’s pale grey wings.  “Feeling more subtle this morning, are we?”  Sherlock remarked and decided to resume a prone position.  “What do you suspect?” he asked.
Sherlock hit pause.  “Note how sharp the other objects in the field are.  The auto-focus was working perfectly.”
I waved my healed and thoroughly cleaned palm between us.  “That hardly required heightened senses to detect.”  I glanced past him and saw what the cause of my pain had been.  Sharp, glossy leaves punctuated with clusters of bright red berries were twined around the entire bannister.
“What if those things are lost?”
Anger rushed through him.  “Is that it?” John rapped out.
Seasonal injuries healed, I proceeded on to my room where I found my harp by the bed where I expected it to be.
“He was exceptionally good at concealment.”  Mycroft sighed.  “It took us a long time to discover what he was doing to alleviate his boredom while he waited.”
He tugged me up the road by the lead that nominally indicated that I was taking him to the park for a run.  I believe he viewed it as taking me for an outing.  I cannot guess what the man whose face I saw pressed against an upper deck window on the night bus that whooshed past us made of our sortie.  More grist for the Manor legends mill, I suppose.
"'Afternoon," he said to Molly as we passed.
Settled on the seat in front of Sherlock’s window, goblet in hand, I looked up to the gallery.
John upended the bread wrapper for the pigeons crowded around them.  “We both saw what we saw last night and we even have it on film, and I’m doubting both my eyes and my sanity this morning,” John said.
The crowd closed behind him.  “You might feel differently by then.”  The words floated to us over the heads of the throng.  If he said more, it was lost as the musicians began again to play.
I clearly had not been subtle in my gaping.
They halted in the middle of the bridge and stared westward.  The black swan was not among the birds on the water.
Sherlock met me on the landing.  He had shed his coat and scarf and behind him firelit shadows played.
The wavering glow of firelight spilled out onto the landing, followed by the vibration of one violin string.
The tea would make me sharper, I thought as I sipped it and turned the cards face down.  “Let’s give you a more careful look, shall we?” I said and turned the nearest one face up.
Blue lights flashed, banding the black water and colouring one of the feet of the deceased.  Sherlock pulled me higher on the foreshore.  Lights glowed along the southern shore and the growl of a bus brought my eyes to the familiar, floodlit bridge that spanned the river to the east.
I sat down before it and opened the lid wide.
“But I love London,” I said.
Across the room, his distillation process carried on with soft burbles.  It didn’t appear in danger of exploding anytime soon so I let my mind wander.  Who, I wondered idly, kept the copper coils bright and the glass vessels shining?  The thought that it might be Wiggins made me scowl.  At least he had knocked; his usual disconcerting habit of simply appearing didn’t seem to apply to the Apothecary’s Room.
I wanted to look at him, but my vision wavered when I tried lifting my head.
My brows went up and I turned to meet his eyes, wishing I knew how exactly she communicated and if I’d ever be able to understand.  “That’s kind of her.”
Slowly, he drew them away, slipped them back between my legs.
“Will you signal me?”
Sherlock shook his head.
“Clothes needed to recuperate,” he said, not moving.
“Still relevant to some folks,” I said, the image of convoys setting out once the moon had set not so distant in my memory.
I could see the glint of heavy silver about his wrist as he held it there.  I glanced at Sherlock.
I awoke from a dream of sun-drenched linens to a strange, shadowy room.  I shook my head and spotted Sherlock seated on the carpet, silhouetted by a candle on the floor beside him.  I crawled to the foot of the bed and peered at the glow in which he sat.
“No,” John replied, eyes sweeping along the line of the bridge.  “Nowhere in sight.”
“John?”
He grabbed a handful of knives and threw them rapid fire at the pristine piece of wood.  Near the top of the plank, they formed the outline of a head.  He gestured at me with the tip of the last blade.  “Care to try?”
Such a cliché.  I dropped my hands and laughed.  We do laugh at the strangest times.  “Aren’t your parents going to be there?”
“Oho,” I said.
He sighed.
I looked towards him and was grateful that I was not holding my tea cup.  I was sure mind-readers did not exist, but his eyes were flickering over me as though he were absorbing the data on a computer screen.  Among my gambling friends, my inscrutable poker face was renowned.  I wondered whether I had lost that skill, too.
Sherlock dropped the rope back in the boat and shoved off from the post with the blunt side of the hook on the spear.  The tide bumped us back against the wood.  Sherlock twirled the spear about and thrust the pole into the gravel.  The skiff skimmed over the water in defiance of the tide, catching a current rushing towards the opposite shore. With a small sound of satisfaction, Sherlock dropped the spear in the boat and grabbed the oars.
“I still think you killed somebody.”
He unwrapped his sandwich and started reading.
“Um- wow. Ok- the truth is that Callie recently stole a paper I was working on and turned it in to one of her professors. She was a pharmacology major. She didn’t tell me- I turned it in a week later and was accused of plagiarism.”
“First floor, actually, but the windows don’t open more than a few centimeters. What do you make of that?”
“Lestrade would have sent someone else if I hadn’t volunteered.”
“I’m trying to find the group that Callie usually sits with for lunch.”
“On him? No. Do me a favor- ask him about that party on Sunday? Loman dragged him off before I could. I have a class…”
He sent a quick text to Lestrade (“Finished blog. Doing more research but will send a report by tonight- SH.”) and then sat in front of his computer and started looking up Wells.
“Sorry- Mr. Holmes- what exactly is this about?”
“Well I- I… I guess I was just… venting.”
“So what you just… show up to the finals?”
“No, we can’t. He’s obviously going to say he lost it if you give him the chance to. He’s already been arrested.”
“And this is definitely John Watson’s number? Not just the contact she had in her phone?”
“There’s no one in the morgue now- they’re all at lunch.”
By now, John had finished his food. Sherlock still had half a sandwich and a bit of rice left, but his high was wearing off and he was anxious for an afternoon line. Maybe that was why this conversation kept getting derailed. His head kept getting confused- all the information he was getting connected- a girl who liked dangerous guys, a sudden disinterest in academics- but it didn’t seem to go anywhere. And he’d never dealt with anyone quite like Watson, who asked questions back, questions about Sherlock himself, no less.
Lestrade considered this. “I’ll make you a deal. I’ll hold him until Friday morning so he can accompany you to the funeral. After that, we’ll reevaluate the evidence and decide whether or not to take him back into custody. Sound fair?”
“Excuse me,” a voice interrupted. They looked up to see DS Loman standing beside the table.
- did not walk in Sherlock’s direction as he left, nor did he turn to look at him. But when he passed through the moonlight, Sherlock was able to see a glimpse of his face. It was no one he recognized. He was nice-looking but not in a committed relationship, Sherlock deduced. Short blonde hair; had played a sport in high school but not anymore. It was hard to get much more about him from this distance. He didn’t appear to be on drugs or alcohol, but he did not have the anger or fear one might expect on the face of someone who had just killed a man either. If anything, he seemed anxious, looking around as though he was unsure what to do next. Then he was gone, running back into the darkness, and Sherlock turned the other way. At home, he lay in bed riding his high until he crashed into a deep sleep.
He sighed and turned back to the posts with actual clues. He had selected three (and an excerpt from a fourth) to print and add to the file: the first was about the breakup with the Motorcycle Guy and the others referenced the new boyfriend.
After flipping through his notes for a few seconds, Lestrade answered, “Tuesday. The eighth.”
It occurred to him then that he hadn’t yet heard voices. He was some distance away, but if the two fighting men had been yelling, he would have heard them clearly. The fight was clearly escalating- where was the yelling?
use the windows. So his primary concern is jamming one of the windows, but he has to be careful with timing. He needs the incident to be reported to maintenance, but not fixed.”
“How on Earth would you know that specifically?”
“Yeah. Zachary Wells. Went to your university- you know him?”
“Of course it’s
He grabbed whatever food he didn’t have to stand in line for and then glanced around at the tables, trying to see if any of the people he’d talked to had congregated somewhere. He wanted to make sure he didn’t miss interviewing anyone his victim had eaten lunch with. As he was scanning, he heard a voice behind him call “Mr. Holmes? Is that you?”
“I don’t necessarily
” The question was
from killing Rogers. Sherlock pulled out the address he’d pulled from Watson’s file. It took another half hour to walk to his flat.
He strode over to the desk where Lestrade was working and rapped his knuckles against the surface.
“Oh, don’t throw a fit. It’ll only take a minute. Some kid drowned in the lake on Saturday night.”
Had a boyfriend pulled her into something dangerous? Was she depressed? Maybe she was afraid of one of her exes and was losing sleep over it?
Wells was generally a C student, because he had the mind of a B student but did the work of a D student. Online pictures, unsurprisingly, showed him at frequent parties with a changing cast of characters.
Obviously, he had to find whatever man she was planning on running away with, whether it was John Watson, Marcus, or an entirely new player in this little game. How to go about it?
“I think you just got confused. I didn’t leave my flat on Saturday night.”
He was, however, a people-watcher by nature and stayed a minute to flex his deductive muscles. They were both male, and though such a rendezvous initially implied lovers, their demeanors were tense and suggested they were fighting. Sherlock could only see their shadows, but could tell from the shorter man’s stance that he was a strong but unaggressive man…
And then, more than a week passed until he was even mentioned again.
Sherlock found an empty interrogation room and sat down at the table. He noticed it was the same one where he’d first met John Watson two days ago, and yet it so reminded him of yesterday- sitting with him (or at least, his writing) while eating a sandwich and trying to subdue the narcotic urges. We need to stop meeting this way, he thought.
seems fuckin fair
Please, John, you’re scaring me
“Well how do you do that?”
“Did you know that Watson and Wells were flatmates?”
“Let’s see- didn’t see her last Saturday. We hung out with Katie and Marcus on Sunday. Monday it was just lunch, Tuesday we studied together- in the library- and then had dinner. Wednesday and Thursday it was just at lunch. And Friday- the night before it happened- I went out for drinks with a few other friends and ran into her and Katie there. They left at about eleven, though. Don’t know if they went straight home.”
?????
“Well. I guess if that’s true you have nothing to worry about.”
“Yeah, but I prefer you.”
“This isn’t a joke, Mr. Watson.
The man- the
I can’t remember everything we talked about over dinner, but it really wasn’t anything important. Classes and work and all the usual stuff. Katie recommended a movie- something American, I think. Callie ranted for a bit about a lab partner she found obnoxious- but in a funny way, just telling stories. The girls are were always the life of the party.
“Not this time, Sherlock. You might be right, but I can’t take that chance- we’ve already let him go and brought him back in once. It’ll look bad if it becomes a cycle.”
This was meant to be a sign of forgiveness- don’t worry about being late, because even if you won’t let me help you, I’m not really mad. Predictably, Sherlock brushed it off. “I’m a fast reader, Lestrade. I’ll have it done in no time.” And with no further farewells he turned, leaving the station with his head down and walking briskly, in a hurry to get home to his bed and his coke stash.
“What for?”
“So two people closely connected to you died mysteriously on the same night and you want me to believe that it’s just a… coincidence?”
“Mmh- any news on that?”
“Well, maybe Watson was just so angry that he couldn’t type straight.”
John, please
There were a few long moments of silence in the room while Lestrade worked out what to say. “Listen, Sherlock… we really appreciate you helping us out all the time…”
“No…”
“Any reason for that?”
If someone who appeared so unaggressive could murder, possibly more than once, what else could he fool Sherlock about?
“He would’ve needed to plan a bit- and she didn’t necessarily report right away- I’d say our killer started planning this somewhere from Saturday to Monday,” Sherlock said, mostly to himself as he flipped to the corresponding pages in her planner. “Let’s see… Saturday she went shopping with someone named Katie?”
“Sure- and you can call me John.”
“Zach? I figure I’ll worry about that after all this stuff with Callie is done. Do you have any evidence- why do you even suspect me? It didn’t seem like anyone else did.”
“Drowning Zachary Wells! I saw it happen, alright?”
Asking if she was seeing anyone did yield some interesting answers. No one was exactly sure, but they all admitted that Callie had a taste for the bad boys. Thinking that anyone under suspicion of two murders would qualify as a ‘bad boy,’ Sherlock asked if they knew anything about John Watson, but suddenly the trail went cold. Almost everyone he asked said that the two seemed to like each other as friends only. “I always thought he might be into guys,” one of Callie’s few male friends added.
After an hour of walking with no discernable trace of cocaine left in his system, Sherlock was exhausted and grumpy. He hailed a cab to take him the rest of the way home, wondering if it was time to consider John a suspect of both murders.
Sherlock paused for a moment, leaning back and steepling his fingers, giving John a chance to squirm. He was aware Lestrade was probably watching him, but he couldn’t bear not to follow every lead.
“Alright. Let’s go back to that Sunday. So you were-“
“I’m not bringing you back into that morgue feet first, Sherlock. Go get something to eat, then I will give you Watson’s story,” Lestrade said, masking his concern with a severe tone.
“Fair enough,” he replied, handing him a page of handwritten text.
“Did the victim live so high up that a ladder wouldn’t reach her window?”
He read through her last posts, but all four entries from December were totally useless. All she had posted in the week leading up to her murder was a list of lipstick recommendations and a review of an eye shadow palette, and Sherlock was even more eager to solve this case so he could justifiably delete this ridiculous information from his brain.
“Was she seeing anyone?”
John looked at him with something resembling amusement for a second before asking, “How did you even get in here? It’s only students and faculty.”
It ended there- no punctuation or final sentiment about how tragic her death was. Sherlock sighed. Figures, with his luck today, that there was nothing useful in the story. Then again, he had asked the main suspect, so he couldn’t really expect this to be fully truthful. Guilty or innocent, Watson wasn’t going to admit to anything incriminating, especially now that he’d officially been taken into custody.
“Sherlock- a word?” Lestrade said tensely.
“Well, you can let him go.”
“It’s possible but we couldn’t find any evidence- we checked her mouth for fibers and there’s no marks on her face to suggest that anything was tied around her head.”
Lestrade glanced up. “Not now, Sherlock. I have paperwork to sign.”
“Strange we’ve never met before. I suppose you’re not doing medicine, then? Or communications- I take some of those classes too?”
Sherlock’s eyebrows raised when the man suddenly shoved the taller one into the water. Had he been wrong? Was the short man violent by nature?
“Not that I know of- but she wasn’t very public about that stuff. She was never into serious relationships for some reason. I think she liked the excitement of seeing someone new- she always liked exciting guys, anyway. Katie would know better than I would.”
Blood won out, it seemed. A background check found two arrests for possession with intent to distribute, and when he hacked in to a sealed juvenile file, he found one more.
“That’s what I find strange, actually. Why
“Slashing her face once she was already dead- this murderer was angry. He may have planned carefully, but I’m not sure such a person would have the patience to plan this for a long time. He would have wanted to take action as soon as possible. You said she reported the stuck window nearly a week ago- what day was it specifically?”
“She fought him? That means she saw the knife- why wouldn’t she scream?” he mused. “Was she gagged?”
"Nonsense, Sherlock! You're staying for dinner." She said with a smile.
Sherlock turned his head to face Sebastian and then, in a fast move, grabbed the boy by the collar of his leather jacket and pushed him against the locker with incredible strength. The Greaser's face was red with anger, and he was looking at the other boy with a killing gaze. "Shut. Up. Sebastian!" He shouted, clenching his teeth. "Next time you say something like that you'll regret it!" He said as he showed him his fists.
He heard the door opening once again and he sighed, feeling in that limbo existent amidst being asleep and being awake, or as awake as he could possible be with that quantity of morphine on his system.
Sherlock scoffed. “Please, John. I know you idolize me, but thinking that I’d be at the same level as Alan Turing, that’d be wishful thinking, or stupidity.”
They started talking in whispers, and really, Irene was such a good actress, anybody who passed by could swear these two were absolutely mad for each other. Sherlock tried his best to look natural and smiled, forcing himself not to turn his back and look at John, who was approaching them.
He climbed the stairs towards the second floor when a woman greeted him.
"No it isn't, of course it isn't. That is absurd. The person who had left me that message before is no longer here." Sherlock stood there, looking at the body. The message was definitely for him, but he was too scared to admit it. He couldn't be back, not this again.
Sherlock. The one he was with John, the one who was not an idiot.
Sherlock looked at it.
John smiled fondly at him and sat on the couch, “I have got to work, remember?”
Sherlock cleared his throat. "Thank you."
He typed a text to Lestrade as fast as he could.
He couldn't believe what his eyes were seeing. Sherlock Holmes was standing in front of him, was alive, was perfectly healthy. How the hell was that even possible? Lestrade didn't have the slightest idea. He cleared his throat and almost shouted. "You idiot, you complete, utter idiot!"
---------------------------
"Sure, sure, he is fine, he is okay."
"Lestrade."
John nodded against his shoulder. "I'm fine."
He couldn't explain why John blinked, squishing his eyes shut and grimacing, as if he was in a terrible pain.
Sherlock smelled Victor’s hair and oh god he had missed that smell so much. He closed his eyes, clenched his fists and told himself he was here for the fucking
Sherlock nodded once again.
"Well, yes, I consider you my friend, don't you?"
"So it was
“Oh, but I know your style well enough.”
“What did she tell him?”, she said with amusement.
Sherlock ignored all the other observations he'd gathered. "You- you can hang your coat there, or- or upstairs. Or if you're cold-"
"That day I needed you to watch. Moriarty had planned to destroy me, had done for a very long time, it had to be done slowly, step by step. And he did it, he destroyed my reputation, turned Scotland Yard against me, turned the press against me, and the last thing he needed to destroy was-"
But when he wanted to run away from John, he had nowhere to go. Because the physical space was John, his mind was John, his phone was John, 221B was John.
Lunch passed by. Sherlock was reading this book, Jack Kerouac's
"Yes! Don't you know who he is? Come on! Sherlock Holmes! He used to solve like every crime in the country and Dr. Watson wrote about it."
Mike frowned too, concerned about his friend. "Are you okay?"
Sherlock loosened the grab of John's arm and looked at him , unable to say anything. John fixed his sweater and his glasses and continued along the hall, forcing himself not to look at Sherlock, who was still motionless in front of the lockers. His back was killing him. At least things were crystal clear now. Nothing was ever going to happen and he put a stop to Sherlock and it was all fine, except for his back and his head ache, but at least now everything was clarified. That was the way it was supposed to be, right? Then why did it hurt so much?
"Our...fight."
*******
When he finally gathered some courage, he spoke up. "What are you doing here, Dr. Watson?"
Sherlock was blank. He never said it, had he? Yet he was still wondering if he wanted her back or not. He considered all his options, he could have let her get killed, she wasn't his problem, she could have died for all he cared but he just couldn't let that happen.
"Thank you."
"I'm with Greg in this one. This is very serious Sherlock, and you can't just walk away. No."
But maybe he should be focusing on his conversation with Mike instead of thinking about Sherlock.
John looked at Sherlock for a moment in which he wasn't able to say anything, all he wanted to do was look at him forever and keep holding those cold, long hands, but then he remembered, "
Sherlock leaned closer towards him and looked at the drawing.
"Are you okay, John?"
And he felt lonely, more than ever. He had Mike and he was a nice friend and accepted him no matter what, but he really didn't trust him, he started feeling like he really needed to find someone to talk to, someone to express all his frustrations to, someone who would understand, someone who would accept. But he didn't have that. Not even his sister Harry would listen to him, she was too busy thinking about Clara for that. He really felt the need to find a friend. But how?, who?
"Oh!" She said, surprised. "I see!" And Sherlock felt a bit scared and regretted opening his mouth. "So,
"Oh no, no way, you are the one who wanted to carry condoms and stuff."
Sherlock finished reading it and brought it back to John, without looking up. “Thank you.”
greaser
Sherlock sat up straight and felt the need to actually say something this time. "How's that?"
John seemed at a loss of what to say, he did look like he had absolutely no idea who was standing in front of him, but how? how was that even possible? He forced himself to stay calm, sighed, closed his eyes and said once again, seeming to gain his composure. "John... It's me. Sherlock. I'm alive. I know it must be surprising to you, but I'm not dead and I'm here once again." He thought it was utterly stupid having to explain himself but if it helped John to stop being such an idiot he was going to do it.
"Yes, I do. This was lovely, I'll um- see you later."
Sherlock didn't want to hear them.
John nodded slowly.
"Maybe." Sherlock said seriously, he turned his back, not wanting to look at John.
John looked at her with a
"You found me there. What were you doing there? I thought you were- you didn't want to- you made it quite clear."
He blinked and stared at the closed pad laying on his desk. He was holding the pencil in his hand, which wasn’t trembling by now, but John couldn’t bring himself to trust in it anymore. He tried to focus on the silhouette of the body, but every time he tried, landscapes would draw themselves in his mind. Perhaps he should become a landscaper instead, try and paint what was in front of him and that’d be it.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and forced himself to blink. He opened them and looked and looked and looked, unable to tear the look away from John's neck. Perhaps he was dreaming after all. God, he wished he did. No. He wasn't. He looked. He couldn't stop looking, and saw that horrible, barely visible, hidden-by-the-short-hair scar that Sherlock had seen three times before. In the three victims of murder.
John stopped and looked at him with a frown. “Then you’re not going.”
he said about the portrait of a man sitting on his back as he painted a landscape,
John looked at him, “hm?”
"Sure, loyal. Whatever. I have to um... Go now." He said turning the car on again.
"Is there anything wrong with Sherlock?"
The greaser sighed. Greg was going to keep insisting anyway, so he might as well just say it. “I think we both know that was never going to work.”
John thought, and he was definitely not referring to shaking the erasers.
It was never meant to happen.
Sherlock looked at him. "John."
John wanted to ask.
"You should take a seat." John told Sherlock seriously. "You're pale."
John looked at him with a confused expression and Sherlock rolled his eyes. John obeyed.
She extended her arm and with her shaky index finger pointed at his eyes. "Because your eyes lit up."
Sherlock didn’t look at him. Didn’t have the courage to do so.
------------------------
Greg talked lower, even though now there were less people in the hallway. "What happened?"
John was now crossing his arms, as if they were shields, as if Sherlock was about to hurt him, tear him to pieces.
“Because you claim we’re all idiots, so what would be the point?”
He was going to answer, when the greaser passed him by and shook his mother's hand with a big (and evil, John could tell) smile in his face. "Sherlock Holmes, you must be Mrs. Watson"
"Everything, John. Everything."
Sherlock enjoyed when his mind went blank.
He would never do that to John Watson.
When it was time to go to the club, he found Sherlock in that chair he always used, reading again, incredibly focused, but he was now holding another book, it was Ray Bradbury's
The problem wasn’t the loss in itself, it was the prospect of what could have been. The illusions, the ideals, the what ifs. That was the problem.
John released him just a little, he clasped Sherlock’s neck and looked at him. “I do”, he replied.
Sherlock opened his eyes. John kept his eyes on the painting, a small, soft smiled drawing in his face.
With every move, John touched Sherlock's prostate and Sherlock was melting into John's body. He wrapped his legs around John's torso and began moving out of sheer instinct and need, and he'd never felt anything remotely similar to this before.
Sherlock smiled and leaned to turn the radio on, and suddenly it became harder for John to keep his eyes fixed on the road. The greaser was making the mimic of playing the guitar to the rhythm of the song, and John couldn't help but laugh.
would be quite interesting.”
Surprisingly enough, John decided he was too tired to do homework and all he wanted to do was to get some sleep. "Mom, I'm exhausted. I really am. I'll go to bed right now."
Sherlock lowered his voice. “You tell me.”
that,
So, there you have it, finally after 38 chapters, the word 'cock' makes its appearance. I'm still not sure whether this should be considered 'mature' or 'explicit' though. This is my first attempt at writing smut or something of the like so excuse the naivety and tell me what you think about it! Certainly hope you liked it and... well expect some more.
“Show them to me.”
-Sherlock that John had to swallow before he was able to speak once again.
"It's late, look, the sun is hiding!", John said looking through the window.
Sherlock looked around. The classroom was empty. Everybody had left. He moved towards the door and closed it. John looked at him with a frown. "What are you doing?"
John knitted his eyebrows together, "you don't know what you're going to do, do you?", he asked.
“But?”, Sherlock said.
"I think in fifty years people won't know who the hell was Elvis."
"Of course I will."
John didn't know who he was.
John frowned. "I don't- I-", he cleared his throat again, "fine."
Sherlock simply looked at him, unable to mutter another single word. Words were not enough.
Anthea came in a few seconds later, clearly John Watson was on top of the archives. Mycroft grabbed it and passed it down to Sherlock. In the first page there was a picture of John, and Sherlock had to take a breath to steady himself.
John didn’t reply. He simply tossed the paper back on his bag and left, terrified his voice might give him away. He walked out of the classroom and closed his eyes, taking deep breaths, feeling his legs weak. He told himself he wasn’t going to cry but couldn’t help it. The tears started streaming down his face and there was nothing he could do to stop them. He left the hall as fast as he could, unaware of the fact Sherlock had stood up, taken his bag and was standing behind him as soon as he started crying.
Now that he thought about it, it was weird, all of Jim's gang was at the cafeteria talking and having lunch but Sherlock wasn't and he was so pissed he hadn't realized. Actually, he hadn't been with them during lunch the past few days.
“You’re not following the main concepts of human anatomy, Sherlock. The tennar mass is missing.”
“It’s fine, I’m here. I’m here with you, John. You’re in London, not in Afghanistan. London. Baker Street. Here. With me”, a thumb caressed the back of his hand.
And John Watson's face was enough to brighten the whole hallway. A chiaroscuro in all its magnitude.
John stood by himself but Sherlock didn’t let go of him. “Yes”, he whispered as he stared into those impossible cobalt sky blue mint cerulean verdigris turquoise teal tiffany blue eyes. “Yes. It’s just-”, he dragged a deep breath, “are all of these yours?”
It all happened too fast.
"Oh! And one last thing. If you mention anything about this conversation to my brother, I will kick your ass. Clear?"
Sherlock gasped once again, a second before their lips met.
John looked at Sherlock, who wasn't paying attention anymore. He couldn't help but smile. "Shut up Harry!"
He cleared his throat. “She talked to him. I was hiding in a corner and watching the encounter. End of the story.”
Sherlock looked at him. Finally. But he was reluctant. Awkward. Different. "Johnny Adams and the nightcats."
look and Lestrade looked down. Sherlock paced restlessly around the office. It had been three days since he had been checked out of the clinic, three days since he last saw John. Withdrawal was still attacking him, but he focused all his energy on the case. The most important case of all.
John opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock, a dark shadow drawing itself over his pupils. Sherlock moved his finger out immediately and pushed himself towards John, finding his lips midway.
Alright, a small announcement before you continue with the story: I've been very busy with uni so next week there won't be an update, but don't worry! I'll be back in two weeks! And a small reminder you can find me on
. As if his mouth was a G-string, and his eyes created Adagios by themselves.
“What happened?”, Lestrade asked, turning to look at Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed. "Nothing happened to John, I'll be fine as well."
"Sure. We'll wait outside of the apartment. I'll meet you there."
"That was rude, Sherlock."
course
"We're here for a drug bust." Lestrade said as soon as he arrived to the flat.
"Sure, sure! Bye."
"What the hell am I supposed to know?" Sherlock shrugged. "I don't care how that nerd feels about me."
"And?" Sherlock said, looking at him expectantly.
"How... Did...You.... Know?"
, because Sherlock had to go.
Lies. All of them.
choice?" John asked, a bit lost.
*******
He frowned.
They stared at each other in silence.
Lestrade turned to look at Melissa, rising his eyebrows. "Well that's a first."
"Well, obviously you're unattached." Sherlock said calmly.
"Sorry, but she is."
"Working place."
Melissa nodded with a smile. “You too, Doctor Watson. Take care.”
Sherlock thought for a moment. "Um. Look John, I have told you a hundred times,
“He doesn’t know he could have been a potential target. And I plan it remains unknown.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think of the body as some kind of musical composition”, Sherlock said, standing in front of the paper, “-that is to say, as the union of a hundred different factors that align themselves together in order to create a whole”, he made a long trace across the paper, “-when you think about it, they’re not that different”, another trace, “there’s the idea of creating something that takes shape”, another long trace right in the middle, followed by his fingertips, in order to fade the trace of the charcoal and creating a shadow, he was creating a torso. “But for it to take shape, you need exactly the right pitch”, he started creating shadows around the torso, “high and low, high and low, high and low”, he repeated as he slowly filled the paper with more traces he then faded with his fingertips, “high, like then the sun is shining at just the right place and illuminates one of the corners of your body”, he said as he pointed to the upper right side of the torso, which was still clear from traces and shadows, as if it was filled by light, “low, like when the sun is setting and that light slowly leaves your body and creates a shadow of yourself”, he said, focusing on darkening the whole left side.
"No. We're not playing this game. Goodbye."
Sherlock could vow to that.
So, this is it, the final chapter. I want to thank each and every single one of you for reading, commenting and sending your kudos, your support kept me going on despite all the ugly things we had to go through as a fandom, and despite the angst and the sadness. I hope you enjoy this epilogue and I hope you've enjoyed this ride. Your comments made my days and even though I know maybe this was too angsty, I hope in the end it was worth it, because you guys deserve all the beautiful and wonderful things in the world. Thank you and thank you. Enjoy!
Oh well, a little Chinese would do them well.
"Well, he is, thank you for stopping by. I'll tell him you came. Goodbye." -John went to the door, and pointed at it, expecting Irene would leave. She didn't move.
He felt a sudden need to wrap his arms around the greaser, to kiss the pain away.
"And I saw it?"
He turned his coat collar up. "I am perfectly calm." He said.
"It's okay, it wasn't your fault. I was an idiot. I was the one who ruined it all. You're right, I'm head over heels for him. I didn't think things quite clearly."
“Oh?”, John said, feeling warm. “Thank you”. He considered for a time and then he whispered, “you were planning on doing this”.
It took Sherlock a couple of seconds until he wrapped his mind about what had just happened. He stood still as John descended the stairs and as he listened to the door shutting closed.
Which he didn’t.
Sherlock smiled. "How did you-"
"I saw you talking! Help me find her!" She said looking exasperated.
"I know where she is", Sherlock said, starting John's car.
But there was an element of eternity behind them.
John nodded. "Feeling good today. Yes."
Perhaps that was what he missed the most about the war. Perhaps that was the kind of danger which London didn't have. His boring, empty life in London.
So he had agreed, he had regretted it, he had been confused, he had been determined and now he was thinking it had been the biggest mistake of his life.
Or any of their workers.
"JOHN!" Mike shouted, and it sounded louder in the middle of the echo of the cafeteria.
I apologize for the delay, had a bit of a busy week. Thanks for your understanding and support x :D
"I needed a cigarette."
Sherlock looked at him, smiling. "And how did that go, Watson?"
"Because it's the way it is. I'm the guy who only cares about the notes and the school and you,
"Well Sherlock, I believe it is, because this is my apartment too and you just can't bring people in without a single care"
*******
"I want you to help me with it."
Finally their eyes met again.
the chances are that
"You would?" Sherlock said incredulously.
Mike smiled and turned to look at the photograph John had focused his attention on. “Sherlock Holmes”, he said, “quite a character.”
John’s smile widened. “Plus, I’ve got to go to my flat and change clothes or people will start talking.”
But beyond the emptiness and the feeling of loss and the raw nostalgia, there was an absorbing feeling of...encompassing. As if with every single word, with every phrase and with every expression, John gave a little bit of Sherlock's heart back, a little bit of his life back, as if bit by bit they were rebuilding whatever was shattered.
"Victor?" John whispered. "Sherlock, who's Victor?"
He couldn’t remember, his brain didn’t want to respond.
They were received by the detective inspector, who looked at John suspiciously. "Hang on. Who is this guy?"
“Is it?”, John asked, his gaze fixed on the canvas.
As John left the cafeteria, Sherlock turned to look at his... Friends. "Who?"
Harry took the cup and nodded. "And how the hell did I get here."
"Smoking in school. What a transgression Holmes, what a transgression." He said shaking his head disappointed.
He felt crowded. He needed space. He needed to breathe. He needed Lestrade to get away immediately because he had shown far too much vulnerability as it was, he simply couldn't keep making a fool of himself because of John.
John finally dragged a deep breath and broke it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Because I
He was hyperventilating. But he didn't know what to do about it.
“You started it”, John said, with a shrug, unable to stop the smile that was involuntarily drawing itself on his lips. Sherlock apparently was unable to stop his own as well. “I still need a place to mix the colors. Mind if I use your table?”, he said jokingly.
He touched the skin there.
fine.
“I- I left you a sandwich at the table, please eat it. You need to recover all the energy you’ve lost.”
"Someday you will understand the only reason I do this is because I care about you, dear brother. Now tell me, what is the nature of your relationship with John Watson?"
He would come to learn later that only great artists found the balance between light and darkness.
John wouldn't mind any way.
"I just want to see him again. I need to see him again. I've missed him. I want to thank him. He saved my life."
”, he said, pointing towards the picture. “Especially after- after Afghanistan. Thank you”, his voice wavered.
He sat in the chair of their kitchen table. Sherlock had moved the microscope aside and cleaned it throughly (yes, he had actually
"No, not necessarily."
"Us?"
and be nice and adorable but then go back to Irene and be the annoying greaser he is. And today he was particularly not feeling in the mood for that.
"Sure I will Molly, but as I told you, I can't assure you anything."
Harry was crying but didn't say another word, she got off the car and entered to his house in a hurry. She didn't look like she had been half-unconscious just twenty minutes ago.
They were so…lifeless.
John leaned closer and before Sherlock could even process it, placed a kiss on Sherlock’s forehead. It lasted less than a second, but Sherlock felt as if time had stopped completely altogether.
"Sh- Sherlock...Sherlock", John breathed.
Sherlock smiled weakly and placed a kiss on the corner of his lips. "I cannot.", he placed another kiss and suddenly his lips went down his jaw and down and down until they reached John's neck and then the greaser started kissing him thoroughly, John closed his eyes, giving into the incredible sensations he was feeling.
Sherlock gave him a brush.
John didn't
"He might be in danger."
Sherlock shook his head, "it has controlled the pain, but it's too sore. It hurts when I move and even when I breathe."
It was about 12 and Sherlock hadn't seen Harry in almost an hour, he was still sitting on the stair, drinking another cup of beer (his seventh) and trying to think so hard, when a phone rang.
That was definitely not how Sherlock would react. John sighed. He was making one fatal mistake: he was idolizing Sherlock Holmes, he was putting him in a pedestal and never letting him go, admiring him and thinking far too much of him when the truth is that Sherlock is only human. Only flesh and blood, as perishable as anyone else and looking for some kind of redemption, some kind of immortality through his paintings. Didn’t they all look for the same?
parting
He could store it in his mind palace. He knew that information would be useful later.
John moved closer to him, worriedly. “What happened?”
And that was what brought him there.
Jim leaned closer and kept his eyes fixed on the greaser. "Oh yes, of course you do, if you want to be
"Were you spying on my sister, Sherlock?", John asked, a bit surprised.
John looked at the phone lying in the table right next to the plate of half-eaten breakfast. He stood silent. Sherlock was saying something about the client, and he didn't seem to notice about the message, he didn't want John to know wether he cared about her texting or not.
“No, you didn’t. You’ve been staring at me with wide eyes and haven’t said a word! Should I assume there’s something you don’t want to say?”, John said, the anger clearly coming back to him.
"Oh you do, you absolutely do. Wow, I never thought you would fall for a greaser, look at that, in love with a bad boy..." She said mockingly.
He did.
After that dreadful conversation, he just sprawled on the couch and closed himself from the outer world, until the phone got him out of his daze.
"Let me just give you a warning, Johnny boy. Stop messing with us, leave Sherlock alone, and stop pretending you will become one of us, because that will
Sherlock hesitates for a moment, caught off guard. "Out... Need to... Think."
He heard Sherlock’s voice once again in his head. That deep, captivating voice. He could almost hear his laughter, see his face, his gray/blue/green eyes… He kept that image in his mind. Probably the happiest memory of his life.
"What?", Sherlock said, feeling his blood getting cold, his hands shaking. "Where?"
John smiled slightly.
"Yes, I drive better when I'm drunk."
Then an awkward silence fell. Sherlock was looking at John, without taking his eyes from him. They didn't talk for a long while, and Harry finally decided to break the uncomfortable moment. "Well, our cab is waiting, so we'll better be off. Goodbye, Sherlock! Don't murder anyone while we're out!"
Then John's eyes left his and Sherlock felt as if the warmth that he had left in his body had completely vanished as soon as John looked away.
---------------------------
"What the hell did you tell him, Mycroft?!" Sherlock yelled from the kitchen, moving his hands in the air and looking at his brother who was on the front door, lifting his eyebrow and looking as calm as always.
Sherlock shook his head. "They'll find nothing."
"Well, as many as you can handle without crushing and hitting me." He said, smirking.
"Woah! Careful with the glasses! Do you need help with those, buddy?"
"Yes, the more you hate him, the more destined you are to have to work with him. It's just the way it works, you know? There's nothing you can do about it."
Irene chuckled, looking down and shook her head. "You
P.S: I've been writing some Johnlock Christmas prompts! You can check them out
"I want you to solve them. It won't take much legwork, just a lot of investigating on the internet and the such, so your leg will keep healing."
Sherlock didn't ask him about the other victims. Until he admitted to comitting her murder, he wouldn't say a word, for if he didn't accept charges on one murder, he would doubtly accept on more. But Sherlock was convinced they had caught the killer, which could only mean one thing:
Sherlock nodded.
He had slept deeply. Alcohol could explain that as well. Although it couldn't explain why he had so many dreams throughout the night. He went to one scenario to the other, over and over and over again. Alcohol, however could explain why he couldn't remember any of those dreams at all. He knew he had them, but he couldn't quite picture them.
John realized of how selfish he had been, he hadn't even realize his sister wasn't drinking, and she didn't look anxious, she wasn't hiding her sadness with a fake smile, it was her, the funny, relaxed, happy Harriet Watson he remembered but he hadn't seen in a lot of time, since they were kids, probably. And he had changed? Had he? At least he was happy. Yes, he was. "Of course, Harry, I'd do anything to see you happy." He said with a smile.
“John?”, he asked, hoping with all his might that John hadn’t left. He couldn’t have, wouldn’t have been capable, after the night before, he couldn’t, could he? Perhaps he had regretted it, perhaps…
no, Mrs. Hudson wasn't behind that) and after a couple of minutes of silence, he placed the plate in front of John. John looked at it and his features softened for a second. "I thought you had
"That doesn't mean you're not going to graduate. Come on Sherlock, there are just a couple of months left to save it all. If you quit..."
Apologies for the delay, I've been quite busy at uni, and I've really tried to take some time to keep writing but sometimes it's just impossible. Lots of love! x
“I used to. Five years ago, now I don’t. I don’t even remember ever painting at all.”
Sherlock looked down for a second. “Hm. Yes. It’s-”, he looked at his phone, “11 o’ clock? What?”
Sherlock stood still for a moment.
Melissa laughed and looked back at Hawthorne, her face turning serious once again. “He gave me the biggest responsibility.”
This flat was not a catacomb, a memento of forgiveness, of rejection, of addiction, of pain and of loneliness. This flat was no longer empty, felt no longer lifeless, it was filled with an odd sense of excitement, adrenaline, and a touch, just a tiny touch of color.
"Oh, that would be fantastic!" Sherlock said excitedly.
It wasn’t like John Watson’s painting.
John blinked for a moment. Right. There was life beyond 221B. Not a particularly appealing life, but the life he had gotten used to. He had forgotten they had agreed to meet with Mike, somehow his whole world had been reduced to colors and stars and Sherlock somewhere along the way.
"He’s nothing. An old memory, that’s all.”
And someone holding his hand on the way.
"Where is all this sudden interest coming from, Mycroft?"
"Let's do something to celebrate." Sherlock said so naturally, turning to walk towards the door.
I unhooked the lead.  “I hope that was a yes," I said and patted him on the head.  "Have fun!"
He, at any rate, smelled like a garden in full flower.
“Offer still stands,” he crooned, “for you…”  He looked past Sherlock at me.  “…and your little, green man.”  His eyes dropped to the table’s edge and lingered as though he could see through it.  “All this waiting for dancing and electrocuting must have you both on edge.”
“Like a genie?” Sherlock suggested.
“They failed though,” I added, "and were washed away by a flood."
His voice has a pull on me.  I rolled onto my back as he knelt by the cushions.  He was as pale as the moonlight, but the skin around his eyes wasn’t dark anymore.
John shook his head.  Sherlock raised an eyebrow expectantly.
Sherlock dropped the spear into the boat and took back the oar I had been holding.  He skimmed both oars through the water.  We shot forward.
He didn’t see.
“What do you see that you like?” the man in the doorway asked.
John opened the door and Mrs Hudson hurried after.
The moon blade was in my left hand.  I hadn’t let go of it.  I raised it high and it caught all the colours of the sparks encircling us, drew them into its pearly depths.  I stared at the patterns they made.  The blade was so beautiful and Sherlock had made it for me.
“No!” Sherlock exclaimed.  “Gifts are not taken back!”
I walked to the doorway and saw Sherlock open a door just inside the supply room.  It was not one I had used, or even noticed; the small freezer that was part of the refrigeration unit in the main lab had been sufficient for the experiments with which I had assisted.
He met my gaze, shaking his head ever so slightly.
“Were they all this successful?”  I emptied the cup and held it up to catch more.
Sherlock grabbed my arm.  “John?” he murmured.
explain later.”
“No, I put those out here just a minute ago.  I hadn’t even made it to the kitchen when I heard you coming in.”
“What if I don’t discharge my duties to the standard you require?” I asked.
Harder to do deliberately than one might think and I’ve got the stone now, thanks.
“Are you suggesting that…”
“This is a bloody awkward angle,” I replied.
Sherlock took a step back and then another and another.  I kept at least my fingertips touching him and thus he drew me across the room.
“It’s not today out there, is it?” I asked when I found my voice again.
“It was like the way you looked at me that day at Bart’s and two minutes later you offered to share a flat with me,” John said.  “It might have been less than two minutes.”
I gasped.
“Would it work for this potion?” I asked.
Sherlock felt in his pockets.  There were only a few leaves left.
“Wildlife documentaries,” John explained.
“No roads lead there,” I groused.  My leg ached, my shoulder ached, my back was beginning to ache.  “In good conscience, you cannot call this a road.”  I dared not think what passing this way would have been like if it had rained in the morning.
“Oh, doesn't he now?” the starving man said in a sing-song voice.
“You are competent and conscientious.  I am sure you will perform your duties in a satisfactory manner,” he replied, his eyes returning to me.
“My aim is true,” I said.  “Let me show you.”  I thrust with vigour against his smooth skin, perceived the muscles rippling beneath it with the most sensitive part of me.   My lips sought the warm join of his neck and shoulder, found it and bit down there.
“Steady,” I whispered to myself.
Curiosity is a funny thing.
“...of the new tenant.”
“I was thinking brawling might be more the order of the day.”
“I see you,” I said and rose on my toes to kiss him.
“What were you doing in Paris or can’t you say?” Greg asked.
She tapped her fingernail against her cup.  It made a ringing sound against the china.
“Are you burnt?” I asked, trying to get limbs to work that were still asleep.
“Yes?”
“Yeah,” I said.
I’m not so sure about that.
Frowning, I looked between them.  “Is there something I should know about Miss Turner?”
He glanced at the other side of the bed.  There, barely distinguishable from the mounds of duvets, was Sherlock, a few dark tresses and a low susurration betraying his location.  John eased himself closer, curled around the warm curve of Sherlock’s back.
“Don’t tell me if you’ve already figured it out.”
Sherlock’s eyes were on my mouth.
“But I did,” Sherlock insisted, drawing his hand away from John to gesticulate with it.  “I could smell how her perfume intensified when they began to sweat.”  His voice grew quieter.  “The coffin-maker loved her perfume.  He would bury his nose in her hair, taking big, gasping breaths of it, while he thrust up into her, one of her legs on his shoulder, the other hooked around his waist.  She made small sounds as she got closer to her climax and his arm around her waist would tighten.  I could feel how he felt inside her.  How he felt when he heard her sounds, how he thrust harder because he wanted to be deeper, as deep as he could be inside her.”
“I’ve got it now,” Greg said.  “You can let go of the sack.”
“Start from the beginning,” Sherlock said over his steepled fingers when the stage was set.
It fit the lock.
Getting romantic, are you?
“Mr Morrow saved me by volunteering.  He and his wife wanted to know if their son’s body had ever washed ashore and if it had, where.
I whistled.
It was gone.
A black-gloved hand came around Culvert’s face from behind, another pulled his arm around his back, and judging by his grimace, yanked it up high.  “I think you’ve said enough for tonight,” Lestrade said, his features still half-hidden by his mask.  “But we’ll give you a chance to say more tomorrow and all the tomorrows after.”
John wrapped a leg around Sherlock’s hip, an arm round Sherlock's chest and buried his nose in the wild curls at the base of Sherlock's neck.  Sherlock, his wild thing.
“Right.  Good.  That’s good.  But I thought we were sticking with dancing.”
“I’m busy with John,” he said, “I don’t want to be disturbed.”
Sherlock ate another leaf.
John curled onto his side, facing the wall, his respiration calming.
The edge of the moon had crested the tree tops.  The air brightened.  The shadows grew longer.
This was as it should be.  I breathed.
Sherlock had turned with alarm from his inspection of some reeds growing by the water and fell to inspecting my foot and the shoe he had yanked off of it.
My hands were clasped.  Before I could see who he was, my new partner swung me around so that I took his place in the innermost circle.  The music sped up and he rotated counter-clockwise away from me.  When Sherlock looked back, his brow was furrowed.  It cleared my head.  I half-smiled.
“Do you find them or do they find you?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock turned and stared at her.
Mrs Hudson poured herself another cup of tea and gazed over my shoulder for a moment.  “It’s hard to say what might have happened if Papa hadn’t inherited the florist’s shop in Bath from his great uncle Angus.”
He looked up from beneath his brows at that.
“Heard you’d moved,” she said.  “I liked that location.”
He turned then and added to Greg that he expected to be home by midnight.
But there was yet a barrier between us I hadn't breached and I longed to reach the other side.  I knew there was more to him and I wanted it.  Wanted all that he was, the dark and the light and the infinite twilight.
Yeah.
Might be handy right now.
“It belongs to the one quick enough to catch it and they intended that to be you.  You’ve made many friends tonight.”
“But what would be the point of keeping the parcel and adding a new layer every two or three decades?”
“I was looking at the floor plan of the building.  The one the employees receive,” he replied.
He stepped to the wardrobe, pulled the two cases down from on top of it and flung its doors open.
I’m not in the mood for riddles.
“How can you know all this?” I asked, despite being aware of how eclectic his knowledge was and how deep it could go in any area that pertained to his Work.  I simply could not see the connections sometimes and worried about my ability to fulfil his charge to select the relevant passages in the florid text in my hand.
“Why two-years’ worth?” John murmured.
Carefully, I sank lower.
No one cried out.
The wind gusted.  Sherlock grumbled as his wings caught and he was dragged upwards.  He grew; his wings folding into a thick, dark coat.  His feet regained the roof.  From above, the smell had been a perfect match.  The correct chimney was near.  As he peered from side to side across the rooftops, the moon rose behind him.
Sherlock nodded.  “Much as I loathe these gatherings, it might have been prudent to volunteer to host another one sooner.  I’ve never attended any elsewhere and I was nineteen the last time we had one here.”
“What did you do while I was gone?” he asked as we resumed our walk.
“Better?” he asked.
Sherlock stood, reached for his coat.  “What time can you go to the Round Pond tomorrow?”
I leaned further over the parapet, picturing Baker Street as a moat.
“Yes, okay,” John said, shutting the door and giving the metal a pat.  “Have a good trip,” he called through the glass.
I don’t think the wonder of us both being back in residence had yet worn off for her even though we were certainly much more trouble than an empty suite that only needed dusting and polishing and the occasional airing.
I inhaled the scent of his tobacco.  He’d taken to smoking other blends while he’d been away, sweeter ones, that spoke of his distant travels and reminded me of his long absence even while he sat in the same room enticing me with his aromatic smoke.
“A meal would not be amiss,” I replied and nearly smiled.  “Wouldn’t a gun have been more efficient?”
Lestrade raised his eyebrows and nodded thoughtfully.
“I thought we finished that,” I said.
John glanced at Sherlock, who inclined his head towards the door.
“'We' now, is it?  I know enough,” I murmured aloud before tucking in.
“And the boot worked?”
I narrowed my eyes.
I opened my mouth and closed it again.
I cut as bidden.  “I’m surprised you’re taking it down so fast,” I said.  “You only solved it last night.”
“Quite the contrary,” Sherlock answered.
“I was perusing the formula for a purported aphrodisiac just now,” he said.  "Often used, judging by the number of stains on the page."
John wondered what Sherlock had spied on the door or felt on the knocker.  He waited.
I doubt my fatigue before I decided on an evening stroll was that extreme, although I cannot discount a dream completely, as vivid as my recent dreams have been.
The figure halted and changed course towards us, arms already extended before he reached us.  “Mr Holmes, what a pleasure to see you again,” he said, clasping one of Sherlock’s hands in both of his.  “What brings you to us?”
Silence, you.
"Secure," I said, letting go of the last knot I had tied.
“I’m beginning to wish someone would put a stake through mine,” Sherlock muttered, snatching another biscuit.  “Time travel or an immortal being were the two hypotheses put forward.”  He looked across the table at me.  “We should consult them on our cases regularly.  They bring such a fresh perspective.”  He shoved the whole biscuit in his mouth.
I rubbed my hand through my hair.  “It hadn’t even occurred to me that the pot would make a difference.”
Small bubbles were forming on the surface of the liquid in it, popping and fading away.
, “green jack,”
There.  He was there.  Bent over his workbench, half obscured by the vapours rising from his retorts.
He set his cup down and smoothed the paper out.  “Prime Minister Winston Churchill knighted,” he read out.
Mrs Hudson beamed.  “Mrs Turner will be so pleased.  She’s been wanting to show off her crêpes for you…but a good fry-up first, I think,” she said, tapping a finger against her cheek and considering me.
Sherlock crumpled the napkin.  “I never forgave any of them for that or for what they did next.”
His approach was more direct, but would not be an easy one for me to use alone as Mr Holmes had had to stretch onto his toes to press a brass point at the tip of the longest sunbeam carved into a scene of a sun setting behind wooded hills.  His route would provide a more scenic view, he had said.
I had tunes for opening and unlocking, but I’d never tried it on a door Sherlock had made secure.
I reached back to turn the lamp on again.   My fingers dipped into hot wax instead.  I hissed and raised them to my mouth, cooled them against my tongue.  The glow of the extinguished wick faded to a pinpoint and disappeared.  I rubbed my fingers together.  The cold wax crumbled and fell.
“Well, Inspector Lestrade is downstairs again.  He said it’s a special case,” Mrs Hudson said.
“As far as he knew, it was,” Sherlock said, stepping closer and lowering his voice.  “He’s never sampled your blood.”
Also, it was in the kitchens, I had met the elusive others who dwelt in the Manor, consistently or occasionally, and who were, therefore, my patients.  Billy and his nephew, Archie, who made the gardens grow, were often to be found there and eager to tell tales of their leafy domain, or in Archie's case, the latest botany or biology exam for which he was studying.  Wiggins and members of the Irregulars would flit in and out between their errands and information gathering all over the city and sometimes beyond.  They were less likely to share a story, obviously accustomed to silence and invisibility.  Discretion was clearly their watchword and I was new.  I would patch them up or prescribe a medicine or ointment if necessary when I encountered them, but they did not seek me out.  Thus, day by day, the roster of my patients had grown.  As well as sharing a meal and conducting an impromptu surgery, there was always history to be learned in the kitchens and they had many doors.  I was still learning where they were and where they all went.
“Nothing so pedestrian,” he replied, settling his weight more fully along my back.
John opened his eyes wider and tried working his mouth.  “Yeah,” he said on the second try.  “Thank, thank you.  I’ll do it now.”
Sherlock’s fingertips ran across the image of the man’s forehead.  “Live, brave soldier, and come to me.  Bring your unquenchable light to me.”
“Right,” Greg said.  “I’m making coffee.  The traffic was hell.”
Corvus did as bid and I shook the pages from the envelope and commenced to read them aloud, starting with the heading of the firm of solicitors, as I know all such details have meaning for Holmes.
“Not swimming,” he replied and gestured with his head away from their island towards the open water.
I settled back on the heels of my feet.  “I can swim.”
John resumed his surveillance.  “Damn, the tree’s blocking my view now.”
“For a few days,” I agreed.  My eyes closed.
Mumbling my assent, I lowered my gaze and took to lifting covers off of dishes to hide my expression.  Surely, I was scarlet at that point.
I didn’t answer.
He had moved on from port to tea and regarded me over the rim of his steaming cup.  “Mr Knight surely was not so fortunate as to have one in residence.”
At least my curiosity had been satisfied and I had revelled in watching Holmes scintillate as he identified one false trail after another until only a single clear path to the truth had remained.  There had been amazement expressed, freely by some and grudgingly by others of the various scions of the house, to the extent that I had found myself standing so close to Holmes during such exchanges that those among his new admirers who might have essayed to demonstrate how impressed they were by more than words of praise or an increase in the fee proffered, were effectively deterred, as were the perpetrators of the vicious misdeeds from expressing their consternation at having been caught out.
I’m not trained for everything yet.
“Wow,” John said, looking for somewhere to set the bag.  “What’s the occasion?”  He opted for a chair.
He nodded.
Holmes shook his head, which was a strong indication that they were not from London.
,” Mycroft murmured, “the chimney sweeper.  You saw the speck of soot in the key’s ornamentation.”
"An avenue to explore.  Mustn't theorise ahead of the facts," he murmured.
I didn’t know what I was doing.
Directions in lab notebook for overseeing experiment in progress, enter findings at indicated intervals.  Expect to be back in two to three days.  Mrs Hudson can acquaint you with  more of the house in the meantime.  Make yourself at home.  SH
“The wine will soon be poured, the candles lit.”
"Oh," I murmured again and looked across to the hearth.
"Where?"  I needed to run my hands over him to understand.  I stepped forward.
“But it wasn’t,” I persisted.
She held out her hand to him.  He took it in both his hands and pressed his lips to it then his cheek before slowly letting go.  She drew her hand away, stroking his face on the way to grasping the horse’s reins.
He nodded.  “Willow’s like that, but these were especially fast.  I think they like it here.”
Sherlock ruffled John’s hair then slid his hand down his back to his bum and squeezed.  “I can think of a few.”
“You’re taking the swan’s part,” Sherlock observed.
I had no idea when it was nor why it was there.
“Black, black, black is the colour of my true love’s hair,
“One,” Sherlock replied, “but several unexplained deaths aboard passenger and cargo vessels departing from there.”
“I never heard a story about this,” I said.
I pressed my fist against my mouth and shut my eyes against the memory of Sherlock folding in on himself while the shadows edged towards the fragile outline of our unfinished design.
The second photo was from several minutes later.  Ms Swann was ripping bread from the loaf she held, two swans stretching their necks forward, beaks open for the next morsel.  Past her left shoulder, the woman with the camera could be seen approaching, her grin wide.
I resolved to go round to the places I had seen as soon as possible, to reinforce what I had learned.  If someone was injured or taken ill, it would not do for me to lose time taking wrong turns en route.  Perhaps in the evening, Sherlock would have time to finish the tour that Detective Inspector Lestrade’s business had interrupted.
“Am I seated too close?” Sherlock asked.
“Were you experimenting on us?” I teased.
I smoothed back his hair, traced a circle at his temple.  He must have been exhausted to fall asleep like this.
The log had burnt steadily and my jacket was fairly dry when I heard the clop of hooves and the rumble of cartwheels over stone.  I took leave of my host and pressed the mints into his hand.  He seemed pleased.  He did not slip a knife between my ribs on my way out, in any event.
I love the ground whereon he stands.”
Ice crystals fell on me.  The breeze caressed my face.
I do and a bit thrilled, to be frank.
Arms closed around me.
“Have you seen the ballet in the past year?” Sherlock asked.
feel it means?” he replied, his thumbs stroking the inside of my wrist, seemingly absentmindedly, as he continued to peer at the two circlets.
I didn’t want to let go of it.
“Reginald, that’s the cousin.  Popular name in their family.  Mrs Turner’s given name is Regina.  Anyway, Reginald thought the carton must have belonged to a vampire because they live for centuries, and this one kept newspaper articles tucked away about his most famous victims, but they got used for wrapping up his things when…”
“And delicious,” Sherlock said and covered his mouth.  He had lips.  It was a good sign.  Mycroft’s interest in John was not.
Corvus lifted his cup and took a sip.
“So you were able to deduce that two people that you had never seen were having sex at a particular time in a location at some distance from where you were?” John asked.
I walked to where Sherlock crouched a few paces from the headless corpse.  There was an arm and a lower leg bearing obvious bite marks along their length and the white of bone at their ragged ends.
He smiled, glancing at the mess about me.  “Did they put up a struggle?” he asked.
“Bad luck for the publisher,” I remarked, opening wads of newspaper and shaking them out before I shoved them into the recycling bag.  Old habits.  I glanced at Sherlock.
“It’s also dangerous,” he added, leaning back on one hand.  It let more of what light there was reach the bangle as he twirled it between his fingers.  The delicate chiming of gold against gold increased.  Its little chains whirled outwards from one rim of the cuff.  There were markings around the outside.  I couldn’t see what they were.
Finally, I succumbed to the aroma and did the same.
I took the bag from him and slung it over my shoulder.  “What’s that?” I asked, raising my chin at the other item
“That building that comes to a point at the end of the road.  I’ve always wondered if they have views into the park from the upper floors, so when Mrs Turner said there was an estate sale on the top floor, I was keen to go.”  She picked up the jar of marbles on the table and turned it around slowly.
“There’s music,” I said, “over there.”  I attempted to point, but my arm had fallen asleep as well, so the motion was more a flopping in the general direction of the sounds.  I wiggled my fingers.  The plants had let go, except for one tendril I could still feel around one wrist.  As I continued to flex my fingers, it slipped away.  Apparently, they didn’t bear me a grudge for my pruning.
"Interesting."
Chapter 1 prompts: 1 & 2 ('Tis the season and Bells)
“And...” Mike prompted.
No one stood around the fire.  Everyone had found a place to sit and await the dawn.  There was still a hum in the air, but much softer than before.
“Fine,” he said.  “I’ll go back to Baker Street.”
“And the plague pits are to the south and east anyway,” Sherlock remarked.
Sherlock thrust a pillow between me and the railing, and urged me to bend lower.  The wind ruffled my hair.  The snow was wet and cool against my cheek.
He gestured towards the open window.  “Well, there it is.  Perpetual summer.”
All my fingers found among the tufts of the cushions were more pieces of the pearly stone, some smooth, some jagged, but no knife.
surprise feels.”
I considered his expression.  I’d aroused his sympathy it seemed to me.  I wasn’t certain what emotion the next chapter would evoke.
Sherlock watched me.
She emptied hers in turn and handed it to me.  “I’ll save your seat.”
We continued until he hung the bag over the bank where I could see it.  It was indeed bulging with my harvest.
I kept up my humming; the brambles were thick.  Otherwise, my cloth would have been in shreds after a few more steps.  Faster and faster we went, the smell of crushed berries rising from beneath our feet.
He turned his gaze back to Sherlock, but seemed to continue addressing me.  “I’ve been waiting for an answer from him for years, but he’s such a difficult butterfly to pin down.”
