He'd figured as much earlier. Still, ugh. “What about me?”
“Sorry, honey,” Mom said softly as she reached across the table and rested her hand on his. “I'll stop teasing. I'm just excited for you. Eighteen's a big deal, you know? It'll be good for you, I just know it. You'll finally have a friend!”
And then a gust of wind blew by and he realized with a shock of embarrassment that he was… totally buck ass naked.
“How are you feeling today?” Cas asked. “Death, rebirth, everything?”
Soothingly, Cas pressed another soft kiss to Dean's lips, “I do,” he promised, honesty in every word, warmth laced through them. “You know it was me, too.” He dragged his lips along Dean’s cheekbone, and whispered hotly in his ear, “I can feel you, Dean. Trust me.”
Quietly, he sank into the seat next to Sam and kept his head down, hoping they'd all keep their questions and advice or whatever to themselves if he didn't look up but no such luck. His mom cleared her voice and Dean suppressed a sigh. He glanced up at her and almost sighed again at the huge smile on her face.
Maybe there was a binding spell or something? If Dean had been lucky enough to have been born with magic he might’ve been able to capture the creature right then and there. Unfortunately for him, Sam had gotten all the magical talent in their family.
High, breathy, urgent,
Bright blazing red script behind his eyelids woke Dean up on a gasp—Castiel Novak scrawled in lazy handwriting, and then a red-tinted flash of his face, not that Dean needed it to recognize the name.
Cas’s eyes’d gone all soft, and then he’d grabbed Dean’s face and kissed him so achingly sweet. “Are you serious? Of course I love it!”
Dean sent him back and then another in quick succession:
“Yeah. It cornered me, and it was coming fast. I panicked. Climbed out a window, but my rifle snagged and the strap must've been fraying because it ripped right off and—god. I'm never gonna live this down. Dean's gonna tell everyone when we get back to camp.”
Another glow of warmth filled Cas’s chest. “I don't mind at all.”
At three-thirty he pulled up in front of Cas’s house. From the outside, it looked like any other one storey ranch style house—grey siding combined with lighter grey masonry, white trim and white columns that supported the roof over the front porch. Dean climbed out of his car and walked across the green grass of Cas’s lawn. Beneath the sleeve of his olive green jacket, he fiddled with the cuff he’d already locked onto his wrist.
“I… I’m pretty flexible.” The look Cas gave him was an exasperated sort of fond that Dean was extremely used to garnering. He smirked shyly. “Whatever you want to do with me.”
The corners of Cas’s mouth twitched up. “Super single?”
“So…”
As it was, he ended up with his sketchbook in his lap and his headphones in his ears. Listening to Dead Kennedy's as he drew. Color pencils glided over the paper and after a while he was staring down at Dean's face, those shy downcast eyes and dark pink stained cheeks. Just as he put the finishing touches on Dean's freckles—and boy was that a detailed job—his phone buzzed in his lap.
One of Dean’s palms curled around the base of Cas's hard cock and held it still while he leaned forward and licked teasingly over the head with the flat of his pink tongue. Cas’s thighs trembled with the effort of remaining still, blood gone hot at the sight of Dean swirling and flicking his tongue around the tip.
“Not Dean’s fault,” Cas interrupted, gaze hard. “It was mine.”
Dean sighs and tilts his head one way then the other in an effort to relieve the tension already gathered in his shoulders and neck. The parking garage where he’s been given a spot up front is dim, and he takes a moment to close his eyes and center himself.
“Good. Let’s do this.”
Dean’d played hooky as long as he could, but his mom’d finally caught on that his sudden case of the flu wasn’t viral so much as it was completely fake. She’d gotten that sad worried look on her face and gave him a patented mom talk designed to make him feel better about whatever was making him upset. It was meant to encourage him to open up to her, but he couldn’t.
“It’s over, Dean,” Cas said, face almost glowing in the flickering blue light of Dean's flames, his eyes too-bright, too-blue. “Come on, baby, you have to stop now. Push it back down. Let me help,” he reached out his hand, but Dean shook his head and stepped quickly out of reach.
He kept still in the shadows for a few moments planning his approach and then he slowly walked closer, keeping to the darkness as much as he could. The shadowlight remained oblivious, and Dean thanked his lucky stars, ’cause it looked like Sam’s potion was working.
And if you really, really enjoyed maybe rec it, or check out my other 60+ works.
Greedily, Dean rapidly uncapped it and pursed his lips around the mouth, he chugged the water down in big swallows. Around the bottle when he caught Cas watching the bob of his throat with rapt fascination, Dean smirked.
He watched the wheels in Dean's head spin like they couldn't get traction and then all at once flight or fight seemed to kick in and he rushed out of the cafeteria without a second glance, head down as he just left everything behind.
Dean's brain takes a minute to catch up, but when it does, “Shit. Yeah, okay. Fuck.”
He bit his bottom lip, watching with singular focus as Dean popped the button on his jeans, and he swore he heard every metallic tooth give on his zipper as Dean’s fingers deftly worked it down.
The cabin was packed. People clustered in groups talking and laughing, and although they made an effort to include Cas in their discussions, his one word answers and lack of interest in small talk soon left him on the outskirts—his goal ever since Dean had announced Friday nights were a “big deal” at camp and he’d been dragged along to the party in borrowed clothes on Dean’s enthusiasm.
As soon as Cas cut the roll off with a pair of safety scissors he’d retrieved from his bag, and smoothed down the last bit of it, a thrill went through Dean. It surprised him a little, just how much trust he placed in Cas, but maybe it shouldn’t have. Even if it’d been a long time since he’d been around Cas before this trip home, there were so many ways that Cas hadn’t changed. He was still dependable, still clearly cared about the people in his life—the kind of person that caretaking came naturally to. They were alike in that way. Usually Dean found it hard to let go of his responsibilities, of his need to be in total control … but there was something unique to Cas that made him want to submit. That made him want to let go.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Because I love you, you insufferable idiot. I'm not going anywhere. I haven't intended to for some time.”
lots of love for her beautiful art. <3
He licked slow and broad over Dean's rim, and they both groaned. Dean tasted so much sweeter, impossibly better, than he smelled. Dean’s hand flew down to rake through Cas’s hair. Cas hummed as he pressed his face in closer, lips sucking gently at Dean's hole before he flicked his tongue against it in gradually deepening passes.
Dean. There's no trace of Michael remaining on him and that's just not—
Until every time Cas blushed and stuttered at something Dean said, he wondered what Cas would be like in bed. His main characters were so dominant and take charge. Was that what Cas was like? Or what he liked in a partner? Which role would Dean rather play with him? God, he could just imagine Cas's face all stern and commanding, telling Dean to get on his knees for him and—
The next morning Mary woke slowly, stretched in the morning light that flooded in through her bedroom window. She cuddled down under the covers, into the warmth of John’s body next to her. Hazy with sleep, it took her a long second to remember why something felt off—wrong with this picture.
Dean would talk if a teacher called on him, though it was extremely rare for teachers to ask him anything at all in class. Like some sort of silent understanding that Dean shouldn't be put on the spot. The last time Cas recalled having actually heard him speak out loud was in sixth grade when they were in the same class.
Dean laughs into the kiss, and leans back, loving the sparkle in Cas's eyes, the affection. Hell, “Love you too.”
“You may as well dive right in. I’ve got a tight deadline I need to meet today. Procrastination is not my friend.” Cas sighed and brushed a hand through his thick brown hair, leaving it in adorable disarray.
“Yeah… well… still not exactly the same, and—”
First of all, lemme just say
For the most part he kept things casual. During the war he hadn't wanted any long term connections; he hated the idea of leaving someone behind if he died. He just wasn't worth that kind of pain.
“What for?” Cas asked as Dean handed it over.
“Shut up,” Dean mumbled, a renewed flush spreading across his cheeks and the back of his neck.
“Please, Cas,” Dean panted, “C’mon, touch me. Ah, touch me, Cas.”
“That you Dean?” Sam called from the back, followed by a clatter and a swear.
“Neither did I, so how about we shelf the ‘I’m sorry’s?” Dean studied Cas’s face while Cas scrutinized him right back.
“Yeah, we’re that,” Dean agreed with a smile at Bobby’s long suffering sigh.
Dean's brow furrowed as he tried to figure out where exactly Sam had gone off script. His gaze landed on the library across the street from the picked over hardware store Sam was
That fond look on Dean’s face was much too tempting. So Cas leaned in and kissed him. Just a slow, gentle press of their mouths together, a slight cling of their lips as he pulled away. The mildly dazed expression Dean wore when his eyelashes eventually fluttered open was just as appealing, it turned out.
“Yeah. You wanna take upstairs or down here?” Dean asked, nose involuntarily wrinkled. Every mildly germaphobic bone in his body practically screamed at having to go deeper into this unkempt mess. Not to mention how awful it smelled in here. Faint traces of their dad’s once familiar scent mixed with a host of disgusting smells that Dean tried not to focus too closely on identifying.
Dean’s gaze dropped to the side as he leaned back against the wall. “For what it’s worth, I really like you too.”
“Dean, look at me,” Cas gently requested, lips twitching up in a tiny smile when Dean did. “Who tutored me in Calculus for free when he was in college and way too cool to be spending two evenings a week with his kid brother’s dorky friend?”
“Fuck, Dean.”
Rapidly, Dean’s temperature soared as the taste and scent of Cas jacked up his arousal. He wanted to get closer to Cas, needed it. So he pressed himself into the hard line of Cas’s body and let him feel just how turned on he was for the second time that day.
“Please,” Dean begs, hands clenching in the sheets at his sides while Castiel trails wet, biting kisses along his jaw, down his neck. All Dean can focus on his the pleasure coursing through him, the sweet smell of Castiel’s slick making him dizzy with longing. “Wanna taste you so bad. Fuck, smell so good, Cas.”
Then he waited for something to happen. Some sign from Cas that he was willing to take this whole game they had going on further than flirting. Too bad Cas just stood there, rooted to the spot, ‘cause this was about as far as Dean worked himself up to in planning. He sort of expected to be pounced on by now. Here he was, pretty much offering himself up on a silver platter, and he could see Cas salivating, but he wasn’t doing a damn thing about it.
He didn't say a thing, just watched Dean with his head inclined slightly to the side, face blank.
It was a trick, that was all. Designed to evoke sympathy in Dean, but he knew better. Disgust curled up his lip and he glowered at Cas. “I'll be back for you in the morning,” he swore, voice rough with the hatred seething in his gut. “And then I'm gonna make you talk, whatever it takes. I'm not sure why you're working with Stormridge, but it doesn't surprise me. I told you to stay the hell away, Cas. You shoulda listened.”
The way he'd spiraled out of control, and then finally got his shit together—just a little—replays itself while he stares sightlessly, absorbing the music.
and every bit of Dean's behavior for the last several months clicks into place—all of the fussing, the trying too hard.
down to his core that Dean was a good person.
Sam hissed and Dean grinned, conversation successfully averted.
Despite the thick tension from his family actually holding back their prying for once, though Dean had no idea why, they got through breakfast with some small talk from everyone but Dean. When he finished the last salty-sweet bite of sausage, he took his dishes to the sink and rinsed them off before he put them in the dishwasher.
Cas is already in his worn out armchair, a lit smoke between his full pursed lips when Dean walks in the door. It’s sticky summer hot outside, and he’s been waiting all day for Cas to get off work. Half-hard since he woke up this morning from another dream about Cas’s hands on his skin, tangled up in his hair as he bent him over his couch and fucked him just the way he liked it. Pretty much for forever, he’d had a thing for their neighbor, but Cas never noticed him. Probably because he was just a kid with a crush, and besides Cas never pays attention to anyone on their street, anyway. He ain’t exactly social.
Eyes shiny and brows pushed together when he pulled back, Sam cleared his throat before he answered, “I’m okay, I guess.”
So … they’ll deal with that. Later. Together.
Satisfaction about how well-fucked he sounds rolls through Dean's gut. He loves that even after all this time he can still make Cas come so hard that he can't form words for minutes after.
He flopped onto his back and stared up at the white paint on his ceiling. Sending Cas home had been the right decision, damnit. This wasn’t a real relationship, it wasn’t gonna last—and if he let himself pretend it could, he’d fall for Cas harder and faster than a gale force gust of wind. Cas was a great guy, gorgeous, amazing in bed. There was a lot to like. It wasn’t a stretch for Dean to recognize just how dangerous that could be to his heart.
happen again.” Balthazar looked at him like he was trying to force his conviction into his mind.
“Mom,” Dean complained, concern replaced with a tiny flash of irritation as Sam snickered.
(See the end of the chapter for
As soon as Cas was close enough, Dean grabbed onto the straps of his harness, supple leather soft, and pulled him inside. He shut the door behind them and crowded Cas back against it with an urgent kiss. The pressure of Cas’s lips as they gave beneath his so damn perfect. For a flash, Dean had control, and then Cas’s hand gripped the back of his hair, angled him a little, and then he expertly fucked Dean’s mouth with his tongue.
He can't speed Cas up, he can't make time turn faster—and right now, with the way Cas has him positioned he can't even
“Look so good, baby,” Dean says, fingers sliding in and out, slow, purposely grazing Cas's prostate with the tips on every pass.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas’s other eyebrow rose, this time definitely surprise. Dean bit his lip and dropped his gaze to Cas’s lap, an unfamiliar shyness fluttering in his chest. Oh. There was a definite bulge in Cas’s fancy suit pants, Dean was pleased to note. Just like that his ego fluffed back up—he was having an effect on Cas.
Cas smirked. “I made
He stopped walking and listened for any sign of her, heart thumping hard, hand straying toward his chestplate. Creeping back further into the woods as silently as he could, Dean was on full alert. His ears strained for any sounds that were out of place, his eyes roved over the shadows lining the path.
Where did that leave them?
Quietly, Cas sighed out his pleasure. It was just so easy to fall into Dean—to let himself enjoy the soft give of his lips, and how Dean’s hands always found their way to tangle in his hair.
. Thanks for your patience, guys. <3<3<3
Sam would be expecting Dean to take back-up tonight, but he wasn’t about to risk the rest of the guard, and besides, he’d barely managed to convince Sam. No chance was he gonna look like an idiot in front of his soldiers.
And then his fingers are
After he'd quickly styled his hair, he headed downstairs to face the torture that was gonna be breakfast. Tomorrow would be infinitely worse but today was gonna suck ass too. He knew before he even made it to the kitchen that the next few days were gonna take a lot of patience to get through, and he tiredly rubbed his hand over his eyes as he steeled himself to face his well-meaning family. Then he headed into the kitchen.
He skids to a stop moments before they do. All three of them tensing for a fight. It could be Michael. He makes a split second decision, and he sees Sam shaking his head before he starts.
Heat flooded Dean’s face and he choked out a laugh while Sam grimaced, “Sure have—”
Dean followed him into the back, careful to keep his hands to himself, and away from the items scattered around Sam's workbench. The little bubbling cauldron there especially.
Besides, if Cas ever actually did try and talk to him, Dean could just do what he always did whenever the rare occasion that people tried to talk to him popped up: be boring until they left him alone again. One word answers and blank stares were always his best bets.
“Dean, can you…” Cas let out a soft gasp as Dean's tongue swirled along the dip in his chin.
Skin slapped against skin, their moans rose in pitch and he could feel Cas’s heart racing against his back, could feel sweat dripping from Cas’s forehead onto the shoulder he rested his head on. Dean’s thighs trembled with effort as he bucked back into Cas’s thrusts, body tingling and euphoric every time Cas hit that perfect spot, shaking.
A flash of movement caught Cas's eye, then another. They'd been lulled into a false sense of safety, and now they were about to be caught off guard. Cas glanced around fast, noting several more creatures stalking them from behind and the sides, circling in. Sam went rigid beside him, following his line of sight. His fingers tightened on his rifle.
This is Dean’s first summer back from college, nineteen now, and he’s filled out a bit since he was home last. A little taller, and broader, arms more defined. Something about him had finally caught Cas’s notice earlier this summer when Dean was looking for odd jobs and he’d gotten what he’d wanted for so damn long.
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist. I’m perfectly happy the way things are. Like I said, it passes the time. I fully enjoy myself,” Balthazar said with a cocky smile on his face. “Sometimes several times a night.”
A breathy little gasp of Cas’s name escaped when Cas tightened his grip, dragging his palm along the length of Dean’s cock a few times. So good that Dean was already biting his lip, quiet moans catching in the back of his throat, eyes half-lidded and focused on Cas’s up close. Softly, once, Cas kissed him, just gentle pressure and then his hand slid back up. He opened Dean’s belt one handed, and fuck that was hot. The hiss of leather against denim as Cas pulled his belt free of his jeans shivered down Dean’s spine.
“Ah … ah … God, Cas, fuck. I’m gonna—” Dean’s back bowed and he bit down hard on his lip. White teeth dug deep into tender reddened flesh as he came; warm splashes that painted Cas’s already too-hot skin. He twitched and shook in Cas’s hands, hissed,
Whatever Dean's plan had been, the answer was no. Cas was
didn’t remember Cas smelling this good, but then, he didn’t remember him looking so damn alpha either.
Teasingly, Cas slid his cock along the crease of Dean's ass. He grazed over his hole twice and Dean was hypersensitive, shaky. He rubbed the tip of his dick in circles around Dean's rim until Dean's legs shook with desperation. Then, slowly, so fucking slowly he finally lined up and pushed steadily inside of Dean, blunt pressure filling him in a wet, wet slide. “Cas,” Dean sighed, voice momentarily pausing in the middle as Cas ground forward, pressed all the way in, and still tried to get deeper.
The puppy eyes Sam turned on him would’ve made a lesser man crumble, but Dean’d gotten used to them a long time ago. He was practically immune to it by now.
Tone unreadable, Dean finally answered, “You don’t have to. I mean, you have work in the morning right?”
Dean grinned at him, face flushed with heat. It was an absurdly good look on him. "Hiya, Cas. What's up?"
“Magic hands that were
Dean shook his head. “Yeah, no. Bet I’d remember that.”
Sam’s face brightened a little, the same excitement he always showed whenever he was talking about magic and research. “The rope’ll glow soon as you get it on the shadowlight. It might fight for a minute or so, try to break free, but as long as you keep ahold of the rope the magic’ll kick in. The shadowlight will be forced to shift into its natural form, and won't be able to access it's magic at all."
Dean’s lips pursed in the tiniest pout and he glanced over his shoulder. And Cas knew, he
“Yes, sir,” Dean managed, just above a whisper. He wanted it so goddamn bad.
“Hello, Sam. I—” Cas finally seemed to notice that he was still holding onto Dean, and he let his arms drop to his sides. “Yes.”
Too soon, Cas pulls away. “Do you know what I thought about the entire time I was gone? Every night when I was lying in my dorm room twin-size bed, wrapped up in whatever hoodie I swiped from your floor on my last visit, and missing you?”
“Shame,” Cas lamented. “I enjoy watching you even more than most people.”
“I didn't want to leave him. I didn't… but Hannah needed me. And then she was gone too,” Cas said miserably. “So I couldn't stay in the place she died. And I had nowhere to go. And I swore I'd never let someone matter to me as much as they did. That I'd never hurt like that again.” Cas broke off, and went quiet. Dean waited for him to say more, and the minutes stretched on. He didn't know what to say.
Nodding, Dean tried and failed not to notice how good Cas looked out here in the middle of all this green and color with the sun brightening his gorgeous blue eyes, bringing a hint of pink to his high cheekbones. “Big shoes to step into,” he agreed. “But I’m up for it. You’re in good hands,” Dean tried, he really, really did, not to let his voice dip a little as he said it, but flirting was second nature and he couldn’t help the innuendo he infused it with.
Cas leans down, mouth just barely touching Dean's. Keeping his hands from reaching for Cas, from sliding over all that tanned toned bare skin takes monumental effort. Not tilting his head up to make Cas kiss him even more so.
“Tell me everything,” he demanded.
Cas's eyes locked with Dean’s, and he got totally lost in the way Dean’s widened a little, his cheeks flushed bright pink. Dean shyly bit down on his full bottom lip but he didn’t look away, and Cas was charmed. Dean's eyes were curious and so green, his hand white knuckled on his bottle of coke.
Cas got through his shower as quickly as he could, and dressed in a pair of blue plaid pajama pants and a dark grey Henley. He gathered the clothes up from the floor, and let Dean know he’d be right back.
“Very serious,” Dean said, then flushed darker, eyes dropping to Cas’s chest. “If you wanna. I just… I love you. I want you.”
Cas skimmed his teeth along the length of Dean’s shaft, making him tremble and whine low in his throat. Cas’s fingers skated around behind Dean, and tugging his panties to the side, he slid two of his fingers into Dean. He was wet enough that it was an easy stretch and glide that felt
“I almost—” Dean's voice cracks and he squeezes his eyes shut.
Cas grabbed onto his wrist and Dean looked up; they were surrounded by soldiers, guns drawn on them. Inside, Dean was finally panicking a little but he didn't let the people who surround them see that. He didn’t let Cas see it. God, he never should’ve let Cas come with him. How was Dean supposed to protect him now?
Last week, John’d suggested that they cancel their plans to go camping because of Mary’s ‘state’ and well, that’d rubbed her the wrong way. She was pregnant not bedridden. Just because she got nauseous sometimes didn’t mean she couldn’t still go have
Cas scrutinized him, gaze flicking between Dean’s eyes, like he could see exactly what Dean was thinking. The back of Dean’s neck burned, and he rubbed at it.
Over the years, Dr. Lafitte taught him how to keep himself calm in appointments that started out daily but had tapered off to once weekly as he'd gotten older and while Dean’d had a few close calls, he was lucky enough that he'd never had another incident.
that lances his gut. He
That draws a whine from the back of Dean's throat that he had no hope of controlling. “Yeah, fuck. Want that so bad, Cas. Missed your cock inside me so much.”
“So how was your first time?” Cas asked gently.
The downstairs portion of Sam’s place was split into two large rooms; the front was his store, where he sold items he'd enchanted, and potions he'd brewed to the public. The back was where he did his research and prepared the items he sold.
Dean woke before the sun like he always did, but instead of rolling out of bed, getting himself a breakfast of dry cereal, and sitting on the porch to listen for monsters growling beyond the high fences they'd erected, he stayed in bed. Cas was still fast asleep beside him, face half-smooshed into the pillow, dark hair everywhere. Dean’s heart stuttered. He’d spent the night with his fair share of people, before and after the end, but he’d never woken up next to someone and felt his stomach swoop like this.
Grumpily, Cas glared at her, but Charlie just sat back up in the chair and bumped her shoulder against his, “So, what's up with you two? Why the sudden interest? Was it love at first sight when you gave him his backpack back?”
Dean was pretty sure he was blushing harder than he ever had in his life. This was so not how he expected any of this to unfold, but he couldn’t deny the fact he was pleased. There was a warm sensation in his chest that he was sick of fighting down. So he finally let himself grin right back at Cas. “Yeah—I—that sounds… I’d love that, Cas.”
“It’s been so long since I’ve had it, I’m not sure I could tell,” Cas admitted, pausing to savor the smell of the coffee before sipping at it. The expression on his face was priceless; a man seeing the face of God. Dean had to bite his lip to keep from laughing.
“Cas, meet Dean, world's biggest pain in the a—oh my god.” He slapped himself hard in the face, turning beet red, and Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “Ugh gross. I didn't need to scar myself for life and yet I did. Can we just go home now?”
“He told me his next stop was here and that I should check it out when I was done; that there were lots of good books left upstairs.”
“Dean,” Cas gasped just as a blinding blue light blazed so brilliantly it forced his eyes closed.
It’s not the sunshine that wakes Castiel in the morning. It’s not some romantic light warming his face. It’s Dean’s half-choked snore. Castiel chuckles silently as Dean’s breathing beneath his ear resumes its quiet rumble, chest rising and falling evenly.
The truth, though, is that he’s so far under Dean’s skin that it’s crazy. Dean’s five seconds away from qualifying his dick as classically conditioned to respond to Castiel even glancing at him. It's making his job hard—pun
Cas trailed his mouth along the path his hand had taken. Pausing to suck matching dark marks over Dean's hip bones, the alpha part of his brain growled out satisfaction. Dean trembled under his lips, so sweetly. Cas was close enough now that the smell of Dean, slick and ready for him was a siren call. He dragged his tongue slowly, wetly along the length of Dean's cock, sucked just the head into his mouth and swirled his tongue around it while he continued to loosely pump the shaft.
All of a sudden there was a loud crack and Dean's power surged free in his chest. He didn’t have time to put two and two together, or wonder why the hell he was suddenly unbound, he just grabbed onto Lilith's arm and unleashed everything he had. Burning so fucking hot, he couldn't control it. Lilith lit up from the inside like a goddamn Roman candle and her grip on his throat dropped away.
Guilt caught up with him, too. Because Dean was probably still upset—he was probably beating himself up over something Cas’d just used to achieve one of the most spectacular orgasms of his life. Which was really saying something, because there was
They’d been thick as thieves all through high school, but he’d assumed they’d lost touch sometime in college like Dean had with most of his own friends. A part of Dean was glad he hadn’t, and that Sam would have some support while they were here since Eileen couldn’t make it. He was relieved that she’d decided to stay with her parents while he and Sam came back.
Longsufferingly, Crowley sighed. “Dean Winchester is a phoenix.”
He had work to do. Such as approving this cover. He finally managed to look away from Dean long enough to evaluate the image. He liked it, but he wasn't entirely fond of the font they'd selected for the title.
socially? If he’d ever heard him talk to someone when he didn't have to?
“Yeah,” Dean replied, breathy.
It might be better if Dean avoided Cas for today. He was still too raw. So Dean didn’t head for his locker like he usually would, he just found his way into class and sat by himself until Mrs. Harvelle showed up shortly before the bell.
are arousing.” Cas's scent matched his words, the sexy musky smell of aroused alpha clearly evident.
There was a darker pink flush to Cas's cheeks than he’d had when he’d walked into the bathroom, his scent sparked deliciously. Like him, Cas was dishevelled, skin damp with sweat, hair stuck up in a way Dean’s fingers itched to comb through. He looked dangerously gorgeous and all sorts of dirty images flashed through Dean’s mind.
do this, damnit. It's what Cas wants, what he deserves.
He narrows his eyes and stomps up the steps.
He flushed, and scuffed his foot. “Well, I did, but uh, it's my first time scavenging on my own, okay? My brother's here too, but I got to go off by myself and what'd I do? I went off target. But me and Jess have been dying to get new books and the library was right there and—”
planet. He's going to make us a new kingdom on earth. A
” Dean's fingertips ache where he's clutching at the blanket above his head, desperately trying to keep himself from grabbing at Cas. “Need, fuck, God. Come in me. Need you to—” Cas grinds in deep, rolling his hips, and gasping through his release. “Yeah, yeah, fuck, Cas. Just like that, fuck.”
The memory of it was hazy, but he could just faintly remember Dean's stumbled words, voice quiet as he’d answered the question. His eyes had been focused on his desk and his hands had been balled into fists by his side. Cas’d had the impulse to wrap his own hands around them to help him calm down. Of course, he hadn't actually done it. There was no sense in bringing even more attention to Dean when he was already blushing under everyone's stares and besides—even in sixth grade Cas'd known he was supposed to be afraid of Dean.
Dean’s cheeks burned and he rushed to his own defense, “I wasn’t—that wasn’t a pick up line. I’m looking for Castiel Novak.”
“Hey,” he says, and Castiel looks down at him, chin tucked, right hand gripping his left forearm, “we don’t have to do this. You can just go back to your room and we can pretend none ‘a this happened.”
“I wasn't—”
We all owe a huge thanks to
Cas was so absorbed in the curve of Dean’s hip, the contrast between the material and his pale thigh that he actually startled when Dean stood up. Cas’s gaze flew from where it was upward, snagging briefly on the impressive bulge in the front of those skin tight shorts, then settled on Dean’s face. The grin Dean shot him was positively feral, and Cas undeniably felt like prey. His heart hammered in his chest, and despite the blessed A/C, he was overheating. And he should definitely have changed out of the dress clothes he’d worn to breakfast with his college friends this morning. He’d already shed his jacket, and it clearly hadn’t been enough.
Stubbornness wasn’t just a Winchester family trait, the Campbell’s had it in spades too. So Mary was sure, that like his mom and dad, her little bean was gonna be a force to be reckoned with. Said stubbornness was the reason that Mary found herself in the middle of the woods, just outside their campsite curled over in the dirt and emptying the contents of her lunch onto the forest floor.
“Better?” he asked, breathlessly.
All morning whenever he was out in the hall between classes, Cas had felt eyes on him. It wasn't new—people looking at him. He'd been told he was good looking enough, had received steady enough offers to go to bed with him, that he knew he was attractive and he tended to draw a lot of attention no matter what he was doing.
“I—spanking, yes. Not the paddle … but I want to, sir.”
God, that's his
For a moment Sam paused, like he was wracking his brain to come up with a reason for Cas's behavior. “Maybe he's just shy?”
“Hey,” Sam said, suddenly back beside Dean. “Looks like it’s clearing out, so we’ll be able to go soon.”
Cas's nose wrinkled, “And, that's about as much as I ever want to know about your sex life.”
Cas’s groan echoed Dean’s. His hand on Dean’s hip tightened bruisingly and Dean wanted more—so much more than this. He tried to pull Cas backwards with him, to lead him inside, but Cas just stubbornly stayed where he was.
Cool black leather stuck to the heated skin of Dean's shins, his knees, and forearms. Cas's wide, scorching hands dragged Dean’s panties down, shifting him to get one leg free, and then the other. Already, Dean missed the satiny feel of them against him. God, he was so hard, cock leaking almost as much as he was dripping slick. Cas’s hands grabbed hard onto Dean's ass cheeks, vividly reminding Dean of yesterday's spanking and the way pleasure-pain had jolted straight to his core.
Cas snugged his fingers tighter, sped up and let his hips roll up into it, breaths stuttering out through his teeth, lip bitten hard as he held back moans out of habit. With his free hand, his fingertips found the handprint shaped scar that Dean’d left on his bicep. Shiny pink and healed already, skin sensitive. He pressed his palm against it and remembered the way it’d felt when Dean came. The blinding blue-hot flash of sensation that’d slammed into him. Pleasure laced with a perfect searing pain that’d left him breathless, stunned with how good it was. The shuddering gasp of his name that’d sounded as if it’d been torn from Dean's throat.
He might not have been as obsessed with them as Sam was, but Dean made it a habit to pay attention to his brother's interests, and when he was nine that was all Sam had read about. Not once that Dean could remember had his books ever listed glowing blue eyes.
There were too many people to figure out who it'd been, and no one was still watching but it left him ruffled and he had to make himself calm down again for long minutes before he unlocked his locker and got on with his day.
“Of course,” Cas replied as his arms wrapped briefly around Sam. “How are you holding up?”
they’re falling apart for.”
Just shy of him, Cas stopped. Close enough that Dean could reach out and touch, if he wanted. Sort of hysterically, he considered just how badly he wanted to touch. His hands curled into fists. Cas smelled like alpha, like comfort, and Dean’s body responded all too easily. He wanted to bury his face in Cas’s neck and smell him up close, wanted Cas to close the space between them and make him forget all of this.
with anyone. All he'd bring someone was heartache and suffering. A lifetime of walking on eggshells and waiting for the other shoe to drop. Who wanted to worry that an argument with their soulmate could result in potential damage to their stuff, or worse: unintended injuries.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Sam frown. “Oh.”
For now, he focused on where he was creeping, careful not to brush against tree branches. The wind whistled ominously, leaves rustling with it, and a few even blew right off and floated wildly on the breeze. He watched them dance in front of him before slowly dropping to the ground.
Just shy of the elevator banks, Dean catches him, strong arms spin Castiel around and pin him up against the wall. And fuck, Dean smells so damn good, looks even better, and Castiel is tired of fighting this attraction he’s been harboring. “Dean.”
Her eyes hardened, but she just nodded her head. “Yes sir.”
“Cas—oh fuck—ah, I’m—”
Shades of blue and green filled up the page, intertwined and climbed up an arm. Shoulder to wrist. In the middle of the bicep, was the pink shape of a handprint. His first try didn't quite come out like he wanted it to, so he sat up and got more comfortable, then flipped to a clean page and started again. This time he got it right.
Dean’s shoulders relaxed, and he smiled a little at Cas. “I have serious doubts that you were ever a scout.”
Maybe things won’t always be this easy, there’s still a lot to figure out; making long distance work, telling Dean’s parents at some point, but he wholeheartedly believes what he’d told Cas. As long as Cas wants him around—this is where Dean wants to be. He loves Cas, and he knows that what they have is special. It’s worth dealing with everything that’ll come along with it because
“I guess not,” Dean mumbled, eyes dropping and cheeks still hot as Castiel’s thumbs stroked over the inside of his wrists.
“Oh yeah? You work from home?”
“Me too,” Cas admitted as he glanced down at his arm.
With a kiss that stole what little breath Dean had left, Cas pushed him back down on the mattress. He sucked at Dean’s bottom lip until it was sensitive, swollen, then he brushed the tip of his tongue along it and made Dean gasp.
I had a lot of fun with this chapter, getting to see a little bit of Dean's self-sacrificing nature and Cas trying to save him from himself. *dreamy sigh*
“Yeah,” he managed, his own voice low enough that Cas's gaze fell to his lips and his fists clenched at his sides. “I'm good. I can … I should go before I … before we—”
Cas pumped his fingers a few times, twisting them in and out, back in, and Dean moaned frantically. He rolled his hips back, fucked himself on Cas's talented, long fingers. So close already, heat coiling in his gut and the base of his spine, body quivering with how damn good he felt.
Satisfaction twitched the corners of Dean's lips up, and he pocketed his phone. If he hurried, he might be able to box up Sam's room before he needed to get himself showered and changed.
“Well you didn't, so brownie points I guess,” Dean paused, and then ignoring the increased burning in his cheeks made himself continue, “I'm glad it was you. I'm… uh, I'm glad it's you.”
“What if you planned to move in with me?” Cas nervously asked, blue eyes wide and focused on Dean’s.
Yet again, Jack's watching cartoons in Dean's room on Sam's laptop. Sam doesn't even complain about his laptop being commandeered though Cas wonders what exactly happened to Jack's laptop, but he doesn't ask. They're all struggling enough without looking for issues.
Dean’s whole body feels strung too-tight. He wants—he just wants—and he knows he’ll get it if he’s patient, he’s just gotta hold out. His eyes drift closed and he feels it right into his core when Cas’s voice, so low and rough, growls his name and forces them open.
most days.”
“Sam, if it
“Aside from all this,” he gestured vaguely, “I've been alright, I guess. What about you? Still running the only bar in town that wouldn't take my fake ID?”
Cas shook his head. He didn't, not anymore. “We should keep up with the others.” He looked up to where Dean was walking with Benny and Jo, focused on the next house.
Once he’d finished sketching it, Cas glanced over at the alarm clock on his nightstand and
His eyes cracked open and he noticed his wrist cuff on the nightstand, a note beside it scrawled in Cas's elegant script. He picked it up and read it;
Months… he'd had months to consider this thing from every angle, to get the pull he felt toward Dean under control. In an attempt to take the edge off, he'd slept with an honestly staggering amount of people. Even for him it was excessive. Which said a lot, because Cas liked to feed often. He liked sex to be a regular occurrence and not just because he needed to. He enjoyed it.
Dean's eyes dropped to the bulge in Cas's jeans. His brows furrowed. Cas hadn't gotten off. “I can take care of that,” he offered as he waved his hand toward Cas's crotch in indication.
“Hey!” Charlie calls out. “It was Meg’s idea to start with. She even found the song.”
was mildly horrifying. In the end, though, it’d be worth it. She just knew it. Inside of her a tiny little life was growing and she couldn’t wait to meet him or her.
on them. The people Dean had been talking with are watching them curiously. Sweat beads up at Castiel’s temples, and Dean’s eyes darken a little, enough that Castiel swallows harshly.
Dean’s eyes dropped to Cas’s sweatpants and his lips formed into a pushed out pout before he decided to play along, tugging his underwear down until his cock bounced free. Boxer-briefs successfully removed, Dean straightened up. His cock pointed up toward his belly, thick and straight, pink-tipped and precome-wet. Fucking perfect. Gorgeous. Cas’s hands itched to touch.
“Spare me the details!” Jo shrieks, laughing and covering her ears.
A laugh bubbled up in his chest at Dean’s narrowed eyes. “A, I’m not sending that. B, I’m pretty sure I can easily defend myself on the short walk to my car. C, shut your face.”
“If it's gross to—”
His family's pain seems to add to his own, and Cas wants to sag under its weight. Instead he sits down beside Jack, and they watch Dean's favorite cartoon show together.
Sam’s hand ran through his hair, shaky. A physical sign of his nervousness to go along with the sour scent of anxiety permeating the air. He tapped his fingers on the letter addressed to him. “One more drink?”
“If you want me, it has to be more than that,” Cas said, then cleared his throat. “I’m not asking for a proposal or anything, but if we’re going to be intimate… I want the chance to get to know you better.”
There was nothing left of the building they were just in. It'd been all of five minutes since Sam had quite literally pulled him from the flames and there was nothing left—that was how fast it’d burned. That was how much power Dean'd been holding back for them. Blue flames had consumed the entire building in moments and rendered it into a pile of ash and debris.
"Sure does, Mr. Novak."

This was huge and life changing and Mary might’ve been silently freaking out about it because holy crap. She was gonna be a mom and John was gonna be a dad. And that was just… a lot to take in. A major shift in their tiny little family. Plus, there was the whole impending process of giving birth. Because
The first few years, Sam's responses to Dean's letters had been short, vague. Dean still had no idea what’d changed two years ago, whether Sam had just matured or if he'd experienced something in particular to cause it, but he actually started talking to Dean again in the letters he sent.
Ten years of being married to Dean has left Cas well prepared for how things run around here, and how busy Dean will be today despite the importance of the date.
“Now, Cas!
Cas lowered his crossbow, stuck his foot in the stirrup on the end, and cocked it again by carefully, meticulously pulling the string back with both hands until it caught. He reached back behind himself and grabbed another bolt, sliding it into the flight groove and nocking it. He'd just finished loading the bow when the kid he'd rescued came cautiously back over to him.
“To what?” Dean asked, edging closer, his hand finding its way to Cas's hip. “Have me half-hard all night, desperate to get you back to my cabin?”
“Took you long enough,” Cas murmurs from beside him, and Dean lazily shifts to look at him. Fuck, he's still so hot, disheveled and sweaty, lips kiss-dark and plush.
“I said naked on your bed,” he murmured, a touch of impatience in his tone.
He’s glad he woke first. It’ll give him time to think. Last night had been … incredible for lack of a better word. He’s never had a partner surrender control to him so completely, and it’d been intoxicating. His body heats at the memory of Dean lying there, hands fisted in the sheets, freckled skin bare, gorgeous, the only thing holding him back Castiel’s command.
Yay!! We're past the halfway point now. Sorry it's been a while, I promise we're working hard to get this out to you guys. <3<3
Dr. Lafitte had done his best to console Dean that day, he'd tried to convince Dean that it wasn't his fault, but even at four Dean knew it was. There was something was wrong with him. Good kids didn't burn down their houses. They didn't almost kill their whole families ‘cause a baby was crying and they couldn't sleep.
“Mhm. Better hurry up or I'll change my mind about lettin’ you outta bed,” Dean informs him.
“Charlie, he's—”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he chants under his breath, everything narrowing down to the feeling of Cas tight and wet and burning hot around his throbbing cock.
“Doing so good, baby,” Cas told him and Dean’s heart raced with the praise, pleasure that spread all through him. “Fuck, your ass looks good pink like this. Can’t wait to see it red.” Cool smooth leather dragged over his heated skin and Dean sighed out his approval.
Another benefit to wearing his armor, aside from its practical use, since it wasn't seeing much of that lately, was that he looked damn good in it. Dean smirked to himself. Getting laid had always come easy for him, but the armor certainly tended to speed things along. Woman, man, didn't matter—Dean turned heads, and he liked it.
A bell dings, and the next thing Castiel knows, he’s pushing Dean into the empty elevator and shoving him against the side wall, pressing his whole body against Dean’s. “Tell me you have a room.”
Cas grunted his name sexy, gravelly, as his knot finally caught and locked them together. He ground forward against Dean and came shuddering into the condom, buried deep inside him.
All softly with his beautiful olive green eyes, Dean looks at him. The song probably causes him to remember it all too, even if he pretends it doesn't. “Ready to get out of here and go home, Prince Charming?”
Cas yanked his underwear down, tucking it beneath the curve of Dean’s ass. And then crowded up against him, knees on the outer side of Dean’s calves, his lips resting just below Dean’s ear. “Is this what you wanted? When you walked in here wearing that skimpy outfit for me, bending over when you knew I was looking? Is this how you imagined it?”
He retreated toward where the cash register was and Dean followed behind him, still at war with himself. Cas grabbed some papers off the counter and turned to face Dean. “Do you—would you be interested in exploring BDSM while you're here?”
“Fuck, Dean. Knew your mouth would be good,” Cas said, strained and sexy as he leaned forward and fucked his tongue into Dean’s mouth, deep and hot and dominating. He pulled Dean’s shirt over his head, and tossed it to the ground.
to be busy with a very charming young man tonight.” Balthazar smirked. “Alright, you caught me, two young men and a gorgeous scottish redhead that I’ve been dying to get in the—” at Cas’s unmoved stare, Balthazar sighed. “But no, yes, I’ll cancel those truly stunning plans to help you, as apparently I’ve become the type of person who gives up perfectly phenomenal foursomes to aid hapless teenage idiots.”
*****
Cas rolls his eyes, and crosses his arms but a smile tugs at his lips. “Tell Benny and Jo I say hi, and I'm sorry they have to put up with you all day.”
“You mean the one with the little teddy bear?” Dad asked with a barely suppressed grin as he looked up from the paper, and Dean shoved a spoonful of cereal into his mouth. “Said 'I wuv hugs’.”
think anything else about Dean that’s complimentary.
“Fuck,” Dean sighs happily when he gradually surfaces. He slowly becomes aware of the sticky mess that he’s made of them both, but he’s still too worn out and warm to care yet.
Dean chuckled. "Gotcha. I'm fine though, I know how to be careful in the heat."
“Christ help me,” Cas muttered, as he noticed Dean’s shirt ride up. Because Dean Winchester… Dean Winchester was wearing lacy black panties. Cas pushed to his feet as a thought occurred to him. He really couldn’t tell, but from where he was standing, those looked very much like the ones on Cas’s latest cover.
With a smile still curling on his lips, he trailed teasing closed mouth kisses along Cas's shoulder, up the side of his neck. A stutter in Cas's breathing and the way his grip on Dean's arm tightened let him know Cas was awake. “Morning,” he whispered into the skin just beneath Cas's ear.
Sam was behind them with Jo and Benny, almost as safe as Dean could make him. It was obvious Dean hated taking Sam out somewhere he couldn’t control enough variables. Hell, Cas hated either of them being out here. He’d gladly have gone by himself if Dean would ever have agreed to such a proposition.
They've been looking for Dean for months—tracking him by the traces Michael has left. There have been bodies, though fewer than they'd expected to find based on Michael's plans. Cas still doesn't know what they're going to do when they catch up to him.
“I’m single,” Cas confirmed. Dean’s smirk morphed into a full on smile.
Softly, Cas brushed their lips together, slipped his tongue into Dean's mouth slow and possessive. Dean's hands clung to his biceps, fingertips digging in. “Climb on the bed for me, okay?”
“I … yeah. I'm … uh, I'm going,” he takes a quick look at Cas, suit all rumpled, lips all swollen and pink, and barely holds back a whimper that tries to escape him. He looks so damn
(See the end of the chapter for
It took awhile, and by the time it finally subsided enough for them to carefully pull apart, they were both starving. So Cas herded Dean into the bathroom for a quick shower where he gently massaged shampoo in his hair. He rinsed it out in between soft, slow kisses that Dean luxuriated in. Once Cas deemed them sufficiently clean, he helped Dean dry off, and then perfunctorily dried himself off.
The brightside was part of the enchantment on Dean’s armor meant it didn't weigh nearly as much as it ought to. Still, sometimes Dean envied the fact that all his brother had to worry about getting ready in the morning was his long, perfectly styled hair.
Castiel’s coming too, the thought hits him like a freight train and he shudders, euphoric and shaky.  When he can finally breathe again, Dean reaches down and tugs on Castiel’s shoulder, “Come here,” he repeats, and Castiel looks up tiredly from where his cheek is rested against Dean’s thigh.
much bleach.”
“Good.”
possibility—that just this once… John might’ve been right. He didn’t say a thing though, when she finally got back to camp and instantly set about brushing her teeth. He just pulled her into his lap when she was done and held her.
Dean’s answering grin is more of a grimace, “Like that’s gonna happen. Button your shirt up. I’ll give you five minutes to yourself. Calm down however you want.”
Leaning against the counter beside Cas, Dean sighs quietly, the warmth of him seeping through the side of Cas's pajama bottoms and Henley. It's a serene, grounding, too brief time. Even the slowest sips of coffee eventually drain their cups.
They quieted down again after that. The darkness and their exhaustion pushed them swiftly to sleep.
Theatrically, Dean rolled his eyes, but he smiled and pressed their lips together.  Then he let his head drop back onto the cushion. His gaze lingered on Cas’s face though—this cautious optimism etched in green, and Cas really wanted to erase the caution in there.
“Yeah, well, I can’t just let it keep wandering around out there doing who knows what. I’ll be by to pick it up after I’m done with my shift,” Dean said, heading for the door. He glanced over his shoulder as he walked outside. “Thanks, Sammy.”
The moment he's inside one scent rises strongly above all the others—old books pages and leather binding—a sensation exactly reminiscent of the sunlight warming his skin in the window seat of his father's library envelops him and pulls him forward. It's comfort and safety, and Castiel recognizes what's happening instantly.
“Cas, ah, now, please,” he begged. “I need it, please, sir.”
“What? I'm not allowed to play too?” Dean teases, letting Cas go and earning himself a borderline pissed glance over Cas's shoulder for not holding on. He pats Cas's ass and watches the look in his eyes morph toward desire. “C’mon. Dinner's gonna get cold and I promise we'll get back to this later.”
Bitter, thick, sludge. That’s what Castiel’s coffee tastes like this morning. It’s disgusting, but he didn’t have time to stop and get a decent one, and God help him—he
Broadly, Sam grinned at him, “I’d ask for a redo, but I remember you kicking Gordon Walker’s ass when you were in highschool and he had like four inches on you.”
It should've been harder. Cas should've fought him. Golden orange light danced over Cas's tanned skin, shadows playing over his unreadable features, and man, the stories were goddamn right—shadowlights
Once he was done there, he drove over to the address Sam had given him. The building was a red brick standalone with big front windows on a street full of Mom and Pop type businesses. He pulled down the narrow alley beside the building, following the sign that informed him parking was available in back. It was just a gravel lot with room for a handful of cars, but there was only Cas’s truck in it at the moment, so Dean parked next to it.
The kid crossed his arms, floppy hair dripping water down in his eyes. “Who says I'm with anyone? I can take care of myself.”
Dean grinned. “Looking for a performance evaluation, Cas?”
“It's just part of what we do.” Dean sent him a lopsided smile and bit down on his lower lip in a way that usually got him whatever he wanted. “Pick up strays here 'n there, some move on, some stay. My dad taught us if we could help people we had an obligation to.”
Castiel’s eyes widen a little when he registers the richness of Dean’s voice, the casual shortening of his name. He clears his throat and offers a quiet, “Hello.”
After wiping his hands clean on a dish rag, Dean pulled on his leather gloves and fastened his bracers, the dimpled stylized steel covered his arms from wrists to elbows, a decorative band of braided metal around the edge, matching those on the rest of his plated armor.
The squeak of the front doors opening behind him prickled along his skin and left him hyper-aware. “Sammy?” he called out.
Surprisingly, John and Mary were cool about it. Even though Mary was pale from worry she’d winked at them, and said that she couldn't imagine separating them after an ordeal like that. Cas had smiled through his exhaustion, and then Mary had sent them all up to bed for some much needed rest.
Closing his eyes, Dean dug his teeth into his bottom lip, let out a slow breath, and then steeled his nerve, looking up into Cas’s unreal eyes. “Would, um, I want you to spank me. In my panties. And… and then pull ’em down and fuck me.”
At first.
She huffed at him, then nudged the side of his face before she jumped off the bed, and pointedly glanced at the latched window. With a groan, Dean peeled himself from his bed, and let her out.
The pressure of Cas’s hand in his hair set his pace. And fuck, when Cas’s hips started rolling up into it, Dean’s dick ached with how hard he was for Cas. How much he fucking loved it. His own hips shifted, seeking friction where there was none, and finally Cas yanked him back, pulling him off.
“Huh.”
Cas nodded, a firmly decisive gesture. "Yes, very much so."
not to come. “Cas if you … ah, if you keep—I'm gonna—”
“You did what you had to, Dean. You didn't have a choice. Lilith forced you into that situation, and if you don't feel guilty about it, then good. You shouldn't have to feel bad about saving us.” Cas paused to sort his thoughts and let that sink in. “But if the shock of everything wears off, and you end up feeling bad, that's okay too. Just talk to me, okay?”
Dark brows drew down in confusion. "Are you the landscaper? Dean Winchester?"
“Hmm.”
It was dark out when they got to the abandoned warehouse they were instructed to show up at. Foreboding. And Dean figured he oughta be scared. He oughta be, but he wasn't. An eerie calm’d settled over him.
“Cas, mmm, hard. Make me feel it.”
“’Cause I know,” Dean insisted, voice harsher than he meant it to be. He
Sam shakes his head harder and Jack's eyes well up with tears. “Cas, no.”
“Fuck that was,” Dean trails off, thinking about what just happened, eyes widening when he recalls what he said—and what Cas didn't.
“It's okay if you don't believe it right now,” she told him sympathetically. “Can't tell you how many times I tried to talk him into just tellin’ the two of you he was sorry. But.…”
"So perfect for me, Dean. You look so good like this, Mmm. You have no idea.” Cas’s hand ran down his back, a fiery trail of heat remaining in its wake. With both of his hands, Cas dug his fingers into Dean’s ass cheeks, massaging them for a moment before he spread them open. “Soaking wet already, aren’t you? Can’t wait to see how slick you get before I even get my fingers in there.”
Cas chuckled, because Charlie had said basically the same thing once. He grinned at Dean. “You’re all right.”
with a sick certainty
For a second, Cas just considers him and there’s this warm weight that always presses itself on Dean’s chest whenever Cas does that,
Cas’s hand slid down Dean’s arm on its way back to his side. His blue eyes sparkled, a little mischievous. “Good. I seem to remember you were always the stronger Winchester.”
If he didn’t hurry up he’d be late. He threw off the covers and grabbed a pair of socks from his drawer, quickly yanked them on and then grabbed his sketchbook from the bed.
“You’re kind of a wallflower, huh?” Dean asked, a faint smirk on his handsome face.
“Because, Charlie, he needs a slow build up or he'll freak out. And I think he'll run. I'm not prepared to lose him,” Cas answered, voice too raw for his own comfort.
Grumbling something under his breath, Sam started walking away, and Dean scowled at Cas. “I don't know what you're doin’ here,” he muttered, “but it ain't good, and you're gonna tell me everything.”
Obediently, he reaches down and wraps his hand around Castiel’s cock, enough give in the soft skin there, that it slides smoothly over his hardness while Dean drags his fist down and back up again. Castiel lets out this soft puff of breath, as he watches his cock in Dean’s hand. His hips roll up into it, encouraging Dean to go faster, and he does. He wants to see Castiel fall apart like this.
Dean didn’t get a chance to respond, a stuck-up sorta pride curling warmly in his gut. The sharp sting of Cas’s hand cracking against Dean’s ass stole his breath. Another swiftly followed on the same cheek, hard enough to sting and leave behind a faint burn. “Harder,” Dean whispered just loud enough to be heard, and Cas didn’t disappoint. With a little more guidance he was landing blows that jolted Dean forward in his lap, rubbing his trapped cock against Cas’s thigh with every rock of his body. Dean’s elbows slipped off the couch, and he let the arm support his chest, bowing his head. Focused on the heat spreading from the impact of Cas’s hand, through the muscle, pleasure etched with pain, until Dean was sobbing with need, begging Cas to stop and fuck him.
Contemplating his answer, Cas chewed on his top lip. He could put her off and lie about it. She'd know he was lying through his teeth though, and he didn't want to hurt her feelings. Plus she was right, he had been abandoning them at lunch.
for the incredible artwork too, it's well deserved. <3
“Whatever you tell yourself to sleep at night,” Balthazar sniffed haughtily.
Cas had to admit the running water they’d rigged up here was nice. He couldn’t remember the last time he had a shower that didn’t come from a bucket he dumped over himself. The water was cool but not ice-cold, so it seemed a fair trade-off with convenience. Besides, he needed the jolt to his system after riding pressed up against Dean on a motorcycle. That had been…
Mom smiled as Dean sat down at the table. “Happy birthday, sweetheart.”
Cas presses a gentle kiss to his forehead, his wet cheeks. “Even if you did, you know that would be fine. No one's perfect, though you do come particularly close.”
one in person, he'd only seen sketches in some of Sam's books.
Right, fuck. Focus. Dean clears his throat and offers a smile. “Dean.”
After he shoved his feet into his boots, he grabbed a handful of quarters, and a jug of laundry soap from the small table near his door, then made his way down to the laundry room. He didn’t waste time—not with Dean upstairs warm and waiting for him. The first machine he came across got stuffed full of their clothes, and he started it.
Cas reached down and yanked out the bolt. He washed it off in a nearby puddle and stashed it again. “What will you tell your brother about the missing weapon if he comes across us before we retrieve it?”
handle it for a day. Probably could for longer than that too if Dean didn’t have control issues a mile wide. Dean’s shoulders slump a little as he gives in, it’s not like this is where he really wants to be right now anyway.
“Why don’t you come over here?” Cas asked, the tone of his voice silky and deep.
Disappointment flickered across Dean’s face. “Shit.”
His shirt parts, and Castiel leans away to look down the length of him, hands smoothing along the bare, toned skin of Dean's stomach and chest. Need claws at Dean's gut, and he just wants Castiel to keep touching him, to never stop.
“Same logic, Dean: If I’d been normal instead of an incubus, I never would’ve made you lose it. Your first kiss would’ve been sweet instead of overwhelming.” Cas replied, and Dean frowned, ‘cause, okay, that was technically true… maybe… but it didn’t absolve him or anything.
He blinks his eyes open and Cas is watching his face intently, his lips shiny and parted, tension around his eyes as he holds himself back.
“God, Castiel,” Dean moans, hips picking up speed and force. He’s holding on by a tiny tether, trying desperately not to let his knot swell just yet, but it’s so damn hard with Castiel tight around him, grunting and letting out these wrecked little gasps with every thrust.
Sure, Dean’d done it on the first day, but Castiel’d assumed that he was just covering up nerves or something about making such a big career move. Not that Castiel gives a damn about Dean’s scent. He doesn’t. He hasn't imagined what he might smell like either. He just hates being treated with kid gloves. Or worse, being
“Cas,” Dean sucked in a quick breath that exploded out of him when Cas fastened his mouth just under Dean’s ear. He sucked at the sensitive skin there, and bit down lightly. Beneath him, Dean arched wildly. “Cas, ah,
Cas’s hand slips down to rest against his throat and he finally gives Dean the go ahead he’s been waiting for, “Make me come.”
For a while they just stay like that, both of them catching their breaths as they come down, Dean softening inside Cas.
The thing is … the thing is … they need to get out of here, because Castiel’s not gonna flush his entire career down the toilet by making a scene right now, no matter how much he wants Dean. The problem with that is that if Castiel runs, Dean’s instincts are definitely going to take over, he can see Dean fighting for tenuous restraint—and running is a sure way to snap it.
His eyes briefly locked on Sam's, then flashed to Cas, who was walking toward him, hands raised while Lilith's minions ran like the rats they were. Dean didn't let them. Righteous vengeance boiled over inside of him and he burned them all. Short lived screams echoed, but Dean was too far gone to care. His skin was too hot, his whole body on fire.
Letting out a chuckle, Dean relaxes slightly, a tiny smirk curving up his lips. “I know.”
Dean can’t wait for the handoff—when Mr. Adler’s gonna introduce him to the guy who’s gonna get him up to speed. Castiel, he’s been told, will be able to go over the current pitches they’re working on.
Getting Dean back had only been the start. They've been through so much since then—almost 8 years worth of struggling, and successes, and so much more love than Castiel’d ever hoped for in his life. More than he's ever thought he deserves.
There was a warm feeling in Dean's chest that just kept growing for Cas. Every little thing he did seemed to feed it. Dean scrubbed a hand over his face as he flopped back onto the bed with a groan. He needed to find a way to shut it down. He couldn't let himself get attached like this.
Dean bit his lip and there was this shy flush that spread down his neck as Cas maneuvered them until Dean was straddling his chest. He let his fingers slip back inside of Dean, burying them as deep as possible. Spellbound, he stared with his lips parted as Dean bounced on three of them. God, he was burning up inside, and Cas couldn’t help but imagine just how good Dean would feel around his cock. Tight and silken and so fucking wet.
The one his eyes were drawn to had a wide dark grey distressed band with lighter grey detailing. A smaller black band of leather ran around the middle, silver hardware holding it in place. At the front, the band was attached on either side to the locking mechanism; a silver star. On the leather beneath, a hollowed out circle of silver flames surrounded the star. Something about it seemed powerful. He liked it.
Dean’s eyes rolled, but he smiled. “Wow, nice to know you like me sometimes.”
Under the hot spray of water, he thought about what he knew. And what he knew was that Dean was upset about hurting him, scarring him. Dean was clearly freaking out thinking that it was all his fault for losing control. Cas hadn’t gotten a chance to really explain what’d actually happened to Dean before he’d run off, so he definitely needed to do that tomorrow. And he needed to apologize for letting it get so bad… plus tell him that he should’ve just talked to him about it.
Dean chuckled—a sound that cut off when Cas shoved him back onto the bed. He bounced on the mattress and stared up at Cas, slack jawed and so turned on at the show of strength.
Every once in awhile he still had nightmares, still woke up drenched in a cold sweat and shaking, but the longer that went by the less they happened—the easier it was to fall back asleep after.

Yay!! Update!! Please die with me over
get enough. Skin against skin, and their moans echo in the room, rising to a frenzied pitch.
“Good,” Dean breathed, “so damn good. That was awesome, sir.”
Pleasure so harsh that it’s almost pain zips right down to his dick. Makes him blurt out a bead of precome that pearls at his tip before it slides down the side. “Touch me, touch me, Cas, please, fuck me. God, I need it.”
“Mhm,” Dean agrees, walking backwards down the porch steps, “and I'm all yours, baby.”
“So what made you choose this particular outfit for your grand seduction?” Cas asked, blue eyes so intent Dean wanted to squirm in his seat.
“All the cells still open?” he asked as he pushed past her and climbed the steps pulling Cas along behind him.
Hey guys! I know this is a little late. Both
to be notified when I post new works.
“Morning,” she greeted him brightly, cheerful in a way that always grated on Dean’s nerves until he'd been fed. “Sleep well?”
Cas's voice is wrecked, and so fucking hot that a fevered burst of arousal surges through Dean in dizzying intensity.
She arched an eyebrow and her smirk widened, “No offense, but you’re not really my type.”
“I—yes,” he replied loud enough for Dean to hear through the door, abandoning the kitchen in order to let Dean in.
Cas finds some resolve, “Someone I love, and want to stick around for.”
Even if he’d been right, and even if his life was infinitely better for his one small act of rebellion, it was his fault. If he’d been an alpha, or if he’d stayed—he pushed down on the acidic feeling that rose in his throat as he turned onto their old street.
Cas had to have felt the way Dean’s cock jerked. “H-harder, think red hot before you fuck me. I, um, like the way it feels.”
“Haven't got any,” Dean interrupted; he didn't have a sweet clue what he was gonna do, hadn't ever let himself consider the possibilities because there wasn't
Sexy as hell, and Dean’s thoughts instantly focused on the slide of Cas’s tongue as he slickly slid it past Dean’s lips. Cas kissed him deep and filthy—exactly what Dean wanted. Both of Dean’s hands clenched in Cas’s shirt, afraid that if he let go Cas would pull away. Pinned between Cas and the wall was exactly where Dean wanted to be right then. The hard pressure of Cas all pushed up against him, and God, Cas was good at this. He sucked at Dean's tongue, nipped his bottom lip just hard enough to jolt pleasure straight to Dean's rapidly filling cock.
Dean’s shudder was answer enough, he figured.
Without thought, Cas's tiny smile grew into something a little predatory. “Maybe you're just nice to look at.”
“God,” Dean panted, fingers digging into the muscles of Cas's back. “Love you so much.”
“I’ve been informed that they’re ‘Okay’ and ‘Fine’ for what it’s worth,” he said helpfully.
is? I'm still staring at her art for this chapter. <3
“Not mine. How's Benny?”
And right now, he's finally tracked the little fucker down—he's on the other side of the locked study room door that Dean's standing in front of. How the hell he keeps escaping on him, Dean has no damn clue. It's his
He was only eighteen, still in highschool and he didn't have much money. Just the life insurance that his parents had set up to pay out monthly for his care, with a moderately sized lump sum he got access to on his eighteenth birthday. Luckily for him, no one could get at the trust but him once he was old enough. If Zachariah’d had his way, he’d have burned through it all years ago and Cas wouldn't have had a cent to his name.
Dean’s smile grew when he looked up and saw him. Cas’s stomach did a little flip.
“You look…” Cas stopped just shy of him, one hand cupping Dean’s hip, still staring down between their bodies. “You’re gorgeous. Is it okay if I touch you?"
There was water—no, tears—pooling on Dean's chest and his heart ached for Cas.
Cas's hands on his bare skin more than he's ever needed anything in his whole goddamn life. “God, Cas, I can't … I can't. I need you to fuck me, need you to touch me. I—I can't.”
to take my time with you. And all I see when I look at you is this hot guy that I like a lot for some reason. Even if he’s stubborn.”
After Balthazar shot off a few rapid texts and Cas had set up his station for him, they settled in, Cas in the reclining chair and Balthazar on the rolling stool. Balthazar quickly selected the colours that matched Cas’s design and lined the stencil up. He peeled it off, leaving behind a blue outline of the design on Cas's skin.
's amazing art. I legitimately might have (totally) screamed a high-pitched scream when she sent it to me. ^-^;
Dean sent him a crooked smile he knew was killer. “Get back to typing away so you hit that deadline?”
Dean’s heart thumped. “Please. I—Cas.” Dean arched into Cas’s palm the second it made contact, his hips rolling up to meet the slide of Cas’s hand over him. Cas grazed his mouth along Dean’s throat, sucked just under his chin, grinding his hand gently against Dean’s cock. The damp material a testament to how damn turned on Dean was.
Dean's lips twitched higher. "Matter of fact, Cas, I am thirsty. It is hot. Though I can't imagine it's much less hot in there with you."
“If you're gonna be a commoner like the rest of us, gotta learn how to take care of a car, Cas.”
“It was disguised as a pegasus, but it’s been out in those woods every night for the last three nights. Don’t you think that’s suspicious, Sam? What if Stormridge is working with it?”
Cas thought as Dean led him up the steps to another empty cabin.
She grinned at his lopsided smile. “Of course. Who else is gonna keep the dr-” her face blanched a little and she winced.
“Better,” Cas whispered in his ear, and, oh god, finally, his fingers skimmed over Dean's straining, needy dick, closing around him in a cultured, firm grip that curled Dean's toes. He started pulling gently, tugging, rubbing his thumb over the slippery head of Dean's cock. Helplessly, Dean rocked his hips into it, clutching at Cas's shoulders.
So, Dean found out Cas's pen name and genre by
From somewhere inside of him, blue flames erupted, dancing along his skin in spirals and whorls that leapt from him and bridged the gap between them. Mary's body seemed to be absorbing whatever magic he was putting out and she watched, still unafraid as she saw it happen until she was forced to close her eyes against a bright white flare of blinding light before everything went completely dark.
His thighs clamp together a little, he can't help the way his hips jerk up. Cas's gaze flicks impassively down to the straining bulge in Dean's jeans before he turns and walks over to the closet on the left side of the room.
Cas shrugs, it's no secret that he loves to write. He'd majored in English at University—the hardest four years of his life because he spent the school year away from Dean, and now he's a best selling novelist. So yeah, he writes a lot. And his number one fan has always been the man standing right in front of him. “This one's almost done. I'm pretty sure you're gonna love it.”
Everything was hazy when he opened his eyes. He blinked to clear his vision. How—was he… was he alive? Suddenly, the only thing filling up his field of vision was blue again, bright and glassy, wet. Dean tilted his head, he thought someone was talking to him but his brain was partially offline. It was like the feeling right after surfacing from a really good sleep. He blinked again and everything came sharply back into focus.
“Morning,” he said, trying not to stare too blatantly at all the toned tan muscle now on display. “Sleep well?”
That the whole room isn’t watching them right now is a stroke of luck, but Castiel is all too aware of the few eyes that
“Just like that,” Cas confirmed, gentle hands cupping Dean’s face, and oh. His eyelashes drifted down as he leaned forward. Dean wet his lips in anticipation, his own eyes closing as Cas finally, finally kissed him. Easy pressure, just a graze, and then Cas dove in, kissing him hard and sure, commanding. A sharp flush of heat rushed through Dean’s veins, his heart racing. God, he’d wanted this so badly. He wanted so much more.
an alpha? It's degrading.
A pleased half-smile crossed Dean's face and then his brows furrowed in thought. He leaned his elbow on the table and rested his head on his fist, took his time with his answer. Before he got around to voicing said answer, the lunch bell rang and Dean grimaced as he casted a furtive glance around at everyone filing out.
“Nothing important,” he told her, but his eyes were on Dean at a table by himself in the far corner of the cafeteria where he was quietly eating his lunch.
Cas clenched his gut hard against the way his knot was suddenly swelling much too fast, and took slow breaths to calm himself. “Do you have a condom?” he asked once he found the words to.
Check out the art post
Cas rolled his eyes, but his lips pulled into a smile anyway. “Thank you.”
“What exactly were you hoping to accomplish with that?”
Dean's about five seconds away from coming with nothing more than Cas's hot breath ghosting over his dick. And then Cas licks a slow line up his cock, sucks him into his mouth at the same time as he plunges two fingers inside of him. So wet that the glide is smooth and perfect, lube and come easing the way, and Cas's aim is dead on like always, fingertips massaging relentlessly against Dean's prostate. “Ca—” Dean’s voice catches roughly.
The dirt pathway leading from the guard tower at the edge of Shepherd’s Bend was dimly lit with enchanted blue orbs of firelight in the dark of the night, and directly behind him, her black scales shining silver in them, was his dragon, Baby. She was seated with her tail curling around her, wings resting at her sides—only up to about Dean’s knee in height, she was large for her kind. Most dragons weren't taller than mid-calf on him. Her pale eyes were fixed on Dean, her adorable face tilted up, expectant.
Yeah, no shit you do. What the hell are you thinking, Sam? I kept Cas out of this for a reason! I can't watch Michael kill him. I can't watch him die again. Okay, Sam? I
Dean's irritation deflated like a flat tire at the honest hope in her voice.
A smirk pulls up the corner of Castiel's lips, “Yeah,” he says, lacing his fingers with Dean's. “Let's go home.”
Grudgingly, Cas nodded his understanding and pushed down the pang of longing that settled in his chest over the thought of parents who cared like that. Maybe Dean saw something dismal in his expression, or maybe he was just finally warming up, either way, his palm squeezed Cas's shoulder and he said, “Thanks for the offer though, Cas. See ya later?”
“Missed you 'round here, kid. How’ve you been?” she asked as she pulled away and cupped his cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
With Dean, Cas thrived on secret warm smiles, lingering touches and stolen kisses, on the things that Dean was quickly coming to feel for him. He supposed it would be a weird concept if someone was thinking about feeding in terms of food, because for an incubus feeding on intimacy didn't provide nourishment in the same way eating did.
“Okay, Dean. I’ll start off light and we can play by ear how hard we get.”
“Yeah?”
Before Cas had turned eighteen—before he'd woken up with Dean's name blazing behind his closed eyes—his life at home’d been pretty damn close to hell on earth. He'd spent the majority of it hiding in his room and trying not to piss off his uncle, Zachariah. Cas’d always been terrified he'd say the wrong thing, do the wrong thing and end up with a black eye or bruised ribs or worse to show for it.
“Better,” Cas warmly said as he moved around Dean and picked up the tape from the table. “Hold your arms out together in front of you.” Dean did. “The nice thing about bondage tape is that it only sticks to itself.” Cas began to wrap it around Dean’s arms, fastening them together from mid-forearm to just above where his cuff started. “So you don’t have to worry about removing it later.”
Dean didn't trust Crowley as far as he could throw him, but he didn't seem to be threatening at the moment. For someone who said he was there to offer to take Dean’s powers, it didn’t seem like he was all that upset with a no. “Why are you really here? ‘Cause I know it ain’t for a heart to heart about me.”
“Of course he does,” Cas sighed. More than anyone else at their school, he saw just how crappy Dean had it there. “I swear it was just an accident.”
Dean’s eyes narrowed. That was a damn lie if he ever heard one. With a resigned sigh, he put the neck of bottle to his lips and tilted it up as he leaned his head back. Trying not to taste it, he swallowed mouthfuls as quickly as he could until the bottle was empty.
So now there are two new chapters of this verse. The fluff, yet again took me by surprise, but I hope you enjoy it. <3
Another kiss pressed to his hair, soft, warm breath against his scalp and Cas felt a small smile pull at his lips. Softly, Dean said, “Okay.”
Stepping quietly toward where the sound had originated, Dean peered deeper into the shadows. It wasn't a horse at all—there in a beam of white moonlight facing away from him was a pegasus so black it almost bled seamlessly into the night, it's massive wings dipping down low beside it.
Cas sighed. “We already went over this, Charlie.”
Bobby closed the distance between them and pulled him and Sam into a double hug that Dean maybe let himself actually enjoy. Bobby smelled like summer days and engine grease, and Dean inhaled deeply, heartened. It wasn’t like they hugged often—this was practically unheard of—but he bet it was how people felt when their dad’s hugged them. Another little prick of guilt to add to Dean’s tally. Bobby stepped back but kept his hand on each of their shoulders. “How you boys handlin’ this?”
Benny shrugs a shoulder and offers Dean a wry smile, gently patting the large black horse beside him. “Sorry, boss. Gotta side with Jo on this one.”
Curiously, Dean glanced back and forth between them, “I can handle it.”
“Dean,” the command in Cas's voice forces Dean to look back up into his eyes. There's a softness there that Cas doesn't usually let show when they're playing like this. “You drive me crazy. I've jerked off more in the last six months thinking about you than I have since I was a teenager. It's safe to say you have a profound effect on me.”
“You know,” Cas says, tone conversational like his dick isn’t hard and filling Dean up so goddamn perfect, “I really do love it when you’re like this. Cock-hungry and desperate for me. Like the way your mouth gets dirtier every second I hold out on you.”
“Mmm,” Cas murmured, and the vibrations travelled right up Dean's spine in a shiver of pleasure. “Love the way you taste. I could spend hours eating you out, but I've been dying to fuck you
A third finger pressed at Dean’s rim and after a little resistance, it slid right in beside the others. Fuck, he was so full—stretched wide around Cas’s thrusting, twisting, fingers—and it still didn’t feel like enough, wasn’t what he wanted, not really. Cas’s free hand stroked his thigh soothingly, and Dean realized with a start that he was begging Cas for more.
Eventually he wore himself out, and he whistled to signal he was heading back. The return trip went slower with Dean waiting for Baby to outpace him. Unease rolled through his gut within moments.
Cas didn't voice that though, he kept it to himself, heart beating dangerously fast. “Hmm. On your back for now.”
A stilted breath punches from Dean's lungs, his cheeks burning. “Probably not as hard as you make me,” he retorts eyes dropping to Cas's chest, struggling for control of his body.
he could safely see himself doing. He grinned when he realized now he could.
“Sam and Jo, get Benny, and get him inside,” Cas demanded. “I'll get Dean.”
He wanted to take his time, had
Cas ignored him, standing his ground as the boy ran past him and waited for an opportunity. He sighted the creature, lined up his shot, and gently nudged the trigger, hurling a bolt into the monster and taking it down. It skidded along the pavement before coming to a stop in an unsightly heap.
Day by day, he was finding where he fit. It was frightening, and it was difficult, but it seemed worth the fear and uncertainty when Dean lifted his gaze from his task and looked at Cas like he was something incredible.
Dean. You said you'd be back and I need that to be true. We all do….”
Cas rolled his hips experimentally, rocking deeper. “Is this what you wanted?”
“Laundry’s piled up about yea high,” Sam held his hand up next to his waist, “but it looks like the machines work. I’ll go throw those in the washer and then we can go grab cleaning stuff.”
A whole slew of confusion emotions rushed through Dean at breakneck speed. Grateful that Bobby cared enough to do that for them—he could hear loud and clear the sentiment behind it, and it choked him up. “I’m not mad,” Dean whispered roughly, but he didn’t reach out and take the letter. His chest felt too tight, like he couldn’t draw in a breath properly and suddenly he couldn’t do this. He shook his head gently as he backed away a few steps and darted out of the room. For all he knew, they called after him, but Dean couldn’t hear it, buzzing in his ears too loud.
Dean's body stiffened, he bit down on Cas's bottom lip, hard, and came with a long, low groan. Cas jerked him through every spurt and tremor until Dean was shaking with oversensitivity.
“Yeah,” he replied lowly as he settled himself on his chest between Dean's legs, elbows supporting his weight.
he breathlessly moaned.
it but the alternative was worse. Kids who developed their powers early had much more difficulty controlling them—everyone knew that. Just like everyone knew to stay away from him because of it.
“Yes… hello, Dean.”
sleeping with him. Because, when he thinks about it, it’s just sexual, right? This thing between him and Castiel.
you saved my ass when I got stuck (like always), and I appreciate it every time. <3<3 Love your face.
An hour later and Cas had no idea what’d possessed him to imply that he could cook. The hamburger he’d tried to fry for spaghetti was a black charcoal brick that smoke was pouring off of. The spaghetti itself was glued together in one massive sticky lump, and Cas stood there for a moment and frowned at it all in dismay.
“This,” Dean said softly, pushing up against him, his hard cock rubbing along the cut of Cas's hips. Dean chased friction like he was dying for it. “You.”
Almost involuntarily, Dean's hips rocked down, sliding his cock along the groove of leather. Wet enough that the slide felt so fucking good. “Yeah, fuck, yes, sir, I can—” Dean's words dissolved into a moan as his thighs worked, his ass clenching with effort. Sweat prickled up at his temples, his lower back.
“You're crazy,” Dean replied, inching in front of Cas. Maybe he couldn’t protect him with his powers, but he could shield him with his body if he needed to.
The necessary supplies for his second attempt at feeding Dean were fairly simple, and since it was also fairly likely that a blindfolded monkey could probably make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, he ought to do fine.
“Do you want me to take it down a notch? Or stop altogether?” Cas asks, sliding his thumbs over Dean's jaw.
“They’re from your dad. He … uh,” Bobby let out a soft sigh. “He had ‘em in his coat that night. Jody Mills gave ‘em to me to hold onto for you boys. Looks like he’d been carrying ‘em for a long time. Pages are worn pretty thin at the creases. I … uh, read what he wrote when I was tryin’ to decide whether you needed to see ‘em or not. I know you’re not my boys, not really, but I didn’t want him doing any more damage. So … be mad if you’re gonna, but I’d do it again.”
he's so worked up about this. It doesn't make sense, but tears keep leaking from beneath his lashes anyway.
Sam's eyes flicked to the same necklace Cas had been thinking about. “Is… um, that what you do?”
Dean nods, lips brushing Cas's. “Cas, c’mon. Please. Fuck me. Mmm, need you to fuck me. Make me feel it tomorrow.”

He tilted his head from where it was tipped back against the wall behind them and looked over at Dean. “Hmm?”
It was weird that pretty much anything to do with sex he could talk about no problem. Feelings though… were messy and confusing and awkward. Strangely, though, he kind of liked it.
In the woods it was much darker, no firelight to guide them. Baby, of course, didn't need much light at all, her vision was far more adaptable than Dean's. Luckily the moon was bright overhead and even filtering through the canopy, the path was visible.
“Cas Novak,” Dean admitted, sparing a quick look over just in time to catch Sam's eyes bug out.
"I—that is—you—" Cas swore internally; it was ridiculous, utterly ridiculous that Dean managed to cause him to trip over his tongue and humiliate himself every single time they spoke. He wanted to crawl back inside and start over. "Hot. The sun. And it's…" Cas rolled his eyes heavenward and prayed for the earth to swallow him and save him from this situation of his own infernal making. "What I mean is, thirsty? I—lemonade. I'm making some and you could, well, come in, cool off. For a bit."
Dean’s eyebrow raised, “While you watch?”
“It’s alright not to be.” Cas squeezed Sam’s shoulder fondly, and Sam nodded slightly, bottom lip trembling. Sympathetically, Dean’s eyes stung a bit but he blinked it away. Next thing he knew, Cas’s hand was warm on his shoulder, just like it had been on Sam’s. Solid and strong, his rich scent comforting. Support that Dean found himself drawing strength from. “What about you, Dean?”
At school his best defense was always to draw as little attention to himself as possible, and his last growth spurt had left him taller than a lot of his classmates. He was slowly bulking out a little to fit his frame, but he was generally uncomfortable with how big he felt. He wasn't a fan of how he blended a little less easily into the background nowadays.
Dean rubbed a hand over the back of his head, and looked at his lap, “Those are the things that I’m for sure definitely into … or really want to try … with you.”
Dean wipes his free hand over his mouth, and with the other one he hands Cas his gift. “Anyway, here.”
A moment later his question was answered when a massive creature, all teeth and claws and bulging muscle rounded the same corner with a growling snarl that echoed off the buildings. Cas braced the stock against his shoulder and adjusted his hold on the foregrip.
“They’re extinct!” Sam cut in. “I did a project on the mythology.”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, walking the distance from his car to the stairs, and then jogging up them. He’s kinda sweaty and dirty, but Cas never seems to care, even actually enjoys it for some reason, so Dean steps close to him, pulls him into a kiss that’s equal parts affection and need. “Missed you.”
He blinked hard a few times and let his vision focus on the deep blue of the sky, cut through with the white strip of a jet trail. The sun was rapidly fading in the west, dimming everything, and he’d always loved this time of day. He watched a murmuration of starlings twist and coil stunningly through the sky before they settled into the treeline behind the building, and tried to catch his breath—slow his still frantically beating heart.
They found Sam in the parking lot, leaning against the Corolla’s hood. Dean frowned at his burgundy car and decided that the first thing he was gonna do this week was fix up the Impala. He hadn’t realized just how much he’d missed her until they’d found her left to rust in the driveway.
And there goes his afterglow. He'd told Cas he loved him, and Cas didn't—Cas doesn't—
Dean quickly shucked his pants, socks, and boxer-briefs, and took his time putting the panties on. Fuck, they were soft and silky, and the head of his cock was already pushing out against the front of them. He definitely liked the way they felt. As he pulled his jeans back on over top, Dean sucked on his bottom lip. He left his underwear folded up on the oversized wingback chair in the corner, along with his socks.
Suddenly alone, Dean turned to Cas with an overly cocky smile to cover up how nervous he was. “I … um, I was over at the body shop, getting an appointment for Baby, and I figured I would drop in on you. Sam texted me the address.”
“I didn’t mind,” Cas reassured him.
Maybe this was a stupid plan, but it was the best Dean had. Sam was right though—shadowlights were dangerous when they
Panting, Dean finally pulled off and sat back on his heels, lips swollen-red and shiny, “Yeah. Yes. Please, Cas.”
Cas leaned closer and kissed Dean’s hip, soft lips warm, wet tongue, and the scrape of his stubble. He stood back up, and his gaze travelled over Dean’s body from his feet all the way back up to his eyes. Dean bit back a whimper, teeth dug into his bottom lip.
Cas squares his shoulders and he waits. And waits. And finally, at the third round of thumps, his irritation outweighs his survival instincts. Does Michael think this is a
He nodded, and breathed out slowly, trying to let go of his fears, at least for now. “I know.”
“Sure you don’t need some help?” Dean teased, eyes bright.
slayed me with her art. T.T Don't forget to leave her some love. <3
He's still rock hard and he's still dying to be
hard as hell and starting to slick. Again. Cas followed him down, close enough that Dean felt the heat of Cas’s leg where it curled up on the couch so that Cas was facing him. “Yeah, did the checklist too,” Dean pointed to the paper on the coffee table. Heat rose in his cheeks as Cas reached out and picked it up.
“H’wha—?” Jo spluttered, trailing after them.
was to have you waiting for me. You always sell yourself short, but you're smart too. You're funny, and generous, and so damn sweet that you painted a water tower and told the whole town you loved me. You built a
Dean grits out, “We don’t have to—you don’t … Cas, if you don’t wanna do this, I’ll stop.”
With a sigh, he picked his way over the trash, Sam following behind him. “We’re gonna need cleaning supplies. Let’s take a quick look and figure out what exactly we’ll need to do.”
There was something carnally sexy about jerking Cas, off, making him feel good, that was intoxicating. The sounds Cas made were a heady thrill Dean wanted more of. He tightened his grip, throwing in a flick of his wrist on the upstroke that he always liked. Judging by the way Cas's hips pushed up into Dean's hand, he liked it too.
Fucking pornographic, is how he looks, and Dean’s just done. Stick a goddamn fork in him. He lets his gaze travel up Castiel’s shins, over his muscular thighs, and by the time he’s reached the juncture of his legs, it’s apparent that Castiel’s noticed him looking and is taking a vested interest.
Pressure, then, Cas’s thumb pushes in slowly with a little effort, snug up against his cock, and Dean’s about a second from blowing his load, body tight around Cas, thrilling current of pleasure that jolts under his skin. His thumb slips back out and Cas finally breaks; his hips surge up to meet Dean. He pulses hot inside of him and he fills Dean up until it leaks back out around his cock. Filthy wet and fucking hot.
So maybe he’d been a little over the top smother-y with his concern for Sam during the drive, but this had to be harder on him. Sam had been the one who’d fought the most with Dad before they left. It was him that Dad had accused of taking Dean away. Which made next to no sense since Dean was the older one, but Dad on a bender wasn’t exactly known for his rational thought process. A little too old school in his thoughts on omegas for Dean’s comfort.
“I—” Cas starts, then frowns, “No. It's improbable.”
“God I love your ass,” Cas murmured behind him, and a flush burned across Dean’s cheeks and down his chest. “Loved how red we got it yesterday. You should’ve seen it, Dean. Got me so hard.”
Cas withdrew his finger and when he pressed back inside this time it was with two, stroking and thrusting, twisting as Cas rotated his wrist. Dean shuddered and moaned. He couldn’t—he wanted—
That was true. He shoved his disappointment down deep, his regret that he wouldn’t get to see Dean waking up. “I do.”
“You’re aware they painted it over, right?” Cas asks, amusement threading through his words.
“Of course, Dean,” he replied and watched as Dean walked away, all broad shoulders and narrow hips that melted into the crowd of people who were leaving the cafeteria.
And that’s all before he even takes in the sight in front of him. Castiel, he assumes, is fucking
*****
A sigh involuntarily burst from Dean’s lips, but he figured he might as well tell him the truth.
Amusement filled him up and warmed his cheeks. “Like you couldn't tell.” He pressed a kiss behind Cas's ear, then admitted, “It was good, Cas. Pretty damn awesome. Did you use your power to make it easier? And the lube?”
“Uh-huh. Let’s just get you to class.” Dean turns his attention to their surroundings and scans the students in their path for any threats. He’s been guarding people long enough that he can pick out potential danger with barely a look. Hyper-alert and cognizant of the signs. They make it to Castiel’s class and he sits in the back as usual, Dean a few steps behind him stationed near the door.
Cas's voice was rough and breathy. “Yes. Ah, please.”
“Mmm,” Cas agreed, “it does, doesn’t it?”
Finally, Dean cleared his throat. “Um, hi.”
that.”
Cas felt his face burn. For a man who wrote erotica for a living, he was the worst at this in real life. He probably shouldn't be allowed around actual humans. He ought to go live in an isolated castle in the Highlands of Scotland and never again speak to another soul because this was abject torture and… "I… I'll just make the drinks, you, uh. Go ahead and wait in the living room."
“You’re annoying, y’know that?” he grumbled, eyes narrowed at her, hand dusting over the front of his armor. The sword and shield on his chestplate glowed bright blue at his touch, ready to be called forth.
“Cas, please. Need you,” Dean begged, voice wrecked. There was no room for shyness or shame because his whole existence was focused on how badly he needed Cas.
He chuckled to himself. “Yeah, it’s me!”
Cas Novak. His soulmate was Cas…  Novak. Of all the people in the whole freakin’ world, he got a guy he went to school with. An extremely hot guy with dark messy hair, deep blue eyes that were intense and perpetually lined with thick black eyeliner, piercings, tattoos… a guy who probably barely even knew who Dean was, just like everyone else.
Once he was downstairs in the kitchen Dean cut himself a slice of bread, buttered it, and stuffed it in his mouth, finishing it in fast bites and washing it down with some water. If he didn't waste time eating a heartier breakfast he’d get out of his house fast enough to speak with Sam before he was needed at the guard tower.
Dean nodded.
Dean chuckled. “I picked this up for you.”
“Dean,” Cas’s tone is a warning and Dean instantly pushes himself up to standing.
, Cas replied.
A few people have been wondering where I've been lately, so I thought I'd give you a little update on why I haven't been posting as much. I've been working on original manuscripts a lot more, a couple have been contracted with a small press, and with my latest—the first in a series—I signed a literary agent. I'm super excited and really enjoying building my own worlds and characters from the ground up. That said, I still love the shit out of Dean and Cas, and I know I'm not done writing stories for them. <3
“Of course, you'll need to get those clothes off. If you want me to fuck you.”
The heat in Dean’s eyes as Castiel backs out of the elevator scorches him. “Yeah.”
Cas's chest caved in. He'd wanted to refuse, but Hannah was pulling at his hand, terror in her face and voice.
For a bit it was quiet between them and Cas pressed a soft kiss to Dean's chest. “Are you okay? What Crowley said, what happened was a lot.”
Body quaking, he took Dean right up to the edge, breathless and frantic. For one wild moment Dean was suspended there, climax so goddamn close, but just out of reach and then Cas’s hand wrapped snuggly around Dean's cock, stroking him quick and dirty.
“Ignore it, Jo,” Dean commanded, finally reaching the third floor of the spire. Through the door on his right they entered a large room with four arched doors spanning the circular wall.
than me, Cas! You know I had no shot at winning that stupid wrestling contest.”
Dean fucked him gently. He built Cas up with teasing touches, then pushed into him slowly. He made it last. The two of them holding onto each other, saying with their bodies all of the things they hadn't said out loud yet, Cas felt like his body was combusting alongside his heart. He wanted Dean so much,
“I have no clue why I said that. I’m normal single. I swear I’m not usually so…”
Cas’s blue eyes lifted to his, and fuck, he was gorgeous and confident, voice commanding, “Go through the living room, down the hall to my bed and put on what I left there for you. Put your clothes back on, and then come meet me at the couch.” Like an afterthought he added, “My room is the last door.”
Sam looked back at him, lips drawn down, forehead furrowed. “Looks like we got our work cut out for us. Wonder how bad it is inside?”
They stayed that way for a long time, Cas trembling, clutching Dean to his chest, Dean's arms wrapped tightly around his shoulders.
to compare it to. Not the point, he shivered now that his sweat was cooling, chest heavy with an uncomfortable mix of loneliness and regret. Unhappily, he let out a harsh sigh and rubbed his clean hand over his face.
Sam must've caught the interest behind Dean's words. His eyes rolled upward, probably praying for patience. As if anyone was listening any more. If they ever had.
Fuck, he was so big, was filling Dean up so full already. He was so close too, but he had to wait. Cas’d said so. His eyes squeezed shut as he concentrated on not coming when every bit of him was screaming for release.
“No thanks?” Lilith wrinkled her nose, grinning. “It's funny that you think you have a choice here.”
“Yeah!” He came jogging around a corner with his rifle in his hands. Something suspicious was going on. Dean knew it but couldn't pinpoint what. Then he noticed the broken strap on Sam's rifle. Had he just fumbled his gun? Was he trying to play it off? “Just knocked some books over. You know me, growing limbs I can't control.”
Dean’s fingers are clenched around the handle that runs along the elevator wall, white knuckled with clear effort not to touch Castiel. “We can talk about it after,” Castiel decides, and he hits the button for what he hopes is the top floor without looking.
blue and
Yet again
The splash of pink on Cas’s face rose in intensity, and his eyes darkened slightly. And wasn’t that interesting? Cas cleared his throat. “I—well—yes, Joshua highly recommended you for this job. I’m certain you’ll be very,” he coughed a little, face turning redder. “Very satisfactory. In… in… your role here.”
An affectionately gruff voice from the entryway caught their attention, “Cool, huh? That what they’re callin’ being a dumbass these days?”
The false humor in Lilith’s expression instantly vanished. “You're a smart boy. Or someone's been talking too much, but I'll tell you what Dean. You help me get him out, I'll guarantee you a place in his army. High ranking. You'll have respect, you'll have control. You can have it all.”
The receptionist, a pretty brunette beta who introduced herself as Lisa, led them into the room the gathering would be held at. They’d elected to forgo a ceremony. Neither of them wanted to sit through that, and what would the preacher even say anyway? John Winchester was an alcoholic son of a bitch who died when Mary Winchester did and then kept on walking around until he drove himself into a tree. He was lucky he didn’t take anyone else out with him. Survived by his two boys—that John had stopped caring about a long time ago—he’ll be vaguely … well, not missed … sometimes remembered almost fondly if they block out the crappy years.
Cas sent him the link to Dead Kennedy's album Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables.
Sam nodded. “Sounds good, Cas. I’ll walk you out. Gotta grab our bags from Dean's car anyway.”
With a shaky breath, Dean nodded. “Okay. How do you want me?”
Dean’s self-esteem’s taken a pretty nasty beating for the last few months. He’s just about at the end of his rope. He wants to be wanted. And that’s not gonna happen with Castiel.
Hard, leaking, aching for touch, his cock jutted straight up toward his belly button, thick vein down the tan shaft of it that he thumbed along. He brushed over the dark red rim of his pink head, and then over the top.
“Huh. So what's its natural form?” Dean asked.
Later, when Jack goes to the kitchen, Cas stays in Dean's room. He prays even though Dean can't hear him—it doesn't work like that. He prays anyway, just like he does every night.
“Ah, the perks of being an incubus.” Cas chuckled. “Low refractory period forever.”
A sign that hung above the door proclaimed it ‘Midnight Magic Books’. Huh, so it was a bookstore. He glanced at the windows; bold lettering declared that they carried books, toys, costumes and custom leather. Ooookay, so it was a nerdy book store. There was a sign on the glass door that he noticed when he grabbed the handle, 18+ only. A weird, nerdy, adults only bookstore? He tugged nervously at the hem of the olive green military style jacket he’d thrown over his t-shirt.
Cas slid his hand down between their bodies, knuckles dragging over the soft skin of Dean's belly, then stopped just shy of his goal. “Try again.”
Of course. Of course, Dean had to show up when there was smoke everywhere, and Cas was haplessly standing around staring at the disaster and breathing in noxious air while his eyes watered at the sting of it.
Innocent eyes wide, Jack tilts his head. “Then why…?”
He just gets his arms in the sleeves when Cas comes back downstairs. His cheeks are a little pink, and he looks so damn good that Dean just has to kiss him before they go.
“Cas?” he asked once he'd moved out of the bustle of people surrounding them and stood directly in front of him.
Dean that he liked the mark. Cas turned off the water and climbed out of the shower. He toweled off and then wandered back to his bedroom, got himself into fresh boxer-briefs, black jeans and a black t-shirt. Lastly, he pulled on a black hoodie.
While Balthazar worked, they chatted a bit about what was going on in Balthazar’s life lately. Mostly, it was the same old same old, partying and new people to sleep with every weekend.
Dean was playing him, but he still gripped the edge of the couch and leaned forward to see what he was about to do. What he was about to do, it turned out, was bend right over and look for something in the grass. Cas suspected there was absolutely nothing for him to actually find—and then he stopped paying attention to Dean’s goal, because that ass… that ass deserved sonnets, poems, songs even, which Cas was certainly not qualified to write. And—
At first, Dean’d thought about telling Castiel exactly why he couldn’t stop offering him meals and coffee, why he was bending over backwards to get Castiel to drop the prickly pear routine, but the more time they’d spent together the more apparent it became that Castiel just really hates his guts.
Everything gradually heated up, only intensifying as Dean's crawled into his lap, placing a knee on either side of Cas's hips, and his ass firm against the hard ridge of Cas’s denim-trapped cock. Dean pushed forward and rubbed his own hard cock against Cas’s abdomen—possessive heat flared up in Cas’s gut at the feel of it, a primal, carnal response to the evidence of Dean’s arousal.
As he got out of the car, Sam gave him one last pathetically sad puppy dog look along with his quiet goodbye. Dean wished he didn't feel so freakin’ guilty, but he there was a pit in his stomach that didn't ease up until he leaned over and rolled down the window on the door Sam'd slammed shut.
He blinked his eyes open, dazed. Dean flashed him a grin and said, “I’m just gonna clean up real quick.”
“Slow,” Cas demanded, hot all over, and Dean’s eyes widened as he licked his lips—a habit Cas had always cursed and loved in equal measure.
Dean's awareness flashes in. No. They can't. If they find him, and Michael's in control, it’ll be a slaughter. No, he needs to warn them. But he can't. Just like he can't stop Michael from ridin’ around in him. They're all powerless. The pressure guiding him under is back, but Dean doesn't let it touch him this time. He needs to plan. He needs to think.
“God, I love you,” Dean cries out, lost in sensation, and Cas's rhythm momentarily falters.
Cas doesn't waste any time, doesn't make him wait, he just yanks his underwear off and slicks himself up. Then he folds Dean up, tucking Dean's legs up over his elbows. He pushes right in, one long, thick slide and his hips are flush with Dean's ass.
“I'm pretty sure
“Fuck, yes.” Without hesitation, Dean gets his hands on the firm rounded muscles of Castiel’s ass, fingers digging in as he spreads him wide and gets a good look at his soaking wet hole, and fuck if Castiel isn’t pretty all over. Pink and glistening and Dean dives right in, tongue tracing around the wrinkled skin there, lapping up slick and moaning into Castiel.
For fourteen damn years, he’d kept his powers on a leash. He hadn’t even manifested a flame, and yet, he must’ve to burn Cas like that. Acid scorched the back of his throat and he swallowed it down. He needed to get this under control. He was off-balance, but he had to recover, and fast.
They gave up ground, Cas firing every round he had before he dropped the gun and switched back to his crossbow. They made another stand closer to Dean and Jo. There were still too many monsters coming at them. They needed to get to a house. They needed to find a defensible position.
Jack has yet to reach full strength again, the only thing holding Sam together seems to be that he has to stay strong for Jack. And Cas … he's trying, but it's proving difficult. Guilt, regret, futility, they're clawing away in his gut and rushing through his veins with every beat of a heart that for all intents and purposes is his.
“Dean, dinner and driving me out here? It's already more than enough. You did an amazing job planning this.”
I was starving. You didn’t lose control of yourself, I made you lose it. Unintentionally, but regardless, I’m the one to blame. It won’t happen again because
incredibly beautiful.
Consciousness of his surroundings returned slowly to him, the force of his climax left him shaking, dragging in deep ragged lungfuls of air to catch his breath. Something warm and damp was rubbing over his skin, and Cas's lips were soft as he kissed over his shoulders and neck. Eventually Dean realized Cas was cleaning him up, putting him back together. He guided Dean up to standing just long enough to pull his panties back up, then he kissed him slow and laid him down on the couch.
spread out for him like that in his car, looking like the hottest kind of sex and Dean reverently runs his hands over the curve of Cas's ass as he gets up onto his knees behind him. He has to bend over awkwardly to keep from banging his head on the roof, but it's not their first rodeo in this car.
Dean keeps asking if he can get Castiel anything when he orders lunch or sends Alfie on a coffee run, and it’s getting on Castiel’s last nerve. Dean’s quite clearly
For long minutes Cas worked Dean right up to the edge, fucking his fingers into him, and sucking at his cock until Dean was hazy with pleasure and so turned on that he was throbbing. Just before he crested, Cas pulled away and left Dean frantically gasping in air as his eyes squeezed shut and his brain tried desperately to catch up with the sudden lack of stimulation.
“He's… Dean is my soulmate.”
Dean slows his thrusts a little bit in a desperate bid to hold off his orgasm just a little longer. “C’mon, sweetheart,” he coaxes, voice low in the way he knows turns Cas to putty in his hands. “Wanna feel you come for me.”
“Well, shoot. It’s only instant,” Dean said settling down beside Cas and handing him a cup.
“Good.” Cas’s voice was warm with satisfaction and Dean opened his eyes again to look at him, to see that affection aimed at him. “Like I said, my powers come in handy. Benefit of being an incubus means I can do pretty much anything to enhance sex when I want to, though I rarely do.” Cas smirked at him, so sexy Dean bit back a groan. “I prefer to take my partner apart without any tricks. To know it’s
The sun was blazing today, making Dean's white T-shirt stick to his skin in damp patches. He bent over to pick something up and the snug khaki shorts he was wearing pulled even tighter over his firm, round ass. Cas couldn't tear his gaze away if he tried. He bit down on his bottom lip and watched Dean give a little wiggle that could not possibly have been necessary. He was nine-tenths sure Dean knew he had Cas wrapped around his pinky finger, and he was also nine-tenths sure that Dean was teasing him. Perhaps he simply liked the attention, but it was driving Cas to distraction.
Dean’s cheeks flushed darker, and now Cas was the one who smirked.
On the bed, Dean reclines with his elbows propping up his upper body, watching what Castiel's doing intently. Gaze locked on Dean's, Castiel strips down to nothing. He stands there, tanned skin flushed, thick cock jutting out in front of him, dark pink and wet tipped.
“You got that right,” Dean agreed emphatically, his stomach already twisting up in knots just thinking about what he was gonna tell Sam.
Up his sides, Cas's hands slide, inside his jacket, but over his t-shirt. Who knew one damn layer could be so fucking infuriating. He's gonna goddamn burn this shirt after tonight.
“Oh.” Dean looked surprised. Then that melted into nervousness but there was want on his face too, a little rush of pink that flashed over his cheeks, “Um.”
“What's up?” Dean's attention was mostly on his combination and then digging things out of his locker, but Cas forged on.
, without whom this fic wouldn't exist. We came up with a lot of the idea together, and she actually came up with the phoenix twist, which I absolutely loved. Working with her has been such a pleasure, and I'm so proud of what we created. <3
“Sounds good, Cas. I just let Mom know I was gonna stay late. She said to let her know when I’m leaving, but it’s cool.”
Words stop existing, or Dean can’t remember how to say them, because his voice cuts out into a moan that’s half Cas’s name, half plea.
Cas skimmed his hands up along Dean's spread legs as he knelt on the bed, fingers brushing over his thighs, thumbs pressing into the cut of his groin.
Dean let out a slow breath, little tremors wracking his sweat slick body. “Trust you. Cas, I trust you.”
Once they'd gathered as many of Cas's arrows as they could, Dean finally let himself survey the carnage. The sun was getting low, and clouds were rolling in, orange light and shadows lending a surreal glow the the scene. Dean didn't count the bodies, but he was impressed they'd made it through all that mostly unscathed. He'd been ready to die back there, making a last stand to save Cas and Sam, Benny and Jo, except the stubborn dicks wouldn't let him. Thank fuck.
So how was my first foray into fantasy for you? I had so much fun crafting this world, and I'm pretty sure I'm hooked on the genre. I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments.
“God, Dean,” Cas whispered, sounding awed in a way that made Dean’s cheeks heat and his stomach twist with a kind of pride he’d never felt before.
“Use your fingers,” Castiel grunts before he swallows Dean’s dick, and oh fucking hell.
this.
“Unless I tell you to keep quiet, I want to hear you, Dean.” Cas’s hand came up and his thumb tugged Dean’s lip free.
Thanks to
Or he used to. The problem was that lately it wasn't even putting a dent in how much he’d started to crave Dean. And he’d say it was just biology or something,because Dean was cherry fresh innocence and wide green eyes and plush gorgeous lips that Cas could tell had never been kissed—which at eighteen years old, was incredibly rare.
“Just tell us what he is,” Cas said impatiently.
Sam’s chuckle was all little brother glee before he sobered.
“Pissed he got hurt, so hopefully that means he's okay. Jo's bandaging him up. I think maybe she likes him.”
I'm completely in love with the gorgeous art that
“Dean, I need you.” He's on his back on the bed, one arm draped over his eyes. “I need you to fight him, and keep fighting. I know he's got you locked away in there, and I know it seems easier to stay down … but Dean Winchester, we both know you've never known when to quit in a fight. Don't start now. You fight him, and you
“Hi,” Dean said shyly as he glanced up through his lashes, cheeks a shade of pink that Cas had started to suspect was permanent by then and Charlie made an undignified baby dinosaur noise in response before Cas jostled her with his shoulder.
“Dean,” Castiel pants, eyes coming up to focus on Dean’s for a split second before their lips crash together. Hard, biting, nasty kiss that lights Dean up like a fuckin’ Christmas tree. So turned on, that he’s aching. The friction from Castiel shifting around in his lap just enough to offer a little relief, still nowhere near what he needs.
Dean’s attraction to him was instant, a hot flush that spread down his chest and settled low in his belly. Embarrassment heated Dean’s cheeks as Cas’s nostrils flared—there was little doubt that Cas’d picked up on the sharp burst of arousal in his scent. Dean wet his lips and watched Cas track the motion, hands still warm on Dean’s waist. If it wasn’t for the pile of laundry in his arms, Dean was sure he’d‘ve plastered himself to Cas already. When’d Cas gotten so goddamn
“Dean, eyes on me.” Dean looked back up, and Cas smiled at him, “That’s good. I’m glad you added that. Are you okay with those things tonight?”
Could he? He fucking hoped so, because that sounded hot as fuck. God, it was gonna take every ounce of restraint in his body though. He was already so close to the edge.
Like he didn’t fucking know that. Dean glared hatefully at her. If there was some way he could disrupt the warding he'd burn them all to the ground. And though he didn’t answer her, he hoped she could tell exactly what he was thinking by the murderous look on his face.
A quick trip to the bathroom later and she was on her way back when she walked smack into someone. An old man caught her before she could fall, steadied her and Mary’s heart thumped wildly in her chest, a scream locked in her throat. She was half scared out of her mind until she really looked at him—suddenly, she was caught in his brilliant green eyes, swirls of caramel and flecks of yellow, somehow she knew everything was going to be fine.
“Morning, Dean,” she said warmly as she slid into her seat, and took out her laptop.
There was barely enough room for him, but Cas stood, right up in Dean’s space. Close enough that his breath was hot on Dean’s lips; they tingled with remembered sensation and he wanted to lean in and chase it, but the rules of the game they were playing kept him still. Somehow made it that much hotter when Cas’s hands slowly slid up under his shirt, rucking it up as they went.
Dean'd been hard since shortly after Cas had led him to the back of the store. He stepped further into Cas's space and held his gaze as he pressed against Cas, letting him feel just how turned on he was. “What d’you think?”
“You look awfully deep in thought,” Charlie observed from her seat on his right.
“Yeah, of course, but what
Dean keeps his eyes closed and bites down on his bottom lip, not wanting to sound as pathetic as he feels. “I shouldn't’ve—”
Cas's head was warm and heavy on his chest. He'd barely let Dean go since they'd perfunctorily cleaned up and collapsed together beneath the blankets. Dean massaged his fingers through Cas's hair, down the back of his neck. He trailed them over the skin warm metal of Cas's necklace, down to the silver cross that was resting on him. He fingered it. Wanted to ask about it, along with the bracelet Cas wore, the one inscribed with the name
Instead, he has to attend Dean’s stupid birthday party. Mr. Adler had made it perfectly clear that the invitation wasn’t so much an invitation as it was a directive. Which is how Castiel ended up in a blue suit missing his worn in grey sweatpants.
“Fine, deal.”
Finally Dean sighs. “Well, I brought you out here to look at the stars too, but honestly I'd rather be home in bed with you right about now. Unless you still wanna do that?”
thank you for the endless encouragement and basically alpha reading for me. You're amazing.
Not long after he finished up, the unmistakable sound of Cas’s truck rumbled to a stop in front of the house. Who knew that the sound of a crappy truck could perk Dean’s dick up like that? Then again, Dean’d been hard on and off since he’d left the store. He was desperate to get Cas’s hands on him.
After the pizza had been delivered, after they'd eaten, Cas brought him to the ensuite bathroom in his bedroom. He filled up his clawfoot tub with hot water and some bath salts that turned the water a deep blue, and once it was full he helped Dean in. The hot water eased the strain of Dean's muscles and the eucalyptus and lavender scent of the salts relaxed him further.
extinct. Dean is the last.”
Dean grits his teeth, jaw muscles clenching, but he nods. “Not sayin’ it wouldn’t be hard, but uh … I’ve been holdin’ back for months. I don’t want to—you
Something warm spread in Dean's chest, but he didn't have time to examine the feeling. Cas suddenly pulled back and snapped his body forward. He used his hands on Dean's hips to pull him back on his dick at the same time. Brutal thrusts that shoved his cock into Dean hard and fast and so fucking good.
Normally, Cas would’ve been itching to control the pace, to deepen it and turn it sharper, but he was trying to behave. He wanted to let Dean decide what he wanted. Slick and probing, Dean’s tongue slid along Cas's bottom lip before it slipped inside, familiar, hot. He tasted like peanut butter and jelly, and Cas let his hands drifted to Dean’s arm and the side of his neck, but he kept his touch light, just enjoying the way Dean kissed him like he was exploring.
(See the end of the chapter for
Elated at Dean’s reply, Cas’s lips twitched up. “For now, what if you ride my fingers?”
Dean so much, and he never wanted this to end.
to come.”
“Anything,” Dean said softly, and he was clinging to Cas as much as Cas was clinging to him.
Cas smirked, picking Dean’s hand up and placing it back on his bicep, eyes dark when Dean chanced a glance up at them. “Trust me, Dean, I
“Yes, sir,” Dean replied, and fuck knows why it made him so hot calling Cas that, but it did.
“Sorry,” he mumbles, shifts restlessly, but keeps his eyes on Cas’s face, “let me make it up to you?”
“Top floor,” Dean pants, “complimentary gift.” Then, like he’s struggling to maintain some form of composure with Castiel now scenting him—and God, Dean smells impossibly better up close like this, he smells like daydreams and escape and
Castiel swallows hard and sets the book down, calloused fingers of his right hand fiddling with the plain gold band on his left, thoughts travelling back through time as the song washes over him, memories surfacing of the night he lost Dean. Temporary though it'd turned out to be, it still aches when he lets himself think of those weeks.
—every inch of Dean's mouth.
So what'd you think?
The shiny double glass doors in front of the building loomed ahead. Shoulder to shoulder with Sam, it felt like walking through them was something huge and irreversible. Which didn’t make a lick of sense, because one way or another, Dad was dead. Going inside didn’t make it true … but … it made it real.
The smell of cigarette smoke doesn’t normally do anything for Dean. If it was anyone else he’d hate it, but it’s Cas, and somehow that makes it sexy. Puffs of greyish-white that float up between them as Dean crawls into his lap. Cas still isn’t looking at him, hasn’t moved an inch. Remote still clutched in one hand. The sound of the crappy cop show he was watching is low enough that Dean barely hears it, and he’s pretty sure Cas wasn’t actually paying attention to it anyway. It’s just part of how he unwinds after another shitty ass day at a job he hates. Dean knows better ways to release tension, so he settles with his legs on either side of Cas’s waist, draped over the arms of the seat. Beneath him Cas is just as hard as he is, but he’s always so good at pretending Dean doesn’t affect him.
“I—” Cas smoothed his hands over the thighs of his jeans, and then nodded. “Of course, well, the… the gate to the driveway is right over there,” Cas pointed to the left. “There’s no lock on it. You can just—and I should, uh…” He stared at Dean for a beat, looking at a loss for words.
“Fuck,” Dean whispered on a sigh, “Loved it Cas. Felt so good.”
Maybe if he’d been able to bring himself to admit the reason that he’d been staying home to Mom, she’d’ve let him have a little more time away, but he hadn't. He couldn't bring himself to tell anyone. He wasn’t ready to see disappointment and fear in their eyes when they looked at him. Why couldn’t he just be
Dean's body relaxed, and fuck if that didn’t send shocks of pleasure through Cas—if he couldn’t practically feel some barrier between them dropping. His senses sharpened, heat at the base of his spine pulling in tight.
Eventually his lungs function again and a rush of air fills them as he slides down in Cas’s lap. Lets Cas hold him, and kiss his temple, the top of his head as he floats bonelessly in the warm glow of an orgasm that he still feels the fading tingles of.
Sam chewed his lip, seemed torn between needing help and wondering whether to trust Cas. No wonder though, with the way people had turned on one another in the face of the end. “D'you just wander around cities helping random people?” Sam asked skeptically.
“Oh yeah, and what about your plans to spring Lucifer from his cage?” Dean lifted his chin defiantly. “You just gonna let us walk away from that.”
“Are you—” Cas didn’t get the chance to finish his question, Dean didn’t have an answer for it anyway.
Right now he was in Cas’s garden. Wearing the aforementioned tiny black shorts and a matching form-fitted black tee. And black protective
“Fine,” he sighed, standing up. He went and collected all of the stuff Dean had left behind.
was definitely into this stuff. Examining the various paddles and floggers had him wet, and Cas had to be able to smell it. He could definitely smell Cas's arousal, and it caused every move he made to feel electrically charged.
Dean forces himself to smile instead of narrowing his eyes in suspicion at Mr. Adler’s tone and scent. “Sounds good.”
Once he’d cleaned himself to the best of his abilities, Dean took the towel and cloth back, tossed them into the corner of his room, and promptly curled up with his head on Cas’s chest. Cas smiled as Dean heaved a satisfied sigh and stretched contently, the smell of sex and sated omega heavy in the air. “Fuck that was awesome,” Dean mumbled, cheek warm where it was pressed against Cas’s chest.
He’d be happy to come like this, it might take him a bit, but he’s pretty worked up, it’s possible he could blow his load in his underwear with Castiel grinding down on him, his hands in Dean’s hair, sliding over his jaw, sucking on Dean’s tongue in a hot as fuck preview of what else he could be using that perfect mouth for.
From its unruly hair, dark lashes framing intense gorgeous eyes, full pink lips, and a damn nice body clothed in a plain unlaced linen tunic and snug dark leather pants, feet in plain leather riding boots, Cas looked like sensuality personified.
Cas chuckled low. “Good to know.” He leaned down and sucked a kiss into Dean's flaming ass cheek. The scrape of his stubble prickled, burned. He bit down just hard enough to make Dean cry out. “You're so beautiful,” he whispered against Dean's skin. His tongue trailed over Dean's heated flesh and flicked around where his fingers were still slowly sliding in and out of Dean. He dipped it in alongside them, and it was so fucking good, Cas licking in deep.
“Cas?” Dean blinks, gaze clearing momentarily before it goes hazy again. Then he’s got his nose pressed to the side of Castiel’s neck, just under his jaw inhaling deep pulls of his scent from the source. A low groan rumbles in Dean’s chest, his voice rough and needy when he speaks, “God, you smell so good. Got no idea how damn long I wanted to do this.”
