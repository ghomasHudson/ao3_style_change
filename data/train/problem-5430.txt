His mouth felt soft and wet and hot, so damn hot, around Tony’s cockhead, and he let the moan that built in his chest escape him, let his hands slide down and clutch at Steve’s hair the way he wanted, to steady himself.  Steve gave a little mming sound, as if of pleasure, and the vibration around Tony had him gasping for breath, panting.  He could feel his chest heaving, and Steve ran his palm up and down over his hip, as if gentling him.  His hand was so warm.  Tony just—it just felt so good.  He could feel his heart pounding.  And then Steve ran his tongue over him, hot and wet and perfect, and Tony was afraid the sound he made was entirely pathetic.
“Tony,” he said again, a soft, contented, sigh, because it was all he could think of to say, couldn’t think of how to express the affection, the love, the gratitude, his satisfaction and fondness and everything else welling up in him any other way.  Tony kissed his shoulder again, the back of his neck, reached up and curled his fingers around Steve’s, sliding their hands together.  His thumb stroked over the back of Steve’s hand where it clasped loosely around it, over his wrist.  Tony’s cock was still inside him, nestled inside his body, warm and very present, and oh, that was good.  Steve tried not to squeeze down on him, knowing he had to be oversensitive, but he couldn’t help the urge just a little, and Tony gasped.  More come trickled out over Steve’s rear, his thighs, and he sighed.
Tony was still smiling at him; he could see it out of the corner of his eyes.  He curled his hand more firmly around Steve’s and squeezed, rubbing his thumb against the heel of his palm now.
It felt so good, letting himself sink into that rhythm, and Tony felt his self-consciousness at the silky stocking on his legs, the strange clinging softness encasing his feet and his toes, the lacy lingerie clinging to what curves his body had with every movement, fade away, until there was only the heat and ache and pressure of Steve’s cock in his mouth, the wet slickness and slide, the way Tony had to pant, drooling around it, as he dragged in air through his nose, opened up his mouth for it. Steve’s hand was tugging gently, so gently, at his hair, petting and gripping and stroking like he couldn’t stop, like he had to keep his hand moving, groaning nonstop now, and Tony let that spur him on, opened his mouth even wider, somehow, and let Steve’s massive cock slide in to the back of his throat, a test run, letting himself get used to the heavy girth, the length.
“Gotcha,” Steve said. He was still stroking, rubbing there gently.  “Can’t say I’m surprised.  You always tighten up so fast.”  There was a wet noise, sucking, from behind Tony, and Tony realized Steve was sucking on his fingers, and groaned.  His cock jerked again, and then Steve was petting a wet finger over his hole, working it slowly inside.  He was being gentle, slow, but it felt—it felt huge, with just his spit slicking it, made Tony feel invaded, open, fragile somehow, as it burned slightly against the tight muscle.  Steve crooked it inside, rubbed gently around him, massaging, even as he felt him go up on his knees, reach over his head to snag the bottle of lube out off the dresser Tony had left his makeup on.  Steve was rubbing his other spit-wet finger against Tony’s perineum now, and the touch made Tony feel sensitive, strangely good, shivering and breathless, and he realized he was relaxing with that pleasure even as Steve drew his finger out (the burn, the friction, making Tony groan, tight and hot), then slicked it, rubbed slick lube over his hole, massaging around it, over it, for long moments before he pushed his finger back in.
Steve was vividly aware of his own heart pounding in his ears, in his pulse in that hot, almost painful, pulse of desire that was his own cock.  Just watching Tony there like that, panting, dragging in deep lungfuls of air, his rear a bright rosy red, his thighs hot and marked with welts from the strap, his rear also hot and welted and starting to swell, and Tony hard the whole time, every so often sobbing and pressing his hot, lovely rear end back for more of it.  Eventually, Steve laid down one last, hard swat, the hardest yet, at the very lowest point on both Tony’s thighs he was willing to go, another against Tony’s sit spot, right at the sensitive spot his thighs met his rear, then tossed the strap aside, his heart, his desire, pounding hot and heavy in his ears. He picked up the strap, the floggers, and moved them to the nearby chair, laying the white doeskin one carefully on top, then turned back to the bed just as Tony was dazedly, clumsily pushing himself up on his arms and mumbling, “Steve?”  He sounded anxious, a little breathless, not quite certain of where Steve was and if he would come back, and then Steve was there, lying down on the bed beside him, pulling Tony over on top of him, pushing the pillow out of the way and taking Tony’s face in both hands.  Tony’s body was hot, sweaty, damp over his, through his clothes, warm and solid in Steve’s arms.
Steve’s mouth looked wet, wet and pink already, shiny with saliva.  He smiled, a sweet little quirk of one side of his mouth that made Tony’s belly clench, his chest feel tight, and then he was leaning in again, opening his mouth and licking gently at the tip of Tony’s cock.  His tongue was big and wet and warm and almost as dexterous, as controlled, as the rest of him, and the feel of it as he laved it over the tip of Tony’s cock, ran it down first one side, then the other, had Tony whining in his throat.  He could feel sweat rising on his forehead, his neck, under his arms.  He squirmed under Steve, trying not to thrust rudely up into his mouth.
Steve gasped, writhed, losing himself in the white hot pleasure, tossing his head back, and his hands slid down, gripped at Tony’s hot sensitive shoulders, only half on purpose, and Tony cried out softly, wetly, a broken little hot needy cry, panting around Steve’s cock, and Steve did it again, barely noticing the way Tony rubbed his cock against the bed between Steve’s legs as he did, but still somehow logging it in the back of his brain, and then Tony was sinking down on him again and he couldn’t think at all, just enough to slide his hands back up and tangle them in Tony’s hair, holding his head, feeling his muscles flex with the effort of will it took not to just yank Tony down on his cock and thrust up into his sweet, perfect throat.
“Strip down for me,” Brock said, idly, and tossed back the rest of his beer as Steve hopped to.  His hands fumbled on his boots, with his slacks already sliding down, and Brock laughed, laughed again as his dick sprang free, sore and hard, and sent a spatter of precome up into Steve’s face.  “Filthy,” Brock said, and grabbed Steve by the back of his neck, kissed his forehead, and shoved him toward the bed.
Steve shook his head, rested his hands on Tony’s hips, just for a moment, then just wrapped his arms around him, tracing his palms warm over Tony’s skin, the slenderness of his hips, the fullness of his rear, up over the small of his back.
“God, good boy,” Tony breathed, moaned, lifting his hips for Steve again, and Steve’s hand slid down, curved around his ass, squeezing, pulling him in.  His hand was so warm, and that was so hot, Steve manhandling him gently, all his strength turned to pulling Tony close almost needily, like he wanted him further in his mouth.  Letting Steve angle him how he wanted him was somehow incredibly hot, and Tony heard himself groan as pleasure went through him at Steve pulled back over his cock, then pushed forward again, letting Tony’s length slide forward into him again.  Watching his own cock slide between those soft, wet lips was incredibly hot, the way Steve’s eyes were half-lidded but he still looked incredibly focused, like he was thinking only about how to make this good for Tony.  Steve was flushed all over, though, and his chest was heaving, which usually meant he was turned on himself, and he was huffing through his nose hot and heavy.  “You’re a natural.  Are you liking this?  Like getting your mouth on my cock?  You’ve been wanting that, huh?  Is this getting you hard, big fella?  It going to your cock?  Sucking my dick for me?”
Tony was still talking to him as he led him out of the shower, and Steve just let it wash over him.  It was all praise, sweet wonderful things about how well Steve had done, how good he was—how good he was at holding still, every little thing he did, and all of it made him feel so good, made inexpressible fondness and warmth well up within him for Tony at the same time.  He knew he was smiling at him, probably stupidly, dopey, as he rested his hands on Tony’s shoulders and Tony dried him off with one of his big, huge, soft as anything fluffy white towels, gentle, so gentle, over his back and his buttocks, before he had him lie down on it, spread out over the floor.  The floor of Tony’s bathroom was heated, so Steve lay down on the towel willingly and let himself just enjoy it, the warmth of the floor under him, the pleasure of being prone, the pricking throb of his pecs against the towel, the gentle way Tony cleaned the welts on his shoulders and back and spread ointment over them.  He would have put gauze, too, and taped them up, like a battle wound, but Steve laid a hand on his wrist, smiled up at him and shook his head, and Tony just grinned ruefully and put the gauze away again.
And then sometimes it was like afterwards the crushing despair would get even worse, like the grey cloud would turn into a black cloud of crushing agony, and he’d wonder why he’d even bothered to open his eyes that morning, he’d wish the serum had let him die when he’d been meant to, he’d wondered what was so wrong with him that he needed this, that he craved it, that he let his subordinate slap him around and got off to it, that he needed someone to tell him when he was allowed to come to the point he didn’t even jerk himself off at home in his apartment anymore—it felt too wrong, too unfulfilling, without Brock there to tell him whether he was allowed to come or not and spank him red and raw and bruised if he came when he shouldn’t so it hurt to sit down, and he flinched when he settled into his chair at the briefing table, without someone to tell him he’d done it right after.  It was pathetic, but there it was.  He’d used to jerk off every night before bed—now, more often than not, he went to bed hard and aching, unless Brock had given him the word that he’d be welcome at his place.
Steve beamed at him, smiled up at him.  “That’s good, Tony,” he murmured.  “That’s so good.  You’re so good for me.”  He slid his hands up, over Tony’s ass, his hips, slid them down over his groin, let his thumbs slide gently, pressing soft, against Tony’s neatly trimmed pubic hair, framing his caged cock, then slid them up again, over Tony’s belly, up over his sides, thumbed gently at his nipples.
“Sir,” Steve managed, breathily, his voice sounding choked and wet despite the wispy breathy quality it had acquired somewhere, an acknowledgment of what he was saying even as he trembled down to his toes with the knowledge of it, wanted to moan.
“Not at all,” Steve said, and enjoyed watching Tony very deliberately bite into the same place he had.  He watched Tony chew, swallow, lick icing off his lips, then leaned forward, brushed a few crumbs away from his beard.
Steve jerked him off a little longer, working him through it just the way Tony had done for him, feeling Tony’s head loll against his shoulder as he gasped out his pleasure. When Steve looked at him, his eyes were closed, his face twisted up as he shivered, panting, his stomach heaving, as he twisted his body as if he wanted to press himself in against Steve, curl up against him.
“Oh, I try,” Steve said, settling his hand at the small of Tony’s back, making sure he had a good grip to hold him steady on his lap.  He pushed his mug into his hands and pulled the plate of cookies over, then picked up his own mug, held it toward Tony’s.  “To your health,” he said.
Steve flushed a little darker.  “Yessir,” he said, low.  His eyes flicked from Tony’s face to his lips to his chest to his dick again.
“Yes, yes, sir,” he panted, and his eyes still felt wet.  Tony hummed, pulled his foot back and gave Steve a little kick, flicking his cock up so that it smacked against his belly again, and Steve moaned, flinched, startled more than anything by the sudden hot bright pain.  Tony did it again, and the hot little spark of pain it sent through Steve had him messy and leaking a wet little burst of precome all over again.
, if he was still too goddamn tight, struggling to take in a deep breath, to blow it out, to relax, and then Steve was slipping into him, deep and quick and slick, over his soft wet insides, deep inside, and Tony was gasping as he opened up around him, as he sank down on top of him and Steve went deep in just one thrust, caught Tony’s hips, pulled out almost to the head and pushed in again, went deeper, then rocked, flexed his hips just once more, pulling himself out and dragging over Tony’s insides, pushing back in, and then he was letting Tony sink down over him again, he was fully sheathed inside him and Tony was moaning.  He felt so
, and his body trembled and his toes curled, feet trembling as he squeezed them against the sides of the bed.  Tony was going to torture his, his
“Not sure if you want more,” Tony murmured, stroking Steve’s neck, his jaw, lightly again.  His eyes were fixed on Steve’s, watchful, somehow careful.  “But I’d like to give you more.  What do you say, big fella, huh?”
“Yes,” Tony said, softly. “Yes, I, I thought about you, Steve. Thought about you, like this, just like this.”
“Aw, you shut up,” Steve said, laughing as he pulled himself up over Tony’s chest, pressed him down into the bed with his welcome weight, and cupped both hands around Tony’s face.  Tony found himself smiling up into his gorgeous, glorious smile, lifted his arms just enough to link them around Steve’s vast forearms and hang on.  “Just glad you liked it, is all.”  He rubbed a hand up, through Tony’s hair.  “You always do it so nice for me.”
Steve smiled up at Tony quickly, eyes bright and very flushed.  “Yessir, sure do,” he said, then dipped his head again, swallowed heavily.  “I mean,” he said.  “I do for me—you—you always make it so good for me, but if you learned how to do it, I mean.  I’d like to make it—make it good for you, too.”  He squared his shoulders and took a breath, raised his head again and met Tony’s eyes.  “I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’d like to give you a blow, this time, mister,” he said.
“And a garter belt, too,” Steve said, sounding overwhelmed, watching in the mirror as Steve slid his fingers up, along the garters, along his thighs, to rub over the tight fabric of the garter belt.  He pushed the little skirt up, and then Tony reached down, pulled it and held it against his belly obligingly with one hand, so that Steve could see it, the soft pattern of floral dots over it, rub at it with his fingers.  It made Tony’s cock feel strangely held in tight, compressed, nowhere to go where the garter belt fit snugly over his groin, held him down against his groin, his belly, compressed under the panties and the tight garter belt, throbbing helpless and tight, hot and needy, as Steve rubbed his hands up and down over the garter belt, over the slight bulge that was all it revealed at his groin.  Steve made a low, deep, needy sound in the back of his throat, watching Tony swell there just the tiniest bit as he stroked him, and burrowed his face in against the back of his neck, sucking wet, hot kisses there, along his nape, over his neck, until Tony’s was squirming.  Steve’s face felt hot against his skin, his shoulders and pecs hot against Tony’s back through the thin soft lace, so he was turned on and flushing desperately the way he did when he really needed it, already.
This one was another fur flogger, this one made out of Spanish lamb wool fur.  It was softer, woolier, felt like velvet to the touch, plush and a little harder, a little heavier, the leather buffed velvety smooth on the other side.  Still, it was more sensation than anything, with no pain, just a soft poofy thump that would tingle and slide over Tony’s skin, go a little deeper into the muscle.
“Yes, sir,” Steve mumbled.  He felt a pang of loss even before Tony shifted his weight, but he knew he couldn’t stay there forever.  He still appreciated the way Tony kissed his shoulder again, wrapped his hand around Steve’s arm at his elbow, as he moved back and the warmth of him inside left Steve, pulling out of his wet hole with a soft noise and a sense of sudden emptiness and a few trickles of Tony’s come.  Tony’s thumb brushed over him there a moment later, and Steve gasped, wished he’d put his fingers inside, stroke him where he was wet and dripping, push them deep and stop him up, tease him, but Tony just stroked gently over the wet, tender rim.
“Yeah, for me,” Tony murmured, and his voice sounded hoarse.  “All right, sweetheart, let’s see what I can do here, huh?”  His hand pressed flat against Steve’s stomach, then slid up along his chest, making him shiver and shake under the bright shivery sensations it brought with it, until he reached one of the weights, and then he
Steve felt himself go warm and probably red, couldn’t help his smile in return.  “I’m really grateful,” he said.  “Sir.”
“Gorgeous fella,” Steve said, grinning and warming to his theme now.  He caught Tony’s wrists in his, rubbed gently against the pulse at each of them.  “With his gorgeous blue eyes and his long eyelashes that could’ve been on some Hollywood beauty without even any need for makeup and pretty lips and defined cheekbones and ridiculously nice, soft, thick hair and—” he slid his hands up, then down, under the blanket, following the line of Tony’s shoulders and back to squeeze gently, teasingly, caressingly, at Tony’s tight behind “—and the tightest, most beautiful backside I’ve ever seen?”
And then Brock backhanded him across the face.  It hurt, of course it hurt, a hot bright sting across his face, and Steve thought it might have split his lip, it felt so hot.  Brock grabbed his chin, forced his head up again, rubbing his thumb in against the sting until Steve could feel it bruising.  “I don’t want you thinking about Stark,” he ground, and it was gritty, like gravel over a wound.  “I want you thinking about me.”
“Mmm,” Tony said.  His eyes were hazy, dreamy, and he looked soft and well-kissed and a little drowsy himself.  He leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder as Steve started to carry him out of the room and found the stairs.  “Nah.  I set up everything with holiday bonuses and the holiday work schedule for Stark, and I think we’ve got everyone covered with shift rotations and presents here, too.  You did most of that anyway.”
“Tony,” he groaned, through his wet, soft lips, his own voice so low and groaning and husky he almost didn’t recognize it.  Tony just grinned, smiled and rubbed at his hot, prickling tit with his thumb, along the curve of it, up under his nipple and over, and Steve gasped, squirmed under him.
Tony’s program made Steve very glad he’d gone earlier in the night.  Steve was painfully aware that he was no artist.  Tony … was.  That didn’t even come close to describing what he did out there, though.  He didn’t have the biggest jumps Steve had ever seen, that was true, but it hardly mattered.  He was even better than Steve remembered from Nationals and Worlds. Tony might have said that Steve had perfect jumps (
“I love you,” Steve choked out over his suddenly tight throat.  “Thank you so much for this.  For—for being here.  For doing this for me.”
Steve smiled against his forehead.  “Mmhmm,” he said, curling his fingers in Tony’s hair and tugging lightly.  “Tomorrow.”
“What else can I do for you, stud?” he mumbled, reached down to close his fingers around Steve’s cock again, drag them up, tugging on it gently.  “What’s next?  How d’you want me?”
, stud.  Now that you can do that, I’m yours for life, you know that?  All you have to do is get down on your knees and suck my brains out through my cock, and—”
Then it struck him that his head really, really hurt.  His arm—didn’t, but it felt strange, like he couldn’t have moved it if he tried, and he didn’t want to try, but his head was a sharp, heavy, throbbing mass of pain.  He took a sharp breath in through his nose at the pain—bit the inside of his cheek against making a sound.  It made opening his eyes a lot less attractive a proposition, but he wanted to see if Tony was really there.  He felt like he would feel better if he could just—see Tony sitting there, rest his eyes on him.  That’d be better than any painkiller, he was pretty sure.  It might even make his head hurt less.  He wasn’t sure how that would work, but he felt like it would.
Tony felt himself laugh, delighted by the gruff, grudging way Steve had given him that compliment.  “Why thank you, darling,” he said.  “I could say the same about you, gorgeous.”
“Yeah,” Tony said breathlessly.  “That’s the way my perfect pain slut likes his pleasure, huh?”  He tugged ruthlessly on Steve’s stinging nipple, until he was crying out, mouth hanging open, panting.  “No sweetness for my sweetheart without an awful lot of
“Yeah,” he breathed.  “You do that for me, all right, champ?  Get your hand around your cock and think about how my dick felt in your mouth—how I tasted—all hot and heavy, huh?  Filling your mouth up really nice, all hot on your big strong tongue, big fella, yeah, you’re doing so great, Steve; you’re perfect.  Damn, you look so good; never going to forget you like this.  You look incredible.  Can’t wait to see you come with my dick in your mouth.  You’re gonna come for me, right?  I want to watch, I want to see you shoot off like this, cover yourself in your own spunk while you hold me in your mouth, huh?  I bet you want that, too.  You like it when I watch you come, don’t you, Steve?  Sure, it embarrasses you, you flush bright red, but that’s part of why you like it so much.”
Whenever they did this, Steve watched Tony’s every response even more carefully than normal, watching for every twitch, every quiver, every indrawn gasp of breath, and he always felt himself getting caught up in it, in Tony’s reactions, feeling warm as Tony gasped and shuddered, at the burgeoning hardness he could see between the part of Tony’s legs as Tony writhed, hitched his knee up against the bed as he rubbed it down against the covers and spread himself wide enough to give a good view of his tight balls and filling cock.  He just loved seeing Tony like this, responding to him, gone high on sensations, reacting, trembling, raw and honest and real and almost helpless under him, and they’d just barely started, loved watching him for each response, each tell, so that Tony’s body could tell him what to do, how to strike him, how to bring him pleasure.  He felt himself getting hard, straining his briefs, against his soft slacks, and swallowed, knowing he’d be throbbing with want the entire time he was doing this; he always was.  It added to it, for him, that heat and throbbing desire, pounding in his cock, in his head, his pulse beating through his entire body, it felt like, but he had to be careful to focus, anyway.  Tony deserved his full attention, always.
“’m good,” Tony panted. And it was true, there wasn’t as much of the strain in his muscles, in his thighs, as he usually felt, and Steve had gotten him good and wet, good and open.  To prove it, he lifted himself up with his thighs, pressing his calves against the floor, until a few inches of Steve slid out of him, rocked himself over it, then let himself slide back down.  The feeling was utterly overwhelming, not even exactly pleasure, just intense
Steve blinked, his brain still feeling soft and thick and slow, and licked his lips.  “’Course,” he said again, swallowing against the hoarse words.  “Every time, Shellhead.”  Tony was holding him, and it felt so, so good, his arms around him, his body against his, blanketing him.  Tony’s body was keeping him warm, he thought, and smiled to himself, floating on it.
“Feels really,” Tony groaned, “really good, Steve.”  He whined a little, pushed his hand forward into Steve’s palm, rubbing back and forth, desperately.  “Really good.”
“You look like I’ve had you,” Steve said, “and boy, have I ever had you.”  He stroked Tony’s sides, gently, and Tony trembled under him. “Look at you, sweetheart,” Steve murmured.  “My little princess, with his loose stockings down around his knees and his garter belt and his skirt pushed up around his waist so I could get at his pretty cock and his panties pulled down to reveal his hole and that pretty cock.”  He reached down, stroked Tony’s belly again, rubbed it with one hand.  Tony squirmed, feeling hyper-aware of his soft cock between his legs, his exhausted panting, his liquid, tired muscles.
, of being whatever somebody else wanted, for their use, just for them, not for himself, and it was wonderful, and he pressed his forehead into the back of his hand and ground out, “
Tony gave a glad, sobbing, breathless little cry and pushed up into his arms, kissing him back, bound hands going up so that his fingers could twine into Steve’s hair as he arched up into the kiss, legs one leg splayed wide over Steve’s, as he panted against him.  His mouth was sweet, soft, giving, open for Steve’s tongue, and Steve kissed him deeply, soft and slow and loving, his hand going to the back of Tony’s neck to support him, until he heard the way that Tony was gasping and moaning, felt how much he needed a breath in the heaving of his chest against him, and pulled away.
it,” Tony said, warm and teasing, his voice still a little weary, a little thick and blurred and heavy from his own orgasm.  He slid both hands up, curled his fingers in against Steve’s hands and squeezed.  Steve squeezed back, smiling at the gesture.  He liked that.  Tony holding his hands like that.  Rubbing his thumbs over his knuckles.  He liked that a lot.
Tony’s hands came down, sudsy with shampoo, and tilted his face up gently, framing it as Steve looked up at him.  His thumb brushed suds over Steve’s cheek as it caressed him in a gentle circle, and he tasted it as he swiped it across Steve’s bottom lip.  Tony smiled down at him, and everything in Steve felt right.
“You’re good luck for me, too, Winghead,” he said, and Steve must have gone red all over, must have blushed.  He felt hot all over, anyway, even if maybe his slightly burned face hid the flush.  He dropped his eyes, ducked his chin, couldn’t help it.
Tony felt himself turn even hotter.  Okay, so maybe Steve was right about that.  Tony liked to be … clean, inside, when they did this, and this time, well, it had seemed fitting that he make extra sure.  So yeah, he’d spent a lot of time on it.  “Okay,” he said, and it came out all breathy and soft, “sure, I, yeah, I did do that, but.”
He knew he didn’t need a hand on his cock to come, but he didn’t even really think about it, think that thought; it was just an awareness he had, all through him without conscious thought.  But at the same time he never wanted this to end; he wanted Tony to just—just use him, fuck him until he came inside of him, heedless of Steve’s own peak, and Steve could feel his come dripping out of him, out of the hole Tony had used for his pleasure, and he shivered and gasped just at the thought, his hands clenching into fists against the bed, against the covers.
, and that was all that mattered.  It was like being in a, a perfect dream, the way he was bound and helpless, prickling with pain, with welts, from shoulders to rear, the way Tony was talking to him, was touching him, and he was so gone, he was
“C’mere, mister,” he said, and pulled Tony a little closer, on top of him, between his legs.  “We’re due some cuddling time, I think.”
“My pleasure, big fella,” he murmured, and his voice sounded hoarse, and then his hands were back in Steve’s hair, massaging shampoo into them, and Steve sighed, let his eyes slide closed, let his head rest in Tony’s hands as he rubbed them through his hair, over his scalp, over the back of his neck, massaging in the shampoo, then rinsing it out.  There was some kind of conditioner, or something, next, but Steve didn’t argue, just let Tony do his thing.  Everything was a pleasant haze.  Tony was the only solid thing in the world, Tony under his hands, Tony’s hands in his hair.
That was even probably true, Steve reflected.  Tony was such a sweetheart.  He curled his arms around Tony’s waist and closed his eyes, pressing close, letting half of his weight or so rest on Tony.  Tony just laughed and scratched at his hair some more, and Steve let his eyes slide closed, as Tony scratched his scalp, petted his hair, rubbed the back of his neck. Tony always made him feel so good.
“Mind if I do a few things, too?” Steve said, smiling a little fondly, sheepishly, now, playing with the strap of Tony’s garter.  “While you’re working on cleaning up for me.”
Tony was clearly feeling good with this one, soft and loose and lost in it, so Steve kept it up for a while, sliding the tails down Tony’s back again, then back up over his rump, then starting in there, too, bringing more of that deep, rosy flush up the surface, down over his thighs, then back up.  There was no rush, and if Tony was feeling good, Steve wanted to prolong that as long as possible.  A lot of people would have been constrained by their arm getting tired, but that was something the serum had done for him, at least.  He wouldn’t be having that problem.  And it was easy for him to calculate the power behind his blows, pull them just enough that he could keep going at this soft, even pace without making Tony’s skin start to really burn just from force or friction.  Tony started to twist his hips, panting, rub himself forward against the blankets, after a while, and Steve smiled, let the soft tails slither softly, intimately, between Tony’s legs for a moment, with no force behind it, just to make him shudder and gasp, grip tightly at the blankets above his head, buck his hips up and down, his rump back, before he twirled the tails up again and hit them solidly against the center of Tony’s rear cheek, made him gasp and moan out low and deep again.
“Good?” Steve murmured, and Tony could feel his smile against his skin as he turned his face against Tony’s jaw, laid a kiss there.  He reached up, stroked gentle fingers along Tony’s throat, against his jaw, squeezed his shoulder, holding him up with his damp, come-sticky hand on his hip now, then rubbed his stomach again.  “You still there, fella?”
Steve figured it would probably be unforgivably whiny for Captain America to complain about how far away the bathroom was, but, by God, he felt like it was the Pyrenees all over again.  He sighed and pressed his face closer into Tony’s shoulder, let Tony’s hand come up and stroke at his short hair, tousling it gently, stroking evenly.  He let Tony stroke his hair, soothing and gentle and slow, until his mind was nothing but a soft haze, and he followed automatically when Tony lifted his face with one hand, pressed a gentle kiss to his mouth, which fell open just for him, then squeezed the back of his neck gently and slid his arm around Steve’s waist, pushing him gently in the direction of the bathroom.  His feet felt heavy, his legs wobbly and liquid, but Tony was guiding him, and then they were there, and Tony kissed the back of his neck again and he was somehow inside Tony’s big walk-in shower, sitting on the bench, as Tony fiddled with the spray.  He leaned back against the wall, but the smooth onyx surface was uncomfortably cool and present on his sore, welted shoulders, and he winced, rounded one shoulder and leaned forward again, only to feel Tony’s sympathetic gaze on him.
When Steve coated his fingers in lube and returned one lube slick finger to Tony’s hole, rubbing it gently around the muscle, making Tony tremble at the cool slickness of the lubricant, it felt vivid and intense, made him moan.  “Shh, that’s it,” Steve murmured, sucking on his own bottom lip again. “God, you’re so smooth and velvety, your
Tony caressed his cheek again, let his head drop to Steve’s shoulder, the brush of his soft hair a welcome weight, and then he was straightening again and his grin was changing, becoming more mischievous.  “You’re hard again, you know,” he said.  “Already.”
), but as always, the sight of Tony’s triple axel practically gave Steve an inferiority complex all by itself.  There was just no one else skating who did it like him, and he looked even stronger on it than he had earlier that year.  Any day Steve got to see Tony Stark’s triple axel was a good day. But there was so much more than that. Tony was skating to Frank Sinatra, now, which was a change of program from the exhibition he’d been doing earlier that year.  Steve wasn’t quite sure if he should admit how Tony’s interpretation of the music got him a little hot under the collar.  Tony was
Tony circled the tip of his shoe around Steve’s cockhead, once, twice, then he got the sole up over it and pushed down, pressing Steve’s hot, achingly flushed cock, already painfully hard and wet, down against the floor.  He wasn’t even pressing down that hard, but as Steve’s sensitive tip hit the floor and rolled against it, then the rest of his cock followed, with that gentle insistent pressure, the pain that sparked through Steve had him giving a choked noise as overwhelmed tears of sensation sprang up to prickle in his eyes.  Tony flexed his foot over Steve’s cock, pressed down a little more, and the pain tore through him like a hot glorious wave, making Steve go cold all over, then hot, sweat springing up, and pleasure pounding impossibly deep and hard all through him, tugging behind his navel, in his brain.  He heard himself give a rough cry, full-voiced and low, torn right out of him, felt his head loll back heavily against Tony’s steadying hands.
“Hey,” Steve said, and smiled up at him, breathlessly.  Tony smiled back, couldn’t help it, feeling hot and floaty, breathless himself. Steve slid a hand up Tony’s sweaty back, stroked gently, coaxed him forward, and then Tony was pressing into him, his caged cock hard and pressing into Steve’s firm stomach between them. “Shh,” Steve said, let Tony gasp out a breath, let his head slump down onto his shoulder, his shoulders rounding in order to do it, and Tony had a brief thought that that was absolutely horrible posture, but Steve was kissing his hair and he didn’t care.  “Let me take over, sweetheart, you relax.”
So even though Steve had known it was the wrong thing to do, that he shouldn’t be sleeping with a subordinate, part of his team on STRIKE, and certainly not after he’d been drinking (his mouth still tasted of beer), he’d let Rumlow slide his hands down the back of Steve’s jeans, into his back pockets, and squeeze in lewd gropes, let him rock the hot hardness of their erections together through belts and trousers, let him bite bruising marks down the slope of his neck and mourn aloud that they were already healing, running his thumb over them, over Steve’s slick, gasping mouth.
“So good,” Tony hastened to assure him, lifting his head just slightly.  “So, so good, Steve.  It was everything I wanted.”  It felt so good to have Steve using him when he was like this, felt locked up and contained and ready to be used for Steve’s pleasure, to have Steve come inside him, down his throat, in his ass.  It felt so good to have that pleasure of Steve fucking him, slow and soft.
Steve stroked a hand through his hair as he pulled away, slid his hand down Tony’s chest, thumbing gently at his nipple, and Tony shuddered under him, opened his eyes to half-lidded slits because that was about all he felt capable of just then, he felt so dizzy and warm with sensation.  “I want to make you feel good,” Steve said.
“Yeah, I’m good,” Tony said then, after a moment, still low and soft, breathy.  “’m good for more.  Go to town, sugarpie.”
“Tony,” he gasped, and he could feel his mouth hanging open, the way he was panting, shivering, hot all over.
And Steve kind of liked it, too—well, more than kind of, the sharp crack of his hand hitting against Tony’s bare skin that quickly translated into warmth, the rhythm of it, the way Tony’s rump got so warm so quick beneath his hand, watching Tony’s reactions as he writhed and panted and moaned under him.  He liked actually touching Tony, and he felt like Tony liked to actually feel his bare hand, just as much as Steve liked to touch him.  So he liked to start with this, with barehanded spanking, to get Tony warmed up.
“Just about,” Steve agreed, and ducked his head forward, let his lips linger over Tony’s forehead in the lightest brush of a kiss.
Tony dragged in a quick, hard, shaky breath, pressed his face against Steve’s back, between his shoulder blades, so that his forehead pushed into the muscle between Steve’s shoulders as he gasped unsteadily, then his hands came up and both arms squeezed around Steve’s chest in a kind of hug.  “Just glad I can do you justice,” he said, and it came out breathless and scratchy.
Stark’s smile was a little disbelieving this time.  “Really,” he said, “because I seem to recall stealing your national title out from under you, Captain America.”
“I know you will,” Steve mumbled, or he thought he did.  He closed his eyes, and his head hurt so badly he thought he might have imagined the pressure of a soft kiss against the top of it before he heard the door swing closed.
“Mind if I use your shower?” he asked, and the words came out of him slower, softer than he’d been expecting.  His mind still felt soft, dazed and hazy and permeable.
“Wh-whatever you want, sir,” Steve managed to slur out, wet against his forearm, and there was silence for a moment.
“Merry Christmas to me,” Tony said, and his smile was brighter than every light in the house as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him again, and they stayed there, for a moment, just kissing at the top of the stairs.
“Oh, I’m gonna,” Brock growled, almost grunting, “trust me, you big needy slut,” and then he smacked Steve’s cock so hard, between his legs, with the back of his hand, his knuckles, that Steve felt tears come to his eyes as the shock went through him, the pain starting a moment later, as he doubled over, gasping.
“Good boy,” he said, “there’s my good boy, yeah, so good for it, aren’t you sweetheart?”  He moved one hand away, squeezing Steve’s left pectoral with his other hand until he was whining through his open mouth, and wiped it on the rag he’d left on the bed before he slid it up, cupped Steve’s jaw—Tony’s hand felt warm even against his hot skin, warm and prickling with sensation that lingered—and slid his thumb into Steve’s mouth, against the side of it, holding it open as he kissed him again.  The oil was an edible one, tasted like almonds and cinnamon and a little like peppers, and Tony’s mouth was hot and sweet and wet and the kiss was messy, leaving saliva spilling out over his chin, his jaw, against Tony’s lips, the noises wet and soft as Steve’s eyes slid closed and he pressed into the kisses, as the wet sound of their tongues and lips against each other, Tony sucking kisses into his mouth, filled the room.
He hadn’t realized exactly when Rumlow had started flirting with him, hadn’t realized Rumlow was flirting with him at all at first.  And then he hadn’t quite believed it wasn’t just his imagination, because—a fella?  Flirting with him?  Out in the open like that?  The way it had made his belly clench up with want and need and longing made it feel like—like it couldn’t possibly be real, he’d felt his face going hot, sweat, hot and nervous, slicking his hands and under his arms and the back of his neck just like it was doing now.  But Rumlow had been making it obvious, then, licking his bottom lip in such a . . . sexual way, rubbing his thumb against it, then against his pool cue, even parting his lips, sucking on the cue, and Steve—Steve had known he shouldn’t, had known Rumlow was probably drunk, but he’d still ended up with Rumlow shoving him into the wall outside the restroom, slick, messy kisses that made him go hot, made him push into them eagerly—because he hadn’t known that a kiss could be so hot and biting, so eager and intense, and Rumlow had gotten a hand up into his hair and
“If you’re sure,” Steve said, firmly, but he was already reaching for the next flogger he’d laid out. He’d planned this in advance, how he wanted to progress, and so far it seemed to be working on Tony exactly how he’d wanted it, so that was a good sign.  Maybe he was getting better at knowing exactly how much his guy could take, and how.
The doeskin was soft, supple and smooth, and Steve could see Tony shiver with each smooth, creamy slide of the falls down over his back from the warm mark it had left on his skin. Steve let it linger, slipping down softly over his skin, dragging smooth and soft and just a little heavy over his back, each time, before he brought his arm back and swung the tails back down again.  Tony was really getting into it now, Steve could tell, the way he gasped and moaned with each soft tease of the flogger down his back, could see his hard length between his legs whenever he shifted, thick and ruddy and fully hard now, leaving sticky little trails of precome on the covers when he shifted, rolling his hips every so often, breathless little pants escaping his lips without him even seeming to realize it.  That was exactly how, where, Steve wanted him (and he could feel his own cock, hard and throbbing and hot between his legs, give a needy throb every time Tony made one of those soft little sounds or bobbed his hips, all lithe, rolling enticement, but it wasn’t time for that yet), and it made him feel good, not just turned on, but good, tender and soft and tight and warm in his chest, to watch him like that.
“St-Steve,” he stuttered out, feeling his hands slip down the sides of the mirror, sweaty and desperate, but then Steve was slipping an arm around Tony’s middle, one over his hip, down along his thigh, rubbing a finger gently under one loose stocking, then gripping him gently and pulling him back, and back, until his back was to Steve’s chest, and he was cradled in his lap, against his thighs.  The movement pushed him back on Steve’s cock, and Tony cried out, arched his back, gasping, but didn’t fight it.  Steve was sliding inside, deep and inexorable, and it felt—good, overwhelming, overwhelming heat and fullness and depth, like his whole body felt the sensation of being spread open on Steve’s big cock as he sank down on it.  Steve rubbed his belly, murmured endearments to him, kissed at the side of his neck, down over his shoulder, bracing him at his thigh, fingers gripping tight but not painful just above Tony’s panties where they’d slipped down his thighs slightly. Tony thought he probably looked incredibly wrecked, if he’d had the energy to look up at himself in the mirror, but the sensations were just too overwhelming, and he couldn’t help throwing back his head, gasping, eyes shut tight just in order to process them.
Brock had fisted his hand in his hair and dragged his head back and Steve had gone even hotter, even brighter all over, had gasped aloud, even as he said, “Can I hear that again, Cap?  You red-faced slut.”
Tony sniffed a bit, caressed Steve’s face a little more, callused fingertips soft against his skin, then both his hands fell to curl over Steve’s pecs, against the clamps and his sore nipples, holding them and supporting them gently, as he bent his head and he gave Steve that kiss, as their lips touched gently, softly, as softly as flower petals, as a cotton blanket gentle over his skin, as silk.  Steve moaned, felt his mouth fall open, and Tony’s tongue swiped gently, so softly, wet and warm, along his bottom lip, warm and soft as it dipped inside his mouth and made him shudder in Tony’s arms.  He moaned, arched up into it, sucked on Tony’s tongue, and Tony kissed him deeper, and something in him unspooled, went even softer, soft and pliant and easy and sweet.  Tony made a soft noise, one of pleasure, and Steve went even deeper, pliant and easy, for him, couldn’t help it, he just wanted to give Tony everything, give it all up to him, give him everything he had to give.
Steve flushed, looked down, then back up at Tony, bit his bottom lip.  “Just as long as I can please you,” he blurted, finally, almost shyly, big body going hot over Tony’s as he met his eyes.  “That’s all I want.”
“Okay,” Tony whispered, and did, he obeyed, just went loose all through his muscles, his body, soft and relaxed.  He wasn’t sure if it was because it was what Steve had told him to do, and he felt so—so obedient, sweet and soft and wanting, like this, or because of the wonderful way Steve was rubbing his back, or just that he was already tired and felt so floaty, but he felt himself relaxing, the tightness just ebbing out of him as Steve spread his legs for him gently, hands on his thighs, pushed Tony’s knees up along his sides, then gently, slowly took over thrusting, rolling up easy and deep into Tony’s body, all soft, slow, deep pleasure that settled in his gut, made his caged cock ache, but more than that, too, spread through Tony’s whole body.  Tony let his eyes closed, just let himself lie there against Steve, his hands loose against his shoulders, draped one arm around the back of Steve’s shoulders and hugged tight and just let himself feel it, Steve deep inside him, his heavy weight, each deep, easy thrust, the pleasure it sent rubbing, dancing along his prostate, warm in his body.  Steve was stroking the back of his neck with one hand now, squeezing, massaging, and it felt so good, it felt perfect, made Tony twist his hips and rub his caged cock up against Steve again, not chasing anything, just feeling it, reveling in it, the deep thrusting pressure of Steve’s cock inside him.
Tony had had a feeling that might be what Steve was trying to lead up to, but it still hit him hard, sending warmth to coil in his stomach and leap in his cock at the same time something seemed to catch in his chest, in his throat.  He swallowed, found himself moistening his bottom lip.  Steve had only gone down on him once before, and he hadn’t thought Steve had enjoyed the experience much, or at least, he’d ended up with his face covered in spunk and coughing and bright, miserably red, even though Tony had enjoyed the act itself from Steve very much.  Steve’s humiliated reaction less so.  “You know we don’t have to,” he said.  “There’s a myriad of options open to us, all of which I’ll enjoy very much, I assure you.”  He scooted down against the pillows a bit, opened his body language up consciously, let his ankles rest against Steve’s calves, running one teasingly up along it.  Naked under Steve’s still-clothed (in a t-shirt and exercise pants, at least) bulk, he knew he looked vulnerable despite his own strength and height, especially as he raised his arms, running them up over Steve’s biceps, along his shoulders.  “You can do whatever you’d like to me,” he murmured.
Tony smiled down at him.  “Well, no, you didn’t, my dear,” he said.  “Are you planning on doing something about that?”
He’d always intended to go the longest with this one, so he used all the tricks he knew—speeding up the pace, slowing down, going lighter and lighter then back up to his usual weight, watching every one of Tony’s reactions as he did, as he moaned and shivered and bucked up back against it, as his mouth sagged open against the pillows, open and wet and he moaned and pressed his head down into it, tossing it back and forth.  He was down in it, now, so the sounds he made were more open and unrestrained, soft little yelps and gasps and oofs of effort, groans, as Steve coaxed sensation after sensation out of him with the flogger.
But Steve also knew that waiting too long would just give Tony time to get more and more anxious, worked up, waiting for the first swat, the first blow, so after Tony muttered, “I hear you,” his shoulders hunching up, Steve just rubbed one hand over his shoulders again, massaging into them, pressing them down toward the bed, and moved back to stand near where Tony’s buttocks rested at the center of the bed, reached out and laid one hand on the lush curve.  Tony gasped, drew in a long, shaking breath, but he didn’t exactly flinch, so Steve just rubbed gently at the curve, the firm, tight muscle there, for a moment.
“Mmm,” Steve hummed.  “I like that one.  Like the idea of, of.”  He flushed and ducked his head down, into Tony’s hands.  “Of pleasuring you,” he whispered.  “Of making you feel good, serving you, until you’re, you're . . . satisfied. Relaxed.”
Steve rubbed at the small of Tony’s back, stroked him up and down over his sides with both hands, rubbed at his shoulders, the back of his neck, squeezed there, then down again. “Good?” he mumbled, sucking another wet kiss at Tony’s neck, and damn, his voice had gone so low and deep, sex-rough, and Tony felt it in his gut as it squeezed tight with desire, trembled through his hips, his thighs.
But he really was the best. He was.  He seemed to know just what Tony wanted from this, just … gave it to him, no questions asked, even as Tony did his best to serve him.  It was so perfect, every time they played like this.  Tony had only had to give a stumbling, awkward explanation of why he liked this, why he even wanted his cock locked up sometimes, once.  It was like Steve just … got it.  Tony sighed, pressed close, gave Steve a hug with one arm around his back as he pressed up against him, and Steve smiled against his forehead, almost shy, Tony could feel it, nuzzling sleepily closer, breath warm and damp against Tony’s temple.  Tony wanted to tell him that, how good he was, how he was the best, the best Tony could have ever asked for, but he wasn’t sure how to say it without sounding—without sounding needy, or stupid, or just weird, so he figured he’d wait until tomorrow, because Steve deserved to hear it from him, but he was so, so sleepy, and he couldn’t think how to say it, and he just felt so good and tired and relaxed and exhausted, couldn’t think at all.
“Are my kisses better than Jarvis’s whipped cream?” Steve asked, pressing more kisses against Tony’s eyebrows and cheeks.
Except that his head hurt, and his mouth tasted like dust, and there was wetness trickling down the side of his head.  Steve realized it wasn’t an asthma attack, but his brain wasn’t tracking, and he wasn’t sure what it was, or what had happened, how he’d ended up like this.  Nothing seemed to be making all that much sense.  He tried to sit up, but his body didn’t seem to want to respond, to move, and he had a feeling he’d just sort of twitched.  It still
, but there you had it.  Steve just seemed to do this to him, get him as worked up and breathless as a teenager with a few gruff words or a side-long look.  “I—have had a great deal of practice,” he said, and gave Steve a glance up through his lashes.  “I assume you’re referring to activities of a sexual nature,” he said, letting his own voice go husky and deep and soft.  “Though, I mean, I have had a great deal of practice at other things.  Ping-pong, trigonometry, appearing in the tabloids, giving Nick Fury heartburn . . . .”
A warm, aching wave of fondness rose up inside Steve, tender and tight in his chest, and he felt himself smile fondly, crookedly.  “There you are, sweetheart,” he murmured, just to himself, and moved forward to snag the fleece blanket folded up on the back of the sofa and shake it out to tuck it in around Tony.  It was just like him not to reach for it, really, whether out of forgetfulness or absorption in a project or exhausted absent-mindedness or whatever other reason.
Steve went bright red all over—he could see the flush on the tops of his bare feet, even—and his hand tightened around the top of his cock, the big blunt dark red head of it.  He was already dripping, of course—he always got so wet, wet and leaky, and his hand was already slippery wet just from touching himself.  His mouth went loose around Tony, and he gagged just a little, his saliva gurgling up wet around Tony’s cock.  Tony reached down, caught Steve’s jaw in his hand, stroked it gently, eased his mouth back just a bit, Steve’s saliva slipping down over his thumb, his hand, as he dragged in a deep breath.  Tony slid his thumb up, let it just slide into Steve’s mouth where it was open and wet, just over his lips, alongside his own dick, slipping over Steve’s tongue.  Steve moaned, his eyes going even more dilated, and sucked wetly, messily, at his cock, at his thumb.  Tony groaned himself, as Steve’s throat worked and his mouth sent shockwaves of pleasure up his cock.  He rubbed his thumb along Steve’s tongue, feeling the thick slide of saliva under it, the heat of Steve’s tongue, his swollen lips, cupped his chin and lifted his hips just enough to push deeper into Steve’s mouth, then pulled back.  Steve’s eyes fluttered shut and he moaned again, sucking harder.
“Hey there, gorgeous,” Tony murmured, his eyes lighting up and his smile widening, tugging at one side of his mouth.  The sight of that uneven smile, as always, had the power to have Steve’s heart beating fast, tripping all over itself, as well as the lights of Christmas reflected in his eyes.  “How’d it go at work?”  He slid one hand up over the back of Steve’s arm, and Steve shuddered under his touch, leaned into him.  Tony smiled even wider, beaming and soft, and kept his hand moving upward, over the back of Steve’s neck, making him shiver again, and up into his hair.  Tony’s hand felt very warm, having been curled under the blanket for the last few minutes, and made warm little tingles spread out through Steve’s entire body.  “You’re still in one piece,” Tony said, rubbing his rough, callused fingertips in little circles against the back of Steve’s neck in a way that made it incredibly hard to focus on anything else, “that’s a good sign.”
“I know; I won’t forget,” Tony said, soft and sweet and warm.  His hand slid back up, rubbed gently at Steve’s shoulders.  “Thank you.  Thank you, big guy.”
.  You were so lovely.  I was just worried it’d been too much of a shock.  I want it, I wanted it, I love your mouth on me, sweetheart, honey, love it.”  He found himself sweating, hot, almost trembling.  He felt dizzy at the idea that Steve would want to suck him off that badly, enough that he would—would actually spend time thinking about it.
Steve’s big hands were warm on his thighs, his eyes on Tony’s dick.  He licked his lips, then said, hoarse, his voice husky and low enough to rumble in his chest, that low deep rumble that went straight to Tony’s cock, “You must have had a lot of practice, huh?”
But before Tony could even catch his breath, Steve was already moving, thick hot cock dragging along sensitive inner walls before it pulled out of him.  Tony was self-consciously extremely aware of the drip, drip of come out his loosened hole, trickling down his balls, but then Steve’s mouth was there, warm and hot over his thigh, a hot tongue chasing it back up, laving wet over his balls, then dragging over Tony’s sensitive, stinging, open hole.  He licked around it, once, twice, then closed his mouth and sucked his own come right out of Tony’s sensitive, loosened hole.  Tony gasped, felt himself prickle all over, hot and very, very aware of his softly throbbing insides, the hot tingling ache of his well-used hole as Steve sucked on it, licked into him, gently, assiduously, sucking and licking his own come right out of him.  “Steve,” he gasped.
“You’re awful flattering,” Steve said, with a quick smile, and bent his head to Tony’s cock again.  This time he slid his hand down to Tony’s balls, tugged on them gently then closed his hand over them, rolling them under his palm.  His fingers curled under them, stroked over Tony’s perineum, up against his balls, even as Steve tongued at Tony’s slit again, and Tony’s brain just—stuttered to a stop for a moment, pleasure sweeping over him.  Steve’s other hand was so warm on his hip, warm and broad and steadying, and something inside of Tony was unwinding, going loose and soft and easy, his control eroding until he couldn’t help the little jerky movements of his hips, the way they wanted to move.  Steve made a pleased noise and started rocking with the movements, rocking his head back, like he’d been doing it for years.  See, Tony thought, he’d known Steve would be good at this—he was so coordinated, so graceful, of course he was good at it—and then Steve sucked on him again, this time taking more of his cock into his mouth, and his thoughts went scattering away again.  He felt very, very warm, hot all over, and dizzy, his head light and fizzy and bright with pleasure.  Everything felt so good; everything felt amazing.  He found himself melting back into the pillows, lolling against them, legs spread, head sinking soft into the pillows as he slid down against Steve’s mouth, sinking even further into the bed.  Steve hummed a little, again, and his other hand slid warmly over Tony’s hip, his thigh. Tony shuddered deliciously, all over, moaned, lifted his hips for Steve’s mouth, and Steve slid his tongue down his cock obligingly.  God, he felt good.
Steve laughed.  “Of course there is,” he said.  “I know I’m good.  But having an inflated sense of my own abilities isn’t going to get me further with my skating, is it?”
“Thank you,” Steve said, feeling slow and stupid, barely catching up.  “I—I mean, thank you for all of this.  Tony, I—sweetheart—”
After what must have been a long while, of just lying there breathing through the soft moments, every one of them feeling soft and full, Tony on top of him, one of Tony’s hands linked around his and carefully tracing the pulse in his wrist in slow, lulling circles, the other linked with Steve’s fingers, both of them breathing lazily, Tony stirred slightly, pushed himself up over Steve, kissed his back again, the back of his neck, the round of his shoulder.  “You didn’t mind that I didn’t get you off from your cock at all?” he asked, one hand coming up to trace over Steve’s shoulder.
“No one could please me more,” Tony whispered, and he meant it, and the way that made him feel raw and naked and exposed was worth it for the way it lit Steve up until he was practically glowing.  His cheeks were red, his ears were even redder, and the flush went all the way down his neck, down his belly, when Tony glanced down at it, and he was beaming.
Steve nodded, eyes dark and cheeks flushed, and arranged himself in place, lying across Tony’s thighs, bracing himself on one arm.  His body felt very warm against Tony’s, radiating heat.  His eyes kept flicking down to Tony’s dick.  “Makes sense,” he muttered.  “Like this?”
He waited until Tony was breathing unsteadily, thighs trembling as he hitched his hips up and back almost anxiously, needily, his rear hot when Steve laid a hand down against it and rubbed there, gently, which made Tony give a breath that was nearly a sob, deep in his chest, shivering under his touch.  Steve rubbed, lightly, feeling how hot Tony was, light little touches over the sensitive skin, knowing it had to be hot, shivering with sensitivity and the intensity of feeling the soft silky tails of the flogger had created with repeated pressure.  Steve rubbed at his rear for a while, as Tony moaned, then went still, spreading his legs for Steve and shivering.  Steve stroked gently down, over the hot skin, between his legs, rubbing at the soft, smooth spot between his hole and his balls, cupping them gently and tugging them back, rubbing his fingers against the velvety-soft, carefully waxed skin, so smooth and warm as carefully denuded of hair as Tony kept them, then cupped his palm against them and rubbed his first two fingers gently against the base of Tony’s cock.
Steve pulled off just long enough to rasp, “That’s the general idea, yeah,” and then his mouth was back on Tony’s cock.  His hips pressed down into the bed again.
why Tony had bothered to get dressed up like this in the first place, however vulnerable and fluttery and tight with strange anxiety it made him feel in his stomach.  Because it made Steve look at him like
“Not bad, he says,” Tony scoffed, smiling at him, trying to keep it soft and light, show him how very attractive he did find Steve, in every way.  “You’re stunning, Steve.  Dazzling.  Magnificent.  My own prime cut of grade-A American beefcake, right here.”
“I know what you need,” Tony murmured against the back of his neck, soft and dark and knowing, and Steve shuddered all the way down to his toes, felt the muscles of his hips and back and behind flex as he gasped, the way his thighs worked as he bucked up.  His skin was burning and hot all over, little pinpricks of sensation.  He felt so hot.  He let his head fall back, hang back and rest on Tony’s shoulder, and he could feel the wet slide of his hair.  He needed to
“Gonna taste like me,” Tony said, and winked at him.  “My favorite flavor after yours.”  He slid his arms around Steve’s shoulders and kissed him, deep and sweet and long, tasting himself on Steve’s tongue.  When he finally pulled away, Steve was shivering, his eyes glassy and glazed, hazy with pleasure, and Tony skimmed his fingers gently over his lips, which made Steve shudder against him, breathing unsteadily.  “Tastes great,” Tony said, and Steve smiled.
“So good,” Tony murmured again, and his hand came up, brushed Steve’s hair back out of his face, his thumb running over Steve’s forehead, and then he was pressing another kiss there, and the warm awareness of it washed all the way down over Steve’s chest, down to his toes, and then Tony was pulling back, moving away, reaching up over him.  Steve sucked in a breath, feeling the skin of his tits prickle, his nipples, aching and hot, and then Tony was back, pressing his lips to each tit just above the nipple in a lingering kiss before he dropped the clamps, all cold metal and cool teasing chains, in a little silvery puddle on Steve’s belly.  “You ready for this, peaches?” Tony murmured.
“And why wouldn’t I be generous to my sweet guy?” Tony asked, a smile still in his voice as he stroked gently over Steve’s sore side.  Somehow he knew exactly how to do it so it felt good rather than hurt, so that it made tension and soreness drain out of Steve like lancing a wound, made him relax even further, so soft and loose and lax.  It felt so good.  “You’re my sweetheart, aren’t you, babe?”
Afterward, when Brock pulled out, he was still groaning and shivering, his cock sore but burning with need, even when Brock cruelly flicked the tip, his sensitive cockhead, and made him gasp and groan and almost sob.  He was so wet, he was leaking, and he knew Brock’s rough fingers came away smeared with it.
, pulling at his tit, a constant tug, biting and demanding even as he sucked in his breath and that made the muscle bounce, pulling in against the weight as he flexed instinctively and it rolled to the side.  The ball tips of the clamp abruptly felt even more cruel, harsh and deep, and Steve gave a harsh whining breath of effort.  He felt lopsided, suddenly, off balance, until Tony did the other side, and the harsh pain was the same both places, that heavy downward pull that made his nipples feel stretched and heavy.  Tony flicked them both, set them sliding over Steve’s hot red pecs, and Steve moaned, couldn’t help the way his muscles flexed, hands curling into fists behind him and shoulders pressing into the bed until they flared with tender soreness, arching his back, lifting his backside off the bed until he fell back with another moan.  His tits ached, and his nipples
Steve propped himself on one arm on the sofa.  “Did you know, Tony,” he said, “honey, baby, darling, honey bunny,” Tony was looking more and more delighted with each endearment, hugging the plate of cookies and bouncing on his toes, “sugar, darling, dollface, angel, my sweetheart, you are the absolutely most thoughtful, most adorable, most wonderful lover a man could ever have?”
He stayed there as the sun came up, even as his stomach growled and gnawed insistently.  He put his head down on his arms.  He took a breath.  He should eat, he thought distantly.  He felt so cold, so cold and so alone and so—so worthless.  He wasn’t any good, not for anyone, he wasn't . . . good, he was terrible, a terrible boyfriend, a terrible . . . fuck, a—he should have done more.  The inside of his mouth still felt gritty.  He was so cold.  He shivered.  Maybe he should take another shower, he thought, but he found himself just running his fingertips over the grain of the wood of his table.  There was a scored mark there, a flaw.  Was that his fault?  Had he put that there?  Jesus Christ, he couldn’t even take care of his own goddamn things, the things SHIELD had entrusted him with, one of the few damn things he had in this time.  Why couldn't he even take care of a goddamn table?  His fingers went around and around, over the mark.
It only lasted a moment, though, a split second, and then he was left bereft and moaning again, missing the touch, the friction, the pleasure and heat of it—but then Tony’s fingers skimmed back and touched his still-sensitive rim, callused fingers gentle and wet against his hole, and oh,
At least he’d learned how to operate a modern laundry machine already, and it didn’t take him long.  Steve made Brock his eggs and bacon, swiping idly at the oil that burned his bare chest, just under one nipple, then brushed his teeth and came back to take his place under the table and sucked Brock off once more before he stood up, pressed a kiss into his mouth.  Brock sighed, arched up into it, squeezed at Steve’s sore backside.  “Good little housewife,” he said, and Steve felt his lips stretch into a smile.
“What, you think I don’t mean it?” Tony teased.  “You think I don’t find you handsome?  You’re gorgeous, sweetheart.”
Tony gave him an incredibly—pained look, almost sad.  “Yeah, okay, whatever,” he muttered, dismissively, Steve thought, looking down and away, then reached out, slid one gauntlet around Steve’s shoulders.  The other reformed around his hand.  Steve stared at it.
Stark smiled a little, a little smirk that was hard to read.  “Steve Rogers,” he said.  “I know.” He pulled out his other earbud, draped them over his shoulder, and held out one gloved hand.  “Tony Stark.  But you already knew that, too.”
There was a firm, callused hand, a little dry and cold but still warmer than Steve’s skin, pressed to his cheek, along his jaw.  He sighed out a breath, found himself turning his head, pressing into it, without consciously telling himself to do it, as if he was watching himself, but without opening his eyes.  Tony’s thumb pressed against his cheekbone.  It felt good.  As much as he was feeling, focusing on, tracking on anything.
“Apple strudel?” Tony asked without moving his head.  “Pumpkin pie.  Vanilla mousse.  Gingerbread bunny.”  He skimmed his finger around Steve’s ear again, down his neck, walked his fingers down his chest over his belly.  “Eggnog cupcake.  Peppermint frosting.”
Tony’s anxious expression faded, melted into a softly lopsided, almost impossibly fond expression.  “As long as you liked it,” he said again, in a low voice, and leaned in, pressing himself warm and heavy over Steve’s side to press another soft kiss into Steve’s mouth, nipping lightly at his full, wet bottom lip until Steve gasped and clutched at him weakly, desperately, mouth open and wet for Tony.  “You did such a good job,” Tony murmured as he pulled away, pressing a kiss to Steve’s nose, to each of his eyebrows, to his cheekbones, as he pulled away, rubbing gently along Steve’s jaw with his thumb.  “You were . . . you were fantastic, handsome.  I couldn’t have asked for anything better.  Anything more.”  He smiled, a little rueful.  “You made me come so hard.  You were so gorgeous, so wonderful—just watching you, watching you react like that—it feels like a privilege, sugar, and that’s the truth.”
, that slick hard surface, cool against his hot insides but quickly growing warm from him, the pressure, the force of it, the way it skated along inside him—
“Oh, honey,” Tony murmured. His hands skimmed down over Steve’s shoulders, rubbed at the small of his back. “Of course.  Just hope you’re feeling better, that’s all.”
“Get your cock out, darling,” Tony said gently, as gently as he could with his breathing ragged and his voice hoarse with want.  “I want to see.  Can I see?  Will you show me your cock?  Show me how turned on you are?  Show me how hot you are just from my cock in your mouth?  Yeah, you want to, right?  Let me see it, slugger.”
“No?  Finding the A.I.M. base in the first place?  Taking out what, a third of their ground troops?  Figuring out what the experiment they were running even was?”
“Nah,” was all Tony said, and turned his head, brushed a soft, smearing kiss against the base of Steve’s neck. “It was good.  You pushed me just … just enough.”
Steve’s fingers trailed back over Tony’s thighs, rubbed at the curve of his ass where it met his thighs, and his grin was pure mischief.  “Oh, you know,” he said.  “Things.” He tugged lightly at the bottom of Tony’s garter belt, and it made him shiver.  “Finger you open.  Eat you out. I really want to get inside you sometime tonight.”  Gentle fingers sliding along his perineum, against his lacy panties.  “God, Tony, those feel amazing,” he murmured softly. “But, well.  You know.  I want you good and open.  Take my time with you.”
Being in chastity, having his cock locked up, constrained at Steve’s pleasure, not for his own, always seemed to make Tony more aware of any attention paid to his back door.  It wasn’t his favorite form of sex, receiving-wise, but he didn’t mind it, either, and with Steve, attention to his anus, to his prostate, had taken on a new kind of excitement for him—the massive, impossible pressure and thickness and fullness of Steve’s dick inside him, the patient way Steve would curl his fingers and rub at Tony’s prostate, smiling at him as Tony’s breath went uneven at the pleasure and his hips jerked back on Steve’s fingers, needy for the press and rub of them on that sensitive place inside.  But being in chastity made him, well, focus on that more, the idea of being penetrated, of having Steve down his throat, in his mouth, or deep inside him, pushing inside his ass, opening Tony wide for him, taking him deep, made him ache to be penetrated, needy to have that firm pressure on his prostate, feeling something inside, as if to make up for the lack of stimulation on his cock.  Like this he wanted Steve to take him, to fuck him, to make him feel warm and aching and full inside, burning with the stretch like from a good workout, give him that stimulation and pleasure even if Tony couldn’t come, to feel Steve come inside him, wet and full, and feel like he’d done a good job for him, that pleasure suffusing all through his body and almost better than feeling it himself.
Steve hadn’t expected Tony to like spanking when they’d first started this between them.  He’d observed, their first couple of times, that Tony was always gentle in bed, gentle and careful, so careful and attentive and mind-blowingly adept in bringing Steve nothing but incredible pleasure with what seemed like everything he did.  He seemed like all charisma and seduction at first, impossibly good at everything he did for and with Steve, but Steve had slowly begun to see under that, even that first night, and realize that Tony was an incredibly sweet lover, caring, attentive, truly invested in Steve’s, in his partner’s, pleasure, in every way, his gaze rapt and anxious on Steve’s face as he looked so carefully to see if Steve enjoyed every little thing Tony did with him.  He’d been so gentle and sweetly generous and open, all warm hands, sweet, willing mouth, loving caresses, that Steve had sort of assumed he wouldn’t be into anything harder, but of course, he’d been wrong about that. Even so, when they started to play around on the kinkier side of things, he figured Tony wouldn’t like spanking. It kind of hit on a lot of things Tony had issues with, or that Steve sort of suspected he did, and he thought maybe Tony would find it degrading, and not in a fun way, either.
“Feel so good,” Tony moaned, head lolling against the pillow, bound hands lying limply above him, twining his fingers softly, as if unconsciously, into the blankets. “Please.”
“Oh,” Tony breathed, blinked.  “Oh, I.” His cock throbbed between his legs as he realized what Steve was asking.  “Of—of course, sugar plum.  I’d be happy to.”
“You have such sensitive tits,” Tony murmured, “sometimes I feel like I’m taking the easy way out when I hurt them, but you react to it so beautifully I just can’t help wanting to give them some sugar, some lovin’.  You just—you just give it all up for me.  Just like that.”
,” Steve said, laughing, but he caught his face in his hands, and kissed him deep and slow, until Tony was arching back into the pillows and gasping, his eyes falling closed and Steve’s hands in his hair.
, until Steve was gasping, shaking against him, groaning and gasping with every tug and jerk and squeeze and pinch.  He dug his fingers into the areolas, into the muscle of Steve’s pecs, and squeezed, pinching until Steve
“I’d say you always please me, handsome,” Tony purred.  “I mean that.”  He did, too.  Steve was a—a gift, precious and incredible, awkward and strong and brave and noble and unutterably perfect.  He was a little clumsy in bed, at times, sure enough, more because of his own self-consciousness than anything, but he was also a quick learner, physically gifted, with enviable stamina, endurance, and a recovery time that would be the envy of any man.  He was also sweet, giving, with a soft shyness and a gentleness that had surprised Tony, when he was offered tenderness in return, respectful and so damn steady it took Tony’s breath away.  He slid his hands up to Steve’s neck, leaned up and pressed a kiss to his forehead.  “Whatever we do, I guarantee you I’ll enjoy it.”
Steve worked him up to three fingers, kneading his ass with his hands as he did it, spreading his cheeks wide, tugging on his hole, then sinking his fingers in deep, twisting them gently, fucking them in and out in a slow, hot, wet rhythm against Tony’s prostate, until Tony was panting, and there were desperate, pathetic smears of his precome all over Steve’s belly where his caged cock kept rubbing, dripping and damp.  Then Steve sank his three fingers deep, rubbing them along inside him, and got his other hand up, dragged Tony down into a kiss.
Steve could still feel the shock of horror when he realized they were trying to recreate the serum.  Again.  Make more of him.  He’d wondered if they’d been making them for HYDRA, he’d wondered, he’d—he swallowed, hard. “Some scrapping at the start,” he muttered.  “It’s hardly—”
“Hell,” Steve muttered, then swallowed.  He leaned in, pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder that made him tremble with a strange heat and more tingling sensation, then to his jaw.  “What if I want to please you?” he asked, gruffly, still not meeting Tony’s eyes.
Steve frowned at him and shook his head, leaned down and pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder, then his hip, then curled his hand warmly over Tony’s hip again and leaned in.  Tony watched him take a shuddering breath, felt it feather hot and damp over his groin, down over his cock, watched Steve swallow, and then lean in again.  He reached out, curled one hand around Tony’s cock.
“There you go,” Tony murmured.  “I’ve gotcha, big boy.”  Steve gasped, moaned, just at the words, the confirmation of what he’d been thinking, a needy little
“I don’t want you . . .” oh, ouch, that hurt, yeah, that was painful, how Tony was shifting him, oh yeah, and there was a strange pause, like Tony froze in mid movement before carefully resuming, “getting in any trouble for me,” Steve managed, as firmly as he could, and then Tony was lifting him up onto his feet and he couldn’t think about anything other than not crying out in pain as he hissed out his breath from between his teeth to try to stop himself, feeling cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.
Tony smiled to himself, a little.  Beautiful, he thought.  Beautiful was good, too.  Beautiful was so good.  “All for you, big boy,” he breathed, watching his own teeth white against his lipstick, the curl of his tongue.  He really did look—pretty, good enough to eat.
He did, Tony knew that. “All right,” he finally breathed, trying not to squirm, and spread his legs obligingly for Steve, feeling very aware of his hot, damp thighs, a little sticky from Steve rutting back and forth between them, and leaned forward, bracing both hands on the mirror again as he started to lick up Steve’s spend with his tongue.  He did have to be careful, like Steve had said, not to smudge it with his lipstick, and that meant sticking his tongue out, dragging it against the smooth cool surface mirror, getting it all wet with his spit, laving his tongue against it.  He felt intensely, vividly aware of the way Steve was touching him, pushing up his skirt, caressing his thighs, up over his fabric-covered ass, rubbing gently, before he gently unfastened the garter straps, three of them on each leg, rubbing at Tony’s skin under it every time, then stroked the front and back of his thighs, pushed the garter belt up, bunching it and the skirt up around his waist. Tony groaned, moaned, squirming as his cock was released from the tight pressure of the garter belt and sank down to bob more naturally between his legs, just constrained by the soft pressure of the fine lace panties, which had plenty of stretch.   He badly wanted to get a hand down to touch himself, squeeze and tug and press at himself through the panties, rocked desperately on his knees, but made himself keep both hands on the mirror as he kept licking at it, feeling something inside his belly go soft and liquid as he did.
beautiful, Steve thought, painfully.  He was so beautiful.  He was the most beautiful person Steve had ever seen.  Of course Brock would take Tony over him.  Anyone would.  Steve would never have had a chance with him.  Even if Tony hadn’t already had a gal.  He knew that.  “You shouldn’t talk about him like that,” he said, swallowing.  “He’s not—”
Steve nodded, or tried to.  His head hurt.  He swallowed, took a breath.  “S’—” no, that was too much trouble to say.  “Yeah,” he finished.  He’d had to set it, before he could try and walk on it, gritting his teeth and bracing himself against a nearby tree trunk.
He tugged Steve down beside him, like that.  “Good job,” he muttered, and Steve felt warm, because he’d said he was
“I have a great deal of practice saying every ridiculous thing I can think of, darling,” Tony said, grinning at him.
Tony nodded, groaning, rubbed one hand over his mouth, smearing his lipstick across the back of it, but God, God, it was true; he’d never opened up like this, let anyone take him like this, as willing, as
Steve dragged in a deep breath, kissed Tony’s forehead.  “Turn around,” he said, low and hoarse.  “I want your hands on the mirror.  I’d like to, to rub off between your pretty thighs.  Would that—would that be all right with you?”
It was one of Brock’s favorite things, to have Steve on his knees in his bed, face down and rear end up, naked, as he idly toyed with his own belt and just watched him.  This time he made Steve spread his cheeks apart, tease at his own hole with a dry finger, and Steve just—just sucked in his breath and
“God, you needy slut,” Brock said, and Steve went hot all over, felt his ears flaming, his breath coming unsteadily, but couldn’t help how he ground back on his fingers, “you absolute whore for it; who knew Captain America would be such a needy piece of ass, Jesus.”  And he slapped Steve’s rear end, once, hard, but not enough that it did more than sting, not with Steve being who he was, and pulled his slick fingers away, out of him.  Steve couldn’t keep back the mournful sound he made.
He kept at it until Steve was whining, trembling with sensitivity under him, panting, “Tony, Tony,” in soft rough deep gasps, and he let him slip out of his mouth, dragging over the lower lip, painting it red with a squeeze of both lips, then let it flop down between them.  Steve was staring down at him, eyes glazed, lips bitten and puffy and shiny with spit, looking hot and swollen, cheeks deeply flushed, hands still tangled up in Tony’s hair.  His flush went down, over his heaving chest, down all the way, over his thighs, and he moaned as his cock slid out of Tony’s lips, as if the sight was just too much.
“Thank you, fella,” Steve said, and let his own voice go soft, even as it wanted to slur out into a mumbled mess.  That earned him another soft smile from Tony that made him go warm all through, and that was worth anything.  “Y’take real good care of me, y’know?”  It seemed suddenly important that Tony hear that.  “I appreciate it, ‘ve always appreciated it. So much.”  His throat was dry, but at least he’d managed to get that out.
Steve felt himself go bright red, red into his ears and down his neck.  He knew Tony was just teasing, but he had to look down, bite his bottom lip, because of that damn blush, and what it gave away.  Like how much he really would have liked Tony in his bed.  He wished.  In his dreams.  He swallowed hard.
“See?” Steve murmured.  “And I don’t want you to be a better boyfriend than I am.  I want you to have a good boyfriend.  The best.  Because the best is what you deserve.”
Steve moaned, opened his mouth wider and took Tony deeper into his mouth, made out with his cockhead a little more, let it fill up his mouth, his frankly unfairly long lashes fluttering over his eyes, his face very flushed and his mouth wet and swollen as he let Tony fill up his mouth.
—pushed inside him, almost easily just with his own precome to slick him up, God, two at once, and Steve was glad of that, he was already a little relaxed from before, and he could take it, he liked it, the sudden pressure and fullness, a little hot and dry and raw, a little bit of stretch, was enough to make him jolt, but also settled inside him like a comfort, heady and hot, the feel of Tony’s callused fingers firm inside him, filling him, the pure pleasure just in that, feeling the pressure, feeling Tony’s clever fingers crook into him, filling him like that, pressing into him inside.
Tony ground his heel down lightly, tapped his toe against Steve’s base once, twice, and he shivered all over at the sudden shock of adrenaline, of fear, of pain that quickly transmuted to pleasure and lit up every nerve in his body until he was prickling and hot all over, alive with vivid sensation just from those little taps.  Tony pressed down again, and Steve gave a strangled noise of pleasure, feeling hot blood flushing to the very tip of his cock, hot with painful pressure as it throbbed under the sole of Tony's foot.  Tears of overwhelming sensation formed in his eyes, and one slipped free, slid down his cheek, leaving a trail that felt shockingly cold against his hot skin.  “Good boy,” Tony breathed.  “You take it so well, baby, so, so well.”  Steve went hot and liquid at the praise, felt something untwist inside of him, because Tony had said he took it well, he thought he took it well.  His thumb circled against Steve’s cheek, brushing away that tear, rubbed gently against his eye, brushing tears away.  Steve knew he’d be holding onto Tony if his hands weren’t bound, would be clinging to his strong forearms or clutching to his hips, curling his fingers clumsily in his belt loops or his waistcoat or his shirt.  As it was, all he could do was sway forward, press his face to his waistcoat, feel the fine weave of it against his hot face.
“You know the answer to that,” Tony said.  “But don’t make me say it out loud.  It feels disloyal to say it out loud.”
His toes, his ears, the little whimpery noise he made when Tony rubbed at his prostate and he bit his lip despite himself—those were all things that hadn’t changed about him at all since the serum (he remembered stroking himself off, fingers deep inside himself and one hand around his cock, and hearing himself make that same noise as he bit himself against it, and throbbed with humiliated need and the desperate hope that no one had heard).  He didn’t often think about that sort of thing in bed, but the thought just came to him and lingered for a while, because maybe that meant Tony would have enjoyed Steve in his other body, too, just like this, and that thought made something throb so beautifully and so painfully in his chest that his breath caught and his eyes stung and he almost fell forward onto his crossed arms to bury his face in them, just barely managing to keep himself up.  And Tony just praised him; “Good boy,” he said, “good boy, good boy, Steve, so good for me, so, so good for me, cupcake.”
“Good to see you, Shellhead,” Steve managed to murmur, and Tony laughed, and took him up in his arms.
on it, and Steve’s entire world exploded in a bright, breathless flare of hot, consuming sensation, not pain, not pleasure, somehow both at once and neither.  When he came back to himself, he was rolling his face on Tony’s shoulder, mouth open and wet, and groaning, shaking all over, wet with sweat, his nipple throbbing so painfully, so beautifully.
Somehow that triggered the thought that there was something he needed to be doing, a sense of urgency, and Steve tried to lift his head again, instinctively pushing down against the heavy weight covering him, tried to roll to one side.  The pain shot through him again, bright and overwhelming and
, and he pressed his fists to his forehead and gasped, and then Rumlow was sliding deeper into him, and it felt so good, felt like he’d been empty and waiting for just this and never realized, a big cock deep inside him, and then Rumlow had started to thrust, had pulled at Steve’s hair, had dragged at his shirt, and it had felt so, so good, so good that Steve had gone away in his head again, something going soft inside him, inside his core, so that it barely seemed to matter that he was getting hard again, that his cock was thickening up between his legs, against his pelvis.
“Right here, sweetheart.”  Tony sounded breathless, almost as hazy.  He pressed a kiss to Steve’s shoulder, and he felt it go all the way through him again, a warm wash of sensation that swept over him down to his toes.  He petted lightly at Steve’s side, just above his hip, fingers rubbing into his skin again and again, uncoordinated and soft.  Steve sighed and let his eyes slide closed.
Brock pulled his fingers out of Steve and slapped him hard, over his loosened, wet, slickened up hole, and laughed and called it his sloppy cunt, spanking him hard, and Steve welcomed it, welcomed him making him raw and hot and painful and tender, even as he shoved in, hard and thick and long, because it pulled his thoughts back to the present, to
Steve stumbled over to his table, pulled out his chair, and slumped into it, even though it sent a jolt of pain up from his still tender rear.  He sank his head into his hands.
Tony grinned.  “It’s naturally curly, you know,” he said, feeling unduly pleased at that, even though usually his wavy hair annoyed the hell out of him.
“’S okay, Tony,” Steve managed, because he didn’t want Tony to be upset over it.  “There’s not much they can do.  I’ll just burn through any painkiller they’ve got, probably.”
There was initial resistance (there always was, pretty much), and Steve had to push a bit at first, making Tony gasp, his eyes water slightly, at the pressure, the pure
“Shhh,” Tony murmured.  “I’ll save the lollipop between your legs for later, hmm?  A special treat just for me.  Biggest one in the whole damn candy store, am I right, peaches?”  Another sucking, biting kiss against Steve’s neck, and Tony’s fingers left him, letting Steve shiver and shake through the aftermath of overwhelmed pleasure, even as Tony’s fingers rubbed over the curve of his pectoral, the others at the back of his neck, over his shoulders.  “I’d say you’re the vanilla to my chocolate,” he murmured in Steve’s ear, fond amusement in his voice, “but we both know you’re not vanilla at all, are you, champ?”  His fingers tugged at Steve’s nipple with each word.  “Not,” tug, “one,” tug, “little,” tug, “bit.”  And his fingers bit inward on a harsh, cruel pinch that had Steve letting out a wild cry of pure pained pleasure.
Oh.  Was that why that side hurt so much?  Steve shifted his eyes over to look, trying not to move his head too much, but the slight movement still made him want to hurl.  And yeah, well, his arm was definitely twisted under him at an unnatural angle.  Clearly Tony hadn’t had to use his genius brain to diagnose that one.
“No, it was so good,” Tony said, all in one breath, practically, looking up at Steve’s face, his forehead creasing earnestly.  He was already reaching for Steve, wrapping an arm around his side, sliding the other up over his chest, rocking forward into him until Steve could feel the humid warmth of Tony’s cock and groin pressed up against his thigh.  “So, so good, sugar plum.  So good.”
Steve nodded, mouth still on his cock, and his lashes fluttered.  He gripped his cock, groaned, pushing his hips up into his hand, and damn but that was hot, the sight of it so obscenely, ridiculously hot Tony’s brain almost went offline just at that.  Steve Rogers, Captain America, blatantly getting off on sucking Tony’s cock, lips wrapped around him, even as his t-shirt clung to his abs and shoulders and he pushed his giant cock into his own hand through his pants.  The other was clinging warm and steadying to Tony’s asscheek, still, Steve’s fingers pressed almost painfully tight into the curved muscle of it, and that in itself was hot enough to make Tony’s cock throb all on its own, the fact that Steve was holding Tony to his mouth so tightly, so desperately.  Like Tony would have pulled away voluntarily from that hot, wet, softly open, giving mouth, God.
“Tony,” he heard himself moan.  He rocked in his hips despite himself and his cock swayed between them, up and down, came up and hit his belly with a wet noise that made him flush.  It
He forced his eyes open against the pain, feeling like he was squinting into the sun.  His eyes were watering, and they felt like they didn’t want to open.  Sure enough, opening them made his head throb even worse, a hot wet heavy feeling of tears build up in his eyes, and he couldn’t see anything but a blur anyway.  A light, sort of white blur, which supported the idea that he was in a hospital, anyway. He could feel needles connected to lines in his hand, anyway, the tape sticking them down to his skin.  He blinked, blinked again, dragged in a deep, heavy breath that was at least easier than it had been, in his blurred memories of whatever had happened before this.  He remembered struggling to breathe, wondering if he was having an asthma attack.  His breath rasped a little in his chest and his throat, which felt a little sore, but it was coming easier now, less heavy.  Steve figured that was good.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve murmured.  He rubbed a finger over Tony’s newly waxed hole, sensitive and tingling at the touch, through the lace of his panties.  “Gosh, these are so pretty,” he said.  “They make you look so pretty.  So perfect against your skin.”
“Like—like what, honey?” Tony asked, and it came out on a groan.  God, Steve’s mouth was all red with Tony’s lipstick now.
“That’s my good, clean fella,” Steve said, still fondling the metal encased underside of Tony’s shaft gently, through the silk.
Brock made him come on it, then sighed, tugged it out of him, thumbed him open, pulling him wide on his thumb, spit inside of him again and rubbed it in, then slid into him, his cock still half soft, but Steve was loose enough now to take it in anyway, hold it inside him—oh God, his thumb was still there, inside him, holding him open, too, oh, God—and fucked him slowly, a long time, until he got hard, spilled, and came.
“Yes,” Steve slurred, “Yessir, yes, sir, ready.”  He flexed his shoulder muscles, arched his back, pushing his chest up into Tony’s hands, trying to show him how ready he was, even as it scratched his sore shoulders along the bedspread.  Tony slapped his tits again, pressing his hand into each one and squeezing as hot prickling sensation, both pain and pleasure at once, swept through Steve from the smacks, one on each side.  Steve was panting, his chest heaving, even before Tony rubbed his palms over his nipples and reached down for the clamps.
“Aww, sweetie, I try,” Tony murmured, feeling a warm flush of pleasure up into his face himself at that.
Tony made a soft, pleased sort of groan, and turned his face in toward in the inside of Steve’s thigh, his mouth dragging wet and open along the fabric as he did.
Steve kicked his bike into park and sighed, slipping the keys into his pocket.  He was already hard, unbearably, desperately hard, and he was painfully aware of it as he jogged up the stairs to Brock’s apartment, aware of the sweat of anticipation beading on his hairline, down his spine.  He never used the elevator—it was embarrassing to think that he might expose someone to the state of him, if they noticed his needy erection, and someone might actually need it, and it was more exercise, and, well, he usually felt like he needed the physical exertion to get the anxious sparking bugs out from under his skin, and besides that, he didn’t really know that he wanted anyone to see him there.  He didn’t really know if Brock wanted that either.
“At the Grand Prix Final?” Tony’s eyes went a little wide.  “Jesus,” he said under his breath.  “And then I beat you out of your well-deserved, got-it-on-lock, straight shot to your National title.  And then I beat you again at Worlds.  And golden boy Mr. Rogers, what, doesn’t hold a grudge?”  He laughed, and it sounded bitter.  “You have more reason to hate me than anyone.”
“Bunny.  My cuddle bunny,” Tony said, patting Steve’s belly.  “I’m not the only one with a nice tight pair of
Tony was very warm under his arm when Steve draped it around his shoulders and nuzzled into his hair on the way to the kitchen, leaning happily against him, snuggled into him even if it might have been easier to walk if they were more separated, like he never wanted to let Steve go.  Steve didn’t make it any easier for him in the kitchen, either, wrapping his arms around him from behind and setting his chin on his shoulder as Tony got them big mugs of hot cocoa and homemade marshmallows and dollops of Jarvis’s malted milk whipped cream.  Tony set the cookies down on the table and the two cups of cocoa beside it with a kind of triumph, pulling back a chair, but Steve didn’t let go of him, just sat down in the chair and pulled Tony into his lap as he went.  Tony yelped, but didn’t struggle, let Steve pull him in, big and tall as he was.
Tony had been on him lately for being reckless.  Steve personally didn’t think he was being that bad—he was just doing what he could do.  The team had plenty of heavy hitters on it right now, way heavier than him—Thor, She-Hulk, Tony himself—and Steve wasn’t team lead anyway, so he wasn’t needed back to coordinate things, and being point just made sense.  Tony called it “throwing himself into danger,” but honestly, he was one to talk.  Steve could check things out and their hardest hitters didn’t get tied up with anything minor, that way.  After everything, Steve thought it was the least he could do.  And he could take a lot of hits before they laid him out. Sure, he wasn’t the toughest on the team, not by a long shot, but he could stand up to a lot.  That was something he could do.
,” Steve managed, trying a smile that felt crooked and lopsided on his lips just to try and soften it a little, lighten it and make it feel less serious, less
After a moment Steve raised his head, cleared his throat, coughed a little into his hand.  “I didn’t finish you off, though,” he said.
Steve was very patient this time, gently massaging at Tony’s inner tissues, stretching him gently, making sure he was slick inside and out before adding another finger and crooking them inside, rubbing gently.  He found his prostate, then, and started to rub there, again and again, massaging the spot into waves of hot, breathless pleasure that stabbed hot into Tony’s gut, went straight to his cock, and made Tony knock forward and smudge his lipstick against the mirror more than a few times, before he licked it up, his cock throbbing hot and hard, feeling heavy between his legs.  Steve got one, two, three fingers into him, pumping them in and out, twisting, stroking, working them against Tony’s prostate until he was gasping against the urge to twist back onto them, panting until the mirror steamed up with his breath between each lick.  Steve’s attention to his prostate was so constant, so assiduous, that Tony started to feel like it was aching under the gentle, constant pleasure, throbbing with it, swollen and sensitive and wanting, that throbbing pleasurable itch that it seemed like only Steve’s firm, caressing, slick fingers could scratch with each deep, soft rub into him.
“Huh?” Steve managed.  He blinked up at Tony, who just smiled again and tapped his chest, right over Steve’s shield on his shirt.
“Don’t push it, Rogers,” Tony said.  “Your—your kisses are better.  Okay?  But only by . . . twenty percentage points.”
“There’s no pressure, my dear,” Tony murmured.  “I’ll like it however you do it, I promise.  I’m easy.”
Steve’s cock felt very hot, hot and needy, throbbing between his legs, against his hip.  He groaned, swiveled his hips helplessly.  He had no idea.
this time (he’d almost done it)—that he didn’t see anything until he’d taken his bow and started off the ice after helping pick up a good handful of flowers and stuffed animals. The last thing he’d expected was to see Stark—Tony—leaning on the edge of the rink near where Steve stepped off, obviously watching.  He pushed himself off and came over as soon as Steve was off the ice, even before his coach got to him.
Tony whined at him, shaking his head, had a feeling his other hand was clawing pretty unnecessarily at Steve’s thigh, dragging his short nails down it, but Steve didn’t seem to mind, just nuzzled in against his throat, his jaw, kissing him gently.
“Yeah,” Steve managed.  His head felt hot and heavy, dreamy and soft and slow.  It was all he could think of to say.  He spread his legs a little more, pressed his chest up, offering himself in every way he could think of, let his head fall back to expose his throat, his lips part.  “All yours.”
