“Tony, I’m going to kiss you twice and then I’m sending you back to Sam to talk. You’re the one who wants the Avengers on speaking terms, when the aliens invade again, so you’re going to have to make some effort. The Avengers are more than just me.” Steve said as he opened the door only to find the last person he expected to see their.
Nomad: No you’re not.
"And Steve may deserve it. But it did show me how much he cares about you. So I'm not going to try to convince you to leave him because it would hurt him too much." Tony smiled at his words.
The Mechanic: I thought about it once I realized that he was 15. But there was the urgency of Germany and maybe at that point, I did not completely realize that this was not the time to bring a teenager in at all.
A few things from Spider-Man: Homecoming, but the real fun in this chapter is seeing why things are different in this timeline.
Venom: You really do see everything.
“I’m glad the principal let you see Kamala,” Tony said as Steve slid back into the passenger seat of the car. Tony opted not to go in because even though he’s been more of a recluse for the last five years, he could still cause a bit of a scene at a gifted kid school. Even if Brooklyn Academy was less science-focused than Midtown. Kamala has been trying to get him to be a guest speaker since freshman year, but he keeps turning her down. Maybe he should reconsider that.
Anthony: Okay I’m back and ready to get through the next hour plus of the ceremony.
Steve: Not many people would
BITC: Or, at a minimum, vibrate the thing. She’s really powerful.
“Which means she gets Fitz back, and Clint gets his children back.” She doesn’t mention herself. Were her and Clint also on a break when the snap happened? Was he even in the country? For all she knows he could’ve been on the run and that’s why he obviously feels so guilty.
Me: Now you’re going to make me cry and I was having such a happy day celebrating Ross’s resignation.
Even though my mom died young, I feel like we had a good relationship. I could tell her anything, well, almost anything. She didn’t know about Artie but she was so sick at the time that I didn’t want her to worry. Sometimes, I wonder how our relationship would be if she lived in this time. Would she be OK with me having a boyfriend? Especially a billionaire boyfriend? I don’t know. I hope she would be happy that I found someone I love and who loves me but I’m not sure. She was a very devout Catholic.
SimmonsJA: I know you’re upset that the current medical situation will prevent you and your partner from crossing the event horizon, but maybe it’s for the best. Once you cross that line, you can’t go back. Your relationship with him is already precarious.
Me: Yes.
Counselor Laura: His son ordered the nuke that you flew into a portal. Hydra has been the family brand since before the great depression. Per Leo, Wilford Malick handed one of the ingredients for the supersoldier cocktail to Hydra himself in 1931.
Me: I slept a lot and maybe answered a few emails. Even though Mary set up a few meetings for me while I’m here, I prefer not to have to look at my work email again until Monday at the earliest.
Purple Arrow: And she can’t? I thought she started talking last time?
Subject: What the hell happened with my nephew?
“Of course it did. By the way, Hunter keeps texting you,” Simmons said giving him back his personal phone. “There must be 100 or so in there. You should probably message him back.”
Me: That’s not surprising. James mentioned that the Princess was in America a lot. And apparently the super human, inhuman, enhance human liaison division has already recruited the Princess.
Blue phone: I’m not answering that question.
Nomad: Still not doing text message sex.
Me: Good calls since the creator of the Tony Stark gay sex tape was involved. Pepper is the best romantic relationship I’ve ever had and that still ended in tears, mostly mine.
Ana Jr.: That seems reasonable.
Me: That is not good.
CoulsonPJ: Don't make Stefan sad.
Counselor Laura: A lot. I figured it out when you referred to Steve as an asshole. You still call him an asshole on a regular basis, but usually as “my asshole.” Honestly, I think it's one of your litany of pet names.
Spoiler warning: This conversation covers the events of the climax of Spider-Man: Homecoming. If you happen to have a copy for home viewing, you may want to watch. I purposely lined things up so this chapter would not come out until after the movie was available for home viewing in the US at least. Also I wanted to look at one scene one more time.
Maybe you're angry because you had this idea of Tony and Pepper living happily ever after with 1.7 children somewhere in upstate New York. Now it’s me and Tony. Although there are a lot more children than originally planned, mostly with superpowers.
Blue phone: Why are you not going back to Avenger HQ?
Red phone: Yes. I'm thinking red, white, and blue for the color and the Wizard of Oz for movie.
Red phone: But the world needs you here. I need you here. I don’t think I can do this without you.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You’re all fabulous. We are now in the “bad” timeline. Although, there’s a surprise at the end.
"I prefer that you don't." That made Steve blush again. It was adorable.
TMNS: It helps that you're not a dick anymore, and it was MJ or rather the book she got me. She’s been buying me a lot of books about that stuff lately. It’s been helping me figure things out a little.
Anthony: He is so not worth a murder charge.
“How many parts are there?” Steve whispered.
Purple Arrow: Who is Robin?
Me: That’s understandable.
Counselor Laura: Congratulations, your avoidance is just as apparent as Dr. Tony Stark Rogers.
Me: This is true. I kind of don’t want the public to know what happened in Siberia, so the less they know the better.
Me: So if Rhodey survives the UN vetting process, things will be a little bit better. We might be able to meet up in person to hug it out. Laura wants that.
Agent Johnson: We found Odin. We are on some cliffs off the coast of Norway. I’m going into cloaking mode. I don't want to interrupt the father-son moment.
Me: Because that vigilante Quake intervened. I’m aware of how dangerous it is. It was all over the news. If you ever have kids, you’ll realize that you’re more worried about your child then yourself.
I almost killed your best friend because he killed my mom. That reaction was pure anger. I know that he was brainwashed and crazy when he did it and I should focus my anger on the last vestiges of hydra but it’s taken a lot of drugs to get to a place of acceptance. I’m trying though, for you and for me. I am even convinced that if your unnamed, female, super genius is able to undo the brainwashing crazy part of his programming that you will not leave me for him. I accept that it is a platonic relationship and sometimes a friendship is just a friendship. But it’s a deep one and I get that. Again therapy works. I’m working towards a better me.
5. You’re forgiving and willing to give almost anybody a second chance, including me. That is just shocking considering how many times you’ve been stabbed in the back by people that you trusted, like Obadiah. Yet, you let your heart stay open because you let me back in after what happened. I am still shocked about that. But I’m glad you let me back in after the mistakes I made. I think that’s what I love the most about you.
Cuddle bunny: I’m not sure if I believe you.
Counselor Laura: I consider that excellent progress.
“I think we’re going to have to have this conversation a lot because we have a lot to work through.” Wasn’t that the fucking truth.
Counselor Laura: It’s okay. I’ve been married to a spy for a long time. I’ve done this before. The reason why I’m contacting you is because the emergency criteria has been met.
Anthony: Wait, let’s back up a little bit. Pepper threatened to kill you? Pepper Pot threatened to kill you? See, I should read your messages before I go on a text messaging rent.
FRIDAY: I can confirm his affections for you.
“At a minimum, I can trust Rhodey to look out for the interests of everybody. I think he would do a good job. He’s talked me down from doing a lot of stupid shit over the years.”
“I am,” Leo replied, not making eye contact. “I’ve been since the uprising, when I killed my first Hydra agent. But thanks to Robin’s drawings, I know that we need Robbie for what’s to come. I knew I would lose him if I pulled the trigger. We can’t win without the Rider.”
Me: I have to stop doing that. How much damage?
HSBF: Yes. Also, this means I can talk a little more freely about some of the things I’ve been doing recently.
Agent M: Shield’s 616 died getting the information about the scepter’s location.
I’ve been wanting to do Coulson Stark snarky banner for a while in this story. I had too much fun doing this conversation.
“Okay. How about this, you put the notepad down for the night and I will help push every single thought out of your head until morning,” Tony suggested.
Me: That’s one way to explain it.
Anthony: It’s not end of the world catastrophic. Maybe just people discussing the end of my world because they feel like they can. Actually you should be able to stream that channel from anywhere on your new Stark burn phone. No Geo blocks for you. It's one of the side effects of making the device unsusceptible to GPS tracking.
with monkey lover and the trying-not-to-be-evil doctor. You know, to celebrate his pardon. I got a box.
Me: You know you don’t have to text me the moment you touch down. I can wait a few hours. I know you have a busy life.
HSBF: No you’re not. Aren’t you pretty much taking care of the Purple Arrow children while their parents work things out?
Blue phone: Did you do the Captain America fighting among the cherry blossoms that used to hang in my bedroom at the tower? I actually like that painting.
Me: What has May been telling you?
MayMQ: If you fought harder to stay the director, this would not be happening right now.
Agent M: New HQ
“Thermal dynamics or maybe just thermal. I’ll probably be too out of it to say both words.”
Me: So you know what you have to do?
Tony: I feel there is a but coming.
“Take a moment.” Laura hears Steve whisper. “She is still grieving.”
The new consultant: You watch way too much Star Wars. Which is why I don't trust what you just said at all right now.
Tony: So, feel free to not respond to this text message if you’re still making quality time with the wayward husband, but I feel like I should check in considering everything that’s happened in the last week.
Nomad: Maybe you can donate the ring to charity. Knowing your spending habits, it’s probably worth a lot.
“That had to be scary.”
Me: I’ll give him the suit back if you give me access to it.
“Probably,” Steve laughed.
“Oh. He agreed to take Robbie. That’s one less thing to worry about.” She was hoping he wouldn’t bring up what else was said. Maybe Phil will just focus on the job for the moment.
Me: Glad to always give you another reason. I’ll talk to you in a few days. Okay, Mary’s taking the phone now. Bye, got to go. Love you
Pepper pot: I still feel like you need someone to talk to. How are you handling things?
Captain Tight Pants: Is there a difference?
Me: I sparred with Melinda a couple of times.
Me: Yes, because I only left the room 15 minutes ago and it is a little bit of a walk to James' house. Hey, are you still having breakfast with Peter and Afia?
Cuddle Bunny: You really really hate him, don’t you?
Tony: Or bored teenagers in the basement are hacking on to this feed. I think she may have eloped with the android formally known as Jarvis. He’d left after the last mission.
“I’m not 100% sure if we ever were, not really. Tony never forgave me for losing to Thanos. Losing Peter destroyed a part of him.” Considering her Tony saw Peter as his son, this was bad. “My stubbornness was why we were fighting and why the Avengers were in pieces when we really needed to be together. We lost everything because we stopped being a team. Now it feels like the only thing we have in common is our children. It is the only thing we really can talk about.”
Morgan’s dad: So, you would tell me if something went wrong? I know you hate to ask people for help because you think you can do it all on your own, but sometimes it's necessary.
Melinda: Phil is gone, and even if what we're planning to do works, he's not coming back.
Nomad: So basically, you need a date to keep you away from her at all times?
MayMQ: How convenient.
Me: Yes, and I think dad owns most of them. There is a giant collection of the stuff at the property on Long Island. You have to understand that pretty much the only normal kid toys I got to play with were Captain America memorabilia. Even though, Jarvis and Anna tried their best, I was treated like a little adult too often. Aunt Peggy actually got that for me and now I feel dirty.
“Yes, Coulson killed him.” Steve answered.
Genius Princess: Where is your dad? I'm trying to alert him that I am en route to the Lighthouse now, but he has yet to respond.
Tosha: Not these cookies. He brought the Heath bar version too. You can’t avoid Laura forever, you're the one who brought her here.
Agent M: Yes. She's fine. She set up a dance studio in Georgia.
Me: I would have the same problem.
“You are so devious,” Tony said as he grabbed a plate from the shelf to put her omelet on.
“I don’t think that’s possible.” Because Siberia was an absolute cluster fuck. He's willing to acknowledge mistakes were made on all sides seven years after the fact, especially in light of what Ross did after the snap.
“On the bright side, Evans took on a bunch of homophobic assholes for us. He also said he would be totally up to playing my boyfriend in the Avenger anthology. That’s a weird thing to say, considering he’s already cast to play you... Fuck, he knows. Dammit." Tony said as everything clicked.
HSBF: Well how did you write your first text message to me? If you could send that first message after how badly we messed up, then I think you can write to Pepper.
HSBF: Were you and Pepper able to have lunch yesterday? Or is it already Friday where you are? It’s the 16
There are not really specific plot point spoilers for any of the shows in this chapter. However, TFtWS and WandaVision made me think about how things should be approached regarding Simmons’s mental health, operation keep away, and project restoration.
Iron Dad: Second, I would never go on a mission for the sole purpose of making out with my fiancé in a broom closet.
Hunter: I need a drink.
Genius Princess: Yes, I think it's time for us to prepare for the endgame.
“Will do,” both agents said before leaving.
Counselor Laura: So you’re aware of what’s going on?
The new consultant: That she's not on Asgard but another planet. Ana won't even let me have access to her last suit cam video. Stark himself blocked it, and the Princess won't override it.
The Mechanic: Like that’s going to be that hard. Ross got through one. As well as his predecessor and that guy was Hydra. And Malik. Rice will be easily confirmed and you will be as well.
Red phone: Mostly because I'm avoiding Pepper. At least there I don’t have to see her. I’m not looking forward to the next board meeting.
When the young Sparrow arrived three days ago her drawings collaborated Leopold story about the earth being destroyed. However, 22 hours ago her drawings changed. Instead of the world being cracked in half, a giant purple raisin like alien/creature standing my ancestral lands with a Golden Glove encrusted with jewels. In one picture, he turned my brother to dust.
Chief Mechanic: I wasn’t trying to keep the truth from Leo. I wanted to have a conversation in person about it. It was going to be tonight until Jeffrey decided we just had to do a bunch of talk shows in the morning. We need the world to love us since we are about to go up against a genocidal purple alien.
Of course, Tony wasn’t expecting to find a six-year-old sitting at one of the worktable drawling with magic markers. Especially a six-year-old who did not look like a local. Only one of the royal bodyguards was standing off to the side watching her, which made Tony realize she was supposed to be there.
“Tell her what is actually happening. Pepper is already going to be mad at me for having you call her. Also, see if you can convince her to go to Malta? I would like her not to end up collateral damage from the purple one.” He is sure she’ll say no, but he needs to try. He is still surprised May Parker Riley agreed to go. But maybe she’s just going for Miles’s sake.
“Yes, unfortunately. It’s a continuous EMP used by the Watchdogs as part of a false flag operation to take out Inhumans that we moved to various places throughout the world and blame it on the Inhumans in the first place. They were using an Inhuman who hated himself to break into the system. But Dr. Suarez is working with him, so I don’t know how this could be happening again.”
“We should. We managed to get this far. I hate leaving things unfinished.”
Me: Probably when I helped put Lily bear to sleep 20 minutes ago. She still wants me there for her bedtime routine. Although, that might be because her daddy disappeared again because he was being a jackass.
Time sent: 11/12/2016 23:02:05
StarkAE: That‘s going to be another fun conversation with Pepper. Friday, sweetheart, please find out who I need to fire for violating company social media policy.
May: We’ll work something out with Kamala’s biological parents. I’m sure they’ll be grateful that we took good care of her while they were gone.
After the movie drops if you want to ask me questions about how the movie will influence this story, you can either PM me on fanfiction dot net or send me a DM through Twitter. Please don’t put anything in the comments section until August.
The boss: I probably should have sent you this text message before I got on the road, but Steve and I are on our way to Pepper’s house. So, you can have the night off.
Friday: According to my sensors, Mr. Stark is now asleep.
Blue phone: Maybe you shouldn’t worry. My experience with the Shield psychologist wasn’t that bad. Her name was Dr. Suarez and she was nice. She gave me a sketchpad and pastels and told me to do whatever I wanted for the hour. I did a lot of sketches of the old neighborhood from memory.
Counselor Laura: Actually, I don’t know. There’s no version of Steve Rogers in the multi-verse that is 100% perfect at sharing his feelings. They’re trying, but they’re not perfect.
"Yo-Yo caused a distraction. I escaped before I could, you know, get arrested. I really did promise Pepper that I would avoid that."
“Thank you. I hope you're right, but I still cried.” Steve acknowledged.
Nomad: Trap?
Anthony: I agree, but not in this case. We were in rehab together once and played a lot of fun tricks on the staff. I’m hotter of course.
“Maybe there is something to that,” Steve said just before he turned on the radio. Thankfully, Friday wasn’t piping in songs of heartbreak this time.
This conversation takes place on October 19.
Me: I feel like there’s a story here.
To be continued…
Counselor Laura: Hey, we are doing another all-hands meeting tonight. Steve is making turtle brownies, and I’m ordering pizza. Tell me what toppings you want.
D: When did you have time to read through that? I haven’t even had time to read anything that came from the other timeline, even though Ann sent me a pre-brief a few hours ago. I’ve managed to get through about a page of the highlights.
Melinda: Yes.
“And who’s fault is that?” Steve asked. And yes, he’s getting glared at for doing that.
To: Tony_Carbonell-Rogers
Karen: He is rolling his eyes right now.
Me: You already know that one is safely with the Princess. I was only called a colonizer once, so I take that as a good sign.
Blue phone: Okay, this part of the conversation didn’t happen. You can tell me when you’re ready. If you’re never ready to say it out loud, that’s okay too. I’m not mad about it.
Agent L. Barton: Then I’m going to approach her today. We need to get somebody in to help Simmons now. Rio can only do the body part.
Tony: The independent thing is also kind of hard for them to deal with.
Nomad: Multiple times. It’s going to be fine.
Tony: OK, obviously, this little quiz was developed by people who were not famous due to the misfortune of being born to a famous person. Because really the answer is no you do not want to be famous but if you must, let it be for something good you did on your own and not for something like being the Merchant of Death or being the kid of the guy who invented the atomic bomb.
Me: Although not enough brownie points to keep a leader that doesn’t want to enforce the registration provision of the Accords.
Me: Liberty is down.
Nomad: I get that now.
Red phone: Not tonight. That requires the good drugs and I’m abstaining, but I’m willing to talk about Jarvis.
HSBF: I hope we never get to that point.
“Take your sandwich and go cuddle with Parker. You’ll feel better after you eat and get a cuddle in. I made his sandwich too because I know the smell of food will wake him up.”
Venom: I do not want a rebound relationship. You know if the world wasn't ending, I wouldn't even be considering this right now at all. It's too soon.
Me: No, Sugar Pie gets to leave Wednesday. I have to play nice Thursday and then I have a few meetings in France, and yes, I promise not to touch the wine. So I think I get back to the country about a week from today.
“I can understand why your father wouldn't want to write about me dying in his arms. I don't think I want to read an account of me dying in his arms.” Peter tells the group, trying not to think about the other timeline, but it was hard.
Me: He refers to it as being the man in the chair. I’m recommending him to Coulson for the communications track. Maybe he can do the assessment during his detention with me this week.
Me: No
“Not really,” Sam replied as he was trying to catch his breath.
Cuddle bunny: If I told you when I first found out that Hydra had your parents murdered, would you have reacted the way that you did? I don’t think you would have. I think you would’ve had more time to process things.
May: We’re going to have a breakfast this morning to start putting that together.
Counselor Laura:  That makes sense. And let me guess, she didn't make a copy?
Purple arrow 2018: Well, it's nice to know Phil being a dick is a universal constant. He still hasn't called me after his last alien kidnapping Friday. I know his kid is missing, but he could still check-in.
Person that cares about my boss: So he has an 11-year-old and a six-year-old with him to meet the president? To discuss the treatment of enhanced persons under the Treaty?
T Stark: Of course it’s not the first time I’ve gotten the lawyers mad. They’re mad at me a lot.
“Yes.”
But don’t be sad. I heard that you’re going to go to DC to hang out with your uncle Phil for a couple of days. It should be fun once he explains to your big brother why he had to fake his death like Grandpa Nikki. I asked Yo Yo to give you a Stark Phone Jr with Friday preloaded. If you want to talk to me, she will help you. I’m sure Ms. Melinda will give me my phone back as soon as we get to wherever we’re going.
Nomad: Not always. You’re a good person, Tony Stark, deep down, where it counts. I’m sure she’s seeing that.
Other warnings: Grab tissues (for crying, not the other thing.)
Nomad: So I am dating Tony?
Tony: Because I promised Sugar Bear I would do it. I was kind of hoping you would not respond.
"Now that never crossed my mind. Not once did I consider that possibility. Happy knows things from the bad old days that he could make a fortune off of selling to the tabloids."
Nomad: Because I’m not sure if either one of us is ready to dive into your Howard issues, I’m going to ask how your coffee date with POTUS went.
Number Unknown: This is your ex-girlfriend's niece. I just want to let you know that your boyfriend is perfectly fine, despite what tabloids are reporting.
Counselor Laura: Granted, I've been told Thanos' motives through my Robin's visions, but I thought he wanted to destroy half of life so the other half could thrive. Genocidal population control if you will. Isn’t eliminating fertility issues counter to that?
Nomad: You’re probably right. You’re probably more understanding of why Coulson did what he did because you’re a therapist. Tony’s therapist actually. Is he okay. Did something happen with his presidential meeting? Is that why you’re contacting me right after Friday did?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are absolutely wonderful.
Anthony: And we all know I’m really bad at it. The whole thing with Michelle was why I didn’t tell anybody about the Palladium poisoning. I wanted my last few days or what I thought were going to be my last few days to be good. I didn’t want my friends to run away from me because they couldn’t deal with it. I didn’t want people to look at me with pity or be crying all the time.
Me: It’s probably better if he hears it from you then an intelligence report from your host country. Tony kept it from the news, but I know the hubby has a new job using his special skills for you know who.
Melinda: Nothing happens if you don’t try. Isn’t that what you always tell our daughters? Maybe you should stop preaching to everyone else and take your own damn advice.
Cuddle Bunny: Has she reached out to you?
HSBF: I’m sure you are. So, despite your other friend being stuck in Washington, are you having a good time?
"No, Natasha is out there. As well as agents Davis and Piper. Actually, it sounds like she just pulled an icer out on them both. If things go too badly, we will just drag their unconscious bodies to separate rooms."
"No you don’t. Especially because I convinced Mister and Mrs. Purple Arrow to bring the kids over before we leave for India.”
Me: Wonderful subject change. Do you count it as poisoning if whoever did it intentionally switched out the oil that they fried the pita bread for the appetizer with to something that would make your target swell up like a balloon?
Agent M: Mostly. You know your children are taking this better than you?
"Question 30 is about the last time you cried. It asked in front of other people or privately but let's just go with crying in general. Besides, I think we both started to tear up earlier with some of the questions, which is why I decided we should take a break." Tony's babbling, but Steve finds it endearing.
Counselor Laura: Friday? I have one more question for you. What is this decimation that you keep referring to?
Me: No, she punched out the reporter because he had the audacity to ask her if she only used the EpiPen on Anthony because she didn’t want the company to lose their head of R&D. Slingshot had to use her super speed to keep it from being worse. Thank God nobody thought to slow down the YouTube footage before it was switched out.
Cuddle bunny: I can’t repeat H’s reactions to the footage.
Love: By the ATCU which is really Shield which meant that Coulson would have your back, not the black ops part of the CIA that may or may not actually be CIA.
Monkey lover 2: I would just like to avoid them being blown up again and being flung through space and time.
Tony Potts: Only when he was really drunk. Which is another reason why I need to not pick up the bottle even though it’s tempting. I don’t want to be Howard.
"I really don’t want to."
TMNS: Yes. We might even be out longer. It depends on how things go this afternoon. There’s a meeting at 2:30 PM. That’s part of the reason why I’m up now. I have to be there.
Me: He's an asshole, so of course he threatened to hurt my children if I don't lead them straight to you. He is worried about us being vigilantes, when he is enough of a monster to threaten to put my toddler in foster care/state custody and do worst to the older kids. I've been in foster care. I'm not letting that happen. I'll talk to you when I'm done.
Nomad: Me too. By the way, they are your friends too.
Anthony: I wasn’t avoiding you.
Nomad: Well, it probably would’ve been really hard to hide her mom being the public founder of Shield.
Tony: I will have Friday get on that.
Red phone: Which apparently was how Hydra got their hands on the formula to make super soldiers, again.
“Okay, as much as I want to continue this and possibly remove some clothing, we have to go rescue your other self,” Hunter said as he reluctantly pulled away, very reluctantly. These jeans were too tight.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Now for something different in honor of Steve surviving 98 years of life, a conversation not from the perspective of Tony or Steve's cell phone. I'm going to let you guess who "me" is in this chapter. I will let you know in the next chapter.
HSBF: Now he has an energy shield to keep that from happening.
The new consultant: We call him Spidey Junior, and you’re going to have to ask Tony to explain that nickname.
Me: Friday has a big mouth and it's actually been about three days. Of course, I haven’t talked to him in those three days, but you can’t act like a teenager when your boyfriend is on the international most wanted list. I can show some restraint.
HSBF: That would definitely be a perfect day.
Me: Because of course my love life is so much more important than anything of actual importance. I’m so glad I’m going to be in a place where the press can’t get too close for a few more days.
3. You love kids. You absolutely love them, especially your kids. I see that in the way your protective of Benji, the Purple Arrow children, Ms. Marvel and Spidey Junior. Even before I knew that you were pen pals with that kid from Tennessee. And I think you would make a good father/guardian to a child someday, as long as you don’t do a repeat of Germany. That was stupid.
"Maybe.” Tony answered honestly snuggling into Steve a little bit more. Super soldier six-packs are awesome. Also, the sheets at this hotel are like silk.
Anthony: To the point where it bites us all in the ass.
Me: So that’s why you’re already back in New York?
At the same time I would like for Leopold to see a psychiatrist but he seems to be to focus on trying to prevent the end of the world. The obsession with preventing this is unhealthy. I have discussed this with his partner Lance Hunter well and he has agreed to assist with this endeavor.
“That probably would work best. I would hate to damage the ring when punching someone.”
Counselor Laura: You’re not your father.
HSBF: We still have to come up with public answers before we meet up in Mumbai.
Nomad: Where did you get the name from?
Me: OK late lunch it is.
Nomad: What is rimming?
Stephen C: Yes. We are having breakfast with Lily’s aunt and the counselor in an hour. She knows you’re my ex-girlfriend now, by the way.
Red phone: I assume that you saw her as a kindred spirit because she was just as lonely and lost as you were?
Nomad
"That's messed up."
We also have a new beta going forward on this story. SPNxBookworm will be taking over for Ursula who did a fabulous job. (This conversation also had additional assistance from KnowInsight.) Again, I would like to thank all the wonderful people who volunteered. I may end up calling upon you at some point in the future.
“I know we will, I am just concerned about the cost,” Leo said worriedly.
Dear Mr. Stark:
Purple Princess: What we kept off of social media was they went to Norway and got their asses handed to them by someone who may or may not be Thor and Loki’s long-lost sister. Then they disappeared into the biosphere.
Red phone: Since you asked your rhetorical question it’s my turn. I want to know more about your ex-girlfriend?
Also, during the break another MCU movie came out so the 30 day rule is in effect. I don’t know if we will finish posting the rest of this story before Endgame comes out, but we shall see.
Agent 13: You have an ex-boyfriend?
Me: Because she has a glare that could melt vibranium. Pepper is the only other woman I know that can do that with just an expression.
“Yes. It’s hard to accept this all on faith. If you would’ve told me immediately instead of lying to me about it for the last six months, I would have found the situation more plausible. I mean, if I find myself back in the past, I would seek you out first.” Simmons said turning to Leo. “Instead, you went to Hunter.”
Me: How nice.
Monkey lover 2: You’re ridiculous. I’ll see you soon.
Me: That’s good. I think a lot of our issues, especially the Bucky related stuff you need to work out for yourself before we even tried to deal with it.
Nomad: S?
I actually saw you die. No, you died in my arms. Your heart stopped. If I wasn’t sitting next to you with an EpiPen in my purse, you would be dead right now. It wasn’t a super villain that got you, but a disgruntled employee. All they needed to know was you can’t have sunflower seeds. The greatest irony of all was I was the one who asked your assistant to make sure the caterers and the event planner had your allergy list. My actions almost got you killed.
Love: It is a miracle, the UN actually got something right.
“Yes, but I’m not always the biggest fan of cheese sticks and orange slices. That was all she wanted to eat for like two weeks back in July.”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. So here we are, the last chapter of our story, excluding the epilogue.
Me: Thank you for standing up to corrupt politicians for me. This whole thing makes me kind of glad he’s no longer with us.
Tony: How many times have you been shot at this year?
“You're the best, Ana. Especially because you considered nothing from Talbot as being necessary.”
Avenger Friday: Of course, Director May-Rogers.
Tony: Still the plan because we can’t come up with anything better. Although Jane from PR wants us to do a joint interview with the New York Times where we ask each other the 36 questions that lead to love.
Me: Speaking of emotional counters that probably required baked goods of some sort, was Clint with you when Agent Agent stopped by to save your ass? That incident probably would require at least three dozen bacon glazed doughnuts.
For those of you reading this on fanfiction dot net, you’re going to want to check out Tumblr or the version of this story on Archive of Our Own to see the art by Misaky0. However, alternative text below.
Me: I can’t finish that sentence because Lila just came into play.
HSBF: Have you talked to Happy since the dinner at Pepper’s house?
Anthony: Also, speaking of situations that could blow up, Ross has decided to show up for the last day of the conference, which is something that the Secretary hasn’t done in years.
“We’ll figure out how to do things differently here.” He whispered to MJ. Flash got up from the couch, motioning for Peter to scoot over. MJ followed so that Flash could sit beside her on the other side so he could wrap an arm around her.
“I don’t want you to be my rebound." Steve acknowledged, shocked he said that out loud.
Me: And Tumblr and Twitter along with Instagram. Flash’s video of Elizabeth punching Benjamin in the genitalia before transferring seems to be the most popular. It’s a mime now. I am still not happy that my boss just let it go.
Me: It’s the truth. You are not Captain America anymore. You don’t even want me to call you Captain Sexy Pants.
Tony: No, our AIs in the two timelines are conspiring with each other and sent May a bunch of work stuff. Although she's going to possibly come up on the weekend.
Anthony: The stock prices have kind of been wacky on that front, in part because of the incident. Attempted murder of a majority shareholder/Head of the board of directors/Head of R&D usually sends stocks down unless he is a complete and utterly incompetent asshole. I think I’m at least half competent, even if I really am an asshole.
Anthony: You are no fun.
Steve: I thought Friday oversees the Avenger network?
Steve: Who is Ana Jr.?
“Laura was the one who made the arrangement. She’s the one who is shield now. Clint is retiring, but now that it’s actually an agency again he’s going to get a pension.”
Steve feels gentle lips press against him as he opens his eyes to see Tony. Everything is still dark which doesn’t surprise Steve because the clock says 3:22 AM.
MayMQ: This is not new information, his hatred for Ross anyway. I am surprised that he doesn’t want to go after Rogers when he wants Daisy back.
Tony: I do like the sex in your costume.
“Well, it looks like we are getting a new answer to the crying question," Tony remarked. “Which is not surprising because I think these questions are designed to make everyone cry. I hope the other Tony sent Jane a really nice apology cookie basket.”
I’m not really ready to meet your boyfriend yet. I’m not sure he is ready to meet with me either due to our history, despite the apology basket. Alcohol would probably need to be involved and I don’t think I can drink. And I’ve been told that he shouldn’t. Again, mostly by the Princess. How does she know so much?
Venom: Yet, I didn’t pick up on it when I was living in the Stark-Rogers household. I just assumed Benji was holding back in PE to keep the boy in the chair from feeling bad.
Me: Look, the dating someone on my team isn’t going to be a problem for the foreseeable future because Rhodey can’t deal with getting you guys back in the good graces of the UN until Shield has at least rolled out as a real agency again. That’s probably not good to happen the second Wednesday in November.

(See the end of the chapter for
Agent M: Not until after we move on it and then it will be all over the news. Give us about 36 hours.
“Okay I’m sorry for asking Friday not to pass any messages to us,” Steve said looking up from his own phone. Apparently, he must’ve got similar messages. “The power went off in DC about a minute after I asked Friday to do that.”
Tony Potts: Already done. Do you want me to lock him out?
Nomad: I can’t help when I figure things out.
“I apologize again for not bringing you back a slice last time.”
TMNS: We appreciate honesty.
Tony: I’m not surprised. I guess I should be happy that he hasn’t sold us out to Eberhardt yet.
Steve: Marginally so. I think you should look at her photo album.
Me: Yes, multiple times because you haven’t returned her phone calls. Probably because you’ve been preoccupied with the boyfriend.
Me: Probably a mission to get himself killed. I can’t deal with that. I can barely afford to pay for the therapy that his babies will need to get over that and I’m a billionaire.
Counselor Laura: I’m here if you need me.
The boss: That’s not accurate. I didn’t want to lose Morgan. I didn’t want her to lose me. I’m not some heartless monster who doesn’t want to bring everyone else back. I know you lost Bobbi. We all lost people; even Carol lost her stepdaughter. Although, does the person count as your stepdaughter if the marriage happened after they were dusted?
HSBF: Even if it was designed by a 16-year-old Royal?
“Which is a shame because Natasha’s would probably be the most interesting.” Steve added.
MJ: I feel like that is an Ana question even if this is my independent study period. Don’t you have the AI on your work phone?
century?” Steve asked curious.
Monkey lover 2: That was going to happen anyway now that Director Rhodes knew there were two of us. It's better that we're not in the same place or on the same team. Apparently, the training I received while in the Framework makes me better suited for the Avengers. And I’m bringing you along.
“My talk with Sam went well enough this afternoon, so I’m willing to sit down to breakfast, but I don’t think they’re going to want to do a 4 AM breakfast tomorrow. The wedding is at 6 AM tomorrow. Maybe Sunday instead?” Tony suggested and Steve just nodded his head. “Okay, now I really wish I could have gotten here yesterday, but there was a board meeting that I had to go to since Pepper is laying low due to evil ex boyfriends.” Steve also wished Tony got there a day earlier, but he is well aware of how busy his boyfriend really is.
Tony: I knew that I felt like I was dealing with two different people and I was right. Leo came from the darkest timeline, which is why he needs quality time with Suarez and to consider new job prospects. Trying to save the world is too stressful.
Me: Possibly. Look, I’m not letting that asshole win. We were good together and we can be good together again. We just have to figure out a way to get unbroken.
Me: So in addition to making sure some sunflower was in every single entrée for the dinner, she was also caught moving money from the foundation to various banks in Russia. The same banks that have ties to the Watchdogs.
Updated A/N Winter 2020: Now I write this, and we are only a couple of weeks away from Wandavision. I think this is going to be my last chapter before the show starts. Yes, I did cry when AOS ended, but they were happy tears. So I actually have up to chapter 32 drafted. It's just a question of proofreading. I could use additional betas. I currently only have one beta and  Grammarly.
Cuddle Bunny: How long?
Artwork again by the wonderful Misaky0
Melinda: Why?
Red Phone: Even if she’s in California 90% of the time, it feels like the company’s not big enough for the both of us. I would leave if I could, but my name’s on the front of the building, so I don’t think I can.
“Siberia,” he argued back.
Red phone: Don't jinx me.
“It's very hard to keep things from your life partner. I feel like it would be doubly so when your life partner is a spy.” Tony remarked.
Red phone: I've vaguely remember telling you something about the blue aliens in South Dakota and Agent Agent not being dead.
HSBF: Of course.
Me: That’s good, I think. This whole thing seems really weird. Your bots have their own room?
Steve: OK, Melinda said she doesn't want to leave Hunter and Simmons together unsupervised. She also has reading from the other timeline.
Part of me thinks that you’ve skipped off to where ever ‘Stefan’ is, but Phil has reassured me that’s not the case. That was a deeply unpleasant conversation for several reasons. When were you going to tell me that Phil was back? Or is that just one of those things we don’t talk about? We have a really lengthy list of things that we need to talk about and I’m tired of avoiding those conversations so I’m going to start now.
Nomad: I think we established this is not a kidnapping. If it were, you wouldn’t be talking to me right now.
“I’m starting to realize that now.”
“Because I don’t want to be involved in your wedding planning at all,” May remarked.
"I'm surprised you're willing to wait that long." Sam remarked.
"I think you have to leave." Steve said pulling away.
Tony: But see, you would be the Paragon of Virtue trying to tame the evil asshole. I would be the guy ruining the Paragon of Virtue.
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: I hope so too. I remember what happened after Pearl Harbor. I’m still ashamed of the internment camps.
Steve: She’s definitely from a different timeline? One where me and Tony start talking to each other again after Siberia?
Blue phone: Because you’re texting me when you're supposed to be paying attention.
I do not know if I can survive weeks or months with Loki as my only companion. Why did Robin want me to come to Asgard? Did she know this was going to happen? Why am I here? I have no idea.
Red phone: A registry of all enhanced people. Or as I like to think of it, “The easy way for super villains to get the addresses of the people who want to kick their asses”.
To be continued…
HSBF: That’s good, I think.
Tony Potts: That’s normal. Also, Melinda says teenagers are incredibly moody. I'm not looking forward to Morgan’s teenage years. I don't know why my other self decided to start with teenagers and preteens.
CoulsonPJ: Then someone else will argue that Tony is really of super villain/still the merchant of death and then it all starts over again. It’s a never-ending cycle. I had to stop for Tylenol.
The Mechanic: I tried to ground him and well, you saw how that went. After consulting with an actual parent, it was determined that the best course of action is monitoring and additional training. But it’s going to be your call.
Tony: Unfortunately, you can’t punch everybody or so my therapist says.
Tony: Especially if you are not wearing anything.
Anthony: 3. Piper scares me.
Tony: BTW, the not so reformed doctor based Aida’s body on that of his former girlfriend. She left him last year right before he started working for the founder of the cult of the squid. Which makes this afternoon creepier and reminds me of a couple of Buffy episodes.
Maria isn’t complicated. She was the good parent. One of them anyway. Anna and Jarvis were the other members of the parenting team with Howard doing who knows what really. Maria was the type of person who would come all the way down to boarding school so we could just hang out together. She was the one who told Howard off for being a prick. She was the one who told me I deserved better than my first idiot boyfriend that outed me to the press.
Anthony: Because you didn’t hit the snooze button when Friday woke us up at 4 AM.
Tony: See, I knew I would wear you down eventually. Now your “no” is conditional. I can work with this.
Purple arrow: Hey Ana, you have a list of everybody who was lost during the decimation in the other timeline in your data bank, right?
Me: We are definitely not have these types of conversations.
"OK, we have 45 minutes before we get to the Lighthouse. So, I say we eat something while I contact platypus and Carter Junior.”
Cuddle Bunny: You’re bringing a six-year-old to a presidential meeting? Did you just curse in front of a six-year-old?
This was a double bonus for me because I needed to re-watch the movie to work on two special top-secret Star Trek projects. These projects will probably not see the light of day until September. I hate moving.
believe that you're a romantic at heart.  Even if somehow Tony forgives me, he is with Pepper. He loves Pepper. I think it will take years for us just to get to the point of being friends. There’s too much baggage, and I don’t know how to work through it. I don’t even know where to start.
Nomad: ‘Do you have any siblings?’
HSBF: Are you guys fighting again?
Also, please note that Tony is sending these emails from two different accounts. Tony_Carbonell is Tony’s private email account for personal non-Avenger, non-sensitive email. The Mechanic is Tony’s Avenger email account. Only Avengers, selective support staff, and Pepper know about this address.
“That makes sense.”
Melinda: That’s not what she’s doing. You know that. She stuck in her fantasy reality again. Probably with half a bottle of wine, at least.
Red phone: Next, because of that lack of reaction, they’re sending me to mandatory therapy.
Me: I don’t think I’ve seen that movie.
Me: Are they being awful to her?
“As soon as we’re not dealing with multiple Apocalypses simultaneously." Because, of course, they are. At least the Confederacy has already been handled. The earth was still in one piece, so that’s a win.
Tony: When he went dark, he went to find Ross’s daughter. She’s still a professor at Bruce’s old school. Despite being fortyish, she has a three-month-old daughter name Roberta Glen. Purple Arrow told her what Ross was planning to do to his kids and, well, parents have a tendency to stick together. She also happened to be a friend of May’s late husband, who was inhuman.
Genius Princess: I will be at the Lighthouse in two hours. We will have a briefing. I would bring BITC in, but he's with his mom this weekend, and she doesn't like your dad very well.
Tony: Antiserum. Vaccines protect against infection that have yet to take place.
Nomad: And you have nobody that can break the encryption?
Cuddle Bunny: I did not choose Bucky over everything. I just… I’m not even sure how to talk about it.
TMNS: No, not at all.
Director Snookums: Because your boyfriend used to blush every time someone told a dirty joke in his presence, usually you. I don't need to be reading that. I walked in on enough of those situations when we shared an apartment at MIT.
Anthony: I don’t want the CIA to show up either and I do trust Laura.
“But you’re planning on experiencing it firsthand momentarily. Speaking of experience, you dated Melinda May and you never told me?” Natasha asked.
Nomad: I don’t think Sharon can be considered your nemesis by any stretch of the imagination. You two just need to talk things out. Never mind, I need to be there to supervise that conversation (message not sent)
Football Hunter: To come back to me?
Me: Political appointees don’t always have the necessary background needed to do the job. Although considering the Shield image problem, a PR person may be helpful. Sometimes it’s more about who you know and the former congressional staffer is very anti-enhanced person and knows a lot of people. Really, the list just goes downhill from there.
“Because I can’t think coherently when you’re naked and in bed with me. Thankfully, Friday would have totally woke us up in time.”
Nomad: You really need to stop sending messages like that when you’re 6000 miles away and we can’t do anything about it. (message not sent)
Red spider: Yes. Don’t ask me how. You know Stark gave his boy access to everything.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all wonderful. Thank you for your kind words. We are still here in the bad timeline.
Hunter: Then, the purple one came?
Blue phone: Never say never (message not sent)
Me: And apparently, that doesn’t even stick.
“Agreed.”
Me: And encourages it because it keeps him from more destructive behavior.
Melinda: There are also some anger issues. Leo barely kept him from burning the last member of the gang that put his little brother in a wheelchair alive. And there’s video footage of that. New SHIELD is being watched too closely right now to function in the gray.
MayMQ: Very true.
On her workbench, there seemed to be a few drawings of him as well. One looks like he’s in the desert being very sad with sand running through his hand. There’s another one of him surrounded by chaos wearing a gauntlet with Multicolored gems on it facing that purple raisin. Another one looks like him and several kids at a wedding that seems to be taking place out at a lighthouse. He is also kissing Steve in that one. He likes that better. He’s pretty sure one of those kids was Afia and maybe an older version of Lily bear.
Anthony: So, I’ve been informed that in 14 days Stefan Carter will be making his debut as my very public boyfriend at the Stark Industries sponsored conservation event on the margins of a huge conference I am crashing.
Anthony: I am allowed to do Stark Industries' business and some of the weapons being sold were either retrofitted or counterfeit Stark Industries weapons. We don’t like being associated with xenophobic terrorist organizations.
Tony: We are, but he hates sitting through these types of lunches. Also the restaurant is vegan and Happy is not a fan of vegan cuisine.
Subject: Re: I’m proud of you.
Nomad: What is our relationship?
Anthony: I know, but do you have any idea how much I would give to have one more conversation with Maria or even Howard for that matter?
Real-life artist: Misaky0
Captain tight pants: I’m not surprised. Peggy has always been that type of person.
The Big Boss: He has a point. You could come out for a few months. I'm sure Dumm-E misses the sun.
“You've never been just the dumb muscle. Now can you please get out of the air vent, or I will have Friday use the gas on you.” Natasha threatened him.
“I know you want Robin to meet your BFF. Did you know that your James is dating Robin’s mom in the other timeline? Now I’m extra sad that she died before the snap. It was another wasted life just like Agent Rodriguez.” Tony never met the woman before Thanos killed her. Apparently, she’s one of other Tony’s best friends per the notes he read from Friday.
Hunter: I’m surprised you haven’t gone for the bottle yet.
Me: I think that might be good, even if you’re okay now. You complain about me getting shot a lot but you’re also constantly in danger. And you have pre-existing conditions. You’re also as good about ignoring them as I was before the serum. Now I understand why mom was always worried.
“That is true. Okay, we are definitely doing the rest of these questions later.” Tony already felt exhausted. “Maybe we can do the next batch on the ride home?”
Me: You were special. Normal 15-year-olds don’t make the best decisions. He has wanted to be a full team member for the last few months. It’s all he talks about. I’m not sure if he really gets what that means. It’s not all punching aliens in Manhattan.
“Obviously, this thing was written by people who have never been famous for reasons outside of their control. I think that’s why I’m trying so hard to keep Morgan from the press. They don’t bother us at the cabin.” Tony explained.
“That’s good. So what’s the bad news?” Steve asked.
Agent Laura: Your former therapist and the head of the ATCU’s psych department. We are a bit more social work than spy agency now. We do more outreach and fewer guns blazing. We are training more counselors like me to be agents. It’s something that your other self pushed for. Thankfully the President agreed with us.
The Mechanic: You were good at it though. The current Under Secretary for Environment, Economics, and Energy used to be one of my execs at SI before she took the job. So there’re precedents.
Tony: Yes, I also have GMA Tuesday morning. I have to sell everybody on me being happy and stable in a committed relationship with somebody who just happens to look a lot like that guy who I was fighting with back in May. Total coincidence. But our stock is going up, so I have to get out there and sing and dance to keep it that way.
The Mechanic: Good. I am really glad Rice is going to State.
TMNS: Makes sense. Thank you for sending me food.
Instead, there was a van parked in the middle of their usual lab space, and standing next to it was Scott. Although she hasn’t met the man in person, Sharon has given her many updates on her charge, complete with pictures, so she instantly recognized the man. What was he doing on the East Coast? His house arrest wasn’t up for a few more weeks.
Red phone: Which is a shame because I think the captain would be good too.
HSBF: What? Why?
Me: And you of all people know that.
Tony: Well if I wasn’t coming here mostly to hook up with you, she would’ve came with me. She comes a couple of times a year for meetings. She’s better at these meetings than I am, which is totally why she is CEO regardless of where things stand between us in our personal relationship.
Me: Yes.
Me: She’ll be starting in January when the new semester starts. Laura thought it would be best.
The constant crying also makes her extremely suspicious. That alone is why she text messaged Tony. Ok, the fact that he said he is from the year 2023 and asked why she is not at the farmhouse made her message Tony and send out an Avenger alert. Her real husband knows full well that she hasn’t been back to her former home since Ross arrested (kidnapped) her from it almost 2 years prior. Something was obviously wrong.
“They are currently trying to create a trans-dimensional communication device.” With those words, Hunter knew there wouldn't be any more sex that night.
Tony: I know what you mean there, Sweetie. I joke about it, but maybe we are not ready for that. I’m not really. I want to be ready, but I’m a little fucked up with more abandonment issues than my poor therapist can really handle.
Inside image: Steve kissing Tony in new uniform (all black and gray. Think the Patriot’s uniform on Agents of Shield without fake muscles). Notice the lack of patch. Tony left that blank in case Steve ever wanted to come back.
HSBF: Did they ask a lot of invasive questions?
"Because then that will be another regret to have during the next near-death experience."
Ana Jr.: That seems reasonable. Also, I have taken the liberty of updating your address book to reflect my name.
Cuddle bunny: Explain?
Me: I’m not going to tell you what to do. But I could ask you what you think you should do?
Red phone: So far they already fired Laura from her school and they’re following me around 24-7. I think I might have to hire an actor to play Cuddle Bunny just to throw them off.
“Personally, I want to see if he could make one of the suits flaming. Imagine what he could do with the Hulk buster. My scientific mind is all a flutter.” Tony sounded so happy when he spoke that Steve couldn’t help but smile. Of course, at that moment a teenager popped into the room. From the pictures from earlier,
HSBF: How absolutely tragic.
“There have been a lot of reports of Nomad hunting down terrorist cells and similar organizations that hurt little children. That’s what I need you to help me with. I’m sure Tony told you what happened to Kamala of Jersey City.”
Friday: The movie or the TV show.
I guess you’re my family now along with the counselor. You’re a good part of my family and I know you love me so that’s good.
“I have no idea why they are not together. I think the only reason why we ended up together is because she thought he was dead.” Steve tells her, honestly.
To be continued…
The Big Boss: That's all I ask. I’m also not surprised. There's going to be a meeting around 12 PM your time.
Red phone: Nor am I expecting you to. Therefore, it’s single hood for me.
Tony: Look, at this point I am still shocked that I’m not facing kidnapping charges for Germany. Nothing, whatsoever, about Germany was a good decision.
Me: Isn’t the development of that type of android illegal?
Genius Princess: I'm still trying to figure that out. I wanted to enlist the BITC's help, but his mother won't allow it.
Red spider: You dislike Jeffrey because he asked out your wife that you’re legally separated from.
Agent 13: Obviously Anthony told you what happened when my mom died from his point of view.
“You didn’t know how time travel actually worked. You thought you were just earlier in the timeline.” Hunter placed a reassuring arm around Leo, pulling him closer to him.
Director Stark: We have a secure Avengers/Shield chat group for it. Everybody hated his boyfriend. Although probably for different reasons than you did.
The new consultant: Is it true that Hale kept her daughter chained to her bed in her condo? Flash always felt something was off with Ruby.
Me: So it wasn’t an accident?
Football Hunter: Not yet. Your baby brother is being extra cautious. He’s just like I remember you before you lived like three different lives. Sweet. Almost innocent. I guess getting kidnapped by a sexual assaulting bot that wants to be a real girl will suck the sweetness out of anyone.
Me: Thanks to therapy, sobriety, and antidepressants, I know that I want him to be a kid for as long as he can be.
Me: OK-ish. Spidey Junior is adjusting. He starts working with his tutor Monday. He’s also going to spend tomorrow with his dad under Laura’s supervision.
“That’s good.”
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Your feedback makes me incredibly happy. Just to let everyone know, this is going to be a slow burn. Tony and Steve’s relationship was completely wrecked in Civil War and now they're trying to rebuild it on a foundation of stone instead of one of sand. That takes time.
Counselor Laura: That's maybe something Friday can look into when I'm not trying to figure out how to avoid an apocalypse. However, they're working on getting me back on their end.
“Is he the six-year-old with spider powers that Tony refers to as Spidey Junior?” Steve asked.
Me: The second option makes you seem like less of a dick.
Me: Things like that are not an issue for me.
Me: And we were all really happy about that until the UN decided to name Jeffrey Deputy Director. Mr. Patriotism makes me nauseous. He’s still trying to put forward mandatory lie detector tests and his color code of security.
“Although that actually smells good, that does not seem to be enough omelets for five people,” Virginia commented.
Agent 13: Yes. I just don't think they were expecting the person in the chair next to him to have an EpiPen. Virginia saved his life.
Love: Because he wants his boy home.
To be continued.
Me: It is dangerous work. And well, I’ve had more than one employee try to kill me, recently. Agent also ran background checks on all of Peter’s friends and Decathlon members.
Girl Friday: I hope so too. I’m going to go sleep. That’s something that I need to do after the latest upgrade.
BITC: Finally, just another year.
“Very true.”
“We scattered them in the ocean in Tahiti together," Steve explained.
Red phone: Which is why my chest still has slight bruising and Pepper left me.
Me: Well, you heard about the explosion in Pasadena yesterday. According to twitter there were earthquakes and a Quake sighting near an abandoned warehouse. And lots of dead bodies. I don’t know how accurate those reports are because Piper is like the only Shield agent talking to me at the moment and she doesn’t even know what’s going on with her team.
Purple Princess 2018: Yes. Plus Steve. We need all notes related to Clint 2023 traveling back to this timeline. Again we have a Simmons who can understand them. Also, we need anything about the location of the stones at present.
Me: Yes. Just finding out about it led to an extra two sessions last week, so I’m surprised mental health rehab wasn’t in the cards earlier.
“My coping strategy was marrying May. She thinks that as long as I'm married to her, I will never completely move forward." Steve is starting to think she might be right. But how does he move forward? How does he do it without losing what he's already gained?
"I’m trying to, but every time I close my eyes I keep thinking about everything that I need to deal with after I leave you and Peter is at the top of the list. It was either have this conversation or ask if Peter should get his superhero onesie back. I don’t want to have to think about all this stuff. I don’t want to go back to all that and leave you behind.” I don’t want you to go back, Steve thinks to himself.
“When was the last time you sang to yourself or someone else?”
The new consultant: Okay, we are on our way there. It's for the best anyway. I don't think we can all squeeze on that one bed. Like you guessed, Afia did send us a picture of you guys in bed together this morning. I see working out together is paying off.
Me: I’m also glad you didn’t have Jane do your dirty work.
Kitty brother: Not the ones of me dying.
Anthony: He grew up across the street from a park that just happened to have a statue of you. That’s a lot for a little kid to live up to.
“Don’t ask. There was a bet involved.” Tony is not giving Steve the whole story on that one.
Tony: Sorry, I totally forgot about time zones. Though, I just thought maybe we can hold off on announcing the engagement until New Year’s Day.
HSBF: I could tell by the almost smile.
“I’m never going to live that down.” Steve placed his head in his hands.
I’m talking to your BFF again. Did he tell you? I’m sure he tells you everything because you’re his best friend that he chose over me. I have this really screwed up tendency to fall in love with people who can never love me the way I love them.
“Pretty much, and that was all Laura’s idea. I wish she could be the head of the new agency.”
Boss: He’s going up against terrorist cells alone again, isn’t he, because he has a death wish? Again, he has the self-preservation skills of a slug.
To be continued…
Cuddle Bunny: Are you sure that it's him?
The Mechanic: What do you think about the Spidey mobile? I mean I probably could paint it blue and red, but that might be tacky.
FRIDAY: Several of which have been forwarded to your personal email account.
Me: Besides, I seriously doubt POTUS will be going to choose a third Secretary of State.
Agent Johnson: He tried to hug me, and I quaked him. Hunter is staying behind to deal with his husband and the mysterious Deke person. I am following the brothers to find their father in Norway.
Me: Perfect. Enjoy your vacation. If this wasn’t a trip for me to see my boyfriend, I would’ve brought Pepper along so she could have a distraction from that asshole. I should totally send you guys to the Bahamas or someplace warm but not Tahiti. Tahiti has been tainted.
Karen: I have just been informed that Dr. Eli Morrow has been contained and a press conference will be happening momentarily. Slingshot thanks you for her new flame resistant uniform.
Me: Don’t ask for details because you don’t want to know. You really don’t.
Me: It’s always hard to watch your kids grow up or at least that’s what grandma Reilly used to say. We’ll talk more Saturday.
Me: Probably Shawn. Text me later. I’ll try to respond if I’m not in lockup.
Venom: One can hope.
“You’re still friends. So it’s always going to be her problem. Friends always worry.”
Nomad: Understandable. What did he say?
“I don’t know if you need to make up Hunter’s room for guests. It depends on if May is staying over tonight. Apparently, she’s in the city for a mission.”
Tony: I’m sure she has tons of great shots of me babysitting and covered in food particles.
Tony: I know I could call Jane myself, but I feel like you should hear this from me and not her. You deserve that much.
T Stark: Finally, because I’m in the green room I don’t necessarily want the producer who asked me to autograph her daughter’s plush of me to hear this.
At that question, Laura realized that Bruce never asked her about that. Bruce never asked her any questions about her being a Shield agent. This made Laura think that Melinda deliberately kept that information from the man.
(See the end of the chapter for
Counselor Laura from 2023: You don’t need to worry about me. I’m OK here. Just concentrate on making sure that what happened here doesn’t happen there.
“Laughter is necessary. This is one of those too absurd not to laugh situations. Also, I am totally open for a threesome.” Tony remarked.
So this is probably the best place to remind you that I am the queen of fade to black. If anybody wants to write what they’re doing in their hotel room contact me. We can work something out but I just don’t write that type of material. I am not comfortable with it.
He is also well aware of how badly Siberia went. We all made a lot of mistakes. I should’ve went to Tony directly, instead of assuming that he wouldn’t help us. I should’ve told him about what Hydra did to his parents before we knew what they made you do. If he had time to process, I think he would he dealt with the situation very differently. But you can’t change the past. You can only move forward.
The movie is 99% cannon compliant for this story. Seriously, I don’t know how this keeps happening. I keep thinking the new stuff will completely invalidate what I’m doing. Yet, it keeps working (although, I did have to change one thing in this conversation to reflect the tweaked timeline). Please read the continuity note below for specifics on where the movie falls in the timeline of this story. I’m vague, but it’s a little spoiler-ish for Black Panther, so only read if you’ve already seen the movie. However, you can safely read the upcoming chapters without being spoiled.
Anthony: Although I’m sure the Manhattan University Children's Hospital will like all these bears. I’m doing an event Monday for Labor Day. I don't know what to do with the flowers and balloons, though.
Me: That’s an improvement. Do you want to send them to me so I can look at them?
Purple arrow 2023: Friday also sent them to Stark too because Ana told her to. I can hear the cursing from the air vents. He's not happy.
“That would make Steve sad.”
Me: Which would at least get rid of the toxic sexual tension (message not sent)
Me: Will do, Gumdrop.
May: Because I need you and Stark at the compound for the mission tonight.  But I still want our kids safe.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. You’re great and keep me motivated. If you just didn’t expect me to upload another chapter Tuesday, you missed out on seeing some excerpts from Steve’s sketchpad related to the last conversation. Please go check it out and give our wonderful artists Misaky0 some love.
“Because they might demand that you test your loyalties on your own child.”
Anthony: Oh my poor sexually deprived little lamb. I wish things were less screwed up so I could demonstrate in person. Let's just say it's a sexual activity that should freak out whoever is reading this enough to get them to turn away. Although I do wonder what your enhanced tongue could do.
Apparently, I only need to sleep for two hours, which will be enough to override Wanda’s forced sleep requirement. Although if it’s an emergency, really, she should let it go. Ana is going to look into that.
“Don’t give me that look. Do you really think we’re going to be able to find all the infinity stones and then magically snap our fingers and bring everybody back?” Simmons asked bitterly.
Me: No, still at an undisclosed location, but I can talk to you again which is nice. I was hoping it was Laura keeping you abreast of what’s going on.
“We’ll talk soon,” Steve said before pulling Tony into one last kiss.
“In an effort to be honest with each other, I should tell you that other Tony had Aunt Peggy exhumed and found out that it wasn’t really Alzheimer’s but a Hydra drug-induced version of it." That was the only Hydra-related intel that Friday put in his primer, probably because it was family-related.
“You two are so hopeless. Flirt later.” MJ said, grinning at the two from his other side. “Afia, has your dad got back to you about letting me access Daisy's suit cam and rapid Avenger reports? I can’t wait to let Daisy know that her suit records everything, despite having to do written reports.”
The first set of email addresses are Peter and Tony’s Avenger addresses, because of course Tony set up a highly encrypted Avengers only email system (that Daisy/Quake totally broke into and therefore Fitz now has access to).
Me: Christ. And this is why [redacted] didn’t tell me? He was afraid I would kick him out or worse?
Me: At least I know you’re in a country where you kind of know the language. I’m not surprised. The news has been Wakandan all the time for the last 24 hours. My friends at the State Department are more excited about future diplomatic relations with Wakanda than the fact that their boss will be leaving by the time the inauguration happens regardless of who wins the election.
May: Exactly.
D Fitzsimmons: I'm not sure if this will work, but I'm going to try anyway. This is the perfect time because the Princess is having a frappe in the living room, and grandpa is making out with Hunter in the corner. In between talking shit about me because he still thinks I'm the same guy who sold out Daisy to the Blues. Because they're distracted, this is the best time to send you a bunch of text messages to see how you're doing. They won't be looking over my shoulder to see me asking you how much you drank today. Or if you were drinking while in the lab. I don't like it when you do that.
Nomad: Jesus. He should’ve told you what was going on. Maybe not all the details but enough so you could understand the gravity of the situation.
Me: It takes a special type of person to clean up the murder bot fiasco.
From: Tony_Carbonell
Cuddle bunny: Along with showing me video footage of a very much alive Agent Coulson at a conference on how the alien contagion triggered metamorphosis/inhuman situation in Taiwan in February.
“So why are you here?”
Me: That was going to get very confusing really quickly especially because both of them have the most potent death glares I have ever seen. I didn’t think anybody could top Pepper and yet the Mays can.
Love: Carter play double agent?
Tony: You’re no fun. Breakfast was disappointing merely because of the lack of your presence. I did have a good meeting with the head of SI India, followed by an even better meeting with the R&D team here. They’re coming up with some good applications for the exoskeleton that I created for Rhodey that are actually practical and insurance companies may pay for. I love it when I get to play with toys while working.
“I know, I just wish we could have a little more time,” Steve lamented to Natasha.
The new consultant: You know I don't see this as a competition between us. I never have.
Nomad: I don't know what I can tell you. You have the transcript of our conversation. I wasn't there to keep this from happening.
“Yes. Okay, I kind of want to drag you into the bedroom, mostly to take that shirt off of you. I want to believe that came from Hot Topic, but dinner first.”
StarkAE: Actually, she is a doctor of osteopathic medicine.
Xxxxx
“Actually, Leo lived the same life as I did up until…” Fitz started to say but Leo cut him off.
“Yes. Am I allowed to say one of your good qualities is your ass? I regret that wasn’t the body part that  ended up on Instagram.” He loves that ass.
Me: This time they lost their psych department chair and part of their library. Really you think by this point they would make their library big gigantic monster proof. Okay after two incidents you think they would keep a better eye on the chemicals their faculty are accidentally or accidentally on purpose exposed to.
“Usually, the media, but this guy came up with this one himself.”
“You were so distracting last night that I forgot to mention that the doctors think that James will be ready for visitors by late December. That could be your Christmas present. Since I feel like it’s too early for an engagement ring.” Oh, look, another wedding joke.
“Too late, already did,” Tony said with a smirk.
Sorry I can’t tell you where I am exactly because of what happened in Mumbai. Although I will say I’m somewhere that I actually own. So if things go badly, at least we won’t have to give a quarter million dollar tip. I thought it would be good to lay low for a couple of days after Mumbai. Piper is with us. Although Davis left for a special assignment. I’m really tired of people trying to kill me when I’m working. But hey at least sunflower oil was not involved this time. Hey did you know that some haircare products have sunflower oil. I found that out the hard way recently.
Red phone: Or Congress and the ATCU.
Blue phone: And I was trying to keep you from killing Bucky because once you stopped running on anger and adrenaline, I think you would’ve regretted it.
"I thought it was Head of R&D?" MJ asked for clarification.
“Were they?” Steve asked as he slid onto the bed a little concern for his friend.
Red phone: What is your favorite color?
Blue phone: I also slept with my neighbor, Melinda Garner repeatedly before ‘Nurse Katie’ took over her apartment. Of course, this was after a disastrous two week relationship with Jonathan, who I met at Freddy’s in Arlington.
Cuddle Bunny: Even Pepper has gone on TV to defend you. She actually said things fell apart because your heart was too big to just care about one person. She’s right.
Nomad: No. Both Sam and Clint say that I need professional help.
Nomad: I’m not surprised. She threatened to kill me.
HSBF: That’s good or at least it’s not bad.
Red Malibu: I trust the person who killed my parents more than S.
Me: Or a passport and visa. Apparently, I’m not supposed to give the State Department reasons to come after me. I mean most of Ross’ staff despise him and are praying that the other person wins. Mostly because she doesn’t want to create Inhuman internment camps.
Melinda: How would you feel about a new teammate that kills evil people and only evil people? He’s useful, but the organization is in a probationary period.
Epilogue here we come!
“If I say undoing what Thanos did, will you get angry?”
Nomad: I bet he wasn’t happy.
"No."
“It was a letter from Bucky or rather my James. Friday decrypted it.”
Me: You look good in blue.
“Did you read any of those messages?” Leo asked.
Tony: That Works, although I don’t even want to think about losing Benji or you for that matter.
Nomad: Good point.
Me: Because he’s one of us?
Purple Arrow: You said, no?
Nomad: Do you want to talk about it?
HSBF: Melinda? Pepper?
Me: Oh god, you're getting pop culture references. What have they been doing to you?
Cuddle Bunny: I would too. I trained with her a couple of times. She even caused me to work up a sweat.
Who do you think Football Hunter is?
Tony: I am aware that the successor for Ross might be worse. And that could be bad for everybody under the accords although Talbert is pretty benevolent. I think Coulson broke him in.
Iron Dad: I know you’re scared about what happened in the other timeline, but that’s not us. We’ve been preparing for well over a year, and we won’t lose.
FRIDAY: Agent Melinda May’s married last name was Garner. When she lived next door to you, she was still utilizing her married name due to the fact she acquired the apartment after leaving her husband but before returning to her maiden name professionally.
“Was a disaster. A lot of stuff happened there that all parties regret. More than we will ever really know about. Only three people know what really happened. One of those three is in long-term treatment for literally decades of torture. So you’re going to have to talk to Tony and Steve about that. If they’ve moved past it maybe you should as well.”
Red phone: You were actually younger than me. Contrary to what everybody thinks, I was actually 17.
The Big Boss: Because Phil was taken off the investigation and replaced with somebody who was probably Hydra.
Tony: And she may have got caught in a feedback loop. It was highly uncomfortable and extremely creepy.
HSBF: I thought she wanted to make you look more human.
FRIDAY: However, I am not in a position to tell you if your fears are founded because my contact, Monkey Lover 21 has refused to digitize the documents.
AMA: Against Medical Advice. I just realized I forgot to define this last time that acronym came up.
“I wouldn’t have let that happen.” It would be wrong to her, to Jemma, and even to Hunter to do that. “Did you find Vijay Nadeer?” Leo asked.
“大愚弱智” means “that someone acts like he's very smart, but in fact is an idiot.” I would like to thank KayKIMO who helped me with the word and definition.
Me: So being happy that we’re both alive is number three?
Venom: I hope so
“Part of me doesn’t believe you. Were there any French boys?” Tony asked, raising one eyebrow. It worked.
The Big Boss: He’s upset that your bodyguard is interfering with his job.
“But would we have fallen asleep in time?” Steve asked
“What?" Deke looked at her, puzzled as he spoke.
Really, Hunter should’ve expected everything to go pear shaped very quickly. That’s usually how it is with Shield. Although, he was hoping that Leo’s experience the first time around would keep things from going to shite. No such luck. Which totally explains why the Princess picked him and the special project up from the Lighthouse before making their way to the future home of the West Coast Avengers. Which happens to be a part of the Stark Industries Malibu campus that’s been laying mostly unused since they switched to electronics and clean energy and a good portion of the company moved back east.
Tony: Yes. I have Friday keeping an eye on him, and it’s not good.
Tony: And now we’re in recovery. However, recovery takes time, though. I am still surprised she’s going to let me spend any time with Ben at all. Apparently, in the kid needs some form of a male role model and I am it. Thor help us all.
Love: Does this mean my TSP has been restored?
Morgan’s dad: You're no fun at all. I hate it when you are logical.
Cuddle bunny: He lied about a lot of things.
Me: Can you just tell them to fuck off? You know I don't really care what they think about this. At all. It’s my life and if I want to have a boyfriend, I will have a boyfriend. Really, you can’t do better for PR than a boyfriend who helps the sick and needy all over the world.
Football Hunter: Apparently, every Avenger team needs a hot guy, and your Doctor persona is like Black Widow but with a doctorate. I’ve seen what you could do. We are going to use it to our advantage.
However, Tony doesn’t understand why you stopped being friends. According to Tony that happened long before the breakup. Why have things gotten so stiff and painful between the two of you? Tony blames himself as he tries to analyze what went wrong. You know, Tony. He likes to fix things. He wants to make sure that what happened between the two of you won’t happen between us. More importantly he wants to be your friend. Your friendship is very important to him. Tony’s not sure how to get that back, but he wants to and isn’t that the first step?
“I didn’t need to. I was there when Leo knocked you out.” She may have said a few choice Mandarin curse words at that moment, at least in her head. Outside, her face stayed impassive.
TMNS: So are you dating Captain America now?
Me: I’m starting to realize that not everything is repairable
Me: I’m fine doing that if you and I could make one together. Maybe for LGBTAQ teenagers so they know that they’re not alone. That there are people just like them under the mask saving the world.
Steve: You did try to tell me about it before, but then you think of him, and you stop talking to me.
Me: Exactly, which is why I’m going to do whatever possible to protect my spider child until he’s ready for the world to know who he is beneath the mask. That means pissing off Jane Barnett. Which also means appeasing her somehow so she doesn’t completely ruin me because she’s that powerful
Captain Tight Pants: That was Hydra.
“I’m ashamed of what I did to both of you. And please don’t say it was all your fault because it wasn’t. I acknowledge now that I never dealt with my parents' death. Hell, I never dealt with Anna‘s death or Jarvis', not until therapy, and it’s still a work in progress. A lot of those issues just came out in Siberia. Because all my coping strategies pre-therapy were bad.”
TMNS: Yes. Please don’t tell anyone else at school. Flash isn’t ready to be out publicly yet. Not at our school anyway. Although he is out at work. He kind of told you by accident because voice rec and Stark watches are complicated.
DILF: Wait, how do you know that?
Cuddle Bunny: Next time they do that, just hand over the shield to Melinda.
“And yet you’re conflicted?”
Nomad: How does that answer my question?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed. You are all absolutely fabulous.
“Even though you made a dick pic for your wife.” Tony was rolling his eyes at the ridiculousness of it.
To be continued …
“I thought I would always end up marrying a friend. I guess I was right.”
HSBF: Because somebody tried to kill you less than two months ago.
Nomad: I’m not jealous. That’s Queens?
Okay you’re 15, so you probably have some idea of what I’m planning to do with my boyfriend if Simmons will clear me and she may not because of me saving you.
“This life that we lead as Avengers, isn’t for everyone. It’s hard to be in any type of relationship, including romantic relationships. You need to be someone that gets this life. There’s not many people that do. Clint was lucky and even then there are still problems. Steve gets it. Steve gets him.”
Nomad: I’m telling you to be safe. Remember, I have different standards when it comes to the people I care about.
To: The Mechanic
Me: I’m sure.
Nomad: Will you be allowed to travel by then?
Peter: You should definitely be using the other phone. I am going to send you a message on the other line. This is MJ, by the way.
Red spider: Not all of us can get away with dating a fugitive. Daisy already has enough of an image problem. No need to add to it right now.
“To keep me from killing you later on? Yes. You saw what I did earlier,” Leo responded.
Me: Which is fine because I’ve never been polite. Now he’s talking business. If I find out he’s dating Pepper just for investment reasons, Coulson is going to help me hide the body.
DILF: That wasn’t an excuse not to talk to you. Melinda was trying to figure out how things went wrong, and Simmons was not cooperative at all and it escalated. Deke is not here.
Me: Only because Skye Quake is still on the lamb. Coulson really wants his baby girl back safe and in one piece. The last attempt fell apart and he only found the budding artist who I will just refer to as Sparrow. I think the only reason why my James is still letting him search for her is because he admires his fatherly affection.
“Also, blood tests have shown that you don’t have any of the genetic markers associated with cloning. In addition, you are slightly genetically different than the Leo Fitz that originated from this timeline. But close enough that we do not believe that you are a Hydra agent wearing a nano mask. So therefore we are willing to entertain the possibility that you are from a different timeline.”
From: Pepper_pot
Steve: Fine. I’ll text because I always say the wrong thing when I call him.
“Simmons has agreed to undergo treatment for her drinking problem.”
Counselor Laura: It turns out Flash's previous behavior was a combination of pulling pigtail syndrome and internalized homophobia.
Monkey lover 2: Has Mockingbird met up with the baby bird?
Me: You know I can’t tell you where I am even if I wish I could.
Venom: I hate Stark watches. They’re so sensitive. No more dictating things I don’t actually mean to send.
“You’re going in the right direction, but I think because we're calling out from this side, we need a device from this timeline to anchor us. So you using your phone wouldn’t work.” The Princess explained. That made sense.
