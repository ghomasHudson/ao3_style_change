Mary Winchester would be humming to herself in the kitchen, rearranging the cabinets while fixing dinner, and the angel would lean silently upon the counter and watch Dean read the TV guide upside down to his little brother, the booklet propped on his knees while he pointed out the pictures to show Sam in his high-chair. Sam would babble incoherently or giggle at Dean's words, his fists thumping against the tray set before him, and Mary would coo to her boys and kiss both of their heads before returning to the stove.
"Well, because.. because Sam will have his own angel. I am yours." Castiel explained slowly, choosing his words carefully. Dean was a child. He couldn't know. Not yet, at least.
"Can you make them stop, Cas?" Dean would gulp, his half-dollar-sized hazel eyes gleaming with tears.
"He cannot," Castiel informed, also looking down upon the younger Winchester. "Only you can, Dean."
"No." the archangel says  sternly, his brows drawn together in a scowl. "Your purpose there is at an end. Dean Winchester does not need you anymore. God's plan has been set in motion at last.. It will not be long now."
The angel chuckled, and the noise was so warm, it seemed to brighten the entire room. "I do not know everything, Dean. I know quite a bit, but not all. I am sorry your mother took the cookies back.."
Cas had even been around for when Mary Winchester had brought a second child into the world, another little boy.
It all seemed very strange to Castiel, this idea of spending your life with another, of raising smaller versions of yourselves to go through life just as you had. The fights between Mr. and Mrs. Winchester were made up for in the love they both shared for one another and for their sons, but still, it was rare if Castiel did not spend an evening comforting Dean in his bedroom while Mary and John hashed things out in the living room.
His full name was Castiel, and he had been beside him for as long as Dean could remember.
Having just been reprimanded for trying to sneak dessert before dinner, Dean was curled up on his bed, pouting and glaring at what, to his parents, appeared to be nothing.
"Can you sing to me, Cas?" Dean pleaded, curling up like a cat in his lap. Castiel hummed the tune of Dean's preferred lullaby, a song called
Dean only pouted further and folded his arms around his chest. "You didn't say she was gonna take 'em.. I thought
Six months later, Castiel's mouth is dry as he watches from heaven. He can smell it — the smoke, can feel the heat singe the hairs on his arm. He sees the flames shooting from the threshold of Sam's nursery, sees John Winchester tossing his infant son into the arms of his older boy, barking an order at the four-year-old in his sheer panic, urging Dean to run as fast as he can and get himself and Sam out of their burning house. Mary Winchester is nowhere in sight, Azazel has made sure of that. Castiel shifts his weight to his opposite foot and catches the eye of his brother.
The little boy tried his hardest to maintain his pout, to be as unwavering in his crossed arms as his father always was, but he fell short with a laugh and clambered into the angel's lap before laying his head against his chest.
Castiel watches as Dean runs across his front lawn, Sam clutched to his chest. Fat tears roll over Dean's cheeks as he stares up at his house in flames, and Castiel subconsciously reaches for him.
A broken wail seemed to shatter heaven's walls then and fall upon Castiel's ears, and his alone, penetrating the angel's very being.
Castiel ran his fingers gently through Dean's hair, then cupped his warm cheek, brushing Dean's cheekbone with his thumb.
With that, Sam stepped down and Eileen quickly went to his side.
"Dean?" Cas finally said into the silence that had fallen over them.
Dean woke up in the back seat of the Impala, which was parked in the bunker's garage.
The Impala pulled up just under five hours later, which suggested that Dean had broken at least a few traffic laws.
Cas finally turned to look at him again, his eyes glistening, and whispered, "Do I really have to say it?"
Alex didn't press them, she just stepped back and let them into the house.
"My turn," Sam said, then he also held his brother tightly and whispered in his ear, "Don't you
As they pulled into the driveway, Dean cleared his throat and said, "Who's telling them?"
Cas nodded. "I did. It was the last thing I heard. And I want you to know that it would have been enough. I don't expect anything from you now that I'm back. Whatever you want to give is enough."
Dean threw his arms around Castiel, squeezing tightly. "I'll never move on from this, Cas. You have to know that. I may have to put you in this box today, but it's not gonna be forever. As soon as we have this monster situation handled, I'm coming to get you and we're gonna find a solution."
Dean suspected that they were leaving him and Cas alone in the kitchen on purpose.
"Um," Jody interrupted, "I'm not trying to get in the middle of anything, but Castiel has powers that we could really use out there."
Cas used his grace to clean them up, but they got re-dressed the human way.
"I'm gonna take that as enthusiastic consent," Dean said with a smirk, and began to move again.
Finally, Claire straightened up again and said, "Yeah, I know him. He was just at my house for dinner the other night. Wait, did you just compare me to Dean? I'm insulted."
As Eileen and Cas came up the porch stairs, Dean took a steadying breath and walked over to Claire's body. As tenderly as he could, he moved her over, closer to the edge, so that there would be room to place Kaia.
Now that they were both down to their underwear, Dean leaned back over Cas and slotted their bodies together again. Dean gently, reverently, touched the spot on Cas' abdomen that had been pierced by the Lance of Michael, and rubbed a warm hand over the smooth skin.
And the love.
Cas frowned, but picked up the duffel and went to brush by Dean to get to the door.
Small, a feminine curve to their body, long wavy hair...
The last prayer Castiel ever got from Dean was more of an emotional outburst than actual words. It was sheer terror mixed with the longing that Castiel now associated with himself, when Dean was missing him especially hard.
Just. Gone.
Cas pulled Dean even tighter to him, and Dean used that momentum to push Cas down onto the bed.
It was a shitty motel room, not terribly different than all the others. There were two full-sized beds, ugly green comforters, and one nightstand between them.
He was on his feet so fast that the room spun, but he barreled out the door toward the dungeon, hoping that he wasn't too late.
Sam knew he'd have to have a difficult talk with his brother, eventually, regarding Jack. But for now, they all needed time to mourn.
He sighed again. "Actually, I think I'll shower first. Is that okay with you guys?"
"Thanks, Cas," Sam said, voice thick with unshed tears. "We're gonna go ahead and lower the box now. But I swear that we'll see each other again someday."
After drinking in the sight of his (lover? boyfriend? soulmate?) hunter, he stood and moved silently to the door.
"Well," Dean said, trying to ease some of the tension from his own shoulders, "I figure with you at the wheel, there's no going back for me this time anyway."
Frozen, sitting on the cold concrete floor with his back against an equally cold brick wall, Dean started shaking. He wasn't shaking due to the physical cold of the dungeon slipping through the barrier of his jacket and into his bones. No, this was a chill that seeped into his very soul.
Sam cried for that loss, too.
Cas huffed out a laugh and said, "It's fine, Dean. I'm ready to go."
Dean's smile grew. "Not this time, kid. Death let me go. Apparently, it wasn't my time."
Approaching the group again, Sam said, "Guys, I think we have an even worse problem than we thought."
"Of course," he said. "I'll be here, ready to help if needed."
Sam nodded, then turned to Lizzy and started speaking to her in a soft voice, like she was a spooked animal or something. "You know that ghosts are real, but so are a lot of other things. Vampires, werewolves, demons, angels...but they aren't usually what myths and legends make them out to be."
Lifting one hand to cradle the back of Dean's head, Castiel deepened the kiss, causing Dean to moan in the back of his throat. With his other hand, Cas gripped Dean's hip and pulled their lower bodies together so that they were touching from lips to groin, and he couldn't help the small thrust he gave against the growing bulge in Dean's ratty jeans.
Cas was staring up at him with his mouth hanging open.
Dean turned to him with a strained expression. "You know why, Cas. Revenge and a death wish, all rolled into one."
A slow, sad smile started to bloom across Jack's face.
"On a date?" Dean said, face scrunched up like that was the worst thing he's ever heard, "That sucks."
Sam had tried to be optimistic. Cas was his friend too, but he knew that Dean needed him to be strong in the wake of this loss. Sam thought that if he could just stay positive and convince Dean that Cas could come back, and their mom could come back, and that maybe they could fix this like they always do...he'd start to believe it, too.
When they finally got to the bottom of the stairs, Sam collapsed in Dean's arms.
Cas gave a small shrug and said, "I was. But there are certain benefits to your son being God."
Castiel wept.
"Lizzy!" Dean said over the line, and it sounded like he genuinely knew who the hell she was. "What's going on? Sam's here too, I'm putting you on speaker."
They had, for a brief moment, been as close as they'd ever been to happiness.
; my hunter, my human. If I can't even save you, what good am I?!"
Once she'd collected herself again, Claire whispered, "Okay, it's not a full moon tonight so they should only be able to change if they're purebloods. And I highly doubt this bunch of rednecks are purebloods. I'll go in through the front, and you go around the back and head to the basement to rescue the victims. Hopefully they haven't been bitten, but if they have you'll just have to keep them from eating their first heart so we can try to cure them. Shit, and also somehow get the blood of the sire wolf, which I guess could be any of these idiots. Can you handle two wolves on your own?"
"Anyway," Sam continued, "We hunt monsters and anything else that goes bump in the night. Your Uncle really needs to be put to rest before he becomes dangerous, so that's what the salt and matches are for. You said he was cremated, but do you carry around anything of his? Anything that he could possibly be attached to?"
Cas rolled his eyes and replaced his hand with his mouth again.
Back at the bunker, Sam and Eileen immediately excused themselves to Sam's room, looking as worn down and exhausted as any other two people might look following a funeral for two teenagers who had their whole lives ahead of them, and who were like daughters to them all.
Cas nodded. "It is."
"It's just...you agreed with Sam really quickly," Jack said, guileless as ever.
Suddenly, Patience tensed up and grabbed for the phone.
He looked around, finally deciding that this wasn't a happy memory, so he wasn't in heaven. And he had his car, so he wasn't in hell.
Here we are, at the end of my exploration of The Darkest Timeline.
"Hey, Cas, I'm so glad you're okay," Sam said in one rushed breath. "Dean's been worried about you, you know."
If Jack knew what they were referring to, he didn't let on and continued with his pitch.
Cas gave him a patient smile and said, "All I want is for you to live a long and happy life. I'll stay by your side for as long as you'll allow it. And if you want to get married, I'm not opposed to that."
"I'm fine," Claire said with a reassuring smile. "I'm just tired from the fight. You take the kids out to the main road, or wherever you're parked, and make sure they get home."
choose you, Dean."
Just as Dean opened his mouth to argue, the overhead lights started to rattle and pop. Fuses and generators blew. The entire barn shook like it was about to come down around them.
Castiel sat down on the floor of the dungeon, in the middle of the big devil's trap.
After he'd gotten himself back under control, Dean reached in for the piece of paper laying, neatly folded, on top of Donna's bloody hair.
Lizzy shook her head, then immediately regretted doing that when the vertigo set in. "Fuck," she said, closing her eyes tightly and putting a hand against her forehead.
“Dean,” he groaned, low in the back of his throat, feeling how pleasure was starting to pool in his groin. “Dean, I--” he almost pleaded, reaching up to find something and pull Dean closer. He wanted to kiss him, wanted to touch him, and finally, Dean seemed to respond. Bending forward he leaned in, and there was a gentleness in his touch, his cockiness forgotten for a moment, when he brought both hands to Cas’ shoulders to caress them slowly. His lips were soft when they kissed him, just briefly, tenderly and breathing against Cas’ mouth. Then, he let the tip of his tongue slide against the bow of Cas’ upper lip, sucking on it lightly a moment later. But before Cas could properly catch Dean’s mouth with his own, Dean sat up straight again. Just one hand still rested on Cas’ chest, fingers circling in soothing motions in sync with the circling thrusts of his hips.
“You think I should give this whole Tinder dating thing a go again? Dunno, man, last time we ran into a crossroads demon prostitution ring.” Mild humour. At least, that still worked for him.
No one moved.
is that supposed to...?!"
Sam came back alone to heft Dean into his arms and carry him to his room. As he turned to leave, he took a look back over his shoulder at Castiel and said, "Cas, are you sure about this? We've all been responsible for mistakes and terrible accidents. Me, more than most. I know it looks
"Wow," Dean said, staring up at the barn's dilapidated ceiling. "That sucked."
"It's all good, Cas," Sam said. "I'm just glad you're home."
. I'm thrilled that Cas has his mojo back."
"Holy shit, Cas!" Dean cried out as the angel hollowed his cheeks and pulled off Dean's cock with a pop.
"Dickbags," Dean mumbled under his breath.
-Easier Than Lying, Halsey
After jerking his hips up into nothing for several minutes, Cas finally growled Dean's name between kisses.
Dean's head whipped up to look at Castiel, and there were tears streaming down his face.
"Sorry," she said, "I don't know her. It's Lizzy."
Dean lifted his head and said, "Okay. This is happening. I've got this. Do you want me to prep you, or can you mojo it? Fair warning: I'm not super experienced with prepping someone else."
Castiel pulled away with a gasp as Dean pushed his way inside.
Sam walked over, and Dean could tell when his brother finally realized that something was seriously wrong.
When she was 8, her Uncle suddenly died, and she started seeing him everywhere. He'd move things around the house, but he could be more destructive than that, like when he pulled their mailbox straight out of the ground and threw it into a ditch.
This time, Cas sighed. "Dean, you know how these things go. I can't promise not to almost die, and neither can you. It would be a promise that none of us could keep. Not just the two of us, but also Sam, Mary, or any hunter."
"Cas," Sam said, his voice barely audible as he stared blankly through the windshield, out into the blankness of a back alley at night. "He did it to himself. There was a house full of victims. The ghost of some quack doctor was possessing and murdering people, and they were all stuck there. Tons of people. Some of them were kids."
Eventually, his very human and now fully functional lungs required air, so Dean had to reluctantly pull away.
"I know, Sam," Cas said, "And I love you both for that. Just...try not to let the guilt blind you to more important matters, like the monsters. I've accepted this. What's eternity to an angel?"
No more dying.
Dean pushed in, ever so slowly, because he couldn't stand the thought of hurting Cas again. He had a bad habit of hurting him in other ways, but he desperately wanted to be better. Not just for Cas, but for everyone he loved.
He was determined to do better.
"This one's mine," he said, doing the patented older sibling starfish pose.
Six months had passed before Lizzy called the number on the business card.
Once he was within reach, the angel touched Dean's face, said something under his breath, and then Dean wasn't in pain anymore.
"No," Sam breathed into the phone.
And that was how Sam and Dean lost their kid.
Sam gave them a guilty shrug, but carried on. "Desperate times," he said. "I made them aware of the situation, but despite the fact that the monster threat will definitely outgrow the U.S. and spread across the world, they weren't interested in helping us."
"Dean," Sam said, in his most gentle voice, "We don't have a choice, unless you want Eileen or Cas to squeeze in there."
"You feel so good," he said through clenched teeth.
"Hey," Dean said, trying to sound as upbeat as possible. "This was a no-strings-attached win, so no crying."
"Then it is what it is," Dean said, already knowing that it wasn't what Cas wanted to hear. "No more God, no more miraculous resurrections. Sam and I are just like any other hunter out there now. You think Walt has an angel in his pocket?"
"That could do it," Sam said. "Do you have it with you now?"
Blood still dripped from the blade of Lizzy's machete from the two she'd managed to surprise. Unfortunately, the rest of the nest had gotten away, so she needed backup.
Dean entered, clad in his hot dog pajama pants and his Dead Guy Robe, looking more chipper than he had any right to.
"What?" Sam said in a huff, looking a bit incredulous.
Like, he was there one second, and in the next second there was an empty space where a not-insignificant amount of dude had been.
Dean leaned forward to embrace Cas, resting his chin on the angel's shoulder.
Dean said nothing, just leaned in and placed a feather-light kiss on Castiel's lips.
"Hey," Dean put a hand against Cas' chest to stop him, "Please. Just wait. Let me help you."
With a shrug, Lizzy said, "I have no idea. Dean Winchester?"
"That's true," Cas replied, matter-of-fact.
"Doesn't matter," Dean interrupted. "You know it doesn't matter."
Castiel nodded and looked down, already knowing that Dean was right. That move was right out of the Dean Winchester playbook.
"I'll tend to Kaia," Cas said, throwing open his door and coming around to Dean's side.
"I can imagine," Cas said, offering a hand. Dean reached up and let Cas haul him to his feet.
"What are you guys doing here?" was her first pressing question. "You didn't have to come."
A green light went out.
"I don't think so," she said, shuffling from foot to foot and stretching her arms up over her head.
When she opened her eyes, she was standing in front of a hospital ER entrance, and Cas was no where to be seen.
"He isn't, he was cremated," Lizzy said just as Dean finished hacking through the seatbelt.
Then he touched his lover's forehead, and caught Dean as he slumped forward, fast asleep.
Dean's expression crumbled at the question, and Sam cleared his throat and said, "No, they...stayed behind."
They were so close. Almost home. Dean was almost home.
-Beth Crowley, Warrior
"Sammy," he said over his shoulder, and the tall one with flannel and long hair looked back at him, "Can you brace her while I cut the belt, so she doesn't fall on her head?"
"Uh," Dean said, intelligently. "The light broke. Or the bulb blew. Or something."
!" Dean interrupted, sounding just an angry. Anger he could do. Anger, he understood. "When will you realize that you are worth
Dean frowned slightly and said, "Hang on, I'm not...
He began running his palm up and down Cas' clothed erection, digging in with the heel of his hand just a bit on the way up. His other hand came around to hold Cas' hip firmly to the mattress.
Sam quietly left the room to give them some privacy.
"You were gone," Sam said, quietly. It would have, perhaps, sounded accusatory coming from anyone else, but Sam sounded like he was simply reciting a well known fact. "We saw you die, and we had no idea how to bring you back. We didn't even think it was possible. And then with Jack and everything...there wasn't enough time."
One night, Jody called.
"Yes you
Castiel could see that he was completely losing Dean, so he finally stood and walked as close as he dared.
As Donna sat in her truck, catching her breath, she dialed Jody, but that's not who picked up.
Cas opened his mouth to respond, but in a split second Dean had moved and was in Castiel's arms, hugging the angel desperately.
Once they were back home and safely inside the bunker, Sam turned to the new happy couple and said, "This has been...interesting. I'm super happy for you guys, but I'm exhausted, so I'm going to bed. Just...try not to blow out all of the lights in the bunker."
"Anyway," he continued, "Picture a life where almost everyone you've ever loved is dead. And not only that, most of them are dead because of you. Because they loved you, but you couldn't protect them. I am so fucking tired. I've had to burn the only man who ever treated me the way a real father should treat his kids. I've had to burn an innocent girl that I loved like a sister. A prophet who was
"Yeah," Alex said, not sounding entirely convinced.
And then it was over. Cas was gone, back into the void, and probably back to sleep forever, unless the Empty decided to be petty and hurt him. The thought made Dean want to vomit.
"Okay," Dean said again, before something else occurred to him.
that it made Dean's heart skip a beat.
After that, it was only silence. No more prayers from Dean, or Sam, or anyone.
"Cas," Dean began, looking up, but still fiddling with his bottle. "This last time...I thought that was it, man. You got an angel blade through the back. There were these scorch marks on the ground, and I couldn't...that's insta-death for angels. I've seen it, hell I've
Dean looked down at Cas' lips, then flicked his eyes back up to make eye contact with the angel.
Lizzy nodded.
"Come on, Jack!" Dean called over his shoulder. "When we get back to the bunker, we can celebrate! We'll get you a nice recliner and a big screen TV for your room..."
- Let the Bad Times Roll, The Offspring
With tears blurring his vision, Dean tried to look over Sam's shoulder without dislodging his grieving brother.
Dean was being seriously weird, even for Dean.
"Okay," Castiel found himself saying, "I'll come home."
"Huh," Lizzy said, very eloquently.
Dean hoped that they were dying over and over, painfully, every day, in Purgatory.
Cas chuckled as he rubbed soothing circles on Dean's back.
Popping off again, looking annoyed, Cas said, "What's wrong?"
As the door closed and locked behind them, and Cas began unbuckling his belt, Dean thought that as long as they still had this, as long as they were still
"Yeah?" Dean said, removing his hand and taking a step back to look Cas in the eyes, "I know what an 'advantage' it can be, and I also know that the more you kill, the less you'll be able to control yourself! Cas, I almost killed
Dean didn't think about much else after that.
Dean's head hung down, his hands were clenched into fists, and his eyes were fixed on the filthy carpet when he said, "You almost died today."
Castiel sighed, hugging Dean back just as tightly, breathing in his scent and memorizing the shape of his body for what may be the last time. Castiel was no stranger to desperation, but he had given up entire armies for the man in his arms, so there was no way he was going to stand for more of his self-sacrificing bullshit. It was clear to him that if he could lose control to the point of killing an innocent girl - a friend and fellow hunter - he could and would lose control until he eventually killed everyone he'd ever loved. Including Dean.
"Cas," Dean said, "You can't do that. That much killing...you'll lose it. I know you will. I've been there. Promise me you won't."
Finally, Dean answered, "I accept."
do that again."
"Jack, there is...something I want to ask of you. And I'm sorry, I know you don't wish to interfere with Earth, but it's important to me."
Dean clutched at the angel's dark hair, and Cas moaned around his cock, sending shockwaves through Dean.
He was interrupted by the sound of a key card in the lock.
Lizzy thought about it for a moment. "Well, he gave me five gold dollar coins when I turned five, and I carry one around for luck."
Baltimore was full of gross, abandoned warehouses and factories. This one just happened to be hiding some vampires.
The bloodbath wasn't even the worst of it. Twenty vamps against the four of them, plus Cas having the Mark? Not great odds, but certainly manageable. They all survived to tell the tale.
Jack nodded again, and gave Dean a small smile.
It ends in a vacuum.
Castiel studied the map table, hyper-focused on the four green blips that represented Dean, Sam, Eileen, and Alex.
When Dean had the Mark of Cain, it sucked. It sucked donkey balls. Now, in retrospect, he knew that a lot of it was on him. If he hadn't been so angry all the time, if he hadn't been so weak, maybe he could have lived with it for as long as Cain himself.
Castiel blinked rapidly, staring out through his windshield at nothing. He'd just seen Donna not too long ago. How could she be gone?
Dean tried to plead with his eyes:
He had to stop again to collect his thoughts, but he held Cas' eyes this time.
Billie shrugged, which only seemed to anger Dean more.
As he climbed into his truck, he felt a flicker of guilt. He'd promised Dean that he wouldn't do this. But then he remembered the look of peace on Dean's sleeping face, and his mind was made up.
"Thank you," Jack said, and began to wave again as if to say goodbye.
When he pulled back, Cas was looking at him like he was the most amazing thing in all of creation.
A long table, at least long enough for Jody, Donna, and all the girls to eat together, was set up in the center. On that table lay a small human-sized lump, covered with a white cloth.
Once Claire stopped talking and looked to Lizzy for confirmation, Lizzy knew that her mouth was hanging open and that she probably looked like an idiot.
"Wrong," said Claire. "There are six. Two of them are in the basement with the victims. Did you even stake this place out first?"
"Oh, nothing," Donna said. "Just checking up on her, and you and Patience, too."
. And because of me, because I constantly expected him to fix my problems even after he'd already
"You're taking this surprisingly well," Billie said, her tone taking on a serious edge. In Dean's opinion, everything she said sounded half sarcastic and half like the most important thing in the universe, but he supposed that could actually be the case with her being Death and all.
Which was fine. Really.
of me. He was always desperate to come back with a win
"Good," Dean said. "Because I want to give everything."
But, from Dean's perspective, it ends in neither.
"We need him to get rid of Michael, and then we need to do whatever it takes to get Jack close to him," Sam whispered under the cover of darkness, deep down in the warded dungeon where Cas had died.
"I doubt that, Sunshine," he said. "Although, we've had some close calls lately, so I'd better make sure you don't die."
Lizzy didn't open her eyes, but she heard Dean say, "We'll look for it. Cas, can you take her to the nearest hospital?"
Dean started violently shaking his head, "No, Cas. No. You have always been the best of those sons of bitches."
Dean's jaw dropped. "Will I be your what now?"
"Whoa," Sam said, as he walked into the room and let the door close behind him. "Why's it so dark in here?"
Castiel tried to keep his voice steady as he said, "I can't do that, Dean. I did do this. I didn't mean to, but it happened anyway."
"Cas!" she exclaimed and practically jumped on the angel, wrapping her arms around his shoulders from behind.
Dean pulled away, minutely, but left his hands on Castiel's arms.
Cas signed back.
"Yeah, no problem," the guy called Sammy said, and also stomped over.
she signed. Sam nodded.
"Werewolves. But there's more. The monsters are working together now. Wolves, vamps, shifters...all of them. And they're gunning for hunters. We're no longer a clean-up crew, man. We have to go on the offensive."
Dean moved his other hand up to his hair as he began pacing, and Castiel feared that the love of his life was about to have a full nervous breakdown. He'd seen Dean's soul in hell, after decades on the rack, and he'd swear that this was worse.
"How?" Castiel asked, trying to ignore the throbbing of the Mark.
"What is it?" Jack asked, though Dean got the feeling he already knew.
That last bit made Castiel smile.
Claire shrugged. "I mean, only for an hour or so. The change took longer than that, but I only completely wolfed out for about an hour. I fought Sam and Dean, but they managed to get the cure into me anyway."
Castiel, with his river eyes; just as blue and just as deep.
"Donna, I'm going to have to call you back," Sam said in a rush, hanging up.
It's just that he had no way of knowing whether or not Cas was interested, since they were best friends, and Cas was an angel. He knew that angels could want human things, he'd have to be an idiot to not realize that by now, but that didn't mean that this particular angel wanted
Eileen got out next, and slammed her door closed just a little too hard.
After a long moment of silence, Castiel finally said, "How is Jack?"
He had to kill
"Cas!" Dean called, but took off after him when there was no reply.
"Other angels can kill you, and we literally just met a human who can use angel magic. So, for all we know, she could have smited you without any weapon at all."
"Yes, it's me," Castiel said again, his eyebrows drawing together in concern as he tried to fight down a tightening in his chest. Sam was acting very strangely, and that usually meant something terrible had happened.
It was tentative, and Cas hated that. He never wanted Dean to question his feelings ever again.
And Castiel was well aware of what silence meant.
"Okay, okay," Sam said, taking a step back. "We can fix this. Just stay with me and I'll call 911, and then grab the first aid kit, and then pray to Jack. Or maybe I should pray to Jack first..."
Castiel swallowed around his own tears and said, "I know, Dean. I wanted forever with you. But maybe I'm cursed, maybe I was never going to get a happy ending. Maybe I rebelled too many times. Naomi once said that I was defective. That I 'came off the line with a crack in my chassis,' and maybe she was right."
Cas finally nodded, and Dean leaned in to give him a slow, passionate kiss.
After a beat of silence, Dean said, "So when I croak, I go up to Heaven 4.0 and just help you with Heaven Business? That's it?"
Lizzy and Claire stumbled out of the house covered in blood, but with the two young victims unbitten and secured.
Castiel huffed a laugh at that and said, "I'll love you just the same."
She'd explain everything to the Winchesters, in due time. She got the feeling that she probably shouldn't be solo-hunting, and that she might get an earful about it when they got there, but she couldn't just sit idly by when she knew the truth of things!
Billie looked back at him, over her shoulder, expression devoid of any feeling.
Dean was unable to completely stamp down the fear rising in his chest. Living to middle-age (barely) always waiting for the other shoe to drop will do that to a person.
"Sam," he said. "Where's Dean?"
"So do I," Dean said, stilling long enough to press a kiss to the side of Cas' head, "But it has to be done, and we're the only ones who can do it. You know that. The civilians out there are sitting ducks without us."
Dean had been traumatized in his life more times than he could possibly say, but as he sat on the floor and cried, he had the errant thought that this was probably going to be the thing that finally killed him.
Dean frowned. "What?"
With one last look over her shoulder at Claire, Lizzy exited the woods and took the kids to her car.
He skidded to a halt just outside the open door to the dungeon, and saw Castiel stepping into the Ma'lak box that he'd insisted Dean make in case this happened.
Cas didn't stroll in calmly, like the first time they met. This time, there was quite a bit more urgency in his step.
He heard Cas chuckle a bit at that before saying, "You Winchesters, and your family, and the family we made...you're the best of them. As long as there's a Winchester alive, there's still hope."
"Hello," Jack said, raising his hand in a shy wave, as if he wasn't actually the most powerful cosmic being in existence..
got killed on my watch. I've had friends that I couldn't even burn, because there wasn't enough of them left for a pyre. And now I've had to burn my...Cas."
Sam gave a noncommittal shrug. "About how you'd expect."
What little color that had remained in his face after the ordeals of the day drained completely away, leaving him ashen.
Sam huffed a small laugh at that and said, "I have no idea. Eternity sounds impossible, but then again I'm only human."
It wasn't long before Cas pulled away again, just enough to speak. Dean watched the angel's eyes, saw the hope and the fear and the desire.
Claire made a flippant gesture with her hand and said, "I can take care of myself. They're the priority. Get them back to their parents."
"You're awesome too, Dean," he said with complete sincerity. It made Dean's heart ache.
"Agent Page," a deep voice answered after only two rings.
Dean and Cas watched them go.
Cas turned back to Dean and said, "Yes, Jack didn't just leave the Empty with me. He also bargained for Gabriel, Balthazar, Gadreel, and Anna."
In her rearview mirror, she counted four wolves coming up from behind her truck, which meant that there were at least two more hiding somewhere.
Lizzy calculated it in her head and said, "It's been about16 years now."
Castiel's face softened at that. "You're right," he said. "I'm sorry, Dean. But the sooner we get this over with, the faster we can move on from it."
"Sam," Dean said, trying to take a full breath. "Sam. There's something in my back."
They stood there for a while, Dean's fists full of trenchcoat, and they didn't even notice when Sam quietly left.
Clearing his throat, Sam said to the room, "You all have your teams and your maps. Let's be ready to head out in one hour. Thanks, everyone."
Deciding that he'd teased enough, Dean reached down and placed his palm flat against the bulge in Cas' pants.
"Jody's in the kitchen," she said. "She hasn't left this whole time, and she won't let me or Patience see what's in the box."
Billie stared at him, silently, for a long time. Dean fought the urge to fidget under her gaze, even though it felt like she was sizing him up somehow.
When Jody got home, Patience called from her room, "There's a package for you on the kitchen table!"
There was so much that Dean would have missed about Cas, if he hadn't made it. Everything from his messy dark hair, the sky blue of his eyes, his stupid trenchcoat (the current one was particularly hideous), and his ugly tie. The way he stood a little too close, and stared a little too hard. All of the times he made them all laugh without really meaning to, although Dean suspected that sometimes it was on purpose, just to get a rise out of them.
Whether it was the silly pet name, or just the simple demand, Dean didn't know. What he did know was that Cas' eyes flashed the bright silver-blue of his grace, and he made a keening sound that was reminiscent of his true voice as he came between their bodies.
Castiel honest-to-Chuck smirked at him.
"So what do you say, Dean?" Jack asked, big blue eyes wide with hope.
Cas had squeezed his beer bottle so hard that it had shattered right in his hand.
When it buzzed again for the third time, something definitely seemed off. He grabbed his phone from his coat pocket and looked at the caller I.D.
Castiel pulled back, though still only inches from Dean, and scowled.
"I know, Cas," Dean said, so quietly that the other humans in the room probably couldn't hear him, "It sucks, but it's for the best. You're getting worse. I don't know what I'd do if you went full black eyes on me, man."
"Yes," Cas said, very seriously, as if he were responding to the most important directive ever given to him.
Dean gave him a squeeze and said, "You have nothing to be sorry for. You weren't there, and you couldn't have known what would happen. This was all on me."
Cas' cock was hard and hot against Dean, so Dean made sure they lined up as he pushed his weight down, which elicited a strangled sound from the angel.
"He's a good kid. He's...confused. I've done the best that I can with him so far, but after you died, Dean was...hard on him."
When Dean finally bottomed out, he stayed still to get a grip on himself. He was breathing heavily and was slick with sweat.
"What's really interesting," Billie went on, "Is that amidst all of these variables, not a single one of these books says you die today."
Castiel paced.
Green eyes narrowed at that, and Dean reached up to grab Cas' left shoulder, which he squeezed just a bit too tight. It was the same shoulder where Cas had once gripped Dean, so long ago, and raised him from perdition.
It was late, and they were a few drinks deep when Sam bid them goodnight.
Dean's gaze flicked down to the body as his feet, a few feet inside the doorway.
Cas raised a shaking hand to the dots as they slowly got closer to the bunker. Just a little more, and everyone left would be back safe.
Dean woke up in his own bed, disoriented and vaguely lightheaded. His first thought was that Cas wasn't with him. His second thought was the memory of what had transpired earlier.
Dean threw Castiel a worried glance, but Castiel just shook his head.
Taking a single step closer, Billie said, "When I became Death, it came with more than just the burdens you'd expect. It made me aware of a bigger picture. It gave me clarity. Unfortunately, you and your brother are important. You have work to do."
He let Dean go to voicemail again. He knew that he'd have to face the man he loved sooner or later, but Dean had to understand that this was important. What Castiel was doing was important, because he was making the world safer. For Dean, for their broken little family, and for all humans.
"Cas," he said, quietly, "I need you to know that it's not only Dean who hates this. You're my best friend, and if we can figure out how to remove the Mark someday, you'd better believe we're coming back for you."
Castiel gave Dean a small smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Of course, Dean."
Claire slapped a hand over her own mouth again, to cover whatever noise she was about to make. She slowly removed it before saying, very quietly, "Yeah, you could say that."
Dean got right up in his angel's face, brow furrowed and eyes angry. "You don't get to make that decision for me. There's been too much of that over the years, and it stops now. I hate this, and it hurts like hell, but I deserve the chance to say goodbye."
After criss-crossing multiple states, Jody, Alex, and Patience had made their way back to Kansas around the same time that Walt and Krissy Chambers arrived. Bobby, Charlie, Stevie, and a number of other hunters from Apocalypse World had helped to spread the word and had rolled in the night before, and Max and Alicia Banes had just arrived that morning.
With a sigh, Sam continued, "All we can do now is launch a siege against the largest congregations of monsters that we've come across. Take the fight to them." Sam held up his copy of the sheet that had been passed around. "On this sheet, you will see color-coded areas. We'll be separating into teams, with each team assigned an area by color. We're going in heavily armed with every weapon we could possibly need, as well as body cams and satellite phones."
Short Hair (Dean) stopped cutting and whipped his head up.
Sam watched him go, and knew deep down that his brother had been irrevocably damaged. He didn't look like the same man who always said he wanted to "go out swinging." He looked like a broken man who had given up.
"That does sound like our kinda thing," she heard Sam say.
Dean squared his shoulders and replied a bit defensively,  "Well, maybe I'm just being more optimistic than usual."
"Bed," Cas growled, and Dean let himself be manhandled to their room.
"Dean," was all he said, and that was more than enough.
Dean felt Cas' warm hand on his left cheek, and then he could suddenly breathe again. He took a shallow breath, then a more full one, and rolled himself onto his back.
Dean felt his jaw lock before he even consciously tensed up at the question.
"Goodbye, Dean."
Dean made his way quietly from the garage into the main area of the bunker, but paused just outside the library when he heard several raised voices.
Castiel was the one to break the silence.
A genuine laugh punched itself out of Lizzy. "Men in Black. Nice."
All of their heads jerked up simultaneously to the figure bolted to the door.
She poured some lighter fluid on the bodies of the two vampires, then struck a match.
It took a second for Dean to realize what he'd just said, and a flush turned the skin under his freckles pink.
"I know," Sam said, raising a placating hand, "But you have to understand that this is for the best. Cas can still give us plenty of help from here. He's memorized most of these lore books, so I'd definitely count on him for information in a pinch."
Dean was quiet when he answered, "Sure, Cas. I'll be right there."
With a sigh, Lizzy said, "Not as much anymore, but he tends to hang out if something is wrong, or if I'm getting too cozy with a date. He only had sons, so I was kind of a daughter to him."
Around the time that Lizzy stood in the library, clutching a news article about that shooting in her shaking hands, is when she also learned that there was a name for what she was: a medium.
Claire didn't reply, so Lizzy took the kids by their hands and said, "Come on, your parents have been looking for you."
"Cas?" Sam finally said, choking on the word. He sounded close to tears.
"Jack! What are you doing on Earth?"
Cas turned towards her and gave her an even bigger smile. Eileen quickly signed
Cas held a finger to his lips to shush them.
like someone who had just been impaled, and not in the fun way.
"Yeah?" Claire said, smiling now. "Anyone I would know?"
Lizzy looked between Claire and the two young children, a brother and sister, who were obviously traumatized.
"I know," Cas interrupted. "I want to. I want the normal, human life that we can have together."
Reluctantly pulling away just far enough to look into Cas' eyes, Dean said, "Did you hear what I said, before The Empty took you?"
And then he was gone.
Patience's eyes had been burned out of their sockets. A textbook smiting.
The brothers looked at each other, nodded, then walked straight into the kitchen.
"Dean," Cas said, keeping his tone neutral, "Be reasonable. They'll know that a monster didn't do this. These are accomplished hunters with years of experience, and some of them are experts on angel damage."
A torso with what looked like its heart ripped out, some limbs that looked like they'd been chewed on by animals, and no head to be found anywhere.
Patience came running and immediately saw Jody sitting on the kitchen floor, a hand over her mouth, and tears running down her face.
Castiel's head whipped up from where he'd been sitting, perched on the edge of the bed closest to the door, reading something on Sam's tablet.
They were back.
Donna always tried to remain upbeat and positive. But dang it, it was getting harder all the time.
Dean shrugged and said, "If I was all that in love with being alive, I wouldn't have tried the temporary death trick that got me into the veil in the first place."
A couple of minutes later, Lizzy's "brothers" were crowded around her.
They both stopped and looked at each other, smiling.
"Donna," Sam whispered back. "They can't find Kaia."
When Castiel got sent to Dean's voicemail, on all three of his phones, for the fifth time, he slammed down the payphone's receiver and retrieved his quarter.
"Dean!" Castiel said, an edge of anger in his voice. "Don't you ever say that! Don't do that! I'm not worth..."
"I don't exactly need seven archangels since that was something Chuck made up on a whim, but I wanted to include those who meant well in life and deserved better than they got. I'll ask Sam closer to his time. As for you, Dean, I need someone who will be completely honest with me, even if it's hard. Castiel is too protective, and the others don't really know me yet."
"Sammy," Dean gasped. "It feels like this thing is the only thing holding me together."
"Right," Dean said, getting back to the seatbelt.
Sam huffed a laugh at that. "Actually, he's a young adult."
"Jody?" Sam whispered into the phone.
Now there were only three dead werewolves, and at least twice that hot on her trail.
Lizzy had been 5 years old when that happened, and couldn't have possibly known about it.
"Dean," he said, and Lizzy thought it was weird that in the very short time she'd been around these people, Cas seemed to always defer to Dean. "I have the salt and matches, and I brought the shotgun and rock salt ammunition."
Cas always looked at Dean in a way that Dean knew he didn't deserve. A man like him shouldn't be anything to an angel. Cas made mistakes, sure, but his heart was always in the right place. More importantly, he was powerful and ancient, and Dean should have been about as important as an ant to a being like Cas.
"Listen, Cas," Dean continued, looking back up and holding Cas' eyes. "It was seriously just luck that the Lance of Michael didn't poof you out of existence, the way it would a demon. It bought us some time, but only a handful of minutes. If it wasn't for Crowley, who just
Eileen wasn't around, but then Dean saw her and Cas coming around the back, carrying Kaia.
Without looking away from Patience's body, Dean said, "Then we say it was an accident with an angel blade. Or...or losing Alex was too much and made her go crazy, so she did this to herself."
That was when Castiel, former angel of the Lord, a thorn in the side of God himself, started openly weeping.
Castiel's intake of breath at that was audible. Yet, he hated himself just a bit more due to his secondary thought, the thought that rang out over the initial grief, which was
Sam looked at his brother blearily and opened his mouth to comment, but shut it again when Cas followed after Dean, like a trenchcoated shadow.
In the blink of an eye, Cas had flipped them.
Closing his eyes against the onslaught of grief and fear, Dean said, "It's happening."
Jack was feeling a bit tired from all of the excitement (and bacon cheeseburgers) so he announced that he would also go get a bit of sleep.
As she walked away, she started in on the speech she gave to everyone she managed to save, especially young people, about how they should
Cas looked down at their feet for a few seconds, then looked back up at Dean. "I promise," he said. "I will protect Patience with my own life. But, Dean, if you don't come back...," he paused, and his eyes flitted to the wall behind Dean's head. He looked unfocused as he absently touched the Mark hidden underneath all of his layers before continuing, "...I don't know what I'll do."
It was Alex who opened the door for them.
They'd done it. They'd played one last Hail Mary and defeated Chuck for good.
More crashing and twigs breaking, and then suddenly she was looking upside-down at three white dudes. Two were wearing torn up jeans and flannel, and one was wearing a suit and a fucking trenchcoat. They all had on way too many layers for a muggy summer night, in her opinion.
He choked a bit on the nickname, which made Castiel smile with a happiness that was rare for him. Dean wanted to see it all the time.
Sam, Eileen, and Dean had all been sitting around looking for cases, but Dean had dozed off, so they'd just decided to make it a movie night instead. Cas brought in a bottle of beer for everyone, and Eileen said she was going to go make some popcorn.
"Cas!" he bellowed, causing Castiel's head to shoot up and make eye contact with him.
"Dean," he said again, his favorite word in all of the languages in all of Creation, "I don't even trust myself to hold you right now. What if I did this to you? I can't control it anymore. I'm so sorry, I know I'm letting you down, but the others have to know about Patience, and I have to be held accountable. I can't die while I have the Mark, so you know the plan. It's time."
Placing Dean gently on the floor, Castiel made his way back to his abandoned phone and dialed Sam.
Sam finally opened the door, the creak of the hinges familiar in a situation which was steadily barreling toward wrongness.
"Team Green!" she said again, "On your left, a hoard of vampires incoming! Please respond!"
He opened his mouth to let out a litany of verbal abuse towards Death, God, Heaven, basically everything he could think of, but Billie started speaking again before he could.
to know the one thing we needed to know to break that spell and cure you, I'd be burning you on a pyre right now. And I can't, man. I just can't."
"You should listen to the kid and stop yelling," Dean said, a fond smile on his face. "It's not that serious."
Tilting his head in a move that made him look just like Castiel, Jack waited for the angel to continue.
"Uh," Lizzy said, "I'm Lizzy. Why, who the hell are you?"
"Maybe I hit my head harder than I thought," Lizzy mumbled to herself. Then her brain caught up and she said, louder, "Wait, what ghost supplies?"
The barn doors flew open, and a very familiar silhouette appeared.
Sam gave him an epic Bitchface.
He did pause in front of what they now knew to be Kaia. He tenderly reached up and pulled the bolts from her hands, letting her weight fall onto him as he freed her from the rest. Then he pulled her the rest of the way down, and laid her gently on the ground.
He turned to look at Dean, who finally looked up from his precious caffeine and gave Cas a warm grin.
Cas sighed. "I don't know what water fowl have to do with this, Dean. I'm much more concerned about your safety. What if something happens to you and I'm not there to heal you?"
"About that," Billie said, "I know you've done that little trick before. It's here in one of your books. There are so very many ways for you to die, and they appear in writing whether the death sticks or not. So tell me, you've fought so hard and for so long, what's changed?"
"Dean," was all the angel said, before closing the minimal distance between them and pulling Dean into a tight hug. Dean hugged him back, just as fiercely, his hands fisting in the angel's terrible trenchcoat. They must have stayed like that for a while, because Sam cleared his throat, which finally made them pull apart.
"Good," Dean said. "Now that we've established that...who wants burgers?"
Sam went on, somewhat rushed, as if he now had to get the story out in one go.
Turning to face Dean, with a hundred-watt smile on his face, Jack said, "Dean Winchester, when your time on Earth is over, will you be one of my archangels?"
Dean had to push it down so far that it choked him. The pounding of his heart didn't matter. The bile trying to bubble up in his throat didn't matter. The only thing that he could allow to matter was any plan at all that would help them defeat Chuck.
Soon, someone would come looking for him.
become hunters.
Dean nodded, feeling heat rise all the way up to his ears. He knew if he opened his mouth he might start crying, and that wasn't cool.
He immediately took one step back and covered his mouth with his hand.
This time, there was no one left to kill. Lucifer was already gone.
"A person is smart," Dean said. "People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it."
It rang so many times that he feared he was about to go to Sam's voicemail, as well, but he finally heard a click and then Sam's gruff voice.
Dean's reverie was broken when Cas said, voice deeper than usual, "I'm ready."
Dean swallowed thickly, shoved his despair so far down that he couldn't recognize it anymore, then continued.
And wait.
Grabbing her biggest silver knife and slipping it into her boot, she climbed out of the truck to face the pack head-on...
"Well," Lizzy said, presumably to both brothers, "It's not a ghost, but a friend of mine in Baltimore is really worried about his sister. There's been a rise in disappearances in and around their neighborhood over the past two months, but they've only ever found one person so far, and he was already dead. Throat ripped out, the cops said by an animal, but the body was completely drained of blood. I thought...maybe it sounds like your kind of thing?"
Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Eileen had all gone to Brookings together. After they took out the nest, they were going to reconvene at Jody's for Claire's funeral. Jody was beside herself, so they'd been able to convince her to stay home with her other girls. They'd heard that Alex was a mess, too. They needed to be together right now.
"There's something in my back," Dean repeated.
Dean nodded and looked down at his beer bottle, peeling the label to give his hands something to do.
That's when he saw Jack.
The bunker was a bit overwhelming in size, so they'd been known to call each other's phones rather than walk up and down each hallway, yelling. When Castiel's phone rang, he knew it was time. Pulling it out of his pocket, he let out a relieved breath when he saw the caller I.D.
giggle at Cas' fuckstruck expression.
Billie didn't dignify that with a response, she simply continued, looking up at the towering shelves of Dean Winchester's deaths. "You're dead now, of course, but this is not one of the ways it's supposed to happen. That's not too unusual for you Winchesters, and even Winchester-adjacent folks don't always die the way they're supposed to. Yet, here we are."
"You almost did," Dean said. "I can't even tell you how much that hurt, man. And I can't believe I almost bit it taking out a vampire nest. This was basically a milk run!"
in that trunk, not to mention other monsters (or parts of monsters) so he was adamant that there was no way it was happening.
"Ew, Gadreel?" Dean said with a grimace. "And Anna? Nice girl, er, angel. But I hope that won't be weird."
"Dean," he said, "I don't wish to ruin the moment, but won't Sam be back soon?"
He considered, momentarily, that his conversation with Billie was just a dream. But no, it had felt too real. He also doubted he would have dreamed up Billie as the new Death.
"Sam," Cas looked surprised to see him. "How are you?"
Castiel nodded. He heard what Sam was saying, but he didn't think he was fully processing it. He felt numb. He felt more empty than The Empty.
Dean removed his hand from the angel's cock and sat up, still straddling Cas' hips, to pull his flannel and t-shirt off and fling them somewhere.
"Cas is dead. For real dead. Not-coming-back-this-time dead. I couldn't protect him, after everything he'd done for us. For me, personally. I couldn't even protect my own mom. Fucking
Castiel was at her side in an instant.
Sam smiled slightly, but it didn't reach his eyes.
"Actually, Cas," Sam said, sounding pained, "Dean isn't the reason I'm calling. I mean, yeah, he misses you and wishes you would come home, but something else has happened, and you need to know."
"What?" Dean asked, fidgeting a bit under their stares.
Sam gave a sigh of relief and said, "Thank you, Cas."
Suddenly, the events of the previous day came back to her.
"Sam," Dean interrupted, "Forget it. It's too late. Just let me go."
you!"
"You still haven't answered my question," Billie reminded him, though her voice was soft and surprisingly void of judgement.
When the angel seemed like he'd never move again, Sam took him gently by the arm and led him to the passenger side of the car. Castiel made no protest as Sam sat him down in the seat and closed the door. He walked around the car and slid into the driver's seat.
"Well, we both want Sam and Dean to live happy lives here on Earth. It'll be easier for Sam, because he's stopped hunting before, and he has a human lover. Dean, on the other hand...it's just a bit more complicated."
For the first time ever, goodbye didn't hurt.
"Cas!" Dean manages to say as Castiel shoves him roughly up against his own bedroom door, the nickname punched out of him as he made contact.
"You're not just any hunter," is what he finally settled on.
Castiel watched him, noting how Dean's face would go slack and look almost peaceful in sleep. It made him look younger, and Castiel wanted nothing more than for Dean to be able to wear that expression permanently. He deserved to live in a world that was safe from monsters like the ones who had killed so many people they loved.
When Lizzy looked over, the man called Cas was gone.
They sat in silence for another several minutes.
In the blink of an eye, Castiel went from post-hunt adrenaline to the sinking sensation of fear.
"Thanks, Dean," Sam said. "I'm going to go lay down for a bit."
"It was just supposed to be a small nest," she went on, as if Sam hadn't spoken. "Three vamps, tops. Claire and I went in armed to the teeth, but there were so. many. more."
Cas and Patience were no longer in the war room, which was kind of weird. But he'd worry about it later, when the grief wasn't so fresh. He was honestly surprised that they were holding it together as well as they were. Sobbing and dissociating notwithstanding.
Sam immediately threw his arms around his brother, crushing him to his chest. Dean hugged back just as fiercely.
Cas looked a bit haughty as he said, "Jealousy is beneath me. It's not about who had you first, it's who has you now."
Dean sighed and turned to the tallest of the three. "Sam, do you wanna give her the talk? She already knows about ghosts."
He knew his brother better than anyone, so he knew who Dean would blame. There was no where else for his fury to go. If Jack hadn't already proven to be basically indestructible, he'd be in grave danger.
"Wait!" Cas yelled, making Jack stop mid-wave.
when I had the Mark, and I
"FUCK! Cas, I don't have lube. For...me. Myself. To help. With the sex."
"Yup," Claire said, popping the 'p' and suddenly dropping to sit on the damp leaves surrounding them.
"So where does that leave us?" Dean asked. His eyes flicked down to Castiel's lips, then back up to his eyes so quickly that he wasn't completely aware that he'd done it.
"Dean," Cas began, in a tone more gentle than usual, "I'm actually safer than most. I can usually heal myself, and others; and even when I can't, there's still a good chance I'll pull through. I'm not without my grace, you know."
In front of them was a rusted industrial garage door, and something human-shaped was attached to it by what looked like huge bolts through the body's hands, which were raised above their lolling head. There were also bolts in their shoulders and thighs. Blood poured from the body, but they couldn't see from where. It flowed down from the back of the body, down the door, and onto the asphalt where they stood.
"Dean," he said, as gently as he'd ever said the other man's name, "An angel blade wouldn't do this to a human. To humans, it's just a big knife. It leaves a stab wound, and that's it. You know that."
"Okay," Alex said. "Thanks for calling, Donna. Stay safe."
"If I hadn't convinced Cas to help us, to help
"Don't worry," Dean chimed in, "Text us the address, and we'll take care of it."
Charlie had plopped down into a leather armchair and was staring off into the distance. She hadn't said a single word since they'd all regrouped on the road back to the bunker. Bobby had whispered that Charlie was thinking about dating again, because of how much she'd liked Stevie.
"Please don't make me do this, Cas," he said, his voice thick with emotion, "Please don't make me lose you, too."
"Hi, guys," Jody said, subdued, from her place on the floor. Her back was against the cupboards, and her face was streaked with tears.
?! That you're the best of them?!"
The only difference between this room and many of the others was the absence of one younger brother, and the presence of one moping, fallen Angel of the Lord.
They had time. Cas planned to stay.
Dean gaped at him before saying, "It was more than adequate. Where the hell did you learn to do that?"
The room was now completely dark, except for some outside light finding its way past some cracks in the closed curtains. It was also silent, outside of Dean's panting breaths, which were starting to come back down to normal.
"Whoa whoa whoa!" Lizzy interjected, taking a step back from the men and putting her hands up in defense, "Why does anyone need a shotgun or matches right now?!"
They would deal with it when all of the hunters came back.
What is eternity to an angel?
"Jody, Walt, Bobby, and Krissy will be team Blue. Charlie, Stevie, Alicia, and Max will be team Yellow, with Max able to provide some magical back-up if needed. Dean, Eileen, Alex, and myself will be team Green. The rest of you are team Orange. Patience, I'd like you to stay here and concentrate on any visions that might help us. Cas will stay with you to protect you."
Castiel just continued to stare at Sam until the hunter let out another small laugh and started the car.  "Come on, time for you to meet your kid."
He stepped out, and closed the distance between himself and Castiel.
Castiel sighed, "Yes, I am aware. I'm sorry, I hope he knows that I would be there by his side if I could."
There was a huge wolfpack that popped up in Stillwater, and it took all of the pull she had to keep her officers out of it. They still didn't understand why, so there was a little bit of broken trust.
Dean looked at him in alarm and whispered, "Who was on the phone?"
When his lips landed on Cas', the angel didn't immediately kiss him back. He seemed frozen, just for a moment, before he registered what was happening. When he finally started moving his lips against Dean's, it was the eruption of a decade's worth of silent pining and unresolved sexual tension.
So with Kaia in the trunk, they made their way to Jody's in complete silence.
. But an angel blade through the heart, Cas."
"Hey Cas!" he yelled to Trenchcoat Guy, "Can you go up to the car and grab the ghost supplies from the trunk?"
Dean glared at her, jaw clenched, fists at his sides, but said nothing.
Jack grinned at him and said, "Of course, if that's what you really want."
"My purse," she managed to say through clenched teeth, "It would be in my purse, but I lost it in the crash."
Sam shook his head, eyes unfocused. "It's never too late..."
"I'm in the dungeon," is what he finally said. "I need you to come down here. I...I need to show you something."
Maybe it came across like a prayer, Dean didn't know for sure. But in the next moment, Cas closed the minor distance between them and pressed their lips together.
"Me too, Cas!" he yelled over the maelstrom of silence.
Claire laughed easily, which was strange because she didn't seem like a laughing-with-a-stranger kind of person, but what the hell did Lizzy know?
Dean swallowed thickly. His brain seemed to be stuck on the word
Sam looked over at Jack.
Dean really hoped that they were in heaven together, not just reliving their greatest hits.
Castiel ended the call and started the engine.
Dean raised his head to look at Cas, and saw an expression that he, himself, had once worn. He loosened his grip on Cas' trenchcoat and moved to place them on either side of the angel's face.
One of Donna's deputies found her.
Donna sighed and closed her eyes. This had been a stupid idea. Why would Jody want to go on a hunt, so soon after losing Claire and Kaia?
Claire, surprisingly, laughed.
"Yeah, I know. But. Like. You're an
"Tuesday," said the nurse. "You've been sleeping for about 16 hours."
Cas' lips turned up at the corners, ever so slightly. "I believe the word you are looking for is 'smote.' She could have smote me without any weapon at all."
Cas shrugged, looking more human than ever.
Lizzy bristled at that and whisper-yelled, "What do you think I'm doing?!"
Cas tilted his head and squinted at Dean. Dean fought the urge to look away.
It was the most beautiful thing Dean had ever seen.
"They say things about us. They call me your attack dog, or your slave, or your bitch. Sometimes they mean you Winchesters, plural, but more often than not they just mean you."
"WHAT?!" snapped Dean, Eileen, Jody, Castiel, and Walt.
Lizzy watched with trepidation. Was this woman insane?
Sam will never know what was said. It's not for him to know, unless his brother wants to confide in him, which he won't. So just after sunset, with the sky holding the last remnants of orange and pink, as Dean turned and walked back to the bunker without a word to anyone, Sam walked over and crouched down next to the box.
Her truck was somehow still running, but other than the usual cache of weapons she carried around for work or deer hunting, there was nothing. Also, no one could find her cellphone.
Everyone in the bunker was silent, until the sound of glass breaking startled Sam and Dean.
died for us, and even though I didn't know his plan, I still should have been able to stop him. To find another way. Because that's what we do, right? We fight, and we bleed, and we find another way. A better way. We were barely even friends and he still..."
He paused, and Dean could see his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed. Dean didn't dare breathe.
They hadn't had a double funeral since Cas and Kelly.
Cas barked a laugh like it had been punched out of him, and Dean couldn't resist kissing him again.
"Team Green!" He said, his voice even gruffer than usual, using every bit of will power he possessed to stay in the bunker and not go kill the things that killed Alex. "Get out of there! Alex is down! I repeat
Sam's expression melted into the soft look with the slightly furrowed brow that meant he was about to try and be the reasonable brother. "Dean, Plan B is death. There is no Plan C."
Suddenly, Cas was back and Lizzy hadn't even heard him walk down from the road. Just like before, he wasn't there and then he was.
Sam paused there, swallowing thickly.
Dean parked half a mile down the road from the old building, and they walked the rest of the way.
"Yeah," Sam confirmed. "Must be a Nephilim thing."
"Anyway," Donna went on, "I just wanted to call while I had a minute, but I have to get back to work now. We've had some B&Es around here lately."
Sam was slumped at the table in the kitchen, a huge mug of coffee in front of him, not looking at all like the man who used to get up at 6am to run a mile in the woods surrounding the bunker.
He was fine. He could do this.
"Hello, Dean," he said.
"That's it," Jack confirmed. "During any down time, you'll have free reign to visit your loved ones, spend time at whatever home you desire, and enjoy your afterlife in any way you see fit."
It was Alex's voice that came over the line. "We're on it!" she yelled over the din of battle.
"Okay," Dean said, more to himself than to Cas. "That's something we're doing now. That's good. Totally fine."
bad right now, and Jody might try to kill you the next time she sees you, but are you one-hundred percent sure that you can't control the Mark? Because I'm telling you right now, as livid as I am over Patience, and as much as I'm hurting over...," he paused and swallowed thickly, forcing the words out, "...over Eileen...you're about to put my brother through the ringer."
Because even with faulty grace, and no First Blade, he was still more powerful than any human.
Sam sucked in a harsh breath before continuing, "He tried to hide it, but I know he prayed to Chuck for you. He begged for him to bring you back. You have to understand, this time looked like it was gonna stick. We burned your body."
With a sigh, Castiel gave Dean one final squeeze and whispered close to his ear, "I'm sorry, Dean. I love you."
"I tried calling Dean, but..."
Another blue light went out.
Lizzy frowned. "I'm not just gonna leave you alone in the woods. What if there are more monsters?"
Dean ran both hands roughly down his face before finally turning to look Cas in the eyes.
Cas nodded, vigorously, but couldn't seem to find words.
"You okay?" Dean asked, pausing for a moment.
Lizzy practically collapsed with relief. "Thank you so much. I'm actually already in town to support my friend, so I guess I'll see you soon."
They drove back to town together; Winchester, Winchester, and Kline. Dean chuckled to himself, thinking that they sounded like some kind of law firm, except badass.
Castiel didn't re-join them. He reached down to grab the door's handle and lift it open. The metal screeched, announcing their arrival.
"I'd shrug," Lizzy said, "but I can't."
A blue light blipped out of existence. Then a yellow light.
But the past is the past, and right now Dean is more concerned about how Cas, with his failing grace, is going to handle it.
"Thank you all for coming," Sam began, addressing the room. Dean, Cas, and Eileen walked around handing out some instructions that Sam had typed up the first day after Cas had come home.
Lizzy blinked, stupidly. She was an only child.
If he thought about it hard enough, for long enough, or prayed with every fiber of his being, surely Chuck or somebody would do
Once Sam was out of hearing range, Dean and Castiel sat down at the table in the library, their chairs pulled as close together as they could manage, and Dean finally voiced something that had been bothering him.
"Stop yelling!" Jack yelled.
"I refuse to do this without you," Dean mumbled into Castiel's shoulder. "Do you hear me, you sonofabitch? I would rather be buried with you than go on without you."
And that, really, was the problem.
Dean leaned in and kissed the angel, long and deep. His hands ran up the back of Castiel's neck and tangled in his hair. Castiel's hands gripped Dean's hips tightly and pulled them even closer together.
Eileen's eyes widened in horror.
Dean made eye contact with Death and held it, unflinching.
"It's something that they all say," Cas began, and Dean knew this was going to be hard, given the fact that Cas looked like he was about twenty seconds away from bolting.
Dean made his tone remain neutral as he asked, "And why is that?"
One of them went out.
The Mark sang. There was a greater threat to his family than ever, and he knew what he had to do.
That gave Castiel pause. It felt like only yesterday that he and Sam were searching for Dean as a demon, desperately hoping that they could find him and cure him. They would have done anything to bring him home.
"This can't be happening," he said, automatically looking up at Dean, as if waiting for his big brother to make everything okay again.
As Dean spun on his heel and made his way toward the Impala in silence, Sam knew that something in his brother had been irrevocably broken.
"Nothing," Dean assured him. "I just don't want to come yet, and I was well on my way. You're fucking awesome, man."
Cas practically growled, "That's not the
Castiel felt like the air had been punched out of him.
"Oh," Dean said, feeling like his entire body was on fire. "Good. That's...I'm just gonna...okay."
"That's not necessary," Castiel said, looking at Dean with more intensity than usual. "I can see your soul. I know it's really you."
Dean moaned, "You need to slow down, we need to talk about this!"
"You did ask."
It really wasn't his fault that Cas looked so sincere, so full of love, that Dean wanted to explode with it.
"Anybody alive in there?" came a man's voice to her left.
Dean grinned.
And then he pulled Cas by his tie, closing the inch or so gap between them, and their lips finally met.
"Um. Did I do this?" Jack asked, quietly.
Sam, Castiel, and Jack were all staring at him with their eyes wide and mouths frozen mid-yell.
angel? Like with wings and a harp?"
He walked toward the one that Dean and Cas had just used, but was stopped by Dean launching himself onto it first.
"Can I touch you?" Cas managed to say, "Please."
Dean glared at his brother, but they'd already wasted so much time batting this problem around, that Dean finally conceded.
"Dean," Cas said, resigned, as the other man ran to him, "You weren't supposed to see this. I was trying to spare you."
"Fair enough," he agreed.
Dean saw him lean down and whisper something to the dead girl, and that was too much. Dean closed his eyes and turned away, unable to reconcile the limp body on the ground with the girl he knew.
After that, prayers did come every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Sometimes it was direct, like that first one, but sometimes it was just a feeling of longing that made Castiel wish that he could punch his way out of his prison and be with Dean again. Other times, Dean would be dreaming about him, and he'd be able to pick up on feelings and scenarios that made him hard as a rock, despite his current situation. One morning, after such a dream, he received a direct prayer from Dean asking if it would be too weird to have prayer sex. He couldn't answer, of course, but Dean proceeded to take himself in hand and broadcast all of the dirty things he would do to Castiel once they could free him. Castiel finally relented on that morning, after a (frankly dumb) promise he'd made to himself to wait until he could be with Dean again, physically. He lowered his fly and pulled himself out, then stroked himself to the rhythm that Dean was broadcasting. If he let his mind wander, he could almost pretend that Dean's pants and moans were really in his ear, instead of just in his head. He could pretend that Dean was there with him.
