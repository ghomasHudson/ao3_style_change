"You know what, it's too early for this shit," he says, pinching the bridge of his nose. "I'll go get some work done while avoiding Garth. You tell whoever put you up to this that it's not friggin' funny, got it?"
To no one’s surprise but Dean’s it was easy to have him back. Although he’d rarely stayed in the bunker over long periods of time, he was just as ingrained in the fabric of their mundane every day life there as the rest of them. The room had always been his, picked for him by Dean during his short-lived-
In the distance someone is playing music from a speaker and he can hear people laughing but they're alone at this part of the beach and for some reason it feels like maybe it should make him nervous. It doesn't. He looks over at Cas, mirroring the soft smile he finds on his face and just allows himself to admire him while the guy is not looking. The last rays of sun reflect off his tan skin where the ridiculous flowery shirt he got him hangs open at his chest, making him glow in an entirely un-angelic but gorgeously human way. His eyes are glazed over with the alcohol in his system as he paints random patterns into the sand where his bare toes touch the ground and he looks so relaxed it easily takes a decade off him. And yeah maybe the Long Island Ice Tea is hitting him a bit harder than he thought because all he wants to do is reach out, almost unable to stand that there's any physical distance between them at all.
Dean’s shoulders go rigid with what Castiel knows is embarrassment and he allows himself a triumphant grin, always happy to see Dean flustered. Serves him right for making him team up with the cowardly duo in order to pursue a romantic interest. After a few torturous seconds during which he lets Dean stew in his hurt pride, he decides to return to his original research mission. He pats Dean’s shoulder in a sign of truce and turns to leave. To his surprise the hunter catches his hand and gives it a soft squeeze. His heart stutters in a mirror response but he decides the action is to be ignored by the both of them judging by the way Dean’s eyes remain focused on the TV. On the way out he swallows down the traitorous feeling of hope that always seems to stick to him, a residue of Dean’s touch however small and insignificant it may be.
The quick kiss that followed was preceded by an eye-roll. Or rather, it had clearly been intended to be a quick kiss on Cas’s end but Dean had other plans. With no real idea when they’d next get a chance to see each other, he was going to make the most of this and kiss the guy within an inch of his life.
"I… suppose," Castiel agrees but something in the way he looks at Dean doesn't seem right. Then it hits him.
"It was actually essential you were unaware of the exact nature of his MO. Other than the bees, all the victims had another thing in common. They were gay men."
Once inside the room, he makes a beeline for the table in the corner to grab the greasy bag of leftover fries from their lunch haul. Stuffing a handful into his mouth, he drops onto his designated mattress. A loose spring digs into his ribs, reminding him how fucking tired he is of the motel life. He doesn’t know how long he lies staring at a water stain on the ceiling while chewing on stale fries, but it feels like a very long time.
He stormed out the office to where Cas was waiting and ordered him to get in the car and text Sam. Not a moment later they were already on the move, tires screeching. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Cas’ worried look.
Dean checks his watch and, realizing it’s almost time to meet Sam, shakes his head. “Nah, you’ve all been real helpful. I think I got enough.” If he really were to write an article, he’d have exactly jack-shit since about halfway through Charlie’s monologue he stopped jotting down actual words and started drawing squiggly lines instead. If anyone asks, he grew up in a family of doctors or something.
In response to this revealing piece of information, Cas quirked a challenging eyebrow at him in a clear request to elaborate. “Oh?”
“Dean, we’ve known Cas for more than twelve years and I’ve seen you two hug maybe three times. I’m pretty sure you’ve been more touchy-feely with any given bartender at last call.”
“We have the interview at the daycare tomorrow,” Sam reminds the others while the boy is busy with his food.
Cas rolled his eyes ever so slightly before the gashes on his face closed themselves until they were merely scrapes. He also straightened up his posture, prompting Dean to remove his hand from where it lay on his shoulder.
"My books, yes." The voice coming from beside him has lost its venom, in its place a tone of defeat.
“That’s what I thought.” Sam patted his hand one last time before getting up from where he was resting against the table. “C’mon.” He picked up the dog toy, squeezing it to beckon for Miracle – and by extension also Dean- to follow.
“No!” Jack says forcefully, struggling against Sam’s grip when he tries to lift him out of the bathtub. “No, Sammy. Play more boat!”
“Damn it,” Dean curses, though he knows that whatever went down happened way before they even arrived. This marks victim number four in as many days. All ideas of downtime and cocktails are cast aside as the gravity of the situation hits. They all get their asses in gear, realizing that they need to up their game, make sure no one else gets hurt. Sam already makes a 911 call for ‘back-up’, giving a fake FBI badge number.
, and he didn’t stop at just the one beer either, losing count at around five or six and deeming the buzzing in his head a good sign to switch over to liquor. Cas didn’t stay to watch this particular downward spiral, just left to who knew where for who cared how long. He told himself it didn’t matter that he was back to hurting the people he cared about because he didn’t
A moment later his mood almost amps up to ecstasy when he sees a group of women in grass skirts and generously revealing bikini tops gathering around a speaker they set up in the sand. He’s clearly not the only one who’s intrigued, judging by the audience that quickly forms around them, and when one of the girls turns around and smiles cheekily at him he doesn’t need to be asked twice to join the small gathering. While their outfits are definitely not trying to be modest, the dance routine itself is actually pretty far removed from the suggestive twerk-and-grind shows he’s used to but seeing as the majority of related experiences took place in strip clubs that’s not a surprise. He finds himself enjoying the show for the flowing movements and the joyful music rather than the scantily clad women in front of him. It’s over way too soon, after maybe three songs or so, and Dean is almost disappointed. After a little encore that definitely eases some of that disappointment, the girls start handing out flyers for their performance later that night. Which just so happens to be at the party that their stake-out is going to happen at. Dean takes this as the perfect opportunity it is to get some inside contacts. It’s the girl that lured him over in the first place who comes up to him with a flyer and one of the spare flower garlands she pulled out of a box. She has to tiptoe to put it around his neck and Dean makes sure to send her what he
Cas smiles gratefully at him and he looks so open and relaxed, it takes Dean’s breath away. His eyes are glazed over from the alcohol and he can’t quite keep his focus on Dean but he’s anything but subtle when his gaze drops to Dean’s lips. It’s just Dean’s luck that of all the days to feel comparatively sober he has to choose today and miss his chance with his brother’s unfairly attractive co-worker. He won’t take advantage of someone so obviously hammered, no matter how much he might want to. And man, does he want to. Sure, Cas’s mind reading thing is weird as hell, but the dude’s hot and clearly into Dean so sue him for being really freaking tempted.
He doesn’t talk to the Winchesters for two days. Doesn’t even come out of his room. All he needs is stored away in the drawer by his bed in the form of super sized nougat bars, courtesy of Gabriel. Sometimes he hears nervous pacing outside his door, each step radiating Sam’s hesitation before he ultimately moves on every time. Maybe he is under the impression Jack went to sleep or is recharging, which is ironic. Since the nightmares started, sleep is far more draining than keeping himself awake for however long he can. Although he hasn’t been doing much at all he feels exhausted as he lies on his bed, gaze locked on the ceiling. Ever since the few hunters they managed to save from the other world have left to scatter around the country and maybe even beyond, Jack has been lonely. This world doesn’t need him to save it, or at least not at this point in time, and he is left without purpose but with all this power he can feel within himself. A constant ebb and flow of white-hot fire that aches to break to the surface, like a volcano about to erupt. He doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone but his anger sometimes comes so close to taking over completely it’s only a matter of time until he won’t be able to reign it in.
For a little while the air is filled with subdued chatter and happy crunching noises before a spotlight illuminates the center of the arena and everyone’s attention turns to the shortish guy that steps into the light. He's dressed like a Vegas off-strip magic show threw up on him, and still somehow it’s his tennis shoes that take the price for the most ridiculous part of his outfit.
The scene that presents itself at the party is not a pretty one. There’s small fires everywhere, some from torches that have fallen over, others probably courtesy of Pele herself. The goddess in question is perched maybe halfway up the incline of the volcano she herself created, roaring down at the terrified crowd. As far as Dean can tell at first glance, there’s no casualties so far, which is great. He also spots Sam at the foot of the volcano, trying and failing to get closer to her as she keeps throwing dangerously glowing rocks down at him.
This time there is no hesitation and no judgmental glances before Castiel reaches out to accept Dean's greasy handshake. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Dean."
Before he even realized he was moving, Dean already found himself outside his room walking toward the bedroom usually occupied by the angel during his stays.
Perpetually ready to deflect, Dean shrugged. “I think he’s doing well. Gonna be back on the road in no time.”
Castiel startles less from the words themselves and more from their tone. Tired but laced with something that usually remains hidden. He doesn’t reward Dean with an explanation, just sends him a
Nothing mattered after Lillith. Because nothing was real anymore, was it? They had never been free, not for one second. Every bit of happiness, it was all a big fat lie. They were happy when Chuck
He was gonna fucking get Cas back just so he could witness the look on that dog’s face when he triumphantly carried his stick and it was gonna be so worth it.
Dean snorts. “Listen, I know it’s dumb. But I wasn’t kidding when I said Sam loved spaghetti tacos. Sure, they taste like ass but it’s one of the things I made for him when I was like nine or something and I remember it being fun.”
The next snowball Dean throws hits his target, closely followed by one of Cas’s. For a little while the battle picks up more seriously again but soon they’re all exhausted and starting to get cold so they declare a truce. Everyone comes out victorious but the real winner is of course Miracle, who got to chase after flying snowballs for the better part of the afternoon.
Dean refused to admit that his brother was right even though all the signs were there. Cas’s posture was relaxed as he casually leaned with his hip against the countertop of his market stand, and where he had been all smiles with Bree, this guy seemed to give Cas a certain edge. It was the difference between the flattery of being flirted with and actively flirting back and Dean felt the blood freeze in his veins at the realization.
Dean feels the back of his neck grow hot with the blush that's sure to spread but he takes it in stride, proudly dropping onto the pull-out couch with a grin that makes no secret of how damn happy he is. "Yeah yeah. Save yourself the I told you so."
The angel nodded, seemingly appreciating the honest answer before returning his gaze to the window once more. “All
Instead of saying something ridiculous, Dean opted to lean in for another kiss before nudging Cas gently into the direction of his room.
"Yeah." Dean nodded. "Fine tracking spell you had going. A little heads-up would've been nice, though."
Dean had zoned out for the explanation of which plant was important for what but Sam had nodded along knowingly the whole time, so Dean had let those two share their little thing. He couldn't even complain, since the space Cas was using was well out of everyone's way and he had used his own steal-it-yourself truck to haul all his equipment back to the bunker, meaning they were also rid of the ridiculous Lincoln Continental Cas had been cruising around in when they’d first taught him how to drive. He turned out to be a decent enough driver, a little heavy on the breaks still, but he hadn't graduated to the Impala yet. Cas was family but he’d only had his fake license for a couple of months and Baby was a lady.
When they finally hit the road it was already past noon. It was a gray, unfriendly day and the road was wet from rain. Once they were outside the city limits of Lebanon, Dean floored the gas pedal in an attempt to get them as far as possible before it got too late. They didn’t have many hours of daylight left. Usually that wouldn’t bother Dean, who preferred driving in the dark, but something about being in an enclosed space in the middle of the night on some mid-western back-road with a decidedly pissed-off angel did not sound particularly appealing to the hunter.
"Dean, what about the bookstore?" The voice startles him to a halt before he remembers he's supposed to be talking to Sam.
It’s clearly a rhetorical question as he immediately follows it with kicking off his boots and tossing them somewhere next to where Castiel’s own shoes are before he climbs into the bed on Jack’s other side. He smells like smoke from the bar and a hint of beer but Dean isn’t drunk by any means. Just buzzed enough to be pleasantly carefree as his hand settles over Jack’s side. For a long moment Castiel finds himself unable to return to the book, captivated by the sheer domesticity of the situation, especially after Dean has been flip-flopping so painfully between unusual intimacy and complete withdrawal from him as of late.
Cas could sit out there in his garden and just watch the bees for hours on end, and Dean could spend that same time watching Cas. His anger at the poorly placed honey jars was quickly forgotten when Cas turned to meet him with a bright smile.
“Why do you seem upset?” There’s worry lines forming on Cas’s face as he asks and Dean finds the urge to smooth them out overwhelming. For a moment he even wonders if he could kiss them away but it’s not the time to test that out. Not with things still needing some clarification.
? I think I saw it when I was picking up stuff to write down my address this morning." Encouraged, he jumps up and wants to walk over there to check but Castiel places a hand on his shoulder in that one touch that would stop Dean dead in his tracks no matter what.
“Dean… I’m gonna say this once, and then I’ll never mention anything again unless you want me to, but you and Cas… You’ve been a constant. No matter what happened to us, you two have always found your way back to each other. Now I won’t tell you how you feel or what this could mean, but I’m asking you to think about it. For this once, think about if it
“It’s the truth,” Sam continues calmly, his nervousness only betrayed by the way his eyes dart between the girl and the crowd of people that’s uncomfortably close by.
He immediately felt bad about chewing Cas out like that and quickly pulled him into a kiss as a means to apologize. Cas met him thirstily, all sloppy with too much tongue and not a hint of his teasing nature. It was very unlike him.
“We’ll call a cab,” Eileen chimes in and Dean is just about to thank her for the level-headed answer when he catches her sending him a
Sam only adds to the mental image. "Okay, if that's all you need I'll get back to Civil Law: Volumes V-VII. Bye, Dean."
Dean hated when his brother was right. He’d rather give Baby's bonnet racing stripes than admit it though. “You done?”
, Sam.” The blush creeping up his brother’s ears is a tell-tale sign that ‘weird’ barely begins to cover it.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, suddenly feeling his throat closing up ever so slightly as memories of all four of them together in the bunker came crashing down on him.
There was a mumbled apology followed by retreating steps. Castiel turned toward the other voice, the one right by his side. "Dean?"
"Hey!" he calls out to hold the other man back just a moment longer. "I don't know a whole lot about books but I know someone who'd love this place and I wanna tell them about it. Can I get your name, for future reference?" That wasn't smooth, per se, but hopefully it'll work out anyway. Dean waits a painful couple of seconds while enduring a calculative blue-eyed stare.
It’s a lie by omission. Of course Sam has been worried about the lack of communication but they’ve been busy with cases and in their life it isn’t unusual to go without seeing someone they care about for long periods of time. Even if that someone is Cas.
"Wipe that frown off yer face," Bobby scolds, recognizing the look on Dean's features for what it is. "Gotta finish on the Chevelle before startin' anything new."
going for the Cheese’n Bacon, extra cheese, extra bacon. A glance past the menu at his brother told him the answer even before any words left Sam’s mouth. He met Dean’s eyes disapprovingly.
“I was four when I started taking care of Sammy,” Dean says matter-of-factly, his eyes stone cold. Another day Jack might have felt bad for him, but today his anger rightfully overrules any sympathy.
"Lemme guess," Dean said, smirk still in place. "Tax accountant?" His green eyes danced with mirth and Castiel didn't quite find the will to look away.
Quickly he makes his way through the bar, past the now even drunker college students, past the people still choosing country songs from the jukebox, until he’s finally out the door. He’s hit with a late autumn breeze that already carries the bite of winter. Not far ahead he spots a familiar trench coated figure leaning against the brick wall of one of the neighboring buildings.
"That you are," Castiel agrees. They stare at each other calculatingly for longer than Dean would consider normal- but normal isn't really their thing anyway. He trusts Castiel, he realizes, unconditionally. And that probably isn't healthy, or particularly smart but the decision has been made without his brain having any say in it. There's still an 80% chance of Castiel being utterly insane but Dean is willing to look past that for now. No matter how ridiculous it sounds, at least magic is a starting point for further investigation.
He was rewarded with an enthusiastic embrace. Dean’s arms wrapped securely around the angel, even though it meant he was bleeding all over his clothes. Neither of them cared.
“Hello,” a soft female voice said. She clearly did not realize she was not, in fact, speaking to the right fake FBI agent. “It’s Officer Banks, you gave me this number at the crime scene in case we found some more information?”
They rent a car so they don’t have to depend on cabs and Dean misses Baby what he knows is an unhealthy amount once he lays eyes on the Prius Sam pulls up in. He heaves a sigh as he lifts first his own bag into the trunk, then Cas’. The gesture comes automatically. Small things like this have been happening more and more frequently since the former angel has been grounded in humanity. Dean knows it doesn’t make him less capable by any means, but something in heir interactions has shifted now that it feels like they’re on equal ground. Dean doesn’t examine it too closely, actively avoids any and all interpretation of his own actions, but he can’t deny that he just kind of likes getting to do small favors like this. He also likes that Cas lets him, never saying a word when he holds a door open for him, or casually pays for dinner, or folds his laundry when he’s already doing his own anyway. And yeah he really cant think about all that because even his dense ass knows it sounds like they’re dating or something. His generosity ends however when Cas moves toward the Prius’ passenger side. Dean just lets out a sharp whistle to communicate
“’S’not unreasonable when you get curtains for a windowless friggin’ room,” Dean murmurs as he scans the curtains together with the rest of their items at the self-checkout.
. From here it looks much less intimidating than from up in the sky and he wasn’t going to make a big deal out of it or anything but he’s always been a bit of a sucker for some nice seaside downtime. Not that he’s ever had much of a chance for it. In fact, he doesn’t even remember the last time he’s been anywhere near open water.
«Now if you’ll excuse me, I’d prefer to be alone for the night.» Cas motioned for Dean to leave the room. The hunter couldn’t get his legs to work.
Cas sure didn’t seem to have any objections, even when they were met with two incredibly annoyed and clearly impatient angels once they stepped outside with kiss-swollen lips and hair that was messed up all the way to hell.
Well, there's nothing Dean can do about it now except make a list of everything he'll need for Bobby to hopefully find and order, online or otherwise. Dean sighs and pats his numerous pockets for a pen and crumbled notepad before he starts scribbling down all the important parts he knows by heart. It may not be a '67 Chevy Impala like the one he himself owns but it all starts out with a good old V8 engine and Dean will see where he goes from there.
“S’alright,” Dean grunts, setting the kid down on the mattress and rubbing at the sore spot. While he just earlier remembered being too young for child-rearing, he suddenly feels incredibly old. “How ‘bout we go make some breakfast?”
On instinct, Dean wrapped his legs around Cas because even the thought of the angel stepping away was kind of painful right now. He fisted a hand into Cas' dark hair and opened his mouth, letting a low moan escape before he prodded his tongue at Cas' lips. He was rewarded with a soft sigh as the angel parted his lips for him and Dean knew he was fucking gone right then.
Meg wrinkled her nose. “No dice. He was a clingy bastard who needed someone to mother him. I’m looking for fresh meat. It’s a real shame, you know. All the good ones are taken, gay, or fictional.”
The younger Alpha arched his eyebrows, but yanked open the backseat door. He climbed in, yanking the door shut as Dean let off the break. "What happened?"
What’s more, this was now twice in a week this Demon had escaped his Devil’s Trap. Only this time, for whatever reason, the notion only made Castiel sigh. Perhaps he was just drained by everything else. That and it wasn’t as much of a surprise this time.
It occurred to him this was the second time Dean had thought to account for differences in youngling will-o'-the-wisps and their adult counterparts. It struck him as oddly touching. On an impulse he shared this with Dean, more as a sense of combined memory flashes and a wave of emotion. For a moment the Alpha's eyes glazed, his breath hitching.
“Yes, Boris Karloff. The first incarnation. The newer ones are good too, but I’m partial to the classics.”
Lowering his gaze, Castiel leaned towards Dean and laid a hand on his bicep. In the most demure voice he’d ever attempted to use the Omega stated, “I don’t think they’re inclined to listen to reason, mate. Perhaps we should just pack your things and leave.”
When Dean finally looked at him instead of the asphalt, he leaned in to peck his lips, smiling as he pulled away.
His nearest stash house had various stocks he’d procured in the fifties, and he was decidedly surprised to find they were the best bet. Granted things like Johnson & Johnson hadn’t looked impressive at the time, but it had clearly paid off. It was a bit tricky, being an Angel getting these things converted on the fly, but he managed. In the end he had what he hoped to be enough currency to last him through Dean’s entire recuperation. And it only took five hours.
“’S okay, chief. Guess I pushed you too far.” The words lisped around fangs as they came out. The scent of blood did that to a vampire, even their own, regardless of whether or not it was accompanied by actual hunger.
“No, but likely it was part of their agreement. I’ve seen this before, I remember enough to know this is the proper spell and ingredients. Now if you don’t mind, by my approximation you have roughly six hours left, and it will take time to assemble- “
The Angel was scolding himself for such sentiment when he felt it. Castiel froze, wings twitching, getting into position to either fly or execute an evasive maneuver, whichever was needed first. His blade fell into his palm as he scanned the area, searching for the source of the grace traces he was detecting. He wasn’t sure if this was worse, having another Angel out here rather than a Demon. Those he could pick off and claim to be sweeping up strays. His own kind would be more complicated.
An expression he’d been seeing a lot, something between exasperation and frustration, returned to Dean’s face. “No, I don’t know any other Seraph’s,” he sighed, setting a pan on the stove. “None that I left alive, anyhow. Just you.”
His throat went tight as he watched the scene from a minute ago play out. His realization of what happened, his reaction to what had happened, his shouting for Bobby and trying to stop the bleeding. It was brief, and his own eyes had been closed at the time, but he could just make out the smallest flares of white light under his hands as he clutched Benny’s wounded arm. That had been right before Bobby had shown up, and he’d realized the gash was gone, as though it had never existed in the first place.
It was all he got out before the Angel’s two fingers made contact with his forehead. Those pretty eyes rolled back and Dean went limp, collapsing to the floor in a heap. Turning stiffly, Castiel walked out the door, yanking it closed on his heels.
"I go out of my way to be truthful with you," Castiel informed him. "At the time, that was the truth as I knew it. Now....don't ask me to explain it, I'm not sure I can, nor am I sure you want me to. Just know that this time was very different. Special. I wouldn't have done this otherwise."
Spitting a mouthful of blood onto the ground, he shoved her blade away and made to return with a blow of his own. It cost him, for all he did manage to cut her cheek instead of slit her throat. A cut opened in his arm, short and shallow, but a cut all the same.
Wordlessly, Castiel handed him the letter. Dean grabbed it, eyes darting back and forth across it. His fingers tightened on the paper as he read it over, then read it again. A smile began to spread across his own face.
He picked up the flat basket with the weed’s he’d wrestled from the ground, moving it onto the grass and rocking himself upright. The Omega huffed, carrying it over to the refuse pile. He heard more than one set of footsteps, but he didn’t turn until he’d dumped the weeds. When he did he froze, stiffening for all he tried to appear at ease.
Dragging his eyes back up, Castiel asked, “How? How does that explain it? He’s been acting odd, but…did he think I wouldn’t notice? Or think to fix it? If I hadn’t been so preoccupied yesterday I would have. Perhaps that’s why he gave me this. As a diversion.”
Two burritos and a mug of joe later saw Dean sitting on the edge of his tub. He’d never actually soaked in it or anything, just used the shower fixtures, but it was finally coming in handy. The shower curtain was shoved to the far end of its rail and moved outside the tub, warm water rumbling from its spout. Sam, who’d taken off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves, reached up to take the showerhead from its mount.
"I wasn't expecting to need such awareness when tracking down two rouge Omegas," Virgil admitted reluctantly. "But I don't intend to return with nothing. It's part of why my rates are so high, I never fail."
The Spring semester ended. During the summer he went full time at Bobby’s shop. Castiel moved him into the two bedroom apartment he was afforded on the building’s first floor. By then what he called ‘courting’ was in full swing. After five bouquets in five days Dean put his foot down on flowers. He packed Dean’s lunch each day, and it wasn’t always a PB&J, but there was always a sickeningly sweet little note. He never asked for anything in the physical department, only stole the occasional kiss. Well, and cuddles. He did seem to really enjoy those. Even if getting them meant curling around Dean like a cat while he did homework on the couch.
Castiel didn’t push him on the subject, though. It was one of the more tolerable habits Dean was beginning to notice. A lot of the things that the angel did that annoyed him or upset him ended up being infractions committed by obliviousness.
“They were very kind, as well as helpful,” Castiel reminded him. “They still send us Christmas cards. Missouri had dragged the entirety of our story out of me just before we stopped for dinner. Then she asked me a few questions, and I didn’t realize it until later but she was getting me to work things out on my own.” After a moment’s hesitation Castiel explained slowly, “We argued a lot. We still do, but not as much or as bad as we did initially.”
The headaches took a little more explanation. According to Castiel, his brain had been rewiring itself. He could now hear and see everything an angel did. True forms were always visible, illnesses and falsehoods could be seen, but when Dean asked he did admit you could learn to ‘tune it out’. The human added it to the growing list of things he would be making this seraph teach him in the coming days. At least he’d already learned to tune out angel radio, which was indeed what all the voices were about. A sort of frequency angels used to communicate, which as an angel’s soulmate he was now able to tap into whether he liked it or not. Oddly enough, no angel had actually named the process before, seemingly there had never been a need. By this point Dean had already concluded that angels as a whole weren’t a very inventive race, and took some degree of smug pleasure in seeing Castiel’s brow furrow when he repeated, “Angel radio?”
They played twenty questions, Castiel touched base with his brother via text, and answered his mother’s check-in to see how the traffic was. Hanna worried, but she didn’t hover. She’d broken that habit during his freshman year of college, and had taken up periodic calls or texts instead of daily pestering. He’d let her know when they were leaving, and once assured they were surviving the traffic she left them be. He was also able to get an update on Sam and Gabriel, who were closer than they were. At a guess they’d get there an hour or so before Dean and Castiel.
Castiel glanced back periodically, but he never had to speed his pace beyond a trot. After his second failed attempt at running the Alpha gave up, settling for an accelerated walk. The Omega filed this away as yet another point in his favor. He'd actually had to stop several times in the past because foolish Alphas with heat scent in their noses kept running and falling or running into trees. Even now this one displayed intelligence. He'd gotten beyond lucky for his final heat, stumbling onto such a fine breeder so quickly.
"When you and your father were on that djinn hunt in Kansas, the one you took while we finished that vampire job in Washington. We...exaggerated how difficult it was. Sam wanted to look around a few campuses. Stanford was one of them. He spoke to a professor, they liked him."
To her surprise there was a clatter from the garage, followed by what sounded suspiciously like curse words. A moment later the Alpha came out of the garage, shrugging into a canvas jacket. He broke into a trot when he saw her, still on hands and knees in the snow.
As the morning went on Castiel made two circuits of the property. The first was to carve sigils into tree trunks, write them into dirt and intone charms that would brand them into the earth. The second was to shuffle in one continuous loop, reciting a spell the whole way. It was complicated and time consuming, but it was the strongest warding he’d ever found. If anyone tried to step onto the property with malicious intent, human or otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to cross the barrier. If any member of his own kind got anywhere near the place they’d want to avoid it, their own instincts would warn them it wasn’t safe. If he wanted them to get in all that had to be done was for a human to let them, much like crossing a threshold.
The dragon who’d been looking at Dean like he’d crawled out of a sewer sighed, pulling a long, curved blade from inside his jacket. “Enough. Let’s just end him and be done with it. Talking gains us nothing.”
The rest of his visit was uneventful otherwise, and he only left when there was enough time for him to do a patrol before returning to the base. Castiel ended up sleeping through most of his off-duty time, a pattern that repeated itself. Twice more he spent most of his patrol time with Dean before his strength began to return to its normal levels. He felt a bit guilty at first, spending all that time resting and eating and watching various movies when he should have been working. When he mentioned it to the Demon, if only after Dean nagged him about what was “making him look constipated”, he scoffed at the concern.
“Sometimes it’s as much about the journey as it is the destination,” Dean reminded him. “Admit it, you had fun.”
Castiel studied him for a moment, then decided, “If she does attempt contact again, would you like the honor of killing her once I disable her?”
“If your sense of direction is truly ‘awesome’, then why is it the last time I allowed you to navigate we spent five hours trying to get out of the Sioux Falls Halloween corn maze?”
He didn’t scurry to the register so much as he meandered, curious now. Humans had come a long way from crafting phallic devices of clay and tying cloth around manacles, he had to say. He did appreciate how it had become an industry, in that standards and safety could be maintained. It explained the decreasing number of souls who had come to Heaven by more erotic means, though they did still happen.
Keeping it there, Castiel reached for the pocket. He worked his fingers under the fabric, feeling seams giving way as he probed the space. It took a moment, more threads snapped before he reached the pocket’s bottom, but he finally felt a coiled thong.
Castiel motioned for his son, who trotted out to join him. Halfway there, though, he paused long enough to briefly hug Dean. This seemed to surprise the Alpha as much as did Castiel, not that he was displeased in the slightest. Pleasure warmed his chest as he laid a hand on his son’s shoulder, looking up in time to see his Alpha’s eyes soften.
Dean didn’t say anything. He shuffled forward a step, the hand on Castiel’s neck pulling him close, the other arm wrapping around him tightly. Castiel buried his face in his neck, hands fisting in the back of his shirt.
After delivering one more, devouring kiss Dean began pulling the Omega in the direction in which he'd pointed. He was a little surprised to feel hands tugging impatiently at his clothes, an insistent noise in his throat. The Alpha found himself fumbling to get his outer layers off while still moving and not breaking contact with Castiel. By the time they reached a secondary chamber both had managed to strip down to the waist, though Dean's belt was undone.
They had unloaded the car, and Castiel was setting a toiletry kit on a dresser in what was apparently Dean’s old room when the door was nudged shut. He looked up, expecting Dean, only to find Jo leaning against it, arms folded. He frowned, facing her. “Is something wrong?”
His cousin waved it off. "Please. Seriously...what've you been up to? Uncle Zachariah and Aunt Hester wigged out big-time when you took off. And I mean atomic, they even flew two states over to grill me because I'm the known troublemaker. Last I heard they'd hired three different private investigators to track your ass down."
The Demon cracked a smile, rocking forward again. “Yep. We can have fun with that, but not right now. You ready?”
Dean held up his hands, fake innocence all over his face, evergreen eyes wide. “Nothing. I just thought Angels didn’t care about that kinda thing.”
This Alpha didn't collapse on top of him. His limbs shook, his eyes glazed with pure rut hormones, his breath shuttering in his throat, but he didn't collapse. He slowly lowered himself down on top of the Omega, nestling against his throat and heaving a big, contented sigh.
“Considering the price is helping you guys go after every son of a bitch who tried stabbing me in the back, I kinda am.”
"Some folks don't want to wait around for their people to die before they do something." He handed the Omega the flask, ordering, "Open it."
He pulled his head upright from where it had been slumped against one shoulder, dragging his dry eyes open. He had to blink a few times before his vison cleared, but when he was finally able to look around he wished he couldn’t. It only got worse when the ringing in his ears faded away, and he could hear what was being said.
Once outside, he had to admit he was impressed with what Gabriel had done to his wards. A few extra marks had boosted them, allowing them to hold more power, which was then poured into them. He’d even reinforced the Devil’s Trap, one Castiel sensed even Lucifer himself would have a problem with. As an added bonus, if he hadn’t known where to come he never would have found this place. The shielding that camouflaged it made the entire property blend in seamlessly until he was setting foot on the porch. But then he’d expected nothing less of an Archangel.
It took hours for his temper to settle back down again. Until that happened, Dean had been pouting. Like an infant. It wouldn’t have taken so long for Castiel to settle, but one look at the sulking Demon and it would spike all over again.
Maybe he would have argued, but…peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Castiel hesitated for only a moment before picking up the topmost PB&J. He took a bite, chewing slowly. Mmm, he’d even gotten the ratio right.
Castiel shoved the now lifeless Angel from his lap, letting himself flop back onto the ground with a groan. He was
Hazel thought about that for a minute, brow furrowed. “Is that possible? I don’t think Ms. Talbot is that flexible.”
Great. Just great. He started looking for something else to watch, miserably looking for a new distraction. Honestly the blood trails weren’t so bad, just a few clusters of drops, no real spatters. It was the rest that worried him, spread high and wide. The sweep of crimson now painting his bathroom door was easily three feet long. Were they that broad, or were they just long?
Clad in only boxers and a gray undershirt, Dean got himself a beer and dropped onto the couch to watch a Clint Eastwood movie. It was a true testament to his state of mind that even his favorite cowboy movie couldn’t make him any less restless. Three beers later, he muted the TV and took Sam’s present over to the small table tucked against a wall by his little kitchenette. He flipped on a light, poured himself some of the good scotch, muttered a happy birthday to himself, and took a slow draft.
Then he let his second blade fall into his hand, placing it on the kitchen table before the Demon. Dean, who’d just taken another big bite of the oversized sandwich, froze mid-chew. He stared at the blade for a long moment, then his eyes moved up to the Angel’s face.
“Yesterday. Research, I’ll show you it later,” Dean told him with a sly wink. “Apparently the issue is working things out, but most of the sites agreed that once an Aquarius and Taurus get along they could move mountains. I think we got to that stage. On the other hand, not every trait ascribed to the signs applied to us. Like the whole white picket fence thing was my idea, and our values aren’t so different they get in the way that much. And I am way more flexible than they give us credit for.”
When those cosmos began to shift he snapped his attention back to the creature, who appeared to be shrinking. They slowly straightened to an upright standing position, by which time they actually fit in the space they’d ripped open in the warehouse. Dean dragged his attention back to their head, only to realize for the first time there was three of them. They didn’t appear to be holding stagnant, which was doubly weird when you took into account none matched, and none were humanoid. One he was certain resembled a bird of prey, another was more equine, while the center head was decidedly wolf-like. That was about as specific as any one of them seemed to get, though.
“No.” He’d never had the time or capacity to pursue the few he’d been attracted to. And it really was a few. By his count Dean made four. Four appealing possibilities in many, many years.
, but he liked it. So did Samandriel. He was enraptured by it all, but then he had minimal exposure to TV as a whole, never mind the various animation styles. By sheer force of will he managed to stay conscious long enough to see the end, but as Josh Groban began to sing the credits he nodded off for good.
Reduced to crawling, first he went back over to the toilet to flush it, then began the very undignified process of crawling slowly out into the apartment proper. It was slow going, he couldn’t move very fast or his head started to swim again, but he got himself to the kitchen. Thankfully he didn’t have to go through the process of getting a glass down from high cabinets to get some water, there were some plastic bottles in his fridge. Granted they were put there by Sam to try and encourage being ‘healthy’ but that just meant he had a nice supply waiting for him.
Castiel paused after he'd stepped over the threshold, waiting until Dean had shut the door and set aside his weapon to take the human's right hand. He brought it up, pressing cool digits to his ear, trusting Dean to handle them with care. His trust wasn't betrayed.
Generally Castiel despised this aspect of his enemies. Though in times like this, he couldn’t help but appreciate the benefits. For the last two human months he’d been enjoying the serenity of these mundane patrols, flying out solo to check the perimeter. No balancing on a razor’s edge, every sense and instinct on alert, no listening to younger partners complain. They always had something to complain about, be it too quiet a posting with not enough leave to enjoy it properly, or too much action. Honestly, you think they’d pick something and stick to it. Not continue the nonsensical flip-flopping. Didn’t the humans have a saying for that? The grass was always greener? Well, it was, but that didn’t mean it was wise to say as much.
“Dean! Dean, come here!” His voice broke as he lurched through the kitchen, making for the stairs. His husband met him at their base, a worried look on his face, apparently having heard the tone in his shout.
It hadn’t been a thing he’d worried about, exactly. More like a lingering doubt he knew wouldn’t come to fruition. Still, there was a part of him that warmed when Dean didn’t seem to display any favoritism for Claire. There was the special attention you gave to an infant, or a young pup, but nothing more. To see him interact with the others, there was no reason to think he wasn’t the biological father to all four younglings. They’d even started calling him Dad, and a father he was, in everything but blood.
Castiel closed his eyes, deciding to put logical thought back out of his mind. He rolled his hips, not bothering to quiet the moan in his throat at the resulting sensation. His mate's knot was still buried inside him, putting pressure on all the right places, and if he twitched in just the right way his prostate became one of those places.
"Yes. But not without prior warning, and I don't invade. It's a subtly you haven't learned yet. So don't attempt it yet, understood?"
Well, the lord was ignoring him. Dean had warned him beforehand, of course, but that didn’t mean Castiel wasn’t irritated by the man. He was one of those lazy lords who enjoyed the comfort of his food and drink far more often than was healthy. He was also old, seemed to be allergic to baths, and misogynistic on top of it all. He hadn’t even looked at Castiel, completely ignoring him since their arrival. His servants had been nice, many of them apparently remembering Dean from his last pass through the area. From the looks of it many of the females had been particularly enthusiastic in displaying their appreciation, and now seemed very disappointed to see he was now mated. This might have been of more concern to Castiel, but beyond being polite Dean essentially ignored them.
One of Castiel’s bolder, more excitable students was already squealing the announcement, “Oh my gods! Mr. Novak is dating Dean!”
"Bingo. Mom only had us out of a sense of duty, especially after her first born turned out to be as interesting as me. He might be her favorite, but I love the little bastard. Not to mention he's given me three going on four adorable nephews and nieces. I'd like to keep them all happy and healthy if it's all the same to you. If that means covering for him while he runs off with a human, fine. I'd just like to be sure it's a human worth running off with."
His son made a face, folding his arms over Dean’s head and dropping his chin onto them in a full pout. “Humans are boring,” he huffed.
“I’m aware.” He shuffled passed Dean, collapsing onto the nearest seat, which happened to be a kitchen chair. The Seraph braced his elbows on the table, rubbing his temples wearily. “Shut the door. Is there food left?”
Love the comments! They, along with all the awesome kudos, make me feel warm and fuzzy. They also motivate me to see a story through. Any questions, comments, or concerns are welcomed with open arms. Non-constructive flames are ignored with the upmost prejudice. Feel the love, spread the love!
Slowly, evergreen eyes lifted to stare at him as a palm pressed to the Demon’s cheek. “You’re really giving this to me?”
Lips twitching in amusement, popping some cheese-laden bread into his mouth, Castiel explained, “I do keep an eye on your feeds. The response was far more enthusiastic than I anticipated, and I have to clarify when I ask if there are any questions that they need to be related to the current subject I’m teaching.”
Castiel blinked. Few people remembered their human lives, and the longer you spent as an Angel or Demon the less they retained. Demons in particular didn’t often remember. Time in Hell did that to you. “You remember what you were before?”
Castiel didn't even realize he'd fallen asleep until he was rudely awoken by an alarm on Dean's phone. He jerked, gasping as Dean lurched upright and fumbled to grab it. Once it was silenced he twisted, turning to stare at Castiel in a room lit only by a few fingers of moonlight.
“So there’s gonna be a next time!” Beaming broadly, Dean gave the camera a thumbs-up. “If you like what you see, like, comment, and subscribe down below. Especially if you want to see more of my awesome hubby. Stay safe, Gotham!”
There was a meadow roughly half a mile from his cave, at an angle from the nearest village, so rarely did he encounter anyone. Though the primary reason he came here was the flowers. Thick, lush grass covered in flowers of purple, yellow, and white. Some weeds, some not. Either way there were many creatures drawn here by them. If he was still enough he got to see them all. Rabbits, gophers, butterflies, mice, bumblebees, humming birds. The tiny birds fascinated him as much as his favored bees.
Dean dragged one from the fridge, putting a shoulder to cool metal as he twisted off the top and gulped half of it in one draft, not caring some spilled over his jaw and cheeks. He rested his forehead against the fridge door, eyes fluttering shut, still clutching crumpling plastic in one hand. The thought of eating was so far from his mind it was hilarious, and frankly he wasn’t sure he could keep anything besides water down. Not until the wings developed in full.
“Think he wants a miracle,” Benny grumbled, knocking off dirt and dried mud caking around the engine’s edges.
Dean’s head fell back, panting, crooked glasses still fogged as a hot mouth and cool metal bar kissed and nipped its way down his torso. His hips jerked when those lips wrapped around his cock, shifting his thighs farther apart. A keening whine hitched in his throat, his good hand tangling in Castiel’s hair as he choked, “Shit, Cas.”
They were cleaning up, having devoured just about everything, when Castiel decided now was as good a time as any. It was something that had been nagging at him, but he’d kept smothered. Reluctantly he decided he had best get it sorted out now, before he was any deeper.
After they stopped on the third mile marker Castiel handed over the camera, and as they got going Dean checked the list of questions on his phone. The idea was to answer them as they climbed, between shots of everything else. Dean had already told his story as a means to pass the time before he was allowed to eat again.
“I believe it was mentioned you convinced me to accompany you to a coffee date after our last therapy session,” Castiel recalled.
Shaking his head, the Omega walked over to the large rug laid out before their hearth, then sank onto all fours. He crawled the rest of the way, head down, and came to kneel before his Alpha. Fingers stroked his hair once, twice, then tangled in it. He was guided up to his knees, leaning forward between the Alpha’s spread thighs. Without a word, or raising his eyes, Castiel reached up to undo his belt and trousers, just enough to free the human’s stirring member.
“Some do. Some don’t. Not all of us got it burned out. Look, uh, you need to get back to that healer. Let me get back to the cabin, get you your coat, then you call in your reinforcements. We can talk about it tomorrow.”
Rather than answer, Castiel scooted himself back a little farther, then rolled onto his knees. He crawled to the middle of the bed, turning his head to regard Dean through lidded eyes. “This what you had in mind?”
The older Alpha stood slowly, bracing his hands on the back of his chair, watching his son through weary eyes. "The bones did the trick, never saw that ghost again. We were packing up to skip town when he started acting screwy. He had a fever, he couldn't move very much, cramps that had him on the floor. Bleeding too, a lot of it. I got him into the truck and brought him to the hospital. They had to get him a transfusion before they could give him an exam, kept him a few days just to be sure."
Even if he’d wanted to keep talking Castiel wouldn’t have been able to. He froze, going perfectly still, eyes widening as a mouth slanted over his own, just like he had the first time.
To make things worse, this was when Bela came over. Hazel didn't like Bela. She was mean, and Dad said you weren't supposed to start fights. It was okay to finish them, in fact he'd promised ice cream if she did, but never was she to start them. Unfortunately Bela threw words, not fists, so she hadn't gotten to punch her yet.
Initially Dean thought he was finally losing his mind. He stumbled through his daily routine in something of a daze, trying not to panic. No one else heard anything, and at this point he was afraid to ask. Hearing voices was a guaranteed one-way trip to the nearest loony bin, which he wasn’t about to risk. Instead he added ‘ignoring the voices’ to his list of things to cope with.
Considering it was nearly a decade ago, Castiel remembered that day very well. Remembered sitting on Mary’s couch, a cup of lemonade clutched in his hands, simultaneously giddy and nervous. She’d raised her eyebrows at Dean’s tentative introduction, but still invited them in and fed them pie. She’d asked him questions, where he was from, what he was studying, and the like. Jo seemed irrationally pleased to find her elder brother had fallen head over ass for another guy, something about a yaoi faze she was going through.
Tears that weren’t from the pain in his back welled in his eyes, a tremor going through him. “Forgive me, Alpha, please,” he whimpered, pleading with his mate. “Be good for you, be a good Omega, I promise. Won’t disobey you again.”
That earned him a fond smile, for all Castiel's pupils were flushed with lust of his own. "I'm a dragon," he said simply, taking the candle to light several others. "If you wish I'll explain the mechanics to you later."
Castiel hung up, setting their hunter line back on its high shelf. He ripped off the sheet of paper, folding it in half and setting it on top of the phone just as the oven timer went off. He sidestepped, skirting a discarded soccer ball and hitting the timer before sliding a thick mitt over one hand.
Closing the reed trunk, Castiel moved on to the next one. This trunk was hardwood, oriental designs tooled into its surface. The Omega opened brass latches to hoist its lid, lifting something wrapped in heavy cloth. He pulled it away, revealing what looked like a goblet. The shape was familiar, at any rate, but he didn't recognize the material. It looked heavy, solid, a cream color mixed with swirls of pale pink. The handles were fashioned like lions with open mouths, the cup's surface engraved with swirling clouds and sweeping designs, an additional ring around its short flute before squaring out over four rounded feet.
Castiel was content to dust off one of the wooden lounge chairs on Dean’s deck and settle down. Samandriel half bounced half stumbled through the thick snow, until he found out following in the Alpha’s footprints was much easier. He continued with this method until enough snow had been packed down that getting around was easier.
He raised his head from a nipple to say this. Castiel only groaned rather than protest further, shoving his head back down. Dean chuckled, obligingly going back to work. He slid a hand under the Omega's knee, lifting it as he lightly nipped his mate mark. Castiel let his other leg slide off the seat, allowing the Alpha more room as well as full access.
Dean spared an exasperated glance to either side, but then did a doubletake. The glimmer that had been light reflecting off them was now an outright sheen around each feather, just enough to be noticed and that same shade of pale blue as what emanated from his soulmark. He hadn’t noticed before, or maybe it had been masked by the coating of blood.
"You know better, Dean. If I didn't agree to taking a dog along what in the hell makes you think I'll agree to an Omega?"
Castiel was almost to the tree line, intending to see what natural herbs or plants grew in the area, when he spotted a bee. Instantly his attention was diverted, his gaze locked on the drifting creature. He followed it, wandering through a few trees and bushes before making his way around the house.
By the time he was fed Balthazar seemed to have forgotten about his reluctance in verbal communication. He licked the last of whipped cream from his fork, legs swinging below the table, more or less interrogating the Alpha. Castiel was happy to leave him to it, glad they seemed to be getting along. After lunch Dean introduced Balthazar to something called Silly String, and while Castiel had a feeling he’d regret it later he didn’t interfere.
“Fine.” He slammed the door behind himself as he left. It wasn’t quite so late most things were closed, and he was able to be choosy in where he got his fix. He sampled five different places before returning to the fourth establishment, getting six regular burgers and six bacon cheeseburgers. On a whim he even got fries.
“No.” Though he understood the concern. The last time Dean had seen a ball of fire was when he’d been lured to what should have been his death. This one was smaller, though, and a rich shade of gold. It hung by the tree line, and Castiel could just make out the shape beyond it. Hunched. Limping. Falling.
He had just realized he was starting to sway in his seat when someone put a hand on his bad shoulder. The Omega shifted, lifting his head a little as someone not his mate sat next to him. Dean lifted his head a little more to peer at them, blinking in an effort to clear his vision. Normally he would squint, but that hurt too much right now. It was a miracle he hadn't gotten glass in his eyes.
“The most objective method would be to find a trustworthy third party who is knowledgeable in this and have them kiss both of us.”
Only then did Dean drag his gaze up, staring blearily at his own reflection. His eyes were red rimmed and overbright, freckles standing out on ashen skin, lips damp, water still dripping down his chin. His shoulders and chest were bare save for the amulet he never took off, the one Sam had given him after that thirteenth birthday.
Dean kissed him one more time, then withdrew. He drew Castiel upright, helping him off the bed. He pulled a knee pad out from under the bed, taking the Omega’s hands as he carefully knelt on it. Even before the Alpha sat on the bed’s edge, thighs to either side of him, Castiel knew what he wanted.
Steeling himself, Dean cut the engine and climbed out. He was the good son, Sam was the one who argued constantly with their father, but on this he had no intention of budging. Castiel climbed out too, but he hung back as Dean went to face John.
The first stack was placed by her register and Margie went to work once more. Castiel watched the total drop, bit by bit. It was one thing to know they had well over a hundred coupons to get through, it was another to sit through the process.
“No. I think it’s just removing inhibitions,” Castiel murmured, caressing his temple, stroking his hair.
“They’re still sore. Maybe later.” At least he had the sense to ask first. An assortment of traits were something of a fascination to humans, wings among them. Some had a habit of touching without asking first, which was very rude. Now that he had a set of his own, Dean could see why.
He positioned himself close to the bowl, waiting for Sam to begin the ritual. His brother took a deep breath, rolled his shoulders and sent him a nervous smile, barely a twitch at the corner of his mouth. Then he started chanting, the words from the scroll rolling off his tongue more awkwardly than the Latin he was used to. With all the confidence he could muster, Dean cut into the flesh of his arm until the blood ran freely. Once the first drops fell into the bowl the air grew thick with the familiar electricity of magic. Sam’s chanting stocked but he regained his composure fast and continued in an even steadier voice than before, fueled by determination. It felt like time lost its meaning or at the very least stopped for the time being, every word from Sam’s lips charging the room. The closer he got to the bottom of the scroll, the more effort it seemed to take. Dean began to feel dizzy from both the blood-loss and the suffocating power taking up what felt like all the air in the room. He was actually dangerously close to passing out when Sam yelled what must have been the final words of the spell and threw the crystal into the copper bowl. A bright flash of pink blinded them as time seemed to start back up and the air came rushing back into the room. Dean was thrown backwards with the sheer force of it.
Luckily he was saved by the bell, or rather the ringtone of his cellphone. He jumped at the opportunity to escape the situation, never having been more thankful for Jody’s random check-in calls. She had taken to calling every other day since the whole Kaya situation and it was sweet but bordering overbearing. This time he received the conversation eagerly, fleeing guiltily from Cas’ all-too captivating eyes.
The light came from a couple of camping lights that were systematically placed, illuminating what was obviously the shifter’s lair. Only he was late to the party because said shifter, still wearing the face of the beautician they’d last seen it in, was already spread out on the ground, angel blade buried in its neck. A bit further away, just at the edge of the semi-circle of white light, was another body. It hung limply from the pipe system running along the low ceiling, hands tied above the head. Blood was dripping from a nasty wound down familiar features.
Intrigued, Dean steals a glance at his watch. His break is almost over and he only walked to the café so it would probably be better to get his ass back to work- but before that he still wants to visit
.” He sends a pointed look downwards where Cas’s hand is once more dangerously close to a very enticing area.
2- I am bullshitting myself through the magical elements of this story because I'm lazy but this is a more than 20k crack!fic so I don't know what you expected (also- holy assbutt, 20k!)
Jack’s eyes turned glassy with tears and it took him a long time before he finally spoke in a shaky voice. “How can I let go of what I’ve done? I’ve killed innocent people.”
The silence in place of said offer seems to be appreciated when Dean takes one of the glasses and raises it in a halfhearted toast, prompting Castiel to do the same. Castiel remains perfectly still but allows their eyes to lock. Whatever emotion has cloaked his earlier words in a veil of something they usually bury, never to be spoken of, it is reflected in his eyes now. A faint beacon in a sea of green. Castiel cannot bring himself to look away even when Dean touches the glass to his lips. He only takes a hesitant sip before changing his mind and draining the entire content in one gulp. When he chases a stray drop of liquor with his tongue, Castiel is transfixed by it, frozen in his seat.
Sam had disappeared from his post at some point too, leaving Dean entirely abandoned. This had been a stupid idea. There was no case here. The last visitors of the festival were already making their way toward the parking lot, signaling to the vendors that it was time to pack up. It looked like it had been a good day for Bree, who had only a few beeswax candles left on her counter and was carefully placing them back into a small box when Dean walked over. Cas was nowhere to be seen, probably gathering some boxes from the truck himself.
Cas’s eyes open as he hums his appreciation, pushing Dean off him and to the side in favor of reaching for the liquid gold on the nightstand. Cradling his mug in both hands he sits up against the headboard next to where Dean has settled, taking several small sips.
For a moment he was tempted to try and look again, then decided against it. He’d seen a few recordings, usually in documentaries, of humans getting their wings. Humans who’d already met their soulmates, who knew what they were getting. It was a slow, painful, bloody process. Suddenly he decided it probably wouldn’t do him much good to see what was becoming of his own back. Best to wait until the process had run its course.
“No, those were my ideas. McDonalds was his idea, though. I liked their fries, so I agreed. Why, have they done poorly?”
An index finger stroked his cheek, then moved up to his ear. He heard breath hitch as it gently curled around the tapered point, a thumb brushing the sensitive appendage with such tenderness he actually shivered. Why was this fool of a human behaving in such a manner? They were not mates, they would never be mates, it made no sense.
Dean snickered, earning a look from the two of them. Clearing his throat, he explained, “I don’t think you’d be thinking him if you know
“This was last year, I think,” Dean recalled. “We were in this jewelry shop, the plan was to find mom something special for her fiftieth birthday. He wands off and starts looking at watches.”
Dean pulled away, eyes dilated as he stared into the Omega’s face, a hand lifting to press to his cheek. “And I you,” he murmured.
“I’m here, aren’t I?” he asked innocently, sipping his coffee. Per Dean’s suggested he was wearing basketball shorts this time, paired with a t-shirt inscribed with ‘
Dean lowered the camera, clicking the recording button into the off position as he did so. “You never told me about that before.”
Any other day, it wouldn’t bother him so much. They teased and nagged each other, it was part of the friendship, but right then Dean’s temper erupted. He set his jaw, one hand going tight on the Jeep’s chassis, feeling his wings tense at his back. “Let it go.”
Castiel’s eyes narrowed, something that felt suspiciously like pain blooming in his chest. “Your intentions were merely for diversion?”
Castiel tilted his head, blinking through drops on his lashes as his mother wheezed and flailed, trying and failing to budge the stone on her chest. “Draining spells hurt, mother. You can feel the magic being drawn from your very being. I’m afraid I didn’t include a pincher spell, but…”
A smile split Castiel’s own face. “It is. I agree, you should check it out. I take it back, that is my favorite.”
"Dean, I'm sorry I kept this from you. Sam made me promise not to tell. I'm not going to leave you, and I'm sorry I didn't stand by you. But I won't apologize for helping him. Please don't be angry."
"Four years ago, I think." Castiel lowered the mask, carefully placing it back in the trunk. There was obviously more in it, but the Omega didn't take anything else out. As he took back the bells he continued, "I spent more time there than I intended, travel during the rainy season is virtually impossible whether you go by ground or by air. It's still beautiful, if you can handle the heat. You should see their jungles, if you don't mind the dangers."
Dean just grinned, picking up the skeleton spider. “What? It’s supposed to be scary and fun. Skeletons are scary.”
“Regrettably. Remove your hand or I will relieve you of it, and you can attempt to grow it back on your own.”
A faint smile was on Castiel's face. "Yes." Lifting a hand, he pointed at the roadside ahead. "There's Sam."
"Where did you get these?" Dean shrugged off his coat, tossing it over another chair and picking up some of the print-out coupons to check the expiration dates.
The undoubtedly intimate moment came to a close when the human's eyes began to dilate, making his voice even rougher when he spoke again.
Well, at least John’s sense of self-preservation had improved. It had been somewhat lacking the day he’d come home to find Dean and his boyfriend making a visit. While he’d guessed, Castiel hadn’t had confirmation until that day just how emphatic John was about heterosexuality. Either Mary hadn’t noticed, or hadn’t wanted to notice, that all three times John had caught wind of Dean deviating from his idea of the straight and narrow it he’d corrected it with a beating. By the time he was seventeen this hadn’t resulted in the ‘corrected’ behavior he’d wanted, but rather a son who was very skilled at keeping things from his parents. Sam had favored girls more, so there was less fuel to his fire, but he hadn’t been opposed to guys either. Dean hadn’t been so lucky.
Sam made a face, flopping back in his seat and folding his arms. "I was going to make my own reading list for the summer."
By the time he was on his second cup he’d settled on the fifth instalment of All Saints’ Day, hoping some David Yaeger would have a calming effect. Considering he was trying to ingest caffeine, it wasn’t working. He’d no sooner finished that second mug of joe before he felt himself nodding off before he could so much as stagger to his bed.
This only made Dean blush more, but the lady just beamed at them and focused on her work. She was fast, more so than most of the people Castiel had seen behind the register. He could see why Dean had opted for her lane, if not for the friendliness.
On Gabriel’s advice Castiel had considered the inevitability of an interrogation by Naomi, and he was suddenly very glad he’d anticipated this particular line of questioning. He was also glad they were using a direct mental link, so Samandriel wasn’t privy to it.
Smiling, Castiel led the way towards the hiking trail. Their plan was to hike up the trail this morning then head back in the afternoon. If all went well they’d actually make it to the top of the ridge before Dean could beg a lunch break. Last time they’d done this particular trail he’d managed to go through their lunch and most of their snacks by the time they reached the viewpoint. Castiel was bound and determined that they make it to the trail’s end by the time he fed his husband lunch, and that they didn’t run out of food halfway back down the trail. Dean had been surly and hungry by the time they’d driven home last time. Accordingly all the food and the small padded lunch bag with their sandwiches was in his backpack while Dean carried a majority of their other supplies.
,” Cas immediately corrects him, drawing out the syllables like pronunciation is the issue Dean has with the term.
is saying about child-friendly laundry detergent. It’s a moot effort, he knows as much. The tension in the room is thick enough to slice with one of the decorative swords resting on the library shelves, even when he’s not actively looking at the others’ bickering. If he’s being honest, he’s surprised things are only escalating
"By overcompensating. We needed you to act jealous, if we had told you to go flirt with Cas, you would have been all flustered and weird about it and probably called him
of all things flickered over Cas’s features, though it might have been the shadows playing a trick on Dean’s senses. When he looked more closely, the angel seemed neutral as ever.
“No, I agree with you on that one,” Sam suddenly spoke up, emerging from the corn stalks and giving the god just enough time to register what was happening before a stake was pushed right through his heart.
The knot in Dean’s stomach threatens to tear him to pieces. All his previous caution and tentative humor reverts to rage. Who does that bastard think he is?
Many seasonal cycles come and go, stretching on or passing in a whim so that they don’t actually indicate the passage of years like they would on Earth. Jack keeps things intentionally vague, so much so that not even Cas in his role as angelic ambassador or whatever he calls it knows what’s happening in the land of the living. Dean just goes with the flow, focusing instead on the things that keep life interesting up here. John and Mary have taken to hosting barbecues at their little home and he has avoided them for the longest time, mostly because he won’t go without Cas but going

day but as long as there’s any determination at all left in Castiel, he will continue to do it for as long as Dean will allow him to. Who knows, maybe one day he will have the guts to give into the urge and shake him into oblivion. For now he sticks with his verbal praise and hopes for the best.
As he waits for his food, Dean's thoughts involuntarily find their way to the guy in the bookstore. He remembers the fondness with which he handled the books in such a stark contrast to the almost hostile way he treated Dean. It was odd yet intriguing. On a whim the mechanic decides to text his brother.
It’s not a subject he’s eager to discuss at this point, maybe ever, so instead he attempts to steer the conversation away from himself. “So, how come you’re this surprised to see me? Didn’t your angel mojo give you a little warning or something?”
Instead of sitting down too, Sam excuses himself to buy the first round in a poorly veiled effort to appease Dean.
.” The word feels wrong, like a poor stand-in for something else. “So screw that. If we are operating on borrowed time, I’ll make my goodbye worthwhile
He took the simultaneous eye-rolls he received as affirmation and just grinned at them before half walking, half dragging Cas out of the room and down the hallway. Once at the angel’s designated room, he hesitated. The hunter hadn’t been in there since their falling out and he hadn’t been all that welcome then. This time Cas wasn’t lucid enough to complain though, so Dean proceeded to open the door. He did have some difficulties, seeing as he had an armful of angel to deal with, but eventually Cas ended up on the mattress of his own bed. Dean was just about to leave when he felt a hand around his wrist.
Sam double-checks the address on the piece of paper in his hands. It matches the building he finds himself in front of, but a regular colonial townhouse is not what he expected, which makes him feel kind of silly. Of course, a witch wouldn’t live in a cottage in the woods or a secluded mansion in the 21
” The creature said the name like it was savoring its flavor. “Angel of the lord, man of your dreams. Quite literally, if I’m seeing correctly.”
Sam shrugged but hid a grin behind a forkful of some pumpkin, kale and feta cheese atrocity. “Whatever sells the cover.”
At that moment it didn’t matter what had happened with God, or Lucifer or Mom. All that mattered to Dean was Cas.
"Okay, fine. I don't wanna be mad at you, Cas. Keep it to yourself for now." Dean swallowed. He briefly considered reaching out and patting Cas' arm again but he knew that it wouldn't be enough for either of them. He could sense it, the mutual craving for contact that neither allowed themselves and he wondered briefly if it had always been like that between them and he was even more pro at dismissing this shit than he thought, or if it was new.
all day,” Sam snarked between sharp intakes of air. “No time to explain now, but if you can, bring a donkey.”
he would have been if he could have shared all these experiences, these first instances of his very own slice of unfiltered Americana, with the one person who deserved it more than anyone else. Cas had been sorely missing the entire time, sure, but now with his newfound confidence in what the angel meant to him, he ached with the missed opportunities. He’d never made a big secret of his occasional fondness for kitsch but he was almost embarrassed at the new heights it was reaching. He wanted to take Cas to a country fair and make him taste very kind of pie until their stomachs ached. He wanted to take him through the national parks and gaze at the Grand Canyon together, even if there was a good chance the guy had been around for its formation. He wanted to have Cas drive his damn car for no other reason than to watch him do it. He wanted backyard barbecues with Sam and Eileen and be the cool uncle if they chose to have kids, or just the annoying but lovable brother-in-law if they didn’t. He wanted to go on hunts and make the world a safer place but come home at the end of the day and sit on the couch with his dog and a grumpy Angel of the fucking Lord and
“Cas, if you eat any more honey, I’m gonna have to start calling you Winnie the Pooh. I think we can repurpose some of the jars you clean out almost weekly.”
Quickly catching up somewhere around the halfway point to the angel’s room, Dean still acts on auto pilot. He reaches out a hand, catches Cas’s shoulder in an iron grip and spins him around in a whirlwind action that probably catches them both off-guard. Cas squares his shoulders as he faces Dean, making him realize too late that he is powerless against the full force of those blue eyes. They compel him to drop his guard completely and surrender himself, not a hint of mercy in them. It’s not entirely clear who moves first, if it’s Cas drawing him in or Dean making a move but ultimately he finds himself crowding Cas against the bunker wall step by agonizing step. His hands come to rest just above Cas’s shoulders but it serves more to support himself than anything else now that his knees feel embarrassingly weak. Cas leans back against the wall, much more casual than he has has any goddamn right to, and licks his lips. The nerve. The
“There’s not walking on eggshells and then there’s just being a massive dick. One guess which side you fell on just now.”
Cas gave him a sideways glance, showing the hint of a smile in his eyes. "She used to say I was too forgiving of you."

that he’s screwed on that front because he hangs on every word coming from Cas’s lips despite his best attempts at looking indifferent and it’s not going unnoticed. Charlie hides her giggle by taking a long gulp from the beer she’s been nursing.
Their unusually warm autumn at the cabin flows naturally into the winter that has settled all around since Jack likes to keep at least some sort of seasonal continuity going, and their little family of three adjusts to their cohabitation easily. While the never-ending summer has been great, Dean finds he actually loves the winter evenings spent on the couch with him and Cas wrapped up together in the hideous comforter, some rum-spiked hot chocolate in their laps and Miracle curled up in front of the softly crackling fireplace. They added a vintage record player on a cabinet in the space behind Dean’s recliner that somehow always ends up playing the Zeppelin tracks from that mix-tape Dean once made for Cas. A remnant of a time where things were too complicated to have anything close to this. Sometimes Cas rests his head on Dean’s shoulder and hums along to the songs, ever so slightly off-key and outside any recognizable rhythm but it’s somehow still good. Or maybe Dean is even more gone for the guy than he thinks he is if he makes excuses for not doing the greatest band of all time justice. If one is to believe Jo there is no point arguing that particular point and for once Charlie is on her side.
“We already tried the whole ‘Til Death Do Us Part thing and it didn’t really work out. So how about we spend our eternal afterlives together instead. What do you say?”
Cas rolls his eyes dramatically. “I’ve always been this ‘bossy’.” The air quotes are audible in the way he echoes the word. “And you love it. Now
The Impala was well-stocked on everything from holy water to silver bullets, but Dean did not like going into a hunt without being certain he had something ready to eliminate whatever he was after. It wasn’t like they had a lot of time for a trial and error approach mid-fight.
Shit, Dean was drunker than he thought because before he even registered what he was doing he was taking a step toward Cas, curling a hand around the angel's loose tie, and pulling him in, in,
They’re all tired and the four hour time difference to back home somehow feels worse on top of everything that’s been happening in the last few hours. Where usually there would be arguments about who gets to shower first, Dean just motions for Sam to go while he drops down on his designated side of the mattress before he inevitably has to surrender most of the space to his giant of a brother later on. After almost immediately dozing off, it feels like he was just asleep for barely a moment when he’s called back into consciousness by a hand softly stroking his cheek. At any other point in his life he would surely have jumped out of his skin, grabbing for the closest weapon at such a blatant intrusion of his personal space when he is at his most vulnerable but his body somehow knows it’s just Cas. He placatingly complains, swatting the hand away, and automatically looks around to check if the little display was witnessed by anyone but his brother is already out cold, curled at the very edge of his side of the mattress. If Cas is offended by the dismissive gesture he doesn’t let it show. To his credit he never does anything this awkward when Sam is around to see, usually waking him up by shaking him or throwing something at his head like a
could see was the people I cared for the most destroying each other. And all I could do was watch hopelessly, knowing I’d lose everything.”
"I've no idea what you're talking about, Dean Winchester," the man says. And you see, here's the thing; He sounded genuine. Dean knows the sleazebag from TV and not in one interview has he uttered a single honest sentence but that just now? That's sincerity if Dean's ever seen it. The guy doesn't even seem to consider grabbing the money. Instead he gets out his own wallet, pulls out his
“Don’t need you two joining forces, is all I’m saying,” Dean grumbles defensively, interrupting Sam’s lament over the will-they-won’t-they dynamic between his brother and the angel.
Dean winces as he realizes what the other man is not so subtly hinting at. He really is a dick when Sam and Jo aren't around and he doesn't even realize it until it's way too late. The mechanic swallows hard and suddenly it's impossible to meet Castiel's too blue eyes without a pang of regret. "I- I might not have made a very good first impression."
Dean sighed. He wasn’t sure if he was the right person to talk about this just yet. “Listen, Cas. The kid’s going through some stuff right now. We’ve all been there. He’ll get over it.”
I won't put myself on a set schedule because that never works in my favor, but rest assured that there's more in the works. Stay tuned.
Cas spent his recovery from being ambushed in the bunker. His grace was weak and he looked like shit warmed over for the better part of a week before the bags under his eyes grew less prominent and the deep cut on his forehead turned first from an angry red to light pink before it faded out of existence without leaving even the hint of a scar. In spite of everything, it was good to have him back. He even seemed more interested in Dean’s actual company than the library, if the occasional movie nights were anything to go by. Sure, Dean wasn’t fooled for even a second that Cas ‘really enjoyed the
“C’mon. Eileen isn’t here, your crush is safe with me.” It’s just a joke. Sam has the best wife on the freaking planet and if Dean believed in soulmates, those two chuckleheads would be it. That doesn’t change the fact that his brother is just way too easy to rile up and it would be a crime not to take advantage of that fact.
Is Dean supposed to say thank you? He furrows his brow. "I'll… be… somewhere else," he says while slowly retreating backwards, out of the garage. Garth once told him it only took one beer to get him drunk and knowing the guy he might have literally forgotten that fact and emptied a bottle for breakfast.
“Hey!” he calls to the barkeeper, “I got this.” He motions around their now joined collection of various empty glasses and bottles and hands over a credit card that will maybe hopefully pay for this decidedly sad looking Thursday night.
“I’ll get right to it,” she finally says, tossing Sam’s CV aside unceremoniously. “What makes you think you’re suitable for this position?”
Helplessly, Dean leaned in until their foreheads came to gently rest together. “Arguably that’s part of my charm.”

the store I have not yet had to worry about fire posing imminent danger to my books." Castiel sends a smug look over his shoulder, a distant smile tugging at his perpetual frown.
“Did you think I’d stay and play house with the lot of you?” The archangel laughs. “Oh no, no, no. I got places to be, angels to make. This is on you guys.”
The next moment the two of them were stepping even closer than the crowded space imposed anyway and, after exchanging a pair of truly devious smirks, proclaiming at the very top of their lungs-
“Shut up, nerd,” Dean cursed, blushing furiously. Between the benevolent teasing of his brother and the ever so unsettling reaction he had whenever Cas touched him Dean did not like where this was headed. “I’ll call you once we know what we’re after.”
Dean was speechless for the longest time, his focus mainly on keeping his breathing even while Cas, once again, waited. Serene and patient until Dean finally dragged himself off Cas’s mattress to cross the few feet of space between them.
When the girl opens her mouth next it’s no longer her voice that flows from her lips. “I was called to shape the sacred land.”
daycare it’s a lot easier than he thought it would be to schedule out his days in a way that actively avoids Cas’s routine and outside of interactions with or about Jack they don’t seem to have a lot to say to each other anyway. It’s not tense, exactly, just cautious. Sam picks up on it almost immediately, of course, which means Dean has to avoid him too or he’ll be in for a round of judgmental sighs that he really doesn’t have the nerve for right now.
“I’m Jo,” she introduces herself before pointing a thumb over her shoulder at the rest of her posse. “These are Charlie, Gilda, and Cas.”
Outside the air is chillier than it was before the show, though the sun still peeks out between lazily passing clouds. A bunch of families must have left already, because the circus grounds are nowhere near as crowded as they were before. There's still a decent number of people around, however, with lines in front of the bathroom as well as the concession stand. Dean has little sympathy for the parents that are buying their kids even more candy right before presumably going home. That's just a sugar meltdown waiting to happen right when it's bedtime. He learned that lesson the hard way every Halloween until he was thirteen years old and finally understood the correlation between copious amounts of bite sized treats and Sammy throwing himself into practicing for the bed-jumping Olympics.
Not much later they did indeed stumble across the mine, almost by accident. Its entrance was hidden by shrubbery and on top of that the blizzard had almost completely covered it with snow. If it hadn’t been for Cas paying such close attention to their surroundings, Dean was sure he would have walked right past it.
Dean carried her inside, disappearing briefly into his bedroom before getting a blanket from the hall closet. He bundled her up, then stuffed her into the front seat of his car. As he climbed behind the wheel he asked, “Think you can get us there from the ground?”
For a moment Dean was quiet, and Castiel could see the gears churning behind his eyes. At last he asked, “You just gave my house this magically-fortified bubble?”
Sam huffed, shoving his arm away, hair ruffled. Reaching over to pick up a bag topped with tissue paper, he shoved it forward and ordered, “Open it.”
Another kit. They were going to have another kit. Castiel hadn’t anticipated loving them as he did, wanting more. It was hardly easy, the pregnancies had as many trials as they did benefits, and for all he adored their kits they were often a handful. That said…he’d never trade them for anything. Gorgeous little infants who took weeks before the scaled patterns faded from their skin, who blinked up at him for the first time with slitted eyes. He’d never realized until Henry that part of the reason their primary form was one or the other was due to the shape of their parents. If he’d been in his dragon form more often would they be rising winged lizards instead of bipedal humanoids? If their beloved father wasn’t so obviously human would they be so proud of their weaker forms?
Picking up one of them, he asked, “Was it necessary to consume all the alcohol? How are you not intoxicated?” Angels and Demons had a much higher tolerance than humans, and could consume a great deal more sustenance, but there were still limits.
It took some more poking from him and Sam, but they got them separated enough to get Gabriel’s shot. Sam kept him inside afterward, a strategic move on their part. They needed Lucifer calm for this, and Gabriel had a habit of riling up the kids. They bounced off each other. It wasn’t a bad thing, but it wasn’t conducive to what they were doing at the moment.
Dean winced. While it was good for business to have a reputation fluffed up, sometimes he forgot people honestly believed it. But then they'd never had to try killing a dragon before. It was difficult and dangerous to the upmost degree. A primary reason very few Slayers were in the business, and why they only hunted dragons when they were making a deadly nuisance of themselves.
It looked as though Gabriel had been in a fight for his life and barely escaped. His power was drained, not completely gone but there was precious little left. Likely that beacon was all he could scrape together. His left hand was badly burned, a cut on his left temple bled sluggishly, and his lips were stained an odd shade of purple, crimson blood turning violet in the light of his blue fire. Of more immediate concern to Castiel, his breath coming in short, rattling gasps.
Trying to keep his voice calm Castiel said, "I live here now. I didn't always. I like to read. Have you ever been to a monastery? They have books on everything, including sigils. If you don't make trouble and you help with their work, they welcome you into their libraries."
“I understand your reservations, but this was not a decision we made lightly. I’d like to take this time get to know you. Assuage concerns, if possible.”
Dean glared at him, though eyes he knew probably still looked red rimed and bloodshot. He’d tried drinking way too much water, at Sam’s suggestion he’d tried flushing them with saline, he’d even tried taking a damn nap. Everything that came up as suggestions when you plugged ‘how do I get rid of bloodshot eyes’ into a search engine. “Yeah, but not the way you mean.”
Charlie’s change would be more subtle, altered senses and a limited range of basic woodland magic. Not much, but enough to perk up daises and talk to chipmunks if the urge ever struck. The only physical change she would have to look forward to were pointed ears. At least Sam wouldn’t even have to deal with that. He and Eileen both were human. His brother had actually been a little disappointed in that, for all he wouldn’t change a thing. Dean honestly wasn’t sure if it bothered Sam more that they were perfectly human or his soulmate had been. Still, adapting to someone who couldn’t hear seemed to provide him with stimulation enough. Though he had been miffed when she turned out to be the better driver, something about more fine-tuned peripheral vision.
“Don’t speak,” Castiel commanded, glancing to his Alpha. “Pick him up, mind his ribs. We need to get him inside.”
The lips on his skin turned up in a beaming smile, jostling a bit as the Alpha chuckled. "I'd like to think so. But don't go experimenting to find out."
“Listen, we know about your blog, about Pele,” Sam cuts in. The girl’s eyes grow wide. “And we think you know what’s been happening to those people. I know losing a parent is hard, believe me I know, but some of the people who have died now, they were parents too.”
Was that the result of the Fall? Had all angels' wings been torn and burned and broken because of what he, Sam and Cas had set in motion? If so, Dean wasn't sure he could live with that. Dean wasn't sure Cas could live with that, seeing as his grace had been the trigger. As if on cue, the light in Cas' eyes brightened as his voice grew louder and the thunder rolled once more.
The bookseller joins Dean's breezy laughter with a breathy chuckle of his own in agreement before nodding his head in the opposite direction than he came from when carrying the sheets in. "The bathroom is behind that door over there, hopefully you will find everything you need."
"Yeah, yeah. Alright you creep. Time for bed." He moved to switch off the lamp on the nightstand and then settled back into the memory foam, holding out an arm for Cas to return to his side. The angel took the invitation gladly, pressing a kiss to Dean's chest.
Castiel's somewhat mocking expression from earlier transforms first into one of confusion before it settles on a warmer look that lights up his eyes in a way Dean thinks he could really get used to. The other man finally pushes off the doorframe and walks toward Dean, accepting the plate he holds out and studying the small labels on the end of each tea bag string for its flavour. "That's very thoughtful of you, Dean. Thank you," he says, looking up to meet Dean's eyes as he chooses a bag with an orange tag. They're not standing particularly close but may as well have been if the unsteady thumping of Dean's heart is any implication.
somehow. Or maybe it’s just in Dean’s head and he should take a minute to breathe through the haze clouding his mind.
what had happened, all Sam was seeing was a mark around the neck of his clearly depressed, completely hungover brother after a weekend alone. Didn’t take a genius to realize what conclusion that left to draw.
That’s… actually strangely comforting. He dares to steal a sideways glance at Cas only to immediately regret it. While he too has been doomed to a wildly patterned party hat, he is not wearing his flasher coat today, or any of his formal wear from their last encounter. Instead he is dressed in a light-blue shirt that’s just a bit too big on him. The top buttons are undone, which means Dean gets way more than he bargained for from the way the fabric exposes his tanned skin. It’s so understated, yet Dean forces his eyes back to the sunset to escape the feeling of having seen something utterly indecent. Next to him Cas clears his throat, reminding him with a start that he can probably feel his emotions taking a not so innocent turn.
“First time for everything,” she says before guiding him away from the now very few remaining people. The others follow them closely, making it impossible for Dean to get Sam’s attention as they round the corner. He has a bad fucking feeling about this.
Despite his apprehension, Sam is quick to gather all the ingredients for the spell that will etch the warding sigils into Jack’s ribs. They decide to do the ritual in the familiar surroundings of the boy’s room to make him as comfortable as they can. Castiel has tried to prepare him for what they are about to do, explaining that his strength could hurt other people even when he doesn’t mean to, so they will play a little game to help with that. Jack seemed to understand to the extend that was expected of a three year old. It is still going to be quite the adjustment, but for the moment the boy is curiously watching them work. Actually it’s mostly Sam who spreads a selection of ingredients around the bed, once again showing his growing proficiency in certain magic, though Castiel adjusts some of the Enochian sigils with a surge of his own grace when the younger Winchester isn’t looking. He knows Sam can handle constructive criticism much better than Dean but this is not the time to cause insecurities.
Now it was Cas' turn to get up , his calm finally cracking open to reveal the turmoil he had been keeping inside. «And
“I was misguided in trying more caring advances,” Castiel offers truthfully, no longer trying to hide his intentions. “You're not looking to collapse and crumble. Instead, you resist and you put up reinforcements against me when I become too-
.” In their current position, Dean still has a good few inches on him in height and he uses them to send a cocky look downwards, daring him to reveal his bluff.
"C'mon, don't be like that. It's just common courtesy. I mean, you don't see me leaving my skin mags lying around either. No one wants to deal with that."
The receptionist is a teenager who could not care less about the heat, sitting with his face inches from a fan and his nose buried in a comic book. He barely acknowledges their arrival, just makes them sign a form without checking their IDs and hands them a room key with a tacky hula girl on the key chain. Dean low-key loves it but makes it his mission to never let Sam know. Judging by his brother’s smirk he needn’t bother. The room itself is small but tidy with one queen sized bed taking up the center, a small table with a reading lamp and a door leading to a bathroom. A pull-out couch is also made into a second bed and Dean knows the question isn't where his giant of a brother will be sleeping but much rather who will share the bed bed with him. He’s prepared to make the decision via rock, paper, scissors, but Cas already drops his belongings onto the thin mattress of the couch like the martyr he is. For the sake if his own back muscles, Dean is not going to argue.
“Guys!” Sam finally interrupts their verbal ping pong match, gently rocking the child in his arms for emphasis. “Back to the real issue. What do we do?”
, they were waiting on word from Cas, who his nuisance of a little brother had insisted Dean call to help out on the case. If bodies hadn’t been piling up left and right, Dean would have straight up refused. As it was, he didn’t have the luxury to be an evasive bastard. He and Cas had been texting back and forth since Dean had broken their radio silence in the direct aftermath of the siren case, too worked up to stay out of the angel’s hair entirely. Their conversations were unremarkable; brief exchanges about their whereabouts and some mutual updates on whatever they’d been working on. More than a few times Dean had stopped himself before indulging too much and asking how the angel was doing or when they’d see each other again. The risk of sounding desperate was just too big. Plus, if Cas actually
Before it even fully registered with him that he was moving, he already found himself at the door to Jack’s room. He knocked carefully, almost in the hope that Jack was asleep and wouldn’t hear. Said hope was crushed by the nephilim’s strained voice. “I’m fine, Castiel.”
“That’s the best part of the book!” Dean’s face lights up with childlike excitement. “Got room for one more?”
At Sam’s unapologetic grin Dean feels his own smile falter. “I made a bet on how long it would take you to hit on her,” Sam explains matter-of-factly. “I gave you less than five minutes, Kalanie wouldn’t believe me. Now her misplaced trust in your decency has cost her a round of drinks.”
They spend time with the Roadhouse crew more frequently now, alternating between staying at Ellen’s or Bobby’s houses with their families for regularly scheduled meals. Dean finds his friends actually act much more bearable around them when he
The page shows nothing that would make it particularly memorable, just something that looks like a list and a couple of lines that are repeated over and over. "You sure?"
“Okay.” Cas has a valid point, it’s just going to take some getting used to. And really, five years instead of fifteen just means there’s less time to screw up, which is great. It
“Well, color me impressed,” Dean tells her honestly. The compliment earns him another kiss on the cheek before the girl gets swept up by a mad flurry of reporters. She just single-handedly disarmed a freaking deity, she'll handle herself just fine in an interview.
Sam looks first at Dean, then at the girl, before his expression changes into one of barely concealed mockery. “Oh, I see.”
And okay that wasn't shit they talked about, ever. It was one thing for Sam and Dean to take turns in making sacrifices for one another no one should ever have to even think about, but Dean had somehow overlooked the fact that they had recruited Cas into their suicide squad along the way. "Dude, no." Dean sighed. "This... Fuck, Cas. How did we get here, huh? How the hell did it come to this?" A moment later the hunter realized that, basically,
“Gesundheit indeed!” Cas repeated way too enthusiastically. “The Bergmönch- or mountain monk if you will- is a spirit from Germanic folklore.”
“No. You say if I'm your friend I'll help you die? Well, guess what, Dean. If that's a condition on your friendship, I want none of it.”
He realized too late that right above him one of the branches was losing its battle against the storm.
“Yeah.” Cas echoes, his entire face breaking into a smile. It takes Dean’s breath away and makes his eyes sting with emotions he doesn’t know what to do with.
Castiel snorts but seems appeased as he unlocks the door and steps outside but he doesn't walk away before turning once more. "You've called me that before… "
Again, Dean is surprised how many self-evident things there are to be done incorrectly and how he seems to be the one to find them all. Maybe he should make a game of Bingo out of it. "At least now we know there's nothing up there that can help," Dean says, eyeing the books above his head that he was at eye-level with not two minutes ago. He sighs and turns to face the other man. "Where'd you disappear to earlier?"
“I doubt he’d be of help in his current state.” The angel deadpanned, sounding ever so slightly annoyed.
Dean takes a moment to admire his work as he wipes his hands on his already mortar-stained jeans before having the debris disappear in an instant. While he enjoys the building part, he can’t say as much about the clean-up, so one more point for the afterlife for making it a non-issue. The fireplace looks great in its little nook but the wall above it appears kind of barren in comparison to what is slowly becoming a damn cozy living room corner. He makes an executive decision to add a TV to the empty space above the fireplace. So far he’s never taken the time to see what channels Heaven has to offer but there’s always something or other playing on the forgotten flat screen at the Roadhouse and anything will be better than the tiny model Cas had resting on his little stack of books. While he’s at it he adds a rustic coffee table and a neutral rug to tie everything together, decidedly ignoring the fact that Sam would tease him endlessly for this newly acquired interior design talk.
Before Dean can do anything more than nod his head, a dry pair of lips covers his, effectively short-circuiting every thought process whatsoever. It's merely a quick peck, over just as sudden as it started, but Dean is sure it's already the best kiss he's had so far. Neither pulls back far and Dean seizes the moment to finally run a hand through Castiel's hair, eyes still shut. They stay like that for a little while, just enjoying the moment.
Still, all reservations go out the window when Cas comes strolling down the bunker’s metal staircase just like he promised he would in response to Dean’s typo ridden text message the night before in which he had practically made him promise to come home soon. After he maybe had a bit too much to drink and it had been a little too three a.m. to make good decisions. Swallowing down his embarrassment he greets the angel with a sheepish smile, closing the laptop on the map table in front of him. There’s been some disappearances around Lake Michigan that could be their cup of tea but he’s not entirely convinced yet.
“Well, luckily he has you to protect him.” Castiel ruffles Jack’s hair lovingly. “Do you think he could go back to sleep after a story?”
“Thought we already cleared everything up. We’ll keep looking but if Michael manages a prison break, you and Sam know what to do.” It feels rehearsed, like Dean has been telling himself these exact words over and over again.
Tearing his eyes away from Dean’s face after recognizing he is dangerously close to inappropriate staring, Castiel turns his gaze towards the curtains in the shopping cart, pleased with himself. They are an off white color with vertical baby blue stripes about an inch in width, and would very likely reach all the way to the floor in the bedroom assigned to him. And fine, Castiel supposes Dean is right and they are not as pretty as he insisted they are but that is beside the point.
He still downs the tequila shot with a nod of thanks in her direction without paying attention to whether or not she sees the gesture. After all, while he may pass up an offer for no-strings-attached sex, he can’t say the same for the sweet burn of free liquor.
“Is this the type of cabin you had in mind?” the angel asked casually after a long while of silence, completely throwing Dean off guard.
Dean chuckled at the message. Would have been good to know that from the start. He quickly typed up a reply, assuring his brother that both him and Cas were alive and the case was closed.
The bookseller retreats a couple of steps to allow them both some space. He shrugs. "I convinced them you'd gone out the back, even went around the building with some to point out the direction you supposedly disappeared into."
as Sam likes to say. Dean is pretty sure he knows what that means and that it applies to his current situation.
“I- uh.” Dean frowned, feeling a throbbing nervousness in the pit of his stomach. “I don’t know if I feel...
It's not Sam's fault, after all there's no way for him to know about the craziest week of Dean's life. Yet he still has the urge to snap at his little brother for bringing Castiel up. "Nah, Sammy," he says dismissively. "We don't actually have anything in common."
It’s the closest thing to an apology he’s ever gotten from Dean but even so it’s too little too late.
“Dean, we didn’t lose him.” Sam barely allows himself a sideways glance at his brother. “I think this
Dean shook his head as if the action could rid him of the thoughts swirling in his mind. He couldn’t let himself be distracted while hunting without backup. In an admittedly not very smart move, strategy-wise, he’d shot Sam a quick text about finally having found another lead and headed straight down into the abyss in the hopes of cornering the thing once and for all. Sure, he should have waited for Cas to come rolling into town, or for his brother to finish the day’s last interviews but something about the prospect of seeing Cas again after
Cas grabs his hand in passing and lifts it to his lips for a kiss before announcing he’ll go read his book in bed. Immediately on board, Miracle abandons his food in favor of racing him up the stairs, knowing fully well that the No Dogs In Bed rule is really more of a friendly suggestion. That means Dean now finds himself alone with his thoughts. Sam’s words keep playing in his mind, looping back to what he knows is true. He’s been stalling for no reason for
Naturally it’s not a sustainable way to handle this little hiccup in their routine that has previously been working just fine and when Cas disappears for two nights to follow up on some Heaven business with Gabriel Dean finds himself irrationally afraid that he won’t come back, proving that all he’s doing is sabotaging a good thing. He actually
happened to be the bunker at some ungodly hour of the morning. Dean stumbled down the steps into the common areas with his mind in a haze, thoughts scrambled from both the hunt and the long drive home. He must have taken a harder hit than he realized because his recollection of the past couple of days were kind of a blur. He and Sam split somewhere just across the Kansas state line when a milk run of a haunting case had come up that they’d agreed Sam could handle by himself before heading home. Reminded of the fact, Dean checked his phone but it was nearing four o’clock in the goddamn morning and naturally Sam hadn’t texted yet.
“You’ll find time has quite a different meaning now,” Cas explains, allowing himself to be pulled into a bear-hug by what is now effectively his brother-in-law, as weird as that is.
Not that he had much time for that anyway because their main focus now was the heartbroken nephilim on self-imposed hunger strike in his room. Punishing himself. Dean remembered the way Sam had acted after getting his soul back, or how he himself had come down from the Mark of Cain like from a bad trip. There was no pain like being confronted with your own damn failures coming crashing down all at once. From experience Dean knew the phase of extreme self-punishment was going to blow over soon enough, even if the guilt wouldn’t go away. Cas on the other hand was getting increasingly antsy with worry. He barely left the vicinity of the kid’s room unless he absolutely had to join the Winchesters for some strategic planning. Most other times he was wandering up and down the hallway, asking Jack in sporadic intervals about his well-being. Dean was getting nervous just by witnessing the anxiety radiating off the angel. It got so bad that he was just about to send Cas out on a made-up errand to force the guy on a break when Cas came to him instead.
It doesn’t take long until Dean’s knees buckle and his hands come up from where they have been hanging at his sides to hold onto Castiel for dear life. His waist, his shoulders, anywhere that provides some leverage. The arm across Dean’s chest is no longer trapping him against the wall but securing him, holding up as much of his weight as Castiel can manage while keeping his focus elsewhere.
Lastly and most notably, Sam doesn't even complain when they maybe possibly get the tiniest bit carried away after what is supposed to be a quick kiss goodnight.
For a moment there’s an air of uncertainty between them as he finds himself once more alone with Cas but it dissipates soon enough when Dean loosens his grip on the angel’s wrist.
“Did Sam call you?” He hadn’t actually had the stones to do as much as send a quick text Cas’s way after the whole djinn incident.
“What are you doing,” Dean rasps once Castiel also starts to circle the button of his jeans, now triumphantly aware of the unmistakable strain beneath the denim.
Despite Castiel's pathetic attempt at non-verbal conversation, Gabriel continued to be a complete and utter jerk. "Yeah. I mean Cas here has been reliving your precious encounter from yesterday every waking moment of his. I bet he even wrote about you in his diary-"
"This is gonna sound crazy as hell but you gotta believe me. I promise I'm sober, though I really wish I wasn't at this point, and I know you probably don't give a shit after- well, I know you don't give a shit. Just… hear me out, I didn't know where else to go, I swear-"
The thought made him absentmindedly reach up to his neck, reminded of the choke-hold he’d helplessly experienced in the dream. He had felt the ghost of soreness ever since he woke up but had dismissed it, blaming the fact that he’d barely allowed himself to process anything before fleeing his bedroom. Now that he was definitely more awake and decidedly felt like an idiot for how afraid he’d been he’d expect the phantom feeling to disappear as well. He looked around himself in search of a reflective surface. While the bunker was home to a great many things, mirrors clearly hadn’t made the cut in the planning phase beyond the bathrooms. Usually this was not a problem as Dean liked to achieve an effortless style, the less effort the better. How his walking L’Oréal commercial of a brother dealt with it wasn’t his concern. He didn’t know what compelled him but before he could examine his actions too closely he was already stalking down the corridor to the shower room, leaving Miracle, who was still fully captivated by his food bowl, behind. It felt demeaning to give into his anxieties like that, he thought as he was faintly aware of the way his heartbeat sped up once he reached his destination but with no one there to bear witness he didn’t find the strength within himself to fight the compulsion. It took him a full minute of standing at one of the sinks with both hands braced on either side of it before he actually dared to look up at his reflection.
“You said we would talk later,” he explains, the words hushed but firm. “It's later now. And I'd like to talk.”
“Okay, alright, let’s just… not talk about this.” He turns around to watch the people at the party. Besides Jo, Sam and Eileen he only recognizes Donna and Jody. “Anyone else from your work here?”
They had found a room in a hostel close to the road that would get them to the hiking routes the victims had disappeared from but there were no other guests currently staying there. Even if there had been, Dean was past caring who overheard their words at that point.
And yeah well, that’s an invitation for a kiss if Dean’s heard it, so he doesn’t leave Cas hanging and instead charges forward until there’s finally no space between them at all. It’s not desperate or dirty, there’s plenty of time for both of that later. It’s a saccharine promise of commitment that they’ve both needed from each other but so stubbornly withheld for way too long and it’s
He simply wanted Cas to be happy for once. With no strings attached, and no threats looming over them. And if the Empty, or God, or anyone else dared to even think about taking that away from the angel, then Dean would fight them personally. No matter the cost.
"Yes. And then the civil war forced me to steal another angel's grace, destroying all hope for this dream I had."
Just as he washes down the tequila’s sting with a swig of his fourth or so beer, someone takes a seat next to him and orders a glass of whiskey. His insides form into a knot as he recognizes the voice. It can’t be. It’s too much of a coincidence, after all this time.
browser history but as soon as he typed in his password a page came up that looked suspiciously like it was connected to what the angel was cooking together in the dungeon. The sigils matched and from what Dean gathered Cas had done a decent job with what he recognized as a locating spell. Seemingly, Cas was trying to find Metatron through his grace and he was pretty fucking determined, too.
Cas was the last one to shower the next day, mostly because he was the only one out of the four of them that didn't need to shower. Dean was just putting down a can of coffee on the table for Sam and Charlie, who was still getting ready for the day in her room, while his own cup rested already filled on a countertop. Namely the countertop he had been leaning against when he and Cas… well,
