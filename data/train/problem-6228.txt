“I fear that is not the most pressing concern.” She says, darkly, and Tony shivers from head to toe, going stiff as a statue, his entire body locking up in anticipation like he’s preparing for a physical blow, because he is so fragile at this point that anything
“Dr. Pym himself informed the media of the fact.” Vision explains, as if to reassure them. “It wasn’t a decision made by the Accords committee or by Secretary Ross in any form. Pym Technologies has removed its endorsement of Mr. Lang until further notice, although there are rumors of another suit being build. Not for Mr. Lang… but for Dr. Pym daughter, Dr. Van Dyne.”
“We should probably check in with the SHIELD personnel too.” Natasha reminds them, and before anyone can give any signs of confirmation, she’s on her feet and walking to the door with calm, but determined strides, a plan already set in motion. “We can all come back in a few hours to check-in”
It hurts, like a knife going straight through his heart, lurching like the ground is suddenly giving away beneath his feet.
“Pepper’s ok.” Tony says, hiding his sniffle behind a swipe of his hand over his itchy nose. “She’s on her way to the Compound. She’s ok. She didn’t—”
else. Tony can’t see anything but chaos and electric cables loose from the ceilings. Probably the only thing keeping this building up is the wing itself, and if it moves, they might have another problem on their hands.
The guy has lost a lot – the least he can do is to cut him some slack and give him some nice stuff. Maybe he’ll the present, the
“Then I wish you a safe journey, Captain.” The king says, simply. “And we will give you a safe place to return to, if you so decide.”
“Yeah, I guess so.” Steve concedes, if a little embarrassed by the fact. And his eyes gain a mischievous glint, and he even dares to tease Tony by saying, “You saying you’ve been to my exhibition at the museum, Mr. Stark?”
, like for the first time in who knows how long, maybe even the first time ever, he fully trusts Tony.
, to know that Thor insists on treasuring small things, like his relationship with Dr. Foster, or their team. The camaraderie that existed between them, before. It had been tentative, and, Tony knows now, not exactly what he thought it was, but it had its moments – and it’s startling, to realize that Thor, a god who literally has a weapon that has wounded Thanos before, is still
Steve wants to look into a mirror and not dread what he sees, in the beard on his face or the holes in his uniform. He wants to be that good man again, the man who isn’t haunted by the stupid, unthinking things that he did, the man who is more than Captain America, the man who is only Steve Rogers, and that’s
Pepper leans forward, and lays her head on his shoulder, forehead to his clavicle, and she feels warm, almost unnaturally so, even through the fabric of his shirt. It drags a strong, intense, almost all-consuming emotion from inside him, from beneath the thick layer of grief and sadness that is sinking into his stomach like an anchor, and it comes out of him like an eruption, past his lips in a trembling admittance before he can think twice, before he can control the raw vulnerability in his voice, before anything else.
“All you need to know is that this is Tony. Nothing else, Maria.” Howard quickly answers, giving her shoulders a reassuring squeeze. “It’s not important. No one knows about it, and it’s safer if you don’t know it either. But don’t worry. I’ve handled everything.”
“When Tony attacked…” Steve loses the battle raging inside of him, the cowardly, paranoid instinct to deflect being swallowed by the crashing waves of
“We take responsibility by assuming our mistakes as our own!” Steve yells. “We don’t always get it right! If we destroy something, we face the consequences! We don’t throw the blame around to run from it!”
, and if Tony didn’t know better, he’d think he’s about to get his ass kicked. “If you do this again, I swear I’m going to follow you into whatever hole you get yourself into and I’m going to kill you myself, you understand?”
denying that not all of that was the scepter’s fault. The things he said, the things he thought, that was all
“So what makes you believe this might be true?” Rogers lowers his head, the motion somehow making his gaze seem even sharper, even more piercing.
He’ll try. He’ll try harder and harder, because he has to get over this, he can’t stand another day of this doubt, of this ceaseless self-flagellation and punishment, because this is getting him
an accident. Their intentions might be noble but they still hurt those who pay the price, they might be sacrificing themselves but they
Her arm jerks up and Loki spares Thor a glance, lets himself take in the image of his brother safe before looking back at Amora and the gun she levels at him.
Just Natasha, alone, no longer privy to the truth. She shrugs it off as she digs into her pocket for the right amount of bills, just a little extra on the tip. She doesn’t have to worry about that, then. As long as she blends in, makes no waves, she should make it easily to Missouri.
“I get it, man,” Rhodey says, “there is a lot you’re gonna have to move around, man. I got this. What do you think, Viz, two days, tops? I’ll make it back in time for some PT and then I’ll get down to my part of the plans and the nitty-gritty. Sounds fair, right? Two days. You rest up, you practice your,” Rhodey flaps a hand towards Tony’s chest, “thingy, and then we get down to business.”
It's like a series of stills, with the words all out of place: darkness, Thor, Steve, Enchantress, Loki, blood, darkness, light, golden apples, golden hair, Steve, darkness; "Hlín protects you, the Valkyrie will guide you" they say and Tony wants to laugh because he was wrong, so wrong, he was wrong all along. He hears mad laughter and feels a hand run through his hair, whisper soothing words into the silence.
; he hadn’t expected the way Ross would automatically hone in on Siberia and crucify Tony in front of the Accords council during his hearing.
Tony’s hand yanks at the arc reactor. Steve watches the blue glow move with jerky tugs until it’s free, it’s out in the open air. Loki’s hand is already disabling the spell once more when Tony looks up at Steve, a single tear falling down his cheek. Steve freezes, numbed by fear. The building groans as a piece of wood from the ceiling cracks in two between them.
“I guess we all had our agendas.” Tony cryptically replies, an ugly smile on his face. “I had mine, Rogers had his. We couldn’t compromise.
Bucky stops in his tracks, looking up at him, his blue eyes wide and soft, just like he remembers from before. He smiles, slow and shy, with just a little hint of mischief, a smile that is so
“Yeah, and try to get me some information on what I was working on, If I asked you to save any holograms or schematics and the works, If I say anything out of the usual then mark that down, too.” Tony pauses for a moment, going over what he just ordered and nods. “Any interference, you get me, right?”
“I know you followed me,” Shuri says, smacking the Black Panther costume she has standing. She taps at her wrist to add in some numbers into her calculation, not enough kinetic energy absorption; if three-thousand and three-hundred newtons would break an ordinary man’s rib, add in the strength of the Panther…
Steve’s sitting next to Pepper who is sitting with a regal air about her, tears streaming ceaselessly though she remains stoic. Steve breaks a little more.
“How very astute, sir, although I should point out to you that I have a system message that claims that you were rendered unconscious for quite an amount of time.” It should be impossible for an AI to sound so smug. Why oh why does Jarvis sound so haughty? “I have studied the video monitoring of the workshop and have very meticulously analyzed every moment for any discrepancies in your attitude and typical mannerisms; any visual and audio inconsistencies have been drawn out of the feeds and put into a chronological timeline.”
"You wouldn’t be," Pepper starts, glare solidifying into something a little more sardonic and a little less kill-on-sight, "if you'd check your sources, but something tells me that's exactly what you're here about. Unfortunately, or at least fortunately enough for
Well Tony's alive enough to still do that, so that's a good sign. Steve relaxes a bit and presses his palm to Tony's thigh, against the bandage but he can't help but feel the heat though the two layers of cloth. The pressure is just a tad too much, however, and Tony groans and arches his back, bites his lip and sends Steve a beseeching look.
But the linger-er. The person, as her dad had so poetically put it, “lurking in the peripherals”, didn’t have that same MO. They seemed more willing to wait,
Steve shakes his head and clears the wave of fond nostalgia—a term not exactly associated with Steve Rogers and memories. Thinking back on the past, about Bucky and Peggy and Howard and the days that he had all but left behind hurt less this time around, the ever present ache in his chest that screamed that he didn’t belong, that
“You know who was my hero? Peggy Carter.” She softly admits. “I know it’s weird. The Russian spy, admiring the British-slash-American sweetheart? The
attached to his body, to his entire self, at this very moment. “The original plans involved a palladium core, but it wasn’t effective, and it was…”
“I myself don’t know exactly what Stormbreaker is made of.” Thor admits. “It’s different from my hammer. Different magic. I had to hold the star open myself, so the metal would melt, but it’s possible other magical components had been added to it before we arrived.”
“How am I still wearing pants?” Tony muses out loud, nonsensically, and then, a beat later – legitimately confused, even if he still sounds a little winded. And it’s a good question. When he thinks about it, he has woken up in a hospital enough times to know he should’ve been wearing one of those flimsy hospital gowns, not
Thor seems incredibly divided by their interaction, not sure if he should intervene or let them be, but in the end, he doesn’t say a word.
“Why sign it, then?” he asks, because he has to. He has to know. He’s not even sad or irritated, he’s curious, because he knows Natasha always has more reasons and more arguments and more opinions than any of them can ever dream of guessing. There is always something hidden, in her. He wondered, during all of it, during all the fight, if she saw something he didn’t. Something that could’ve prevented this. “You could’ve helped us stop it. Tony would’ve listened to you.”
Safe to show his cards, considering he doesn't know the game anyway. Pepper hums noncommittally. He waits, a few seconds, to see if she has anything to add or correct before continuing.
Seriously, Steve’s eyes where a bit far-away, as if thinking deeply about every word Tony said, his arms shaking a little, the slightest and Tony only felt it because his arms where still holding Tony, his body was still holding Tony up. Steve blinked his eyes a few times, the clear blue slowly losing its haze. He cleared his throat and shook his head, still a little stiff and tense but no longer quivering.
“No,” Tony agreed, “but this is also the same guy that brought VistaCorp and Zorick’s shady deals into the light would be the kind of guy to turn away from the elected voices of all the little people, you know.”
“End of the line,” Bucky says primly, pulling back with a watery smile. “I’m not… there’s no take-backs, punk.”
because he hasn’t slept right in the past week and a half? “I’m part of the Avengers, Steve, I’m coming.”
Each step is agony. There’s a shard of the Tesseract embedded in his bicep, a steady stream of blood dribbling down the length of his arm, gently dripping from his finger tips and onto the floor.
Still facing Tony, hands clenched tightly on the railings, she speaks: “I want you to tell no one about the suit. Not that I’m going to be forthcoming with any more details, of course. You’re a ghost. Anyone in your network hears that Tony is healthy and working on making the accords into something livable for other heroes, for others. Staunch any evidence on the contrary. Someone underground starts whispering that Tony was hurt and left for dead, let alone by
“You have the face of nothing but bad news,” Tony sighs, “nothing god destroyed while I was out, right?”
When Tony opens his eyes he feels like he’s seeing through a cloud of haze; someone else’s’ heavily prescribed lenses that cover his visage. There are fields of cotton in his mind just filling up the spaces and when he turns his head he can’t feel it; doesn’t feel the muscles pull and stretch, doesn’t feel the bones moving when he starts to sit up.
Like any other pragmatic, morose reality that is so nightmarish and lucid it can only be a fantasy, a hellish illusion of a dystopia that runs on its own, a worldwide rendition or Ray Bradbury’s
Wanda wants to comment that she meant the Raft, that being left at the Compound had been little more than house arrest, maybe, and although she would have liked the choice she couldn’t personally compare the two. But Clint is walking away already, face neutral after the viciousness it displayed not two seconds earlier. She feels cold, suddenly, and the headache returns with a strong sense of unease.
Steve takes a deep breath, puts on a neutral face, and then pushes the door with his shoulder to pry it open. Sam and Scott turn to him quickly from just beyond the bare doorway and then shift back to observing Wanda, who is out of his line of sight. Clint is leaning against the counter, seemingly contemplating. Clint raises a hand in greeting, and Steve shoves the door back into it's muddled frame.
She walks around the area seemingly aimlessly, listening to bits and pieces from the people milling about. She wonders if she would be able to track down Bruce to analyze some of the mass. When she gets closer to the dark mass, the hairs on her arm begin to raise. It feels like she is walking through static, light but there. Like walking through a wall of cobwebs, something…
Tony gasps as the dream-state wears off and the pain in his shoulder starts to set in. He’s lying across the floor, the armor in pieces on either side of his body, a sure sign of someone using the override code. The auditorium room is suddenly alight, shining down on Steve’s worried expression.
“Before we go in,” Tony taps a restless finger on the center of his chest, where the zipper is covering a good portion of the new reactor’s light. “If he asks, anything, about what we know about the-the… the others, what are you going to do?”
I'm going to try not to bash on any characters, but do note the character bias tag because although I'm trying to not do it, some of the characters will have an inherent bias. I'm trying to realistically lead up to Infinity Wars without the lazy excuse of skipping two whole-ass years (lmao did that bother anyone else??). Of course I'm trying to lead up to Infinity Wars, so some elements may be familiar to y'all.
” She shrieks and Loki grins, hands shaking, bleeding, burnt and fragile with the tissues almost charred through.
Tony falters. He looks at the apple, at the smooth texture of gold wrapped around this forbidden fruit; knowledge lays on his palm, innocuous and innocent. He can’t, he thinks, this is impossible, and when he opens his eyes he will run off to the street and take a long walk because
“Yes, Master Steven.” The AI pipes up and the room fills with Tony’s murmuring. Steve’s heart clenches at the low, familiar whispers.
(“No bodies were found,” Peter announces to the Avengers in the main room on the first floor. Their babbling stops immediately. “As in, neither Amora’s nor Tony’s body was at the site when the rubble was removed.”
“You, uh,” Steve rubs the back of his neck and Tony, god, he’s just a sappy fool behind the mask, just another idiot with a thing for men in uniform because he feels a touch of heat spread through his body at the awkwardness because it’s Steve and the damn Capsicle is sexy when he’s doing anything and everything (because Tony might be a kinky man but his biggest fetish can only be labeled as “Steve” and fuck he’s so far down the rabbit hole that it’s no use denying anything). “You fell asleep on the couch and everyone just sort of vacated so I brought you to your room”
“Not yet, sir. We have had some accidental sightings but she seems to be moving rather quickly and in no recognized pattern as of yet. Master Stevens, as you have lain awake for several minutes, would you like me to get your coffee in progress as well?”
“No, you’re not, Tony. Don’t even think about trying to prove otherwise; I’m going back to meet the rest of the team, and when we come back--”
“Are you saying that the National Security Council is on the case?” Tony replies, leaning back in his chair to look at Ross. “Because, as I understand,
“Oh, honey,” Missouri smiles as she pats Tony’s cheek, so intimate and close for only knowing him for the hour they talked, “you’re never alone. I can bet that there are already a number of people that depend and rely on you, and care for you. In fact, I can name one that would be completely lost without you.” Her smile is devious, teasing.
in just a year and a few scant weeks. I think the last report I even heard of had it at something like thirty-five percent habitable, and that was with Stark,
Steve will see the arc reactor, be immediately disgusted, repulsed, then he’ll be looking at Tony with
“Oh, damn I knew I should have paid more attention to my Mythology 110 class in Uni, I knew  it, sitting there half asleep thinking to myself ‘I should pay attention because one day I’ll be fighting these things in a metal suit along with a super-soldier, a Norse god, a photographer and a Russian Assassin’.” Tony sighs and continues on his path to find Peter somewhere among the blurred and rapidly fluctuating signals his armor depicts.  “Point is, do you know how to stop them?”
They didn’t speak for another few minutes, driving within the city boundaries towards the rural neighborhood the incident occurred in. When the young man pulls over and parks the car, Natasha makes to unbuckle herself.
"Actually, I don’t think you even know who I am," Pepper snorts, taking a delicate seat on the coffee table in front of Fury. "I'm the woman that kept Tony Stark alive while he went out to save
She had been caught in the nightmares for as long as she’d been out of the Raft. Even then, even now, she could feel the fuzziness in her mind trying to reclaim her into fitful rest.
There’s a puzzle here. A bigger picture. Tony’s just not looking at it at the right angle, something is wrong, just… not there. He sighs, closes his eyes.
” Tony’s snide tone seems to make some modicum of patience in Steve crumble to dust because suddenly he’s all but straddling Tony, tugging at the bottom of his shirt with barely any force, seemingly afraid to rip the stained and worn t-shirt.
is leave him alone.  See, there’s something that gets at him when villains have him kidnapped.  There’s another when he’s alone with his greatest and most vile foe, the one that knows all of his secrets, his regrets, all of the guilt that gnaws at the final remnants of his sanity.
Light steps. Sneaking. Short figure. More compact, a subtle heaviness through muscle mass. Some kind of armory, judging by the not-natural sound of their clothes as the person came closer to inspect her.
“Uhm, what?” Tony finally says after a few seconds of deliberation. Peter only opens his un-squished eye to give Tony what is, admittedly, the best one-eyed unamused look possible while face-planting a cushion. “No don’t give me that look I’ve had a hard day and I was actually busy doing
clings to her skin. Cameras face the mound conspicuously; on walls, posts freshly created within the weeks the anomaly had been there. Men in riot gear stand around, watching all the people.
“Yes,” he says, although he knows he doesn’t need to, “this is how I know that the others… are in Sokovia.”
Apparently knowing what to do and actually getting it done are two completely different, sentient and horribly difficult things. Who would have guessed?
Pepper had still been speaking as Fury thought back to that mission report, filed and forgotten. Probably somewhere in the internet, if Stark hadn’t gotten it scrubbed yet. “…why we need this to work. Those idiots may not listen to a coalition of countries, and probably think that the world will need them again as a way to clean their slate, so to speak. But that’s not how international laws work, the Sokovia Accords
He was so tired. A kind of soul-deep weariness that forced his eyes to turn from the spectacular sights of the futuristic city, the thought
It was all in his writing, though; there was no mistaking that. Somehow he had ended up spending a good four hours crumbling papers and writing about planetary travels. That didn’t seem to be completely true, though. Still, Tony would have to wait until Jarvis was done sifting through a good fourteen hours of video and sound feed. Tony sighed, picked up the model that he had, apparently, made the night before, and studied his handiwork.
of various machines in the numerous rooms. The tower is starting to feel like a home, except when devoid of Avengers, and the walls have started to adapt the smell of smoke and excitement; the kitchen, at the end of the hallway, is radiating the aroma of coffee and comfort and warmth.
Wanda looks at Scott through her haze. She actually hadn’t known that about the other man. Had only known that he suited up when Steve asked, so she had trusted him to watch her back. Actually, she hadn’t known that about the Accords, either.
“Sorry ‘bout that. Hardly any sleep and, you know,” Tony flapped his hand up and down, as if to say ‘
Loki snaps out of his reverie as Tony shouts out his name. In less than a second Loki is twisting his body around Thor’s, just as the bigger Asgardian lurches forward in an attempt to protect Loki from the click of the gun.
“Tony,” Rhodey sighs, shifting to ease some of the pressure off the upper part of his thigh, “the guy was a fanboy through and through. Cap told him to come and the idiot just left. You heard the ex-wife, just popped up in the middle of dinner and booked it. You don’t need to parse through the information to understand
Tony hesitates for a moment, still looking over the tools and notes on the work counter before hefting a heady sigh. “Is he gone yet?” There’s a momentary lapse of silence before Jarvis responds.
“Of course I am; I notice everything you do!” Steve shouts back in retaliation. There’s a light flush on his cheeks but when
Fury takes a second to swallow the threat. Pepper Potts, although intimidating in her own right, is no assassin, as she had said. But there was something in her words, something tinged with a different flavor of manic, that made him hesitate.
, sir. Would you like me to start on breakfast? The rest of the house-mates are up and awake at the moment.”
Iron Man, he would always puzzle on the elusive, and quite crude, sarcastic and eccentric CEO. Oftentimes he would be directed straight to the red-and-gold plated “bodyguard” when he started asking some of the questions on his mind to the bountiful S.H.I.E.L.D. agents about the Stark Corporation Chairman. Iron Man would simply stare at him with those glowing blue eyes, silent; Steve honestly thought that the machine didn’t have a voice modulator whatsoever.
“They do, Steve, and now they will come.” Wanda closes her eyes. Squeezes the bottle in her hand. She can still feel the two men, though, knows they are looking at each other in bafflement. “And we only have enough time to leave before they start imagining a trail.”
Sorry for the maudlin Steve. It's gonna hurt before there's some comfort... and the universe is far more expansive than we know.

only darker, deadlier and slower; the world is slowly dying, bleeding out as the plague works its way from one ocean to another, through continent to continent—the

"Did I...was I wrong?" Tony whispers and his body slides down so he's sitting, back against the frame and his head is tilted back, his eyes wistful and slightly sad.

They lay in bed together for a few more hours; Steve sleeps and Tony, for once, simply basks in the silence and the comfort and the warm weight of the arm draped across his waist. He remains silent, almost brooding, thinking only of the morning and the unexpected
“Did you aid the fugitive Avengers Clint Barton, Sam Wilson, Wanda Maximoff, and Scott Lan in their escape?” Ross demands and Rhodey had the misfortune to rise his cup of water to his lips at the same moment and chokes. Vision remains impassive in the face of Ross’s increasing agitation and—
“You want to talk about responsibility? Ok.” Natasha says, and Steve immediately knows he somehow stepped on a landmine without noticing. “Tell me, Cap, how exactly are you taking responsibility for those buildings we destroyed in Germany? In Sokovia? In Washington? New York? What are you doing to make that easier on everyone else besides
, of all things.” Tony says, dramatically, hoping it’s not obvious that he is, in fact, genuinely a little offended.
That means Tony has plenty of time alone with his thoughts, which is the last thing he wants right now.
He turned himself in— And they haven’t heard from him since. He didn’t expect anything different, honestly, it happened exactly as he thought he would. It’s not like Scott can simply pick up a phone and call them without giving away their position; But Steve is worried. Of course he is. Ever since he went back, the news channels have been discussing them non-stop. They won’t let Scott say a word, so almost everything being said is speculation and guessing, but that’s no reason to not pay attention. It’s the first time in
“I apologize.” Thor mutters, heartfelt, letting his hand slip heavily from Tony’s shoulder in a lazy, exhausted glide, when Tony fails to provide any response. “I don’t mean to sound discouraging. I’m sure Miss Potts—”
Rhodey throws his hands up as he slowly ambles towards the same couch Tony is lying on. The braces along his legs give a slight whirr-click when he sits, legs flat and stretched out. Rhodey’s knee—brace and all, knocks into Tony’s in a motion too deliberate to be accidental.
It’s slightly surreal seeing them two in a different light, even if that point of view is just the corner camera.
"A man who will shortly arise from his exhaustion to confront a problem that has tormented mankind since the beginning of time. A man who knocked on a door seeking sanctuary and found, instead... [there's an] ancient folk saying: 'You can catch the Devil, but you can't hold him long." -Rod Serling, episode 2x5 ("The Howling Man")
“Hey look at me—it’s Steve. You know me, Tony. Do you remember me?” Steve tries to make Tony focus but feels his friend relapsing into unconsciousness. “Tony! Do you know who I am?” Steve repeats, one hand holding Tony’s chin up, the other flat and scorching against the mechanic’s cheek.
“I could sense her presence, yes, much more keenly than others. And it was less fear than…” Vision thinks for a second, searching for words. “How Natasha instinctively looks for exits. The way you break down and rebuild, at least in your mind, the technology around you. Safety. Comfort.”
Ignorance, no, utter defiance of higher powers had caused the pestilence. Folly had been the start of the war, not human, mortal irrationality but that of a woman, not human but just as greedy, just as vain. She caused the tides of war to turn; she single-handedly wiped out the heroes that could stop her before they caught wind of her plans; she simply wanted
Steve had only smiled down at his hands, and then found himself pulled into Bucky by one arm for a long hug. Steve had tensed for only a second before he raised his arms and wrapped them around Bucky in return.
“I am Frigga, wife of Odin and mother to Thor and his other half-brothers.” She smiles as Steve visibly tenses. “I know you have experiences a difficult loss, Steven, and I know that the wound is still fresh and festering but there is always a silver lining. A life lost in good spirit is not in vain; and despite what a young man once told me, a hero never dies. Not truly, at least. They are resurrected in the afterlife or brought back by the mercy of the gods. A great man once told me that he was not a hero. Tell me, Steve, what makes a hero?”  Frigga has a knowledgable shine in her eyes but Steve is still caught up in the words she whispers.
Any questions? Leave me a comment and I'll answer :D (I went and got into some mythology and started getting too in-depth ^^; Sorry!)
“You’re not thinking about leaving me in there, are you?” Steve huffs, half-amused and half-serious.
Steve huffs and shakes his head with a fond little glint in his eyes, disbelieving. “You’re not funny, Tony.” Steve gives a little quirk of his lips and Tony feels that little spark look to ignite. “Well, what if I’m not adverse to either?” Steve’s grin is nothing but filthy and Tony kind of wants to rub himself against it. Preferably naked.
It smells like ozone, though, and amaranths. Steve thinks Tony wouldn’t have gone out any other way.
“Gracias,” she says and she turns to walk to the bar at a reasonable pace. The woman is making her rounds to the booths first, then the tables. Natasha hasn’t noticed that she hasn’t touched any of her food until the woman goes up to the bar. Natasha turns a bit as she asks the woman next to Natasha. Her cart has extra metal bars running across the handles: the top has rosaries of black stone, the second with necklaces wrapped just enough for about an inch of jingle space with small black stones pierced through with a metal bit that holds it as a pendant; all around the bottom are zip-tied bottles of fine black ash, all presumably from the mound just yards away.
“What is it, Jarvis?” Tony groans, wanting nothing more than to slink further into the sheets, wait for Steve to return to consciousness and maybe have a few more rounds in the dark. Despite what he wants, though, Tony knows that Jarvis’ interruption is nothing less than important and pertinent to the visions and the Enchantress.
Slowly, so nerve-wrenchingly slowly, Tony turns eyes unsure. Steve breathes in sharply, opens his mouth and—

“Jarvis, reroute the message, try to triangulate the signal, remove the attachment to S.H.I.E.L.D. if you have to, I’m getting ready.” Tony shouted as he looked around the piles of boxes and tools for the suitcase. With a little ‘ah ha!’ under his breath, Tony drops the suitcase and kicks the handle, causing it to pop open. He slides his feet into the boots, presses up and the rest of the armor automatically begins to click into place, climbing up higher and higher on his body, Tony locks the gauntlets into place and soon, in a span of barely a few seconds, he’s fully sheathed in his armor.
he hears so much of is easy to deduce, then. Someone that is strong, check. Honorable? Check.  Resilient? Check. Self-sacrificing? Double check.
(After the initial bout of nausea, Steve needs a moment to make sure his organs have stopped trembling before he can even think about moving his limbs and Thor just laughs, so heartily and boisterous Steve forgets to be sad. Forgets that things aren't actually alright.)
“I can put a block, if you want,” Missouri smiles softly, taking Tony’s hand in her warm grasp. They’re at the front door, Tony on the threshold. It must be symbolic, Tony thinks numbly, being on this precipice of the strange and unusual, the fantastic and real and the madness that awaits outside.
, you can only wish to warm the beds of warriors such as us! You not unfit for anything other than to become one with the ashes of Niflheim, as Hel’s footstool!” Enchantress shouts and she raises her hands, eyes flashing, hair billowing behind her shoulders. “Leave, like the little coward you are, and you shall suffer from no injury.”
Sam watches as Wanda retreats, keeping note of her uneven wobble He spares Steve a glance—the man hasn’t raised his head, the only reaction he’d shown so far that he is even listening is the growing tenseness of his shoulders as everyone continued to speak.
“Twenty minutes, then. I’ll call Foster to let her know to expect us, it’s, what, eleven over there? If she’s anything like any other scientist I know, she’ll be up and running still.”
The pendants are fake, that far she knows. The rock that is outside is not shiny, dulled and a little sandy to the touch. When she motions at the rosary, the woman raises a single brow in question.
By the time Steve is finished cleaning them both up, Tony’s shifted under the covers and his breaths have evened out. Suspecting the other to be asleep, Steve curls himself more firmly around the other, closes his eyes and whispers into the air.
With a splitting headache and a long suffering sigh, Tony reverses the video feeds and opens a new window. He has some names to look up and some myths to relearn.
, Thor whispers to Steve, like a secret, as if the world wasn’t just ending. Steve swallows the pain, the questions like a bitter pill stuck in his throat and closes his eyes, thinks of the rain
It hurts much more than it probably should. Tony doesn’t respond, or maybe can’t, judging by the size of the stone that’s stuck in his throat. He would like to shout—boy, that’d make him feel better, or maybe just sulk but Tony Stark, Iron Man, billionaire-playboy philanthropist engineer does not sulk, contrary to popular belief. So, instead, Tony wills the knot in his throat to unwind, pushes his nails into his palms and watches Steve’s retreating back, waits for the faint echo of his boots on the linoleum to disappear completely and then rises to his own feet. There are notes and half-completed drawings of something that looks like the arc reactor but at a larger and less complex scale. There’s a hunk of metal, some adapter cables, a car battery (Tony’s gaze carefully avoids this object the rest of the observation) and some copper coils amidst the crumpled papers.
“Sure thing,” Natasha says with a smile as she hopes over the sidewalk. They raise their hands in goodbye and when Natasha looks at the bundle in her hand she snorts at the sight of her two bills folded together behind Aaron’s business card.
“In Asgard, there is no better death than to fall in battle.” Thor booms, grinning and slapping a hand against Tony’s back. “To my people, death is another adventure.”
Wanda opens her eyes. Scott is listening to Steve as Steve relays what is going on outside: Clint is strengthening the signal while Sam talks to someone in the headset; so far and no longer using the main speaker, it is harder for Steve to listen but apparently it is good news.
,” Rhodey says leaning back to rest the back of his head on the back cushions. “He’s gonna ask to do something and the absolutely best way to butter me up is by being respectful and pulling rank. What’s up, Viz?”
“Wait—who is it for, then?” Shuri asks, turning around. The presence has gone, she notices, and when she looks through her lab she doesn’t see anything out of the ordinary at first. She rolls her eyes;
“Any word on Enchantress yet?” Tony groaned as the necessity to fully rouse from the sinful comfort of the bed increased.
!” She hisses as the portal purses its lips shut. “Dammit, Loki, you traitor, you said that they would remain under my control!”
The city of Laurence, Kansas is a quiet one, despite a tumultuous history and some odd-goings.  The greatest threat to their little communal peace was a family fire back in the late eighties and a supposed haunting a good few years later.  There’s a residential market, a few old school Mama’s and Papa’s type stores and a community psychic,
“Mister Stark,” Vision says, coming closer. “You’ve been in and out of consciousness since you first woke up yesterday morning. As of yesterday, we have had no sign of Natasha Romanov, Secretary Ross is being pressured by the President to declassify his files and release messages to the public about his correspondence during what the media is calling the ‘Civil War’. It seems… something has occurred that may have messed with your plans.”
“I just, you looked uncomfortable,” Steve mumbles, looking ever-so-awkward as he scrunches his features to look at Tony.
“I believe I have located something, sir.” Jarvis says and Tony groans, feels the lovely ache at the base of his spine, the faint tenseness of his muscles, the creaking of his bones. Steve is still sleeping in bed behind Tony and the man grunts, face scrunching, but doesn’t wake up. Tony sighs and slumps back into the bed, throwing an arm across his eyes.
The waitress that approaches the table is not the one that refilled her coffee seven minutes and twenty seconds ago. When the young woman places a folded receipt on the table without a comment, Natasha gives it a few more bites of what is left of her meal before opening the receipt casually.
playing across in monochromatic suspense. Of course Peter is the first to enter, yawning and stretching his way into the kitchen.
Sure enough, with a slow push of the door and a quick glance, there was a woman in the room with Loki; Loki was… indisposed, bound by some sort of white light around his wrists above his head. The more common jade sweater was riding up because of the stretching due to the binds, the dark blue jeans riding a little low and there was a perfectly purple bruise on his cheekbone, matching perfectly with his busted lip. There was a fire in his eyes, a deep hatred that scared Tony, and if looks could kill the woman would be combusting by now.
one of your little misfit miscreants," Pepper grinds out, pushing off the doorway and stalking closer to the aloof ex-director. "I am
It takes what feels like only a few minutes to get to the main palace where Thor is cheered and greeted like a modern day celebrity. The introductions move in a blur, people calling Steve "A Warrior of Time" and "The Great Captain" and he only murmurs his greetings by reflex.
“I think they want to ask us something. I used the ants for surveillance, just to the alleyway and I think they’ve been… waiting.”
Tony can’t say he’s surprised. It takes a lot of damage to start the Ragnarok. He just hopes he can get everything in place before the deaths start, too. Stark tower is surprisingly quiet, now; Tony thinks that the crew probably all left for the S.H.I.E.L.D debriefing he was supposed to go to but there are bigger fish to fry.

“What about immobilizing him?” Lang proposes, alternatively. “Trapping him in one of those things, like a big cage or something?”
And then, he stops. His horrified internal rant just… stops. Because Tony suddenly notices he still hasn’t asked one question, the question he fears the most, the one he thinks will probably break him one way or another, no matter what answer he might receive.
you, you know that, right?” He then asks, with an arched brow. “If it had been me. I would have beaten
Vision looks at the hand for a second, almost as if he’s a little startled by the gesture, before he raises his head determinedly and closes his hand around Steve’s in a firm handshake, leaving absolutely no doubts on
laying a gentle kiss on her knuckles before holding it between his own protectively. “I’ll see you soon.”
“Then I won’t stop you.” He repeats. "I can't blame you for wanting to be with him. You can go. We'll be close if you need us."
Steve can feel the way Nat and Sam both tense up, just like him, by the brush of their shoulders against his. Steve’s heart begins to race, beating loudly and painfully in his chest, hammering against his ribcage, like a bird desperate to find an open window, only to find itself trapped forever in a too small confinement.
“Natasha” Steve calls, urgently, pulling her away from Clint, and Natasha interprets his tense shoulders and whispering voice as a sign of imminent threat, because she goes stiff immediately, her hand flying to her knives.
“It’s better if I don’t have it.” Rogers says, surprisingly mellow, and Tony is idiotic enough to look back at him again, like he can’t help it. “T’Challa’s shield was Vibranium, I couldn’t bring it out of Wakanda.”
“Why would I make it worse for Tony?” Steve asks, and he doesn’t know if he is saying it as a rhetorical question or a supplication for help. He’s not quite sure how he sounds right now. “Why would I do that to him?”
JARVIS voice does not startle him, because it was never really gone, was it? Vision had inherited it. At first it had been painful, but the exposure throughout the years had made the scars easier to bear, a almost conforming knowledge that his creation would live on, even if in another form, and at the end of the day, Tony would never begrudge his AI for
“You are welcome to stay if you like, Captain.” T’Challa offers him, his tone incredibly gentle, but in a way that makes Steve feel respected, not coddled. He feels like T’Challa is giving him an opening he doesn’t usually offers people, and Steve appreciates the king’s help. It certainly is very noble of him. “We will be completely responsible for James Barnes’ security and health, as I promised. There is no need for you to worry.”
information. That’s how JARVIS kept himself hidden when Ultron attacked. So we – there’s still a couple of things here and there we can check that he
You see, there's way too many things that bother me about CW for me to keep quiet. And once I started writing Wanda, this chapter just wrote itself, really. It might sound odd to you, the fact that I got a bit sidetracked writing about Wanda when this is supposed to be a chapter about Bucky, but I hope I can show you how important the analysis of Wanda's story is to my interpretation of Steve's character. As I've previously mentioned in the comments (once again, if you haven't read them yet, I encourage you to do it, because there's a lot going on in there as well. You're gonna have fun, I promise.), Wanda and Bucky share a very similar story - and so, Steve reacts to them in a very similar manner. The thing is: Steve has a longer history with Bucky, and being so, he is much more protective of him. Making Steve realize how his decisions impact Bucky's life and perception of self in a quick fashion would take a very extreme and very specific set of circumstances, which I'm not willing to create here, as this is a Canon Compliant work - and when I say extreme, I mean extreme. Something that simply doesn't fit the narrative created by the MCU canon. It's a shortcut that comes at a very high price, the price of cutting almost all character development in favor of one single problem, which is an inefficient and unsatisfying solution. So we're not gonna do that.
Tony isn’t really thinking anymore. Not for full moments. The nagging pain in his left arm is starting to make itself known, the stress of being alert and deflating, over and over, his heart speeding with adrenaline in so many alternate spikes over such a short span of time a strain too great for his battered body. He digs his fingers into his eyes, wishing he could just wipe away the exhaustion and strain off them, wishing he could go to sleep and let this all be a nightmare.
“I dun’ wanna get up it’s too early for this shit,” Tony grumbles and whines but it’s no use; someone’s holding him in a fireman hold and it’s still too damn comfortable to be considered carrying or Tony’s finally hit his hibernation mode that’s been long overdue.
“Curse you… untie…I will kill you!” More familiar; Loki, angry and cursing. Wait—Loki and who else? If Loki was making death threats then maybe…
“Right now, you’re being stubborn. You’re a liability, Tony, and if you are there on the frontline with us and you get hurt I-I…” Steve trails off as he stands, runs a hand through his dirty blonde hair and finally looks at Tony once more. “You’re staying here. That’s an order.”
and if someone was a user they’d have to get clean…” Scott wipes a weary hand across his face. Sam turns back to Wanda, to her ashen complexion, the tattered blankets weighing her down despite the fever, how she wakes up cold and delirious.
He goes to Tony’s workshop with the not so false pretense of talking about his uniform, to go over some ideas for a new, stealthier version of his current one, and it unsurprisingly makes Tony talk for nearly hours on end, excited and electric, his leg bouncing up and down in unconscious impatience to start.
Steve burns with fury. Not because of Bucky – no, never -, but because of everything that’s happened
These people, for fuck's sake, none of them were ready for it – they all look like they could have been staff here, at most, common people, except for one man who might have been security, with a strong build and fierce eyes, but who is holding a woman that seems to be
But whenever they fight about something else, about something like… Something like Wanda, or Ultron, or the Accords, something that divides them not by their strategy, but by their
“I don’t know.” Clint says. “I know he’s not here to bring us back. From what I can tell, no one knows he’s here. He doesn’t actually have permission to be here.”
I did warn you we would come back to this. And we're not done with her, mind you, but it feels like this is the right place to start.

, hoping his discomfort can pass off as arrogance or, at the very least, nonchalance. “We might still have food around. We can’t go overboard and eat everything before we bring people back here, but there might be enough for all of us to have something.”
As expected, it makes Barton bristle like an angry cat. It’s visible how it pains him to be restrained. “I would like to, yeah. Can we—?”
The awareness of their surroundings comes crashing down on him, the sounds flooding back into his ears, and his cowardice, his holdups against being vulnerable in front of Rogers or any of the others, it all gets pushed to the corner of his mind as he sees how awful Agent Ross looks, with deep, dark circles under his eyes, his usually gentle and approachable expression clouded by worry, and the strong grip Carter has around her holster is more than enough evidence for her tension, even if her face betrays nothing but steely determination.
Maybe that’s the only thing he truly wants now. The only thing that keeps him going. He could make an argument that’s not just that – he’d do it for Pepper, he’d come back for her so they can try again once it’s all over, because he loves her and he does want to marry her, even with all their flaws; or maybe he can say he’ll do it just because it’s the right thing to do, because no one deserved to fall victim to the workings of a guy like Thanos, and as a hero, it is his duty, his

to him. Maybe Tony is trying to prove a point. Tony can be like that, sometimes. Maybe won’t call until Scott’s sentence has been reduced or completely abolished, just so he can rub it in Steve’s face.
“And now you can come stay with me and make some explosions.” Stark joyfully says, clapping Doctor Banner on the back, as if exploding things is his idea of a fun time. “Everybody wins. What about you, Point Break?”
Agent Carter raises her eyebrows after a long blink, but then an almost imperceptible smile pulls at the corner of her lips, and her eyes spark with an intense emotion; and with one final nod and parting thanks, she goes too, lingering for the briefest of seconds, throwing a glance in Rogers’ direction in a way that is not at all very subtle, a low sense of curiosity, but Rogers only nods at her and she accepts this, her hair wiping gracefully as she turns away, her strides large and sure as she walks towards Agent Ross.
“Yeah, I have a question.” Barton interrupts, frowning. “If there was a super powerful stone or whatever inside that scepter, where did Loki find that thing?”
“Which would give us a bigger advantage.” Tony blinks owlishly, feeling like the floor has just been ripped from under him. “
, and we need to find Thanos before it all runs out. What can we do, if we go out there? These people have nowhere to go. Nowhere is safe. The only way to make it safe is to get that Gauntlet, and only way to make it faster is to go back, and work on it so we can fix this.”
Tony tried to convince May Parker to come back to the Compound with him. He really, really tried. It seemed… it wasn’t right to leave her
It was odd, but Tony respects the guy’s privacy. Everyone needs their alone time, and Tony suspects Steve might need his more than most – the future, the
And it’s very nice of her, it really is— but Steve is not really listening. She brings him all the way down to the lab, and makes him stand there as she brings in the—
for Thor to finish his speech before he hears the actual part that he needs to know to make sense of this. “What did you see?”
“Then how did it happen? Because it did!” Steve points to nowhere, just because he feels the need to keep himself moving, to make himself seem larger and imposing, because he’s
, and T’Challa’s sister could give much more, much faster than he could. But something about contacting her in such an invasive way make shim feel unbalanced, uneasy, and maybe the support of the others would help. Who knows.
Maybe that had impacted his relationship with Vision. Okay, who is he kidding, it definitely had. Ultron, and Wanda, and JARVIS’ death, it all piled up in a way Tony simply couldn’t see past for a long while. Him stepping back probably hadn’t helped, now that he thinks about it – how much could have Vision felt, about his absence? It almost seemed impolite to ask, in retrospect. But he wondered, because he always did. How much had the Stone made him
In unsteady steps, he and the Guardian wobble towards Quill’s ship, away from sight, relocated to a place where Thanos couldn’t see it when he arrived. The way to it seems even longer now, not by his slow, dragging steps, but for the empty spaces by his side, by the lack of a presence that should be there, and Tony can
But Tony doesn’t have any problem with Captain America. Not any more than he already had by the time he was twenty.
“Are you okay?” Rogers asks, after his hand has retreated for long enough that Tony should not be as taken aback as he is anymore, but as his brain starts to come back online, he sees the tightly woven tension in Rogers’ muscles, his hurt, but concerned and baffling sincere eyes, the look only heightened by the somber aura the beard and the long hair give him.
She is, after all, the Black Widow, and she is much more skilled in stealth than Steve could ever hope to be. He’s not sure if she’s actively hiding from him or just wandering around gathering intel as she always does, but he wouldn’t put past her to be; But he doesn’t really care right now. Steve paces through the halls practically stomping, his body feeling way too heavy for him to control how imposing and furious he looks, his mind too preoccupied to bother about it.
he thinks to himself, as he only remembers seeing them act inside the US territory. But who knows how long that will last? What if they refuse? Will they be thrown in the Raft like his friends, because they didn’t comply?
And Tony hugs him back fiercely, slotting his chin at the slope of Rhodey’s shoulder, uncaring if his unkempt goatee will scrape his neck or face, and
He can hear the presence of another being close by, by a soft, light breathing, and the sound of crinkly fabric and scratches of sand under boots. That blue thing, he recalls, the one who looked half alien and half robot, the one who came from nowhere and attacked Thanos, who asked for
“Great to see you too.” Tony pats him on the shoulder - all muscle, just like the rest of him now - and pretends he’s not shaking. “How long has it been?”
“You know… I haven’t spoken to Jane in years. Not after we – separated. I can only hope she is okay, and she’s out there, alive.” Thor says, unexpectedly, and it catches Tony off guard how he is
“I modified it, after a while.” He says, both to their comfort and his own, to keep himself following a logic, following memories of numbers and equations, not – not even for one
After Bucky pulled him out of the Potomac, Steve didn’t see him anymore. But he looked for him – oh,
Tony had never thought about Barton’s status as an Avenger, or either of their statuses, if he’s being honest. He never thought it was something he should question, and if it was, he would probably be the last one to make such inquiries, considering that
And it makes him feel terrible, it really does, because this is… This is the worst thing that could have happened. He can wish as much as he wants to that this didn’t happen, but it did, and now everything feels wrong. But more than anything, he regrets bringing Clint and Scott into this. Because of their families. Steve knows Clint understands the need to prioritize the mission, that he is a soldier, just like Steve, deep down in his chest, but Steve’s not
, the pain blooming in his chest and bleeding towards the limb, like motor oil leaking through the tubes, and he holds it with his other hand, grip painfully tight, until his fingers turn pale.
Tony is still for a second too long, frozen and distant, and Dum-E makes an inquiring noise, turning his claw at him.
“I trust you’ve seen the news of Mr. Lang’s trial.” Is what he says after his polite greetings, all good-hearted words and kind demeanor, Wanda immediately by his side with a smile on her face.
; But no one really is, isn’t it? But he’s alive. Tony hadn’t been sure, because Bruce’s and Mantis’ accounts contradicted themselves, and by now, Tony is constantly expecting the worst. But Thor made it, and Tony happy to know it. He and Tony had never been close, definitely not enough to hug it out like Rhodey and Bruce have, but Tony cares about him, and wishes he wasn’t going through this as much as everyone else.
, he has no permission to trespass. Besides that, for all intents and purposes, he will be a free man.”
Bruce looks like he wants to argue, but he shakes his head forcefully, trying to dispel dark thoughts, and nods firmly, injecting his voice with strength. “You’re right. It’s true, you’re right.”
A projection shows up in front of them, from the sensors on the floor next to the bar, where they used to watch the finals when they were all together in the common lounge. Days long gone, now. The blue hue of the screen matches the one in Tony’s chest, bathing the entire room in a soft, candid color, and Nebula gives a step back so she can focus better on the images, standing literally right by Tony’s side as FRIDAY gives the final report.
, Wanda apparently messing with Tony’s mind inside the HYDRA base, something that Steve had never known, and now he doesn’t know how to feel about it. He could have accused him from the mess with the Accords, too. Accused him of being blinded by his grief, of not considering the repercussions the Accords would have—
she gets it, and the gasp that escapes her is so loud it hurts her throat, breath catching painfully in her lungs.
“Tony is a benefactor, not an owner.” Natasha explains, her tone dry, her expression cloudy. “Cap’s shield is government property. So are your wings. And Clint’s bow, and my Bites, and pretty much everything in the Compound. Everything that was once under SHIELD’s ownership, basically.”
And he doesn’t mean to sound like a petty teenager who didn’t got what he asked for his birthday, but that’s just how it comes off, and it’s too late to stop now. He’s said it, he’s bitter, and he can’t hide it, apparently. If he had the courage to tell them, to pry open his heart and explain in detail what happened, he wonders if they would understand – if Nebula, who once only knew to process her loss and abandonment by seeking violence against the sister who left her, instigated by her captor, or if Rocket, who holds Nebula’s arm and whose eyes go misty at the mention of the idea of family, if he could explain to them what exactly the Avengers had meant to him before they all fell apart like a house of cards, if they would understand. Tony knows what they’re trying to do, and in some other moment, maybe, he would at least have commended them for being clever, for—
Can he really let go of the guilt and pretend everything is fine, that he can’t fight anymore, and let it go?
to believe Wanda could somehow show them visions of the future. Though the Chitauri had been long gone when the images where put inside his brain, the memory of Ebony Maw’s ship descending into New York like a reckoning is still fresh, and his fears of a future alien invasion were proven true. And all this talk of wormholes and aliens – Tony can still see them in his mind’s eye, the deep blue hue of space being split open to allow their home to be torn to shreds.
He wasn’t ready for it because it wasn’t an attack. It wasn’t a knife coming down on his back, a kick to his face, a hand to his throat. It’s not someone screaming at him. It’s not a person who is
“We should have brought some of Princess Shuri’s beads.” Bruce says, but it doesn’t sound like he’s talking to anyone in particular, just himself. “Or anything, really. Her equipment is still working, if we could use it—”
Nebula looks like she might be imploding, just a little bit, and after a beat, instead of yelling at him – as she
, to know that Tony isn’t so incomprehensible after all, that maybe Steve can get them a little closer, maybe into a real friendship. Maybe this is the way to know the real Tony Stark – not to push him, but to meet him in the middle.
In the silence, their descent is even more disturbing. By the time they reach the third floor, the amount of
When I say it could have worked out, I mean it. If they had more time. If they had the chance to tap out. They could have made it. I think we all know that.
We’ve done what we can, we’ll support her, we’ll help her if she need to. But if she says she needs to try something on her own,
He stops abruptly as if startled, cradling his mug between his hands with surprising care. He seems to hesitate for a second, his toes wriggling on the cold floor,
“Barnes loves me too much.” Tony says, and Wilson full-on snorts, the sound echoing in his cup as he takes a sip. “What? He does. We all know that his problem with me was because he secretly loved me and totally not because I broke his arm on PE once.”
Shame is a feeling Tony is very well acquainted with. Bruce too. Though most of Tony’s shame is no one’s fault but his own, Tony’s pat on his shoulder and the colluding whispers of
“Inside the scepter.” Tony breathes, the electric feeling of understanding washing through him in a thrilling pulse, adrenaline pumping in his veins. “FRIDAY, pull up my notes on Loki’s scepter and the Stone. Also any information you have on the 2012 attack, Ultron, and Vision.”
“It was insane.” Bruce exhales, his eyes wide and a little crazed, lost in memory, even as he helps Tony up the bed and starts to remove his bandages. “His army. Did you
“The magical weapons we use to defend the Sanctums, the shields, the spells – they are all influenced by energy collected from another dimension. From a part of the universe ordinary men cannot see, but live with every day. It’s what allows us to open portals, to enchant weapons, and to alter reality.” Wong clarifies, gesturing into the air the same way Thor does, when he’s talking about magic Tony really doesn’t understand.
