John was laughing, and Sherlock clicked back into reality again, turning his head from the window to look at him. “Can you believe she got pissed at me for only letting five goals through? She’s mates with the Ravenclaw seeker, I couldn’t bloody believe it, talk about house loyalty.”
He squeezed his eyes tight before he opened them, rubbing over his face with his other hand, which had long ago been cleaned of blood. Anthea, when she realised he refused to leave until the Gryffindor woke, brought him a new shirt, one that thankfully had both sleeves.  He made a mental note to get her something as thanks next time he went to Hogsmeade. The muddied and bloodied one had since been discarded, and Greg had been given proper bandages for the head wound, which in the end wasn’t the worst injury he’d suffered.
She laughed. “Thanks captain obvious.”
“Your phone, and your clothes. Clothes, worn, second hand, you don’t really like them yet you still wear them. That shows lack of money, well lack of muggle money, you father buys them, obviously, no mother would let their child wear clothes with holes in them. The phone is where everything else comes in, the engraving for a start, Harry, your brother, who gave you the phone and Clara, now who’s she? The x’s say lover, gift says wife not girlfriend. Would have kept it if she left him, sentiment, funny thing, but he gave it to you. Firstly, it’s a sign he wants you to keep in touch, judging by the way you’ve tried to scratch the engraving off you aren’t intending to, but it’s also a way to get rid of the guilt. Scratches around the charging port show alcoholism, usually runs in families, ergo your dad, given the lack of a mother.”
“I'm sorry.” He spoke quietly, and Sherlock looked up, still keeping the needle in place, but his brow was furrowed, and he was frowning.
is progresses. But I meant it when I said it’s
“His name is Greg.”
Their eyes met again, but this time he gave more than just a smile, he raised a hand above his head and made a fist. He couldn’t help but grin in response as Greg mimicked his action, before his hand met the broom again and he propelled his entire body down as he practically became one with the stick.
Odd. It was very odd.
Sherlock stood up over him, a genuine grin on his face. “Merry Christmas, John Watson.”
"Wrong." Sherlock replied. "Wrong on every account. I like you John, I like you a lot. Whilst I don't know if I am capable of love, I know that this is more than sexual attraction, more than platonic attraction... I do, genuinely, I do like you."
“It’s fine. It’s all fine.”
“Why?”
"I want to love you back. I- I think I can. You changed me. You make the world so much more interesting, John. So give yourself a bit of credit and feel important, because you are. Emotions were never a thing that were praised, and I-I have majority of them suppressed. But I want to love you."
“Alright, Watson, let’s go.” He whispered to himself.
call you Sherlock, but whatever John you’re looking for is searching for a William.”
“I couldn’t find him at the station, he didn’t sit with us on the train, he doesn’t like Sarah’s friends.” John shrugged, it was hardly his fault, he’d tried to find him, but it was busy, full of students eager to get home, and Sarah was insistent on dragging him to meet her family.
“You didn’t have to stay. You should’ve gone, Shirley was it? She was attracted to you.”
“Oh you stupid git! Now he thinks you don’t like him!” Anthea replied, dropping her wand, placing her hands on her head and closing her eyes before taking a breath. “What happened? Why didn’t you answer him? I know you better than anyone, you have an answer in a millisecond, why didn’t you this time?”
“Unless you want to come visit me in muggle hell, then yeah. Dad’d be glad to get a bit of peace.”
He waited until John’s breathing went back to being fairly normal, the tears had stopped, and the hiccups were less frequent. “I’m sorry.”
Mycroft pretty much lived with Greg at this point. Both of them knew it, and both of them knew they needed to have a talk about where they were going as a relationship. In Greg’s mind he was sure that Mycroft stayed over to spend time with him whilst still being diligent at work six days a week. He was moving steadily in the ministry, just as Greg was in his police job, now doing field work.
“Sherlock?” Real John’s voice finally carried through and Sherlock realised he had his hand on his cheek, where the reflection had kissed him, he quickly dropped it and averted his gaze from the mirror and John.
“I’ll try my best, brother mine.”
John drew his knees up to his chin, trying to avoid Sherlock’s stare, knowing that if he stared back he’d blush again. “I’ve wanted to be a doctor from I was little. I used to play doctor all the time when I was a kid. When she got time off work I used to diagnose her with a fake sickness, and I’d stick the thermometer in her mouth and listen to her heart. When-“ He coughed. “Wh-When she actually got sick, really sick, I’d bring my stethoscope when we went to visit. It was fake obviously, a toy, it didn’t work. But I didn’t really think that day, when- when I couldn’t hear anything from it, that it would be an accurate reading.”
They were sat in the great hall, people who sat around them were still uneasy about Sherlock sitting in the dining hall, he got some stares, but when didn’t he?
“Where’re we going?” Rosie asked, considering they were walking further away from their flat, instead of going home.
“To sleep, twat!” Greg called back.
“Incorrect, Rosamund. It only
The conductor laughed at that, and Mycroft raised his eyebrows, looking as confused as John felt. “I only get to work a few times a year, the more the merrier.” He explained, giving them a wink before ushering them off as he started to work again.
“How so?”
And nothing, from what Greg knew, had ever got him worked up this much, other than Sherlock.
“No but I'm not an idiot.”
Greg gave a laugh at that. “He’s mates with Sherlock. Ain’t that a dead giveaway?”
“Okay definitely, come on mate, just lean on me.” Lestrade replied.
Mycroft furrowed his brow, muttering. “Fair and squa- Never mind. We aren’t here to talk about Sherlock. I’m worried about your health John, you might have eased the pain, but that wrist isn’t fully healed, the magic is tormenting it more. Which begs the question; why didn’t you go to a hospital?”
“Muggle cards are free from demolition Phil.” Greg’s face lit up as Mycroft turned to look at him, before realising his mistake. “Simplest game I know is jack-change-it.”
“So, you don’t care?” The seeker asked, and John rolled his eyes, smiling a little bit.
“Is that?” He trailed off as he listened to the song, gentle violin growing stronger as he wore it.
“So how does this game work Lestrade?” Another boy asked, Anderson, if Mycroft remembered correctly. He was a pureblood Gryffindor, and was currently inspecting the cards, holding them up to the dim lighting of the room. “Is it like exploding snap?” He asked.
“I have good timing then. Posture, punctuality, presentability. Lets go, Mummy gets home at five, so we must be there on time.”
“Dance with me.”
was right?"
“I thought you might like it, it’s a puzzle toy, you mix it up and try to get it back to looking like that. I'm no good with them, it’d take me a year to get it, but I thought you’d enjoy it.” John told him, realising what was wrong.
He wasn’t a limping cripple anymore, but he wasn’t exactly an athlete either. After a few minutes, the young woman seemed hopelessly out of reach.
It was a well-known fact that no one liked Sherlock Holmes. It one of the first things anyone was told upon visiting the small but regal manor. Surely, within ten minutes of stepping across the threshold, anyone could expect to hear the following at least twice. “Greetings and welcome to Holmes Manor. I do trust you’ll enjoy your stay, but please be wary of a little lordling by the name of Sherlock. No one likes him.”
“Yeah. Yeah, and you better get out of my bed while you’re at it. I can’t sleep with your knee in my back.” John groaned, checking his phone. 3am. Bloody hell.
“Victor. The real Victor.” Sherlock swept past him to the desk. “This isn’t all of it. There are notebooks and more serious works and unfinished pieces. But it’s enough.”
John didn’t even know he could drive. If he did know, he’d have insisted that they take a train. But it turns out Sherlock had a license from before they thought to put expiration dates on them. So it was technically valid, although it did turn quite a few heads at the car rental place. And although he could, technically, drive, John was pretty sure he hadn’t since cars were made by hand.
"This should cover your unpaid rent. With some extra for... food or whatever.” The vampire spat out the word ‘food’ as if it were some petty adolescent fad as he quickly wrote out a check and folded it into the page he had ripped out of his notepad. He placed it neatly on the middle of the slab and swept out of the room, pulling on his coat and gloves as he went. “I’ll be seeing you.”
"I'll keep that in mind." John gave her the polite smile he reserved specifically for the elderly. "Well. This has been lovely. But I've got to go."
Sherlock took a moment to preen before lifting his violin back up to his chin to play a light, fluffy melody. John shook his head in amusement and finished his breakfast in a contented, music induced haze. The events of yesterday floated through his mind like the memory of a dream. Setting up elaborate traps, sprinting through dark alleyways, being kidnapped by strange men spouting stranger warnings. How could it be anything but a dream?
“As long as you’re not going to… turn me into a hairless rat if I do.”
Sherlock shook his head, tears leaking from the corners of his clenched eyes. “Oh, that is foul. I mean, unpreserved blood in general is… unappetizing but-
He walked into a promising portion of the forest, where the trees grew close, casting deep shadows. He found that the most interesting things often were found in dark places. It seemed today, he was particularly correct. Within 20 minutes, he found a couple plants that are known to cause some interesting patterns of skin irritation under the right circumstances and one whose berries could induce uncontrollable bouts of diarrhea. Then, after he’d scavenged enough specimens to kill his horse in a variety of fascinating ways, he’d found it.
“What’s it… like? I mean, if it’s not too much information. I assume it’s not quite like getting your blood drawn.”
"Uh. Yes, well..." The words staggered out of his mouth, bashfully. "Next time we're chasing a serial killer, you could try a little harder not to get kidnapped."
“John, does this look like any kind of blood spatter you’ve ever seen?” Sherlock said from a few yards away, his voice carrying easily through the open air, despite the chatter of police all around them.
“I know you don’t need as much sleep as us mortals, but no organism on earth functions entirely without it.” John insisted, picking up his bag from where he set it down just a second ago. “Now, come on, we’ll have to ask for an exchange.”
Sherlock kicked at the pile of wood, blaming it for prematurely waking John. “Trying to make a fire. But apparently I’d have to be fucking faerie!”
“Ok, that’s quite enough.” John grumbled, pulling his hand back into his own possession. While he didn’t mind indulging his friend’s curiosities, no one enjoyed being studied like a rare butterfly. “Could you show me how the crossbow works now?”
It wasn’t.
“Eyebrows.”
“Yeah, right next to the kettle.”
"A client!"
“You can’t seriously expect me to believe that you care, do you?” Sherlock spat angrily, his face contorting into a sarcastic grimace. He pivoted in John’s direction. John opened his mouth to speak, but his brain hadn't yet .
John nodded in agreement and watched light dance over the building across from them through the window. His actual life started back up tomorrow. Work, a therapist appointment, bills to pay, a girlfriend he totally forgot about and had probably moved on by now… but all that didn’t matter until tomorrow. Yesterday, he was kidnapped by a bunch of plotting grandmothers who had every intention of passing him around like a bottle of wine at a party. Today he can rest a bit.
“Oh calm down, it’s not like you’re seeing anything new. We’re both equally equipped.” John grumbled as he rooted around the various nooks and crannies where he stored his belongings.
John was sure that the qualities listed didn't come close to Sherlock’s worst. “Who said anything about flatmates?”
John slammed down the backspace key, watching his writing slowly disappear line by line from the screen. This was the third time he’d written a paragraph just to delete it and the last. He had given up on recording this particular case. Most cases he could boil down to something just this side of supernatural, but this one was just… too much.
John snorted. “I can’t imagine why.”
Finally, he swept back into the living room and shoved John’s tea into his arm so he’d have no choice but to take it.
“I don’t care if you're not asking, I'm offering.” John clarified. “Although, it is a limited offer. Because eventually, I'm going to strap you down and shove it down your throat.”
“That only applies if the dwelling belongs entirely to you, which it does not.”
“John. Come here a second.” Sherlock said, snapping out of his mind palace in an instant.
Sherlock hadn’t left the sofa in days.
Lestrade shook his head like he was afraid his head might fall off. “I don’t blame her. I might as well have been cheating on her for all these years, what with all of the secrets I've been keeping from her. And Sherlock, god. We're not... like that. But I’ve put more effort into caring for that needy bastard than my own daughter.” There was a pause
“It’s alright. I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere.” John reassured the delirious vampire, placing his free hand against his back to calm him. “Can you tell me where it hurts?”
The man nonchalantly brushed the dust from the sleeve of his crisp, perfectly tailored (if not a little old-fashioned) suit. "I trust you're not looking forward to keeping him company. The skull, that is. Not the vampire. Although, I've heard the vampire isn't exactly what you'd call companionable, either."
"Painting? How?" Lestrade asked, although he was already beginning to see it. Sherlock was definitely one of those dramatic types. He had figured that out early on. The detective inspector was infinitely grateful that Sherlock preferred to solve murders than commit them."And how do you know it's a woman?"
John blinked. “You do realize that statement means absolutely nothing, right?”
John was out the door so quickly, he almost forgot the check.
If you want something to listen to while re-reading, here's the link.
But whether or not he could do it was anyone’s guess.
“Why does anyone kidnap children? Desperation.” Sherlock said instantly, almost instinctually.
John followed Sherlock without a word, just a ravenous curiosity, into his bedroom. He’d never seen the inside of Sherlock’s bedroom before, as the vampire had made it very clear that even the space in front of his door was Off Limits. John liked to speculate, to himself and his blog readers, exactly what Sherlock was hiding in there. The most popular possibilities were 1) His secret massive stuffed animal collection, 2) Mirrors. Just so many mirrors, or (the inevitable) 3) A personal porn collection that you could make a museum out of.
(Also, no one gets beheaded anymore. That's so last century.)
"Is he?" He mumbled in response, his mind already pre-occupied with the note laying on top of a check written out for enough money to buy a small palace.
Mycroft blinked. It seemed the elder Holmes was an expert at the art of awkward silence.
He chuckled. “I’m surprised you didn’t break out the candles and rose petals.”
They had a nice brisk walk down the country side, neither of them speaking until the town looked like the contents of an expensive snow globe.
“Are you ok?” John asked as they walked up to the quaint town inn. Sherlock had been pulling faces and making small noises of distress since the moment they left the crime scene.
“Try not to kidnap Mrs. Hudson on the way out. I’d hate for her to burn her brownies.” Sherlock sighed as Mycroft swept out of the room, umbrella and all.
“I’m getting pretty tired of the ‘you mere mortals’ act. I’m sure I’d understand more than you think. I mean, it’s not as if you murdered it.” The vampire looked suddenly sullen. “You didn’t murder it, right?”
"Perfect." Sherlock replayed the segment for the third time. The light of the screen cast a cold light across his face, shifting his eye color from pale to lifeless. John shivered as the gravelly artificial voice echoed through the hollow space as he knew it'd echo through his skull for months afterward. "Check the father's background. Try to track him down. It's not uncommon for the children of the wealthy to be left to the care of a nanny. But in cases such as these, inside jobs are always most likely. Investigate the staff too. Just tutors and nannies, the rest would be a waste of time."
John mumbled something incoherent, muffled by the fabric of his clothes. He could feel John’s voice vibrating against him.
“I assume you don’t want me to deduce it. Mother used to get frustrated when I did that.”
Maybe it wasn’t a total lie, he had been running, and there had been threat of a concussion, but the injury was his head slamming against a wall as he got shoved before John tackled the asshole to the ground and the police caught up (lagging behind, as usual).
Then John did something completely unexpected. Greg expected a wave or a fist-bump, considering that that’s what he was like at age fifteen. But despite being fifteen and full of insecurity, he turned quickly and pulled Greg into a hug. “Thanks, Greg.”
School had kicked back in, the castle was bustling with life again, and the workload had reinstated itself as John studied for his OWLs.
It had driven him to drugs and destruction, and he’d promised his brother he’d never let it get that bad again. So, he shut it all out, everyone, emotions, sentiment, hope.
He supposed he should be excited.
John Watson woke up like a shot.
His lips met John’s and sent flames through his face, it was gentle, and Sherlock made sure it was a kiss that would look familiar, rather than the first kiss it was. It couldn’t be awkward, or the suspect would get suspicious.
Almost silently, a pair of arms wrapped around his waist, and he could feel Johns head pressing into his back. He was warm, and distracting, Sherlock wanted to turn around and reciprocate. Instead he kept his eyes focused through the microscope, twisting the dials ever so slightly as if he was paying attention to what he could see under it and not focusing on John’s firm grip over his midriff.
“To defeat, the huns!”
“And what are you doing?”
“Can’t you go to Bart’s?” The doctor asked, turning to Sherlock who was now sat in his chair, texting on John’s phone to god knows who. He knew Rosie, now she’d gotten a job was generally quite good at paying things back, or replacing things she broke, given her clumsy nature. “I’m sure they wouldn’t mind so long as it’s not nuclear or something.”
Greg rolled his eyes, placing a hand on John’s shoulder. “Mate, stop worrying about it. Everything is going to be fine”
The sorting passed quicker than it had last year, given the fact that his little brother hadn't taken up ten minutes this time. He, as head boy was required to escort and explain everything to the new first years.
“I can’t- I-I can’t think. I-It hurts John.” He stammered out a whisper after what felt like a year of silence. He was looking for an answer.
Smiling softly to himself, he set the plate down on the desk, glancing at the book Sherlock had given him. It was a book on types of poisons. Why was he not surprised? Should he have been surprised?
“Git.”
He'd only ever blown one guy before, so he'd have to learn what Sherlock liked and what he didn't.
“What are you afraid of?” John asked, just to keeping him talking.
“I felt heat. The soft ash at the bottom of the pit. The charred wood.” John answered, giggling as Sherlock pulled at a bit of loose skin. He pulled the strange boy’s hand closer to his face, squinting as he contorted the fingers in different ways.
He walked around the stone to get a better view of the various spots and pools of drying blood while Sherlock studied it in his own way.
Sherlock squirted a ridiculously expensive gob of goo into his palm and completely ignored the fact that they hadn’t left the room yet.
“Her sister’s specialty was potions, she had been using it on you to keep you infatuated.” The girl continued, explaining the situation further.
“Almost three days.” He replied, tone gentle, easy.
However, it was Christmas, the enchanted armour sang carols in the halls, and they were wearing party hats from their breakfast crackers, Sherlock’s was a black pirates hat and John’s was a feathered green one. He’d claimed it to look like that of Peter Pan, to Sherlock’s confusion.
Things continued as normal at Hogwarts. Sherlock, found this strange, John seemed to have completely ignored the fact that feelings had been revealed. Well, correction,
“There’s people here.” He muttered, surveying the grounds, people were mingling around trying to make the most of the bright summer weather. Some were like Greg in their sunbathing, others were walking, there was a group near the lake standing in a circle tossing a frisbee around.
He shrugged on his backpack, his school books taken out of it, scattered on his bed, bare except for the thin duvet laying neatly over the top of it. It was the only bag he had, no doubt Sherlock would pick up on that.
“John, breathe, it’s okay. We don’t have to progress any further, I’m perfectly content to have you as my flatmate and nothing more.”
Sherlock watched him carefully, John was fortunate enough that his chest was fairly small, so as to not show from a straight-on view from behind. Besides, even if he caught a glance he could always just delete it.
“You knew the whole time didn’t you.” John replied bitterly, glaring at him for no other reason than his desire to glare at something, Sherlock just happened to be the nearest thing.
Sherlock knew though. He knew a lot of things about John.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Figure of speech. Mary told her you were dumping her, correct?”
“At the start of school?” Greg asked, and John winced at the shock in his voice.
“Well if this John Watson is as good as you say he is I suppose you have a fighting chance.” He rolled his eyes, smiling softly as Greg tossed the six of clubs at him, glaring. “Oh shut up, you know I think you’re good.”
“Anderson!” A familiar voice he couldn’t quite place yelled out from down the hall. The older boy sprinted, even in his haze of pain Sherlock could’ve predicted that.
“Its wonderful John, thank you.” Sherlock smiled softly.
John managed a watery laugh. “You didn’t have to come here.” He hated being a burden to people, he completely forgot about the library in his haste to get away from all the people in the castle.
“I told you so.” The smirk on Greg’s face, despite attractive, wasn’t welcome.
“Would you like to talk about it?” Mycroft asked, taking a seat across from Greg.
John followed shortly after. “Oh fuck.” His voice came from behind, before he ran forward, kneeling beside her, and placing the hearing pieces of the stethoscope in his ears like he had a dozen times before, pressing the bell to her chest. “Heartbeat is steady, slightly quick.” Sherlock watched as he checked her neck, and wrists, and then listened to her breathing. “She’s breathing steady.”
“He would’ve died, Sherlock.” John protested, looking at Sherlock in disbelief.
If he was honest he was done with all of this soulmate business. He’d sworn to himself that he was going to stop obsessing over it nearly five years ago. He’d been searching his whole life, and after twenty-five years of looking and hunting for every John in the whole of England that could be his soulmate, he was done.
This had to be the weirdest thing he'd ever done. Here he was, bottom half naked apart from his socks in the living room of his flat, about to take his best-friend's dick in his mouth.
His hands were shaking more than he’d realised when he went to put the key into the lock, twisting it slowly to keep sound to a minimum until a click was heard, he reached for the handle to push it down and it didn’t move.
“Today is Friday.”
“What did he say?” Anthea asked once the other girl had gone from earshot.
“He won us the match.”
He’d never missed anyone before. Ever. Not even Mycroft (maybe a little but he’d take that secret to the grave). He’d never missed a friend before, never cared about anyone before, never really had anyone
“They will be. Sherlock needs us, we’re the only people he trusts, and it may take all three of us to get him to leave.” John replied.
Greg huffed out a laugh. “Thanks for that captain obvious.”
John watched in disbelief, as he chased that criminal around the corner, once he was out of sight, the doctor placed his head in his hands and sighed, a laugh ghosting in his throat.
“Who said what, then?”
“And she told you Sarah is manipulating you.”  Sherlock noted, eyes closed, trying to piece the reiterated knowledge together in his mind palace. It had taken on a new light, now somebody else had said the same things he’d been thinking about for months, a new tone had been taken on, and new ideas represented.
“And you may also be aware that your friendship with him has benefitted him in ways, mostly social, but we’ll take what we can get. He was generally not very good with people before you began this companionship you seem to have with him.”
Sherlock's phone disappeared into a pocket as he leaned over the table. "Don't you find it a bit suspicious that most of the blood was still wet when we arrived?" His voice was low and quiet. John didn't hear him speak, so much as feel it vibrating through his skin.
Sherlock shook his head, simultaneously conducting the final checks on his face. “Not quite. People who murder dogs rarely stop there.”
“So what good’s a hot bath going to do him? He’s starving, so he needs food right? Well, I’ve got a pocket knife. Open his mouth” John began rolling up his sleeve, eager to do something other than just stand around and watch his flatmate suffer.
Yes, this story takes place in some mythical universe where Sherlock actually talks about his feelings. It's probably the blood loss talking.
And John felt more like family than any human he’d ever known. It had only known the strange fae boy for a few weeks, yet already he felt like a brother to him. Like a real brother who cared about him, not the overbearing, prying, yet woefully oblivious brother that Mycroft pretends to be.
“Sherlock.” John stepped in his path, forcing him to stop and look up. “If he didn’t know they were vampires, then why would he steal them?”
"That sounds like... but- it can't be," mumbled Lestrade, looking more confused than anything.
He took a seat by John’s fire pit, just a few feet away from the burrow, wondering if breakfast would be worth the walk back to his horse. He glanced at the lemony light peeking out of the inconspicuous little hole in the ground and decided against it. But the morning chill was beginning to get unbearable, so he gathered some wood, found two sticks and made an attempt at rubbing them together. As he had lived a sheltered life in a bustling manor with many servants and more sophisticated tools, he had never actually learned how to light a fire in the woods. He’d seen John do it dozens of times though and the mechanics of it seemed ludicrously simple. Take wood, apply friction, add more wood slowly so as not to smother it.
John answered with a hard punch to the gut. It didn’t land, Sherlock slid past it easily, retaliating with a playful bat to the cheek. With a better understanding of how things stood between them in this fight, John got serious, landing a couple hits, blocking a few more, catching and then losing his opponent in a couple choke holds and grapples.
“So, I guess what I’ve learned from this letter is that you have a family who love you and not just in the creepy Mycroft way. None of them have even the vaguest idea of who you are. And your mother thinks we’re in a relationship and should… mate.”
But nobody cared.
“Always.” John muttered, trying to focus on his work and not the feeling of Sherlock’s slender fingers tracing over his back.
scar your body? I mean you no ill intent John, believe me; I know how hard it must be going home.”
“I heard you’re really good at transfiguration, one of my mates, he’s struggling quite a bit with it, would you give him a hand?”
He felt warm, content just to be there. It was strange considering he’d never been one to appreciate such things. But it was nice, just to lie like this, with his best friend, his only friend, at his side.
He put a hand on John's shoulder. "Read him a bed-time story for me will you?"
Greg sat down at the usual table Mycroft sat at, he was out of breath and tenser than usual, clearly he’d been looking for him. That usually meant something was quite seriously exciting or quite seriously wrong. “Can I talk to you? Outside?” He asked once the slythein looked up at him quizzically, and Mycroft didn’t need another word of persuasion to shut his book and follow the Gryffindor out toward the empty quidditch pitches.
Opening the box, he looked stunned. The watch was stainless steel, black, and pristine. Gently, he lifted it, inspecting it almost. “It’s beautiful. How did you-“ He cut himself up, raising his head to look at John, frowning as he set the watch back in it’s box. “You spent your work money on this, that’s why you haven’t been eating, you absolute tit!” Sherlock spoke, his voice rising, but John knew he wasn’t actually angry. More so frustrated.
Greg nodded, as though he was beginning to understand the point. “I mean do it on the weekend or something, give her some time to get over it. But that’s reasonable, mate. You’re with her nearly all the time, it shouldn’t matter that you hang out with one of your friends.”
“Charms, curses and bewitching’s for the brave of heart?” John asked. The Ravenclaw had been ranting on about how no bookshop would sell it to him, and the librarian wouldn’t let him borrow it because it was sixth year level stuff. John was always blown away with how good Sherlock was at these things, always more advanced than you’d ever expect just by looking.
Mycroft didn’t even reply but simply sprinted from the commons toward the hall.
Everybody else seemed to rely so much on their casting, and he’d seen John try to cast spells to no avail, he’d seen the boy nearly snap his wand in frustration because he just
“Because I’m human.” He raised his hands in somewhat surrender. “I'm
Sherlock watched silently as John took another long sip. And another. Just as the lines in his face began to loosen and soften, there was a knock on the door. A precise, pretentious sort of knock that could only mean one thing. Mycroft.
"Of course. I didn't think you were the type to run at the first sight of danger." Sherlock sighed, more relieved than concerned. He lifted John's injured arm. John tried to pull it out of his grasp but it was useless. He couldn't tell if it was Sherlock's strength or his own exhaustion that made the act seem effortless. There was a tearing noise as the sleeve of his ruined jumper was stripped away. John felt a set of fingertips, or it might have been a nose, brush against the open flesh of his wound. "I can fix this if you let me."
Sherlock marched directly through the crowd, tutting at all the damage that had been inflicted on the fresh crime scene. A large, burly man blocked their path, reeking of authority. “Civilians aren’t authorized entry at this time.”
"John," Sherlock rumbled, purring from where he perched on John's stomach like a giant cat. A set of marble-cold fingertips brushed his cheek. It felt fundamentally wrong, like touching a sculpture in a museum. "You disappeared during the chase. Why?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"High?" John wasn't sure how he still had the capacity to be baffled. Then again... that would explain the massive quantities of food. And the endless patience. "On what?"
“Are you sure? Because you look a little pale,” Sherlock said slowly. Deliberately. As if hinting something to someone very thick.
“Sherlock, where are you?” John asked, fumbling at the empty bed. Sherlock could’ve slapped himself. It was dark. He spent a solid five minutes doing up a button-down when he could’ve been wearing a sodding lace negligee and John wouldn’t have known the difference. Decreased mental capacity must be setting back in.
“What about mine?” John asked after what he thought was a moment's consideration. In truth, he'd been considering it for the past few months. And not just wondering in passing why he hadn’t been eaten alive. He'd been dying to know exactly what that must feel like. How long would it take? How much would he take? Would it be the same as that night after the kidnapping? Or would it be…. More.
John paused as he sliced off another chunk of lasagna, the layers of soft pasta and thick sauce suddenly looking all too much like flayed skin. He pushed the plate aside and turned his attention to Sherlock. "What do you mean?" He prompted.
“Because I wanted you there.” He leaned low over John’s head. Rationally, he knew he could get out of this easier than he could get out of bed in the morning. Sherlock wasn’t physically holding him down with anything but the long, thin legs wrapped around his waist. But despite that, he didn’t dare move.
After a long moment of quiet contemplation of the bizarre events of the past few days and the nature of their lives, Sherlock swung himself to a standing position in one dizzying motion.
“John!” He knew he wouldn’t have to shout very loud, thankfully. He could smell the human standing just outside the door. Along with Lestrade and another pot of rapidly cooling tea.
"That's not what you said when you asked me to take this case." Sherlock said with a smug sort of misery. "You said- oh dear how did you put it again? It was such a clever line, I'd hate to get it wrong."
Until now, John had assumed that Sherlock was a lousy kisser, as all of their previous fluid exchanges were rather…  Amateurish. Wet and careless. But now he understood that could not even be considered kissing.
Please note that if I’m found dead under mysterious circumstances, makeup and beauty challenges are to blame.
Hey! I had a lot of fun writing this chapter, I hope it's as much fun to read.
He got up, ran his hands over his hopelessly rumpled suit and left the room without another word.
“Hello, what’s this?” John mumbled as he pulled a sheet of canvas paper from under a small pile.
John smirked to himself. “If you don’t want to listen to me typing, you can go somewhere else.”
Sherlock scoffed. “How could I have asked? Just mention it over tea ‘My, Mrs. Hudson makes a nice cuppa. But you know what would be even better? About 12 ounces of your bodily fluids.’ Just how do you expect you would’ve reacted?”
John huffed, snapping his laptop shut. “There’s just no way I can word it without my therapist sending me to an institution. Wannabee vampire octogenarians holding rituals in the woods? It’s absurd.”
Luckily, a different voice spoke for him. “You are my brother, Sherlock. Whether either of us like it or not, it is my duty to care.” A carefully measured voice intoned lazily from the couch. The man who owned sat on the couch as if they had both been sculpted out of the same block of marble. His feet were spread at just the right angle to invoke a sense of regality and both of his hands rested masterfully on the handle of his umbrella. It was his kidnapper.
With some measure of awkwardness and careful maneuvering, Sherlock was deposited into the steaming bath water and John was released from his time out.
“Fine, fine. Just let me get dressed.” John huffed, flopping out of bed with all of the enthusiasm of an ornery teenager. “Bloody hell.”
He smiled shyly in the dark as he stepped out of John's bed. "Goodnight."
“As soon as I get the powder out of my hair. So you better pack quickly.” That was never a problem. John maintained a habit of keeping a bag packed by his bed since their last surprise outing. Sherlock swore it would only take three hours to solve a mildly interesting robbery. Then the bastard managed to clean out an entire house wallpaper and all, causing them to stay for an entire week to catch him.
The strange, fascinating being before him shook his head, glittering in the low light. “So, I assume I can expect you to intrude on my home again?”
“Some reports of satanic activity. Symbols painted in red paint. Rudimentary altars built in various locations. The killing of small animals. The police aren’t concerned and frankly, if it were anywhere else, it’d be below a 4 at best.” He sighed, words falling in between strokes of a nude lipstick, just half a shade pinker than his skin tone.
John’s eyebrows shot up to mid-forehead. If Sherlock had any reaction to the new information, he didn’t show it. He only rolled his eyes. “You know how kids of this generation are. No respect.”
*man nipples are hilarious and if you don’t agree with me I don’t believe you.
“My step-daughter Amelia is such a sweet girl. I-I’d just hate it if something… happened to her. I mean- she’s probably fine. Occasionally she goes out to see friends and things but It’s been days. I just get so worried.” A man in an expensive yet casual suit blubbered from the sofa. As he fidgeted with his hands, John eyed the rolex around his wrist. This was going to be a good pay-off. “Her mother has been away visiting family for a few weeks and I don’t know how I could possibly tell her if Amelia didn’t come back. Please, Mr. Holmes. Could you help me?”
Sherlock pouted a little at being deprived of his explorations, but nodded.
“Well, teenagers have been teenagers for as long as there have been teenagers, Mr. Holmes.” Officer Longfellow chuckled, peering up at the doctor and the detective pointedly. It was as if he thought he was imparting some Priceless Wisdom upon them that would suddenly make the fog clear from their young, naïve minds so they could see the world from his own lofty perspective.
He continued writing without a moment’s pause. “You haven’t been on any drugs, prescribed or otherwise. Low alcohol content too, but that doesn't say much as the human body metabolizes alcohol rather quickly.”
Consider buying my shit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock crinkled his eyebrow at Mycroft. “You mean sucking off politicians in the loo doesn’t count as socializing? Who knew.”
Copy and paste: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Littlepatchofhell
“Do you care for him?” Mycroft asked in carefully measured and timed syllables.
The first of which being that Sherlock drank a surprising amount of non-blood fluids. And not just surprising for a vampire. John was sure people living in the desert with raging colds didn't drink half so much fluid as he did. There were times when he'd walk into the kitchen to find Sherlock chugging an entire gallon of milk.
Sherlock was sitting cross-legged against the other pillow with the light of a laptop shining in his face. He hit the spacebar and the sounds of gunfire stopped. “Watching Netflix. Sorry, action movies weren’t the best choice. I’ll put on a documentary.”
“Oh, shove it. I'm not going anywhere.” Lestrade sighed, carefully hanging his good jacket on the hat stand. “John, go draw a hot bath.”
“You’re a bit anemic.” Sherlock pulled out a small black notepad and began to scribble something into it.
"Good thing I mentally recorded it in case of this very occasion- 'It's bound to pay well'." The vampire growled through his teeth, stomping childishly across the street.
Sherlock considered the question as he brushed just a hint of blue eyeshadow in the places where his veins would normally peek through in the corner of his eyes. “Mostly red and itchy. But after a while, the flaking skin does sort of look like ash.”
“And did he take it?”
Sherlock opened his mouth, as if to respond, but he only sighed. “Keeping skulls is an ancient vampiric tradition.The whole of it is far more complicated than a single night’s explanation. But I-”
John carefully shifted through the collection. He wasn’t exactly an art aficionado, but he didn’t have to be appreciate the refinement of the linework and the soft richness of the colors. Anyways, it didn’t seem that Sherlock brought him here for his eye as a painting critic.
Then John came from work to the distinct, unmistakable smell of urine emanating from the sofa. Now Sherlock was quite blasé when it came to many aspects of cleanliness. It was in no way uncommon to find urine samples in the refrigerator, in his favorite mug or filling the bathtub with the help of an antique bear rug. But he was fairly meticulous when it came to his personal hygiene. There were only so many circumstances involving bodily fluids and his clothing that he tolerated for extended for significant amounts of time. And even then, not happily. So, when John found that his friend lying on the sofa had soiled himself and done nothing to remedy the matter, his first instinct was to call an ambulance. Then he got a grip and called Lestrade.
It was then that he got a good look at his elder brother. To his surprise, he looked much the same way he always did. Perfectly composed without a single wrinkle in his fine clothes or a bead of sweat on his brow.  He didn’t care that he’d been missing all day, dealing with highly dangerous substances and possibly inhuman beings. He only cared that he didn’t look nice for dinner with Mummy.
"I was hardly going to keep them under my pillow, was I?" He snapped, momentarily lifting his mouth from it's place on the blood bag. "Measuring the muscle definition of left hands for work."
"Yes." John mumbled something that sound almost like 'do what you like'. Sherlock hummed, deep and low. It filled the room like a finger circling a wineglass. John winced as something wet swiped across his wound. He felt himself begin to drift off when the vampire began to speak again in between licks. "It's not exactly good manners, this. Taking your blood from the flesh so soon after we've met." The stinging pain of the wound faded quickly until it felt as fuzzy as his head did. It occurred to him that he should be remembering something important. Something about danger. But it drifted away as he fell further asleep. "But your flesh is already broken. And it's less polite to let it fester."
‘In other news, I went out to see a movie with Sara from work.’ Sherlock moaned pitifully into the sofa cushions. ‘She’s really quite nice.’
Sherlock huffed out a humourless laugh as he leaned over the file, snapping a picture of the photo attached to a sheet of background information. “The kidnapper hasn’t a clue. If he did, he’d have sold them off and we’d never hear a word about it. Vampire children are extremely rare and therefore unspeakably valuable.” Sherlock began pacing across the floor, thinking frantically. “There must be something you’ve missed. Something that will lead us to them. But that could be anything.”
“This way,” She commanded quietly without even glancing at John. She floated towards a door that was entirely identical to the others.
“A-alright.” The man said, his smiled faltering slightly.
John watched in morbid fascination as Sherlock drank the small vial of his blood like a frat guy drinks a shot. The vampire said it was just to get a taste of what he was buying, but he tipped the contents down his throat so quickly that John wondered if he tasted it at all.
(See the end of the chapter for
I should note that this is a study in scarlet in name alone. The cases are nothing alike.
“No.” He spat as he wriggled away from Lestrade. Or tried to anyways. “I’ll undress myself. Just- give me a little… privacy.”
“No. The house might belong to Mrs. Hudson, but this flat belongs to me.”
https://open.spotify.com/user/rocodarling/playlist/0GBznypzhDiOn56Oha3JxA
John turned around.
Sherlock laughed. But it didn’t sound like any laughter he'd heard from him before. It sounded more like a very small jet engine than anything human and there wasn’t much of a facial expression to go along with it. But somehow he could feel the amusement. It occurred to John that this must be what Sherlock’s laughter sounds like when he didn’t have the energy to act human. “You can try.”
“Sherlock, how lovely it is to see you up and about so soon.” Mycroft somehow managed to say sarcastically, despite being entirely sincere.
Sherlock shot Lestrade a warning glance, which he ignored. “Last time he tried to drink from her flesh she… got off.”
“Oh, so you are sensitive to the sun. Do you turn to ash, or just get red and itchy like the rest of us?” John asked with one eye on the vampire’s efforts to put his face back on and the other on his eggs.
John shook his head. “It… sits on top of my skin. I can feel it if I concentrate, but mostly it’s like air. It’s there, but I don’t notice it.”
The lady somehow managed to scoff with her entire body. “Don’t you think I have? The local police won’t listen to me anymore.”
*Sherlock’s industrial grade sunscreen looks a lot like this (minus the utter misery of the wearer): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHZFXDzK2NE
"Exactly my point." Sherlock muttered smugly.
“It doesn’t. No, the actual bloodletting only takes a few minutes.” Lestrade picked up the sports section of the newspaper with all the methodical caution of a brain surgeon and eased his chair back to read it. “The rest is just watching Sherlock sleep and hoping he’ll roll off my arm before it falls off.”
“Costume departments have been after my clothing for years. They-“
Sherlock scoffed. "I'm not a complete imbecile, John. Let me remind you that you did, in fact, give me permission. And it's not as if I did anything unseemly to-"
“It protects me from many things.” John responded, just as eager to answer Sherlock’s questions as he was to ask them. Without warning, he thrust his hand into the growing fire. Sherlock gave a shout of alarm but quickly realized that while the fire licked at his hand like an overeager puppy, John showed no sign of pain. When John pulled it out, Sherlock instantly grabbed it to make a more thorough inspection of the damage, or lack of which.
He shook his head, thinking maybe it was some strange waking dream.
“They uhm… had to be removed. When I was a child. The canines grew in wrong.” Sherlock mentioned, breaking the thick, heavy silence filling the cold dungeon.  John made no indication that he heard him, not that Sherlock would’ve been able to see it. The blindfold made sure of that. Only the faint sound of his heart steadily beating and the soft rasp of his breath indicated that he was present and alive. “I only had the canines removed at first, but denture production was in a… experimental phase when I got my first set and two of the adjacent teeth on one side got infected due to the radiation.”
"She," Sherlock corrected the second Anderson left, shutting the door behind him. He walked in circles around the bedroom-turned-crime-scene, crouching at regular intervals in an effort to look at the scene from different angles. From where John stood, it almost looked like a strange dance. "Oh, I love a female serial killer. They're always so... inventive."
John blinked, sick of the thickly veiled allusions and innuendos. “I’m sorry, I-“
He wanted to lie in bed and cry until life got the hint and left him the fuck alone. But his bladder demanded that he get up, grow a pair and take long, hard piss. His stomach agreed, provided they grab a bite on the way. He begrudgingly admitted that they were right and hauled himself out of bed.
“I’m sorry. Old habits. I… ” Sherlock turned a rather flattering shade of pink and looked down at his hands. “No one stays this long.”
Sherlock hummed, hitting the replay button on the video.
John tried to make some sort of sense of his current situation. Sherlock told him he was going to a murder scene, but he never explained why. Or why John needed to be there... Or why everyone investigating the crime were looking at him like he was responsible for the murder.
Both the 162 year old vampire and the war veteran found it rather insulting.
John was sure he knew what went on between them. But his mind refused to let it go.
He adjusted his present’s position against his back as he guided his horse off the main road. Sherlock didn’t want his present to be too obvious, but a crossbow is a difficult thing to disguise. Not that it really mattered, because there was a large chance that John had never seen one before and Sherlock was being an utter idiot. But idiot or not, he was going to do this properly.
"Duty, of course. How could I have forgotten your unconditional devotion to saving your fat arse from mummy's wra-" Sherlock's jaw snapped shut and his dramatically sarcastic flourishes came to a sudden halt. It was then that he noticed John standing at the door.
“Very well then.” Sherlock nodded, chuckling with the strange, magical being he’d just discovered. Or rather, the strange magical being that discovered him.
Sherlock stomped his foot. “John!”
“Oh.” John tried to think of an occasion in which a woman’s orgasm might not be welcome. He couldn’t come up with any off the top of his head. “And that’s bad?”
I hope this chapter was what you've all anticipated. If not, I'm planning on making some... juicier feeding scenes to follow. This one is their first, after all.
“You didn’t do that just for me, did you? I mean, I appreciate the gesture, but your mother’s watc-”
He did. Just in time to see Sherlock, half slung over Lestrade’s shoulder, glare hard enough to give himself an aneurism.
“Who doing- Oh… You mean the police.” John gasped, finally catching up to Sherlock’s train of thought. It was a mad train of thought, possibly gone entirely off the rails. But if it was true… “You think the police are behind all of this?”
2) His therapist had enough ideas about the state of his psyche without him ranting about his vampiric roommate's rivalry with his overbearing older brother who happened to own most of london.
"Yes, I did." Sherlock stood to casually fiddle with his sheet music. Or at least, a stage actor's idea of casual. "Although, I don't think you were exactly entirely conscious at the time."
He watched with a little more intent as his flatmate coated his face and neck in a thick, beige paste, occasionally stopping to check his handiwork or pull a chunk of hair out of the way. The stuff dried on smooth and plastic, giving the skin an eerie mannequin-like quality*.
Lestrade sighed, the way people do when they've answered a question too many times and still don’t know the correct answer. “Different people have different experiences. Some say it’s almost religious, others say it’s like drugs. There’s a whole cult of freaks who see it as erotic. And of course, every vampire is different too. But mainly it’s like being drunk.”
Although he felt completely and utterly drained in several ways, his bladder was full to bursting. In the back of his mind he was thankful for that, as otherwise he might never have gotten up the motivation to move from his place on the couch. John slowly sat up, stretching his neck and back as they were both sore from holding one position for so long. Gingerly, like a 90 year old man after a run-in with a bus, he eased his weight onto his feet and moved slowly towards the door. Luckily, once he started moving his muscles gradually began to remember that they were, in fact, functional rather than decorative and began to act as such.
“Oh… yeah.“ Lestrade cringed. “I just feed him. I never actually realized what it looked like.”
“A town-wide conspiracy.”
John stepped between the two, forcing them both to acknowledge his presence for more than a few seconds. "So... you're saying vampire hunters exist."
"Well, how was I supposed to know he was a predatory pedophile? I thought that was your job." John grunted back as he turned a corner.
“...yes.” John said through gritted teeth. “And you are?”
Sherlock hummed mockingly. Sarcastically. John didn’t know how one hum could make him feel so stupid. “You’ve already met Victor.”
"No." John blinked in confusion.
"I'm here to speak to Mr. Herald." Sherlock said with a cold precision, not giving him a spare glance.
Sherlock scoffed, gesturing towards the kidnapper. “Look at the bastard. Shaking, hiding behind a toy gun. He only did all this because his girlfriend broke up with him. Ending his life would be a mercy he does not deserve.”
Sherlock was silent for a while. To anyone else, it would seem like he was just focusing on navigating the winding roads, but John knew he was struggling to come up with an appropriate answer. Or rather, put the answer into words. “Yes, I did make that offer with the potential of feeding off you in mind. But I can’t demand that you open your veins for me in lieu of rent. I’m not quite that much of a bastard.”
“You’re deliberately being obtuse, I don’t know why I even-“
Sherlock smirked weakly, awkwardly lifting himself to a sitting position in the water with one hand clutching the towel acting as his only shred of privacy. “Money, power, sex. It’s all the same. I’ve always wondered how you could’ve possibly become a detective inspector so quickly.” Lestrade rolled his eyes, but didn’t respond. Sherlock sighed and reached for the shampoo. “Get out.”
"A bit, yeah." The girl chuckled back. "Well, is there a number I could reach you at? In case I see Amy or... Need music lessons."
John took up his place a few inches behind Sherlock's left shoulder to peek at the sheets of canvas and paper Sherlock was arranging on the wood surface.
Deadly nightshade. A small garden’s worth, all nestled between the tangled roots of a half dead oak tree. Surely, this is what his brother meant to keep from him. Their pretty violet heads bowed at the end of their stems, as if bowing to him in greeting. For pure folly’s sake, he returned the gesture before kneeling to examine them more closely.
The way his day had gone, he could probably take a thousand lashings with a smile on his face. He’d skipped an entire day of Mycroft’s dreary business talk. And he’s got dozens of specimens to work with along with a place to find more. And he’d found John, whatever he might be. Nothing could bring him down.
Google speech to text pinged. “Inform the criminals of London that I’m taking a sick day,” Sherlock told it before hitting the send button.
“Do you fancy a walk?” Sherlock asked after a long silence, snapping his laptop shut. John was about to question the sudden change in topic when Sherlock gave him a pointed glance. “I really feel like a walk.”
Sherlock ran through a few demonstrations at John’s request, elaborating on various parts of the process until the target tree was studded with arrows and even more were lost to the bushes. By the time he handed the crossbow over, John knew exactly what he was doing.
The young noble hesitated briefly as he passed the invisible threshold. Not out of fear or apprehension, though. He only considered what a shame it was that the hoof prints of his horse should mar the perfect carpet of lush grass that lined the path. Sherlock brushed the thought off as quickly as it occurred to him. Grass grows quickly and it’s hardly rare. He spurred his horse on to a light gallop, eager to see what his father and brother have been warning him about since he learned to speak.
“Mrs. Hudson then?” Lestrade asked, cutting the awkward tension. Sherlock seemed to consider it for a moment.
“Oh, are you trying to punish me now? Is that it?” Sherlock whined in the most punchable tone possible.
“How long?” Lestrade groaned, his voice clinical. “Is he awake?”
“How did I… React to the body parts in the fridge? Or the skull on the mantelpiece? Or the sodding murder cases?” John grumbled, baffled by his friend’s lack of faith in him. “It’s not like I didn’t know you’re vampire, Sherlock. Stop being ridiculous.”
She looked… surprisingly normal. Considering she had just killed a girl a few hours ago. She wore a bulky, oversized navy blue sweater with the hood pulled low over her face. From here, you could almost mistake the crusty, rust colored stains on her battered old jeans for paint.
“Well, we have the time.” Sherlock sighed, trying to get comfortable against the rusted iron bars. With the way his hands were so crudely locked behind his back and a massive bruise on his shoulder from one of their kidnapper’s crowbars, comfortability just wasn’t possible. He’d have thought that cults of elderly women would have been more courteous in their methods of bondage.
"You're not going to..."
Also, I've really been into Xena: Warrior Princess lately and have been doing quite a bit of writing for that fandom as well. (I love you Sherlockians, but the Xenites are in dire need of me. They are woefully lacking in ficcery.{they don't even have harry potter aus}) So that might also effect my updating frequency.
Sherlock shook his head, stopping his mind from wandering too far. He had less time than he’d originally estimated. Better skip the pants.
“Yes, well. I’ve got a sister who’d sell me for six pack and half a tuna sandwich.” John chuckled, only half joking. “Why’ve you been avoiding me lately? Is it just because I asked about the skull?”
"But it's the only lead we have." John stated, going through the facts in his head. "Isn't it?"
Knowing he wasn’t quite in his depth with this matter John left and did as he was told, not that there was room for anything else in Lestrade’s tone of voice. Just as the bathwater started flowing warm, he heard the sounds of struggle at the end of the hall but before he could get up, he caught some snatches of conversation that cooled his panic. He watched the clear, glass green waters rise slowly higher and breathed through his nose in attempt to steady himself.
“OH!” Sherlock shouted, in a moment of ecstatic realization. “Two plane tickets!”
I've found that the comments section has been pretty quiet lately. I know people are reading, because the views counter and the kudos are always ticking upward. But still, without all of your lovely voices, my audience feels like just a collection of numbers and I'm not very good with numbers.
John wasn’t sure exactly what to make of that. So he got up and rummaged about the fridge, despite the fact that he knew there was nothing in it.
Ella the Therapist always told John that he needed to be more in touch with his emotions. She recommended meditation or writing or just taking a couple of minutes to just sit and think about where he is mentally and spiritually. Whenever he tried those things, he found that the only emotion he was getting in touch with was a massive, crushing boredom.
Sherlock looked dubious, despite the fact that he was apparently fighting off the urge to vomit. “Too soon to say.”
“Oh no no, don’t look at that.” Sherlock scrambled to snatch back the sheet, but John was too fast. “I-I was sure that was somewhere else.”
Sherlock snickered and continued tickling John’s foot. “I just got a call, we have to go.”
“That too.” Lestrade smirked over the rim of his glass of orange juice. He lowered the glass, squinting philosophically at the pulpy fluid “It’s like… coming out of a cinema to find that half your day is over. And it didn’t feel at all like that much time had passed.”
“I can see it now. The place where the skin ends and the… shield begins.” It was a thin layer, no more substantial than fuzz on a peach, but if he looked very closely, he could see it bend where he came in contact with John. He played with it with is for a few minutes, tapping John’s skin in different ways to see how the aura would react. He found that approaching it with force caused it to resist, keeping his finger a needle’s point away from touching skin. But it was more malleable under gentler touches, bending enough to allow contact. “That’s fascinating.”
“Oh. Wow. So how does that… happen exactly?” Sherlock didn’t look any less confused. “How did you become a vampire?”
"Other victims!?"
A thought occurred to him. “Thank you, by the way.”
“I kept as many out as I could, but I’m afraid with a small town like ours news travels quickly…” Greenfield sighed, leading them towards the smooth white stone standing vertically in the clearing. Most of the blood was centered around or on it. “Strange activity has been going on for months now, but this is the fifth event of its kind in as many weeks. It’s hard to pin down exactly what’s being caused by rebellious teenagers, what’s hype, what might be something serious, and whether or not any of these factors might be influencing the others. So anything you could do to give the matter some clarity would be much appreciated.”
“It’s my bed. Because I’m the only one in this room who needs to make use of it.” John sighed, trying to will himself back to sleep.
“Not human. Right. I keep forgetting.” The doctor muttered to himself. The moment he began to pull his hand away, Sherlock bolted into some facsimile of wakefulness, grabbing John’s hand and gasping like a fish left out to dry.
There was a scream in the night.
Sherlock had begun conducting experiments on the travel of gossip through the community, releasing harmless little pockets of false information like ‘I was thinking of getting a cat’ or ‘I heard the prime minister was getting a breast augmentation’ and measured the amount of time it took to come back around and how removed from the original message the end result would be.
Months later, he'd look back on this moment and remember that he had never felt more alive.
So he adjusted his cloak to conceal the lump in his back as he made his way to the burrow that John used as shelter. It used to be a fox den buried in the root system of an old tree but John, with his sparkling ingenuity and unlimited amount of time, expanded it until it fit him comfortably. During a particularly close call with a bear, they both even managed to squeeze into it at the same time. It was not terribly comfortable. But it was safe. And warm. Sherlock paused just as he began to see John’s glow emanating from the ground.
Unfortunately, Sherlock didn’t seem to think the same. He’d had the same expression of mild disinterest since he walked in. He hadn’t even bothered to tell him to get to the point, which was a clear sign that he either already knew where the client’s step-daughter was or he just couldn’t care if he tried. Sherlock opened his mouth, in preparation to pronounce this case ‘boring’
No, being generally disliked with a few exceptions was simpler. Especially on days like these.
But he had to ask. “I didn’t think you’d pay that much attention to food.”
"She's just being dramatic. She knows how these things go. Besides-"
(See the end of the chapter for
John felt like he should ask something before he left. About the deal. About this flatmate business. About him in general. But before he could catch hold of a thought and pin it down, Sherlock was gone. “Yeah, he’s always like that.” Molly chirped apologetically.
“Why not? You’ve let literally everyone else come through. Honestly, I’m surprised you’re not serving cocktails. Then it’d be a real party.” Sherlock smirked mockingly, trying and failing to maneuver around the human barricade.
"Sherlock." John warned, handing the taller man his glass. Sherlock took it reluctantly, rolling his eyes to himself as he payed too much attention to how their fingers touched.
Sherlock shrugged. “You got annoyed at me for pointing out to Molly that Jim is gay. I figured if I were to end your own relationship you’d be furious.”
“John.”
And there it was again. Always somehow, no matter what, his thought process has cycled back to that frustratingly stupid Gryffindor.
His transfiguration was at third-year level, as were most of his other subjects. The only thing he couldn’t do was fly on a broom, but he wasn’t too fussed about that anyway. He’d rather dedicate his time to something more productive or useful, such as learning to be an animagus, or practicing his charms. He was currently working on one that could silence somebody in a matter of casting it.
For the life of him he couldn’t make sense of the metaphysical pain that overcame his as he’d stared at them in the hall. He couldn’t understand why he’d stared either. Why it bothered him so much.
Though that situation had been since resolved, so there was no use in dwelling on it.
“Oh uh-“
Greg frowned, Mycroft's words sounded quite foreboding, like things were a lot more serious than he was letting on. “You can always come stay with me? You’ll have to learn your way around Muggle society anyway.”
“Oh Christ, I don’t want to think about that interaction.”
Before he could get the Seeker’s response, or the captain’s permission, he bolted from the pitch. If there was one thing that muggle P.E had given him, it was a faster running pace than most.
Sherlock didn’t know how it happened. All John told him was that he fell, and used his arm for support until it cracked beneath him. That was an obvious lie, but Sherlock didn’t press it.
“Dickhead.”
After a bout of fussing and scolding from Mrs Hudson, and a cup of tea, they ended up in their bedroom.
The Gryffindor landed the moment he noticed Mycroft watching him, touching down and stepping off the broom, running his gloved hands through his hair. “Myc, I'm so sorry I just couldn’t hide it anymore and I get it if you-“
He’d known Sherlock from September. He was a rich prick and not many people liked him. Considering John was also doing all three sciences at A-Level, he spent a lot of time around him. For some unknown reason Sherlock opted to make John his partner in practicals and over time John found himself friends with the taller boy.
Sherlock pulled away, needing to breathe.
Reluctantly, John turned around, and offered his wrist to Mycroft, who gently took it in his hand, pulling his wand out of his waistcoats inside pocket. “This doesn’t mean I’m obeying you.” John spoke indignantly, watching Mycroft's careful movements as he muttered the incantation, and the cold then warmth spread throughout his arm, tingling his fingers, all the way to his collar bone.
“I know you probably don’t even like blokes, I didn’t before you, I just… I'm sorry, I didn’t mean it to be like this.” The Gryffindor seemed genuinely guilty, like he thought his own feelings were a crime and Mycroft came back into focus enough to reply.
Because there was a body on the ground and a broom lying next to it.
John furrowed his brow. “Is he?”
It was weird for him, and he hoped Mycroft felt it too, that they weren’t going back with them. He was unsure of how he would react, but he wanted to be there for his friend. John’s dad, from what Greg knew, never really bothered with him, and he knew how it felt to not have somebody wave him off.
“Alright, I'm going.”
“Wanker.” Sherlock replied, tone flat, expression dull, before grinning widely at the shock on John’s face.
“Of course you do. When was the last time you even slept in that bed?”
She’d been gone for three years, and she was still taking him to school.
Sherlock noticed a small spot of darkening red on Johns boxers, it wasn’t rapidly expanding, thank god, but that meant two other things. He sniffed, before squeezing his eyes shut at the realisation he’d just made, it was the considerably worse of the two things. “Well I’ve made a deduction.” He said, a soft sigh escaping his lips as he glanced up at the shorter man.
“What?”
A fall from that height could kill him.
Odd, John thought to himself, breaking his gaze before he was caught.
John smiled. “Go to sleep, Sherlock Holmes.”
.” He clenched his fists and squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to relax, almost. “I’m fucking scared, Sherlock. I don’t know what to do and it’s so much
“Well come on! I have charms tomorrow!”
“No, but you are. What are the symptoms of a panic-attack, you can’t tell me you’ve never read up on them, and I know for a fact once you read something, you remember it.”
“I bought milk, what’re you doing?” Johns voice hit his ears, and he realised what was happening outside of his head once again.
“Game plan- What are you going to do?” She corrected herself, rolling her eyes at the head boy, supposedly the smartest in their year, yet he still didn’t know the term
“John! I didn’t expect you to come.” A gentle voice came, and then there was Sherlock beside him. He felt the weight in his chest lift suddenly, as he glanced up at the taller man, following him in.
He pulled away, almost too abruptly for John, the suspect had now stopped staring and went back to work, deeming Sherlock’s presence unimportant. He allowed John to stare at him for a moment, eyes dilating in deep blue as he didn’t doubt his own were, that being their first kiss of hopefully many. John supposed it was rather clever, that idea, but he also supposed the taller man most likely had ulterior motives underneath. Not that he was opposed to those motives either.
He’d woken from a vicious nightmare involving his mother and a hippogriff, just about managed not to scream and wake up his dormmates, and then couldn’t get back to sleep due to the images of the dream clouding his head every time he closed his eyes longer than a blink.
He took it, her grip was firmer than expected but he didn’t mind. “John Watson.”
. He couldn’t believe he’d done it.
John’s eyes widened, before his brow furrowed. “Oh…” His face relaxed. “
“’Course you did.” Greg dropped Mycroft’s hand in favour of approaching a plant that had been particularly sensitive as of late, resulting in Mycroft’s gardening shirt being destroyed by fertiliser turned acidic when he got to close.
to make my own decisions.”
He knew Sherlock wouldn’t care, he told Sherlock immediately, well once he found a sense of trust in the taller boy. Yet it made his stomach twist when he thought about it.
"Sherlock, put your dick in me right now or so help me- ah- fuck!" John squeezed his eyes shut, his toes curling as Sherlock pushed in, he had half a mind to thrust in as hard as he could, just to shut John up, but he was gentle, but even that was almost too much for the doctor. John was warm, wet and tight around his cock and he sucked in a breath. "Shirt- off- please!" John's demand was breathless and filled with lust.
“So,-“ He cleared his throat. “Are we clear?”
“Shit.” He whispered, pulling his key out, and grabbing his trunk, he could hear footsteps from inside the house quickly approaching, and he willed his legs to move but they wouldn’t, he couldn’t breathe and he could hear his heart hammering in his head, by the time his body caught up to his brain to run, the door was pulled open and he was caught.
"What're you doing?" His tone wasn't one of outrage but asking for confirmation. He knew for a fact what Sherlock was doing. Unless it was an experiment, then he may as well shoot himself because no doubt would the taller man know in an instant, his feelings toward him.
“That’s not important.” Mycroft replied, before swiftly moving on before any more of John’s insolent questioning could continue. “How long will it be before he does something noticeable, something you cant hide? Before he breaks more than an arm or a leg, or before the injury doesn’t
“Greg Lestrade.”
“I suppose I could drag myself if it would make you happy.” Mycroft smirked, clasping his hands together. “I want to see you win though.”
“Mycroft, Mycroft Holmes.”
Sherlock spun on his heel to see another teacher at his door, standing in the door frame. He was a shorter man in a beige cable knit jumper and jeans. He was fairly short and just as soft, in nature he was firm yet polite and could shut down an entire classroom with a single yell.
“I’d hardly call it that. Idle conversation maybe, should get our first round without charge. ” Mycroft replied. Sure, enough the bartender set down the two bottles and waved Greg off when he tried to hand her the money. Taking a sip of his drink, Mycroft turned to face Greg, he didn’t particularly like butterbeer, but he couldn’t be bothered asking for anything else. It wasn’t like he could buy much at seventeen in a bar. His confidence faltered when he properly registered the Gryffindor’s frustration.  “Are you alright?”
It was almost like everything was normal.
“Why?”
He had to wait in the hospital wing for an insufferable amount of time, he was concussed apparently, which meant he had to stay for an hour at least so they could make sure he didn’t fall asleep. Lestrade had volunteered to wait with him, Sherlock couldn’t really understand why he would, but he wasn’t going to object, Greg was the second least infuriating person in the castle.
“Got it.” John replied, lifting the feathered pen up again.
“Get Madame Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall to the quidditch pitch, it’s urgent.” He tried to keep the stress out of his voice, in an attempt to convince both her and himself, that he wasn’t panicking.
"Yes- well, no one actually bites anymore and I'm not going to be using it, but essentially... yes."
But hey, it'll still probably read better than anything Moffat's been writing, amirite.
"He does that. Terrible social skills." Sherlock shot a biting smirk at his brother who returned it with a scowl.
“John, could you help me get him undressed?” Sherlock blinked as he was dropped onto the toilet like a sack of potatoes. He listed worryingly to one side, Lestrade caught his shoulder.
John's hope was in vain. After a routine raid of their client/primary suspect, they found a few telling pieces of evidence, each indicating an unhealthy level of obsession with Amelia. After a brief, unofficial interrogation the stepfather admitted that his relationship with Amelia's mother was just an act to get closer to the girl. The authorities were informed and the detective and the doctor walked away not a cent richer than before. Literally, as they hadn't money for cab fare.
“And half the town, I suppose.” Sherlock said with some annoyance, none directed in any particular direction.
"I've got a bad feeling about it." Sherlock mumbled, swinging out of the car before it came to a full stop. "The first thing we'll do is run it through your audio processing program."
“Good job, Helios. You may not be the fastest in the stable, but you’ve served me well today.” Sherlock cooed over the old beast who seemed to appreciate its little treat greatly. He guided the horse to a nearby tree, tying it securely to the trunk with plenty of leeway for the horse to wander and graze as it desires. Once it seemed content, the adventurer reached back into the saddlebag, fished out a small leather bound book and a pair of gloves and went to work.
“Yes.” Sherlock mumbled. “Reciprocation, it’s very important to us.”
John hit the ground hard, losing his breath for a moment as Sherlock sat on his stomach, barely even trying to hold him down. The vampire breathed deeply but evenly while John gasped for air. His eyes were sharp and hungry and his skin dry and pale. He hadn’t even broken a sweat. John moaned.
Mrs. Hudson came in with a platter of breakfast foods nearly as big as she was. "Good morning, John. And Sherlock! Oh, I do hope your case went well. That was a long one, wasn't it? From the way you looked yesterday, I was sure you wouldn't be up and about until next week. I had a boyfri-"
A hum filled the space behind his ears as he listened to the dial tone. A sickly, coarse vibration. John called it stress and forgot about it as Lestrade picked up.
"I was kidnapped." He explained simply, as if there was anything simple about it. "... Why are you on top of me?"
“Of course it’s fake.” Sherlock hissed back, before turning his attention back to the vampire. “Let him live the rest of his miserable life in prison. Let him be known as the worthless loser who stole innocent  children in a pathetic attempt to win back his girlfriend. But do not destroy your own life by killing him.”
“Y-you mean the skull.” John felt, the way a suddenly blinded man feels a doorknob, that he was missing something. “So... He's your boyfriend?"
“So, we’re just doomed.” John kicked at the bars, causing them to clatter with the most annoying of sounds. “That’s just. Perfect!”
John rolled his eyes and set it aside. Sherlock found it rather surprising that a fire wasn’t the first thing on his mind, as he was wearing only a flimsy tunic. “I don’t know why you can’t do it yourself. Doesn’t anyone in your fancy castle know these things?”
“Didn’t you notice their breath?”
John made a conscious effort not to read too far into that.
“Oh, you have no idea. Sometimes those messed up kids do it in the patch of woods near my house! Oh, the noise.” She went on, describing in detail how much the matter upsets her poor old grandmother, who is in a rather delicate state, mentally speaking, and gets awfully disturbed by so many things. “And of course, the police won’t do anything because many of them are probably their kids.”
Outside, he spotted the end of Sherlock's dressing gown disappearing through the open window.
“Are you aware that you have the typing skills of a dyslexic pidgeon?” Sherlock groaned as he sprawled across the couch. Unfortunately, that particular mystery had turned out to be too boring to please Sherlock. John didn’t understand how a break-in followed by a missing person’s case which actually turned out to be a case of long-term burglary could be boring. But he didn’t understand many things these days.
“Not all night. Just the past hour.” The vampire replied, casually checking the time on his phone. “To be fair, I wasn’t really watching you. Of all the sights in this room, you simply happen to be the least offensive to the eye.”
At first, John wasn't terribly worried as it fell within the parameters of caseless moodiness. Even when hours stretched into days, he considered it better than him going on a boredom-fueled destructive rampage. Besides, he was out of the apartment for a significant amount of time. So it was likely that Sherlock could have been up and about while John was out. Or in his room. Or sleeping. There was really no way to know for certain that he hadn't.
Sherlock just flashed him an infuriatingly knowing smile. As if he’d just told a joke and didn't even know it yet. The brilliant green of his eyes seemed to whisper ‘slap me, you know want to’.”You’re a soldier recently discharged due to an injury. You’re living in a bedsit which you can barely afford and as a consequence feel cornered enough to sell your life’s blood to keep it, even though you hate it so much you often consider just sleeping on the street. You have nothing to live for, no one to miss you but no reason to die. As far as I'm concerned, we've been talking about nothing but flatmates." Sherlock grinned viciously, his eyes gleaming green under the sterile hospital light. John sucked in a breath and held it. He was angry. Seething. Furious. He felt like putting a bullet through the man's laughing eyes or slitting his throat and letting him drown in his own arterial spray.
Sherlock rose and threw open the fridge door in a whirl of motion and satin. "Don't worry about not finishing it. She's usually too high to be offended," He commented as he sat back down with a plastic bag labelled 'Lestrade' in his hand. He opened a valve at one end of it and began sucking it as he settled back in his seat.
John risked a glance behind him. The father of the kidnapped children looked rather normal. His hair was just barely starting to grey and his face was lined from years of kindly smiles. Circumstances aside, he seemed like he could've been a reasonable man. Except now there was murder in his eyes and John severely doubted a nice conversation would help much. The room was filled with the dizzying harmonies of the kidnapped children’s fear and their father’s anger. The sound wasn’t at all like it was on the videos. It was strong and pure, less like a hum and more like a finger pulled around the rim of a crystal glass in the center of an amphitheater. It seemed to have an effect on everyone in the room. The kidnapper was shaking so hard, John feared he might either liquify on the spot or have a muscle spasm and pull the trigger on accident. The army doctor manage to hold himself together, but it was taking a significant amount of effort to ignore the sway of the room. Sherlock stood against it like a cliff against a raging storm.
“What on earth is that?” John asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.
Lestrade groaned. He really wasn't fond of these dramatic types. Sure, they were ultimately easier to catch, what with their arrogance and need for attention. But the crime scenes were always so gruesome. Not to mention the panic when the media sunk their teeth into it.
He swept out of the room without another word.
"Just yesterday you borrowed ten quid from a member of your homeless network to pay a cabbie."
“We haven’t spoken in forty years, alright?” Sherlock grumbled, falling onto the edge of the coffeetable with a huff.
“I am a doctor, you know.” John pointed out, speaking mostly to the wall. “I have experience with naked bodies.”
