"Your Highness!" Uriel calls from the camp, and Dean lets himself crouch on the bank of the stream, in this brief moment of quiet, for just a few seconds longer. It's going to be the last time he gets to himself for the rest of today, of that he's quite certain.
Slowly, the corners of the boy’s lips curve up. “Okay,” he says finally. “That’d be cool. Thanks…?”
Cas opens his mouth, then closes it again, and finally grins, big and wide and happy. "Wow," he says quietly. "That is very sweet, Dean. I'd been wondering when I was going to tell you how I felt for such a long time and I—I never thought it would happen like this."
“So, Dean,” he says, taking out his notebook and thumbing the cap of his pen, poised and ready to take notes. “What can you tell me about this vigilante?”
In any other situation, Dean would have requested a new roommate, a room swap,
One hand slides under the hem of Dean’s shirt, grazing over the edges of one of the many scars littered across Dean’s skin. It makes him pause for a second, drawing back from the kiss to study Dean. In that moment of quiet scrutiny, Dean just looks up at Cas. They size each other up once more, and Dean makes a face as if to say—
They can tell, just from the way he dresses, that he's different, and he's never in his life been looked at like this before.
It's perfect.
Alexei nods, then refocuses his gaze on the front doors again. Dean eyes him, but instead of fear, there’s an amused uptick of his lips.
He teaches Dean, who focuses his grace very hard, tongue poking out between his lips. Finally, the snowflake materializes—a little lopsided, but totally unique and completely perfect. It’s beautiful, more so because it’s Dean’s.
Cas just hums, rubbing a thumb over his jaw and leaving a black smudge of semi-dried paint in its wake. He adds a few more brushstrokes, loose-limbed and careless, then puts the paintbrush down and pulls the cigarette from between his lips. “At least I don’t throw shit around when my sculptures don’t turn out how I want them to,” he jabs back, his tone laid back but his words sharp.
“There you are,” Dean murmurs quietly, pressing his lips to the top of Cas’s head. “Come back to me, sweetheart.”
“Why did you do this?” he growls, turning his gaze back on the man, who is still sitting there watching him with that stupid curve of a smile on his lips. “What, you’re trying to show me that you’re fucking better than me or something?”
When Castiel looks back up, he’s not sure if Sam is laughing or crying. His hands are pressed against his mouth, and there are tears running down his cheeks, but the crinkle of his eyes and the shake of his shoulders suggest that whatever the meaning behind this word, it’s enough to make him laugh through his grief.
fixing cars, I’m guessing?” Dean teases, but there’s a curious edge to his words, and Castiel levels him with a hard look that, for the first time today, seems to put Dean on the back foot.
into that one kiss. It communicates more about Dean’s current state of mind than Castiel could have expected, and when Dean pulls back, it feels as though he has a much clearer vision of what Dean needs tonight.
way. As long as they each have their outlets and their escapes, they’re not at each other’s throats, and they continue to exist in the precarious balance that they’ve figured out.
“Okay,” he says decidedly, because it’s the truth. He
His words are honest, open, and Castiel can feel his heart splintering.
He looks pale in the light of Cas’s lamp, his fingers curled loosely against the dirty cloth still pressed against his wound. Castiel sets the bucket and the bundle of supplies down on the ground by the door, then makes his way to Dean on careful, quiet feet, and reaches out to touch him gently on the good shoulder.
He also forgets to return the umbrella to its place by the front door.
Luckily, Death lets Castiel have time to internally process this information, continuing on while Castiel tries to come to terms with the realization that after over a hundred and fifty years confined to this cemetery, he will finally be able to leave its grounds.
have Dean.
The sound of his heaving echoes off the walls as he retches over and over again, until his panicked, clenching stomach has nothing more to give. As he settles back on his heels and tries to just
The other boy doesn’t say anything—when Cas finally looks back over at him, he finds that he’s being watched by those green eyes. How does this boy, with his black eye and his too-large leather jacket, have eyes that make it seem like he’s seen more than Cas could ever imagine?
he signed the partnership paperwork. He sets his jaw, displeasure continuing to mount, but nods his head anyway.
Castiel shakes his head. “It’s a pretty big deal to be invited, as much as I don’t want to have to spend the evening with Adler. It could be a good leg up into the curating world. We’re allowed to bring a partner though, and it would be much more bearable with you there, so…” He nudges his nose against Dean’s ear, smiling when it makes him chuckle. “Fancy keeping me company?”
(See the end of the chapter for
No one mourns Castiel, because there are so many others to mourn.
Dean runs his fingers through his hair, then sighs, as though the weight of the world is on his shoulders. “So I followed up all the leads I thought could be related to the clue, but… honestly, I’ve come up short. And every day that I’m wasting is another day that the amulet could be used for destructive purposes, so here I am.” He gives Castiel a helpless look and shrugs his shoulders. “I need your help again.”
*      *      *
There's something warm pressed against his back. It doesn't give and it isn't very soft, so Dean knows it isn't his pregnancy pillow. There's an arm on his hip, close to baby Fruitcake. His pillow is sandwiched between him and the rest of the body attached to it.
“Okay,” he says shakily, almost unable to believe that this is real, that it’s
, but that’s okay.
And then his gaze falls on something achingly familiar.
And so he walks along the boardwalk, smiling at the vendors he recognises and watching children shriek in joy on each ride, just like he had for so many years. He walks until he reaches the very end of the boardwalk, where he stands with his hands in his pockets and looks out over the ocean.
Cas’s hand smooths over Dean’s left asscheek, where a mark is surely blooming beneath the fabric of the panties. “Would you like to try that again?”
Dean sucks in a shocked breath, and when the man turns his head sharply, his wide eyes are the exact same shade of blue as those of Dean’s crow.
that problem.
He makes a compelling argument, but Castiel still narrows his eyes.
Dean keeps his answer short and confident.
doing seemingly good deeds, it’s not his place to decide who is good and who is bad.
Thank you
Cas doesn’t bother with showering, or brushing his teeth, or any of his usual nightly routine. Instead, he strips out of his clothes with heavy hands and drops them to the floor, then crawls beneath the covers of his bed.
seeing his mark, but if there was some way to hide it in plain sight…
Research used to be Dean’s least favourite part of hunting.
Well, it’s more than a little hot. This guy is a talented fighter, and Dean can respect that.
“It’s not
“Jo! Are you harassing my client out there?”
It’s clear that Dean is trying his hardest to stay awake, but his eyes are slowly drooping until they slide closed all the way. “Not fair,” he mutters. “I’m s’posed to be the one who can tell people to do things.”
Wordlessly, Castiel turns on his heel and walks back towards the building. He’s well-practiced in feigning carelessness while being hyperaware of what’s going on around him, and that’s what he does now, keeping an ear out for Dean’s footfalls. In the reflection of the glass windows, he sees Dean follow after him, all laidback swagger and eyes that are definitely admiring the way Castiel’s ass looks in his suit.
Dean has been feeling just generally tired and anxious all day, and now it’s dinnertime and the feeling still hasn’t disappeared, and he’s over it. He’s sick of the world, and he’s sick of being stuck in the bunker, and damn it, tonight he just wants to be fuckin’ cuddled.
On Christmas Day, Dean comes to visit.
By the time the song finishes, Castiel has been sitting with his mouth open for three and a half minutes with no work to show for it. The last notes of the song fade, and then Dean opens his eyes, made vulnerable and raw by the music. His smile is fragile, as though that rendition could have been anything less than perfect, as though Castiel could possibly find any room for improvement. Cas has recorded a lot of artists, but none of them had managed to floor him quite as thoroughly as what he’d just witnessed.
Before Dean can say anything else stupid or awkward (or both, god fucking forbid), he forces himself into action. He can stand here by his counter being a whole dumbass around Cas all day, but if he’s actually moving around, talking about his plants, he might stand more of a chance.
Once they’ve eaten, they move to the sitting room, where Castiel tucks himself up in one of the armchairs and watches with amusement as Dean picks over the room like a child excited by his favourite toys. There is no shortage of unique books or magical artifacts in this house—most of them harmless but all of them rare and intriguing—and for Dean, it must be like Christmas.
“Deal.”
Being with Dean? Being
awake. But neither of them move. Neither of them say anything at all—just keep lying there, pressed close beneath the blankets, listening to the rhythm of each other’s breathing.
But it feels different now.
to let Cas, an angel, do just that… it’s not something he wants to read too much into. Not now. Not yet.
It’s only a matter of minutes before he speaks again.
He is all grass-green eyes and curving smiles, sharp and relaxed all at once where he leans against the bar and converses easily with the bartender. The light enhances the spatter of his freckles, glows through the beer on the bar in front of him. He has one hand in the pocket of his jeans, effortlessly battered but clean, and his flannel hugs the planes of his body in a way that has more than half of the bar watching him.
"O-okay."
He was seconds away from un-pretzeling himself and punching his giagantor brother in the neck. He may have been in the early weeks of his pregnancy, but there was now a considerable little bump under his shirt.
He reaches out a hand to her, ready to help her pass over to wherever normal spirits go next. But instead of taking his hand like he’d expected—her fingers close around Castiel’s wrist.
Dean soften more than he sees it, and the gently murmured, “Love you too,” is exactly what Castiel needs to bolster his courage and give him the confidence he needs to face the world.
They move awkwardly around each other as Dean steps over the threshold, trading shy smiles as they get used to sharing space again. Dean is clearly paying attention to something else as he pulls off his boots, however, and when he turns back to Castiel, there’s a glint of something in his eyes. “Dinner smells awesome, Cas. Do you have dessert?”
. “On your stool is fine,” Castiel murmurs, and he half expects to see disappointment on Dean’s face, but he shows no such signs as he takes a seat, close enough to Castiel that their knees are almost touching.
“Hey, old man. It’s been a while.”
The front window looks a little cracked, and he can see the silhouette of the pilot inside, slumped in his chair, but neither of those facts concern him right now. As long as everything holds together long enough for him to make it to the nearest port and disappear, he’ll be home scot-free.
Dean is kneeling at the foot of Castiel’s bed, hands clasped loosely behind his back and head hanging down. His breathing is slow, even. In, out. In, out.
Dean can only watch, mesmerized, as he scoops a handful of ice into a glass, spins the bottle casually against his palm, then uncaps it and pours out a few fingers of whiskey. The golden ambience of the bar lighting illuminates the liquid and haloes the beautiful man, and it takes all of Dean’s willpower not to blurt out an invitation back to his hotel right in that moment.
“Castiel, huh? Just the name I expected for an eclectic bookstore owner—and I mean that in the best way,” he rushes to add, and this time, it’s Castiel’s turn to chuckle.
,” he whispers, like he can’t help it, like it’s been forced out of his very being.
They don't bother writing through their tutors any more—it hadn't taken Dean long to get good at writing, with the right motivation (which he now realises had been his tutor's intention the whole time, the sneaky old man), and now he just gives his letters straight to their messenger.
While Dean works, Cas flies, carefree and happy as he dances in the cold night air. Dean can practically
They still smell like Cas, and after a few pages, he finds his eyes wandering away from the words, towards the man with the birds-nest hair who’s humming quietly along to his music in the kitchen. Eventually, he gives up on the book and lets his gaze and mind wander.
Dean’s car has always been his sanctuary.
His parents had known that something was amiss. That something had called their son from their home that day, enticed him out into the forest.
They get all the way back to her place, and he’s kissing her, hands sliding up the inside of her shirt, and—
If he’s honest, Cas has been a little bit nervous about Dean meeting Inias. Inias is, after all, pretty much Castiel’s only family and the first friend he’d made when he’d moved out here, so his opinion means everything to Cas, and if the two of them don’t get along…
When he makes his way back out of his bedroom, half-drunk coffee mug back in his hands and a jittery feeling in his chest that’s definitely not just caused by the caffeine, Cas finds Dean sitting at his dining table and looking out the window towards the rising sun. It’s a beautiful, serene moment, and he can’t help but press a quick kiss gently to the top of Dean’s head as he passes.
Dean, clever man that he is, is very aware of this.
He’s sitting in his pine tree when he finally accepts it, legs dangling off the branch and palms pressed against the bark. The sun is setting over the horizon, and as Castiel finds himself washed in golds and oranges, he finally lets the thought take shape, like a sob he can’t keep holding back any longer.
“Not at all, detective. You’re very good at your job—I’m sure you would have caught these two the night we met, if you hadn’t forgotten to check your six. No, I brought them here tonight as a…” he shrugs his shoulders thoughtfully, then leans forward, elbows resting on his thighs. “As a gift. A gesture of goodwill. I don’t like having someone as handsome as you hate me quite this much, Novak.”
is as soon as the smell hits his nose.
But that’s not an option. Not with Sam, and not with anyone, not any more.
It takes a second to realize what Dean means—and then he puts the pieces together, and it feels like he’s taken a punch to the gut.
, he’s had to work on this, and of course he’s bringing it right down to the wire. Nothing like the threat of a looming deadline to kick one’s ass into gear. “I’m screwed.”
Even once they’re out of earshot, it’s a few moments before Dean speaks. Castiel doesn’t press him, just waits patiently.
There’s a bathroom just down the hall, in the direction of the main entrance, and that’s where Castiel heads now. It’s quieter here, and it gives him an opportunity to breathe and to pull himself back together a little more. Everything is okay. In fact, everything is
Still, the black mark stays put.
The cabin is small, sparsely-furnished, but reasonably cozy. A single bed, a bathroom, a fireplace, a TV tucked away in the corner, and a small kitchen off to the side.
, he’s such a cocky bastard.
The clang of the steel door behind him rings out through the room, slowly fading out into silence.
Cas is the Head Boy, the one predicted to score straight Os on all his NEWTs, the one who's basically a shoe-in for a good position at the Ministry, should he want it.
Dean blinks, soft and surprised, and then a smile curves across his parted lips. Slowly, deliberately, he moves his hands off Castiel’s thighs and clasps them behind his back, then kneels there. He is waiting for Castiel’s lead, pliant and submissive in his perfect,
, he tells himself. Once he has his tattoo, people won’t look at his mark any more, like it’s a symbol of status and power. He just wants it to blend in with the ink and disappear.
Dean leans back against the door as it closes behind them, happy to feel something solid under him so that if his body decides now is the time to give up and pass out, he doesn't have far to go.
It hadn’t been something he’d been aware was missing from his daily life, but he realizes very quickly that it’s nice to feel desired. Wanted.
“Somewhere quiet,” he mutters, leaning his head against Cas’s shoulder and losing himself in the gentle touches. “I don’t want to see any other people. Just you, and me, and a comfy bed with some beers and a scenic view.”
Castiel struggles with telling Dean how he feels.
Funnily enough, neither of them can really bring themselves to care.
Is Dean.
Castiel blinks across the cemetery faster than he ever has before, ignoring the way that it’s draining his power at a rapid rate alongside whatever had previously put him out of action. He scans every inch of his grounds, frantic and panicking—
Before he can reply, though, Johnnie’s form starts to become even more transparent, until Castiel can see the grass through him. His arms are no longer embracing the boy, but passing through him and then Castiel blinks, and he’s gone.
“Dean,” he chokes out, his voice thick with tears. “I—this is what you two were working on?”
(With the stipulation that they’re not hanging up their hats
And then he forces the thought out of his mind, and slowly crawls under the blankets that haven’t been used since he was last here. He’s so tired and so heavy that sleep is quick to take him, his heart aching.
There’s a tiny grocery store nearby, but it really only carries the basics. He can get some of the groceries he can’t grow there, sure, but to buy the things he needs for his
Dean struggles to find his class on his first day at college, and an attractive stranger helps him out.
When Dean replies, it’s so easy to visualize the smile on his face. “Of course. I’ll be over once I’m done with work, probably around five thirty or six.”
No matter how hard he wishes…
There are no words exchanged as they get comfortable, Dean’s back pressed against Castiel’s chest and Cas’s arm curved around Dean’s waist, like two halves of the same whole. It feels cozy and intimate and
“You’re teasing me,” Dean accuses breathlessly as Castiel reaches his waistband, raising himself up on his elbows to watch as Castiel works open the front of his pants.
Everything about it is slow, gentle, the antithesis to how sex usually is for Dean. But in the quiet of the night, with everything that’s been shared still hanging between them and the moonlight filtering in through the windows, it feels
It’s a few minutes before a reply comes through—which isn’t as quickly as he might have liked, but it’s the end of the work day and Dean is surely packing up, so Cas should be thankful that it didn’t take longer.
“How’s your day been?” he asks once Dean has turned the music down, leaning his hip against the edge of Dean’s desk and surveying his work.
(See the end of the chapter for
Three days after Dean had been supposed to visit him, a new person shows up at the gates of Castiel’s cemetery.
Silence—and then the quiet rustling of footsteps.
“Sam?” he breathes, and he feels as though his entire body has turned to ice. Dean was meant to be visiting Sam in just a few days, but if Sam is
His heart skips in his chest.
Everything in Dean’s brain seems to halt, stuck on those few words.
Dean scoffs and shakes his head. “Dude, you serious? No way—it was actually really good. I was kinda mad that you figured out how to cancel it, though, ‘cause the ending didn’t print. That’s kinda why I came over here, actually—part of it, anyway. I’d like to know how everything ends, if you’ve got more of it for me to read.”
It’s Castiel’s job to keep him settled. He’s not allowed to help after the smoke alarm fiasco of ’16, so he does his duties in emotional support. “It’s going to taste great, Dean,” becomes his mantra, but he doesn’t mind.
“Shh, babe, I’m here. Listen to my voice. I’ve got you, okay? Whatever you’re thinking in that brain of yours, it’s not true—you’re such a good person, and her being here doesn’t change that at all. I’ve got you, and I trust you, and I love you.”
“It says,” Dean begins, his fingertip following the words as he reads so that Castiel can follow along, “
They stay put for the rest of the tornado, but remain alert just in case anything changes. It's beautiful and powerful, especially with the setting sun behind it giving everything a slightly golden hue through the rain and lightning. For a while, Dean just stands there beside Cas, relishing in the storm's power and watching as it makes its way across the landscape, very slowly weakening in power until it's wisping into a thin rope tornado, the funnel leaving the ground and snaking up into the air until it's dissipated completely.
The sound of rushing water gets louder the further down the hill he gets, until the path opens out past the treeline and he comes to a stop on the edge of the river.
But Cas is there. Cas is always there.
They kiss until Castiel barely knows which way is up, until he’s
He means it. He means every word, truly and genuinely, and it makes Castiel pause. Dean’s doing this to
—and he has no idea how he got here.
Holding his gaze, Castiel takes two steps to his right—closer to the walk-in freezer. Dean lets his grin widen. "Warmer. Or, should I say...

Castiel finally lets himself be happy.
, Castiel thinks, and he gives no response. He may not have a choice about being partnered—the Men of Letters are powerful, and do not like being defied—but he isn’t about to feign enthusiasm just to please them.
“Dean, you—you can’t,” he says, sliding his hands down until they’re curled against Dean’s chest. He wants to push him away, to tell him to
The setup they have going on is... a little more modern than it had been in their Dad's day, that's for sure. While John had begun his storm chasing career with little more than the Impala’s radio and a rudimentary knowledge of the air patterns throughout Tornado Alley, the tech Sam and Dean use is much safer and more precise, to say the least.
“I would like… for this to be a date,” he says, and he’s surprised by how steady his voice is when he says that. “I would like to date you.”
means you’re not bullshittin’ me. I don’t feel like becoming a monster’s shish kebab tonight. So what the hell are you here for?”
Finally, once Dean starts to feel his eyelids drooping, and the stars have shifted across the sky, he pulls himself up off the ground and brushes himself off. As much as he wishes he could, he can't stay here all night.
He wets his lips, suddenly so dry, and feels his breath hitch in his chest as Dean’s gaze drops. In a single second, the air between them becomes so electric that Castiel almost doesn’t dare to breathe. Slowly, Dean lifts his hand, curving his fingers against Castiel’s jaw, and when Castiel doesn’t pull back, he leans in.
Whoever he is, he doesn’t respond.
Dean is standing in the doorway that leads to the back rooms, one shoulder leaning against the wall and his arms crossed loosely over his chest. He’s wearing a t-shirt today, and his sub mark is on full display, dark ink encircling his wrist in a sacred space that none of his tattoos dare touch.
“Hello,” Castiel whispers back.
“I wish you could come with me,” Dean says one day. Guitar riffs curl upwards towards a cloudy blue sky. “In the Impala. We could just listen to classic rock and fuckin’ drive. You’ve never experienced music until you’ve played it as loud as you can with the windows down and the highway wind in your hair, Cas.”
It’s gotten a lot more run-down in Bobby’s old age, that’s for sure. The forest has started to reclaim some of the land, and there are weeds sprouting all throughout the fields. “Son of a bitch,” Dean says quietly. He’d had dreams of moving out here to a farm already running smoothly and just requiring a bit of overseeing, but this… this is a lot more than he’d anticipated.
Over and over again—like that’s the only thing that Cas is capable of broadcasting right now. But Dean doesn’t. He
But he can’t ever say that. The risk of losing their friendship, of losing
“What do you think I did?” he asks quietly. “I met you, Dean, when you were younger. We talked. Your mother—“
“Sam,” he whispers, even though he knows it’s futile because Dean is the only one who can see him, and now Dean is—
Once the proposed design is complete (or so Dean says, since Castiel won’t see it until the day of his appointment), he doesn’t hear from the artist again, and so he’s left to his own thoughts and anticipation once more.
The gun goes off.
Dean doesn’t nod this time, but instead Castiel swears that he leans closer, the gap between Dean’s shoulder and Cas’s thigh narrowing.
in a way that he hasn’t in years, and it’s wonderful.
Benny pats him on the shoulder, much gentler than he had to Castiel, then replaces his chair at the neighboring table and disappears back into the kitchen.
“Nah, not
“You’re welcome,” Dean says, fondness in his voice. His thumb strokes over Castiel’s knuckles, and he sighs out a little exhale as he gets comfortable against the mattress. “Ready for sleep?”
Dean looks up, eyebrows raised, and there’s a smudge of graphite across one cheekbone that makes Castiel’s heart flip in his chest. “What happened? Something good, I’m guessing?”
,” Dean protests hotly, his cheeks burning with shame and embarrassment. It’s clear that the President wants nothing to do with his stupid infatuation, but Dean doesn’t protect him because of some fucking crush, he does it because he took an oath to serve his country and if this is how he does so then so fucking be it.
“He would’ve if you hadn’t shown up,” Dean mutters, “but I was lured over here by the promise of beer and my hot boyfriend.”
And suddenly, Dean is back on board with the whole Christmas thing.
They’re running out of time.
Dean steps closer, and returns the up-and-down appraisal that he’d received. The joke’s on him, though, because the guy is even prettier up close. “My name is Dean,” he says. “Dean Winchester. I’ve come to have my fortune told.”
It’s only a minute before they stop outside a door, letting a handful of other students go in before them. “Well, here we are,” Cas says. “Good luck with your semester, Dean.”
“Oh,” he feels himself say, even as he hurtles into Hell alongside hundreds of his brothers and sisters. It doesn’t feel like enough, but how does one put into words that feeling of realisation, of the world falling into place like it never has before?
“Alright.” Dean straightens up, works the kinks out of his back, then wipes over the tattoo one more time before sitting back. “Ready to take a look?”
“What, no foreplay?” he asks, tilting his head. “No ‘hey, how are you?’ Not gonna ask how my day was? How many people I had to avoid to get out here tonight?”
He’s not sure if Dean was expecting to be turned away, because something in him lights up when Castiel motions for him to sit. He does a reasonable job of containing it, but it’s clear to Castiel in the curve of his smile, and the eager way he slides into the booth.
Cas kisses him again, swallowing the choked-out pleas and needy whimpers, hands roaming over his skin. He fits his hand against the handprint on Dean’s shoulder, and for a second it burns white-hot—and then pleasure crashes over Dean like a wave, stronger and more intoxicating than he’s ever felt before.
for him, in the same way that the half-mask draws Castiel’s eyes to the curve of the man’s jaw and has his interest more than piqued.
“Yes, Dean,” he says quietly. “Like a date.”
Tomorrow comes, as tomorrow often does.
From the way he says it, light and conversational but with an edge of steel beneath it, Castiel doesn’t think he has much of a choice in whether he says yes.
And as he turns to look towards the cemetery, he sees two figures standing on either side of the gate—a little transparent, like him. One of them, Sam doesn’t recognize, but he knows in his heart that that’s Cas, and from his kind eyes and gentle smile, Sam understands immediately why Dean fell for him.
prince, and there would come a time in his life where he would have to make a sacrifice for his kingdom.
“Hey,” he murmurs, cupping Dean’s cheek in his hand and guiding him back until his gaze is meeting Castiel’s once more. “I’m going to let you come tonight, but you have… options. I can make you come now, with my mouth, or… we can make use of the tube of lubricant I purchased last week.”
Her grip tightens, and Castiel is too shocked to do anything but scrabble at the death-grip of her fingers.
As much as Castiel wants to stay with Dean, however, eventually they end up out the front of his apartment building, and all the emotional weight of the day catches up to him. If it wasn’t a weeknight, and he didn’t feel as though he could fall asleep on any vaguely horizontal surface that was presented to him, he would invite Dean in, but unfortunately common sense wins out.
Beneath the cloth, Dean’s wound is red and angry. Castiel sucks in a sharp breath between his teeth, and tries to be gentle as he touches the skin. Past a tiny flinch and a quick closing of his eyes, though, Dean doesn’t react.
But there’s something that seizes his attention, not in his head but in his heart. A feeling that hooks behind his sternum and guides him forward, telling him:
to encounter the march as it’s underway, in all its rainbow glory.
The man casts one look back at the grave, and it’s impossible to miss the fear in his eyes. He doesn’t reply.
Warnings for: alcohol use, smoking, brief mention of drug use.
And then he’s kissing Cas, kissing him with frustration and anger, biting at his lips and pulling at his hair. Cas gives back as good as he gets, digging his nails into Dean’s skin while he reaches out blindly for the nearest available surface to put his cigarette out on. Dean’s air tastes like smoke and whiskey and a little bit of weed, and he drinks it in like he’s drowning. Drinks
Before that thought can circle back to the existential panic that’s laced his thoughts for the past week or so, however, Dean manages to derail him once more. “Yeah, we didn’t get to talk much about your work before,” he says, leaning his hip against the edge of the counter and raising his eyebrows at Castiel. “How about we get started with cooking dinner, and you tell me about it while we work? I don’t know about you, but I’ve barely eaten all day, and I’m fucking starving.
(See the end of the chapter for
Drunk Dean, though?
He can only be Cas. Broken, fucked-up Cas, but...
scenario, with whips and leashes and whatnot. He doesn’t really have much to base his perception of dominating off of, after all, other than what he sees in the media, and…
“Yes, Dean. That is an order.”
Castiel waits for a long minute after he’s knocked—until he hears the sound of a deadbolt drawing back, and the door swings open with a heavy rasp of metal.
At the sight of him, the chat explodes, telling Dean just how hot they think his boyfriend is, and already giving suggestions as to what they should do—or, mostly, what Cas should do to Dean. Some of the things that get mentioned have Dean shifting excitedly, the tension in him ratcheting up even further. They’ve got a strict plan for today, but that won’t stop Dean from filing away some of the suggestions for a later stream, if Cas is down.
As it turns out, he need not have worried.
The meeting point they’d chosen is an intersection in downtown Brooklyn—Castiel, of course, is the first one to arrive. Doing his best to look casual and nonchalant, he leans against the brickwork of a nearby building and tries not to treat every random stranger who passes by as a possible threat.
Dean groans at the tease. “I’m not some kind of stripper, babe,
“You… you made this for me?” he asks, and there’s an awed tone to his voice. “Cas, it’s beautiful, I—“
Written for jemariel's birthday!
Thank god his appointment isn’t until the afternoon, and he’s going to have some time to become slightly more human again before he has to face Dean.
who I am. I’m so broken that I… I don’t know how I’m going to do this. I don’t know that I’m
They had spent the entire morning grooming each one of the horses and cleaning the stable, and his father had dressed him in his finest clothes (a half-decent tunic and a pair of breeches without stains on them). Dean had stood with the rest of the stable staff while a red and gold-draped procession had made its way down from the palace.
"Tell me about it," Dean mutters. He takes off his crown and runs his fingers through his hair, then pushes off the door and makes his way over to the bed, where their dinner outfits have been laid out. Dean's is simpler this time, something he's much more comfortable wearing, but he doesn't want to change into it just yet, so instead he drops his crown onto the bed beside the clothes and sighs.
Since Inias moved out, his room has stayed empty, the door closed. Castiel is neat enough that he hasn’t needed it for storage, and he only requires so much space for himself, so he hasn’t really had a use for it. When Dean comes over, he takes him in there for the first time, and together, they map out a new use for the space. Half of it will be a studio for Dean, complete with a desk and storage areas, and then the other half will be a home office for Castiel.
There’s pain in Dean’s voice, when he talks about Sam, but also a kind of numbness. As though he’s long since locked away the part of him that mourns a relationship that is just a ghost of what it once was.
Castiel’s chest clenches, and his kneejerk reaction is to shake his head and insist that he’s fine, that nothing’s going on—
always get one, which is honestly weird to me." He grins, throwing Sam a joking wink. "Guess the viewers must like the eye candy."
Dean goes still, his gaze snapping up to Castiel’s. There’s confusion in his expression, his head tilted slightly to the side. “What’s up?”
Castiel only realizes that it’s been a year since Dean died when Sam comes to visit.
, Dean thinks to himself.
Show some love to the original
“I love you too, Cas,” Dean whispers. “So fucking much.”
“Alright, I’ll make you a bowl.”
He winks at Cas, who just gives him an amused eyeroll.
. That tell him he doesn’t deserve the love he has so tentatively found.
(See the end of the chapter for
The man inclines his head, slowly and regally.
But one night—one stupid, drunken night—he gives into curiosity. He’s never met a crossroads demon, and so, in the moonlight, Dean assembles a box and buries it beneath the crossroads near his motel.
“I thought you might like to be my witch,” Castiel says quietly.
Which is what had inspired tonight’s outfit.
Dean’s feet are moving before he even registers it, but he doesn’t care, because all he can think about is Cas. Cas’s eyes widen as Dean closes the distance between them, and Dean sees him brace himself—
He’s just as closed off as Dean, now, but in an entirely different way, his shoulders tense and gaze fixed on the mixtape. His knuckles turn white with how hard he’s gripping it, as though he’s barely keeping himself together, and Dean aches.
Hell.
"H-hey Jody, been awhile...how have you been?"
But, Dean's eyes glaze over in this shroud of darkness, and Castiel fears Dean wouldn't be able to answer even if he asked. Gently, he cups the side of Dean's face, ever-so-slowly turning him towards him.
He was ready to finish this conversation, already hurrying to his room to change when Doctor Mercury spoke up again.
"The amulet. He asked for the tracker to find Chuck."
He marches on, more enthusiastic about shopping now that he's got a goal,
Shit, if he had known Cas was going to go to the other side of the world and lose his grace, he never would have given him the amulet.
*     *      *
Just the mention of sleep made Dean tired. But, ralphing up his guts and doing an hour of research would do that. He barely registered Cas pulling him to rest against his side, but Dean was too out of it to care. Cas was warm and he smelled like woodsy goodness. The angel's arms came around him without provocation. A smile was tugging at the corner of his mouth as Dean cuddled into his chest.
He was dead.
"Doc, I gotta be honest, I got pretty weird luck so if I'm sick it's probably something weird or something old. If it's bad, I'm telling you, I probably got it. And if I don't got it, I'll probably get flattened by a piano or something on my way out of the office."
Babies-R-us.
Sam is still dead to the world, faintly snoring, and Cas is ever the peaceful angel, unmoving from his place.
It wasn't until three days later that Dean remembered his slip up. He was alone in the bunker, for once Sammy had finally gotten off of his back with his mother henning.
"It's yours." He says, not so much a question, but Castiel still picks up the tone. The angel, well, former-angel nods.
Dean had specifically told Cas to watch out for Sammy, not ditch him as soon as he left the picture.
He's going stir crazy. They've never worried over him like this before and it's driving him insane.
With that in mind Dean went to look over Sam's picks, putting back what he absolutely hated, and grabbing more sweatpants than absolutely necessary.
They totally tricked him. They weakened his defenses, waited until he was full and on the brink of sleep to pounce.
Dean straightened up at the question. Sobering instantly, like a light switch went off in his head. Jody was a Sheriff. She had
The first thing he does when he wakes up is think about coffee, but Sam and the dumb doctor said he needed to cut back on his caffeine intake.
If he were still an angel, all he would have to do is look into Dean's soul to see what was ailing him.
Sam rolls his eyes, no longer affected by the dress, and turns to Jody.
Dean's stomach flutters at that word.
My b, sorry for playing with you're emotions. It's done this time, I promise. (The chapter, not the story.)
Not that Dean would be doing much catching. He was done.
kids. You've never had to raise another living being," a small smile creeps onto Dean's face and it has Sam cocking up an eyebrow in response.
Surrounded by baby bottles and tiny toenail clippers, he's practically itching to talk to someone that has a uterus. (Which is a thing he's pretty sure Amara gave him. Not like he could cook up a kid without one.) His phone is burning a hole in his pocket and dammit, there were those weird crossed lines again.
Sam nodded. "I'm not upset about that," he starts, but at his brother's expression he rolls his eyes. "All right, maybe if I was younger or even a little less mature, I
"Dean," He tries, but there's no stopping the breakdown. Dean is trying to grab the seat belt, but he's so manic-y and overwhelmed that his hands aren't working right.
His heart is beating, slowly reaching his ears until he can hardly hear beyond his own breathing.
Dean crossed his arms over his chest, annoyed and just like the other day, randomly upset by Sam's tone. Another weird thing that had been going on recently. If Sam took a certain tone with him or said anything remotely teasing or goading, Dean was ready to burst into tears.
Castiel was not why he started thinking of the baby as angel cake.
The waiting room was silent, another person was sitting in the waiting area, lost to the screen in their hand. Thinking to his own phone, he had the briefest desire to call his mother. Surely she would want to be here for this, to see how Dean was doing.
Sam has the light on by now, halfway over the front seat when he sees the look of pure and unadulterated
Sam entered the living room not long after he spoke, obviously taken back by Castiel's voice instead of his brother's. The scene he walked into was not one he expected. Dean was cuddling into Castiel's chest, his legs were curled up close, protecting his stomach even in his sleep. Sam couldn't help but smile.
Castiel reaches out once more and strokes a hand against the side of Dean's face.
Like Dean could stop it. Whatever the little angel cake wanted, they were gonna get.
She hates him.
He's too busy glaring out the window to notice Sam's eyes boring into the side of his head. Dean doesn't even want to look at his watch. He probably didn't even make it two hours.
Dean turns on him then, his eyes searching Sammy's face. He knows Sam like the back of his hand. And right now, he's trying to hide something.
Sam told him, days after crisis had been averted, that Cas left on some important mission with the other angels. Admittedly, Dean hadn't questioned it at the time, probably because he was busy with his previously dead, but now very much alive, mother.
"Uh, I'm sorry-what?"
*      *      *
"Uh, can I get a few days to think about all of this? It's...it's a lot."
"You told him how airports work right? He knows that we're here, and can read the friggen signs?"
The sheriff was quiet on the other end of the line. She was half tempted to pack the girls up and head straight to the bunker.
When the doctor gently pushed the transducer against his lower abdomen, he slid it across Dean's stomach. He was searching for something, that much was obvious, but what for, Dean had no idea.
"Dean didn't want a baby shower, but the girls talked him into it. He didn't want the nightgowns, but Jody convinced him. He didn't want to do yoga in the morning, but I told him it was good for him. He wasn't sleeping well until you came home, but then you left to go find Chuck. He didn't want that, but you did it anyway." Sam sighs.
A blood pressure test and a blood sample later and the doctor was patting him on the shoulder.
Making toward the kitchen now, Dean is a man on a mission. If he couldn't get drunk right now, he was going to do the next best thing.
She's heard him up chuck a thousand times, but seeing what he eats, Claire's not surprised. Yesterday he ate a peanut butter and egg sandwich.
If she hadn't made him cry earlier, she'd be annoyed. And if he wasn't pregnant, she probably would have punched him for crying.
Knowing he probably sent Dean scurrying off to his room, Sam rolled his eyes and tried to finish his session without the cranky commentary.
But also, it was a little bit great.
He should just do it. Just leave. Right now.
"Well...it's- I'm not even sure if this is correct, but I just want to take another sample from you to test and then if it comes back with similar results, I'd like to ask you some questions."
Dean wakes up in a flurry and everyone is surrounding him. Sam, of course, freaks out.
When Sam emerges, holding out the amulet to him, Castiel can't help but fold it gently into his palm. Looking up, he nods his appreciation to the man, and in the next blink of Sam's eyes, the angel is gone.
"Thanks Sammy." He says, or attempts to say, managing through a mouthful, "Thanks shamme."
He can still feel the blood on his stomach. He knows its there. The air feels as constricted here as it did in his dream. The pregnancy pillow is in the way and Dean shoves it off of his body with little preamble.
, kind of, but he was still trying to figure out Amara's reasoning. Sure, she brought mom back, THAT was what he needed most, not...not a
"Of the many tests I've conducted, they all came up with the same conclusion."
Stupid.
"I will
His shoulders dropped and he couldn't help but shake his head. It was weird thinking that his big brother, his monster killing, beer drinking, womanizing brother would ever be
There was a box of gloves, meant for the doctor, by the sink. Dean contemplated stealing a few before he decided against it. Again, the paper crinkled.
With a firm nod, he let himself out of the room, standing with his back pressed against the door as soon as it shut.
Dean slowed his breathing, calm enough to know that a 'but' was waiting around the corner. Sam didn't disappoint.
about the baby. Their mom included.
"So, bun in the oven?" He asks, already reaching out to gently touch Dean's stomach.
"You're pregnant."
That space looks like a canyon between them. There is an emptiness on his memory foam mattress that is calling out to Dean, begging him to return. It's an odd thought to think. He's a grown ass man, he shouldn't want to spend the day curled up like a little kid between his two favorite people.
Thankfully, they managed to find
And Jody.
Pushing the cart away from the food in anger, he's barely looking where he's going. He does know that he's probably going to have an aversion to fruit after this whole ordeal is over.
"Okay, but I'm coming with you."
His head fucking hurts and his body is sore.
So much fire.
Cas has been quiet in the back seat since Sam's revelation and the younger Winchester is slightly worried that he broke the newly transformed angel.
The two simply stare at one another while blood continues to
"Dean-
" He said and Jody tried to believe him.
It's thirty minutes into the drive that he realizes his mini-coma of a nap wasn't enough and he's
"Son?"
Dean whipped around in his seat so fast he worried he gave himself whiplash. There, standing in all his holy tax accountant glory, was Castiel.
There's a distinct silence as they continue riding, not even the paramedic is speaking, he's just working silently around them when Dean cracks his first smile.
He was ready to start loosing his mind and yell out everything in the book to his brother. That changed when he got close enough to see what the hell Dean had been doing for the greater part of four hours.
he couldn't drink and sat back down with a bag of pretzels instead.
Sam is packing his bag, there isn't much left to pack because they never take out more than they need each day. It's a force of habit, living from their duffle bags.
Cas tilts his head in that confused puppy-dog way of his and Dean has to fight the urge to kiss him.
Sure, he still ralphed his guts out sometimes, but they had managed to keep him away from the big triggers.
Not that it mattered. It was Dean's body. That guy and his degree could go fuck himself.
Like he said, physical sensations and shit. He was becoming tactile and damn if that didn't look clingy.
"Is it all right if I keep my hand just below the nape of his neck?" Castiel asks, and the paramedic nods, working to press against the sluggishly bleeding wound. It's slowing down and that's good. It'd stop by the time they reached the hospital, then they'd be able to assess the wound and see if it needed stitches or if he needed any scans done.
Dean cuts his manager off before he can get any further. “I’ve made my decision, Crowley, I won’t let you change my mind. Just get it done.” He hangs up the phone before Crowley can protest much more, and the accented squawking is cut off mid-rant. He’s got more important things to think about—like chord progressions, and performing a completely new song, and whether Cas is going to actually use the ticket and VIP pass that Dean had requested be delivered to his apartment this morning.
“Come in!”
It’s nice to have someone he can talk to, share stories and experiences with, and Castiel treasures Dean’s presence more than he treasures anything else in the world. After just a few months of Dean’s visits, Castiel realizes that for the first time in a long time, he has a friend. It’s a wonderful feeling, and one that he never wants to lose.
, they’re making eye contact now, and Dean is still staring. He tries his best to pick his jaw up off the top of the bar and instead gives him what he hopes is a charming smile—though his brain is still fucking scrambled, so he has no idea if he’s actually managed it.
Dean teaches himself to read Enochian.
) like Castiel's name. The sight of such a fantastically hot and well-renowned chef—someone famous for having such a refined palate that he's able to identify flavours no one else can—swallowing Dean's come like it's one of the best things he's ever tasted... That's a memory he won't quickly forget, that's for sure.
Dean raises his eyebrows, gaze dropping to the bundle in Castiel’s arms and then returning to his face. “Something you made? For me?” Slowly, a small smile curls his lips, as though he can’t quite believe that Cas would
(See the end of the chapter for

is what it can be like. He understands now.
“There we go,” he whispers when they break apart. “
The first time they do movie night, Castiel is in the armchair, while Dean takes up the couch.
The basement, once he makes it back to his desk, is cool and quiet and helps to calm Castiel. He still feels unsettled by what Adler had said to him, but at least he’s alone down here and he doesn’t have to feel the weight of anyone’s eyes on him. This is his space, and
how he wanted to go—smashed into tiny pieces against the side of the most remote prison in the galaxy, just because his ship refused to obey him.
As he reaches for his book where he’d set it aside previously, Dean catches his hand to stop him. The bickering flirting is good, but he’s aching for the real deal with Cas, and now he laces their fingers together and leans in for a kiss. Castiel makes a sound against Dean’s lips, partly of surprise and partly of amusement, and melts into the kiss.
Finally, the rope comes loose, and as the pressure around Dean’s chest disappears, all the force that had been keeping him upright against the pole goes as well, and he pitches face-first into the sea. When he reappears, he’s spluttering, churning the water with his hands to keep himself upright.

Dean swallows, throat suddenly dry, his hands tugging at the last of Cas’s garments without conscious thought.
feel okay. Dean smiles, then presses a quick kiss to the skin of Cas’s shoulder, so fleeting that Castiel might have almost thought he imagined it, if not for the smile still playing across Dean’s lips as he steps past Castiel and under the spray of the shower.
Almost everyone Dean knows found their familiar at a matching ball. The heightened atmosphere, the magic in the air, it draws compatible people together. And a bond can work all kinds of ways, he knows that. It doesn’t always have to be romantic—so many are platonic, or even just bonds of business.
He leans his hip against the edge of his counter and drinks his coffee, letting the heat of the mug warm his hands. It’s cold out, which makes life a little more difficult for the plants out the back (who are, thankfully, more hardy), but inside his shop he keeps the temperature nice and steady, and it always makes it a nice place to be during the winter. Most of his plants are more than a little temperamental, after all—they’ll find any excuse to be unhappy.
<< Hey, how are you feeling?
“Castiel Novak,” she spits, her tone ice-cold and her eyes coal-black. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”
“Hurry up and fuck me,
“Okay,” he says instead, with a hesitant nod. “Just a little bit, though. I don’t know how it’ll affect my, um…
“Cas, sweetheart, please, I—you’re scaring me, please just tell me.” One of Dean’s hands curves around Castiel’s, gently detaching it from his shirt. Cas feels his fingertips brush over the skin of Dean’s forearm, until his fingers are being closed around Dean’s wrist, and the leather bracelet that sits there.
They don’t keep track of how much time has passed, both because of the logistical difficulties of such an act, but also because all the days just seem to meld together. Before, they had dragged, stopped and started and felt eternally endless with the sheer weight of Castiel’s loneliness, but now…
“No,” Castiel agrees. “I didn’t.”

The shadows roll back slightly, the room brightening just enough for Dean to see the space in front of him, and a man steps out of the darkness.
There’s a teasing note to his voice now, and
. I do believe we have a welcoming committee.”
When they had put their applications in at Sioux Falls High School, Dean and Castiel hadn’t really expected that either one of them would get a position, let alone
“You from around here?” the boy asks, glancing up as the rollercoaster passes overhead. It’s not in a distracted way, though—it’s observant, as though the boy sees the things that regular people wouldn’t, just because he knows how to watch.
This time, the smile he gets is amused and much more genuine. “Is she the lady with the stick up her ass who’s always yelling at people in the corridors?”
And just like that, Castiel’s tiny smile disappears. “I’m having my second tattoo appointment tomorrow,” he says quietly, slumping down onto the couch beside Inias. “My mind won’t… stop
Show some love to the original
… when you told the guy with the gun not to shoot you, he was going to listen, right?”
Inias sets the spatula down beside the stove and mimics Castiel by slouching against the counter and folding his arms loosely. “You’re all zen and shit,” he accuses, waving his finger in Castiel’s direction with a grin. “You didn’t grump at me when I stacked the dishes up to be washed later, the goofy smile hasn’t left your face all night—hell, I know you’ve got a bunch of work stuff on your plate right now, but you still agreed to come over for dinner, which you
Not for good, of course. He still provides advice to the younger, up-and-coming hunters. Still designs gadgets, weapons, anything that can help keep the kids from facing the same fate he’d faced with a little less luck on their side. He’s still a hunter at heart, but he’s old now, and his knees don’t cooperate like they used to, and so he basks in the glory days and contents himself with what he has now.
This is a threshold that cannot be uncrossed, and Castiel wouldn’t have it any other way.
Dean settles back onto his chair, and Castiel can’t stop staring at his arm. The upper part of his arm is covered in colourful ink that peeks out from beneath the sleeve of his t-shirt, but his forearm is bare apart from that mark, and so of course Dean, when he turns back to Castiel and pulls on a new pair of gloves, notices him looking.
Dean's eyebrows furrowed together as he sat himself upright, folding his arms across his chest.
"We can't eat blueberries, end of story. I don't care about strawberries, boysenberries, blackberries or raspberries. But I ain't eating the thing that the doctor compared my kid too."
Dean nodded, urging him to continue.
Doctor Mercury had been noting down his symptoms while he was talking, but Dean wasn't paying attention until now. The doctor looked up, waiting to see if Dean would continue or not, and when the hunter remained silent, the doctor picked up the lull almost immediately.
With a light laugh, he continues.
Castiel looked sympathetic, it was endearing and so unlike Sam's stupid empathy face.
Or at least, when they were on the road last week.
He hovers, but not in the same way that Sam does. Sam treats Dean like he's made out of glass and literally anything has the ability to hurt him.
When Dean finally pulled himself away from the desk, he sat down heavily in the seat across from Sam. He was scribbling notes down onto the clipboard the nurse had handed him. Stretching out, Sam lightly kicked Dean's foot to grab his attention.
He's been on his own before.
Except for Sam. Man he was brave for putting up a fight against pregnant Dean. The glare Sam had received after that had been so deadly that Claire was even scared.
Cas follows behind quickly, making sure never to lose sight of Dean even when he's handed a clipboard and asked a number of questions by one of the emergency room nurses.
His hand would find its ways to his stomach and he'd look down and wonder.
Support. It was support.
But, like his big brother, Dean could read him pretty well, so Sam plastered on an encouraging smile.
"Dean?"
And as fucked up or unnatural as it felt sometimes, he couldn't help how
Sam presses his lips together in a firm line. There's little traffic on this road and he's already looking for somewhere to stop. As he finds a safe spot along the shoulder of the road, Sam turns them toward it, steadily slowing them down.
He was heading to the garage, fully intent on driving up and down the streets of Lebanon until he found his brother. Before he could get so far as climbing into one of the many other cars in the garage, he saw the impala.
Untangling himself from his pillow like a squid caught in a net, he sits himself upright. His shirt has ridden up during the night and his little fruit cake is poking at the waistband of his sweats.
He didn't even think about telling Bobby. Gah, add him to the list of people he has yet to tell.
They were on hiatus from hunting, they hadn't said much about it, but Dean figured with his current state, everyone was just going to be there and...support him? He isn't really sure what he expected, let alone what he wanted, but was it too much to ask for?
"Let's get him inside." Sam says, and Castiel agrees.
And even if he did keep the kid, he wouldn't exactly be starting a family. It was just him.
That is, until he was thrown off stage.
Yesterday it had been while he was making his bed, today it had been while he was watching t.v. He just couldn't help but stop and think.
Thankfully, Jody knew about that and came fully prepared to send Sammy on a number of tasks "for the baby". As they waited in line at the check-out, Jody turned to Sam.
how would the baby, uh, get out?"
But Cas? Cas is just...
But, nonetheless, her motherly instincts were ingrained inside of her, and she knew just how to handle overwhelmed people. With a gentle tone, she spoke, breaking through the broken musings of the eldest Winchester.
Jody's house comes into view and the lights turn on right as Baby pulls into the driveway behind the cruiser. Sam shifts gears and is pulling the key out of the ignition by the time Jody makes her way out to the front porch.
He promptly passes out.
He would make a wonderful parent. Castiel wouldn't even know where to begin taking care of a child. Sure, he's watched humans do it for centuries, he understands the basic mechanics, but to try a hand at it himself?
This was so much bigger.
Dean was standing, waiting with his hands fisted.
Now Jody...It wouldn't hurt to call her. He just had a few questions. And she wasn't going to freak out like his mom was. That was a situation he had no desire of seeing through. Mary was being so distant ever since she left the bunker.
His lip trembles and Mary's eyes soften.
Turning, she holds out the preferred dress to Dean like it's just a pair of pants or something normal for him to wear.
"I came here because you left an interesting message unanswered during our call and I was concerned. Which, seeing your physical state right now, I can see I was right to worry."
"Cas-he knows. He called me when I was looking at the baby clothes, thought he was you, and I just blurt out stuff about the baby. I didn't even think about it."
His panic had gotten to the point that Sam had scrambled for one of their brown convenience store bags and made Dean breathe into it.
The last time he had done that, he had a special tool to do so. One that he believed Sam was still in possession of.
"You don't have a concussion, you may have some tenderness from the fall, I can prescribe you some Tylenol if need be. Thankfully there was nothing behind you when you fainted-
Dean's bruise was one that they usually walked away with on hunts. Something that needed to be iced but not taken seriously. It didn't mean life or death, at least...not for them.
"You know what, I think I saw a few other pairs that might work, I'll go right back out and check with the floor manager."
His pregnancy.
"Why?" Sam asks before he can stop himself. Hurriedly he adds, "I mean-I'm not saying no, it's just...why now?"
Cas' hand caught his chin, making Dean look up from the ground. They were closer together than they had been before and still, Dean wanted to be closer.
Again.
I hit 'post' when I meant to hit 'save as draft', so y'all got a dab of story and not the full bite.
He was just so...
Ten minutes later and Castiel's plane is still working on de-boarding. Sam's pissed off at himself for not grabbing an extra pickle. There were two by the cash register when he had stopped to get gas before they drove to the airport. He thought one would be enough, a failsafe, but Dean's finished with it, and the juice (which, that was disgusting to watch and Claire had to take a walk after that).
Sam smiled again, absently thumbing away the weird sticky film from his wallet.
He makes a noise like a wounded animal when she uncurls his fingers, revealing the keys to the Impala in his hand.
His bladder twinges and Dean suddenly remembers why he created that canyon in the first place.
Once he's up, he stands at his bedroom door, wondering for a second how they brought him inside. He's staring at the space between Sam and Castiel with longing.
He wasn't just his brother, he was his
"I think she wanted to give me a family."
The doors closed as soon as Castiel was sitting and it didn't take long after for the vehicle to start moving.
Jody had already offered him her bed instead of the guest room, going on and on about body aches (which he has, but still). She took over control of his diet, even insisted he sit down when it was time to clean up around the house. If he even
Dean was ready to shake his head again, put out by all of these damn questions, but then he thought about his mother and their recent battle with God and Amara, and then the battle changing into a peace treaty. Honestly, that was a whole whirlwind of emotions and constant stress. It makes his stomach turn just thinking about it.
As he takes in another lungful of air, just as jagged as the rest, he opens his eyes. The look on her face is so open and understanding that Dean almost wants to look away. It isn't fair. He should hate her, he shouldn't want to curl up in her arms.
Dean's face was flushed. Sam had already seen the bruise and it extended from Dean's hip to the start of his ribs. The doctor was probably going to ask him to undress and Dean probably wanted some privacy to do so.
Cas moves before she can ask him anymore questions, clipboard in hand, he moves aside the curtain that's around Dean and the emergency room doctor. The doctor is moving around Dean in a fashion that reveals how practiced she is and Castiel makes sure to stay out of her way as she circles around Dean once more.
Sam was right, everything was fine and they were okay. Cas probably thought he was talking about his car.
Seeing as it was a maternity store, the only underwear they had was for pregnant women. Nonetheless, Jody was undeterred. She grabbed a couple of packages, reaching into the back and pulling out a single pair. Before Dean could ask what she was doing, Jody was pushing him, gently turning him around as she measured the underwear against the back of his jeans.
Dean held the picture in his hands, half listening to the doctor and half memorizing the image before him.
Dean plus Cas equals three, plus Sam's gigantor ass equals family.
"I- can't d-do it." He says and Mary kisses his head, pulling him in closer.
Something cracks within Dean's demeanor. Like there was a demon inside of him and he's just figured out how to expel it, all on his own.
"Dean it's okay if you want to-
He knew it. He fucking knew it.
He left Dean three days ago to follow up on a possible sighting of Lucifer in D.C. but it had been a bust. Crowley had cracked some unpleasant jokes about Dean's absence, but thankfully he doesn't know why Dean is stepping down from hunting.
Dean was nodding along to Sam's words, caught like a fish to a hook, and was able to slow his breathing to match Sam's. With one last heave of air, he shook his brother's giagantor hands off of him, rubbing a dismissive hand down his face.
It being, of course, the growing thing hitching a ride in his gut.
He wasn't showing by any means. He was barely pushing the two month marker. But he did look like he had a buildup of gas. It was small, but Dean knew his body, and he wasn't always this...bloated.
It's so sudden that Dean stops pulling at his hair. He opens his eyes and finds Cas' staring right into his.
Sam told him to come in here for one thing and one thing only.
Fuck it felt so nice.
The store could wait a little longer.
"Don't worry about it kiddo. We're still going to be here, that's not going to change. So if Fruitcake has a monster under their bed, I fully expect you to come check it out. Okay?"
He stops. Rubbing a hand down his face like it'll fix all of his stress wrinkles. It doesn't, obviously, but to claire he's old and they'll only get worse.
He feels childish closing his eyes, but he can't help it. He doesn't want to see that look in her eye. He doesn't want to know how ashamed of him she is.
The gel wasn't as cold as Dean was expecting but he couldn't be sure, he wasn't really paying any attention to himself now. Sam was right at his side, hand hovering over his brother's. He knew that Dean would probably call him a bitch or start compairing them to an expectant couple, but Sam wanted his brother to know that he was there.
"I just...he asked man, and I didn't know
The angel had been sitting at the table, absently reading, when he felt Dean's rising need. He moved without thought, careful to tread around Dean's dazed and dreaming figure. He was behind him then, a hand reaching out subconsciously for Dean's side.
"We need to get some food in you, oh my god, there is so much that we'll have to do. I'll call into the station and we can spend today going over your list." She's already up and heading to the kitchen when she stops. Peeking her head around the corner, she asks, "you do have a list right? Things you need to still get for the baby and yourself for after?"
The music is on, gently reminding Sam to keep his eyes open. He's just down the street from the girls when Dean wakes up.
Dean squirmed uncomfortably under Castiel's questioning stare, also his use of "impregnation," that was just weird. Before Dean could explain that, Castiel continued.
They had already got what they needed in the pants department, but they weren't done with his lower half just yet.
And that was it. He was definitely crying now, snot threatening to trickle into his mouth and the hand not holding his phone was covering his eyes. Good god. He was such a fricken mess.
Jody was pushing the cart, half expecting Dean to lose interest and wander off,
The voices are bickering once more, only louder, and he hears the distinct sound of a camera going off before two sets of feet go running out of the living room.
"Did she...did she say
"If by somewhere, you mean a bed so I can take a nap, then yes. We're getting there."
Dean was currently laying face down in his bed, trying (key word here) to sleep. His body was aching from the activity it hadn't been doing. The doctor had yet to have called him back with any results, something Sam repeatedly kept telling him would take time.
Dean shook his head in disagreement. He knew what they meant. He'd seen enough movies to know what most pregnant women complained about. Though, if what he's experiencing is what they go through, they have a right to complain.
The expression cracks and Dean blinks.
But he was right. If Dean didn't want this thing growing inside of him, he just needed to make another appointment...and it would be done.
"Yeah, I am."
If the words he practically puked out didn't make sense to Sam, he didn't show it. He was staring intently at Dean's face, like he could slow the words down with his mind if he stared long enough.
He drapes it over his arm and seats himself on a moss covered rock.
The paramedic is taking notes, leaning over Dean now to hook him up to one of the many monitors. It's reading his blood pressure, which is steadily rising the longer he sits there beneath Castiel's heavy stare.
"I am aware of how impregnation works Dean, what I don't understand is how you became impregnated."
He feels the heavy brick wall that is his brother's back shift against him. This isn't the first time they've shared a bed, but it's been well over twenty years since they last did. Sammy has always been that reassuring presence behind him. They lean on each other, back to back, even in their sleep, and Dean feels himself smile despite the pain.
Jody let herself into the changing room and started hanging an armful of items on the hooks behind the door.
Sam helped himself to one of the waiting room chairs and plopped down onto it. Breathing a heavy sigh of relief, he leaned back.
*      *      *
But the pickle is snatched out of his hands and his brother is sitting down with a huff in the next beat of his heart.
He was enough.
"He told you?" Sam whispered. Cas didn't look away from Dean when he nodded his head.
He was going to kill him. And no magic would ever bring him back.
Dean frowned into his pillow. He wanted to tune his brother out but if he did, it was likely that Jody would come and find him herself and he wasn't willing to tango with that.
"Hey, we're okay, it's just me and you. We can do this, honestly, if this is something you don't want. Just say the word and I'll have this taken care of."
His essence made for a quick escape and his vessel dropped lifelessly to the ground.
Castiel moves in?
"She did, but she did this too." He paused, rubbing a hand down his stomach subconsciously. Castiel tracked the motion, his eyes following wordlessly. "She said...she said she wanted to give me what I needed."
Sam watches as his brother gathers his bearings, noticing the tremble in his brother's hand as he brushes his hair back. It's longer now, all the prenatal vitamins are making it grow like crazy. Sam knows that Dean is dying to get it cut, but he hasn't wanted to leave the bunker unless he was in dire need of something. The excursion getting the pillow had been the first time Sam had seen his brother willingly leave, and by himself for that matter, in days since Cas left.
She makes her way over to the bed and before Dean can say anything over his pregnancy pillow, Claire is clambering over it and him.
Ultimately, they both came to the same conclusion.
"What-how did this happen?" He asked, actively trying to keep his hands to himself.
Claire fidgeted behind him, picking at the frayed end of his flannel.
They both saw it, but they didn't want to hope too soon.
There isn't an ounce of recognition in his eyes, not when they are pointed at the angel. It's almost as if he were staring at a blank wall. It's frightening enough that Castiel sits back on his heels, once more hesitant to touch the other man.
And he hates her too.
Dean throws his hands up in the air, exasperated.
Munching quietly, Dean realized he had no clue what to say, so he did the next best thing. He opened his mouth and let out whatever the fuck jumbled mess was rattling around his brain.
"Just because you're eight feet taller than I am doesn't mean I'm compact. I ain't a little Barbie doll. Either I sit in the front or you take the bus home."
Dean doesn't need to look down to know what it is, but like before, he has never really had any control over his dreams anyway. So he looks down.
regret getting to be the one to raise you. Was it good? Hardly, I had shit to work with and I was a kid too. That's why this is so different. I mean-Sammy, you were practically my first kid, this one...this one is just...different."
Dean continues the wonderful journey that is the first trimester of pregnancy. He isn't a fan.
Dean doesn't expect Sam to answer, that's his only saving grace, but Dean's still venting, so Sam's still listening.
"Cas- hey buddy, what are you doing here?" Dean said, quickly closing all of the baby books he had spread out before him. Cas was walking down the rest of the stairs and Dean was scrambling to hide everything.
"Cas?" He says, voice weak and unsure.
Rolling her eyes, Jody gently squeezes his hand. It's enough to draw his attention back to her, and Dean watches as she concedes to the girls' question.
He scrubs his face with one hand while the other supports his weight on the table. He's already on his feet and pulling up his shirt just to show them because if he has to say it twice he'll scream.
He finishes with a sigh. His head is heavy, hanging until his hands come to brace its weight. His elbows dig into his knees and Castiel focuses solely on the horns of the amulet poking his leg where it rests in his pocket.
He should be though, dammit. He was a man and this was...this was...
The light in his room switched on and suddenly his nose was saturated with the stench of whatever putrid meal Sam had created. Honestly, if Dean had made the omelet himself, all the stupid rabbit food included, it probably would have been all right. Something that Dean could have eaten. But for some weird reason, Sam was just a terrible cook. The scent of the spinach, burnt by the hint of char Dean smelled, made everything that he had managed to stomach roll.
"Dean?" Castiel said, waiting for a response.
Dean doesn't answer, the cloud at the back of his head turns rainy when he looks over at Cas for too long. Or maybe it's the blood loss. Shit, how hard did he hit his head, it feels like he just got struck by a bat.
But Sam and his stupid questions always seemed to ruin everything.
He's wet.
He landed roughly, rolling to a stop, and Sam rushed to his side. They could only look up in fear as Lucifer dropped the handcuffs. Dean didn't move when Castiel dropped to his knees.
He sighs. It's been three, almost four weeks that Mary has been back and he wants to talk to her all the time. Like when he was a kid and he'd wait outside of the bathroom for her to finish. Kind of like what Sam had done for him today.
It isn't until he feels the Impala swerve and Sammy veer off the road that he figures it out.
"What the fuck was he doing in Thailand?"
Jody didn't even wait, simply passing the bags over to a slightly overwhelmed Sam. Gently grabbing Dean by his elbow, she started to lead him out of the store and into the main walkway for the mall.
So he eats the stupid healthy crap.
As was Ben.
"Dean?"
To be fair, Dean didn't real put up enough of an effort to hide it.
It's when he's coming his little brother's hair back, rubbing a heavy hand down his back like he used to do when he was just a baby, that Sam relaxes.
"Uhhh...IgottagoCasbye." He rushed out, ending the call quicker than he left L.A.
Dean was pregnant with
Reaching up, Dean covered Castiel's mouth before he could keep speaking.

(2:34 pm) : and a cookie
He hadn't bothered checking her room because she wasn't there. She hadn't been there for
The angel's eyes find them easily, while they don't exactly stand out in a crowd of South Dakotans, Sam is easily the tallest person around. He's like a rock in a river, the crowd just parts around him.
But a (in terms of gender identity) confused person just might. This was the new Dean Winchester. The mother, the cuddler, and the cry-er.
Sam shares a look with Castiel and the two nod. It's heart wrenching, the sounds Dean makes when they pull away. It's almost as if they were hacking off pieces of him by pulling away, but he's still whole when they part.
Right where he had felt the baby.
Taking his opening, the angel reaches out for Dean's hand and leans forward to press a kiss against his head.
(2:34 pm) : pick me up one of those salty pretzels
"Oh, okay, I can schedule something with-
At first, Castiel doesn't touch him. He doesn't know if Dean even wants to be touched right now.
It's freaking Sam the fuck out.
child, and he was okay with it. The smile on his face almost aches. Castiel doesn't think he's ever been this happy before. So he sits there, waiting patiently, for Dean to return.
His head hurt. The mother of all migraines was creeping up his skull, settling amongst his worried thoughts. It was as unnerving as it was annoying. Rubbing at the back of his head, Dr. Mercury stood now beside him.
It sounds weak to his ears when he whines, "two weeks".
Claire is out of her seat before Dean can fully lose his shit. Dean, for a second, thinks that she's stormed off, but she comes back with a pen and paper before he can even ask. The two share a look and Dean can't help but feel immensely proud of her.
"And I'm not about to blow chunks. Only reason I'm letting you take me anywhere is because I got the kid in my gut, and if you don't tell my brother to get his ass in this car, I'm gonna start pressing buttons." He says, motioning to the nearby monitors.
"Sammy, you know I don't like...resent you or some shit...right?"
He's just happy he found alternatives to sweatpants. Seriously, he was having hot flashes. He couldn't always wear sweats or jeans.
"Can you tell me what today's date is?"
Of course that's when both Claire and Alex come into the room. He's sluggish from sleep, so it isn't exactly subtle when he tugs his shirt down over his stomach.
He's never going to wear pants again.
He waits outside of Sam's room, standing in the doorway as the younger Winchester opens a box on top of his dresser. It appears to be a jewelry box, and it holds more than just Dean's amulet, but Castiel doesn't pry for the other pieces that the box holds.
In front of all four of them.
"You could be carrying someone's baby?"
Like a gentle breeze, it glided toward the stairs, poetically stopping at Castiel's feet.
he said,
It should probably be annoying, how often the angel is around, but it isn't. He stays close enough that if Dean needs him, he's right there. And with how emotional and tactile and downright clingy he's been, Dean isn't complaining.
Amara looked at him with a hint of amusement in her eyes. A smile crept onto her cheeks, and Castiel slumped further against the rock.
*      *      *
Sam has one arm stretched across the back of the bench seat and is looking down at his brother in anger. But it's more at himself than anything. How could he let it get to this point? He's seen Dean struggling these past few weeks. He's seen Dean fight demons with more restraint than he's fought their orders.
Cas looks over at the man, incredulous. Like the idea of getting to name his child was ever on the docket. The angel (doesn't matter if he doesn't have his grace anymore or not, he's still an angel to Dean) leans in to Dean reaching for both of his hands.
*      *      *
"Well, I uh, I guess I have news?" He cringed.
Of course.
He couldn't leave. He couldn't do it.
Yes, a baby. He knows what it's called, he just...can't call it that...yet. He's warmed up to the idea of keeping the little bastard, but with the random bouts of panic he gets when reminded that he's a pregnant man, he's becoming more wary.
The look Dean gives her when he turns around
The past two weeks had driven him nearly to the brink.
"Surprise transition present." He replied. It wasn't like he could tell the guy the truth. They had a cover, and this was it. But Dean was slowly getting used to it, oddly enough.
Dean had started fidgeting in his sleep a couple of minutes ago, but it wasn't anything Sam wasn't used to. Dean didn't sleep like a rock. He moved around his bed like he would in a fight.
"He said it was important, but what could be so important in Thailand? Why the hell had he even gone there? Is he still following Lucifer's trail because I thought Crowley and Rowena were handling that. Their fucking mess anyway. Had the chance to bag him in D.C. that's what you said, but they didn't take it. Why the hell not?"
Sam came around the corner then, having found them after his own little recon mission. Dean looked up as his little brother approached them, there was something akin to a smile on Sam's face and Dean wasn't entirely sure if that was a good thing or not. The little shit was downright devious when he wanted to be, so Dean wasn't surprised when Sam pulled something out from behind his back.
Jody had long since moved to sit down, and she was glad she did because she seriously thought she was dreaming for a second. Dean Winchester,
When Mary pulls back Dean fights to keep her close. He can't do it anymore. He can't pretend that he doesn't need her because he does. But his mother has always been stubborn and when she finally touches both sides of his face, he knows she's got him.
Wait, what?
God. There were so. Many. Clothes.
"Dean? What is it, c'mon man you gotta talk to me." Sam pleaded. He was hovering over his brother, following after him as Dean paced.
Really... anytime they get in the car they are stupid. There is no limit of time in which they aren't.
Dean let out a small laugh. If his slip up hadn't been enough, the sonogram and the morning (every minute, really) sickness would.
It's a foreign number, but Dean's not surprised. They leave their numbers with plenty of people, and this is probably someone in need of help. He'll just get their information and call Bobby to get another hunter on it.
So his eyes find them, and then they find Dean. And he's looking at Dean in such a reverent way that it makes his whole face change. It's obvious then, Dean thinks, it's Cas' baby.
He was losing his mind.
Probably because this is where they are most comfortable. This is home for them.
Taking the bag of pretzels out of Dean's hands, Sam made Dean lean over his knees. Coaching his breathing and gently rubbing his back.
They went over board. But he liked the shirts. He wasn't too proud to admit he almost cried when he had to put his jeans back on.
All around, he feels like he's just been run over.
To be contrite, women's sizes were stupid. What the hell was a zero? Literally no one could measure zero inches around their waist.
With a sniff, trying to hold back the tears that threaten to wash his face clean, Dean sits back.
"I-I'm sorry Dean," He starts, but Dean holds up a hand to stop him.
"Great, so now onto the bigger question. There are alternative methods to pregnancy if this is not something you wish to...pursue." The doctor said. He looked like he was trying to refrain from showing his opinion on the matter, but he was doing a poor job of it.
"It's my fault." Sam says when they drive past the sign for Lebanon.
So, he'll have to do this the human way.
His vessel was crashing, his skin was blackening, and he was rambling.
He crosses the kitchen to where Dean is standing and caps the whiskey bottle once more, ignoring the glare Dean gives him and the discontented sound he makes. “No more alcohol right now,” he says firmly. “We can have some later, if you still want, but right now I want to talk to you without the whiskey talking on your behalf, alright?”
And it still feels like Dean has no idea.
Sam just shrugs and pokes his last tile straight on the Scrabble board. “It should be, yes, but I stand by it.” There’s a smile at the edge of his lips.
Dean just laughs and follows, his eyes always on Castiel and that sweet, soft half-smile always playing about his lips.
muffled by whatever it’s holding in its beak.
“You chased after me,” Dean says quietly, and his gaze slides away from Cas’s.
of it, at least. Unfortunately for him, his printer stops printing at around the seventy-three page mark, leaving the climax of the story (so to say) uncompleted and unresolved. It’s frustrating, to say the least, and Dean is definitely feeling more than a little blue-balled.
Still, even though he likes figuring out what Dean likes and what drives him wild, he doesn’t want to torture him. Not this morning, when the sun is barely peeking through the window and they’re still sleep-drowsy, their voices rough and movements slow.
But still, the only reason he isn’t in handcuffs right now is because of the angel, so even though it slightly pains him, there’s something he needs to say.
When he’d first applied to become an astronaut, he’d thought that the most incredible thing about it would be the weightlessness, or the exploring, or the sheer adrenaline of having your body catapulted out of the atmosphere in a rocket. He’d done it for the adventure, and for the fact that the earth has always seemed too
Cas is standing by the stove, back turned to Dean as he looks through the kitchen window at their backyard, and the garden they planted there when they’d first moved in. The morning light haloes him in gold, and there’s something so serene and beautiful about him as he stands there, fingers wrapped around his mug.
What kind of person comes all the way out here with a plan like
“I should probably head in,” Cas murmurs, amused, and Dean seems to snap out of it, giving himself a little shake.
Show some love to the original
“Looks like we might be here a little while longer,” Dean murmurs as he looks back down at Cas, who’s still watching him with that unreadable look in his eyes. He raises his eyebrows, and the look disappears, Cas’s lips curving up into a smile instead.

have to worry about.
“Come on,” Castiel tells Dean, letting his hand fall. “Once we’re out of here, I’ll tell you what I found.”
He extends his hand out into the space between them. While they’re both somewhat translucent, the lady’s palm in his hand feels solid and real and warm, and Castiel fights the urge to hold onto the physical contact for longer than he should. He’s so starved for it.
“You did.” Dean settles on the edge of the bed, fingers fidgeting in his lap as though he doesn’t know what to do with himself. “Scared the shit out of me, honestly. I tied up Abby and the guard, then radioed one of my Men of Letters contacts to come get us. The doctor said you just needed to rest, but…” Dean drags his fingers through his hair, then gives Castiel a thin smile. “Well, it was tough. I was really worried. But I’m glad you’re okay now.”
“Morning, Castiel!” Alfie, one of the educators, waves at Castiel from where he’s taken up position in the corner of the staff room, various documents and brochures spread out around his laptop.
Dean straightens up at his post and raises his eyebrows. “Now, sir?” he asks of his boss—the gruff-looking Special Agent Singer who has been in charge of the Presidential detail for as long as anyone can remember. It’s not often that he directly singles out agents, so Dean can’t be sure if this is a good thing or not.

They’re just different people. Dean’s idea of fun is having friends over for games and movies and getting drunk together, whereas Cas is more the type to stay in with a book and have a quiet evening.

All their years of pining, of love they thought had been unrequited and a distance that had been too great to bridge... it's all culminated into this one kiss. Dean kisses Castiel like he's drowning, and Cas returns it twofold, his hands roaming over his body and raking through his hair. It's fucking hot and wonderful and
It’s short, but still lovely.

right.
Cas, when he’s sick, is always grumpy. Dean’s had to look after him enough times to know this, and so he’s more than prepared for the lump that ends up on their couch, half-buried under a pile of blankets and quietly bemoaning how cold he is.
This kiss is nothing like the kiss at the wedding. That one had been quick, chaste, awkward, but this? This doesn’t even compare.
weapon—and not with the clumsiness that usually accompanies an alpha accustomed to the weight and balance of a sword. No, from how close that blade had come to Dean’s ribs, this alpha definitely knows what he’s doing.
And then, right before he loses the thread of his focus—
That morning, Castiel makes up his mind.
“I was worried something had happened, I—why are you using a cane?”
There’s that feeling again, thumping under Cas’s ribcage with the rhythm of his heart.
They’re lying in the grass at the top of the hill, side by side, gazing up at the stars. Tonight is totally clear, without a single cloud to be seen in the sky, and up above them, thousands of stars glitter in the dark.
It gets to the point where even his coworkers begin to notice a change in him, however small. He’s a little more laid back, looser. He doesn’t need to keep his desk quite so organized. He stops to talk to people occasionally, instead of keeping to himself.

Castiel Novak is
And just like that, the energy between them changes completely.
After a few minutes of walking, they find themselves outside a restaurant—rustic-looking but classy, with the name ‘Petit Chéri’ emblazoned across the awning. Dean holds the door open for Castiel, who murmurs a quiet ‘thank you’ as he steps inside.
Cas’s heart flip-flops in his chest at Dean’s sated, happy smile. Slowly, he reaches for Dean with his free hand, tangles their fingers together, and leads them down the hallway to his bedroom.

Dean. How his mind works. Where his thoughts go.
For now, he just whispers, “You’re amazing,” against Dean’s lips, and presses his forehead against Dean’s as though he can’t bear to have even a sliver of distance between them.
“I’m afraid our time here is up, Dean. I have much else that I must attend to. Business to get in order, things to get into place. It has been a pleasure meeting you, and I am sure we will meet again one day.”
He doesn’t quite remember how he got here. It’s all a little fuzzy, and he frowns as he tries to remember what he was doing before now—ten minutes, five minutes, even thirty seconds ago. His thoughts slip just out of his grasp, always dancing out of reach.
Castiel’s mouth flattens into a thin line for a moment. “That’s not important,” he mutters, then shrugs one shoulder. “Besides, we didn’t have sex. It wasn’t like that.”
Castiel frowns. “But… djinn dreams are supposed to show you your greatest wish, right? Why was it just black?”
Dean starts to formulate his plan. It's petty, and childish, and it's definitely not the best use of time, but it's sure as hell going to make him feel better after the way that Novak's comments have put him off ever since that interaction.
He braces himself against the control panel and closes his eyes—
There’s no way they can go to the hospital—even though Castiel is a detective, he might not have any sway with the officers who come to ask why Dean has a bullet wound in his shoulder. Besides, it seems to have been clean, through and through. He’s got enough medical response training to be able to deal with that.
He really wants to kiss Dean right now, but he will have to settle for just knowing that he’s alive and in one piece.

Which is why Castiel has volunteered to train a handful of new hunters, teaching them how to deal with a Wendigo that the Men of Letters have only recently been able to locate in the wilderness of Minnesota.
Dean grows up hearing it, that same melody over and over again, and he grows up searching the forest. He knows almost every inch of it by now, every tree and burrow and hill. He knows the meadow—has walked that meadow more times than he can count, looking for answers to questions he doesn’t even know how to ask yet.

Of all the ways that Dean had pictured ever coming back here… it had never been like this.

Castiel switches the lamp on, then opens up his laptop and rests his fingers on the keyboard.
“My whole apartment is spotless and I’ve spent the last few hours cooking to try and distract myself so I don’t think about tonight.” He rubs the back of his neck, his lips twisting wryly. “Not that I’m not looking forward to it, I just… don’t know what to expect. I didn’t want to drive myself crazy thinking about it.”

He spends the first part of it on his laptop while he sits at his bench, figuring out ingredients and ideas for the next few recipes he's planning to create. While he researches, though, he can't help but keep an ear out for everything else that's happening in the kitchen. Charlie and Castiel seem to be having a great time collaborating on her Cheez-It project, and Dean hides his scowl against his hand.
He can’t see Dean’s disappointment, but it’s a palpable thing. Still, to his credit, he sounds reasonably upbeat when he says, “Awesome! I’ll wrap it up for you, give you some care instructions, and then we’ll make another appointment to finish it off next week.”
In front of him stands a man, dressed in pajamas and an open bathrobe, hair sticking up and green eyes rimmed with red. The man’s eyes widen when he sees Castiel, his mouth falling open.
him. He’s such a beautiful man, and on a night like this, where the moon and the dim cemetery lights make his eyes glow?
He finds himself returning to the general store more and more often.
The guy is maybe a few years older than him, dressed in a pair of neatly-pressed slacks and a charcoal vest that hugs his body
Castiel holds his breath, and as the firework explodes up above—
They get word of other chasers setting up around the edge of the storm—not that they're close to anyone else, not that they can see. There are still cars on the road, likely rushing to get indoors now that the sky is turning dark and menacing, but few are parked and waiting like they are.
Dean’s last thought, as he’s dragged down to Hell, is—
The mug is plain white, decorated by cartoon bees and the words ‘Bee Happy.’ Dean had picked it up at a garage sale, and it’s the perfect gift for Cas.
Dean meets with Cas, but is not prepared for who he has become in his absence.
All in all, it’s a quiet evening—which, honestly, Castiel is fine with after all the excitement of their fight with Abby. Getting to talk to and spend time with Dean
Well, this chapter turned out to be quite a beast, but. These two idiots had a lot to say to each other. Thanks to
he pleads silently.
“Dean,” Castiel says quietly, his chest tight with the strength of his emotions, “did you… did you make that?”
“Castiel?”
The dandelion flowers have been coloured in, beautiful hues of yellow and green standing out against the rest of the greyscale tattoo. They’re vibrant and stunning and Castiel feels himself tearing up as he looks at them, because it might just be a little bit of added colour, but it symbolises so much more.
It’s not at all what Castiel had expected him to say, and the new information sends him reeling.
Escaping to the roof it is.
Castiel feels as though he’s been punched in the gut.
he is because of the mark on his skin. It’s fucking terrifying, and he can feel himself tense again, his fight-or-flight mode activated.
The man looks down at his hand, then back at up at Dean. His eyes soften, and he smiles, taking a half-step forwards so that Dean’s fingertips bump into his chest.
But he still needs the blessing of the other.
“I’m sorry, Dean.” Sorry that he’d freaked out, sorry that his rejection is clearly having some kind of effect on Dean, sorry that they can’t continue this evening because of his stupid brain and biology.
The test kitchen is a closely-knit family. They have to be, working in such close quarters and often collaborating on things together. You get to know people's strengths, their weaknesses, what makes them tick and what ticks them off. And mostly, the chefs and editors use that power for good. Support each other, lift each other up, filling in each other's gaps with their own skills.
Dean snorts. “Yeah, that’d be the one. You think he’ll back off now?”
“Fine,” Dean mutters, but for all his grumpy posturing, there’s a shine in his eyes that’s impossible to hide, and that warms Castiel’s heart. God, he loves Dean so much. It feels so good to be able to properly say that now.
He keeps thinking about today—about the parade, about the parade, about his conversation with Dean, about his own identity. He knows that he’s capable of love, because he loves Sam like family, and he loves Dean like—
And with that, he climbs out of the Impala, slams the door behind him, and stalks over to the other car.
He’s not sure if Benny’s words have helped, or just made his decision more terrifying, but either way, it’s information he needed to know. Needed to hear.
In the end, he goes with:
That can’t be it—he doesn’t have enough clues as to where she is, or what she’s done with Dean. He keeps talking, keeps goading, trying desperately to get her to respond just one more time, but all he gets is static.
“I didn’t expect to end up here with you,” he finishes lamely.
He reaches out to rest his hand over Dean’s briefly, covering it where it lies on the mattress between them. “It’s okay,” he says, making his voice reassuring to match the touch. “It’s nice. I can’t remember the last time someone noticed a tiny detail like that about me.”
Dean shakes his head. “’S fine, Cas. It’s a good distraction—and you’re right, I do a lot of stupid stuff. Gotta have someone around to keep me breathing, that’s for sure.”
Dean nods solemnly, so grown up for such a young child, while the woman looks back towards Castiel. “Thank you,” she says quietly. “Do you mind… do you mind if I stay a little bit longer? I don’t think I’m ready to say goodbye just yet.”
with Dean, then he wants to be educated. He wants to know as much about what might happen as he can, and that means picking up the books that he’d turned away from so many years ago.
They ride all day, stopping only to water the horses and eat the lunch that the castle kitchens had packed, and then they press on. Slowly, the land they pass gets less and less familiar as they get further from the Winchester castle.
, even if no one but him ever sees it.
He still has them sometimes, even though they seem fewer and further between these days. He doesn’t speak much, withdraws into his own head, and the bag under his eyes always seem more pronounced. On the days he
This time, Dean’s replies appear in a matter of seconds.
He can’t finish it, too overwhelmed by the reality of it if he speaks this man’s name out into the world, but it doesn’t matter. The man’s expression shifts almost imperceptibly, but it’s enough to show that he knows what Castiel is thinking, and that his guess is correct.
Dean smiles around his mouthful of food and gently nudges Cas’s foot under the table. “Of course, Cas. I wouldn’t do it any other way.” Then the look in his eye turns cheeky, curious, and he quirks his eyebrows at Castiel. “So. You still wanna know what I’m into?”
How long will it be until Dean just gives up on him? He’s barely more than a stranger, and a broken one, at that.
Dean flushes at the pet name and hurries to obey. He learned long ago that there’s not really a sexy way to get his jeans off while he’s on the bed, so instead he aims for speed, pulling the denim off his legs and tossing the jeans aside. Mere seconds later, he’s on his hands and knees on the bed—making sure that he’s side-on to the camera so that his viewers get the best shot. They are paying for this, after all.
Dean takes the bait.
Dean is thirty when he first kisses an angel.
His boyfriend is wearing nothing more than his boxers and his favourite blue bathrobe as he fixes two mugs of coffee. One of the mugs is the one he got Castiel for Christmas, decorated with a few cartoonish bees and their dotted flight paths, and it’s all so perfect and domestic and lovely that it hits Castiel all at once.
It feels like they exist in a kind of limbo. Dean visits, and Castiel looks forward to his visits like he looks forward to the sun rising every day, but he never says anything about it. How can he, after all? Dean still has so much of his life to live, and Castiel…
“I love you too, Dean. Now rest. I’ll be here.”
In the cool air of the studio, he feels way too exposed, the entirety of his arms and shoulders bared to Dean’s gaze. He knows he looks good—the yoga and running helps with that—but it’s not that aspect of his appearance that’s responsible for the anxious roiling of his stomach. His mark stands out even against his tanned skin, and he tries to resist the instinctive urge to put his hand over it, to cover it, to do whatever he can to prevent Dean from seeing the truth about what he is for the first time.
It’s not until Dean is in his forties that he properly has his ‘bisexual panic,’ as Sam so helpfully calls it.
. It’s something that he’d never thought he could ever have with someone who wasn’t unpresented, but here they are, and Castiel continues to surprise himself at every turn. Being with Dean is an adventure that he doesn’t think he’ll ever get tired of.
This is the artist he wants. He’s never been so sure of anything since he packed his bags at the age of eighteen and got on a flight to San Francisco.
Lights glow in strings above the wooden dancefloor, polished to a sheen but impossible to slip on. Fireflies drift amongst the guests, floating and flickering, and the band situated off to the side of the dancefloor is playing quiet, beautiful music. There are people everywhere—dancing, mingling in small groups, even some standing slightly away from the dancefloor, watching or talking to other people.
Castiel doesn’t mind Dean’s silence, because he knows that his words are sinking in. That Dean is considering the weight of them, and what kind of shape they will hold in his heart. And if Castiel has been able to do that, then that is all he ever asks.
“Alright, smartass. Just watch the movie, okay?”
And then the man says, “You didn’t let me finish telling the joke.”
The guy sets his foot on the pavement and kicks his stand down, then reaches for his helmet. Castiel isn’t sure exactly what he’s expecting—
But as it turns out, that isn’t the case at all.
Not that he
. Castiel curls his fingers into the fabric of his pillow, hard enough that his knuckles hurt, and then releases it with a shaking breath.
“Why not?” Castiel asks without thinking. The boy frowns, clearly trying to figure out which part of his statement Cas is questioning. It’s not hard to pinpoint the moment he does, because he seems to close off just a little, withdrawing into himself.
Castiel almost forgets that he has his sleeves rolled up and his mark on display until one of his coworkers quietly compliments his tattoo during a meeting. For the first time in his life, instead of the sharp fear that would usually accompany having his Dominant mark visible in public, all he feels is a rush of warm pride and happiness. “Thanks,” he whispers back, holding out his hand so that they can look at the tattoo together. “My boyfriend did it.”
The alpha inhales, trying to replace the air that was knocked out of him by Dean’s attack. “Thank you, I think,” he rasps, then clears his throat. This close, Dean takes a moment to appreciate his face in the moonlight—the blue eyes with the crinkles at the corners, the pink lips, the already-messy hair that’s been made even more wild by their fight.
at it.
“You really don’t know what today is?”
“Fuck, it’s past nine!”
“You sure this devil’s trap is gonna hold, Cas?”
he isn’t as straight as he thought.
Dean kneels in the middle of the floor; a mockery of worship with his ink-black eyes and the curve of a smirk that never truly disappears. He kneels, and he waits, bound by red paint on rough concrete and the whispered order of “
“Come on,” he teases gently, “let’s get back to the dinner. I think some celebrating and champagne is in order.”
He was certainly not there when Dean had knelt down, and it’s only a very good amount of self-control that keeps Dean from jumping a foot in the air at the sudden appearance of this strange man. “Who the fuck are you?” he demands.
Sam gives him a quick thumbs up, then keeps fiddling with the GoPro in his hands. "The car-mounted cameras are filming, I've got the GoPro for the basic stuff and then a proper camera ready for any artsy shots we might get a chance for." He turns on the GoPro and holds it up, giving it a little wave. "Alright," he says to the lens, "we've finally found one! Also, we managed to pick up a straggler—say hi to our viewers, Cas!"
"And am I?" There's a hint of amusement in Cas's voice. "Good people," he prompts, when Dean looks back over at him.
Castiel had been the one to do Dean’s absolute favourite tattoo—the vines that wind themselves elegantly from his forearm to his bicep, ending just below his shoulder. It’s clean and simple and fucking stunning, and that day had been the day that Dean had become addicted to having Cas’s hands on his skin. He’s been itching for another one ever since, and only
“Benny, this is Cas,” Dean says, and Benny’s eyes are still fixed on Castiel, sizing him up. Cas doesn’t let himself be cowed—just stares right back. “Cas, Benny.”
Everything about this situation has Dean’s senses heightened and on red alert, but… it’s Cas.
In that moment, the werewolf lunges, and suddenly Castiel is sighting down his revolver into a gaping maw full of razor-sharp teeth.
to take him out to dinner sometime, but… he’s got absolutely no idea
Castiel tells himself.
. They don't have to be fancy letters—just write whatever comes to mind."
Luckily, Dean gets it. He’s more than happy to just wrap his arms around Castiel and hold him while he processes everything—Dean isn’t leaving, Dean loves him back, and he won’t be
It means that he and Cas get to see their friends, to find out what everyone’s been up to and spend the evening drinking and yelling at each other whenever a game of ‘Sorry’ goes wrong.
familiar. “I’m distracting, am I?” he asks with a grin, coming to a stop in front of Dean’s cauldron and tilting his head.
to free the feeling in his chest; one of hummingbird wings and the wretched weight of inevitability.
“Move this way a little, Dean—“
Sam's expression, when they pull apart, is one of quiet anger and devastation. "It's not fair," he whispers, his voice choked up, and Dean nods.
? Holy shit, congratulations!”
The moon sits high above the trees, casting silvered shadows across the small clearing in the middle of the woods where Dean Winchester stands, alone. The grass is damp against his bare feet, and his skin prickles with the caress of the cold night air that is so full of potential.
, but at least it serves as some reprieve from the pain inside him—the ache of having his choice taken away from him, and having to give up his dream of ever being with the person he loves.
He will
. 16.
Dean shoots him a grateful smile and starts in on his breakfast. Castiel watches him for a few moments while he sips at his coffee—and then remembers that he’s still only in his boxers, and that he very much has to be at work soon and can’t just stand around ogling his hot boyfriend all day.
Dean had decided to kiss him, but the careful way he’d done it, soft and quiet like the dawn breaking over the horizon, has left a lasting imprint on Cas that he can’t shake.
that passes, Dean wants to meet him even more.
So the
As Dean makes his way back towards the cabin, he can’t help but notice that he feels a little…
But unlike thieves, the Men of Letters were said to revolve around the notion of
Thoughts of the letter he'd written the night before he'd left Winchester.
<< That’s quick! What did he say?
“Friday is great.”
“Shall we?” he breathes into the space between them, and Dean is already powerless to do anything but nod.

farm, and they slowly expand it, getting cows and an orchard, and eventually making their own cheeses and preserves.
There’s a feeling in his gut that tells him the handprint is connected.
"Yeah, I think I'm okay," Dean says, and saying it out loud makes it feel a little more certain. "You?"
Castiel watches him for a long few moments, eyes narrowed, trying to figure out what to say. Trying to figure out just how he feels about this whole insane situation. Because no matter what else this man has done, and how much Castiel dislikes his misuse of his powers…
Castiel takes this moment to watch Dean, to
Every step takes him further into the temple, through twisting corridors and past rooms of worship and offering. Those aren’t what Dean is looking for, though, not right now. The texts he’s read tell of the temple having a ‘heart,’ a place right in the core of the temple that served as the connection to the god. It is where, the texts say, the god’s presence could be felt most strongly, and where the most elite and the most religious came to pay tribute.
He does just fine on his own, has for a long time—since he was old enough to hold a shotgun and make a salt circle. He’s proud of what he’s been able to achieve without angelic help, and the longer he can keep hunting solo, the better.
They bounce off each other, Dean stumbling back a step into the group of students who’d been trying to come in the door after him and who give him mildly irritated looks.
And bruises, and closed doors.
The man shrugs, loose and laidback. The grin he gives Castiel is enough to floor him, just the right side of feral. “I live in the neighborhood,” he admits, “and I’ve seen you around. People say this place isn’t open for business, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try my luck.”
Show some love to the original
The door creaks open, and Dean jerks in his seat, then hurriedly finishes off his letter.
Dean likes. What they should explore.
Dean scowls—he’d forgotten about that. Trust Sam to pull it out as evidence. "Whatever, bitch. Just get the camera, would ya? I've got a good feeling about this one."
Anyway, it’s easy to change around his outfit when he has no true corporeal form. All it takes is a thought. Castiel has spent a large amount of time amusing himself by trying out new clothes, sampling from the wardrobes of people who walk through the cemetery gates, but in the end, this is what he decided to settle on.
of them alright. He’s heard the stories ever since he’d unwittingly started working for the same immoral people the Men of Letters are supposed to oppose, but he’d only ever considered them to be a myth. An urban legend. A story, to keep relic thieves on their toes and lackeys under the thumb of their bosses.
“Okay,” he says with a nod, giving Cas a little smile that he hopes will put his mind at ease. “Cas it is. And about last night…”
perched on the tip of his tongue, because he
While he’s sure that Adler would take personal affront if Anna turned him down like that, the man only nods knowingly and gives Castiel a wink that makes his insides turn. “Of course, you mustn’t let your excellent work ethic slip. To be continued another time, then, Castiel.”
Castiel can’t resist asking the question, as he checks on Dean’s shoulder while the outlaw cleans his gun—as though he’s making inventory, preparing to leave.
But that knowledge doesn’t make this entire situation hurt any less.
"It sure is. Now how about you jump back into your car, and you can follow us to the nearest town, and then from there we can figure out which romantic country diner you want to take me to. I'm sure we'll have lots of options," Dean jokes.
After a long hunt, Castiel’s favourite thing to do is to take a long, hot shower, and then fall into bed.
just how he feels is—
Until now.
The room inside is large and brightly lit, though Castiel can’t quite pinpoint the source of the light. For the most part, it’s empty, save for a single table with two chairs, placed in the very centre of the space.
They stay there for a minute or so, Dean relishing in the warmth of Cas’s chest behind him and the drag of possessive fingers over his skin. It’s so intoxicating, being on display for so many people to watch him, but it feels so much more heightened with Cas here. His boyfriend is totally in control, even though they decided on what would happen before they set up the stream, and now Dean just gets to obey and show off for the camera.
He’s spoken with Dean throughout the years, of course—every time he’d visited the cemetery, and then (to his surprise) quite a few times at his home as well. Whoever Dean had persuaded to let him and Cas leave the cemetery, he’s not sure, but it’s been so amazing knowing that Dean has been with him at times throughout his life, seeing his nieces and nephews grow up and his little brother grow old.
Dean is the first one to move. The first one to snap, the buzz under his skin becoming a roar that demands an outlet.
They’re too close too fast, and Castiel reels back a step, but his brain is already processing well before his eyes get a chance to take in the sight before him.
"I'll go into the bathing ensuite," Castiel suggests, making his way over and carefully picking up his outfit. This close, Dean can't help but watch the way his hair curls just slightly behind his ears, or the kind crinkle of his eyes when he looks over.
, so bright that it’s blinding.
But beneath the electric current of second-hand magic in the room, it feels like there’s… something else. Something
Castiel reaches for his laptop and powers it up.
But it seems that the universe has other ideas.
For all that he’s tapped out on research for the night, Dean still offers his thoughts when Cas asks him, hooking his chin over his boyfriend’s shoulder to peer down at whatever section of ‘Halos and Hellos’ he’s looking through. As the night wears on, he finds his eyelids drooping more and more, his head dropping down against Cas’s. By the time he’s nodded off a few times, Cas seems to decide that that’s enough, turning off the TV.
"Sir, yes, sir," he says quietly, letting his smile morph into a proper grin before he ducks his head and continues fiddling with the camera in his lap.
The coffin they’re carrying is so small.
Dean acquiesces, slowly and gracefully, and stands before Castiel still with his hands clasped behind his back and his gaze lowered. “Look at me,” Cas requests quietly, and immediately, Dean eyes rise to meet his.
he feels at the idea of finally being able to move on.
For a moment, they just look at each other, and then something in Dean’s expression shifts, a serious look in his eyes. “Hey, Cas?” He ventures, his voice quiet in amongst the sounds of the city. “What was that you said before—in your prayers. You… you care for me?”
Castiel starts, but he doesn’t get much further, because as soon at the words begin to leave his mouth, Dean’s expression crumples, and he takes a step back.
He steps forward into Dean’s space faster than either of them can blink, fingers curled into the front of Dean’s shirt. He shoves him back until the edge of the desk meets Dean’s hips, then presses closer, until there’s barely a hair’s breadth between them. This close, Castiel can count every one of his freckles, can see the speckled green of his irises, and can’t possibly miss the way his breath hitches.
