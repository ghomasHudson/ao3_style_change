”I thought so,” Dean says, and his eyes glow bright blue.
“Cas, that means... when I asked where you were, you were right there?”
Dean’s sitting on the edge of a dock, fishing pole in hand, when Jack appears beside him.
“Dean, I’m... worried. That’s all.” Her voice goes all soft and serious, and she sounds like her mother, which means trouble. “I remember what you were like when he left and —”
Dean takes a deep breath and lets it out. Then he ties one of Cas’s scratchy blue towels around his waist. (If they’re really getting together, Dean’s gonna make Cas go to Target and buy better ones. But this will do for now.) He’s not getting dressed. He can’t lose his nerve, and he knows he will if he puts his clothes back on.
He stops at the side of the bed, looking over Dean. He’s lying on his back, head pillowed on the arms tucked behind his head. He’s terribly scarred, yes, but he’s also gorgeous. Lean, fit, tan on his arms and legs but pale on his belly and chest.
Steve is sitting silently on the toolbox when Dean enters the garage, and he only looks up when he hears the sound of the door closing.
“— crazy. Ghosts are real, Ann Marie, and there’s one haunting —”
“So talk,” Sam says stiffly.
When it’s over and they’re tangled together, limbs crossed and noses pressed against each other, Cas makes a mistake.
“Mom’s healthy.” Jody puts a hand on his shoulder, but it’s not nearly as comforting as the way Cas leans slightly against him. “So is baby. A boy. Seven pounds, five ounces. Congratulations, Dean. You’re an uncle.”
“I’m not leaving you with nowhere to go. I’ll pick you up tomorrow morning.”
“So,” Claire begins. “What are you going to do?”
He has a home there — one he owns, where he can stay until he gets back on his feet, whatever that means. And Jack was there, was born there — if there’s any residual power left from that event, enough to bring him back — well, Cas has to try.
“Who’s Cas?” Andrew asks, but he’s ignored as Sam and Dean continue to stare each other down.
Cas shakes his head. “No. No ID. Just— Keep him down as Dean Smith.”
Once a month, Cas attends the Shurley Enterprises board meetings. It’s one of his least favorite things to do. The Shurley family money makes its own money at this point, and the company’s holdings are vast and diverse. He cares about Shurley Enterprises so far as the company pays him a salary which he invests directly into Halo. He’s never been interested in stocks and bonds and graphs and estimates. It makes him a bad president and CEO, certainly, but a good vigilante.
Sam’s eyes widen. “Oh my god, I'm right! You’re jealous of Lisa, not Cas...”
“Anna,” he pants, and the word barely comes out. His throat is so parched. She hands him a plastic cup full of water, and Cas downs it in one go.
. You’re a good man.” He shakes his head, and she says, “You
“Sam!” Dean calls on instinct, wincing at the pain shouting causes.
“I can’t kill Sammy, but you can tie his life to mine. Make it the lock to wherever you’re sending me. And throw away the key.” He’d gestured at himself. “You think as long as he’s kicking he’ll try to save me? Make it impossible for me to come back while he’s alive. I know you can.”
Face twisted with disgust, Dean says, “Because he wanted to hide that he’s been in it, too. Haven’t you?”
In the morning, Dean’s gone.
“Dean!” Sam calls out behind him, but Dean ducks away from the crowd, walking like he’s going to go into the bunkhouse before dodging around it at the last second, heading for the spot in the woods James walked through.
but even louder and more obnoxious.”
Cas flips through the pages faster, skimming crash reports and newspaper articles, muttering something under his breath. Counting, Dean realizes.
Mills walks over to the wall behind the Halo signal and picks up a manila folder. She holds it up as she says, “One of my undercover officers obtained photos of a few known members of the MacLeod crime gang at the docks. The MacLeods are infamous in Scotland, but I’ve never heard of them coming to America before. I don’t know what they want or why they’re here. My undercover isn’t in a position to get close to them without compromising his own investigation. I’m assuming this is either a lead you’re willing to chase or are already chasing.”
For a moment, Dean’s sure he misunderstood. “What?” he asks, like an idiot, interrupting Samuel’s tale. His father’s eyes flash and he holds up a palm. Dean tries not to flinch away.
There’s a long pause from the front of the car as Cas considers this.
, Dean tells himself, but Cas smiles again, the skin around the corners of his eyes crinkling, and Dean drops his head on Cas’s shoulder.
“Yeah Cas?” Dean says, and in the background Cas can see the Braedens and Sam looking on, their worried frowns melting into a blur.
Finding Dean wasn’t a second chance because Cas will never get back what he lost that day, but helping Dean still feels a bit like redemption.
Cas blinks, startled.
“Let’s fix this. Together.”
“Eileen can’t hear!”
“Thank you,” he whispers back. “Thank you.”
It takes about fifteen minutes, and the smell of coffee wafting up the stairs, for Dean to show his face in the kitchen. There’s a quilt pattern pressed into his cheek. His hair is mussed and his eyes are bleary. He looks very appealing, in an intimate sort of way, and Cas hates the smile trying to worm its way onto his face at the sight of him.
“He asked for you,” Sam said. “He knows about the bunker, Dean. How could he know about that?”
“I don’t disagree.” Cas groans, rubbing a hand down his face. “I don’t know what is just here. I don’t know, I— I hate him. That’s it. I hate him for what he’s done to you. To us.”
“There’s always a choice,” Dean says. “You’re just afraid to make it. And I’m not going to make it for you.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, “I think so, too. I was hoping to get a closer look at whatever’s in MacLeod’s briefcase, but Claire’s doing my job for me.” They keep their knees turned together, careful to watch the table peripherally. “What have you heard about him?”
like that.”
See, Dean used to think no-strings hookups with waitresses and random bar women were uncomplicated, so long as both parties made it clear from the get-go that they didn’t want anything more than a one night stand. But truthfully, something about those encounters always stressed Dean out. He always felt determined to make those women feel good, but he never spent enough time with them to figure out what exactly made them tick — or vice versa. The older he got, the more complicated those one night stands felt — maybe they left satisfied, but Dean would still be lying there trying to figure out how he could have preformed better, why meaningless sex was never as great as it used to be.
“They’re part of the cult,” Dean says flatly. “It’s a family affair. “
“Sam.” Cas’s voice is dry, even.
One second Ben is leaning heavily against Cas as they do their awkward three-legged walk down the path, and in the next there’s a blast of cold air as the teenager is ripped out from under Cas’s arm. He hears an “Umf!” of pain and surprise that could have either come from Ben or Sam, and then Cas himself is on the ground.
s to pick up on the real truth. Cas is a friggin’ alien who’s worn a human suit for all of eight years, and Dean, certified homo sapien since 1979, only figured it out like two days ago. He needs to explain it to Cas.
He looks at Cas, who tilts his head in confusion.
He keeps saying it, a mantra of sorts, a promise that whatever happened before won’t happen again because here and now, Dean’s sure of one thing — it’s Cas he’s been missing, Cas he won’t let go again.
He runs toward the voice, a voice that has signified salvation and safety and
“You are too!” She shoves him, but her cheeks are red. Dean almost feels bad. He knows she has a crush on Caleb, a nomad who joined the compound last year after Samuel caught him stealing food from the community garden. But Caleb’s twenty already, and Dean doubts he even knows Gwen, still a lowly teenager, exists.
“Fuck.” Sam closes his eyes and lets his head fall back against the headrest. He doesn’t need to hear the rest of that sentence to guess what horrors it would hold. He looks over at Eileen, who’s clearly frustrated at being left out of the conversation. He signs “
“Well, he did,” says the rest of Dean, who’s pretty good at denial when it suits him.
“I watched over you that year you spent at the Braedens.”
And Dean isn’t thinking about Cas right now, so—
“The problem is, if you had spent any time with us at all you would have known how much Cas means to us. How much he means to me.” Dean’s voice cracks a little. “You would have already known about the Grigori and how Cas helped kill one. You would have known about all the times he's saved my life, in all these different ways. You would have known about our friend Garth — he’s a werewolf — or Benny, the vampire who helped get me out of Purgatory. You would have known that hunting is different for us, that we don’t just kill people because they’re not human. But you don’t know any of that. You don’t know anything about us, because you couldn’t wait to get away from us.”
Mama is in the next room reading, and Dean doesn’t think Samuel would hit him where she could hear it, but his shoulders are still tense as he follows his father into his office. Samuel doesn’t let anyone else in the room much, and Dean tries not to stare too hard at the maps on the walls or the notepads on the desk. Samuel’s plans are beyond his understanding, or so he’s always been told.
As he walks inside, Cas avoids looking at the spot by the shore where Jack’s power breached the womb, breached worlds. The place where he died.
After a few moments of awkward silence, Lucas says, “He’s the one who saved me. Dean. He kept me from drowning when a poltergeist pulled me into a lake. I always wanted to say thank you, you know, as an adult. For everything.”
“I know it sounds crazy,” she says, “but I know what I saw. And you said —”
Cas can see Dean’s face, the concern and the fear, before it’s replaced with one of those flashes, a brief glimpse of Dean,
“Don’t,” Cas says, squeezing Jack’s shoulder. “You did nothing wrong, alright? Nothing. I love you, and I’m glad you’re okay.”
Dean stares at his father’s blue eyes, and he thinks of his dreams. The woman with long blonde hair and a kind smile, blue eyes bright as she holds his small hands. The amulet hanging beneath his shirt feels heavy against his chest.
“He did a poor job at that.” Cas smiles faintly. “Look at you now.”
Funny how love feels akin to a stab through the heart, just the way every cliché human love song claims.
“It had occurred to me. But I won’t.” Dean sighs, and Cas says, “Dean, I’m not going to run away again. I want us to talk. But I need to show you—”
The Winchesters divorced in 1985. It’s not uncommon among families with missing or kidnapped children — the high stress is enough to break even the tightest bonds, and both Mary and John will admit their marriage was already on edge before Dean’s kidnapping. Sam grew up in a divided home, living with his mother because John had turned to alcohol to numb his pain.
At that thought, he begins walking forward again, crossing the street and starting to put some distance between himself and the Winchesters. That’s what he does, after all — he moves away from them when he’s upset or in trouble, so they won’t see him struggle, all the while wishing that for once they’d ask him to stay in one place, with them. That Dean would ask Cas to stay with him.
Cas doesn’t know. He wonders if that makes him a hypocrite. He decides to stop lurking, holding up the greasy bags of burgers he picked up from McDonald’s and stepping into the light. “I’ve got food, if you two can drop the car parts for two seconds!”
Dean smiles sadly. “I don’t even know how many times Alastair killed me just to throw me in the Pool again. He thought it would make me more powerful, and he was right. It made me powerful enough to escape, eventually.”
Angels know devotion. Michael has known it well himself, loving an absent father for millennia. It’s a powerful emotion, powerful enough to fell an archangel, and Michael recognizes that now. He is nothing if not a strategist. He knows he cannot control any universe in which Dean Winchester is separated from Castiel. One stubborn human would move heaven, earth, and an archangel to reach one rebellious little seraph. It’s best to tie up loose ends, make sure all parties are satisfied, and take out the biggest threats, leaving room for Michael to slither in and conquer while his enemies are otherwise occupied. Pairing the two of them across the multi-verse is a win-win situation.
“Cas?”
Dean’s never been that great at following orders that come from someone other than John Winchester. He jogs to reach James, not bothering to hide his heavy footfalls. He doesn’t want to get stabbed, after all.
, but he doesn’t. Instead he nods, giving Claire a jerky little salute before he walks out of Cas’s room and into the hall, where he feels like he can breathe again.
“I ain’t ever seen him before,” Bobby says. “They must not come around often.”
The head of the vessel tilts, and all the bones in the neck crack, starting to chip and crumble into dust.
As he walks away from the library, Cas spots a
“Let’s go home,” he says, Chinese food forgotten. He pats Dean on the shoulder as he passes on the way to the truck, letting his hand linger longer than he probably should. Dean doesn’t say anything until they’re pulling out of the parking lot and on to the road.
“Well,” he says, “I suppose that explains the thoroughness.”
“Man, that guy loved him some good pizza.”
Corruption is bleeding into the Grace now, pouring out of the enemy’s pores and poisoning the air around it. Cas falls to his knees, and his Grace still rages around him. The walls are crumbling and the floor is cracking.
“It worked much better than I hoped. As it turns out, the grace of the other angels he’d imbibed didn’t take to him so well. It must have emerged to fight against him, because that explosion was caused by far more than the power of one seraph.” He pauses. “In the end his greed is what really killed him.”
“But why is he waiting to make his move?” he asks. “There’s something else going on. I don’t know what it is, but there’s more to his plan than taking on Roman. Is he stockpiling the weapons he’s stolen? What scares me is what he might do with them if he decides to use them.”
Then he’d actually thought of what it would mean to say such a thing, and Cas realized that Dean’s love for him surely is as different from his love for Dean as one galaxy is from the next. There’s so much space between them, an incalculable divide. Perhaps an angel could cross it, but a human never could.
“He’s getting us food,” Jack explains, and Dean rolls his eyes and continues on his mission, ignoring the little voice in his head that says it’s fucked up to bring a veritable three-day-old boy to the 21-and-over section. “He said he’d get something from every place for me to try, but I want chocolate.”
Dean grunts in response.
So when Sam called and he was so sure they’d finally get back to the case, Dean counted himself blessed that he could (mostly) put away his thoughts of dry humping his best friend to focus on the task at hand.
“What did she say?” Sam asks, and he can’t stop his voice from trembling. Eileen looks at him with sympathy.
Green Eyes looks at Cas, pleading, as if Cas might save him from this, too. Cas wants to say something, to tell Leahy to back off, but this isn’t his investigation. Green Eyes isn’t his witness, and he can’t do anything to jeopardize his place in this room, to risk his ability to make sure Green Eyes gets out of this alright.
But there’s business they have to take care of first.
It’s not a train of thought he wants to be on for long. Dean focuses instead on the door in front of him, straining to hear any noise coming from the other side. There’s the sound of footsteps inside the house, and the porch light turns on above their heads.
When he hears the footsteps thudding up the stairs, he knows he doesn’t have to imagine anymore.
Cas keeps his index finger on the man’s sluggish pulse as he says, “No, attempted suicide by hanging. He’s still alive, but I need a medic up here.”
“Thanks,” he says automatically, pressing his nail under the seal to crack it open. Mama grabs his hand.
They sit in silence for a while before Sam says, “I’m going to be spending a few extra days here after the case is over.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, still sounding dumbfounded. “Bye, Cas.”
Seth scoffs. “Angels burn their vessels up. That girl’s been dead since she said yes.”
“Well,” he says, “I guess there isn’t an excuse.”
As the first heaving sob wracks his body, a large, trembling hand sets itself on his shoulder blade, rubbing gently. Dean falls apart, face to the floor, while another Castiel tries to hold him up.
So Cas forces himself to shatter the calm.
Cas thinks of Chuck, staring longingly at Michael’s portrait in the main hall of Shurley Manor. Chuck never hid his favoritism from the rest of his children. “I’m sorry.”
“Because,” Dean continues, “I gotta tell you, Cas, the money you throw into it isn’t going where you think it’s going.”
Giving Cas the damn mixtape turns out to be more nerve-wracking than Dean anticipated.
this to be different.”
“You could say that.” Cas runs a hand across his forehead and points the vents at himself. “My students are... testing me. Rigorously.”
The healing came suddenly, but his body still feels... off. Dean pushes the barn door outward, and Cas slowly walks through it. Dean’s looking at him, a certain sadness in his eyes mingling with relief, and Cas doesn’t know what to say. He resists the urge to touch Dean’s shoulder. He’s not dying anymore.
Dean can’t make out the voice on the other end, but he watches Cas’s eyes widen, suddenly awake and alert. Cas rolls back over and trips out of the bed, legs tangled in sheets, but he manages to keep the phone pressed into the crook between his shoulder and his ear.
“He told me he’s not letting you go back to school,” she says. “I’ll try to talk him out of it when he calms down.”
“Fuck,” Dean mutters under his breath. “Alright, you keep your head down, okay?” He pulls his gun out of the glove box, handing Cas a well-worn map at the same time. “If they don’t recognize us, we pretend we got lost. If they do...”
Mary was granted sole custody of Sam, and John also disappeared from their lives in a way. He’d sometimes show up on Sam’s birthday or at Christmas with a present — “Never anything age appropriate,” Sam says — or he would randomly come to a baseball game or a school play. John was a nomad, splitting his time between living with his parents in Lawrence, staying with sympathetic friends around the country, and, increasingly, sleeping in his car.
“Joanna Beth,” he says, teasing, “I’ve got a loose heifer with your name on it on Highway 9 north of the first Black Creek bridge.”
Cas stands to take off his coat, and Dean doesn’t ask him for a second healing. He watches Cas undress, not hungry, not lustful, just... at peace. When Cas lifts up the covers and gets in on his side of the bed, curling around Dean automatically, Dean gets that feeling again, that pressure behind his eyes, so he closes them.
At one point he thinks he hears something in the edge of the wood, but it turns out to be a cow — one of the bordering farms has a fence down, so Dean calls the sheriff’s office to get someone out to talk to the landowner before more cows escape and get onto the highway, a typical problem for law enforcement in rural Texas.
“I don’t know,” Jack says, coughing between words. “I just went to go check on Grandpa, and this Demon was there.”
Cas tries to give his report like Chuck used to — facts only, no emotions. But he’s not Chuck. He feels too much to be Chuck. When he gets to Claire’s act of disobedience, his veneer snaps.
“Castiel Novak.” Cas reaches out a hand for the man to shake. He takes it. His grip is strong and his palms are calloused. Cas would bet he’s the only man in this room with callouses on his hands. “I don’t believe we’ve had the pleasure of meeting.”
He really wishes he could grab Cas’s hand. It’s so close, resting on his knee mere inches away. He could just reach out and…
“You idiot,” Sam mumbles into Dean’s shirt, his tears soaking it. “You can’t—”
For a moment, it’s clear she wants to say something. Mama takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly, looking at him all the while. He can almost see the struggle inside of her, the way she grasps for the words like he used to when he was toddler and Pa scared him. He holds up his hand, pointer, pinky and index fingers extended.
He stays awake for a long time, listening to Cas breathe.
“Harvelle. Please.” That’s an order for sure. Jo straightens up and flips open her notepad, holding a hand over it to keep the ink from bleeding in the rain.
it, I can’t fucking — I can’t explain. But I know.”
He’s spitting a clump of dirt and grass out of his mouth when he hears Cas say, “Oh, Dean,” in the most exasperated voice, and Dean should be angry but he starts laughing instead. He rolls over onto his back because he might as well get totally filthy at this point, and says, “Oh, Dean,” in an exaggerated imitation of Cas's rough voice. Cas comes into view, towering over Dean with his eyebrows raised.
“Um.” Jo shakes her head, as if clearing her thoughts. “Well, that’s— you said he’s all right?” she asks, distracted, staring at the wet mess on the counter.
D — E — A —N.
“I guess sometimes they do,” Dean says, something in his voice that Cas recognizes, a love that Dean may never be able to put words to, but Cas understands it now. Dean is more difficult to read than most, but he loves deeply, to his bones, and he only tries to bring back those he desperately needs in his life.
“Dean,” Sam says, and he looks so damn exhausted, “let’s pull over and eat.”
“I just want a chance to not be alone anymore,” Cas says. “I don’t truly want to die because I don’t know what happens to me when I do... but I’m not sure I want to live like this anymore, either. So if I come up with a better plan, I’ll take it, and maybe I can go home and at least hear my siblings again, even if they never speak directly to me. But if I can’t, if I have to die, at least I’ll die doing something of worth to the world. At least I’ll die fixing my mistake. And then I won’t feel...” He gestures to himself, hand shaking. “All of this pain. Which would be nice. I don’t think I’m meant for it, the pain. I went millennia without it, and now it just seems so... heavy. And it gets heavier every time I — Every time I think of you getting your memories back and leaving me again.”
“You should go to bed.” It’s Balthazar who says it, surprisingly enough. He’s lounging on the plush settee in the middle of the hallway eating grapes. Anna sits rigidly next to him, her old batons laid across her lap. Cas is the only one standing up, leaning against a portrait of their great-great-grandfather that takes up the entire wall.
Dean adjusts his grip on the gun, approaching the door cautiously. When he reaches out for the knob he’s sure to yank it open fast, immediately putting both hands on the gun and pointing into the face of...
He trails off, not wanting to say more in front of the truck driver, who stares at them, open-mouthed, from the cab. Dean has the decency to appear at least a tiny bit chagrined, and he closes the truck door with a two-fingered salute to the driver, stepping down from the cab so he’s eye level with Cas.
Dean nods, and he hugs her again, arms tight around her shoulders. Mama huffs a laugh. “You’re sure that’s all that’s bothering you?” she asks.
“I’ll try the spaghetti with pesto,” Cas says, picking out the first item he sees on the menu.
“Ams,” calls out Alex, who leans into Claire once she sits back down. “Tell us how you and Sam met.”
“Yeah, I can’t walk just yet, but I think if I focus more on healing the right leg I should be able to ditch the brace and get off crutches in a week or two,” Jack says. “I’ll be back on the streets with you in no time.”
She begins the story Cas knows by heart because he was there — Ann Marie actually met Dean first (and slept with him, though she always leaves that part out in front of her kids), when he was a demon. Sam, following his brother’s trail, talked at length with the pretty blonde waitress who’d recently seen the elder Winchester. He gave her his number in case Dean came back, and they both forgot about it. Nearly two years later Ann Marie found Sam’s fake FBI business card in the bottom of her purse. She called just to see if Sam ever found his mark, and then she mentioned off-handedly that the bar she worked at was experiencing some strange phenomena at night. Cas and Sam arrived to investigate, and the rest is history.
Cas watches Bobby shrug, disgruntled but giving in anyway. Jody says, “Yes, of course. My office would be glad to help with whatever you need.”
Dean and the agents left to scout out the Campbell compound almost six hours ago. Dean was silent as Leahy and Reidy arrived to pick him up. He didn’t even speak to Cas all morning, choosing to sit on the back porch and stare at the mountains while Cas worried in the house. He’s still worrying, so much so his stomach churns and his legs feel wobbly, but he can’t sit down. Every time he tries, his every nerve alights, commanding he
If he could think of a way to bring them back to Lisa, to get a final answer on whether to reveal the truth to her, Cas would do it right away, get it over with.
“No,” Cas confesses, to a journalist, like an idiot with a crush. Like the idiot he knows he is if he trusts Dean at all, which, unfortunately, he does. “She’s planting a bug at the table. I need to know who he’s dealing with so I know who I’m dealing with.”
“You seem like a good kid,” Dean says instead. “My advice, for what it’s worth — don’t go looking for this stuff. Go to school, get a real job.” Dean smiles mirthlessly. “Killing ghosts and ghouls doesn’t pay real well.”
(or finally fucking) taking their relationship to the next level.
All the potential arguments Cas built for this moment drain away, replaced by concern.
“Yeah, that too. I guess we're both in similar boats, here.” He turns slightly so he can see Cas out of the corner of his eye. “Cas, I needed to talk to her. I needed to know
“Oh god...” Everything that follows seems to happen in a blur — the man blinks, and Cas hears his rattling breath; Cas frantically grabs onto his knees with one arm, clumsily attempting to support him by creating slack in the rope to let him breathe. Cas saws at the rope one-handed, muttering, “You’re going to be okay, I’ve got you, hold on, you’re going to be fine” as he tries to support the weight of a full-grown man and cut through a thick piece of hemp at the same time.
He breathes out, and it feels like a drowning man’s first gasp of air when he breaches the surface. “Darling.” Cas never calls her that, because Jimmy called her that. It’s his, and Cas takes it from him and ruins it, like he took his little girl and turned her into a bomb. Cas rubs his thumb over her cheek and hates himself. “I need you to stay right here, okay?” She nods, blinking sluggishly. “I promise I will be right back for you. I just have to make sure the others are alright.”
In the midst of a hunt, Dean had reluctantly turned her down, asking, “Tomorrow?” She’d slid him her number on a bar napkin.
Dean stares at him, dumbstruck, and Cas starts to turn away, face red. Dean grabs him by the chin, gently tugging him back. Cas looks afraid, and Dean can’t think of a single thing to say to reassure him, to let him know that no, it’s not too much too soon because they’ve been falling for each other since Dean wrote his name on Cas’s hand in the hospital. He’s never been good with words, so Dean chooses action. He kisses Cas firmly, holding his chin in place, keeping the pressure on until Cas melts into it, relaxing enough to put his hands on Dean’s waist, feather light.
Dean pushes Cas back further, so he’s pressed up against the dashboard. The man shakes his head.
“Yeah, I know,” she says softly. “But today will be stressful enough without you having an episode while you’re alone. I wish you’d wait —”
Crowley’s eyes narrow.
“Have you texted him?”
Near North Cove. Where Jack was born.
“Come home with me,” he says, and Dean wouldn’t dream of doing anything else.
Cas says softly, “Of course, Dean. He loves you.” Dean bites back an incredulous laugh. It’s hard to imagine the cantankerous old man loving anyone. “He does! You think he spends that much time with just anyone? He’ll help. Bobby knows this area better than anyone else I know. He could at least help us brainstorm.”
Sam’s not sure exactly when it started — maybe two, three years ago? He’d walk in on Dean, standing alone in the middle of some room in the bunker, usually his own, just talking to the air.
“Who wouldn’t want you?”
“We—“ Bobby points between them. “—can’t do anything other than be there for him, Cas.”
”Dean—” Dean’s hands are shaking.
“It’s a special birthday. I’m an adult.” Dean sticks his tongue out at her.
Instead he watches Dean as his friend’s face beginning to slowly slacken, his eyelids fluttering slightly, jaw loosening. He stayed up all night, and Dean really needs the sleep. Now that he feels a bit of resolution coming, a bit of relief, he might actually get some. Cas could maybe use some sleep too, but he’ll gladly stay awake to watch over the campsite and Ben, and more importantly to watch over Dean.
“Sometimes, especially when there are animals involved.” Cas sits at his desk, and Leahy takes Bobby’s empty seat across from him.
He hears Cas’s truck bumping up the pothole-marked drive before he sees it. He can’t make out Cas in the driver’s seat, and when he pulls in behind the Impala and doesn’t get out, Dean rises to his feet, just to make sure.
“Won’t do you any good, boys, but you’re welcome to try.” Dagon holds her arms out in a
It didn’t escape his notice that Cas said his sister did this for him, and it reminds Dean of how his mother —
“Please, Dean —”
Cas scoots across the bench seat, pushing the papers into the floorboard and getting close to Dean. Too close for comfort. He always pushed like this during confrontations — standing right in front of Dean, staring him down until Dean decided to yield. The effect is somewhat muted in the car, but Dean’s breath catches nonetheless.
It starts to walk toward the closed door Cas is resting behind, and Dean quickly stands, shocked into stillness for a second by the pressure in his side.
Sam told him to lay down in the back seat, to try to calm down, but Dean’s too shaky and guilt consumed to do anything but look at the window, counting the miles to The Bend.
“Just be careful, son,” he says, and unlike usual, Cas bristles at the diminutive nickname.
Ignorant of his request, or perhaps just purposefully antagonistic, Gracie jumps into his lap before he can pull his sweatpants on, digging her claws into the fabric of his boxers. Cas shoves her off his lap with a muted gasp of pain, and she glares at him from the floor.
So he lies on a different motel bed every week while the twins chant over him, feeling the faint movement under his skin, the sparking pain as the grace fights its banishment. Then he lies there longer once the ritual is over, waiting till he’s well enough to drive. The twins sit with him every time, watching documentaries he likes, telling Cas stories about their childhood which he trades for stories of his time as a warrior of God, many of them the same as the ones he tells Dean.
Cas looks at Dean dazedly, scrunching his nose in confusion. It would be adorable if he didn’t still seem so upset.
, Cas thinks, bright burst of anger like a wildfire in his chest,
, and suddenly it all makes sense.
now, and he hears it again — a low, steady hum.
“Cas, I’m here because of you,” Dean says desperately. “I do want the memories; I want you to find your grace. Cas, I want you...”
“Okay,” Dean says, moving toward the end of the bed. “You’ve got painkillers in your system already, I’m guessing?” He doesn’t want to be the one to make Cas hurt.
“Fuck,” Cas whispers. He pushes himself off the glass-covered floor, wincing as a shard gets stuck in his palm, and starts to run.
“Dad’s not here,” he said when Deacon opened the door to his small apartment. “Do you want to—” That was all he had to say.
Cas is already at their spot when Dean pulls in, leaning against his Continental with his arms crossed. He’s irritated, and it pisses Dean off. He bailed on Cas for three days. Cas bailed on him for nine months. It’s about damn time this unspoken argument between them comes to a head.
Jo’s mouth drops open, and her hand, previously wiping the bar down mindlessly, freezes. “I—”
,” he writes on a scrap of notepad paper, then he resumes drawing on the map. This little unnamed road branches off like the one he drew for Bobby, one branch running along the creek at the base of the mountain, ending in a dead end, and the other crossing over what must be a bridge, climbing the mountain into the neighboring county. Dean’s little road follows the rise in elevation, snaking just below the peak before plunging into a valley where it ends. Dean draws small boxes around the end of his road — buildings, Cas realizes.
“I know your name,” Dean says aloud, awed. He wants to know more, wants to know everything, but that thought drifts away when he feels Cas’s dick settle against his hip. Cas smiles against Dean’s neck as he begins to move his body against Dean’s in a slow grind.
Dean introduces himself, and Creaser nods, knowing. Of course he knows. He’s been with
“Coming with you,” Cas interrupts. “Like always, Dean.”
“You won’t lose me,” he says, searching Dean’s eyes. “You’re the reason I’m here. You’re the reason I’ve stayed.”
“I don’t know,” she says quietly, voice shaking. “There was this bright light, and I had to close my eyes. Then the rain started and the lightning was everywhere, and when I opened my eyes again — they were all gone. All the demons, just vanished. But I waited, waited for
“DON’T CALL ME THAT!” Cas yells, and this time Dean is the one to move away, falling back on his hands like Cas slapped him. Cas shakes, looking between Andrew’s body and Dean, eyes wild. “You don’t get to call me that anymore! You don’t get to pretend like you care about me! Don’t touch me! Don’t —”
“You don’t have to be. Not for that. Sometimes things just don’t work.”
that seems to follow them every time.
“I’ve drawn out everything I could while still keeping enough to remain an angel.” Cas pulls at the cord around his neck, bringing up a vial filled with grace and Sam’s blood. Each spell requires both ingredients. “You’ll use half of this on the spell to open the Empty; half I’ll keep. I’ll need it to cure Dean of the Mark. And if I need more —" He gestures to the vein running along his neck. “— I’ll take more.”
. “Look, Cas, I’m not giving him much. But the kid needs some walking around money for when he does get out on his own, and I’ve seen how he drags his feet about accepting anything from you. And he’s very attached to you.” Bobby raises his eyebrows, and Cas looks away,
“Yes, please. Do you have a pen? I’ll write down the address to send it to.” Jo produces a notepad and a chewed stub of a pencil from beneath the pile of debris on her desk, and Cas scribbles down the address for the ranger station, along with his house phone. He doesn’t want to spook her by requesting to have it sent directly to Jody or Leahy. “Thank you.”
“A Dean Smith attended five different school districts in the county from third grade to his sophomore year of high school.” Leahy points at the page Cas is holding. “That’s the last school picture of him, age fifteen, in 1995. He dropped out in the middle of the school year and didn’t enroll anywhere else.”
Alarm bells wake Dean from a fitful sleep, and he nearly falls out of bed while scrambling for the gun he placed on the desk.
“Maybe… Maybe Bobby could help.”
“And I’m glad you and Sam are working things out,” Dean adds. “I mean, I was friggin’ pissed that he kept it from me, but... I get it. He never knew you.” He looks at his brother. “This is easier for you, I guess. You don’t have any template, here.” Dean turns back to Mary. “And my childhood memories of you don’t match up with the real deal, which I know it isn’t fair of me to expect them to, but honestly...” He sighs. “I was disappointed because the mom I remembered was always this light for me, the one parent I knew loved me.”
“Hello, VIPs of Purgatory,” a disembodied voice says over the room’s loudspeakers. On screen, the red-masked figure tilts its head. The yellow eyes of the hood are unblinking. “I hope you’ve all enjoyed your $1,500 steak and lobster and all the complimentary, self-congratulatory circle-jerking provided by our generous hosts, the Shurley family.”
It’s getting harder and harder to believe that.
“Well, when do you want to put in the replacement? We’ll have to place a new order out at Bud’s; the porch is a different wood from your flooring.”
“Dean,” Cas says quietly, “I don’t think it was stupid to quit. Those people are your friends. You felt betrayed by them.”
Dean closes his eyes, shudders.
“Hang on.” Cas coming back threw a wrench in Dean’s life he’d like to fix or break himself, and he’s not going to let Gabe put distance between them again. “I think you owe me an explanation for our last conversation.”
“I’ll sleep when this is over,” he says. Claire tried to get him to sleep last night, too. At least that’s better than trying to get him to talk. The kids are in bed now, but only because Cas promised Claire would get to take any calls from Jody with Jack as remote backup in place of Anna.
“Is there a reason why you’re here, Dean?”
“I didn’t say it like that,” Cas protests, but he allows Dean to kiss him. “And maybe I didn’t want that sex worker.”
“Down, professor. This is, uh—” Dean’s wine-blurred mind searches for the right way to explain the realization which came to him so clearly this afternoon as he pulled up PDFs of old books and read myths in lieu of sleeping. His sleep schedule is so off, which is not helping any more than the wine is. “This is gonna sound nuts.”
), and Lisa and Ben still safe and nearby. Not over something this old. Cas shouldn’t feel guilty about any of this anymore. So Dean grabs his friend’s shoulder and leans down a bit, just enough to catch a side glance from Cas. It works like clockwork, has since he first did it in Heaven’s green room, when he convinced Cas to defect from the only family he’d ever known. Cas looks at Dean with wide, worried eyes.
“Yeah, but —” Dean shakes his head. Killing angels is something Seth bragged about, something he never let anyone forget, but Dean always assumed it was just another one of his lines, like the stories he told about his vast knowledge of lore and his impressive collection of weapons. Maybe some of it was true, maybe he did actually kill a few angels, but Dean never fully bought the hype.
“If you’re sure, Dean,” she says.
“Goddamn it, drop it!”
“In your universe, yes,” he says. “But I am not of this universe. I come from a place where Dean said ‘yes,’ and I intend to return there after he’s had his fill of you.”
Cas texted him once he left work, and it makes Dean’s gut twist to think about him driving back home along Highway 9. He tries to tell himself it’s still early, too early for Wayne Whittaker to be prowling the highway. He watches the clock after 9 hits, counting the minutes as he waits for Cas to walk in.
Cas looks at the Mark and back at Dean, and he asks the question he’s wanted to ask all along: “Where did you go? Why didn’t you come home?”
Because this mansion was built by rich people who valued luxury over efficiency, the kitchen and the main dining room are quite far apart, connected by the long, thin, snaking hallways that make up the old servants’ corridors. Cas and the kids head instead for the former help’s dining room, which is right next to the kitchen and much less ostentatious. Anna is indeed already there, laptop on the table in front of her and glasses perched low on her nose.
Then Mary’s back, loud and clear. “The boys are here now, Victor.”
Silence, then —
“I’m sorry,” she says, and she tries to take his hand. He pulls it back. He doesn’t need to look at her to see her flinch.
“First hookup?” He thinks back to his early twenties, drunken and desperate and lonely, his world falling down around his ears. “Some man I met in Europe on a business trip with my father.” They’d met while Cas was on a hunt, looking for Azazel and Alistair. Cas’d been so strung out back then, wasting away and needing to feel something. Anything. He doesn't remember much about the encounter except it left him feeling worse, not better.
Sam holds a hand out to Lisa, who moves out from under Ben’s shoulder to shake it hesitantly.
The Cas voice cuts out. Dean sighs in relief, moving his hands away from his ears. The Darkness grew bored fast this time. He sits up, listening for that phantom call, and hears nothing.
you can think of.”
Dean gets out the duffle he dumped Cas’s medical stuff in. There’s not a lot to do for his chest now — it’s mostly scabbed over and the stitches have started to dissolve — but put new bandages and antibiotic cream on the cuts. Cas could probably do this part himself, but he lets Dean gently ease the sticky edges of the bandages away from his skin before he takes over applying the cream himself. Dean sits on the edges of the bed and watches his slender fingers work.
Dean scares himself, sometimes, wondering how long it will be before he has one of these “episodes” on the road or in the middle of a hunt. He doesn’t want to be alone if that happens, but he can’t imagine calling Sam and saying, “Hey, can you guys please stick close to me because I’m fucking terrified of something I can’t see?”
“Here,” he says, but she shakes her head.
, an unhelpful thought surges up.
“Yes.” Cas listens to the coffee pot gurgle, leaning against the counter. Bobby might be a bit irritated by another morning running the office alone, but it’s not as if Cas can impede a federal investigation. And he hopes this invitation means they’ll find out more about Green Eyes’ condition. “I’ll be there.”
There were a few johns who stood out — the trucker who wanted to blow him in return, the closeted gay man who cried when Dean let him fuck him between two dumpsters at a rest stop. Dean never loved any of them, never even liked them, and he never associated any songs with them.
“I’ll go tell her I’m sorry.” Cas stands, but Anna shakes her head, says, “Not right now, okay? You’ll only fight with her again. Let it cool.” When he sits down, Anna asks, “What’s wrong with you lately?”
, trusts Novak more than anyone else. I want to solve this; I want to bring these people to justice. I could use your help.”
“I can’t help it,” Jack says, and Dean doesn’t respond. He picks up the cheapest bottle of whiskey on the shelf, because it’s not like it matters if it tastes good. That’s not what it’s for.
Green Eyes leans back and closes his eyes, signaling the end of their odd, mostly one-sided conversation. Jody grabs Leahy’s elbow before she can say anything else, gently pulling her out of the room, murmuring something to her in the hall, too low for Cas to hear.
“Are you going to try to drown me in the bay?” Dean asks with wary resignation.
he signs back.
“He told me,” Cas says. “Sam, everyone makes mistakes. Look at me, for example. I’m still paying for mine, as I know you’re still paying for yours. I’m happy to help a fellow sufferer.”
He runs out of cash near Billings, where he uses his last twenty to buy a couple gallons of gas and a hot dog. He eats the hot dog sitting in the bed of his truck, watching cars whiz by on the highway. Cas calls Claire and gets her voicemail.
He sits there for a long time, long enough to feel so tired he lies down on the rug. He stares under the ratty old couch, looks at the dust bunnies collecting underneath it. Dean hopes the man isn’t going to leave him alone forever in this dark, dirty room. He hopes the man will come back and take him home. He wants to see Mommy and Daddy and Sam again.
“That’s kind of why I hit on Cas so blatantly,” she adds. “I felt like hey, I might as well try this because what do I have to lose? And he just seemed safe, you know?”
“But then he vanished,” Sam finishes for her, and she nods, looking at him evenly, not backing down.
“I... it’s just flashes,” he starts to answer, then stops. He’s not sure how to explain these intrusive bursts made up of the worst parts of his life, but he knows he has to now that they’re apparently bringing him to the ground in front of other people.
Sometimes Dean forgets who he is, but he’s always reminded when Cas begs Dean not to kill him.
with a viciousness he’d previously reserved for Alastair
Dean laughs, a hand dropping to squeeze Cas’s knee. “I’m not pure or young or a woman. You don’t have to worry about bamboozling me.” He leans forward and kisses Cas again. Slow. Deep. When he stops, this time he leaves his hand on Cas’s cheek.
Josephine shrugs, bumping up against the others from her spot in the middle of the bench. “My parents own the land next to the Bradbury’s. It backs up against the road. We took a four-wheeler to the edge of the wood.”
It all blends together in the end. He doesn’t remember the woman putting him in the backseat, doesn’t know if he’s really even there or if he’s alone, in the vast and empty. He feels like he’s watching his own body, and it’s pulling further and further away from him, all the taut strings that held him down breaking with a snap.
It may be a fact of life that everyone dies eventually, but Dean has seen so much death in such a relatively short span of time, the victim of a never-ending war, and he’s sick of it. Yet there’s nothing he can do to stop the tide of blood that follows the Winchesters in perpetuity, snatching away even the only loved one for whom death was never a guarantee.
He’s not surprised when all three of the teens look confused and shocked, glancing at each other with fear in their eyes. Dean knows they didn’t have anything to do with the accidents. He knows because it’s not them — it’s the fucking light. It’d be better for his sanity if the light was the product of a group of rebellious teenagers wracking havoc for no good reason, but of course that’s not the case. He’s still nowhere near close to solving the mystery of whatever the hell is going on here.
“Jesus,” Sam hisses, and Dean sees him struggling to pull on his pants. “It’s the middle of the night. This better be something important.”
Dean rolls his eyes, turning his own flashlight on as he approaches the kids. Josephine sets her mouth into a thin line — she’s never enjoyed the cat and mouse part of the street vandalism gig the way Krissy does, preferring not to get caught — and the boy is split between terrified and stubborn. He must be new to Krissy’s little gang.
“Sure am,” Bela crooned, holding out her arm in Dean’s direction. “Walk me back in?”
Cas squints at him, confused, and moves to stand up. Dean follows suit. They both turn to the spot on the road where the light vanished. Dean doesn’t see any sign it was there at all, but Cas abruptly reaches out and grabs his hand, pointing to the center of the road.
more to go. He can’t do this for the rest of his life.
Dean just laughs again, as ugly as the first time.
He runs around to the other side of the chip spreader, but the roadside is empty. He spins in a circle, panning the light over the trees along the highway. He catches the glowing eyes of a deer and jumps when it bounds away, knocking through the woods as it flees.
,” the angel hisses, “of the Castiel and the Winchesters show. It’s truly getting old.”
. “Your sharpshooting is second to no one but Gwendolyn these days, and your skills with a knife are second to none. And speaking of Gwen, I must say I’m happy to see you two are finally growing apart.” Dean chest’s feels heavy. He doesn’t speak. “I was most…
Castiel doesn’t get the chance to say it back. The Empty keeps its deals.
Maybe Cas can be human, after all.
Sam stares at him in shock. The Winchesters don’t tell just anyone about the bunker. It’s a hard-earned secret. Eileen knows about it because she lives there now. Charlie visited a few times before she died, and of course there was Kevin. They let Crowley in when he was still alive, but only on occasion, and they had to break wards to grant him entry every time. The bunker is still warded against angels, which must mean —
In his darker days, John carried around a drawing Dean made for him — stick figures of their little family next to a blob of a black car — and now that drawing is proudly displayed on the fridge. It’s a somewhat sad sight, amid the other things pinned to the fridge — pictures of Sam and Adam as they grow older and move through life events, wedding invitations and postcards from vacations. But it’s all they have when it comes to Dean.
They’re all looking at him expectantly, even Cas and Eileen. Dean’s caught off guard by the sudden silence, slack-jawed and wide-eyed. He opens his mouth, tries to say, “I don’t know where to begin,” and all that comes out is “I—” and nothing else. The pressure in his chest is back, and once again his throat is tight. He has no words. His fingers twitch on his knees, reaching for a notepad he left in Cas’s truck. They’re all still staring.
“It’s payment for the wrongs you have done to the fey. And souls and blood both provide power so I can keep crossing over to this world after my portals are damaged or destroyed.”
“Yeah, but the lady tells me I’m gonna have a little brother, and I don’t have one,” Dean points out. “And she’s not my mom.”
Pursing his lips into a thin line, Cas looks away.
“You— You made a friend named
“I’d like to ask you a few questions, alright?” Leahy says, signing as she speaks. “Do you use ASL?”
One day she asks how Sam can forgive her for what happened to Cas when Dean can’t. It’s not an accusation toward her eldest son; Mary truly doesn’t expect Dean to forgive her. But Sam’s still here, still talking to her in the parking lot of the diner whenever he can get away, and she needs to know why.
Sam’s distracted, talking over his shoulder to Cas about the merits of using Norse ruins in spells while Cas leans across the top of the car toward him, listening intently and interjecting with his own observations of ancient Norse culture every now and then. Dean might be slightly interested — because, hey, Vikings — but he’s pretending to studiously ignore the nerds by fumbling with the map of the area he’s spread out over Baby’s trunk. He has a reputation to uphold, after all, even if they’re the only three people around.
Cas bites his lip and waits it out. Dean goes to the bathroom, and Cas hears him brushing his teeth and washing his face. He slowly gets up, his knee cracking — something it does now, now that his grace is all but gone — and peels out of his own stuffy suit. Then he sits back down on the edge of the bed and waits some more.
he can’t let Hod hurt James, especially not while James is trying to protect him.
Why does he love humans? Because of her sons, the men who helped an angel to fall. She smiles slightly. She always told Dean angels were watching over him. At least one still is. “I think that yes, I was always predisposed to rebellion, to a greater love for humanity, but that's not a design flaw. It's a component of my personality your sons helped bring out even more. They’re very inspiring, Sam and Dean.”
Dean loses the Question Game because he can’t think of a single thing to say in response, and he’s still wiping tears away from his cheeks when he spots familiar headlights waiting at the far end of the road, stuck at the red light.
“He gave me what I wanted — the truth. I’m done with him.” The
Alice now.”
They’re at the campsite where Ben and his friends are staying, and Dean is pacing along the side of the stolen car, an old hatchback that Cas hopes they’ll have time to return once Sam arrives with the Impala. Lisa insisted on going to Ben’s tent alone, still wary of Dean’s in-depth knowledge of their lives. She left the two men in the parking lot to stew.
“Yes, it’s...” She pauses, clearly considering whether to tell this stranger where her son is or not. “About twenty miles from here.”
“Can you treat him?” he asks.
Cas bites his lip and nods. “Be careful.”
He swallows, hard. Cas doesn’t talk about this, ever, but today Dean’s laid it all out there for him. The least he can do is show some reciprocity. “My first job in the parks service, I worked in a much larger park than this one. There was a river running through it, and it would flood in the rainy season.” If he closes his eyes, he can still hear the roar of the water tumbling down the mountainside. “There were warning signs posted everywhere telling campers when to avoid the river, but we couldn’t really keep people from trying to fish or even kayak on it. The emergency calls when the waters were high were a daily occurrence.”
He hadn’t realized his hands were still shaking until she grabs one and holds it. “Okay… Okay. Thanks.”
They go through the list together. Bartholomew is still in prison — maximum security. Gadreel went clean, and Cas believes he’s changed. Raphael is dead; so are the Grigori and the Rit Zien. Zachariah and Malachi are in Purgatory Asylum. Naomi isn’t a fighter, and neither is Metatron. Anna marks them down as possible funders, but Cas doubts they’d work with someone like Hellfire. They don’t like to get their hands that dirty, even adjacently.
“Yeah.” Dean looks away. “Wasn’t meant to be.” Cas tries to imagine he doesn’t sound wistful. It doesn’t work. “How about something new?”
“Is he still in the trunk?”
, Dean thinks, or the Mark thinks. Charlie might be right. There’s no difference anymore. He’s corrupted through and through.
He came back to Highway 9 with a vague plan to gather clues now he knows (maybe) what he’s dealing with. But back on the road, alone, in the dark, it seems like a shitty plan.
“Ouch.” Sam draws out a noise through his teeth in sympathy. “We’re going to help you walk back, okay? You’re with us now, so there’s no need to be worried.”
In a burst of terrible fear, Cas remembered the Appalachian Trail murders. He wasn’t about to become another statistic. He reached for the gun.
He thinks of Ellen’s daughter, Jo. She was a little tornado of a girl, all blonde hair and elbows and knobby knees. He thinks of the Winchesters, and his heart twists in his chest.
It’s embarrassing how quickly he comes, and from how relatively little stimulation. In his defense, it’s been a long time, and Dean is the most attractive man Cas has ever seen. In only a few minutes, he’s shuddering Dean’s name, Dean grinning against his throat. “Fuck,” Dean says, “fuck, Cas.” It takes him a bit longer, thrusting against Cas’s hip, but soon a shiver wracks his body and Cas feels Dean’s release on his skin.
“You like the dome?” he asks, seeming to take joy from Dean’s choked retching. “It bypasses the human brain and goes straight for the grace. If you hit just the right spot, the programming kicks in and they start mumbling in Enochian. We got him to tell us his real name in about ten seconds flat. Fortunately, he has just enough grace left to keep him alive through all of this... It’s more fun that way.”
“Of course he is.” Cas presses his lips together, torn between relief Dean’s okay and worry for his missing friends and family. “He’s going to blame himself.”
Following a brief argument over whether or not they could safely take James to a hospital with such blatantly gruesome, non-accidental wounds (“Yes,” Sam said, “we take him and we leave him in the ER.” “No,” Dean insisted, much more forcefully, “I’m not leaving him again.”), they’re headed north, further into Nebraska to the home of a doctor Eileen knows.
The answer to that slightly panicked question is actually a yes, Lisa does remind Cas of a victim, she
“Dean, what are you talking about?”
“Understood,” the trucker says, already backing up. “You have a good night.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. “Fuck... Yeah, I did. I do.”
Dean furrows his brow. “Are you okay?” he asks, concerned.
— because he couldn’t stop Alastair all those years ago?
“Dean,” Cas says, wide eyes on the woman, “she wasn’t one of the ones who hurt me, maybe...”
Then Alastair smiles, his teeth yellow and cracked from Steve’s punches, his opening mouth a yawning abyss Dean refuses to look into.
“We’re on a first name basis again?” Dean asks, sipping from his mug to hide his face.
“We can take you to a more secure location if necessary.”
His landing wasn’t perfect; his vessel still feels... off. The barn door slams inward without his giving much thought to it, the lights crackle and burst around him without his notice. He’s only looking at the man at the end, the one with the raised gun in his hands and the raised handprint on his shoulder, hidden just beneath his t-shirt.
“Ah.” Turner crosses his arms over his chest. “If you’re here to complain about the piece he wrote on the Shurley Foundation, you can direct those complaints to me.”
“Castiel?” he asks uncertainly after several moments of tense silence, because it’s one thing to talk candidly to someone while they sleep and another thing entirely to have them wake up and stare back at you.
“Why did you leave the sheriff’s office?” Cas asks out of nowhere.
He wanted to go with Cas, though. They danced around each other for almost a year, at least in Dean’s head, and he thought the invitation was a breakthrough. Unlike Sam, Cas made no mention of introducing Dean to any of the TAs, no sly innuendos about the attractive co-eds dressing to impress. Cas said, “I’d enjoy your company more than that of any of those dull bastards,” and won Dean over.
Cas stares at Andrew’s crumpled body, then looks down at his own hands, dripping dark red.
“Well,” he says, trying not to sound too disappointed at the confirmation that Dean does indeed still care for Lisa romantically, “I didn’t ask her to ‘hit on me.’ I’m sorry it upsets you.”
?” He spits the word out as if it offends him.
“Dean,” he says, looking up once his breathing evens out some. His eyes are wet, and Dean sees wet tracks glistening on his cheeks. “You don’t have to be here. You can go. They usually stop after the first one.”
Cas is checking off all the boxes on Dean’s My Type of Guy list.
It’s true, but even as she types it Mary wonders if she really is part of the family, or if she still belongs to the past, tethered to the happier fragments of people who don’t exist anymore.
Dean stares at the empty place where Charlie stood, and he swears he feels something — a change in the wind, in the woods, a lightening of the darkness that’s prevailed along Highway 9 for decades. A willing sacrifice made from love, made possible by forgiveness; the ring made whole again.
“It’s not as big as the one under our house.” Claire shines her flashlight up and around the cave walls. “Just big enough to get one of those trucks through at a time.”
“I know, I know,” Sam says, but he doesn’t take his eyes off the park map he’s holding — they’re looking for a werewolf hiding somewhere in the Shoshone National Forest with very little luck — and he doesn’t bother to answer the phone. “Just let it go to voicemail. I think I’ve finally figured out where —”
He can’t. If he wanted to walk out of this place, he’s not sure he could.
“Maybe I’m a fan.”
“Just be still,” Dean says, scanning the woods with his eyes. He moves around to Lisa’s back while Cas steps forward to protect them from the front. Sam comes around to the side, so the Braedens are surrounded. “He’ll probably come back swinging, so if we say, ‘Duck,’ you better duck.”
The woman wrenches the back door open and collapses onto the seat, slamming the door shut behind her.
“Well if you’re so above all this, why are you here?” he asks, miffed. Now he’s taken note of Zorro’s suit, and it’s cheap and ill-fitting. The Zorro mask probably is a literal Zorro mask from an old Halloween costume. “Come to think of it, how did you get on the list? It’s a $1,500 ticket.”
So Jess decided to stay at Stanford with him. She told her parents she would be home later in the break and then dragged Sam and his pathetic duffel bag full of worn clothes to her dorm, where they burnt cookies in the communal oven and decorated a tiny tree Jess bought from a guy selling them out of the back of his van. Jess gave Sam a sweater that was a size too small but it didn't matter because he couldn't remember the last time he had clothes that fit, and Sam kissed her, long and hard and deep. He knew right then he loved that girl.
“How long did you know?”
“One, two, three, four...” The man counts, angry and harried. Dean starts the engine and guns it, getting a green light right when he needs it for once. He closes the door as they speed southbound toward home.
“The first time I held you, I knew I would love you more than the moon and stars,” Mama says. Her eyes are shining. Dean doesn’t know how to respond. “And I have. I’ve tried to do my best for you, and I’m afraid I’ve fallen short.”
He hates Sam now.
“You should rest now, Sam.” Cas shakes his head. “We can talk tomorrow.”
That will have to be enough for now.
“Fair enough.”
“Fuck,” Cas mutters, because this is not the Headquarters infirmary. He tries to sit up. Anna is there to push him back down.
that’s been sensed all over the place, weaving its way throughout the countryside, looking for a home. Then a week ago two angels died outside of a hunter’s compound right here in this very state, and rumor has it they were looking for that very same grace. Looking for you.”
“Sorry to show up out of the blue,” she says, walking in as he steps aside without a word. “I went by the park but Bobby told me you were off this weekend.”
“You’ve said similar things before.” Cas smiles, but it’s so sad and small, just a sliver of what Dean somehow knows he’s capable of. It’s the worn, tired smile of someone who can’t bear to fight anymore. Dean recognizes it from the face he sometimes catches in the mirror. “It didn’t turn out well, Dean.”
“It’s not the same, Dean,” Sam says, and Dean’s relieved he doesn’t point out there should be a massive difference between his sweet new girlfriend and the guy who blew into Dean’s life like a whirlwind and exited just as quickly. “He’s afraid you’ll hate him.”
Cas takes the phone away from his ear and looks at it. She didn’t have a second phone the last time they talked, and he can’t think of how to get her other number without calling Jody and revealing he’s left the Winchesters. He dials again, this time leaving a quick message. “Claire, it’s Castiel. Could you give me a call? I — Uh, I don’t know what your secondary number is. All right. Goodbye.”
They stare at each other, then both laugh awkwardly at the same time. Sam rubs the back of his neck, cheeks red.
“Sam got into trouble right after you left.” He closes his eyes. Dean hates talking about this. “Ruby came back from rehab, and they got into their old shit. She brings out the worst in him, man.” Cas listens without comment. “They were arrested for possession of a controlled substance, intent to distribute.”
Gracie saves him from having to decide. She’s been lurking in the hallway, waiting on the strangers to leave. The moment they’re gone she bolts into the living room and runs straight for Dean, not Cas. He’s too shocked by the sudden appearance of a six-pound cat in his lap that he forgets for a moment he’s allergic. When she bumps his chin with the hard part of her skull, his hands come up to pet her of their own accord.
Cas nods in agreement as he pulls out his suit. “Good idea, Claire. We’ll leave now and hopefully beat Roman and the Demons there.” When he closes the cabinet door, Anna is standing on the other side, face still pinched.
The emergency vehicles are forming a sort of blockade, jammed bumper to bumper in the streets and across the sidewalks. Their red and blue lights create a strobe effect, like the dive bar district is now a giant outdoor club. The police Chargers are at the front, a solid wall of muscle car blocking the road, while the ambulances wait in the back, their crews standing next to their still-running vehicles.
Cas regrets everything.
“Yes,” Cas says curtly. “Thank you.”
Cas hands over the bag without comment so she can take out a few more pretzels.
“I—I told them to kill me instead. They all laughed at me. ” He forces air out through his mouth, tries to keep going. “Alastair—” It doesn’t matter how disconnected Cas wants to be. He’s shaking, stuttering. Tears stream down his face. Dean’s hand twitches but doesn’t reach for him. Maybe he doesn’t know if he can. Cas struggles to block out the screams in his head. “Alastair took an iron pipe and— and
He doesn’t stop to think. He just runs.
“What?”
The line goes quiet, then Sam says, much more awake, “Who?”
“You killed my dad,” Dean whispers, and his eyes burn with unshed tears. “And for what? So you could have a vacation?”
“You’re hurt,” he says. “You need to get out, find Ellen, and get help.” He cups her face between his palms. “I won’t lose you because you’re too stubborn to know when to quit.”
“Not being able to talk to anyone but you is probably not a standard reaction to stress,” he mutters.
Their distress must be obvious from the surface, because this is the moment Jack chooses to wake them up.
Dean glances in the rearview mirror. Gabe is getting paler by the second, and the spot of damp, dark red on his light blue shirt is growing larger. He’s not going to make it. They both know that, but Dean can’t imagine leaving him on a street corner to die.
“Cas—” For a moment, there's an eighteen-year-old Dean in front of him, wide-eyed and lovely, and Cas thinks
“He called both of us
Cas leans toward the bed, responding to the command hidden in Sam’s tone, blue eyes now fierce and determined and focused.
Cas runs a hand through his hair, making it stick up straight.
“The ring?” Dean prods, but he knows exactly what Creaser is talking about.
Henriksen holds Dean’s gaze. Dean’s hands tremble in his lap. He shakes his head. It’s not that he doesn’t want to. He just… can’t.
“I’m not,” Mama says with conviction. She pulls back to look him in the eyes, and he’s reminded of the fierce ways she guarded him as a child. Hiding under tables, bandaging his cuts and bruises, redirecting Samuel’s rages. All the things he didn’t see, couldn’t remember, because he was too caught up in the idea of protecting her. She touches his face with her palm. “I’m sorry for what he did to you, what I allowed him to do. But I’ll never be sorry for sparing you this.” She smiles. “And you’re not the only one who wanted to be free, Dean.”
“Nana called them the night people. She said she saw them in the woods and on the road after it was built. They would stand there, surrounded by this bright light.” Dean’s breath catches in his throat. “She spotted them right in front of her once, standing in the middle of the highway. She braked hard, and when she came to a stop and looked back up, the light was gone.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. And it’s a pretty terrible idea, Cas. You know that, right?”
The workers left the roller parked on a slight incline, so it picks up speed as it moves over the gravel, headed straight for a row of three skid steer loaders, parked right in front of the generator.
Dean waves goodbye to the group at the table, and Leahy signs something that makes him blush as they walk away. He’s talking a lot more these days, but she's still teaching him words for when he gets too overwhelmed to speak.
“No?” Sam sits on the bed, and the springs groan beneath him in protest. “Don’t you guys check in with each other all the time now?”
He’s alone in bed, but the sheets next to him are depressed in the vague shape of a body and the balcony door is cracked. The curtains are pushed back by the open door, allowing the too-bright sliver of morning light in. Cas tries to call for Dean, but his throat is parched. He swallows and his saliva tastes of alcohol. Cas grimaces. He badly needs to brush his teeth.
article too?” Dean’s still grinning, and Cas smiles back.
She leaves, her footsteps falling heavy as she walks down the hallway.
, together, he’s ostracizing his kids, and he couldn’t save the man in front of them. All his failures under one roof. Cas looks at Dean and Dean stares back, and he can’t move.
“Look, I hope you didn’t come in here to tell me how to run my bar,” Jo says, “because I have a system, and it works. I take care of mine. And Dean’s been here enough he might as well fall under that category, even if I don’t know much about him.” She leans forward, fixing Cas with a level gaze. “But I do know this — that man, the asshole so desperate to find him? That’s Dean’s daddy.”
“Yes.” Cas clears his throat. “Just, uh. Thinking.”
“She won’t lose her license.” Cas grabs on to Dean’s knee. His hand is wet. “Neither will you. You’re both excellent at your jobs.”
“Thank God.”
Dean would have been okay with it — with never having Cas as anything other than his friend. He would have lived with it. He still meant every word he couldn’t say, every word he let Plant croon for him.
Dean watches lightning break across the sky in right front of them. Close. Too close.
But she did interrupt. Bela swung out of the ballroom doors as Dean’s eyes drifted closed in preparation for a life-changing kiss, and she said, in the most scandalized voice, “Oh, I didn’t realize the two of you snuck off together. Am I interrupting something?”
“Despite what happened,” Cas says quietly, “he was your son, too. Dean, I knew from the moment I invited you to sleep in my room that I could forgive you for what you said, for the way you treated me. I was still furious; I still wanted to pick a fight. I wanted to hurt you, too. But I knew I was weak for you, that I could forgive you anything.”
“Excuse me?”
“Because
“Give me a sec, and I’ll wipe that down for ya,” she says, then turns to the far end of the bar, snapping her fingers at a drunk asleep in the corner, head rested on his folded arms. “Hey Ash, we actually have customers right now! Can you come do your job?”
“Balthazar…” Cas can’t keep apologizing for trying his best to keep the city safe, and the last time they had this particular fight he’d called Balth a hanger-on and accused him of sticking around just to snatch up the women and the money that flocked to Cas. They hadn’t spoken for nearly three months after the fight, so now Cas keeps his mouth shut.
“Fuck,” he says, and he’s not sure he means to be this honest but he can’t help himself. “I’m really fucking glad to have you back, Cas.”
“Yeah, I bet he hates that.”
Lisa is, predictably, pretty pissed.
Cas comes quietly, bending over to press his forehead into Dean’s chest, breath coming out in huffs Dean feels across his skin as Cas’s come hits his cock and balls.
“No one will be out once that storm hits,” Sam says, closing his laptop. “And I don’t think we should move Cas just yet. Give it a day or two, just so his feet start scabbing over and we don’t have to worry so much about infection.”
“I did,” Dean continues, as if it’s something he has to convince Cas of. “I fucking lost it. And I was terrible to the kid, ‘cause I blamed him. And then you came back and Jack became family and losing him, too, just when I realized how much he meant to me... I just can’t take much more of this shit, you know?”
“Here,” she points at the screen, where a man in a brown leather jacket, toboggan pulled low over his head, is entering the bar. “This guy. I’d never seen him before, but he came in asking for Dean. He was pretty pissed when I said I hadn’t heard from him in a while — like, unreasonably pissed.”
“I know exactly who you are, just like I know who Halo was,” Dagon responds. “I could start dropping names,” and the passengers shift in their seats, wide eyed, “but I like watching you sweat. You’re cute when you’re scared.” Cas scowls. “Do you remember what happened the last time we had you in our care? You were so
After a few agonizing minutes of trying to control his breathing, Dean picks himself up off the floor. He’s afraid to enter the hall, so he doesn’t go to their shared bathroom and wash up or brush his teeth. He takes of his shirt and jeans and gets into bed and pulls the covers up around his ears like that will keep the monsters away.
They sloppily thrust against each other a few times while fully clothed, and Dean can clearly feel Cas’s erection through his sweatpants, which suddenly seem like a huge inconvenience. He sits back on his knees, ignoring Cas’s questioning “Dean?” in favor of looping his fingers under the waistband and tugging slightly, stopping before he gets into dangerous territory.
Sam picks up his phone to call Dean again. Straight to voicemail.
“Yes,” Dean says. “He was there. He…supervised.” Cas sees red, but he carefully keeps his anger in check, holding Dean’s hand tighter. “Look, my mother might still be alive. And my cousin, Gwen, and some others who wanted to escape. If we don’t handle this carefully, he could kill them. I know he wouldn’t hesitate to do it if he felt cornered.”
“Well, you should follow your dreams.”
“Your mother has been through this—”
“Dean,” Sam says for the hundredth time. “This has happened before. He’s going to be fine. You need to relax.”
Dean holds Mary as tightly as she holds him, like if he lets go she’ll vanish the way she has in hundreds of dreams. He wants to tell her
Lisa interrupted Cas and Dean’s early morning conversation, and Cas is trying to forgive her for it. He’s gotten remarkably good at that — forgiving people for intruding on him and Dean — because Sam does it all the time, but this conversation was one he needed an end to, an answer to. Dean’s actions this week, his open jealousy, his general skittishness, have led Cas to believe he wants to be with Lisa again, and Cas is what’s in the way. But every time they’ve approached the subject of Cas helping Dean win Lisa back, they get interrupted.
lead you to Alastair but it
Claire is unimpressed.
Cas knows of the MacLeods. They’re not in his wheelhouse, keeping their game to the other side of the Atlantic — until now. It’s not a good sign they’re sending representatives to Purgatory. Rowena MacLeod is a powerful Corruption user. Cas has heard rumors she can bring people back from the dead, a talent previously associated only with Azazel himself.
Dean’s kisses are urgent, as if he fears they might not do this again. Cas can’t come up for breath, can’t tell him he’d do this with Dean every day if he could. Won’t tell Dean this terrifies him more than the villains he faces on a nightly basis.
“Look at you, being all philosophical,” Dean teases, and Cas rolls his eyes. “Okay, I gotta go. Um—” He hesitates, unsure, but Cas knows what he wants to ask.
Dean turns back to the road and counts in his head, a habit left over from when he was a kid and just starting to hunt. John Winchester would say, "You hear me fire, you stay in hiding for five seconds, come around the back and shoot. Got it boy?' And Dean would nod like
“Right. You don’t remember, it’s not that you don’t
“It’s a terrible habit,” she admitted before lighting up. “But back in the ‘70s and ‘80s it felt like everybody was doing it.”
In one of the pockets his fingers brush against something soft. Confused, he pulls it out.
A bored voice in Dean’s ear distracts him from whatever Krissy says in response. “Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, this is dispatch. How may I help you?”
“Yes, well...” James leans back against the desk and looks at the ground. “It’s for me.”
He hopes the grimace he makes conveys his sentiments adequately.
. Dean wonders if Cas has any idea what he makes them sound like — partners, lovers, a goddamn couple. Things they never were.
Dean paces the floor of their crappy motel room, twisting so hard on a turn that he can feel the rough heel of his boot catch the burnt-orange, ‘70s shag carpet, can hear the slight ripping sound as the fabric gives way.
It drags him in, pulls him close. Right to eye-level with a man’s torso. Cas looks up, dreading what he’ll find.
“No, thank you, you’ve done quite enough.” He hangs up. Cas stares at the burner phone in his hand for a moment, then hurls it at the wall.
. And you’ll fold again, won’t you…” She smiles a sickly smile, and he realizes what she’s about to do. “Mr. N—”
“10-4.” Bobby puts his radio back on his belt, slowing so he and Cas are walking side by side down the thicker part of the trail. “I bet that’s about your boy.”
“Right, so you’re giving me the whole ‘we’re-not-friends’ shtick. Fair enough.”
When Cas gets back to the station, Bobby and Dean are still elbows deep in the old park truck’s engine, covered in grease and sweat. Bobby’s griping at something —
Sam is unmoved.
“Anything that was important to me — school, friends, a normal existence — Dad kept me as apart from it as he could. The only good thing he allowed me to have was Dean, and that was because he needed Dean to watch over me since he was too damn afraid of me to do it himself. When I told him I got into Stanford he told me if I left I could never come back, and he held Dean over my head — ‘If you go, you’re dead to me and your brother,’ that’s what he said to me — and I never forgave him for that, for making that rift between us. Even after he died, even when I miss him, I don’t know if I can forgive him for any of it. The farther away it all gets, the more I wonder why I didn’t see so clearly then that I didn’t need his approval or his affection.”
“JoJo toured with Joe Jonas.”
“It’s fine.” Cas tugs self-consciously at his ratty sleep shirt. “Have a seat.” He gestures to the loveseat and moves to sit next to Dean on the couch. Dean’s still tense, and Cas sets a hand on his knee before remembering himself and pulling away.
They’re sitting silently next to each other on the settee when Ellen finds them.
“Your Red Hood or Red Mask or whatever. In his message to me, he called himself Hellfire. He said he’d rain brimstone down on Purgatory, and he just stole enough weapons to make that a very realistic goal.” For once, Mills’ careful mask of indifference slips. Whatever her feelings on him, they both care about their home. “We can’t let that happen.”
As he turns onto the highway, mind racing faster than his tires can spin, Cas feels something tugging at him like a hook in his heart. He blinks the moisture out of his eyes, touching his breastbone as the feeling intensifies. It calls to him, reaches for him, much like Dean’s longing used to. But this isn’t coming from Dean.
And it is. It is significant. Cas has always been there, from that day he burst into that barn and turned Dean’s worldview upside down till now. Even when Dean was sure he was gone forever, even when Cas showed up late, he’s always come back. To Dean. And Dean has always waited for him.
“Our own school, too?”
while Sam scrambles for the door and opens it to a frantic, flustered Dean. Dean pushes his way into the room, and Eileen says, “Oh. Where’s Cas?” And Dean turns to Sam and Sam knows what happened just by the look on his brother’s face.
“Can you give me a minute?” she asks, and Dean hears the tears in her voice.
“You’re mistaken,” Cas said smoothly. “You saw nothing. And I believe you, Ms. Talbot, are drunk.”
And Dean. For a moment, he’d forgotten. For a moment, all he could think of was Claire. But there’s someone else he cares about on this street, and Cas almost drops to his knees when he enters the bus and finds everyone in it keeled over.
Cas shakes his head.
“Additional footprints?”
Eileen signs in response to his earlier question, and she goes to grab her phone.
“No,” Dean lies. He has no idea if the hit left a bruise across his chin. “I was just worried. I’ve never seen him so mad—” Another lie.
He might be pushing forty now, but he’s still got it. This place he found tonight is cleaner than most — the bartender’s been wiping the counter tops at least, and the bathroom floor only had one suspicious puddle instead of multiple — but the rules for any old dive bar still apply. Dean walks in, he looks around to see who’s looking back, and he sees his target. She’s a brunette in a low cut top and boot cut jeans, nursing what looks like a vodka cranberry at the end of the bar. Her eyes rove over his body, predatory. He smiles at her, and she smirks back.
It sends a shiver down his spine now, thinking about the unnatural stillness of the figure. How he barely made a sound, how his footsteps fell light and quiet and practiced. Cas knows the mark of an expert woodsman, and he knows one followed him for a full day, stalking him along Lovers’ Lane, waiting for him to settle in for the night before moving in. He just doesn’t know what the man planned to do when he caught up to Cas. And it frightens him.
“And a bunch of inherited money. Don’t forget that part: a pretty face and unearned billions.”
Then he sees the circle is broken.
“Shield,” she says as the other Demons open the door and let him on the bus. “I never thought I’d see you again.”
“They don’t know you, either,” Cas gently reminds him. “Everyone is in a very strange position here. They do love you, though. I can tell.”
10:14 a.m.
He collapses against the wall, sliding down to the tile, his head between his knees. He hasn’t even thanked the kid for saving his life. Cas would be so pissed at him. Pissed at his cruelty toward Jack, at his wallowing, at his dogged attempt to burn himself to a crisp just to feel something other than despair.
“You couldn’t have possibly known. Humans can’t sense me in my invisible form.”
of you.” He looks pointedly at Cas. “There won’t be anything left of you by the time I’m through.”
“Fuck!” Dean curses and Cas concurs, using the door frame to leverage his weight as he pulls them both upright.
He turns to face her slowly. Her eyebrows are raised, clearly waiting for a response.
“Well, at the very least I just hope you and Cas are doing okay.”
Claire stands from the couch to tell a story about Sam teaching her, then an 18-year-old, how to scam credit cards for her birthday. When she mentions that Dean gave her a gun that same day, Cas’s stomach drops a bit. Most of these stories are about Sam, but for the older crowd Sam is inextricably tied to Dean.
And that’s when he sees the light again.
. Cas was never going to kiss him, never going to follow Dean to his room in the dark. They’d never fall into bed together, never wake up next to each other. Cas thought it was shameful, he thought it was unwise. Cas towered above him — super intelligent professor with a small family fortune beats low-paid detective with a shitty apartment — but at that moment Dean knew how unlikely their friendship was. How it would never go any further.
They’ve reached the edge of the water. It laps into the cave, spilling over their boots. Claire pauses before stepping in.
The camera pans over to Dale, who says grimly, “Thank you, Monica. Well, you heard her, folks. This storm is a doozy. Stay inside, stay alive.”
Cas carefully closes the book, and Dean tries not to be hurt by the way he immediately puts it in his bag, like it’s something he has to hide.
“Hey,” he says, and Cas glances up at him. “Nothing is going to happen to you. Not with me around.”
He glances behind him. Dean is slumped on the living room couch, wordlessly staring at the unopened box on his lap. Bobby’s standing in the doorway to the kitchen, frowning at them. “I’ll be in in a minute,” Cas tells them, but Dean doesn’t look up. He closes the front door and the screen and takes a seat on the step. After a moment’s hesitation, Leahy sits next to him.
“Nah.” Dean watches Cas over the open bar as he rummages through his cabinets for his stupid teal blue teakettle. Cas has a Keurig, and yet he insists on making his tea the old fashioned way. “He would have snatched you up by now if he could. I think he’s drawn to that area— the highway and the woods.”
“Shut up,” Dean snaps, the first thing he’s said since he greeted Alastair, kicking the Demon’s arm and sending him falling onto his face. Cas steps forward, torn between joining in and staying back to see what Dean will do now that he has his tormentor trapped in front of him.
“The thing is,” Dean continues, “I’ve thought a lot about it the past couple of days, and I can forgive you for that if Cas can. And he has. Hell, I even kind of get it — you don’t know him, not really, and the Brits are real big on convincing everyone that everything inhuman is a monster. Doesn’t make it right, but you were running with them for a while. It makes sense you’d buy their theory, makes sense you’d want to protect Sam and me from a threat.”
“Make it dinner,” Dean says. “I already have a lunch meeting. Eight?”
Samuel’s mouth twitches into a frown. “It’s about time you learned your place.”
“What if they’re true,” Cas says quietly, more a statement than a question. “The myths. What if they’re true?”
It looks different this time, more of a beam than a line, widening as it spreads across the bridge at the far end of the valley. It winks out of existence before it appears again, this time on the other side of the bridge.
“Nah, take it back in. Let me call the Sheriff and see if we can’t arrange a ride out to river after lunch.”
“Dean.” Cas’s voice breaks him from his thoughts. “You told me once that staring at people while they sleep is creepy.”
“Of course,” Cas repeats after Dean, and nods like yes, he just wanted to confirm it. “We’re... brothers.”
Movement in the darkest corner of the room catches his eye.
“Okaaaay,” Cas says finally, and that dragged out, sarcastic response is clearly something he learned from his two terrible human influences. “So, what’s the plan? Head straight to the prison to talk to Quinton Jeffords, put the fear of God in this perp?”
Dean swipes the whiskey off the table and starts drinking straight from the bottle.
“I won’t,” she says solemnly.
Cas looks wide-eyed and thoughtful as Dean pulls away and goes back to his pie. “I guess I never thought of it that way,” he admits, watching as Dean scoops the filling into the tin. “You know, if they adopted me then they adopted you, too. Bobby for sure.”
Should you wish to share this story (which I would really appreciate), reblog
“I promise I wouldn’t slack off, Pa—”
“No, that’s okay,” Sam scoots a little bit closer, noting how Cas eyes him warily. “I want to help.”
“Well, we’re not gonna see her again so it doesn’t matter,” Dean repeats, like saying it often enough might make it true. “Just wanted to be sure you were okay with it, ‘cause you looked kind of panicked when you saw her. You did wipe their memories and all.”
“I know who the Winchesters are.” Her dark eyes narrow even more, something Dean previously would have thought impossible. “Wait here.”
She feels full.
kill him.
Mary watches Ellen Weatherby closely, arm wrapped tightly around the older woman. She found Ellen in a field after following a trail of bodies. Luckily she was able to exorcise the demon inside her without further bloodshed, but Ellen's clearly shell-shocked, shaking and breathing heavily. She saw and heard everything — the screams of the people murdered by her hands, the terror brought on by her black eyes, the hateful words the demon spit at her husband.
Most adult versions of the holiday he spent with Dean, drinking spiked eggnog and not mentioning that that particular tradition started the Christmas right before Dean died and went to hell.
Slowly he pries Dean’s hands from his ears, resisting the urge to wipe the blood off his upper lip. “Can you hear me?” Cas asks, and Dean nods, yells, “It’s muffled!” Cas looks up. The other passengers, realizing the noise is gone, are starting to move their curled hands away from their ears, nervously looking around the bus. Cas realizes the Demons are moving, too.
“I am sorry, Dean,” he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s... worried about you.” Jack looks over the drinks, tilting his head in confusion. Dean swallows hard. “I can feel it.”
“Always wondered what you’d feel like,” Dean says, and his voice is breathier than it’s ever been.
“I could ask you the same thing.”
She pulls him in, and he can only resist so much. He lets his head fall onto her shoulder and lets his sister shield him. It’s a shock to feel Balthazar’s hand come to rest on top of his head, but Cas doesn’t move. He’s exhausted and furious and confused, and he wishes he could just go to sleep and forget all of this. They surround him the way they used to when the three of them fought crime together, a couple of kids against the world. He wishes they could go back.
And for once, he means it.
“Cas!” Dean shouts, because Cas is staring, transfixed. Dean doesn’t have time to wonder what he hears, or what he sees — to ask if he can see the night person through the glow — because Cas’s hand is on the door handle. Dean yanks him down and into the floorboard.
It takes a long time to refill a grave alone.
of all people was husband material?
“I should get back to the house,” he says. It’s a poor excuse, but Sam nods.
“Dean,” Cas says, and Dean prepares for the lecture, the inevitable
“Who?”
He smiles up at Dean, glad to be rewarded with an answering grin.
Dean seems desperate for Cas to understand, and Cas, as always, wants to give him what he needs.
He tries to control his rage. “Same here. It’s Halo now, by the way.”
When Dagon holds up her hands to strike back, Cas’s eyes should be locked on his opponent. Instead they slide to Dean.
Dean shuts the radio off.
Cas won’t stand in his way. He nods to Dean.
he is, if not where or when or why.
Cas nods, then sighs heavily.
“How long do you think he’s been doing this under our noses?”
Tanner pauses as the radio on his belt starts buzzing and the room is filled with the low voice of a dispatcher.
“I don’t know if he’s here.” The kid, who looks not a day over eighteen and must be an intern, hesitantly gestures toward the stairway at the back of the room. “I can take you up to Mr. Turner’s office if you’d like?”
Dean rubs his eyes wearily.
Sam closes his eyes, thinking back. Three years ago, right before he finally got the balls to call Eileen and ask her out, right after God and Amara fought it and out and decided to leave the planet together — what were he and Dean hunting then?
“Uh,” he says, “as soon as possible, I suppose?”
Sam answers on the third ring.
“Like Dick Roman himself.” Mills holds his gaze steadily, appraising. “Why haven’t you moved against Roman?”
Dean gently moves Cas’s hand away from his forearm. It isn’t in Cas’s imagination — the Mark is less red now. It’s taken on the pinkish-white hue of an old scar. He traces the edge of it with a finger, and Dean shivers.
“He could hurt them just as easily if we make a wrong move here.” Cas nods, listening. “I don’t know if I can trust her, but I trust you.” Dean shifts sideways in his seat to face Cas. “What do you think?”
Cas feels warmer with Dean’s steady gaze on him, feels sturdier and stronger. Like he can do anything. Tell the truth, fall in love, perhaps even walk away from the mask. His secret keeper. He never imagined he’d find someone he could trust this much. Cas says, “I told her. I know I’m safe with you.”
No. He’s not going to let his brain or his dick go there. He shoves his face further into the pillow. At least the total darkness seems to ease his migraine.
“Ugh,” Cas responds, hoping there’s more where that coffee came from.
Dean thinks he maybe has lube and a condom somewhere in his duffle, wants to take this a step further, so he leans back, smiling when Cas tries to chase his mouth.
The paper covers a small velvet pouch. Sam feels it, notes something hard inside of it. Something about the weight of the object seems familiar. He looks at Cas, who nervously upturns one end of his mouth in a very slight smile. Sam reaches into the pouch to pull out whatever is inside.
“You can’t do anything,” he says, voice flat. He’s so wrung out he can’t even manage the horror he should feel at her promise of protection. Dean would never allow anyone to stand between him and his father, but right now he can’t imagine anyone even bothering to try. Samuel rules all. “So forget it.”
“I can protect you,” Cas tells him, one hand moving of its own accord to Dean’s back, rubbing up and down in a soothing motion. “Leahy and Jody and Bobby, they’d all protect you if you’d only let them.”
Sam and Eileen are in the middle of what looks like an argument, using only their hands to communicate. Their movements are abrupt, jerky; their faces angry. Dean tries to follow along, but he’s just not quick enough. Eileen pushes back her chair from the table and dumps her still full bowl of cereal in the sink before Dean can ask what’s wrong. The brothers watch her storm to the bedroom she and Sam are sharing, slamming the door. Sam sighs.
He’s too shy to make his move while they’re playing, so Dean waits until after all the adults have finished dinner, and then he goes to sit next to the girl by the fire.
“Not fucking likely,” Cas growls under his breath.
”What the fuck are you talking about?” Dean cocks the gun, his face screwed up in anger and pain and fear and all his other messy, human emotions, and Cas just wants to hold him. He wishes he could spare Dean all that comes after this.
Cas blinks. He vaguely recalls telling Dean once that his plans were a surprise for him. He thought at the time that surely Dean would feel excited when he realized that all the dangers of the ritual had passed, when Cas stood before him human and home to stay forever. It seems he miscalculated, though he’s not sure how.
“...I know she showed you Mom. I know that had to hurt.”
“He lied to us about his name.”
“Is that true?” Steve asks Dean, and there’s a crack in his calm, a barely controlled rage. Dean can hardly nod.
“Alright.” Cas kneels in the dirt and sets the rod in front of him. He’ll use it last, lest he waste its power. Hands of God are one-shot weapons.
He looks over Cas for the hundredth time, checking to make sure he doesn’t bleed through the gauze or wake up and pull out the IV that’s now providing a saline drip of pain meds. Cas continues to sleep silently — no snoring, no tossing or turning. Dean worries that he might be brain damaged from the helmet, though Andrew said he woke up twice and blearily interacted with him while he finished his bandages. Dean wishes he were in the room, then, to make sure Cas knew with certainty that he’s safe. No one will hurt him here. Dean won’t allow it.
So Eileen explains how Mary contacted her under the pretense of needing help on a case. Turns out she’s still in Kansas, puttering around Topeka and taking on minor cases. She told Eileen she’s not working for the British Men of Letter anymore. “Never again,” Mary said. “They hurt my family.”
“If I’m doing it, it has to be today,” Cas interrupts, nearly snapping at her. “And I won’t have a breakdown, Ann Marie, Jesus. I’m fine. I can handle this.”
“Okay,” Dean says, putting the Volvo into park. “We can’t just drive in, guns blazing, because we’ve only got one gun. We can’t sneak in because you can’t walk that far, and we can’t just waltz up because they’ll kill us both.” He sighs. This really seemed like a good idea — no, never a
Cas rolls his eyes. “I don’t know how we didn’t hear him on those crutches.”
“No.” Dean shakes his head. “No, you didn’t see him up against the other angels. They knew him, and they hated him.” Suddenly Dean recalls what one of the angels said,
“Like that’s a bad thing, that someone cares about your kid?” Dean snaps back, combative.
Adam Milligan, the brother who knows the least about Dean, says, “You don’t really go a day without thinking about him. I didn’t find out what happened to him until I was in middle school — after Dad told me about Sam, he told me I had another brother, but that he was gone. When I was 13, he gave me the full story. Ever since, it’s always been on my mind. You see a kid about his age, and you think, ‘Where is he?’ I can’t even imagine how much worse that must be for Dad and Sam and Mary.”
“Then I’m afraid I can’t help you,” Cas says, but his mind is on the raid. If he finds evidence of Roman’s arms shipments, should he have Anna leak it to Dean, have him do some of the dirty work? He puts on his coat, undecided.
“Cas!” Dean snaps, and Cas blinks back to reality.
“Jeez.” Dean pauses the arc of his light when he spots the broken, twisted floorboards right next to the old steel water wheel. “That must be where Brock went through.”
“I guess I gave her the wrong impression.”
“What?” He pokes Cas in the stomach, and Cas reluctantly sits back, letting his legs fall from Dean’s.
Instead Dean just shakes his head slowly, then drops his face into his hands.
“I might,” Mills says in a tone of voice that makes it clear she’s not to be messed with. “Why the hell are you all hiding back here, Lieutenant?”
He doesn’t even know how the sentence ends.
One corner of Samuel’s lips ticks up in what’s almost a smile. “Ruthless strategy, to go after your opponent’s weak side.”
“Cas,” Dean says, and his voice is rough. “I need you to stand aside.”
Dean’s stayed up, feeling sort of like an annoyed parent in a sitcom, eyes on the kitchen clock, Cas and Sam’s food cooling on the table. Next he'll be calling them, saying "You better get home right now young man" or some other crap like that.
After the initial panic, the kid is honestly taking the news of the supernatural world remarkably well. Damn if the Braedens aren’t hardy people.
Michael grunts and shakes his arm away from Cas’s grasp. He can already tell this is going to be a long night, just by the tension in his husband’s shoulders. Cas sighs, following Michael to the car. He did mean what he said — the kids will be fine, and they’ll be back before they wake.
This time the blast is deafening. Blue light streams from Hod’s gaping mouth and eyes, then the
And Dean realizes like a bolt of lighting straight to the head that once again he has completely missed the mark when it comes to Cas and what his motivations actually are.
him before?”
“What the fuck are you talking about,” Sam and Dean say, almost at the same time.
Mama gives him a tiny smile. It doesn’t reach her eyes. “Not really,” she admits. “But there’s nothing you can do, Dean. So just listen to me for a second.”
“I wasn’t supposed to hang out in town, but I snuck away a few times to be with her. Met her kid and everything.” He smiles, fond and sad. “Ben. He’s a cool little guy.” The smile falls. “We’d been hooking up for a few months when she told me she got a job in Indiana. She’d accepted Ben’s dad was never coming back, and they were gonna move. She asked me to come with her, said we could get married, run away together. Make a family.”
“Fine.” Cas drags his eyes away from Dean to respond to Sam. “I’ll be in touch.” Then he sweeps out of the kitchen with a light
Samuel introduces the entire camp to Asa Fox’s children at breakfast the next day. They’re twins, no more than toddlers. The little girl smiles at everyone, but the little boy hides behind his father and doesn’t speak.
“Table for one, please.”
He seems so improved, and just two days removed from near death his happiness is a miracle. Cas hates to dash it, but Leahy gave him a set of questions to ask. He promised her he’d try to get some answers from Dean as thanks for her letting him continue to help with the case. Cas touches the phone in his jacket pocket, the text with Leahy’s instructions heavy on his mind. Dean notices his face fall, and his smile drops.
“Yeah,” the man says, voice flat. “I’m James Novak.”
Dean takes one last look at Richie’s desperate, wide eyes, and he turns and bolts through the back door to the armory, running on heavy feet to the edge of the tree line. He ducks into the brush just as Samuel bursts into view around the corner of the bunk next to the armory, face red with rage. Dean’s heart crawls into his throat at the sight of his father, veins popping in his forehead as he yells for Richie again. Dean ducks back behind a copse
They’re able to drive right up to the farmhouse at The Bend. There’s no one there. The cars are all gone, no sign of people anywhere — not at the one-pump gas station, not at the bunkhouse.
Dean is gone.
Dean ducks his head down, and Cas instantly feels guilty. “I’m sorry,” he mumbles. “I was trying to decide whether to ask you for help. Then you went for the gun, and I panicked.”
“There are a few other boys, too. And a girl, I think.” Papa pulls the map closer to his side of the table, beaming as he traces their route to these far away mountains. Dean resumes eating his cereal. “And a couple of adults to help us build houses. We’ll make our own town.”
, or else why would the flood spit him out here?
“It’s weird,” Sam says. “As a kid I wanted to know more about him, but when I watched that video for the first time as a teenager, I cried for two hours straight. I realized that I didn’t know what his voice sounded like until that point. It was like knowing what he sounded like, what he moved like, made it harder.”
It doesn’t fit how Cas feels. It’s too small.
“I thought I could do this, but —” Cas starts, then abruptly stops. “Thank you for helping me with the pills,” he says stiffly. “You can leave now. I can change the bandages myself, later.”
“Cas —” His protest drowns on his tongue as the grace in his chest unfurls, awake again and taking control. Dean rails against it, the impossibility of it — he cast Michael out, Michael cannot be here, this cannot be happening....
Mary looks at Sam, but he’s watching his brother carefully.
“Since I yelled at Dean, you’re here,” Cas says, surprisingly wry, and then he sighs. “You can come closer. I won’t bite.”
Before Cas can lose his temper again, Anna loses hers. “Shut up, Balthazar! What is wrong with you?”
“Yes,” Cas says, uneasy. “You were with me when we saw the interview he did with Mick Davies. I thought you knew.”
The gift wasn’t anything he had to buy. He found it in the bunker, in Dean’s closet. Sam saw it, and he knew immediately — this is for Cas.
“Wrong.” Dagon shakes a finger at him. “The
The drive back seems to take hours; the terse silence in the car seems impenetrable. Cas feels so tightly wound he’s sure the slightest noise would send him jumping in his seat, and Dean’s back to leaning against the car window, eyes shut tight. Cas doubts he’s sleeping. He wishes he could take the pain away, but he can’t. He keeps making it worse.
“Sam called me.” Her eyes are sad, full of pity. “He told me about Castiel. Oh, Dean...”
“Dean Winchester.” Her voice is warm, with a hint of a reproach underneath. “It’s been a long time.”
That night in his bedroom, Dean takes his shirt off and admires the amulet. It’s truly an uncanny replica of the one the blonde woman gives him in his dreams, right down to the little horns. He can’t believe Gwen found it.
“For real, Dean?” Sam asks. Dean hears rather than sees the bitch face. “We decapitate monsters for a living.” He doesn’t deign to respond.
“I just don’t want you to spend this whole case unfocused.”
Dean knocks his boot against the side of the hull, a nervous fidget. “It’s not like I knew who you were.”
“He doesn’t want to be found.” Dean pushes past Sam to get to the hall. He just needs to get away, to not think about Cas and the wreckage of his life for four fucking seconds, and he can’t do that with Sam around. “He chose this, so leave it.”
“There’s a letter inside,” she says, gesturing to the envelope. Her face screws up, and she takes a deep breath before speaking again. “It will tell you what you need to know. You’re old enough now to decide for yourself what kind of life you want.”
“You were
“We offer grace and God’s power.” He takes the rod and presses it into the ground next to the blade, feeling the rush of energy as the weapon comes to life and the dirt around them begins to float. Particles hover in the air as if blasted back by an explosion, and the earth beneath his knees shakes and groans. Crowley steps back, still chanting but wide-eyed as Cas’s grace surges between the blade and the rod, darting back and forth, creating a crack in the fabric of the universe.
He registers Cas following him, but he refuses to turn around, keeping his eyes on the light. There’s a car coming down the hill at the other end of the valley, and it seems urgent Dean reach the light before it does. He jogs, gun drawn and held down and to the side, years of training kicking in.
Dean picks his phone up and opens it. “A text message from Leahy. She says, ‘The video footage from the bar is too blurry to use for ID.’” Dean looks up at Cas. “This is about what you found at the Roadhouse, isn’t it?” He sounds resigned.
or I shoot you in the face.”
This is spiraling out of control, and it strikes Cas he may have just colossally fucked up. He keeps trying to do right by Dean, and
“Yeah, maybe. Or maybe you’re looking for them in the wrong place.” After a few seconds pause she adds, “You do have to be sorry for getting Cas to make us forget you, though. I’m still pissed.”
“That’s disappointing. And disgusting,” Dean says, as easily as if Cas was the only one in the room. Cas smiles at him, soft and small.
Dean clears his throat, and Cas jerks back from looking at Lisa, red-faced. He doesn’t want to give anyone the wrong idea.
He says that last part quietly, with a hint of disbelief. Dean knows Sam hates having a problem he can’t solve placed in front of him, and this seems beyond both of them. The only one who knows anything is Cas, and he’s shut them out — literally.
“I keep my promises, Feathers.” Crowley walks over to stand in Cas’s line of sight, raising his eyebrows. “Unlike certain angels who shall not be named.”
“You didn’t know?”
“Do you both restore cars?” Dean asks, trying to pick up the thread of conversation Bobby had going earlier. It feels like cheating, but at least trying to talk about cars won’t make him choke on his own words.
“No, Cas, it was you.” Dean pushes Cas’s finger down, pressing it into the raised skin. “It was during one of your stupid three-on-one spars. I complained about having to fight against all three of you again, and Anna made you switch places with me so I could be on the Angels’ team for once. You always listened to her.”
And he’s kept the weight on, kept the protective armor up when Cas came back looking for forgiveness. But Cas said what might as well be an “I love you” and Dean thought he lost him again, pushed him away, and it scared him — but he didn’t. Knowing Cas means business about making things right between them, willing to work to build trust up even when Dean is stubborn or rude or standoffish, well... It causes a feeling dangerously close to hope to nestle into Dean’s chest, right next to his heart.
The sounds of the woods come back in full force and a light shines from behind him. He runs for the pasture, scrambling out of the trees and climbing hastily over the fence, snagging his jacket and ripping a chunk out as he heads for the nearest building, an abandoned wooden barn tilting heavily to one side in the middle of the pasture. The light calls behind him, booming and insistent, and Dean does not look back.
He’ll have to ask her someday. Someday, they need to talk about their father and their upbringing, Halo and Shurley Enterprises, Dean and Alastair. Just— Not today. He has a flight to catch.
“Dean, he said he’s going to tell you; it’s not my place...”
Cas leans forward in his seat, eyes on the light as it nears them. The hum grows louder. “Cas! Fucking —”
“We’ll get him back.” Sam twists his hands together. “We just have to come up with another option.”
All described as ‘rough looking’ or ‘sketchy.’ They would stop by the grocers or the feed store, and the pawnshop guy knew them, too. Bought a lot of ammunition. Always paid cash everywhere.”
“A case,” Cas says, in almost a whisper. “There was a case, and you didn’t think I was ready to go. When you came back, Sam told me to leave. You wouldn’t speak to me at all.”
Jeffords told Sam they weren’t alone.
in his own damn head.
And Cas wasn’t there for him then.
. “Let Sam do the talking. But you’re not cutting me out of the room if he lets us in to see Claire’s dad. I want... I need to be in on that.”
,” Cas snaps, and Dean says, “You didn’t even tell
Jody snorts a laugh. “They’re more likely to be furry orgies today. This isn’t the ‘80s.”
this all along. The one person who knows Dean better than anyone, who therefore knows what Samuel’s done behind closed doors, is now not speaking to him. Not protecting him.
“Hold off,” Dean says. “Let’s talk to him first. Just get on the road as fast as you can.”
Together they help pull Ben to his feet, the teenager hopping and wobbling to keep weight off his right side. Cas is closer to Ben’s height, so he lets the boy loop an arm around his shoulder for support.
“You melted plastic into the plate,” Dean mumbles, relieved he can still speak and even more relieved to walk forward to meet Cas. “It’s working fine now.”
Dean narrows his eyes, confused.
“Do you have a child, Cas?” she asks before he can work out a response. She must see something in his face, for her voice wavers, soft and a little unsteady. “I don’t mean to pry, just, I saw your face when I said Ben is embarrassed by me. It looked like you understood.”
Dean should tell the truth here, say what they all already know. That this has nothing to do with Sam or Cas (well, maybe he does worry about both of them near constantly, but he has been better at taking a step back since the whole Darkness-averted-apocalypse-and-now-Mom’s-back thing). He should tell them that this is all about him and this chasm of a long ago, false life he thought he’d buried successfully that is now turning into a sinkhole that’s threatening to swallow him whole. All because he saw his ex-girlfriend for like five seconds at a gas station.
Not that Claire would even be talking to him, not now...
“It’s me, it’s — It’s Dean, hey, hey... I’m here to help you, okay, Cas?” Dean doesn’t know why that nickname, the bastardization of an angelic title, comes to him so much easier than the name James. “It’s gonna hurt when I pick you up, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
“Enlighten me then, Sam.”
Bobby holds out his palms, placating. “Cas, I agree. I’m only saying — I know how you get about this sort of thing.”
“Where is Dean?” Cas demands, pushing up on his elbows. He may be in no shape to walk out of here, but he’ll try his damndest if Anna doesn’t answer his questions
Cas never intended to leave Green Eyes’ side, not from the moment he saw him blink. He leans back in his chair.
The trees have grown back and a suburb sprung up almost overnight around the glen, yet he knows exactly where to go. There’s power there. If it weren’t his he wouldn’t be able to feel it, cut off from Heaven as he is. But it is his. His grace has marked this place.
“I can’t keep doing this every night.” Sitting on the edge of his bed, head buried in his hands, voice so low Sam could barely hear it from the doorway. “Please, just — please.”
Cas hums in agreement while he gently wraps the feather in the trench coat at the top of his bag.
So he does.
“They don’t just go away. But it’s okay. I know now, so please, just let me help however I can. Even if all I can give you is a stupid good luck feather. And sex. Sex could be the cure for everything, now that I think about it.”
It’s a lie, one Turner doesn’t seem to buy. The older man’s lips press together, considering. He seems to decide Dean can fend for himself against the big, bad billionaire, shaking his head as he says, “Smith is a freelancer. He doesn’t do office work. You want to find him, he’s probably at the Purgatory Public Library.” He narrows his eyes at Cas, unimpressed. “You know where that is?”
“You know,” she says, and her voice is lighter, teasing, “when you finally retire, I’m sure Dean Smith will be willing to entertain you.”
reporter who happened to also be at the ball is more like it.”
“If we want to conduct surveillance on private property, it’s the only way,” he says. “I need to find out who actually owns this land.” He taps the map. “Then we’ll ask for the warrant and get a team in place to survey our suspects.”
“Erosion line?” Cas asks, smearing mustard across his bread.
Dean pushes off the side of the bulldozer, pacing in front of the kids. Josephine keeps talking.
“Keep it.” Leahy gives him a tight smile. “If you show it to him, he might recognize we’re making at least a little headway.”
He tore up the list he made of the songs he wanted to include on her tape, and he tossed the little pieces of paper out of the window as he drove out of town.
“I’ll bring you more water,” he says quietly. “Then Dean or I can help you with your bandages after lunch. We don’t have to talk to you, not if you don’t want. But you do need help.”
Dean knows he should be on board with that plan, but the thought of driving across the state in one go when he’s already so exhausted by this mess with Cas and Lisa makes him push back.
“I’m going to do it,” he says. “Of course I’m going to do it. I can’t leave him there.”
Dean thinks of Mary Winchester’s sad eyes, so much like her own mother’s. “What if the Winchesters push for a... a trial?”
And it feels like home, sliding into Cas, as cheesy as that is and as much as Dean would hate to say it out loud. Cas is tight around his dick and moaning in his ear, and every time Dean rocks in and out of him he makes these beautiful huffing noises, soft and awed.
Sam keeps up an extraordinarily high level of energy as they work, stripping the warped shingles from Cas’s roof and patching up the spot where the water damage has rotted through the wood underneath. He talks about everything and nothing — his store, South Bend, the weather. It’s comforting, like a radio playing one of Dean’s mixtapes in the background. Of course, once he thinks that, Cas thinks Dean would most likely be annoyed by Sam’s constant chatter, and his mood sours a little. Sam doesn’t seem to notice.
