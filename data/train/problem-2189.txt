“Seb!” John chided.
“Wait, hang on,” John protested before they could move much further.
John sat down and thought about what he was going to say while he was waiting. Talking about this sort of thing was definitely not his strong suit, which was part of why he loved being with Sherlock; the man could always just deduce what he was feeling. But not this time, apparently, and now John had to figure out how to explain why the past few weeks had been more than a bit not good.
“Is that understood?” John tightened his grip.
Sherlock hid his smile as he scribbled a few notes on the case file.
“The door’s locked!”
“I could’ve guessed that,” Sherlock snapped instinctively as his eyes roamed around John’s face. How had he not noticed how tired and sunken in John’s eyes looked? Had he been this pale when they’d first come outside? “What is it? What’s the matter?” he asked.
John pursed his lips and fiddled absently with the garment in his hands.
“Well, that’s…good. Yes.”
“How much of me can you see right now?”
“I love you,” he murmured, feeling his eyelids becoming heavy.
“Mm,” Sherlock grunted, peering into a microscope.
“They didn’t approve, I take it.”
^^^^^
“No worries. Take all the time you need. I know I’m gonna need time to think up something new to yell at Sherlock.”
John gingerly touched a hand to the side of his head, and winced when he realized that it was blood and not melted snow that was making his hair wet. His ribs felt bruised as opposed to broken, so he took that as a good sign, but any hope of standing up was lost when he tried to move his left leg.
“Yeah, I can see you. I can see you.”
“John, I believe it's becoming quite clear to you now, or perhaps I should say
“I could hear you overthinking from out here. You deserve to relax, John.”
“Listen, um, I know you said this sort of stuff isn’t really your area, but I was wondering if you’d maybe like to go get a coffee sometime. As a…as a date.”
It took a few attempts of wriggling the rusted door handle before Sherlock practically plowed the door open in his haste.
John cried out in pain, and hoped like hell that Sherlock would stop running long enough to realize what had happened.
All day long, John had been asleep, and Sherlock had been bored, bored, bored. Didn’t John know how Sherlock hated to be bored?
“No, I want to.” He took a deep, steadying breath and picked his chin up. “What I’m trying to say is that I, er, I like blokes, as well. Though I also like women, so I guess that makes me bisexual. I mean, I
Sherlock was still staring with his mouth wide open and John tucked his gun away in the back of his jeans. It took a moment to register that the shorter man was staring at him.
“Hah, yeah. I mean it, though, Greg. I don’t think anyone’s helped me through one like that before.”
John dragged his hands over his face and sighed. “Fine, maybe I do like that we’re getting away for a bit, but do you think you could’ve found a different way of letting me know the plan?”
The time seemed to fly by, and before John knew it, he was back at the library with Sherlock, reluctantly revising for exams.
“What?”
John was running as fast as his legs could carry him, but despite his best efforts, the image of Sherlock’s long billowing coat began to fade as Sherlock got farther and farther away.
-------------
“Oh, well, I didn’t know he—“
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” the doctor finally said, drawing out the word as if he were contemplating its meaning, “you seem to already have quite the understanding of your diagnosis.” He stated, pushing his ever-drooping glasses up further on his nose.
“Huh, so you admit to being a peeping Tom,” Sherlock muttered.
John just shut the drawer and went back to his task. He came back into the sitting room a few moments later with a small plate and sat down in the opposite armchair.
“Your therapist?”
“You okay?” John asked. Sherlock had chosen not to drink at all, the memory of the last time he’d had too much still fresh in his mind.
“No time for that, John. We’ve got a very important job to do this morning,” Sherlock said.
“Your socks always match. You’re almost obsessive with it, making sure they stay in faithful pairs and folding them neatly in your drawer.”
Sherlock was about to dial Lestrade and shout abuse just for the hell of it, when his phone vibrated with a message.
“Ah, good to hear.”
He grimaced through the pain and opened his eyes fully to take in his surroundings. He was sitting up against a cold, gritty concrete wall with a cold concrete floor to match. The room was small and empty save for years of collective filth gathering in corners and making its way up the walls.
Maybe it
Sherlock entered the dilapidated room with a rush of adrenaline, high on the fact that he was the first on the scene, finally ahead of Anderson. He leaned the thin fluorescent lamp in the corner and flicked it on.
“Perhaps you should call her, then.”
Sherlock stretched his arm out to reach the change of clothes in John’s bag and yanked out a shirt to lay on the ground and rest John’s head on it. John’s brow was furrowed under his sweat-soaked fringe as he mumbled incoherently, and Sherlock could see that his face had gone from pale to a sickly grey colour.
“Two pills,” John stated.
When was Sherlock going to come home?
“It’s fine, John, just rest."
“Thank you,” he said.
John chuckled and got up to move to the sofa, patting Sherlock’s ankle in a silent request for him to move it.
“Thank you,” he said.
“Right. Sorry,” John said.
“Woah, slow down there. What’s going on? Who’s car is that?” John asked as they got out of the cab.
Lestrade backed up a bit, open-mouthed with his hands on his hips. Sherlock leaned John up against the wall and placed his hand over his face, checking quickly for fever, and then moving his fingers to his neck to take his pulse.
“It’s okay John, you’re alright," Sherlock assured.
“Oh, god…” Sherlock breathed as he stepped closer and saw the distinct evidence of John losing his footing. He took a tentative step to the edge, and let out a short gasp as he saw John lying stock still at the bottom of the ravine.
“That you are. C’mon, let’s go to sleep.” John lifted up the covers and let Sherlock wriggle his way under before wrapping his arms around his middle and holding him close. “And I love you too, you absolute idiot.”
After a good forty-five minutes of spotty conversation and barely eaten alfredo pasta, Sherlock saw a black cab slow to a stop in front of the restaurant. His eyes widened, and John looked out the window behind him. They both tried not to stare at the cabbie at the same time.
“I know.”
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed. John could be so stubborn when he wanted to be.
“All set?” John asked.
“What's the matter, Hamish?”
“I didn’t mean—“
“I’m not.”
Biting his bottom lip, Sherlock just barely kept himself from unleashing his response onto John in one rapid-fire sentence. Instead, he closed his eyes and let his thoughts simmer until they formed a cohesive point.
“Who says I'm avoiding you?” he asked, staring intently at the words that he wasn’t reading.
“Yes.”
“She?”
“Let’s hope so.” Greg sighed and turned around, absently eyeing up the people in the stands. “Bloody hell, is that
These fics have not been beta'd or Britpicked, so all mistakes are mine, and comments or suggestions are always welcome! ^^
“Is that right? So standing around like a creep is a hobby of yours?”
“And um, just tea for me, actually,” John said.
John shook his head dismissively. “This is just me having a pity party, okay? It doesn’t matter. I’ll be fine, I just need some sleep.”
Sherlock turned away from John and prodded the fire a bit more. He was silent for a moment before speaking rather softly.
“I’ll make an appointment tomorrow.”
“Of course I’m okay. Why wouldn’t I be okay?”
“I’m with you, how could I be bored?” Sherlock said. That seemed to make John smile.
“What?”
“And won’t you be most disappointed. Sit down, Sherlock,” Mycroft ordered calmly.
“Please, god,” John mumbled, “let me li—“
For a moment, Sherlock looked up at John with wide, red-rimmed eyes full of curiosity, but quickly looked away and stood up, hugging John’s cardigan tighter to his thin frame.
Lestrade just put his hands up in mock surrender and backed up. “So what do you make of all this then, Sherlock?” He asked, getting back the task at hand.
John slowly but surely released his grip and took the bottle from Sherlock, his face relaxing minutely when the warmth seeped through his skin.
John changed into his PJs with a smile, thinking that this evening was exactly what he needed. But his smile soon faded as he thought about the biology exam he had coming up on Monday, and the extra shifts he’d been given at work, and the paper that he’d only written about a third of. There was still so much to do, and he only had so much time to do it.
“Then why push me away like that?”
“How are you feeling?”
“You didn’t phone Mycroft to wish him a happy Christmas?” John asked.
“Yes, congratulations, you’ve found your culprit. Happy?”
“Yeah,” John sighed, staring at his feet. “Sorry ‘bout that. “
“Finally,” John said as he walked out of his bathroom, clad in a fresh set of clothes and scrubbing a damp flannel over his face and hair. “I swear I had dirt
“What are you going to do?” John asked.
“I was not peeping. It's not like the door was locked, or closed for that matter. But I’m just saying, I couldn’t look away because, hell, I’ve never seen you handle anything with such…such—“
-------------
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked, already halfway out of his chair in case John needed help.
“How do I aggressively drink tea?”
John laid his head back on the pillow and sighed, his ribs aching slightly with the action. There were a myriad of questions swirling around in his head, but before he could gather the mental strength to try to remember what had happened, the door to his room swung open and Sherlock strode in, stopping short when he saw John.
“Good, yeah, that’s good,” he rambled. “How about tomorrow at Hudson’s?”
Sherlock was playing for him again. John must have been making some sort of noise that alerted Sherlock to his sleeping troubles, and now he was playing for him to help him get back to sleep.
He opened up his eyes when he heard the telltale thump of a glass being set down on the coffee table.
“You know Mike and Greg, Sherlock. They’re your friends, too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John waited for a reply, nodded sharply to himself when he didn’t get one, and made his way to the kitchenette.
“For you, obviously.”
John let out an exasperated sigh, reminding himself to pick his battles. He went over and helped Sherlock to fit the laptop into the bag by simply moving a few things around. As he was zipping up the bag, he noticed Sherlock’s violin case sitting nearby.
The doctor snorted in laughter. “No, obviously,” he said a bit mockingly, “look, I’m just not feeling well, alright? It’s the start of a bug, I’m sure. I just don’t need your concern. I’m a—“
“And you were high as a kite on excitement, like a child in a toy shop. Bit disturbing, really, you should work on that. Anyway, you must’ve been too excited to notice my shaking. I could barely look at the victim.”
“I was in a fight. How d’you know I didn’t start it?”
John padded over to the small kitchen and rooted around in the fridge in search of a proper dinner, finding nothing but a disappointing amount of empty shelf space.
John shot an apologetic smile to the waiting cabbie and tried not to visibly blush.
“Then why does it feel like I am?”
“You hush,” he said, turning off the light, “I had to break several laws to come in and see you.”
“Most likely to laugh at me,” Sherlock smirked. John smiled a bit as well.
“You’re not broken.”
The inspector chuckled. “Yeah, right.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock watched as the cab driver glanced around, waiting for his passengers. Then he saw the cabbie spot the cane.
“That’s…amazing,” John breathed.
“Just breathe, it’ll be all right,” the man repeated, looking at him with those warm, caring eyes.
“Sherlock, you’re
Mike sat down at the table and shot him a smug smile.
Sherlock groaned and sunk his head deeper into the cushion. “If I’m this bored on day three, I doubt I’ll make it to Christmas without losing my mind entirely.”
? It’s three in the bloody morning!”
“Right.” Sherlock took off his scarf and coat, hanging the two up on the back of the door. He walked slowly over to where John was sitting at the desk by the window and leaned over his shoulder.
Sherlock’s family home was cozy and warm. Sherlock’s mother had tea waiting for them when they arrived, and Sherlock and John gave her the birthday presents they’d picked up for her along the way after John found out that Sherlock hadn’t gotten her anything.
“You and I both know I have less than ordinary sleeping habits.”
Over the course of the next week, Sherlock and John had made their way through three more Bond movies, stopped by the café to give Mrs. Hudson her gifts, and attempted to a play a board game or two, which resulted in John finding out that Sherlock was in fact quite the sore loser. John had also decided to go out and get a gift for Sherlock, which had been something of a challenge to keep him from seeing or deducing.
“What the…hell? Sherlock? What’re you doing?” he asked, panting.
“John? John!” Sherlock shouted while banging repeatedly on the door.
“Yes, and I’m all better now. May I go?”
“Go check on Hamish,” John deflected. Sherlock knew that John loathed to be seen in such a state, but he would have to deal with it for now.
“Come here for a moment, will you?”
“You think she’s got any biscuits, too?” he asked.
Hamish nodded and gave a small smile.
“I can imagine.” Sherlock was still tracing lines over the images, and John imagined him making deductions about each one. “Can I?” he asked.
“Didn’t you want any?” he asked.
went in the shower,” Sherlock said. “And now you won’t look at me.”
“Attempt to survive my family as they bombard me with innumerable invasive questions and mind-numbing chitchat, mostly.”
“That wasn’t your fault.”
John watched Sherlock step in, clad in his tartan dressing gown. John always loved the way that one looked on him.
“Sherlock, I can’t just stop practicing,” he argued. He and Sherlock had been at it for almost twenty minutes now, still not appearing to be any closer to agreeing on anything.
“I’ve already done that.”
John closed his eyes and sighed, feeling a dull ache in his ribs at the movement.
not having to do any work for three weeks?”
“There, all done,” John said, staring up at Sherlock who somehow seemed to be standing even closer.
John stopped Sherlock mid-sentence when he reached out and slowly took the violin from his hands. He carefully placed the instrument onto Sherlock’s chair before turning back to him.
“Hold it,” he ordered. “I’ll give you two minutes. You know you’re only here ‘cause we know this one’ll be like the rest.”
“God, yes.”
“Very funny,” John said, clapping Sherlock playfully on the shoulder.  “But yeah, I know you’re right; I need to just take it easy, I guess. I’m sure I can figure out a way to get things done without driving myself mad.”
“What about Uncle Mycroft?” Hamish asked, tucking himself comfortably in the crook of John’s neck.
“Really?” John smiled bitterly. “Tell that to my leg that gives out on me when I’m too stressed, or my shoulder that I never regained full motion of, or my hand that shakes so badly sometimes I can’t even hold a bloody pen. I love what we do, Sherlock. I love it more than anything and I want to keep doing it as long as possible. That’s why I worry about these things. I don’t want to slow you down or not be able to be with you when you need me.”
“No, I’m coming in. You’re clearly not okay.”
He looked over at Greg driving and knew that he couldn’t tell him. What good would that do? He and Greg had only just started dating and John was not ready for the man to see the ugliest parts of him just yet.
Greg raised his eyebrows. “I’m surprised he came, to be honest.”
“John, no, that’s not fair,” Sherlock protested.
The old cab driver stood stock still in the middle of the dank passageway, clearly out of breath. He held his hands up in front of him in surrender, because at the end of the alley was John, holding a pistol steadily with two hands. John had a stone cold look in his eyes, like if the cabbie were to take one half of a step closer, he’d shoot him without batting an eyelid.
Letting out a breath of bitter cold air, he unlocked the door to his flat with shaking hands and made his way up the steps. Once inside, John immediately took out his phone and fired off a text to Sherlock.
John was running in an attempt to keep up with Sherlock’s impossibly long strides as he chased after their suspect. He thought that by now Sherlock would have known that John simply couldn’t run as fast as he could, but he supposed that once Sherlock had his focus locked down on something, he likely wasn’t thinking of much else.
Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes.
“Too late.”
“Four,” Sherlock drawled.
Sherlock looked half shocked and half confused, which John supposed was better than angry or disgusted. His mouth was hanging open slightly, and for once it seemed that Sherlock Holmes himself was speechless.
“I hate it,” John admitted quietly, almost to himself.
“But you’re not, John,” Sherlock insisted. “You don’t eat enough, and—
“Though I’d like to mention it could be dangerous. I'm a bit of a nutter and yes those
I feel like Janine would definitely have a cute little dog like that and Sherlock would lowkey want to steal him lol. Thanks so much for reading!
“What? What is it?”
Sherlock swallowed and bit his tongue, turning back to the books at the table.
As the evening went on, the friendly warmth wore off, leaving behind the usual discomfort that John felt around his drunken friends and reminding him why he hadn’t hung out with them like this in a while. He really shouldn’t have dragged Sherlock along, he thought.
“I’m sorry.”
“John, I realized—“
John pressed play on the file, already having a hunch as to what it was, and his suspicions were confirmed when the sound of Sherlock playing his violin came through the phone.
“So you’ve said.” Sherlock bit the inside of his cheek and looked out the window. “I’m not sure yet what I want to do. Who knows, I might just invent my own job if nothing appeals to me.”
John sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “I know, but I’d really rather not think about all that stuff right now. Especially after- well, y’know.”
“Oi, I get to pick the dare,” Greg asserted, a smug, bubbly grin on his face. “Okay, alright, I dare you...Right, I dare you to- no no, I dare you—“
John chuckled softly and looked up from the petri dishes to glance around the rest of the room. Out of the corner of his eye he spotted what he assumed was a violin case sticking out from underneath the bed.
“You don’t have to do all that.” John sighed.
“John—“
Back at the cabin, Sherlock was busy finishing up his studies at the table.
John stepped into the café with Sherlock trailing slightly behind him, immediately spotting his friends all huddled in a booth by the window.
“Well, I’m heading up,” John said.
“Look, I don’t want any trouble, alright? I’ve got no money, I swear to you, now please unhand me before I’m forced to make you.” He said, smoothly adopting his curt military tone.
“Of course.”
“Yeah, right.” John chuckled. He fiddled absently with a stray pencil for a moment before looking back to Sherlock, who was already honed in on his screen and typing at breakneck speed. “Is that, um, is that all you needed me for?”
“Mmf,” John mumbled in reply.
“Night. And don't leave the telly on all night, yeah? I can hear you watching children’s programmes from the bedroom.”
John’s head shot up to look at him. He was standing by the fireplace with his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes soft with understanding.
But Sherlock only grinned.
Sherlock smiled back.
John worried that by the time Sherlock realized something was wrong it’d be too late. He worried about hypothermia. He worried about the pain in his leg. He worried about the cut on his head. He worried until he lost consciousness completely.
“You think it’s getting long again? I can still see past my fringe, so it’s not—“
John smiled down at his phone and thought maybe the next hour of this presentation wouldn’t be so dull after all.
“All right, thank you, Dr. Sherlock.” John rolled his eyes. Sherlock was glad to hear John’s familiar sarcastic tone return, as opposed to his frighteningly weak voice back at the pitch.
It was a few hours later, and John had finally finished his book, which he had almost been dreading seeing as he had no idea what to do to entertain himself afterward.
John chuckled, and Sherlock seemed almost surprised at the sound.
But this, John thought, this melody was soft. Soothing. A drifting, lilting, subtle sound that flowed effortlessly through the air and into John’s ears. Perhaps Sherlock had made a breakthrough in the case and was celebrating, or perhaps he was simply playing to help him think, as he was wont to do.
“Of course. I’ll need Lestrade’s help, unfortunately, but we’ll nab him, don’t worry John.”
“Go ‘way, Sherlock,” John grumbled, burying his face in his pillow.
-------------
The next morning, Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure what to do. He had been almost certain he was going to be spending most of the day trying to get John to tell his whole story without panicking or forgetting bits. He didn’t quite expect to have all the answers by daybreak. With this in mind, he allowed himself to lie in bed for a while, and actually managed to get in a few hours of sleep.
“And all that to you, too,” John quipped. “Oh! Before I forget,” he said, rushing back to his bedroom.
“What for?”
“You know how this works, John. Close your eyes,” Sherlock said quietly, dusting his fingers over John’s eyelids to encourage them to close that last little bit.
a maniac,” John told Sherlock as he stared at the jar of human eyeballs staring back at him.
“Molly?” Sherlock asked.
John steeled himself in his chair. He
“I’m only saying that it’s statistically unlikely that you would remember exactly one hundred percent of the information needed for the exam.”
“Right. Can I borrow your phone? Mine’s just died.” Sherlock said, frowning at his useless mobile.
“It’s getting rather late, John,” he said, clasping his hands behind his back.
“Comes with the territory, I guess.” John shrugged. He tossed the flannel carelessly onto the worktop in the kitchen before padding into the sitting room. “Budge over,” he said as he sat down next to Sherlock and scooted his way in front of the table.
John had been looking at the menu since he and Sherlock had sat down at their table. He’d gone from narrowing his eyes at the words in an attempt to read them, to holding the paper away from his face to make things clearer and right back to squinting again. Now he held a finger to his mouth as he continued to squint down at the words, clearly still struggling to make them out.
Sherlock knelt down in front of him, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder and trying not to let the slight panic in his chest show on his face.
John rather than with him.
The look of realization that dawned on John’s face couldn’t do anything but make Sherlock smile. The detective insisted that he knew the limp was all in John’s head, and the doctor just laughed and sat in his armchair. Sherlock smiled at that too, seeing the shorter man’s hazel eyes light up as he rolled his head back in amusement. John Watson didn’t look like he wanted to leave any time soon, and Sherlock wasn’t sure he minded.
Sherlock described the cab driver that’d taken John. He was somehow positive that someone ought to know of him, insisting that he wasn’t stalling because he didn’t feel up to dealing with the police. To Sherlock, and John’s surprise, their cab driver made a face of realization and smiled.
“I think I’ve taken a liking to it, actually. Keeps me busy,” he said. “Earl Grey or English Breakfast?”
now, thank you.”
“John! Wake up!”
“Watson!” someone called from behind John.
The waiting room in the therapist’s office, with its monochrome colour scheme, fake plants and sad paintings, was beginning to hash up old memories for John. He sat stiffly in one of the chairs, across from Sherlock who was most likely pretending to read a magazine but was actually in his mind palace.
They had ordered their food and gone back to John’s flat to eat so that John could change out of his filthy rugby uniform and wash off the dried mud still clinging to his arms and legs.
John tugged his shirt back on and tried to quell the anger and embarrassment bubbling in his chest as he made his way home. He couldn’t believe how fast the night had gone from a friendly round of drinks and some silly games to an absolute mess. He felt horrible for having dragged Sherlock along with him, too. And now he’d just left him with those drunken idiots. John hoped like hell they weren’t giving him a hard time.
Finally the shorter man obliged, and awoke with a gasping breath. He sat up a bit and put a hand to his chest to calm himself.
Sherlock stopped, making a point to loudly stomp his shoes onto the pavement as he turned back to face John.
,” Sherlock squealed, sounding a bit like an impatient toddler.
“You’re…?”
Panic seized him at the sound of the voices, but immediately dissipated when he recognized the unmistakable timbre of Sherlock’s voice, and the ever-exasperated tone of Lestrade’s.
He set his phone down and stupidly waited to see if Sherlock would call right back, but there was nothing. He nodded curtly to himself and figured he may as well eat now, but upon opening up his food, realized he wasn’t quite so hungry anymore.
John smirked and looked back across the table at Sherlock.
After having a quick shower and skipping a shave for the time being, he carefully got dressed in some jeans and a comfy jumper and padded into the kitchen for some breakfast.
“Oh, I’ve angered you,” Sherlock stated. “Not good?”
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back and nodded approvingly. “Surprisingly violent,” he said.
“How can your parents possibly think you’re a disappointment?”
“Sherlock!” Lestrade’s gruff voice echoed through the tattered walls of the abandoned flat.
“John.”
John frowned at the image of himself that greeted him in the mirror of the bathroom. It was a sad, tired reflection, which was why John loathed mirrors; they could never lie. The bags under his eyes seemed to get more pronounced every day, though that could have very well been his imagination.
Due to the snow and the cabin’s remote location, the ambulance wouldn’t arrive for a half an hour to an hour, and all Sherlock could really do was stay by John’s side and make sure that he was okay.
“But you’re not comfortable with it,” Sherlock blurted out. He quickly shook his head as if mentally chastising himself. “No, sorry, that was…not good.”
“Dinner. There’s a Thai place just up the street. You’re probably hungry after your match.”
After exchanging their gifts, Sherlock and John had sat down in front of the telly with a breakfast of toast and jam and watched a bit of whatever Christmas film had happened to be on, much to Sherlock’s chagrin.
“You know what it was.”
“What’re you doing?“ the man slurred, blood already gushing from his nose and dripping down to his mouth, making him splutter and spit with a grimace.
And so Sherlock spent the rest of the afternoon whispering various facts about bees to John and thinking up all sorts of things they could do on their next pirate adventure. And after a while of talking, Sherlock noticed with surprise that he wasn’t bored at all, not even a little.
day I sleep in,” Sherlock mused.
“Thank god that’s over,” John said, taking one last look at the building he wouldn’t be seeing for a good few weeks. “If I had to listen that man talk for another minute I think I’d have jumped out the bloody window. Good thing we’ve got a break now, yeah?”
He was back upstairs within two minutes.
my ear.”
It was silent for a while as John glossed over the menu and Sherlock went back and forth from texting and glancing out the window. Sherlock noticed that John was beginning to look around nervously, searching for something to say.
“I do, yeah,” John said, trying to hide his grin.
The doctor was settled in his usual spot at the desk, wearing a warm knit jumper, which usually equaled contentment for him, but Sherlock could just tell by the look on his face that something was off.
“John?”
“Must I do everything?” Sherlock muttered to himself as he placed the water down on the night table.
John panted heavily as he ran, his feet thudding loudly as they hit the ground. Sherlock’s shape was difficult to make out in the darkness, but he could see that he wasn’t too far ahead, and the suspect seemed to be just a hair away from him, and so John slowed his pace a fraction with the thought that Sherlock was only moments away from stopping the man.
“Isn’t it obvious?” John asked.
The lampposts and streetlights lit up the otherwise inky black sky as they walked down the pavement alongside the building, leaves crunching under their feet as they went.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“It’s not, though,” John sighed, rubbing the back of his neck nervously. “I’m not taking care of myself. And I’m- I’m sorry I told you to leave. I wasn’t angry with you, necessarily, I was just—“
“Oh, be a sport, Greg,” Sherlock teased, edging closer to him.
“Of course.” The detective replied smoothly.
I know that the beginning of this is pretty similar to the first chapter, but I hope it’s okay anyway and I hope you enjoy it! Also, I should mention that I went back and fixed some things about the previous chapters that were bugging me, and I ended up deleting a chapter because I really wasn’t happy with it, so apologies if things seem a little different!
“What? Why?”
I don’t know why I always keep these two accounts so separate, but my tumblr is bbcbluebell if anybody wants to come over and say hi!
-------------
“I do hope you realize that the only reason I agreed to come here is for the scones,” Sherlock said.
“How—“
“And I’ll have to get there before my shift ‘cause if I don’t, it’ll be closed by the time I leave work, which means—“
He burrowed his face into his pillow and tried to close his eyes. He didn’t necessarily need Sherlock there to fall asleep, but it was always easier with him.
At this, Sherlock stopped writing and slapped his pen down dramatically on the table. He lifted his head to finally look John in the eye and took a deep breath.
“Yes, my parents weren’t exactly pleased with my disinterest in the holiday considering their rather large obsession with it.”
“Dr. Watson? Wake up now.” Sherlock said, biting back the urge to yell.
Sherlock and John were deep into the woods, following a dusty dirt path surrounded by thickets and aging trees, the branches like claws silhouetted against the night sky.
“Hm? Oh, didn’t take long. Once I narrowed down the area it’d be in it was simply a matter of hunting and pecking. An object like this, it’s small, barely noticeable, the cabbie wouldn’t waste time burying it because who’d be looking for it if you were dead?”
John turned to look at him and sighed. “How can I not, Sherlock? I have a lot to do. I was supposed to be working on my paper tonight, and I’m gonna have to get to the library tomorrow to get this bloody book for the research I have to do, and—“
“No, not that type of walking stick, the type that’s used by people who are blind, Sherlock.”
The detective chuckled under his breath and didn’t stop in his typing. “I don’t know John; I think I quite like this. Now your readers are getting the
Lestrade’s footfalls were getting closer as Sherlock hobbled over to the man’s head to examine his coat collar.
-------------
“They wanted me to go to Oxford, get a big important job like he did, do big important things all day, but of course I didn’t want to. They’ve never really gotten over it.”
John grinned. “Yeah, starving.”
John took his hand and gave him a reassuring squeeze. “What do you think, then?” He gestured to the dance floor. “D’you want to dance?”
John felt a burst of warmth in his chest upon seeing Sherlock, but held back his grin as he turned to face Greg.
“That’s easy for you to say, Mister I-can-memorize-anything-after-looking-at-it-once.”
They settled into their chairs, but still John stayed quiet, as if waiting for the correct moment to break the silence.
When there was no response or beaker being placed in his hand, Sherlock looked up to find the room empty. It was only then that he remembered that John had left to get firewood, but surely that couldn’t have been too long ago.
“Look at me.”
“I just wanted to say…I’m sorry,” he said. “You were right, before.”
He crossed the hall in an angry huff, his fists shoved into his coat pockets.
“Well, where is it?” he asked.
“What?”
John had never actually been to Sherlock’s flat before, and he was admittedly a little curious as to what Sherlock’s place looked like, mainly wondering whether or not there were various experiments bubbling away all over the flat.
“Oh, Christ.” He shot back to the sink and turned down the water, having to let Hamish scamper into the sitting room behind him.
Sherlock looked to John enthusiastically, but the look on John’s face was a combination of confusion, disbelief and absolute horror. For a moment, neither of them said anything. John’s mouth hung open a bit before he licked his lips in thought.
“Oh, right.” Sherlock croaked out. He took out his mobile and phoned Lestrade.
“I didn't mean to—“
“Oh, you’re back,” John said, looking up.
“Of course, but I just, I just haven’t thought about it in so long. I guess some part of me thought I was immune.” He chuckled dryly.
“Well, you'll be glad to know that I caught Wilkins and his accomplice, so there
“And you thought the next two designs were fascinating as well, yeah?”
“Evans was caught. Case closed,” he tried.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed.
“No. Leave,” Sherlock barked, pointing his finger at the door while keeping one hand on John.
“Sherlock, not now.” John’s voice was stern, authoritative. Obviously not in the mood to discuss the matter, but honestly, how many more times was John going struggle his way through something as simple as reading a menu before he realized that getting glasses was not only practical, but necessary at this point?
“Oh. That…actually sounds lovely,” John said, some of the tension leaving his voice.
“Okay, but
Except that
“Please don’t do that out loud.” John muttered.
“No, no, it’s okay. I get it,” John told him. He haphazardly did up about three buttons before deciding it was good enough and hauled himself up from the bed, sending Sherlock scrambling after him.
“’Lo,” Greg mumbled, his mouth half full of a frosted donut.
John frowned and tucked himself back into his pants, sucking in gulps of air to keep himself from getting teary-eyed. How could he go from on the verge of turned on to on the verge of tears in a matter of seconds?
“I'm sorry, by the way, about earlier," John said. "I didn’t think talking about what happened would set me off like that. It’s just…”
“How do you mean?”
“Sherlock, wake up,” he whispered.
“Because, John, Christmas is only one week away and I am not about to deal with crowds of last minute shoppers or be forced to stand in a queue listening to impatient huffing and wailing toddlers for three hours,” Sherlock said.
Now, with the fire going and painkillers eagerly taken, all John could really do was wait.
“All right, all right, now get off!” John released his hold on him and Seb scrambled to push himself off the ground. He brushed himself off and stared daggers in Sherlock’s direction.
Another half an hour had passed with not a peep from Sherlock, and John’s anxieties about the previous night were starting to get the better of him. Thinking that he’d simply go and ask Sherlock if he’d like some tea or breakfast just to make sure that he was okay, John walked down the hall to the bedroom. He lifted his fist to knock, but found the door to be already opened slightly.
John chuckled quietly at the message; at least Sherlock wasn’t angry with him.
“Um…yes, but, who are y—“
Sherlock only rolled his eyes and tightened his gloves on his hand.
Sherlock lifted his gaze for a mere millisecond before reverting back down to his notes.
“And I can help you with all that.” Sherlock interrupted. John tried not to look as surprised as he felt.
When moments passed without even a gasp of shock from Sherlock, though, John had to swallow back his fear and raise his head to look at him.
“What? No. Isn’t a man allowed to have an off day every now and again?”
“Honestly, John, you have far too much faith in people.”
John sighed. “Yeah, alright. But only ‘cause I like your mum, too. Keeps you in line somehow, that woman.”
“I know. Isn’t it delightful?”
John watched as the expression on Sherlock’s face slowly morphed from anger to confusion. His eyes fell to the floor and his mouth hung slightly open as he searched for something to say. The aching silence stretched on, and after another few moments that felt like years, John couldn’t take it anymore.
“Happy birthday, John.”
“Sherlock!” John shouted, his breath coming out like a puff of smoke in front of him as he ran. The mad bastard was already miles ahead of him, and John was not about to let his friend try to tackle some hell-bent criminal by himself.
“Pretty sure, thanks.” John’s words were tight and clipped, and muffled a bit as he continued to wipe at his face.
“I like you too, but you’ve gotta go home and get some rest, okay?”
Sherlock let out a long winded sigh. “I’ll get the bags.”
“Oh, don’t flatter yourself; I’m not here for you,” Sherlock said.
“You can take my bed,” Sherlock said when John entered the sitting room.
“Check your suitcase.”
“Sh…Sherlock,” John breathed, the pain making it difficult for him to speak above a whisper.
“I love you too, John. Go to sleep. I’ll be here.”
“Well, yes. So if I didn’t choose a pill, he’d just shoot me. And I—oh, I was such a bloody idiot!” He yelled, practically pulling his hair with both hands to the side of his head.
He stepped forward until they were practically chest to chest, reached out to gently cup the back of Sherlock’s head, and pulled him in close.
“He’s not answering!” Hamish told him. This was why Sherlock was hesitant to let Hamish help; John could get either extremely quiet or extremely swear-happy when he was in pain, and he wasn’t sure he wanted Hamish to be around for either of those possibilities.
“This had better be important, Lestrade,” he bellowed to the empty air as he approached the door, “I was right in the middle of—“
They swayed back and forth, beautifully lost in the sea of people, and John thought back to the night he first met Sherlock, on the very same dance floor, and how much his life had changed since then. He had resigned himself to a life at university filled with nothing but his studies and his small group of friends, never imagining he’d be comfortable enough with himself let alone another person to ever be a part of something that meant so much.
The doctor twitched a bit and bit his lip.
Sherlock knew something was wrong, something that probably couldn’t be fixed with a shower and a cup of Earl Grey, so he fished out his mobile from his pocket and called for an ambulance.
“Ah, sentiment. I see.”
Fishing his phone out of his pocket, Sherlock pulled off his glove and pressed Lestrade’s name.
“Of course it was,” John scoffed. “I wasn’t exactly going to announce to my friends that my family are disgusted and ashamed of both me and my sister and don’t want anything to do with us, was I?” John stopped in his tea preparation when he realized how much he’d raised his voice.
The pitter-patter of rain on the long paned windows of Baker Street mimicked the tip-tapping of computer keys as John typed up his blog. He shifted a bit in his tired maroon armchair in an effort to get more comfortable. John grinned at the laptop screen, and continued to type.
John nodded and cleared his throat. “Well I am a doctor, as you know, and er, my mum had it, actually. She was a bit older than I am now, though, when it started. I was just a kid, y’know, hardly twelve I think.”
“Yes, how convenient.”
“I know. Th’s not why’m calling, you berk.” John slurred.
The doctor worried his bottom lip before answering. “I’ve got tunnel vision that’s becoming exponentially worse. My perception of colour has already begun to fade. It’s hard to focus. Sometimes things blur in and out.”
“Why?”
“Oh, right. ‘Course.” John laughed nervously and walked over to the kitchen. “Um, how about I make some breakfast? We’ve got toast or...toast.”
When John reached the entrance to the sitting room, he stopped dead in his tracks to stare at the image of Sherlock in his deep red dressing gown, facing the window and swaying lightly as he expertly pulled the bow across the strings.
“Me. Now, chapter one…”
John reached out to take the scarf from Sherlock’s hold, but was surprised when instead of handing it to him, Sherlock stepped into his space and wrapped the scarf around his neck himself. All of the air seemed to escape John’s lungs at once as he felt Sherlock’s fingers deftly adjusting the garment around him, felt the warmth practically radiating off of him.
“You are there, aren’t you?” John teased.
“Can’t. Busy.”
John’s smile quickly fell from his face when he turned to see Sebastian Wilkes making his way toward them.
“I need something to do!” Sherlock said, grabbing onto John’s shoulders and shaking him.
. I can deduce that a man has had knee surgery or that someone had broken their arm when they were twelve without feeling a thing, but imagining what you must have gone through was not so easy. I'm sorry.”
“What do you always tell me when I stay up too late working on cold cases?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock poked at the forming fire a bit. “Oh, please, you’re overjoyed to be here. If I had to see you aggressively drink tea one more time I’d have sent you on holiday myself.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” John crossed his arms and looked straight ahead, attempting to ignore the fact that his legs had started shaking.
Seven o’clock couldn’t have come fast enough, and Sherlock was practically going stir crazy as he paced about the mess of his flat. His ears perked up when he heard the door open and close downstairs, and the cheery, high pitched voice of Mrs. Hudson welcoming in Dr. Watson.
“A beaker? What, are you making a gingerbread laboratory?”
Sherlock didn’t even get to the end of the post before he had to stop, unable to think about anything other than how much pain John must have been in as he typed it, and the fact that he’d tried to hide it. He set his laptop aside and was just about to go check on John when there was a tiny, almost inaudible knock on his door.
“What? Why? Are you okay?”
Sherlock pulled the case into the middle of the floor and opened it up. He carefully took out the bow and violin and got up to stand by the window near his desk. He rested the violin on his thigh and plucked a few strings to make sure it was in tune before tucking it under his chin.
Of course Sherlock would text him in the middle of the day just to say that he was bored. John wouldn’t expect anything less at this point, though he didn’t think he’d want it any other way, either.
It was always slightly chilly in Greg’s flat for some reason, but John was content, sitting on the rough floorboards in front of the sofa and letting the company of his mates and the beer in his hand warm him up. They were all sat in a circle, spinning an empty bottle and playing a good old fashioned game of truth or dare.
“Nope.” John crossed his arms over his chest fixed his gaze firmly ahead.
Sherlock frowned slightly and knocked a bit louder in case John was entranced in a video game or had the telly on too loud.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.” He gave her a small kiss on the cheek as she headed out the door.
“Not really my area,” Sherlock said.
Anderson scowled, putting a hand in front of him to make his way through.
“I should’ve told you sooner.” John admitted. “It was stupid of me, really. Honestly it was more work trying to hide the symptoms from you than actually dealing with them.”
“I think I’m with her on this one, Sherlock,” John laughed. He stopped briefly on the pavement to check his phone that had just gone off with a text. “Hey, Mike just texted,” he said. “He wants to know if we want to go to Hudson’s to get some coffee before we all leave for the break. Greg and Molly will be there, too.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Suit yourself.”
“Hamish, what's wrong?” He was in his pyjamas, his favourite stuffed bee clutched to his side, but his eyes looked red-rimmed and brimming with tears.
“Yes?”
“Here, let me see,” John said, holding his hand out and motioning to Sherlock’s phone.
“Right. So, I was thinking of going for a walk, if you wanted to join me. Maybe you could collect some more samples of…whatever that is.”
John scoffed. “Yeah, I don’t think so, not after the last time you took over my blog and wrote about nothing but mud samples.”
“Because…you could’ve been hurt,” John told him.
“What happened?” he asked, quickly getting up.
“Hang on a sec,” Lestrade said, shifting the folder to the other hand and looking at Sherlock with a bit more apprehension.
“You think my hair is perfect?”
John smiled warmly at Sherlock and took his hand, squeezing it gently. “It’s very good, it’s bloody amazing,” he said. “You even got my favourite movies.”
“Yes, the one on the paper,” Sherlock repeated, tapping an impatient finger on it.
John repositioned himself in an attempt to get more comfortable, but it seemed no matter what wall he was facing or whether he slept on his stomach or his side, he still felt as if there were a buzzing ball of energy in his chest that kept him from properly winding down.
“Oh, is that one…private?”
“You really think that lowly of your fellow students?”
John awoke to the faint beeping of a heart monitor and the gentle tapping of Sherlock’s fingers as they flew across his phone screen.
“Stay with me?” John asked, holding a hand out in invitation.
“Don’t ask, John,” Sherlock interrupted.
“Isn’t he?”
“Probably, but I’m curious,” he teased.
“Just hang in there, mate,” Lestrade said from his position at the door.
“I know of Mike and I happen to live with Greg. They’re not actually my friends, and you know that.”
“Of course. Er, thank you.” The detective mumbled. John sat down adjacent to him and attempted to read the case notes so far. The words were a bit out of focus, and Sherlock’s chicken scratch wasn’t helping, but with a little adjusting and some guesswork, John could make out most of it.
“Who’s that?” John asked.
Sherlock tried to dash again, but the DI held him back.
“I guess that makes sense. Sure. And I wasn’t so keen on heading out into the night by myself again just yet," he said.
He entered the dimly lit sitting room and had to squint a bit to see that yes, Sherlock was indeed reading his old medical textbooks from Uni. He shook his head in annoyance and shoved off his shoes. Before he could so much as ask Sherlock what on earth he was doing with his books, the detective shot his head up and gave John his famous once-over.
“I'm sorry, were you not at the crime scene this afternoon? You saw what happened to John.“
The detective’s head perked up like a cat’s after hearing the inspector’s yell, but he only rolled his eyes and went back to examining the blood splatter on the dry, cracked wallpaper.
“Yeah, yeah, jus’ get on with it!”
“Sherlock, sit down,” John said calmly.
John leaned over Sherlock’s shoulder at the book, and in a swift movement, turned it a good thirty pages further and pointed to where he landed.
“You play?”
“What? I didn’t- how—“ John sputtered as he slid off his coat and sat down.
John looked down at his pocket where his mobile was tucked away. He looked back up at the speaker, still only slightly aware of what he was saying, and decided to give in to temptation and take out his phone.
“Take my hand.” Sherlock said, holding it out in front of John.
“Two pills? What does that mean?”
“You should get some rest. You’ll be discharged this afternoon.”
“You're an arse,” he said.
tw: nightmares, anxiety
“I don’t like this,” he said. His voice sounded small and miserable, and John cringed in sympathy. He picked up Sherlock’s head from where it rested with the intention of having him sit up, but instead the man simply plopped down into the crook of John’s neck as if it were his second home.
“I don’t want to- to set you off or—“
“Sod off.”
John rushed to the door to see who it was and immediately let out a huge sigh of relief when he saw Sherlock stepping back inside, large duffle bag in hand.
“Right, no one. Until now.”
“What do I do?” John sobbed.
“Face hurts.”
“Is he alright?” Sherlock asked in a hushed tone.
“No one ever said it was, but you have me. And I always know what to do, remember?”
-------------
“Right. One question at a time, and I reserve the right to not explain something if I don’t want to,” John said.
“Nothing. Never mind,” Sherlock dismissed.
In the end, John’s team had lost by just a few measly points, and while the rest of his teammates stood around kicking their gym bags and bemoaning their loss, John couldn’t find it in him to feel bad, because it had been one of the most enjoyable games he’d played since he’d first started back in secondary school.
John steeled himself and quickly downed the rest of his tea. He cleared his throat and got up, clenching his fist at his side.
“Right, where’m I going?”
“I believe this is yours,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock looked up at him. “Goodnight, John.”
John’s good spirits were dampened slightly upon entering his bedroom and seeing his mess of a bed from the night before. He’d been tossing and turning almost the entire night, leaving the sheets and duvet in a tangled heap that he’d had no time to fix that morning.
“No, Sherlock,” John chided. “I did not find designs carved into people’s backs by a knife ‘
“Sleep well?” Sherlock asked.
“Hm. Speak for yourself,” Sherlock said, looking longingly at the buildings as they walked.
Sherlock’s flatmate?”
“Good,” John said, his voice calm and quiet.
“Should be a step up from trying to experiment on the kitchen sponge.”
to sleep in your flat, not to mention buy him dinner. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
Something in the man’s voice was different that time, Sherlock thought, as he clicked his pocket magnifying glass closed and slipped it in his pocket. He heaved himself up off the dust-laden wooden floors and brushed the remaining particles off his trousers.
When Sherlock looked up at John he noticed that he still looked exhausted. An idea came into his head, and he quickly snapped the folder shut and went downstairs to Mrs. Hudson.
“Shit, sorry,” John cursed, pulling his hand away.
“You’re warm,” Sherlock reasoned, wrapping his hand weakly around John’s arm as if trying to hold him there.
As the movie went on, John’s eyes grew pleasantly tired, and he sank into an almost dreamlike state where there was nothing but soft and warm and calm.
And it didn’t matter that there was no melody to lull John to sleep that night, because having Sherlock there next to him was more soothing than any lullaby he’d ever heard.
The doctor immediately looked up to find the form of Lestrade outlined in a fuzzy blur. “Yes, fine. Allergies.” He lied.
“Sherlock, we need to talk.”
John listened as Sherlock dutifully hung up his coat and scarf before padding over to stand in front of him.
he thought.
John looked down and worried the blanket between his fingers. “No, it’s not, is it? Do you even know why I was so angry with you earlier?”
Another button went, revealing the white cotton of his undershirt.
John returned shortly to the sitting room with a jumper in one hand and his oatmeal cardigan in the other.
“No, you wouldn’t have.”
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and tucked his head into the crook of his neck, feeling light and happy. “I do still need to have my eyes checked, though,” he reminded him.
“Night.”
“It wasn’t just that, Sherlock. It’s that even out here, in the middle of nowhere, with no computers or phones or cases, you still barely noticed me.”
“Come on, let’s get you out of here,” John said, holding out a hand to him. “We’ll go back to mine and get you cleaned up, yeah?”
It was almost ten o’clock by the time John got back to his hotel room. He and Sherlock had been texting throughout most of the evening, and John was grateful for the distraction. Now, though, he was looking forward to finally being able to relax.
“Hail us a cab, will you?”
“John, look at me,” Sherlock said softly, kneeling before him and putting a hand to his cheek.
The response was almost instant.
“Oh, go ahead, yeah.”
John quickly followed after him and stepped into Sherlock’s bedroom, a small space with a perfectly made bed in the corner and a desk overflowing with notes and test tubes to the left of it. The walls were decked out with various insect and plant diagrams, along with a large poster of the periodic table, and what looked to be a stag skull wearing a pair of safety goggles.
Mycroft shook his head minutely.
“Are you trying to get me to eat?”
Whatever the reason, John found himself easily following the notes instead of dark thoughts, found his mind wandering to a blissful sort of nothingness, and before he knew it, he was sound asleep.
-------------
Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed. “John, as I said before, I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself and I do not need you to look out for me like some kind of student-cum-vigilante.”
John sighed and shook his head.
“Perhaps you could be an animal whisperer, since they seem to be so drawn to you. John?”
“I’ll make it quick, okay? So, the pub. I was definitely plastered at one point. Then I must’ve sobered up enough to remember to get a cab. I got into the cab, and…”
“I’m not saying it is; I’m saying that he’s boring and not worth my time.”
John sighed and bit his toast a bit more aggressively than was necessary. “D’you want the truth, then, Sherlock?” he asked.
“Yeah. Coach ran us dry. Especially me, ‘cause I went and lost us the game last ti—“
Sherlock shrugged indifferently as he read. “I’ve got a theory, but I need to meet with someone.”
“I know, but you can never be too sure, yeah?”
John turned his head to look at the chair next to his bed. Hanging over the back of it was Sherlock’s coat, Sherlock’s phone charger was plugged in to the wall, and there were two empty coffee cups sat on the counter. Sherlock must have been sitting with him all night.
dare, then we’re off. Clear?”
As Sherlock got up to put on the kettle, he could see John trying to hide a smile.
By the time they made it back to 221B, it was nearly evening. Sherlock hadn’t bothered to notice that they’d wasted half the day away chasing cabs and questioning drivers on a wild goose chase. Sherlock was planning on discussing the next plan of action to John as soon as they’d gotten back, but to the detective’s utmost dismay, an overly posh black car was parked outside Baker Street.
“What, at three in the morning?” he snapped.
As soon as he sat down on the plush, warm blankets, John could feel the weight of the day practically melting off of him. He couldn’t help but feel a little silly, though, like he was attending some sort of slumber party similar to the ones that his sister would have when they were younger. But John set aside his slight embarrassment for now and wriggled himself back into the pillows in an attempt to get as comfortable as possible. Sherlock had put this all together for him, had put off his own obligations for the night, and so he was going to try to enjoy every minute of it.
“Panic attacks usually last five to twenty minutes, and it’s gonna get worse before it gets better, but it
“Sherlock!” John called as Sherlock stormed off of the field. “Sherlock, wait!”
“John.” Sherlock jogged after him, catching his upper arm and stopping him. “What’s wrong?”
He is, John thought. And even though John could see one of the staff members already attempting to break things up, John couldn’t help it; adrenaline kicked in and he ran over to the dance floor and pushed his way through the crowd.
“Yes,” he said.
John waited until Mrs. Hudson was out of earshot before turning his attention back to Sherlock.
“I said, that was completely, wholly unnecessary. I was perfectly fine,” Sherlock seethed through gritted teeth.
“Who?”
The first touch of Sherlock’s lips on his own was firm but chaste, a gentle pressure that lingered for a moment before lifting away. Sherlock’s fingers tightened around the scarf in his hands and he angled his head to recapture John’s mouth, pressing the slightest bit more firmly. John responded in kind by tightening his grip on Sherlock’s coat and bringing him in closer to plant one last slow kiss on his lips. He opened his eyes and gently backed away.
?” Hamish repeated with heightened worry.
Sherlock glanced up at him and quirked a small smile as well. “Well, I can’t always guarantee our safety, but I will make an effort to be more careful, if only to avoid having to deal with how grumpy you are when faced with hospital food.”
John was sitting in the lecture hall, leaning back against the creaky wooden seat and twirling a pencil in his hand. He was only half listening as his professor continued to repeat the same few points he’d made earlier but in a slightly different way.
John could feel the weight of tacky, dried blood in his hair and down his right cheek. He moved to bring his hand up to feel around for a wound but was stopped short by the burn of rope tied tightly around his wrists.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “I can leave it alone. It’s fine.”
“What’s Anderson doing with that lamp?” He asked, pointing in a random direction.
“And…you probably wash your hands ten times a day ‘cause of all your experimenting, though I’m usually not around for that. And, oh, you’ve got a scar, right underneath your thumb.”
“You’re nervous,” Sherlock stated.
“That’s not exactly applicable here, John.”
“Because they’re insufferable.”
“One,” John uttered in a harsh whisper.
“John.”
In reality, the resemblance to Jim Moriarty was not overwhelming, but it was enough to send John back. It was enough to cause images of him to flash in front of John’s eyes, to hear his voice resounding in his head. It was enough to send his mind reeling back to memories that he had no desire to revisit. And John knew that as soon as he fell asleep, it would all be out of his control. The monsters of his past would come to greet him whether he wanted them to or not. And he would spend the night in an endless circle of waking from a nightmare only to fall back into another one.
“On my desk,” Sherlock said as he strode toward one of the bedrooms.
“Dr. Watson—“
“Oh is that right? You think you’re a tough little sod, walkin’ round this part of town at night?” John struggled as the man gripped both his arms now with large, rough hands. “Shouldn’t you have a little cub scout holdin’ your hand when you cross the street?” he sneered.
“Um, Sherlock, right. I’ve told you I don’t remember anything useful. I’m not gonna be much help. And I thought you said you weren’t with the police?”
“Same here,” Mike said. “The usual boring family stuff.”
“I wish I didn’t,” he said.
John smiled. “Maybe I do, yeah.” He turned his head away and bit his lip, suddenly very nervous. He had to do this, though; deep down, he
“Yes! Thank you. You can go back to sleep now.”
Lestrade held the phone to his ear with nervous hands as he got into the driver’s seat.
His friend didn’t respond, instead he started tossing and turning while harsh coughs continued to wrack his small frame. Sherlock was beginning to get worried when suddenly he heard footsteps hurrying up the stairs.
John rubbed the back of his neck nervously. “You- you didn’t have to go through all this trouble for me. I don’t—“
“That’s my line,” John teased.  “Yeah, I had something earlier.”
“Do you still feel dizzy?”
“Right. Up you get, then.”
Steeling himself, John got up from the floor and didn’t look at anyone as he snatched his shirt out of Tom’s now slack grip and stomped to the door.
“And you’re not a freak,” John insisted. He uncurled from his position and began tidying up their dirtied utensils and empty takeaway containers. “Come on, let’s get all this cleaned up and then we can watch crime shows while you point out all the mistakes, yeah?”
“That was completely unnecessary,” Sherlock fumed, tugging on the ends of his hair in frustration.
“So, is that something you do often?” he asked.
“To get my things, obviously. I do need at least one extra shirt to get me through the remainder of the holiday.”
“Not after the ‘bathtub incident,’ no.”
John sputtered. “Sorry, ogling?”
Sherlock held back his smile and opened up their dinners. They both sat down at the kitchen table and ate their food while going over the details of the case like excited children telling ghost stories at camp.
“What? Oh, yes. Doing menial research always clears my head.”
The ride back to Baker Street was quiet. John focused his weary eyes on the buildings floating by outside the cab window while Sherlock tapped his foot incessantly and fiddled with his phone.
Sherlock got up out of his seat and went outside. He looked around for a moment, then stood John’s old cane near the window so it’d be easy to spot. He brushed himself off and came back inside.
“Do these people do stuff like that often?”
“It means that even drunk, you seem like a good person.”
“Those are bones. Are these
“Any time.” John threw his heavier jumper on over his lighter weight one and sat back down.
He wanted to memorize Sherlock. Just in case he really did lose the ability to see everything, he wanted to have a good, precise image of his best friend tucked away in his head. And so he sat and tried not to make his observing so obvious as they waited for Sherlock to be called.
“It reminds me that I need help, sometimes,” John went on. “That I can’t always do everything on my own.”
“Oh, it wasn’t a date,” John said, laughing nervously. “I was just hanging out with Sherlock.”
“Came down to have another look, did you?” John heard Seb sneer.
John didn’t hesitate. He followed Sherlock’s instructions exactly, and the detective smirked as he saw the cabbie turn the only corner that was available, and right into their trap.
John shook his head, trying not to smile.
“Oh, my god. That was…that was insane,” John chuckled. “This has honestly been the most interesting week of my life. Jeez, I actually…I actually think I want to write about this, in that god forsaken blog my therapist keeps ranting about.”
Sherlock was very quiet after that, needing to think a few things through.
John crossed his arms over his chest and let out a long sigh. He was horribly mistaken, as the conference was proving to be just as unbelievably dull as he’d anticipated. He could feel himself zoning out as the speaker at the podium droned on in a stilted, monotone voice.
, John!” he announced, sweeping his way into the flat as if he owned the place and flopping dramatically onto the sofa.
“Almost. Damned thing won’t fit,” Sherlock complained.
After Sherlock had cleaned off his face and downed a few painkillers, John made sure that he sat down with a bag of frozen peas on his cheek at least until the swelling went down. It was a good hour or so before they finally left for the café, having to stop off at Sherlock’s flat so that he could change out of his bloodied shirt and mud-stained trousers.
“Lestrade has always been a touch overdramatic.”
“I can see the tag from here; it says ‘Harry’ in permanent marker,” Sherlock explained, keeping his voice low as if he could tell that he’d hit a sensitive subject. “And Harry could be anyone, of course; a cousin, an uncle, you could’ve gotten the jacket at a charity shop, for all I know. But it’s not been very well taken care of; the fibers on the tag are fraying, there’s small rips around the shoulder seam and multiple stains on the lapel.
“What? No, I don’t do that. I don’t have those. I don’t…oh god,” John scrunched his trembling left hand into a tight fist and shut his eyes tight. He was beginning to shake lightly and took a careful few sips of water. Sherlock still leaned over him and even started to rub his shoulders lightly in a borderline comforting gesture.
“You’re shivering; it’s annoying,” Sherlock said in explanation.
“Okay, stay where you are. I don’t think Andrews is going anywhere and Lestrade will be here any minute. I’m on my way.”
Now John was walking with shaking hands stuffed into his pockets, hoping that Sherlock couldn’t hear how heavily he was breathing.
“I’m writing up the blog,” John said.
“Hang on,” John said, realization dawning on him, “it was him, wasn’t it? Him and his cronies, the ones who got you stupidly drunk that night.”
“Yeah, well, that seems to be just about the only time you pay attention to—look, never mind. It’s fine.”
“Yes, but how can I help them to…not happen?” Sherlock asked, suddenly sounding as if he were trying to work out a problem for a case. “What can I do to reassure you? I don’t know how to put into words how important you are to me, how extraordinary I think you are."
“That’s what?”
John sighed in acquiescence and turned the small lamp on so they could both see properly. Sherlock looked like an eager child waiting to be told a bedtime story.
Luckily, John didn't have to spend more than a few minutes waiting before he heard Sherlock's footsteps approaching.
The inspector stepped into view, not fully entering the room. “What d’you need?” he asked.
Satisfied with his answer, John tucked his phone away in his pocket and appreciated the view out his window for the remainder of the ride.
“Could you tell?” John quipped. “Sorry. I haven’t been on a proper date in ages.”
John let out a breathless laugh. “Come on Sherlock seriously, you can’t deduce why I might not have wanted you to know?”
As soon as Sherlock sat down, the entire feeling in the room changed. There was a sudden and undefinable electricity buzzing in the empty space between their bodies. Perhaps John had drunk more alcohol than he’d thought.
“C’mon, you told me you used to do ballet.”
“Mm. And what time is it?”
“Upset?”
Sherlock nodded grimly. He looked to John who seemed to be miles away already.
Sherlock piped up from his spot. “It’s child’s play, Lestrade. You’ve seen the bathroom. Her hair and makeup things were scattered everywhere.”
“Tea, John. You’re still cold, the beverage is warm; hardly a difficult concept.”
“Good. We’ll stay back here for a little longer, though. I know it can take a while to feel normal again, so we’ll take our time.”
“But he’ll fall if I—“
He laughed.
“Well,” Mrs. Hudson said, clapping her hands together, “all that aside, how about I get you boys some coffee? But just this once, mind, I’m not your waitress.”
“So you can take your rapidly growing tea addiction with you,” Sherlock said.
“Sherlock, where are you?” he snapped.
John bit the inside of his cheek and finished up preparing his tea.
“Sorry, what are you doing?” he asked.
“I see,” Sherlock said. “Get some rest; you’ll be out of here soon.”
Sherlock hid his surprise and flipped aimlessly through the channels for a while, stopping when he came to a nature documentary.
It's been weeks since John and Sherlock have been intimate with each other and John is beginning to feel like perhaps he's no longer as needed as he used to be.
try to arrest a dog?” he asked.
John nodded. “You’re right. You are an idiot. But…” He slowly reached out and grasped Sherlock’s hand, holding his long fingers in his smaller ones. “But I need you. And these past few weeks, I thought maybe the feeling wasn’t so mutual anymore.”
On the cab ride back to Baker Street, John relaxed into the familiar sound of the car rumbling against the gravel. He could hear the hum of the engine, could hear Sherlock tapping ever so slightly on his leg, and could smell the odd scents that lingered in from outside. The squeal of the tires, the tired sighs from his friend, he could take it all in and form a picture from it in his head.
“You’re not. I can buy a truckload of cake and bribe Mycroft into helping. We can work this out, John, but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Right now I need to know what your vision is like. How are you seeing things?”
He was just beginning to resign himself to a prolonged period of wait before Sherlock inevitably showed up when he heard faint voices from outside the heavy metal door.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispered.
John winced slightly. “She pretty much already knew, so I thought she’d be fine with it, but she was drunk when I told her, so I got to hear how she really felt.”
“What was?”
“Perhaps.”
“John, I don’t think you’ll want my hands…there, right now. They’re really quite cold,” Sherlock warned, seeming to relax a bit as he made himself more comfortable.
“Sherlock?” he asked, his voice quietly shaking.
When John and Sherlock finished weaving their way through the crowd and got out to the pavement, John led Sherlock over to a bench and sat him down.
“I believe you forgot something at the restaurant,” Sherlock said, standing by the mantle.
“Mmh...okay,” Sherlock breathed, relaxing into his seat and releasing his grip on John.
Staring at himself in the mirror, John was a picture of a cozy evening in. He was clad in a soft grey sweatshirt and some plaid pyjama bottoms, but his clothes were definitely not a reflection of his current mood. He took a deep breath and hoped he’d be able to get his mind off of all of his responsibilities for long enough to enjoy himself.
“I gave them back, John.”
“Excuse me,” Sherlock said, tapping on the divider. The cabbie turned around for a moment to address Sherlock. “Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?”
John wondered if he’d overstepped, if Sherlock was for some reason uncomfortable with him coming over, and his chest was just beginning to stir with mild panic when his phone buzzed in his hand.
“My brother. He’s being exceptionally annoying.”
The doctor rubbed the sleep from his eyes and sat up a bit, the blanket pooling around his waist.
“Hm. Maybe I should get one of those,” John mused. “I could write about my mad friend who keeps eyeballs in a jar.”
“It wasn’t your fault.” Sherlock interrupted.
“Sherlock!” he tried again, his voice already losing steam. “Sher—“ John gasped sharply as his foot slipped on a sheet of ice, sending him hurtling forward and landing directly on his left shoulder.
“Touché,” John said, pulling out a somewhat heavy object wrapped in tissue paper. He unwrapped the paper to find a stainless steel thermos.
“I like it,” Sherlock said. “These are all very well done. They look…good.”
“Don’t tell me you have him too.”
John tried to hold back a nasty frown in front of the doctor. He knew these things already, of course, as part of his loathing of being a patient was constantly being told things he already knew.
“I guess you can tell I’ve always had a passion for the job,” Greg said, clearly laughing at his past self.
“It’s all right.”
“John.”
John felt Sherlock untangle himself from the duvet and get up to start his morning routine.
“You’d be good at it, though. With the way you can figure things out just by looking at people.”
It was the next evening, and Sherlock was at St. Bart’s, examining some sort of, well, something. John wasn’t too sure; all he knew was that Sherlock had been excited about it and likely wouldn’t be home any time soon.
“Seriously,” the man mocked, suddenly dragging John’s smaller form into the nearby alley and shoving him against the rough brick wall. “Gimme all you got,” he demanded.
John toed off his shoes and headed into the bathroom for a quick shower.
“Feelings,” he spat out, as if it pained him to say it.
“Are you suffering from delusions as well?” Sherlock asked suddenly, pulling his gloves tighter around his hands.
The doctor was murmuring something, his face twitching, brow furrowing, fists clenching.
“John.”
“Like a mother hen, John. Like a mother hen.” Sherlock closed his eyes and put his fingers in a prayer position under his lips.
“Oh he’s fine, dear, just a bit shaken up it seems. Didn’t finish his tea…” Mrs. Hudson trailed off sadly.
“They all take the same poison Lestrade, it’s obvious! These are serial killings, I don’t know how, but it’s murder.”
“Oh, ta,” John mumbled. He got himself up from the sofa and straightened his clothes.
John watched Sherlock as he slowly slipped from reality and sank into the caverns of his mind. The fire was warm and cast a soft orange glow around the room. John joined Sherlock in closing his eyes and letting his mind wander for a bit. He was somewhat loath to admit that he was actually beginning to relax. Their previous week had been full to the brim with clients, experiments, and one too many late nights filling out paperwork at the Yard. Perhaps it would be nice to take a breather for a while, after all.
John watched out of the corner of his eye as Sherlock sat up straighter in his chair and brought his hands to his chin. He could practically feel the weight of Sherlock’s gaze on him.
“Hey, Harry.”
“Are you listening?”
“It had character.”
It had been almost a fortnight since the conclusion of the supposed clairvoyant case, a blog entry in which John entitled ‘The Adventure of the Pseudo Psychic,’ much to Sherlock’s chagrin. John’s condition had stayed somewhat the same in that time, limited to the slight tunnel vision and loss of coordination that it sometimes caused. He knew that, depending on the patient, the deterioration of sight could accelerate rapidly over just a few weeks, or stretch out to years. Based on his family history, however, he was guessing he had anywhere from a few more weeks to a couple of months before it started to get too bad.
Sherlock tried not to smile.
“Then I think we’re fine, John.”
“I’d gathered that.”
“You have a blog?”
Sherlock nodded, and closed the door behind him after he left.
John rolled his eyes.
“Hamish, your dad's being silly,” he reassured before turning back to Sherlock. “Look, I'm fine. It's probably just a trapped nerve.”
John eagerly took the pills and wiped off his forehead with the cloth, thankful for the cool, damp material to sooth his racing mind.
John laughed under his breath. “Sherlock, come here.” He motioned for Sherlock to come closer.
“Just so,” the taller man agreed.
“Oh, experiment. Best leave those.”
“That…that actually sounds good.”
“You do, don’t you?” John used his free hand to cup the back of Sherlock’s neck and bring him in for a kiss. “Thank you,” he said.
“Goodnight, John.”
Sherlock looked up sharply from his phone as if only just remembering that he was in fact in a public place with other human beings.
“Oh you were, were you? Then I guess you won’t mind if I test the same hypothesis on you,” John said before picking up his own handful of sugar and flinging it onto Sherlock’s face as well.
“Oh, right,” John said. “You did say something about doing experiments at the bar the other night. When you were done…spilling your guts, anyway.”
“John?”
“Because I saw that you needed help, so I helped you,” John answered simply.
“I need you to get this book for me, the one on the paper there,” Sherlock said, pointing absentmindedly to a scrap piece of paper with a title scribbled on it, his eyes still fixed on the computer screen.
“You know what for.”
Sherlock smiled mirthlessly and turned away. “You think you do.”
"Glad I stopped you before you hit publish, then."
“Before you know it you’ll be singing carols at people’s doorsteps,” he said.
“I said it’s fine, Greg.” John bit out, perhaps a bit sharper than he should have.
Sherlock gasped and jumped up in surprise when John’s lips made contact, accidentally pushing John away. “Oh! Sorry. You startled me,” Sherlock said, panting.
“Er…hello.” John grinned bitterly.
“You always leave a DVD lying around after you watch one. It’s hardly a challenge to work out what your current obsessions are.”
Since the medication hadn’t quite kicked in yet, getting himself comfortable still resulted in various pain-filled grunts and groans.
“Git,” John teased.
“You said you’d be home by eight, Sherlock,” John ground out through gritted teeth.
“Unfortunately, yes. Mycroft seems to think that everything I do somehow constitutes as his business.”
John gripped the edge of the counter and took a deep breath. “It’s fine. It’s not like I want to be around them, anyway.”
“Mm?” John was now leaning back in his chair, a white-knuckled hand still practically glued to his left shoulder.
John also shot the waiter an affable grin as he walked away, but his face fell as soon as the man was gone. Sherlock knew that face; brow furrowed, eyes cold, lips set in a firm line. He was in trouble, but that wasn’t going to stop him.
“There’s no Wi-Fi up here, is there?”
“How?”
“Well, I am now mildly concerned about you burning your flat to the ground, so yes.” John took a seat on the coffee table and typed out a message to Mike.
When John found Sherlock in the library, he was sat at a table in the back with a small mountain of books and papers engulfing the laptop that he was furiously typing away at.
“No, tell me what’s wrong. Please,” he practically begged.
“Yes, thank you,” John added.
The doctor ignored him for a moment in favour of pouring his juice, and ended up missing the glass a bit, spilling the liquid onto the table.
John had been awake for a few minutes, staring at the back of Sherlock’s neck and trying to breathe him in, trying to remember what it was like when he could reach out and touch him whenever he pleased.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said.
“C’mon, John, just one pint won’t hurt!” Mike said, playfully clapping John on the shoulder.
Anderson turned to Lestrade for reassurance.
“Yes, so you came in here, I know, and then what happened?” Sherlock asked, barely glancing at Lestrade as he cupped John’s cheek with his hand and tried to get him to say something coherent.
“Never did finish those compositions from last month. Figured it’d give me something to do when the mind-numbing boredom sets in.”
“John!”
“No! He’s not dead!” Sherlock shouted, and the whole room seemed to go quiet.
“How about we watch a film? I reckon a Bond movie,” John said.
“Then why won’t you talk to me?”
“Oh, and, um…” Sherlock trailed off as he crossed the room and began rooting around under the sofa cushions. He retrieved a small gift bag and handed it to John. “For you, as well.”
Jesus Christ. This was just what John needed. He texted back with furious stabs at his phone's keyboard.
a case you can solve, or an experiment you can work on.”
Eight o’clock came and went, but John gave Sherlock the benefit of the doubt and waited a few more minutes.
“Good. That’s good.” John smiled at him.
“Oi, let me sit down first, yeah?” John said. He set his books down on the only space that was devoid of papers and pulled his jacket off his shoulders, letting it fall onto the chair before sitting down. “Right. What’s so urgent, then?”
John dressed himself and padded into the sitting room where Sherlock sat, looking sharp in his usual dress shirt and blazer, with his violin perched against his chest. The doctor swore he hadn’t even taken two steps before Sherlock whipped his bow down and used it to point at John’s sock-covered feet.
"Mm, of course. Lovely," the doctor muttered as he followed his friend downstairs.
John couldn’t help but chuckle, the sound coming out more like a garbled sob, but a laugh felt like just what he needed.
“Exactly. You’re always going on about how I need to ‘rest’ and ‘recharge’ or whatever it is that normal people do, but you’ve practically turned into
“Care?” Sherlock snapped. “Is that it? You think I can’t be considerate for even one moment?”
Wrong.
John ran over to where Sherlock was still sitting up against the wall, his hand painted with splotches of red from the blood steadily dripping from his nose.
He sighed to himself and turned on his side, grabbing a pillow to hold in the crook of his arm in place of the best friend and lover that he’d grown so accustomed to holding.
“It wasn't entirely a lie,” Sherlock said. He motioned to the candle on the table. “There is a small fire in the flat.”
“What did?”
Sherlock smirked as he pulled on his scarf.
“Jesus,” John breathed.
Sherlock shrugged. “I don’t see what you mean.”
“But I want to help! What can
Mike shook his head. “Bloody med students; you’re no fun.”
John ignored the faint fluttering in his chest and leaned forward to grab a biscuit.
“Yes, yes, now let me
Oh, god.
“Nothing, as far as I’m aware.”
“Bloody hell, that’s boring.”
“That’s because people are idiots,” Sherlock stated.
“Oh, yes. He claims to be having visions of the future, premonitions, if you will. A right Oracle of Delphi. I, however, suspect a simple case of hallucinations, and I needed to delve further into what medications or conditions might cause such a reaction.”
“His therapist.”
Sherlock continued his ministrations, massaging the sides of John’s palm, being careful not to press too firmly.
“Did you see him take the other one?”
Without saying a word, Sherlock folded the flannel and placed it atop John’s thigh before reaching for the lotion.
stubborn about taking care of myself,” Sherlock muttered as he headed back to the kitchen to finish making John’s tea.
Realistically, as dares came, it wasn’t too bad. His flat was barely a five minute walk down the street, and the worst part would be the freezing winter air that he’d have to endure for about five seconds before he completely ignored the dare and put his shirt back on anyway. It’s not like they were sober enough to check that he’d actually do it, right?
Slowly and carefully, John turned himself to lie down on his back and fished his phone out of his pocket with his right hand. He pressed Sherlock’s name and prayed that he would pick up, thinking that Lestrade would be his next best option if Sherlock failed to answer.
“Right.” Lestrade bit his bottom lip in thought.  “How about I wrap his left arm around my shoulder,” he said as he reached over to carefully lift John’s arm up. “And you take his other arm.”
For a solid minute, the flat was more silent than John had ever experienced, and he realized that somehow Sherlock not saying anything at all was an even more terrifying prospect.
“Helping me.”
“Your brother still bothering you?” John asked.
“Very funny.” John noticed that Hamish was looking worriedly at his shoulder. While he was still in a fair amount of pain, he had thankfully relaxed enough to move and speak without cringing, and the painkillers he’d taken were bound to be taking effect soon. “Hey, I'm okay, yeah?”
“John, please listen to me. I was trying to say that had I tried to go to sleep, but I hadn't realized how difficult it would be without you there. I had gotten so used to you being there, that I didn’t- I never thought that- what I’m saying is, I see now what I’ve been doing to you. For a self-proclaimed genius, I can be an absolute idiot, and I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Sherlock’s voice was shaking slightly, and John looked to him to find his bottom lip quivering, his eyes watering.
“That kid from your chem class who got in a fight at the bar last week.”
“Yeah, that, thank you.” He nodded.
“And finally, on ten, open your eyes.” Sherlock waited a moment, not only for John to take another deep breath, but to make sure that Lestrade sensed that was his cue to quit prying.
Lestrade immediately obliged, heading downstairs with just a tiny nod of acquiescence. Sherlock had figured that by the time he helped John down the stairs and onto the street, they’d already have a taxi waiting.
“I’m gonna guess that these people are not your friends.”
“Right.” Sherlock nodded minutely and picked his head back up. “Apologies,” he said quietly.
“John,” Sherlock pleaded. John swallowed what he was about to say and looked at Sherlock’s half-silhouetted face, seeing that same expression of concern that he saw earlier. Sherlock really did care, John knew that, even if he did show his care by letting himself into John’s bedroom at three in the morning.
“I am still angry, in case you’re wondering,” John muttered with his eyes already closed and an arm draped over his head.
“Mrs. Hudson told you?”
“Well, there's the obvious fact that you opted to sleep on the sofa last night as opposed to our bed, for one. Then this morning, you waited until I got into the shower to eat breakfast, then you waited until I went into my room before
a human, you’re John!” the detective reasoned.
“Not to me.”
“Ann Marie, you git.” He teased as he shuffled into the kitchen to find something resembling food. To his surprise, Sherlock got up and followed him, his tartan dressing gown waving like a flag in the wind behind him.
“You’re overthinking, John. You do in fact know what you’re doing, and I believe the thousand or so flash cards we just went through can attest to that.”
"And how was Germany?" John quipped.
John put his smaller hands atop Sherlock’s and gently squeezed the other man’s fingers.
John sighed in relief.
“I might not be,” Sherlock said.
“Put your hand on the towel, palm down,” Sherlock said as he opened up the lotion.
It was early morning, the sun just coming up to shine through the windows of Sherlock’s bedroom. He and John were tucked under the covers, John curled up as close to Sherlock as he could be without actually touching him.
It took several unsettling attempts for John to properly flick the kettle on. He'd reached for it, only to find his grip had been just a tad off. He shook his head derisively, opened the cupboard and stood up on his tippy toes.
“Sherlock, it’s not strange to care about the solar system.”
He squinted, continuing to follow the steps until they lead him to the top of a very unfriendly looking hill.
John took one more look at Sherlock’s sleeping face before gently nudging his arm.
Sherlock went uncharacteristically quiet for a moment before sighing dejectedly. “They’re your friends, John.”
“Looks like Sherlock’s up next!” Greg announced as the bottle came to a stop to point at him.
After he hung up, he found that John was smiling at him, practically laughing.
Sherlock put the bow to the strings and began to play, and John suddenly felt as if the entire rest of the world had gone silent. The rich notes being pulled expertly from the strings seemed to echo impossibly within the small room, and John couldn’t seem to do anything but stare in quiet awe.
“And the bruises around her wrists?” Sherlock asked, pointing.
“Sherlock, take me home?” John asked, his voice a hollow shell carved out from his previous anger.
“Oh. And you didn’t go home this year, so—“
“Seriously? How?”
John frowned and continued to stare blankly at the floor. “I don’t like how well the staff know us here, Sherlock,” he said.
When the cab pulled up to 221b, Sherlock paid the driver and hopped out of the car immediately after, rushing over to open John’s door for him. John hoped that his sudden courtesy wouldn’t last for long, because he really didn’t need Sherlock to mollycoddle him.
you. And yet
(Parent!lock) John hurts his shoulder and attempts to hide how much pain he’s in, until Hamish notices that something is definitely not okay.
By the time John had cleared away most of the mess, he could have sworn that his heart was pounding ten times louder in his chest. He finished up with one last cursory sweep of the towel before setting it back down on the counter.
“And you should get a haircut, but you don’t hear me nagging,” John quipped, fluffing the pillow in his chair a bit before sitting down.
“Still not helpful.”
“Well, for one, perhaps you can take less shifts at your job. Maybe just one less shift a week, if that’s possible,” he suggested. “And I can help with your revision so you’ll get it done faster; lord only knows what horribly ineffective methods you’ve been using,” he joked, grinning when he felt John let out a soft chuckle. “And you only practice rugby when you absolutely need to. And you eat more.”
“Oh, I...I don’t know.” Sherlock avoided John’s eye and toyed with his hair.
“This is more fun.”
They watched the film in companionable silence for another few minutes before Sherlock spoke, his voice quiet as if he weren’t sure whether or not he wanted John to hear.
“John,” Sherlock tried again, poking his shoulder lightly. “John, I wanna play pirates,” he told him. “Stop being sick so we can play,” he said grumpily. Maybe if he kept talking to John, eventually he would wake up.
John couldn’t keep his leg from bouncing up and down in apprehension, as it if it were him about to enter the appointment. His mind went back to sitting across from Ella, forcing out the best fake smiles he could come up with. Grimacing, he tossed those thoughts aside and focused on the lanky detective perched in front of him.
“John, I’m sure you were a spectacular idiot, but what did you do?”
“You have no idea,” Sherlock said, raising an eyebrow as he continued to text.
“Look at his shoes, Lestrade. Look at the tatters on the bottoms of his jeans. Look at the mud splatter on the back of his ankle. Come on man, open your eyes! Now, I’ll ask again, where is the cane?”
“And one of those honey-flavoured scones, if you have them,” Sherlock called after her.
“Hm. Lovely.”
“I found your company enjoyable.” Sherlock frowned. “I suppose I didn’t want it to end.”
When he heard him clamber down the steps and close the front door, he turned over to the empty but still warm space next to him.
“Positive? I hear I’m unnaturally warm.”
John knelt down on the floor and reached his arm under his bed. He pulled out a small box that was wrapped in brown paper and tied up, somewhat messily, with string.
John had spent the entire rest of the afternoon at the café with Sherlock. They had talked about everything from Sherlock’s interfering brother to John’s overly strict rugby coach, and John had only left when he realized that the sky outside was beginning to darken, and that biology report of his was not going to finish itself.
“So I’ve gathered.”
“It’s not fine, John.”
When Sherlock moved on to John’s thumb, John’s hand began to shake, causing it to jerk out of Sherlock’s grip.
Sherlock let out a full-bodied laugh at that, his face lighting up in a way John hadn’t seen before. John took a moment to appreciate the sight, being careful not to let his gaze linger too long.
“Yeah?”
“Sherlock, what—“
The shorter man looked down at the broken glass and shoved some away with his foot. He didn't look up at Sherlock when he spoke.
“Hooper,” Sherlock repeated, steepling his hands under his chin in thought. “Does your mother happen to work in the mortuary at St. Bart’s?”
It was now precisely 7:54, however, and there was still no sign of him.
Sherlock was still determined to be helpful, it seemed. Despite his previous anger, however, John was grateful and feeling much better compared to the day before. His jaw didn’t ache nearly as much and it would probably be a lot easier to talk.
John squared his jaw and clenched his fist around the pencil in his hand.
“Well, you two enjoy. It was so nice to meet you, John,” Mrs. Hudson said, giving his shoulder a small squeeze before walking away.
flirting with that barista that one time.”
“Sherlock, don’t,” John warned.
“No, really, I think I’ll take your word for it,” he said as he continued to back away.
“With all due respect, sir, this is a degenerative condition. I don’t think coming in a week or so earlier would’ve hindered its progression.”
“Okay then, what did you eat yesterday?”
“You’re right; I didn’t want anyone’s pity. But you, come on, you have to know.”
“Thanks, Greg," he whispered.
Sherlock let out a breath of frustration. “It was an accident. I didn’t—“
“I know you’ve got a limp, rely on the use of a cane, most likely wounded in action. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help, maybe because he’s an alcoholic, maybe because he’s just left his wife. And I know you’re an army doctor, trained at Bart’s.”
“You’re angry with me again.”
“I’m not stupid, you know,” John said after a few more moments, his hands ever-fidgeting in his lap.
After a few more moments, Sherlock took the hand that wasn’t resting on John’s abdomen and placed it over his ear. He used this hold to tip the doctor’s head back so that it was sitting on his shoulder and the man was essentially staring at the ceiling.
for hours and hours.
“What is it?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at it, ran his finger over it once and looked up to John for an explanation.
John was gently feeling around her arms with latex gloved-hands and filing away the information he gathered. He felt the absurd amount of gaudy jewelry on her wrists, her most likely diamond necklace, and the fact that she had no wedding ring. He then felt the material of her clothing, recognizing it as silk, high quality, if he was right. She had earrings in, her hair felt smooth, and most importantly, John could smell a perfume on her that he recognized. He was certain he’d been with at least three women who wore the same smell out on dates. He sat back on his heels and cleared his throat.
The one thing that John did know was that he was exhausted. The sleep that he’d had in the hospital was fitful at best; being awoken every hour or so from an ache or pain, or to take more medication. It left him feeling groggy and worn out, and all he wanted to do was have an obnoxiously long nap.
“Don’t let the door hit you, Mycroft. And stop talking to Mrs. Hudson about my personal matters; she is not your informant.”
“But you’re— Oh, you’re bisexual! How did I not see that? There’s always something.”
“Yeah, I know,” he chuckled softly. ”But you get the idea. I can’t help it, Sherlock, these thoughts just happen, sometimes.”
“Just relax, John; you’re tired.”
“In the meanwhile,” the doctor continued, “we’ll be putting you on a regiment of vitamin A supplements. This, along with a healthy diet and sufficient amount of sleep may postpone the retinal dystrophy, even if in the slightest bit.” He said, with an obvious attempt at hopefulness in his voice.
By the time John reached the final step to the flat, he was exhausted. The bag over his shoulder felt like it was filled with cement, threatening to weigh him down completely if he didn’t continue moving.
“Retinal dystrophy. Progressive blindness. How did I not see it?
No, he had to stop this. It was just a dream. He was fine now.
“Bit not good, yeah,” John agreed. “You’re right, though. I only really came to terms with it this year. Decided to tell my family, as well, which was a bloody disaster.”
The detective donned his usual all-knowing grin and delved into a lengthy explanation. John just sat back on his heels and listened intently; trying not to focus on the fact that whole room appeared to be covered in a Gaussian blur.
Sherlock took a deep breath and stood a bit taller. He looked John right in the eyes and began to speak.
John pursed his lips in thought, thinking perhaps joining in on another case would be a welcomed distraction from his distress. He knew that his vision was going to do nothing but worsen, and at a faster rate, due to the fact that he was older. And so at that moment, he decided that until it approached the point where he would need assistance, he would try to enjoy his life as normal, or at least as normal as things got around Sherlock. He didn’t want the extra concern, the pity, the classic look of half sympathy, half cluelessness on someone’s face when they heard the news. He didn’t want any of it, at least not yet, and so he got up out of his chair and headed over to his friend.
“Good. That’s good. Hey, I’ll text Mike, see if he’ll lend you his room,” John said, getting out his phone.
“Look,” John said, “I know there’s more we should talk about, but whatever pain meds they’ve got me on must be making me drowsy because I’m almost definitely about to fall asleep again. But just…stay here with me, please? After feeling like you weren’t even there the past few days I just…want to know you’re here.”
Sherlock didn’t answer and was about to rush up the ancient stairs when he was stopped by an authoritative hand from Lestrade.
Sherlock looked thoughtful for a moment before his lip curved up in a small smile.
“It’s Sh- Sh’lock.”
John headed towards his usual table near the back and noticed someone already sitting there. As he walked closer, John immediately recognized the head of dark curls practically buried in a book, one hand holding the book open and one hand furiously scribbling down notes.
John laughed. “You know, this might be a bit forward, but something else that always seems to help me sleep is…having someone else in bed with me.”
Steeling himself in his chair, John took a deep, ragged breath and finally lifted his head to look Sherlock in the eye.
“Ten,” Sherlock said, smirking when he looked up to see that Lestrade had fled, and he could hear him bickering with Anderson down the hall.
“Why?”
“No.”
“They most certainly are, and you’re missing the point.”
“No, not that! His cane!” Sherlock exclaimed, motioning towards the victim.
“Enjoying the view?” Sherlock’s deep, cutting voice was suddenly right in John’s ear, and he jumped back a good distance in surprise.
“I saw him put the pill in his mouth, but I think that’s all he did. He didn’t swallow it. I noticed that and I was about to spit mine out but then he shoved his hand over my mouth and forced my head back until I
“And yes, I am,” Sherlock added.
“What?”
“John,” Sherlock repeated.
Hamish looked pensive for a moment. “Um, I changed my mind. I don't care about being tall.”
, remember?” He snapped, shaking his head before Sherlock could answer and retreating back to his tea making.
“It was all right,” Sherlock said, evidence of a smile still lingering on his face.
“Well yeah, I’m sure it was hilarious. You were
“I was a bloody klutz, Sherlock. I should’ve been paying more attention, but I was angry.”
“She called me a coward,” John said, his voice shaking lightly. “She said that the only reason I hadn’t come out sooner was because I saw how bad she had it after she came out. She was right. My parents treated her like shit, people at school gave her hell; of course I didn’t want to go through that. I was scared,” John admitted. “But she also thinks I didn’t say anything just so that I could be the ‘good son,’ the golden boy, you know? She thinks my staying in the closet was somehow…throwing her under the bus.”
Sherlock shook his head and took a deep breath. He
John typed out a message and hesitated for a moment before hitting send.
John laughed wholeheartedly and gave Sherlock a peck on the cheek. “Very funny, love.”
“John,” Sherlock repeated, his voice coming in louder that time. He must have still been sitting across from him this whole time, John thought.
“Ah, good!” Sherlock grinned. “I trust you know where you are, correct?”
Sherlock wrinkled his nose in disgust when he walked into the sitting room to find his brother reclining in the red armchair, twirling an umbrella on the rug.
“You were recently in the throes of a night terror, so I woke you,” he stated simply.
Sherlock looked sheepishly down at the floor.
“Well, you are. You are one of the bravest people I’ve ever met. You are kind, loving, and ridiculously patient. Not to mention thoughtful, understanding, and pretty damn smart to boot,” he said with a soft smile.
"I'm no doctor, but I’d perhaps prescribe getting some extra shut-eye."
Lestrade took a deep breath. “We were doing the same thing that we were doing in the room with you; looking over the photos of the other victims, but you said you needed space to ‘think’ remember?”
Sherlock nodded and got up to join John next to the fire.
Sherlock frowned. “You’re not that much older than me.”
“What’s that s’posed to mean?”
“I can’t,” John argued. He could no longer take a full breath without his insides feeling like they were quivering.
“Daddy?” it was Hamish, and there was clearly something wrong; his voice was far too quiet.
“I want you to feel my hand, and tell me what you can deduce about me just by using your sense of touch.”
John nodded, not even attempting to speak anymore.
Their latest case, though, had finally ended the night before, and John was determined to get things back to the way they were. He took a deep breath and slowly slipped his hand around Sherlock’s waist, stopping to rub small circles on his navel.
John did as he was told, taking a deep, shaky breath.
“Yes, that’s extraordinary.”
“Hey, what’s this?” he asked, pointing to the instrument.
“Yeah, just...painful.” He took as deep a breath as he could and attempted to sit up more, clearly struggling with the motion. Sherlock wished desperately that there was something he could do to make John’s pain go away instantly.
Wait, why was Greg pulling over?
“I’m not sure I like the sound of that.”
“I’m not.”
Sherlock only continued to retch in response. John decided to push back Sherlock’s hair a bit when he saw that his fringe was falling over his eyes.
“Come on, Sherlock, I don’t think they’re
By midmorning, John was already halfway done with a book, but would have been three quarters of the way done if he hadn’t kept looking up from the sofa at Sherlock, who was busy sorting through various leaves on the kitchen table.
“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” John asked, elbowing Sherlock playfully.
“Are you following me now?” Sherlock grumbled.
“Same here!” Molly piped in.
“Why?”
Most students had long gone home by the time John and Sherlock walked out of the library, leaving empty shells of the halls and classrooms that they passed on their way. They had ended up talking for hours, John easily pushing his work to the side in favour of listening to Sherlock tell him more about his experiments.
For a moment, John felt as if he were back at the bar the night he met Sherlock, when he had held onto John in the taxi and hadn’t seemed to want to let him go. It almost seemed as if the only time Sherlock expressed a need for affection was when his defenses were down, and John wondered just how often Sherlock craved this sort of touch, and if he ever even admitted to himself that it was something that he wanted.
“That one’s for my mum, actually. I know I told you how she left when I was six, so I don’t remember her much, but she’d always tell me I was brave, usually for something silly like sleeping without a nightlight. Used to call me her little lion all the time.”
Martin had in Nativity!
Once everything was ordered and ready, John made his way back to their booth and set everything on the table before sitting back down.
“So like, crime solving?”
“So why didn’t you say anything? Why just leave me sitting there?“
Sherlock arrived at the hospital the moment visiting hours began. He gave the description of the man; short, blond hair like sand, a light checkered shirt and dark blue jeans, and the woman at the front desk confirmed that he had been rushed in the night before. Sherlock was denied his name and access to his room, but all it took was a flash of Mycroft’s card, and before he knew it, Sherlock Holmes was on his way to see Doctor John Watson.
John noticed the way Sherlock’s long, spindly fingers would tighten minutely around the magazine when he seemed to be having a thought. He saw the detective actually brush stray strands of his chocolate brown hair away from his face. He ended up becoming a bit entertained with trying to determine the exact shade of blue or green that Sherlock’s eyes were. John was knocked out of his trance when the secretary told them that the therapist was ready to see Sherlock. The taller man plopped his reading material down and strode purposefully down the corridor.
It didn’t take long for the shorter man to be ushered onto a stretcher with an oxygen mask practically glued to his face. Sherlock watched as he was rushed into an ambulance and taken away. He and Lestrade stood on the stoop of the house, watching the vehicle race down the street.
“You are upset, though,” Sherlock continued, “I’m obviously not wrong. And going by the way you tossed your coat I’d say it’s something rather serious, or personal, perhaps. Could it still be the night terrors, the lack of sleep?”
“Very funny.”
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked as he sliced through the taut rope with a pocket knife.
“You said that was why you were staying here for the holiday, which was obviously a lie.”
“You could never slow me down, John. If you were bed-bound with a broken leg I would bring the case to you, you know that.”
“Well, I’d actually rather not talk about—“ John started, but was cut off when the alarm on his phone started to go off. “Shit, practice starts in ten minutes,” he said, scooping his things into his bag in a flurry before practically jumping out of his chair. “Thanks for, y’know, helping me revise and everything,” he said as he slid his jacket back on.
John stopped in his tracks and shot daggers at his boyfriend. That was a low blow, even for Sherlock.
Sherlock hummed in response and went to the kitchen to flick the kettle on.
“Okay, let’s see. I was on my way back from, er…from uh...”
“That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, okay? I should’ve done this way earlier,” he motioned to the sitting room, “come on, sit down with me, use your inside voice,” he joked, “and I’ll, I’ll tell you everything.”
The sunset was just beginning to fade when John stepped out of the lecture hall. He adjusted his hoodie and rubbed at his tired eyes as he walked, looking forward to going back to his flat and enjoying a cup of tea in front of the telly before starting any actual work.
“Oh, for the love of…” John trailed off as he carelessly tossed the useless phone aside. He reasoned that even if it hadn’t broken, there wasn’t a chance in hell he would have gotten a signal anyway.
“Yes, and we need to head out as soon possible.” Sherlock snatched John’s coat off the back of the door and tossed it to him.
Please read: Because every chapter is completely unrelated to the previous one, I'll be putting the trigger warnings for each story in the chapter summary so please be sure to read those beforehand.
“I would too, Jesus,” John gaped, reading a bit more. “So that’s why he came to you? And you—how d’you suppose it’s possible? If it even is.”
The sound of sirens interrupted the conversation, and it was if the entire room let out a sigh of relief.
Sherlock couldn’t deny the growing worry that crept up on him after following the footprints for almost thirty minutes and not seeing nor hearing any sign of John.
“Anytime, John. M’glad you’re okay. But if you ever need help again, I’m just a call or text away, yeah?”
Sherlock smiled. “If you insist.”
“Having fun?” John asked.
“Just staying in here to make sure you're all right, obviously.”
“What do I
“You revising?”
“Well, you were severely dehydrated, which caused your veins to be significantly smaller, thus making it harder for the nurse to find a good place to insert the IV, which of course—“
“Pity, I was beginning to like that particular shade of oatmeal.”
Sherlock bit his bottom lip in thought and stared at the instrument. “Well, I suppose I could play something,” he said, kneeling down to drag the case out from its hiding spot. “Not sure how familiar you are with classical, though.”
“It’s okay,” John said slowly. “I need you too, you git,” he added, his mouth forming a smile. “I need you…us, to be safe.”
Sherlock was standing on the sidelines, keeping a wary eye on John in the event that he slipped and fell on the damp grass.
John laughed and winced as his shoulder protested with another cry of pain.
Sherlock helped get a shower ready for John and knocked on the bathroom door every few minutes to make sure he was okay. And at around ten o’clock, John went off to bed, leaving Sherlock with an unresolved feeling churning in the pit of his stomach.
Sherlock and John had spent almost the entire day together, and Sherlock hadn’t acted any different than usual, making all of John’s anxieties from earlier that morning seem to fade away, and he ended the night feeling more relaxed and content than he had in a long time.
Sherlock and John danced around each other in an uncomfortable silence for the rest of the night. Sherlock made dinner, deciding to forego the pasta and make soup instead since it would be easier for John to eat.
“Oh, don’t be like that; we’re only here for one more day.”
“Y’know, I know something you could do to warm them up,” John said cheekily.
“Have a lot of experience with pistols, do you?”
“What? It’s not my fault he’s a bloody pervert.”
“Then what are you doing?”
“Sometimes I think I’m over it, y’know?” John asked slowly. “Like, that’ll be the last one, for sure. As if I have any say in the matter.” He shrugged, still not looking at Sherlock.
“Hm? No, I jus’ got up. Was he asking about the case?”
“Obviously.”
“You heard Lestrade and I?” Sherlock asked carefully.
Sherlock was back at the kitchen table, scribbling frantically in a notebook and not acknowledging John in the slightest, just as he’d been doing the entire trip.
“Please, John,” Sherlock scoffed. “People don’t befriend the freak genius because they want to; they do it to get a free biochemistry tutor.”
“Sherlock, I’m leaving in a year. Who knows how few and far between my leaves are gonna be, or when I’ll get to see you again. And, Christ, I want to see you all the time. I miss you when you’re in class, I miss you when you go pretend to get the milk, and I’m gonna miss you when I’m gone. I got this tattoo to remind me of you. Do you get what I’m saying?”
Now, after having run back down the path as fast he could, he was kneeling in front of the barely conscious form of John, attempting to ascertain what his injuries were. What Sherlock could tell in the low light was that John had tripped, quite badly, it seemed, and there was almost certainly something wrong with his ankle going by the way that his foot was twisted.
“Let me, no. Try to stop me, yes.”
“John, there’s another bedroom upstairs," he said, still standing by the door.
“Uh, yeah, sleeping really…takes it out of me. Where’d you go?” John asked.
John chuckled bitterly. “You know it’s true, though. Look at how I’ve been in the last week; I can barely tell where I’m going half the time. I’m dropping my job at the surgery tomorrow, not that I’ve been working much as of late anyway. I’m going to need to start learning braille, and thinking about other career options—“
"Ah! Jesus!" John jumped, effectively knocking a mug right off the shelf and sending it crashing to the floor. John pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration, trying to ignore the shattered glass pooling at his feet.
“Oh.”
It was nearly closing time by the time Sherlock and John left the café. They had spent the last few hours talking and laughing in between bites of scone and sips of coffee. John had shared his most embarrassing dating experiences while Sherlock had shared his dreams of being a pirate that he’d had as a child. John hadn’t realized how much time had passed until Mrs. Hudson was practically shooing them out the door.
John’s tunnel vision had worsened a bit over the past day or so. It was now incredibly difficult for him to see out of his peripheral, but he learned to adjust, turning his head around at just the right angles so he could take everything in. He began to stare a bit at his friend, who had been eyeing the same magazine page for a good thirty minutes by then.
"Oh, yes, fine. I was just using your laptop, you left your blog open. The entry is unfinished; you stopped mid-sentence. Why?" the detective questioned.
“Difficult?” John shot back, suddenly taking on a tenser undertone. “I’m going bloody blind, for Christ’s sake!” he practically shouted, his voice breaking a bit at the end when he realized that was the first time he’d officially stated his situation, having not even admitted it to himself. He squeezed his eyes shut and put a palm to his face.
Sherlock looked to John and frowned at the deep purple and red bruising that crept along John’s jawline, leading up to the now bandaged cut near his temple. The bruising made it difficult for him to move his jaw, making it a challenge to eat and speak. The worst of John’s injuries, however, was his ankle, which he’d severely sprained when he’d fallen. He was going to have to wear a brace and use crutches for a solid few weeks, which Sherlock knew John was dreading since John loathed inactivity almost as much as Sherlock did.
“I am, actually. So, what terrible film are we watching first?”
“Sorry?”
“In a nutshell, yes.”
“Well?” he asked.
? I’m not some adolescent girl pining after her Romeo from the balcony alright? And has it even occurred to your overinflated ego that I’m not staring at
“I did. I don’t know if I do anymore, though. There’s Italian food in the fridge, please eat some.”
The black jeep pulled slowly up to the small, humble cabin hidden away in the snowy woods. Sherlock parked the car on the gravel driveway and turned to John.
Mycroft stood and tapped his umbrella on the floor.
“I’m not trying to be your therapist, Sherlock; I’m trying to be your friend.”
“I don’t understand.”
Everyone in the room was looking to John, who was still giving his medical assessment of the situation. He seemed to be taking longer than usual, and was squinting his eyes desperately at the body of the woman in front of him.
Lestrade had his arms crossed patiently across his chest, Sally had her hands resting on her hips in anticipation, and Sherlock was crouched next to the body of a recent murder victim, steepling his fingers under his chin, and looking at John.
He narrowed his eyes. “I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. My guys did a sweep of the place while we were upstairs. There was nothing.”
“What?”
John had to take a moment to right himself as well, and thought hard about how he would go about this.
“Well, you know, I'm an idiot, after all,” John said, smiling.
whose love for hurt!John always inspires me to write! You guys should go and check her blog out too! ^^
Greg scoffed. “That’s ‘cause the git can never be arsed to remember my name. Hell, most of the time he can’t even be arsed to remember I live there. How do
The fire was glowing bright, sending warm orange lights flickering off the walls. John sat himself down in front of it, crossing his legs and staring into the heat.
John flinched, suddenly back in reality. Time seemed to speed up around him as he looked back at Sherlock for the first time in what felt like hours.
“Just wait." Sherlock held out a hand, trying to look away naturally but still keep an eye on him in his peripheral.
When he looked into the sitting room, John saw that Sherlock was already up and engrossed in something on his laptop. John decided to make himself some porridge, though he did need a bit of help carrying his bowl and glass of juice across the room so he could sit in his armchair and watch the news.
“Busy?”
“That’s not the point.” John opened his eyes to look at Sherlock standing across from him, his arms folded behind his back and a look of frustration in his eyes.
But Sherlock paid him no mind. They needed to talk about this and John had been avoiding the subject for far too long.
“Yeah. Just Evans and I think Bennett got out. I had to see to Evans’ injuries.” John’s voice trailed off, and he turned his head away from Sherlock.
John rubbed Sherlock’s back soothingly as he was sick. He didn’t quite know why he felt an almost instinctive urge to care for him; he hardly knew him apart from occasionally passing him on the way to class.
“’Course I can walk!” Sherlock asserted. He quickly jumped up from John’s embrace and stood before fumbling like a penguin slipping on ice.
Sherlock kept his eyes cast downward as he spoke. “I thought I might get that out in the open now in case you disapprove of such things.”
“Five.”
“And why don’t you stop flashing my card at every locked gate you encounter? My name is not a get out of jail free card, Sherlock.”
John had changed his outfit as well, deciding to go for a nice navy blue jumper with a maroon button-up underneath, and a slightly tattered pair of dress shoes that looked much better in comparison to his scuffed up trainers.
“Truth. Not that you’d ever be able to tell if I were lying to you, anyway.”
“And they just, what, let you pop on over to a crime scene whenever you fancy?”
John pulled back and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s, feeling comfort with those soft curls tickling his skin.
John hit the ground with brutal force. His movements had come to a halt but when he opened his eyes, everything around him appeared to be spinning. His entire right side felt awash in searing pain, pain that he couldn’t even fathom yet with his mind still trying to comprehend the shock of the fall itself. He groaned and shut his eyes tight, attempting to bring back the wind that’d been so thoroughly knocked out of him.
“Deduce.”
Sherlock smiled back, putting away his notes for the night. He got up and tucked the blanket better around John.
“Excuse me?
Shaking himself from that line of thought, John figured that if Sherlock wasn’t going to get up any time soon, John would just have to give him a little push.
The doctor just let out a low growl and put a hand over his eyes. Sherlock stopped short, and slowly turned to face his friend. He cleared his throat awkwardly.
the text started.
John bit his lip, thinking.
Just then, John noticed Mrs. Hudson herself out of the corner of his eye, making her way to them with coffee pot in hand and a floral apron tied around her waist.
Well, there was no hiding anything now.
“I almost thought you wouldn’t come, actually. Greg was pretty surprised to see you here, too,” John told him.
“No. Yes. No. He’s alive!” He exclaimed, “There’s a pulse but it’s barely there; he’s hardly breathing.” Sherlock looked up to Lestrade. “What are you just standing there for? Get an ambulance!”
“That’s not a gingerbread man,” John said, pointing to whatever it was that Sherlock had crafted out of the dough.
told that apparently it meant John
“Yeah, you did,” John said. “Where is it?”
“Okay, good. Now, let’s see if we can make it through the crowd without toppling over, yeah?”
-------------
John was quickly running out of breath as he tried to keep up with Sherlock, who only continued to speed down the pavement ahead of him.
“Oh, yes. So I’d just come from the therapist. I was in a right strop, you know. Can’t remember why, but that anger apparently guided me all the way to a pub. And…Jesus, I…” John trailed off, holding a hand to his face. He put his palm over his mouth as a worried look appeared in his eyes.
When everything was cleaned up and put away, Sherlock went to start up the fireplace. John went to the sofa and grabbed his coat to hang up properly.
John turned on his side to face the wall and closed his eyes tightly as if he could force himself to sleep just by closing his eyes tightly enough. But John’s face quickly softened when he heard the tendrils of music flowing up from downstairs. Sherlock must be working on those compositions, John thought.
“I'll go check on him. Just stay here for a moment, all right?” he asked. Hamish hugged his bee tighter and nodded.
“Mm, we’ve all got that part hm? I only wish, Dr. Watson, that you’d come to me sooner. You’re already displaying signs of tunnel vision and night blindness.” He said as he checked over his notes.
“It’s um,” John started, “it’s for you.”
“Look, guys, I’ve had a great time, but—“
Sherlock glared at the now empty space in front of him and bit his lip in quiet frustration. “Good,” he said, “perhaps you can take her out on one of those date things some time; I’m sure she’d prove more interesting than your last paramour. What was it, Annabeth? MaryAnn?”
Lestrade entered the room in a bit of a tizzy, seeming slightly dazed as he noticed how neat the place was looking. Before the man could get a word out of his mouth, Sherlock put a finger to his lips, telling him to shush. He stepped forward so that he could talk to Lestrade quietly.
“You really don’t, John, for the most part. It’s not like trying to quit cigarettes, so don’t think it is. You went through a traumatic experience. It would be strange if you
“What, that’s it then?”
“A-all right.” John tried to take a deep breath, not fully succeeding, but feeling better that he at least tried.
“Christ, it hurts,” he breathed. He sounded as if he was fighting back tears. Sherlock didn’t know if he’d seen him in such a bad way before.
“Do what?” Sherlock asked as he pulled on his greatcoat.
“Wait hold on, why’d you need to know that? Are you—are you typing up the case on my blog?” he asked, his voice high in pitch with concern.
“Just rest, you’ll be fine.”
Sherlock just let out a dry laugh and looked back at his notes. They sat in companionable silence for a while. John nibbled on his food and Sherlock scribbled on his papers and marked up crime scene photos. Eventually the doctor finished and went so far as to wash his dishes and set them to dry. Sherlock looked up at him when he sat back down again.
He perched himself up on his elbows, and spit out the blood that had dripped from his nose and down to his lips. He groaned at his terrible luck and reached a sore arm into his back pocket to grab his phone. He pressed Sherlock’s name and held the mobile to his ear.
“Other than not wanting to be mollycoddled, which I wouldn’t have done, I see no reason.”
?” Sherlock asked anxiously.
Seb wrinkled his nose in distaste before stomping off back down the field, muttering under his breath as he went.
bothered right from the start. You remember at that first crime scene, I offered to go get everyone coffee?”
“Afternoon, Sebastian,” Sherlock said.
“Quiet, I need to think now,” Sherlock said, waving John off.
“Angry with yourself?”
“Then what, pray tell, is the point?”
“Thank you for reminding me,” John quipped.
“John? I know you’re not sleeping. Please let me in.”
John swallowed hard, attempting to ease the unexpected tightness in his throat. He’d never actually said the words out loud; even Mike only knew that there had been some kind of fight with Harry, but he didn’t know the details.
He stepped inside the library and felt the familiar hush of the world around him; the only sounds coming from the faint tapping of fingers on keys and the quiet shuffle of pages turning. The sun had gone down whilst John was in class and the soft glow of scattered desk lamps gave the space an air of comfort and warmth that he always appreciated after hours in a lecture hall.
“It’s all right, just let it out,” John soothed.
Now John was frowning down at his notebook page overflowing with colour-coded scribbles, looking over the information for approximately the fiftieth time. He did know the material, practically by heart at this point, but sometimes he couldn’t help but feel like if he stopped revising, everything he knew would suddenly fall right out of his head.
“We should probably get you cleaned up and put some ice on that,” John said. “And then we can go and get that coffee. If you still want to, that is.”
“Get off me!” Seb shouted.
John turned to Sherlock who was leaning back against the bar, tapping away on his phone.
Sherlock chuckled lightly under his breath.
“No, there’s a man half alive who’s got memories, and he can lead us right to the killer.”
“Come on, I want to hear you play,” John said, taking a seat on the edge of the bed. “I bet you’re a bloody virtuoso or something.”
“It was textbook,” Sherlock corrected.
“For me, yes. You were the one who talked me through the biology report that you haven’t actually written yet.”
John sighed and let his head fall into his hand. He could feel the cool sweat from his forehead on his palm as he willed his racing heartbeat to slow. This was the third time he’d woken up in such a state that night.
Sherlock stopped short and turned sharply on his heel, his face suddenly inches from John’s. “Why do you always insist on appointing yourself the role of my personal therapist?” he seethed.
John had just left his last lecture for the day and was on his way back to his flat to get a bit of revising in before rugby practice when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He shuffled his books to his other arm and fished out his phone to find a text from an unfamiliar number.
John tried to walk further, but didn’t get very far before his knees buckled and he landed with a weak thud on the grass.
“Uh, just a little…disagreement with someone at uni. Nothing to worry about.”
“Are those the case details?” Sherlock asked, pointing to the folder in Lestrade’s hand.
’. And I didn’t find it fascinating in Afghanistan either, when—“ the doctor stopped, steeling himself and taking a deep breath.
Kneeling down next to the sofa, Sherlock reached out and carefully ran his fingers through John’s muddied hair, feeling as if it was the first time that he’d truly looked at John’s face since they’d arrived. He hated the scrapes and dried blood that ran down John’s cheek, hated the bruise that was beginning to form under his eye, hated how John looked pained even when unconscious, but mostly, he hated himself for causing all of this in the first place.
let me look at your stuff!” Damn it, the kid was too smart for his own good.
Sherlock grabbed his coat and scarf while John stared with his fist still clenched and lips still quivering uncontrollably.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry.”
“Of course you are.”
You have no idea how hard it was to not say "gingerbeaker" lol. Hope you enjoyed! ^^
“Didn’t know you liked sport, unless you just came down here to stare at a bunch of blokes’ arses, eh?”
For a moment, he and Sherlock stood silently in the middle of the pavement as people walked by and got on with their days. John hoped they hadn’t made much of a scene.
“What’s not to understand? You’ve been working an ungodly amount of hours recently and it’s making you miserable. I wanted to help. Is that…not good?”
“Then why won’t you look at me?”
“He gave me a choice,” John said with his voice beginning to shake. He was still looking off into the distance as he spoke. “There was a good pill, and a bad pill. I got to choose which to take. And whichever one I didn’t choose, he would take.”
John hummed in understanding. “Bit overprotective, is he?”
“Your limp. I’ve just noticed, it’s obviously at least partly psychosomatic. So, a war veteran recently invalided home with a problem like that, of course you’ve got a therapist. You don’t seem the congenial type, no offense, and based off of my observations from your phone earlier I suspect you’re not close to your family. So then where else would you be going?”
John made a ‘hmph’ noise and pushed himself up into a sitting position. He rubbed at his stiff neck and stretched his back, eliciting a series of satisfying cracks that he knew always grated on Sherlock’s nerves.
“Mm.”
“Never mind, go on.”
John took a moment to steel himself before he walked determinedly over to Sherlock and stopped only a few inches from him.
John smiled.
“Oh for Christ’s sake, can we hurry this up?” Sherlock snapped.
The sun had gone down outside Baker Street, and Sherlock was sat on his bed in his dimly lit room, in the middle of his traditional read-through of John’s most recent blog post. They had finished the case earlier in the day and, despite John having gotten into a nasty brawl with the murderer and taking quite the blow to his shoulder, he’d still pushed through and typed up his blog.
Sherlock gave a noncommittal hum of approval, likely already absorbed in the movie in his quest to find its mistakes.
“I bet if you were a doctor, you could do all that stuff yourself and then you’d get better even faster,” he whispered. He still wanted to talk to John, even if the boy couldn’t respond. He’d just talk quieter so he wouldn’t wake him.
After the wind was thoroughly knocked out of him, John gasped for air, and the large man took the liberty of nicking John’s watch.
“You seem to be having a considerable number of those lately.”
“Haven’t done the paperwork.”
For the umpteenth time that night, John angrily hurled his body toward the other side of the bed, foolishly thinking that somehow facing another direction would make the horrific, jumbled mess in his head disappear.
“Mm…m’sorry,” John mumbled.
John tried to quell the negative thoughts that began to rumble like his own personal thunderstorm in his head, but another boom of thunder, louder that time, went off and John knew that he was not going to escape the panic that was swelling in his chest.
He thought for a minute, realizing he must have fallen asleep to the telly the previous evening, and remembered just how tuckered out he was after they’d returned from Scotland Yard. He was usually at least awake enough to make it to his own bed, but he supposed their last case had just tired him out more than usual.
“Oh, is that right? Well in that case I’ve just bought Park Lane and Mayfair and you may not pass ‘Go’! Now get out of my flat!”
“Oh? And what do you propose we do, then?”
“Oh, um, thank you,” John said, taking it out of his outstretched hand. “You really could’ve kept it, you know, I didn’t mind.”
John closed his eyes for a moment and breathed, trying not to dwell on the stress that had been building in his chest all night.
“Right, well, I’m sorry the dog wasn’t the criminal mastermind you were hoping for.”
“You’ve misspelled ‘jewels.’” Sherlock pointed to the screen.
“Sorry, what are we doing?” John asked.
“He had a panic attack, as if it weren’t obvious. Something at the scene or something in the photos you were looking at must have set him off, though I’m not sure exactly what. And I can’t work a case that could potentially trigger him at any moment.”
John brought the box back out to the sitting room and held it out to Sherlock.
-------------
“I’m not upset.”
Instead of sitting down, or playing a celebratory tune on his violin, the taller man went to stand by the desk with his back to John, looking somewhat sheepish.
“No, Sherlock, it’s…thank you. I’ll be very sore and grumpy for a while but I should be better after a good rest, maybe a hot bath, when I can make the trek to the loo without cringing. You don’t have to worry, okay?”
Sorry if this is a bit OOC, I started writing this a while ago and have been adding to it on and off, so I'm not sure how well it will read.
“Have you ever known me to do something I don’t want to do?”
“I’m giving you a hand massage, obviously,” Sherlock said.
Even with John’s quick reassurance of his stability, Sherlock helped him up from the floor and wrapped a supporting arm around his waist.
“Thank you,” he said.
Sherlock continued to rub John’s ankle and make commentary about bees until he heard John start his usual soft snoring noises. The evening might not have gone exactly as he'd intended, but he didn't mind, because just being with John was always enough.
After only a half an hour of boredom, spent texting Lestrade details and going over notes from the other victims, Dr. Watson began to stir. Sherlock looked up in surprise, tucking his phone away. He stood, took off his Belstaff and laid it aside.
“Right, looks like you’re stuck with me for the next few weeks, then.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock mumbled, clearly still engrossed in whatever argument he was having with his brother.
“Because you were puking for a while there and I hardly think that’s something you’d want to do standing up. We should get up now, though. Do you think you can walk?”
“Oh yeah! That’s Jeff! I see ‘im everywhere; that man never stops working, I tell you. We were mates not too long ago, well, I s’pose it’s long ago now. He’s the one who got me into this dreadful business!”
That’s odd, Sherlock thought, John would always come and unlock the door for him. Hesitating a bit, Sherlock pulled the door open and stepped inside.
“Oh, right,” John mumbled, looking at his chair and finding the remote wedged between the cushions. He flicked off the TV and went back to staring at the fire.
After almost getting his rusted key jammed in the lock for the umpteenth time, John pushed open the ancient door to his flat and made his way up the steps. He could hear the muffled din of the television through the walls which could only mean that Mike was in and was likely in the middle of one of those trashy dramas he was so fond of.
John chuckled. Sherlock turned his hand over so that his palm was facing upwards and pressed both of his thumbs into the center of John’s palm, massaging slowly and gently. He then moved on to John’s fingers, where he rubbed small circles on them from top to bottom.
After John was finished with his food, he tidied up the coffee table a bit and turned the lights all the way off so that the only light in the room was coming from the television screen. He grabbed one of the many blankets surrounding him and Sherlock and pulled it up over their laps.
“Medics are on their way, and no I didn’t tell them to speed," he said.
“Mike, is that- do we know him?” John asked, slapping at his friend’s shoulder to get his attention.
Sherlock shuffled back over to resume his post by John’s bed and sighed sadly. He supposed he would just have to wait, then. Mycroft would approve of that; what was that word he always used? Patience? It sounded boring, but if John needed rest then Sherlock would let him rest.
“Sherlock, stop,” John pleaded, clawing weakly at Sherlock’s sleeve.
did not want Sherlock asking about, but that one was further down on his chest and relatively small, so he’d just try to hide it by leaning forward a bit more and shielding it from view.
On top of it all, John hadn’t so much as had one orgasm since their relationship became strained. He’d come home exhausted from work, then be disappointed that Sherlock wasn’t home, then angry with himself for not speaking up, and then he’d just end up falling into a fitful sleep.
“That’s good; you can decorate the tree with Mycroft next year.”
“Not exactly,” John said as he sat down, grateful for the warm fire next to him. “Look, I’m sorry I snapped at you earlier.”
John decided to ignore how odd the situation was and felt around Sherlock’s fingernails, surprised at how smooth and well taken care of they were.
“I’ll have the um, the er, the—“
“Sorry?”
“Oh, right.” John sat for a moment, staring into the dark. “Oh…
trying to get a free biochemistry tutor, do you?”
“What? Why?”
“True, there is possibly a serial killer on your trail,” Sherlock said indifferently.
“Maybe I should be the one apologizing, then,” he said. “I just left and didn’t even let you explain.”
John didn't know why, but his heart sank at the mention of his armchair having been burned. He'd never been much of a sentimental person, but damn it, he liked that chair. Sherlock texted him again before he could even think of what to say in response.
And you may not believe me, but I do need you, however much my actions might lead you to believe otherwise at times. I would never want to intentionally cause you harm, physically or…emotionally. I’m sorry, John.”
John and Greg were on their way back from the latest wild goose chase that Sherlock had sent them on, ending up with nothing, as they'd feared. Sometimes John thought that Sherlock sent them on these little missions just to get he and Lestrade out of the way for a while so he could do something that Lestrade would not approve of.
Great.
The doctor covered himself lazily with the duvet and closed his eyes.
-------------
Lestrade turned, and Sherlock grabbed one of the team’s lights and practically leapt up the stairs.
“Hm? No. I don’t eat when I’m on a case, slows me down.”
“Of course you are. There’s water here, and I’m making tea, even though I know you won’t drink it, but you’ll complain if I don’t make it because it’s the gesture that counts, right?”
“She likes you. For some reason.”
“Am I that obvious?” John asked.
“You’re still angry with me,” he said.
“Here,” John said, handing the cardigan to Sherlock. “I did say you could borrow it.”
John shook his head. “Let’s just go to bed, yeah? We’ll discuss blanket arrangements some other time.”
John nodded, paused for a moment and pursed his lips. “The thing is, I’m going to need a new walking stick.” He stated.
“Here. I, er, I got something for you. I know we didn’t say anything about getting gifts or any of that but I just…thought it might be nice.”
John sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “So what did you learn from the therapist, then? Is our client really a clairvoyant or a proper nutter?”
Sherlock had the evening all planned out.
“It was an experiment,” Sherlock repeated.
As soon as Sherlock turned around, John strolled out of the kitchen and into the sitting room, rubbing at his eyes as he threw Sherlock’s coat off his armchair.
“Oh, well, I’d assumed you wouldn’t appreciate that at the moment.”
“A what?” Sherlock asked as he munched on a biscuit.
“Calmer?”
John tried to mull all this over in his head as he looked out the window.
The line rang out a few times, making John wonder if she was going to answer at all before she finally picked up.
John was only half listening to the rest of the detective’s slew of deductions, as he was too busy smirking at the fact that Sherlock had actually said ‘us.’
“How about your back? They slammed you down pretty hard.”
“Retinitis pigmentosa.” John said as explanation. Sherlock’s mouth made a small ‘O’ in realization.
“And look, everything’s still safe and sound,” John said, gesturing to Sherlock’s things all still in their place.
“He cheated at his own game. Interesting. A bit psychotic. Still clever.”
He told himself, as he absentmindedly brushed his teeth, that he would have to tell Sherlock and his friends and family very soon, within the week, actually. Sherlock had already begun to suspect something was seriously amiss, and John had practically begged Lestrade to let Sherlock on a case to distract him.
In that time, John had also continued to attempt to memorize the faces of the people close to him. He would bid Lestrade a tad longer farewell, would hug Mrs. Hudson just a fraction of a second more, and even opted to visit Harry on one weekend. And then there was Sherlock, who he would sometimes stare at for long intervals when the detective was invested in some book, or John’s laptop, more often. He looked at Sherlock the most out of anyone, wanting desperately to keep the image of his eccentric best friend as crisp and fresh in his mind as he could.
“Is it?”
“Sh’lock,” he mumbled, his voice husky with sleep.
“No, you are not doing this right now. Why don’t you stop using your position in government to work your way around a diet and use it to accomplish something of importance?”
Thanks so much for reading! :D
It took a few minutes of maneuvering for Sherlock to cut through the rope without cutting John, and as soon as his wrists were free, John fell limply onto Sherlock’s shoulder and let out a long, exhausted sigh.
“Because you know as well I do that it comes with the territory. If you want to avoid danger then you may as well stop going on cases altogether. Or shall I just stick to solving domestic love affairs from now on? Though in saying that, those can get quite gruesome, as well.”
“I borrowed them.”
The man said nothing, and for a quick second, John felt relief when one of his arms was released. Unfortunately, with how weak his vision was around the edges, he didn’t see the fist come flying right at his face.
“Okay, deal. But you have to promise to eat better too, mister ‘digestion slows me down.’ Agreed?”
“He probably misses you.”
“Clearly didn’t sleep well last night.”
“Your brother books you a trip when he thinks you’re about to bloody relapse?”
John frowned in confusion for a moment before typing out a reply.
Sherlock gave him the ‘obviously’ glare and sauntered off to his bedroom.
“Did I ever tell you about the time when I was five and a golden retriever stole my sandwich?” Greg asked, throwing John completely off guard. He tried to take another deep breath and focus on what Greg was saying.
“Despite what you might think, I was not in any way repulsed by you last night.”
John put his head in his hand and smiled.
“Not a problem. The bed’s all made.”
John’s back hit the hardwood with a resounding thud and before he even had time to yell or curse, Greg and Mike were at him as well, clawing at his shirt and fumbling to get it off him. He could vaguely hear Sherlock yelling something angrily over their roars of laughter and knew he would be trying to stop them but damn it, Tom was strong.
“No, none of those.”
John looked up to see Sherlock clearly trying to contain his excitement. “You mean it?” he asked.
“’Course I know him; he’s my flatmate,” Greg said.
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock said, scooping up a small handful of icing sugar and tossing it onto John’s face.
Greg, Mike and Tom were already more than a bit tipsy, and John could tell that Sherlock, who was sitting reluctantly next to him, was not amused. Sherlock hadn’t really wanted to join them, but John promised if he tagged along just this once that he’d let him keep one extra body part in the fridge that month. What he hadn’t mentioned, however, was that he really just wanted to spend as much time with him as possible, since he’d be leaving for the army in just a year’s time.
