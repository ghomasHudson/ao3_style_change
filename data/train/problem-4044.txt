Castiel’s own cock is red and straining between them, begging for attention as it leaks a steady stream of precome that runs down the shaft, but he ignores it. Just lets Dean fuck him, harder, faster, deeper until he’s gasping with it, shouting, a wretched, helpless sound that rips from Castiel’s chest like a hurricane.
And at the bottom of the page, in Castiel's handwriting:
“Cas, what— did I hurt you?”
Suddenly, it’s all he can think about.
The sound of it is loud, and Dean swears under his breath as he drags himself up into the attic. He’s just pulled his feet up over the edge when the man reaches the landing.
earned a break,” Dean says, an incredulous note to his voice. “That meant you, too.”
In some distant part of his mind, he spares a moment of regret that this isn’t happening someplace more comfortable. His room in the bunker. One of the countless dusty motels they’ve woven in and out of over the years. Even the back of the Impala, cramped as it may be.
It’s the first time he’s allowed himself to truly believe that Sam and Cas made it out of the house, and he pictures them sitting in the police station in Wichita. Cas would be rigid in his seat, expression guarded. Sam would be vibrating with anger and pain that he’d refuse to show until someone pushed him too far. He hopes it’s not Cas who does. The last thing either of them need is to fight with each other.
He moves ahead, dropping to a knee to slide a record from it’s sleeve. He blows invisible dust from its surface before he sets it on the turntable, and the low crackle of the speakers is overlapped by the rhythmic piano of a blues song.
When he looks back outside, the sky is awash with color.
“You were saying?”
He slides another finger alongside the others; twists his wrist and presses deep, rubbing insistently against Dean’s prostate until he sees stars, and sends another burst of grace through him. Dean feels suspended by it. Alight with it. Surrounded and known. Like he could live in this moment forever; like he already has.
Cas huffs a small laugh, looking down at the table.
“Neither can I.”
“Cas, I’m sorry. But for one thing, Dean’s straight. He’s just not interested in men like that. That’s not going suddenly change just because you love him.”
Thunder crashes again, right on top of the empty farmhouse now, and the rain pours heavier than ever. The tremors get worse. He grits his teeth and stands, unsteady on his feet as he crosses the room to grab a blanket. If he can just warm up a little, he might be able to think more clearly.
“Well... his tags were never recovered, so there’s nothing official, but there’s an unverified account of an unnamed Air Force crewman having discovered his body, and there’s no record of him ever returning home. His twin sister is still around, though. Adina Stone. She’s been living in an assisted living community out in Phoenix since she had a stroke a few years back. Eighty-nine years old. Not sure how much she’d be able to tell you, but she’s there.”
Looking out over the water, Castiel’s lips turn up in a nostalgic smile.
“Yeah, well I guess I’ve been too distracted by the recurring stab wounds to be checking you for ink,” he says, then looks up, pulling his lower lip between his teeth as he meets Castiel’s eyes. “I like it.”
Dean shakes his head.
Bobby’s brow furrows at the response he gets, but it’s barely a second before the crease vanishes, his face going slack and pale as he lifts his gaze to Castiel. The sight of him looking so shaken makes Castiel’s stomach toss and turn.
She stares up at him, blinking furiously, and Dean’s shocked to see her eyes are wet.
But Dean doesn’t speak.
Dean has no idea how he hasn’t come yet—it’s felt seconds away for what seems like hours—but when Cas presses his lips to the skin of his throat, stubble catching against stubble as he works his way along Dean’s jaw, he realizes he doesn’t care.
“Nada.”
Dean seems to be of the same mind.
The warm, peaceful dark he’s been dwelling in for some unknown amount of time slips away in an instant, replaced by the blinding flare of oncoming headlights and a fear so all-encompassing that it’s like a physical touch on the back of his neck, something vile pressing against his teeth. The car thuds over another dip in the road. He flinches, and the motion sets off the pain again. It runs like a current through his left wrist and down into his fingertips, forking off at every misaligned joint. The skin is numb. He feels the jarring tremor in his bones anyway.
“I told you,” he says when Dean whines against his lips, and he’s surprised by how hoarse his own voice is. He swallows, feeling a phantom sensation in the back of his throat. “This was just for you.”
He’s not sure why Charlie would have moved it, or when, but it’s entirely possible he didn’t notice, considering how tired he’s been all day. Hell, maybe he fell asleep.
Dean flinches away, startled awake by the touch and gasping in pain as the movement pulls at one of many wounds. Castiel feels guilt settle back into his stomach like a rock dropped into a well.
Sam’s voice is muffled and tinny through the cell phone speaker, but Castiel can still make out every word. He doesn’t sound worried, which is a relief, but the note of tense anger in his tone is a warning signal that has every last one of his senses on high alert.
“I’m so sorry, Daniel,” he says aloud, and the forest swallows his words.
Cursing under his breath, Dean sits up slowly to peer over the driver’s seat headrest at John. He’s about fifteen yards away from the car, now. Crouching on his haunches and talking to the sky.
“I know. And if he does, I’ll respec—“
“Sure you weren’t. I’d recognize your about-to-use-healing-mojo face anywhere.”
Soon never came, though.
“You’re drunk,” Cas reminds him. “By your own admission. Which means you’re probably twice as drunk as someone else saying that.”
Walking toward the wreckage would be incredibly foolish, but he still takes a few steps that way before he stops. They’d been flying south-east and his men jumped before he did. If he’s to find any of them, it will be north-west of here. He starts walking and finds Daniel almost forty minutes later, hanging from his parachute lines in a huge pine.
But the street rushing by is flanked by an unfamiliar stretch of graffiti-covered factories. Crumbling brick warehouses. A laundromat. A block later, they pass a closed-down gas station—
“Maybe...”
They should take their time, he thinks as Dean tilts his chin to kiss him deeper. They should savor this moment. Draw it out. Make it last.
“C’mon, man, I just need to--”
“Perhaps just some cold water for my friend.”
Years ago, in a similarly cramped storeroom in the Rexford Gas n Sip, Castiel had knelt on the floor to gather his things while Dean waited outside in the Impala, and wondered if perhaps one of them would be brave enough to ask for a single room at the motel they were headed toward.
“Wow. Sorry, man. Not that I even meant to turn up at all, but I bet that messed with you.”
“No,” he says.
“Okay, Dad.”
“You’re one to talk.”
“Yes.”
“What did I do?” Sam asks, and Castiel’s heart breaks at the way he sounds. Voice thick with suppressed tears. “Cas, I didn’t do anything.”
Thank you so much for reading & for being patient while I’ve updated this at such a glacial pace. I’m at that horrible stage in my writing where my taste is exceeding my ability, and every word I put on the page feels like less than I am capable of. I really appreciate everyone who’s sticking with me, and who has contributed to my much-needed serotonin by leaving a comment :’D They really do fuel me, so I can’t thank you enough for letting me know what you think.
Carefully, he writes
- Danburger does not exist, but! I was Google-mapsing my way around Danville to get a sense of the place before I had them stop there for dinner, and happened upon this auto parts shop on the same strip of road as all the fast food & chain restaurants in the town. I figured, hey! Maybe the first time Dean came through Danville, he picked up a part for the Impala at this place and then popped next door for something to eat! What a perfect little bit of pointless and unnecessary backstory! So I - clicked over to street view  to take a closer look at the location, and when I tell you I wheezed I mean I WHEEZED. What in the Terrible Dad Joke is happening at this auto shop, y’all. I also googled the shop after, and apparently they change out the sign pretty regularly. I found one photo that showed it saying: “Practice safe eating, always use condiments” and another that said: “When you’ve seen one shopping center you’ve seen a mall”. The piano one-liner in the fic is one I first heard from my uncle a long time ago, and given that he’s a mechanic it felt like the perfect thing to drop in there.
Nothing seemed to fit anymore. All his friends from before--people he’d grown up with, spent countless afternoons and weekends with from his childhood up until the year he left--all seemed out of reach. The auto shop, long-since taken over by his dad’s old friend Bobby who owned the adjoining salvage yard, was too full of clanking machinery and the smell of gasoline.
“I shouldn’t have had to! You should’ve… You should
“And this is your solution? You’re just gonna give up?”
Now, he has this. Thousands of miles between himself and his home, his family, the people he loves. The man he loves.
Laughing, Dean shakes his head, tossing the towel back into the bathroom before he crosses the room to rifle through his duffel at Castiel’s side.
“I don’t think you’re pronouncing that correctly,” Castiel tells him, and Dean pokes out his tongue.
Cas had been distracted on the call, thanks to Crowley making obnoxious gestures at him from the passenger seat, and had simply said,
The fear grips Dean tighter than before, constricting his lungs.
“It’s been so long, I thought... I thought you weren’t...” Castiel sighs, though it sounds closer to a sob. “Ten months, Dean. I didn’t think I’d see you again.”
“Nothing for you to be sorry for, man. I mean, this is fucked, obviously. But it’s not your fault.”
The man on stage leans heavy against the microphone stand, grinning as his voice drips like honey through the crackling speakers, and Dean swirls the whisky around in his glass. It’s hot in the bar, smoke thick and sickly sweet with cloves. He’d forgotten how awful it could get in enclosed spaces before the indoor smoking ban. He wonders how people stand it.
The panic attack hadn’t lasted all that long, but it was enough to have him packing a bag.
, and
“I’ll give you a hand,” he says, practically herding Dean out of the library. He’s being about as subtle as the moose Crowley likes to compare him to, but Castiel doesn’t react. Instead he stands, too, pushing his chair in before picking up the laptop he’s been working on.
“It became a habit, after a while. Even after you found me, and after you returned to Earth, and then still when I was finally pulled free of Purgatory by the angels. It was a way to remain connected to you when circumstances outside my control kept me away.”
“That does sound like Mary,” he agrees. Jack grins again before his eyes dart back toward the book he’d been reading. “What part are you up to?”
“Downstairs. Second window from the left. A figure just passed by.”
, he reminds himself—his laughter has been uncharacteristically rare. John may have been given the all clear a month ago, but Dean still hasn’t quite bounced back.
Dean grunts.
“Alright,” he sighs. “You’re right. I’ll wait until morning.”
“Do you actually want me, Dean?” he asks, a tremor in his voice. “Or are you just trying to sate one hunger by feeding another?”
His fingers trail electric heat from Castiel’s lower back around to his sides, thumbs pressing lightly into the skin of his hips as he pulls Castiel closer, pulls him to stand between his knees, toys with the buttons of his shirt. He leans in and presses his mouth to Castiel’s stomach, breath hot through the thin cotton, and for a time, Castiel is lost in the sheer indulgence of it, but then—
He has no matches, but he can clear the fireplace before John gets back. Get it ready so that they can light it as soon as he arrives. His fingers feel numb as he uses some of the plastic sheeting to pick up the bird. He can feel its body through the thin plastic, and the smell of it, the sound of the insects he’s disturbed, it’s all too much. His stomach churns and churns, and then he’s outside, retching into the grass until he’s dizzy, until he’s crying again with no idea how he’s ever supposed to stop.
“Do you think he’s going to tell her?”
Dean’s voice has taken on a desperate note. Higher than usual. Thinner.
Dean is close, then closer, the toes of his shoes bumping against Castiel’s. Their fingers curl loosely together, and Dean lifts his other hand to Castiel’s waist. His touch, light but warm through the cotton of his shirt, makes Castiel’s stomach jump and flutter.
“Beautiful,” Cas says, and gives him such a slow, luxurious lick that Dean nearly loses it then and there. It’s so distracting that he doesn’t notice that a second finger has joined the first until it’s already knuckle-deep inside him, and that feeling is back. The liquid heat of grace easing Cas’ way as he twists his hand and presses deeper.
Castiel had not intended to enter.
“Are you saying I look like crap now?”
“Yeah, Donna reached out. Friend of hers caught a lead, so we’re gonna see what we can see.”
They drive. They drive. They drive.
“Yeah? Well he’s kinda being a dick about it.”
“Well. Let’s not go that far,” Castiel says.
“I thought you went back,” Dean tells him, and the words break the spell.
proud, in whatever way he can. To make up for everything that fell apart.
“Will you come back?”
“Man, that was good,” Dean says, and pushes the plate away, pressing his forefinger against the remaining crumbs and lifting them to his mouth as he meets Castiel’s eyes across the table. Castiel clears his throat.
“If there’s something you want...”
“So much for tracking down grandkids, then,” Dean says.
“No,” he says, and it’s astonishing how quickly that one word makes the tension leech from Dean’s body. How he seems to breathe back into himself. It spurs Castiel on. “I was… I did care about him. I
“I thought you were just getting steak?”
“What?”
On some level, he’s aware that he and John fall into that last category of people, but even though he’s starting to lose track of how long it’s been since that night when everything changed, something in his head is still resistant to accepting that this is really his life now.
Dean rips the envelope open, and a photograph falls out. Dean stares at the black and white picture of himself kissing Castiel’s neck, and feels his own eyes water at the sight. For him, not even five minutes have passed since he left.
“That didn’t sound right?”
“So how is he?” Bobby asks.
“I just,” Dean flounders, waving his hand vaguely in the air. “It’s. I don’t know. I never let
The lake doesn’t have much in the way of a current, but Dean is drifting closer, and he just keeps staring. It’s making Castiel nervous. His limbs tingle down to his fingers and toes.
“You’ve only said that once,” Cas argues, squinting at him. “Just now.”
They don’t move forward, so he steps off the elevator to meet them.
Cas had replied
he thinks,
“Did you think of something?”
“Technically, it’s a curtain. For now.”
Castiel narrows his eyes but doesn’t dignify the comment with a response. Dean grins.
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “Thanks, Char.”
“Hope you’re up for a long drive,” he says.
Dean’s leaning against the wall by the bunker’s door when Cas drives up, and the sight is the closest thing Cas has ever known to home. He feels his hands tighten around the steering wheel as he pulls over.
Dean just waves his hand in the air.
Castiel thinks, but doesn’t let his understanding show.
Dean just clears his throat, cheeks burning even redder than before as he walks away from the table. Castiel tries not to feel too smug about it.
“The barrier’s not going to hold much longer,” Belphegor says, as if none of them had realized what was happening, and rocks back on his heels. “Hope one of you has a back up plan, because I’m fresh out of ideas.”
“Cas, this was our only shot,” Dean hears himself saying as if from miles away. His throat is dry. Panic rising, giving way to anger, always anger. “What the hell were you thinking?”
“I had been under the impression that the tree was guarded by an angel,” he tells her.
Grabbing a camera from a shelf in the studio, Mary follows them out into the front yard and takes several Polaroids of them loading everything into the truck, and more still once they climb inside.
The car they’re in changes once or twice a week while they’re moving. Sometimes, the only way Dean can keep track of anything at all is by thinking back on how many different makes and models they’ve stolen. He tries to keep a list in his head; vinyl or leather interiors, or seat covers made of sheepskin. Automatic transmission or stick shift. Cars that reek of cigarette smoke and cars that smell like dogs and cars that have baby carriers strapped into the back seats.
“Okay, new rule? Quit saying hot shit while I’m doing this. It’s confusing my junk.”
trying to find Kelly. She’s in a lot of trouble right now, and we don’t have a lot of time to help her.”
“Sam said you were heading to Washington?”
Jack misses you
Guilt swells in Castiel's chest almost immediately, and he steps forward, hands spread.
“It’s not a difficult question.”
“Okay. Okay. So, um. What’s yours?”
“Sigils first, then check the roof,” John says, gesturing to a manhole in the ceiling over the kitchen counter once they’ve poked their heads into the every room. “You know how they should look?”
With a tilt of his head, he grazes his nose along Dean’s.
Castiel gestures toward a Dutch oven set on one side of the fire.
While Dean clears the ground of any loose stones or sticks, Castiel works on the tangled ropes, feeling the knot of anxiety in his chest easing with every passing moment. By the time he’s done, he’s slowly started to remember the next steps. Dean already has the tent corners staked down on a flat patch of ground, and is using a rubber mallet to straighten out the bent pole on top of one of the limestone rocks.
The coffee goes cold long before the water does.
“Detective— Sergeant Ballard didn’t mention John,” he says, which is foreboding in and of itself. Sam makes a choked sound, like he’s trying not to feel any particular emotion about it. Castiel can relate.
As he watches them clamber over the rocky earth and into the shadows beyond the waterline, he imbues them with what little grace he can spare, hoping it gives them the edge they need to survive.
“Good, I’ll let his wife know,” she says, and Dean feels guilt over the lie like a physical weight dropped onto his shoulders. It’s honestly a wonder that he still has the capacity to feel more of it. Before he can dwell too long, the deputy yawns, wide, and cracks her neck. “We set up some extra cots for you in the classrooms back there if you need to crash a while.”
anymore. It almost sounds as though he’s singing.
“Are you tired?”
desperately trying to keep my attention. Either way. What exactly are we doing here, Dean?”
That pulls Dean up short; he meets Cas’ eyes, heart pounding hard at the look he finds there.
Dean sighs into the hollow of his throat.
Several more hours pass in much the same way.
Castiel’s entire body seizes up, muscles taut as he tries and fails to remain calm.
“Okay, I guess just try to keep up. The first time I met him was September 21st, 1945. Two weeks passed. Saw him again. Close to a year passed. Time after that… that was the same day, but the next one was seven months. Then ten months. Then a couple of days. What year are you getting?”
“I know.”
“I think we can figure it out, Cas. It’s just a basic A-frame, right?” Kneeling down beside him, Dean grabs the mess of guy ropes and tosses them over. “Here, start untangling those, and I’ll get the ground tarp set up.”
“Then what?”
“It’s alright.”
Perhaps their research on demigods and cambion will pan out. He wonders if Sam has had any luck yet, and hates that the simple act of calling and asking him feels like another insurmountable task.
Sam could have amounted to something. Mom already
, he thinks.
“I’m sorry,” he says once he finds his voice. It’s not enough. He knows it’s not enough, but he doesn’t know where else to start. There’s silence, then a low
Instead, he breathes deeply a few times before going back inside.
“Eileen?”
“Remember Rexford?” Dean asks against his lips.
Perching on the adjacent swing, Castiel wraps a hand around the chain and watches Dean rocking back and forth on his heels, waiting for him to work up to whatever it is that’s been on his mind. It takes him a while, and it's only after it starts to drizzle that he takes a deep breath and speaks, eyes trained on his feet.
“He was—” the past tense hurts to use, sticks in his throat. “I want you to know, Jack. He loved you so much. He was
Something in the trees catches Dean’s attention, then, and he sits up straighter on the branch before looking over at Castiel and gesturing for quiet before he points. Castiel follows his finger, but whatever it is, it’s not visible from where he’s standing.
Castiel crinkles his nose.
“Should I turn off the music?”
The chair where Cas had been sitting when Dean told him he couldn’t stay. The corner of the floor where Dean had almost killed him under the influence of the Mark of Cain; where he’d left an angel blade impaled in a book just inches from Cas’ face.
Jack is standing by the desk, skimming his hands over the things Cas left behind.
Dean drops the bottle. The sound of it rolling across the floor echoes in the quiet.
So it doesn’t take Dean long to track Jack down.
“What is it?” Charlie asks, and he holds it up to show her.
“Potassium,” he repeats. Dean narrows his eyes.
He just stares, dazed, until something shifts behind his eyes like a switch being flicked, and then he slips his jacket and shirts free in a fluid motion, flinging them across the tiny room before kneeling to untie his boots.
him, to reach out and touch him and know that this is real.
“Fine.”
“Yes, actually.”
Dean’s fingers tighten. If Castiel were human, it might be a little uncomfortable. As it is, he barely feels it.
“Sure.”
“So far,” he agrees. “It’s actually-- y’know what, come upstairs for a minute. I’ll show you.”
Parker looks sharply over his shoulder, tensing further when he realizes what Dean is referring to.
“Perhaps we could make a day of it… take something for lunch, eat outdoors seeing as it’s such a fine day.”
When Cas steps into his view shortly after, he hits the point of no return.
“I haven’t been accepted yet,” Castiel tells him.
And he’s ranting, ranting, and Dean heaves a breath and says, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I promise, I’m safe.”
Right now, he’s making his way through a dense slice of German chocolate cake. As he methodically chews each molecule-flavored mouthful, he tries to recall the taste he’d enjoyed so much when he’d had occasion to try a cupcake sample at a market shortly after his arrival in Rexford.
“Kominek,” Charlie says after a long time. “Bartłomiej and Agata Kominek. They’re both… I’m sorry, Castiel. It’s been a long time since they died. But Hannah is still alive. She’s 76 years old, living in Sycamore, just outside Chicago. She moved there with her husband in 1968.”
The stunned look on Dean’s face is one hundred percent worth the wait.
“Sieraków... where your plane went down?” Dean asks, and Castiel looks at him in surprise. Dean grimaces, a little self-conscious. “I, uh... sorry. I found some stories about you when I found the jacket.”
. It’s a bland, unassuming kind of car, and John makes a beeline for it.
“I realize now that I was wrong to think that,” he says, watching the way that Dean’s entire body seems to shudder with the effort of holding itself together. “Sam told me—“
He went back to Normal during the summer break before eleventh grade, ostensibly to repair some damage that Grandpa Henry’s car had sustained in a minor accident, and stayed for three weeks, this time learning the tricks of the trade that he’d been too young to grasp before. When a bridal party arrived with requests for several original dresses, Grandma Millie encouraged him to try his hand at design, and was thrilled when she called him a week later to announce that his third attempt was being made for the Maid of Honor.
The room smells of mildew and stale pizza, and it’s costing him nineteen dollars to stay here tonight. The price is the only honest part of the name.
“Nevermind. The point is, it worked.”
“Hilarious. But you know what I meant.”
But, somehow, Dean’s the only one who John didn’t come after with a knife. He doesn’t understand why John saved
Then;
Dean blinks and looks between Castiel and Mary, standing behind him in the open doorway.
“Yeah.” Dean pulls out his wallet, and Castiel waves his hand away to drop his own dubiously acquired cash on the table.
“Yeah. Yes. Tell me.”
“You’ve probably never said the word
So he keeps his mouth shut, and stops behind Sam’s chair, and leans down to grip him in a tight hug. Presses his forehead to his neck and just breathes as Sam’s freehand rises to hold him there.
“You’re getting better at this,” Dean says a few paces away from the car. “The interviewing witnesses stuff. That was a nice move in there with the notepad.”
The implication of those words hangs between them, and Castiel watches as Dean wrestles with himself, waging some internal battle between denial and desperation to have things be okay.
“You know, it’s kinda stupid to look at these without listening to them,” Dean points out.
Dean groans and laughs, thunking the back of his head against the window.
Dean shakes his head.
His cell rings, and Dean barks out a helpless laugh.
“Okay.”
“That’s right, Dean. Deep breaths. You’re safe,” he says again, and beside him, Sam reaches out to pick up a tumbler from Dean’s bedside table. Dean’s eyes flick over toward him.
“Hey, I brought you the songs of my people. That’s almost as good as a sports almanac, and less likely to get you in trouble.”
Finally, he gestures toward the duffel that Dean carried in, and Dean digs the jacket out, handing it over.
He loved the process of taking an engine apart and putting it back together. He loved cars, period. But the memory of that short week in his youth stayed in the back of his mind, and all through his shifts at Winchester Auto, Dean daydreamed about the little shop in Normal.
“The date?”
“Hey, I’m happy for you, man,” Dean says.
“Too busy to answer the damn phone?” Bobby asks.
“That sucks, Cas.”
“My friends are gathering the rest of the items we need,” he explains, rearranging the bag so that the fruit does not fall out, “but it should only be a few weeks until we can set it in motion.”
Heat floods Dean’s skin from his chest to the tips of his ears, and he stares at Cas in combined rapture and mortification. Because his thoughts had been nothing less than filthy, but Cas is saying he wants to
“I’ll call you tonight and let you know the address.”
Dean chews on his lip, like he’s trying to find an excuse to stay a little longer, or find some other thing to say, but he stands without saying a word and shoves his hands back into his pockets.
“Lie down for me.”
“I mean, if you want to make new friends, I’m not gonna stop you,” Dean teases, and Castiel rolls his eyes, driving onward until they haven’t seen another tent for five minutes. They’re near the northernmost part of the park, where Big Blue River feeds into Tuttle Creek Lake, and the air is crisp and clear.
Dean looks at him carefully before he takes an unsteady breath.
did you skip sixth grade?”
He knows he should stop doing it. It's not healthy. He knows this. He opens the thread again anyway.
Satisfied that Sam is safe, and unwilling to subject himself to any level of interaction with the demon beyond what’s strictly necessary to get the job done, Dean heads for the next room, where another two cots have been set up. He collapses onto the first one he reaches fully dressed, unwilling to even take off his boots, just in case Chuck decides to throw something else at them overnight.
“Where is he?” Jack asks, and Dean hates it. Hates how he can hear the waver in Jack’s voice. Hates that he can’t do anything to make it better. Can only make it worse. Fuck, he makes everything worse. “Dean, where’s Cas?”
How he looks after Jack from this point on is at the core of that, but the terrified expression on his face right now says that Dean has already failed. He needs to do better. Needs to do Cas proud.
“Dean—”
He never anticipated anything like this, but he’s never been happier to be wrong.
“Time is it?”
Cas’ hand in his own, just holding on. Just because he wants to; just because he can.
When they leave the restaurant a little after eight o’clock, Castiel pulls off his coat and jacket and rolls up his sleeves before he slips back behind the wheel.
bad. He’s actually pretty nice. A bit pretentious, but…. He’s okay.”
“What are you want?” she asks him.
“The Empty wanted revenge on Billie,” Sam guesses, and Dean nods.
“I think we have bigger problems to focus on right now.”
Just checking in. Mom’s planning game night tonight… hoped you might be back in time.
“Do you want me to wait for you, or—?”
“Sure,” he lies.
Resolved, he looks fully at Sam.
“You’re not really Secret Service, are you?”
“You ready to go?”
“Look, if this is just guilt—if you’re just here to… to
“Mary said she’d remind Sam to buy me the next book on the way home from New Jersey,” Jack goes on, oblivious to Castiel’s distraction. “They’re coming back tonight.”
“Of all of it, Dean. I’ve hurt you so many times. I’ve broken your trust, I’ve caused more problems than I’ve solved. Made so many mistakes.”
Eyes wide open and stinging, Dean stares at the negative space in the center of the room and sees the afterimage of it. The Empty, otherworldly and furious, surrounding Cas and swallowing him like a black hole devouring a star.
He closes his eyes, squeezing the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger.
“Sorry,” Dean says, and waves a dismissive hand when Castiel tells him it’s not his fault. “It kinda is, though. If you thought there was even a chance that I’d— man. You’re my best friend, Cas. I’ve got your back. That’s not, like… conditional, or whatever.”
“Are you stuck?”
“Well, I’ll start with the basics,” Henriksen says, talking so slow and calm that it makes Castiel even more anxious to head for the hospital. “Dean was found locked in the basement of a farmhouse in Cimarron two days ago, and was airlifted to St. Francis here in Wichita that morning. Sergeant Ballard and I were both notified of a possible ID yesterday.”
It can’t be
“I’ll be glad when rationing ends. It’s been years since I ate a meal that tasted like more than its individual parts.”
The more he considers it, the more he believes it.
“Anyway. We can probably make it about halfway through Ohio tonight. Maybe stop somewhere on the other side of Columbus so I can catch a couple hours sleep. ”
Castiel can feel the flush rising on his neck, spreading over his cheeks.
“I would have—”
It’s the truth, but saying as much out loud makes Castiel’s ears grow hot with embarrassment that he’s still not certain he should be capable of feeling. Dean doesn’t fare much better, his cheeks flushing pink. Castiel tries not to enjoy the sight so much, given what he’s about to say.
“Fights?” Dean suggests.
Scrubbing a hand over his face, Dean nods.
“You’re such an opportunist,” Dean whispers against his throat, biting along the underside of his jaw and working his way up to his mouth.
“I’m not saying I’ll hurt the poor dears,” she says, offended. “Just…  a harmless little
He remembers switching his phone to speaker mode and tossing it onto the passenger seat as the cars crept forward.
“How did you do it?”
“Hey!”
“You gonna come in me, sweetheart?” Dean asks, and Cas grips him harder at the question, fingers pressing into his skin hard enough to bruise. “Do it. I want you to. Wanna feel you.”
Avoiding the obscenely large amount of money Dean has left him, Castiel digs through Dean’s pantry. One peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich later, he slips the money Dean left for him into his pocket, along with the spare key, and heads for the door.
It’s then that he hears music, filtering up through the attic floorboards.
why did you send me this
“His name was Lieutenant Daniel Fisher,” Sam tells him over the phone, and Dean can hear him flipping through papers as he talks. “But it looks like he never made it back. He’s listed as MIA during the Warsaw Airlift.”
The tree has no low branches for Castiel to climb, no way for him to reach his friend and cut him down. He can’t even get his tags to return to Adina. He’s not even sure of where she lives.
As he walks through the revolving doors of the hotel, Castiel wonders how much Sam has already been told, and kicks himself for not calling Ellen back last night.
Castiel raises an eyebrow.
The drive back to the apartment takes twenty minutes, and Castiel spends most of it gazing out the window with a restless feeling in the pit of his stomach. It’s almost five in the afternoon, and though Dean offered to drive him up to Sycamore now, Castiel told him they should wait until the morning. If they left now, it would be early evening by the time they arrived, and he doesn’t want to spring such a shock on an old woman when she’d likely be preparing for bed.
“Oh,” he breathes.
It’s not that he’d thought Sam was lying when he mentioned the note Dean had put up for him, but knowing it was there and seeing the evidence of its removal are two very different things.
His back arches, and Dean pulls off, pumping his warm fist over Castiel as he spills. By some wonder, though Dean is still fully clothed, he looks just as blissed out as Castiel feels.
With a grimace, Castiel stands and shuffles on his feet.
Standing in the street, they watch with creeping dread as ghost after ghost after ghost hurtles out of Hell and slams into the barrier with an electric flash of red energy.
There’s no reply, and he pushes himself out from under the car with a grunt, wiping his grease-stained hands on his once-tan coveralls as he heads for the attached office. Bobby wheels his way back inside just as he arrives.
“Yeah, well. Can’t say you didn’t warn me.” Dean slumps back in his seat, dropping the fork onto the plate with a clatter and rubbing at his forehead. “I should’ve listened, but I just… man, I really expected better from him. Some of the shit he said…”
“You can... what?”
Dean loathes Skype with every fibre of his being, but he’s keen to see what Sam found. He grabs the jacket and heads back out into the kitchen, where he pulls out a chair at the table. Booting his laptop, he waiting a painful amount of time for the program to load.
“We’ll meet you at home,” Sam says, his hand settling heavily on Castiel’s shoulder, and the grip that feels more like a command than comfort combined with the the forced cheerful tone of his voice sets off alarm bells in Castiel’s mind.
“I always wondered what happened to him,” she says. “Are you his grandson?”
“You didn’t answer,” Dean says after a moment.
We’re at the Smithsonian Zoo 🦁🐒🐘 in Washington DC.
“You think you’d be able to track down records to find out who Novak was? He’s probably got grandkids, and y’know… if this was Henry’s, I know I’d want to have it around.”
Dean doesn’t answer, just flicks idly at the handle of the glove compartment.
“You’re breathtaking,” Castiel tells him. Dean closes his eyes, and Castiel taps lightly on his chest. “Eyes open, Dean. Look at me.”
“The two of you… you don’t just have history, Cas, you have
“Oh.”
Charlie is half asleep when she answers her door the following morning, only one eye open to glare at Dean for his arrival.
Standing in the doorway, he shuffles on his feet, awkward and out of place. He doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do. If he’s supposed to go home, or if Bobby and Ellen want him to come with them to the police station, or to the hospital, or both, or none at all.
"If you still want to tell me about it, you should. I just--"
“What?”
“Just, pick a word.”
“These people are like freakin’ vultures,” he mutters under his breath.
He almost wishes he’d never offered him the candy—if only so he’d be able to find out what Cas tastes like underneath it.
He only drops the act—and the book—when he hears the
“In a sense.”
to survive on less sleep right now.”
“Should we wait for him to come back?”
“That’s my sister,” Castiel says. Dean flinches, a hand rising to rub at his chest as he looks back at Castiel.
Maybe, if he doesn’t show up with all of his things, looking like he just expects to be welcomed home, like he expects their forgiveness, they’ll be more likely to allow him to try to earn it.
The Impala’s tank is running low, but Dean doesn’t stop. Doesn’t want to give himself the opportunity to rip into Cas again, and he hates it, but he knows it’s going to happen. He can feel it. That same toxic feeling, leeching bile into his blood and venom onto his tongue.
“I want to make you come,” Castiel says pointedly, pressing his fingers more firmly against Dean’s perineum, sliding them back until the tip of his middle finger catches at his rim. Dean arches into the feeling. “Just. Like.
“Does she think the sculpture has a skeleton inside of it?” Castiel asks with humor, and Dean huffs.
Though he’s got a client coming in at nine, he’s still laying in bed, staring at a long crack in the ceiling. There’s a few of them around the place, he’s noticed. A gap between the bathtub and the wall. A wonky section of hardwood at the top of the stairs.
” Bartłomiej clicks his fingers as he tries to think of the word, and gestures at Castiel’s flight jacket. “Your coat. Agata will fix.”
Dean’s barely opened his mouth to deny it, but Charlie levels him with a judgemental brow before he can tell her a single word. There’s no use. He sighs.
The obvious topic is so big it’s overwhelming, but everything else seems too trivial to mention. Castiel knows he needs to mention Dean’s condition before they arrive at the hospital, but he knows Jo will ask too many questions, and doesn’t want to make Sam any more nervous than he already is.
, like I said, but what does
is an understatement. It’s been years since Dean did this. More than a decade, now that he’s really thinking about it.
“I won’t tell him about them,” Castiel promises. “If I meet him, that is.”
not the point. is this bad?
“Come on, Cas,” Sam says.
Quietly, Dean slips out through the front door and across the parking lot, heading for the bleachers on the far side of the football field. Out here, the air feels clearer. Less stifling.
His spoon clinks against the mug as he thinks of the way Dean had grinned at him, eyes shining under the convenience store fluorescents. He’d looked wonderful. Most people looked sickly and pale under those lights; Dean looked like a dream.
The blacktop is patchy and rough. They head north, then south, then east again, weaving through countless little nameless towns with nothing to show for themselves beyond barely functional gas stations that double as their general stores. When signs start telling them that they’re approaching Galveston, Dean wonders if they’ll actually make it that far before John changes directions again.
“You want me to what?”
“So, you’re back?”
“You’re such a dick,” Dean tells him, though the ache of want that flows from his soul as he says it takes the sting out of his words. Castiel smiles back, and tugs gently at Dean’s leg where their ankles are still linked under the table.
When he walks back into the foyer, nothing looks familiar. The hospital is a maze of beige tile and yellowed pine paneling that he can’t hope to navigate without assistance. It’s through sheer chance that help arrives before he has to ask for it.
He’s still falling when he hears the
“No, I-- dammit, Cas, I wanted to see you. I’ve nearly come back every day since I left. But...”
“Cas?”
Castiel’s face grows redder still, and when he glances back Dean winks at him.
“Ready?”
“How are these always better than I remember?” Dean wonders aloud with another satisfied hum, and holds the burger out. “Want a bite?”
They’re still pressed together in the storeroom, Cas’ hands fixed to his waist, his lips close enough that Dean feels them brush against his own when he speaks, and the sensation is grounding. Something real and solid that he can hold onto.
Charlie pats the back of his head.
may even be a bigger understatement than Dean saying it’s been a while. Staring up at Cas, his muscles rolling, coiling, tightening and relaxing under taut, tanned skin, his eyes somehow dark and bright all at once, Dean’s certain that nothing has ever looked better.
, he thinks, but then Dean looks up at him and smiles as the sunrise breaks, edging him in gold, and Castiel knows that no matter how much it aches to want more than he can have, there’s nowhere else he’d rather be.
A knock comes at the open classroom door a moment later, startling him out of his thoughts before he can spiral any further into what feels like an endless pit of existential dread that he’s not remotely equipped to deal with. He’s expecting to see Sam—he doubts that Cas is going to seek him out any time soon, given the barbs Dean’s been flinging at him—but as it turns out, it’s neither of them.
He doesn’t realize that they’ve parked until Dean taps on the passenger window from the outside and opens the door.
“There’s no demonic energy present. I don’t detect anything that would suggest they’ve been listening, but if they were, they won’t be able to now.”
God, it seems so stupid, now.
Because Cas loved him, and died for him, and he did it without ever knowing that Dean was right there with him.
He takes a shuddering breath, face turned to press against Castiel’s neck, and kisses him there. Squeezes his eyes shut and holds on and kisses him.
“Obviously, this isn’t something I think we should make a habit of doing,” Castiel says, ignoring Dean’s sarcasm. “But considering the fact that this nephilim could very easily destroy the world if we don’t find a way to deal with it in time, I think it’s reasonable to make some exceptions if need be. And don’t you think it would be wise to prepare this doctor in case another angel or demon finds out that Kelly reached out to him? Or if she contacts him again?”
I will <3
“That’s not what my partner asked you,” he says.
“Sorry about the music before, by the way.”
“Level four, room seven.”
“Must’ve been a good book.”
It’s been twelve months.
“Not such a stupid bedhead after all,” Dean says. His voice tighter than before, and it’s only when he hears it that Castiel realizes his eyes have closed. He forces them back open and watches Dean’s hand shifting over him, slow but deliberate over his underwear before he stops completely to squeeze him at the base. Castiel’s knees raise to bracket him, and he doesn’t know whether it’s his body trying to keep him there forever or make this
“And I guess they like you as much as the rabbits?”
where are you anyway?
Castiel isn’t entirely sure that he knows who Kate Winslet is, but as he pushes out of bed and gathers the rest of his clothes, he mentally adds it to the list of references he needs to look up when time allows. He’s been doing that more, recently—taking note of all of Dean’s strange little turns of phrase and entering them into his phone’s web search until he can figure them out.
“Thank you,” he says again, and hopes Dean hears everything in the words, because gratitude is not enough, but even love falls short.
For now, though, he just says, “I’d like that,” and nudges Dean toward the exit.
“You got a hot date, Sammy?”
“The… zoo?” he looks at Dean, uncertain, and finds an equally confused expression on his face. “As in—“
Closing his eyes, Dean tenses his jaw before taking a deep breath.
“You’ve been all distracted and mopey for days.”
“Pa’s already gone home for the day,” he says in apology.
, with
“You want to stop?”
The energy Ruqayya pulls from him will give her the strength to restore the tree to its former glory, and she will allow him to take as much fruit as he needs with no conditions. The union, he sees, is necessary. Without it, they would both be at a disadvantage. The djinn could drain Castiel completely as he slept, defenseless; Castiel’s grace could burn through Ruqayya’s very being without his even trying.
“No,” Parker shakes his head resolutely. “I’m good.”
Regret weighs heavily on Castiel’s shoulders as he thinks of her. He can’t imagine what she must be going through. He’s no stranger to the pain of learning that what had seemed like a moment of tender connection was in fact, cold-blooded manipulation, but he never had to carry a reminder of that betrayal with him. Thanks to Gadreel, he didn’t even have a scar.
“You’ll have enough to—”
Dean didn’t doubt that his father would have objected to him keeping it had Grandma Millie not been in the ground. Dean used it as little more than a coat rack for the rest of his years in his parent’s home.
“Struck out on my first swing.”
“Aw, you worried about me Ca--
But maybe Cas found it.
A throat being cleared at the door cuts him off, and Castiel pulls his hand back, inches from touching Dean’s unbandaged forearm. The nurse is back.
, and Dean feels free.
“Weirdly not the kitschiest motel decor I’ve ever seen,” Dean says, kneeling on the bed and moving closer. By the time he’s reached the end of the sentence, he’s settled between Castiel’s legs, and Castiel has forgotten what they were talking about. His hands skim over Castiel’s bare knees, up his legs. Castiel’s breath hitches when they stop, thumbs stroking over white cotton, pulled taut where Castiel’s erection is slowly filling out against his thigh. Dean sucks his lower lip between his teeth. “Still good?”
“You have a beautiful singing voice,” he says after a while.
“Not unless you want to. We’ll warm up once we start walking.”
To cross the room and turn the faucet. Soothe his dry throat, clean the filth from his scarred hands and aching feet. But—
“Dean?”
He slides the revolting, greasy lump into the trash, and drains the broad beans over the sink. They’re bland, and practically mush, but they’re still edible. They’ll have to do.
Not at present, though it could become a catastrophic situation if we don’t locate Kelly soon enough. We are ‘hot on her trail’ though, as they say 👍 So please do not worry.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel tells him.
he tells himself. He’ll take back some sugar, honey, and coffee, and he’ll find out what he can about the man he’s pretty sure was Castiel’s lover. The jealous little part of him that he can tell wants to keep Castiel for himself can just shut the hell up.
Even with the hot weather, the lake is cold enough to make Castiel’s skin tingle, and he’s still only knee deep ten minutes after they decided to take a swim. Dean, in typical fashion, ran directly into the water, yelping at the cold but not stopping until he was deep enough to dunk his head underwater.
Outside, the traffic on I-74 slows a little, two lanes haphazardly merging into one to avoid a broken down camper in the center lane ahead. A tow truck slowly makes its way closer among the rest of the cars. Castiel flicks the indicator on. The steady tick-tick-tick counts out the seconds, punctuating the quiet as his words settle around them.
Daniel is shouting something at him as he struggles with the harness on his flak suit, but the interphone is a mess of garbled static, and the sound of rushing wind and the roar of the single remaining engine as it works overtime drowns out whatever it is he’s saying.
Castiel wishes desperately that he could join him in sleep, but he lost the ability when his grace was restored. As a compromise with himself, he meditates.
get a picture of dean with the dinosaur and send it to me
Looking at him, at the evidence of all he’s been through, Castiel feels such a strong surge of hatred for John Winchester that he doesn’t think he could suppress it if he tried.
From John’s perspective, it’s infinitely better for Dean to die of thirst than to risk possession for either of them, and the storm poses a threat that no amount of salt or sigils will lessen.
“And we’re planning on what, taking the nephilim out for a burger and a milkshake?” Dean scrubs at his face, reaching out to flip the tape that’s just ejected itself from the player. “You might be onto something, though. Can’t hurt to check it out.”
“I just... I want to go back, but... Charlie, what’s the point? We’re literally separated by sixty years. It’s not...”
The twitch of Dean’s throat when he swallows is gorgeous, and Castiel shakes his head. Wets his dry lips.
“Dean says that means that all the Muggles should be listening to Nirvana and doing jazz aerobics.”
“That’s very flattering, thank you.”
“I can list some more of your flaws if that would help,” Castiel offers, and smiles when Dean looks at him sharply.
“Uh, a manipulated image?” Dean supplies. “She thought it was fake.”
A creased, coffee stained sheet of unlined note paper. On the top right corner is a scribble of pen. Near this scribble is Dean's all-caps handwriting, which reads:
and we can relate to the characters more than anyone ever intended.”
“We’re lucky it’s not 2008 then. I need malt liquor and I need it now.”
Chewing on his lip, Dean casts around for a good explanation.
“Why would they be lies?”
“I can. But I understand if you want to spend some time with just the two of you.”
“C’mon out, Cas,” he calls, and Castiel peers around the wall before making his way toward them.
His hand squeezes Castiel's shoulder, and somehow, though he knows the action is meant to be one of comfort, Castiel finds it makes him furious. He tempers his reaction as best he can.
They could be out there. John could be right.
under her breath as she reaches for his cell.
“We could go for a drive?” Castiel suggests after a moment. “I know you wanted to see the Zephyr in person.”
Dean grins at him and grips his hands together, and Castiel slides his palm down over Dean’s chest to his stomach, leaning down to press his mouth to the place where his hand had been.
Pushing himself to his feet, Dean tries to forcibly shift his attention from the empty space where Cas should be, and looks at his brother instead. Looks at Jack. Meets them both head on.
The faucet over the sink is stiff, and it grinds when he turns it, but it doesn’t feel like he’s turned it at all. He’s watching himself as if from the other side of the room. Watching himself hold his hands under the steady stream. Watching the water splash over the edges of the basin, watching it darken his loose jeans, watching himself, a skeleton in papery skin.
“Then why the fuck is this so goddamn hard? If we both— Cas, if we both—if we all want you to be here, why is it so hard?”
Jo is captain of the debate team, and Sam is on track to eventually be the valedictorian of his graduating class, but right now they’re both crying so hard that they’re barely able to string a sentence together between them. Castiel can just make out the sound of Sam’s girlfriend Jess in the background, murmuring quiet, trying to calm them both down.
is the opposite of a problem, Cas.”
The drizzle that comes to prove him wrong a few minutes later isn’t enough to send them into the tent, but it does delay their plans to start on dinner for a while. To Castiel’s combined pleasure and dismay, Dean grabs his guitar from the truck and settles in to play in the shelter of one of the bur oaks at the edge of their clearing.
“Actually… Sam said you’d be staying here. Apparently I’m ‘not allowed’ to be left on my own. Benefit of the doubt would be nice, considering I’ve been nothing but helpful since I showed up, but whatever, I get it. You’re hunters, I’m a demon. Old dogs, new tricks, yada yada yada.”
He didn’t, though. Call it determination or call it cowardice, but either way he knows that the only way forward is through, and he couldn’t stand the idea of doing any of this over the phone.
The next time John stops driving, Dean’s mostly sure that they’re somewhere in Colorado. He feels delirious. Hungry and exhausted and so scared out of his mind that he’s barely capable of stringing two thoughts together, but he has the vague memory that he saw a sign for Rocky Mountain National Park, and the foliage that surrounds them reminds him of a camping trip they took with the Harvelles years ago, back before Bill had died. Jo had been so obsessed with FernGully that she kept obnoxiously singing the songs at him and Sam when they were all supposed to be sleeping.
among Dean’s scant few possessions.
“Hey, no-- wait,” Dean says, holding fast to Castiel’s hands to keep him from running away. “I want to be with you, Cas. But I don’t know how we can. You said it yourself, it’s an untenable situation. I can’t just stay here, man. I’ve got friends, family, a job back in my time. But every time I go home, we lose whole days. Weeks. Months. What if something happens to the jacket, or it just stops working? What if... hell, what if I get stuck on jury duty for a month and you spend five years here with no idea where I’ve gone? I can’t do that to you. I won’t do that to you.”
“Alright.”
They were fighting less than five minutes ago. Dean was shoving him against the bricks and cursing him. Now, they’re just looking at one another. Sharing space.
“We’re heading back to my place if you want to hang out,” Dean tells him, the words all leaving in a panicked rush, and Castiel wants to scream. Thankfully, Benny turns him down.
“Jesus,” he says eventually, and pushes himself up, pulling Castiel until they’re side by side at the head of the bed. His eyes are bright. He’s smiling like he can’t believe his luck. “No, you didn’t hurt me.”
It’s more like the kind of dreadful anticipation that comes when watching someone overfill a balloon. Every moment that it doesn’t burst means the moment when it will is just a little bit closer. Any second, any second, any second--
The coffee is burnt and bitter, the particles rearranged into a pattern that makes him wrinkle his nose, and he adds an unreasonable amount of sugar to counter the taste. When he takes another sip, he thinks of Nora back at the Gas N’ Sip in Idaho, constantly confused as to how they could possibly need to refill the sugar packets already.
“Deadly.”
“Yeah, there’s always something,” Dean says. He means it to come out in commiseration, but somehow it sounds accusatory, and in an instant the atmosphere in the Impala is as tense as it ever was. Dean feels pressure like a fist closed around his windpipe. He doesn’t know how to take it back.
“Then what is?”
“He did hear the confrontation, and of course the shots fired, but I don’t believe he saw anything when they brought him through the house.”
“Allow me,” Dean tells her, and points in the direction the sound is coming from. She nods.
“God, I missed you,” Dean tells him, and Castiel clutches him back.
“Yeah. Dr Vallens. She said to call her Mia. She seems okay… Ellen and Bobby are meeting with her now.” Dean’s mouth twitches a little, and he opens his eyes. “Which reminds me… how did that happen?”
Castiel looks up so sharply it’s a wonder he doesn’t hurt himself.
Somewhere, further down in the bunker, he knows that Dean will be waiting for him. He wonders if he’ll be able to stay with Jack for the whole time that Ruqayya needs him to remain asleep. If somehow, the passage of time will shift in a way that allows him to escape the most potentially damaging aspect of this fantasy.
He had told him, Cas realizes.
,” Dean groans.
Dean’s skin prickles, his heart thudding hard.
proud of you. We all are. But Cas knew it from the start.”
Castiel sighs, rubbing at his face and blinking hard.
“New Year’s Eve party at the bunker, remember? I told you about it days ago.”
“What--”
Seven cars ago, they were back in Nebraska.
“I’m glad you came.”
“I sure as hell don’t want to risk the trail going cold again.”
ask.”
He waves her off.
. He’s awaiting further instruction. Waiting, again, for Dean to tell him what he wants. Making him work for it.
“I know, Dean.”
The heavy thunk of his door is an abrupt and final end to a conversation that barely even started. Cas hesitates outside for the briefest moment, then climbs into his seat and doesn’t say another word.
“Cas isn’t my brother.”
“There’s a truck stop in Red Cloud,” Dean suggests. “The Red Robin. I’ll meet you there tonight.”
Dean gestures to himself and Castiel.
“I know, okay? I’m a moron. But I told him... I told him I wouldn’t want to sacrifice my whole life here to stay there. I basically told him he wasn’t enough. I didn’t mean it like that, but... fuck, that’s what he heard.
“Yes,” he says, gathering the books. “Let’s go.”
Dean doesn’t answer, just darts over to the next corner. Something rustles as he lifts the edge, and when his eyes land on an old, yellowed envelope, he can’t help but laugh.
Every afternoon, Dean would arrive at the library, wave at Sam through the study room window, and make himself comfortable on the nearest chair for the twenty minutes it would take Sam and his new friends to wrap things up. He usually just grabbed whichever book had the most interesting cover on the closest shelf. He’d read a few pages for something to do, then shove it back in place when Sam was done. A couple of weeks in, though, he’d started reading
“I apologize, that was--”
“You could say that about every day, for us.”
A low stone wall shows signs of previous attack where it’s crumbled in on itself. The charcoal remains of a few buildings stand like skeletons to the right. At first glance, he thinks the town has been deserted, but there’s a thin curl of smoke rising from one cottage’s chimney, and he crouches down behind a fallen oak to wait. To watch and see if anyone emerges.
“I just found it,” he says, grabbing the handbag from the footwell and holding it out toward John like a peace offering. “It was under the seat. I swear, Dad—I just found it.”
is the short drive home from Sam’s middle school dance, when Dean turned up the radio from the passenger seat and teased his red-faced brother about his poorly concealed crush on a girl from his English class—until Mom told him to cut it out unless he wanted Sam to be the only one getting ice-cream from the drive-thru on the way back to the house.
“Are you going to sleep?”
Dean reads it and smiles. It hurts, but it’s a good hurt. Knowing that there are pages on pages on pages of notes that he hasn’t seen. Little pieces of Cas that he can make his way through slowly. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get tired of knowing more of his thoughts, his opinions. His feelings.
For the past fifteen minutes, Castiel has been wrestling with Dean’s laptop. Its fan whirs noisily on his legs as it tries in vain to keep itself from overheating as it fruitlessly searches for a stronger signal.
Dean’s eyes go wide as though he wasn’t expecting the reply, and Cas can’t help but wonder if they’ve both been thinking the same thing this entire time. He lifts his own hand to mirror Dean’s. Dean’s pulse thunders against his palm, and Cas wracks his brain for some clue from the plethora of knowledge Metatron dumped in his head. Some idea of what Dean could mean by any of this.
He does.
“Around six and a half thousand miles,” he agrees immediately, and she frowns at him before briefly glancing over at one of the others.
“Are you tired, Cas?”
To his credit, Belphegor doesn’t comment on the slip.
“But?”
Dean wonders how far he’d get if he leapt into the driver’s seat. How long it would take him to get the ignition started. How many people John could hurt before Dean could drive far enough to find help. It’s not the first time he’s had a chance like this, but something always stops him. Too many people nearby. Too much risk that he’d somehow make things far worse.
“In Poland,” Castiel says quietly. “I wound up in this tiny village in Kampinos Forest. Sieraków.”
“Is that coffee?”
“You’ll think I’m crazy.”
By the time he reaches the supermarket, he’s so overwhelmed by everything he’s encountered that he barely wants to go inside. His stomach rumbles, though, and he’d told Dean he would bring back something for lunch, so he steps up to the door and lets out an undignified sound when it slides open on it’s own.
“Keep in touch, okay?” Sam adds, and in spite of everything, Castiel finds that he’s glad to hear it. He’s known since this started that Sam’s heart is in the right place—that his reservations and his reactions, as hurtful as they have been, have all come from a place of love--but it’s still a relief to be reminded that Sam doesn’t hate him. They might not be okay right now, and they might not be okay again for a while, but Sam still cares. Their friendship, however strained, is salvageable.
The mattress creaks when Castiel falls back against it, louder when Dean follows. His kisses are fervent, scattered all over Castiel’s cheeks and throat, and when Dean’s thumbs press against his hips, rubbing circles on the warm skin under Castiel’s shirt, his breath hitches. He doesn’t think twice about peeling it free and flinging it away.
Castiel takes several more photos of him looking flustered and disgruntled, and sends them to Claire before sliding his phone back into his pocket.
Because as Castiel sees it, War does not ride a red horse, but a gray one.
Picking up the laptop bag, Dean’s about to sling it over his shoulder when Castiel pulls it free of his grip and hooks it over his own. Dean’s hand makes an abortive motion as if to take it back. Castiel just catches it and starts walking toward the path marked with a sign for
,” Dean gasps, squeezing his hands so tightly together that Castiel can see his knuckles turning white. “I’ve created a monster.”
A couple in their forties, drowned in their outdoor spa;  a woman whose insides have slithered out through a long, deep slash from her chin to her navel; three men with burst blood vessels in their eyes and dark bruises circling their throats, and last, a guy around Claire’s age, who seems to have broken his neck falling down the stairs in his desperation to get away from whatever was chasing him.
“Sorry,” he says after he’s caught his breath. “How long was I gone?”
With Lisa, he made the opposite mistake. Every song was one she already loved, and there was none of him in it at all. Though they’d only dated for a couple of weeks after he’d given it to her, she’d played it on repeat every time they hung out, and Dean had wanted to scream. He hated every single song.
“Dean called it ’testing’,” Henriksen says, pursing his lips in visible discomfort for a moment before he resumes his professionally stoic expression. “John would cut him every day to make sure— to prove that he was still human.”
“We live through this. Lose great friend, family. We will not lose our home,” Bartłomiej says firmly.
There’s blood on his lips; more running down his ear. Dean can’t tell if it’s his or someone else's, and it’s only when he’s trying to figure that out that he notices the demon’s absence.
Try as he might, Castiel can’t quite seem to get his mind off him. Even while he’s at work, attempting to let the slow and steady push of the broom on the store’s front stoop hypnotize him into calm, he still can’t pull his thoughts far from Dean.
It’s with a sickening lurch that Dean wonders if this is what John had seen in Mary when he killed her. If this is what he saw in Sam. Some twisted thing crawling just beneath the surface, making a familiar face look like an ill-fitting mask. The skin of his wife stretched over a monster’s frame.
Castiel’s grip in his hair tightens, and Dean takes it as his cue to take him fully into his mouth. Dean sinks down, the ridges at the roof of his mouth creating an exquisite friction that no hand has ever given Castiel. It’s almost too much. Squeezing his eyes shut, Castiel musters every ounce of self control he has to keep from coming.
Dean’s stiff expression makes Castiel’s chest ache, and he can’t help but reach out to touch his hand where it still rests on the seat between them. Tension visibly drains from Dean’s shoulders. He shoots Castiel a grateful smile.
Talking is hard, but this? This, Dean can do. If Castiel needs a distraction, Dean’s more than willing to provide it in whatever way he needs.
. He flinches, and Jack rips his hand away, staggers back like he thinks he’s the cause of it.
“What?” Dean asks.
As he carefully draws arcane symbols onto the door and window frames with a black marker, he entertains a daydream in which John gets caught in the town. Maybe he’ll try to steal from the wrong person and get knocked out cold before he can do them any harm. The police will come, and they’ll figure out who John is, and they’ll find Dean, and he’ll be saved.
Castiel lets the remaining threads of his grace curl around what’s left of Dean’s soul, and at once, his kiss grows rougher. Harder. More desperate. Biting.
Dean grins down at him through the opening, and Castiel’s heart thuds at the sight.
Dean’s eyes cross when he comes, his throat bared as he gasps and digs his fingers into the pillow and Castiel’s shoulder, and Castiel thinks he’s found a new religion. Still straddling Dean’s thighs, he wipes his hand on a blanket that feels softer than usual as he moves up to kiss him.
say it, though he recalls slightly different verbiage—and Dean reaches across the seat to prod him in the side.
An elderly woman is sitting at the far end of a bench beneath one of the birch trees that line the parking lot, and Castiel drops heavily into the space she’s left vacant as he tries to pull himself together. He knows he should force himself to go back inside. It’s selfish, what he’s doing here. Irrational.
His voice is raw, and the sound of it rolls through Dean like thunder.
“Castiel.”
Castiel stops in a space beside a beige utility truck similar to the one he’s been driving all year, and as he leans against the hood of the Impala while Dean uses the restroom, he’s shocked by the sudden realization that he actually misses driving it.
Until now, despite everything, there was still the smallest possibility that none of this was real. There was still a chance that some TV host was about to burst into the room and announce that he’d been fooled on some mind-fuck hidden camera show. Now, though... Henry is standing right there, exactly how he looked in pictures, and Dean’s head is spinning.
Castiel is touching him, everywhere he can, but it’s slow and sweet. Like Dean is something precious and Castiel is trying to love every single part of him in equal measure. Running his wide palms over Dean’s thighs, his hips, his back, Castiel steps in as close as he can, shuffling forward until he’s got one foot between Dean’s. He holds Dean close, chest to chest, and Dean can’t help but melt into him. He’s so warm. Feels safe, Dean thinks, to be this close.
Charlie gapes.
After a hectic whirlwind of activity—Kevin’s brief and painful return, Ketch showing up to be a vaguely useful pain in the ass before being possessed and hospitalized, and another couple of civilians wandering back into the town against all rationality and getting themselves unceremoniously slaughtered—they’re right back where they started.
Dean makes it up the hall, up the stairs, and halfway through the library before he stumbles over his feet, and Sam catches him around the shoulders, steadies him, says, “
“Mm, yeah. Next time. Can’t wait.”
Castiel points it out to Dean, who laughs, “There’s a different joke up there every time I come through,” before leading him into the squat brick building. Inside, he orders a burger so enormous that the fries come served on their own separate plate out of sheer necessity.
“I’m on it,” Shurley says, voice determined and ready to help the young bombardier as soon as Turner gets him out of his turret.
, Castiel realizes, and though the taste isn’t exactly something he’d seek out on its own, knowing the reason it’s there makes him want to chase it. Wants to know Dean’s taste, too, to find out if they’re the same or similar or completely different.
“In here!” Jack’s voice is closer now, bouncing off the walls and reverberating in Dean’s skull, making his head spin. It’s too loud. Too close. Too much. “Dean, what are you—are you okay?”
“I’m, uh. Speaking of cards? Same here.”
“So bring up the turntable,” she suggests.
Dean wanders the halls, uncertain whether he’s looking for Cas or avoiding him, and eventually finds Rowena instead, sitting with her legs crossed in one of the science classrooms and touching up her lipstick in a compact mirror. She hasn’t even started the spell.
“You might want to sit down.”
Castiel doesn’t mean to eavesdrop, but while he stands at the water cooler waiting for his paper cup to fill, he notices Bobby sitting up straighter in his chair. When he speaks again, it’s in the tone he usually reserves for suppliers who try to screw him over or Castiel when he’s feeling particularly argumentative.
Dean is ready to leave less than ten minutes later, pushing Castiel toward the door with a hand between his shoulder blades before ducking into the front-room-turned-studio to hug his mom goodbye.
“I’m serious, Dean. You’re wonderful. I love you. I need you to know that.”
“I did, but time ran at a different speed there. Every second here is a minute there. Almost every time I went back, it was like months had passed even if it was only a few days for me. Shit, I need to-- do you have a pen?”
“We’ll figure it out,” Dean says.
Castiel can’t hold back. He retches into the leaves, slumped onto the ground on his hands and knees, and wheezes in the cold once his stomach is empty and his throat is raw with the acidic burn of vomit.
“I can just barely smell gas here,” he says with a shrug. “No more than usual, though.”
“Right. Yeah, of course. I guess, um... I guess I’ll see you, then.”
He clears his throat.
“Mm. Well, lucky for us, he’d heard she was missing, so he played along, agreed to meet with her, then reported the call. That’s how Nance got wind of it.”
“Yeah, I know,” Castiel smiles at him, and looks toward the door. “It might be wise to go get some rest in my own room.”
“Liking you less with every word, sweetheart.”
“Yeah, this shit’s real subtle, Sam,” Dean snorts to himself. He figures it’s a symptom of straight guy bias, and decides to just be impressed that his brother managed to avoid assuming that Castiel simply wanted to play a rousing game of baseball with the old movie star turned air force major.
There’s a crease between Dean’s eyebrows that Castiel wishes he could smooth away, but he knows that until things with Sam have been fixed, it’s something he’ll have to get used to. But he can’t fix it with a note.
“Did she ever teach you?”
Here,” he says, and ushers them inside, waving off their thanks before heading back down the hallway, presumably to do the job he’s supposed to have been doing this whole time.
“Point taken.”
“In a minute, just—” Dean falters for a moment before he finds his footing and continues. “Before you go. Will you do me a favour?”
“He helped a lost child find her sister. He had a bright soul.”
Dean lets out a shuddering breath, squeezing his hand tight around Castiel’s, before he lets go and sits back up, swinging his legs off the side of the bed. His bare shoulders are hunched forward, his freckled skin almost glowing in the filtered fluorescent light of the vacancy sign that seeps through the thin curtains.
“I didn’t know that, either,” Castiel tells him with a laugh.
“Curse box? Hell, we could throw it in the Ma’lek box and fill it with cement. But we can figure that out later.” He glances at Rowena again, and shuffles on his feet. “Assuming you’ll do it, that is.”
“Dean? Breathe. You need to breathe.”
God, what he would give to feel clean.
Castiel flinches, recognizing the speaker a moment too late to feign indifference to the comment, and Benny smirks from where he leans against the fire door he’s opened from inside. Rather than respond, Castiel just doubles down on his frown, and tries not to notice the way Dean’s expression closes off.
“I have a reliable source.”
“I’m getting up,” Castiel repeats. He assumes it’s too dark for Dean to tell that he’s lying.
“Almost seven. But it’s alright.”
Dean gestures toward the coffee table, and Castiel looks to see a duffel bag.
“Astute observation there, little brother. That college education really picks its moments to shine through.”
That afternoon, they gather in the courtyard with the dogs of Harlan, and try to come up with plan B.
I have no excuse for this appallingly delayed update--or my horrific two year absence from posting anything at all--apart from awful, soul-crushingly debilitating writers block. Hopefully the drought is over. I hope this chapter was okay, and thank you for reading <3
“Should we join the others?”
No, we don't know her, but she is pregnant 🤰with Lucifer’s child, so it is imperative that we find her as soon as possible. 😖
The man is humming tunelessly as he cooks, and he nods to the music playing from a record player by the wall. Jazz. Sounds like Charlie Parker. Dean just listened to this song with Charlie.
The B-17 above it is hit by shrapnel, and though the whole thing lurches with the impact, it keeps on keeping on.
The bunker door is unlocked when he arrives, and Castiel slips inside to find Jack reclining on one of the leather chairs overlooking the map room. He’s reading, but it isn’t research—it’s Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
!” she exclaims, blushing deeply. Castiel’s Polish might be rudimentary at best, but he knows an embarrassed kid when he sees one.
“It’s so good to see you, Dean,” Sam tells him, and Dean nods rapidly, but his eyes seem wide and anxious, his breathing loud and unsteady.
“Yes,” she says, nodding.
In the doorway, he pauses to kiss the corner of Dean’s mouth.
“That was music?”
It’s getting dark when the trees begin to thin out, and through them Castiel sees a village. He stops at the edge of the tree line to survey it.
“Dean?” he asks, hand tense on Dean’s knee. Dean just shakes his head, reaching down to grip himself around the base, hard, as he catches his breath. “Did I hurt you?”
Dean can’t help but laugh.
Castiel raises his brow.
“Hey Donna, you’re on speaker. Cas is here, too.”
For once in his life, he should have just owned it. Should have just said,
for chrissake. Who even
“What are you--?”
“This way, Cas,” he says, tugging him back toward the open rear passenger door of the Impala as though he thinks Castiel missed it. “C’mon.”
Dean is inside. Dean is in reach. Castiel should be with him, offering comfort in whatever way he’s able—not out here, having a goddamn panic attack.
The djinn glance at one another. Something silent passes between them, and they move, descending on him from every direction.
“Wait… a year, two weeks and three days?”
of this. Surreptitiously, he slides the thumb of his right hand under the edge of his seatbelt and tugs to make sure it’s firmly in place. Just in case.
“Is that what this is?”
“When was this released?” he asks after a while, blinking his eyes back into focus as he looks at Dean.
Dean just nods.
“Let’s save it for dinner. I have a better idea.”
With a smile, Castiel closes their door and moves to pull his thoroughly creased coat and jacket out from under the pile, along with Dean’s suit bag. He hangs them on the hook by the door before sitting down on the edge of the mattress. It’s not nearly as comfortable as Dean’s memory foam, but unlike the bed they shared in Red Cloud, it doesn’t creak every time he moves.
“I already packed marsh—”
Frowning, he sits up.
Dean is waiting in the middle of the living room.
Inside the office, the clerk at the desk is a middle-aged man with a pair of wire-framed glasses perched on his nose. He looks up from his cell phone when he hears Castiel enter. It’s strange to think that the Castiel of a few years ago would have been uncertain how to proceed.
With a nod, Castiel turns and hurries into his bedroom. He returns a few moments later with a camera in his hands. It whirs as he winds the film.
“Shut up, I’m freaked out. I can’t help what my eyes do. How--”
Dean rubs at the back of his neck.
three days for Dean. He probably had a long day and had to sleep. Or he got stuck at the grocery store buying the sugar and honey and coffee that Castiel admitted to wanting.
Dean widens his eyes.
“You’re serious.”
“What can I say? She’s my best girl.”
When he passes a couple in the bakery section, two men walking together, one with his hand resting on the other’s lower back, he thinks he could
He sinks onto the floor against the wall, wrapping the blanket around his shoulders, and tries and tries and tries to make the trembling stop. His eyes closed, he conjures the image of the record spinning. The warm scent of vinyl.
He breathes in through his nose. A deep breath. Out through the mouth. It’s fine. It’s fine. He’s
“God, you’re an asshole.”
Sam laughs again, like this is all a big joke, and Castiel grinds his teeth. He’s making things so much worse, and he’s completely oblivious. Even through the walls, he can feel Dean’s anger seething close to the surface.
The twenty-seven minutes it takes to drive from Red Cloud back to the Bunker are among the most nerve wracking Castiel has ever experienced. Following the Impala in his truck, his mind spirals around a thousand different scenarios, each ending more horribly than the last.
Determined to get to the bottom of it, Castiel pushes himself to his feet and heads for the stairs, making his way down to the entryway that his apartment shares with North Street Finery and rapping lightly on the tailor’s glass door.
“Okay, well… I’m gonna grab some more coffee. You guys want refills?”
Triceratops are your favorite dinosaur. 🦕🦖🥰
Cas glances at the glowing alarm clock.
“Of course I am.”
Though he knows it may be fruitless—in every sense of the word—he moves closer, clambering over rubble and rock, just in case there’s something more to be found. The energy is still there, after all. It called to him. Still calls.
“Anyway,” Castiel says after a while, when Dean’s swinging grows faster. “As much as I’d like to take a road trip with you, I don’t think my hypothetical move to Massachusetts is the best time for it. We’d need to take my car, and you’d end up having to fly back here after.”
“I don’t need a weapon to hurt you,” Dean bites out. Castiel doesn’t even flinch.
“I’m not making you a dress out of a curtain,” Dean tells her flatly. “It’s too thick. The drape will be all wrong.”
“It’s an hour a minute, right? I’ll be as fast as I can.”
Sam’s grip tightens on the wheel as he looks over at Castiel, a pained expression aging his features.
“That’s good. When I spoke with Sam last, he wasn’t sure how much longer the hunt was going to take.”
With his mother’s encouragement, he applied to a community college just outside Normal that offered a course in fashion design and tailoring, and was accepted.
The crinkling bag swings from Castiel’s elbow as he walks back toward the apartment. As he walks
“You don’t have to thank me for not being an asshole.”
“Look what they’ve done to you,” he says, as though he has no idea that he’s the one who did this. He drops Dean’s hand and reaches for the other, and Dean’s so scared that he’s going to break it, too, that he struggles. “Hold still,” John tells him. “I need to be sure.” Dean holds still, and before he can process what’s happening, John produces a knife from God knows where and slices into Dean’s hand. He watches intently as blood fills Dean’s palm.
The tension he’d felt on the phone is back, and it’s even worse up close. He has the feeling that if he’s not careful, a breath could make it snap.
Castiel squints, suspicious.
Castiel is trying not to let the disappearing days get to him. When a hundred and twenty days came and went with no visit, he told himself not to fret. Dean’s got a life in his own time. A job. Family. Friends.
Dean swallows and nods.
“Actually what?”
The door slams in their faces before either of them can say another word, and Castiel can hear Parker rushing off into his house to call his wife. He looks over at Dean.
“Why’d you say that?”
“I spoke to Mom this morning. She’s spending the rest of the day with Wally’s sister, but she said she’d head back here tonight.”
The tape he’d made for Cassie was poorly planned. He only included songs that he liked, and didn’t give a whole lot of thought to finding ones that she would. It was an autobiography, concerned more with telling her,
Grunting with effort, he drags it out into a patch of slanted afternoon sunlight in front of the mirror and uses Henry’s screwdriver to pry the latch. It opens with a groan, and Dean’s mouth falls open when he looks inside.
Claire responds almost instantly and without punctuation.
His phone, inching across the concrete floor; his back, radiating pain where it collided with the wall; his trembling hands, his chest, his every last cell screaming out like a swarm of enraged hornets.
“I had help.”
“Reasonably, yeah. The baby is a
Jack is out of his chair and hugging him before he knows what’s happening, and he holds on tight. It’s a long time before he lets go, and when he does, Dean’s face is as tear-streaked as Jack’s is. He doesn’t try to hide it. Doesn’t want Jack to feel like either of them need to do anything but be honest about how much this hurts, how big of a hole there is in a world without Cas.
Castiel hums to himself, thinking, before he settles on a topic that’s bound to distract Dean from his worries for at least as long as it takes them to get to Monroe City.
“I’m fine,” he says on impulse, but the pain radiates even as it dulls, like the reverberating hum of a church bell. He feels it from toes to teeth.
Reaching out, she touches the tree, and lines of power flow between her fingertips and the bark. It shimmers all over when she moves her hand away.
“Lieutenant Castiel Novak,” he says, and tries for a smile. “Call me Cas.”
“Sometimes. It has grown a great many things over the years. Pomegranates and limes. Apples. Lychee. It grows whatever is needed.” She smiles at him. “Even before the fire, it hasn’t looked so healthy since Ophaniel left.”
Dean wants to tell him, but he knows he’s going to be playing back his own saved voicemails the moment he gets a chance. Besides, the silence feels impenetrable. Like it’s the only thing keeping them both from bursting.
“Barely,” Castiel repeats.
“I did not know that,” Castiel tells him, even though he did. He still recalls every detail of every book that Metatron stuffed into his head, but he also knows that Jack loves to share facts as he learns them, and he’d rather let him think that he’s taught Castiel something new than to see the disappointed expression he gets when someone just tells him,
The late afternoon sun turns the sky pink and gold, making the forest far more beautiful than it has any business being on such a day, and he trudges onward as the mud grows thicker. Turns to sticky sludge that slows him down and pulls at his feet. He wants to lie down and let it claim him. He keeps on walking.
Dean kisses him.
As they loop in his head, again and again, he comes to realize that they have. He’s changed. Everything has changed.
When Sam finally appears onscreen, he’s fuzzy and glitching.
He takes another freezing breath. Grits his teeth until his jaw aches.
They fall silent, and Dean doesn’t look at him. He can’t. He wants to ask Cas if he’s okay; wants to talk to him about this mess they’re in, losing Mom, losing Jack, his waning powers, how fucking hopeless this all feels and how much he needs to know that they’re all still in this together.
“Do you need anything, before I have to go? A magazine, or something to eat?” he asks. “I could run down to the gift sh—”
For a moment, it seems as though Dean believes him, but then he hesitantly touches the buttons of Castiel’s shirt before dropping his hands away.
Picking up the fork, Dean pokes at the cake again.
Without anything else to do, and no ability to focus on anything he tries to watch on TV, he heads downstairs to the shop and flips on the light. The smell of cotton and dressmakers chalk is instantly soothing, and he breathes deeply for a moment before heading properly inside.
“I was thinking that the main reason why there’s so little information available on nephilim is because they’re so rare. And they’re rare because angels are forbidden from engaging with humans sexually—”
“He’s camped out by the roadblock on the other side of town. Left a couple other agents with him.”
Nodding, Dean casts his gaze around the room. Castiel notices his eyes settling briefly on a desk by the back wall, the cupboard underneath open to reveal the code panel of a safe. On top of the desk, a small fiberglass case with a combination lock lies on its side.
Distantly, he hears a woman’s voice, and Sam clears his throat.
“By telling you that it’s taking longer than I’d like for an injury to heal?”
“Shit,” Dean laughs.
“You can,” Dean says. “Please. Consider it reparations for me walking in on you in the shower.”
Thankfully, the lights dim to signal the end of the trailers before Dean’s finished speaking, and Castiel is spared the horror of making eye contact with him as the movie starts.
“I want you to ask.”
“Yeah, and Cas is family, so I figured you’d be just as skeeved.”
“I don’t think so. But see the bees around the collar?”
He waits for the rest of the crew to jump first, helps Gabriel to fasten his chute when the gunner can’t get the connector to stick. Gabriel winks at Castiel before he jumps, his expression as cocky as ever despite the fear in his eyes. A pain in the ass to the very end, is Gabriel. Castiel hopes desperately that he’ll get to see his face again, if only so he can slap it.
The air in the dungeon is tar-thick and heavy, and every breath is harder than the last. It leaves a taste like ozone on the back of Dean’s tongue. Crawls down into his lungs like some creeping miasmic specter intent on choking him from within.
The answer, as it turns out, is
Castiel grinds his teeth.
“Or?”
“I’m nobody,” Dean says. “My grandfather owned the shop downstairs. He left it to me when he died.”
For his own part, Castiel has given him more openings than his pride would like him to admit, but Dean’s played things so close to his chest the entire time that Castiel has always assumed he didn’t want to deal with it at all.
Dean could get out only to have the clouds descend on him, to have black smoke curl down his throat, and—
While they wait for Sam to call, they set themselves up at a picnic table near the center of the zoo, close enough to the lions that the occasional roar reaches them where they sit.
Castiel sighs in defeat—he
“Yeah,” Dean says, and Benny winks as he knocks his knuckles on Dean’s shoulder.
Lying down along the seat, Dean closes his eyes and  braces one arm across his face to block out the late afternoon sun. The angel blade he’s carrying in the back of his jeans digs into his hip, and he grunts in discomfort before he shifts it to his jacket’s inside pocket. Letting himself get some actual sleep may be a pipe dream right now with everything that’s piling on his shoulders, but he can rest.
Castiel feels his cheeks burning, but he ignores Dean’s comment, closing his eyes and taking a slow sip. When he opens his eyes again, he finds Dean watching him with an expression of unguarded interest that he quickly schools into something far less readable.
“So I’ll know how far off the reservation I am.”
For the entire drive back to Wichita, Sam doesn’t stop fidgeting. He shifts in the passenger seat, jostles his long legs, adjusts the radio dial often enough that Jo flicks him in the back of the ear and tells him to “Leave it the hell alone, Sam.”
“What did she say?”
. But the words tangle on his tongue, lodge in his throat like they physically can’t get past the solid lump that’s grown there, so he shakes his head. It’s a stiff jerk of a motion that makes something twinge in his neck, like his body itself is protesting the admission that he failed to keep Cas safe. Jack says something, lets out an anguished noise that makes Dean wish he’d been taken too. In his chest, his heart seizes as though Billie is crushing it all over again, and at once he’s spiralling again, pulse hitching and racing in a fractured rhythm. His hands prickle; his eyes unfocus. Darkness creeps at the edges of his vision, narrowing everything down to a single point until he feels like he’s falling down an endless well, staring up at the light as it gets further and further out of reach.
, though I’m glad to learn it has such an effect,” Castiel says, and sends another wave through him, lets the full force of his love wind in and around Dean’s body alongside the grace. Lets it hold him in a way that Castiel’s physical form is too limited to allow. “I meant
“He came out of the forest after a couple of days, barely a scratch on him, and about a week later he was flying another B-17 that had lost its pilot.”
“I mean I’ve had enough, Cas. I’m tired, and I don’t— I don’t see the point in ignoring this anymore. I haven’t really seen the point in a while. Didn’t want to rock the boat, I guess, but now…”
“Not nineteen forty-five,” Dean says weakly.
“Don’t try to be coy, it doesn’t suit you.”
But Cas only saw the love in him. Cas looked at him, all of him, the ugly parts and the violent parts and the parts that made Dean want to hide, and saw nothing but the love that fuels him from within.
He’s never getting away. He’s never going home.
Nothing is ever easy. Nothing is ever alright. Even here, in the middle of a war-torn country, surrounded by constant suffering for years on end, it seems that there’s always room for God to have let them down in one more way.
For a long, trembling moment, he grips the rain-damp bough nearest to him and listens for voices while he catches his breath. There’s nothing beyond the drip of old rain, and the shift of leaves in the breeze, and further off, the persistent pop of gunfire. Every now and then, he hears the crash of another plane being hit. He tries not to wonder if it’s one of theirs.
By nine o’clock, the sun is sweltering, and they’ve caught five fish between them—three mid-sized saugeye, a white bass big enough to feed them both, and a little fish slightly smaller than Castiel’s palm that Dean insists is called a
He’s expecting Dean to grip his hips. His thighs. For Dean to haul him close and rock against him with the fervor he sees in his eyes. But he doesn’t. Instead, his hands just slide up Castiel’s chest, fingers soft against his throat, skimming over his lips and the shell of his ear before curving around the back of his neck and into his hair.
“Cas didn’t come here on purpose,” Dean says. Charlie’s face falls.
With sharking hands, he slides the antenna out and presses his thumb hard against the power button. The screen stays dark. Nothing happens.
Several booths and tables are taken up by groups of teenagers killing time before they head over to the nearby high school, and the counter is full of truckers and locals alike, some chatting, some hunkered down with newspapers and ignoring the people around them.
He stops walking, and Dean bumps right into him.
Castiel’s mind races, trying to figure out what on Earth he’s ever done that would warrant a panic attack, and— something clicks. A puzzle piece sliding into place in Castiel’s mind.
“Then I’m sorry, too.”
It’s home, that smell.
He heads off toward the restaurant with a little wave, and Castiel watches Dean watching him leave until he can’t bear it any longer. It’s only a few seconds, but it feels like an eternity. He clears his throat.
“Perhaps you’re just getting easier to track,” Castiel retorts, and tilts his head when Dean steps forward, eyes flicking back to green as he shifts further into the dim light. “Though I expect that’s by design.”
“Yeah. We talked.”
“Could you bring another cup of coffee? My… friend has just arrived.”
“Sam’s gonna call soon,” Dean points out with a shrug. “And I don’t wanna lose our table.”
“I will be.”
“I can make baked potatoes with dinner, too,” Castiel says with a nod. “And I brought lemons for the fish.”
“We’ll have to come back some other time,” he says, slipping around Castiel’s waist as he stands at the edge of the railing. “Next time we’re over this way for a hunt, maybe?”
“You were thinking it,” Dean says, then frowns. “You
Suddenly, it’s not enough. He pushes at Dean’s shoulder with his free hand, flipping them over and working Dean’s jeans down and out of the way so he can see what he’s doing. The sight makes him lightheaded, his heart pounding, and though he’s just barely recovered from his own climax he feels his cock give a feeble twitch as he takes in Dean’s state.
He smiles, as much as he’s able, and shifts into gear.
He feels untethered, as though he’s adrift in the open ocean and not comfortably swimming in the narrowest part of a man-made lake. Dean is swimming toward him, and Castiel can tell that when he catches up, there’s going to be a scuffle.
“It can’t be that bad,” he says, but almost as soon as he takes his first sip, he wrinkles his nose and lets his mouth fall open so it sloshes noisily back into the cup. Just for a moment, Castiel genuinely wonders what he sees in him.
Dean pulls back slightly, searching Castiel’s face with intensity, and whatever he was looking for must be there in spades, because between one moment and the next his hand lifts from Castiel’s waist to curl over his jaw, and Castiel is lost in the warmth of their lips pressed together. At last.
The man just squints up at him, like he’s insane. Dean clears his throat and pushes to his feet.
As he shuffles back, Dean doesn’t take his eyes off Castiel. His expression is unguarded as Castiel has ever seen him, nervous but eager as he props himself up on his elbows, and Castiel feels a swell of pride at the sight of him so trusting and open and content, even here in this dusty room at the end of another world.
By the end of the week, Grandpa Henry was letting him mark the fabric with chalk, and though he was not allowed to use the big, heavy scissors, he could watch from close by as they chomped along the lines he’d drawn. When customers came back to try on their freshly tailored suits and flowing dresses, they’d smile and turn on the spot to look in the mirror, and on their way out they’d ruffle his hair and tell him what a clever boy he was. They were always so happy when they left.
on the minutes, but I think around twenty-seven.”
“We can prove it.”
“Yeah, kid?”
Dean doesn’t know who he’ll be on the other side of this nightmare. He doesn’t know what life after this is going to look like. If he’ll even have one.
,” Castiel allows.
He clicks his tongue twice before doing just that, setting it up against the wall and sliding one of the records from its sleeve. Something slips out and disappears under the armchair.
Slowly, Castiel lowers his hands.
“No. Maybe. A little.”
He doesn’t think twice about snapping a photo, and Castiel startles at the flash.
“Well, if you’ve forgotten even a second of what you went through in Hell, even the escape, that’s probably for the best. It’s certainly not something you should feel sorry about.”
“I just want to take care of you,” Castiel says, and Dean almost seems to melt against his hands.
is what it is to belong. He hopes Dean can feel it, too.
“Yeah, maybe,” Castiel says, then shivers, the night air growing steadily more frigid the longer they sit here, the misty drizzle clinging to everything. “Should we keep walking?”
“You don’t need to.”
Dean shrugs.
“I kept getting hungry during debate practice,” Castiel says with a shrug. “Beef or chicken?”
sound, just as his cell phone buzzes in his pocket. He digs it out and taps at the screen.
“Huh,” Dean bites down on a Red Vine and grins around it as he asks, “Eaten a lot of ass lately, Cas?”
“Not great,” Castiel agrees.
to leave,” he says.
he sings under his breath, biting back the involuntary gasp that comes with another crack of thunder. It throws him off, the next line skittering out of reach, so he squeezes his eyes shut even tighter and presses his fingers harder against the carved symbols in the baseboard and
It all still feels like a dream. When his alarm bullied him into consciousness a little after 5am, he’d stared at it for a solid few seconds, convinced that he’d set it in error until his memory of the previous day came rushing back all at once.
“Something about how he ‘understands now’ that asking me to be with him was unfair or something. Like, he thought I was just offering myself to him because he had no place else to go. But that… I told him I wanted to be with him. Even when I went back the last time before he came here, I was-- shit.
Dean kisses him once more before he pulls away to watch Castiel rocking into his hand. He lets Castiel do all the work for a moment, just keeping a loose fist in place while Castiel’s body arches off the mattress, and then shuffles down to press his mouth to his thigh, nosing along the crease of his leg so his breath washes warm over Castiel’s erection.
“I’m yours, Dean. I belong to you.”
“Hm?”
Looking at his hand is a mistake. It’s twisted to one side, sitting at an unnatural angle that makes him queasy to see, and bruises in the shape of John’s fingers extend from just below his thumb, down his forearm. Every attempt at moving his fingers is less successful than the last.
“For what?”
“Three-ish in the afternoon. Couldn’t focus at work, so I closed up early. Will anywhere still be open?”
last summer,” Bill says with a shudder, and Dean decides quickly that whatever story Bill is about to start telling him, he’s really not in the mood to hear it.
“I don’t wanna wait for midnight.”
Lover man, where can you be? Billie Holiday sings, and Dean completes the circle as her refrain fades out to nothing.
“Remind me to bring my laptop next time. I’ll show you
“The jacket,” he breathes. “Shit. I didn’t-- I forgot. I should have stopped you, but I just… I forgot.”
John starts shaking his head before Dean’s even finished speaking.
He sees hundreds of stories that go just as their had, and they all end with kisses at midnight.
“You sayin’ I’m your sweetheart, Castiel?”
“Did you know that Harry Potter is set in the early nineties?”
Castiel dispatches them all with relative ease. He lays his hand on the forehead of the eighth as he sinks his blade into the gut of the ninth. His hands feel slick with blood. He hates it. Hates that it always comes to this, to
He’s grown used to the weight of the Impala over these past few hours; has become familiar with the way it moves; the perfect pressure to exert upon the gas and the brake to make it handle as smoothly as it does under Dean’s control.
“I thought,” she laughs, breathy and bright, her light eyes damp as she lowers her hand to her chest. “You look just like someone I met as a child.”
yourself of—“
“Low-key dominance kink?” Dean offers, his cheeks redder than ever. Castiel tilts his head to the side, studying his face.
“I got a message from Sam just now.”
“Though… it might be worth trying some other avenues of healing, once we’ve dealt with Hell. I can’t be certain that my powers aren’t the issue.”
“Shit,” Dean says after a moment, and Castiel can’t help himself. He bursts out laughing.
“Something’s wrong,” Dean insists. “I can tell.”
Castiel reaches out his hand.
Castiel relishes it anyway. He might be an angel again, but he’s still human enough to be tainted by greed.
His entire body feels liquid. Formless. Reaching out beyond his edges, beyond his physical presence and all the way out to his wing tips in the ether. He’s trembling electric, sound and color. He presses his eyes closed, his forehead resting against Dean’s, and breathes.
Castiel’s mouth twitches before he can control himself. The tension comes back full-force.
“You good there, Cas?”
Castiel knows it’s not intended as such—he’s not exactly practiced in this arena, after all, and they both know it—but he can’t help but take Dean’s words as a challenge. Pulling back, he pushes at Dean’s shoulder until he lies down again, his head pillowed on the backpack.
“Jules is the only one who was close enough to get here fast.”
“But I can’t just leave my—”
He flattens his palm over Dean’s heart, tilting his head up, toward Dean, and is rewarded with another kiss.
“I’m sorry,” Hannah says. “I don’t know why. But I can break it. That would probably send you back.”
“What you said back there,” he starts, hands shifting restlessly on the steering wheel as his eyes flick to the side. “You know we all love you too, right?”
He takes his time, breathes against Dean’s skin. Darts his tongue out to taste the salt of him. Bites and licks and strokes over his chest with his fingers until Dean is breathing heavily and gripping the pillow to keep his hands occupied.
It’s half past one in the afternoon by the time they get to the zoo, Castiel freshly outfitted in a navy sweater and a pair of jeans that allow a full range of movement. He’s still not convinced that the clothing change was truly necessary—within minutes of walking through the park gates, they passed a man in a trench coat almost identical to Castiel’s—but given the appreciative looks that Dean has been giving him ever since he stepped out of the department store fitting room, he’s decided that he no longer cares.
“Turns out, uh… Cas made a deal. Back when we lost Jack. When we broke him out of Heaven.”
Castiel knows, without a shadow of doubt, that if things were the other way around, Dean would make some joke about Castiel only wanting to get him out of his clothes. Dean looks so stricken that Castiel can’t even bring himself to attempt humor. He sighs, unbuttoning his shirt until Dean takes over, and then he just waits as his skin is exposed to the cool air.
“I only have three quarters,” Castiel tells him.
“Yeah,” he says on a breath. “Yes, it’s me.”
Castiel sneaks a quick glance at him, wary of inviting another reminder to keep his focus forever trained on the road ahead. He finds Dean wide eyed and startled into silence.
Ballard had been the lead detective on Dean’s case, right up until Henriksen took over, and at the sound of their voices echoing out to where he stands, Castiel feels his reaction to being here again grow all the more visceral.
The trees beyond the school grounds shield the electric-red flash of the ghost barrier from view, and the only sound for miles is the breeze and the song of those same cheerful birds he noticed yesterday. They sing as they flit from branch to branch, and as he climbs the bleachers he listens to them. Almost envies them for their carefree lives.
“Where are we going?” he asks.
“I wasn’t aware you planned to swing in the first place,” Castiel says after a moment, and Dean lets out a surprised laugh.
The need to prove Cas right is suddenly all he can think about. To make
ever it is, it’s not John.
But that’s all secondary. He wants to help him. If there’s some way he can figure out where Daniel Fisher is, he’s going to do it. Castiel has been through hell. He deserves to be happy.
(Or, a smaller, part of him wonders--did Cas secretly want this for the two of them, a family of their own? Did he inadvertently pass that longing to Jack, somehow?)
“Aren’t you tired, Cas?”
“Fuck. Yeah, I know you do, Cas,” Dean stares at his lips for a moment before he meets Castiel’s eyes again. “You’re really not gonna kiss me again until we talk this out?”
“I just can’t figure out that first day. Why did it take me to you
“Little over seven months. How long for you?”
Shifting in his seat, Dean twists to find a comfortable position. He rolls his neck until it makes an audible pop. Castiel frowns over at him.
Castiel can’t help but smile. He lifts his palm to press against Dean’s chest. His heart thumps beneath Castiel’s palm.
He loses himself to the fantasy until John hits another pothole and everything comes flooding back with a jolt of pain, and he feels so profoundly ashamed, so guilty for letting himself daydream
He’s been pushing this part of it down, trying to avoid thinking about the fact that Cas was so certain Dean could never love him that he relied on it as the only thing to keep him safe from oblivion. But now the knowledge is unavoidable. Cas never knew. He really never knew.
It doesn’t matter that Benny’s got a girlfriend, or that he’s never shown any interest in guys, or that he’s going to be too busy doing his job up in one of the multiplex projection booths to actually sit down with them in the theater.
You don't need to worry. We’re going to handle it before it becomes a problem.
Standing in the doorway, Dean’s gaze sweeps from table to table before it finally settles on Castiel, and a smile flickers over his face, but it’s weak at best. He’s visibly distraught. It would be obvious even if Castiel
He paces around the apartment, wearing down the carpet in his bedroom, before he stops and looks down. Dean still has the same carpet, he remembers. In sixty years, it has never been pulled up.
“No. Look. I’m not gonna lie—it probably
covers it,” he admits, fingers tugging lightly at Dean’s hair. “Do you— should I wait as well?”
“Okay.”
When Dean makes a low, satisfied sound around him--
Raising his fingers, Castiel follows the line of sweat with his fingertip, back up to the bolt of his jaw.
of something exploding several miles away. A car, maybe.
“Yeah, we’ll hit the road today. Should get there by… uh. Noon tomorrow I think?"
But though Castiel aches to kiss him, he holds back. Just lets their noses graze against one another, foreheads touching as he thumbs at the edge of Dean’s mouth and glides his other hand over his ribs.
“Castiel.”
Dean squeezes his thigh again.
A knot forms in Castiel’s throat as he contemplates a reply. He feels like his hands are tied. In the end, he ignores the message and grabs a bag of tortilla chips and a bottle of water from the fridge by the counter.
The school is quiet when they arrive a few minutes later, nothing but the sounds of a few restless sleepers and one older woman with an intermittent rattling snore to break the silence. A young deputy that Dean vaguely recognizes from earlier in the day is sitting on a folding chair by the door. When she sees them she stands and gestures for them to follow her into the corridor.
“But you did it,” he says, encouraging. “You can do it again. We can trap them.”
, all because the surgery that was supposed to make everything better had resulted in hallucinations far worse than anyone could have anticipated. They'd known that it was possible, but the chances were slim, and at the time, it had seemed like a risk worth taking.
from Dean’s lips is incongruous and confusing until Castiel feels a wet thumb dragging down the cleft of his ass.
He asks himself, and breathes in deeply as he looks around.
Instead, he walks slightly ahead and elbows the button at the crosswalk, looking back at Dean as he does.
“I don’t have any other kind of monkey suit.”
“No, a human could do that with the correct intent,” he says, then amends; “Though the sigils
“Here,” Sam says, holding the water out toward him. “It’ll help—”
As much as he hates to admit it, she’s right. Dean can already see Sam’s phone in his hand, running a search on one of the occult sites they use, but he’s not ready to throw in the
He pulls his first glove off with his teeth, then the other, and jams them into the breast pocket of his flight jacket before using his pocketknife to cut himself free of the parachute lines wrapped around his torso. Once he’s free he climbs carefully down to the ground. His crew would laugh at him, he thinks, for how careful he’s being.
“The more things change…” Dean snickers, shaking his head.
“Single?”
“Okay, well we know first-hand that Azazel and Ramiel are dead. That narrows the search down, at least.”
The static on the interphone is broken by another burst of gunfire.
He’s so tempted to knock on the door, to wake Castiel and figure out a way to make this work, but it would be reckless on an enormous scale. Even being here now is reckless. Coming back at all was a mistake.
“I thought I was sparing you.”
Jack sinks back into his chair and resumes reading, and Castiel watches him for a moment before he steels himself and heads downstairs. Dean is waiting for him by the map table. He looks comfortable with his socked feet peeking out from under his loose jeans, and he pulls Castiel into a hug as soon as they’re on the same level.
“Wanna sit?”
Dean seems to have to forcibly drag his gaze back up to Castiel’s face to answer. It takes a lot more effort than Castiel would like to keep from preening under the attention.
“Perhaps the bathroom isn’t the best place to leap through time,” Castiel cuts in to suggest.
“It’s stupid, but... dammit he’s… I know it was only a couple of weeks, but I-- he was it for me, Charlie.”
Dean smiles. Castiel could cry at seeing it.
The words might as well be a bucket of ice water. Dean snaps his head around to look at Castiel like he thinks he’s about to walk out and not come back.
“No, I—” Dean huffs and holds up a hand. “Just. Give me a minute, okay?”
Dean makes a sound of reluctant agreement.
Cas trails off, frowning, and shakes his head.
As she approaches him, his grip on his blade instinctively tightens, and the other djinn subtly shift, their bodies tense and defensive. Castiel forces his hand to relax, painfully aware of her tracking the miniscule movement.

“I have
Still, Dean feels the burden of responsibility weighing on his conscience. He looks up at the picture again. If he can figure out where the man was living after the war, maybe he can come back again and help Castiel find him.
There’s a reason he’s never broached the topic with Dean before, after all, and it’s not because he’s ever doubted that their love was mutual. Dean is complicated. Castiel knows this, and he’s ready to deal with the potential fallout.
She nods.
The flush that spreads over Dean’s cheeks and chest is beautiful, even if it is an absurd reaction considering what they spent the night doing together. Castiel just smiles at him.
Dean shakes his head, leaning against the counter as Castiel approaches.
A not insubstantial part of him wants to pick at it. He thinks it’s a sign of personal progress that he refrains.
Castiel just lifts his brow and slots one foot between Dean’s, pulling him close to kiss the look away. Only when he feels Dean begin to melt against him does he stop, and Dean’s painted-on frown is back within seconds, even less convincing than before.
“Driving all night will do that, I expect.”
“You didn’t want to see me.”
at him, and Castiel’s rush to adequately cover himself results in an entirely ungraceful trip backwards into the tub. The shower curtain pulls free of the railing, rings hitting the tile with a series of pings, and Castiel’s head knocks against the wall with a painful thud. He groans.
“I’d like that.”
To be completely blunt about it, Castiel has turned into an all out horndog in this fic entirely against my will and I have no fucking control over him.
--the sensation paired with the joy of knowing Dean is content is enough to send him tumbling over the edge.
Sam frowns.
“I went back,” Dean says with a shrug.
They were wrong, in the end. A one in a million chance is still a chance, and all it takes is a stroke of bad luck to ruin absolutely everything.
Castiel’s skin prickles cold, and he feels something lodged in his throat.
Castiel chews on the inside of his lip.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, and Castiel drops the paper bag of groceries on the floor, finally recovering enough to walk. Dean meets him in the middle, pulling him close, and for a while they just hold one another. Quiet and warm.
“Asshole,” Dean mutters without heat.
He waves to a nearby waitress as Dean approaches the door.
“You liked that movie.”
is an afternoon in Bobby’s garage with Cas, working together to clear the blocked EGR valve on Cas’ truck while the staticky radio echoed and buzzed from its place on the grease-stained workbench.
He’s going to fix this, but not tonight.
One end of the thread has been left untied. In the back of Dean’s mind, he can almost hear Grandpa Henry huffing at the sight of it. He hated loose threads. Dean can relate.
“I don’t
not entirely true, either.”
Castiel nods again.
Sighing, Castiel twists to put the laptop in its bag on the back seat and eyes the books he put there before they left the bunker. He pulls one from the stack at random—an ancient black volume titled
They know something is wrong the moment they turn the corner onto Dean’s street. Gertrude Stein is out on her front porch in her nightgown, clutching at her throat with one hand while the other holds a mint-green phone receiver to her ear, the long cord trailing back into the hallway through her half-open screen door. Several houses down, there’s smoke pouring from Dean’s living room window.
“Tiring,” Castiel tells him, thinking of his long drive, of talking to Sam, of the djinn--no, there was no djinn--just a chupacabra that he’d tracked down in the middle of Nevada, far too far north for anyone else to have realized what they were dealing with.
be a hell of a lot easier if neither of us wanted anything more here. But easier doesn’t mean better, Cas. If I wanted easy, I would’ve kept my mouth shut last night. I’m tired of easy.”
Dean loved being a part of that, even if his role was a small one.
“Yes.”
The Red Robin truckstop is busier at this time of day.
“Alright. Well, I’m emailing you everything I could get my hands on. The doctor’s address, a couple of police reports, some CCTV footage. It’s not a lot, but—”
“Not really.”
The damage is too much to fight against, and the plane tilts dangerously despite his and Daniel’s best efforts. Another strike to the underside cuts off the gunfire that Devereux had been responsible for, and the impact sends Shurley and Johnson tumbling from the plane before anyone can react.
When he digs it out, a message from Sam lights up the screen.
“Good to know,” Dean winks and takes another bite, and Castiel has the distinct impression that he’s just made another double entendre without intending to.
“Well, let’s start with the time you told me that you weren’t going to let me die a virgin, and go from there,” Castiel says, his mouth lifting into a one-sided smirk.
Everywhere his frantic gaze falls is another awful memory.
“I did,” Dean points out, then sighs. Pulling out his cell phone, he drops it on the table between them. “But you’re determined, so take a look. I took some pictures.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Because of finals?”
Castiel just hopes that it’s not something they can’t fix.
They’re not really dancing anymore; just rocking together, rhythmic and slow as heat builds between them. Castiel is breathless and aching, his whole body begging for him to get closer, feel more. He parts his lips in a sigh, and Dean’s tongue teases him to gasping.
Turning, Cas heads for the stairs, and Dean finds his voice again.
“Better for real, or better as in
“You sure?” Bobby asks.
Castiel is afraid to respond at all. He wishes he wasn’t, but fear compounded by habit is hard to shake.
•	A ghost
Dean makes an impressed sound.
The third snatches the scimitar dropped by the second. A fourth and fifth swipe at his legs, trying to knock him down as a sixth grabs for his blade.
Frowning, he turns around and walks back out onto the landing.
Dean’s laugh is carefree and delighted, and Castiel beams when he realizes that the nerves he’d been impeded by are gone.
“Are you alright?” she asks.
“Henry always hated loose threads,” Dean explains. “I couldn’t leave it half-finished.”
Castiel does, and Dean follows, kneeling in front of him the same as he did back at the bunker. His fingers are slow and careful as he unbuttons Castiel’s shirt, and Castiel waits, dreading the moment when Dean sees the still-healing wound and decides that Castiel is still too fragile to touch, nerves or not. But when he pulls the bandage away, a shiny pink line of new skin is the only sign that he was ever hurt. Dean traces over it with his thumb.
Someone in Wyoming bought apples and toothpaste and a bottle of Jack on July 12th. Someone in Indiana bought a dozen boxes of Cinnamon Toast Crunch with a half-off coupon on July 26th. Someone in Virginia bought a pack of Lucky Strikes, a bag of beef jerky, and a sixer of El Sol on August 2nd.
It doesn’t take long.
“No! No, I just… it’s been a long time since I discussed these things with anyone. Not since… not since Daniel. He was my co-pilot on my first B-17.”
With a groan, he leans forward and rests his head on the table.
It also doesn’t matter that it’s mostly just instinct and wishful thinking that tells Castiel that Dean
He’s remembering the way the sweet frosting had made the roof of his mouth feel oddly ticklish when he suddenly senses Dean’s presence, and looks outside just in time to see the Impala pulling into a space near his own truck. Castiel watches through the window as Dean climbs out of the car, taking in the way he checks his hair and adjusts his green jacket in the reflection on the window.
is one of a hundred and eight Boeing B-17’s flying into Warsaw, protected by a handful of Mustang fighters as they deliver supplies to the city. It’s a risky mission--they’re flying over occupied territory in broad daylight, for one thing--but the situation in the Polish capital is dire, and the knowledge that things will only get worse without their help makes it a little easier to push through the ever-present fear and get the job done.
“Yeah. Yes. Okay.”
“Alright,” Dean raises both hands as if surrendering. “But I can’t help but wonder if there’s a reason why you seem so nervous.” He pauses, then points toward the case on the desk—a gun case, Castiel realizes. “And if it’s got anything to do with why you’ve taken that out of your safe.”
“Come here,” he says, and Dean goes without protest.
He trails off, and Dean leans a little closer, trying to catch his eye.
“Really, Dean. I’m fine.”
“It was beautiful there. I hated how beautiful it was. The things that were happening, that I had to take part in… the lives lost. There was so much horror, but the forest was breathtaking.”
“I’ll cook,” he says.
He breathes in the steam as he undresses, and feels the aches of his long drive being soothed a little more with each passing second.
The first to reach him is dead before her long-nailed fingers can fully grip his arm, eyes flaring blue as Castiel’s blade slides fluidly between her ribs.
“And this union will ensure that no harm will be—”
“This way,” John says, and signals the direction with the butt of his shotgun before grabbing what few belongings they have from the back. Dean hears things rattling in a duffel bag. Metallic things. Knives and guns and bullets. That’s all John brought. Weapons.
The last time he felt anything like this was shortly after he’d started training to become an airline pilot. Balthazar had been another student, and they’d been good friends right up until Castiel pushed him away. He’d been protecting himself from heartbreak, so certain that he was falling for the unavailable man that he felt it necessary to cease spending time with him.
“I’ll tell you what,” Castiel says, pulling the coat closer and working the pin free. “I’ll make you a gift of it.”
A draft shudders through the attic as he ties off the thread, setting the hairs on the back of his neck on end, and Dean slips the pin cushion from his wrist so he can try the jacket on.
, but it’s never been on the cards. His hands are scarred and clumsy, and whenever he’s tried he’s only made things worse.)
“I’ll see you around.”
Sam chews on his lip and flicks on the indicator, easing them off the interstate and into an empty weighstation. In the silence that follows, he turns in his seat to look Castiel in the eye.
There’s a heavy pause, as though Cas is weighing up whether or not to say something more, and Dean is so used to this kind of moment leading nowhere that he’s shocked when Cas speaks.
“I see.”
, he thinks.
“Well, I don't think there's anything left to say.”
“Can’t argue with that,” Dean murmurs when he pulls away, and glances up as a few stray raindrops begin to fall. He sighs. “Probably our cue. We should go back in before Sam gets up, anyway.”
“Even better,” Dean laughs again, and shakes his head. “Nearly a year. Jesus. I would’ve come sooner if I knew it was that long.”
Cas likes him at all.
“Just, um. Didn’t get much sleep last night,” he says, visibly forcing himself to sit a little more casually. “And uh, Parker’s fine.”
“I’m reasonably certain, yes,” he replies, and smiles. “Do we need to do anything before we head out?”
“You look different,” he says, and his frown deepens until he places the change. “You have a beard.”
It’s a nice thought, or it would be under different circumstances.
Dean shrugs.
Even with his better mood, it’s still jarring to be confronted with sixty odd years of progress as soon as he steps out the door. The car with the loud music is still parked around the corner, and Castiel is glad he’s heading in the opposite direction.
They’re quiet as they work. With everything slightly damp from the rain, it takes some effort to get the fire going, but soon enough the flames are licking high. While Dean prepares the fish, Castiel wraps potatoes in aluminum foil and tosses them into the fire. When they’re done, Castiel digs them out with a stick. They pull them apart with their fingers.
Honestly, he hasn’t felt safe enough to do this with another person since before he went to Hell.
Castiel can feel every inch that separates them. The air hums with music. Dean’s fingertips find Castiel’s in the dark, sliding over his knuckles. His thumb traces Castiel’s, and Castiel sucks in a breath.
“I guess.”
It takes more effort than he thinks it should, but once he does manage to reach a state of relative tranquility, it’s easy to let himself believe that things will work out for them. That every one of their problems—Sam’s hurtful and unexpected disapproval, their tenuous alliance with the British Men of Letters, Kelly Kline’s whereabouts and the Nephilim she carries—has an easy solution, and that he’ll be able to find the answers somehow in his meditative state. That everything will seem simple and unthreatening by the time the sun rises.
Mildly chagrined, Dean purses his lips and gives a half-shrug.
“I hope you realise that that will have to go both ways,” Castiel says, and Dean huffs.
“How’d the date go?”
“About six. Did you sleep well?”
“Dude, you’re my goddamn brother, of course that grosses me out.”
Castiel touches Dean’s elbow, gesturing for the notepad he’s holding when Dean looks back at him. Taking it, he writes as he speaks.
Dean grunts, and it’s obvious that he’s still unsure, even though he’s got no argument for Castiel’s logic.
being… kissing a dude.”
He can feel Cas’ heartbeat against his cheek. It’s slow and steady. Peaceful. Dean thinks it’ll help him sleep, if Cas will lie here with him.
that they were.
interested in guys, because that same instinct tells him that if any guy is going to capture Dean’s attention, it’s going to be Benny Lafitte. Nineteen years old, far too muscular for his own good, and the proud owner of a truck that Dean’s been drooling over for the past six months, Benny is the kind of twinkly-eyed, good-natured sweetheart that any decent person would happily push their friend toward.
“A serendipitous first piece, then,” Castiel replies.
as if to demonstrate the physical. “They do not work in this way.”
“Yes?”
He slips his keys from his pocket. They jingle loud in the late night quiet.
Dean chews on his lip, glancing away.
“Oh, Dean—thank you. Yes, you can touch me.”
“Henry Winchester.”
Dean falters.
“Are you alright?” Castiel asks before Dean can say anything, and though he steps a little closer he stops short of where he’d like to be. There’s space between them that he’s not certain he should cross until after they’ve spoken. Dean’s brows knit together.
Castiel sighs and shakes his head, separating out the four he thinks will be most relevant.
“I thought you met him in 1945.”
“Just that he wants you to call him.”
Dean stares at the rearview mirror until the sign disappears.
At some point, Castiel knows he’s going to have to make Dean think about why it is that he’s decided other people deserve happiness more than he does. Why he’ll casually offer to Castiel—or Sam, or Mary, or literally anyone who crosses his path—what he’d never accept for himself.
_____
, and Dean can’t help but feel that it’s worse than if he’d just died in the first place. His dad is gone either way. At least if he’d died before, Mary would still be alive. Sam would be safe. Dean would be home.
Thankfully, Charlie doesn’t comment on the state of the living room--just waits patiently while Dean grabs his comforter and a discarded hoodie from the couch and tosses it onto his weeks-untouched bed before she takes her usual seat.
“Probably made a demon deal to make his hair function as a satellite.”
“What?”
He wants to ask the man’s name, to ask if he’s really Castiel, but he’s scared of the answer. Instead he just shrugs a little and gives an awkward wave.
Until then, he considers trying to talk some sense into John. He approaches it a dozen different ways in his head. Gently. Harshly. By playing along until he can make John realize for himself that none of this makes sense. But every version ends the same. He can’t imagine a scenario that doesn’t result in John thinking that Dean is one of them, too.
. Cas had followed his lead, and never attempted anything even approaching a conversation.
Castiel narrows his eyes, and Dean raises his hands.
. It was the surgery that shook something loose. Snagged some wires and crossed them.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel tells him. “You kept telling me we’d find a way to send me back. I thought it was what you wanted.”
“Nothing?”
“No,” he breathes.
before it promptly slipped his mind.
“I know.”
“How the hell did you keep this a secret?” Dean asks once they reach his room. “You’re usually the most obvious liar in the world.”
They’ve been silent now for long enough that Castiel has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about, and he turns his head to look at him, sitting cross-legged on the grass nearby.
Castiel is struck by the sudden and intense desire to bite his earlobe.
The best thing you can do at present is let us know if you hear anything that seems as though it could be related.
As though he’s somehow aware that Castiel is watching him, Dean glances up to meet his gaze for the briefest second before his eyes dart away again. It’s not subtle, the way he forces himself to focus on shifting the rest of the weapons, and finally Castiel’s train of thought arrives at the next stop: what now?
So is the fact that he’s been standing here for almost twenty minutes. It might be childish, but Castiel has been letting him stew. He’d only been back in his room for an hour when he’d heard Sam’s door creak open, and since then, he’s been laying back and playing out dozens of variations of the argument they’d had in the car. Half of the fantasies had led to him saying something so profoundly convincing that Sam changed his mind and apologised for his initial reaction. The other half involved him telling Sam, in increasingly colourful ways, to go fuck himself.
“I suppose I could just ‘peacock’ again, as you put it,” he adds, shooting Dean a narrow-eyed look for the phrasing. “Or there are a variety of minor miracles I could perform… but really, it will depend on how receptive he is to the existence of angels in the first place.”
“Mm.” Castiel shifts, his knees emerging from the water like two tan islands as he leans his head against the tiled wall and studies Dean. There’s something he’s missing. Something that needs to know. Something that he needs to remember. “Will you tell me something?”
“It’s always— it was just me and him, for so long. I
For a moment, Castiel allows himself to just stand and watch. To lean against the door and fully absorb the knowledge that Dean is finally letting himself want Castiel this way.
“Not anymore,” he says, and smooths his thumb over Dean’s jaw. “But I’ll rest with you.”
Maybe they've all been defying him, in small ways, for years. Maybe they’ve been making it up as they go.
Charlie kicks him in the shin before she leaves.
“I’d better not find out that you two are misbehaving out there,” she says as Castiel starts the engine, and Dean just grins at her.
“Just—c’mon,” he says, and pulls.
“I’m alright,” Castiel says, closing his eyes in the vain hope that if he can’t see Dean standing there, the memory of this moment won’t stick. “Please just-- just wait outside.”
When he arrives, he can’t see Dean when he looks in through the shop window, so he heads upstairs to find a new note where the other had been.
He doesn’t give Dean a chance to say anything else—just wraps his lips around him again and sucks, drags his tongue over the head and works his hand smoothly over the rest until Dean’s legs are shaking, until his hips are lifting, rocking in deep, rapid, desperate thrusts, until he finally seizes up and cries out, his release flooding down Castiel’s throat.
“I can get you the
The sound of slow footsteps crunching over dry grass pulls him from his doze a couple of hours later, and his adrenaline spikes, pushing him to his feet with his blade in his hand before he’s even fully opened his eyes. Blinking blearily, he stares down at the football field below.
It’s almost funny, how certain Sam is. If it weren’t such a clear violation of Dean’s trust, Castiel would tell him about the years of longing, the constant pull he feels from Dean’s soul, reaching for his grace. It’s been there since the averted apocalypse, though it’s only since he was human that Castiel has understood what it meant. Though it’s been unspoken, Castiel knows that what he feels is reciprocated. Has been for a long time.
As he watches, Dean stretches his neck, his gaze turned away from Castiel toward a stretch of pine on the gentle slope beyond the water. Dappled sunlight filters through the leaves above him, making him look like one of Mary’s paintings. Castiel finds himself wishing he’d asked to borrow her camera.
Castiel keeps his eyes closed as Dean slips the jacket on, and when he feels Dean still, he shuffles a little closer.
“For good?”
“Oh?”
The tear on the front is sewn up flawlessly, but on the breast around his name, three-quarters of a circle has been stitched in red. A short length of thread hangs from the end. He touches it with his thumb.
“Perhaps you could help me,” Castiel says. “I’m concerned there may be a gas leak in my apartment.”
Castiel hums in agreement.
“No, she just thinks she’s funny.”
“Y’know,” Dean says, interrupting his thoughts with his voice pitched low, and Castiel glances back up to see that his pupils are blown wide. Apprehensive. Tense.
, a little voice says in the back of Dean’s mind, and he heaves a breath, barely registering the wet sound of it because as soon as he’s got air in his lungs he starts crying again.
No sooner than the words have left his mouth there’s the high-pitched whine of an approaching rocket, and Gabriel’s voice comes through the interphone with something that sounds a lot like
did you know?”
Red might be the color of blood and fire, but both mean life as much as anything else. Red is flushed cheeks. Flowers in window-boxes. Wine and song and sunsets. Red is everything that war is not.
“Go get the marshmallows while I finish packing,” Dean tells him, and pulls him to his feet.
“Nineteen forty five.”
“So it’s not beyond help.” He looks at her; takes in the sagacious glint in her eyes. “But you already know that.”
Leaves in the stairwell, rust flaking from the guardrail. On the door, there’s a faint square of sticky residue, and inside it, the metal is a little less weathered than the rest. The sight stops Castiel in his tracks.
That question is like cold water, and Dean tries to shake it off.
“What about him?”
“Half an hour, give or take,” the navigator replies, his voice tinny and distant despite him sitting barely twelve feet away.
“What took you so long?”
“And that would be easier if you didn’t have to worry about me overhearing or Sam dragging me into the conversation,” Castiel says. Dean nods, shame all over his features. “It’s alright. I can give you some space.”
Sorry, yes. Is everything okay?
“Yes.”
Five fucking minutes to just—
With a sigh, Dean stops whisking.
“That’s a very good part,” he tells him, and glances downstairs to see Dean walking into the map room. He looks up at Castiel and Jack with a soft smile that has Castiel’s knees feeling a bit weak. So much for avoiding him. “I’ll let you get back to it.”
“Yeah?” Dean smiles even bigger than before. It’s crooked and beautiful, and the sight takes his breath away despite the frequency with which he’s imagined it. “You been okay?”
of Angel Eyes slamming into the earth below.
“Hey,” he says.
“It’s gonna sound stupid, but I’m pretty sure it has something to do with the jacket,” Dean says, gesturing toward his own chest. “I mean… I put it on, I turn up back here. Take it off, and I’m back in 2008.”
“And Daniel Fisher definitely died in action?”
He’s not in the library or the kitchen or in any of the other places Castiel looks, either, and as he peers into the seventh empty room he finds himself missing his grace more keenly than he has in his entire year as a human. As an angel, he’d have been able to listen for Dean’s breath or sense the warmth of his soul from several rooms away.
Castiel grunts a low sound of irritation and hits the refresh button.
-- “You stink like you’ve been on the road for a week.”
If something should ever happen to prevent him from being able to continue doing so… Well, Castiel doesn’t much want to think about that possibility. He’s already had one minor panic to contend with in the past few minutes.
“I hope the rest of the team isn’t too put out.”
The way Sam says
,” Dean sighs, and Cas draws his hips back before rocking slowly forward. The pace he sets is so measured that Dean could weep. He feels every inch; the stretch, the slide, the heat of him.
Dean takes it with an appreciative hum, his thumb brushing against Castiel’s hand in the process.
“I doubt it’ll be my last,” Castiel admits. “But this one has served it’s purpose.”
Pushing to his feet, Dean takes a few steps away before turning back to look at Castiel, his hands tense at his sides, clenching into fists and releasing, over and over as though he needs the movement to keep from… something. Castiel isn’t sure what. But his eyes are pleading. Begging Castiel to meet him halfway.
to what Dean likes. He crinkles his nose at the taste. It’s not perfect, but he thinks it’s as close as he’ll be able to get it.
“Gone,” he says. One syllable is all he can get out, and he can’t even bring himself to lift his head when he says it. He can’t look at Jack. He already knows that seeing his wide-blue eyes and creased brow is going to hurt more than he can handle right now.
“Yeah, we might do in the morning. Folks were already getting restless before sundown,” Deputy Kim says with a glance back into the cafeteria before she looks back at Dean and drops her voice a little lower. “I don’t suppose you’ve seen the Sheriff? He hasn’t been answering his phone.”
“Yeah, if you want.”
It feels
“Your brother is not the only power-hungry creature willing to destroy something simply so that no-one else can have it.”
He looks up at them, his eyes watering with the memory.
, but they’re getting close to the drop zone now and somehow haven’t been fired upon once. It’s only serving to make things more tense.
“I’ll want to.”
The air is icy as they head toward the entrance, and a brisk gust of wind lifts the last remaining leaves from the trees on the edge of the parking lot. As he crunches his boots over a few that lay on the pavement, he catches Sam’s eye and smiles.
Now, as he closes the door behind him and takes in the waterstained carpet and peeling wallpaper, he wonders if perhaps his decision was a little hasty.
The splinter falls silently to the dirt at their feet. Castiel curls the tip of his index finger against the tiny puncture in Dean’s skin, directing his grace as it knits back together.
“I can come get you,” Castiel offers, and Ellen pulls back to look at him, her expression as no-nonsense as it’s ever been. With red-rimmed eyes, it falls slightly short of the usual authority.
