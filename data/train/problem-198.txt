are perfect adjectives to describe Mycroft, wouldn’t you say? And it's hardly worse than suspicions of incest.”
Instead, John says nothing, which reveals a greater depth of understanding than that of any bleeding-heart activist. Despite any complaints, Mycroft’s allowed Sherlock an astonishing amount of freedom, and they’re both well aware of the fact.
, Sherlock. If you want to do this, we'll do it. But we're doing it right. You can’t keep going on the way you’ve always done and not expect it to have a seriously detrimental effect on the baby’s development.” John purses his lips and set his jaw mulishly, as if readying for a fight. “We need to establish some ground rules.”

,” Sherlock rolls his eyes unrepentantly. “No self-respecting Alpha spends that much time with another’s Omega, family or not; unless they’re having an affair. Or if they’re helping provide cover for one.” Eddie’s face freezes in a rictus of shock, a deep red flush making it’s way slowly up his neck and into his cheeks. Sherlock wrinkles his nose, and curls his lip dramatically as he continues, his words taking a deliberate turn for the crude. No better way to goad an Alpha into betraying themselves than by insulting their Omega.
about it. What he does or thinks in private has no bearing on their friendship- so long as Sherlock never,
Sherlock drops his head back against the pillow and groans brokenly, nodding. He’s vaguely aware that, had he currently greater command over his faculties, he’d be absolutely
“I... I had hoped to keep things from Mycroft for a short while yet. At least until the second trimester.”
“Mmm?” He mumbles, before starting awake fully as his brain catches up and he remembers just where he is. He catches sight of the nurse unpacking a shaving kit on the bedside table and frowns. “What’s going on?”
“You know how they never leave notes? This one did.” The man sighs heavily, despite having made the effort to seek Sherlock out. “Will you come?”
John hardly needs the prompting, drawing his fingertips out momentarily to grip Sherlock’s hips and adjust him slightly higher on his lap, aligning the omega’s small, straining erection with his own. Sherlock whimpers, grinding his little cock against John’s as the alpha coats his fingers liberally with Sherlock’s own wetness before pushing back up inside the tight little passage. He drives his fingers in far deeper this time, pressing in slowly until he’s buried knuckle-deep, careful not to cause any pain.
“Here we are are, luv.” The cabbie pipes up suddenly, startling him out of his thoughts. She turns to smile at him patronizingly over her shoulder. “Best get inside to your Alpha straight away, pet. They’ll give you a proper seeing to.”
“Are you alright? You’re looking a bit peaky.” John questions as he perches gently on the side of the bed. He reaches to rest his hand against Sherlock’s brow, brushing aside sweat-damp curls to do so. “You feel feverish.”
difficulty of spending three days stuffing your knot in me, then brewing tea and making toast. Growing a human being inside oneself and every indignity that it entails is nothing compared to
“Oh,” Sherlock marvels as the nurse lifts the squalling infant over the surgical divider and onto his chest. Midnight blue eyes peer up at him from a wizened little scrunch of a face, unfocused and slightly cross-eyed, and instantly steal his breath away. His hands rise up instinctively to clasp the tiny body close to his own, and he chokes slightly on the sudden tears that spring up in his eyes and tighten his throat. “Hello.”
“Please John.” Sherlock repeats himself quietly, leaning close to press soft, featherlight kisses against the curve of John’s resistant mouth. Hearing his Christian name from Sherlock’s lips stills something in him that’s never before quieted. With a final wary glance at the door, he tightens he buries a hand in those gleaming chestnut curls and pulls.
“And your diet is certainly in need of improvement. You can’t just carry on subsisting on little more than tea and cigarettes. You have to start eating regular meals, taking prenatal vitamins. And no more nicotine patches!”
Sherlock turns the small, sleek brick over in his hand, gazing down upon it with a thoughtful expression. “You’re brother’s a drinker, recently separated from his wife. You’re not close, but your trip earlier this month was to help settle him into a rehabilitation facility, and he wants to begin to mend your relationship."
“Oh,” understanding blooms in John's voice. “Because of the…” He drops his gaze to Sherlock’s midsection.
to rework them before posting. But here we go- back on track! And the rating may have slipped upward a tad. Whoops!
As he wanders through the establishment, he tries his best to appear entirely blasé about it all, but for pity’s sake; there’s a literal
“Yes.” Sherlock confirms, smoothing a protective hand over his belly under the pretense of straightening his shirt. “Twelve weeks along, approximately. You’re as aware as I am of the window of conception.”
Time to strap in dear readers; this slow burn is about to get doused in gasoline. I think we’ve all suffered more than enough now. There’s going to be a whole lot of sexy times and fluff from here on out. If that is, in fact, not your jam, please proceed to the emergency exits now.
They incline their head in silent assent one last time. And with that he pivots sharply and retreats. When he hazards a final glance back over his shoulder, those shadowed eyes remain unwavering, intently watching him go.
you nitwit,” Sherlock chimes in acerbically. “Which you can obviously tell given the context of the situation and our physical contact with one another. No unbonded Alpha in their right mind would dare touch a labouring Omega in such a manner if they were just
They've left it far longer than they should have— here isn't much time left now for what they need to do. He gathers himself together as much as possible, releasing his cock to push himself up from the mattress.
“So it’s the brother that you’re hiding things from, is it?” She asks matter-of-factly as she slips on a pair of gloves. “The creepy, omniscient one?”
perhaps somewhat questionable for him to experiment on John without his consent. But, in his own defense, he’d ensured that John was perfectly safe the entire time. And in any case, he hadn't
“The Government has a triple lockdown on euthanasia cases. You need to have a sign-off from the doctor, the patient, and the family. It's to stop people passing over just because they
He goes through the motions of lackadaisically trading barbs with Mycroft, feigning disinterest as he all the while keeps an eye trained for even the slightest tell. It takes longer than he would have guessed. Only after Mycroft primly seats himself in John’s chair, accepting the tea that John graciously offers with the usual condescending simper, does he freeze distractedly, cup left hovering in midair.
“Mmm,” John murmurs against the pale arch of muscle, as his fingers come up to work open the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt. He slips off the arm of the chair to kneel on the floor, rearranging Sherlock’s sprawled limbs for better access to his body. “You're really determined to put your brother's goodwill to the test aren't you?”
, but it's just so… amazing.” He shuffles down the bed a ways and wraps one arm about Sherlock’s hip, leaning in to hover his mouth just above the bump. “Hello Baby,” he whispers cheerfully.
“We’ll also need access to Marie’s NHS records to confirm her pregnancy. Between that and the evidence of the affair that we’ll undoubtedly uncover, it should be a simple matter to request and conduct a prenatal paternity test. John can help you write up the medical bits,” He looks to John expectantly for confirmation, and John nods agreeably, pleased as always to be useful.

people too you know; not playthings. They’re just like you or I or any Beta.” He responds tiredly, exhausted by her constant attempts to provoke him. She hums disinterestedly, as though she’ll have to take his word for it; classic Alpha arrogance. He supposes, to her, everyone’s either a plaything, a stepping stone, or a tool to make use of.
some ideas about my protection once they’re granted. I’d say it wouldn’t blow much of a hole in the wealth of the nation… but then I’d be lying.”
“We can certainly think of it as such.” Sherlock smiles in return, though it doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
Only the briefest of delays this time! And the case that grew a mind of it's own finally comes to a close!
“We’re not a couple,” John counters defensively and Sherlock tries to ignore the painful throb in his chest at the words.
“What case? Pay her, now and in full. As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead: ‘know when you are beaten’.” As he moves to reach for his coat dismissively, Mycroft pipes up.
“Oh no,” Sherlock offers a fiendish grin as he snatches one of his newly arrived forensic journals from John’s side table, then settles into his armchair. Dealing with a bit of a sticky mess later is well worth the delight of making Mycroft hideously uncomfortable now. “I’m
Clearly the doctor, John, and now even Lestrade think nothing of it; but deep down, he can't deny the niggling sense of failure over the issue. He's such a miserable excuse for an Omega that he may be unable to bring his son into the world the proper way.
Another one bites the dust! It was such a treat to flip back to John's perspective for a bit, and I hope you all enjoyed it! I will still need a good week or so to get the first chapter of the next installment ready to go, but rest assured I'll be working on it as much as I possibly can. Are you guys ready for these two fools to admit their feelings? Because I sure am!
“It didn’t seem especially relevant,” Sherlock answers with a perfunctory shrug. “Most Omegas of an age know one another in our social strata. In passing, at the very least. We generally aren’t permitted to move about in a wide variety of social circles.”
“Nothing's the matter,” Sherlock replies peevishly, his resolve slowly crumbling away beneath the warmth of John's palm against his skin and the gentle stroke of a thumb over the delicate skin of his hipbone. Such a small touch shouldn't be so unbearably arousing.
“Why? Are you feeling exposed?” Irene taunts flirtatiously, and Sherlock can’t help but notice the way that John’s eyes struggle to remain trained above her shoulders. With that, he decides he’s had quite enough indeed.
him. He bites his lip and moans at the realization. Why on earth is that so incredibly arousing? John rolls his hips steadily all the while, neither slowing or speeding up. At the end of each stroke he deliberately presses the hot swell of his knot tightly against Sherlock, pulling back just before it slips inside. Sherlock sucks in a shaky breath and sobs.
Being poked and prodded at by the prim Beta doctor who'd muttered under her breath as she took an increasing number of measurements, and had addressed John almost exclusively, as if Sherlock were little more than a houseplant. When she
“He’s dead.” John announces with a slight pant as he finishes checking over the Beta behind him, climbing to his feet shakily.
“Ah shit. I forgot… Yeah, sorry Sherlock, but —” he exchanges a tense look with John “— you're going to have to sit this one out.”
“Yeah, all right, Spock,” John holds his palms up in a pacifying gesture, “just...take it easy. You’ve been… pretty
from. The doctor wants to do some more tests farther along since we still have a ways to go, but she said with his size we may need to consider a c-section. Otherwise though, everything looks good.”
He calls out to John to switch off the alarm, but it keeps beeping insistently from behind the closed door. He tries again, louder this time, and then finally catches John’s faint reply over the cacophony.
Thankfully, John had been too caught up in the moment to realize the temporarily embarrassing tightness of Sherlock’s trousers.
It doesn’t help the situation in the slightest that the entire meal, his mind stays hopelessly fixated on Sherlock, rather than the beautiful woman sitting across from him. He hasn’t the foggiest what it was that put such a bee in Sherlock’s bonnet this time, but that glimpse of bitterness he’d caught in Sherlock’s eyes leaves him shaken.
As Sherlock Holmes stands outside New Scotland Yard, sweating beneath his Belstaff while he irritatedly smokes a cigarette, he allows himself the private admission that he may have, in fact, made a terrible mistake.
“And here you are, the dominatrix who brought a nation to its knees.” There’s a bittersweet note of admiration alongside the resignation in Mycroft’s voice, as he rises from his chair. “Nicely played.”
. He’s been enjoying it, really, if he allows himself to be completely honest. Well, the intermittent cramping in his abdomen that began approximately fifteen hours ago, he could do without. Likewise the incessant, low-level hum of arousal that's come to suffuse his every waking moment. But both are mild enough so as not to outweigh the more pleasant effects. It’s nothing he can’t ignore, really. Nothing at all like the constant,
“Oh yes,” Stamford confirms as he opens the door and holds it open for John to limp through. “Smart as a whip— it’s a shame he’s an omega, really. Dreadful waste of a fine mind.”
The conniption that immediately follows on John’s part is precisely as expected, and only serves to make Sherlock feel entirely justified in the petty manner in which he notifies John that, her interest in John lies primarily in her assumption that an Alpha doctor such as himself might be well enough off to keep her, as she’s tired of working as a secretary. And that, in any case, she's currently carrying on a lacklustre affair with her boss.
“Uneventful,” he lies. He looks to Lestrade in an effort to divert the conversation. “Is this everything for the Croftdown Road case?”
Sherlock’s eyes widen, and he jerks his head up and down in a frantic little nod, tightening his legs around John’s hips, in case his enthusiasm isn’t quite clear enough. John chuckles and sits up on his heels, stretching across the bed to reach into the beside table. He retrieves a small bottle from the drawer and pours a generous amount of lubricant out onto his hand. Sherlock spreads his legs eagerly in welcome, and John smiles as he settles back between them.
“Then you should be paying more attention,” Mycroft snipes. “She’s been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year, and recently ended the marriage of a prominent Alpha novelist by having an affair with both her and her beta bond-mate. Separately.”
John stares down at him, than looks toward the window, where a sliver of moonlight peeks through the curtains as they billow slightly on a cool breeze. The window he’d most assuredly shut before retiring to bed. He turns back to Sherlock and arches a brow.
He can’t even say that he’s surprised; it’s par for the course when it comes to his luck. Though, on the rare occasion that he allows himself to think upon it, he wonders at the unlikeliness of his infatuation. He’s always been a staunchly pragmatic man; without any tendency — or patience — for dramatics, and a preference for blandly, conventionally attractive bed-partners. And Sherlock is nothing if not dramatic, down to his very countenance. He’s mercurial in the extreme; prone to bouts of melancholy, widely interspersed by manic bursts of energy.
when you put it that way,” Sherlock protests with a childish wrinkle of his nose. Like it was nothing. Just a silly little game. “But
“Have you?” He cuts John off, overcome by the sudden, fierce need to know. He’d deduce the answer for himself, if his mind wasn't so scrambled by his condition, but it is, and he
The Earl bustles out immediately, muttering indignantly under his breath as he departs, but Lord Fitzmaurice steps forward, advancing upon Sherlock instead.
They marry in December; a Christmas wedding. It’s simple and tasteful, just a small civil ceremony and dinner with a handful of their colleagues from the hospital. They have little to no family to speak of between the two of them; Mary’s parents long dead, and her Aunt relocated to America, while John hasn’t spoken to his father in years. Harry’s invited of course, but she doesn’t make an appearance. Instead Clara arrives alone, looking pale and washed out, but determinedly happy them despite the lingering sadness behind her eyes.
would suffice. For someone so otherwise demanding Sherlock is always so recalcitrant when it comes to this.
He’s had glimpses of course; the dangerous nature of their work has occasionally required him to assist John in cleaning and dressing a wound, and on occasion John’s wandered about in his dressing gown after bathing.
He loses himself in it; John's scent thick on the air, the small, strong hands gripping his hips, the thick alpha cock filling him up, and the swollen knot already beginning to tease his entrance with each thrust. The realization takes a moment to dawn on him through the haze of lust.
He needs to walk away from this temptation and forget all about it. Yes. He can do this. One step after another, he makes his way to the other side of the street, where he stops for a moment, taking long pulls of air through his nose.
, it does not naturally follow that the young omega is without any urges of his own. Perhaps he's set his cap at another alpha more to his liking. His stomach twists at the thought of Sherlock hiding away in some dark corner, tangled in the embrace of some young, attractive, infinitely more suitable alpha. Having to cry off to go visit with his sad, broken old friend.
Sherlock rocks back on his heels slightly in his hiding place, surprised by the vehemence of the reaction. It would appear that John had disapproved of Irene’s rather indiscreet attempt at courtship even more than he’d let on.
something else. He whines with increasing desperation, reaching down to scrabble frantically at John’s hair. “John, I- I-
is certainly one way to put it,” John quips, and Sherlock squirms a bit at the unexpected praise. He’s well aware that, as an Omega, his penis is markedly smaller than an Alpha’s, or even most Beta’s. The proof of that is quite apparent between them after all.
Christmas jumper he’d donned this morning, his secret love of the holiday was rather obvious. It was terribly endearing actually— though Sherlock

His rummaging comes to a sudden halt when he flips a photograph over to find a familiar face smiling up at him. His eyes dart to the label and he grimaces.
not to press it, really, but he can hardly stand by as a doctor and allow Sherlock to neglect his health
The next few weeks pass uneventfully, with both John and Mycroft handling Sherlock with kid gloves; thinking him absolutely devastated by the mess with Irene. It’s laughable really, considering that the only devastating part of the entire ordeal was the realization of just how thoroughly she’d managed to dupe him.
As if terribly bored with his fathers’ attention the little one scrunches his face and yawns widely before settling in to sleep, and they both smile in exuberant awe.
“I assumed. Show me.” She extends her hand expectantly for the phone and he raises it up out of her reach. “The passcode,” he demands. She doesn’t so much as blink, continuing to hold her palm out patiently toward him. After a few terse moments, he relents and hands it over.
“Well,” He laughs unabashedly, caught out. “I’ve never had much skill at pretending to be anything other than myself.”
“And?” Sherlock raises a brow without deigning to look up from his mobile. “Some idiot accidentally drowns himself and you’re coming to me with it? While I’ve always marvelled at your lot’s lack of investigative ability, I believe that, on this occasion, the course of events were suitably idiotic enough so as to be easily solved- despite the ongoing fumblings of Scotland Yard.”
better things to do with his time; he’s hardly in a mood to charitably assist the man still carrying around a humiliating video of him bumbling about pathetically under the influence of The Woman’s sedative. He can just be on his merry little way.
aware of his feelings for Sherlock. He hardens his gaze at her and refuses to flinch; Alpha to Alpha. Her lips curl tauntingly as she continues.
“Mr. Holmes has been reviewing the case files for us, and he has some questions to ask you,” Lestrade finally announces, and Sherlock expectantly swivels his head about to make eye contact with Lestrade over Eddie’s head. Lestrade rolls his eyes mildly, but then gives a permissory tilt of his head.
“Now, he won't be able to physically respond in any way. But he can hear you,” the doctor explains, and John nods his understanding as he steps into the white-panelled room. The doctor takes a step back into the doorway with a parting smile. “I'll give you some privacy.”
” Sally sputters in protest. “He can’t- we can’t just let him stay on and interrogate the suspect when he
“I know,” John acknowledges cheerfully as he settles back down in front of his own breakfast and picks up the newspaper he’d set aside, to pick up where he’d left off. “But the way I see it, that's my baby in there making you feel poorly. So the least I can do is try and make you comfortable. Besides,” he adds from behind the newly erected wall of newsprint, “you’ve never complained about my waiting on you before. Now there’s just an actual reason for it.”
Behind the mask, their eyes drop pointedly to the simple eye mask he clutches in his own hand. Despite the obstruction of their features, he knows with a bone-deep certainty that they’ve raised one brow.
Telling Molly on the other hand is, well, entirely unplanned. And he can’t even lay the blame for it at John’s feet.
Disappointingly, John merely blinks at him in bafflement, rather than launching into his usual volley of adulation.
“Any moment now, something’s gonna happen,” he questions her, once they’re both fully immersed in the image that he’s conjured with his words. “What?”
Sherlock marvels nasally from behind his hands as he attempts to stem the gush of blood from his nostrils. John hovers at his side, reaching up to press his own hands over Sherlock’s in assistance. “You lot work with
Where John had been posted with a bumbling new recruit. John; who isn’t even kitted out in the body armour that just failed to sufficiently protect some hapless constable inside. Who’d furtively palmed his gun off to a mute and fuming Sherlock in the parking garage of Scotland Yard, before they’d seperated, with a wry
forget I said that,” John cuts into his thoughts abruptly with a sigh. Sherlock looks up in surprise to find John squinting at him with a strange, unreadable air. “I just
“I don’t care,” John interrupts him decisively. “It doesn’t matter to me that you're an Omega. I’ll run after you if I damned well please, and anyone who thinks I should do otherwise can go hang.” As he dabs at particularly stubborn smear of blood on Sherlock’s chin, John’s fingers brush against the swell of his bottom lip. Sherlock struggles to suppress a shiver at the touch, squirming slightly in his seat. “My being an Alpha has nothing to do with our relationship. I don’t need my choices

how on earth is a fetus supposed to receive the essential nutrition it requires if it won’t let him keep anything down?
Granted, his reasoning abilities seem to be rather diminished, but he can’t think of anything else John might mean to do. And he’s slightly concerned that he might actually spontaneously combust if John
And with that, Sherlock executes a sharp u-turn and they speed away; heading off into the sunset, toward the distant lights of town.
"Like that?" John questions a touch breathlessly, their bodies slapping together lewdly as he thrusts.
They pass the rest of the evening ensconced in the library before the fire; Sherlock chattering away at a mile a minute, as if desperate to expunge all his built up thoughts and observations now that he has a captive (and willing) audience.
“Ah, yes,” Sherlock smirks in acknowledgement of the infinitesimal twitch of Mycroft’s nostrils. Over Mycroft’s shoulder, John’s eyes widen in alarm and he hastily makes his way to the sofa, deliberately placing himself as far from the other alpha as possible while still remaining within the room. “I was wondering how long it would take you. Seven and a half minutes; you’re getting
Even with his gift, there’s nothing he can do for Harry’s problems— he’s learned that much by now — but at least he might save a few hundred quid in cancellation fees.
Sherlock grins as he plucks the eyesore from John’s hands and flings it through the open window, out into the dark of the garden below.
“No,” Lestrade has the grace to look sheepish. “Look, you can still come along— just, you'll have to stay with the secondary team outside.”
“Next week? To nice Molly?” John queries in surprise. The corners of his mouth twitch upward in a slightly skeptical smile. “Sure you're going through with that?”
“Don’t snivel, Mrs Hudson. It’ll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet,” he chides, meeting the Alpha’s eyes over her head. “What a tender world that would be.”
An undeniable tension lingers between them for the first half of the ride; Sherlock’s mind remaining stubbornly fixated on John’s words in the flat. His Omega careens wildly between thrilled lust brought on by the display of protectiveness and care from
“What with the monster and that ruddy prison,” Billy shudders, “I don’t know how we sleep nights. Do you, Gary?”
Edward immediately responds with his best imitation of a grief-stricken brother. “Yes. Philip always preferred that I stay at the house, rather than just check in on her from time to time. Our mother remains in the country for most of the year, and it made him feel much more assured of her safety; having me here full-time.”
“I would have you right here, on this desk,” Irene declares fervently, gazing up at him with a predatory gleam in her eyes, “until you begged for mercy;
. But never during a heat.” They’re both red enough now that they could serve as traffic signs, but Sherlock’s somehow unable to look away. It’s a small consolation that John doesn’t either, but instead looks oddly... relieved?
could have told you that was a terrible idea! What, did you delete basic biology along with the solar system?” Sherlock opens his mouth to retort, but John swiftly lifts his hand up between them in a motion to cut him off. “That was rhetorical! You’re definitely experiencing rebound estrus. It’s a kind of false heat, triggered by major hormonal fluctuations. Most common after a miscarriage, but also known to happen after sudden suppressant cessation.” He scrubs his hand over his face with a growl of aggravation. “It’s one thing to skip the odd heat here or there, but the whole
they’d have planned for it to look like an accident, leaving them free of suspicion. The staged kidnapping was a failsafe enacted when things went wrong; meant to throw off any suspicion in the immediate aftermath, painting her as a victim, rather than a potential perpetrator. Once she’s located, and I’m able to speak to her, I’ll be able to tell you what happened.”
It’s that very cycle of emotion that leads him to peevishly object their new status quo one morning — while feeling particularly irritable with the world in general — when John wordlessly presents him with breakfast the moment he seats himself at the table.
and shakes her head pityingly. “But I don’t know how you stand it; living with him, being at his constant beck and call, catering to his every whim, and not
But sometimes, when the longing is just sharp enough, it pushes him into small lapses of judgement. Which is precisely to what he would ascribe his actions at the Lady Somerby’s annual masquerade. He’s always been a straightforward man, never one for deception; even of the harmless, frivolous sort of a masquerade. But one does not turn one's nose up at the tacit support of one if the ton's chief patronesses.
He can tell plenty about the photographer from the the angle and framing of the shot, the choice of lens, and the cardstock the photo is printed on. But as for the subject, nothing besides the plainly obvious. “She’s an Alpha. Quite wealthy; either via birth or long-standing success, given the tastefully understated nature of her appearance, which lacks the grandiose excess the nouveau riche. Other than that, nothing whatsoever.”
It’s almost impossible to imagine, despite the fact that he stood next to Mycroft Holmes, in a ballroom crowded by the creme of the beau monde as the man had announced — to the shock of all in attendance — the engagement of his brother to Captain John Watson.
“Indeed,” Sherlock agrees with a dramatic shudder. “An alpha child would immediately become the next Holmes heir. And of course, should the child present as an Omega instead, they’d still want for nothing. So in either case, you needn’t be concerned, financially speaking.”
Like he could just take her out to play with when he wanted to, then leave her to collect dust on the shelf the rest of the time.
John laughs as he clasps the base of Sherlock's member with his unoccupied hand. “I’ve never actually done this before, so I’m might be complete bollocks at it.”
He can picture them perfectly in his mind’s eye, as much as he'd prefer not to. Pale, lithe limbs tangled together, writhing about on sheets that cost more than John’s monthly salary. The alpha side of himself rattles the bars of its cage, gnashing its teeth and roaring with fury at the very thought of it. It wants nothing more than to hunt Irene Adler down and tear her apart.
After only a few long, slow pulls of Sherlock’s mouth, John moans loudly, then reaches down to try and dislodge the omega. Sherlock protests with a moan, pushing his mouth further down onto John’s length and tightening his fingers on the alpha’s hips. “We’re not going to -
Which is a blessing frankly; because otherwise John would be rather thoroughly giving them away this very moment. Mycroft hasn’t spared him so much as glance as of yet, but John has gone almost imperceptibly stiff at the insinuation, his eyes anxiously darting between them. He’s quite obviously thinking back on two particularly vigorous days in their flat, and Sherlock’s very enthusiastic
John gapes at the two of them in confused astonishment and Sherlock can hardly restrain hinself from rolling his eyes. Surely the man has realized by now that Mrs. Hudson is made of sturdier stuff. She'd been married to a drug lord and murder for
It’s as though a strangely pleasant fire has been set alight beneath every millimetre of his skin, wherever it touches John’s. A minute shudder wracks his body and he gives into the urge to pant lightly. John’s tongue peeks out to lick his lips in it’s habitual manner, and Sherlock’s eyes feel magnetically drawn to the sight.
“Your water broke more than a day and a half ago, and you’re still nowhere near fully dilated. It’s time to face the truth— he’s not coming the way you wanted him to, love.”
If everything goes according to plan, by the time Mycroft finds out, he’ll be unable to take any sort of negative action. Not without drawing considerably more attention to the situation than he would desire. The thought leaves Sherlock positively
Much later, Sherlock’s still in a semi-catatonic state of deduction in his chair; so deep in his mind that no outside stimulus registers. Irene curls up across from him in John’s chair and watches, with a proprietary gleam in her eyes, as if he’s already hers.
“No,” Sherlock grants with a sad smile. “Father died quite suddenly in a traffic accident when I was sixteen, about a year after I first presented,” he reveals, the words still triggering an ache of sorrow in his chest, even all these years later. “Mycroft became the Holmes Alpha Familiae and, to everyone’s complete surprise, he immediately arranged for me to begin taking suppressants. It had been expected that he’d simply carry on in Father’s footsteps
Despite their original plans not to go abroad, they impulsively book a last-minute honeymoon to Grenada, and the day before their flight he gets the 3 am phone call from Harry he’s been expecting for some time. He rubs a hand over his face as she tearfully informs his she’s just walked out on her long-suffering wife, and considers whether it’s worth the energy to rewind the booking.
The thought has him drifting back to those two long, decadent days, wrapped up together in Sherlock's bed… and on, um, various other surfaces within the flat. Fingers grasping against sweat-slick skin, and Sherlock panting words into the curve of John's neck. No, he supposes he never did get Sherlock to beg for
Why on earth would Sherlock have any desire to divulge any of that sordid little personal history if not in an exchange of information? Good god, sometimes the man really
“Wait, what?” John’s brow furrows together, and he frowns in the exact manner he always does whenever he doesn’t follow.
“So what you’re saying then is that he was a fit genius, and you liked his dog.” John interjects wryly.
“Aren’t you supposed to be the one panicking?” Lestrade asks, glancing back at John incredulously in the rearview mirror. “I was a wreck when my first was born.”
As the minutes stretch out, Sherlock becomes increasingly aware of the their closeness again; the uniform rhythm of John’s breaths, the warmth radiating off his body. His fingers twitch with the urge to reach out and
“I think you’re going to find Irene Adler tonight,” Sherlock announces, without acknowledging Mycroft’s petty wisecrack whatsoever.
When John absently shifts in his seat and leans even more closely into him, his Omega curls up inside and
John rises with a low growl, the indelicate situation in his trousers thankfully little more than a fleeting memory.
has the kind of lifestyle or temperament conducive to raising a child. Perhaps you’ve forgotten your status as a persona alieni juris, brother dearest? As your Alpha Familiae, ultimately all decisions regarding your person fall to me.” He levels a withering glare in John’s direction. “Or did that small detail not occur to you, Dr. Watson, when you were availing yourself of another alpha’s property?”
“So that’s it then,” John declares with a deep sigh, laying the knife down with a slightly unsteady hand. “It’s time to tell Mycroft.”
Despite his heavy heart, when he finally drifts to sleep some time later, it’s with the shadow of a smile on his lips.
“Mhm,” Sherlock hums the affirmative. “She really is a lovely girl. I mean, my parent’s don't approve, but they can't stop us.” He stops to take a long drag of his cigarette before continuing. “I know she pities me,” he reveals, blowing out a long stream of smoke, “That pisses me off. Though that's hardly fair of me, considering that she's…” he trails off when his voice breaks slightly. “You said you don't know how much time there is,” he changes the subject abruptly, turning his head to regard John. “What exactly does that mean?
the help of his gift, but that’s easier said than done when you’re a winder. People with simpler gifts often bemoan their relative uselessness, but they’ve never tried to live in the shadow of an exceptional one. Look at bloody Leonardo for chrissakes—
John closes his eyes, feeling his resolve crumbling away beneath those warm palms. He opens them again and looks to the door. In all these months that they’ve been meeting, not once have they been interrupted or intruded upon, and it seems even more unlikely here in Sherlock’s own home.
"You're stopping," Sherlock pants, nails biting at the mean of John's shoulders. "Why are you stopping?"
“Oh, you're rather good,” he confesses. The praise, as rare as it is, seems to drip like honey from Sherlock's mouth. It's like that bloody voice of his was designed for it.
“DNA tests are only as good as the records you keep,” she parries and John responds with a sour scoff.
An instant later, Sherlock is blinking at the warm sun beating down on his face on the balcony of John’s flat. Curious. He’s never been here during daylight. It’s quiet warm, and… pleasant. The balcony doors open behind him suddenly, and John steps out of the flat to join Sherlock by the railing.
“Alright,” he announces upon his return, setting the two steaming mugs down on the table top. “But we
on the sitting room sofa one rainy Thursday afternoon— what had started off as playful petting having quickly devolved into something rather more.
Mrs. Hudson insists on whipping them up an impromptu late-night meal, and Sherlock happily takes advantage of the current calm of his stomach to heartily partake of it. Once the meal is devoured and the dishes cleared away, they bid Mrs. Hudson goodnight and leave her to her nightly herbal soother.
Quite literally; he'd much rather die than submit to her. For the first time in his life, he’s absurdly glad of Mycroft’s de facto ownership of him. He can't think of an Alpha that Mycroft that would be
Much later, John and his nurse are making their way back to the front entrance, when a voice calls out suddenly in the hall behind them.
mimicking the scent of a bond, and serving as a constant distraction. His Omega recoils from the smell in disgust, leaving him feeling territorial and on edge.
- make it to bed if you keep that up,” John gasps, urgently clutching the worktop with white-knuckled hands, and Sherlock pulls himself off with a wet slurp.
“In approximately twenty-five weeks,” Sherlock states matter-of-factly as he drops to his knees to begin examining the torso at their feet. “But you do know, as you're always so quick to remind me whenever
“Ah, actually Mrs. Hudson,” John looks to him for assistance, but Sherlock offers nothing more than a sardonic lift of his brow while he crunches down on a biscuit.
“Yeah, no,” John grouses, “trust me, I remember her. But you must have imagined it when I was out at the pub. I didn’t even know you were expecting then! Why on earth would I have been…”
The last thing he wants is for John to piece together what, exactly, the code to the safe was. And to summarily make ridiculous assumptions about Sherlock’s interest in another Alpha because of it.

When John continues on down the aisle, Sherlock closes his eyes for a moment, and takes a long, deep breath through his nose.
within the norm for an unbonded Omega to travel freely in the company of an Alpha to whom they're neither bonded or related.
Sherlock levels an exasperated look at the Alpha, as though he’d just suggested going for a nude jog through the halls.
“Oh, of course boys! It’s no bother. No bother at all! Alfie loves to spend time with his Gran, don’t you, Poppet?” She bends down to ruffles the toddler’s riotous chestnut curls, and he gummily beams up at her before resuming his game. “Mycroft said that he’ll be sending a car round for him at half past. Now you go on— enjoy yourselves! From the smell of it, you don’t have much longer to be out!” She winks knowingly, “And don’t worry about the noise when you get home— I went out and bought myself a pair of earplugs.”
Mrs. Hudson is clearly in, going by the irritating clamour of vacuous daytime telly blaring out from beneath the door of 221A. He hesitates on the stairs briefly, considering whether to stop in to inform her of his...
“Jesus, Sherlock. I shouldn’t have- I just… I’m sorry.” He breathes deeply through his nose and blows it back out again sharply. “So whatever happened to him? Please tell me something terrible.”
, but he hardly wants to provide all the salacious details. ”I just thought it would be better to give you space.”
“And why shouldn’t we?” Sherlock whines impatiently. “The worst that could possibly happen already has— it isn't as if you can get me pregnant
As promised, John manages to convince Sarah to agree to a clandestine examination of sorts for a mystery patient that refuses to been seen officially.
“Almack's?” Sherlock’s brows draw together in confused displeasure, as though John has just confessed that he was otherwise preoccupied visiting Bedlam. “Why on earth were you at Almack's?”
He finds himself reflexively pulling his coat closed over his belly in an anxious flutter. John looks at him askance as he flips the collar up.
“Lestrade?” Sherlock frowns. “I could be persuaded to see why we might share the news with Mrs. Hudson, but I don’t see what business it is of Gavin’s.”
“Safest place I know,” Sherlock quips, looking down at Mrs. Hudson, and John could almost swear there’s a playful note in his voice. When she pulls the camera phone from her bra, John can hardly believe it. Though, with the woman’s personal history, he supposes he really shouldn't be all
And then, just as he’s begun considering giving the phone over to Mycroft and washing his hands of it, an unfamiliar woman appears at their doorstep and whisks John away with her.
“Because I was fortunate enough to be granted a voucher. And besides; it hardly matters where I was, be it that I wasn’t
Not that he’s at all denying what Irene’s been obviously attempting. While he’d been concerned about her potential interest in
He squints into the gloom, the dim glow from the streetlamp across the road doing little to illuminate the shadows. John and a large bearded man tumble out onto the rickety fire escape, mid-grapple, their grunts echoing out in the darkness. They slam into the railing, and something metallic clatters against the grate of the platform just before the inertia of their bodies sends them tipping up and over the rail.
“That's not what I mean,” Sherlock shakes his head in frustration. “Pass over; when it's your time.”
Clever enough he supposes. Fails to account for the rather convenient appearance of a corpse perfectly matching her own measurements however. A passable match would have been easy enough to acquire, but one specific enough to fool
When there’s no reply forthcoming, he makes his way to the kitchen doorway to check if Sherlock’s still absorbed in the experiment he’d been working on when John had gone up to get ready. Sherlock looks up from his microscope and sweeps his eyes over John in that calculating manner that always makes him squirm awkwardly in his own skin.
The wedding itself, on the other hand, far less so. Following the blessedly simple bonding ceremony at St. George’s, they adjourn to the Duke’s manse for a lavish venetian breakfast at his new brother-in-law’s insistence; a far more extravagant affair than John is entirely comfortable with. Harry herself makes an appearance, though he can’t recall having invited her, but he’s pleased enough to have the opportunity to present dear Clara to his new husband. Outside of that however, he hardly has the opportunity to speak to Sherlock; so bombarded they are with hobnobbing well-wishers. As the day drags on, he feels himself growing increasingly short-tempered by the festivities. By the time that they are toasted and seen off, he’s quite frankly chomping at the bit to be off.
“I’m afraid it’s time for me to bid you goodnight Gentlemen.” Sherlock imparts with a touch of… regret? His impossible eyes fix themselves on John in particular. “It was lovely to make your acquaintance Captain Watson— I do hope our paths will cross again soon.”
“Why didn’t you say,” John quizzes him suddenly, at just about the halfway point to Baker Street, “that you and Marie Cavendish knew each other? You must have recognized her the moment you saw name and her photograph in the case file.”
John props himself up on one elbow so that he can gaze down at Sherlock, lying stretched out alongside him, entirely unashamed of his nakedness. He reaches out in wonderment to stroke a gentle hand over the small, firm swell of Sherlock’s abdomen, made all the more noticeable by his supine sprawl.
When he finally comes, it’s like a revelation; his brain screeches to a halt, all excess sensory input switching off until all he can do is
“Go on,” Irene urges as she leans in over his shoulder to press a kiss to his cheek. “Impress a girl.”
it had brought to light, Sherlock had quite forgotten about the holiday entirely, until Mrs. Hudson had brought them several packages of fairy lights and some garland the night before, insisting that the flat was in dire need of some festivity. While John had put on a show of resisting, he’d been all too quick to hang them throughout the sitting room.
Sherlock shakes his head, silky curls jostling about violently. He reaches down to tug at John’s shoulders with pleading hands, pulling the alpha closer. John goes willingly, blanketing Sherlock’s slender form with his own.
Sherlock slumps down against his chest, and John pets his back clumsily as they both struggle to catch their breath.
“D’you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr Holmes?” She questions him, and he quirks a curious brow in response. “However hard you try, it’s always a self-portrait.”
If John wanted to flounce about informing all and sundry, he could very well field the inevitable fuss and expectations lobbed their way.
I’ve given up smoking!” Sherlock protests. “I’ve been eating whatever food you insistently foist upon me,
“My betrothed. It was to be announced at the culmination of tonight’s festivities. But, oh dear,” Sherlock looks down at his dishevelled garments and splotchy, reddened neck as if in surprise. “It does appear that I’ve been quite thoroughly ruined. I suppose now you’ll have to insist that I marry Captain Watson instead, Mycroft. Unless of course, Lord Wycombe, you’re content with possibility of a cuckoo inheriting the family seat.”
“So; we know that you’re a soldier, injured, and only recently returned to England, with lightened hair and darkened skin. The Empire has been engaged in an ongoing conflict against Napoleon’s forces on the Iberian Peninsula, with it’s markably warmer climes, for some years now. Which brings us to my original question: Spain or Portugal? Perhaps you would you be willing to answer a few questions for me. I’ve been trying to get my hands on more details about the conflict, but Mycroft is a
“Oh no, we're not - uh,” he stammers in reply when Gary apologetically informs him that they haven’t any doubles available for a few days.
“No,” Sherlock offers a tiny chuckle of his own. “But, despite my social failures, it was fully expected that once I presented, a suitable match would be arranged for me, with an Alpha or Beta from an appropriate family. At every opportunity, my parents trotted me out at dinners and parties, parading me about to be appraised by prospective suitors. Father made it clear that I would, of course, be allowed to attend university
If he doesn’t manage to drift off to sleep until he hears Sherlock’s lone footsteps returning late in the night, that’s no one’s business but his own.
While it’s clearly enormously titillating to some, he doesn’t give a toss what sexual shenanigans the members of the royal family idiotically choose to involve themselves in. When one lives under the microscope of an entire nation, it’s excessively foolhardy to assume you’ll be able to keep that sort of thing hidden without paying through the nose for it. He tells their man as much when he questions whether they’ll take the case.
Sherlock gapes at the crimson side of John’s face for a beat, slowly absorbing the meaning of his words. “You mean letting an Alpha knot me.” He hadn’t thought it possible, but John flushes even deeper.
He drums his fingers on the arm of his chair as he thinks back to that time of momentous upheaval; to that sudden, overwhelming sense of freedom he’d experienced. The worst of it had been the confusion of grief warring against relief; the painful, undeniable truth that Father’s death had served to unshackle him from a miserable, subservient existence.
Then he returns home to find Sherlock ensconced in the loo and puts two and two together; the great Sherlock Holmes is indeed ill after all, but too embarrassed to concede his humanity. He tries to offer his help, but to his complete lack of surprise, is roundly ignored. So he fixes Sherlock a cuppa and leaves it outside the bathroom door before heading upstairs for a nap.
Sometime later, he kneels in Irene Adler’s bedroom, her cruel eyes lit up in pleasure as she says, “You know, I was wrong about him. He
Most people who take him for a beta are idiots; easily fooled by a liberal application of scent neutralizer, his seeming independence, and the confidence he wields without hesitation. Molly's never counted amongst those.
“Could be dangerous,” John contends with a grin, playfully alluding to that first breathless, exhilarating evening together, hunting a murderous cabbie through the heart of London.
“And you invaded Afghanistan,” Sherlock remarks, and John can’t hold back the answering flood of laughter that bubbles up.
why you don’t have an Alpha. Nobody cares for damaged goods after all. Overall, it’s really quite shocking what kind of behaviour The Metropolitan Police evidently encourages in Omegas.”

. But look, you see,” he lifts his quivering hand once more, “my body’s betraying me. Interesting, yes?
Sherlock just barely resists the urge to snort unbecomingly at the intended dig. While he can hardly argue against
Sherlock cuts him off with a resonant snarl that arises from somewhere deep within him and surprises even himself. Mycroft’s fingers freeze on the screen, and he glances up in shock.
“What do you know about this woman?” Mycroft questions as he hands over a glossy, but entirely bland surveillance photo of a slim, elegantly dressed woman. Sherlock glances over it with an indifferent eye, and finds it devoid of anything particularly interesting.
John is possessed of a fairly strict moral compass; that would likely prevent him from making a decision that would result in the loss of the fetus at such an advance stage of gestation. While there is a possibility that he will feel resentment toward Sherlock regarding the deception, the child would be safe. Though John
And so they stare up at the ceiling together in silence, the hush settling over them like a thick quilt.
And thanks as always to my amazing beta, Miss_Communication, for being an absolute rockstar and magically proofreading this for me overnight, before I even got around to letting her know it was done! She made some wonderful suggestions and I'm so very grateful! <3
When she slips her hand down to the front of his jeans to palm his oddly disinterested prick, he knows for certain there’s absolutely no way that he can go through with this.
genes were destined to fall by the wayside until now. A child with my genetic material is unlikely to have anything below exceptional intelligence and you're not unintelligent yourself.”
"Yes," Sherlock gives a frantic nod, arching his neck invitingly. "Yes, do it." The sight of it makes John weak, unable to resist the urge to bury his face against it, scenting him properly for the very first time. His hips resume their previous rhythm, snapping forward over and over, grinding deep to rub Sherlock’s swollen little cock between their bellies, until the omega’s thighs begin to tighten and quiver tellingly around him.
than the jumper did, Sherlock retires to the sitting room to spend the evening petulantly sawing away at his violin.
The innkeepers are a cheery Beta and Omega bonded pair, who immediately assume he and John to be as well. Not that the mistake isn't entirely understandable. Much more so than when they're out and about together in the city, it’s
” Mycroft simpers sarcastically. He presses his forehead against his thumb and index finger, exhaling louding through his nose in irritation. “Sherlock, be
The discovery of a fourth victim within the week, and an offhand observation by John about ultraviolet re-entry stamps has them rushing back to St. Bart’s; to confirm whether they’d missed a commonality between the bodies that would finally weave the threads of the case together. They burst into the morgue just as Molly’s in the midst of finishing up an autopsy on a corpse significantly farther along in decomposition than their own, and the stench hits him like a wall, his stomach roiling instantly.
“God, forget I said that,” he sighs heavily. He forces down his own shame and lifts his eyes to meet Sherlock’s determinedly. If he’s ever had reason to use the skills of observation that Sherlock has taught him, the time is now. No matter what
“Yes, of course. Never again,” Sherlock lies, leaning over the driver's-side door to greet John with a kiss. “Mycroft’s sent word,” he explains as John goes round to the passenger side and climbs in, “he’s sending that analyst of his, Lestrade, to meet us.”
him,” Irene corrects pointedly without so much as lifting her eyes from her mobile screen. “He never replies.“

, specifically, but… difficult, yes. Not always, of course. Father did dote on Mummy and I, allowing us both to partake in some unusual hobbies for our gender. Mummy enjoyed dabbling in theoretical mathematics, and I was allowed the same with my chemistry equipment and various experiments. That was… good. To be entirely honest, I never even understood there was anything different about my life until I was six. In a fit of pique over being denied an extension of my bedtime, I mistakenly divulged the deduction I’d made regarding the intimate nature of Father’s relationship with my Beta au pair over dinner.”
John; it’s ultimate, ever-evolving experiment! We’ll be able to document, first-hand, the effects of genetic disposition versus the learned behaviours, and
and pesky flatmate free. Probably somewhere decadent, and indulgent, and perfectly befitting of their combined posh perfection.
“I just mean… you needn't— “ he huffs in embarrassment, “I realize that I'm growing quite unappealingly rotund. My research indicates that it’s common for sires to feel an instinctual drive to repeatedly copulate with a gravid Omega in an effort to keep them from straying, and to ensure the child carries only their genetic material, but I’m hardly about to seek out another Alpha or Beta, so you needn’t feel obligated to—“
“Your what?” John hears himself asking dumbly, his limbs growing heavy and numb; the entire tableau taking on the surreal quality of an unpleasant dream.
“I’m sure I have no desire to know what sort of debaucheries you’ve engaged in with my brother, Captain.” He pauses to retrieve a sheaf of papers from the drawer of his desk. “In any case, the extent of your misdeeds is immaterial; the behaviour I witnessed taking place in my library is sufficiently ruinous in and of itself, and the damage has been done. I do hope, for my brother’s sake, that you don’t make a habit of disrobing and mauling young omegas.”
The humiliation of Irene’s condescending dismissal before she pushes past him to taunt Mycroft is insignificant in comparison.
The path is well lit with charming little lanterns, and there are more than enough fellow guests about to preserve an air of propriety. As they walk the gravel path arm in arm, John finds himself at a loss for words once again. Despite his desire to remain in their company, it’s admittedly difficult to surmise an appropriate topic of conversation when you’re entirely unaware of your partner’s identity, and he feels little desire to engage in the usual veiled flirtation that’s commonplace at these sort of affairs. As they round a well-kept topiary alongside the walkway, the omega startles him by grasping his sleeve and pulling him into the small, shadowed nook just behind it.
“The two of you are downright nauseating, you know that, right?” Lestrade cuts in, grinning widely as he unwraps a sausage roll and bites into it. “If it wasn't for the fact it won me 200 quid in the office pool, I'd hardly be able to stand it.”
John smiles back at him, scrunching his face sleepily atop the pillow. It’s a small thing, warm and bright, and just for Sherlock. It makes something flutter inside of him.
“No,” Sherlock concedes with a chuckle that quickly devolves into a grunt as pain narrows his vision once more. He clamps down on John's fingers again, in an effort to conceal the show of weakness as much as possible in front of his brother. “Thank you,” he adds, a touch breathlessly.
“You know I don’t concern myself with trivia.” Sherlock parries apathetically as he hands it back. “Who is she?”
“Bloody hell Sarah -” He jerks with a start, then shakes his head and marches past her without further hesitation.
“Then why don’t you ask for it?” He crosses the room and holds out his hand to Mrs. Hudson, squeezing gently when she grasps it immediately. He turns back her sleeve carefully and ghosts his thumb over the bruise he finds there as she whimpers.
"I'm quite accustomed to it," Sherlock offers with a tight smile. "Now, pair that with the intense feelings of frustration and shame radiating off of it, and the fact he's just given it away? Marriage in trouble. If she’d left him, he would have kept it. People do – sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left
” he curls his lip around the word disdainfully, cutting his gaze away toward the kitchen to avoid John’s own before he continues.
“What?” Sherlock chokes out, his heart kicking up a hammering rhythm against his breastbone. It feels a bit as if all the air has been suddenly sucked from the room.
Which leaves them holed up for the second night in a row at NSY, poring over the case files with a handful of officers for any in sort of clue as to where he might have gone, a drowsy hush is settling over the room as the hours creep by. John perches on the tabletop next to Sherlock, legs dangling as he sips at his third cup of coffee and pages through a dense folder. His thigh brushes against Sherlock’s elbow with every gentle sway of his leg, and while Sherlock’s aware that it
“You’ve been very… thorough,” Mycroft sighs heavily as his eyes skim over the sheet once more before he folds it shut. “I wish our lot were half as good as you.”
“Bugger the neighbours, John!” Sherlock pushes his sunglasses up into his hair and grins upward delightedly. “A fourth tourist’s committed suicide! And this time they left a note! Quickly John!”
actually. Look, Sherlock, this doesn't mean that I... What I said that morning— I meant it. I don’t expect anything from you, and this doesn’t change anything between us, I promise.”
“So, she’s alive then,” he states with an odd hesitancy, as if carefully choosing his every word. “How are we feeling about that?”
“Oh," he settles back against the cushions at the sight of John, and waves a hand dismissively. "Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, she’s giving me a special deal. Owed me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out”
parental claim. It would have stayed Philip's hand until the birth at the very least, and ultimately granted him custody of the child if successful. I suppose in the end greed was the downfall of both of you. I can’t say that I’m terribly surprised. You always
John freezes for heartbeat, caught up in the sheer pleasure of it, then reaches between them and gently pushes Sherlock away.
Sherlock. It took him decades to perfect it- his whole career really- smoothing out all the kinks and glitches- oh, of course you know all about it! Silly me,” she laughs, and it’s a sweet sound; light and clear.
Sherlock bobs his head shakily, and John sweeps his fingers down into the warm junction of Sherlock’s thighs, slipping in between the warm, damp folds hidden there. As his fingers make contact, Sherlock lets out a loud, startled moan. John marvels at the slickness easing his way, the hot, puffy flesh parting welcomingly beneath his fingers.
On the other hand, he doesn’t particularly relish discussing the most difficult period of his life. Especially not in the backseat of a cab.
“Yeah,” John breaths against his neck, his hair brushing the underside of Sherlock’s jaw as he gives a minute nod. He works the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt open with a single-minded focus, pushing the fabric aside to thumb a tightly-furled nipple. “And this.”
“Ah,” Mycroft arches a brow, “I suppose I should have guessed as much. It does make sense now, why you dragged your feet for as long as you did about informing Mummy. Rather remiss of me not to have realized it before.”
an increased chance of complications. If there’s something wrong, it’s better to know about it straight away.”
— sharing conversation and a delicious meal in the warm glow of candlelight. He feels a twinge of melancholy as it inevitably draws to a close and they head home. But then, when they arrive, John insists he pick something to watch on the telly, promptly hauls Sherlock's feet into his lap as soon as they sprawl out on the sofa, and sets to liquefying the detective with an absolutely heavenly foot massage.
“Why didn’t you trust me?”John tediously interrupts, scrubbing a hand roughly over his face. “Would you have even told me at
him once again. And every time, he cuts those thoughts off as abruptly as they arise, thoroughly disgusted with himself. Contrary to his own inclinations, John had obliged Sherlock in a moment of need, and rather than being grateful, Sherlock was scheming as to how he might persuade him into doing so again? He was behaving no better than the worst stereotype of a grasping, manipulative Omega.
Is that a euphemism?” Marie arches a delicate brow at Sherlock in amusement. “It wouldn’t be out of character for you to have some kind of unorthodox arrangement. You never
He’s never really thought of it. Not really. It isn’t terribly alpha-like of him but, while finding a bondmate and starting a family has always lingered
“You know what I mean!” John protests weakly, face still flaming, and develops a sudden, determined interest in the periodic table on the wall. He opens his mouth as if to speak again, closes it, and then ventures hesitantly, “Well, um, actually there is… uh, one thing.”
He forces a pained laugh to disguise his unease. “Could you put something on, please? Anything at all,” he scornfully offers her the napkin in his hands. “A napkin?”
should fill Sherlock with horror— but instead, his eyes roll back and he cries out as his cock spasms, hot fluid splashing up between their bellies. John lifts his head to clumsily mash their mouths together in a kiss as they ride out the aftershocks, shuddering against one another helplessly.
It's obvious now; everyone knows that Alphas are possessive of their Omegas, but it’s often overlooked that the instinct goes both ways. Regardless of bond status, the hormones of pregnancy cause breeding omega’s to be more possessive of the sire. He’d even been jealous of John interacting with
“Oh! I suppose we should, uh… disrobe. To my knowledge, it’s generally a requisite step of the entire process.” Sherlock babbles, fully extending his arms beneath himself to sit up.
you must know John, that, despite my wanting to keep the child, I truly hadn’t at all meant for this to happen. I’ve no desire to... trap you. I’m well aware that there are certain beliefs about we omegas in this regard, but I don’t expect anything of you
“Because,” John forces his lust-addled mind to reason. “Your heat is coming on; I can smell it. You could… I could get you with child.” He offers bluntly. Beneath his nightshirt, thankfully out of sight, his traitorous cock contradicts his objection, twitching immediately at the very notion.
“A little lively for dead people.” John argues with lift of his brows as a boisterous group makes their way past them, chatting animatedly.
The otherwise minor collision is made spectacular by the unfortunate inclusion of Angelo's full water pitcher upending it's contents all over the poor girl.
subside, glasses of cool water, digestives, and delightfully soothing ginger candies seem to appear in John’s hands as if from thin air.
“Hamish,” he interjects, unable to resist the desperate desire to disrupt their focus on one another any longer. It’s successful, as they break their stare to turn to him in puzzlement instead.
“So it went easier this afternoon than I expected,” he comments, plunking himself down next to Sherlock on the sofa as he begins tucking into his food. “In the end, at least.”
“Of course not.” Sherlock snaps, then pauses, considering the unintended implication. “That isn’t to say— What you so absurdly attempted to imply earlier was entirely off the mark. John ensured that the circumstances were as pleasant for me as I imagine is possible.”
He follows Irene’s gaze as it darts worriedly to the mirror above the mantel. “Thank you. On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child. Amazing how fire exposes our priorities.”
Despite his state, Sherlock can’t resist the opportunity to needle John a bit, and so he raises a brow at the arguably poor choice of words. As expected, John blushes furiously. It's possibly the most adorable thing Sherlock's ever been witness to in his life.
After several long moments of silence, Sherlock prompts John back to attention with an offhanded request. “John, please can you check those flight schedules, see if I'm right?”
I didn’t inform you sooner only because…” He trails off, squirming in his chair for a few tense moments before taking a long, deep breath. “I realize we agreed that it was an experiment and nothing more, but… I’ve found myself undeniably defensive of the… of
“Your…” John pauses as Sherlock flails out and clutches at his hand, squeezing tightly as another contraction grips him. John's face rearranges itself into its familiar, steady doctor’s demeanor. “How long have you been having contractions?”
“How did things go with Mycroft?” John asks as Sherlock installs himself next to Lestrade at the table, carefully levering himself down into the chair with the DI’s steadying hand at his elbow.
Much later, they lie tangled up together in the bed linens, listening to the sounds of London filtering in through the open window. The duvet is lost somewhere on the floor, entirely unneeded and unmissed thanks to the lingering heat between their bodies.
“Deal with what?” Mycroft blinks, perplexed. He sets his phone aside and takes up his umbrella from where it’s leant between his knees, giving it a leisurely twirl as he awaits Sherlock’s explanation. Sherlock huffs unhappily, shifting in his seat and fiddling with his phone in agitation.
“Look,” John winces, “it's not something I can just turn off. Believe me, I've tried. But I swear it won’t—”
Sherlock cries out, digging his fingers into the soft skin of John’s nape. He wraps his legs tightly about the alpha’s middle, as high as they'll go, desperately trying to tilt his hips up for a better angle. John wrestles Sherlock’s left leg up and drapes it over his elbow, planting his hand on the mattress next to Sherlock’s ribs for leverage as he picks up the speed of his thrusts. The stretch makes Sherlock’s breath judder out of him in short bursts with every snap of John's hips.
As he comes down, he nuzzles Sherlock’s shoulder, licking gently at the fresh bond-bite to soothe. Sherlock grunts quietly in acknowledgement, his hand coming up to pet clumsily at the back of John’s head.
“You're not the only one who knows how to snoop,” he replies cagily, pinning the sonogram printout to the refrigerator door with a magnet.
John laughs at that, than quiets down and gives Sherlock a thoughtful sidelong glance. “Why didn’t you tell me,” he asks, “about Mycroft?”
“Not to me it isn’t.” John replies placidly, unmoved. He makes more room for himself, pushing upward insistently until Sherlock folds his left knee and plants his foot flat against the mattress. He strokes his thumb gently over the slick opening just below Sherlock’s cock, where testicles would hang were he an Alpha or a Beta, then carefully slides two fingers inside. “God, you're so
Their guests have all fallen silent, clutching their glasses and awkwardly averting their eyes from the domestic tension.
He winces mildly at the jab, and ignores the startled look that John levels at him out of the corner of his eye. He supposes it
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock offers plaintively, reluctantly lowering his hand back to his side. “I- I said I'm not much of a dancer.
” John bites out. Sherlock ignores the painful clench in his chest at the irritation in John’s voice. It’s a struggle to keep his face perfectly expressionless, but he manages.
To John’s complete bewilderment, Sherlock carries on behaving in his newly cagey manner over the next several weeks; clingy and tactile one minute and holed up in his bedroom for hours on end the next. John heavily suspects that it has something to do with Irene Adler’s sudden and un-spoken of departure. Whenever he attempts to broach the topic, however, Sherlock shuts it down immediately.
When John simply stares back at him in baffled amazement, he huffs condescendingly and rattles off a detailed explanation of his deduction, then rises to hand the phone back to Irene.
“Look,” she begins, sinking down into the free chair opposite the two men, “Last week we had the most
an idiot. As nonexistent his experience with this situation may be, he's well aware that is most definitely more than a bit not good.
“Yes, well; a business-like arrangement would be perhaps a bit more believable if you weren't sat here, holding my hand and stroking my hair,” Sherlock muses with a fond smile.
“What?” He asks, embarrassingly mystified by the sudden non-sequitur. She perches on the sofa and looks up at them placidly as she pulls off her frightfully uncomfortable looking shoes.
“Oh ho,” he exclaims when a flushed and strangely dishevelled looking Sherlock finally makes his appearance, bursting into the room as though the devil himself were on his heels. “No disguise?”
He wrestles the remaining buttons of John’s shirt free while John successfully fumbles open the resistant fastener of Sherlock’s trousers. They break apart fleetingly while Sherlock to wriggles out of them and kicks them over the edge of the mattress. In the meantime, John tugs the now crumpled duvet out from beneath them and shoves it off to the floor. Sherlock clambers back up on his knees, and slides his hands beneath the hem of John’s vest as soon as John shrugs free of his shirt. He rucks it upward while tipping his head up to lick into John’s mouth in a blistering kiss. Together they eventually manage to peel it over John’s head, though it takes twice as long as it should.
“Here we are,” he announces, waving an arm about to present the sitting room. It’s warm and cozy- if slightly eccentric- and seems as though it might be more suited to Central London, rather than this balmy seaside town. Two arm chairs face one another in front of a Victorian-looking mantlepiece: one rather rather frumpy and old-fashioned, with it’s faded red floral pattern, and a striped woollen throw draped over it’s sloping back; the other sleek and modern, all chrome and leather and right angles. “You like it?”
John seeks out the library immediately upon his arrival, determined to enjoy every last moment he has with his friend to the fullest. As expected, he finds the omega already awaiting him, curled up indecorously in one of the reading chairs by the mantle, staring distractedly into the flames.
For the first time that he can remember, a lull between cases is a boon rather than a curse. At every opportunity they spend hours in bed together, whiling away the days touching and tasting and exploring.
“No, they're obviously sleeping together. The pregnancy was undoubtedly accidental; no one in their right mind would get themselves into such a situation purposely, but contraceptives aren’t always entirely effective. In any case, she discovered that she’s carrying her brother-in-law's child shortly before her husband was due home. Not enough time for them to deal with the situation without arousing suspicion, even if they wanted to. Which obviously they didn’t, because they’re
“What is there to discuss?” Sherlock straightens in his chair, his heart speeding up to an uncomfortable gallop within his chest. Is John reconsidering his acceptance of the situation already? He
Sherlock knits his brow and forces himself to calm and focus. He scans John carefully, taking in every infinitesimal detail and tell that he can. As he does, John frowns, his eyes darting to Irene then back, and then he softens, smiling hesitantly up at Sherlock.
Two innocuous kidnappings, and one semi-dressed standoff later, Mycroft is serving them tea in Buckingham Palace, and Sherlock is both newly clothed and smugly victorious. It’s endlessly amusing how the promise of nudity, either as enticement or offense, seems to always be such an effective bargaining chip.
an absurd insinuation about the labs at Baskerville out of the tour guide is child’s play. The moment that the young Alpha pulls the cast of a massive paw from his bag, however, Sherlock’s curiosity is well and truly piqued.
Staring across at her in an abandoned power station, John pushes down the bubbling rage inside himself and feels a certain exhaustion and defeat settle in his bones. He doesn't know why he says what he does- to convince himself perhaps, or salvage what little bit of dignity he has left as an Alpha- but the words spill out of him anyways. “Who... who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes, but – for the record – if anyone out there still cares, I'm not actually interested in Omegas.”
to it being armed, it would have served as a perfect bypass to the system. Hence the lack of any alarms,” he concludes, smiling brightly. “Quite clever actually, if it was intentional.”
a doctor; he might still identify Sherlock’s condition on his own. It's really only due to Sherlock’s terrible habits that he hadn’t already. If Sherlock wants to be the one to deliver the news,
It’s Mrs. Hudson who suggests the idea of paying every seller in a two-mile radius, which seems entirely impossible to John at first, but in the end turns out to be a simple matter of texting Mycroft. Apparently the release of additional funds from Sherlock’s trust fund, outside of his monthly allowance is perfectly acceptable for the purpose.
John lets loose an uproarious laugh, and a smile creeps across Sherlock’s face before he slowly joins in with a chuckle of his own. It starts off a wavering, as if rusty from disuse, then settles into a steady, confident rumble. As their laughter dies down, John realizes with a jolt that their hands are still loosely grasped between them.
The case is immediately off to a promising start. Coaxing the details about the various sightings of the supposed ‘hound’
“Would you like to marry me instead? It’s just... Molly seems great, but why not someone you've connected with?” John proposes, a bit breathlessly. He beams up at Sherlock, who stares down at him in utter shock for a moment before laughing and dropping to his own knees as well. He clutches at John’s face kiss him exuberantly, nodding continuously all the while. "So," John pulls back from the kiss to laugh, “is that a yes then?”
.” He grips John’s shoulders as the smaller man plants his knees for better leverage, and begins to steadily pump his hips. He starts gently, but at the urging of Sherlock’s own shifting hips, and the demanding instructions hissed into his ear, he’s soon thrusting in earnest. Sherlock moans, digging his fingers deeper into the sweat-slick curve of John’s back and lifting his hips desperately to meet the increasingly hard thrusts.
“Would you perhaps…" his voice creaks, rusty from disuse, and he pauses to clear his throat. "Might I interest you in a turn about the garden?"
But there’s nothing for John say to all that. He certainly isn’t about to ask for the usual explanation on how, exactly, Sherlock’s deduced all of this. And telling him off will only vindicate his obvious compulsion to alienate others as a defense mechanism.
Sherlock ignores him entirely, retreating to his bedroom to perch on his bed. Inside the box lies Irene’s camera phone, distinct and unmistakable. He feels a leaden weight settle into his stomach.
“Absolutely,” Sherlock confirms. “I’m sure that all his old cronies will positively fall over themselves to pat him on the back, and congratulate him on a job well done, if he does. Bringing his unruly Omega dependens to heel for the good of the family name,
the ones that are plenty occupied... with sucking sustenance through a straw for the next six weeks.”
"He gave the phone to you; that says he wants you to stay in touch. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you
you,” John drawls with a cheeky wink. “So why the coat? I like it- you look very mysterious, what with those cheekbones, and the collar all turned up making you look cool. But do you need it?”
Alpha who beat Sherlock Holmes. The situation isn't improved by the fact that every time John forgets himself, and considers checking Sherlock for fever, he's struck by a vivid recollection of exactly what happened the last time he did so, and his prick grows embarrassingly stiff in his trousers. Which is- well, he's a
Sherlock squirms unhappily in his chair at the reminder of the unpleasantness of the appointment in question. He'd thought it slightly uncomfortable being examined by Sarah, but
If only Harry had been smarter. If only he’d been the heir rather than the spare. If only he hadn’t become a soldier and gotten himself shot on some godforsaken Spanish plain.
It’s always best to play one’s cards close to the chest with Mycroft, and he’s already given away too much. And so, Sherlock merely lifts his chin and stares back, deliberately affecting an air of affront. It’s the perfect mask from behind which to carefully analyze his brother’s countenance. Mycroft’s never been able to resist an opportunity to preen like a puffed-up patridge over a successful slight.
of John is very nice. His fingers brush over the dusting of tawny hairs beneath John’s navel, trailing down until he reaches the thick nest of curls that surround his erection. He wraps his hand around the scorching hot appendage and squeezes lightly. John moans unabashedly, then reaches down and draws Sherlock’s hand away.
of you,” he adds, turning his head to meet John’s eyes, “need to get a hold of yourselves.” Before the situation can descend into some ridiculous pheromone-driven brawl, Sherlock decides to step in.
of him; his sweat and saliva smearing across Sherlock’s skin, his breath mixing with Sherlock’s as they pant together. It’s better than cocaine, or heroin, or morphine, or any combination of chemicals that he’s ever injected into his veins. He suddenly has a much better understanding of why people seem to be so mad for it; lying, cheating, stealing and killing over it.
afraid it can't wait!” Sherlock insists, cutting Lestrade off as collects his coat from where he’d thrown it. “And anyways, you’ll have more than enough of that dull paperwork you love so much to occupy you in the meantime.”
I've been working on two new unrelated works; a magical realism AU and a 50's-era 'Tell it to the Bees' adaptation (the cardinal sin of writers: getting distracted by new ideas!) which I'm hoping to begin posting soon. I've also sketched out a bit of a post-Reichenbach installment for this series, but I'm undecided at the moment if I want to go there. This seemed like a lovely place to end for the time being— especially for those of you who prefer to have skip that whole angst-ridden situation. But let me know in the comments what you think! (Should we just let the happy family be?) I may also put up the one last John interlude I have in drafts, and maaaybe a separate little bonding epilogue, depending on the Reichenbach verdict.
“Yeah, I'm on it, yeah.” John coughs. He turns his attention to his laptop, desperately willing away his sudden erection and hoping that if either of him notice his embarrassed flush, they'll assume it's in reaction to her words. As he sets to it, Sherlock continues on, practically oblivious to John's very presence. He hasn't taken his attention from Irene for a moment; of
Sherlock gives a final snort, taking John’s empty plate and mug in hand and setting them alongside his own on the bedside table.
” Edward confirms bitterly. “Philip was engaged to another Omega when we were coming of age- had been for years. A few months before they were to be bonded, Tabitha died in an accident. Marie’s sire had been in talks with my mine, arranging our own bond-match... When Tabitha died, she thought it more advantageous to offer Marie for Philip instead," he scoffs resentfully, "as a
pick up a hint of my own diminished scent beneath the artificial one, they’ll assume it’s the scent of a bond. I’m sure I wouldn’t pull anything over on a perfumer or pheromonist, but the general populace is hardly so discerning.”
Despite having had numerous sexual partners, and relationships, John has never bonded. He has, in fact, never openly expressed a desire for offspring. Conclusion: There is a distinct possibility that, upon being informed, John will be amenable to a temporary separation, without any need for Mycroft’s involvement. It would be the less effective of the two options however, given that John's scent is quite established within the flat itself. And if were John to leave under those circumstances… well, he might not come back.
When John merely barks a short, bitter laugh in response, that small part of Sherlock that's purely, uncomplicatedly, Omega withers up inside of him piteously. For once, he can’t even think of anything punishing to say to it.
“I’ve always wanted to try this,” Sherlock admits when he finally reaches his goal, and takes John’s erection in hand. John favours him with an encouraging groan in response as he proceeds to run his tongue enthusiastically around the tip and down the shaft. When he slips it into his mouth, John tangles a hand in his curls;
of it is like. How it feels, wanting something, or someone you can't have. Being offered up to the highest bidder, and marrying whoever your family decides.
He pulls the pillow that smells strongest of John to his face, breathing in the faint scent as deeply as possible. Unceremoniously, he shoves his free hand down the back of his pants and between his legs, reaching past his arsehole to find his slit already slick and wet.
he hisses briefly, slowing his hips down entirely. His left hand leaves Sherlock's hip to reach past his cock and between his legs; searching fingers stroking the hot, slippery entrance stretched out around his own hugely swollen cock. "You're so wet," he marvels, and his moan of approval joins Sherlock's broken one as he gives a small twitch of his hips and feels himself slip deeper beneath his fingers. "You feel so ready. Are you ready?" He asks, hand sliding upward from Sherlock's slit to gently squeeze his small cock.
“Miscarry, yes. A prolonged separation from the pheromones of the siring Alpha prior to the the third trimester results in spontaneous termination in approximately ninety-seven percent of cases.”
Sherlock swans inside, turning his collar up against his cheekbones in that way that makes him look mysterious and irresistible just as they walk past a group of young alphas by the car park. More than a few of them glance Sherlock’s way, and it puts John’s teeth on edge. Beneath the mask of mild amusement that he deliberately plasters over his face, he struggles to repress the humiliating impulse to turn and snarl territorially in their direction. Sherlock buys into his facade completely and pinkens charmingly before offering up a weak excuse about the cold. Despite the lanky detective’s insistence otherwise, he clearly feels
be dealing with them. But the last thing I need is another brawl on my watch. You take Sherlock home and get him all sorted out. I can get your statements from you tomorrow.”
“How many of them are dead?” Sherlock interrupts him abruptly. “Or should I say full-timers? I estimate approximately eighty to eighty-five percent, though it’s somewhat difficult to tell from up here, and I’m still narrowing down some of the corroborating criteria. I haven’t quite been applying myself to it as such.”
“ he growls in frustration, fingers fisting in his own hair. “I worry about you because I’m in bloody
? And then you just stopped— just like that? Are you mad? What were you thinking?” John’s eyebrows appear to be trying to flee from his indignation up into his hairline. He resembles nothing so much as a displeased hedgehog.
For once, Sherlock can’t be bothered to make any sort of fuss about the concept of repetition. Without looking up from the hearth, he repeats himself quietly.
“Yes, I shall certainly endeavour to do so.” Mycroft responds tightly, teeth clenched in a fierce rictus of a smile. “Pray tell,” he continues, eyes snapping hawkishly to Sherlock, “exactly
won’t help you.” He pivots on his heel and begins marching away in the soldierly manner he habitually reverts to in anger. Sherlock tenses, prepared to make his own escape before he's spotted.
The DI piles the packets on the side table next to Sherlock with a grin, then shrugs out of his coat and tosses it over one of the dining chairs before venturing off into the kitchen. Sherlock waits until he's well occupied with discussing the latest rugby upset with John before furtively snaking out a hand to snatch one from the heap.
It would be more comedic if he weren’t the target of said indignation, but it’s still terribly endearing.
And just like that, they’re off. As Sherlock bolts, John can't help but deflate slightly, fighting off a frisson of disappointment that he knows he shouldn’t feel. He gives his head a firm shake, then turns to head for the tube, nearly colliding with the solid wall of Sherlock’s chest.
” he waves his hand in a vague little circle in the direction of Sherlock’s head, before turning to head out the door. “It helps him process, I think, talking it out. So he does just that; carries on talking to me whether I’m here or not.”
Thankfully, John doesn’t appear to notice the outwardly visible of the two, distracted as he his with his attempt at discretion.
“You're an idiot,” Sherlock laughs, relaxing a bit and hopping up to sit on the bin behind them. “I've never been on a dance floor,” he admits.
, his knot shoving past the slight resistance, throbbing as it swells to completion. The ring of muscle clamps down around it, squeezing and holding it snugly in place. As John’s cock twitches in release, he bares his teeth against the taut skin of Sherlock's neck and, for an instant, Sherlock's sure that John’s about to bite him. He doesn’t of course— and even the
pick up a hint of my own diminished scent beneath the artificial one, they’ll assume it’s the scent of a bond. I’m sure I wouldn’t pull anything over on a perfumer or pheromonist, but the general populace is hardly so discerning.”
With the energy of a much younger man, John hands his cane off to his nurse, and immediately moves toward the figure lying prone on the single hospital bed against the wall. When he reaches the bedside, he stops to quietly take in the sight before him. A long, slim man with a riot of salt and pepper curls reclines against the pillows, icy blue eyes staring expressionlessly at the ceiling. A ventilator, plugged into the tracheostomy tube in the man’s neck works tirelessly beside the bed; the hiss and flow of air from the pump filling the silence in the room.
“Oh, just passing the time.” Sherlock rolls his head against the wallpaper to look over at him and his eyes flick downward to John's mouth.
I realize that you're concerned about your progeny, John, but I can assure you that I am more than capable of looking after myself.”
less uptight than they used to be. And two, this is a party town. No one's judging. Face it. If they were staring, it's because I’m fit.” He runs a hand jokingly down along his flat abdomen while grinning rakishly.
Sherlock rolls his eyes gratuitously at that, but tosses his things over the arm of the small sofa and moves to the opposite side of the desk regardless. He arranges a number of the items before him into some semblance of order before starting off slowly, as if laboriously elaborating something to a primary schooler.
“No,” he shakes his head, digging his heels in firmly as they clasp his forearms and try to tug him gently back into their sphere. “I’m afraid that I…" he hesitates. It is, perhaps, unwise to make grand confessions to masked strangers, in an open garden where others could happen upon them at any moment.
Perhaps Victor was right all those years ago, and it was only a matter of his suppressants holding him back from feeling this. He doesn’t regret it in the least. Had he listened to Victor then, he likely wouldn’t be here with John now, and there’s no one he’d rather experience this with. It’s amazing. There are surely better ways to describe it, but they escape him at present. All he can think about is the blunt, unrelenting pressure making a space for itself inside of him. John carefully buries the entire length of his cock then stills and takes a long, deep breath.
“Well, would you look at that,” Lestrade marvels, tracing their son’s profile with one fingertip. “Looking like a proper person already. He's got your nose Sherlock. Everything alright?”
if John’s only stipulations are to be the most basic of necessities for ensuring the optimal development of their child, far be it for him to complain.
John has no rejoinder for that; he knows very well that almost any remark would be unbearably trite. Nothing he hasn’t heard before from some over-enthusiastic student protester campaigning for Omega rights.
“She’s in shock, for God’s sake, and all over some bloody stupid camera phone.” John huffs, apparently taking Sherlock’s teasing at face value. “Where is it, anyway?”
“Oh, for Christ's sake, just listen to the man and eat the bloody sandwich, will you!” Lestrade rolls his eyes and exclaims exasperatedly around a mouthful of biscuit. Sherlock glares murderously at them both as he grudgingly accepts the plate and takes a dramatically delicate bite. From the way he carries on, would think it’s arsenic-laced egg salad that’s long gone off, not a simple cheese and pickle.
“Yes, ” Sherlock takes a leap of his own and replies after a few moments of silence. “He…Father was a good Alpha, and an affable man; very loving in his own way. But he was still of a very... traditionalist mindset,” Sherlock casts his gaze out the window, “in regard to the station of Omega’s in the world.”
. Who’s Clara? Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. When you put it in my hand, I was immediately assaulted by the overwhelming impression of a noisy row."
With a brisk nod and rub of his palms down his thighs, the doctor visibly steels himself and finally rises from his chair to set off predictably toward the kitchen. Sherlock allows himself a brief moment of affectionate amusement as he watches through slitted eyes. England could fall, and John's first response would probably be to nip off to switch the kettle on.
” Sherlock drawls in a spectacularly unimpressed manner. “I gave it a great deal of consideration when the result of the situation became apparent, and while it will admittedly have a significant effect my lifestyle as it currently stands, it's an extraordinary scientific opportunity. Given my normally religious use of suppressants, and my disinterest in acquiring a bondmate, it’s highly unlikely to ever be a possibility again. I simply cannot pass it up.”
“We already know where she is,” Mycroft replies with a disinterested sniff. “As you were kind enough to point out, it hardly matters.”
“Fine,” he concedes with an extravagant eye-roll, and accepts both it and the bottle of water that follows immediately afterward. He unwraps the roll and grudgingly takes a bite before pulling a stack of papers toward himself with his free hand.
“We can stop,” he offers, gentling Sherlock with a soft stroke along his side. “There’s no rush if you’re frightened.”
“Some exhibited behaviours of estrual inebriation are heightened flirtatious behaviour, speech disinhibition and mild to moderate aggression toward other unbonded members of the same gender class. Case in point; you and Liam O’Donnelly bashing each other’s noses in over Tisha Hughes.”
“North,” John grins and extends his hand in greeting. “I've heard about you. Brilliant that. Quite, quite brilliant.”
“I want to,” he affirms, murmuring the words against John’s lips, “I want all of London to know that I belong to you."
“Well, I’ll be delicate then,” she amends, rising from her chair and crossing the space between them to kneel at his feet. She reaches up and curls her fingers around his hand where it dangles over the edge of his armrest. “Let’s have dinner.”
was the furthest thing from my mind! I mean…” he casts an eye about the room, then lowers his voice even further, to a whisper, “we only did it without a condom
He shoves his hands beneath John’s jumper as they kiss, insistently pushing the fuzzy wool upward. When he wrestles it off, only to discover both a button-down and vest beneath, he drops head to rock his forehead against John’s with an entirely different sort of groan than before.
“You suggested Hamish, if I was looking for baby names. Well,” Sherlock waves his hand toward his abdomen, as if exhibiting an important piece of evidence. “It just so happened that I was.”
John attends what feels like an endless stream of dinner parties, routs, assemblies, and balls — he puts on a proper face; engaging in cordial conversation with all the lovely, proper, appropriate young omegas paraded before him. And then, the moment that he’s able, he steals away in search of the venue’s library, garden or observatory, where he’s sure to find Sherlock.
anything without an Alpha. Just because I'm unbonded, not incapable! Being treated like a wayward teenager who neglected to use a condom, instead of a fully grown adult is growing inconceivably tiresome.”
“Hello, you clot,” John whispers with a cheeky grin, reaching down to gently take one long-fingered hand in his own and stroke his thumb over the back of it. He bends down to smooth a hand over the unruly curls and presses a kiss to the placid forehead. “It's good to see you.”
“Mycroft’s, on the other hand, not so much,” he adds lamely in an attempt to detract his confession.
“Is that… Shakespeare?” Even in the hay moonlight, the hot blush that stains Sherlocks cheeks is obvious. It’s painfully becoming, and the loveliest sight he’s ever seen. John’s heart feels suddenly full to bursting. “Are you my Juliet?” He teases.
The results of that test had been unacceptable anyways, just like the previous four before it. And so, after carefully verifying John’s absence, Sherlock had opened the door in order to snatch the promised mug and set to work preparing for the sixth.
“Likely not,” Sherlock drawls, lifting his hips to allow John to ease them past his bottom. John draws them down Sherlock’s legs and off, throwing them over his shoulder with a cheeky smile. Sherlock laughs and spreads his legs slightly, pulling John down to press their lips together again. Their hips roll together, the sweat slicking their skin making for just the right amount of friction. John breaks the kiss to mouth down along the curve of Sherlock’s neck desperately, biting and sucking while Sherlock moans and arches into it.Then, reaching one arm out above them, John begins paw ineffectually at the bedside table, and Sherlock glances up between John’s face and hand in bewilderment.
