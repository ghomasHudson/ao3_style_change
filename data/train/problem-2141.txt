“Mate, you okay?” Lestrade was looking at him in concern.
“What happened?” John asked, gently.
“Would you like to talk about it?”
He supposed he couldn’t argue with that. “Anyways. I kissed him.”
John fell asleep much faster than Sherlock imagined. To his surprise, he felt himself growing tired. He had planned to catalogue this moment, fit it perfectly into his mind palace to ensure he wouldn’t forget it, but his eyes started to close. He made sure John was asleep-he was-before allowing his eyes to shut.
“Of course not,” he snapped. “Leave me alone, Mycroft.”
“John,” Sherlock said, but he couldn’t say anything else. It was true that Mary had sacrificed herself for him. It was also true that he might have been able to push her out of the way.
“I haven’t even tried to be good to you, Sherlock. I haven’t tried to be nice. I haven’t even tried.”
*****
He blinked, once, then raised his eyebrows. “Molly.”
John nodded. “Right, then. What do you want for lunch?”
Sherlock curled himself into the blankets and sobbed, even as the remnants of the dream filtered away.
“I promise,” John whispered, still stroking her hair. “Yes, I promise. Promise. I promise.” He continued to soothe her, holding her.
Jody Dobrowski was beaten to death by two men who thought he was gay. His body was so badly disfigured that he had to be identified by fingerprints. Both men had attacked another man for being gay before this. He died 15 October 2005.
The door to the flat opened and Mycroft stepped in, adjusting his tie stiffly. “Hello.”
“Jeanette doesn’t have a dog,” Sherlock said.
Evening had fallen when Sherlock appeared in the flat. He took off his scarf and coat gracefully, and John watched him. His heart beat a little harder at the sight of Sherlock, and he told himself it was just nerves from Sherlock’s confession. Luckily, Sherlock appeared to not want to talk about it any more than he had that morning.
John let go of him and turned around. Greg was watching them. So was Donovan, and Anderson. John blushed slightly. He didn’t exactly mean for any of that to happen, much less with an audience. His heart rate picked up slightly. He had just kissed Sherlock. Just kissed another man, in front of people. He clenched his fist.
“Right,” John said, confused. “So what is it?”
John stared at it for a long moment before clearing his throat. “Thank you, Sherlock. It’s perfect.”
“But it’s Christmas. And you deserve everything.” Sherlock looked at him, wide-eyed and earnest. “Merry Christmas, John.”
Saying John’s kiss was surprising would be an understatement. Which is why he wasn’t surprised all that much when John pushed him away.
“What else was I supposed to say?” Sherlock slammed a hand onto the desk, causing Rosie to emit a startled cry. “‘John, I don’t want you to go back to Mary? John, she shot me and it made me start to hate her? John, I miss you and wish things would improve? John, I regret all my bad choices but please don’t leave me for her?’” John’s mouth dropped open, understandably so. Sherlock hadn’t ever snapped like this before. At least not at him. “My point is, John, that you have hurt me so incredibly much. I’ve tried to push it away for your wellbeing, but I can’t keep it inside any longer. I want to forgive you, truly I do. I also don’t want it to seem like I haven’t done anything wrong to you. I have, time and time again. Yet I keep trying to rectify it. You’ve seemed reluctant to even talk about it before today.” Sherlock was speaking quite loudly now. “I don’t know how I can move on from this. I don’t know. I think part of it is that you’re being spectacularly ignorant about how much I care for you.” Perhaps that was giving too much away, but he was too angry to care any more. “I do not care for many people. I care for you. I have always cared for you. I don’t want to do this any more.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, trying to smile and failing miserably. His mouth contorted into an awful shape. “Yes, you did.” He bit his lip, tears pricking at the back of his eyes.
“I love you,” Sherlock said in response.
“Right,” John said. “I’ll just…” He turned and walked upstairs. Sherlock went into his bedroom and closed the door. When he touched his face, he was surprised to feel that it was damp. A horrible feeling pooled in his gut. John was clearly uncomfortable. He didn’t want to be here. Harry was drinking again, so John couldn’t go to her. Sherlock was the only option for him.
“Rosie will have to come, so possibly not...but maybe one night soon we can go out, just the two of us?” Sherlock swallowed nervously. “I’m asking you out now.”
“I don’t have a type,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock glanced at the time. It really was quite late. No wonder Molly had texted. He probably would’ve done the same thing. It was also, as he said, very understandable. John was upset. His posture in his chair was rigid, his hands clenched together. Giving him space didn’t seem to help much, but Sherlock didn’t trust himself not to mess it up further by saying anything else. One thing was certain, though: When Sherlock returned with Rosie, they needed to talk more.
“No.”
Sherlock sat up and ran a hand through his hair. A glance in the mirror showed his eyes to be red and swollen. Strange. He didn’t recall crying, exactly, but then again he didn’t recall much of what he’d been doing before he came to. Wiggins was leaning against the wall, watching him. Sherlock ignored him. “I prepared some more for you,” he said.
He shut off the water and managed to wrap a towel around his waist. He shivered suddenly, in the cool air. He rubbed at his eyes and, oh-those were tears. He let out a despairing sob and leaned the side of his head against the wall. He didn’t care what Mycroft said. He couldn’t live without John. He needed to not be sober or he would quite literally fall apart and crumble to pieces.
“Will you stop losing my brother?”
*****
“Yes, you were! I saw how you looked at her, how you treated her like a puzzle that needed to be solved. The same way you treat your bloody work. And you love your work.” The jealousy thickened with every word that came, unbidden, out of his mouth. He knew that he was being insensitive, that Sherlock had just lost someone, but he was incapable of shutting up.
“I really am sorry to hear about her death,” John said.
John sighed. “You want my potstickers, don’t you.” Damn.
He still didn’t sit up. John sighed and walked over to him. He placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, and when Sherlock immediately sat up, he removed his hand.
Sherlock tightened his grip on John’s hand. “I need you.” It was the most honest he’d allowed himself to be in a long time, and it was absolutely true.
He snuck looks at Sherlock, wide-eyed, sitting there. He was staring at the screen, not even blinking. John saw his thin back rise and fall, rise and fall. The house was burning, burning, burning.
He needed to find Sherlock and...apologize. Or something. And he probably owed him some form of explanation.
“Yes, I’m aware of that.” Lestrade put his hand to his forehead. “I…”
“I don’t know,” he said. “It seemed unimportant. You never mentioned that you knew it, or showed any indication of wanting to know. So I kept it to myself.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “I found her interesting as a case. As for personality, she was fine. I treated her the way I would any other client. Surely you noticed that?”
Sherlock clenched his fingers into the soft material of his bathrobe. “Not my boyfriend, and no, he’s not here.”
“You need Mary.”
“An intervention,” John said slowly, moving away from the doorframe. It was the first thing he had said yet. His voice was quiet and sad, and Sherlock would have hugged him if he could. Wanted to hug him, but he didn’t think he could move from the couch.
John’s face flushed red and then drained of colour. His eyes widened. He gaped at Sherlock in utter shock. “How-how did you know?”
“Why are you here, anyways?” Sherlock spoke to Mrs. Hudson, figuring she’d be the nicest, but it wasn’t her who answered it.
Thank you so much for reading. :)
“For Christ’s sake, Sherlock,” John said, sounding angry now. “I’m not going to bloody sleep.”
She opened her mouth indignantly. “Sherlock Holmes. John is your friend. His wife died. You can’t just sit there!”
In February and March, his shifts switched to people checking up on him once per day.
His shoulders and legs were completely soaked by now, cold water running in rivulets down his back. He checked his mobile again. Almost halfway there. He quickened his pace, ready to be back in his flat. Alone. Without John. He had been living alone for years now, so coming home alone should be fine, but the thought that he would never see John again was nearly too much to bear. Cold seeped through his bones until he thought he’d never be warm again. He sped up even more, as fast as he could through the numbness in his legs. Rain fell into his eyes and blurred his vision, or perhaps it was the tears starting again. A strong gust of wind blew the cigarette out of his fingers. He wasn’t strong enough to hold on. He tried to reach for another, but he couldn’t grasp it. He shoved his hands in his pocket, tucked his head, and started to run. Moments later he stopped. Running would bring him warmth, but he couldn’t seem to get his legs to move properly. He settled for walking at a quick pace, arriving at Baker Street some time later. He checked his mobile. It was late, about eleven.
The problem was that they fit together so perfectly. With John, Sherlock was able to let his guard down a little, become more relaxed. John didn’t judge him. John actually cared, and wasn’t ashamed to be the freak’s friend. John seemed happier when he was around Sherlock, in the beginning at least. His psychosomatic limp disappeared completely. He was doing better. Sherlock could tell that much.
“Sherlock, you’ve been alone.” Lestrade grasped Sherlock’s arm and tugged upwards. He was suddenly too weary to resist. His head swam and pounded, his mind fuzzy. “Come on. I know this is hurting you, but you can’t do this to yourself.”
“We can handle that, John. We’ve handled worse. You moving back in is hardly the biggest challenge we’ve faced.”
John thrashed again. Sherlock carefully reached out and touched a hand to John’s shoulder. John bolted upright with a sharp cry. “It’s okay, you’re safe. I’m here. You’re safe.”
“I did, actually,” John said, and smiled at him.
Sherlock raised his head. John’s gaze was soft. “Yes?”
He got a few nervous glances from the people inside the store, but he ignored them. He found the lighters easily, and went to the register to pick up cigarettes. The checker, a nervous young man (didn’t want to work this late, needed the money for rent for a flat with his girlfriend, no, boyfriend, who had just got out of rehab for-drugs? No, alcohol) looked at him strangely when he approached.
“I prepared one,” Sherlock said softly. “And Mrs. Hudson checked. No poisons or anything.” He tried for a smile.
“Can I…” Sherlock swallowed.
“I’m not sure how to help you. And besides, you’re not fine. You’re obviously not fine, or you wouldn’t be here.” That was logical, and he knew it, and he knew that she knew she was right. He also knew that he didn’t care one bit.
When Angelo cleared his throat from above them, John reluctantly moved away from Sherlock. His eyes were rimmed with tears, his cheeks red. Even after falling apart, John still looked beautiful.
“Oh, well, that’s good-” John stopped talking as soon as his eyes landed on the small package under the tree. “Did you get her something?”
“I know,” Sherlock said, a bit louder this time. Another piece of his heart broke off.
He rocked back and forth, praying it would end.
“What else do you have?”
“You didn’t say no, did you? Oh god, John, you better not have said no.”
Fear and adrenaline pulsed through him, and he screamed for Sherlock. Sherlock couldn’t be dead, he just got there. His gun in his hand, he sprinted into the side alley. Two figures stood in it, one ducking, one pointing a gun. At his voice, the man turned to him and fired. John ducked.
Finally, Sherlock was able to meet John. John was waiting for him, standing by the door and talking to Mrs. Hudson. He turned to Sherlock when he stepped into the room. John’s mouth opened slightly. He swallowed. “You look…”
John’s mouth opened and then closed. “Fine. Then why here?” Sherlock read the true question in everything he wasn’t saying.
The face Sherlock made must have looked more offended than he felt (though he was still offended, of course) because John burst into laughter. He doubled over. Sherlock had to catch his styrofoam container before it fell. “Stop laughing,” he scolded, but John just laughed harder.
“How the fuck am I supposed to believe that?” John stepped into Sherlock’s personal space and looked up at him. His hands were twitching by his sides. Sherlock pressed his lips into a tight line and tried not to think about tilting his head down, grabbing John’s chin and kissing him roughly. Sherlock took a step back instead.
“You’re not my handler, and neither is Lestrade.”
“You…” Sherlock couldn’t say anything else, could only widen his eyes in shock.
“Yes?”
He knew John meant what he said, but a feeling of discomfort spread over him. He never liked being vulnerable. In fact, it was one of his least favourite things. He flushed at the memories of what he’d said. He’d basically admitted to John that he loved him. Though he could probably count on John’s obliviousness not to pick it up, it was still deeply uncomfortable.
“I have a child.”
“No, Sherlock, you didn’t,” John told him when his face was working properly again.
Sherlock watched him leave the room, gazing at the door long after it closed. He had no idea where to go from here. Should he find John? John obviously didn’t try to find him. He sat there, thinking, until Mycroft poked his head back in.
“What’s going on?” Lestrade crossed the room. “Did you use again?”
After that, Sherlock turned back to drugs. Cocaine, morphine. He had been desperate for relief, desperate for a break. Cocaine wiped his mind clean, made him forget about John for some time. Until he came down from his high. He cried after every use now, always, shaking and wondering what he did wrong. Why he felt like this. Why John would never feel the same way. The only clear solution Sherlock found was to extend the times that he was high. John never called him. Nobody else bothered to check on him, so what did it matter if he was high all the time? Yes, there was Janine, who distracted him for a while. The only issue was that when she left, he didn’t have John. Drugs helped. They were the only things he could count on in his life.
He heard John sigh and stand up. “Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“You don’t even know me,” Sherlock said, but he tried to be polite about it.
It wasn’t his best idea, he reflected as he stood in front of the church. It wasn’t even in the realm of good ideas. He hadn’t been invited to the funeral, so logically he shouldn’t be attending the funeral. He was sure no one would be expecting him. But really, when had he ever done what people expected?
Rosie’s present stood out under the tree, all by itself. He felt a flicker of shame that he hadn’t gotten anything for John, but he knew that John hadn’t gotten anything for him either. He waited anxiously for John, sipping at his tea.
“Nope. Not yet,” he said, and leaned forward so John wouldn’t hear as he whispered to the cabbie.
John sighed. “Sit up.” Sherlock did so reluctantly, facing John. “Did I...did I do something to make you relapse? I don’t understand.”
“Now, let’s go get our daughter.”
“Careful,” Wiggins warned. Sherlock scowled again and righted the flask. Wiggins exited the flat. Sherlock didn’t know what he did most of the time, or if he was even in the flat. It made no difference to him whether he was in the flat or not.
“And tomorrow night, maybe we could go on that date you suggested.”
Greg was silent for a long while. “Yeah, sorry, I can’t really help,” he finally said.
Sherlock dashed into a nearby alley, trying to buy himself some more time. The man followed him. Sherlock was cornered between a wall and a dumpster, but he couldn’t quite fit behind it. The man pointed the gun at him again. “Enough with the games, Mr. Holmes. I think both of us want this to be over as soon as possible, don’t we?”
He strolled into the living room and turned on his laptop. Cases. New cases. Were there any? He tapped his fingers impatiently while he waited. “Yes!” He grinned broadly. “Yes, yes, yes!”
“More than,” Sherlock said, and pressed a kiss to John’s hair.
He wished, not for the first time, that he had overdosed and saved everyone the pain of being near him.
“Okay. Fine. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but fine. Just...text if you’re not going to be back in the morning, okay?”
“It’s not your hospital.”
Sherlock unwillingly let go of John’s hand. “Fractured rib, bruised lung, various other surface wounds.”
“Yes, do try.”
“Oh,” John said, confused.
Muttering, Sherlock took a seat at the table. He looked at the map on the wall. “No, no, no,” he said.
Sherlock thought. Every day of every year.
“I’m okay,” Sherlock said. “I-” he hesitated. “I apologise. For making you cancel your plans.” The words sounded foreign coming from him, and John was pretty sure that was the first time he’d ever heard Sherlock apologise.
Angelo soon came back with a menu. “Drinks? As always, Sherlock, everything’s free.”
“That you don’t want to die. It’s lovely when people say it. Quite exhilarating.”
And then he remembered. Sherlock’s stomach plummeted. He saw John. He actually saw John and this time it wasn’t a hallucination. John beat him, kicked him and that was why he was in so much pain. His eyes burned with unshed tears. His body was on fire. He blindly reached out for the small bottle of pills on his nightstand. He tipped one into his hand and brought it to his mouth, swallowing it. Within a few minutes, he was able to breathe mostly painlessly, though it still felt constricted. He rolled out of bed, sure he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep. It was still dark out. The clock on his bedside table read
“I hate to interrupt,” Sherlock said. He could feel the effects of the cocaine beginning to wear off. He needed to be back at Baker Street when that happened. “I have deduced exactly who and how this was done, and sent the details to Scotland Yard. They are sending their least annoying officer. Afternoon.”
“It may provide insight.”
“Never again. You hear me? You can’t run off like that.”
Sherlock scowled at him. “What is your obsession with my relationships?” He took a breath. “No, actually, never mind. Like a friend. Not a girlfriend. Well,” he amended, “
“So you are awake.” John’s face was mixed between exasperation and amusement.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at John’s wording. Our daughter. John, apparently unaware of what he’d said, was already at the door.
up. His best friend, the only person he truly loved, was gone. Hated him. For killing his wife, and now for developing feelings for him. He hit the floor again, pushing himself up. Pain radiated up his arm, and he struggled to push himself to his knees. He clutched at the table.
on the package.
Sherlock shook his head.
He reached up and pressed the hand that wasn’t holding the cigarette to his head, tangling his fingers in his hair. It hurt. He relished the pain. He deserved the pain.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He didn’t elaborate. Only lies had detail, after all. He worked diligently on rearranging his notes.
“John.” John met his eyes. In the dim light, Sherlock saw that they were watery again. “You’re not like your father. Understand? You’re nothing like him. You’re not even close.”
Clara leaned against the wall next to Sherlock. “I’m glad you two finally got together,” she told him. “You deserve that.”
has John's birthday in April. I honestly don't know when it is, but since I'm the author I'm making his birthday in April.
“I couldn’t,” Sherlock said simply.
“Doctor Watson. How is he?”
“Yeah, well, it’s true, isn’t it? You’re fucking gay. That’s not normal.”
“Okay, then. Here we go.” John tangled his fingers in his jumper. “I try so hard every day not to be like him. Sometimes I just-I get so
“It’s nice to be out of the flat, that’s all.”
He was certain of it. Mycroft was certain of it. And John didn’t know.
“Oh?” John’s eyebrows furrowed.
“He’s with me. My house.”
“I love you.”
“What is your business?”
“You have to come with me to pick it up.”
“Oh, dears,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Let me get a picture. Sherlock, your mobile, please.”
An hour before the date, Sherlock paced around the room. He’d kicked John out, making sure John had his clothes before getting extremely nervous. He’d never really had a proper date before, unless you counted Victor from uni, which Sherlock refused to. Not one that both people were certain was actually a date.
It was either play that song, or go over to him, put his arms around him and never let go. The song was the easier option.
The cab pulled up in front of a small, grey building. A rainbow was painted on the glass door. Sherlock paid the cabbie and gestured for Olivia to follow him. Bells tinkled inside when he opened the door. “What is this place?”
He pushed the thoughts out of his head and continued kissing John.
Sherlock Holmes was in love with him.
“You’re not supposed to run, dear,” she said disapprovingly.
Mycroft nodded, scrutinizing him.
“Which is?”
Wiggins sighed and propped his feet up on the back of Sherlock’s chair. “Okay, whatever.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “You must go to rehabilitation.”
“True,” John said. “So, what can I do to make it up to you?”
As soon as Sherlock heard the water start running, he put a recording of his own playing into the radio. He set it to play, and then as quietly as he could, put on his coat and left the house.
“No,” John said. “It allowed me to realize something.”
He couldn’t do it. He was too much of a coward. He coughed out a sob and pointed the gun to the wall, aiming it at the pictures of his face.
John raised his head up and Sherlock made a small noise of alarm. He locked eyes with Sherlock, noting that the light from the fire nearly turned them grey, beautiful. Damn it. They were still standing much too close, Sherlock’s arms wrapped around John’s waist. If the hug was intimate, the eye contact was a thousand times more so. “Merry Christmas, John,” Sherlock whispered to him. John’s head swam, and the next words out of his mouth weren’t even close to planned.
The cab slowed to a stop after a while and the pair leapt out, Wiggins nearly falling over. Sherlock landed with his usual grace, fluidly moving to the other side of the cab and catching Wiggins before he could hit the pavement. The crime scene was partitioned off with tape, and Sherlock strolled forward. The officer in charge stopped him and looked at him warily. “This is a crime scene.”
“You know what I mean.” He shifted to one side.
“I need to know what to do,” he said finally.
John beamed at him. Warmth stirred in the bottom of Sherlock’s stomach. John handed Sherlock one of his bags and then followed him back inside. Their hands brushed several times in the entryway.
He crawled over to the body. It was a young man, late twenties. Stubble dotted his face. The man’s chest was bloody. His clothes had a hole in them. Sherlock slipped on his gloves. He rubbed the soaked fabric between his fingers. The blood crumbled at his fingertips. He gently tore the fabric away from his skin, and looked at the wound. The flesh around it was swollen and red. The blood had dried further away from the wound, but the blood inside was dripping and wet. Sherlock probed it with a finger, and then sat back. He examined the man.
“But what if,” he took a deep breath, “what if I had chosen?”
“I may have been wrong.” Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “Perhaps caring could be an advantage, in certain situations. You and Doctor Watson may be an example of that.” Mycroft released Sherlock’s arm and adjusted his tie, very uncomfortable. Sherlock was too overcome with emotion to speak, but Mycroft seemed to understand. “Congratulations, brother mine.”
Greg dismissed them with a wave, telling them he’d call in the morning. John’s stomach churned the whole ride back to Baker Street. He wanted to hold Sherlock’s hand, wanted to kiss him again, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was wrong. After his father, after the murders…
“You faked your own death!” John’s voice rose until he was shouting. “You let me grieve you for two bloody years! That’s a lie!”
“Okay,” John said slowly.
Hand in hand, they set off down the path, pausing only to throw out their containers. John’s hand fit perfectly in his. The height difference wasn’t even as bad as Sherlock was worried it would be. Sherlock made sure they went in the opposite direction as the aquarium, just to ensure that they definitely would not see it. That would ruin what was otherwise a fantastic date.
“Was there ever any chance?”
“Mr. Holmes, how do you feel?” Sherlock groaned, and then stopped because it hurt. He shook his head. “You have a fractured rib, Mr. Holmes. And a pulmonary contusion. You know what that means?” Sherlock nodded. Fractured rib and a bruise on his lung. Of course he was coughing up blood. “You’re very lucky. It could have punctured your lung completely.” Sherlock coughed again and nearly blacked out from the pain. “We didn’t put you on any pain medication because you weren’t conscious to consent.”
“That was really nice of you,” John said. “To play for Rosie like that.”
Sherlock kissed him after he said this, cupping John’s face with his long fingers. Pausing for breath, John looked up at him, pressing their foreheads together. “In case you were wondering, it’s formal wedding papers,” he said, answering Sherlock’s unasked question. “Something for us to sign. After we’re married.”
“You happened. And I didn’t realize it before. What I’m trying to tell you is, I’m not one hundred percent straight like I thought I was. I wanted to be, but it didn’t really work out. And then there’s you.”
Some time later, after lying in the dark, he heard someone crying. Fake crying, by the sounds of it. And muffled voices. Then, the boot was opened. He blinked in the bright sunlight. Mrs. Hudson and John were staring at him. “Go on, examine him!”
happen? Sherlock cursed himself for not noticing, blaming John’s general presence for being very distracting.
The restaurant was warm and noisy. Fish swam in a tank in the wall. Tropical, multicoloured. Sherlock watched them. A sick feeling came to his stomach, and he thought of the aquarium. The fish tank glowed with a similar blue light. He glanced at John. John’s eyes were fixed on it for a moment, before he tore his gaze away and joined the short line at the counter.
*****
“With Molly.”
Sherlock nodded and knotted his scarf around his neck, pulling on his coat. John flexed his hand, once, and followed him out into the chilly London night. A light mist was falling. Sherlock rubbed his hands together and tucked them into his pockets. He stopped on the stoop, tilting his head back and breathing in the air. It was nice to be out of his flat. He hadn’t realised how bored he had been in there until that moment. Until he was standing outside, John next to him, out in the city. A small smile crossed his face.
Sherlock entered the memory. Himself, wearing a t-shirt in the cool September air. It was nearing the end of lobster season, and he was lucky enough to be able to go. The wind ruffled his curls as the motor gunned. He was told to stand in the cabin of the boat and watch as the sternman hauled and reset the traps. The bright orange of their grundéns contrasted with the brilliant aqua of the ocean.
“Because I love you.” Sherlock clapped a hand over his mouth in horror and shifted away from John, breaking all contact completely. The air was cold in the absence of John’s warmth. He turned away so he didn’t have to see John’s eyes. He knew what he would see.
John laughed. “I’m kidding, Sherlock. Only making conversation. Though,” his eyes roamed over Sherlock, “that’s a nice shirt. Compliments your eyes.”
“When what?” John appeared to watch him expectantly, and Sherlock would be happy to answer his question if he knew what John was actually asking.
“I do,” John said, and his eyes glistened with tears. He was happy, Sherlock deduced, but very emotional. Sherlock himself had to swallow past the lump in his throat. John slid the ring onto Sherlock’s finger. Sherlock relished every moment of contact between them.
“There’s something I want to do,” John said, staring into Sherlock’s eyes. Determination was written all over his face.
“I did. I mean, I tried to. I sort of held him, and then he said that he loved me-”
John put his arms around Sherlock and gently guided Sherlock’s head to his shoulder. He held Sherlock tight, tighter than Sherlock had ever been held before. It was incredibly comforting, and Sherlock would be lying if he said he hadn’t been hoping this would happen someday. But he stayed stiff. “Just forget what I said, okay, John?” He said. Better if they could never, ever talk about it than for Sherlock to lose John completely.
“Caught you doing what?”
“No, she wasn’t,” Sherlock said, the laughter in his chest rumbling against John’s cheek. “I told you that.”
“That was quick,” Sherlock remarked, raising his eyebrows.
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. John’s gaze was firm, steady. He wanted Sherlock to come. Sherlock wasn’t certain he wanted to. It was still awkward between them, and Sherlock needed time to think things over.
“I used to think the world of you,” John admitted. Sherlock’s heart froze over. “You were my best friend. You were the most important person in my life. I would do anything for you. Then you left and something changed.”
John smiled sadly. “I know.” He stood up and walked to the door. “I better get back to her. It was nice seeing you, though.”

will not
“What?”
John grinned. “I’m glad it wasn’t too late. And you actually slept?”
*****
John sighed and settled down in his chair to wait. It was only about one, and his stomach protested at the lack of breakfast and lunch. He stumbled to his feet and managed to make a cup of tea. He pulled out a loaf of bread from the cupboard, and opened the fridge to find something to make a sandwich out of.
“I know.” Sherlock closed his eyes. “What can I do to get forgiveness?”
It was a blanket, pale yellow and fuzzy. He knew it was perfect the second he saw it in the store. It was soft, and thick enough that John could wrap Rosie in it and put her in a pushchair and take her to the park. It had dogs all over it. Sherlock traced one of them with his finger. A red setter, he thought. Very similar to Redbeard.
John’s hands were on his chest, pushing him backwards. Sherlock stumbled, almost falling over. John spun around. Recovering his balance, Sherlock glimpsed him as he ran into the bathroom and slammed the door. Sherlock could only stand there as he heard retching coming from the bathroom. Admittedly, it didn’t go as well as he expected. After recovering from the shock, he opened the drawer in the table and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.
“Once more.”
“Yes?” He cracked an eye open and looked at him inquisitively.
“Mmph,” Sherlock said, and then shut up. Because John was kissing him, again. Sherlock hesitantly put his hand on the back of John’s neck. John splayed his fingers across Sherlock’s face. John’s breath was warm. Sherlock deepened the kiss. He wrapped his other arm around John’s back.
Sherlock glowered at his back as he left the flat.
“It’s okay, Sherlock. It’s okay.”
“Are you okay, dear?” Mrs. Hudson asked her. He clasped his fingers beneath his chin.
John threw up his hands. “Not in the flat.”
He fired again. Another neat hole.
Maybe he should have moved out of the way. Maybe. But he made a vow, and he was going to uphold it to the best of his ability. If he died, so be it. John and Mary would be safe.
First up. They watched Skyfall which is a James Bond movie (Daniel Craig). At the end of the movie, Bond's family home where he grew up burns down. It reminded me of Musgrave which is why I chose that specific Bond movie.
“You see, I can’t have a detective wandering around my hospital. It’s bad for business.”
“Yes,” John said. They lapsed into silence. John was used to silence around Sherlock, but this felt different. More awkward. Usually, Sherlock was content not to talk. This time, John could feel the energy radiating off him. He wanted John to say something. He was also angry. He was waiting. “Why did you leave?”
Alan Turing had died in Maida Vale.
He rubbed his face. John knew. Of course he knew now. Sherlock intended for him to know. What he did not want to happen is John to say that he didn’t feel the same way. Which of course, he didn’t. John was straight, for god’s sake. That was why he had cut him off. He did not want to hear rejection. He couldn’t hear rejection. So better for John to stop talking then for either of them to get hurt. Because it would hurt. It would ache forever. It would ease up for a bit, and then John would do something maddening that would make Sherlock fall for him all over again. It would never stop.
“He does to me.”
A pounding on the door startled him out of his helpless cries. Mrs. Hudson walked in. She halted. “Sherlock Holmes, what are you doing?” He shook his head, his hair flying wildly. She walked over to him and pulled him roughly to his feet. She pried the gun out of his hands. “I don’t know what you were doing with this, but it’s not going to happen.” He glared at her. “You’re not my first smackhead. Now, I need your handcuffs. I know you have them.”
*****
“Turn around, please.”
The five stores they tried were, in fact, sold out of trees, but in the sixth one Sherlock was able to find a small tabletop ash tree. John acquiesced, looking at it and shaking his head. “It’s better than nothing. But it’s still the most ridiculous Christmas tree I’ve ever seen.”
“Anything,” Sherlock wheezed. “Please.”
-room, and there wasn’t much left after that. A few toys, a few books, and that was everything. Rosie was put to bed.
“Then I swear to god, Sherlock, I will chase you down and force you to watch James Bond all evening.”
I've never been high myself. I wrote this based on research I did about cocaine and cocaine highs, plus I took inspiration from The Lying Detective. If I got something wrong or unrealistic, please tell me in the comments. That's not my intention. Nor is it my intention to make light of such a serious subject, and I hope I haven't done that.
“Can I kiss you?” His eyes widened automatically as he realised what he’d said. Sherlock’s mouth fell slightly open for the second time that evening. “Shit, Sherlock, forget I said anything, shit,
“You know what?” John said. “I’m glad Jeanette broke up with me.” Sherlock arched an eyebrow. “Even if you don’t really care about her, it’s good to be with people when you’re grieving.”
not telling me, so how do you expect me to know?”
“I came to investigate a murder,” Sherlock said stiffly. “I would like to do that.”
“Tonight’s Christmas Eve.” John refrained from making a sarcastic comment only due to the hesitation he sensed in Sherlock’s voice. “And you’re not with Jeanette. I understand that people generally want to spend tonight with the ones they love?”
He closed his eyes. His breathing slowed down to something resembling normal. “It’s okay, Sherlock,” John murmured.
When the song ended, Sherlock was quiet. He made no move to pick up more music, nor to stop playing. He opted to stare out the window.
“He left,” Lestrade said. “Mycroft said he’d handle it.” Sherlock nodded, and then stopped when his head protested violently.
“Mrs. Hudson!” He stuck his head out the door. “I’d like some tea, please!”
Sherlock took quick steps away from them as they watched him go in amazement. His hands began to shake. He instructed the cab to take him back to Baker Street as quickly as possible. He barely made it up the stairs and onto the couch before he started shaking. Coming down from the high was unbearable. He usually chased the high with more cocaine, let himself stay in the manic state, but not this time. He needed to feel guilt over what he did. John didn’t like it when he used drugs. John didn’t approve of Sherlock using drugs.
“When you were high.”
Sherlock shook his head and then nodded. A tear slipped down his cheek. His whole body was quivering.
Sherlock had explained.
“No.”
Sherlock smirked at him to let him know it was fine. “I’m just not. John, you might have noticed I don’t hold many people in high regard. Therefore, their opinions don’t matter to me. Besides, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. You said it yourself, remember? It’s fine, it’s all fine?”
All right. Obviously this is up two weeks late and I'm sorry for that. My laptop broke, and then I was going through some things. Maybe the extra-long length makes up for it? I hoped to have this up around Christmas, as it's a Christmas chapter, but that didn't work. It was also originally going to be part of Chapter Eight but since that would've been long I had to cut it. Even this is a little longer than I would've liked, but there wasn't a good place to cut it so here we are. As always, hopefully the next update will be within two weeks, but life happens so I guess I'll just have to see.
Evening came far too quickly for Sherlock to come up with a clever plan to get John away from him so he could sneak out. Thankfully, an answer came in the form of Rosie. She was crying, and John couldn’t figure out for the life of him why.
He pushed open the door to the bathroom and opened the cupboard over the sink. Interesting. Colognes and deodorants of a typically ‘masculine’ scent. He noted Dior especially. Not too cheap, but definitely on the lower end of the price range. In the shower was a shampoo-conditioner set, again typically ‘masculine.’ He narrowed his eyes and spun back to the bedroom. On the pillow was a crumpled flyer. He spread it out and looked at it.
Sherlock dragged himself out of bed when the room grew lighter, back to the chair by the window. He would leave as soon as he could. He would sign himself out, go back to Baker Street, and finally feel the relief of cocaine. Wiggins would surely still be there. He knew Wiggins, and Wiggins wouldn’t leave a place unless he deemed it truly unsafe or uncomfortable.
them.
“What a romantic,” John said, smirking. “I love you too. Obviously.”
“It’s not a choice, Sherlock,” she said firmly. “You told me once that England would fall if I left Baker Street. Well, England is certainly falling with you holed up in this flat.” Tears pricked at his eyelids after she said that, but he wasn’t sure why. “Now, get off your couch and come play Cluedo with me.”
“Yeah, but-”
“Salad drawer,” he choked out.
“Everything okay?”
“This is redundant and pointless,” Sherlock said. “We don’t need to keep discussing whether or not you’re like your father. You evidently believe that you are; I evidently know that that is completely incorrect. Arguing won’t get us anywhere.”
“Look after Rosie,” Mary said, crying. “Promise me.”
“I know that.”
let’s go home.”
“Fine,” Sherlock agreed, even as something inside of him broke. It wasn’t fine. It was far from fine. Sherlock couldn’t do this. He couldn’t pretend that everything was fine. He couldn’t pretend like John had torn him apart. He didn’t know how to do this. It was so far out of his depth. Laughably out of his depth. He went into his room, shutting the door behind him. He blocked out the world and tried to focus on something else, anything else, anything but the emptiness growing in his chest. Sherlock stayed in his room until he was sure John’s shift was over.
“Is he not with you?”
“I said, what’s going on? Even high you’re not usually this spacey.”
His eyes flew open, a horrible thought occurring to him. “John. I need my laptop.”
They separated again, breathing heavily. “I really need to go,” Sherlock said, as gently as he could. John sighed but didn’t argue. Sherlock slowly stepped away and held out his hand.
“Sorry, can’t do that.”
“I’d better not, Molly,” he said. “I should get back to him.”
“There’s been a murder!” Sherlock paced around the small room. He was fairly certain that it wasn’t the same people as earlier. They were serving prison time for aggravated assault, but he knew that many people didn’t accept people like Dylan. Hell, those people probably wouldn’t accept him either-but he didn’t want to think about that right now.
“What?”
“Sherlock, this was the best date I’ve ever been on,” John said, holding him a little tighter.
John Watson was not gay. He was not. John didn’t love men. He couldn’t. Not again. His breath shuddered as he thought of Sherlock’s eyes, those pale blue, shifting to green as he spoke, begging John to listen. Those eyes. As hard as John tried, he never could figure out the color of Sherlock’s eyes. He had been close enough, on a few occasions, to see the speck of brown in his right eye. Damn. He loved Sherlock’s eyes.
“I suppose you’re right,” John said. “And anyways, I’m certainly not wanting to wait another minute. So there’s that.”
Back in the cab, it was silent. John was used to silence, with Sherlock, but this felt different. More awkward. Sherlock’s confession hung over them and John was sure Sherlock was aware of it. Sherlock was perfectly still, gazing out the window. He appeared relaxed, his hands loosely clasped in his lap. His hair wasn’t even messy from bed, and John wondered how exactly his hair could be so perfect all the time. He ached to run his fingers through it. Again. Pull yourself together, John Watson.
he reminded himself.
So Sherlock buried it under everything else they weren’t talking about.
“No, no, there is something to apologize for.” John kept his eyes on Sherlock, even though Sherlock still had his head down. “I treated you horribly.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said firmly.
I know it's late, sorry. I don't know when I'll have the next chapter up. Hopefully soon, but...I may get busy. We'll see. Anyways, it'll be up as soon as possible. Also, John should actually be in the next chapter instead of a vague presence in Sherlock's mind.
“I can go,” Sherlock said. He fought back the way his stomach churned nervously.
“Can I help you?”
“What?” Sherlock was startled at John actually saying something, and his words made no sense.
“Perfect.” Sherlock shut off the light again. He got as close to John as possible before they both fell asleep.
“Then by the power invested in me, I now declare you husband and husband,” Mycroft announced, and it would be difficult to tell whose smile was bigger. “You may now kiss the groom.”
“Right, well.” Wiggins cleared his throat uncomfortably.
“He found you.” Olivia gestured to Sherlock, who waved politely. “Madison, I was so worried.”
He could do that at the park, though. And the bonus would be that he would be with John.
Denial wouldn’t get him anywhere, so he said, “Yes.”
After walking for a few more blocks, he became aware of the fact that his coat was utterly and completely soaked. Ruined. He gripped the fabric tighter, took another breath. The smoke filled his lungs, soothing and familiar. The cigarette was almost burnt out now. He would need to light another one.
“Shut up,” Sherlock said halfheartedly. The documentary was talking about black holes, a subject Sherlock found mildly interesting.
Sherlock thought for a moment.
John looked down at his plate, pushing a piece of egg around with his fork. “She’s fine. Back in rehab. I hope it’ll help this time.” Sherlock nodded. Rehabilitation wasn’t much fun. He hoped Harry would get it together, for John. And for herself. “Anyways,” John said with forced cheerfulness, “I’ll call her sometime soon. Let’s focus on Rosie’s presents right now.”
However, when John had finished what he was doing with the eggs, he set Rosie down on the floor with a bag of blocks (where had he gotten that from?) and took a seat across from Sherlock. Sherlock looked at the swirls of milk in his tea. In his haste to leave the kitchen, he hadn’t mixed it fully. “Sherlock?”
“Get in.”
“Dinner with John. It’s his birthday,” Sherlock told her.
“I’m still very angry.”
Sherlock scowled. “No.”
John laughed at him. “Better, don’t you think?”
John stood up. Sherlock did as well. “You lead,” John said. “I’m not experienced enough.”
“Are these locations important? Historically,  I mean?”
“I’m sorry.” John truly did look apologetic. “That’s why you left, then?”
Sherlock deepened his frown, but didn’t say anything. John’s thumb traced a path down his palm and his lips quirked upwards. Mycroft stepped up to the microphone. Sherlock rolled his eyes. Habit.
“Let’s go, John.” Sherlock took his phone back. John followed him down the stairs.
And John would find out, and that would break Sherlock beyond the point of repair.
He scanned the file until he found what he was looking for.
He clutched at his head as he remembered how it used to be. Coming home with John after cases, laughing in the cabs, talking in front of a fire. Now he had no one. A long walk home, in the chilly drizzle. An empty flat. No fire, no laughter, no talking. Just him, alone. The same way it had been since John got married. Really, since he had faked his death, but he and John and Mary used to sit up late and talk, which, while not ideal, was better than what he was left with now.
“Yes, John?” Sherlock was quiet and he sounded content. John hated to disturb that, but he figured they should do this now as opposed to later.
“Which one is next, now?”
“With who?”
“Sherlock!” And Lestrade was running to him.
“Yes.”
“I don’t want to die.” His voice was pitiful, even to him. Smith placed a hand over Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock’s eyes widened. He thought Smith would kill him with a gun, but suffocation was so much worse. He held his breath, calmed himself. It was an exercise. A breathing exercise. Smith’s hand tightened over his mouth and nose, and Sherlock stiffened. His breath was becoming short, his chest tightening. His lungs burned for air. He began to thrash, weakly, but Smith was stronger and able to hold him down. He started to panic. His head felt light, unfocused.
Someone called out to him, but he didn’t stop. His mind whirled. Mary. John’s face. Mary. John’s face. Mary. John telling him to go.
He cut her off with a wave of his hand. “Not literally,” he snapped. “I made a vow. I told them I would protect them, and then Mary had to go and jump in front of a bullet that was supposed to kill me. Not her. So yes, I killed his wife.”
Another nurse came in some time later, holding a cup of water. “Mr. Holmes?”
“You noticed that?” Sherlock stared at him.
“Not really. Not anymore.”
“I would do anything for you, John.” He winced. Oversharing again.
“I’m going to bed,” John said after some time, startling Sherlock out of his thoughts.
“Surely you can deduce.” When the confusion didn’t leave Sherlock’s face, John decided to take the easy route and explain to him. “Irene.”
Word count: 4,427
“Happy to do it,” John said, and it was only partially a lie. It probably wasn’t great that he was actually happy about spending time with Sherlock while feeling mostly neutral about breaking up with Jeanette. Her words kept echoing through his head.
Sherlock cracked a smile at that. “Want to help?” He motioned to the rest of the room.
“Nothing’s happening.” Sherlock scowled. “Except for you and him being annoying.”
“Starving.” And John followed.
“You two always manage to work it out.”
“But, Sherlock.” John’s face fell a little and Sherlock felt a rush of shame. He didn’t want John to be sad. He wanted to comfort him by holding him, but that was off the table. Not going to happen. So instead he searched for the right thing to say. Some sort of explanation, an apology. Only there wasn’t one. He shouldn’t have done that. He should have told John.
“Don’t you want justice for your son? He was brutally attacked.”
“I care about you. We both do.”
“It’s not. It’s not okay.”
“I’m happy for you, Sherlock, truly.” Mycroft’s dry voice sounded from next to him. Sherlock very purposefully did not look at him.
“Why?”
“You should be,” Sherlock said. His voice was steadier than he felt.
“Not many people do,” Sherlock replied warily.
Not a client. He didn’t respond, and soon enough Wiggins was entering his flat. He flopped over when he heard his footsteps. “Close the door behind you,” Sherlock said. Wiggins complied and took a seat on the table.
“Your ribs, dear. You’re not supposed to do anything other than relax.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, well, best men aren’t supposed to be in love with the groom either.”
Sherlock frowned. “But where else will I put it?”
Sherlock stopped playing and held the violin at his side. “It is something I wrote,” Sherlock replied. “It is called ‘Rosie’s Sonata.’ When she is old enough, I will teach her to play it.”
He paid and stood up, Rosie clinging to his jumper. The walk back to Baker Street was quite quiet, Rosie having sleepily laid her head on his shoulder. He didn’t know what Sherlock would be doing when he got back. Hell, he didn’t even know if Sherlock would be there. Fear gripped at his heart again. He truly was treating Sherlock terribly. First he hurt him for years with his obliviousness, then led him on. It was a miracle Sherlock had even exchanged words with him that morning. Then of course he had to go and piss Sherlock off even more.
Molly was the one to answer it. He furrowed his eyebrows, blinking at her. There were dark circles under her eyes. Rosie was in her arms. It was evident that she’d been crying. “Hi,” she said quietly. He pursed his lips and nodded, suddenly finding it very difficult to speak. He hadn’t prepared for this outcome.
“Love you,” John mumbled. “I’m going to keep telling you that.”
*****
Mycroft exhaled slowly. “I’ll tell Mummy to call you later, then.”
“No. She can’t-she can’t know,” Sherlock said, looking around wildly. “She’ll tell Mycroft and he’ll take me away.” Mrs. Hudson sighed, but complied and took him to the A&E. The attendant on duty looked at him. Through a haze of pain, he explained what had happened, before his vision spun and blackened and he collapsed.
“You’re worse than Moriarty.”
“Okay.” Rosie had quieted down. The three of them sat in silence. Outside, car horns sounded, there was laughter, noise. A perfect contrast to the quietness of 221B.
In his own room, he sat on the edge of the bed and buried his face in his hands. That night had been...a lot. Not necessarily in a bad way, he thought, but it was overwhelming. So John still was angry at him for faking his suicide. That wasn’t too much of a surprise, but he had been hoping he wasn’t.
“It was me.”
“Is this all right?” John’s voice was low in his ear.
“Something wrong?”
He heard the gentle unfolding of paper and cracked his eyes open. John was standing at the music stand, staring at the paper in his hand. A slight smile crossed his face, and then it fell. His mouth turned down slightly and his eyes darkened. Sherlock hated that expression. It was a combination of pity and sadness. He closed his eyes again, but could still see John’s face.
“I-yes, I should have, but-”
“Okay.”
“It’s okay, Sherlock,” John said softly. “I’ve lost many people. In the Army. It’s not an easy thing to go through.”
“Why? God, Sherlock, I don’t know why. Maybe because I cancelled my plans to be with you.” His voice came out harsher than he’d intended. “Girlfriends don’t typically like when you cancel on them to spend time with your flatmate.”
He made it all the way down the hall to his bedroom, pulling his bathrobe and pyjamas out of the closet. He then walked slowly into the bathroom. He fumbled with his coat and suit, pulling them off and dropping them to the floor. The faucet emitted a warm, pleasant spray when he turned it on. It burned when he stepped under it, and the pain made him arch his back and hiss. The chill inside him mixing with the hot water was less than ideal. It would have to do.
“You’ve only been here a day.” The receptionist looked at him through tired, bleary eyes.
“I think we’re even now, okay?”
comforting, safe. Sherlock stood frozen for a moment, then unfroze and gently placed his hands on John’s hips.
He stood up slowly, stretching. He took a few hesitant steps. This was good, this was very good. He paced around the small flat, feeling very confined. He ached to go outside.
“I can’t trust you, Sherlock. That’s why I’m here. Because I can’t trust you.” John took a deep breath and growled out the next words. “I can’t fucking trust you, and so I can’t sleep, because when I wake up you could be God knows where. Strung out in some drug den, probably.”
caught in his throat and he wondered if Sherlock would pick up on that. Luckily, Sherlock just smiled and nodded.
Sherlock didn’t do relationships. He didn’t care about people. He had never cared for someone as much as he cared for John Watson. Magnussen pointed out that John was Sherlock’s pressure point. He had been right. Sherlock would do anything for John. He took brisk steps away from John, letting John do what he wanted with the information.
John raised his eyebrows. “So you are a romantic.”
“Labels are a social construct that should only be used by the person being labelled.”
“Mary shot you. What kind of friend would I be to allow that?”
-and he almost didn’t realise he’d arrived. He instructed the driver to wait while he got Rosie.
“Don’t say that. Please, don’t say that.” John gripped Sherlock’s hand tightly. Sherlock was stunned. John was touching him. Again. Yes, Sherlock initiated the contact both times, but John was reciprocating.
“Is that really what you think?” John’s heart plummeted. He had just come to realize that he wanted Sherlock, and now Sherlock might think it was all a mistake?
“You’re such a prick.”
*****
Sherlock didn’t sleep much that night. He tried for a few hours, drifting in and out of consciousness, but gave up at around three. A strip of light from the street outside filtered in around his curtains. Sherlock lay still, listening to the sounds of London. He heard a shout, once, twice. A taxi rumbled its way underneath his window. Eventually he gave up completely and slipped out of bed. He opened the curtain and then the window, looking down into the alley. The cold air hit his face and he shivered, relishing in the cold. It was refreshing. It reminded him of when he was younger, looking out at the snow around his house. There wasn’t any snow here. He breathed in deeply. The ashtray on his windowsill had an old cigarette in it. It was too burnt to smoke. John wouldn’t approve if he found it there. So Sherlock tipped the ashes out the window. They floated down into the alley. He set the tray back onto his window. He felt peaceful. It was very early Christmas morning and John was sleeping somewhere above him with his infant daughter.
“Of...her?”
He flipped over and cracked an eye open. “No, thank you.”
“Would you like to go get lunch and then go shopping so we can renovate the upstairs bedroom?” He said instead.
“I did it. The roof. I did it.”
“You were-are-very attractive.”
“Rosie probably needs to go to bed,” Sherlock said presently.
before turning and vomiting into the drain. His feet and ankles got splashed, and he sighed. He retched a few more times until nothing more came out, and then washed the vomit down the drain. Sherlock didn’t have the energy to clean himself, so he stood under the spray and let the water wash away the grime. He closed his eyes and leaned against the wall and missed John terribly.
It was an unavoidable fact that John was only here because Mycroft was paying him.
She narrowed her eyes. “No. We haven’t ‘just met up’ in years, John.”
“Sherlock?”
“You sure you want to be here?” Sherlock jumped at the familiar voice. No. No. He couldn’t be here, not right now. He couldn’t see Sherlock, not like this. A hand roughly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around. Dark blue eyes met his. His face was contorted, scowling. Angry.
“Then why are you still talking?” Sherlock shifted, pulled his wrist away.

“Then why am I here?”
*****
“What do all these places have in common? John, you may have solved it. Maybe you’re not so much of an idiot after all.” Sherlock closed his eyes and fell back on the couch, very still, his hands steepled beneath his chin.
Sherlock grabbed at his hair again. It was difficult to tell whether the wetness that seemed to be falling down his cheeks was from tears or from the shower. He twisted his hands into his curls, feeling a burn. He had been
*****
“You’re obviously feeling guilt right now,” she said, “and you’re grieving. It’s perfectly natural.”
“It is.”
“You’ve never met him.”
He closed his eyes for as long as he dared, trying to compose his expression. His phone buzzed then, and he reached for it, fingers stiff from cold.
“I’m going to Regent’s Park with Rosie. Joining?”
“Yes? And?” Harry squinted at him. “You do realize I’m a lesbian?”
“I know you have to be lying down, I was just waiting for you because I thought it would be impolite if I was in bed and I didn’t want to be impolite-”
Sherlock took a deep breath, but kept his fingers splayed on John’s hips, holding him close. “Are you sure you’re not-I mean, is this-” he stuttered, seemingly unable to voice what he was thinking. “Do you actually-or is it just a way to get over-” he shut his mouth instantly, leaving John no less confused.
Sherlock found it ridiculous that John was doing this, but at the same time he felt rather touched.
“No, it’s not, and you know it,” John said disapprovingly.
His own funeral had been...fine. He had attended, of course, slipped in the back and stood in the shadows. Mycroft had recommended against it, but he assured Mycroft he would be careful. And he had been.
“It’s a night shift, Mrs. Hudson,” John said. “I don’t want to impose.”
“In your room. Bed. Fuck, I don’t know.” Heat rose in his cheeks as he met Sherlock’s eyes.
“I…yes. Sherlock. I do. And I should’ve said it earlier. It’s true. It’s always been true.”
“Sherlock,” John said, haltingly.
Sherlock sighed, preparing for the answer he’d given so many times. “Not necessarily. The definition of asexual is feeling no sexual
April also was John’s birthday.
“Hello,” John said blearily. “What do you want to watch?”
“No-Sherlock-I can’t move-”
“You can’t,” Sherlock said, and flopped back onto the couch.
“What did he want this time?”
Sherlock’s heart did a weird combination of plummeting and soaring at the same time. It wasn’t a date, but John liked his shirt? He swallowed and wiped his palms on his trousers. “Thank you. You do as well. Look nice, I mean.” He didn’t meet John’s eyes.
A dark shadow jumped in front of him. He couldn’t move, frozen, waiting for the bullet that never hit.
*****
Sherlock laughed. “I was.” He kissed John. “Bed?”
“If you would like to book another session,” she started to say, but he was gone.
“I have news, little brother,” said Mycroft. He sat down on the couch. “You’ve been cleared.”
“He needs to go home,” Wiggins said.
“Yeah, fine,” John said. He hung his coat up on the peg and joined Sherlock at the table. “You cleaned.”
“Oh,” she said. “Is that why this happened?”
The door to his room opened. Light from the hallway streamed in. John stood in the doorway. “You all right? I heard something.”
“I-” John opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock wouldn’t let him. It was evident as to what John would say. I’m sorry, Sherlock, I don’t feel that way about you. Because how could he? John was perfect, John was everything, and Sherlock was nothing. Yes, he was more intelligent than most people, but beyond that? He had been informed, by many, that he didn’t even have a heart. Sherlock breathed deeply before starting to speak.
“Yes, exactly. You see, I was correct.”

“Maybe someday,” Sherlock said. “I don’t know yet.”
“You’re in my chair,” Sherlock said quietly. His voice was raspier than he’d expected, but a pulmonary contusion was bound to cause some issues.
“Sherlock?”
Smith hummed noncommittally. “That’s a compliment.”
“Yeah. You were having a nightmare, I think. Muttering things.”
So he didn’t.
“Fine,” he managed. “Just...reorganising. My mind palace. While I waited.” He tried not to inflict any venom into his voice, but John still flinched slightly.
“That would be lovely,” John said. His eyes flickered over to the table by the window. Sherlock noted it to be empty. But before John could say anything, Angelo was leading them over to a table in the corner.
“No.”
“What did you call me here for?”
Thank you to everyone who's read this. This was my first fic, and I'm happy with the way it turned out. It's weird to think that it's over, but John and Sherlock got the happy ending they deserved.
Sherlock needed John.
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He just kept looking at the body. It was John, and yet not. John’s skin was much paler than usual, already starting to retract. Dehydration.
“Yeah, because I didn’t tell you. Seriously, Harry.” He closed his eyes. “I’m fucked.”
“What are we making,” John corrected him. “You’re going to make some toast.” Sherlock rolled his eyes but obligingly took the bread that was handed to him. “And I’m going to cut up some fruit.”
Thank you for reading :)
“That’s not a reflection on you,” Sherlock said, and his mouth twisted downwards.
Sherlock placed his dishes in the sink, John following shortly afterwards. Rosie was settled firmly on the couch, John next to her. “Can you get me her gift? It’s on my bed.”
That night had been the first time Sherlock truly allowed himself to cry over John. The first time he was selfish enough to miss him. John was there, he hadn’t really gone anywhere, and Sherlock missed him. The next morning, when he woke up, he decided that it really was the end of an era. He needed to move on. And so he did.
“Hey,” John said awkwardly.
“Well, now you do.” He kissed Sherlock briefly again.
“You’re not listening to me,” John told him. “I want to talk about it.”
“Putting that aside,” Sherlock said, even while knowing that they would revisit it later, “You’re not your father.”
Sherlock crossed the room and picked up his violin. It was crucial that he played, that Lestrade left. Otherwise Sherlock might start asking him about John. And then Lestrade might start to suspect, or worse, say something indiscreet to John himself. So. Yes. Lestrade needed to leave.
“I’m not in love with him!” The words burst out of his mouth. His hands were sweaty and shaking. “I’m not. No.” But Molly kept looking at him, kept looking at him with pity, and he hated her. “What would you know, anyways? He’s my best friend. He was my best friend, and now he hates me. So even if I was,” he paused and took a breath, “it wouldn’t matter.”
“Really?” When Sherlock nodded, John continued, “then I’m going to be the best one there is.”
He had to make sure John was okay. He just saw him, yes, but the funeral was over. Besides Rosie, John had no reason to stay alive. Rosie was a compelling reason, of that Sherlock was certain, but death did strange things to people. Death caused John to marry an assassin.
“I’m an advertiser,” Smith said. “Children’s cereal. Maybe you’ve seen it. Cereal killer? Get it?”
“Thank you for letting me stay.” His voice was unusually soft.
“Did I…?” The unspoken question hung in the air between them.
“For gods’ sake, Sherlock!” John threw up his hands in anger. “Will you stop making things so bloody difficult?”
Sherlock was leaning against the railing, looking at the Thames.  The wind ruffled his dark hair, and John felt a tug at the pit of his stomach. He wished he could run his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. It had been so soft last night. Sherlock’s coat hung around him as usual.
“All the speeches are over. You can go inspect the body now.”
“You should go to sleep, John,” Sherlock said gently.
The morning of the wedding dawned bright. Sherlock awoke in their rented house, sun streaming through the window. John’s arm was flung across his chest, John himself fast asleep. Sherlock couldn’t help but study John, watching him sleep. The morning of their wedding day.
“Can you hold her while I finish this?”
“Next time, just bring her here,” Mrs. Hudson told him. “I’ll look after her.”
And when Sherlock woke up, heart pounding, sweating, hands clenched around his blankets, he had the feeling he wouldn’t be seeing John Watson for a very long time.
“No. I’m sorry.” Sherlock didn’t respond. John walked over and handed him a cup of tea. He took it, but did not drink. John sat next to him on the couch. Sherlock moved further away. “I guess we should talk.”
“I want what’s best for you.”
Earlier that day, somewhere in Eastern Europe, a fatal bullet ripped a hole in Sherlock Holmes. As blood blossomed across his chest, John Watson was the last thing that crossed his mind.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “As if I would
John stood up from the table as she smiled at him. All he managed to say was, “I am not gay.” As he left the kitchen to go back upstairs, to his flat, where his daughter and flatmate-who-was-in-love-with-him were waiting, he wondered just how true that statement was.
“I’ll pay.”
“John. Listen to me. You made a terrible mistake. But beating yourself up about it isn’t going to help either of us. It’s just going to make you feel bad.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “Brilliant!”
“Will you stop being so difficult?” John didn’t mean for the words to come out quite that way, but Sherlock immediately shut up. Shame flushed through him. “Sorry.” Sherlock waved for him to continue. “When I was seventeen, my dad caught me.” He looked at Sherlock, prompted for him to deduce. When Sherlock said nothing, he continued. “It was...with my friend. My best friend, at the time, actually. His name was-is?-Christopher.”
“All right, all right. Any particular table?”
He had too many unanswered emails to read all of them, but one in particular caught his attention. It was from Olivia MacDonald, the same woman he had helped out earlier. Simply to satisfy his curiosity he opened it.
“Did you touch his chair? He was here, sitting in it, just a minute ago,” Sherlock demanded. He glared at Lestrade.
Taking a deep breath, he ducked out from under the awning. The rain pounded down. His coat would soon be soaked through. Taking quick steps, he set off towards Baker Street. The cigarette helped calm his body, but his mind was active as ever. He almost regretted not taking a cab, not because of the rain, but because the walk home gave him endless time to think about John. He was certain he would never be able to delete that expression on John’s face, not ever. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t. He couldn’t. He had to keep it, had to remind himself of all the ways he had failed in keeping John and Mary safe.
“All right. All right.”

The first time he and John shared a bed, Sherlock had laid awake next to him, not touching, barely breathing. He had tried to make his room presentable and make sure the blankets weren’t burned with holes and that his room didn’t have any chemicals that could possibly be detrimental to John’s health. Sherlock had been completely still, on his side, eyes half-opened and watching John. John, in turn, half-asleep but very much aware of what he was doing, flung an arm around Sherlock, pulling him closer. Sherlock immediately relaxed into his touch, wrapping his own arm around John.
“Goodnight, John.”
“That’s not true.”
She smiled sympathetically. “I don’t think so, Mr. Holmes. Don’t worry, though. We’ll get you fixed up in no time. Now, would you like a shower?”
Sherlock marvelled at the fact he was holding John. Conditions were less than ideal, yes, but he was
He met Lestrade in front of the hospital. Donovan and Anderson were with him. “Hey, freak,” Donovan called to him as he entered the hospital. He flipped her off.
“You’re tired.”
Wiggins raised an eyebrow.
He was a freak, a psychopath. Of course everyone hated him. He was rude. Arrogant. Mean.
“Of course I did. He’s my best friend. I told him that as well.” John really didn’t know what he had done wrong. Of course he loved Sherlock. Of course Sherlock was his best friend. He just didn’t see why that would upset him.
“Why are we here?” He gestured around the room. “You hate going out in public unless it’s to solve crimes. You hate this restaurant.”
Sherlock parted his lips and John did the same, deepening the kiss. This was good. This was very good. Sherlock tightened his grip on John’s back.
“I think so. Can you?”
“Have I?” He was completely unperturbed. If John wanted the couch, John would just ask him to move. And he would.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this-fuck,” John said, his heart beating quickly, nervously. “Would you like me to stay with you tonight?”
“What? Why?” He stopped walking and turned to Wiggins, suspicious.
He had actually been happy, and somehow he had let that slip away from him.
Sherlock choked on the next inhalation of smoke and glared at his cigarette. The rain was beginning to seep through his coat, dampening his shoulders. He shivered. He couldn’t bring himself to care. Checking his mobile, he saw that he had a little less than an hour’s walk left. He sighed and took another drag.
*****
I cannot stress this enough - the motivating factor for murders is homophobia. DO NOT READ IF THIS IS A TRIGGER.
“Fight.” Same, quiet voice, so unlike his usual.
He reached the Westminster Bridge quickly. He collapsed against the railing in the middle of the bridge, another scream ripping out of him. Nobody else was around to hear it. The clock tower was lit up, hazy but visible through the worsening rain. He panted and sobbed, looking down at the dark river.
John shook his head, letting out a derisive laugh. “I’m leaving. And I’m taking Rosie.”
As he turned and walked to his room, he thought he could hear Sherlock whispering goodnight.
“It wasn’t real.” Sherlock shook his head, tears suddenly threatening to fall. “It was in my head.”
“Christ,” John said, sighing. “I guess I couldn’t hide it from you forever.”
Sherlock didn’t respond. John got himself a cup, and sat down opposite Sherlock.
“Can I ask you something?”
“Sherlock.”
“Oh, go away, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, anger bubbling in his stomach. So what if he might kill himself? So what? It didn’t matter anymore. Nothing mattered anymore.
After their fifth game ended in Sherlock flipping the board over exclaiming that he
“All right,” he said instead.
“If you are trying to get me to join, I already told you: I’m not going.”
Breakfast consisted mostly of Sherlock drinking tea and John trying to get him to eat something. Sherlock refused, noting how John didn’t press him too hard. John’s hand shook slightly on his teacup. Nervous.
“You don’t know that.”
“Let’s get you to bed.” Lestrade wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and helped him to stand up. He guided him to his room, laying him gently on his bed. Sherlock curled under the blankets. The hollowness had increased. Lestrade closed the door. “I’ll be outside when you wake up. Then we talk.”
“Stay out of it,” Sherlock repeated. “I don’t care that you’re my brother. I don’t want you involved.”
*****
He awoke to sunlight blinding him, not feeling even a little bit rested. He rolled over in bed, his mouth tasting of sandpaper. His head ached, though he was grateful it wasn’t as bad as the previous day. He stumbled out of bed and to the shower. It felt good to properly shower and not just stand under the water.
“A cup of tea would be lovely. Thank you.” He climbed the stairs, not looking back.
Once the bread was cooking, Sherlock was hit by a thought. John stood there and watched him play for a few rounds of the song. He had
“I’m not gay.”
He quickly showered and then dried his hair, making sure his curls were perfect. Wrapping a towel around his waist, he went back into the bedroom to pick out an outfit. A maroon shirt, black suit jacket and black trousers. No tie. Sherlock got dressed, smoothing out any folds and making sure he looked crisp and controlled. He looked at the time. Thirteen minutes to go. He had suggested to John that they arrive separately, to make it look like more of a date, but John told him to meet him in the sitting room instead. Sherlock frantically wondered if he should’ve gotten John flowers, or something, but John didn’t seem like the flower type and Sherlock hadn’t had a chance to get John anything since they spent a lovely day watching telly and later taking a walk with Rosie.
Sherlock effectively shut him up by ducking his head and touching his lips to John’s. His hands came up to cup John’s cheeks. His lips were warm and soft. Their noses bumped a few times before they finally figured out the placement. John trailed his hand up to Sherlock’s hair, and he dimly registered how nice it felt to tangle his fingers in his curls before he stopped thinking altogether.
John awkwardly cleared his throat. “I need to call a cab.” Sherlock made a noise of agreement. “I’ll see you sometime, okay?”
“Was this acceptable?”
made Sherlock feel like he was being ripped in two, but he couldn’t just throw them away. He ran string from the fireplace to the couch and pinned the notes to it. He tried to arrange them in chronological order, a progress of their relationship. Various bits and papers were also added to the string, save for the newspaper clippings. He stuck those to the wall.
She laughed humorlessly. “Thank you. It’s hard. But I’m managing.”
“I know you don’t.” Mycroft sighed over the phone. “What I’m trying to tell you is that John and Rosie will be spending Christmas with you.”
John said fondly. Sherlock smirked at him, and John kissed the smirk away. “Yes, I’ll be your boyfriend. If you’ll be mine.”
Sherlock nodded slowly. John looked incredibly sad. His entire face fell. “It’s not your fault. I’ve never been good at working through emotion, John. The drugs were a way for me to escape reality. You hated me, or you were married to someone else, and I was too much of a coward to face that.”
“He’s high, John.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at that. It was irrelevant, it didn’t matter. John didn’t care.
“It doesn’t matter,” Sherlock snapped. “Nothing matters.”
Tears pricked at the back of Sherlock’s eyes. “John.”
“I had Mycroft ensure it.”
“Thanks for looking after her.” Molly handed Rosie over to Sherlock. He smiled wider at the sight of her nestled in his arms. She was quiet and still mostly asleep, but blinked up at him when he adjusted her.
“About what you said yesterday…”
“I’ll be down in a minute,” he called over his shoulder as he made his way up the stairs.
Disappointment flared once, quickly, then dissipated into nothing. Numb, hollow nothing. He wasn’t surprised, of course, and berated himself for even daring to think it might be John. John didn’t want anything to do with him. Of course he didn’t. Sherlock killed his wife. Suddenly, all he wanted was to curl up in his chair by the fire, John opposite. He hit his thigh with a closed fist, once again relishing the pain.
“Maybe she’s tired,” Sherlock suggested helpfully.
“I’m surprised you didn’t deduce this,” John said. “What with your ‘science of deduction’ or whatever.”
He spent the rest of the day solving cases right in his sitting room. The most interesting one only took him an hour to solve. Altogether it was mindless work, but he was happy to be back solving cases. He was so immersed in his work that he didn’t notice the time slipping by until it was dark out. He didn’t eat, didn’t move from the chair. He didn’t notice when he started to come down until one of the cases sent him completely over the edge. He was usually vulnerable after the cocaine wore away, but this time seemed worse than usual. The case itself was simple, aside from the astonishingly poor writing style. It was an easy case to solve, one that should only have taken him five minutes, but he couldn’t do it. Words jumped out at him from the email.
“If you had, would it have changed anything?”
“Sherlock.”
Their kisses were always at home, sometimes under the watchful gaze of Rosie, sometimes lazily on the couch, sometimes in front of the fireplace. John had moved his things down to Sherlock’s room.
John finally glanced around the flat. “Thank you,” he muttered grudgingly. He still wouldn’t meet Sherlock’s eyes. This visit was not getting off to a good start.
“I’m not your housekeeper.” She frowned, but by the time Lestrade arrived she had made them tea.
“Great,” John said, and intertwined their fingers. Sherlock gripped his hand tightly. His skin was slightly rough and very warm. Their fingers slotted together perfectly. John traced a pattern on the back of Sherlock’s hand with his thumb. “I’ll meet you in a moment. Let me get ready.” Sherlock leaned down and kissed him, then released their hands.
They woke up wrapped around each other. John was using Sherlock’s chest as a pillow and Sherlock had his fingers in John’s hair. Sherlock knew, or rather felt, that John was awake. He smiled at the thought of John lying there, just enjoying his company.
“First things first. I am perfectly capable of, you know-” he paused, “-getting myself off, Sherlock. That wouldn’t bother me at all.” He smiled, and then they both laughed. “And second, you’re not broken. You’re the best person I’ve ever known, and I could never see you as anything else.”
His dreams that night were haunting, strange. Blue light, rain washing away blood. A feeling of being pulled under, getting high again, no one there to save him. And the sound. The awful, terrible sound John had made.
“Her...girlfriend?”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, trying to regain his composure. Why did he wait so long? Why? They could’ve been happy, they could’ve been together, they could’ve been married. He let out a shaky breath. “Why didn’t we talk about this...earlier?”
think about John. Just as he had for the past month, he craved cocaine. The relief, the washing away of everything. To be able to forget about everything that had happened and be able to just stop. Stop his brain. Stop
“Seriously, please, just find him.”
“No. Baker Street.” Sherlock stood up abruptly and walked away. He climbed inside the first cab he could see. He told Lestrade to get their personal files and to meet him and John at their flat. John sat in the back next to him.
