Anael leaves them at the entrance to serve as a sentinel for them while they deal with John and Michael and Dean go into the area the cameras don’t cover. It’s a wonder that Warden Roman hasn’t done anything about the blind spots, thought Dean’s pretty sure that Roman doesn’t give a fuck.
But then there in the lake, a stream of brown hair breaks through the water, dripping at the ends. Meg slows her pace.
"What the hell are you talking about?" Dean shouts, trying to get back to Benny's side. "Benny, what the fuck? Come on!"
Crowley gives him a look, the kind where he's calling you ridiculous without even having to one his mouth, but he catches himself. Maybe he's intuitive enough to know Dean's being dead serious and a snarky comment would deprive him of the answer he wants to hear. Either way, Crowley answers, "My mother knows when to keep her mouth shut. And she didn't have to. I've been friends with Wings for years. I know what he's like. I know what he likes. He's not exactly Mr Subtle."
Granted, they’re still there for work but at least it’s not as bad as Fashion Week. Cas won’t be as stressed out and Dean can actually help with business more this time. Plus the fact that Cas has spent the last couple of months weening himself off of smokes — he still drinks from time to time but a lot lesser than before and Dean can’t be more proud. Kelly Kline said he could call her to arrange a video call appointment if Cas wanted one during their Paris trip.
Dean's in a good position right now, as far as the plan goes. After talking it out with Cas the evening before, Dean had decided to throw all his energy and concern into getting himself, Gabriel and Crowley out either today or tomorrow and that everything else would be a problem for another day. His relationship with his brothers, the dues he has to pay, the tracks he will have to cover. He'll handle them at another time.
Sam grumbles into his coffee, running a hand through his hair. He realises, displeased, that his fingers are shaking against his cup and that that detail comes with the belated thought that he has not slept for the past twenty-four hours. He can't shake the way Kansas paused for a few seconds too long after he said his name. Did he know Kansas? Or was it just a coincidence? It could be that the line was lagging. It's analogue, they couldn't trace where the phone call was coming from.
“Awesome! We should have lunch together later. My office is at level 8 but I’ll come up to meet you,” Charlie invites. “Me, Kev and Balthazar eat together most days. Sometimes Pam, Meg and Missouri join us.”
." Sam gives John the harshest glare he has in his arsenal, folding his arms and looking away. His jaw clenches with unspoken anger.
Since Dean was taken off of his legal death since the police’s discovery that he’s actually alive during the last heist, Dean had gone by his Italian name instead for the mission, Dino De Luca. Granted, the only Italian words Dean knows is
“Can we just forget tonight ever happened?” Castiel asks, partially nervous. "And would you stay the night again?"
They stay in the area, ears pricked for any audible sign that they were close to finding them in the safes. They were likely checking the fake escape that got abandoned first anyway.
He slides down the wall and drags in a breath, trying to forget about the baggie in his pocket and where he is.
Things with Pax are slow, mostly because Dean doesn’t want them to go fast, but apparently Pax is cool with it so there’s no bad energy between them. Dean isn’t really sure if Cas knows about them or not. He hasn’t said anything about Pax but he’s a lot more steely of late. Why would it even matter to him anyway? It's not like Cas likes him back. Plus, maybe it’s because the Met Gala is happening very soon and he’s stressed once more.
Dean gives him an easy smile, like a bold stroke of gold on a sea of silver. So many good souls in the room but Dean was the most precious to him.
, Adam," Mick quickly says, rushing to Adam's side to try and calm him down before he goes into full panic. "Come on, in and out with me." He inhales and exhales, getting Adam to copy him. While it works a little, his eyes are still wide and afraid. "Adam, are you alright?"
Now, Toni finally starts looking a little concerned. "If you kill me, they’ll kill all of you. You'll lose."
night. He wanted Dad to come home, and he had a list and everything, you know, of what he wanted to do with Dad when he got reunited with him. It’s got shit like learn how to drive or how to ride a bike and all that because he doesn’t have a single memory with him. He was too young to remember anything when Dad left us. We thought he wouldn’t do this to us willingly. We thought the worst, that maybe he died.”
Adam glares up at him. "You shoved me to the ground and punched me because I said you were hurting me."
"I'm fine," Cas lies. Detroit and Meg don't believe him but move forward -- they didn't have time. They had to find the shooter before they got another one.
“Dean! Oh my God, I can’t breathe, I’m so excited!” Charlie practically squeals from the other end. “You and Castiel are close, can you please ask him if he’ll let us party at work tomorrow? Please, please, please.”
Zachariah answers, annoyed, "All the cameras have been taken down, there's no camera signal or radio signal coming from them. We're blind out here."
"One and a half?" Salem suggests with her mouth full of sandwich. Paris narrows her eyes at her, mouthing at her to chew.
"Cas will be getting paid big time, and Leviathan has to say the collection isn't official, take it back," Sam lists. "Cas won."
"Yep. This one was just in memory of our friends from the first heist, that's all. After this, we're done. At least, Angeles and I are," Dean says. "Thanks for your help, Mick. You're a good man."
"Fuck, he has a photoshoot with her today," Dean curses. This is obviously more important than a bunch of stilettos so Dean sits back down at his desk. "Alright, we can stop them. What do they plan to do?"
Sam starts crying and brings Dean into a tight hug - Thank you for protecting me my whole life. I’m gonna miss you.
The vision of a wooden crucifix nailed on the wall swims in a haze of searing agony and indescribable horror. Someone's arms are around the body, holding it up but clearly, it's becoming more of dead weight with every second passing.
Cas reaches work at 9:30 as always and he places a coffee cup down on Dean’s desk. It surprises him — he hadn’t expected Cas to get him coffee. Dean looks up from his computer, absently taking it. “Thanks, Cas.”
Cas nods and walks off to a corner with Dean. Once nobody else can hear them, lost in their own conversations, Cas asks, "Are you really leaving Adam there?"
, Cas. And if getting caught means you and my family get to go free then I’m doing it, no question.”
"No, because that's unprofessional and he could fire me if he's not in a good mood," Dean replies, sitting down across from Sam and Eileen. "Plus, it's just a stupid crush. It'll be gone in like, a week."
Sam bustles through the front door, scoffing in disbelief when he sees that the doorknob has been stained with sticky beer residue. He calls out, shutting the door behind him, "Jess! Where are you?"
Sam shrugs, frowning, “I said no but he kept asking. I told him I was coming here to get us drinks but I have no idea what to do with this guy. I told him I was taken and that I don’t like guys that way, you know? But here I am.”
they say no. On my way out, they'll probably let me talk to Jess. I heard she pretended to be my girlfriend to be my alibi of sorts. She will help you escape with Mick's help, just wait for my signal. I'll go back in with a bug and provide the distraction you'll need to run away."
Dad's fucked me up royally, man. They always say your parents are the ones who you trust the most, and who love you the most. I think my dad loves me, but he doesn't like me. If you're confused, let me tell you that there's a difference. It doesn't make it any better. I still don't like my dad. Nothing will ever make it better again between us. To think I used to be so idealistic about it, you know... I thought it was just a phase.
They put him behind a plastic partition at a small white desk for interrogation. They're planning to keep him there for as long as they can before Dean becomes aware of Adam's arrest so Adam was allowed to get some sleep. This morning, Naomi woke him up by slamming her hands down on the table as hard as she could. After exchanging some quiet words, Naomi left the secluded area and asked Mick to watch him since there were more than enough IT-proficient officers there.
Cas fills in before Michael can, “Michael Shurley. His father Chuck is the creative director of Heaven magazine.”
"Look, they shot at us before we did. I'm sorry I didn't see that coming. And Berlin started shooting at them first," Dean replies angrily. "London, when you're done with Salem, go collect the earpieces from the rest, we need to dump them now."
"I'm sorry," Cas says and before Dean can start telling him that he's got nothing to apologise for, he adds, "But I am glad that at least you got to find a hobby you enjoy and excel at that isn't fashion. It's good to have an escape, something else to do."
"Well, those angels never met you," Cas says like Dean is some powerful force that could bring a cosmic being to its knees.
Sam comes back nearer to 10 at night and Dean’s already antsy from waiting for the moment Meg finds out he stole her runway gig, so when he opens the door, he blurts out, “What took you so long?”
Adam had a point. Michael knew since yesterday that the plan had been destroyed the moment he saw Lilith on the cameras and when Anael told them about John and Crowley, but he had been desperate to not believe that he had walked right into a failed plan and possibly into his next prison sentence while Dean acted like he had his shit together.
Because of the pain, Dean is unable to focus on holding off the bomb and is almost about to go off. Violet touches his shoulder with one hand.
Dean frowns. “You two sound great. Why’d you two break up, then? I mean, I’m assuming you did if you didn’t want him to know you were here.”
"This is so fucked up!" London screams over the gunfire as she and Dean fall to the ground, hands over their heads as protection. She reaches forward and grabs Dean's collar, pulling them closer to each other. She says tightly, "I'm not gonna die as fucking
Dean realises it; that ticking time bomb has finally gone off — Meg Masters. His voice is quiet when he asks, “Why?”
Sam nods hesitantly but confides in her anyway. "I don't trust Ketch or Naomi. I never met Naomi in person but we know she doesn't care and Ketch is a heartless bastard. They could kill Adam and we wouldn't find out until it's too late."
When Adam comes along in 2015, Dean's apprehensive at first because John actually did his job, and he sees everything he could have been in Adam — confident, at ease, not self-derogatory in any way... Sure of himself, secure in his being, stable, content, satisfied. He'd been jealous but now that he knows Adam, has spent time with him, he loves him as if he grew up with him too. He wanted to be there for him too, the way he'd always been for Sam. The responsibility of an older brother.
,” Dean says, patting his shoulder once before moving into the main hall. The truck door slides shut just as Meg, the last one to leave, disappears out the door. There are still hostages rushing to get out of the Factory and Dean mumbles with a small smile, "Showtime, Ro."
He had invited Crowley, Bela and Kelly to the party too. Kelly agreed to come, bringing Jack along. Jack has on an adorable rainbow beanie over his soft blonde hair that has Castiel internally melting and Kelly had a rainbow wristband on. Crowley had come in with Charlie, wearing a wristband as well, except this one has pansexual colours instead of a rainbow.
"Is this Castiel?" Mick's voice is hushed and there's a muted bustle behind him. Cas thinks he's calling from the tent. As if reading his mind, Mick says, "He told me your name so it wouldn't be weird." So either Adam or Dean (likely Adam) told Mick his name. Cas would be annoyed if it wasn't for the fact that Mick's call could be getting recorded. It's better to sound like a concerned friend of a hostage than a robber trying to get updates.
He pushes the door to the boiler room open with the tip of his boot, slowly, and turns quickly. "Rome?"
designer. To work at one of the top high fashion brands in the world as his first job would be a huge honour.
She sees the two beds pushed together, sheets messy, Cas's sleep shirt hanging off the edge of one of the beds. Dean stops breathing. Bela stares, wide-eyed, and looks at Dean. "I was only teasing. I mean, I had my suspicions that Castiel wasn't, you know,
"Aye," Rowena acknowledges, grabbing the supplies from the bag they took with them. Eileen and her each grab one board, holding it to opposite sides of the room while Ash walks between them, hands occupied with his laptop as he gets a headstart on cracking the code. The styrofoam boxes prevent the sensors from detecting their body heat until Rowena and Eileen get close enough to duct tape the sensors.
“I’m a garment technologist,” Kevin answers. “I figure out cloth and all that, make new materials or whatever. It’s a pretty cool job, my office is like four levels down, though. The other offices on this floor other than Castiel’s are Missouri's, the merchandiser, Pamela, who does PR and our marketing director who got fired a while back.”
Ruby sighs loudly and Anael chuckles, using the penknife to cut open another envelope. The letter is addressed to one of the younger inmates from what sounds like is a member of his gang. Anael tries not to blot out too much from the letters.
Gabriel shakes his head and hugs him again, muttering against Castiel's shoulder, "I'm gonna have the big bro talk with him."
Cas frowns, checking the pie in the oven, as Gabriel calls out, "Hey, Dean's calling you." Cas closes the oven door and takes the phone from Gabriel, pressing it between his shoulder and ear.
Dean waves him off, indicating that it's fine to ask, and answers, "I don't know, man. I think we just got distant."
Paris becomes very different when you’re staying there for a month for regular business instead of Fashion Week.
"There are ten SWAT guys out there, nobody can cover that many!" Benny protests, reluctant to leave.
“The office,” Dean answers, sniffing as he looks up at the ceiling light above him. “Nobody here and I didn’t feel like going home.”
Sam starts walking towards the door and Dean shouts, "Open the doors, Sam's coming in with med supplies!"
Angeles rolls his eyes, "To make sure you're not badly injured." Dean cooperates, helping get the vest off. Luckily, it was a considerably far range bullet so he'll probably only have a bad bruise. Good enough for Dean. Angeles checks once more, "Are you okay?"
He takes a quick shower after texting Cas his address and changes into a mint and black tartan-patterned army shirt by Vivienne Westwood. It’s almost like his cheap flannel shirts but on the off chance Cas qualifies this as a date, he doesn’t want to underdress. He’s sure Cas doesn’t own anything remotely not branded. He pairs it with plain black sweatpants from American Apparel. He gets started on the pasta, trying to make it as fast as possible while retaining as much as the quality. Cas texted back that he was on his way so Dean has about half an hour unless Cas doesn’t mind if the pasta isn’t ready by the time he arrives.
Jack moves closer and both angels glow orange -- Dean squints through the light as Jack transfers his godly power over to Michael. When it’s given, the light fades.
Dean has underestimated the amount of space between them because now he is way too close to Cas for this to be comfortable for either of them. He’s close enough to Cas to see the way his irises move slightly as if scanning his face, and the way his soft exhale feels over his mouth. Cas seems to take the distracting moment to redirect the line of questioning to Dean, replying, “You tell me. Why does being with Pax bother
They talk about TV shows and movie franchises they like; Dean finds out that Castiel actually quite likes science fiction, though he never had the time to get into it, and he didn't know where to start. Dean offers to show him and they can make a whole thing out of it, invite Castiel, Charlie, Kevin, Gabriel, and the others for a Star Wars watch party or something. Castiel says he'll think about it.
Meg huffs a chuckle, tucking the baggie into her jacket. “From what I’ve heard, she does sound like a handful.”
I've read and seen this before... When out people get mad because they think their partner isn't proud of them.
"Yeah, and —" Dean suddenly cuts himself off, pulling a dramatically appalled expression at him, his mouth in an 'O' shape. "You motherfucker." Crowley chuckles and waves his hand to tell him he's just playing. "Man, enough."
"I won't," Michael promises, a smile playing on his lips. Just hearing Adam's voice already made him feel healed. "Hello, Adam."
"What, can't a guy doll up a little?" Dean jokes, but it comes out strained and obviously just to delay what he wants to say. Cas sighs, the sound tinny from the other end of the phone, but comforting all the same.
Ketch and Naomi who are obviously a far cry from Sam and Zachariah. They weren't afraid to kill innocent people to get to them. Dean tries, "I'm working on it."
"Well, yeah," Meg shrugs. "Look, we all see the way you look at the boss man. The way you talk to or about him, the lengths you go to save him. I mean, if I didn't beat you to it, you would have handled this Naomi shit and he wouldn't have had to deal with it himself. And I heard about what happened with you and Dick Roman, and then that thing with Morningstar and his magazine. Don't know what that's about, but I know it's not easy to get him to budge. Motherfucker doesn't do shit for anyone so you must have had some balls to go up against him on your first day." Dean laughs and Meg smiles, resting her arm over Dean's shoulder.
"Shut the hell up, Adler. It could be anyone, they're wearing masks!" Sam snaps, trying to come to a decision.
Sam replies, “Good, at least you can relax now. We’ll probably wait for you at your apartment, I still have the spare key you gave me.”
"Yes," Naomi hisses. "The article is destroyed, alright? Irretrievable even in code. It's gone. Do you just go around asking magazine CEOs to take down pieces about Castiel? Do you have nothing better to do?"
"Okay," Cas says like a weight's been lifted off of his shoulders. "I'll go on a date with you, Dean."
Toni Bevell had crept out of the vents in the Factory to hear the Dalís arguing in the main hall. After she saw one of the robbers get shot down, the extent of their injuries unknown, Toni took that opportunity to sneak into the Factory. She knew they would be in disarray after coming to their bearings. Sure enough, the argument proved her right and they didn't even notice her coming in.
About two hours later, Castiel has approved the photos, and he thanks the models for their time. One of them gives Dean her phone number on a folded perfumed note. She's pretty, but Dean throws the number away.
Dean nods in agreement and pushes all thoughts of his husband to the back of his mind. He had bigger problems in his face right now and as long as Cas is in Italy, out of prison, Dean doesn’t have to worry about him. “Alright, so I have three favours left with Roman. If I spend one to get Crowley out of the SHU tonight and another to put Lilith and Michael on separate shifts…”
“I know you think you won’t but I don’t,” Dean replies. “We’ve been on plenty of 'dates' together. You’ve had dinner at my place, you’ve met my brother and you get along really well.”
!" Sam shouts in frustration, kicking a chair. He exhales into his hands and grabs the phone, telling Mick Davies to connect him to Kansas.
Ketch leans forward and smacks Adam across his left cheek, catching Adam by surprise. "Can only get worse from there, Milligan. Names, now."
Dean sneaks down the stairs of the dark house, making sure to step right over the one that creaked. Everyone else is asleep, even Sam, and Dean won't risk waking him up. It's hard enough getting a 3-year-old to get to rest and even harder to keep him asleep. It's his eighth birthday, his first birthday since moving into Bobby's. Dean didn't count his seventh birthday since it was the day itself that he and Sam were taken in by Bobby and his family.
He hears shuffling from the other end, probably Sam moving to a more private spot, before Sam asks, “What happened?”
Thank you for reading this. It's been such a pleasure to write this and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
He rests in the chair and exhales deeply through his nose, soaking in the quiet whirring of money printing machines that thrum in the walls.
Adam points out desperately, "You didn't even use firearms or anything. If you behave well, you'll get a shorter sentence. Plus, there's visitation."
Dean and Cas break away from one another, hands still clinging to each other’s clothes. Cas’s hair sticks up where Dean’s hands have pushed against it and a warm blush settles over the apple of his cheeks. He can’t tell if it was from the kiss or the alcohol, but he looks stunning.
“You can go home, you know. Just because you’re my P.A. doesn’t mean you need to be around all the time,” Castiel tries. “Go spend time with your brother.”
He quickly recomposes himself and says in a serious voice, "Chuck got shot, I shouldn't laugh." A look from Angeles has Dean laughing all over again, even though he knew he shouldn't be. Angeles had a contagious smile. He pushes Angeles lightly, insisting, "Stop making me laugh, asshole."
The old man stands and turns just as Dean kisses Castiel again and his face twists into disgust. "What the hell are you two doing?"
“I’m just so fucking angry,” Dean starts. “People are such goddamn sons of bitches and I hate that they think I need to tone it down or be someone else entirely just because it makes them uncomfortable because how the hell is it my fault?”
Anael doesn’t answer, squinting as she tries to make out what little of the cell she can see from the camera’s grainy image. She can see Michael pressed against the wall and Alastair saying things, the words lost to the lack of audio input and distance. At some point, he slips something into Michael’s pocket, and then he pats his chest twice before Michael stumbles out, looking disoriented.
“Sometimes, it’s best to let things run its course, boy,” Missouri suggests. “Meg may be known to carry a grudge to the ends of the earth, but even she gets tired of dodging people in the hallways.”
Naomi is silent for a minute and then a male British voice says, "We're not permitted to issue official permission for that... but I can say that you acted on your own accord, in self-defence."
“I’m sorry,” Dean says sincerely. “I’ll try to figure this out as fast as I can. You’ll be back in France in no time.”
They step through the door and the first thing that grabs their attention is a gorgeous mural on the curved ceiling above the altar. Gold, blue and white, Jesus has his arms outstretched to his loyal followers, a gold halo behind his head. Rows of wooden benches split into two columns line the area in front of the altar, a few people dispersed among the seats in quiet prayers barely above a murmur.
?" Dean returns, going closer. Red dots through his bandages and he frowns, saying, "I'll change your bandages."
Cas smiles at that and continues, “Make sure all the designers and stylists are there. Get one of the photographers too, and Isaac, Kevin, Gabriel, and Rowena.”
"Any minute now. When the doors open, they'll send out a mix of robbers and hostages to claim the food, water and medication," Ketch fills her in.
"Good morning," Dean greets, pulling her up by her hair so she would look at him instead of the floor. Blood is still trickling from her mouth and nose -- Dean suspects one of the robbers there took their anger out on her before he arrived. He couldn't complain -- he wanted so badly to do the same. It was the least she deserved after what she did to Balthazar and Bela.
“I know, I know. I don’t regret coming in here to help him and you,” Adam says. Michael can feel his frustration at the whole situation. “I’m just saying that he could’ve looked for other people, you know? Not that I don’t want to help save Crowley, but still.”
"Nonsense, boy. It's still your work," Bobby insists, looking around the hall. Cas had planned the runway in an event space in Midtown Manhattan on 7th avenue, so to make it easier on himself and give him more preparation time, he sent one of Cas's cars to pick up Sam, Eileen, Ellen, Bobby, and Jo when they arrived. It's big enough to seat 150 people, or 180 if they were really packing them in. There's Dean's family, Cas himself, some NOVAK employees, other designers like Bela, fashion writers like Chuck Shurley, photographers like Gadreel, and various other fashion-inclined guests.
Instantly, both of their eyes grow wide and Angeles watches quietly, casting his gaze to the floor like the carpet suddenly got interesting. Crowley stares at him, mumbling, "How did you get..."
"Would it be too cheesy?" Charlie frets. Dean puts the computer on sleep mode once he was satisfied with the schedule and starts packing his stuff to leave and get the stilettos.
"I don't know. Where the hell is that gurney?" Dean shouts. Salem and Paris come back with it and Dean carefully sets Angeles down. He cups Angeles's face in his hands, patting his cheek lightly, "Angel, come on. You good?"
“Fuck,” Dean curses, running a hand over his face. He had held out hope that Crowley could have gotten away with it. “How’d they get him?”
“Damn, we’ve been sleeping for a while,” Sam gets up and points at the cardboard boxes, “I’ll get rid of those when I go so don’t worry about them.”
“Okay,” Gabriel said, unconvinced. “But if you are, that guy... That word, you know. That word shouldn’t make you feel like it’s not okay.” Castiel tried to commit that to memory.
Dean leaves the room and the three of them watch him go. Michael eyes Sam warily as if Sam will ask him for his grace again, but Sam goes after Dean.
He glances out of the window - the other vehicles are where they last were. He reaches up and adjusts the rearview mirror, freezing wide-eyed when he sees.
With a wave of his hand, he sends them flying into the bookshelves. Michael LUNGES at Lucifer to try to steal the book but Lucifer teleports in time. Michael’s eyes glow again and he summons a ball of grace to THROW at Lucifer. Lucifer teleports once more and the grace EXPLODES against the wall.
"No!" Cas gasps, backing away. Dean reaches for him again and tries to lick the icing off his neck which has Cas losing his mind, laughing until they both end up on the kitchen floor, a little bit of flour from a slightly toppled bag dusts over them like light snow.
Cas comes in then, bringing an air of rushed energy with him. Today, he wears another womenswear brand, BCBGMAXAZRIA, a stucco-coloured trench coat that looks like polyester and spandex satin. His gaze falls on the brothers and he eases up slightly, walking to sit across from them at his desk. "Talk to me, Sam."
Sam Winchester, Charlie Bradbury, Jo Harvelle, Garth Fitzgerald, Crowley MacLeod, Meg Masters, Bela Talbot, Kevin Tran
Sam grumbles under his breath as Zachariah goes back into the tent to give the green light and he watches anxiously as the SWAT team starts moving towards different openings of the bank.
Michael nods at him in the rearview mirror and asks, "Where's Sam? Back home?" Dean tells him he's gone off to Bobby's and he nods again, beginning to drive back to the Novak-Shurley household. He asks, "What happened?"
"Good afternoon, Adam," Naomi greets with a tight smile. It's unsettling, like swimming with sharks.
We're going to Barcelona for a school trip. Dad wanted to come along but Michael and Gabriel convinced him that I would be fine on my own. As a compromise, Michael told Crowley about my condition and asked him to look out for me. It's better than having Dad there so I didn't complain. As a result, I've been paired up with Crowley for the hotel rooms. I think it could be good. Maybe.
"What was I supposed to do? Tell the president that we left his son in the hands of armed robbers?" Zachariah spluttered. Sam throws his hands up, turning away to simmer in his anger. Zachariah stares at Sam, thinking, and says, "I have an idea to turn the tide to our favour." When Sam looks at him, beckoning him to go on, he elaborates, "We pin something on one of the named robbers. Something they can't forgive. Cannibalism, selling drugs to minors, human trafficking."
Benny raises both hands with a smile, "Alright, I won't push. I think I get it. But you really like this guy?"
Dean takes John’s number and it is odd to look at the digits on the small slip of paper, knowing that there is another end to it, an end that won’t tell him that it is unavailable, an end that will ask, “Dean, is that you?” when he calls.
"Shut the hell up," Dean hisses, ducking under the low doorframe to walk into Rowena's ingredient storeroom. "You're the one who said she lets you in, right?"
Anael appears at his cell door, practically a sight for sore eyes. She goes in, shutting the cell behind her. “I got rid of all the security footage. What the fuck were you thinking, Dean? Killing Roman’s favourite toy?”
Jo takes out the sheet of paper with codes printed all over and starts pressing them into the keypad on each safe. Both of them work together to unlock each one and Meg dumps the diamonds into a bag.
Cas frowns, trying to think of what about his identity could possibly do anything to the plan. The worst thing he could come up with was an undercover cop and it seemed pretty outlandish. Gabriel shared a cell with Detroit for at least two years which is way longer than Cas would expect a cop to stay undercover in a prison for and especially if Detroit was getting smuggled items like alcohol. Maybe he knew someone on the team.
"You look really good," Kansas compliments; he has this grin spreading across his face, wide, sunny and slightly embarrassed.
"This is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life," Cas grumbles, looking at the Dean's notebook of recipes again. "I don't understand how this is supposed to become
When he can't even make out Cas's features clearly anymore, Dean begins to panic. There is a sensation that grows in him, unpleasant and relentless, and a chill settles in his bones as he processes that this is fear.
Dean shrugs, “Nah, I wasn’t really into the party anyway. I was supposed to pass this to my friend but I’m sure she can wait. You don’t wanna go to the party?”
Castiel is silent and because both of them are a little out of their wits with alcohol, Dean can't figure out what's on his mind. But Castiel, in general, is hard to read. He speaks, jarring Dean with how abruptly the topic has been changed.
Adam leans in a bit closer and, even though there’s nobody else there, his voice drops to a low volume as he says, “Dean doesn’t have a plan.”
“I’m sorry, am I not allowed to take your brother out for dinner?” Cas asks. Dean shakes his head slightly, not knowing what to respond with, and Cas waves him off. “Tell Crowley to pick a different day. I’m not free tonight.”
"If I knew you knew it, I wouldn't have asked Kevin to teach me if I could've asked you," Dean mumbles, putting his hands into his pockets. Castiel cocks his head at him, narrowing his eyes, and Dean has to look away before the adrenaline starts to tingle in his hands.
When they got back to Sioux Falls, Bobby tried to placate Dean, only to have Dean ask if he can bring him to the materials shop down the street so he could buy cloth to make the jacket himself. After a full month of day to night work, Dean came out of their shared room one evening after Ellen called them all for dinner, in a near-perfect recreation of the Louis Vuitton jacket. The sleeves went over his small hands and the bottom reached his knees. Bobby asked why he made it so big and Dean said he wanted to be able to wear it even when he grew up.
"No problem. I could help you in the workshop tomorrow, if you're gonna work on them," Dean offers, and he curses the way he comes off timid.
Dean explains, "They know my face, they announced me legally dead. If they check, they’ll know I’m your brother. That’s why it has to be
Shaking his head, Detroit huffs a laugh but before he can say anything, the old phone rings and Castiel passes him the phone. During the classes. Cas, Dean and Detroit agreed that in the event that Dean cannot answer the phone, Detroit will. His voice was the most similar to Dean's among all the Dalís with the voice modulator. Detroit takes the phone and clears his throat, picking up and saying, "Good afternoon."
Rowena, Sam and Crowley appear the quickest again and they get to work, propping Detroit up properly on a gurney that Jo brings to work better. They set up the equipment and supplies and Detroit grabs Cas's arm to stop him from leaving to make way for their medics. Cas pauses in his tracks and says, "Detroit, I need to make room for them."
Hannah blinks. "A writer of NOVAK's came to me and Marie Claire to organise this so I suppose you can say we're working together."
“I think I’ll go with the lace, I trust your judgement,” Eileen decides, taking the sample square to stroke the silk. Sam smiles to show that he’s listening as he scrolls through his phone waiting for his turn to discuss his wedding suit.
The words ring familiar in Dean’s ears -- reminding him of Cas’s “ever since I met you, you’ve changed me.” Dean tries to keep his face neutral.
Bela tries one of her more relaxing smiles. "Nothing you could say would ever make me hate you, Cas."
"I could see it starting with a 'C'," Castiel chuckles. "But it's probably something stupid like Leopold or Napoleon."
“Yes, sir,” Dean mutters, fingers flying across his screen. It occurs to him belatedly that he should just voice record Castiel next time and transcribe everything later.
“Yeah, I’ll be there,” Dean answers. “Why, is there like an orientation or something? This is my first real job in this industry.”
Charlie drags Missouri over to look at a brown suit with button detailing while Dean busies himself with one of the looks, a grey velvet coat with a darker grey suit underneath. It’s a simple look, but classic, and Dean wonders if Cas would buy it. He’d look good.
Dean lets the torn pieces drop to the floor and silence has never been so troubling to Sam until this moment. Finally, Dean says achingly, "A dead family man and one with a shot to his shoulder and all for paper and unused ingots. You can't think this is fair."
." Gabriel and Anna have messy makeup all over their faces in the yellowing picture and a grin threatens to break Castiel's stoic features. with Gabriel's arm around his shoulders. Castiel has a smear of electric blue eyeshadow across the tip of his nose, not as sharp as it is now with how young he was. There's hot rod red lipstick on the apple of his right cheek and Dean's pretty sure they got into a makeup fight before the photo was taken, because why else would lipstick be that high up and eyeshadow that low?
"I'm not cutting any of them, I'm just adding one more," Dean answers. He pulls back the plastic coating on one of the wires and attaches a new wire to the exposed copper. It's supposed to reroute the circuit entirely so even if the device Cas asked Dean to make doesn't work, the alarm will not be a problem for them. Every alarm sent by the door will now be completely irrelevant.
When Dean called him to propose a new heist, Adam almost instantly said no, until Meg took over the phone and launched into her reasoning about how they owed it to Bela, Balthazar and Benny to do her plan and honour their memory. He agreed with the sentiment, insisted that there were other ways to do right by their friends, and proceeded to lose that argument against Meg.
”I couldn’t find a cab once I left the café,” Cas explains, letting the cup sit in his hands to heat up his palms, watching the steam rise from its surface. “The office wasn’t that far so I decided to walk the rest of the way.”
“I’m inclined to not provide any answer, whether it does or doesn’t,” Crowley answers. “What does it matter if you have a few names, accurate or not?”
"You're a real one, Jess," Meg says before the line cuts off as Meg's hand falls off her radio. Cas joins her, already in the area, and they both make their way to the room.
what you got from that?” Adam asks, raising an eyebrow. “What I got was that Dean picked three favours with a private arms dealer over your life.”
Even with his aimless firing, Dean nicks the two cops and they fall back. Berlin helps him bring Salem back into the bank as Angeles and Vegas shoot into the air to make sure the cops don't try firing again. Rome closes the doors behind them and Dean takes Salem's mask off, cupping her face and looking her over. Blood trickles from her cheek and she's a little out of it, but fine. He orders Dallas, Vegas, Paris, and Berlin to stay with the hostages and brings Salem up to the governor's office, their new main headquarters.
Meg puts the revolver down and the others follow until there are no more guns pointed at anyone's head.
All eyes upon him, uncomprehendingly engraving themselves into his spine as they waited for anything else Castiel has to say.
He raises it to Cas's eye level and Cas analyses the diamond, like it's second nature to him, "1.5 carats." He takes the diamond from between Dean's fingers to get a clearer look. "58 facets, FL. Colour grade D... Beautiful."
Dean goes for lunch because there’s nothing else to do until he gets an answer from Meg. He’ll get the Westwood jackets after eating and he’d already called Crowley and Tessa. Kevin promised to send the samples up after he has lunch. Charlie came back from London two days ago and is back in New York, much to Dean’s happiness. He loves Charlie a lot and it’s not a far stretch to say that she’s his best friend. He hugs Charlie the moment he sees her, pulling her close and saying, “It’s so good to have you back.”
In the medical bay, Adam is there alone. Anael faintly remembers Rufus leaving ten minutes before. Adam goes through folders in the office as Lilith looks around, moving to one of the bedside tables to grab what looks like a scalpel. Anael tenses up, her eyes darting across the screens to relocate Dean and Gabriel. They’re almost at the medical bay.
“Nothing. Everything is fine,” Lilith says. “So what’s it going to be, De Luca? Alastair’s not the only person who knows how to make shivs.”
Missouri exhales through her nose and says, “They haven’t spoken in weeks, what with the runway show coming up next week.” She pats Dean’s shoulder in a way of comfort and it does work, even for a little bit. She has a very calm air around her and her voice is gentle and like birdsong that Dean hears when he wakes up in the morning.
"Just the one piece in your cheek and one in your hand. Easy work, thank God," Dean assures. "I'll patch you up in the lobby. Or if it really hurts, I'll take them out right now, but I don't have the med kit with me."
Once Anna disappears down the hallway, responding to a call on her radio about a fight in B block, Cas slips out of the chapel and follows the signage nailed on the ceiling to the medical bay. There’s about five beds there and one office for the main doctor, assuming that there were no other correctional nurses and that the doctor only gets additional help from inmates who knew what they were doing.
"Then why not get Gabe to live with you?" Dean asks, walking over to the window to look out at the city underneath. It's a beautiful sight, the city this late at night. Red and white lines skating the dark road as people go across the city, lights flickering on and off in the countless buildings.
He felt like he was being toyed with. Yes, the robbers made sure his wound wasn't infected and they took him off of tunnel digging duty after his gunshot wound so he could focus on recovery, but paranoia drove him up the wall. He came up with a scheme -- he had an escape planned. While Rome was gone doing God knows what, Chuck had taped dangerous tools from the tunnel under his coveralls and when Rome and Angeles returned, he asked to go to the bathroom.
Dean assures, "If anyone knows the best ring shops, it's Cas. You're in good hands." Sam gives him another hug, chuckling when Dean says, "My baby bro's gonna be an engaged man."
Adam laughs sarcastically and it feels cold in Dean’s gut. “Yeah, when Sam kidnapped me and Ketch and Naomi used me as a punching bag, you sure kept me safe.”
Dean, with his glass-green eyes and lovely smile. It took a lot of champagne, but Castiel finally got buzzed enough that fear turned to adrenaline and he kissed Dean back when he leaned forward in the cab. When they pulled away to pay the driver, Castiel watched with blurry eyes, the way Dean’s green eyes aren’t entirely green. It’s like it had a little sunflower that grows from the pupil, and in his tipsy mind, it’s like he sees a garden of beautiful sunflowers pointing to the sun.
Crowley leaves right then to start working on the secrets and Meg goes to help him. When they're gone, Angeles looks out the window and notifies, "They're coming with the supplies."
"Yeah, it's a secret and he's trusting you with it, so shut up. Not even Eileen can know unless he gives the green light," Dean warns. Sam nods in understanding. "Anyway, enough about me. Why are you going out with Cas tomorrow?"
us, Sam! We're trying to save the hostages but they think we're the bad guys. If this goes on, they'll start helping the robbers stay in the bank longer and I'm sure neither of us wants that." Sam doesn't make a move to interject and he continues, "Listen, there is a case that has been left unsolved. Human trafficking across the border. We can pin it on Crowley MacLeod or Meg Masters."
Cas jerks his head towards the elevator and by the time they get to the doors, Michael is already on his way out with Rowena assisting him. Thankfully, he's now a little more mobile than yesterday so at least Rowena didn't have to try too hard to help him. Crowley appears from the other hallway.
"I already told you, I've got it all sorted," Dean assures. "He's our insurance. As long as we have guns in there, they're not gonna come in." While Angeles may ask questions, Dean knows it's only because he's meticulous, and that's a good trait in a robber. He didn't successfully steal hundreds of diamonds with just sheer luck.
Dean warns as they approach his office, "Remember what we talked about with Abaddon. Be careful." Both of them nod behind him, raising their rifles. With a deep breath, Dean kicks the doorknob and the door swings open. The three of them rush into the room and Dean shouts, "Hands up! Back off!"
Today, Gilda had heard Kansas's voice through Nebraska's radio saying that they would leave at 2 this afternoon.
"Done," Dean mumbles, and Cas gets through the door. He hands lockpicking tools to Dean and the two of them get started on cracking the locks for the safe boxes. There is a total of 160 of them in the vault, all made of steel copper and secured with key and combination locks. The day before, Ash had hacked the system and given them the full list of codes, so they only had to deal with the key locks.
His vision clears up and Jesus, through the crack in the curtain, Cas is painted in soft, warm shades by the autumn sun, smiling softly as his white linen sheets have been halfway kicked off the bed in their slumber. He's wearing the ugliest
Sam secures them a seat near the window and they order their drinks. Dean accidentally asks for Cas’s usual order out of habit and decides it’s not worth it to ask for another cup. It’s the first time he’s tasted Cas’s order and it’s actually pretty good — the endless specifications end up being pretty worth the trouble. He’s not sure if he likes it so much because of the taste or because it reminds him of Cas. He wonders that if he kisses Cas after he drinks his coffee, how much of it would he taste and how much of it would be Cas.
The first thing the SWAT team will do is to case the building and see how their set up is like. They can't do that very well from outside, which means they will only rely on a small camera and instructions from the tent on how to proceed. Dean has all the hostages dressed in the same red coveralls as him and his team and distributed Dali masks as well. Now, they are indistinguishable from the robbers, all one and the same.
Nathaniel scoffs, leading them up some stairs to the second level. “Five years and you still ended up back in prison. What, did freedom get too boring for you?”
Cas and I had a whole prank war, and thank whatever that pen can't be autocorrected. He fixed it today so that's good.
When the truck abruptly stops, she can't help but smile, because just a minute later, the door is busted open and four guns point at the two guards with her. They order them to get out and they obey, mainly because they'd been too slow to react appropriately or even use her as leverage. They get out and one of the two men helps her out of the truck since she's tied up.
Bela leans over at some point during the shoot where they're sitting back to back and whispers into his ear, "I think she likes you, Cas."
Bela's place: https://25parkrow.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwu8r4BRCzARIsAA21i_BaiDISROnTepxxgoY1M-7tPkO4oMcqWwJHJ4SopHZ9e3Fc0bVoYMkaAggoEALw_wcB
She scoffs, sliding down in her seat slightly and spreading her legs under the table like a juvenile teenager. "Okay, but I want to know who's who."
“More than you,” Dean grins, hugging Eileen hello. “By the way, Castiel said you two are welcome to visit the office tomorrow if you want. He’s pretty free, just a photoshoot in the afternoon and a business dinner, so he can show you around.”
"Three days is already pushing my luck. It's awards season and then Fashion Week in a couple of months, I need to go back. I can't avoid him forever," Dean shakes his head. The waitress arrives to give Adam and Michael their spaghetti before she walks off. His phone vibrates and he looks over at it to read the text message.
Dean nods, ducking just in time to dodge a hat being strewn across the hallway. He asks, trying to keep up with Castiel’s quick pace, “Do you usually attend all of them?”
Sam spends his downtime with Dean or on a joint video call with Charlie and Kevin, both of whom Sam had gotten extremely close to. When he's working, Dean stays out of his way because he tends to sigh a lot and Dean's tired of warning him of getting stress lines.
Sam and I went to the hospital to see him one more time before. We wore cheap Star Wars costumes (I was Han and he was Luke) and we brought Cas a deerstalker, the one Sherlock wears. We had a pumpkin bucket with some of the candy we bought on the way. I left it by his bed in case he gets hungry after we leave. He ate a Hershey bar while we were there.
In complete honesty, Angeles intrigued Dean. For one, him choosing Angeles as his name. Dean chose Kansas City because he grew up in Kansas (even though Kansas City isn't in Kansas for some reason but instead, Missouri, but he thought Kansas sounded better than Lawrence). People like Adam and London chose the cities they've lived in. Paris, Rome, Vegas, Berlin and Dallas chose cities they liked visiting. Angeles chose L.A. and gave no explanation. All Dean knows about Los Angeles is that it's sprawling with creative minds and that it's also known as the city of angels. It's also ironically known as a sin city like Las Vegas. Maybe Angeles likes the irony. He seems like the kind of guy.
Meg grits her teeth and grabs his arm, marching him out of the room. "Tell the others that because of your stupid mistake, that none of them gets to record messages anymore. Fucking
That's what Windom is for -- Adam Milligan. Dean found his half-brother in Windom, Minnesota when Adam called and asked for John Winchester. Dean went to see him and coincidentally enough, Adam had dabbled a little bit in thievery to help get expensive medication for his sick mother. Dean invited him to join his heist, claiming that if they pulled it off, he would never have to steal again. Adam agreed instantly and is now serving as his outside man, keeping as close an eye he can on the police's investigation and tying up any and all loose ends that they may have left on the outside. Dean would do it himself but he has to keep control in the bank.
"Of course," Cas says, turning on his heel. "Let's go." Dean orders Crowley to come with them so he and Eileen can start on gold once he and Cas finish setting up the equipment Eileen brought.
“That’s the hospital and Adam’s problem!” Anael glances out of the cell at an inmate passing by, trying to school her face into something more neutral to not grab attention. “Dean, don’t be a fucking hero. That’s not who we are. Just do the damn plan and get us out of this place. We don’t need Lilith’s drug ring on top of it. What if you get caught and get thrown into solitary? What the hell do we do then? Solitary can go for over a month.”
Bela turns to look over her shoulder and grins, waving. "Hey, Meg. Come in, the water's cool." She has on a plain red shirt, already soaked and translucent against her skin. Meg goes into the water, feeling her own shirt cling to her as she wades over to Bela.
"You should watch out," one of the guards says, the warning surprisingly seemingly well-intentioned that it's somehow scarier than if the guard was taunting him. "They cut her loose last night and gave her a gun."
"Alright, good luck with the meeting. Meg's all buzzed on coffee," Dean warns. Castiel waves to him without turning around, leaving his office. How Dean just
Castiel himself is an enigma. More often than not, Castiel comes in, spills orders onto Dean’s desk and then leaves to handle other business. Dean rarely gets to see him for more than five minutes at a time which is bewildering as his personal assistant. Though, he did get to see him a little more recently so Dean chalked it up to how he was probably just busy with tying up all the loose ends before he hired Dean.
“When you have only eight days left before you get your brains fried, it tends to put your priorities in order,” Crowley says patronisingly.
"No," Cas mutters, willing himself to sit through the rest of the show, watching his designs come out in slipshod handiwork that he quickly realizes means the one week of postponing was for Dick Roman's team to put together the collection with overtime. It's difficult, but possible with the right people, especially since they only managed to come up with 10 of the outfits from Cas's 30 outfit collection.
Anael frowns. It was the best plan they had when compared the crappy ones Dean and Meg had come up with and it’d immediately gone down the drain. “Well, is there a way where more than one person could go? Food poisoning?”
The case no longer belonged to just them -- other than Naomi Intel from FBI on a flight over, an Interpol agent was sent, Toni Bevell. Although, she disappeared by the time the tent was set up so he has no idea if this is Interpol protocol or if she decided that the Dalís weren’t enough of a threat for Interpol to handle.
Dean sighs, backing away and looking over at his wrapped gift on the coffee table. “Nothing, just waiting on something. Anyway, how was dinner?”
Michael stares directly at us as if speaking to the audience -- it's chilling; God's most loyal follower who has lost his faith.
Dean managed to get Cas out for a last-minute date on the weekend, just a movie date and then just walking around until they get bored. It sounds like nothing but Dean enjoyed every chance he got to spend time with Cas so it was all good to him.
Before Dean’s brain can process anything else, his body takes over and his fingertips skirt Cas’s jaw; slow, making sure it’s okay, and when Cas’s eyes slide shut, Dean leans forward and presses a kiss to his lips, light and fleeting. Drunken haze brings Cas’s hands forward to cradle Dean’s face and pull him back in. Dean presses back into Cas, opens his mouth over his and kisses him breathless.
"That's just for security," Dean waves dismissively, looking off at the dark sky again as he takes a long drag. "And that sounds nice. Would you mind if I visited your place in Italy?"
Dean narrows his eyes and tilts his head. It quickly processes that he’s picked up the habit from Cas and he remedies it, straightening up. “Is Pax an issue for you?”
who gives me up. Play me off as a hostage, like I don't remember you. They'll help me." He looks to Cas and says, "Call Jess, tell her the plan. Tell her I need her to prove that I'm a hostage. You'll ask them to send me back tomorrow."
On Sunday after a last-minute dinner, the paparazzi finally manage to catch them. They'd been trying to get Dean and Cas since they came back but Cas had expertly navigated through and away from them those times. You just can't run forever.
Dean stares at Cas and he sees concern, maybe a little bit of anger. Contemplating his next move as Meg waits for their decision a few feet from them. Finally, he turns to her and says, "This will only take a few hours. Grabbing the diamonds and going." Cas presses his lips together but doesn't say anything. At least, not out loud.
"Yeah, thanks, Cas," Sam nods, watching Cas walk back over to the abandoned garments. Once he's out of earshot, Sam puts his bags down by the door and pulls Dean into the kitchen.
The diener, Ezekiel, stands by the door waiting for them as they slow to a stop in front of him. They both get out of the van and Anael says, her thumb pointing over her shoulder at the van, “Body’s in the back.”
Dean nods and takes the panelling off, revealing a mass of wires tangled. Meg frowns up at it, commenting, "How the hell do you know which one to cut?"
Dean waves back to say he will, then he looks out at the view again, spreading his arms as if welcoming the sun.
Cas turns to look at them and smiles as Bela gushes, “That was such a fantastic show, truly. Especially for a novice! Well done. I ought to poach you from Cassandra here.”
Lucifer FIRES a blast of grace at Michael and Michael stumbles back from the damage. He forces himself to get up and Sam and Dean watch as Michael PUNCHES Lucifer into the floor, the wood cracking under Lucifer’s body.
“He’d need to actually be around to pay for it,” Dean says. He didn’t mean for it to come off to snippily but he sometimes has a problem with holding back his emotions. Specifically, anger, and he was pissed at John. His brain knows that Adam didn’t choose for John to stay, or to be born to John, or to have John pay for his education, but Dean is bitter and it is unrelenting in his chest. Adam looks uncomfortable and Dean almost feels apologetic.
Since he’s early, he gets started on all the orders Cas gave him the previous night. He calls Naomi Intel from Marie Claire magazine to remind her of the NOVAK jackets she has to return after borrowing them for a photo shoot. He calls Raphael Finnerman and confirms his dinner with Cas at Pastis. He calls Toni Bevell’s agent and cancels her appointment. He leaves a note on Cas’s desk to remember to call Mark Cain. All that’s left is Meg and Pax, so he goes to deal with Meg first, figuring that he can tell Pax later during lunch.
“An ant can’t crush a boot, you’re right,” Dean agrees. “So think of it this way; I’ll have you in for multiple counts of tax evasion.” He gestures to Lucian “Ant," — and to himself — “And boot.”
“I wasn’t gonna say that,” Anael mutters, rolling her eyes. “Alright, Winchester. Back to what you were doing. Stay out of trouble.”
"Your second mutiny," Meg answers, directing Kansas to walk forward as Crowley led the way to the other room. "Let us leave the bank."
Dean knows he's attractive, and he's been asked numerous times if he's ever thought about being a model. He used to let art school kids take photos of him for their coursework so he could get what little money they would pay him for his time and effort. They let him keep copies of the photos and he knew he looked good in them, but his skin gets hot and uncomfortable if he's under the studio lights for too long, and he's not big on makeup when he's getting sweaty.
“Fine,” Naomi relents. “But if I end up unable to find who started all this, I’ll be coming for you and your Ruby, CO Jo.”
Bela raises both her eyebrows at him and he furrows his own. "I don't see what that has to do with her interest in me."
“Everyone’s a kid to you, you gigantic asshole,” Dean bullies. When he hears the elevator doors ding, Dean quickly puts the photo down and retreats back to his desk. “Hey, Castiel’s back. You wanna ask him about that car?”
Castiel nods, the action so small that it's almost like he didn't do it at all, and says, "Well, Mr Novak is fine. Or Castiel."
“Let’s say someone sung like a bird,” Naomi smiles, gesturing to one of the smaller rooms. “Can we talk?”
Dean answers, picking up his Dalí mask, "Buys us more time with the hostages and the public. We need it. They're more important than the cops in this bank."
“Shit.” Michael glances out of the window like he’s thinking about every possibility, every outcome, calculating the chance of one or all of them dying. “We can’t let him die.”
