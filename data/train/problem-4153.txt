Eventually, they pulled away from each other. The air in the room felt thick and pulled bowstring tight.
“Dean’s been chomping at the bit to work a case for weeks now,” Sam said. “The least I can do is let him interview a few people while I try to see if there’s another angle we can work in the meantime.”
He felt the phantom twitch of his wings--now gone as he was permanently human--fluttering in happiness. The phantom limb syndrome had disturbed and torment him when he was human for the first time after the fall. Now it was a comforting reminder of all he’d gained by giving them up.
“Sure.” Dean nodded. He let the shirt go and stretched out his arms as much as his ribs would let him.
Joyce grabbed two coffee mugs and filled them. “The other one asked for a strawberry milkshake and a water.”
They gave up trying to fight their way up the stairs through the solid mass of believers dropping to their knees in supplication between them and the ghostly angel. The security guards were standing at the edges of the crowd looking back and forth from the angel to the crowd, each other and back again.
“We were thinking we’d split up today,” Sam said. “I spoke with some of the people in line for the movie last night and got the information on the woman running the festival. Mom, I figured you and I could interview her. Dean and Cas can go talk to the families of the recently deceased around town. See if we can get a lead on who this angel is, or was.”
“They’re posing as him?” Scott said. “But he’s dead. Prescott may be growing, but it’s still very much a small town. Someone would notice if one of the war heroes who’d died came back to life and started watching movies.”
Dillon’s smile melted away. He was staring past Castiel now or through him, but he did not seem to see him.
“That’s nice,” Summer said. “It’s good to have faith that strong, Sam. Now, I really must be going.”
“Yeah, I know I just told you to stop thinking,” Dean said. Cas opened his mouth, and Dean waved him off. “What I mean is, if you and I are fighting through a nest of vamps, are you studying every move I make so you know what to do next or is it more intuitive? Like you know where I’m going to be and when I’ll be there, and you look over every once in a while to make sure that hasn’t changed and none of them got the drop on me when you weren’t looking. That’s the way you gotta follow me here.”
Crossing the room and gathering Cas into a tight hug felt as natural as breathing. He still smelled the same in Dean’s arms. Tears fell unbidden down Dean’s cheeks as Cas returned the hug and they sunk into each other.
“How are you doing?” Joyce asked as she slid into the opposite side of the booth. Her red-blonde hair was wrapped back in a braid. The straggler strands around her face were held down by bobby pins. She was the aunt of the cop who’d found Dean sleeping and confused in a public park nearby seven months before.
“Yes,” the kid said. He looked like he could be in college, but the lightness around him felt like that of a little kid. “I like milkshakes.”
“Sam, twelve hours. That’s all I’m asking,” Dean said. He huffed, emboldened by the intensity in Cas’s eyes and the thick air between them. “You’re interrupting date night.”
“In Iraq,” Scott said. “We were in the same unit. Dillon was our medic. He saved my life more times than I can count.” He cleared his throat and toyed with his coffee mug. “And in the end I wasn’t there to save him when he needed it.”
The bunker was silent. Three am when everyone you knew and loved were dead and gone had that kind of effect on a place. At least, Dean assumed it was three in the morning. He hadn't bothered to charge his phone in days so the battery was long since dead. The old analog clock on the wall read three and that was farther than Dean cared to know for certain.
Castiel blinked at Dean with watery eyes. He shook his head and a ghost of his sad smile spread over his features.
Dean rolled his eyes as he navigated onto the highway. Headlights flared in the rear view mirror. They had company.
Dean choked on a bit of dry pie crust. She waited patiently for him to get his breath back and all his food down.
Dean blinked hard and only realized he was shaking his head when Cas’s fingers tightened to hold him still.
“Okay,” Sam said. “Was there anyone else? Maybe someone new at church with a larger than life presence or someone who visited you in a dream? Someone who called themselves an angel or a god?”
Castiel grabbed the duffel bag and followed them out of the room. Dean’s spirits lifted as the elevator reached the ground floor and the glass doors leading out of the hospital came into view. His high spirits crashed and burned when he saw the white economy rental car that unlocked with the push of a button in Castiel’s hand.
“You’re safe,” Castiel whispered against Dean’s mouth before pressing a light kiss to Dean’s lips. “You’re home.” Another light kiss. “I’ve got you.” And another. “And I love you, Dean Winchester,” Castiel said as he gave Dean another, deeper kiss.
Once the wound was clean, Cas moved on to washing the rest of Dean’s head, neck, and face. His opposite hand was a steady, constant weight on the side of Dean’s neck. Whenever he needed Dean to move, he’d use that hand to guide Dean in a different direction. Like most of their deeper communication, it was silent.
Dean looked over Cas's shoulder at the picture. Scott was clean shaven with shorter blond hair, a deeper tan and a smile that stretched from one ear to the other. He had an arm thrown around the shoulders of another man who was looking sideways at Scott with a slightly sad smile that seemed somehow familiar to Dean. Dillon’s hair was dark and curled around his forehead and ears. His shoulders were broader than Scott’s, but the way he curled under the other man’s arm made him seem gentle, small.
“No mirrors,” Dean said. He counted off with his fingers as he listed the things they didn’t find. “No smoke machines. No projectors beyond the one that should be there. There were traces of EMF though.”
He mentally replayed the conversation they’d just had and the staring at Cas he’d done. Dean’s eyes widened as he realized that Cas was right. He had call him cute. Stupid Lovecraftian truth goo disconnecting his brain to mouth filter.
Cas muttered something, then tightened his grip on Dean’s waist. “Let’s get you to the infirmary, then.”
It was late and dark when Dean finally gave in to his heavy eyelids and pulled the Impala off the highway to park for the night. Stars dotted the night sky outside Baby’s windows as Dean stretched out on the driver’s seat using his folded up jacket as a makeshift pillow. Moonlight lit her interior with an ethereal glow.
“Yeah, you don’t want to do that,” Dean said. His voice was cold, but his blood ran hellfire hot in his veins. If this son of a bitch thought he was going to hurt Cas, Dean would be more than happy to correct him.
Cas whirled around in Dean’s arms. His hair was ruffled in all directions. His glare was icy and sharp. He reminded Dean of a very angry cat.
“Becky was a sweet girl,” Dean said, truthfully. “She just had a thing for dolls and Sam is terrified of clowns, so it never would have worked out between them.”
Sam shook his head and looked at the screen where those pre-trailer movie trivia cards were going by.
Sam’s phone made a noise signaling a new text message. Dean watched his brother pull his phone out to check the message. Sam’s expression melted into something even softer than it was before. Like the inside of a fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookie, his features were practically gooey from whatever he read on his phone.
“Wild boars with big tusks,” Jenny said holding her fingers up in front of her mouth to mimic the tusks. “They’re mostly harmless, but they’re big and travel in packs and if they think you’re there to mess with their babies they’ll charge at you.”
Maybe he should sweep the room. They might be caught up in some kind of spell or in some kind of weird angel and human vessel warding.
He and Sam moved to the aisle and started to make their way to the stairs leading to the back of the theater. A crowd of people begging forgiveness and holding outstretched hands toward the angel stood between them and the angel.
Castiel leaned forward so their forehead’s were touching. Dean didn’t know which of them moved first to intertwine their fingers. Castiel let go of Dean’s hospital gown and reached up to cup the side of Dean’s neck. His thumb rubbed against Dean’s jaw with a touch so soft you could only call it a caress.
Sam’s smiles and knowing looks had become all too observant and pointed when it came to Dean and Cas’s friendship in recent years, even more so in the last several weeks. Sometimes it was reassuring that Sam seemed to know the way Cas drove Dean crazy. Other times, it made everything hurt more because Dean had no intentions of acting on any of his feelings.
talk to us directly.” She flicked her attention to Mary for a moment then back to Sam. “If you’re having conversations with angels and God, maybe you should try speaking to someone with more… education on the subject than myself. A doctor, perhaps.”
The humming from the orb turned sharper, almost painful. Green light began to pour out of the engravings. The light filled Baby’s interior casting sharp shadows and blinding them to the outside world.
Cas nodded and looked down to watch Dean’s feet as Dean began to move. Cas took small steps. His brow was wrinkled, and his feet landed heavily with each step. Like dancing was a math problem he needed to solve.
“You nearly died, Dean,” Castiel in a voice that was almost too quiet to hear. He said it like it made up for any of the blood on Dean’s hands.
Mary’s cheek twitched while she clenched her teeth, but eventually she nodded. “Is that what you think happened here? An angel protecting someone.”
William had helped Ricky get a handle on the addictions that had plagued him as a teen and assisted Ricky in paying for nursing school. He was only a semester away from being able to quit his job as a waiter and start working at a hospital when Kushiel had taken possession of William and changed Ricky’s life.
“Did you…” Sam looked from Dean to Cas and back again. “No, you know what. I’m gonna step outside and let you two talk.”
Shame and memories from years before nipped at Dean’s heels. Anxiety-tinged bile clawed at the back of his throat as he all but slammed the men’s room door shut behind himself.
They drank until Dean’s limbs were loose and warm. Until the smile on Cas’s face turned gummy and rosy-cheeked.
“You know what?” Dean said. His mouth twisted and a quiet, distant voice at the back of his head started yelling at him to shut up, to stop. “You’re right. I wasn’t the only one who fucked up yesterday. You and Sammy should have left me there and finished the bastard off. You two let him get away instead of doing your jobs.”
Thoughts of Dean made him frown as he looked around the bar. The text he’d received from his best friend was jumbled and felt off in tone. Castiel knew Dean was supposed to be on a date tonight with someone Sam knew from work. Dean’s remorseful text implied the date did not go well.
Cas’s expression crumpled. His eyes filled with unshed tears and his voice came out unsteady. “You.”
“I was just remembering something,” Mary said. She looked back at her plate. “From when you were little. You’ve probably forgotten it, but it’s still fresh for me. I just got lost for a moment, sorry.”
Cas came back into the house. His expression was blank in a way that reminded Dean of the first few months after they’d met. It was Cas's version of a protective mask. It was the face of the heavenly soldier following orders from on high. Dean wanted nothing more than to wipe that look off his face forever.
“Earth to Cas,” Dean called out a few rows above where Castiel was standing. “You gonna gawk there all night or are you planning to help?”
Cas’s laughter died down and he licked his lips before nodding. “Yes, when I… came back, I was graceless. Human. Whatever happened between when Lucifer stabbed me and when I woke up beneath the sheet Sam and Jack had draped over me while they built the pyre they intended to burn me on left me human.”
“And then you bitched about your back hurting all night,” Sam said. “I told him to stay behind at the motel to ice it today, but he refused.”
Scott stood up from the table and led them to the living room. On the far wall was a fireplace with a few framed pictures on the mantel. There was a large gap or two where Dean assumed Scott used to keep pictures from his marriage. Scott picked up a frame near the center of the collection and passed it to Cas.
Once the wounds they’d endured after encountering Kushiel had healed, Dean had followed through on his promise to properly train Castiel to hunt. Castiel already had some of the basics down from years of observing the brothers and trying to mimic their techniques. His skills with it had improved greatly since Dean had started training him.
“I couldn't do it again,” Dean said while he held Cas's stare. “There was no fucking way I was going to watch you die again.”
Dean moved to sit in the car automatically. Castiel swearing was still a rare enough occurrence to make Dean a bit nervous and a bit… other things that he wasn’t going to study to closely. Castiel closed the door with a dissatisfying, hollow thud. Dean grumbled to himself about stupid new plastic and aluminum cars as Castiel thanked the orderly and made his way around to the driver’s side.
Dean was thankful he didn’t have to spell it out for Sam that he had no intentions of letting Cas out of his sight for at least the next three lifetimes. Maybe that would keep the stupid angel from dying on him again.
Sam tapped his pen against his notebook. Maybe if he made enough noise one of them would notice that he was still in the room. Or maybe he could slip out the door and rent himself a separate room before whatever weird tension they had building between them snapped and Sam was left mentally scarred for life.
Dean turned away from Castiel who was staring at the far wall with the blank soldier expression he defaulted to when he needed something to hide behind. Dean reached behind himself to undo the laces at the back of the hospital gown. The bruising on his ribcage was fading from purples to greens. He tossed the hospital gown onto the poor excuse for a pillow on his right and picked up the flannel Castiel had thrown at him earlier. There was a t-shirt wrapped up in it, but Dean didn’t have the energy for putting on his usual layers today. He just wanted to be covered and on his way back to the bunker as soon as possible. That meant getting dressed and getting back to ganking the son of a bitch that had put him in the hospital.
. As the world burned beneath their feet and all hope seemed to disintegrate in front of their eyes, they repeated the words.
They’d grown up on the road, and Dean loved driving. It was one of the few things that settled his mind when things were going out of control, but the older he got, the more driving for hours on end punished his body.
“I suspected you would not be happy with the car the rental company had available,” Castiel said. Dean grunted in agreement. “I brought one of your cassettes with me.” Castiel frowned as he glanced at the dashboard between them. “This car does not seem to have a cassette player. The rental car man was not helpful when I asked him how I was supposed to play the cassette in this car. He suggested I ‘join the modern world’ and use something called an mp3 player or find a CD.”
The kiss hurt. Too much teeth, not enough tongue or lips. The years Dean had spent imagining it and psyching himself up for this moment didn’t come close to just how
The door opened. Castiel stood there for a moment dressed in a pair of sweats and one of Dean’s old t-shirts. His hair stuck up in all directions like he’d been running his fingers through it. His eyes were red and heavy lidded. He looked exhausted and he held Dean’s bedroom door knob in a white-knuckle grip. He looked miserable and alive. Gloriously alive.
“Dean, that’s enough,” Cas said. “Mr. Allen, I don’t know how much Dillon told you about us, but I can assure you I am not like one of the angels who was sent to bring him back to Heaven.”
The man who opened the door had sandy blond hair and a scraggly beard that reminded Dean a little bit of the first time he’d met Chuck.
“I know you will. Somehow, you always are.” Cas handed him the bottle of water and held up the paper cup. “You should rinse your mouth first. You’ll feel better.
Crap, thinking about wanting different things than your partner had Dean thinking about Danny again. When they weren’t getting handsy with each other, they used to talk about their futures past high school. At the time, Dean was old enough to be emancipated in Iowa and Danny used that as an excuse to leave paperwork about it in Dean’s locker every chance he got. It was a source of tension for them. Danny loved his little suburb and he never understood what Dean saw in a life on the road.
Sam closed his eyes. He was getting a headache. “Wait, so you’re trying to tell me you’ve been hooking up with guys this whole time?”
They held each other’s gaze in the mirror until Sam shouted from the hotel room doorway asking if they were decent and ready to go yet.
Dean grunted a negative response, clenching his teeth. Sam didn’t need to know about the aborted texts Dean had written out and deleted over the last few days. Texts like
Castiel took a sip from his piping-hot mug of coffee. His eyelids slipped closed as he basked in the flavor. He didn’t know why he found coffee so comforting.
Once the dust settled into piles of heartache and mourning like they always seemed to do, Dean found himself standing against one of the tables in the bunker staring at the front door waiting for Castiel to come home. His stomach flipped and flopped and somersaulted in on itself while he waited, but he’d made up his mind. He wasn’t going to bitch out this time.
Before leaving the crime scene, Sam checked in with Detective Baum and got access to the preliminary case files. He sent those and an early news report via text to Cas to see if the angel recognized anything.
With his empty hand he undid the fly of his jeans and pushed them and his boxers down his thighs. He popped the lid open on the bottle of lube and coated his hand, working the liquid around with his fingers to warm it up. Then he wrapped his hand around himself.
Commotion from the back of the theater caught their attention. They stood up from their seats and turned. The angel had materialized on the steps at the back of the theater instead of the front this time.
The light in Baby was low, even with a full moon outside, but Dean could still see the twitch at the corner of Cas’s lips as he looked from Dean’s face to Dean’s obvious erection.
They would never know what really happened to get Ricky and Carolynn to go so far to help Kushiel as he killed people and trapped angels, but Castiel hoped they’d both found their peace now.
Now, when they got lost or overwhelmed, they sought each other out like tree branches reaching for the sun.
“I have nowhere else I’d rather be,” Castiel said. He didn’t know what was making him feel brave enough to be honest about that, but there was a certain level of relief in him once the words were out there in the open.
Sam checked the time; it was still mid-morning. Only an hour had passed since they’d separated from his brother and the angel. Normally, Sam would jump at the opportunity to be more productive, find some way he could help solve the case faster. Interviews like the one he’d just been through always left him on edge.
Castiel and Dean were also very happy. They’d returned from their last hunt early this morning. Dean had driven fifteen straight hours, in spite of Castiel’s protests and offers to drive for a while, and practically collapsed when they’d reached the bunker.
“You said ‘fuck you’ and I said okay,” Cas said. “If you are offering to have sexual relations with me, then I accept.”
He also didn’t know why thoughts like that kept coming to him. Like he was holding strangers up against a man he didn’t know to judge their worth.
Before he could talk himself out of it, he scrolled away from the action movie tab and stopped at one near the end of the list. Once there he found one of his old favorites and pressed play.
Dean’s fork scraped across his plate. He looked down to see the last of the cherry filling and crust was gone. He put his fork down on the plate and reached for his coffee.
Draped over the thin metal hanger was a long piece of dark fabric covered in gold sequins. The sequins shimmered in the overhead fluorescent lighting. Cas’s expression was devoid of nuance, all blank and unreadable.
“No,” Dean said, going still in his seat. He turned his attention to the book once more. Maybe there was something buried in that chapter about ancient wraiths they could use.
Luck must have been on Dean’s side that night because when they reached the motel the Impala was parked out front and within hours their duffle bags were packed and that locker room and Sam’s nosy questions were left behind them forever.
Dean rubbed at his chest. Why did he even bother coming to the hotel? He should have left in Baby when he had the chance. He stood up and grabbed his duffel bag.
Dean’s breath clouded in front of his face as the EMF reader in Castiel’s hands came to life with lights flashing and alarms sounding.
Castiel hesitated for a moment. He laid there immovable like a marble statue of some ancient soldier. Dean was struck once again with the realization of just how old and universe weary Castiel really was. Guilt soured Dean’s stomach when he thought about how much trouble and pain he’d caused Castiel to suffer through over the years.
Castiel’s expression crumbled as his voice cracked. Dean let go of the mattress and reached out to hold Castiel’s hand that wasn’t still fisted in Dean’s hospital gown. He coaxed Castiel’s fingers to relax from the tight fist he had them in.
Mary looked from Dean to Cas. Dean watched the gears in her head spinning like she was trying to work something out. Eventually, she shook her head and turned her attention to Sam.
“Yeah,” Dean said. He made a mental note to find a few movies related to Heaven and angels that didn’t suck to watch with him later. Purely for the amusement factor of watching Cas tear them apart and bitch about their inaccuracies. “There’s a film festival going on with a bunch of movies about Heaven and angels. The angel showed up last weekend at the end of the first movie and started ranting at the people in the audience.”
“Everything, Cas,” Dean said. “I want things with you I’ve never wanted with anyone else, not this badly. I don’t want to fuck this up.”
Cas stared at him. His head cocked to the side, eyes narrowed. Dean tightened his hold on the duffel bag handle in his hand.
Once he was settled into one of the two recliners, with his bounty occupying the other one, he turned on the tv and the computer Charlie had loaded up with movies and tv shows for them. He scrolled through the list of movie genres. His cursor hovered over the action movie tab for a moment. He glanced at the door leading out of the cave. It was locked. That meant no one would come by to interrupt him. No one would have to see the movie he chose.
Cas rolled his hips so their cocks drug against each other. Dean pulled away from the kiss and pressed his lips to Cas’s cheek as he panted and groaned.
Dean started the engine as Sam slid into the passenger seat. Sam pulled out the drinks and snacks they’d picked out to eat on the road. Dean shook his head when Sam tried to pass Dean his bag of pork rinds.
Cas rolled his eyes as he moved to the recliner next to Dean’s. Cas picked up the remnants of Dean’s snack bounty and set them on one of the side tables before settling into the chair. He reached over to grab the remote from Dean’s hand and started the movie up again so they could watch the bloopers.
Sam ran a hand through his hair and stared at the ceiling. “Will you please go out for a drink or a drive, or just
“What do you mean by together?” Sam asked. He stared at the tablet screen. The cursor blinked in the text box where he’d stopped typing mid-word.
Dean looked away. Maybe if he talked to their captors he could convince them that Cas didn’t deserve to be here. They could let him go so Dean didn’t have to watch him die again. So Dean could know that Cas was out there somewhere safe and alive.
“Why would they hire armed guards for a film festival?” Dean asked. “We got someone important in the crowd here?”
“No,” Cas said. “Dillon is, to the best of our knowledge, dead. But someone or something is posing as Dillon’s ghost and using the film festival to preach to the crowd.”
The words tasted like a lie on his tongue, but he didn’t know why. Surely his nightmares and dreams weren’t real. They couldn’t be. All those monsters. All that blood on his hands.
“So Sam,” Mary said. “What’s going on with this case? You mentioned you and Dean went back to the theater last night, but you didn’t say what happened.”
Dean’s cheeks ached from smiling. If this was madness he’d take it over the desperate pain of grief any day.
“I keep in touch with the ones who aren’t raging homophobes,” Sam said. “I still don’t understand why you thought he’d have any relevant answers.”
The green goo was starting to dry and crust over on Cas’s forehead. The messy locks of his hair looked like they were starting to dry in whatever position the orb had blown them into. And Dean was definitely starting to notice a funky smell settling into the crevices of the Impala as the goo soaked into everything around them. But Cas’s wide, amazing smile made all of those negatives fade away. He really was cute, even when he was covered in disgusting, unidentifiable goo, and if that wasn’t love Dean didn’t know what else to call it.
“Yeah, unless we want to end up shot by some trigger-happy rent-a-cops,” Dean said. “We could always flash our badges to them now.”
He let out a long breath and hissed in pain as his ribs protested the movement when they reached the bottom of the stairs.
“Last one for the day,” Dean said. “After this we’ll grab some food then call Sam and Mom. Maybe they’ve gotten further than we have.”
An embarrassing, fuzzy warmth spread through Dean’s chest. He looked around the bar to see if anyone had noticed him being the weirdo giving his phone heart eyes. The liquid happy in his veins took over as liquid courage and he was typing out
“You ready to go?” the orderly asked as he moved the wheelchair next to the chair where Dean had moved to so he could put his boots on.
Clinging to a ghost was a bizarre, indescribable sensation. Dean could feel the fabric of the ugly trench coat Cas had worn on the funeral pyre beneath his fingers but he was also aware that his hands were holding nothing but dead air in front of him. The cold wasn’t bothering Dean as much anymore. Whether that was because his body was going as numb as his nerves or something else he didn’t really care.
“You were... distracted this morning,” Sam said. “And it’s probably not our kinda thing anyway. If you’re not up for it, we can call someone else to take a look at it. I’m sure Mom knows someone out there.”
“I don’t know what happened here,” Sam said. “But, in our experience, there aren’t that many angels who actually try to protect humans like Cas does. We haven’t met
The case ended up as a simple salt and burn. Still, it lasted long enough that Dean found himself running into Danny and his new family multiple times while investigating. The last time was on his way out of town at a last minute grocery store run. Danny introduced Dean to his son Arthur. By that point Chris had gotten past any suspicion or jealousy he’d initially had towards Dean. They invited him and Sam over for dinner, but Dean declined with a hollow
He let go of the door and grabbed hold of Cas instead. One hand in the angel’s hair the other curled just below his ribcage. Their mouths met a fraction of a second before their bodies. Dean’s fingers tightened reflexively as he kissed Cas with every bit of energy and passion he’d kept locked away for nearly a decade since Cas had pulled him from Hell.
“I didn’t…” Dean’s mouth snapped shut as Cas turned and started making his way down the aisle in the opposite direction. “I never said their music wasn’t good.”
When Cas opened the curtain to the dressing room a few minutes later, Dean’s eyes bulged as he looked Cas over. The dark jeans they’d found fit him everywhere except his thighs which made the fabric stretch to its limits. Over the jeans Cas had slipped on one of his Britney Spears t-shirts. She wore dark eyeliner and a hat that obscured part of her face. The t-shirt also barely fit over Cas’s surprisingly broad shoulders and would probably ride up if he raised his arms.
“I scanned the building and sensed no monsters or ghosts,” Cas said. He turned to the stage without moving away from Dean’s bubble of space. The furrow of Cas’s brow deepened. “And I do not believe the woman singing is a siren... What kind of case is this?”
Dean swallowed hard. His eyes burned as he captured Cas's mouth again. He kissed his thanks into Cas's mouth. His thanks for Cas rescuing him from Hell. For putting up with Dean’s crap for so many years. For just being there even in times when Sam couldn’t even stand to be around him.
Dean let go of Castiel’s hair. He cupped Castiel’s cheek and tilted Castiel’s face so Dean could meet his wandering eyes.
“Come on,” Sam’s words snapped Dean out of his melancholy. “Let’s go get your artery clogging feast out of the way so we can find seats before the theater fills up completely.”
Instead, what Dean got was a lot of old man hunter gossip that made him want to reach through the phone and choke the guy out.
“Dean,” Cas said. His words were calm like the ocean covering a dangerous riptide. “I can understand you wanting to wait to talk, but do you really expect me—us—to wait until we’re back at the bunker to share another kiss? After all this time you want us to wait after one kiss where I was caught off guard?”
They stood there wrapped in memories and each other until Dean’s body couldn’t resist the urge to shiver anymore. It felt like the marrow in his bones was set to vibrate as Cas cupped Dean’s face again and stepped away. Tears burned rivers down Dean’s cheeks as he stared into Cas’s sad, faded blue eyes.
One of the diner’s regulars lifted his coffee mug to signal his need for a refill. Dean nodded in the man’s direction. They were busy today. It wasn’t the time to get lost in daydreaming.
Learning that Ricky was a troubled teen William had taken in under his wing added to those conflicting feelings. Dillon had told Castiel that Ricky was, technically, Ashley’s stepbrother. They were more like friends than siblings, though.
“The Zeppelin one,” Dean said. The teenager stared at him blankly. Dean pressed his lips together for a moment, then tried again. “The Stairway to Heaven one?”
“How do I use this?” Castiel asked. He'd seen the brothers use it a few times over the years, but now that it was in his hands it seemed more confusing than he'd imagined.
That’s what brought him to Boston, Massachusetts to the office of Professor Castiel Krushnic. The professor was, according to Sam’s research, the most well established expert on religious studies in the US. If anyone would be able to help Dean, a lifelong agnostic, sink his teeth into the role of a seminary student questioning his faith after a family tragedy, it would be the professor.
The back of his head slid on a puddle of goo on the driver’s window as he laughed. His jacket made horrible squishing noises as he wrapped his arms around his stomach.
On the drive back to the bunker the whole run in with Danny seemed to really sink in for Dean. At first, Dean was worried that he was actually jealous of Danny’s husband. Eventually he realized he was jealous of Danny’s life. Not the raising a kid part, Dean had more than enough of that with Sam and again with Ben, but the having a partner and being out. Not to mention hearing the news that Danny’s dad had resigned from his job in politics due to realizing he didn’t agree with the principles the Conservative party were fighting for these days. Seeing the old bastard who used to sneer at Dean like he knew where Dean’s hands had wandered on his son’s body playing with his grandson and laughing with his son in law was a shock for Dean.
“Gross,” Sam said. After a moment he leaned closer to Dean and lowered his voice. He gestured at the front of the theater. In each corner there was a security guard. “Looks like someone hired some extra muscle for the evening.”
Dean glanced at the spot Scott had looked at and noticed a foreign light coming from behind something on the mantel. He took a step closer and saw that it was a sigil. A small one that he didn’t recognize, but it was glowing with grace-blue light.
The waitress had stopped by the table a couple more times with more beer and there was a girl with a scratchy voice and an acoustic guitar up on stage when Dean’s phone buzzed on the table. It was a text from Cas. To Dean’s embarrassment, his heart leapt in his chest when he saw the preview of the message on his screen.
“Forgive me if I don’t always pay attention to the things you tell me not to do, Dean,” Cas said. “I couldn’t let you die down here by yourself and you know that.”
“It’s like a creek, but bigger,” Jenny said. “During monsoon season in the summer washes fill up really quick and tend to flood over. If you get stuck in one during a storm, you’re likely to get washed away in a flash flood.”
“I don’t want to fight with you,” Dean said in the lowest whisper he could manage. He barely heard himself speak. He wasn’t positive the words didn’t rattle around in his mind like so many other words he didn’t have the courage to send out through his lips into the world.
Castiel closed the space between them and grabbed a fistful of Dean’s hospital gown. He tugged Dean so they were eye to eye. Nose to nose. Breath tangling in the humid air between them. Close enough to make Dean’s soul ache.
Dean nodded and fixed his attention on the space in front of the screen just a couple rows in front of them. A whisper went through the crowd. The man seated to Dean’s left folded his hands and started to pray again.
The air between them grew heavy and humid. Cas turned toward Dean and brushed the tip of his nose along Dean’s cheek. Dean closed his eyes and Cas started to move them in a circle.
With a resigned expression, Cas lifted his hand and brushed his fingertips to Dean’s forehead. The ice and fire of Cas’s healing grace raced through Dean’s body, focusing mostly on his head. Tingling sensations raced over Dean’s scalp, and his eyes fell closed as he reveled in the sensation.
Dean stared at the steering wheel. Crickets sang outside the car. His mouth opened and closed before he rolled back over to look at Cas.
“There’s no cassette player here. I’ve got it covered though,” Dean said. He pulled out his phone and cued up one of his playlists. The music was upbeat and not something he’d play in Baby or around Sam, but he enjoyed it anyway. He tossed his duffel bag onto the far bed and took Cas's hand. “Now, I’m not great at this, but just follow what I do and how I move. It’ll be close enough.”
He could walk to Baby and sleep in the backseat. Maybe even drive her back to their other motel rooms in Prescott an hour away. Sam would understand why he had to leave. As long as Dean made it back here to pick everyone up in the morning it would be fine.
After they’d loaded up on clothes they toured through the electronics section where Dean found an old video game system for The Dean Cave before moving on to the music section. The box of vinyl records was already picked over pretty well by hipsters, but the cassette tape collection had a few Dean was missing.
Usually, Castiel hated mornings, but the ones that followed a hunt always left him with excess energy to burn and excitement over the next mission. While Dean slept in, Castiel took it upon himself to look for their next case. With a press of a button, his laptop whirred to life. His laptop. Castiel still wasn’t used to having things to call his own. He supposed that novelty would wear off eventually, but for now it gave him a thrill whenever he took note of his own possessions.
“Guess what, Sam,” Dean said. “They may not know what a ghost looks like, but we do. And that? That looks like a fucking ghost.”
Sam’s expression folded into one of disbelief and disgust. “Why the hell would I be texting Jody like that? You know what, no, don’t tell me. I don’t need to know how your brain works.”
He blinked again and found himself staring at the coffee pot as it filled. The smell of warm coffee hung heavy in the air like phantom perfume. A rattling breath seized hold of Dean’s lungs and he squeezed his eyes shut as he gripped the counter in front of him.
. As secrets and betrayals came to light as they always do, no matter how well concealed they seemed to be, they repeated the words.
Dean tore his eyes away. Cas and his guardian angel schtick was exhausting and concerning at the best of times. And this year was nowhere near the best of times.
“I will find a way back to you, Dean,” Cas said. Dean’s knees grew weaker as Cas’s voice gained a strength he hadn’t heard in the angel in years. “Be here when I do.”
Dean rolled over to face Castiel once Castiel was settled in place. There seemed to be a chasm of space between them. Dean chose to ignore why that thought bothered him so much. Instead, he took advantage of the fact that Castiel’s eyes were screwed shut to stare at the angel.
“What is that thing?” Dean asked as he threw the car into gear. His attention flipped from the road to the rear view mirror where he watched Cas studying the glowing orb the size of a basketball they’d found in the old warehouse.
“Bullshit,” Dean said. The secret video calls he could deal with. Sam’s dopey, I’ve got a crush on someone expressions he could tolerate, but this was getting out of hand. “Who was it? Was it Jody?”
They'd never really dated, but Dean didn't know what else to call the first guy he'd made out with and later exchanged handjobs with. Back then Danny was just as deep in the closet as Dean was. The son of a conservative senator and the star of the football team, Danny had more to lose socially if anyone else knew he liked dick. John would have beat Dean bloody if he'd ever gotten confirmation of his suspicions about Dean, but Danny would lose his future.
Dean opened his mouth, ready to launch into a tirade when a hand landed on his shoulder. Sam’s judging face looked down at him as Sam tightened his grip on Dean’s shoulder. Sam apologized to the teen for Dean’s attitude and drug him away from the counter.
“I didn’t yell,” Dean said. He looked around the store trying to find Cas’s unruly mess of dark hair. He spotted the wild hair about three seconds before catching sight of the pile of clothing Cas had cradled in his arms. Dean made his way down one of the narrow aisles, meeting Cas’s smile as he joined Cas in front of a row of hangers. “What’d you find?”
His blue eyes widened as he stared back at Dean. He stared long enough that Dean began to fumble through his mind for a way to smooth over what he’d just admitted. A way to salvage what he’d inevitably just ruined.
“Is that something you’d be more comfortable in?” Dean asked. He gave himself a mental pat on the back for keeping his voice steady. He could be supportive and helpful now and berate himself for being an oblivious asshole later.
Cas pointed at the wall next to the door behind a long glass jewelry case. Sure enough, on the wall above the counter was a Sam-sized poster for Led Zeppelin’s Stairway to Heaven.
“Yeah, I did,” Dean said. Cas’s attention snapped up and he met Dean’s gaze with wide, unblinking eyes. Dean reached over and took hold of Cas’s hand. He wrinkled his nose at the goo congealing between their fingers then forced himself to look away and not think about the feeling. “What do you say we get a separate room tonight?”
Navigating through the bunker took a long time. Or maybe it just felt like it did. Dean was letting Cas take a good deal of his weight now. Cas’s trench coat was surprisingly soft against Dean’s bare chest.
Cas opened his mouth like he was going to speak then looked over Dean’s shoulder. Cas’s eyes shifted like he was watching something that wasn’t in the room with them. He straightened his posture and lifted his chin. For a moment, Dean swore he could see Cas’s wings lifting high and wide behind him. Cas met Dean’s eyes again.
He reached under the driver’s seat and felt around for the bottle of lube he had tucked away in a custom pouch he’d added in a few restorations ago. There was condoms and lube hidden in a couple other well-concealed places in the car that Sam probably didn’t know about. Part of him wished he’d thought to stash a toy or two in the car too, but he didn’t want to push his luck with how observant his brother was or wasn’t lately.
Dean’s stern expression faltered long enough for Castiel to see how happy the simple endearment had made him feel. Dean moved around the table and stole a kiss from Castiel.
“Just another Tuesday in the life of Dean Winchester,” he said with a cocky grin and an ache in his chest.
Castiel made a noise in the back of his throat and turned his head against Dean’s collarbone once more. His body began to shake gently in Dean’s arms. Dean closed his eyes and swallowed hard.
The rest of his words got stuck in his throat. They always did when they meant something. When they meant everything. Instead of speaking, Dean tugged Cas’s wrist until Cas’s hand was back on the side of his head. Dean kept his eyes closed tight. He brushed his thumb over Cas’s inner wrist.
Sam sighed and opened one of his bottled, pre-packaged smoothie drinks. It was green. Dean grimaced as he imagined what it must taste like.
“May we get a copy of this?” Cas asked. He pulled out his cellphone and held it up to Scott. “I’d like to take a picture for reference.”
“You’re quiet,” Cas said. His voice rumbled in his chest as he trailed his fingertips over Dean’s shoulder and back. Dean nuzzled against Cas’s chest and tightened his grip on the angel’s torso. Cas chuckled. “I thought there would be more yelling when we finally found you.”
Dean turned to Cas. “You’ve gotta be more careful, man. We have no idea when Chuck is gonna pull the last of your grace from you. Or turn it into some kind of kill switch or something. You can’t keep risking yourself for me.”
Dean kissed him for all the times when he hadn’t had the courage to tell Cas how much he loved him. Including this moment.
“It helps to have a partner who knows what they’re doing,” Dean said. “Let me guess. He kept stepping on your feet?”
Kissing Cas felt as natural as breathing. Regret at not doing this sooner threatened to taint the moment but Dean shrugged the feeling off as he finally got acquainted with those chapped lips that drove him wild.
“Ignore him,” Sam said. “No, I’m not a creeper. I was thinking of organizing something similar back home, and I wanted to pick her brain about her experience with the process.”
Dean let go of the counter and grabbed a handful of the man’s heavy canvas jacket. He collapsed against the man.
“It’s a little different, but yeah,” Dean said. He changed the playlist on his phone to some slower songs that he may or may not listen to whenever he was thinking too much about his angel and wanting to wallow in the sensation for a while. After a deep breath, he held out his hand. “Come here, Cas.”
“You know that’s not what I meant, Dean,” Cas said. His thumb traced along the curve of Dean’s cheek swiping at Dean’s tears. “I know it hurts.”
He hung up the phone before he could say anything embarrassing like how quiet the bunker was without Cas stalking around it. Or how the guest bedroom kept getting dusty and the bed had stopped smelling like Cas days ago. That would be admitting to too much. Admitting to the fact that he’d gotten into the habit of taking stress naps in there when Cas didn’t answer his phone for a few days at a time or when a nightmare of Cas dying on that ugly couch woke him up screaming.
For the next few minutes the library was silent, save for the flipping of old book pages and Dean shifting his weight in his chair.
Still, that phone call served as a reminder of all the times Dean had spent looking over his shoulder growing up. The years he’d spent worrying that someone was going to see something in Dean’s behavior, in where his eyes wandered, and report it back to John.
“I don’t know what kind of relationship you have with God,” Summer said as she met and held Sam’s gaze. “But He and his angels don’t
The girls exchanged sideways glances then the blonde one nodded at Sam. He pulled out a chair from their table and sat down.
“Mom, just hold on a second,” Sam said. He looked down at the tabletop between them while he tried to gather his thoughts into words. Carefully choosing his words. “Dean’s relationship with Cas is complicated. I don’t think they’ve actually figured out exactly what they mean to each other, and I don’t know if they ever will.” Sam looked Mary in the eye. “But it’s none of our business. I mean, it’s great that you want to be supportive, and I’m sure if they ever figure out their deal with each other, Dean will really appreciate it.”
“You don’t have to stop watching because of me,” Cas said. “I believe there is more to the movie after the credits start.”
Dean sat on the foot of the one of the beds in the hotel room he and Cas rented out that afternoon. When they’d booked their rooms that afternoon, he’d been nervous and excited to share one with Cas.
The fight seemed to last only a few seconds. Their captors were caught off guard by Dean's attack. They were obviously lulled into complacency by Dean and Cas not fighting back for weeks.
He rolled his eyes hard as Jessie answered a phone call from her boyfriend instead of listening to Kim’s story about her trip. How Jessie was still oblivious to the way Kim looked at her was beyond him. He shook his head and kicked up the footrest on the recliner then dug into his snacks. If he had to sit through the rough early parts of this movie to get to the good parts, he was going to do it comfortably.
“Beyonce again?” Dean asked as he settled into a chair across from Castiel. “I thought you were working your way through the Baroque period of classical music or some shit?”
“I knew there was something familiar about you. That sigil getting tripped just confirmed it for me.
Dean would pull Castiel into a quick one armed hug while handing Castiel his morning coffee and whisper the words against the shell of Castiel’s ear.
The smile that spread across Dean’s face was like the sun rising over a nightmare filled night. Dean jumped from his seat while wrestling with his wallet. He threw a few bills on the table before grabbing Castiel’s hand.
“No,” Cas said. “You gave me an excuse and I don’t understand it. Why would I want to bring Ricky up to our room? Why are you trying to run away from me?”
“Dude, I haven’t been able to fit into thrift store clothes since I was sixteen, remember?” Sam nodded at Cas. “Besides, he’s the one who needs clothes. Did you find anything you like, Cas?”
Dean turned his head enough to look at his brother. Sam’s mouth bobbed open and closed like a gasping fish for a moment before he pointed behind himself.
Dean let go of Cas again and put his hands back on the door. He studied the floor between them then looked up into Cas's eyes.
Those same blue eyes with heavy, drugged-out lids and scruffy beard at the end of the world. A longer beard and hospital clothes in the middle of a strange forest. A coat. A tan trenchcoat over an ill-fitting suit. Smooth jawline and smiling eyes that were once so serious.
“I think I saw a flyer for it at the coffee shop,” Scott said. “What does it have to do with Dillon’s death though?”
It was a little weird to watch a movie about Robin Williams dying with the memory of his very real life death so fresh in Dean’s memory. He and Sam had spent many evenings in motels laughing at Robin’s movies, and neither of them had really been in the mood to watch them since the actor had passed.
Ashley and Scott had remained legally married. They’d initially offered to go through with the divorce they’d talked about while Dillon was dead so the three of them would be on equal footing. The ceremony, though not legal, was their way of making their feelings for Dillon clear.
“Do you think it was seeing the family together that triggered you?” Joyce asked. “Do you feel like you have a family out there waiting for you? Or like you might have lost your family before coming here?”
So Dean wasn’t terribly surprised once he got over the initial shock of seeing Danny again to find out the man had never moved very far from his hometown and was happily raising a family in his old stomping grounds. Danny’s son even had the same kindergarten teacher Danny had when he was growing up. To say that concept was a hard one for Dean to grasp was an understatement.
The dungeon was lit no brighter than candlelight, but it looked almost like daylight to Dean’s eyes after being down here for so long. Cas sat with his back against the opposite wall of their cell. His face was bruised, his eyes  closed and his legs were stretched out next to Dean’s. There was an inch or two of space between them that Dean felt like a hot line of want along his thigh.
Sam immediately jumped into explaining the research rabbit hole he’d lost himself in for the last week and a half. The four of them caught up while they finished eating. Mary told them about the werewolf she’d hunted in Utah before coming down to meet them in Arizona. Cas told them about the issues he’d had with the lead on Kelly Kline in New Mexico. She’d bought plane tickets to two different cities in two different regions for the same time. Cas was frustrated that he’d followed up on the wrong flight.
“Want to not sleep together?” Dean asked. He winced at the phrasing and pulled down the blankets on the other side of the bed to make room for Castiel. “Come here.”
Dillon frowned. The lights in the theater flickered around them as the EMF reader screamed in Castiel’s hand. Then two brilliant blue-white wings appeared behind Dillon. Castiel stared at them. They were full, undamaged from the fall unlike his own. Castiel felt a pang of remorse and defeat as he saw a reflection of how he once stood in Dillon’s ghostly form. His own damaged wings curled tight against his back.
“What’s the matter now?” Sam asked from across the library table. His hair was a mess. Nearly as messy as the pile of books, scrolls, and strange stone tablets spread out between them.
Cas looked away and took a step back from Dean. After a moment, he seemed to find the words he was looking for. “Is slow dancing that enjoyable, too?”
Suddenly Cas was deep into Dean’s personal space. A deep breath would make them touch. Dean looked into Cas's eyes and swallowed hard.
“Wait, where the hell are we?” Sam asked from the passenger seat. He’d finally pulled out his earbuds and was looking around the parking lot with a furrowed brow.
“Dean,” Cas said. “Until this morning, I didn’t think angels could even become ghosts. I don’t think we’re dealing with a normal angel here.”
“Smitings like this have saved mine and Dean’s lives a bunch of times,” Sam said, he met Mary’s eyes before continuing. “Cas has saved us many times by smiting people.”
When they reached the theater there was a line wrapping around the building. Dean stopped in his tracks and stared at the line of people with slumped shoulders.
“Dean is very protective of our work,” Cas said. “We’re doing research on some of the local lore for a book.”
Dean made his way to the magazine rack as the door to the restroom closed behind his brother. Dean started to subtly stretch his sore legs as he looked over the selection of magazines. His gaze glided over the ones about guns, hunting, the porn in sealed plastic bags, and the ones about beauty. He lingered for a moment on ones related to cooking and another about home decor. Finally, he spotted a men’s fitness and lifestyle magazine with some ripped action movie star posing on the front. A headline hovered over the guy’s left hipbone which read ‘5 Simple Exercises to Beat Fatigue.’ Dean glanced over his shoulder again before picking up the magazine and flipping through the pages.
Sam’s voice filtered down the hallway. He was talking to someone and laughing, either on the phone or one of those video chats he liked so much. Huh. That was happening more and more often in the last few months.
“I’m telling you Sam, Swayze always gets a pass,” Dean said as he waved his nearly empty beer bottle around.
. The next page looked like Sam had hit ‘print’ on a page of messages from one of those social media sites he seemed to like so much.
He looked at her as he stuffed another bite of pie into his already full mouth. Something told him she wanted to talk and that whatever she wanted to talk about it wasn’t anything he wanted to hear.
“Date night?” Cas asked before looking around the alley. “I wasn’t aware you were on a date with someone.”
Dean lost himself in the kiss. In the feel of Cas’s hands clutching Dean’s hair and back like Dean was something precious and worthy of cradling.
Dean’s pulse picked up. He was thankful the nurse had removed the heart rate monitor from his finger. Shame boiled in his stomach when he realized he was glad Castiel was graceless and couldn't sense Dean’s reaction. He'd stopped trying to figure out for himself if his heart raced because Castiel’s anger scared him or whether it was something… else.
After all the drinking and storytelling, Dean’s lips were dry. His pulse picked up when he saw Cas’s laser focus hone in on Dean’s tongue when he tried to wet them. The air between them grew heavy again as Cas took a step closer. In Dean’s ear, Sam kept droning on.
“You told me that one time when you were drunk after giving me a sloppy kiss on the cheek and then panicking for five minutes about what it meant,” Cas said.
“You look more nervous than I do,” Cas said as he came up behind Dean to adjust his tie in the hotel bathroom mirror. “Isn’t walking the red carpet part of your job?”
until Castiel was able to ignore the blood stains on Dean’s shirt long enough to nod and get into the Impala.
Dean narrowed his eyes and turned in his seat to watch Ricky leave. The waiter was swinging his hips as he walked. Any other time it would be mesmerizing, today it made Dean's stomach sour with something that tasted like jealousy.
“Nothing’s the matter,” Dean said as he flipped another page in the book in front of him. He’d been through this one three times today so far. There was nothing here. “I love research.”
“My son has feelings for another man or angel or whatever and he’s hiding it from me,” Mary said. “Like I said, I don’t understand you boys, but doesn’t he know that I’d support him?”
The tips of Castiel’s shoes moved into Dean’s line of sight. He closed his eyes and let his head fall farther forward. He’d spent hours mentally building himself up for a scolding conversation with Sam, who was supposed to pick him up from the hospital, he wasn’t prepared to deal with Castiel right now.
What was supposed to be just one lunch meeting to take general notes about the role and questions Dean could focus on when finding his character’s motivation turned into regular visits, phone calls, emails, and late nights staring at the ceiling of whatever room Dean was living out of at the time thinking about something Cas had said.
He must have fallen asleep sometime after that, because the next thing he noticed, the laptop was off and Cas was trying to slip out of the bed.
Maybe he’d head into town for food. Or meet up with Rowena and Eileen for a hunt to get away from home for a while. Something told him the honeymoon stage was just beginning now that Sam had apparently stumbled on their not-so-secret secret.
The stairs took a little longer than normal to navigate, but Dean wasn’t complaining. Not when Cas was freely touching him like this. Not when Dean felt so terrible after the fight with the spry ghost who’d tossed him around like a fucking rag doll.
Finally, Castiel caught sight of Dean huddled over a bottle of cheap whiskey in a little two person booth on the far wall of the bar.
They stopped at a Gas-N-Sip outside of Prescott a few hours before the movie. After they filled up Baby with gas, they ventured inside for directions, snacks, and a restroom break.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “And it looked a hell of a lot like you were trying to get yourself killed in the middle of his revenge kick.”
Three hours after leaving the diner, Dean parked the Impala down the street from their last obituary lead. Cas was in the passenger seat, getting more and more frustrated with each fruitless interview.
Silence came from Cas’s end of the call. Silence that was deep enough and long enough that Dean pulled the phone away from his ear to make sure the call hadn’t dropped.
“Fuck, okay, you’ve made your point,” Dean said. He stared up at Baby’s headliner as he struggled to swallow against the lump in his throat.
, Cas?” Dean asked as he scrambled to shove himself back into his jeans. His cock protested mightily and refused to soften regardless of any embarrassment he should be feeling in that situation. He finally got his fly secured over his hard-on and flopped back against the driver’s door. “When did you start being able to fly again?”
Five hours later, Dean was counting out his tips at a booth. His cup of coffee and slice of pie sat on the table next to his pile of crumpled ones and fives.
With his eyes closed Dean could almost pretend that he’d worked up the stones to pull Cas this close when Cas was still alive. When they were both alive enough to feel it.
“You want to share a room with just me,” Cas said. Dean nodded. Cas’s lips stared to curl at the edges. “Because you think I’m cute?”
He made his way down the stairs and proceeded toward the kitchen. Light and shadows poured through the doorway letting him know someone was up and moving around in there. It was probably Dean.
Dean saw movement to his left. Sam walked toward him and held up their tickets between two of his fingers. Dean nodded at him.
“It always does.” Dean started to lift his hand to take the towel from Cas, but Cas waved him away and stepped in close. He was between Dean’s knees. If Dean wanted to see his face, he had to lift his chin to do it.
“Not directly, no,” Nicole said. “She’s close friends with the woman behind it, Summer Bloom. It’s Summer’s baby, she spent the past year trying to get it organized. Carolynn helped out now and again, but she’s more involved with her charity work than this.”
“Did someone hurt you?” Joyce asked. “Did one of the customers threaten you or something to trigger a panic attack like that?”
broke records in the box office. By the time award season came around Dean’s name was brought up repeatedly as a highly probable win. Cas went with him to the award shows and Dean was able to show Donna, and the rest of the world, that he’d put a ring on it.
“All I’m saying is that pretty soon everyone I know is going to be settled down while I’m still out here alone and aging,” Dean said. “Next thing i know you’re going to be hanging out with some hot piece of ass instead of me. Then I
“Huh? Oh, nothing, I guess,” the hunter said. “I thought you’d like to know. Figured if anyone could convince her to come back to team dick it’d be you. John Winchester’s pride and joy, am I right? You want her number?”
Dean turned away. He needed to find a quiet spot to make his call to Cas. There was good chance he wouldn’t even answer when Dean called, he was a busy angel these days, but Dean didn’t want the background noise making his voicemail indecipherable. And if Cas did pick up, Dean didn’t really want all the noise distracting him from what Cas had to say.
“Just one more second... okay, I’ve got it,” Sam said. “You need to press the top engraving and left center engraving at the same time. Those should be the kill switch.”
Dean dropped his head back to stare at the ceiling and groaned. “At least tell me you’ve found a case or, hell, even a farmers market convention thing three states over you’ve always wanted to visit. I’m going out of my mind here, Sam.”
Dean bit his tongue, literally, to keep himself from saying he’d been waiting for Cas to ask him that for years.
Dean swallowed. Was this Cas’s way of telling him something? Had they incorrectly assumed Cas’s gender for years just because of Jimmy’s vessel? Shit like this made him miss his Charlie even more. Not that the one they’d rescued with the group from the apocalypse world wasn’t great in her own right, but she wasn’t the Charlie Dean knew. She wasn’t the person Dean could call up in a panic because he just realized he’d mistaken his boyfriend’s gender for years and how do you go about making up for something like that?
He stared at Castiel’s face. Took in the pinched, troubled wrinkle between his brows and the glassiness of his blue eyes. Dean’s chest ached.
They walked down the sidewalk toward the last house on their list. Every few steps, their hands brushed against one another. The ache in Dean’s chest from their phone call the night before returned. He watched Cas from the corner of his eye. If the angel felt anything similar from their touch, he didn’t let it reflect on his face.
Dean turned into the parking lot he’d seen online. He passed the old tire shop and a martial arts studio aimed at kids. The remnants of a long abandoned K-Mart sign hung across the front of the strip mall in front of them. To the right of the abandoned store was a sign that read
“That’s a lie,” Cas said. “The last person who walked in on you having sex was the female roommate of a man you went home with at a bar three months ago and you both invited her to join in.”
Dean tightened his grip on Cas’s hand and held the door to the thrift store open for him. Cas gave him a small smile as he brushed against Dean’s chest while walking through the door. Dean followed after with his own growing smile. This whole thing between them, the thing where they held hands and kissed, was still new and left Dean breathless more often than not.
One last look around the room confirmed it was devoid of any evidence he’d even been there. He would drop his room key off in Sam and Mary’s room then go to the car. He’d figure out everything else from there.
“I’m peachy,” Dean said as he stopped the movie as the credits began to roll. Usually he’d watch through the credits for the bloopers of the girls cracking jokes between takes, but he wasn’t in the mood today. He glanced at Cas as he returned to the main screen on the movie program.
“Oh, Dean.” Cas had Dean’s shirt balled up in his hands, but his attention was settled on the blossoming bruise on Dean’s ribs.
When they reached Dean’s room, and he was able to sink down onto his precious memory foam, Dean sighed in relief.
Dean looked away from Donna to catch Cas’s eye. It was against the rules of dealing with the press, but this was something that felt more important than his career at the moment, and hopefully Donna would understand.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked as he returned his attention to the path they were cutting through the woods.
It was impossible for Dean not to comply with Cas’s request. He turned, trailing his fingers along the edge of the countertop for some sense of stability as Cas’s ghostly form took shape in front of him. Dean grabbed hold of the counter behind him as his knees threatened to give out once he was facing fully forward. This was his fault.
Dean clenched his teeth. Part of him wanted to speed up even more. Make the kid chase after him or maybe even lose track of him for a minute. Maybe that would change things. At the very least it would delay any discussions Sam had in mind.
“Cas,” Dean said as he fished a bottle of water out of the mini fridge next to one of the many bookcases in the library. He set the bottle down in front of Cas with a thud. “Drink.”
They both knew Cas’s grace wasn’t up to healing Dean at the moment. Not since Chuck had started fucking with Cas from a distance. And with Jack out of town with Sam and Eileen, that left Dean needing regular first aid.
He read through what Sam had printed out. It was a newspaper clipping about mysterious technical difficulties that took place at a small town theater during a recent film festival showing of the 90’s John Travolta film,
The door opened again as Dean finished lacing up his boots. Castiel was glaring at the orderly with the wheelchair like glaring would make the man move faster. Dean bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from grinning.
“I need a moment,” Cas said before making his way to the front door and ducking outside. Dean watched him go with a lump in his throat and a twist in his chest.
Cas turned to Dean again with narrowed eyes. “I thought you didn’t want me to risk myself to heal you.”
His orgasm took him by surprise. One moment he was sucking on Cas’s lower lip, the next his muscles pulled tight as he started to come. His mouth went slack against Cas’s as the orgasm rolled through him.
“Those are bloopers,” Dean said. Then he turned to frown at Cas. “Wait, how do you know there’s more to the movie?”
Dean stared at the far wall over Cas’s shoulder while the angel lifted the fabric. When Cas reached Dean’s ribs, he tapped the uninjured side with his finger to signal to Dean that he needed Dean to raise his arms higher.
“Well, that asshole was a bust,” Dean said. He took a seat across from Sam and kicked his feet up on the table. “Let’s never call him again, by the way. Homophobic piece of shit was trying to pimp me out so I could fuck the gay out of some hunter chick.”
Dean rolled his eyes and started to look over his own menu. He should pick out some food for Cas too. He didn’t really eat food now that he was an angel again, but it was easier on the rest of them if they didn’t have to explain why their dorky friend only wanted coffee while the rest of them feasted.
Dean studied his brother for a moment, then shoved his chair back and casually grabbed his jacket and made a b-line for the stairs.
They laid there in silence for a while. Dean’s eyelids got heavy and his breath began to slow. He continued to trace Castiel’s cheekbone with his thumb as his body relaxed into the memory foam.
The first time he’d bottomed for someone happened in this car. He hadn’t lost all of his virginities here, but there’d been a lot of memorable nights and morning afters regardless.
One of those blades appearing in the middle of the man’s chest. Dean’s own voice screaming in desperate agony. Blue-white light pouring from the man’s chest, eyes, mouth. Dean hitting his knees in the sand next to the man’s prone body.
“Well, according to the lore, it’s some kind of security system,” Sam said. “I think it’s Lovecraftian.”
“No,” Dean said. “Nothing more than what we saw last night when the movie finished. The angel didn’t show up again when we were there.”
An older woman with short, white blonde hair, gold rimmed eyeglasses, and red lipstick sat at a table near the coffee bar. Her back was straight. Her hands were wrapped around a large, white mug of coffee on the table in front of her. She was staring at the front door of the cafe. When she spotted Sam and Mary, she lifted one hand and waved at them both.
Sam stared at Dean with his mouth open for a moment before snapping his mouth shut and shaking his head.
Cas nodded and grabbed the towel he’d tossed onto the pillow. He dipped it into the water, then squeezed out the excess. Then he approached Dean, holding the towel up. “Ready? This might sting a little.”
The chuckling slowed until there was nothing but a smile—and a ton of goo—on Dean’s face. He looked Cas over. His trenchcoat was stained with the weird green goo. The dress shirt and tie looked more mint green and teal than white and blue. Somehow, Cas’s hair was messed up and sticking up every which way like he used to wear it when they’d first met.
Cas stood on the other side with his own room key in one hand. It looked like he’d been fidgeting with it for a while.
“I don’t understand how you and Sam can come so close to dying so often and just keep going like nothing happened.” Castiel’s brow furrowed. His eyes danced back and forth like he was trying to read the secrets Dean had written on his soul. “How do you do it?”
Sam was trying to hide one of his dopey looking smiles and staring at his laptop screen when Dean finally entered the library. Probably a video chat, then. He idly wondered who Sam was talking to, but figured it wasn’t worth starting a fight over if Sam wasn’t ready to talk about it. Dean would wait until Sam stopped trying to hide the conversations first.
“Yes, Cas,” Dean said. “That’s exactly what I expected you to do. That’s what I wanted you to do so that more people wouldn’t be dead right now.”
“I thought I was the only human down here associating with angels,” Scott said. “I should have known those twisted fucks would stoop low enough to hire on mortal muscle to assist in their dirty work.”
Dean reached over to turn up the radio to discourage Sam from trying to continue the conversation. All Dean needed right now was to work this case. Find this angel who was causing a scene, kick its feathery ass, and get back to the bunker before the outside world started to wear away at Dean’s patience as much as being cooped up in the bunker had.
“Dean, I won’t last here much longer. Between the beatings and the warding…” Cas shook his head and burrowed against Dean’s right arm. “I’m surprised I’m not already dead.”
Cas pressed more of his weight into Dean’s arm that was wrapped around his lower back. “As long as you don’t make me talk to any of them, I won’t have to run away screaming and leave you here to fend for yourself.”
Dean returned his attention to the sandwich ingredients he had spread out on the counter. Peanut butter and jelly. Of course it was peanut butter and jelly.
“Help me to my room?” Dean asked. It was amazing that he could talk with his heart lodged in his throat like it was.
He looked down at his hands. His knuckles were swollen and raw. The ghost had gotten corporeal enough for Dean to get a few good sucker punches in between getting his ass kicked. It was pure dumb luck the ghost had thrown him in the direction of Dean’s fallen lighter when he had. Things could have gone much, much worse.
“Yes,” Castiel said as if it was an obvious choice. “I would have reached the hospital much earlier this morning, but it was very hard to find somewhere that sold these… CDs.”
Dean chuckled and tilted his head so that Castiel’s hair was no longer trying to climb into his mouth and nose. Dean wrapped one arm around Castiel’s upper back. The other he wrapped beneath Castiel’s head so his fingers could resume carding through Castiel’s hair.
“Cas, wait.” Dean barely managed to push the door to their motel room closed again. He bracketed his arms around Cas. It took his full body weight leaning on the door to discourage Cas from ripping it open. His breath gathered in a bundle of nerves in his chest, and his next words rushed out in a panic. “Cas, please.”
“No,” Cas said with all the holy vengeance he used to keep on tap years ago when they’d first met. It was like hearing a ghost of a ghost in that determined voice. “It was a gift and I intend to keep it.”
“Don't,” Dean said as he finally tore his attention from the floor to Castiel’s pitying eyes. “Don't you dare tell me it isn't my fault. If I hadn't let that son of a bitch get the drop on me we would have ganked its ass like we were supposed to and someone else wouldn't be dead right now!”
“Dean had a lot of friends at that age. He was a sensitive little boy, but eager to get to know everyone he came across. It seemed like every day he had five new best friends,” Mary said. “But one day he came home to tell me all about this boy in class. That boy was the first friend Dean talked about regularly.”
He shook his head and winced at the spike of pain the movement drew out of the cut on his forehead. He gritted his teeth and clenched the edge of the mattress tight. His scabbed over knuckles and tan fingers stood out in stark contrast from the white sheets.
This was one of those moments—if Cas were still alive and not a ghost or hallucination like he was at the moment—that Dean’s lips would positively ache with the urge to close the distance between them and claim Cas’s mouth in a kiss. He idly wondered if this is what grief induced madness felt like. If it was it figured that his brain still wouldn’t let him lean forward or to say the three little words he should have shouted from the rooftops when Cas was still alive to hear them.
“I can’t leave. I’m trapped in this nightmare,” Dillon said. He began to fly in sporadic lines. First left, then right. Over Dean and Castiel then closer to the screen and back again. “A nightmare. Not a dream at all. No more dreaming. An endless nightmare.”
Dean unwrapped himself from Cas and took hold of his hand instead. Then led the way to the wall of press outlets towards one of Dean’s favorite journalists.
“Because of you and Sam and mom,” Dean said. “Because of the people we save and the people we…” Dean swallowed. “And the people we couldn’t save. The people we got killed. I owe it to all of you, to all of them to keep going. Sometimes I forget that or that answer stops working and I lose my way, but you and Sam. You guys are always there to help me find my way back.”
“How?” Castiel asked as they reached the stairs. He looked over his shoulder at Dean and shook his head. “How can you wake him?”
“I know that,” Dean said. “But unless you can tell me it’ll end before tomorrow morning, I’d like to spend a little time enjoying what we’re trying to save.”
He wasn’t sure how to explain his motives for wanting to leave Dean and Cas alone for a while to his mom.
“It's a better option than throwing around holy oil or trying to stab air with an angel blade,” Dean said. “Besides, if we can get him to go home instead of haunting this place without destroying him it's probably a good thing.”
“Are y’all locals or just passing through?” Ricky asked. The question was posed to the table at large, but Ricky only had eyes for Cas.
“That shouldn't have been surprising,” Cas said. “We found out quickly how much the warding suppressed my grace. Why did today make you fight back?”
“I don’t know, Joyce,” Dean said. “One minute I was fine. I’d just cashed out a table and wished the family goodnight. Then the next thing I knew I couldn’t breathe and I ran to the restroom, so I didn’t scare any of the customers.”
“When Sam first started coming with dad and I on hunts, he had nightmares,” Dean said. Castiel’s movements stilled enough to let Dean know that he was listening. “We came up with a… I don’t know what you’d call it. A mantra, I guess. Just a few words I’d tell him when he woke up from those nightmares to help him calm down. Help him keep his head in the game.”
“Seriously though,” Dean said as he gave Cas a slow kiss. “Let’s set these jeans aside as special occasion jeans, okay?”
Dean started off down the hallway. From the sound of stomping feet, Cas was quick on Dean’s heels. An iron-like grip took hold of Dean’s arm and spun him around.
When Cas came back into the infirmary, he was stubbornly carrying five things at once. The sight made Dean laugh and then immediately regret that decision when it made his ribs ache.
over and over against each other’s skin. They shared breath. They traded pleasure as their bodies moved together slowly and of their own accord, kissing through it all as they both came in their boxers. They stripped each other of their soiled clothes and traced the lines of their bodies with fingertips, palms, and lips.
“Dillon had a… complicated relationship with religion and God,” Scott said. “He was a believer, but his belief was very pessimistic and lost. One time he got drunk while we were on leave and ranted for an hour about God abandoning us and how following orders was too difficult and cold blooded sometimes.”
“I started feeling like a piece of meat. Or a cardboard cutout,” Dean said. “I wanted to branch out so I begged for the chance to play Jimmy and once I got it I was terrified. Hell, I’m still scared about what people will think of it. That’s why I’ve got my emotional support here with me on the red carpet tonight.”
“Dean?” Another voice asked. This one was deeper than the other man’s voice. Tears sprung in Dean’s eyes and threatened to spill onto his cheeks.
When Sam got back from his run the bunker was quiet. Not quite as quiet as when he’d left, but the hushed murmurs of early morning conversations always sounded a little different than mid-day ones.
The lights in the theater dimmed. A murmur ran through the crowd and a voice came over the speakers. “And now, for our feature presentation.”
Being injured like this sucked. Not just because of the pain, but also because it wrecked Dean’s filters on things like his ridiculous feelings for the angel in front of him. It was in moments like this where Dean found himself falling into Cas’s eyes like they were the ocean on a hot summer day.
Cas pulled a hanger off the metal rack in front of him and held it up at arm’s length. “Do you think this would fit me?”
“I’m fine,” Dean said immediately. He caught himself in the lie and sighed. He took a sip of his coffee and settled back into the padded seat of the booth. “It’s been awhile since we’ve seen either of them.”
The lights in the theater flickered bright, then brighter. Huge, blue-white wings stretched out from the angel’s back.
“Dean,” Cas whispered against Dean’s cheek. His chapped lips brushed over Dean’s stubble and the sensation made Dean’s knees weak.
They squatted on the other side of the bush where the body lay partially submerged in the shallow wash. Only the victim’s legs were in the bush with his left foot exposed to the side where Sarah must have seen him. The corpse’s hair was damp, strands of it clung to his forehead framing his eyes like macabre curlicues. Deep, charred black pits filled the spaces where his eyes used to be.
The cafe was only a couple blocks from the movie theater in the middle of the historic district in town. A poster advertising the festival hung on the wall just inside the glass door on the wall of the cafe. Art from what Sam assumed were local artists lined the walls.
Half the bar--Ash, Jo and Ellen being the loudest--whooped and hollered in the background in celebration of them two of them finally figuring their shit out.
Dean stared at his food and hoped that the conversation would die before someone asked him to elaborate. Luckily, Sam was able to distract their mom with an unrelated question Dean didn’t really pay attention to.
“He’s not my…” Dean closed his mouth with an audible click when he saw Sam’s reaction to Dean’s words. “Fine, but don’t bitch at me later about how I left all the ‘hard work’ to you.”
“Right,” Sarah said. “Anyway, I saw something in the bushes. At first I thought it was some garbage or someone’s bag that they forgot. But, when I got closer, I realized it was so not that.”
Dean studied the glimpse of sky above them between the tree tops trying to find a recognizable star or planet to navigate by once the sun was gone.
Dean pressed a hand to his ribs on the right side of his chest and groaned. Why did the bunker have so many stairs? You’d think the Men of Letters would have had the forethought to install some kind of magic elevator. He leaned against the wall and rested his head. Maybe he could hang out up here for a little while. Get his strength back before making his way down the stairs. Less chance of ending up as a pile of broken bones that way. Well, more broken bones, if the ache in his ribs was anything to go by.
He shifted his bounty of snacks and drinks in his arms so he could reach the doorknob leading to The Dean Cave. He kicked the door shut behind him after flipping on the lights.
“Are we seriously listening to genie in a fucking bottle right now?” Dean asked. Sam cackled in the passenger seat. His forehead was nearly on the dashboard as he clutched his stomach and laughed. Dean glared at his brother for another moment before turning the glare towards the rearview mirror and his boyfriend staring placidly at him from the back seat. “What the fuck, Cas?”
Castiel would lean in and repeat the words against Dean’s cheek while Dean flipped through books from the library while researching the next monster of the week.
The mischievous glint in Cas’s eye made Dean want to rush through this opening night bullshit so that he could get the professor alone again as soon as possible.
He reached out and hooked a finger in Cas’s shirt, somewhere around the angel’s bellybutton. He tugged until Cas was closer. Close enough that they were sharing breath, and the only thing Dean could really see were those blue eyes.
“Brothers and sisters,” a female voice said from somewhere in the middle of the circle. “Last weekend, God sent one of his angels here to watch over our film festival. That angel brought us a message. A message about the blasphemy Hollywood feeds us.”
Dean shook his head. “This case. It’s fucking with my head too much, dredging up all kinds of memories, and I don’t know if I’m in the right place to do this right now.” He paused. “No, I know I’m not.”
Dean alternated between carding his fingers through Castiel’s hair and massaging his scalp as he spoke. He repeated the words until his mouth began to dry and his voice turned hoarse. He repeated the words until Castiel’s breathing slowed and the shaking in his bones stopped.
“I didn’t know angels could become ghosts,” Mary said loud enough to talk over Dean and Sam’s argument over the name.
Cas shifted on Dean’s lap until his own erection was pressed against Dean’s hip, making Dean moan into Cas’s mouth as they continued to kiss. Dean hoped this wouldn’t be the only time they got to do this. The list of things he wanted to do to and with Cas was too long and varied for it to only happen once.
“Really?” Summer asked. Her eyes widened, an expression amplified by the glasses she wore. She cleared her throat and nodded slowly. “Well, it’s been interesting meeting you both, but I believe I have another engagement to get to. Best of luck with your research.”
With a soft sigh, Dean let himself fall forward until his forehead was pressed against Cas’s chest. Here, cupped in Cas’s warmth, everything felt better. Safe.
“Come on, it’s not like these kind of lists matter anyway,” Sam said. “It’s not like you’re actually going to meet Patrick Swayze and even if you did it’s not like he’d ask you back to his room. What does it even matter if you have a list of celebrities you’d go gay for?”
Dean stared back at him with an expression Castile couldn’t quite pin down. It had hints of the reverence and extreme gratitude Castiel had first seen on Dean’s face when they met.
Cas was gorgeous, insanely smart, and had the driest humor of anyone Dean had ever met. The combination left Dean stumbling over his words like all of the airhead pretty boys he’d played in movies.
“Oh,” Cas said again, stronger this time in a voice filled with wonder and joy. “I love you too, Dean.”
and then nothing. For a full hour. They’d been staring at each other for a full fucking hour and Sam was starting to lose his mind.
“You were calling me,” Cas said. “It sounded urgent. I haven’t tried to fly since... I haven’t tried in a while, but you sounded troubled so I came as fast as I could.”
Classic rock love songs blasted through the old speakers from the jukebox in the corner. Castiel smiled to himself when he realized he recognized the song as one of Dean’s favorites.
Dean drank his water and tried not to think about how gross and domestic this was. Gross in the literal way and in the cheek warming, heartbeat pounding rom-com kind of way. No one had ever taken such delicate care of Dean the way Cas did. Not since Dean was a toddler.
“I, uhm...” Cas looked down for a moment then looked out the window above Dean’s head. “I finished already. When you were... orgasming.”
It’d been awhile since he and Dean had come across someone who’d called either of them crazy to their faces for asking questions. The time spent between those encounters usually helped Sam feel like he could pretend to be normal when interacting with strangers. Interviews going south like this always left him feeling like he was wearing a nametag that read ‘freak’ on his lapel.
If Dean were here by himself, this was the kind of guy he’d be trying to get a phone number from. The kid looked like he could give the memory of Lisa a run for her money in the bendy sex department.
He did not watch Castiel walk out of the hospital room. He finished buttoning his blue and green flannel and did not let himself rub at the ache in his chest.
When the kissing slowed down to a more languid, sleepy pace, their fingers found each other and intertwined. They fell asleep tangled together as close as their souls had always begged them to be.
Dean led the way out of the diner and into the parking lot. He smiled to himself when he saw Cas’s truck parked next to the Impala. It was a bit of an odd match, but they looked good together.
They parted ways once inside the little convenience store attached to the gas station. Sam headed toward the far wall where a sign advertised healthy foods. Dean veered left, picking up a hand basket. He grabbed whatever snacks caught his eye.
Different voices called out his name in his memories—even those he’d never given his real first name to--high pitched voices, breathy voices, scratchy voices, deep voices all blended together until they started to sound like one specific voice.
Dean closed his eyes and let himself press a ghosted kiss into Castiel’s hair as he drifted off to sleep again.
“Hurry it up, will ya?” Dean said with a shuddering smile. “It’s too fucking quiet here without you.”
Dean closed his eyes and tipped his head back against the dungeon wall. Cas’s words seemed to echo on the stone around them and through the corners of Dean’s mind.
“What took you guys so long?” Sam asked when he spotted them. “There’s only so long I can stand here without someone thinking I’m a creeper and it’s way to hot to go back to the car.”
He fumbled for the light and blinked bleary eyed at his bedroom. Everything was exactly where he left it. Weapons and books on his shelves. The normalcy of it all was simultaneously soothing and grating. They’d nearly lost Castiel forever and if they had, Dean’s room would still be just as he’d left it.
“Do you know who is in charge of the festival?” Sam asked. “Is it a private party or a local church? We’d like to talk with the organizers.”
“I can’t believe someone torched a guy in our town,” the second kid said. Her blonde hair swished over her tattooed shoulders as she shook her head in disbelief.
The good part about rewatching a movie you knew and loved was Dean knew exactly when everything would happen and could repeat every corny line. The bad part about rewatching a favorite movie is he knew everything that was going to happen so his mind wandered a lot.
“Sorry,” Scott said with a shake of his head. He handed Cas the mug of coffee and turned to grab another for himself from the counter. “The way you speak, Agent Rollins. It reminds me of Dillon.”
Of course, Sam had worked up suspicions during their hunt. He kept trying to talk about feelings on the drive home. Dean’s ears didn’t stop ringing from the music he’d turned up to drown out that disaster of a conversation for at least a couple hours after they’d gotten back to the bunker.
Castiel continued to stand in the doorway. His eyes flicked from Dean’s face, around Dean’s room and back again. Dean continued to watch him. Memorize the way he stood there whole and unharmed and alive.
Dean pushed off the wall and stepped into Cas’s personal bubble. Cas cocked his head to the side like he was listening to Sam rant in Dean’s ear.
The red carpet was a madhouse just like every other red carpet Dean had ever walked. Only this time all of the attention was focused on Dean alone instead of whoever the actual stars of the movie he was featured in were.
Dean stared up into Cas’s eyes. Maybe it was the concussion or exhaustion kicking in. Maybe it was a trick of the light or Cas’s grace showing off, but Dean thought he could see a halo of light flaring out behind Cas’s head.
“Like the man who runs the theater? He did help me get permission to show the films and contacted the company to make up the posters.”
The ghost in the theater had appeared far across the room from where Sam and Dean sat, but Dean was sure the ghost they were looking for belonged to Dillon Bonner.
Jenny threw her arms around Sarah’s shoulders. She tilted her head to the side and grinned. “I’m so lucky you love me.”
Dean scraped a handful of goo from his right eye and squinted at Sam. His hair was plastered to his face and neck. A few locks of it were cured up over his nose and around his chin like his hair was blown forward in the shockwave of the explosion.
Jo caught his eye from across the bar where she was taking a small table’s orders. She smiled in his direction before turning her attention back to her customers. Ash and Ellen were stationed behind the bar flirting with people and filling drink orders, respectfully.
Castiel broke off their kiss, but before Dean could protest or respond to Sam, Castiel did it for him. Dean’s eyes widened as he realized Castiel was flipping Sam off.
“I don’t know, man,” Dean said. “I’m just not in the mood for Valentine’s Day this year. What with Sam meeting Eileen, Bobby and Ellen finally getting together. I’m pretty sure my mom is dating again. Hell, even Charlie has a girlfriend she refuses to introduce to me yet. I just...”
“Coffee,” Mary said as she wrapped her hands around her mug and lifted it so she could drink. She hummed happily. “That’s not half bad.”
“Clearly you’ve never been a closeted bisexual man, Agent Jones,” Scott said. “We got together young, and her mother is a born again Christian who never liked me or approved of Ashley’s choices in life. Us getting married had as much to do with getting wrapped up in the whirlwind of young love as it did saving ourselves from outside forces.”
Ellen studied him for a moment, then nodded. “I’ll have Jo bring out some burgers for the both of you.”
“Dammit Dean, where the hell are you going?” Cas asked. His blue eyes sparked like an electric storm.
Movement on Dean’s left caught his attention. Cas settled onto the stool next to Dean and looked around the building with narrowed eyes. His hair was a wild mess and his coat could use another good wash. Maybe Dean could convince Cas to let him take it to the dry cleaners with their Fed suits instead of using his mojo to clean it.
