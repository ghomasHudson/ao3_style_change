The phone chirped, Jack looked down at it, “Dean says Cas picked the one from the store.” It beeped again, “Dean says ‘he looks better in it anyways.’”
Finally, there was the time he tore another hole in the universe and dragged one Mary Winchester, thirty strangers, and two sad, broken-hearted stray dogs back through. They found homes for the strangers, and the dogs (Foghorn was more than enough for the five of them) and kept Mary for as long as she could bear to stay in one place. It was okay. She always came back.
“I… God Cas I was awful to the poor kid.” He whispered, “I just… couldn’t and now he’s...” Dean hunched in, haunted and broken.
Jack nodded, “I know John was bad. Dean doesn’t talk about a lot of things, I think he should. It makes Father worry a lot. And my research says it helps.” He sat up a little, “What about Mary?”
“I don’t think Dean ever feels safe.” Jack said flatly as he jumped out of the car. Sam thought he might have sounded bitter.
“Dean shoves them in a box and keeps them like a scrapbook under his bed.” Cas replied as he sank into the bed and started to dig around in the duffel. “Puts little tags on them with the years and what happened. Like a science display but sentimental.”
Cas flung words like atonement and penance and burn-out like a star’s light in its death throes. Like drops of blood at a vampire’s feast; dark and aching and as pale as death. When they left the angel’s eyes were rimmed with dark purple, bruises like twin nebulas.  It was his last day at work.
Jack beamed. It was good to have Cas back, good to meet him and hug him and finally have someone to ask about the nature of his passive powers. The things he just did automatically but might seem invasive or bad. It wasn’t late, but he had stayed awake from most of Sam and Dean’s hunt, just in case something bad happened, and then stayed awake because something bad
Dean picked at his toast for a few minutes, causing Jack and Sam to cast him worried glances as they made the final preparations. Neither of them had expected Dean to eat it, but they had hoped. Just as Sam had hoped when he found the jam; it reminded him of something Dean used to get for him when they were kids. He had liked it then, or at least acted like he had. But Dean had acted like he liked or despised things for Sam’s sake all their lives. Enough that sometimes Sam thought, fleetingly, that the brother he knew was nothing more than a guise and what thing underneath was far too unknowable for him to comprehend.
The hunter nodded minutely, but only tightened his hold. Castiel relaxed into it, let Dean hold him close for as long as he needed to. Lingered there when he released him so Dean would know it was okay.
“It’s this or the car, dude. And its gonna get down to -15 tonight, so you’re just gonna have to deal.”
It rolled to a stop and he stared at Dean through the windshield. Willed the hunter to believe he was there, needed him to believe Cas was real so the angel could believe it was true. Time seemed to slow.
“I thought you would have taught him.” Cas said wryly, breaking off the kiss. He kept the hunter in his grasp until he pulled away like he had been burned.
But he would never forget the way Jack had frowned at him before he left, the way he’d looked him up and down and then right into his eyes, the intense worry in his face and quietness in his voice as he said, “Be safe, Dean.”
Jack reached over and plucked the phone from the cupholder, “It’s from Dean. That’s a terrible password, by the way.”
Probably full of germs as well, but he shoved that part of his brain into it’s box. He had learned to ignore it while he was growing up—he couldn’t cleanse hotels and couldn’t change his situation.
He crept to the closet to dig through Dean’s bag to steal a shirt, but Dean padded up behind him and tugged on his sleeve twice. The “take this off” sort of tug. Castiel complied and was soon tucked against Dean’s chest, safe and warm under the blankets, his trench coat stretched over them both. Lamplight illuminated the hunter’s shirt and his hand where it was tangled once more in Cas’ coat and pressed against the angel’s chest. Still making sure Cas was real.
She had been trying to fix Dean, Sam realized now. To rectify the Dean her husband had torn to shreds and an angel had stitched together with the innocent little 4-year-old who wanted to work on cars and bake lots of pie and always smiled at the boy across the street. She didn’t know Sam before; she had no idea what their father had raised him into because she did not know who he could have been. But it still hurt.
“You had Sam before.” Cas snapped, his voice wavered as it rose, “I know what you did, Dean. I know that you had a vial of drugs and a vial of water. You did it right in front of Sam. I had to listen to him watch you die. I had to listen to him panic. I had to listen to him apologize TO ME because he couldn’t keep you alive. I couldn’t do damn thing, you
Dean was hollow. He waited for Sam to return and knew that his brother would come back empty-handed. His chest
The kid tilted his head curiously, “Is it the same reason you wanted them to be alone together for the case?”
Not that it mattered. Cas would have turned away if he was only a few feet away. Because sometimes when Sam asked him to talk it sounded like “get out” too.
“I was always waiting for it to happen again. For you to… At the bunker.” The angel fidgeted with his sleeve, his coffee abandoned. He did not look up. He knew Dean was staring at him, he could feel the heartbreak and the longing. A prayer he had ignored so many times. Maybe he was not so much better than Dean’s father after all. Maybe he had burned some bridges all on his own. Dean may have plenty now but he was still starving. “That’s why. It was immensely stressful. And I know you didn’t want to, I knew then. You’re not as hard to read as you think you are, Dean.”
“Alright.” Dean declared and thunked his and Cas’ duffle onto the bed closed to the smiling clown, “Let’s just get some dinner and settle in, we’ll be going home tomorrow.”
The hunter flinched at Cas’s voice, warmth ran down his nose and dripped to the floor. His body couldn’t stop shaking, he couldn’t make himself move. He could only stare at the love of his life and watch as the angel’s heart broke.
So, they brought him back to an exasperated Sam. They named him Foghorn because he sounded like one when they tried to give it a bath. He liked to pull Jack through walks in the woods, so Jack trained him to pull him on a set of roller skates. Not the skates he had found in the bunker. Dean had taken one look at them, immediately threw them away, and then dragged Jack to the store to get something that would not break his ankles.
As a survivor of abuse I DO NOT advocate for automatically forgiving your abuser. Sometimes it takes a long time just to be able to feel angry. I don’t follow all that “forgive your abuser regardless because they suddenly got better and/or got sick/were sick” nonsense. It’s bullshit. If someone hurt you they don’t have a right to forgiveness, but you have a right to peace, you deserve to be angry and feel hurt. And while sometimes that peace is finding a place to let go of the pain and move on, sometimes it’s finding the guts to be angry at what they did to you, learning how to stop loving them and letting them continue to do you harm (I struggle with that).
So when Dean called him about his wounded grace, his real grace, he watched it go to voicemail so many times that Dean stopped leaving them. He still called though. And Cas still let it ring, let it buzz off the counter until it fell, cracked on the floor, when he was working even though his manager frowned and asked if he needed a break.
Jack told him about the movies and shows he liked, he apparently had a lot to say about Anakin Skywalker, and ran through a well-practiced series of checks. He cycled through a couple of bird nest cams, the local emergency radio, Lebanon’s emergency radio, and some news websites, and told the angel about which sites he preferred, and which ones he hated. And then described a number of nest incidents, ranging from adorable moments to the “harrowing” moment when one of the condor chicks had played with plastic. He snuck out that night to retrieve the bit of microtrash and had discovered that the birds did not mind his presence. Since then, he had taken to feeding the bunker birds by hand every sunrise and had left a couple of well-stocked feeders for them before the little family left.
He was killing Sam too. And Jack, who shouldn’t care but told him, “be safe, Dean” like he did. He was killing them all with each careless step.
Still, he fought, they both had, to retrieve the angel’s grace and traced his phone’s GPS to the small convenience store Cas was working at now.
“Maybe?” Sam’s phone beeped briskly as a text message came in. “Can you check who that was? The password is 1122.”
The voice gave him a location, with the details only Cas would notice, a town next to when Dean had wept and tossed ashes into the wind. It gave him a rundown of their life and the dates to the second of every precious thing. It gave him a safeword. It gave him everything no one else could know about and Dean said nothing in return.
Then the snake needed a home. They had stopped hunting for the most part, and Dean had decided to go on an actual road trip, filled with tourist nonsense John never let them do. But this monster had taken out hunter after hunter and it wasn’t easy, but they managed. They had assumed the snake would die too, but it hadn’t and it needed a home now, a good, safe home where it could thrive.
And it was wonderful. Jack was wonderful, and Cas was proud of his son, and the more he knew the more he realized that Jack really was going to be okay. He was probably the best adjusted out of all of them somehow.
“Sam?” The angel leaned forward a little and caught his eye, Dean didn’t move. “Sam, did Dean do something?”
The coffee pot hissed, and Cas peeked through the door to check on Dean, who was still trying to ground himself in the present.
Jack flopped onto the bed he was sharing with Sam (they had no cots left), he lifted his head with a frown and poked at the pillow. “Dean?”
“We’ll stay. He might come around, right Sam?” Dean leaned against the window, eyes searching the side of the road endlessly. “We can stay until we know he’s okay. And then…”
The kid handled it well, all considering. He leapt back and started to talk to Dean immediately, telling the hunter who he was firmly. But he still stared at Dean with wide, stricken eyes until Cas pulled him into the other room.
“What do you mean?” Surely Dean wouldn’t get himself killed, not again. Cas was back now, so he wouldn’t dare. He had promised.
Until Dean was there to uproot him, to grasp him tightly and remind him how much he should settle in his own skin and tuck his coat around him like a shield. Dean would be hesitant, that was for certain. He may even keep his distance for a while, too afraid it was a trick, to afraid of another heartbreak. Even so, he would follow Cas around like a puppy. He always did.
Out loud he summarized it in a sentence and then dropped his voice and playfully imitated a line from the movie, and Dean
Dean had stayed in his room for the most part. He would make things Cas liked because it made his soul clench, made the pieces of it cut into his chest and he could imagine them scraping the sigils off of his ribs, erasing all the faith Cas had once held him to. But sometimes he sat in the living room and watched movies, the ones he had dragged Cas into wherever they were staying at the time and made him sit down and watch it together. The ones where they had gotten closer and closer until Dean could rest his head on the angel’s chest. And sometimes, with increasing frequency, the kid had appeared and perched himself on the other side of the couch, right in the middle of the movie.
Jack spent most of the time studying frogs or watching the world with wide, eager eyes; everything was wonderful and awe-inspiring. Jack was a being of love, after all, not yet buried under the muck the world seemed to throw at them. He could still see the beauty in almost everything and seemed determined to share it.
“Well, it’s the same kind of thing if he’s sleeping.” Sam smiled sadly. “You gotta let us handle it, okay?”
The clothes never got folded that night. Dean slept like the dead, but Cas couldn’t stop watching him breathe for a second, couldn’t stop tracing a love letter into his hunter’s fingerprints, letting his grief pool and settle into the irregularities of the hunter’s skin and slowly erase the places his hunter had torn himself apart.
Dean asked about a specific suite and was elated to find it was vacant. He asked for an extra bed and led them through the halls, grinning.
“Dude just came back from the dead, of course he smells weird.” Sam interjected, but his smile had been too bright and faded the instant Cas looked up. The angel was scared, the kind of scared people got when they found a lump and the doctor called them in first.
He tugged the handle of the fourth drawer and smiled. Held the soft yellow fabric, covered in bees, to the light filtering in from the hall with a raised eyebrow and playful smirk, “I thought matching pajamas were too chick-flicky for you, Dean?”
“That’s not what I meant. It just… It might just take a while for him to heal.” Sam eyed the child carefully, one hand on the door to go back inside, “And if you start feeling sick like that you need to tell one of us, alright? Trust me, it’s easier if it’s caught early.”
Jack took the plastic with a small frown and settled on the unused half of the loveseat, trying to watch the old cartoon marathon his dads were watching and his dads at the same time, clutching the plastic gingerly, until a quiet pop! sounded off from the side. He whipped his head around to stare wide-eyed at Dean, who was holding the plastic, staring straight into his son’s eyes with a smirk like it was a challenge. He popped another bubble.
He had known the antidote wouldn’t work. It wasn’t an antidote; it was really only there so Sam could feel like he tried his best. He was scared to die. Almost. But he wanted to kill the emptiness that consumed him before it could take Sam and Jack down with him and that meant he had to die too, because he was too far gone. So he didn’t think about it when he took the needle and thrust it deep, felt it hit his heart, felt the endless second of pain before his relief. It was bliss. He could go now, help these last lost souls and go somewhere where he would not come back, where he would no longer need to endure heartbreak.
“A ghost town is when all the people leave. Not a town full of ghosts.” Dean explained. He stared at the clown doll and wondered how hard it would be to salt and burn. It stared back with a predatory grin.
Cas settled across the table from Jack after the kid gave him yet another hug when he had turned the coffee pot on. He wanted bunker coffee. He wanted to drown The Empty in the warmth of his home so he could close his eyes without seeing the darkness.
It had been one small step forward right before Dean decided to finally try to jump off a cliff. Sam would always wonder if it was a kindness or an attempt to rectify his treatment before he wouldn’t have the chance to. If he’d been so willing to die yet again… (always when he was without Cas, always when he had finally been getting better). He had been so vacant when he was finally breathing and Sam had
Jack nodded solemnly. “I know. I was for a while, but I started talking to the therapist we met a couple of months ago. I’m getting better.”
“You’ve done a lot of things they won’t let you live down.” Jack finished his train of questions with a curt nod.
Dean only stopped and pulled over once, ten minutes outside of Lebanon to run through his checklist and bounce it off of Cas to make sure they had packed everything they might need.
Back at the bunker he would sit out on the roof and feed them by hand. He named each of them and greeted them the way other men would greet their children. In the winter he brought them inside sometimes, the ones who had gotten too cold and were too small. He set them in boxes until they were well enough to fly and moved them to one of the large empty rooms he had converted into an aviary of sorts until the cold snap ended.
When their mouths met it was momentous, always, they leaned in and closed the gap in one swift move, arms cradling each other, radiating warmth from the shower that soothed the aches in their joints, the places that would never heal right. Where the bones had long been set, been replaced, but the breaks stayed buried in their skin. They held on, pressed against each other close enough to feel their pulses, until the cool air of the bunker left their skin pebbled. There was no need to rush.
“Okay. Okay Cas, I get it.” He kept nodding nervously. “Look man, what do you want me to say here? I’m sorry?”
“Alright,” Sam declared, slapping his knees, “Jack and I are gonna go check out the graveyard. How about you and Dean go talk to the cops.”
“Sometimes when people get hurt it stays with them for a long time. And Dean’s been hurt. A lot.” He said gently. “And it sucks to watch someone you care about suffer like that, but all you can do is keep being there.”
He only needed to bear it for a few moments before Dean walked in, running his hand gently across Cas’s back as he walked past to grab something from the closet. Something small enough to tuck into the pocket of his jeans, or perhaps nothing at all. Just an excuse. He hadn’t needed to walk past Cas to get there in the first place.
Then there was the husky whose owners didn’t care for and tied up outside. Dean had bought the dog and had intended to take it to a family they had met downtown, but Jack hugged him, and the dog settled against the child immediately.
“For… that.” Dean shrugged. “Cas and I made a plan and… you know him. He’s gonna make sure I follow it. So, you don’t have to worry.”
Cas stared blankly at Dean. He had been contemplating, worrying, cursing lost time when Dean had made a reference of some sort. It pinged something in the back of his mind, but he didn’t know where to look, so he tilted his head in a silent question.
So Jack gave it one. He kept the snake in his room, she seemed to like cuddling more than the birds and Jack was happy provide. He let her coil around his arm and meandered through the bunker like a domestic Steve Erwin in fluffy penguin pajamas. Sam held her sometimes, and she liked to crawl up Cas’ sleeve, but was the angel was too worried about startling Dean to let her do it often. And it took a while, but sometimes Dean would cautiously pet her head with a finger, flinching each time she sniffed the air with her tongue. Jack offered to rehome her, but Dean shook his head and told him he was proud of how caring Jack was.
Dean seemed to collapse on himself, and Sam glanced at Cas and started to pick at his shirt. The constant threat of death or worse hung in the air like smog.
Cas sucked in a breath. “Dean’s…” Cas’s voice faltered. Dean wasn’t okay. Cas wasn’t okay. Not after…
Dean walked numbly towards the kitchen, he could hear Cas making coffee (it was Cas. It had to be Cas. If it wasn’t he would just let it kill him). The hunter stood in the doorway, one arm braced on its frame as he watched Cas gently pour two cups of coffee, he scraped out a couple teaspoons of crystalized honey and left the other black. Dean wanted to cry, to collapse on the floor, to, for the first time since meeting the angel in that damn barn, worship the ground he walked on because it was
Damn him, he had tried so goddamn hard, but every “I want to talk to you.” that dripped from Dean’s lips like blood, viscus dark red smeared across bridges like gasoline, sounded like “Get out.” And Castiel braced himself accordingly.
“I guess I have.” But there was weight to that sentence that Cas knew Jack would never truly comprehend.
There was a story he had read once, stolen from a free library and returned soggy with rain and cold, scientists had released an army of rubber ducks into the sea, just to see what would happen. Because they were scientists and in that age they had been almost rouge.
He loved this Dean too. As much as it broke his heart to see that the hunter still couldn’t let down his guard, with all the wards and the bunker and an angel to protect him. At least Dean didn’t classify him as a threat at the moment. And that was a blessing.
They both stopped at the doorway of the kitchen. Cas was glaring at Dean, a glow behind his eyes and the threat of barely contained grace swirling around the room as Dean sheepishly gnawed on his breakfast. Jack glanced at Sam worriedly but Sam smiled a little and tilted his head towards the dorms.
“Right.” Sam nodded shakily and patted his shoulder as they walked back inside. It wasn’t enough but he didn’t know what else to say when he said, “I’m proud of you for that, Jack.”
Dean nodded, throat working around words that refused to come out, around a lump that still hadn’t gone away.
Dean opened his eyes to gaze up at him softly, his voice didn’t work right, but Cas could see the words “I love you.” drip from his lips.
But, after everything they had been through in the past decade hearing Dean scream as the hellhounds tore him apart, killed him slowly while Sam could not even comfort him, tore away the one piece of his family he had needed the most, was still one of his most frequent nightmares. Still so vivid he could feel the slick of the blood when he woke up. And worse, when Dean came back empty and broken and Sam had been too busy drinking demon blood to do a goddamn thing.
When Cas finally came back with his stolen grace Dean made him all kinds of food he didn’t need or want to consume and brought him his favorite things but Cas couldn’t take them, he just let them sit on the table until Sam put them away. Dean had done his goddamned best to bridge the gap but whatever water was between them, churning and broken, filled the horizon. There was no bridge to build and nothing left to burn. It was just a nothingness that threatened to drown them both. He wished he could say he left to save them, but the truth was that he left to drown on his own. No matter how much he wanted to he couldn’t bring himself to care, at the same time he cared too much, that Dean was drowning too.
Sam patted Cas’s shoulder lightly as he steered Jack out the door, who was still casting worried, guilty glances back to Dean.
“The other option is to leave them here. And I can’t, Sammy.” Dean’s voice, as it had been since Cas came back, wobbled. Sam pretended he didn’t see Dean peering over his shoulder to where Cas and Jack had disappeared into the hall.
It had been a long time since the angel had truly wanted to be alive, not just for Dean or to atone for his sins, but because he genuinely wanted to exist with sunshine and flowers and humans and bees and his family. Dean Winchester had saved him, and now the angel had the audacity to decide he had been worthy of being saved.
Castiel could remember when humans used the stars to plot out their lives. He remembered how desperate humanity had been, had always been, to seek direction from something greater than them. They used the stars to choose a lover, to blame bad luck on, to send them forward when the dark was suffocating.
The first time Dean had laid with Cas it had been just that. Cas was suddenly in the bedroom at Bobby’s a few days after their fight. He whispered apologies into the hunter’s shoulder and wrapped him in his coat because the blanket Dean had thrown off when he appeared was two inches too far away. Cas wrapped him up tight and just held on until morning. Until Dean almost belonged in his own skin.
“Dean, what did you…?” Cas’s hand glowed as it rubbed Dean’s back in slow, soothing circles, his grace finally coming out of shock, enough to tell which drugs were in his system and he pulled back, grasped Dean by the shoulders and pried him up just enough to look into his eyes, terrified. Castiel’s heart didn’t need to beat but it was in his throat, blocking the words he wanted to say.
“Dean.” Cas stood, placed himself by the door so he was a mild inconvenience. They had talked about this, but it still made Cas uncomfortable.
They ended up to a cowboy themed diner Jack had noted in his folder, it was supposedly the best place for steaks in the area.
When Dean’s back was finally relaxed he leaned down so he could study Dean’s face; the hunter was not yet asleep, not truly, just in a state of quiet wakefulness, and rolled him back to start working on his head, careful to avoid the hunter’s neck. He didn’t have permission, and it always caused Dean some anxiety to be touched there. It was something they reserved for good days, for times long before Dean went to bed when they could both accept flashbacks ruining the moment.
Jack was still frowning when Dean padded into the kitchen in his robe to look restlessly though the cupboards.
“Nice matching pajamas by the way.” Sam called over his shoulder. “Little on the nose, but I can respect that.”
“I’m going to try.” Cas tried to smile at Jack. “And it is normal for an angel to sense other people’s feelings. It’s not evil. I promise, it’s because we are made to love and making sure someone is is part of that. Thank you for taking care of Dean, I’m sure he appreciated you watching movies with him.”
“Yes, but he…” Cas trailed off and glanced over at Dean, “Dean has been hurt a lot, by a lot of people.”
“I mean it.” Jack shuddered, “I could feel his pain. He was going to die, Sam was desperate, but I didn’t know how to get to him, I don’t know how to aim when I’m flying.”
Cas thought that if he looked too closely he can see Dean’s bones, a grim skeleton still wrapped in skin that looks out the window suddenly with vacant eyes.
He ran his hands across the ridges on his torso and arms and legs, the places no one would see. He had been right, back then, back in that crumbling barn. Cas made him think he was worth saving sometimes but Cas was gone and his vision was clear again—he wasn’t.
They turned into the driveway, arriving just in time to catch the ghoul exiting with his bags of money.
sleep deprived, which will take some time to fix.” The angel gave Dean a pointed look which Dean stubbornly returned. Sam waved at them and continued through the bunker.
Cas could feel his family’s grief, the worry and the longing. He had since he had arrived and that had been more reassuring than the sunlight on his skin. He had tracked them with it, drawn conclusions from it. Panicked as Dean got hopeful, said he was on his way and Sam panicked, sent him a desperate prayer pleading for help and apologizing while he ran towards the nearest town and cursed whoever had decided to stick him so far away. Cursed his shattered wings because they might cost him his heart.
Cas buried his face into the top of Dean’s head, they drove to the café in silence, even after Dean flinched awake  and stared at Cas in disbelief for a few moments. The angel gently placed an apple cinnamon steamer into Dean’s hands, assuring him it tasted like apple pie and was worth the lack of caffeine, and chugged two triple red eyes in the blink of an eye. Sam ordered him another coffee drink with honey and cinnamon, which he sipped carefully while keeping pace with Dean. The older Winchester drifted in and out of sleep as they silently made their way back home where Jack was waiting.
“I don’t know what to do. I heard it and I walked in and he had a knife in his chest and it wasn’t the only time and he looked—” Dean cut the sentence off sharply. “I didn’t tell Sam. I just took the knife and fucking left him like that. He was afraid he’d hurt someone and I—God Cas I said I’d kill him.”
“I could smite them.” Cas stared at one of the paintings with the intent for arson. Jack had moved to another, one of the extra weepy clowns with creepy children’s toys, and lifted a hand.
Dean watched him, reached his hand out so that his fingers skimmed his angel’s skin every time he crossed the room.
It should have been Sam, but Dean was Cas’s lover, which made Dean Jack’s dad. And Sam and Dean usually avoided talking about such things, even when a gentle touch was met with a ragged scream and a gun.
Because he was guilty. Or because he still cared enough to be selfish and wanted to think Cas could be alive somewhere out in the wild blue yonder.
It wasn’t perfect, of course. Dean liked it rough sometimes and Cas did his best. Cas had even tried spanking, which had ended between Cas asking, swatting him so lightly it felt more like the angel was petting him, asking again, and then swatting harder than intended (which was exactly what Dean wanted, but Cas could not seem to stop apologizing for.) They decided to end the night with coffee and some leftover strawberry pie. Dean had even said no once, early on, because he needed to know if Cas truly would stop, and Cas did. Before he had even finished the word Cas froze, hand lifted away and he was back at eye level in a second, his hand clean and hovering over Dean’s hair until Dean lifted his head to meet it. And Dean allowed himself the space to cry, to pull Cas tight and ask for a kiss and then kiss until the angel knew to his very essence how much it meant.
“This doesn’t have doors to the parking lot.” Jack leaned over Cas’s shoulder to talk to the angel. The hallway was freakishly narrow.
“Then stop hunting. After this hunt. You stop. You settle into the bunker and you get ahold of that shifter Jack told me about, or any other doctor who knows about hunting and you get help. But you stop putting yourself where it’s easiest for you to die.” Cas was in Dean’s space now, so close they could be kissing, “You stop hunting. You talk to me or Sam and we’ll have movie nights on the couch until you want to stay. You go feed birds with Jack in the morning and try all the things you never had the chance to at the grocery store. You come to me and let us plan out a future, even if it’s just a day.”
Jack tapped on the notification. “It’s a picture of Cas in a cowboy hat. He looks grumpy but amused.” The phone chirped again, “It’s another picture of Cas in a different cowboy hat, he looks… exasperated I think. Dean wants to know what looks better ‘his hat or the one from the store?’”
“Did you talk to him about it?” Sam glared right into Dean’s eyes, forced himself to bear the pain and shove through the threatening tears. “You need to actually talk to him. Please Dean. Don’t make me…”
Later, much, much later, when Jack had the bunker to himself, he would fill it with the same menagerie. The birds would be different, and so would the children and other strays. The snake was always the same, always wrapped around his shoulders and warm. The one thing he refused to let go.
And it he was in it for the hunter’s pyre. Cas knew that, because it was Cas and Dean could hide nothing from him. Because it was Cas and Cas could no longer hid anything from Dean either and Dean knew, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that his recklessness would kill Cas. Again.
“Why are they all so sad? It’s unsettling.” Jack’s grace automatically jumped from his fingertips as they brushed the canvas. The weeping clown morphed, a large, horrifying grin spread across it’s face and Jack jumped back.
“A ghoul cannot kill me, Dean.” Cas said softly, he looked over to Sam. “How about Sam and Jack wait in the hotel and I go with you.”
Dean lifted his cold coffee and drank deep. An alcoholic seeking escape in the dredges of old coffee grounds and soured caffeine.
Sam watched Dean for a few more minutes and slumped into the chair next to Jack. “That’s why I don’t wake him up.” Sam said gently, he leaned forward, arms resting on his knees. “Listen, remember when I told you to come get me if Dean acted weird?”
Sam leaned over and chuckled, the first picture featured Cas in Dean’s hat, which was too big and tilted to the side, undoubtedly evidence that Cas had given Dean a head tilt (which was probably exactly what Dean wanted) and hadn’t bothered to fix it. Presumably because it was adorable. The second was Cas in a blindingly bright white, brand new hat that actually fit him, but had a bright red band around the base with “Stampede” written in gaudy white letters. Cas indeed looked completely exasperated with Dean’s efforts.
Dean sobbed and lurched forward; his hands fisted in the back of Cas’s jacket as he cried messily into his chest.
Nice enough that people didn’t care it wasn’t real or didn’t notice. Sometimes his manager would look twice, when he was busy enough to let the smile drop. But she never said anything, just handed him his check and let him walk out the door, no questions.
Cas tilted his head, “He knows, Jack. Just like he knows Sam and I won’t hurt him, but sometimes if I move too suddenly while were cuddling, he forgets it’s just me. And sometimes he doesn’t recognize Sam either. It’s not our faults, but he has PTSD. The best we can do for him right now is let him calm down on his own.”
Actually, it was much, much worse than the décor of their usual hotels. Sam had no idea how anyone could fall asleep with that many eyes staring from the photography and those goddamn saloon doors didn’t deserve description, no that there was much to describe other than “rustic” (damaged, chipping, sticky) paint and purposefully squeaky hinges. Not to mention the statues and cut outs plastered into every corner like a twisted, Old West themed funhouse drank too much tequila and tried to give a history lesson between bouts of alcohol poisoning. There was even a taxidermy bison on the wall, that Dean chipperly poked on the nose.  But Dean was chattering happily, and Cas seemed to brighten a little, eyes drifting over Dean every so often until the brothers filed through the hokey saloon doors and into the even more horrifying second room where Sam and Dean set up Jack’s bed. Cas and Jack were too busy having an existential crisis.
trip to Vegas, with Charlie of course (“Sorry, babe, I’d love to go but I have a really big commission I have to get done this weekend"). They’d leave two hours after Cas got home from work, take turns sleeping and driving through the night, and barring any traffic, they’d arrive Saturday morning, where they would tourist their way through Las Vegas all day Saturday and Sunday, leave Sunday night and return mid morning on Monday, leaving all of them with enough time to rest and relax before returning to work for their Monday afternoon shift. In the meantime, Dean would get to work, moving all of the furniture from their bedroom into...not the bed room (not an easy feat when your apartment is the size of a postage stamp, and not even one of the nice ones), layering plastic tarps all over the bedroom floors, buying enough supplies, before, finally, painting the garden of Cas’ dreams on their bedroom walls, as a surprise for Cas when he got home from his trip to Vegas.
“You alright?” Dean asks holding a large box of newborn diapers, one eyebrow raised at something in front of Cas.
Meanwhile, the man has yet to stop looking him up and down. With a great deal of effort, Castiel tears his eyes from the man’s gaze, blinking a few times as if to clear his head. Head in the right space, they pack up their papers, the “Red Pen of Doom”, and proceed to turn his computer off. Papers and pen in the laptop case, and laptop in his hands ready to follow, that’s what Castiel looks like when the man walks over to him.
As Dean serenades their breakfast with some of Taylor Swift’s lyrics, periodically using the spatula for its intended use, Cas can’t help but smile his signature gummy smile at the sight before him. Dean’s never been the best singer, although he’s improved greatly over the years, or dancer, for that matter, but watching him do it anyways is a sight to behold. Knowing Dean’s spent many years of his life trying to hide who he really is makes Cas’ heart fill with joy when Dean chooses to be his unapologetic self. Dean’s come a long way in the years Cas has known him and he’s so proud of his boyfriend.
The sound of Claire’s laugh, even if it’s only a scoff, warms Castiel’s heart. Claire bows in mock supplication, “My deepest apologies, Your Royal Highness,” she responds in kind with a truly awful faux British accent and Castiel can hear the smile in her voice as she speaks.
Dean put his foot down that Cas didn’t put the bee knockers on the kitchen cabinets and installed bee knobs, instead (
When Cas got home, it was a surprise, alright, and not just for him. Cas came home early on Saturday to find Dean painting grass on the walls near the floor, blaring Led Zeppelin's Greatest Hits.
“But of course, my liege,” Claire continues her inaccurate attempt at a British accent while walking the few steps to the nearest empty table and motioning to the chair with an over-the-top flourish.
Claire snorts in disbelief, giving a full-body eye roll, which Alex doesn’t see, before turning back to her father. “So what’d you want to order?”
and I really appreciate it,” Castiel gives Dean his most appreciative smile; gums, teeth, eye crinkles and all.
Finally, just when Dean was finally starting to accept that they might never be done painting their apartment, Cas announced he loved the cabinets, the lamps, their room, and even his portrait on the wall, several months after Dean came up with the idea to recreate Cas’ childhood garden in their bedroom. Again, Dean cried honest to God tears, because they were finally done.
Cas slots one leg between Dean’s, tucks one arm under his head and presses Dean closer to him with the other. Dean’s hand covers his. Cas presses a kiss just under Dean’s ear before settling in for the night.
“Not that I’m not enjoying this, because I am, and we should very much come back to this…” Cas trailed off looking and Dean’s spit slicked lips, half distracted by them, half looking for the right word. “
“Claire-bear?” Castiel speaks gently, sets his laptop case on the floor so it leans against their leg, and opens his arms in invitation.
As Dean hands Sam and Eileen their own popcorn and gummy worms, Sam continues to gripe: “Dude, we’ve seen this a thousand times.”
The lovebirds spent the rest of the day covering up the paint splatters created during the war before Dean taught Cas how to mix and paint grass the color of Dean’s eyes; afterwards, they ordered some take out, showered together, and snuggled up under the bedsheets on the couch falling asleep not long after whispering love confessions into one another’s skin.
This woman has no idea who she’s talking to, and Castiel almost feels bad for her, having been on the receiving end of Claire’s verbal tongue lashings and having witnessed the receiving end of Claire’s anger. As proud as Castiel is that Claire hasn’t attacked this unpleasant woman, he can’t deny that they’re seething because
For a split second, a strange look, which seems suspiciously like disappointment and hurt, marr Dean’s stunning features before the moment is gone. “And Amelia is…?”
Both Claire and the woman notice the man put the money in the tip jar but neither pay him much attention seeing as soon becomes Claire too busy responding to the woman with biting sarcasm.
Cas looks down to see his hands gripping the shopping cart hard enough to turn them white. He releases the cart and wiggles his fingers to encourage blood flow and muscle movement. “Yes, just some unpleasant memories.”
A blur of motion — a patron getting a napkin from the counter — from the corner of their eyes catches their attention and forces Castiel to snap back into reality. He clears his throat just as a thought occurs to him. “You mentioned taking psychology and WGSS classes, but you never mentioned your job,” he points out.
Noticing his red-rimmed eyes in the mirror, Cas washes his face before he and Miracle head over to their room.
The next day, Cas insisted they paint a variety of flowers, so they started with the standard roses and they painted bushes and bushes of roses in red until Dean called it cliche, Cas scowled at him (“It’s
Cas’ immediate response is a groan ― how many times must he watch this movie? Then again, he’d watch the movie as many times as Dean wanted because he wants his boyfriend to be happy. The corner of Cas’ lip curls up in amusement at the memory of their case in Dodge City. Between dressing up as a cowboy and the motel they stayed at, Dean hadn’t been that excited in a long time and he deserved it, especially after all he’d been through. Of course, the memory of the Dodge City case brings back the unpleasant memories of when Dean saying “yes” to Michael, of him and Sam spending weeks searching for Dean after the archangel took over, of his and Dean’s reunion when they all thought Michael left Dean. Cas isn’t sure how he made the leap from the Dodge City case to Dean being possessed by Michael, but he learned a long time ago that human brains don’t always make sense.
side of the bed would be. A few nights later, Cas stared at their glow in the dark stars, looking for the constellations he and their friends painted, like he did every night they slept in sleeping bags, and noticed the stars in the shape of a dick. When he pointed them out, Dean was beyond grateful it was very dark so Cas couldn’t see the deep blush on Dean’s face when Cas made an off-hand remark about how Dean should have made the dick bigger. Regardless, Dean was happy that they were finally done painting their room.
After three months worth of painting and Dean-did-not-want-to-know-how-many-dollars-worth- of-paint, their mural was finally complete, and Dean almost cried tears of joy. It’s not that Dean didn’t enjoy this little project of theirs, cause he did. He loved dancing around their bedroom, listening to Cas belt out the lyrics to some of Whitney Houston’s greatest hits. He loved teaching Cas how to mix paint and how to paint certain shapes by standing behind his boyfriend, putting his hand on Cas’ hands and guiding him, especially when those lessons turned into messy make-out sessions (and how could they not when Dean pressed up against Cas and their faces were so close together and their breaths mingled in the air?). Dean even loved, in a twisted, sort of masochistic way, when they’d argue and settled it with a paint war, which, more often than not, ended in messy make-out sessions or even messier blow job sessions. Dean loved how much Cas reverted to his old, pre-incident self the most. But as much as he enjoyed all of that, he enjoyed the satisfaction of finishing a piece just as much. So much so that when the mural was complete, he wrapped an arm around Cas’ shoulder and looked around their freshly painted bedroom in awe and when Cas came up with the idea of painting the ceiling, Dean almost cried.
Baltazar felt like shit but got up and rounded the desk to sit down. He gathered the stack papers to look over them. His eyes blurred but said nothing while Castiel contemplated his choices.
Castiel sends him another, soul-burning glare. Hell, even his jaw clenched and a vein in his neck throbbed.
Castiel looked horrified. That was a death sentence. Dean would never survive Alistair. That man was a devil but too engrained in their family, a loose end that never could be cut unless they wanted to damn themselves as well.
It was a small line, thankfully. He filled out the paperwork and got his backpack ready. It was fall, and they had a sad assortment of squash, corn, and moldy melons. The frozen meats were a better haul and he felt a little giddy when they gave him two extra bags of cereal (because donated food usually came in banged up packaging so the plastic bag was the norm here.). A slightly smashed sliced bread loaf, a tray of off-brand cookies and a paper bag filled with canned foods. Some of those didn’t have labels (again, donated food and rough handling.). A few bags of grains, like rice and beans.
“How was your day?” Sammy asked as he finally took in his brother and the amount of food coming his way.
The guys groaned and didn’t protest when Dean started to check their pockets. He took their IDs and money. It was the same spiel that Sammy and him did just yesterday. I know who you are and I know where I can find you yada yada yada. God, this shit was getting old.
Sammy chewed his lip and looked back at his brother’s exposed midsection. Well, nothing was bleeding and the bruises had faded to a sickly yellow-green color. Looking at the scar tissues just made him so angry. He hopped off the bed, “Yeah, whatever.”
The wait staff, on the other hand, was a different matter. They were three guys that were a little jealous of the tips he received. They didn’t think it was fair because he was just a busboy. In the back, he can usually hear them making remarks. One of their gossips caught the ear of the boss man. Balthazar pulled him aside last week because one of the waiters accused him of using the business to turn tricks after work.
It was either Dad’s sour mood and anger, or Sammy’s increasing defiance. He was so tired of it! He never really saw himself as a negative guy. Maybe that was the thing because he couldn’t understand wanting to stay angry all the time. This dark cloud their family was under was really getting to him. Deep down, he knew he shouldn’t see it that way but it felt like a reflection of his ability to care for his family. That his family was so unhappy was somehow his fault. It stressed him out. Dad and Sam were all he had. It was scary seeing Sam drifting farther away from him. He didn’t want to be left alone.
“Go fuck yourself, prick!” The biggest dipshit he ever saw spoke up. He looked at his cohorts with a grin, like he made the biggest comeback ever. His even dumber friends all laughed like they thought it was funny too. Dean wanted to roll his eyes. He turned his attention to the guy on the ground.
“Oh my god, don’t tell me he had dark hair and blue eyes.” Sammy deadpanned. It was like Aaron and Jake all over again. Dean’s not so subtle crush over Batman and Superman and any other dude that slightly resembled them.
“Keep the door open?” Sammy turned his puppy eyes on Dean and Dean smiled down at him. He ruffled his brother’s hair, “Sure.”
He knew Benny thought he was crazy for going along with this plan. Last Friday night, he got called into the office. He was completely blindsided about being fired. Balthazar told him he knew Dean was a minor. Before his boss could really tear into him, Castiel entered from the back room with a stack of papers. They stared at each other in shock, before Castiel’s face turned thunderous.
“Even if I told ya, you wouldn’t believe me.” Dean muttered. Benny chuckled at the youthful belligerence. He’s been there before, back in the day so he didn’t push too much.
Later that evening, they trudged their way back to the motel. They were both dusty and exhausted. Sammy clutched his torn Target bag close to his chest. It started off great but on their way home, they got jumped by a group of teens looking to rob them.
It was too early for this shit. Dean and Benny sat outside the principal office on a Monday morning. Benny was noticeably nervous as he was still pretending to be Dean’s guardian. The older man kept fidgeting with his cap or loosening his tie. Dean also hated wearing ties. He didn’t really like anything too tight around his neck. As for him, he was holding an ice pack on his cheek, even though the hand holding it was busted to hell. His other hand was bandaged. Luckily his finger and knuckles weren’t broken.
“I’m going to touch and press on yer belly. I need to check what’s going on.” Benny palpated the area and when Dean flinched he noted the area. There was one spot that had him worried. It was hot and raised. A fresh bruise overlaid one of the scarred claw marks. Benny mentioned he had a suspicion of what it could be. He told Dean he might have to lance the area. He had a small vial of lidocaine and gave a few shots in that spot.
“Are you calling me a bitch? Because it sounds like you are. I have Benny, Grant, and Oro watching my back. Am I a bitch for needing their help?”
“-We left him in a better place and with friends. I mean we hunt monsters but we don’t get paid. Maybe it all balances out in the end. Although...” Sammy chewed his lip and looked at his brother through his bangs.
Benny turned back to Dean, who shrugged “I thought I could wing it but we don’t know anyone. Our… uh, family friend… Jim said he might be able to help.”
They made quite a ruckus, and that made Dean a little jumpy. He was going to get the kid out and bail. Surely someone heard and will come to investigate soon.
“It’s cute how you try to emulate your father, but as an American, your accent is a dead giveaway,” the older man teased.
“The pretty one looks like a whore, I bet he has money.” A taller fat kid said. “Hand over your fucking wallets, now!”
His own pain made him hesitate as the guy recovered quicker. The guy threw a punch and clipped Dean in the ear which stung like hell. The guy started grinning like he was actually going to win. What he didn’t realize was that all he did was piss off Dean. Dean grabbed his shirt and head-butted him. There was an audible crunch and the guy went down holding his bloody nose.
“Castiel. Castiel Mikhailov.” He said with a hoarse voice. The hoodie was tight and looked really uncomfortable.
Dean flushed so brightly his freckles popped out even more. “It ain’t like that!” He threw the dish towel at his grinning brother’s face to stop from seeing that look. He got up because it was his turn for the shower and he needed to get ready for work anyway,
Soon enough the Principal’s door opened and Castiel’s Aunt and Uncle came out, along with Castiel who gave Dean the meanest death glare he could manage. His cheek was swollen and there was a small cut from being punched, but other than that, he was fine, unlike Dean who took the blunt force of the attack.
Words were murmured and hands were shaken. Then the Principal motioned for them to come in. They did. Dean soon slumped down in the chair and blankly stared out the window. Benny and Principal Moore began to talk. There was a strict no fighting policy at the school but they also had a no bully policy too. Seeing that Dean was protecting another student and with the Mikhailovs being on the school board, felt that suspending Dean wasn’t necessary. In fact, since Castiel was one of the top 10 percent of students, they thought it would be a good idea for him to mentor Dean and help him get his grades up. Mister Moore was very excited by this idea and reassured Dean that since he just started, it shouldn’t be too hard to rearrange his schedule and get the ball rolling.
“There’s no need. We’re not in school.” Sammy said from the doorway. Benny gave Dean a surprised look.
“Fuck off ya cunt.” A lackey it seemed, spoke up. Dude was pretty fugly. He never actually seen a dude with a pug face before, but this guy’s genetics were fucked up.
Castiel looked down at the floor silently fuming. His cheeks were red with embarrassment and shame. Baltazar knew his cousin was a runner when he got overwhelmed, and so got up and closed the door. He came back and half-sat on the desk facing the younger teen.
“I used to be a medic in my last crew. Just show me.” Benny stood in the doorway to block his way. Yep, folded arms, and legs shoulder’s width apart to show he meant business.
“Pizza.” Dean declared. The bullies- unbeknownst to them- paid for a large pan supreme pizza and 2-liters of mountain dew. The spoils of war.
Benny and Dean followed along behind as a secretary did a little tour of Sam’s Middle school. Hosting upwards of 700+ students, this place was massive. Dean thought it was cool they had a swimming pool but Sammy geeked out over the library and up to date computer lab. The principal barely batted an eye at the paperwork and sent it back to the secretaries to be inputted into the database. She was a nice lady. A bit strict looking but kind. Hands were shaken and Benny and Dean were out the door.
Worked ended and Dean slowly walked over to Benny’s truck. His belly was aching something awful. Benny listened mostly to country music and blues. It was the old stuff like Conway Twitty and Hank Williams. Right now, it was Dolly singing about Jolene stealing her man or something.
“What’s this fucker’s name?” Sammy said. Dean’s sour mood waned after his brother said that. A protective pipsqueak.
“Lay back.” Benny said. Dean did so with a wince. He tried not to look at the kitchen lamp as it was blinding. He still felt a little blinded even under his eyelids.
Castiel shuffled his feet and his hands twisted. “I overheard. It isn’t a secret how he gushes about him. He was a little brother that’s his world.”
Now that all the bullies were on the ground, Sammy and Dean rooted through their wallets. No one had much more than a five and change but collectively they scored $34. They read those boys’ names out loud and their addresses. They did that to inspire fear and let them know if they tried anything, they knew where they lived. They walked away, but as soon as they turned a corner, they booked it. They weren’t risking riding the town shuttle to get home. Just in case those assholes narked.
“I need a backpack, some school supplies and a pair of shoes.” Sammy tossed him his old pair and it was obvious that Sammy had intentionally made the wear and tear worse. Dean fingered along the very fresh rip at the toe area. He raised one eyebrow at his brother. A pink flush colored his little brother’s face but he tried to pretend he wasn’t caught.
“He’s desperate. He needs this. Think of it as charity. I’ll foot the bill for three months as a trial run. After that, you can choose to keep him around or get rid of him.”
Sam and he shared a look. They nodded to a silent agreement. It would be hypocritical if he judged Sammy for having that malevolent looking grin when he, himself was eager to make someone bleed. So he didn’t think about it. They let their fists talk for them.
Dean stood up straighter and crossed his arms. “Okay, first of all, I don’t need permission to do the right thing. And B.), Ew. Who the hell calls themselves the Hellhounds? Not only is that lame but cheesy as hell. Pfft.” Dean scratched at his chin. “Tell ya what, with $50 bucks a week, I can watch your back. I’ll make sure those douche canoes never bother ya.”
At the end of the line  Mormons were giving out bags full of hygiene products and a pamphlet that advertised their service times and upcoming events. He took whatever he could and thanked the volunteers there. A young mother was nice enough to give him a lift to the motel. He only had $5 on him but she was immensely grateful for the gas money. He was more than grateful that he didn’t have to haul all this stuff back on foot.
“Cassie, please… talk to me. I care about you. I’m not your mother. What do the kids call it? Oh! This is a safe place. What we discuss will remain between us. Now man up and speak to me as such.” It started off gentle but by the end, Balthazar spoke sharply.
If it were possible the High school was even bigger. Or at least the large track and football field gave that impression. Most of it was a two-story building and situated on a hill. So yeah, Dean felt a little intimidated to be rolling up on a place like this.
Meanwhile, the other two dipshits began to kick him while he was down. He relied on instinct and reflex. The next kick, Dean grabbed their leg and bit down hard. The boy screamed and tried to get away from him. Dean held on for a second and rolled out of the way when the other boy tried to stomp on his skull. His hands snapped up and gripped the bully’s crotch and twisted. The boy howled in sheer pain. Now that he was distracted, Dean got up and in the right stance, arm pulled back and like a spring, he twisted by his waist and let his fist fly forward. The fucker flew back, and blood sprayed out of his nose and mouth. It was beautiful.
“Didn’t know if I could trust you. Didn’t want you to call CPS on us. I’m going to be 18 soon. I figured I could hold out a little longer.” Dean was blunt.
It seemed that there would not be enough time to do laundry, but that was alright. It wasn’t immediately necessary. Cas could use his grace to make his clothes smell like the detergent and fabric softener Dean used, if he really needed to.
To be fair, the décor of the room was a more than a little offbeat, the walls were covered in yellowed floral wallpaper halfway to the floor, and there was cheap, warping vinal “wood” on the bottom half. The floor was covered in rough, fraying, green carpet with blue and green speckles.
Dean stopped knocking at the door and stopped inviting him to join him and Sam for movies and whatever else they did, stopped raising his head to acknowledge Cas when they saw each other wandering through the endless maze and soon even those little glimpses of each other stopped. They went into hiding.
“I saw.” Jack whispered. “I wouldn’t do that to him. I wouldn’t do that to anyone. How do I make sure he knows I won’t hurt him like that?”
“You’ll stop hunting?” Cas’s voice was so hopeful, like it was before the apocalypse truly begin. Before he lost his faith in the good. And Dean couldn’t disappoint that voice again.
Dean seemed to sober on the car ride over, and Jack had slid into the booth next to Sam with an obvious and encouraging wink at Cas while Dean meandered, admiring the endless array of old cowboy paraphernalia that lined the walls. (Slightly less tackily than the room, thank Chuck.) Cas was occupied with watching Dean fondly while sipping his coffee but he reached over to ruffle Jack’s hair with a grateful smile.
“I had a bad PTSD episode once. I stayed in the bunker and watched TV.” There was another painfully long pause. “What do you usually do.”
“Dean thinks the hat is cute on you.” Jack said absently. He was swinging his legs and watching the door. Cas stopped pacing.
He wanted to drop it. Crack the bloody glass on the ground and watch it dissipate with his future, like the way the Impala vanished in the dust. But he let it sit on the counter. And when it was done he took it to the shelter he had carved for himself from state land—old promises that hovered over the generations like unseen mothers. If he dropped it here this place would flourish. It would blossom and he would have left one good thing.
“This is going to be my last hunt.” Dean announced as he sped towards the bank. Sam’s heart clenched, sent ice through his veins.
Which was fine, really. He just needed to make enough money that he could burn out in comfort, somewhere far away where no one would find his bones. Maybe he would know it was coming and have time to burn it all down with him. Leave no trace, no body to find and no mind to scar.
He had hoped that Jack would have killed him for all he had done but he didn’t, he just stared like Cas did, like he was trying to piece together an impossible puzzle, like he felt sorry for Dean. Afraid, yes, until after the hunt a few months ago when Dean had said the kid had done good, but sorry for him all the same—like Old Yeller trapped in the building alone, furious and dying. Dean had been a dick, he had deserved it, but Jack had taken to staring at Dean with the same broken look that Cas had in the barn.
Dean returned and pulled a couple packets of honey out of his pocket and handed them to Cas with an almost shy smile when he slid into place beside his angel, so Cas bumped his shoulder against Dean’s. He could feel the human’s warmth seep through his coat and decided to stay there, pressed against Dean’s side, close enough to feel him breathing.
Sam blinked, but nodded. He had gotten over the betrayal he had felt at first, the jealousy that Cas could actually help Dean that sprang up whenever Cas woke the hunter from a nightmare and talked him down. He had felt replaced for a while, but… “Cas and Dean have a bond, Cas can get through to Dean when even I can’t.” Jack tilted his head, “It’s been that way since a little after Cas pulled Dean out of Hell. It was rough at first, and they don’t have the healthiest of relationships, but Dean was getting better.”
Dean shook his head, reached out with the hand not occupied by pie and scruffed his kid’s hair with a fond smile. Then he flinched, his face twisted into a storm of emotion, set the pie on the table and swept Jack into a rib-crushing hug. When the hunter released him he held Jack by the shoulders, nodded with his entire body, the movement shaking Jack just a little and then walked out of the kitchen as if nothing had happened.
The rest of the drive was spent reviewing zombie lore, cowboy lore, and their game plan (Jack and Cas were allowed to help investigate but not join in on the hunt) as Dean gradually got more and more excited.
He saw Dean again at a diner. Through the window. Sam was talking but Dean was staring at his bottle of beer like the urn of a loved one. He isn’t eating.
I like to think that Jack goes on to become a psychologist in this future. He would make a great one.
The brawl was actually going in their favor until a smaller pudgy dude sucker-punched Dean in the gut. Wincing in pain, Dean crumpled to the ground. Sammy looked at him as two other boys crowded around. Dean gave him a nod and watched as Sammy went buck wild. All that pent up rage finally found an outlet.
Balthazar only hummed. He turned away and looked out the window. When Benny brought in the boy, gaunt and frail but determined, he could see the disparities in their positions in life. Far too many times he saw pretty faces laid low and ending up doing despicable things just to survive. Dean was one such person… but he seemed to glow. Righteous and selfless. Everything their family was not.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have yelled at you. It’s been a super shitty day and I just want to go home.” Dean said in a much quieter, and chastised tone. He went to stand up but paused. He tried not to winch, but his muffled pained huff didn’t go unnoticed by both Mikhailovs. Dean moved swiftly and head held high out the door to make up for his own perceived weakness.
“I think you were just shitty with the timing and delivery. Maybe if you buttered him up a bit, got in his good graces first, then he would have been open to the idea.” Sammy suggested.
“Do you have a combo number for the locker or can I cut you free?” Dean asked, but by now the big asshole had enough. He went to grab ahold of Dean’s shirt but Dean, with his lightning-fast reflexes, he used the dude’s momentum and pulled him off balance. A flick of his wrist and had the guy on the ground, kneeling, with his arm twisted behind him.
Dean snorted. “So okay, there’s this dude, right. Surrounded by punks. They trapped him, see. I’m not going to walk away if I can do something, yeah? That be a pretty shitty thing to do. So I come in, all Rambo-like and send these assholes on their way. Help him get loose, and you know what?”  Dean pointed his spoon at his brother. “That asshole didn’t even thank me. In fact, he chewed me out!”
“You and I are taught to only think of family and obligations. So this young man, obviously went out of his way to… what… protect you, yes?”
“Ugh. Fine! He said I was worse than those dipshits because I offered him my protection. Said, it was “extortion” and some shit. Like I’m the fucking mob or something.” Dean looked like a kicked dog after saying that. Sammy felt really angry that some ungrateful ass put that look on his brother’s face. Dean does so much and doesn’t deserve to be treated this way.
He made it back to the hotel around 9 a.m., and Sammy was up and folding the laundry in the kitchen. He hated how Dean would roll the clothes even though they were in a motel that had a usable chest of drawers. He stood up and helped his brother sort out the food. Their dad fucked up on the last hunt and he knew it. With Dean getting hurt so badly, he made it a priority to get a nicer motel that was meant for extended stays. He figured that Dean needed some extra time to heal and bought the place for two months. His guilt worked in their favor as this place had a full-size fridge, an electric stove range and even a microwave that worked. It had only one bedroom but it did have an extra cot that Sammy claimed and had set it up in the living room.
Once again, the handsome man in the kilt pulls out a few dollar bills and places them in the jar after clearing his throat; only this time, the unreasonable woman and Claire have his attention.
conversation-” His train of thought seemed to get back on track if his straightened posture and eye contact was anything to go by. “-but, Dean, what exactly are you doing?”
While he waits, Castiel removes his laptop from it’s case, gently placing it on the table and turning it on. Once he types the password, they take out a red pen and a stack of papers to be graded before placing the case on the ground so it leans against the white metal chair. He’s just about to open up an email from a student when Claire returns with their order: a double scoop of Snickers ice cream in a waffle cone wrapped in a napkin.
“Did you find a particular crib you wanted to show us?” Cas asked while pushing the shopping cart, mildly curious.
“Really?” Dean frowns in confusion, as if he can’t possibly fathom how Castiel came to such a conclusion, and Castiel should
Dean smiles, although it’s not the same and Castiel curses themself for making Dean feel less sure of himself. “Oh, it is,” Dean wiggles his eyebrows, “Of course, I can’t get into detail, what with doctor/patient confidentiality.”
“Well, I — uh —” Castiel scrambles for something to say after having been brought back from deep within his thoughts, “— I didn’t study religion in college — I didn’t have to, as I’m sure you may have guessed from my name, my parents were very religious — but I can’t imagine it’s a particularly lucrative field, I'm sure your brother is doing it because he enjoys what he’s doing.”
. They’re so lost in Dean’s smile they almost don’t notice the other pride pin attached to Dean’s red buffalo plaid shirt.
Dean grabbed a nearby paintbrush, dipped in green paint and began using long, even strokes to paint delicate blades of grass from the floor to about six inches above it, glancing at Cas every so often to make sure he was paying close attention (spoiler alert he was; he always was). When Dean was done with his Dean-monstration (as he referred to it and still refers to it, much to the dismay of his loved ones), he turned to Cas and motioned to the wall with a “your turn” kind of gesture, expecting his boyfriend to dip his brush in paint and use long, even strokes to paint delicate blades of grass from the floor to about six inches above it.
what caused traffic, and a quick trip to the hospital to make sure Sam hadn’t gotten hit with the dresser since he was right behind Dean when it happened, Dean and Cas were the proud renters of a crappy, postage-stamp-sized apartment in the greater downtown area.
Claire looks up at him with a small smile, watery red eyes, a cheek streaked with a single tear, and her arms still wrapped around him. “Yeah, I think I’ll do that.” She lets go of Castiel to wipe her face. “Thanks, Ren.” Claire gives him a shy smile.
“At that point, I had to zone back in and pay attention to the lesson, but, man, when she moved on, I was still thinkin’ about it. It was like, something clicked and everything about me made sense, y’know? Of course, at the time, I had a big ol’ bisexual panic about it for a few weeks before I finally came to terms with it, but that’s just how it goes.” Dean ended his story with a shrug of his shoulders.
Sometimes, Dean wonders if he did something to legit piss Cas off, especially when Cas got the idea to paint honeycomb patterns and beehives, of all things, on the inside of all their cabinet doors, including the ones in the bathroom (
Castiel hesitates before turning his attention back on his daughter. She points her thumb in the direction of the back room. “My shift’s over, I’m gonna go get my stuff,” Claire smiles at him as if she knows exactly why he hesitated. He hopes not, he’d never hear the end of it.
Castiel and Dean flinch, causing Dean to let go of Castiel’s hands, and they barely manage to avoid looking like two teenagers who got caught by their parents. When Claire looks between him and Dean with a smirk and a knowing look Castiel feels a little too much like the time his mother saw him pining after his high school crush. “Let’s go.”
“Awesome,” The man smiles, just this side of shy, pulling the chair across the table closer to Castiel until their knees are only a few inches away. “I’m Dean,” he introduces himself with a vibrant smile, holding his hand out for Castiel to shake.
in his arms. It took a bit of coaxing, but Cas finally admitted he started their little paint war hoping to distract Dean long enough to forget about Cas helping with the mural; Cas didn’t know how to paint and didn’t want to risk ruining the mural but ended up doing so anyways during their paint war, as evidenced by the multicoloured paint splatters found
Castiel turns his attention to the young woman in front of him and is about to reply when they’re cut off by Claire.
“What do you mean?” Castiel aims for casual interest but fails. Who can blame them, when they’re personally invested in the answer?
Castiel scoffs, “Don’t be. The divorce was mutual and we split amicably.” Castiel smirks, “She accepted my coming out as non-binary but apparently coming out as gay was a bit of a turn-off.”
Several other children and their guardians walked up to Cas and admired the singing cartoon human heads, including many of their neighbors, much to Cas' pleasure. When the song ended, the small crowd gave a collective "Awwwww," before collecting their candy and moving to the next house.
This gives Dean pause. He considers the question as he chews on his licorice and eventually comes up with, “Eh, he’ll be fine. He can just cover up his eyes during any bad parts.”
and that’s when Castiel starts to feel the chair digging into his skin and he releases his grip on the metal. He briefly looks at the angry red and pink lines where the metal had left imprints on their skin and resigns themself to massaging his hands.
Cas froze. He shrugged the shoulder Dean was on, forcing him to get off. “Dean, you were gonna paint my garden?” Cas asked in a small, disbelieving voice.
“Me either.” Dean’s had nightmares for years and he always pretends they never happen and gets on with his day, which never ceases to amaze Cas. The last time Cas had a nightmare, he was paranoid, twitchy, and inconsolable all day. Lucky for both of them, they have each other now, so they can get through the nightmares together. “I missed you waking up this mornin’.”
“Ever since we met in Hell, the forces of Heaven have been trying to keep us away from one another.”
This caught Cas’ attention. He didn’t stop hugging Dean but he did look up at him. “Dean, I don’t have an artistic bone in my body.”
Dean’s furrowed brows give way to understanding when he remembers what Castiel is talking about. “No thanks needed. Besides, anyone would have done the same.” he dismisses Castiel’s appreciation with the hand currently not in their grip.
“Of course,” Dean answers as if he couldn’t imagine the answer being anything else. He pauses. Then looks Castiel up and down in a, frankly,
As the little cartoon heads sang, Dean rolled his eyes in his cat form, visible even from a few yards away. Cas gave an amused smile. Dean hates the song, hates that it's from the perspective of a human because it "makes monsters look bad". Cas finds the song quite charming, which according to Dean means Cas has "no taste" when it comes to music.
means). Still, with some of Dean’s furniture (sans dresser), some of Cas’ furniture, a few pieces of furniture courtesy of Cas’ parents - including a brand new IKEA dresser, which didn’t even fit with their broke lumberjack artist meets broke college graduate aesthetic, but Dean can’t complain because, hey, he may not be smart enough to properly hook a dresser to the roof of his car but he is smart enough to know a free dresser is a free dresser...he complained anyway - and some decorations from their friends and family, they make the World’s Most “Charming” Apartment their own.
, so we’re watching a classic.” Dean defends his choice as he passes Jack a bag of microwave popcorn with a look of disgust Cas knows to mean their son requested M&Ms in his popcorn again.
“destroy” the kitchen as Dean claims, those cookie dough stains were there when they moved in), Cas distracts Dean by leaning in for a kiss. It’s a quick peck on Dean’s lips that leaves him wanting more, if his trailing after Cas is any indication.
Dean and Castiel continue staring into one another’s eyes for so long they forget about the world around them. The other patrons’ conversations are ignored in favor of cataloging all of the shades of green and gold in Dean’s eyes and all the freckles on his face. Lost in Dean’s beauty, time seems to slow down and speed up all at once; it feels like hours have passed when a blur of blonde in the corner of his eye catches Castiel’s attention and at the same time it feels like only a few seconds have elapsed. Regardless of the passage of time, the moment is over and Dean seems to think so, too, since he shakes his head as if shaking a trance loose; his hand, however, never leaves Castiel’s.
Castiel removes their cell phone from their laptop case while Dean takes his phone out of his kilt pocket and they exchange phone numbers. No sooner than “Dean <3” sends “Hot Professor Dad Cas” a text to make sure neither of them typed in the wrong number, does Alex walk out of the back room.
“Told you so!” she says from somewhere in the backroom and although it’s a bit muffled, he can detect the smugness in her voice.
Realizing he’s not going to get any more kisses, Dean frowns. “He’s worse than you, kid can barely work a toaster. Someone’s gotta feed us, and I’m the only one who can do it.”
flirting, can you quit making heart eyes at one another so we can go now?” The tone laced with sarcasm lets him know their daughter rolled her eyes. Claire faces Castiel and speaks to him directly. “
Dean didn’t meet Cas’ no doubt intense stare. “Yeah. I was gonna work on it all weekend so you’d come home to it on Monday.” He risks a glance at Cas. “Oh, c’mon, Cas, don’t get weepy on me,” he teased.
“Yeah, well, Claire did most of the heavy lifting. She really held her own,” Dean gives a chuckle which Castiel can only describe as self-deprecating, but he isn’t entirely sure. “I wish I had half her spunk when I was serving a few years back.”
Twenty minutes later, a pair of disheveled boyfriends stepped out of their unhaunted house with Cas dressed as an undead tax accountant and Dean dressed as an undead lumberjack.
They moved all of their furniture back into their room, soon thereafter; that first night under their hand-painted, glow in the dark stars was one of the best nights Dean’s ever had, partially because they “made love” (Cas’ words, not Dean’s), but mostly because they talked and talked all night, about nothing, anything, and everything in between. In that moment, illuminated by the glow in the dark constellation
Dean painted the entire ceiling a rich blue/black colour and got dripped on during the process. And since Dean was smart (enough), he enlisted the help of their friends when splattering stars and hand painting constellations. During this particular painting session, Cas took it upon himself to paint the constellation Aquarius on their ceiling, near where his side of the bed would be; meanwhile, when Cas wasn’t looking, Dean painted the well-known constellation
. Every fiber of his being screams to ignore Claire and save her from the five foot tall middle-aged woman who’s gone red in the face from airing her grievances in front of all the customers in the parlor but Castiel remains frozen, half out of his seat, taking in deep breath after deep breath and willing himself to calm down.
“Yes, of course, my apologies.” Cas shifts his weight and grabs their laptop case with the other hand.
Castiel looks up and sees Claire grab the spray bottle and rag from earlier before she returns to the back room.
Another customer — most notably wearing a black kilt with pink, purple, and blue pleats, which accentuate the bow shape of his legs quite nicely — walks up to the register, placing him a few feet away from the woman still yelling at Claire. The customer clears his throat, frowning at the woman with brows the same color as his hair, a sandy brown which glistens in the harsh fluorescent lighting.
Claire keeps trying to reason with the rude customer, who keeps insisting Claire stop hiding the milkshake machine
The other best part of their wedding night was when Dean and Cas got to have sex, taking turns fucking each other while the other faced the painting of Cas as a sexy naked angel with six wings and a towel for a loincloth.
“Eileen’s never seen it, neither has Jack.” Dean grew defends. As soon as everyone else has their snacks, Dean snuggles up to Cas.
Castiel barely has time to process this before the man, Claire’s “new friend”, follows her line of sight and lands on Castiel.
Sam gives his brother a very unimpressed look. “The baby’s not going to be born for a few more months.”
When Cas received the announcement (what a wonderful phone call to witness, that was), his parents went on and on about how the house felt so big after Cas and Gabe (he finally earned the rights to his name when he bought Cas an olive green sweatshirt with the words “YOU ARE BEE-UTIFUL” written in the ugliest all-caps font and the decent sketch of a bee in white for Christmas) moved out that they couldn’t bear living in it anymore, especially since their kids didn’t visit very often (Hey, cut them some slack! Gabe’s a new business owner and Cas’s
“Wasn’t Churchill,” the familiar voice that greeted him earlier states, strained. Barely a moment passes when Annie Jones walks into the main part of the shop carrying a large stack of ice cream containers.
She seems to talk more to herself than to Cas; nevertheless, they suggest, “Perhaps you could schedule a ‘girls’ night’?”
Cas frowns and tilts his head. He looks at Dean, who’s just as confused as he is. He looks at Sam who shrugs one shoulder with a resigned expression.
Jack smiles at that. “Come on, I’ll show you!” He turns around and leads them out of the personal hygiene aisle and towards the baby section of the store.
“Morning, my love.” Cas greets him back, loving the way Dean’s freckled cheeks turn pink at the term of endearment, no matter how many times Cas says it.
As expected, he dipped his skinny brush in the emerald green paint Dean had to painstakingly mix and used it to paint one long, even stroke on Dean’s
Castiel smiles as well and before they know it, they find themselves staring into one another’s eyes.
"Then you know how important this is to me," Cas said while smoothing down the already smooth plastic table cover.
(To clarify, Dean only laughed at that because the image of Cas spitting out a white substance clashed with the image of Cas insisting he swallow a different kind of white substance during their quickie earlier; he did
“Yes! I found a dark brown crib I think would suit my…” he trailed off and looked at all of the adults before focusing on Eileen. “Step-sibling? Cousin?” Cas raised his eyebrows at the question, never really having thought about it. Looking around at Dean, Sam, and Eileen, it’s clear they never thought about it either. Eileen and Sam both opened their mouths to answer before Jack cut them off. “Wait,” Jack frowns at Eileen in confusion. “Are you my step-mom or my aunt?”
He looks over at Claire whose arms are no longer crossed in frustration, whose eyes no longer glare in contempt, and whose attention is no longer on the “Karen” in front of her but rather on the kind man in a kilt who is not only helping her deal with an awful customer but also tipping her generously.
When Heaven asked Dean to torture Alastair it nearly tore them apart before they even begun. Crowley has gotten between him and Dean more times than Cas cares to count. And what of all the demons who tried to kill them, kidnap them, imprison them, kill them or all of the above?
Frowning at Dean in confusion, Cas explained, “Yes. Your brother ate some bad tacos on the way to Las Vegas and got sick-” (
He closed his eyes and pictured what he wanted to happen. His eyes lit up and he felt the magic coursing through his veins as he cast the spell.
They told their loved ones and got several “Congratulations!” and even a few housewarming gifts. The stuff they owned was either thrown away, given away, or boxed up and packed in the back seat of Dean’s Chevy Impala when it didn’t fit in the truck and Sam’s prissy Prius damn near fit to burst. After what was supposed to be a trip or two but ended up being several trips, a trip to the police department to explain to the nice officer that Dean’s dresser wasn’t properly strapped to the roof and
Cas snaps out his reverie when Dean points to him, singing. Cas ducks his head, embarrassed at being caught, but his smile never wavers. Seemingly done cooking breakfast, Dean turns the stove off, abandons the spatula in the sink, and makes his way to Cas. Grabbing his boyfriend’s hands, Dean gets him away from the kitchen entrance, pushing and pulling his arms while shaking his own body in time with his singing
, Dean thought, at the time, and interesting it was since Cas failed to mention he bought enough bee knockers to screw one onto every door in the apartment.
Dean rolls his eyes as takes a bite of his licorice. “Right, cause if it were up to you, we’d be watching ‘The Notebook’.”
Seeing the look on her friend’s face, Annie clarifies. “It wasn’t Churchill who said that,” she says leaning back as she walks, so as to not drop the mountain of — no doubt — freezing cold ice cream containers.
) “-so we postponed the trip and came home early.” He looked around the room, with it’s freshly painted green walls until his eyes landed back on Dean, who was in the middle of painting some emerald green grass along the bottom of the wall. “Dean, what’s going on?”
A few weeks after their little heart-to-heart, Cas’ overall mood improved, even though he was still disappointed that neither of his parents bothered to take care of the garden he’d been growing for the past decade. So when Cas came to Dean, one Tuesday night when Dean was making lasagna in the oven, with a picture of a bee knocker on his phone (Thanks a lot,
His heart physically hurts at the memory as he screws the cap on and places it on one of the cabinet’s shelves.
They look up, frowning at the newcomer — a middle-aged blonde speaking on the phone — for unknowingly interrupting his “groove” (he blamed the word choice on Claire, who made him watch
.); meanwhile, Cas got to see Dean in action, spent time with him and got to learn a thing or two about art. So yeah, looking back, Dean supposed it wasn’t all bad.
It wasn’t long after Dean and Cas installed all those bee knockers on the doors of their tiny apartment that Cas bought some more and tried to install them on the
” Dean lets out a deep exhale as he composes himself. “No, to be honest with you, I don’t know how I ended up a sex therapist. Let’s see — I, uh, took a bunch of psych classes in college, and the WGSS classes - and I’ve always wanted to help people — next thing I know, it’s junior year of college, my advisor’s giving me a list of careers that fit the classes I’ve taken so far, I see ‘sex therapist’ on there — somewhere towards the bottom — the rest is history, y’know?” Dean looks at Castiel expectantly.
) commissioned a magical fairy forest mural to grace the walls of the General Hospital’s children’s ward (thank you, Dorothy) that Dean realized he could still give Cas a garden.
Once the bee knobs were installed on all of the cabinet doors in the kitchen, Dean reminded himself that it was all worth it to see the look on Cas’ face every time he saw the knockers and the knobs (the "Thank you!" blowjobs Dean received after approving Cas’ home improvements were very much worth it as well). As for Cas, his mood improved greatly after the minor improvements made to their now-slightly-less-shitty apartment. Dean had to admit, the new bee decor started to grow on him after a while, like a mold growing in a bathroom (or maybe that was the blow jobs talking). And everything was right in their world.
. The cottage itself was spacious (no more bumping into things) but not overly large, the sparkling new appliances worked like a charm, the AC and heater both ran like a dream, the water pressure in the bathroom was
Throughout the story, Castiel enjoyed watching the emotions flit on Dean’s face, but mostly, he enjoyed watching the way Dean’s gorgeous green eyes lit up when he spoke and the way he used his hands to tell his story. Castiel sat there, enraptured by the man before them to the point that it takes them a moment to realize Dean finished speaking.
Once the announcement was made, congratulatory hugs and housewarming gifts were given; stuff owned was either thrown away, donated, or boxed up and carefully organized in the back of the Impala or the U-Haul. Dean and Cas (and Charlie, Sam and Gabe) repainted the entire apartment an off white color, as per the agreement they made with their pompous landlord Crowley (Dean and Cas repainted all the walls in the apartment and Crowley didn’t kick them out for breaking the “No painting the apartment” rule listed on some random page of their lease agreement), before casting one last wistful glance at the apartment and leaving. Afterwards, all of them said goodbye to Missouri and her new grey kitten Jesse, with Dean and Cas accepting the dozen or so casseroles she baked them, knowing better than to decline her offer after learning the hard way. Casseroles in hand, they made their way to the impala, got in, drove off into the sunset and never looked back.
"'Cause it's our first Halloween in our new house, I know. You've been talking about it since your birthday in August."
happy (in turn, Cas rewarded Dean for his patience by fucking Dean in a way that allowed him to see the portrait of Cas as an angel in a homemade loincloth while getting railed by the real Cas from behind. Best. Sex.
The ceiling, Cas decided, (without absolutely no input from Dean, he might add, and he does) should be the night sky. The ceiling, Dean decided, should be left as is. In the end, they compromised and settled on the ceiling being the night sky (in Dean’s defence, Cas’ puppy dog eyes are his kryptonite).
Castiel stares at the man in front of him in wide-eyed awe — again — even more intently than before. “Yes,” he remembered to respond, “How did you know?” Castiel says, frowning slightly and tilting his head.
Cas rinses his mouth with water then with mouthwash, puts his toothbrush in the holder next to Dean’s and wipes the tears he didn’t realize he cried.
for the nearest paint. Fortunately and unfortunately, for both of them, there were several paint pallets and Home Depot bought, gallon-sized cans of paint in various colors; Cas went back for the emerald green paint but Dean mixed things up, scooping up some light blue on his thin brush, which wasn’t enough, and grabbed a thick brush before scooping up some light purple paint. They turned their bodies towards one another but had enough sense to angle their faces away, so that they wouldn’t get paint in their eyes (in hindsight, Dean really should have gotten them goggles), and started
At least until Cas gave in and let Dean paint a portrait of Cas as an angel on the back of their door.
. Regardless of what Cas called it, he was upset about something and after more prodding than was necessary, Dean finally got an answer from Cas.
Her answer comes in the form of a large dog walking into the Dean Cave. He walks up to the couch Cas and Dean are on, sits down in front of them, and proceeds to whine and wag his tail.
“Dean, what are you doing?” (Dean was discovering just how high pitched his voice could get when startled, that’s what Dean was doing.)
See, it all started when fresh-out of grad-school Castiel Novak and struggling-artist Dean Winchester finally removed their heads from their asses and realized they were in love with one another. Then, they decided to live together. It was awesome...at first.
Unable to resist the temptation to do otherwise, Cas slowly pulls Dean in for a kiss. Dean closes the space between them as if he can’t kiss Cas fast enough.
Claire lifts her head from where it rests on Cas’ shoulder. “I don’t know.” Castiel could hear the frown in her tone although they couldn’t see her face. “I guess I’ll...bring it up to Alex after work?”
, we don’t sell milkshakes here,” Claire politely reminds the woman with a fake smile and tension written in every line of her body.
have something to do with Cas living three hours away; it’s not like he could take the train or drive there every day to water the plants, although he did try, at first). Cas’ mood darkened when he learned the lovely nuclear family who bought the house already started making plans to get rid of the garden and replace it with a pool.
"Babe," Dean said in that fondly exasperated, I'm-trying-to-be-patient tone of his, one Cas was very familiar with. "Everything's perfect. The kids are gonna love it. The adults are gonna love it. The whole neighborhood will be talking about this til Christmas." Dean planted a kiss on Cas' cheek and Cas leaned into it. He faced his boyfriend's green eyes, admiring the way Dean's vertical pupils dilated. With the way Dean's breath hitched, Cas could tell his own feline blue eyes were dilated as well. The two of them continued staring into one another’s eyes until the sounds of early trick-or-treat'ers broke the spell.
“My little brother’s a religious studies major,” Dean smiles, beaming with pride, whether pride at himself for knowing the angel Castiel was named after or pride for his little brother, Castiel does not know; what Castiel does know is that Dean’s smile causes somersaults in his stomach.
The illusion itself, like smoke, swirled around their dark grey house, weaving in and out of the cracks in the windows, circling the splintered door, before covering the moldy roof. Once the smoke of the spell cleared the illusion became clear: Dean and Cas' house appeared as a 1950s picturesque red brick house with a white picket fence, inspired by Cas’ favorite horror movie
Castiel gapes at Dean. When Dean’s face begins falling and he starts looking less sure of himself, Castiel schools their features into something a bit more appropriate. “Wow, that must be an interesting job.”
If this continues, they’ll have to start getting used to Dean surprising them and Castiel finds themself not only okay with this but also
“So, if you didn’t go to college for Religious Studies then what did you study?” Castiel’s attention is brought back to Dean.
Dean uses the spatula to move whatever’s in the stove around ― eggs, by the smell that’s wafting through the kitchen ― as he pauses dancing. Once the eggs are sufficiently scrambled, Dean resumes his singing and dancing.
“It’s not?” Dean asks, the hurt in his tone betraying the eyebrow raised in disbelief attempting to be casual and missing it by a mile.
Castiel stood in the garage, carefully pouring a mixed bag of candy in a large plastic lime bowl. Once done, he set the remaining candy in a bucket underneath the table where it was hidden by the plastic tablecloth adorned with cartoon human heads making silly faces.
Casriel gets up, metal chair screeching against the tile floor with a noise that would normally set his teeth on edge if they weren't busy being pinned down by Claire’s glare. She must have heard him get up and knew they were seconds away from intervening because she gives him a glare that could only be interpreted as
), after an argument where Cas, once again, weaponized his puppy dog eyes, and Dean, once again, caved.
All of the half dozen or so customers in the shop turn to face Castiel, but he pays them no mind. He’s here on a mission, which they haven’t forgotten, but walking up to the counter and seeing the variety of ice cream flavors on display through the glass momentarily distracts him. They’ve had a long week — teaching summer classes at the local community college is not an easy feat, less so when the sun decides to shine without mercy.
it, they sit, hands turning white from clenching the sides of the chair, as the metal digs into his palms. Castiel's lips are pressed into a thin line of displeasure and their face begins to hurt from frowning so much, all to keep himself from betraying Claire’s trust, which he’s worked so hard to earn.
), sent Cas a picture of his old garden from their childhood home. In the piece of incriminating evidence that served as proof of Gabe’s being an asshole, said garden fell apart without a Cas to care for it; the flowers Cas meticulously selected were wilted unless already dead and it was obvious the bees in the garden had long abandoned their once lush home. Dean watched Cas get more and more visibly sad as he stared at the picture of his once colourful garden turned dead as a doornail and the sight of it broke Dean’s not-entirely-non-existent heart.
phones, and Castiel has the bills and receipts to prove it). She also crosses her arms and pouts with big watery eyes, like she’s doing now. While her method of expressing her anger and overall dissatisfaction with the world changed over time, Castiel’s method of cheering up his daughter has not, which comforted them as much as it did her.
“Not just Heaven, but the forces of Hell as well.” Dean seemed skeptical and Cas begged him to understand with a wide-eyed look that Dean called his “puppy dog eyes”.
, especially on their skin and clothes. Dean reminded Cas that he’s not the only one who messed up the mural, seeing how Dean, himself, was a very enthusiastic participant. He reassured Cas that the mural wasn’t ruined and even if it was, they could always paint over it. But the most important thing Dean told Cas that night, he whispered into Cas’ ear when their foreheads were pressed together, “I want us to do this together. Just you, me, several paintbrushes, a dozen or so cans and tubes of paint, and my ‘Best of the 80s’ playlist,” and despite never having said the words, Cas understood the meaning behind what Dean meant.
." Cas stared up at Dean from his position sitting on the floor looking like his puppy got run over and Dean's heart hurt for his boyfriend. He didn't know what to say, so he sat down next to Cas on the floor (even though there was a perfectly good, certifiably shitty couch right behind them), wrapped an arm around his boyfriend and best friend of seven years, and listened to Cas tell story after story about how the best garden in the world kept him safe and sane when life got overwhelming. And if Dean's ass got sore (and not for the reason he'd like) while he sat on the hard tile floor listening to stories he already knew, no one mentioned it.
They arrange themselves so Dean can keep their snacks between his folded legs and Cas can wrap an arm around his shoulders.
“Don’t worry, Cas, I’ll teach you.” Dean replied before adding, “Right after we put a different kind of bone in your body,” and punctuating it with a wink.
Castiel's heartaches and he looks at her with sad, sympathetic eyes, but she doesn't meet theirs. He remembers when she was a little girl. She threw the worst tantrums as a toddler and would always throw things before sitting down and crying. Now, at sixteen, she doesn’t throw things in frustration anymore, (thankfully, she grew out of that by the time she was six or so) but she does slam whatever object she has in her hand on the nearest surface (that’s how she broke not one, not two, but
Things aren't over or resolved between Dean and Castiel. Actions have consequences and choices have to be made.
He looked at the map and wandered the halls. It was a shitty layout with shitty labels. He barely knew where he was. At this point he already missed 1st-period Calculus. He figured he would find the exit and use the next bell to ditch this place. He was fucking tired. Didn’t Benny say he could skip a few days? Why couldn’t he just get enrolled and go home afterward? Ugh, this is not how he wanted things to go.
He was grateful for the cool water to quench his parched throat though. Sammy sat on the bed close to him as Dean lifted his shirt to check on his wound. He peeled back all the duct tape and gauze to reveal four long claw marks that went from his hip on the right, up toward the lower portion of his ribs on the left. They were infected before, but now beginning to heal. It was still crusty and oozy around the fishing line stitches but the bright pink hints of scar tissue looked good. They weren’t so much pain anymore, just hella itchy.
Work was being a busboy at Furio. It was a classy (undisclosed gay) club that catered to the older gentlemen with its state of the art cigar room and oxygen/vape bar. They played Sinatra and big band music. The atmosphere was dark but soothing. The place had a nice plush carpet and the drinks were never watered down. Benny was the bartender and worked on a food truck when he wasn’t here. He was the one to get Dean the job and acted like a big brother to him. It was… refreshing, to say the least.
Of course, after that, he did lecture Dean about how fighting is never the right choice and he wanted Dean to stay after school at least once a week to speak with the Counselor. It didn’t matter what day but he needed to arrange it and he needed to go if he didn’t want this on his permanent record. Now he was given the option to stay or go home with his guardian. Dean chewed his lower lip in thought. He doubts Crowley and his buddy boys would start anything today since 4 of his main goons were suspended for the week.
As with most things, Sam’s mood didn’t stay upbeat for long. He had gone to get the Ice cream while Sammy guarded their stuff outside. When Dean came back, he saw Sam glaring at a happy family having a normal birthday party at the Pizza palace across the street. From that point forward, Sam was gloomy and quite frankly Dean was sick of it.
“What are you waiting for? Fuck off already,” Dean said. They moaned but did as they were told. Limping off to god knows where.
“Hey Dean,” Sammy came over. His hazel eyes that didn’t know how to be blue or green were filled with wary hope. “Can we go to Target?”
Castiel looked shocked. He thought about it. Even if he grew up in a cage, at least he never knew starvation. He never had to worry about going without. He had to deal with psychological abuse, of course, but his basic needs were never ever withheld. They wanted him strong and perfect.
Sammy and Dean gave him a rather creepy smile. Sammy rushed off to get him the forms and Dean handed him a pen. “Can you take us over at 8?” Sammy asked with stars in his eyes.
Dean scoffed. “Your money? Is that how's this going to be?” Dean challenged and Sammy faltered. Dean worked odd jobs and never once did he pulled that it’s “my money” because, in this family, everyone shared. It was John’s rule.
“Our Dad dropped the ball on the whole registration. Apparently at Brookshire Middle School and High School, you gotta have a parental there.” Sammy filled in.
“Wait, hold up. Why would they? Usually these losers back off the first time.” Sammy frowns down at his empty bowl. He got up and dished out more. “Start at the beginning.” So Dean did.
“Alright, come over here where the lights good.” Benny motion toward the kitchen. Dean hesitated but hopped up on the table. He was clumsy but he took off his layers and began to peel back his duct-taped bandages. He hissed as his skin was already tender from the constant removal of tape and he knew he had a rash from all that irritation.
Sammy didn’t know what else to say. Everyone’s situations are different and unique. Right now though, his brother was a little too wound up about it. Pensive, and frustrated. Way too invested in this to be honest. So Sammy stared at his brother. Normally something like this, Dean would bitch about it but move on. But Dean was really fixated. Why?
He looked at Castiel now and could still see that little boy. Yet it was fading into something monstrous. The goodness in him was twisting and churning into something dark. He was on a precipice. He wasn’t a child anymore. He was growing into a man.
“I’m not weak! I’m not! It’s just… I can’t rock the boat right now.” Castiel buckled and held his face in his hands. “One wrong move and everything falls apart!”
“I don’t know what to tell you man. Unless the kid that owns that locker comes back, you’re screwed. Maybe you can wiggle out? Leave a note?” Dean said as he scratched his head. And wiggle the boy did. By the time Castiel got free his already mussed hair was a static-y bird’s nest.
“Welcome to Brookshire!” A fellow classmate that was part of the welcome committee said. The high pitch voice was a bit much. He gave her a timid wave, before looking back at Benny. He decided, at this moment, he was going to drop out. Hell, he could finish his grade online. Benny only smiled at his panic. He waved good-bye to Dean as the preppy girl practically grabbed his hand to pull him along. They rounded one corner and the preppy girl dropped the act.
