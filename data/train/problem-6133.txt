. Maybe this career Steve had felt so much pride for wasn’t over just yet. If Tony had taught him anything over the years, it’s that nothing is ever really
They’re met with knowing looks from specifically Pepper and Carol when they return, both of them doing their best to smooth out their suits and look as unruffled as possible. “Sure am parched. I’m gonna grab something to drink,” Tony clears his throat, running a hand through his obvious sex hair.
Their loss to the Irons in the Championship had obviously been the hardest on Tony. It had been a hard-fought game by the entire team, but clearly they hadn’t been the only ones frothing at the mouth for a win. It was a remarkably close match, the final score only coming out to 3-2 after nine long innings. Tony had disappeared as soon as the game was over, most likely taking his off-season vacation early to avoid the media. Steve couldn’t blame him, even if he knew his coping methods weren’t the healthiest.
"Missed ya," the former baseman answers simply before pushing himself off the weights. "Naw, I was here for more physical therapy."
Steve puts on one of his favorite records, Attica Blues by Archie Shepp. Passionate tenor sax fills the small apartment as Steve starts digging around in the fridge for materials to make any sort of meal with. They really need to go grocery shopping since it seems like their current stash is mostly condiments at this point.
“Yeah, I guess so,” Steve answers, not really having thought about it. “I was kind of a sickly kid growing up. Bad immune system, allergic to everything. There was an empty sandlot outside the apartment I grew up in and kids were always gathering down there to play. No one ever invited me until Bucky noticed me watching from the firescape one day and called me down.”
Tony grins broadly, grabbing both from her. “Only for you, Doc. See you next week?” He yanks his shirt back on over his head and zips up his training jacket before hopping off the raised exam chair and hustling out the door, bumping his shoulder against Steve’s on the way out.
Steve just shrugs. "Nothing, really. I mean, I spent money to upgrade my bike, fix my old beater car, but that's about it. The only other things I spend it on is paying rent, buying groceries, and then the rest goes into the bank."
“Hey, don’t judge a book by its cover,” Steve says as they walk to the doors together. “Give it a chance.”
Most of their late night or early morning phone calls involved an inebriated Tony who did everything he could to play it off that he was sober. Steve could see right through the slightly slurred speech and nonsensical tangents he went off of, wishing he could be there to shake some sense into him. He continued to ask Sam to watch out for him, but there’s only so much the man could do. Tony doesn’t have people over and hardly leaves the apartment. The only person he regularly corresponds with outside of Carol would be Tiberius. Steve has never even met the guy, but something about him rubs him the wrong way. He doesn’t trust him to be the one to steer Tony in the right direction, even if they were childhood friends. Ty’s not like Bucky. Steve worries he may just be the opposite.
He jogs the last few feet over to him, grabbing him by the shoulders. “What are you doing out here? You’re going to catch pneumonia! Come on,” he scolds, tugging on Tony to follow him.
He can feel Steve staring at him. The man scoots closer. “Of course it has. We knew that going in. I know we haven’t been able to see each other as much recently, but—”
"I'm sorry, Peggy," Steve says somberly. He knew that Chester and Peggy had been working together since the very beginning. A legacy is certainly ending.
Steve sighs, wiping a hand down his face. “There aren’t bad guys and good guys in this situation. You just did what you thought was right. Doesn’t mean you weren’t a total
“I said I don’t gamble, I didn’t say I don’t play Poker,” And Steve, the little shit, actually flashes him a cocky grin before accepting a fresh refill from Lana.
Seconds later, Tony’s door opens. His gaze lazily drifts over, wondering if he’s still dreaming when he sees Steve standing in the doorway, looking ghastly and downtrodden. There are dark circles under his eyes and day-old stubble shadowing his normally clean-shaven face, his shirt collar wrinkled and hair limply swept to the side. He’s holding a steaming coffee in his hand, wiping a hand down his face as he trudges over to Tony’s bedside. About four steps in, he seems to finally realize that Tony is not only awake, but is sitting up and staring back at him.
Steve blinks. Shit. He’s been so discombobulated from the onslaught of new developments last night that he had completely forgotten why he had showed up to Tony’s in the first place, and what day it is now. He stands up, clutching at his head. “Oh— Uh, I actually— I have to go. I’m sorry, I completely forgot—”
“What about you?” Howard interrupts. “Can’t imagine even a man with your character can stand to be so patient with such a problem child.”
Maria points out the window, down towards the building Steve had seen before from the dining room. He just now notices that the lights are on. “Whenever he’s upset, Tony goes to his lab to do work.” She presses her lips together. “I’m glad he has that safe space at the very least when he wants to get away from everything.”
Steve actually glares at him. “Stop that. You know I hate it when you treat me like I’m just some naive idiot to this stuff. You throw yourself at everything half-cocked and fall back on the excuse that you’re young and dumb, so you don’t get to act like the wise one when it comes to our relationship.”
Firstly, (is it really firstly if I'm putting this at the end? Oh well, I just didn't want to blab a bunch at the beginning of the chapter so you guys could just get to reading it instead of listening to my nonsense) I just want to apologize with how long it took me to get this chapter uploaded for you guys. Believe it or not, I had what I thought was a majority of the chapter written already... and then I just kept writing... and writing... and adding more scenes... and writing... and here we are, at almost 32k words, about twice as long as all the chapters before it. And that's not including an additional 6k or so of a scene I decided to push off onto the next chapter... lol
The Avengers have been doing so well in the past decade that Janet is busier than ever managing them, minimizing her free time to socialize with her now mostly retired cohorts. “They’ll all be glad you made it. And I’m sure everyone will gang up on you complaining about how you’re showing us all up working twice as long and twice as hard as the rest of us old worn-out athletes ever did,” he laughs, opening the door for her. Everyone is already back outside in their seats, the inning having started back up already.
They don’t go to bed just yet, both of them slipping into their shared home office. It’s the only room they’ve actually gotten 100% set up so far, more as a necessity than anything else. When they signed the lease for this Brooklyn flat two months ago, they immediately started getting what was primarily Steve's office together, with a nook in the corner where Tony could reside, tucked away in a comfortable armchair to do whatever coach-type work needed to be done while Steve sat at his computer behind the big mahogany desk. Tony starts rifling through the filing cabinet, combing through copies of all the hand-me-downs of info from Janet’s records until he finds the folders he’s looking for, stacking them up in his arms and retreating to his corner.
“Quit your arguing, boys,” Natasha barks as they all make their way back to the locker room. “Tony, Steve’s right, you shouldn’t have gone for that steal. Steve, get off Tony’s ass about it, he really just ended the game quicker for us. Now the rest of you gather round so I can tell you everything you fucked up on today.”
just to avoid tainting the ‘sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman’,” he air quotes, making a noise of contempt in the back of his throat.
To his surprise, the door opens, only marginally. Tony's peeking at him through the crack that the chain lock allows. His hair is mussed and he's clutching to slacks that he was either getting out of when Steve interrupted, or had just hastily thrown back on.
The Avengers are playing another home friendly today, a double-header against a team from New Hampshire. Despite their loss in last year’s post-season, the team feels stronger than ever so far with all their exhibition games. It was the first year in over a decade since they were even able to make it to the Championship, the team from Manhattan now growing into a fan favorite to take it all the way again this season.
might not care about this, the Avengers have needed those kinds of funds for a while. It helps us short-term by being able to put better offers down for newcomers from the lower leagues, and long-term by improving our facilities and equipment.”
Hesitantly, Peggy pulls it down slightly, leaving it around his neck just in case she needs to replace it. “What was that, honey?”
“No,” Tony denies, soft but insistent. He wipes some sweat from his brow, hands trembling slightly. “I don’t know what’s going on but I can do this, okay? I
“But she thinks you should do it,” Janet elaborates. “You know any coach would be insane to want to give up a pitcher like you, Tony, but she also knows what’s best for her players and she agrees with Fury and I that this is the best decision for you and for the team.”
Tony changes into his away game Avengers uniform, a temporary patch sewn onto the shoulder indicating the All-Star Logo, also emblazoned on the black cap pulled down onto his head. Each player would be wearing their respective team’s uniforms, the visiting International League in their gray road uniforms, while the home team of the Pacifics adorn their white attire.
Here is Steve Rogers, standing 127 feet and 3.5 inches away, looking much older than he had in that grainy footage from fourteen years ago. He was probably around eighteen or nineteen at that time, so he had definitely filled out, that teenage lankiness nowhere to be seen. The jersey is stretched tight around his chest and shoulders and he stands about a head taller than most of the players on the field.
He had left in a hurry. That, or Janet had forced him to. The locker room feels odd in a way, and if Steve hadn’t been so preoccupied with the fact that it must be Tony’s absence, he might realize that none of the TVs are on as they normally were, running some kind of news cycle or sports coverage on low volume.
“Now…” Peggy leans back in her chair, watery eyes glancing back to the heart monitor, still steadily beeping away. “We wait for him to wake up.”
Tony gets out of the car and looks around, a flickering neon light source catching his eye from across the street. There’s a run-down looking bar with only a couple of cars parked out front, but that’s more sign of life than Tony can see finding anywhere else. He takes a scrap of paper and pen out of his glovebox and jots down a quick note, sticking it under one windshield wiper.
The media’s still feasting on the smörgåsbord that is Tony’s surprise coming out at the press conference that was supposed to be deflecting his so-called
When he comes back out, Steve and Peggy are gone. Doctor Hallstatt speaks before he can ask where they went. “I asked them to step outside just so I can evaluate your condition properly, just the two of us.”
“A valid follow-up,” Tony commends. He moves a little closer, sitting casually on the edge of Natasha’s desk. Steve’s gaze can’t help but be drawn up to the motion of his leg swinging carelessly, right above the ground, giving yet another glimpse at the His Tony he remembers. “You’re quitting.”
The first pitch has already been thrown when the sliding door opens from behind them, everyone turning to see Tony has finally made it.
Steve stands at the first base, ready as the first of Pittsburg’s lineup takes the plate. He glances across the field, catching his third baseman’s eye. Bucky grins at him, giving a nod.
Steve brushes the leftover pizza crumbs off his jeans as he grabs his jacket off the back of the couch. The library is only a couple of blocks away, so it’s no hassle whenever Steve needs to go and use a computer. He understands the convenience of owning one of those new Macintoshes in his home, and it isn’t like he couldn't afford it with his salary. The main struggle comes from not being able to keep up with the new tech wave happening in America right now. He's still trying to get used to the Walkman Bucky got him a few birthdays ago.
Natasha smiles cruelly. "You know what? You changed my mind. We can negotiate." She points at the pitcher's mound. "You're going to pitch a ball to every single player on this team. Every ball they hit is an extra fifteen minutes on today's practice for you."
“Can I get you anything to drink?” Tony asks, wandering back behind the bar. Steve can already see a couple of bottles of straight liquor on the floor by the couch, as well as an empty glass or two strewn across the coffee table back before Tony bothered with such a formality.
Most people probably think Tony takes everything he has for granted, but he knows exactly how lucky he is to be a nineteen-year-old athlete/engineer who owns his own multi-million-dollar abode in Malibu with a private beach. He was born into brilliance; why wouldn’t he be thankful for everything he’s managed to make for himself because of that?
Accepting all the pats on the back from his teammates as he heads into the dugout to grab some water, he feels a hand seize him by the back of his jersey, choking him for a moment as he’s yanked backwards. “Ack— Hi, Coach.”
Steve surrenders his wants to Tony’s needs, stepping aside to allow the man to flourish beside him, as equal partners and friends in this. The season progresses with upwards momentum, the months passing by with win after win. Steve doesn’t play every game, even with it being his last season. No reason to keep pushing himself with his bad knee. He plays when he can and is grateful for the opportunity and support of the team and his fans. He feels the wall between him and his love for the sport start to come down again, Tony’s presence helping mend that relationship. Ever since the reaction to Tony’s coming out years ago, Steve felt confused and misled about the honorable, principled sport he’s centered his entire life around. It was a tough blow to shoulder, that removal of the rose-colored lens, but now he’s better for it, acknowledging that it’s an individual’s values that make the person.
He can’t help but grin, fixing his eyes on her. She’s pointedly glaring out at the city below, refusing to look over at him. “Uh huh, yeah, the team sure will. Aaaand who else?”
He doesn’t really know how to answer that question. He awkwardly shifts the box under his arm, looking down at it and then back at Tony. “I… I wanted to thank you for the gift.”
Steve's in awe as Tony uses a long blade along the edge of the table to cut a huge square of his material out, then climbs up on top of the table to lay out the blueprint on some kind of lightboard that hung over the table. He hit a switch and a projection of his blueprint appeared on the material below it. Tony jumps back down onto the ground, taking a bite of his sandwich. "Ay'shur crmnr," he explains around a mouthful of ham and cheese as he pulls out his ruler to make sure his measurements are correct.
"Funny, people don't normally frown that much when they're glad," Tony responds, smirking up at his coach.
Peggy and Steve absorb this news in silence. Peggy moves to sit next to Tony’s bed, taking his bandaged hand in her own as gently as possible.
“Okay, feel better, man,” Clint shrugs. “I’ll see you later…” He throws one last odd look Steve’s way before exiting.
just yet, but Steve has less reservations about it than before. As reckless and apathetic as Tony can act in certain situations, he’s completely the opposite when it comes to their sex life. He always makes sure Steve is taken care of and comfortable, while also not sacrificing the sensuality of the moment. He has no doubts that Tony’s
Steve slips from group to group, not staying in any one place for too long. Bucky is over at the pool table, showing who Steve assumes is some player's sister "proper form". Bucky happens to glance up as Steve stares, throwing his friend a wink as he tightens his arm around the girl’s shoulders. Classic Bucky.
A few of the players around Tony glance back over their shoulders, only faltering their step for a moment before they decide to keep walking. Tony does come to a full stop, turning around with his hands in his jacket pockets. “Hammer,” he greets evenly. “I’m surprised they let you back in after the shit show of a performance you gave three years back.”
He can see Tony’s mouth shape the word as he squints through the sheet of rain pouring down. He’s soaking wet, dark hair slicked down over his forehead and clothes clinging to his form.
He makes sure his silver tie is as straight as humanly possible before exiting to avoid being raked over the coals by Morita. Steve is happy to see them all again, his old baseball buddies all lounging around the room, shooting the shit and teasing each other like the good old days. The Howling Commandos have gotten old too, just another reminder that Steve hasn’t always been the best at keeping in touch with all of them over the years.
Steve chuckles weakly. “I’m not sure I’m the man for that mission. Your son doesn’t like me very much.”
SportsCenter is normally playing on the big, boxy televisions in the gym, and it isn’t really something Steve tends to focus on until he sees a picture of Howard Stark show up on the screen before switching to a picture of a younger man who bears a striking resemblance to the business mogul. He must be the son that Howard and Peggy were talking about four years ago. It’s a striking photo, a black and white portrait of a youthful boy made out to look like a man. He can’t be more than eighteen, but has the smooth cheekbones and sharp jawline of his father. His long lashes cast shadows over dark eyes, an intimidating gaze paired with a coy, crooked grin. Tony has the expression of a man who’s just won a table of bet chips on a bullshit hand.
“I’m good, I’m good,” Steve hears Tony mumble against Rhodey's shoulder. Steve still stands, frozen in one spot as players move around him to give Tony hugs or comforting pats on the shoulders. Their pitcher nods at their commiseration, expression still giving nothing away. Natasha stands off to the side with arms crossed and lips pressed in a tight line, Steve the last player not having retreated to the dugout.
After he’s met with everyone who wanted to congratulate him on the win, Steve heads over to his motorcycle. He starts the engine of the Harley-Davidson before zooming off, heading back towards his and Buck's two-bedroom in the city.
His prospects aren’t promising. The six or so people in the bar (including the lone bartender) all turn to look at him with suspicious eyes when he enters. He’s hoping he looks bedraggled enough to not attract any unwanted attention, hands shoved into the pockets of his long pea coat as he slowly makes his way to the bar, scanning the room for any kind-faced civilians. There’s a man sitting at one end of the bar, head lowered and face shrouded by a cap, a middle-aged couple sitting in a booth together with a shared pitcher of beer between them, and two grizzled looking men with grey beards playing darts in the corner. Tony saunters over and takes a seat at the middle of the bar, leaving ample distance between himself and the rest of the patrons. No sense in not at least grabbing a drink while he ponders his options.
Ty seems to hold up the facade for a few seconds longer before sighing and crossing his arms, leaning against the wall. “Always right to the point, aren’t you?”
Tony deserves an award for holding himself back, not even so much as twitching at the low blow. He refuses to give Ty anymore than he’s already getting, keeping his expression composed. “You’ll finally have the spotlight with me out of the picture. Funny, I guess not even the steroids were enough to surpass me.”
Steve is through the public library doors at exactly 7:49. The girl behind the counter glowers at first before she realizes who it is disrupting her last peaceful moments before freedom. "Oh, it's just you. Hey, Steve."
Tony isn’t bluffing when he says that. For the past month he’s been in the early spring training specifically for pitchers, of which there are many more on his new team. Counting the whole 40-man roster, Tony is one of eight. He’s sure because of his talent he’ll be put on the active 25-man roster for the entire season, but he’s already feeling a very different energy from the teammates he’s met thus far. About half have been the usual amount of friendly, but the others have pretty much just ignored his existence altogether. Probably just bitter that he’ll more likely than not be taking away their opportunities to see actual play time this season.
On Steve’s other side, he’s able to engage in the hardcore baseball talk that always occurs when Nat and Bucky around. He isn’t sure if he’s ever met two people more destined to be together based on their analysis and love of the sport alone, both of them still keeping up with teams across both leagues. They’re fascinated by the World Team, never having seen any of the International teams play in person.
Tony continues to stare silently out the window, mouth pressed in a tight line. “He… he didn’t make it sound like that,” he says quietly.
don’t even know— but you’re here now. And I don’t think you plan on going anywhere next season,” he smiles with feigned smugness. “In fact, I’ll bet right now that you’re still here after December signings. And if you are, you have to get an apartment. A
“Damn it,” Steve huffs under his breath, wiping a little sweat off his brow. He needs to focus. Don’t worry about Bucky.
“Thanks,” he says quietly, searching Steve’s face for more. “I meant what I said before, about wanting to fix things. Make ‘em right. Running the company the past few years has been… good. It’s a good change of pace. I got to invest my time and money into more than the empire Dad built for me, I had responsibilities and more to offer. But… it wasn’t my passion like I thought. I wasn’t sure how much longer I wanted to be doing it, and there’s plenty of other people out there who are more deserving of manning that ship. I knew I’d be passing it off slowly but surely, but then last fall when I heard this was going to be your last season… It was the last push I needed.”
The All-Star Games aren’t usually such high-point matches, but the 1991 showdown between the International and Pacific Coast Leagues will be one to remember for the rest of baseball history. There’s a short break for celebration and mourning for both teams, everyone shaking hands (Tony keeps his promise to himself and ignores Hammer during these exchanges) as they wait for the MVP awards to be announced.
"I'm great, sir," Steve says, standing to meet the vigorous handshake he knew was coming. "Thank you for inviting me for dinner."
“I’m down here, dipshit!” Tony yells from the kitchen, his eggs quickly turning from over easy to completely scrambled as he gives up on trying to recover his breakfast.
Natasha and Janet are already busy, their phones ringing nonstop as media outlets try to get in contact with them about the news that The Avengers would be moving onto the post-season. Somehow, the team starts organizing a spontaneous celebration at the hotel, Steve not at all surprised that Tony is at the helm of the entire operation, charming his way through the hotel staff and their managers and probably appealing to their nature by slipping them a hefty tip and promise for good word-of-mouth.
Tony’s arms remain crossed. “I don’t like to be handed things, and I also don’t give a shit about whatever amount is written on that check. I’m not in this for money.”
A woman emerges from the arched doorway underneath the stairwell, carrying a large platter in her hands. "Anthony!" she greets in elation, sweeping towards them in a long dress the color of dark sapphire, the plunging neckline accentuated with thin ropes of silver necklaces stacked atop one another. Her blonde hair is shoulder length and perfectly curled, and while Steve can tell she’s probably at least twenty years younger than Howard, she still wears makeup to emulate a woman much younger than that. "I made hors d’oeuvres!”
He doesn’t cry like he expected, but he does get a little choked up towards the end. Blinking a bit to clear his blurry vision, Tony gets to his feet and wipes his nose off on his sleeve before he turns back to Steve. “Happy now?”
glancing up only when he notices Steve driving almost the opposite direction of the stadium. “Do you need directions, Gramps?”
Tony then swears under his breath, dropping his laces in frustration. Steve almost steps forward to offer his help, but Rhodes quickly swoops out of the whirl of moving bodies around them to save the day. “Tone, what the hell are you doing? Here, I got you.” The dark-skinned man crouches down next to the bench.
Steve hangs all their wet clothes and goes to their lockers. Tony doesn’t have a spare set of clothes in his, but luckily Steve came prepared. He changes into his own clothes before pulling out a set of sweats for Tony as well. He leaves them folded and sitting on one of the shelves in the showers, quickly checking to make sure Tony is still standing.
“I think you should stay,” Steve blurts out immediately, now making it Tony’s turn to raise his eyebrows in surprise.
Howard Stark is extending a very personal invitation to him. The last time the two had talked, Tony wasn't even in the picture, and Howard was drunk and raving over how big of a fan he was. Steve is going into this dinner already on a pedestal, and even if it is just a friendly invitation, that pedestal is automatically placed in the lion's den because of Howard's son.
For the next couple of weeks, Steve is glued to the news cycle. He actually listens to the radio in his car on the way to and from the stadium, leaves his TV on in the background while at home hoping to hear something of Tony’s whereabouts. No one seems to have a clue, most of them stating he has not been spotted in New York or California, but that they’ve heard he’s back in Malibu making arrangements for the funeral and memorial services. Natasha tells him Fury will be flying out and that there’s a ticket for him if he wants it. It doesn’t feel like his place. He wants to support Tony, but he had only met Howard twice and Maria once. It wouldn’t feel right to go, and he wasn’t sure if he could handle the rejection if he showed up and Tony didn’t want him there.
Tony stops, turning to look at him. Clear blue eyes are earnest and searching, flitting over Tony’s face before landing on where his hand is fisted in the sleeve of his jersey as if the limb had acted out of his own accord. “Good luck,” he eventually settles on, looking like there’s so much more he wants to say.
They drive to the other towns along the Outer Cape, Tony giving Steve a tour of his old stomping grounds. The area isn’t quite as popular outside of the Summer months, and they’ve come before the Thanksgiving rush of families who come back to their holiday homes. He has multiple seafood restaurants in Provincetown he happily takes Steve to, and after dinner they walk down the street, hand-in-hand.
Tony hesitates. While he’s tried to shove the meeting into the recesses of his mind for the past few days, he hasn’t really thought about how he wants to breach the topic with Steve. Part of him thinks maybe he can just ignore it and then it’ll all go away. His contract will go through, he’ll still be playing on the Avengers come Spring, and no one even has to know this was even open for discussion.
Even with all that excitement, what Peggy had mentioned offhand resonates with him. What happens if he does get sold? The Stars are on the lower end of financial prospects in the MLB. Players are sold off and traded all the time, no matter what the player themselves wants. His contract can already be set in stone when the next season starts and he won’t really have much say in negotiation. It will always be a possibility that lingers in the back of Steve's mind.
. Your Daddy isn't here now to give you any special treatment. You're on my field now, Stark. Tuck in your shirt,” Natasha orders. She’s normally this harsh on new blood, but the malice in her voice seems oddly personal.
“What song was that?” Steve asks quietly, almost hating to follow up such beautiful refrain with his own boring, flat voice.
They stare at each other tensely for a few moments, but Steve is the first to bow out. Tony is still glaring at him as he cups his face and leans in to kiss him. Tony turns his face away, Steve’s nose rubbing gently against his cheek. He attempts to coax Tony back into a kiss, but he’s steadfast in his stubbornness, letting Steve kiss along his jaw and mutter his. “I love you”s against his ear. He does his best to stand his ground, but his obstinance no match when Steve pries his scarf away from his neck and presses his warm lips there. Tony feels his pulse quicken beneath his mouth, a soft sigh escaping him as he tilts his head back.
Steve blushes, shaking his head. "I didn't— I just meant so I don't have to come searching for you in the endless marble maze."
Tony looks directly into the camera as she holds the mic back out to him. Steve knows out of all the people watching from the other side of the TV screen, feeling like they’re making eye contact with America’s Favorite Pitcher, this message is for no one else but him. Tony presses two fingers to his lips, kissing them and holding them out to the camera in a peace sign. “To the future.”
The Milky Way and twinkling dots begin to fade as the sky lightens up, the sun not yet peeking up over the horizon. Tony hears some movement inside the old beach house. Some tinkling in the kitchen. Steve finding the bottle of rum he had cracked open in the middle of the night and drained half of, not bothering to hide the evidence. He can hear the said bottle being put away, the glass rinsed out in the sink. Some more shifting about. Tony called ahead of time to have the fridge and pantry stocked with a few essentials from town. Even on vacation Steve insists on waking up at the ass crack of dawn to make breakfast where Tony would have rolled over and gone back to sleep (if he had stayed in bed in the first place.)
rule in place as well, but that would be practically impossible considering the two people he’s working with. For a gay man and lesbian woman, Carol and Tony sure liked to flirt with each other more than anything else.
"Oh boy," Steve huffs under his breath. He can’t help but grin as he fits himself between his fellow teammates. He accepts the shot glass and cheerses along with everyone else, tossing it back. Steve pulls a slight face as he set the empty glass back on the bar. "Why is it always tequila with you, Barnes?"
"You should've seen me with the kid. I feel like an actual cougar taking candy from a baby," the voice laughs. "Yeah, already got his room number... Tony is such a naïve kid, the way he was mooning over me stroking his ego at the bar... Oh I'll do plenty more stroking, you know I have my ways." Steve quickly realizes this is a one-sided conversation, and she must be talking on the phone. "I'll get that out of him and more. I'm sure he'll be ready to spill every juicy detail he has about Stark Industries and how he
"He asked to see warm up swings," Steve says aloud now, disrupting the conversation. He watches the teen pitcher do his stretches as their first batter, Victor “Vision” Nightshade, steps up to the plate. "...Why do you think that is?"
“Alright, you know the doctor’s orders. Lay down,” Steve instructs with a smile, kissing the top of Tony’s head and steering him towards the large bed in the room. “Why don’t you get yourself comfortable and pick out a movie or something? I can order some dinner up—”
overdue for retirement. I won’t be able to rest easy unless I can find someone capable enough to fill the position— Probably because Fury’s ghost would haunt me if I didn’t—” she glances towards the sky before looking back at Steve. “And, well, I’m just going to be straightforward with you: I want you to take over as Manager of the Avengers.”
“Aw, you made me breakfast, you shouldn’t have!” The man grins, leaning casually against the door frame, outfitted in a neon tracksuit and windswept hair as if he just stepped out of a J.C. Penney ad.
He doesn’t know this Bucky guy aside from the stories he’s heard from Steve (and there have been plenty), but for some reason he feels comfortable enough to tell him what happened. “Long story short: A major league team is offering to buy me from the Avengers, but I don’t want to go. Steve kept trying to convince me that I should do it like he didn’t even care if it meant me having to leave.”
Steve scoffs, letting Bucky fiddle with the little flower pinned to his lapel that was already perfectly straight
Tony’s short stint in the Majors did wonders for him as a player. He was always phenomenal, but as Steve watches him day after day, he realizes that Carol and the competitiveness of the Major League really has brought out the best in him as a player. His communication with the rest of the team is better, he’s more receptive and less confrontational. Tony would hate hearing it from him, but Steve really does view him as a model sportsman now.
“I’m okay, I’m okay,” Steve insists, getting up to one knee. He stays in that position for a few moments, Tony staring down at his bad leg in worry. Natasha and the ref make it to his side, one of the medics in tow.
“Please, darling, did you really think I hadn’t figured it out by now?” Peggy deadpans, seating herself on the edge of Tony’s bed while Steve sheepishly pulls one of the chairs back up and rests a hand on Tony’s thigh while he eats. “You two have my blessing of course, even though Steve
Because they’re based in such a politically charged area, naturally, home fans and Tony’s own neighborhood all have
He sits there in silence, almost expecting to see Steve appear beside his window at any moment. He’d knock gently on the glass with one knuckle, face out of view from Tony’s position. He’d roll down the window by an inch and look up to see Steve’s apologetic gaze peeking at him through the gap. ‘
Despite the rocky middle portion of the game, they end up winning against Rochester, their winning streak thus far continuing. Their prospects have only been increasing since the last couple of seasons, and they’re slowly but surely solidifying themselves as a fan favorite in the league once more. It’s still early on in the season, but the fact that they haven’t lost a game yet has all of them in high spirits.
“Tell that to the six-figure contracts,” she sighs before gathering up all the cards and shuffling them between two expert hands. “Alright, what’s next, Poker?”
And then it’s morning, and far, far too bright. Tony shifts in bed, groping blindly for a pillow to pull over his head in a vain attempt to block out the light. He’s laying on his stomach, face pressed into the mattress when he feels a weight shift on the bed next to him. He kicks his foot out instinctively, feeling it connect with something solid.
outside of where he wants them to, the first one a ball, and the second meeting an indirect swing that sends it flying foul. He takes a deep breath as he pulls the next ball close to his chest, holding it there for a moment before the pitch. He imagines the feeling of Steve’s calming hand, warm and assuring, pressing against his knee.
The most buzz around the team is centered around Tony Stark and his impressive skills shown during this pre-season, everyone anxious to see when he would grace the pitcher’s mound with his presence. Natasha and Janet sit off to the side, both of them doing uncanny impressions of a pair of cats who just chowed down on a couple of canaries. Steve glances around at the group as they all listen in, wondering if anyone is going to show any kind of resentment towards the outsider of the team for garnering all of the attention. Strange is the only one who looks outwardly peeved, but Steve also thinks that’s just his face.
. There are enough opposing forces that bear down on their relationship already, and if they have to add the distance and contrary schedules to that, Tony can’t imagine how things will last.
Twenty-four against one. Steve isn’t a fan of those odds, even though Tony deserves it for being such a disrespectful smart ass on his first day here. Doing the math quickly in his head, if none of them miss the pitches Tony throws, he's going to be here for an extra six hours. Every last player on the Avengers knew that Natasha will make Tony pay for every minute in blood, sweat, and tears.
“Tony,” Steve sighs in frustration, rubbing a hand down his face. “I’ve been patient. I understand that maybe this is new territory for you, but it’s new to me too. I just think we should be able to talk about this
As long as the Bisons win this. Their game began shortly after the Avengers’ match against Rochester, the entire team booking it back to the hotel afterwards so they can catch the tail end of the game that will be deciding their fate.
to be where he is at all times. He comes from a similar background as Tony: old money, kind of a shitty father, came to the Triple-A’s to sort of prove himself worthy of a spot in the Majors. He had apparently gotten offers from Major League Teams straight out of college, but he had turned them down to play for the Avengers instead. He’s one of the older vets to the team, having played for them even longer than Steve. If he remembers correctly from what Natasha has told him, Thor has been around as long as she’s been coach.
Steve rolls over and cracks an eye open at the alarm clock, seeing flashing numbers blinking back at him. He reaches around the back of the nightstand, grasping the cord and giving a tug. The plug easily follows, confirming his suspicions that Tony was adamant about Steve having a relaxing weekend to the point of sabotaging his usual six a.m. wake up.
all the of-age guests at least get a little tipsy, Steve feels that niggling guilt and worry for his partner. It’s not easy for Tony who had always fallen back on the excuse of his alcoholism developing out of being a “social drinker” to be in an environment like this. When they would go out to bars with friends, he’d get antsy and irritable. Most nights, they'd leave early. The very smell of alcohol used to set Tony on edge.
Tony is yelling as he sprints away from Steve as fast as he can up the street, ducking and weaving as Steve takes chase, firing snowballs at him with expert aim. He nails Tony in the back on more than one occasion, the pitcher able to dodge out of the way if he dares stop to look over his shoulder.
He heads for the door without waiting for Tony. He chances one last glance around the bar to catch a few suspicious stares from curious onlookers before he hops off the barstool and follows after Bucky.
A familiar voice with an English accent breaks through his spiraling thoughts. “Margaret Carter— Yes, is he alright?— What do you mean I can’t see him?”
Tony is already walking over to the sidelines, well aware he’s the reason for the time out call. Steve reaches out and clasps a hand on his shoulder, giving a slight squeeze. “What’s going on, Tony? I know you wanted to play and you hate hearing this, but I think your performance speaks for itself,” he’s keeping his tone even and diplomatic, sensitive to the unmeasurable weight bearing down on Tony’s shoulders. “Do we need to pull you?”
Tony freezes in front of the mirror above the sink when the door clicks shut behind him, and it’s not because he’s looking particularly handsome this morning. He looks and feels like he got hit by a truck. There’s still some leftover swelling around his eye and jaw, spotty bruises yellowing in some spots and still deep shades of purples and blues in others. There's a couple of healing scratches on his face, but his nose and jaw look mostly intact.
Longoria doesn’t know what hit him, Tony can see it in his face as he drops his bat and walks off the field, tossing his cap to the ground once he reaches the dugout like a frustrated child. Tony can’t help but laugh, throwing his head back in exuberance. It feels good to finally be where he should’ve been for the past two innings, but he isn’t going to let what can’t be changed distract him from his goal.
Steve can’t get a read on Bucky’s face while he gets the news. He’s not exactly happy, but it’s better than nothing, and for now that will have to be enough.
Tony sneers and tosses Steve a pair of goggles. "I do my best work drunk. Wear those if it makes you feel any safer." He flips a switch on the machine and reaches for some kind of arm that's suspended over the table. The machine hums loudly until a beam of bright blue light jets out in a perfect line. Tony starts guiding the laser along the pattern, his face set in deep concentration.
Tony continues to stare at him like he’s shown up on his doorstep with a second head growing out of his neck. “You couldn’t have done that on the phone?” He asks, mirth in his tone as he fights a smile.
Dressed only in his underwear, Steve slides out of bed and gropes along the wall until he’s able to find a light switch. His clothes are still strewn about the floor, but he also notices something folded at the foot of the bed. It’s a set of his own sweats, Steve holding them up to see they are the clothes he had let Tony borrow after his melt down in the rain a few months back. He had completely forgotten ever giving them to him, touched that Tony had actually thought to set them out for Steve upon waking up.
Steve turns the car off, sitting back in his own seat. “I think you should visit. Just for a minute. I’ll be right here waiting.” He leans over in front of Tony and throws the car door open with a creak. He continues to sit petulantly, staring straight ahead and ignoring the now open door that’s just waiting to clip some unsuspecting sidewalk cyclist. “We’re going to be late.”
Peggy stares at him in shock for a moment before composing herself, her finger twisting in the cord of the phone. "I'm going to have to call you back, dear. Yes, goodbye." She hangs up the phone and stands up from her desk. "Steve, what nerve do you have to come storming into the office when I'm on a personal phone call with my nephew—"
He can hear some shifting on the other end of the line, Tony shrugging. “I normally go to the family vineyard in Italy but… It didn’t…” A sigh. “I don’t know. Didn’t feel right this year.”
“I plead the fifth,” Tony says, following her out onto the back deck. The little cabin is tucked away near the tree line inland rather than perched as a cliff facing waterfront like his own cottage. He sits on the porch swing with Carol, gently rocking them back and forth with his foot occasionally grazing the ground.
Steve can't help but burst into laughter at Tony's expression. His body is still thrumming with laughter after they're seated.
, breathing against the sensitive furl of skin, gently teasing at it with just the tip of his tongue penetrating him. Of all the people he’s been with, no one has ever made Tony
“You know everything, don’t you?” Steve asks with a laugh. Tony expects the comment to be scathing, but Steve actually sounds amused more than anything. “You really should see it though. It looks like it just started too.”
A knock comes to his suite's door and Steve has to check his tie in the mirror one more time before answering.
There’s even more of them outside of the hotel, news evidently spreading rather quickly about where both teams’ players were staying. Tony squints against the flashing bulbs of the cameras and doesn’t stop for the fans this time, quickly escaping to the refuge of the lobby.
He enters a spacious lofted area, squinting as he adjusts to the first room he’s been in where the light from outside is allowed to shine freely through the glass windows. Tony is hunched at his desk, scribbling things down on scattered papers while some kind of code seems to be running on his computer monitor. It’s reminiscent of the workshop Steve saw in the garage back at his family home in Malibu, but surprisingly more organized. There’s industrial shelving units along the walls housing all sorts of mechanical creations that don’t make sense to him, rolling carts full of tools and metal pieces placed around the room.
"Quite the view, huh?" Howard asks, sidling up next to Steve with his hands in his pockets as he looks out over the ocean.
As reports surrounding the tragedy begin to die down over the following days, Steve has to work a little harder to try and dig up exactly what Tony has been up to. He hasn't appeared before any outlets or issued a single public statement, but it does come out that while he’s keeping their family home, there is an estate sale for most of their assets. Paintings, furniture, family heirlooms- really anything not technically owned by Stark Industries- will be auctioned off with 100% of the proceeds going to the various foundations Maria had started. The numbers aren’t definite, but while the world grieves for the loss of a baseball legend, Tony very quietly raises hundreds of millions of dollars for youth homeless shelters, education for special needs children, victims of domestic and sexual violence, AIDs funds around the world, and so much more. Steve himself makes a note of all of Maria Stark’s charitable endeavors and gives a notice to Janet to disburse a portion of his income from the year to those donation centers.
Peggy truly is a terrifying creature when she’s angry. Steve remembers how her accent seemed to strengthen when she would lecture the team, calling them
Thank you thank you thank you thank you to everyone who's left such kind comments and reviews after this last chapter was posted. It took a little additional time to get the "official" ending out here, but I finally did it. Truth be told, it was almost finished a month ago....... and then Endgame happened. (No spoilers, but I can say to stay tuned for a fix it fic or two inspired from that movie lol).
With speed Tony shouldn’t be surprised by, Steve is out of his chair and on him in an instant, grabbing his arms and forcing him away from the table to prevent further destruction. Tony’s thrashing attempts at escape are futile once Steve decides a better approach is to just wrap his arms around him, trapping his arms down against his sides. Tony still has legs though, and uses them by kicking out, foot managing to clip his chair and send it toppling to the side, crushing more glass underneath it.
“I don’t want your money, Stark,” Bucky interrupts, waving him off. “I was actually coming into the city tonight anyway to visit a friend, so no skin off my nose.”
“Oh, so that’s how we’re going to play,” he growls, immediately digging his hands into the snow to start packing a snowball in retaliation.
All the attention is turned on the confrontation, Tony running over from the pitch to grab Steve by the arm and tug him away. “Drop it, Steve! This is what Hammer wants, just leave it alone!” He hisses angrily, clawing at Steve’s bicep as he gets a good hold on him and manages to drag him back by a couple of feet. If one more player for their team gets kicked out, they’re done for. With how the game is going so far, they can’t afford to lose anyone else, especially not their Captain.
He lets Tony spin him around and walk him backwards to the bed, crawling into his lap yet again as he sits down on the foot of the massive bed. Experimentally, Steve slides his hands lower, holding Tony’s hips as he grinds them forward. He finally feels more than just a hint of hardness beneath Tony’s pants as the man straddles his lap again, wondering what the hell he’s supposed to do with… that.
The corner of Natasha’s lips twitch. “I’m not your coach anymore, Tony. You don’t have to butter me up.” She nudges him back and takes a long drag from her cigarette. “...Coach Danvers is smart. Hopefully she’ll have the patience to deal with you.”
Stifled laughter ripples through the group, Hammer fake laughing to try and convince himself people are laughing
“Tony you’re freezing,” he sighs at the shivering mess of a man in his arms, gently depositing him on the tiled floor once they get to the showers. He cranks up the hot water, angling the showerhead so that it’s pointed towards Tony who’s leaned up against the wall. Steve’s rain jacket had already been abandoned in the locker room, but his under layers are still just as wet as Tony’s. With nothing left to lose and Tony still a crying heap on the floor, Steve sits down in front of him, the spray hitting the back of his neck and cascading down to wet whatever surface of him that had previously remained dry.
Natasha smirks, clearly amused by Steve’s bewilderment. “You don’t know all your players as well as you think you do. I know Clint doesn’t exactly scream family man, but you’d be surprised.” She folds a blanket and places it carefully over the back of one couch, a knowing smirk on her face. “Maybe you could learn a little more about everyone else if you paid as much attention to them as you do with Tony.”
She’s proven right as they transition from Spring Training into the real season, the Avengers ticket sales are through the roof every game. The response is still extremely mixed, most fan’s overwhelmingly positive about Tony’s grandiose return to the sport, while there are others who are still calling for a boycott that will never happen. The team stands as a united front alongside their pitcher.
Janet looks a little startled and confused, frowning at Steve. "What? Why do you need Stark's room number?"
They walk down to some nearby docks, finding a bench to sit on to watch the sunset. The water laps gently against the posts below them, a few birds hopping along and cocking their heads in interest at Steve and Tony before flitting away when they realize there’s no crumbs to be had here. Tony presses himself in close to Steve, the man looping an arm around his shoulders to keep him close and warm. He clasps Steve free hand between both of his, closing his eyes to just enjoy the peace and quiet.
They end up losing, but it’s still a game well played, Steve giving his respects to the other team as they go down the line and shake hands. He gives Williams a pat on the back, letting him know what a fantastic job he did as shortstop as he follows the rest of the team back into the locker room.
Steve’s eyebrow twitches in irritation and his blue eyes flicker up from the book. “Sorry that I didn’t bring my entire wardrobe with me.”
The Irons’ opener is a power hitter and ends up sending the ball sailing to the far corner of the park. It gets fumbled and rolls, Quill scooping it up late and struggling to get it into the infield. Steve does his best to try and save the play once the ball gets to him, but it’s too late. The Irons’ player makes it all the way to home, scoring a run and tying the game up yet again.
An addition onto the back end of the house is the studio, both of them putting in the design work to make it the perfect space to suit both their needs. Plenty of natural lighting, shelving and storage for all of Tony’s tinkering and Steve’s painting materials. There are easels and canvases, rolling work benches and computers, paintbrushes mingling with screwdrivers. They’ve only had one or two accidental mix-ups between mugs holding Steve’s paint water and Tony’s coffee, but other than that things usually run smoothly whether they’re working at the same time or not.
As Tony continues on, Ty’s indifference visibly shifts into that of derisive satisfaction, a cruel smile stretching over too-white teeth. “Look at you, clever boy, always able to figure it out.”
Tony stares up at the barren tree branches arching overhead, blowing slightly in the wind. “Two years,” he answers, only surprised by how long it took Carol to bring it up. There’s no point in hiding it or trying to convince her she’s got it all wrong. Anyone with two eyes would know the truth from a single glance with the way they’ve been free to
Their hotel is right on the strip, and conveniently connected to one of the larger casinos in the area. Tony knows most of the places around here and is sure they’ll bounce between a few locations tonight, but he wants to start strong. Going to Caesars Palace was just asking to get swarmed considering the high amount of sports betting that went on there. A little too high profile when it was just him and Steve going out without additional security detail.
Another century seems to pass before the referee steps forward and rules Chen as out. Cries of outrage fill the stadium, the booing overpowering at the prospect of a tie after all that, everything they’d gone through in the past few hours. Rezzo strides back to the team, anger clearly written across his face, but there’s still a passionate fire in his eyes.
The parking lot is still pretty swarmed with fans looking for players to sign autographs. Even though there's a fence keeping them away from the stadium, Steve still goes over to interact with them. He knows what it would've meant to him to have a ball, glove, or jersey signed by his favorite player at that age. It’s going to be such a trip if the MLB starts selling Stars jerseys with his name on it. For now, he’s perfectly happy signing merchandise of his old teams from the minors.
Tony closed his eyes, his expression becoming pinched when he breathed out.  He looked miserable, and Steve immediately backed away.  Had he done something wrong?  "Tony?"
"Doesn't always work, but I do try.  I am, so to speak, only human," Tony said with a shrug.  Jealousy, at least, had never been something he had to fight too hard.
"Just remember, if she wants that scholarship, I want a minimum three year contract with SI.  I'm not letting that little monster go to one of my competitors."
He and Tony worked quickly to get them out of the harness.  They were coming around.  Leon tried to struggle, but Susan took her helmet off and was speaking frantically about their base.  She only calmed when Steve spared a moment to touch her shoulder once she was out of the armor.
Steve looked around for some sort of peace offering - Tony tended to be mollified by food, which was why Steve chose a restaurant for the meeting, and Steve was willing to spare a few of his fries as an olive branch - but saw something better.
"Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events."
Tony knocked off the now black device and looked around.  "Did it work?" he asked frantically, until his eyes landed on Steve.
He turned to face Steve, at a loss for what to say.  There was a tightness in his chest that loosened at the sight of Steve that Tony couldn't explain.  Steve looked at him with a lopsided smile, just out of a shower if his damp hair were any indication.  He looked...
"Tony, they used me to try to get information out of you in the dream," Steve said, anguish in his voice.  "And they used your feelings for me to keep you from realizing what was going on.  That was..."
"No," Tony said, and Steve could see the fear behind his eyes at the mention of sleep.  "I need to find that bastard.  I need to fix this."
The hydra clawed out of the ground, pulling itself up.  Jacques and Gabe tried to attack its claws to push it back down, but they only barely escaped the onslaught of five heads that tried to bite them.
He didn't have to say the rest.  Steve shook himself and opened his eyes, steeling his nerve for the words he had to say.  "Go.  Be careful.  And find out what's going on."
"Still not impressed.  Not efficient.  And I know a thing or two about cocoons.  You aren't half as special as you think you are."  Tony was walking along the smaller hedges, looking at the flowers.  In the dying sunlight, Tony looked warm and open despite the mock scowl on his face.  His smile seemed softer, and it looked like there was dirt on his hands and knees.  This was a new side of Tony he hadn't seen, and Steve was willing to watch a little while longer.
There was a heavy weight on his chest that would normally terrify him.  He hated any weight on the heart pump, but he felt safe right now despite it.  Protected.  It was a curious feeling, and if Tony was going to be painfully honest, curiosity was usually his undoing.
"On it," Natasha said, her voice clear and distinct in his ear piece.  Steve loved technology.  "Okay, I've cleared out some of your way to the western wall with a computer blip.  Not big enough to have extra security, but enough to get rid of some of your-"
The green dragon he saw in the cave wasn't just lying on the ground.  Tony watched as - Green, orange, white.  Sunlight on an open plain.  Dew drops in the morning and song.  Natural rhythm and a blooming daffodil - was wounded by a human she had been trying to save from a vicious pitch black wolf.  She tried to make it back to her mountain, to her brother, but the wound was too great.  She fell to the ground, barely managing to lift her head to look at the sky she could never return to.  She was going to die like this.  She couldn't-
"  Steve's voice was dull and empty as he said it, none of the self-righteous anger from earlier present.  "
Tony only had a moment when something caught his eye coming from the sky.  Instinct took over, and he rolled to the ground even before he figured out the danger.  Something that wasn't quite metal clanged against the stone he’d just been standing on.  Ignoring the pain in his ankle, Tony forced himself to run without babying it.  He drew one of his guns, pivoting as he fired.
"He's going to be okay," Tony said, as if repeating it to reassure himself.  "He's - shit!"  He tried to scramble to his feet, but his legs were still wobbly.
"Shh," Steve said, hugging Tony tighter.  Tony was tensing up again, and Steve resumed petting Tony's hair.  It was softer than he expected, and despite the slight dampness because of sweat, Steve enjoyed the motion and found it soothing for himself as well.  He wondered how Tony would take to having his hair ruffled.  "It's not your fault."
Steve did not remember Pepper getting repulsor high heels.  He felt like he should remember that, because it sounded dangerous.  But as long as Pepper was happy, he supposed it was well enough to leave alone.  He wondered if Natasha would like a pair too.
It was a long moment of silence as Steve waited for an answer.  His palms were getting sweaty, but he had a plate in one hand and a hot dog in the other so he couldn't exactly wipe them off.
"They can be a bit 'breathe fire first, ask questions later,' I'll admit," Tony said, though after the past few cases, he honestly didn't blame them.  "But if I vouch for you, they'll probably go easy on you."
"It's not," Iron Man said miserably.  But his arms tightened around Steve's back.  This close, Steve felt a pang of what he could have had.
Tony felt the ring slip onto his finger and the broken part of him mended.  He laughed, more than a little hysterical.  "The kids-"
Tony sighed and shut the hood of the Audi.  He could play with his babies later.  He pat You on the head as he walked by, refilling his coffee before sitting down at the lab computer.  "Let him in, J," he said, sipping at the hot drink.  He couldn't avoid this forever.
"Me, Pepper, and Happy," Rhodey said, not commenting if any of Steve's bitterness came through.  "We all knew before it was a secret.  I don't think Tony ever wanted it to be one, to be honest.  It was pretty much up for anyone who walked into the workshop to see."
Susan would just have to be strong until Kes could be again.  If it were anyone else, Susan didn't know if she could manage, but for Kestrel, Susan would try her hardest.  "You should take the armor," Susan said.  "You're the one-"
"Iron Man?" Steve woke up instantly, eyes going wide as he took in the familiar sight of red and gold.
Steve soaked that in, taking her words at face value and resisting the urge to deny it.  They felt true, even if he hadn't wanted to see it.
Things got a little fuzzy after that, but he did force his eyes open again when he felt Steve shake him.  "Steve?"
envy the shrink that has to deal with your sulking," Sam said with a laugh and a fake shudder. "I just set people up with the things they need to get better. I'll leave the psychoanalyzing to the professionals."
it was just files, but one could never be too sure with Fury.  What was it the robots wanted?  Why attack some place so remote?
Tony went still at the name.  Fury had mentioned a new leader rising through Hydra's ranks.  "I take it the dragons didn't give you that scar," he said, anger rising in him like a high tide.  Guilt and foolishness followed after the anger, because he never should have doubted the dragons.  He'd known Steve would never do such a thing, yet he'd still...
"Since when do you list something on my schedule as a 'business meeting'?" Stark said as Steve looked around for a place to hide it.  He opened the drawers only to find them full of those cookies.  "You haven't even told me who I'm meeting with.  If I didn't know you better, I'd call foul."
That meant he really wasn't looking forward to the high probability of this meeting crashing and burning.  Steve rubbed his palm against his pant leg, praying that the sweat wasn't leaving a noticeable mark.  He also prayed to keep his own temper, because Lord knows he would probably need it.
He'd been about to take her wrist to keep her from attempting again when Happy was suddenly beside him, looking very official with his security badge.  "That won't be necessary, Captain Rogers.  I'll make sure Mrs. Fairfax gets home safely."
Setting the picture aside, Steve looked through the blog Wanda had sent him.  Then he picked up his tablet and started to draw.
.  His eyes were bruised and there were myriads of cuts and tears in what must have once been a good suit.  His arm was in a sling and he looked like he hadn't slept in a week.
Tony almost didn't hear her.  There were pictures and newspaper clippings in there of a human in a military uniform.  Handsome with the kind of chin that could proclaim democracy to communists just by existing.  Definitely someone Tony wouldn't mind spending the night with, but no one Tony could remember seeing before.  There were even a few drawings of some of his Marvels adventures thrown in, though he didn't know what they had to do with anything.  They were signed S.R.
"You're the one who belongs in this century, not me," Steve said, hating how his voice broke at that.  "It's up to you."
"Yeah," Susan said, looking over at the gunmetal grey armor that was piloted by Kes, who gave her a cheeky salute.  They both had the helmets off, though that could change within seconds should a fight start.  "It's just last time..."
"Ah, Captain," Thor said, standing and clapping Steve on the back.  "Come.  Join us in our adventures in Midgardian dance."
"I've only remembered I was a dragon for a week.  You're the one without the memories.  The magic made me a human a lot longer than one week, Tony.  And I've been attracted to you since before that, even if you don't remember our first meeting in this world."
"He's done so much for us," Steve said.  The couch was small, so he was shoulder to shoulder with both Thor and Clint, which was more comfortable than it should have been.  It was nice to be with his team.  "And we've been gossiping about him, assuming the worst.  I feel like I should at least try to meet with him and thank him for what he's done."
.  Steve's wings were twitching in agitation, but aside from protectively surrounding Tony, they didn't try to touch him again.  Steve was...  Steve was trying to respect his privacy, even when he didn't quite understand the concept.
He would be angry, but he probably deserved that one too.  He would not give her the satisfaction of yelling though.  Or, at least, he tried not to yelp.
"You're full of shit, Rogers.  I hope you know that," Fury said, but he was smiling.  Steve knew for a fact that Fury loved the Avengers' brand of bullshit, even when it drove him mad.  "But you happen to be right about that.  None of that shipping business though.  I know Romanov has sent you something, so do us both a favor and delete it."
"Yeah, sorry.  I think the fact they discuss the gossip columns over breakfast and come to the conclusion it had to be true says otherwise," Stark shot back.
"If you need to change to the Hulk to protect them, we'll be here as quickly as possible," Steve assured him.
"Yeah, no.  Not impressive.  I can hit mach three in the suit and you're what, not even doing a mile per hour right now?"
He heard the other man sigh.  "Have you tried the Avengers?  You could talk to them as yourself, instead of-"
He rode Sharon this time to go to the meadow by the gate, watching Peggy glide gracefully in front of them.  It was still a thrill flying on a dragon, but Tony found it wasn't the same without Steve.  Maybe Sharon was going a little slower, or Tony had gotten used to the little tricks Steve pulled to show off once Tony found some rope to keep himself in place.  Maybe that's what he was missing.
It was a simple mission.  According to Tony's reconnaissance, the Skrulls were trying to keep the transfer under-wraps so there were only a handful of soldiers assigned to the train.  There were two big artillery guns that Susan could take out with a well-placed missile if she could get close enough, and one she had to take out manually since it was too close to the prisoners.  With those out of the way, she could get the prisoners with the special harness she and Tony had rigged up that could accommodate two potentially injured twins (God, please no).  Then she could get out and fly at a safe speed for her passengers while Tony and Cap ran interference on the computer end of things.
Five minutes later, he was fired.  "Seriously, Steve?  Those are so clunky they could sink the Titanic."
Happy smiled knowingly before giving him a sloppy salute.  Steve was not ashamed of his strategic retreat.  There were only so many high society women (and a few men) he could take in one hour, and he'd reached that limit when Mrs. Fairfax had groped him.
Half an hour later he climbed onto Steve's neck, feeling his stomach drop away as Steve launched them into the sky.  Without the rope Steve usually brought there was no way to perform some of the trick moves the dragons liked to show off with (and Tony privately loved the adrenaline rush).  But Steve felt just as tired as Tony was, making Tony wonder at just what sort of disturbance had happened in the north plains.
Steve waited for the sounds of the elevator closing behind them before he sat up.  He chewed on the end of the eraser as he mulled over the words.  He needed to put a stop to Clint's prodding, that was for certain.  Maybe talk to Iron Man about telling them when they were crossing the line.
Two minutes later, the sound stopped.  Tony looked down again, not seeing the gargoyle army.  There were a few flapping about, but they didn't come closer.  Tony landed on a near by ledge, giving a passing glance at the stairs that branched out from either side.  "I've got a bad feeling about this," Tony said.
And that really explained a lot, if Tony had been bothered to think.  "You had a nightmare this morning," he said.
Steve felt like he was intruding.  With Doom gone, at least he could pick up Rhodey's cane.  He moved quietly around the bed, ignoring the soft reassurances drifting over from the two of them.  If Tony had been carrying all of that on his shoulders for so long, he probably needed the comfort.
They could all 'speak' English because it was mind to mind, rather than with words - apparently last time they had been 'speaking' in German, but Peggy liked English names better.  Dragons lived for around a thousand years, and Sharon was matured, but still very young in dragon terms.  Dragons lived in clans that occasionally visited, sometimes fought, but mostly left each other alone due to distances and travel dangers.  There were ancient legends about the sky and traveling underground due to the dangers of humans, and Tony wondered if there weren't some truth to the old stories of dragons that he had grown up with.  They never ended well for the dragons.
He started to hand the mug to Tony before remembering Pepper's list.  He set it down on the counter next to him instead, then went back to heat up the muffins.  The quiet went on for too long, and Steve thought about Iron Man taking his coffee, sipping it through a straw in the morning with a small catch in the face plate that opened just enough to fit.  He wondered if Iron Man had asked for it, or if Tony had made it without prompting.  It was a little ridiculous either way, and Steve fought back a smile at the thought.  This wasn't helping with either of his crushes.
Steve looked away, toweling off the sweat as he tried not to think about Iron Man.  He caught Natasha's frown as he looked down and groaned inwardly.  She was prone to getting far too involved in his personal affairs, and no one needed to know he was failing at adapting to the new world he'd woken up in that much.  Maybe he should just admit Iron Man turned him down.  She might find out in a much more embarrassing manner otherwise.
A cup of water was pushed into his hands and Steve spat out his first mouthful into the sink.  Then he gulped down the water carefully, finding himself a little grateful for Stark's hovering.  It was fair turnabout, he supposed, given how often he'd done the same for Stark.
"We just watched my best friend kill himself to spare the world, and that's all you can say?  And you were just going to let him-" Rhodey said, pivoting around and walking towards Doom.  Steve barely managed to keep him from falling over with his cane forgotten and his legs still not able to hold him.
Tony shook his head, ducking under Steve's wing as he flew back down to the ground.  "I've run away from my responsibilities enough in my life."
"All the time, Cap," FRIDAY said. "It's very popular, but I can put on a clean search if you want. There's a lot of apps for that too as long as it's tagged."
observing their torture was talking on screen.  He didn't have a plan, not for that.  He couldn't...
Now came the hard part.  Pepper had coached him on the cover story before she left, and the story was sound.  He reminded himself of that as he started to recount it.  "Kang - the time traveler - he uh, kidnapped Tony as a way to make me comply.  He's been dividing up the Avengers to get me alone, but Tony used Kang's technology against him."
.  I made the decision," Steve said with an air of finality.  He held out the ring for Tony to take.  "I'm still me in all the ways that matter."
Tony finally decided on rubbing Steve's cheek as the safest approach to avoid getting flamed.  He started to rub, then poked the dragon a few times.
.  I haven't made weapons in over a year.  I practically privatized world peace.  I make efficient, renewable green energy at half the cost of fossil fuels.  And they still call me the Merchant of Death in the papers.  You think telling everyone would change that?  They already know enough.  They just don't care."
it had been to lie to Steve.  The dragon didn't even seem to have second thoughts about Tony's admittedly flimsy story.  Tony pushed aside the guilt because it really wasn't his secret to give away.  It was just a little white lie.  A lone priestess in the wood wasn't a danger to the dragons.
"Not sleepin' tonight," Steve said, mentally planning ways to increase alcohol tolerance before he ever went near Tony's stash again.  And without getting
Steve knew yelling after him wouldn't help as Iron Man probably blocked all of them.  He also knew bashing his shield into the near by car wouldn't help.  Both were tempting.
"Looks like there's some kind of sedative in both of them, and they're not Skrulls according to these readings," Tony said, his voice urgent in her ear.  "This is what we put together the harness for.  We made it just in case something like this happened, remember?"
That was the last thing he needed.  "I'll pass, thanks," he said.  He wasn't sure what he wanted, but having his hand forced was not it.
The hall opened up to a dark cavern.  The moss lantern only lit up a small portion of the room, which Tony could see included a sharp ledge.  The thermographic readings were telling him nothing, and he couldn't tell if it was magic or the stone that was sending it on the fritz.
For a long time, Tony didn't get a response.  There was mounting anger from Steve though, and Tony wondered what he'd done this time.
Susan woke up, instantly alert.  It had been a hard habit to learn, but one that she mastered before she'd found Steve and Tony.  This time, however, she relaxed, hearing Kes's soft breathing nearby.  The twins were safe.  Susan had saved them, a fact which still hadn't really sunk in, even three days later.
"We're both fine," Natasha said.  "Being cooped up that long wasn't a picnic for either of us, but Doom explained some of what was going on when he let us go."
"Long night?" she asked dryly, a smile not quite making it to her face, though he could see it tugging about her lips.  "Please sit.  I know how Tony gets when he's gone on a bender and you look like you've had better days."
"To hack into Kang's high tech chair, just look in some of the notes I've left you.  It's easy when you remember his tech is based off of ours, and Port 290926 is your friend.  That will get you into his spaceship, Damocles, and JARVIS and Doom can do the rest from there.  Tony One spent a long time studying his tech before he could make the time line right, so look at his notes especially."
There were at least twenty robots left, but they went down surprisingly easy.  Steve was starting to get a bad feeling about all of this.  He decapitated the last robot with his shield, then waited, holding ready until the parts disappeared like normal.
Steve did not want to know how everyone else managed to keep a closer eye on his online presence than he did.  He bit into his waffle to give himself time to think.
Steve's head shot up to see a young woman, mid-twenties.  Stark was up, accepting a hug from her with a warm smile that Steve had never seen in any of the pictures in Stark's file.
"The only ones you're like this with are Bucky and Peggy, and you don't look at Bucky the way you look at Tony," she said.  "You brighten up considerably when Tony makes it to an Avengers meeting, and I know the others think you're completely gone on him.  The art you draw of him feels almost like he's alive on the paper, more so than for any of the rest of us."
Steve's grin fell as his hand went to his hair, and he mock-glared at Tony to cover his embarrassment.  "I'll text everyone to meet in the common rooms in an hour," Steve said, returning to his half-eaten breakfast.  It was cool now, but Steve didn't mind.
Steve debated pushing it, but then let it slide.  It really didn't feel like jealousy.  He considered it as he put his notebook away and followed Iron Man back to his room, only half listening to the list of modifications and upgrades Iron Man was talking about.
Didn't matter.  He needed to get her out of the dark cavern and into the moss light where he could actually see her ankle properly.  "Hold on," he repeated, lifting off as gently as he could.
"You have to let me up first," Tony said.  He received a draconic glare in return.  "Okay, then.  There's a latch just under the helmet.  Reach under with your claw until you find it and for God's sake, be careful."
"You really won't make this easy on me," Steve said with a small chuckle.  "Moved on to you, you punk.  I'm ready to give this a try, and you seemed to be carrying a torch still.  Was I wrong?"
"It's an apology of sorts, for the way he was acting," Iron Man explained.  "He gets like that sometimes, and he tries not to be near people when it happens.  But, well..."
"This is relaxing for me.  Is it relaxing for you?" Steve asked cheekily, glad his friendship with Natasha held the same sort of ease as his camaraderie with the Howling Commandos.  Being with her like this did help relax him.
"Is there a problem with Stark?" Steve asked, settling into his normal chair.  It was strange, not having the others around him.  Iron Man's seat to his left felt particularly empty.  He still had to apologize for how he'd acted...
"I thought I'd never find you!  I'm sorry it took so long.  I'm so sorry..." Susan said, hugging Kestrel tightly and hiding her face in the other girl's shoulder.
Steve understood that well enough, even if he didn't agree with Iron Man's lone wolf routine.  "We'd still like to help.  Are you close to the Colonel?"
Steve was interrupted by a loud rumbling noise.  It took him a moment to realize it was his stomach.  He flushed as Tony narrowed his eyes at him.
Steve's hand around Tony's wrist tightened for a fraction of a second before he remembered his strength. Tony didn't protest again after that, silently allowing Steve to clean and dress the cut.
At first he thought it was a video of their fight earlier.  The robots were the same, but the scenery was different.  That was the middle of the desert, not a highway in New York.  Then he realized the man's voice in the armor wasn't Iron Man, but it was familiar.  "Colonel Rhodes," Steve said, the realization dawning on him.  That was the same voice he'd heard arguing with Tony the day he'd been trying to draw.
"Not without you," Tony said, feeling small and helpless in the small circle of light the crystal gave off.  He balled his fists and fought back the urge to scream.
"Partial..."  Tony dropped to the floor, Steve barely moving fast enough to catch him.  He hissed as the movement jostled the glass in his fist, but he held on.  "Tony?  What's wrong?" he asked in alarm.
Steve swallowed, moving to the chair the nurse pointed him towards and sitting down.  He didn't take Tony's hand, though he studied the nicks and calluses on his fingers, because that was better than staring at Tony's unmoving chest.  Frozen in time, the doctors said.  Not dead, but unable to keep moving forward and living.  A bit like Snow White or Sleeping Beauty, but Steve doubted a kiss would wake Tony up.  He didn't dare try.
"How did the interrogation go?" he asked, sighing internally because she was warm and curled up against his side.
"Sure thing," Tony promised, stumbling over the words.  "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing after all.  Or so I'm reliably told."
"You think he'd have trusted you if you'd known?" Fury asked.  Steve looked away.  "You ain't subtle, Cap.  The fact that Iron Man turned you down was pretty well known even to the Stark Industries cleaning staff."
"Stay until he comes around," Steve pleaded, knowing how Tony could get when his temper got the better of him.  "We can take this slow, remember?  We'll make sure it doesn't happen again, but the kids need both of us right now."
"Whatever you're thinking right now, you will regret," Tony told him gleefully.  "Though, I don't know.  Pep, who do you think would win arguing about the constitution, Captain America or Roberta?"
Sharon giggled, a sound like soft chimes.  Peggy just lightly cuffed him on the shoulder with her wing tip as a reminder to behave.
"From what I hear he's only been snacking on fruit," Steve said, not rising to the bait, but only just.
"You'll see soon enough," Viper said.  She walked over to the wall and stood in the same place as the hidden buttons in the metal room.  Instead of the altar clicking and becoming movable,the wall parted, showing a wide hall way.  She beckoned, and Tony felt the skull beginning to move, walking with the tentacles that weren't holding him down.  It also tightened around his gauntlet so he couldn't twist it.
"And the other dragon you met is Sam," Peggy said with an air of finality as she led him down the stairs.
Steve ignored them, his grip on the armor tightening until it crushed the metal.  He could hear Iron Man yelp in pain, metal cutting into the skin underneath.  He felt a sick satisfaction in the sound, throwing a punch to see if he could break Iron Man's nose through the face plate and-
He could feel Tony's breath start to pick up, a minute trembling going through Tony's body.  Boundaries, Steve realized with a start as he opened his mouth to speak.  He snapped it shut, because pushing right now wouldn't help no matter how much he knew it wouldn't get better until Tony tried.  Tony had to take this at his own pace.  He was going to have to ask Rhodey how he managed to pull back.  Steve definitely could use some advice on the matter.
Getting on the plane was easy, thankfully.  Natasha promised to come back for his bike and once he'd snuck on, it was just a long wait for the ride to end.  Getting out, on the other hand, was more difficult.
As quickly as he could, Tony ran his fingers over the inner edge of the suit.  He found the catch and various items came tumbling out.  He searched until he found  a long cylinder.  "And let there be light," he said, his voice rough as he turned on the flashlight.
The latter came out more bitter than Steve intended and Tony looked away.  Steve sighed, admonishing himself silently and forced his voice to gentle.  "You've been through a lot recently, and I think I need to work on backing off more to keep this from exploding like it did.  But regardless, I shouldn't have lost my temper at you like that."
"It's what Cap tells you," Susan said, her heart not quite in the banter but the words reassuring Steve all the same.  She was still fighting.  That was what mattered.
"I don't think the upper parts of the tower have anything in them," Steve replied.  "It's just a bunch of small rooms with stairs, and all this metal is giving me a headache."
"Have you heard of confidentiality, Cap?" Fury said by way of greeting.  "Because I'm starting to think you don't know the meaning of the word."
He lay on his bed, breathing heavily as he tried not to think about how he was going to have to get up and change his sheets.  He was no stranger to that particular kind of dream, but this one had been more intense than usual.
The tentacles' grip loosened.  Tony yanked free, stumbling forward as he clamped on to the flame thrower and fired at the tentacles.  The thing shrieked, tentacles pulling away from the flames, and Tony could smell the burnt flesh through the suit's air filters.  He held his hand up to fire the repulsors at the skull itself.
"Making our own or having Hollywood make it would be a whole new can of worms," Tony said.  "One we're not opening because my lawyers would kill me.  If we let anyone use our names, we'd have to be on them like a hawk to make sure they don't put out another Elektra movie and claim they tried their best, and none of us have the time for that while we're supposed to be saving the world.  Same goes for making our own."
"The last human to come through was also like you - guarded.  You'll have to forgive-" dragon name, the blue one "-for his rashness.  He lost a mentor and a dear friend because of that human."
"Fine and dandy," Tony said, a small frown on his face as he looked over the data Steve had open.  At least, he hoped it was that and not-
He triangulated the sound of the voice and aimed automatically, but he didn't see anyone.  His fingers tightened around the gun.  "Who's there?"
Steve decided he'd do two drawings, one serious like Fury had asked for, and one of Lila as Black Widowbird next to Agent Furry.  After all, he did take the man for fifty, and friends and family got discounts if they were going to insist on paying.
"Rhodes is pissed, by the way," Clint said as Bruce gave Tony some juice.  Tony's hands still shook, but he managed not to spill any.
"I live deep in the forest," the woman said.  "I hide from them because they are monsters, no better than the rest that live here!  But I saw you come in and tame them.  I waited until they were gone to try to speak with you."
Tony shook his head.  He would definitely rather Steve be someone else right now, but his injuries weren't that bad.  Not enough to call in Rhodey or Pepper and drag them away from their sleep, no matter how much a hug from one of them would be nice.
There were no robots, pieces or otherwise, but they were able to clean up for the construction crew and no one died today, so Steve was counting it as a tentative win.
He laughed again, high and bitter with a touch of hysteria.  "And even now I'm terrified of doing it.  What kind of coward does that make me, huh?  I never was much of a hero.  All I wanted to do was fix my mistakes, but I just fuck things up more."
He couldn't focus on Steve to make sure the dragon was alright, not with Viper there.  He had to break free some how.  He yanked again on his arms, twisting his palm.  It wasn't quite enough to get a good shot.  "Where's the hydra?" he demanded to distract Viper and buy himself more time.
That didn't sound ominous at all.  Still, the ancient prophecy was working in Tony's favor for once.  That almost never happened.  It was nice to have it saving him, rather than condemning him to death.  Heard one, heard them all...
"We can't save everyone," Tony said.  "Not even me and Cap. Even some of the best people I've known made mistakes.  We just have to keep going."
"Magic..."  Tony didn't know if he should scoff or be amazed.  'Magic,' in his experience, tended to be science that idiots didn't understand.  But he was currently under the earth and talking to telepathic dragons, so he wasn't discounting anything right now no matter how skeptical it made him.  He did want a closer look at those stones and the moss though.  That was on his to-do list.  That, and getting back to the others, because the long War was still on-going, and they needed to keep Hydra from finding this place.
could frame Doom?  Because honestly, these guys are actually harder to down than normal, so if someone is improving Doom's bots, that's bad."
Steve looked a little wary when he accepted his own coffee, and Rhodey pat him on the back.  "Take care of him," was all Rhodey said, earning him a raised eyebrow from Steve.
"I think it was more to protect Stark from SHIELD than the other way around," Fury said, watching Steve carefully.  "He felt that with his original failing, SHIELD would only make the matter worse.  With what I know now, I agree with him.  Didn't always, which is why I sent Natasha in to get around Coulson, but her cover was blown too soon due to another agent's bad call."
Tony closed his eyes and took a deep breath.  This wasn't a dream.  Or if it was, it was a nice one.
"Shouldn't I wear a suit?" Steve asked, eying himself in the mirror as a very uncomfortable-looking Steve Rogers stared back.
"The robots have started attacking again in Virginia," JARVIS replied.  "They are fighting very close to Dr. Ross's lab."
"Ms. Potts was pretty upset," Steve said, putting his head back down on the table to hide a different sort of blush at being caught staring.
Sharon's wing pulled back so that he could see Sam on his back with Steve lying triumphantly on his stomach.  Both of their nostrils were flared in the dragon smile, and now Tony could read a playfulness to their posture that the aerial flight hadn't allowed.
"Guess so," Steve replied, and Tony could feel Steve smile as he pressed a kiss to Tony's neck.  "Guess both of us have terrible timing in the end."
Steve still didn't let go.  Tony could feel the anxiety Steve was giving off.  The cave in the vision had been
That made a bit more sense, he supposed.  "It didn't seem right, how everyone was gossiping about him when he puts us up like he does," Steve answered, determined to keep the eavesdropping secret this time.  He didn't think Iron Man would take that particularly well either, since Tony Stark tended to be a sore spot he protected in his own strange way.
Steve squeezed his shoulder once more and left it at that, returning the tray to the kitchen.  He passed Natasha on his way, then called out to her on second thought.  "Do we have any precautions for working with super villains?" he asked.
"I can go, if that's what you want," Steve said, not looking at him.  There was an unspoken 'but I'd like to stay' that baffled Tony.  Was it the fact Steve had sent him in and now felt guilty?  Or that he knew Tony hated being alone in hospitals and he was just being a responsible team leader?  Either way, Tony didn't want it.
"Oh, come on, Cap," Carol said.  "They do it all the time to sell comics.  Just last week they gave 'Antonio' a silver armor and turned him evil in the Steel Man comics."
All thought shut down as Steve pulled him forward for a kiss.  Steve's lips were soft against Tony's chapped ones, pressing firmly and demanding attention.  And Tony gave it to him, because even if Steve
"Steve," he said, his voice sounding weak and trembling.  Red, white, and blue.  Art and stars that the dragons only knew from myths and legends.  The feeling of calm after the rain and the stubborn of a rock that refused to move.
Steve stopped hanging in the doorway, moving towards the chair Pepper set aside for visits.  There were two of them, both red and very comfortable.  Steve had fallen asleep in the one further from Tony last night, and that was the one he moved towards now, not sure of his welcome with the man who had both turned him down and kissed him good-bye.
"And I know you've already figured all of that out," Natasha said with a sigh.  "So I don't know why you're asking me."
He felt a mental shrug from the bastard who was looking more and more pathetic.  Tony started to really worry before he realized Steve was playing it up.  "I hope you know what you're doing," Tony muttered before turning back to Viper.  "Well?"
Tony honestly didn't know if that made it better or worse.  He closed his eyes and leaned into Rhodey's hand on his shoulder, all too aware that it wasn't Steve's tail around his feet or waist.  He breathed deeply, ignoring the hitch as he tried not to think of how he missed a certain shade of blue.
"No changes," she replied, tucking her straightened hair behind her ear again.  "But that means he hasn't gotten any worse, so there's that."
Cap led her out, and she took hold of his hand before she could think better of it.  Cap smiled reassuringly and squeezed her hand.  "Come on, kid," he said softly.  "Let's give him some space."
Now he got a sense of skeptical amusement from Steve, but the dragon did as told, launching himself with one leap.  Tony reminded himself that he needed to get the armor back on if he wanted to impress anyone, and admiring the power of Steve's body wouldn't help him do that.
"We'll get you trained," Tony said soothingly.  "I promise, Pep.  You're the only one I can ask.  You can do this, buttercup."
"Alright," Tony said, looking away.  "But are you gonna go down like that?  Because that's some impressive bed head you're sporting."
Iron Man beat the statistics once again.  Tony closed his eyes, trying to focus on his extremities.  "My feet itch."
sigh after his long lost best friend?  Though, sorry to hear about that, by the way.  I can put out feelers again if you want?"
"No.  At least, not that I'm aware of.  It's strange," Peggy said.  "You are... angry at someone else's love or happiness?"
"I'd like that," Steve said.  He nearly added 'as long as we can also go to dinner', but decided he wasn't quite up to that yet.
Steve pressed his lips into a firm line as he got his temper under control.  Hindsight, his mind supplied.  It didn't mean Rhodey or the others could have seen it before and done something.  Getting angry at them now when they'd all been betrayed by someone they trusted wouldn't help.  Neither would being angry at a dead man who sounded like he was emotionally abusive at the very
All thoughts of how ridiculous both Natasha and Tony were being about his cutting skills were lost when she looked up at him with narrowed eyes.  "How long?" she asked, not bothering with any interrogation techniques.
Sam laughed, the bastard. "That's a thing people have always done. Don't play that innocent kid from the 40s, Cap. It ain't gonna work on me anymore."
"Nonsense," she said, batting her eyes as she stepped closer again.  "He only cares when I spend his money, and he's in Vienna for a week.  I could show you a wild ride."
"Good.  That's great.  Sleep sucks.  I hear it's good for you, but it just really sucks.  Are you okay?"
"That was-" Tony said, starting to reach for the wall to brace himself before he remembered and pulled back.  If that was what he felt through Wanda, he didn't dare touch the wall itself regardless of how the vision might not work for him alone.  He rubbed his eyes, then his hand fell to cover the heart pump.  "What was that?"
He felt Natasha's hand on his back rubbing small circles as he leaned over on his knees and kept his head down.
Tony's clothes were mostly dry at least, which was a small miracle, but Steve was stripped down out of his clothes, probably down to an undershirt and potentially boxers going by the bareness of his arms and legs.  Again, not the time or place to be thinking about Steve half naked.  It was always the wrong place and the wrong time for Tony.  He could probably give John McClane a run for his money at this point.
.  "Did I do something wrong?" he asked, going through every little thing he'd done in the past three weeks.  Was this about the War Machine drawing he'd done?  Had he misremembered the armor?
"It's fine," Steve said, though now that he was listening, Tony could hear a new level of pain in Steve's voice.  Tony had struggled while he'd been in the panic attack and he'd...  "You didn't even jar it too much."  Steve's voice cut through the guilt, but it didn't lighten it.
Stark stopped in the doorway, staring at Steve with open shock on his face.  Steve smiled as innocently as he could and tried not to think of the broken sculpture.  He focused on Stark's attire, which wasn't the bespoke suit that Steve had been expecting.  He was in a ragged t-shirt with some strange design over a dark, long-sleeved shirt and a pair of ratty jeans.  His hair was either artfully trussed or actual bed head.  Steve wasn't well versed enough in modern hairstyles to really tell, but given what looked like grease marks all over his jeans and shirt, Steve was willing to bet the latter.  There was a black mark across his forehead that Steve assumed came from running a hand through his hair, and it was more endearing than Steve would have thought.
Tony shifted Viper up so that he could take a quick moment to wipe away the sweat out of his eyes.  It was dark under the canopy, but not too bad.  The moss light wasn't quite as good as the sun, but Viper held on to the moss lantern to light up what darkness persisted.  Still, Tony didn't want to be here at night.  Unfamiliar jungles and names of the meat he'd seen on the dragons' table were not something to laugh at.  He followed a river on Viper's direction, the deep, rushing waters making him wary of getting too close to it, but the sound of it soothing.
The second thunder strike only made Tony jump now that he was aware of it.  He hid his hands back in between him and Steve, trying to breathe naturally rather than in big, gasping breaths.
"Most do," Peggy answered.  "There are a few that don't, but most of the time families are very close.  But you can bond with others outside of your family too."
Steve tried to move back discreetly.  The plan was foiled when he let out a surprised grunt as she groped his ass.  He gave her a disapproving glare as he removed her hand, noting the ring on her finger as he stepped back again.  She had to be in her sixties, and Steve wondered how anyone thought he was a prude with her level of shamelessness going around.
He wondered what happened to sour their relationship that much.  It was a link to his past that he couldn't chase after, since the topic seemed too touchy.  "Why did Ms. Potts even schedule the meeting then?" he asked in frustration.  She had to know that too.
Steve grew thoughtful.  "I would like that," he said, detangling himself from Tony.  "Tell me about the stars?"
Tony stopped clawing at the hand around his neck.  The Red Skull wasn't even paying attention to him at this point, putting him as down for the count.  And Tony was down, more or less, but he used the last of his strength to twist the armor into the right position, facing the Red Skull head on.  "JARVIS," he gasped, "Fire Unibeam."
Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair.  "It feels like all I've been doing is taking breaks recently."
Something must have shown on his face.  Steve didn't like to think about what, considering that Tony wheeled around 180 degrees.  "Or you could stay and, I dunno.  Cut the chicken?  They should be three to five centimeters.  If I see any that are two or six centimeters, you're fired.  But you can stay."
"I'll meet you after breakfast," Tony said, making his way down.  There was really no reasoning with the blue dragon before then.
Steve flinched at the words, taking a step back and putting more weight on his bad leg.  By the way Bruce's concern grew, Steve had probably pulled off it too quickly.  "I'll be fine," he amended, though he didn't know if he was telling that to himself or to Bruce.
Before he could try, Tony was back, a device in his hand and a first aid kit tucked under his arm as he went straight for Leon.  "Nope.  No Skrulls here," Tony said.  "We ran that scan at least ten times.  Steve said all of them after five were a waste, but I'm a paranoid bastard."
It was a text post, not one written by anyone he'd talked to on the site before.  Curiosity got the better of him, and he started to read.
"I'm not leaving you!"  This time there was definitely anger in Steve's mental voice.  Tony flinched away from the rage and it was quickly replaced with the blue and white calm.
"Three minutes, Mr. Stark.  Come out while you can, and we won't use the electric shock this time when we put you under.  You can go back to your dreams, if you'll just give us the designs for the armor."
," Steve said, looking down at the tablet like he wanted a mindless game to distract himself with as well.  "Just... give me some time to adjust to that.  We can find a compromise that makes us both comfortable later.  Let me handle the first date, then you can plan the second one."
"Yeah, that?  That's not convincing at all, Pinocchio.  I told you, you're a terrible liar," Tony said, and Steve could hear him gulp over the sound of his own heart.  "Is it okay if I touch you?  You won't attack me or whatever because you're still high-strung, will you?"
"That doesn't even make any sense," Dr. Foster said, her eyes narrowing as she crossed her arms over her chest.  "And if you had just talked to me, I could have given you some theories on how to create a stabilizer so that it wouldn't kill you!"
Steve sighed, lowering them both to the floor slowly.  He reached up and grabbed the first aid kit, making sure Tony could at least sit up by himself before opening the kit and starting to pick the glass out of his fist with a pair of tweezers.  It wasn't easy with his non-dominant hand, but he was fairly ambidextrous after the serum anyway.
.  He didn't know how long it was before there was a hand running through his hair.  A human hand, not a metal one.
Steve hid his surprise and looked at the tree he'd picked out.  "Is the area unstable?" he asked.  He should have been informed of that.  And if that were the case, they needed to put up markings to warn people.
Viper nodded, but she kept the gun trained on Steve.  "Cobra," she said, and Tony was surprised to see the naga appear at her side.
"You heard the woman, J," Tony said, squeezing Steve's hand.  "Pizza and a movie.  You know what to order."
Tony let out a breath.  He still didn't know if the bond was good or bad, but at least it was Steve.
Steve leaned over and grabbed Tony's chin in his good hand.  Tony jerked in surprise, but didn't move away.  "What are you-" Tony started to say, but Steve had heard enough.  He leaned in to stop those lips from moving.
"And you thought this was a good idea?" Stark hissed softly enough that he probably thought Steve couldn't hear.
Before Tony could launch on a lecture on proper science, uplift, and aerodynamics of the suit, Sam interrupted.  "It needs more color," he said critically, poking at the armor with his claw.  "It's grey and dirty-looking."
A strange name, but he was used to strange names in his business.  The snake motif made a lot more sense, at least.  He looked at the trees and then back to the suit.  It wouldn't do any better in those trees than dragons would, and going by air would offer too little cover if Steve or one of the other dragons came back.  It was still early in the morning, though, so he could probably make it back in time by dinner if he walked it.  "Well then, Miss Viper, if you'd like to climb up on my back, we can get started."
He heard a couple of pops and cracks that had to be Steve stretching.  "Colonel Rhodes, would you mind if I spoke to Tony for a minute?" Steve asked after a short period of silence.
Tony realized he was also that sort of idiot as two heads replaced it.  The two heads split the dead neck off, not even giving him a chance to cauterize the neck.
He held up a small device that didn't look like much.  Steve felt like time had stopped for him as well just looking at it.  If what Doom was saying were true, this could save Tony!  His moment of shock having passed, he reached out for it, but Doom held it back.  "You-"
His hand felt naked without it, even though Tony knew it was just a piece of code rather than the real thing.  He never took it off, not even when he'd still been alive and in the suit.  Before he could second guess himself, he threw the ring at Steve, ignoring how the man flinched as he caught it.  "Let me know when my husband is back," he said, turning to go find Kestrel and find out for himself what was going on.
Finally Steve pulled away.  He knew his flush was on full display without his shirt, but he was pleased to see he wasn't the only one sporting a touch of red.
"No, I can't," Ms. Potts said, her voice rising.  "Do you know what you're asking me to do, Tony?  I've seen you come back from that!  I could be ki - Captain!"
Steve nodded, not trusting himself to speak.  He hated this.  Things were supposed to be better in this century.  The War was supposed to have ended, taking its hard choices and compromises with it.  Not like this.  And it was his fault to begin with, having suggested Doom.  He should have kept an eye on the deal or sent one of the others with Iron Man to make sure it was alright.
"Steve," Wanda said, her voice final.  Steve stopped what he was saying and looked away.  "You said it yourself.  The price must be paid.  There must be a sacrifice.  And you must take Tony back to the surface."
Steve looked, even if Tony wouldn't.  Jane and Bruce crowded him, almost shoving Steve aside.  "Tony!  You're..."  Bruce said, then shook his head.  "Of course you are."
Tony nodded numbly, forgetting to breathe for a moment when Steve smiled at him.  He was off kilter, but he didn't mind the new direction.
Steve's shoulders slumped.  This was far more exhausting than it should be.  He hadn't even been to the gym yet today, and he felt like he hadn't slept in years.  They had to find a way to stop this cycle they got into before one of them snapped and this became something they both regretted.  Running this through his head so much would only run him to the ground.
"Can change," Steve finished, looking Stark straight in the eye.  "It's hard, but I believe in that change."
Steve didn't wince, but it was a near thing.  He also refused to say that this was different because he shouldn't have distracted Tony.  Sometimes, he really wished Tony weren't so damn selectively perceptive.  He chose to notice things at the worst times.
Tony looked up to see the brown dragon from yesterday, Sam.  He was holding a wooden basket that reminded Tony of the murals outside the gate, finely crafted with a myriad of colors.  He hadn't been at dinner last night, so Tony assumed he must have been somewhere off with Steve.
"The robots we fought this morning were the same ones that attacked him," Steve said, fully grasping why Tony had worked himself up this much.
He could feel Steve's fear of the metal surrounding him and the gripping sense of helplessness.  The pain was nearly blinding despite the fact they hadn't started with the metal weapons yet, but Steve was trying to push it back for Tony's sake.
The latter she directed to Steve, who felt even guiltier after that.  He only just managed to keep on the smile as she left the room, sagging into a chair once she'd left.  He leaned forward on the table on his arms and groaned, knowing he'd been made.
Steve frowned, wishing there was something he could do if Tony was still that upset.  "Tell him thank you for me."
"I..." Iron Man said, trailing off.  "Trying to track those robots, mostly.  I should be getting back to-"
Steve really hated logic.  That didn't mean he'd admit Fury was right though.  His mouth was set in a fine line, watching Tony's motionless body under the black light of the reactor.  It was unnerving, since he couldn't even reassure himself with Tony's chest moving up and down or listen to the steady beep of a heart monitor.
Tony turned back over to face Jarvis, seeing the honesty in his eyes.  Tony swallowed hard and blinked a few times.  It wasn't complete acceptance, but it was a step up from the last time they'd had this conversation and that meant a lot.  Maybe one day...  "Jarvis, I..."
"I don't have time for this," Iron Man muttered.  "Rhodey is-"  Iron Man stopped, putting his hands flat like he was about to take off.  "JARVIS, I need you to-"
He pushed himself to roll over, his labored breathing at least not wheezing.  The small crystal fell from his pocket, spilling light into the small pit and reflecting against the other crystals.  He had only fallen maybe eleven feet, but his leg ached and his arm was too mangled to try even if he could break the rope binding his hands.  The cold seeped into his bones like a slow glacier as he curled up on his side, trying to find a position that both conserved heat and hurt the least.
He pressed down on the wall where it looked like an indentation.  Nothing happened.  He looked around again to make sure, but everything appeared to be the same.
"You don't have to-" Leon said, not quite able to bring himself to say 'massage'.  A massage by Captain America.
"That and when I asked Iron Man about it, he just shrugged.  There was always something strange between him and Coulson.  Not animosity, but it was hard to put a finger on," Bruce replied.
Bruce was also frowning at him, but he slid a plateful of waffles at Steve, so he was forgiven.  "If you've been running that long, you need to eat something before you do anything else.  You're burning too many calories."
Steve almost drops the barbell on his chest. The weights tip to one side and Tony dodges out of the way while Thor, his spotter, grabs the barbell from him and carefully sets it on the rack. Steve sits up, a little out of breath. "What?"
Steve smiles, finding that his gaze drifts over to watching Tony rather than the numbers and odd looking symbols on the page. There’s a small crease between his eyebrows, slightly furrowed in his concentration, the tip of his tongue occasionally peeking out of the corner of his mouth. He watches Tony’s hands, the slender digits, slight callouses along the pads of his fingers, faded scars and pockmarks on his tanned hands. It’s interesting how he’s watched Tony’s hands throw hundreds of pitches, but he just now knows the true range of their capabilities after feeling them touch him all over.
Tony shrugs. “Not everyone is going to be accepting I’m sure, but it helps that the owners of the main boating club here are partners who have been together since before I was born,” he chuckles. “Lukas and Marty. Nicest guys in the world. I’m pretty sure even the most intolerant dickheads would succumb to their charms.”
“Then go upstairs! Check the dresser! Stark— Tony? Tony, listen to me, you need to tell me where your inhaler is— Hey, Tony, come on I need you to breathe. Potts told me about this, but I need you to tell me where—”
Tony smirks over at him, his hood pulled back up onto his head. “Aw, you worried about me, Rogers? I can take care of myself, y’know.”
"Thank you, sir. I think I'll just see what Tony wants to do," Steve says politely, not missing the way Howard's expression darkens at the mention of his own son's name.
“Were you? Or are you mistaking genuine worry for guilt that you feel the same way about me as the scumbags who thought they could beat the gay out of me?”
At least once or twice a week during the season, he and Tony have gotten in the habit of grabbing breakfast or dinner just the two of them, or meeting up in the city for whatever reason they can come up with that would be improved by some company. A lot of the time, it’s Steve tagging along with Tony when he decides to go shopping for clothes, hardware materials, or art for his apartment. Steve introduced him to one of his favorite flea markets, and any time they’re lucky enough to not have a morning weekend game scheduled, they get up early to peruse all the artisans’ wares. Steve even lets Tony give his input towards records or movies that seem interesting to him. Without fail, Steve usually ends up walking out with vinyls and VHS tapes he would normally have no intent on buying. A lot of it is a bit beyond the genres he would normally associate himself with, but there’s something kind of endearing about Tony’s odd, eclectic taste being juxtaposed into his life.
It’s deadly silent in the hotel room, Tony glancing over at where Steve is standing in the corner. He hasn’t moved from that spot since they got back, stoically leaned against the wall with his arms crossed, brow furrowed, and eyes glued to the floor, hardly engaging verbally with the group as they had all licked their wounds. Tony turns and walks back into their bedroom, slowly undressing and slipping under the covers. He hears the light in the other half of the suite click off, plunging them into darkness save for some ambient light outside. Tony’s facing the wall, staring into the blackness as he listens to Steve’s footsteps cross to his side of the room, the shifting of clothing, and then Steve pulling back his duvet and getting into bed himself. They settle into the kind of quiet that remains present in a room where both parties are clearly still awake, something unsaid hanging in the air.
Steve takes a moment to turn over the thoughts in his head before he leans down towards the mic. "Playing baseball professionally for the past thirteen years has been an absolute dream of mine. I grew up in Brooklyn as a huge Stars fan and the fact that I'm sitting here right now in front of you all is still surreal," he smiles comfortably, Bucky rubbing his shoulder.
Protesters have been lined up outside of the stadium on more than one occasion, having to be shooed away by the police to take up their offense off of their property. Tony sees variations of it both at home and away games, hateful “fans” posted up across the street to hurl homophobic slurs and wave their disgusting signs. He’s had things thrown at him in public, cars driving by to call him a fag out of their windows, found his own merchandise burned or destroyed and left in his yard. It’s nothing Tony hasn’t been preparing for, and at the end of the day, it doesn’t affect him in the slightest. While before he had endured plenty of hatred from the sports community for other reasons, it’s never quite
“If not today, when?” Steve sighs. “You’ve been doing really well with your grief counseling. I don’t want to force you, but if I don’t give you this little push then you won’t do it at all.” He reaches over to rub Tony’s shoulder. “I’ll be right here when you’re done and we’ll go straight to the park.”
He moves through the next day like molasses, Pepper staying the night and helping him get dressed the next morning. He puts on a nice suit, lets her clean him up and comb his hair, shave away any stubble to give him that innocent, boyish charm that everyone fawns over. She ushers him out to the car, keeping his face down and away from the reporters that have undeterredly returned after being shooed off by police the day before.
“No! I mean— Just with— with men, yes, I am, I guess…” He trails off awkwardly, wondering if he’s ruined this entire thing. Tony’s probably lost count of the amount of people he’s slept with while Steve could count them on one hand— Honestly, a couple of fingers.
“Tony?” He calls up the stairs, deciding to announce his presence this time. The music is still playing but is quieter than before, so surely Tony can hear him. He gets to the top of the stairs and sees why there’s no response.
Tony grins from behind the welding mask, flipping it up once he's satisfied with his work. "Completely untrue, Pep. We all know I'm a priority."
When he turns to go he notices a new addition to the wall by the door: a framed, group photo of all of them after the Championship win last year. Natasha stands proudly in the center of the photo, with the rest of the team piled in around her. He smiles at the memory, running his hand over the glass before exiting.
“Mmhm,” Natasha rolls her eyes but accepts it before looping her arm through Steve’s and walking back towards the dance floor. “Thanks for saving me back there. James is much better at the… small talk,” she sighs, suppressing a shudder.
Alongside his manager is a man who looks to be in his late 40s, streaks of grey woven through his dark hair that is combed back from a handsome face. He adorns a suit that probably costs as much as Steve's first Brooklyn apartment (it probably cost more than his current apartment too). He’s carrying a short glass of brandy and judging by the red blush on his cheeks, it’s not the first glass he's had that night.
What surprises him is how well Steve does for himself. He wins the first hand, Tony staring at him in surprise as he accepts his winnings and the croupier deals out the cards for another game. “I thought you didn’t gamble.”
She doesn’t answer as they reach her door. She opens it for him and waves him inside. Confused, Steve steps in, eyes still trained on her. “Nat, what’s going on?”
Steve’s eyes betray him, darting up to Tony’s face in surprise. There’s a brief moment of eye contact, Tony’s eyes still devoid of any comfort Steve can recognize. He looks away again, brow furrowed in frustration. “So are you.”
Steve hesitates outside the guest room, hearing a few dull thumps coming from Tony's room next door. He's just about to head in when he sees the door fly open, Tony stepping back out. He's got his shirt off now, a toothbrush hanging out of his mouth. He blinks a couple of times when he sees Steve in the hallway.
The table is almost comically long, to the point that Steve has to wonder if it was assembled in pieces or if tables could actually be manufactured at that length. He also has to wonder where the hell someone found a tablecloth long enough to cover it.
for insider details, telling him everything he wanted to hear and doing everything he wanted to be done to him, Steve isn’t sure he would've been able to resist at Tony's age.
smiles at him, possibly for the first time ever. "CSX2000," he says proudly, turning the key in the ignition. The sound of the motor roaring to life is orchestral. "One of the few original models still around. I've pretty much gutted and enhanced the engine, but everything else is original, even the upholstery."
Steve clears his throat awkwardly. “There’s always a learning curve to switching teams, but Tony’s doing really well. The players are beginning to warm up to his… quirks. Even Coach Romanoff—”
Short stop is one of the most demanding defensive positions, so Tony knows he has his work cut out for him. This is the ultimate opportunity to show off the range of his skillset. He doesn't mind being pigeon-holed as a pitcher, he's phenomenal at it after all. The only times he normally got the opportunity to leave the mound was for the friendlies, and there was still only a 50% chance Obadiah would let him try out a different position. This game is going to be huge in terms of showing Tony's versatility with his scientific method, and that it didn't just apply to throwing the perfect pitch.
This looked like news to both of them. "What?" Janet asks, immediately followed by Natasha kicking a tire of the bus.
“Sadly, bland hospital food is all I have for you,” She places a tray on the attached table of his bed, Tony staring down at the diagonally cut white bread sandwich, apple sauce, and pudding.
Tony is about to ask her where she gets off charging into his house and yelling in his face until he sees the picture staring up at him in the folder. Tabloid covers are usually a hideous amalgamation of a bunch of different celebrity photos all jammed in and highlighted with red and yellow circles to grab people’s attention, text slapped down clumsily in heavy fonts of varying sizes with all the outlandish claims promised to be expanded on inside. This one is just a single photo blown up to fill the cover, and bold white block letters proclaiming:
. Now you apologize right now for how you’ve acted tonight— Actually, you should apologize for the last
The vein that pops out on his forehead reminds him of Obie. It reminds him of a lot of people, actually. Maybe there’s a common denominator here. “I didn’t put you where you asked just so you could piss around. I got bigger things to worry about than keeping an eye on you to make sure you’re not screwin’ about on the field. You’re out. I’m pulling you from the rotation.”
Steve doesn't have anything else to say, knowing Tony will twist his words or make him feel uncomfortable in some way or another. It’s not so much the harsh words that bring Steve discomfort, but the fact that he can feel he’s half-hard beneath the towel. He quickly leaves the showers and changes, thinking of anything and everything to make his erection disappear. It’s not difficult to stamp down whatever sort of feelings are causing his loins to stir when he has so many mixed, confused thoughts floating around in his head.
The IL is shaken up after Tony’s play. There’s a chance their batter will pull through, and Tony just prays he’s smart enough to get the ball as far away from home as possible to give Tony time to earn the team their fourth run in one inning. He hits the first ball pitched to him, Tony launching forward and skidding to a stop half-way between the bases when the whistle blows and it’s called foul. His ankle throbs slightly as he goes back to the base, hands on his hips. The small ache isn’t any cause of concern, Tony knowing it’s just an after effect from some soreness from practice a week ago where he had been rotating too sharply on that foot. After a few more massages from the PTs, he’ll be good as new.
Steve isn’t surprised by Tony’s absence. While it’s supposedly for both of his parents, it’s quite clear it centers around Howard, everyone there focusing on all his accomplishments for the greatest sport in America. Maria is mentioned mostly as an afterthought. Steve only really tunes in when it’s Peggy who takes to the podium to speak.
Tony's one request this year is that he isn't put on the All-Star team as a pitcher. Considering there are going to be three other people on the roster to fill that position, it will force him into being either a relief or starter and he probably won't even get to play more than three innings. Screw that.
It’s not quite a shutout, seeing as Tony only pitched four innings rather than the entire game, and the opposing team scored plenty leading up to him coming in as relief… but it’ll do. Tony only throws pitches he knows can either strike the player out, or that are impossible to turn into a ground ball which gives his fielders the opportunity to catch an out. No one on the PCL even gets the opportunity to make it on base, and the whistle is blown with the final scorecard reading 10-9.
“What’s the use of a couch that looks nice if it doesn’t feel nice to sit on?” Tony counters around a yawn, lifting up his hoodie a little as he scratches sleepily at his stomach. There are seam lines indented on his cheek that was pressed against the couch, it almost comical in the way it mirrors the faint scars on the other side.
“Of course,” Steve nods. “Thanks for talking to me about it… Like I mentioned before, your secret is safe with me.”
Now, both of them are enjoying a long overdue vacation. Since his spontaneous coming out, they’ve been a lot more careful about their relationship. The visits dwindled to Very Rarely, and they stopped going out in public altogether. In the past, being spotted by fans or even the media was nothing newsworthy, just a couple of old friends out for a lunch or dinner before meeting up with more teammates at the pub afterwards. Now, Tony refuses to let anyone make the connection that Steve was his mystery lover from the photos who was never able to be identified. Even if the sneaky pap had been able to grab the license plate, Steve was clever enough to cover his tracks at the rental place with a fake name. There has been plenty of speculation around the identity of the man in the photos, but luckily not even the biggest conspirators against Tony have drawn the conclusion that it could be his former Captain. Tony likes to think it’s because Steve portrays himself as so
"There might be a point to what he's talking about. It's one thing if he didn't have the skill to back it up, but we've watched this kid play amazingly and consistently every single game using this ‘scientific method of baseball’ he claims works so well. Clearly, he's doing something right, and maybe it's something not everyone can see. I think the attitude just comes from him being young and naïve."
Tony ends up letting Steve pick where they go first as they make their way through the crowded streets, the sun having just set. There are already plenty of inebriated tourists and locals alike bumping into each other, people in all sorts of crazy outfits coming from and going to the different shows around the area.
He finally looks up from his plate to see Steve staring back at him with a blank expression. “Which team?” He asks calmly.
“Sure,” Tony answers vaguely, trudging back down the hill towards the cursed Pinto. “All emotional scarring is now healed, time to get on with our lives.” He hears a heavy sigh behind him and can’t fight his smile.
“Hey, Tony, you free later? If you’re not satisfied after getting fucked during this game today, I saw some old Wall Street pervs at our hotel who would probably love some company!”
The days continue to tick by, time spent in a similar fashion. Tony’s a very gracious host, minding his own business and giving Steve plenty of space to have some time to himself so they don’t drive each other
Natasha looks around at the team, clearly unsure if she should allow this. "Yes, fine," she spats, waving a hand. "Everyone give Stark some practice swings and then I want to see you hit that ball into the outfield."
He catches Steve checking out his appearance in the mirror on their way out and not looking completely displeased. Tony’s smug as he holds the door open for Steve, pushing the red-lensed Ray Bans up on his nose. “After you.”
Scott finally has a clean hit. Steve bolts for home with powerful strides, not a single twinge or falter in his movement as he crosses home plate. Tony doesn’t unclench, staring at Steve from the corner of his eye as the man returns to the dugout, keeping a wide berth from Tony as he chugs a bottle of water. After Cleese hits a double, Thor follows things up with a home run, the next player is out before he can get to first, and the penultimate inning comes to a close. The Avengers now have a massive lead with nineteen total runs,
Tony wanders closer, sitting on the edge of Steve’s bed to stare curiously at a monologuing Kirk Douglas. “I’ve read the novel. And a couple of biographies. You know the famous ‘I’m Spartacus’ moment was never actually documented by historians? Fast made it up for his version.”
Steve laughs. “Be on your best behavior,” He chides, thinking back to Natasha’s joking comment from last night about his friend’s current status.
He’s still the same rule-following dweeb from when they were kids, but his appearance has certainly changed. People mistook them as brothers when they were younger, same dark hair and intelligent eyes, but Ty’s were shrouded by thick-framed spectacles. He’s slim but well-built, lithe muscles similar to Tony’s with an added height that leaves him with an impressive stature— He might even be taller than Thor. His once brunette hair has been bleached blonde, but he’s been allowing the roots to grow back out. Tony’s first comment to him was that if he’s not careful with his haircuts in the next couple of months, he might be left with some very unfortunate looking frosted tips.
"We'll start with overall questions from the papers first before we take questions for individual players," Peggy says. Hands shoot into the air and the questioning begins.
There’s a more public memorial service held in Malibu, approved media coverage airing on ESPN as it’s a special gathering of influential individuals from the baseball world who go to pay their respects. Tony himself does not attend, all of the speakers offering their condolences to the last remaining Stark.
“Damn straight. But he might have just a little to do with that,” she says, giving Tony a friendly nudge with her elbow. She glances over her shoulder to where her father is gathering their things on the dock. “I better help Dad load up the truck before he throws out his back trying to do it all by himself.” She turns back to Tony, a pensive look on her face. “You said you’re out in Truro? Would you like to come back up here tomorrow morning and meet me for a run?”
his absolutely uncalled for. “Yeah, there’s a reason for that. I’d rather shove a fork in my eye than have to sit around a table and endure uninspiring small talk over cheap beers in some shitty dive bar while we watch Barton fail at trying to pick up women. But you guys have fun,” he walks away from Steve again, throwing a lazy wave over his shoulder.
At least he didn’t confess his undying love for Steve last night, which would be irrefutably worse. He probably would have been hit a second time in one night.
Jarvis isn’t pleased, either, Tony knows, but he doesn’t do anything. Three days ago, the first time Ty told Jarvis to do something—
“Thanks,” he says. Takes a screwdriver. Unscrews a screw on the left and routes the wire where Ty told him to. It opens up the space.
Tony briefly considers turning around, running, and never looking back. Instead, he smiles, shuts the door behind him, and sits in the other chair. “Tiberius,” he says, with a nod in Ty’s direction. He even looks at Ty. Because fucking hell. He can handle this. What’s Ty going to do to him here, right under Fury’s nose?
fault that the team knocks down a building or two while saving the literal earth. Which, okay, maybe it is, but still. Ridiculous.
Steve can’t leave, now. He debates continuing the conversation, but Tony doesn’t seem all that interested. He considers going to the fridge again, but if he eats anything more, he won’t sleep at all tonight.
Steve is standing in the doorway, mouth slightly open, duffel in hand and hair slightly mussed like he just got off the plane.
A contract dated only two-and-a-half weeks ago. A contract cosigned by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury.
Tony moves his head around in something akin to a circle. Steve’s pretty sure it’s a nod, but he can’t actually tell.
Nat frowns. “Meetings, stuff like that? I think he’s working with the CEO on projects so he stays in line. I tried to tell Fury it was stupid, but—”
“It seems like you don’t understand exactly how this goes,” Ty says. He’s losing control now. Tony can tell. He’s angry. “Here’s our arrangement. You do what I say. I say jump, and you say how high. You don’t talk back, and you don’t say no, got it?” he says.
“I need to go,” Steve says. He walks to the closet, pulls out his bag, and starts shoving clothes in it. Whatever he can reach. Probably some of Clint’s stuff, but it doesn’t matter.  “I need to—there’s something I need to do.”
As he passes, he leans over so his hand is on Tony’s lower back and lingers for a moment before smiling at him, inches from his face, and turning and walking out the elevator doors.
He had a plan, didn’t he? Going into this? A plan for how he would deal with Ty, and protect himself, and everything would go back to normal.
and says, “Any time I bring up, like, a boyfriend or something. You close off. Get all cold. Guess I figured…” He runs a hand through his hair. “Whatever.”
of all people. And for something he didn’t even do, which isn’t fair, because there are so many bad things that he
Steve puts a hand under Tony’s elbow and slowly guides him to the couch, then sits on the opposite end. The last thing he needs to do right now is get in Tony’s space, make him uncomfortable. Instead, he looks at Tony.
and that’s bad. If he doesn’t work faster, Ty will be indefinite. And Ty can’t be indefinite. He needs to be gone, so that Tony can think, so that Tony can
“Well. Regardless, I’ve been telling Mr. Stone here about some of the…internal problems we’ve been having,” Fury continues, and at first Tony doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Internal problems? “We were thinking that we could bring in another individual. To moderate, and…” Fury keeps talking, but Tony tunes his voice out, because he knows, now, what Fury is talking about.
The elevator finally, finally shows up, and he speed-walks down the hallway. When he gets to Fury’s door, it’s shut. He gives a curtesy knock and then walks in, ready to start complaining about Viastone Corp.
“I don’t need a babysitter. I don’t agree to this,” he says, with as much confidence as he can muster. Under Ty’s gaze, the statement withers, and sounds more like a complaint. Tony swallows again. His throat is dry. His breath is catching, he needs to get that under control.
His head is aching so badly he can barely lift it. He squeezes his eyes shut, blinks. He recognizes this pain, though. The pain that only intensifies when he tries to think, that feels like someone’s stuffed his head full of cotton balls and then gone at it from the outside with a hammer.
The workshop door slides open without him even giving a command or code. At first, he thinks that Tony isn’t here. Then he sees a small figure sitting against the opposite wall, shaking.
“I hope our little run-in last night won’t stop us from being able to work together. That really was a misunderstanding, Tony. I forgive you for hitting me, of course,” Ty concedes with a nod. “You thought you were protecting yourself.” Then he chuckles, leans forward. Tony holds himself in place. “Don’t know what you thought you needed protecting from. You know I always do what’s best for you. And Director Fury clearly knows it too.”
“Let it go, Cap. It’s not a big deal," he says, and starts to make himself a cup of coffee. "What the hell is going on with the coffee machine?” he asks, to change the subject, but also because someone has fucked with it. His coffee machine. The buttons are sticking, and it looks like someone tried to unscrew the back off, unsuccessfully. With their fingernails, or something. Had Wolverine come into the apartment in the middle of the night?
Steve looks at her. She doesn’t know. She must not know—Fury can’t have done this on purpose, which means he doesn’t know, and so Tony is completely alone. Alone. And Tony hasn’t written him, hasn’t asked for help. This is bad. Tony isn’t safe. He’s alone, with Tiberius Stone, with
He picks the mug up and holds it tight in his hand. His senses are still a little loopy, and he doesn’t want to drop it.
“No—sorry. I mean, that’s great. Obviously I’m, you know, supportive,” Tony rushes out. “Would be pretty hypocritical of—whatever. I thought you—” he shakes his head again, cuts himself off.
Nat’s currently beside him, drinking an espresso and poking at a crumbling croissant. She has a headscarf on and sunglasses and looks nice, like an aristocrat straight out of a movie. Steve is sitting in the small wire chair next to her. He’s dressed nicely, too, but he hates Paris for its delicate ground and delicate chairs and delicate tables. It makes him feel huge.
He needs to be in his workshop. When the elevator gets to the ground floor, he walks out as fast as he can, drives back to the tower, nearly runs over a pedestrian on the way, leaves his car with the valet. Inside the tower, he practically flies through the hallways until he’s in the workshop, and then he shuts the door, sits on the floor, and tries to breathe.
Steve blinks. Looks at Tony, who seems unphased by what he’s just said. “Roofies?” he asks slowly. His heart thumps in his chest, one, two. “Like, he put something in your drink?”
Tony goes into the cupboard to look for a mug, then sees one drying next to the sink. It’s his favorite, has a stupid science pun on the front. Bruce bought it for him ages ago. Did he wash it last night after using it? He can’t imagine how he would have managed that.
Steve sighs again. Tony does do this a lot. Stays up for days, working on some project or another, mixes alcohol and coffee in ways that no person—not even a superhuman like Steve, much less someone with a heart condition—should. Steve’s gotten used to it. But he’s pretty sure Tony was at some gala tonight, based on the suit, not in his lab, so he’s not really sure what Tony’s staying awake for.
Steve’s knuckles are white, he notices, he’s gripping his knees in a way that would bruise if he wasn’t a superhuman. He needs to stand, to hit Ty. Step three. He needs step three.
So that’s why he wasn’t interested in the conversation. Here was Steve, finally making amends, and there was Tony, drunk off his ass. Makes sense.
She asked him this yesterday, too. He brushed her off. But she’s good at reading him and he’s not particularly difficult to read. He’s always had trouble with that, keeping his emotions off of his face. Another reason he makes a terrible spy. What is he supposed to tell her?
“I thought you were going to route the underneath. So it doesn’t get hooked by other lines, you know, if Fury or someone is—”
Steve swallows. Folds his arms, then feels like that makes him look angrier, so puts his hands in his pockets instead. “No. You’re good, Tony. Don’t worry,” he says, and sits back down, still a cushion and a half away from Tony. “You’re safe,” he says, and that’s more for his own sake than Tony’s, but Tony curls up a little anyways and yawns.
He doesn’t look at Steve, because there’s way too much going on right now without Steve’s look of disappointment, or pity, or whatever is happening on his stupidly attractive face.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve sees Tony start to fall. He reaches out, fast, and catches him. “Hey, there, cowboy,” he says. “You okay?”
from the awkwardness of this situation, but his head protests and he slumps back onto the couch. He hates this feeling. Similar to a hangover, but so, so much worse. And it reminds him of Ty, an added bonus. “So are you.”
This time, he does stand. Bright, black spots creep over his vision for a minute and he blinks, clears them. This is fine. He can handle this. He walks to the kitchen and Steve trails behind him, because of course. Freaking golden retriever. Tony wants to hate him, but he can’t.
By the time 3:30 rolls around, Tony is feeling…well, not good, but slightly better. Advil and copious amounts of coffee are helping. He’s running late for the meeting, tapping his foot and looking at his watch while the elevator dings up to the top floor. Tony’s usually late, and he usually doesn’t care, but the combination of his killer headache and the lingering presence of Ty is throwing him off, making him twitchy. Like he’s sixteen again. He can almost smell Ty’s cologne in here, clean and sharp and almost citrusy, like bleach.
Steve looks up. Tony’s looking at him, and Steve can see his eyes. Dark brown, long lashes. For a moment he can’t even remember the question. “Uh—yeah. Yes. I went back and found him at some upscale restaurant. He wasn’t happy about it. Yelled at me over his lobster bisque.”
Tony isn’t looking at him. His eyes are downcast, and Steve wishes he could see them, if only to know what Tony is thinking. Not that he ever knows what Tony’s thinking, even when he can see him. But it would be nice to be able to see his eyes.
Tony swallows. Behind Ty’s head, the floors are clicking downward. They’re passing twelve, now, but the elevator isn’t like his. It moves at a crawl.
“You—what?” Steve manages. Pulls himself together. He still can’t quite look at Tony, like it’s forbidden or something. Intrusive. “Um. You have brown hair?”
to work as best they can. It’s not his fault that people have tried to steal his designs and have used them for bad shit before, and now he’s protective over them. And, okay, sometimes that ends in him being secretive and unhelpful, from S.H.I.E.L.D.’s standpoint. They hate dealing with him. But he gives them good tech. At the end of the day, they can’t do better than him.
Tony stares at the wires for a moment. He doesn’t. He doesn’t say thank you to people who, who he doesn’t like. Who he doesn’t like for reasons. Good reasons. He’s not a pushover, he’s not someone people can just control, can tell to do something and expect him to do it. He’s Tony fucking Stark, for god’s sake. He’s Ironman.
Of course, no one on the team really likes sleeping. Nightmares are bad for almost all of them. But most of them accept sleep as something necessary. Tony usually does, too, when he’s not working on a project.
They’re all staying in one room. The hotel is nice, though, with a good minibar and fancy, boring art on the walls. The lobby has chandeliers. The water pressure is unbelievable. Of course, Clint’s things are strewn all over the room, so that mitigates the luxury. No one but Clint could overpack for a spy mission.
“Ty is…Ty. Didn’t think—but he’s. I’m smarter!” he says finally, tapping on his temple. “Outsmarted him. ‘M not stupid. He can’t make me stupid.”
He’s not even sure he’s awake for the rest of the meeting. His head is aching and his heart is thumping and it’s all he can do to not have a full-blown panic attack right in Fury’s office, which would probably end up in him getting immediately removed from the contract. So he sits and nods and when the meeting ends, practically runs out of Fury’s office so he won’t have to share an elevator with Ty.
“You sure were in a rush,” he says lazily. He leans back against the wall. Tony goes to press the ground floor button. “Oh, press the button for the third floor, too,” he says. Tony presses it without thinking. Nearly curses. Sticks his hands in his pockets.
Ty moves his other hand on the other side of Tony’s waist, slips his other thumb under Tony’s shirt. He’s right behind Tony, now, and it’s—it’s just double. Two of something is the same as one of something, really. Lots of things come in twos. Chopsticks. Window curtains.
Or—not disappears. That’s not fair, Tony reasons, a screwdriver tucked under his armpit and a great, lousy hunk of metal in front of him that just won’t cooperate. Steve went on a mission, Fury sent him. And even if he did just disappear, well, he doesn’t owe Tony anything. So, he’s gay. Bi. Whatever. That doesn’t mean he’s into Tony.
Steve blinks. Ty—Ty who drugged Tony. Is now his oversight. Fury assigned Tony to be overseen by Ty. “What does outside oversight mean?” he asks. Nat doesn’t look up. “Nat. What does outside oversight mean.” There’s a bead of blood coming from his thumb. The glass must have cut it. It doesn’t matter. It’ll heal in a few seconds.
He’s known that he’s gay for a long time, and he knows Tony’s gay, too, but Tony doesn’t like him. And there’s the team to think about. So he keeps it to himself. But it’s hard, sometimes.
Tony turns on the water. “You know. This—this fighting. It’s, you’re my AI. You’re supposed to, you know, help me out. Be on my side.”
Tony’s eyes, wide with fear, flicker in front of Steve’s vision. No, Tony wasn’t lying. They must have kept their relationship secret, then. That’s something Steve has heard about—celebrities wanting to keep things on the down low. Maybe that’s why he can’t find anything on Tony’s relationship.
Which—something about Tony’s tone is strange. Steve turns around, looks at Tony for the first time, and realizes he’s wearing a suit.
Nat shrugs at him, points out a nice bookshop and says, “Hey, we should go in there later,” all tourist, and then says, “He’s frustrated with our engineer.”
Ty has come in every day since that meeting. Twice, most days. He gets closer every time. Like he’s a shark. Circling. Waiting. It doesn’t help that Tony’s working on stuff for comms, which takes a long time and is generally uninteresting and Ty is getting
There’s a tense moment where Tony’s looking at Steve like he’s not sure whether he just tore the Avengers apart or not. Then, Steve starts to laugh.
And six years ago, when Ty had tried to blackmail him with that stupid, godawful sex tape—well, Tony hadn’t gotten rid of that, but he’s dripping with sex tapes at this point, so. One more out there on the internet wasn’t any great loss. Ty didn’t succeed in blackmailing him, anyways.
The smile gets wider. “Exactly,” he says. “You know, Tony,” he says, and Tony already knows what he’s about to ask for. He’s seen that look before. Not for years, but he knows it well. “I’ve been thinking about other things that you’re…ah, practiced, at, recently.”
The first seems done, at least for now. Tony’s drugged, of course, but Steve’s not sure what else he can do besides wait it out and make sure Tony doesn’t choke on his own vomit if he eventually passes out. Be here, basically, and Steve can do that.
Like his body isn’t his own. Nothing is his own. There’s no part of his life that can’t be taken. That Ty can’t take.
Tony shifts on his foot. “Guess I could use some coffee,” he hedges. In the corner, Dum-E whirs excitedly, and Tony shoots him a glare that he hopes conveys
“You really should sleep,” Steve says. He’s aware that Tony won’t like that, and that it won’t help, so he’s not sure why he says it, except for the fact that it’s undeniably true. The more he looks at Tony, the worse Tony looks, even as Steve still tries determinedly to look away. He’s sweaty and pale, and his eyes are glassy. How much did he have to drink at that gala?
Tony pulls up his phone while Ty is distracted by searching for “the perfect Red Hot Chili Peppers song,” ugh. A few quick swipes and he’s in the SHIELD databases. Still drawing the schematic with one hand, he scrolls, looking for—there. The most recent report from Barton.
Ty’s smile shutters closed. He puts his hand on Tony’s arm. “Tony,” he says, his voice soft and disappointed, like Tony is a child. “That’s a bit rude, isn’t it? I see why Fury asked me to come help out…you can be pretty insulting, sometimes. I’m sure you didn’t mean it though,” he says, and his voice turns hard again, and cold. The threat is so, so obvious. “Did you?”
Steve shrugs. “It’s no problem,” he says eventually, when it doesn’t sound like Tony’s going to say anything else. “I used to—in the war, a lot of my buddies would. Well. I don’t know if that’s what’s helpful anymore, but it calmed people down back then okay.”
She’s doing something on the computer. It looks high-tech and Steve doesn’t want to ask, so he doesn’t. Instead, he digs the croissant he managed to save out of his pocket and tosses it at Clint.
Great. So, he’s someone with money. It’s not out-of-the-question that he’s one of those rich, Bruce-Wayne-style assholes who thinks he’s going to take over the world with tech and builds himself a couple of mediocre weapons, and he went after Tony because he’s an Avenger, or another tech guy, or whatever. But that doesn’t really add up.
“You’ve always made such good coffee. Fucking no one makes it strong enough, y’know?” Ty says. “You, though, you get me.”
“Yeah,” he says, looking at Fury. If he narrows his vision in a certain way, Ty's not even here. “I am in the tech field, after all. Big competitor and all that.” Vistastone Corporation is not actually a competitor. They’re
Tony groans and draws his rolling chair up to a computer. He tries to ignore the pounding in his head the bright screen is causing as he does some quick typing. But things only get stranger when he goes into the back end of S.H.I.E.L.D. to purge Ty from any future guest lists so he
And it’s not like he’s told Fury about Ty, and he’s pretty sure Nat doesn’t know, either, (though he wouldn’t put it past her), and so he can’t be upset that Ty was on the list, even if it does suck and he does plan on hacking their systems and fixing that shit immediately. Hell, people don’t even know that they
But he can’t. At first he thinks it’s because of the nickname. He looks up lists of Tony’s exes, some Cosmo article titled
He hangs up one of the extra-strength punching bags. Tony designed these after Steve kept breaking through the normal ones. They work like a charm, and Steve gives it a couple of warm-up hits and then starts really going at it.
“You should go to bed. Instead of drinking more of that,” Steve nods to the coffee machine. “It’s not going to do you any good.”
Steve raises an eyebrow. Usually, Nat isn’t so quick to criticize Fury. Of course, she could be making that up, for the sake of the conversation, but she told him once she likes to have truthful conversations, when she’s undercover. It makes the rest of the lie flow more easily. And anyways, Fury isn’t listening on the comms. It’s Clint on the other end, holed up in an apartment up North, watching out the window.
“Jesus!” Clint says, staring at him. “Dude, are you okay? StarkPhones are indestructible.” He stands, croissant still in his hand.
“No,” Steve says, trying to keep the strain from his voice. Tony’s eyes soften again, and he slumps back. “He’s not here. He’s not here. Tony. How do you know Ty?”
He punches harder. Shakes out the pain in his knuckles. It’s a good distraction. Because this is—this is none of his business. Tony doesn’t want him here.
Tony taps his foot. The tenth floor, now. Maybe someone will stop it, get in with them, but no such luck. Ty shifts closer to Tony.
But if Tony says that Ty can have the contract, then his teammates are going out into the field with shitty equipment. He’s putting his teammates in danger. He’s putting his
Steve knows Tony has panic attacks. He’s seen the aftermath. Tony is left shaky, pale, and gasping, though he tries his best to hide it. He’s pretty sure, though, that Jarvis is under orders to not tell anyone when it’s happening. So why is he telling Steve now? Did Tony say that he could? Steve doubts that, somehow, and that means that somehow this one is bad enough to let Jarvis override that protocol.
“She’s going North,” she murmurs. “She hasn’t noticed us. We’re on a date. Talk to me. Be cute about it,” she adds, her tone completely flat.
appropriately. The last thing he needs is Ty losing it because he thinks Tony is trying to poison him with motor oil. Actually, now that he thinks of it, poisoning Ty with motor oil might—no. Bad thought. No killing people, even if they’re massive douchebags.
“Clint’s right,” he manages. “We don’t need a guy in the window anymore. He can take my place.” He doesn’t want to leave his team in danger, understaffed, unprepared, but he
Tony didn’t want him involved. Even if Tony did ask for help, he would hardly ask Steve. This is none of his business.
Steve takes his hand off Tony’s arm, though keeps his hands out of his pockets, ready to catch him if he falls again, which seems more than likely. Tony picks his coffee back up off the counter and drinks another long sip. He sets it back on the counter and suddenly turns to Steve with full force.
That’s where Steve has seen his face before. A blurry photo of a tall blonde guy making out with Tony in a club.
Tony swallows. Tobacco, aftershave. Ty is leaning over his shoulder, now, right up behind him, looking at the device.
It occurs to Tony, belatedly, that Ty knew about all of this beforehand. Fury must have reached out to him and explained it already. That’s why he did what he did last night. So that Tony would be off of his game during this meeting and he would get a better business deal. That's always what it's about, isn't it?
Not that he wants to avoid Tony—he likes talking to his teammate, maybe a little too much, but they’ve been fighting recently. Today was their worst yet, and Steve can’t even remember what it was about. Some command he’d given on the field. Probably a bad one.
He takes a bite of his apple. It’s too loud in the silence of the room. Can Tony hear him chewing, too?
” Tony cuts himself off, suddenly, admonishing, almost. His mouth is clamped shut in a thin line. His eyebrows are raised as if he’s been shocked by what he was about to say.
He nearly gives Fury a call, but his head is pounding and that voice will either send him over the edge or put him right to sleep. He’ll see him at their meeting later today, anyways, and give him a piece of his mind. Viastone tech. Jesus. Fury should be embarrassed.
Wires. Yellow, blue. Focus, Tony. Ty just—talks. That’s all he does. He talks, and tries to get in your head, but that’s stupid. You’re smarter than he is. Except you just made a stupid fucking mistake on this goddamn machine and now there’s no way to get the power out of it and keep the signals straight.
If he agrees, Ty is going to take every inch of space that Tony allows. He’s going to make Tony’s life a living hell, like Tony's sixteen again, at MIT and right under Ty's thumb, until Tony gives up and Ty gets the contract anyways.
Tony figured if he was good, if he showed Fury he could be good, cooperate, then Fury would call off this—whatever it is. Power play. And then Ty would be gone, and his tech would be safe, and he would be safe, and everything would be fine again. He plotted it out in his head. It would take a month, a month and a half at most. He would go back to Fury, with evidence of improvement. Stupid shit like that.
“He has an elevated heart rate and is having trouble breathing. All conditions indicate a panic attack,” Jarvis continues.
No. That’s not how this is going to go down. If he wants to figure out who Ty is, that needs to happen now, even if Tony will hate him in the morning.
So he takes a deep breath and looks right at Ty’s movie-star smile as he says, “I guess I’ll be seeing a lot more of you, partner.”
Three days. Tony’s not sure why he’s counting down. It’s not like Steve will be waiting to see him—likely, he won’t even see Steve until the next mission, or team meeting, or whatever—but he still is. He can’t be here alone anymore. Even knowing Steve was upstairs would help. That would help. Right?
“Was bad,” Tony finishes. “I know. Don’t worry about me. I’ve got it under control. Genius, remember?” he says, and stands up. Brushes his hands off on his pants and walks over to his computer. “Well, if that’s it, Cap, I’ve got a lot of work to do. Thanks for—for everything,” he says, tossing a look over his shoulder.
Which, granted, maybe he should have expected. It’s two in the morning, prime coffee-time for Tony. Steve rarely sleeps, either. He should have Tony’s nighttime schedule memorized by now so that he doesn’t have to have run-ins like this.
Tony looks at his feet. Looks back at the elevator doors. They open into his suite. He drums his fingers on his side. “I can’t—I can’t do this, right now, J. I really need—I can’t do this right now,” he says. Walks to the bathroom. He needs a shower.
Tony looks away. Focuses on Fury, who's not even looking at him. He can’t tell whether he’s being normal or not. He doesn't remember how to act.
After ten minutes—five? thirty?—Ty’s thumb moves under his shirt. Onto his skin. Which is—fine. It’s in the same place, Tony reasons. What’s a layer of cloth. What’s a shirt, anyway. Let’s all be nudists. It would do a lot to combat shame. Or whatever.
“Yes,” Tony says, slowly. This could work. If he pisses Steve off enough, or whatever, and then he’ll drop it. Give up, decide it's not worth the trouble. “A thing. You know. Taxes. Daylight savings. Mondays.”
“You’re doing the thing again,” she points out, not taking her eyes off of the river in front of them. Really, they’re both watching a woman behind them in the café. That’s their mark. Nat hasn’t looked at her once. Steve turned around an hour ago and Nat almost slapped him for being so obvious. She probably would have done but slapping tends to cause scenes.
“I’m just going to sit here and talk to you, okay, Tony?” he says. Tony doesn’t reply. It’s possible he didn’t hear. “I’m not going to get any closer. But I figure I should tell you about—well, I should tell you about this time me and Buck went to this old bar in Brooklyn, yeah? This was when I was still tiny, mind you—” he launches into a story about how he got turned away from the bar and then tried to dress up to get inside in various outfits. He’s mostly on autopilot, keeping watch of Tony’s movements and his breathing, which slowly begins to steady as Steve gets to the part of the story where Bucky pilfers some old asshole’s watch and gives it to him so he can look dignified, and then he has to go chase down the guy and give it back to him.
