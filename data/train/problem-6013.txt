Steve’s tongue touched his bottom lip, just like it did last night on the roof. Tony’s stomach flipped over, and he felt his cock stir. “How do I do that?” Steve asked, and his voice sounded innocent, but his eyes were suddenly anything but. Suddenly, they looked almost predatory. Tony’s cock stirred again.
He knew he was being a hypocrite.  He’d stayed out until almost midnight only a few days ago, but he couldn’t help it.  Steve could stay out late if he wanted, but he had to say something.  He had to tell Tony

“No. This is perfect.”
insisted on shoes--and she slipped coming around the corner, and she just went flat on her back.”
“They hypnotized you?  Why?”
Steve smiled back. He couldn’t help it. Even with Nick’s words still rattling in his head, he couldn’t help it. “Hey.”
Tiny tables littered the outside of the dancefloor. Steve pulled out a chair for Nat then sat next to her. He saw her eyes flicking here and there, picking out the team, picking out the exits. They lingered on Clint and Laura for only a beat longer than anywhere else. Steve noticed but dismissed it.
“So, does that mean you
“For what?”
Tony took a step back.  “Well…” he said.
“The chances of me getting cancer are pretty small.”
“Furry little bastard,” Tony muttered.  “I should just use the gauntlet.  Half a second is all it would take.”
Steve looked up. Nodded. “Yeah, Mr. Barker. I’m okay.”
Steve put his hands obediently behind his back, wrists together, thumbs together, and the sheriff clapped the cuffs on him.
Steve nodded.  “Once.”
He glanced disdainfully at Tony, then leaned closer to Pepper.  “Maybe you’ll save me a dance,” he said.  “You could even wear your heels.”
Tony fixed him with a stern gaze.  “That stays here, Sam, ‘kay?  If Pepper ever found out I said that--”
“No. You’ve done so much for me already-”
He didn’t change his mind.
“Tonight,” he said, grabbing Tony’s hand and kissing the palm. “Okay?”
“Not that I don’t like the idea of a guy’s hand up my ass…” Tony said, and Steve ducked his head, coughing--almost choking--feeling the blush he couldn’t control coloring his face alarmingly fast. Tony laughed. “And there it is,” he said.
“Of course.”
“When we, as a pure community, erase the black marks in this country’s ledger, it’s only then, we can truly be free.  Don’t you agree, Captain?”
Tony put his hand on Steve’s chest. “When are you coming home?” he asked quietly. “To stay?”
He kissed the top of her sweet-smelling hair and brushed it out of her eyes with absent affection. “Yeah, peanut?”
Steve nodded, and Tony gripped his hands with both of his.  Steve squeezed back.
Tony licked his lips, eyes on Steve. He looked flustered, his face pink. He ran a hand through his hair. “We’ll come watch them again. Right, Steve?”
“Deal.”
Tony tossed his briefcase onto the couch and sat the flowers on the table. “Yeah. My last meeting got cancelled, so I just decided to come home.” He started across the room, and Steve retreated a step. He glanced at his easel, and reached down for the sheet that lay at his feet.
“FRI?” he said.  “You still with me?”
Natasha nodded.  “Sit down.”
was something he would get to keep.
Bucky nodded without lifting his head.  His tears fell onto Steve’s face like a baptism.
Steve shrugged, taking his wallet out of his pocket. He threw some cash on the bar. “Why not? Unless you don’t want to?”
it--but he touched Tony’s hand where it sat on the console between them. Touched the long fingers. Brushed his own along them. He ducked his head, shy now in a way he hadn’t been in months. “Will you love me forever, Tony?” he asked, looking at him from under his lashes, needing to hear the answer, but afraid of it all the same.
He looked down and Steve took his hand.  “I love it,” he said.
Not at all.
“There’s people around all the time, but there’s nobody really to talk to.  It’s like when I was a kid.  I’m kind of the odd man out.”
An evil, manic glint came into Tony’s eye.  Good god, he
“I love you,” Steve said again.
Tony reached out again--slowly, so Steve could see his empty hand--and touched his arm. “Did something happen?” he asked.
“Even the glaciers move a little, Steve.” He squeezed his arm, chanced a step closer. “Right?”
“Yes.”
Tony thought lazily, looking at the sky.
“I hope so.”
“Hey,” Steve soothed, running his hand up and down Tony’s back.  “It’s okay.  No.  No, that won’t happen again, Tony.  Never again, okay?”  He kissed his forehead with great, almost breathtaking tenderness.  “I’m here.  I’m not going anywhere.”
She reached in and pulled out a can of Coke.  She didn’t open it, just held it between her hands, waiting.  She knew him, knew of his need to be in control, and let it happen, allowing him the illusion even though she would dictate how the conversation went.  Her trust in him was absolute--as much as it was with Clint--but sometimes he needed guidance to get to where he needed to go.  She could do that for him.

He was going to be sleeping in the bed with Steve.

Steve flicked ash over the railing.  “Then what is the point?”
idea what time it is?”
was what Ross had really been afraid of.  This light.  This brilliance.  This ability to spark something inside someone else--everyone else.  As much as he liked to believe that Steve was only a dangerous animal, Ross knew deep inside himself that Steve was a man.  A man who could inspire and rally and lead.  Steve--Captain America--was a symbol of higher values, lasting ideals, the things Steve believed in, things men like Ross thought were gone.  This was a new world.  A politicians’ world.  A world made for men like Thaddeus Ross, and he didn’t want to lose that.  None of them did.  The men who had created this world for themselves would do anything to keep it.  Steve believed in equality, goodness, humanity, handshakes.  He looked at the person, not the package, and to some men, the thought that someone like Steve could inspire a new generation into action was probably terrifying.  Had Ross prayed for Steve’s death even as Tony sat by his bedside in Wakanda praying for his life?  Tony thought he had.
--they hadn’t been able to spend even an hour together. And wasn’t that the entire point of living together? That they got to be together more? Or at all? Because they hadn’t.
But he couldn’t speak. He couldn’t. Suddenly, it was all too much. Standing here in this gracious, chilly environment, standing here with Tony so close, and his mother so far, and he was tired, so fucking
Steve bowed his head, breathing deeply. Tony waited, letting him think, letting him decide for sure what it was he wanted. He knew what
Tony sat on the bumper of the car.  In his head, he heard Howard squawk with anger, but he ignored it.  He was getting better at the ignoring part.  He reached out and took Steve’s hand.
“This is in direct violation of the Sokovia Accords, Nick!  They state very plainly that if something like this occurs, the...person involved will be taken to The Raft where we can better  assess and control the situation.”
“Not because of the sex.”  Pause.  “Because you want me to.”
“He’d be a great dad.”
--toward him. Toward his friend. Toward James “Bucky” Barnes, where he lay screaming in the middle of the road.
“You’re not mad, are you?” he asked.
He had, of course.  Dozens of times.  Hundreds.  But to Tony, it always felt like the first time.  "I don't think so."
Tony sighed too, and Steve could
“Because I’ve made it so clear I don’t want you around.”
Tony nodded and met each of their eyes in turn.  “Yeah.  That sounds good.”
Tony sunk his teeth gently into Steve’s lower lip.  “Very nice of us,” he agreed.  “But back to the task at hand, so to speak,” Tony said, then pulled back to look Steve warily in the eye.  “Just tell me without mentioning him if you can, ‘kay?  It’s a real mood-killer.  The dude looks like a praying mantis.”
part of my problem,” Steve muttered without thinking about it.
Steve's phone vibrated again.
Sam scuffed his foot on the ground, looking a little like an overgrown kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. “I’m not calling
“What do you mean?” Tony asked.
Tony laid hold of the handles again and pushed the chair down the path that led to the dock.  Long grasses whickered against his jeans, against the chair’s wheels.  Across the lake, one lone boat bobbed on the water, a solitary fisherman.  In July, there’d be speed boats and jet-skis and kids playing grab-ass on the beach.  Not here, this was private, but near here, near enough to see and hear.  Far enough so that they wouldn’t be disturbed, but close enough so that they wouldn’t feel isolated either.
The deli guy pointed at him.  “Hey, you’re Iron Man!”
Steve hung up after that, then went into the bathroom. He turned the water on, shed his clothing, and climbed into the shower. He appreciated Nick’s concern. He knew why it was there. It was the same reason he’d been given this assignment in the first place. His last one had been rough. Very rough. He’d lost his partner--his friend--on that assignment. This was his quiet-time. His down-time. They had wanted to hold him back for six months after the last one, but he pushed to work. He convinced them he was ready. That he was not only ready, but
“I have to do this,” Steve said now. “If I want to keep Pietro, I have to.”
"You have a gray hair."
Steve nodded, his lips quivering.  The tears over-spilled his lashes, turning those blue eyes into dark sapphires.  “Take care of each other,” he begged, clutching their hands with panicky tightness.  “God, please promise me you’ll take care of each other.  Stay together.  Don’t-Don’t slip away.  It’s so easy to just...let people slip away.  Promise me you won’t do that.  Promise me you’ll find Wanda and the three of you will take care of each other.”
Morgan gazed up at him from the doorway. Her hair was mussed. The stuffed shark he’d bought for her at the aquarium dangled from her fist. Had he thought she was beautiful the night before? She was more than beautiful now. She was perfect.
Steve got up and got dressed. He washed and brushed his teeth, and when he came out of the bathroom, the bed was empty. He could smell coffee though, and he followed the scent to the kitchen.
He turned his head.  Steve was sitting beside him with Sir Purr on his lap.  He was stroking his big hand over the cat’s sides and back.  “You’re a good cat,” Steve murmured so softly Tony could barely hear him.  “Aren’t you?”
“Mmmm”
“Tony, what’s going--”
“He called me,” Rhodey said mildly, and took a long pull from his beer.  “He said you needed somebody to talk to.”
He came around the chair and sat on the vanity so he could look Steve in the eye.  No reflection was enough for this, he wanted the real version.  He plucked Steve’s hand out of his lap and held it in both of his own.
“Well, I’ll have to be more thorough next time.”
“I’m sorry I’m so awkward with her. I don’t know much about kids.”
Tony grinned and climbed on top of Steve to grab his tablet from Steve’s side of the bed.  He stayed there, perched on Steve’s lap, a knee on either side of his hips, tapping on the screen.  “They’re going to love us, baby, just wait and see.”
That laugh again. Low and fond. Steve felt a prickle of tears in the backs of his eyes, and he wiped them away before they could fall.
“Do I seem sorry?”
“Where are you going?”
Steve kept his eyes on Tony’s while he brought Tony’s hand to his mouth and kissed each knuckle gently over the bandage. He turned it over and kissed the palm for good measure.
“What the hell would Howard Stark from
Steve grinned. “Yeah, you always did want to trade me in for her.”
He was trying. Tony could see that. Could see that Bruce was trying--like a fucking
“I tried my access code.  It worked.”
It was another frustrating, nerve-wracking, hair-pulling fifteen minutes before he pulled the car into the hospital parking lot.  He got out and ran into the building. He didn't stop in the waiting room. He jostled past people, slowing now by necessity, and finally found Tony's door, opened it, and went inside.
He took her hand and led her back down the hall. “Mine are good. I make ‘em every morning. Hundreds of them.”
depressed.”
“Where are you staying?” Tony asked.
Listening to him talk, Tony became even more aware of how amazing Steve was.  How easy it would have been for him to fall into one of those categories--racist, sexist, homophobic.  It was all around him, all the time, and yet, he resisted.  He saw past those things.  He saw the good in people, the humanity in them, the fact that there was more to them than their color, or their gender, or who they were wired to love.  Thank god, Dr. Erskine had chosen him.  Thank god.
“Is she okay?” Steve asked, concerned.
“Before the serum.”
Or, other stuff.
Tony gripped him hard, not moving, just holding him tight in his fist, and Steve moaned.  “You’re being bad again, Captain Rogers,” Tony whispered.
“I want,” Steve said.  “I want.”
He turned hollow eyes on her.  “I betrayed him.”
Steve slid down in his seat, slumping a little, crossing his arms over his chest.  Tony’s heart ached.  It was how he always slept on a plane.  In a car.  On the couch.  Whenever he fell asleep sitting up, it was the same.
“I had to tell him Nat,” Bruce said.
“I don’t mean just this morning,” Steve said.  “All week.  Since they told me you were coming, I was afraid you’d change your mind.”
Steve laughed. “Yeah. That’d be a real bad example. You know, going to work instead of playing hooky to hang out with me.”
The end...
“She’s in recovery now,” he was saying, his voice pleasant and mild. “I’m keeping her overnight, but you can take her home in the morning.”
Bruce nodded.  “Me too.”
“I just meant--”
“Bye, Steve.”
“A man on a mission?”
Indignation rose up in Steve’s chest, but he pushed it down. He clenched his fists tighter together. “My mediocrity?”
Behind them, Clint made an exaggerated gagging sound. “Gross,” he proclaimed.
He erased that too.
Nat, as supple and strong as she’d ever been, slipped around him and fit her legs into his in a complicated leg-lock.  Tony groaned at the pressure on his knees and hips.
, Steve!”
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “I’ve thought that, too.”
He knew he sounded stupid. He could hear it in his own ears, but Tony didn’t laugh at him. Didn’t even crack a smile. His face stayed serious. “Do you want to go for a ride?” he said, and his voice was serious too. As if he was asking Steve for something life-altering. Like a kidney. Or for the rest of his life.
, no,” Bucky snapped. “Don’t do that. Don’t you even dare talk like that. You don’t make a decision like this based on what somebody else wants.”
“Jarvis?”
“-and you sound a little jealous. Are you jealous, Tony?”
Tony looked uncertain, but Steve thought he would give in. If he’d really wanted to go to a hotel, he would have just done that in the first place. “What about your mom?” Tony asked, and his eyes darted past Steve into the apartment behind him. “Is she asleep? What if she gets mad? I still haven’t met her yet.”
Tony nodded again. He didn’t trust himself to speak. He knew if he did, the tears would come.
Tony adjusted one more strand of hair, spent a few seconds lamenting the gray that was starting to show up near his temples, then finally made his way to the kitchen.
He looked different. Older. Tougher. He had always been lean and strong, but now, even with his jacket on, Tony could see how chiseled his body was. His cheekbones looked higher. His jawline, sharper. His skin--that perpetually pale skin--had gotten darker, colored by the desert sun, and Tony wondered fleetingly how many times it had burned and peeled before finally giving in and tanning. His hair, that soft, silky blond, had gotten darker too, highlighted with golden streaks where the sun had left its mark there. The texture looked different. Like it had gotten coarser. Tony studied it, not feeling Josh’s hand finally brush up against his crotch. He studied it like he studied any problem. And it was a problem. For him, anyway. Because he wanted to feel it again--or for the first time, maybe--to see what it felt like now. If it felt different. If it slipped through his hand with silky ease like it used to, or if it felt foreign and strange against the thin, sensitive skin between his fingers.
Sir Purr spent the evening trying very hard to stay out of the clutches of the gaggle of Barton children who had all decided he was far too snuggly to be allowed to walk around on his own.  He hid under tables, chairs, and even climbed a tree once before finally giving in and just resigning himself to a night of being petted and packed by Clint’s kids.
“Don’t be like that.”
Steve nodded.  He’d like to see Christmas in New York again.  It would be a warm memory to take with him.  “Agreed.”
“My pleasure.”  And between the two of them, they managed quite nicely.
“Okay.”
Steve smiled at him, puzzled.  “That’s kind of a silly question.”
--but he couldn’t go back there yet.
Tony looked up at Strange again helplessly, but he shook his head.  The sorcerer was staring at the couple on the bed intently, his own breath coming hard and fast.
And then there was the man himself.  He was asleep alone in the big bed, and while he was sleeping more on the right side, his hand was outstretched toward the left, reaching even in his sleep to where she would ordinarily be.
Steve sat patiently waiting in his chair outside the door.  He had his hands folded in his lap, his eyes steadfastly on them as Tony entered the room.
Steve sat up and looked at his friend.  And he
Steve took one more long drag on his smoke, then stubbed it out on the side of the building. He flicked the butt into the gutter, leaning into Tony a little to do it. Tony didn’t move back. He moved deliberately with him instead, keeping close, as close as he could without actually pressing up against him. The only point of contact was the hand on Steve’s arm. It stayed, tightened a bit, his thumb slipping along the scuffed leather.
worth it. I promise I’ll make everything you’ve done worth it.”
What he was sure about was the off-feeling this was giving him.  He’d been in the hole before since coming here--the time Tony had witnessed wasn’t the first scuffle he’d gotten into, just the worst one--and it never ended like this.  They never called him “Captain” or “Sir”.  There’d never been the sober face under the cap.  Steve had gotten a bit friendly with a couple of the older guards, and there was usually just a jingle of keys, and a good-natured, “Up and at ‘em, kid.  Back to the herd.”
“Do you?  I don’t believe I’ve ever witnessed that.”
Anger and distress flared in Steve’s chest, but he tamped them both down. “Are you okay?” he asked gently. “He didn’t hurt you?”
“You’re doing it again.”
“I knew there was something I liked about you, Doc,” Tony said.  He was impressed.  When he thought about it, it was impressive.  Strange was still a prick, but Tony had seen him in action.  It was easy to forget that the man sitting in front of him here was the same one who had fought alongside him on Titan.  He had been impressed then, and he was impressed now.  “Tell me what we’re doing, Sorcerer.”
And he wouldn’t. But he had to try and get rid of some of the
Steve nuzzled into his palm.  “It was always there, Tony.”
fucking long--and he had missed them. Missed this. This sweetness and comfort. This feeling of home and family. He’d missed it. A lot.
“How are you going to make it up to me?” he asked.
Nick let out a breath. It was disgruntled and tired. Steve smiled. It was not the first time he had heard that sound. He’d known Nick Fury for a lot of years--remembered following him around as a kid, trying to stay out of his way while at the same time, trying to keep up with him--and that sound had become so ingrained into Steve’s heart, that he couldn't
“Yeah,” Tony answered, running a finger along Steve’s sharp jawline.
“Do you want to watch something?” Steve asked as he came into the living room.
Steve took a step. “Okay,” he relented. “Nice. And hot.”
Steve pressed his fingers into Tony’s hip, squeezing him gently but firmly. “Put Morgan to bed,” he whispered, and his voice was filled with a dark heat.
Steve’s eyes widened. “What?”
She insisted she’d been kidding about the shoes, but he did pay for lunch.  They went to the Four Seasons and scarfed down course after course of food that was far too rich for two o’clock in the afternoon, but Tony kept it coming.  Things were always better with a belly full of Porterhouse and butter-poached tiger prawns.
“Keep it to yourself, Stark.”
Tony smiled indulgently, and ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. “I’m gonna move, ‘kay?” he said. Steve held his hand tighter, uttering a quiet hum of dissent.
"She won't say anything."
“Yes.” She squeezed his hand and looked past his shoulder to where Tony was flipping pages idly. “You were right, having him stay. I’m proud of you for that, but next time--if there is a next time--call me and tell me what’s happening. I don’t care what time it is. Or what I’m doing. Or what
“I know, but...nobody?  Not even some nice,” he swallowed past a small blockage in his throat, “private from the Buckeye State or something?  A one-nighter?”
“That’s what they tell me,” Steve said softly.  He propped himself up on his forearms, relieving some of the pressure on Tony’s chest.  Tony wasn’t sure how he felt about that.  He kissed Tony’s mouth thoroughly.  “Can I move now?” Steve asked.  “Or am I supposed to be your human blanket all night?”
waitress said. She waited on them every week.
“Especially in public,” Steve went on.  “That old lady in the grocery store yesterday was about a second away from whacking me over the head with her cane.”
“Please,” he said.  “It will really be okay.”
friends. Not the ones who used to act like they were friends and now ignored him or avoided him at every single turn, even going so far as to skip family dinners and movie nights just so they wouldn’t have to run into him. No.
Steve stopped walking and turned to him. He was dressed very simply tonight. Just a white t-shirt and faded denim, but Tony thought he was absolutely stunning. Maybe even better than this morning. It reminded him a little of that night on the roof when he’d caught him skinny-dipping, and if he hadn’t been so upset, he might have tried to jump him right there, but he
"You got it.  That goes in the never-joke-about-it-again file, 'kay?"
Steve tugged his hand. “Come in. Stay here.”
Tony smiled, resigned, hurt, and terribly sad.  “Sure it is, Cap.  Wherever you want.”  He started to walk away, then stopped cold when Steve spoke.
He looked at Steve now, and sat up straighter, faint worry driving away most of the happiness.  He was pinching the bridge of his nose, his brow furrowed, those three lines between them.
Steve just held him tighter.
Steve thought back to his first time shipping out. How he’d felt saying goodbye to Sarah and Sam at the bus station. He nodded. “Yeah. I do know.”
“Please what, Steve?” he asked, dipping his head to nuzzle at Steve’s nipple. He let his tongue run across it, and Steve arched his back to give him fuller access. “Tell me what you need.”
“I’m not going anywhere.”
Steve glanced at his watch. 5:55. He looked at the bus. The other soldiers hugging and kissing their loved ones. Saying good-bye. “I gotta go,” he said, and Morgan started to cry, clutching him extra-tight.
you try?”
“That’s a little better,” she said, and Bruce smiled at him over the top of Nat’s head.  Tony felt ten feet tall after that.
But he’d try.
A warm glow lit in his chest and he welcomed it.  After hearing what Steve had went through the last three months, he needed a little warmth.
“Take
better, right?  I’m not hurting you, am I?”
“Here, boy,” she shouted.
He opened his mouth.  He didn’t know what he was going to say, just that Tony was looking at him with shining eyes, waiting for him to speak, waiting for him to say
.  Steve had toured the cabin, wheeling easily through the lower level, looking at the stone fireplace, the rough-hewn mantle, the butcher-block counters in the kitchen.  He’d smiled at the avocado green appliances--old but still in pristine condition--with Tony’s stainless-steel espresso maker cozied up next to them.  It should have felt anachronistic, but somehow it didn’t.  Somehow, it felt just right.
“Sergeant!”
“What do you mean?”
“You’re welcome.  If there’s anything else, I’ll be right over there.”
” Steve insisted. “I don’t. I’m fine. It’s fine. Sam’s just-” he delivered a sharp kick to Sam’s ankle under the table, making him wince, “-being the way he is.”
“I’m not with anybody.”
“Maybe,” Tony said evenly.  “Maybe that was some of it, but we would have given up some of the stuff to have him around more.  My mother, especially.”
“Well, what?”
Tony didn’t think even Stephen Strange could match the look of disdain that crossed Thaddeus Ross’ features.  “We had an appointment?” he said.  “January thirtieth.  Eight a.m.”
He wondered now how much her objection to Tony being part of the Avengers had to do with the danger, and how much had to do with
He shuddered atop him, saying his name over and over and over again while Tony lay breathless beneath him.  Tony wanted to pull him close, but he had no strength left in his arms.  He was weak as a kitten, high on endorphins and the nearness of his best guy who would never hurt him, never lie to him, never make him wait.  The potency of that hit him, and he breathed deeply, waiting for his heart to slow down or simply explode in his chest.
“Yes, sweetie?”
“Who’s this?” her voice curious.  Expectant.
“Is this okay?” Tony asked.  “I mean, are we people who cuddle?  I’m not crossing a line, am I ?”
He mumbled something else.  Something that sounded very much like “MMmphhrmmm.”  Natasha rolled her eyes.
“Fuck.”
Howard held his hand tightly, cocked his head a little. “You know, someday I’m going to ask you to call me Howard.”
Tony took the keys from his pocket and held them up.  “Do you want to drive?”
Most of the others popped off soon after.  There were still a few stragglers, though.  Stephen Strange and Happy were playing a mellow game of chess while Pepper and May lounged near the fire watching.  Scott picked out a quiet tune on the piano while Hope sat beside him, her head on his shoulder.
Steve turned to him. Tony wasn’t crying, but his face was very pale. His eyes even darker in the gloom. “I’m not going to stop loving you either,” Steve said. His lip was trembling. He had always been the more emotional of the two of them. Tony could keep it in check. Steve never could. But he tried. Right now, he tried very hard. “I’ll always love you. I’ll love you forever.” He knew he shouldn’t--fucking
He closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall as the elevator began to move.  It was as he’d feared.  He’d lost the privilege of talking to FRIDAY.  He was back to the factory settings.  It hurt his heart more than he had expected it to, and he was speaking even before he realized he’d meant to.
Steve’s eyes gleamed.  “What does it do now?”
“What did you mean?”
“Yes, it is.”
“I never lie about orgasms, Steve.”
Tony seemed to realize how pissed off he was, and moved closer.  "Come on, baby," he said. "Don't be like that." He kissed his neck, thumbed his nipple just the way Steve liked.  "I think it's sexy."
Thanks for reading! Next chapter will be up in a few days. We're almost done with the high school portion of this story. Couple more chapters, then we transition into some of the adulthood stuff.
“‘Kay.  I love you.”
Tony’s head snapped up at that voice, then fell back, eyes rolling. Great. Of course. Just keep piling straws on, universe. I can take it. “What are
“Yeah.  Your kids are a bunch of rowdy drunks.”
Steve’s look turned coy.  God, he could flip that on and off like a switch.  It made Tony a little dizzy sometimes.  He never knew what he was going to get when it came to Steve.  He loved that.  It was infuriating sometimes, but he loved it.
He’d been going to therapy for years, he’d said.  Twice a week, he’d said.  He had the courage and strength to lay himself bare time and time again and still come home happy and smiling.  It took a bravery Steve deeply admired, and the very thought that it was Tony doing it--
“Sorry it’s so late.”
them.
Tony looked back at him, understanding darkening his eyes. “How do you know that?”
He came into the kitchen, and directly into Steve’s arms. He buried his face in his chest, his hands lacing together at the small of his back. “Thank you for today,” he said, squeezing him tighter. “It was…”
“Steve, will--”
“Wanda--”
The smile. God. The smile was back. The real one. The one Tony craved above all others. The one that Steve saved for him. Just him. Like he was looking at his favorite thing in the entire world. “‘Kay,” Steve said “See you at breakfast?”
“Chicago.”
Beside him, Bucky made an exaggerated show of clearing his throat, and Steve rolled his eyes again at Natasha. She laughed. “Nat,” Steve said, “this is Bucky. Bucky, Natasha.”
Tony shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Maybe he
He laughed. “You started it.”
Tony lay back and tugged on Steve’s t-shirt until he was hovering above him. “That’s the way it has to be.” He put his hand on Steve’s waist, under his shirt to feel his skin, his soft, sweet, familiar skin.
Steve inched closer to Tony, wishing deeply and drastically that he could just scoop him up in his arms and kiss him senseless right out here in the open for everyone to see. But the thought didn’t bring too much hurt with it right now. He was feeling too good. He was sitting here with his best friend, and his boyfriend, and the sun was shining, and they were all laughing. It felt too good. It felt like what he wanted for the rest of his life.
“Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like if I’d met you then,” Steve said.
They both said they were sorry again. Said they’d see each other tomorrow. When Tony hung up, he just sat looking at his phone. It was five o’clock. The guy would be here soon, and the meeting would last at least a couple of hours, then he’d have to make sure the guy got to his hotel room and was set for the night. That meant he would miss the movie completely. The movie Steve was supposed to keep him awake for. But if Tony wasn’t there, who would keep
Tony kicked his feet up on the railing and looked up at the stars.  They seemed closer here than they did in the city.  Bigger.  Brighter.  Strange to think he’d been among them once.  Strange to think he’d stood atop one.  Strange how things that seemed so untouchable could one day rest in the palm of your hand.  But how did you keep it?  Hamlet could go fuck himself with that “To be or not to be” shit.  How did you keep the untouchable thing you now held?
Tony was right--the lasagna was fantastic.
Sarah patted Steve’s back. “I’ll go tell Tony to get another plate,” she said, pulled him gently down to kiss his cheek, then left.
miles per hour--to do that. But then he’d have to deal with all kinds of paradoxes and time-travel issues…”
“FRIDAY, lock down the training room, ‘kay?” Tony said, then gave Steve a little squeeze.  “None of this is your fault, Steve.  You know, I
Steve gripped the doorframe.  He had to.  He had to have an anchor.  If he didn’t, there would have been nothing to stop him from crossing the room and dropping to his knees in front of Tony.  Nothing to stop him from pressing his forehead into his lap and releasing a non-stop litany of apologies and promises and pleas for forgiveness.  All the old feelings of desire and love and need rose up in him, tearing through his carefully made defenses like the flood that follows a tsunami.  They cared nothing for his new-found “balance”.  Tony was here.  Tony was
Steve threw a dish towel in his face.
“Steve?” he called from the bed, eyes still closed, and listened. Nobody answered, but a second later, he heard a little clicking sound that he couldn’t
“No. Steve, baby, it was just right.” Tony pulled back and touched Steve’s cheek, brushed over his beard. His eyes were wide, dark, those same bad eyes that Steve had fallen in love with over twenty years ago. Slowly, he slipped one arm up around Steve’s neck and drew him downward until their lips met. It was soft. Sweet. “Thank you.”
He scowled, and she held his arm, pressed her mouth to his shoulder.  “It’s okay,” she said.
But they were headed inside now, climbing the narrow stairs, Steve going first because there was no way those broad shoulders would allow for Tony to walk beside him, and they went up the first flight, then the second, then the third.
And the world was immediately a better place.
He thought Tony might know it too.
“But-”
The fairy lights were still on, still twinkling in the darkness as Tony walked down to the lake.  He turned west at the shoreline and didn’t have to go very far before he saw a silhouette against the setting moon.  Even in the darkness, he knew who it was.  He’d know the line of those shoulders anywhere.
On the ground between them, Steve made a choked, strangled sound.  His eyelids fluttered, his shoulders heaved with effort.  Bucky leaned down, supporting himself on his metal arm, the other holding Steve’s hand.  “Steve?”
“No.”
She gave him her own version of Steve;s half-smile.  It was achingly familiar and the best thing he’d seen all day.  “I love you, too, Tony.”
“All right, so we have…” Tony counted the
He crawled back into bed, bringing his phone and drawing pad with him. He opened his phone, the missed calls were both from Tony. One of the messages was from his best friend Bucky telling him to not forget to RSVP to his wedding, since he was the best man after all.
Steve passed him a cup of coffee as Tony propped himself up on the counter.
He looked back down at his phone and continued reading.
“I think our work here is done,” he grinned.
NEW -- Epilogue!!! Next chapter :)
After Thor gave him his next task he weaved his way back towards Steve and Jane. Jane had just about finished folding all the grocery bags, storing them in a nearby bin.
"Yeah..."
“Um….wow” Tony tried to swallow the rising feelings he had worked so hard to bury.
, retreating behind his all too familiar
. He turned back to the table and started thinking of ways to excuse himself.
“Ye-yeah.” He was able to sputter out, nodding.
NEW -- Epilogue!!! Next chapter :)
regretting it as soon as the world started spinning again.
“Here let me pay.” Tony said grabbing the check the waitress had just left on their table.
Steve stopped running, staring at Tony a beat before dropping to his butt and laying down, chest up, on the grass.  After a moment he could hear the grass flatten underneath Tony’s nearing footsteps. Out of the corner of his eyes he could see when Tony had reached arm distance, but he kept his gaze focused on the clouds above him.
“Wait.” Tony interrupted. “You guys can’t make pie.”
Carefully, Steve began to read the beautiful handwritten engravings on the box, a smile tugging on his face and something else tugging on his heart.
. I want to make sure you are kept updated on everything and vice versa." She finally said. "Rhodey said you went into the lab the other day?"
He shook the idea out of his head.
Tony let his smile show this time as he wrote his name down on the guest list. “Can I bring a friend?” Tony asked as he finished writing the K. “Or two actually?” He said looking up at a wide eyed Steve.
. It works. It does what it's supposed to." Steve said, trying his best to sound offended.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I called you? Who are you?” Tony asked, carefully propping himself up on his elbows.
Steve looked down at the picture he received.
“Hey, before, when I said I can’t believe we're still in the parking lot or whatever, I didn’t mean it like in a bad way. I meant it like in a ‘
“Oh and I’m his ride so I really must be leaving too.” Tony feigned disappoint as he too got up.
“Uh-” Steve tried to re-focus his mind.
“Here.” He said passing it to Tony, whose face color resembled his own. “Do you like it?”
! It would mean a lot if you could check out the articles and let me know what you think about them.
“I mean… If you don’t want to make pie that’s fine.” Steve asked getting up from the couch, Pinocchio forgotten.
“I have it locked. The only thing he can do is take more pictures and make a fun video to watch later.” Tony explained to the worried Steve. Steve who had a baby tiger and liliger curled up on his lap. Tony had to remind himself that he had already taken about a thousand photos of Steve like this and that he didn’t need to rip his phone from the monkey’s hand to take one more.
“Nat. No I forbid you from doing that! Jemma will you stop looking everywhere he’s not hiding in my closet.” Steve said, god it felt like he was an elementary school teacher.
“Yes. I am aware. My magazine has covered a couple of those.” Steve mused.
“Tony, your address remember? You were going to tell me where you lived?” Steve asked again, as gently as he could. He had already been driving for about five minutes and he had no idea where he was going.
"Rogers get up here!" Fury's yell is what finally broke Steve out of his mental spiel.
Eventually Tony was able to coax Steve to sit back down. He rehearsed his speech as he picked at his pie, anxiously watching Steve’s every move.
He quickly ran back to his room and opened his tiny closet. His brain simply yelled "
Steve was going to kill them. All of them. Starting with the guy holding him in place.
Tony, head unmoving, mouth still glued shut, glanced at Steve.
"Tony who cares about the press." She chided back and was met with a scoff.
“I said,” Sam told Steve, widening his eyes for emphasis, “that’s a cool phone dude. Where did you get it?” He pronounced each word carefully and slowly.
“Yeah,”
"They are so perfect for each other too! They're opposites that balance each other out beautifully." Another worker said. They were all huddled around a computer. Steve refilled the paper cup for the third time, vaguely listening to them.
Tony rolled his eyes, “not strippers or anything.”
Well. Here I am. Writing more.
Steve was still trying to get his mouth to form an actual sentence when the waitress arrived with their food. Tony solemnly handed Steve his phones.

, he thought as he pulled out his phone,
“Oh, and you know what I want, huh!? What void, exactly, do you think I’m filling Rogers?” Tony’s voice was rising in anger, he had come here to hang out with his neighbor, the man who had become his best friend, not be attacked by him.
“Wait- hold on a second I’m still processing.” Sam said lifting a finger in the air. “You actually
An hour later he was sat across Coulson, his fingers fidgeting nervously as Coulson flipped through the pages. Coulson would stop and look up every few seconds, his face totally unreadable.

“So Steve if you ever wanted to do an interview with Stark in person, instead of on the phone, I can be your new in.” Jemma beamed at him from across the table.
Steve tried to ignore the internal screaming going on in his head and said, “oh and you got breakfast last time, so technically it is my turn to pay, so ha.” He quickly closed his mouth hoping whatever words just came out of it had made sense. Apparently they did because Tony let out a small laugh and said okay.

“You have a great group of friends here.” Tony said as he took the seat next to Steve.
"Wow, bed by 9:30? You crazy daredevil." Tony smirked into the phone, pointedly ignoring the part about Steve forgetting all about him.

“Soo…” Steve drawled out, hoping to break the awkward silence he had started.
“That’s not what it said in the report you gave to Fury.” Sam eyed him as he grabbed another handful of fries.
“Hey Mr. and Mrs. Odenson-Foster, are you guys just going to eat all my food or are you planning on getting your own at some point?”
My beloved Steve. I look at your handsome face… into your clear, azure eyes… and—” His jaw clenched, breath shaky— “Four years ago, I broke into your apartment looking for a place to hide. Instead of kicking me out, you listened to my story. I should have known it then. That you were the one I would want to spend the rest of my life with. The one I would never run away from. You’re an old soul— in a smoking
A knock is what finally broke Tony’s gaze from his computer screen.
“Really?” Tony’s voice hyped up, right before breaking again. “I-I don’t deserve to have such-I’m monster aren't I? So-so selfish. I'm so shellfish. I don't deserve the starfish. Patrick. Patrick. I’m not a good Spongebob.” Tony said, water in his eyes once again as he continued looking up.
I made for this story! Anyways, while uploading I reread and edited the past chapters. Nothing too big or story changing (since I’m doing that for the
“...We should make pie though.” Tony started again, carefully redirecting the subject.
"Tony!" Steve answered frantically.
“How was the doctor's visit? Are you feeling okay? It’s a girl? It’s a girl right? Do you want water? I saved you some fries.” The two girls rambled and spoke over one another following Jane as she went over to their table.
“Okay well first of all, that was once, and no one was injured. And I am going to be the one to plan your party, he’s just going to help me think of stuff. Buck, if I’m left all alone to do this then it’s going to be very boring and simple.”
“You gonna come in buddy? Or did you decide that that’s your new favorite place?” Tony heard Steve laugh from behind the door.
He assured himself, as he watched Steve turn to him, face bright and grinning.
“So?...Do you like it?” Steve asked eyeing Tony, who was still intently staring at the key like nothing else in the world existed.
“Hi.” Tony sat on the floor. Steve kneeling beside him.
“We’ll have a large popcorn and soda, coke, easy ice.” Tony told the worker when it was his turn to order. “Large so we can share.” He then explained to Steve.
“It’s a surprise party of one. ME. Naked. We need to celebrate our sex more often. With balloons and streamers.”
“What kind of a guest would I be if I arrived without presents?” Tony asked as he carefully settled the last tray of lasagna into the back seat of Steve’s car, careful not to slam the car door as he closed it.
"I am, right?"
“Umm..you comforted me.” Steve scratched the back of his head, refusing eye contact.
“God!” Tony yelled in a drunk excitement.
Steve was an artist, he explained to himself, he just drew stuff, it didn’t mean anything to him. Those drawings had just been exercises to keep himself awake while he made sure his sorry ass didn’t try to fly out any more windows with magic towels. The towel. He made a mental note to send Steve new towels, the good ones, the same he had in his bathroom. He risked a glance towards Steve. He was still staring at him.
, Tony was screaming in his head, maintaining a wide grin on his face, while he watched Steve set the box on the table and begin to open it.
“Okay that was one time, she was apparently a
Tony processed the story for a few seconds. “How? How could I not remember any of this? How could this have not come up before? That was like
Harley shrugged, but Peter cut in before he could say anything. “Wow! You're a mechanic? What’s a mechanic?”
Tony stepped back. Eyebrow quirked. “What surprise party?”
Several minutes later he strolled into the kitchen, towel wrapped around his waist -- no not
“I like eating popcorn while watching a movie.” Steve replied with a smile and shoulder shrug.
“What are you talking about?” Tony asked slowly.
"You are a good Spongebob!" Steve desperately yelled over Tony's frantic burst.
“You. Keep trying to stand in front of me.” Steve pushed himself in front of Tony. “So that when we get to the front of the line you can pay.”
"Yeah. I could tell you aren't a tech savvy person by your phone." Tony teased, trying to change the subject. "Which reminds me," his eyes lit up as he reached behind the seats.
“Starless!” He yelled again at his phone, confused as to why Jarvis wasn’t answering.
“Jarvis
“Okay Tony, we should go-” Steve said proud of himself for getting the nerve to talk and stand up. Only, of course to be pulled down to the sofa by Jane.
“I’m just playing,” Tony laughed, unable to control himself, there was something exhilarating about the way he was able to make the tall, built, man next to him flustered and stutter and go red.
“Are you finished talking? Because you have no idea how hard it was to keep myself from closing this short distance between us,” Steve stared into Tony’s eyes as he took a step towards him, chests touching now, “and cutting you off with a kiss, but I didn’t want to interrupt you, I liked what you were saying and I wanted to let you finish, let you express yourself and all that. But, if you’re done, I would really like to kiss you, if that’s okay.”
“Well we were already planning on meeting Saturday so I can give you back your stuff right?” Tony said as they came to a stop light, turning to face the man completely.
By now they were close enough to the tickets booth to grab a flyer of today's attractions.
Steve looked back at the zoo, the lights were starting to dim as the last few patrons were exiting.
Steve glanced around the apartment, wishing his eyes would adjust to the darkness quicker. No doubt Nat or Clint were hidden somewhere with Night Vision cameras. Waiting to capture him fumble around his apartment and freak out once everyone jumped out. Steve tried his best to walk to Tony with ease and confidence, evading his table, chairs, side tables, lamp, sofas and coffee table with such precision he knew his military officers would have been impressed. He couldn’t help the cocky grin that appeared on his face once he reached Tony.
“Hey everybody, how’s he doing?”
“And did he get one?” Peter stopped spinning to think. Hm, what had they actually achieved that day?
Steve’s mans is going to love you! Or ask for your autograph or something.” Most people did, even though Tony Stark was notorious for signing anything other than his name on paper. “if anything, it’s me who should be worrying!”
It was then that Peter realized this kind of faux-press wouldn’t settle right with cap. Especially if he was dating someone. I mean, Steve could brush off dating rumors like the best of them could, but clearly he was shook by this one, and it had to be because his new partner wouldn’t love the new scoop. He felt bad about laughing, or even pointing it out at all.
Peter laughed, and backed out of that particular spar as Bruce had to talk Thor off a very precarious shopping cliff. On the other end of the aisle, Natasha, Clint, and Steve were having an otherwise frugal attempt at conversation.
Steve Rogers leant over his dad’s bed, one strong hand wrapped around Tony’s. Peter smiled at that. Who would have thought that the people whose most common mode of communication a few years back was bickering, would be comforting one another in a moment of hurt. It made Peter proud of what they had, and infinitely grateful to have some small part in it. He watched as Tony stirred slightly, blinking through an exhaustion that clearly had control over his body otherwise, until he noticed he wasn’t alone in the room. Steve smiled broadly, a tangible sense of relief flooding his system and that’s when Peter’s small moment of content did a back hand-spring out the nearest window.
the great things Tony had done—he’d written about most of it—and that while Tony had gone through some hiccups, so had everybody else! What mattered was that Tony was trying his hardest to be a good person—a good... Spongebob. For some reason though, all of these words got stuck in Steve’s throat and he just continued to stare at the hurt Tony.
“Hey” peter motioned for his companions to look, “It’s Steve!”
Peter smiled at that softly, and made it as far as the hallway door before he thought to ask, “can I go in?” What if his dad was like… undergoing surgery, or surrounded by doctors and not needing his kid to mess with the room.
And true to his word, it did. It said ‘smash’ in big comic book letters, and they had even gotten the right shade of purple for the Hulk’s pants that had appeared in the battle of New York. Behind him, he heard Bruce sigh, with the faint remnants of a blush slowly appearing on his cheeks.
"Look all I know is that Bucky has been texting me nonstop this weekend to harass you at work to get on it. As for the why... you'll have to take that up with Nat yourself."
just buy you a new car if I did.” Tony smirked sliding into the passenger side, this all felt strangely familiar to him.
"Hey I hope I didn't wa-" Steve turned to face his alarm clock, 3:43 am.
"Cherries... Now I'm gonna tie the stem into a knot."
“Hmm?” Tony hummed back, slowly bringing himself to the present and away from his memories from months ago. They were once again on the couch (Tony hadn’t trusted himself for the bedroom), a Doritos bag was open in front of him and apparently the credits were rolling for the movie. Tony was pretty proud that this time he had managed to stare off into space instead of Steve’s face, thus making him look less like a creepy friend.
"Oh, I know who you are" Steve expressed with a fondness Tony rarely got.
While these characters are my original babies, it doesn't mean they don't share a lot with their inspirations. Plus if you loved the awkwardness and giddiness of IHP, you will get a lot of that here too! Also, Terry works in a startup and Matty is a veteran. Also, they bake pies.
"Your such a good... sponge...bob." Tony looked up at Steve with eyes of admiration as Steve carefully wiped his mouth with a wet cloth.
“Little engineers they are.” She took a second. “You two should go talk to them. I’ll give you a minute to talk about it.” She smiled at them, hopeful, before leaving to talk to another couple.
sleep? Were you...have you?
, he thought as he continued staring at his alarm clock, watching as the five flipped to a six.
“You have a brother.” Sam reminded him.
“Where- where am I?” Tony asked, squinting at the sun blasting in through the window.
Steve considered this, wondering how Bucky would take to it. He looked at the bright mirth and hope in Tony’s eyes. This was all so resemblant to when Tony gave him the phone. Steve was scared of ruining it again.
He cupped Steve’s chin and pulled him up into a kiss. He could feel Steve grin as their kiss deepened. It was one of his favorite feelings in the world. But as much as he wanted to experience some of his other favorite things in the world (for the third time in a row) there was a voice in his head trying to remind him of…
Steve’s eyes were glued on Tony—the man that everybody envied—looking so broken in front of him. He wanted to comfort him, let him know that nobody was really perfect. Sure, Tony came off as vain and selfish, but anybody who did their homework would know how selfless he really was. He wanted to tell him that
“What are you guys doing here!?” Steve asked in distress as the new couple joined the one already there. They were all making themselves at home already.
“I haven’t seen any lady suitors sneaking out of your apartment lately...” Steve glanced up at Tony. They were halfway through the Pinocchio movie, Steve slouched down on the sofa, head resting on Tony’s arm behind him, feet resting on his little old coffee table in front of them.
If you want a sneak peek at the next chapter,
“Look at all the stars. They’re so bright.” Tony stopped walking as he looked at the dazzling night sky.
So what do u think???
“Hey, Tony, you tell me where you are and I’ll take you to this really nice hill and we can watch the stars all night. How about that?”
“I don’t know! I thought you remembered… that that’s why you’ve been buying pie, because we suck at making it ourselves!” Steve replied, equally frustrated.
Monday night.” Sam said making kissy faces at his computer as he kept typing.
"You sure you can't pull down the snake yourself?" Steve looked up, miserable, he should be getting some sort of medal for this, his morals and self-control being tested so cruelly.
“You’ve got this.” Thor grinned. “What could go wrong?” He clasped Tony by the shoulder. It only helped amplify Tony’s nerves.
“What, you're giving up already?” Said Tony as he tried to even out his breathing.
"How are you?" She finally asked, no longer sounding like a C.E.O, but rather a concerned friend.
there if you're interested, or at least want to check out the
He had spent about an hour trying to decide what to wear for when the great Tony Stark arrived to drop off his clothes. He was doing this of course because as a journalist he wanted to look professional among such a great businessman and innovator. That was totally the only reason why he cared so much about how he looked. But what was he supposed to wear for going out for breakfast with Tony? For appearances of course. No other reason, other than PR and, well you know, not wanting to make a fool of himself in front of Stark.
Steve stretched as he got up. Tony watched, admiring the way Steve’s muscles rippled in his back as he did so.
“yeah, I’m game if Steve is.”
(still working on figuring this one out, more like short one shots/poetry type format). I also recently started writing on
“Tony!” Steve yelped getting out of the car and rushing towards him.
You're probably aware that many people on AO3, myself included, wish that they could leave a kudos more than once! Well on Medium you can “clap” as many times as you want. I wrote an article on my thoughts about that! I would also love to hear your thoughts about it, do you wish AO3 had something similar? The other article is about my reflections on my first story, advice for readers and writers, and my thoughts on the
“Here give it.” Tony broke Steve out of his thoughts and he handed him the phone. After a few swipes and clicks Tony started reading the message out loud. “
A smile came from the memory.
“No something romantic!” Jemma countered.
This wasn't one of those mornings. He wasn’t there.
"Bruce and Rhodey?"
“When was this decided?” Thor asked, looking at Tony.
“Hmm?” Steve replied.
"Steve! Get a hold of yourself." Steve whispered to himself, eyes refusing to stop examining Tony's body.
Leave it in??
“I am a big fan of shower sex.” Tony nodded,
"Oh my GAWD they are soooo cute together, it hurts." Steve could hear some of his co-workers chatting.
” in his head.
“I hear you like roses.” Jane slowly dictated, “so here's a polar coordinate graph of r  = 1+cos(theta).”
He looked at the phone again moving his arm closer and further from his face until his phone looked the least blurry. He hit the green button—that he hoped meant call—twice: redial.
“Um.” Tony said glancing over at Steve, who opened his mouth but was cut off by Jane’s voice.
“Who cares about the movie. I’ll run ahead and explain everything to the workers.” Steve said stepping away from the car, getting ready to run back to the main entrance.
Tony's face went from eagerly impatient to genuinely confused to just plain pink shaded embarrassed.
“Yup. See ya buddy.” Tony said settling back into his chair. He threw a sideways glance and saw Steve picking up the menu,
“Language.” Tony teased, before pulling his fiancé in for another kiss. Fiancé. Tony liked the sound of that.
“We broke so many things. Left your place trashed.”
“So you want to have sex in a living room filled with balloons and—” he turned to look once again, “streamers and… did you add photos?” He stepped away from Tony to get a better look at them. The ones closest to him were from a couple of months before they started dating. Those hapless 'I can't believe we were both so damn oblivious and dumb and so obviously in love" months before they finally kissed. His grin grew as memories flooded back with each picture.
“It’s mine now. The gift. You aren’t gonna get it back no matter how much you ask. I’m going to treasure it forever.” He said leaning firmly back in his chair, hugging the gift tightly.
Thank you to everyone who has read, kudosed and commented on this story. This was always meant to be a short story, so I think I’ll stop here (though I also said that four years ago...) (who knows I may write another separate story that continues where this one left off? Thoughts?) The proposal was daunting to write because it was my first one (this story has a lot of writing firsts for me) it has a few canon sentences parsed in too (just google Stony quotes). Let me know your thoughts on it! Also, in it Tony mentions breaking in, this is new backstory that I’m writing into
I'm planning on doing one more chapter, at least, were they actually get together. ;) pls let me know if you guys like it so far, do the flashbacks make it hard to follow? :(
Steve furrowed his eyebrows, who the hell was that? He clicked the notification box and was surprised when his and Tony's old messages opened up. He smiled as the whole thing was very Tony-y and scrolled down to read the new messages.
“It’s not a towel.”
“Yay!” Tony let out quietly and excitedly as he stepped in front of Steve in line.
“Besides. The lights are off and those thick blinds are drawn. No one can see us. It probably looks like no one’s even home.” He glared up at Steve. He had been anxiously standing in the dark long enough before Steve arrived for his eyes to have fully adjusted. He could see Steve’s confusion, but he didn’t understand it. Yes. They had mainly stuck to the bedroom when they had sex in Steve’s apartment. But they’d had living room sex in Tony’s before. They had had sex just about everywhere in Tony's apartment. What was the big deal? Maybe he was worried about making a mess? Or breaking things? “Come on.” He said, reaching up to cup Steve’s neck. “We can make our way to your room. Love your bed anyways.” He went to kiss and nibble Steve’s neck, ear, jaw, and cheek. When he finally got to Steve’s mouth Steve mumbled out a few words. “What?”
“Told you. I keep my promises.” Steve smiled. He felt Tony shuffle next to him, so he turned his head to face him. Tony was now laying on his side facing him, head resting on his arm.
"But the latest Stark model just hit the shelves." She scrunched her eyebrows.
A second later he received Tony’s response.
“Okay. So. Zoo?” Tony said reversing out of his parkspace.
“To as many years as we can get.” Tony tried again. Somehow 3,000 sounded more romantic.
Tony could feel the worry over the phone.
Steve got up and dug through the gift box. He pulled out a small leather notebook and flipped it open.
Jemma nodded her head, “it’s definitely a one of a kind model. I’ve never seen another phone like that, this morning, after I got hired, they showed me the new tech releases and that phone wasn’t in there.”
Tony was wearing a dark green dress shirt, barely visible behind his dark grey blazer, and black dress pants. They both swallowed hard, too busy trying to hide the looks on their faces to notice the others.
“Um the first one was me out in the middle of the street, staring into what I assume are headlights. I look like a scared deer.” Tony said answering Steve’s unspoken question. “Then the other one, which I, I think it’s my favorite drawing ever. We are basically cuddled up on top of your car, above us are all these magnificent bright stars and in front of us the sun is just barely starting to peek out.” Tony’s smile slowly dissipated, “wish I could remember that” he whispered, mainly to himself.
Tony looked back down at him. He missed the hatred, Steve was sure. He was too preoccupied with his own feelings about his father. “You’ll go out there with me, won’t you, baby?” he asked. “You won’t make me go out there by myself?”
Tony nodded.  He didn’t trust himself to speak.  Steve must have understood, because he smiled.  His own little half-smile that reduced Tony to jelly.
“I can’t let it go,” he said in a loud, angry whisper, looking over his shoulder to where Steve and Bruce still lazed along the shoreline.  “Because none of
She reached out and grasped Steve’s hand in her free one. The bus was sitting at the curb, idling in the early-morning dim. Other families crowded around their own departing soldiers, little knots of people hugging and kissing young men and women who all looked excited but nervous, their eyes making darting little glances at the bus and their watches, gauging the last few seconds they had before they were swallowed up inside of it and taken to the airport where they would fly to Georgia.
“No.  I won’t stop.”
“Do you think your value has been lessened?”
But then Tony put his hand on the side of his neck, and he was back. He was steady. He was here.
is different.”
“Mm,” Tony hummed, nodding.  “You’re right.  It’s so much better when my mouth is on you.”
“In July,” Steve said and moved closer to Tony, holding his arm along with his hand.
be with me, Steve?” he asked against his lips. “You?”
“That’s what you get for thinking about somebody else right now.”
Tony placed his finger on the frame of the picture on the wall. His eyes were drawn once again to that black cut-out shadow. “We could talk about this.”
“You didn’t have to get up. It’s still early.”
“That doesn’t feel like a compliment, sir.”
Another kiss...and then another.
“When you’re right, you’re right, Mr. Rogers.”
"But not now?"
“It’s no big deal,” Tony said, his voice quiet, contented.  “I’ve got lots of shirts.”
“It’s not selfish to ask for help when you need it, Steve,” he said, but he couldn’t help the way his heart fell just a little. He'd wondered since it had happened. Wondered a lot. Especially since it still would not have been too late nine months ago. They still could have made it work.
“I almost didn’t recognize you,” Tony said, and now he came closer. His eyes roved over Steve’s face, the beard that covered his cheeks, his body, thinner now than it had been last time they'd seen each other. The cup in his hand trembled just the slightest bit as he looked at him. Steve let him look. He had to. He couldn’t move. He was frozen in place. “My god,” Tony breathed. “What are you doing here?”
“I don’t know,” Tony mused.  “Being good got you into my pants more than a few times.”
"I know. And I'd
“But-”
“Don’t you yell at me, Rogers,” Ross said crossly, but something flickered behind his eyes at the sight of the steel in Steve’s own.
“She is.”
Tony watched Clint go apologize...or whatever. Tony wasn’t a lip-reader. He couldn’t be certain that’s what happened, but he watched him saying something, watched Steve say something back, then watched Clint jump up onto his back and tackle him to the ground while Steve laughed, so whatever had transpired must have been friendly. Tony wasn’t jealous. He wasn’t angry. Or upset at Steve for just
Then Josh was there.

“I’m not.”
with you, Tony?”
Tony lay back on the bed and Steve followed. “Let’s worry about ‘from now on’ later, okay?” he breathed. “Just do what I want right now.”
Tony watched the whole show.  “Is it okay?  It doesn’t taste weird, does it?”
“There was...talk,” Steve said.  “You know how stuff gets around.  Somebody heard from somebody else.  You know.  Like that.”
“Maybe,” Steve agreed, still speaking in that serene way that belied the way his guts were twisting. His heart was shredding. He had to do this. Howard had been right. If he didn’t do this now, he would just be being selfish. “But those other people-”
had said that made Steve laugh like that.
Morning talk and making plans❤️
But...no.

seen Bucky use them, though,” Steve went on, seemingly oblivious to Tony’s intestinal acrobatics. “But that’s something I’d really rather not think about right now. Or ever,” he said stolidly. “Again. If that’s okay with you.”
, you will spend an hour with Doctor Strange so he can assess your physical and mental health.  These visits will be heavily guarded and supervised.”
Steve’s fingers strayed to the button of Tony’s jeans and toyed with it.
“Yeah,” Tony said, and gave him a squeeze. “And since we’re really talking, I’m also going to tell you that I don’t want this to be a one-off thing. And I don’t want it to be just a sex-thing either.”
Steve sighed, put his hands on Tony’s thighs, stroking them, drawing circles on them with his fingertips. “Too much time on my hands,” he said. “Too many sleepless nights. Too much nervous energy.”
“Yes, she was definitely that.”
“It was good,” Steve said.  “I think it was really good.”
“Promise me,” Tony insisted.
As long as she’d known him, as

"Don't you dare tell me you don't want anything," Tony said. "Everybody wants something. What's your something? New car? Private jet? Private
Steve shook his head. “Nah. Just thinking about Mrs. Perkins.”
Tony looked at Sam.  “Where do you stand on this?”
"Pepper--"
“Is that what the Chinese say?”
“I love you.”
The guy extended his hand, but he looked a little nervous. “I’m John Peterson. I’m sorry I’m late. I spoke to a Ms. Potts earlier. She said she’d explain what happened.”
“It wasn’t three copies.”
“It’s good to see you too, Tony,” Sam said, shaking his hand and clapping him on the shoulder.
“Um,” he said quietly. “I’m not sure if making a movie is a very good idea.”
Sam sighed. “We’re way too into this superhero shit,” he said, and Steve gave him a grateful smile. “Although,” he went on, turning his eyes to Tony, “
“You started it.”
Steve brushed his fingers against Tony’s, barely touching him, but feeling it throughout his entire body. “Me too.”
The shower had run for a long time.  A very long time.  It was a good thing they’d washed the dishes right after their quiet little dinner because Steve seemed pretty determined to run the water cold.  Tony didn’t mind.  He’d showered himself earlier while Steve put dinner together, and besides, if his guy wanted to use all the hot water after four months in prison, Tony certainly wasn’t going to stop him.  Hell, he would have carried it up from the lake and boiled it on the stove himself if Steve had so desired.  He would have done anything.  Would
She was silent.  Steve nodded.
“What happened, Tony?  Who did--” He stopped, his eyes going to the razor on the ground by his knee.

Tony stood frozen.
“About you?”
good. Steve swallowed thickly, his tongue feeling too big for his mouth, then shook his head as if trying to clear the image.
They weren’t even all about sex.
“Steve--”
“You’ve been acting a little weird lately.”
“I don’t want to hear about that.”
Tony lay in bed for a minute, listening hard for any indication of where Steve was, but heard nothing.
“Well, now you get to save that tongue for better things,” Tony said, and Steve took him in his arms and used his tongue for better things.
And hot.
“Yeah.”
“No. I’m staying.”
“I won’t give them much,” Tony promised, fingers flying over the keys, inputting his information into the ‘Donate’ section of the site.  “Just a few hundred thousand.”
at Tony. Wouldn’t meet his eyes at all. They went anywhere and everywhere else, bouncing around like a pinball in an old-timey machine, but never quite touching on Tony’s.
Sarah led him into the bathroom and closed the door. She didn’t talk while she got out the scissors, or while she tipped his head from side to side while she used them. She never did. She just concentrated on the task at hand. He knew he could go to a barber and have this done, but he didn’t want to. He liked having her do it for him. It was a small thing, just a tiny ritual that they did, but he liked it. He liked being close to her for these few minutes before he went away for these couple weeks for his summer drill. He knew she liked it too. It always made her cry--he could hear her sniffing every few seconds--but he didn’t mind that. In fact, he kind of liked that too. Knowing she’d miss him. Even if he was only going for a few weeks, she’d still miss him.
The guy, Ray, had squeezed Tony’s shoulder.  “That’s rough, man.  Hope he gets better quick.”
“All night.”

“FRI?” he said.

“Sure thing, Thaddeus.  FRI?  Pull up the Quinjet for me, please.”
Steve smiled guiltily. “Maybe,” he said. “But asking if I was having a sleepover? You put her up to that,” he accused, and Tony laughed darkly against his neck.
Steve sighed, and let his eyes fall closed. He felt guilty now on top of feeling inferior. Ashamed of hurting Tony’s feelings for something he could control no more than Steve could control his own circumstances.
Nat looked back at him.  Touched his arm.  Her face was a mask of anger and sympathy.  “I know,” she said softly.
"I do not," Steve said, and pulled out of Tony.  He was gentle, he always was, and Tony didn't even seem to notice.  That bruised his ego a little. No matter how gentle he was, Tony always
Which one moved first? Was it Tony’s hand that found its way onto Steve’s inner thigh and began to stroke it subtly? Or was it Steve’s lips that brushed against the side of his neck? Softly. Just soft little touches of his mouth? Did it even matter?
“Because
When the elevator opened, Steve got off and went to the door.  Music blared even through the soundproofing.  It must be a cacophony of sound inside.  Tony reveled in it.  Or maybe he didn’t notice it at all.
He gave up. He knew there was no point.

--but there was something about the Hemi-Cuda that spoke to some deep, hidden part of himself.  That loud, dark, somehow feline growl of the engine. The sleek lines. The midnight interior, the horses under the hood.  He loved it. Loved driving it. Loved riding shotgun while Tony was driving it. It felt like the ultimate in both safety and danger at the exact same time.  And that was why he loved it. It called to him. To that duality in his nature that Tony had always seen, always loved, always feared. That safety. That danger.  It was him. And it was Tony, too. Because he was the same. Steve saw that duality in him too. In Tony's arms, he felt safe. In Tony's arms, he felt danger.
“No,” Steve said.  “You won’t.”
“Sometimes stuff like that,” he smiled nervously, ran a hand through his hair, “makes me remember how different I really am.”
“Uh…”
Tony thought Steve laughed a little.  There was certainly a note of humor in his tone when he said, “I’ll crush you.”
“You good?” Tony asked.
Tony shook his head, smiling a little.  “Thanks, Doc.”
“No, just...I was thinking. Maybe this weekend…”
Tony held out his arm.  “Here.  Pinch me.”
“No,” she said. “I’ll just lay there and dwell. I want to go see a movie.”
She took the lapels of his jacket in her hand and looked him squarely in the eye.  “No,” she said.  “I don’t hear from him, but I know where he is.  If you want me to tell you--”
walkie talkies in the bathroom----“
Tony looked up, a faraway thought escaping him as he returned back to Earth from Peter’s comment.
Steve and Tony shared another look, this one more serious. Oscorp was at the center of the city, so if something was gonna blow there it had the potential to uproot the whole city. They both took another beat to look wistfully at each other, and then pushed up weirdly in sync. Peter knew the drill, and yet, still his father called out to him again while he and Cap were leaving. “Stay put until Happy gets here! Stay out of trouble! Pay the check!”
“I know.” Peter confirmed, noticing the little light behind his shoulder that read “7:21”
Tony flipped his welder’s mask up, and made a face like Peter had just said “
Shopping with his family felt like the body builders of the world had collectively decided to dress at a community college’s lost and found. Everybody assumed that if you wore a cap that hid your hair, and a hoodie that did little to hide shape, then you had effectively got one over on the general public. Even Clint and Natasha, who were internationally recognized spies fell into this unfortunate trap of everyday wear as going ‘incognito’. In reality, the only person Peter could typically go a whole day with in public without getting recognized, was Bruce, and even then they had to stick to the parts of town not known for their STEM students.
“Let’s get this bread.” Peter said, as a means of making his presence known.
One that Peter had planned to meet and do his best to make him fall in love with Steve’s stupid little brother/nephew/whatever. He gets that tensions were high and that Tony was as close to the bright white light as anybody would ever like to see him at ever again, but still! Steve Rogers knew better!
Which is exactly what he planned to do. The lab was encased on all walls by glass, so as soon as he reached the corridor, he could see Tony Stark, with a black tank top and a shiny blue light in the center of it, wiring something in the back of a thin wristlet. Hastily Peter punched in his access codes and tore open the door, ready to reboot the kinks in one of the formulas he was reworking.
That was until December 25
But whatever, that’s the kind of adolescence every singer writes about rebelling about. He stumbles to the bathroom to clean up, and then stumbles back out into an eerily quiet kitchen. With two eyes just cracked enough to see the cabinets, he pulls out his cereal and bowl in relative quietness. Most of his family members have rooms with enough distance between them and the kitchen that Peter could stage an elaborate tap dance sequence with an ill-fitting bass drop and only ever wake up JARVIS. But his dad’s room was closer---- and being a man who hated to sit still almost as much as he hated people who called him “Anthony” unironically, Peter elected to ere on the side of caution. Typically, Tony Stark was up and annoying Peter by the break of dawn. He claimed it was because he was, in fact, a morning person (or that he was just a really, really, late owl) but Peter had a sneaky suspicion it had all the more to do with who was awake at the ass crack of dawn. Like clockwork, every weekday morning there Tony was, brewing up something that was so caffeinated it probably surpassed the legal definition of coffee, and asking Peter what his plans were for the day. Even when Peter’s general hatred for all things not past double digits on the clock overtook his otherwise normal personality, Tony Stark was there. It should be noted, that the only person Peter actually believed to be a disgusting “morning person” was Steve, who took his morning jogs next to the paper trucks he was up so early. And Peter didn’t see a trace of him either, so he chocked it all up to the late night movie marathon the group had had last night, and went about his business quietly. Lord knows his dad needs sleep, so he let him have it.
“Ahhhh, bye Steve!” He called hurriedly, and ripping his backpack from the counter top as if anything of importance actually lay in it he made a mad dash for the elevator.
. “Typical parental bias, you don’t know that he’ll love me!
“What are you working on?” Peter asked curiously. Tony wasn’t known for his stellar sleeping habits, but he only ever surpassed the 24 hour mark when there was something that really caught his interest.
If Peter had been paying attention to the people rather than the walkie talkie in hand, he might have noticed the glances the trio spared above his head. As it so happened, the moments of silence passed without thought.
Peter shook his hands above the trash to get the debris off, and gave a minor look to Steve who was still cloaked by the morning grey light. “I’ll survive, and if not make my death something cool like a car chase, or like, I died because ‘I knew too much’, but sound really ominous when you say it.”
Steve laughed, and rubbed his eyes. “Yeah, I guess I got tired out faster than I thought…” He mused, but stopped that thought as if he were biting his tongue mid-sentence. He looked behind him, at Tony’s door like he had only just realized it resided there. A few seconds passed before he said, “What happened?”
“Oh my god.” Peter said audibly. “
Genius, billionaire, philanthropist Anthony Edward Stark thought he could stabilize a radioactive element when it was seconds away from bursting, and thus presented the well deserved seat in the ICU he now had.
Peter turned to look at the clock, and cursed when it said 7:15. No, there was no time. If he missed homeroom again and Mrs. Steinbrenner had to call Tony Stark again, Peter would probably not see the inside of a lab for weeks. He shook his head sadly. “No, it’s grab-n-go for me.” Peter moved closer towards Steve, but reached behind him for the fruit bowl as he picked out a banana that would suffice. Steve yawned loudly, and realizing he had never really heard that from the Captain’s mouth before, Peter turned to look at him and possibly taunt him until he noticed an ugly, prominent bruise just on his collar line.
“Petey!” Tony said excitedly, if not a little dopey. This time, it did not evade Peter’s notice that Steve retracted his hand from Tony’s and moved a little farther away.
“Don’t worry, Steve.” Peter sighed sympathetically. He let his hand rest on one of Steve’s massive biceps in a comforting manner. Steve hardly reacted at all to the touch, but seemed to follow peter’s word closely. “Everybody knows the press has really good photoshop.”
“Clint’s retractable arrows. I think I realized why the test products were catching fire…” He mused, shoving his notes towards Tony for inspection. “Ignore the parts about the firefighters being symbolic of censorship, that’s something else.”
“When did you get hurt?” He pointed at the dollar coin sized splotch on his neck, and Peter saw Steve pale like he was auditioning for Casper.
“Steve…” Tony breathed softly, looking up at Steve with a look Peter had never seen cross his face. I mean sure, it was love. Peter knew that look indefinitely, but love mixed with…
“Dad.” Peter scolded, feeling the accompanying power high that followed chastising your own father at the dinner table.
Later, it came time for presents. Peter ended up getting Thor the ‘Bruce Banner’ action figure, both to annoy Bruce and please Thor. Natasha got Clint a coffee mug that said ‘bad bitch’ in the ugliest, bedazzled fashion that peter had ever seen (Clint wiped away a few tears--- both real and fake when he saw it). And finally, from the side of Peter’s view, he saw Steve hand Tony a small, wrapped box. Peter’s own unwrapping halted as he watched the scene unfold, with the small taste of bitterness still fresh on his lips. He wondered if Steve got his boyfriend a gift too. If his boyfriend knew that he’d gotten Tony one. If Tony knew at all.
“A friend.” Steve finally answered. “A good friend.”
“Look, it’s even on clearance, they’re probably just trying to get rid of it!”
Steve was only a small part of it actually, but there were big arrows pointing and saying “Captain America!?!?!” which left little up to imagination. The title said “Avengers couple celebrate anniversary” and it had a very charming picture of Thor and Bruce at some gala the year previous, and then in a little box above their heads it said “Another avengers romance??” And showed what appeared to be Tony Stark kissing Steve Rogers. It was in a little café where they were bent over the seats, and the picture was fuzzy with little focus on their faces, but honestly, it was convincing.
“Tony. No. We were very bad at it... like really bad.”
"Okay then get dressed and come down." Tony chimed into the box, Steve could hear the smirk.
(this story as a longer original work) I'm excited to explore how that scene develops once I write it!
*******
“I was very impressed with your resume. Thank you for choosing to join our team. I’m really looking forward to working with you.” Tony said, a sincere smile on his face.
“You're not going to throw up in my car right? Last time you were in here you seemed pretty intent to.” Steve teased—trying to cover up his actual worry—as he fished out his car keys and let Tony in.
“The kind they are used to.” Steve replied flatly, moving over to open the passenger side door for Tony.
“What happened to whatever I want to do you’ll accept it?” Steve smirked at him
“I'm a lot of things.” Tony smirked.
Tony’s chest swelled up with an emotion he wasn’t sure what to call yet as he tried to stop the huge open mouthed grin that so desperately wanted to grace his face. With a blink he slowly moved his gaze from the starry night sky to Steve’s crystal blue eye’s towering directly above him.
“Kay babe. You can stop gushing over Tony. We get it, he’s great. I’m right here.” Sam said waving his hand in the air. Jemma smiled and kissed him, snuggling into his arms.
“So?” Steve eyed Tony, who was still intently staring at the key like nothing else in the world existed. ”Do you like it?”
“Yeah...they’re pretty great. They helped through a lot. They’re my family.” Steve smiled as he looked back at Tony. “Um, so are you still up for the park? You’re not sick of me yet?”

’ flashed through his mind. It had been a quick and passing thought, but it had been enough to startle Tony up from his spot on the 'way too small for two people’ couch. He quickly excused himself as he bolted out of there, nearly doubling over on the dining room table, stating he needed a good night’s sleep to finish his new project F.R.I.D.A.Y.
“Sowwy God. The-the man- the voice from the box told me not to move.” He said lifting up his phone. Steve noted Tony's other hand was clutching an empty wine bottle.
Hey so this takes place moments after the last chapter. Sorry for taking so long, it's just... life. Anyways, I'll update soon, I hope.
“Shit.”
“I-I failed at making you breakfast.” Tony reminded him, his anger and frustration slowly dissolving, however, at the sight of Steve’s huge dorky grin.
“Impressive,” Tony said, his chest letting out a heavy breath. “How was lunch with Bucky?”
“Yeah. Then movies.” Steve smiled, excited at how the day was turning out.
“That’s fortunate. Would have been awkward for him to walk in on me like this.”
"-And that. That's the second time you've said it to me," Tony looked up, distraught covering his face, tears threatening to fall despite Tony's best efforts to hold them back. Shit, this was not how he planned the day to go. He was going to go there to surprise Steve with a nice breakfast, and then surprise him with a nice gift. Hoping to somewhat return the favor for how Steve had cared for him. And then confess to stealing the art journal Steve had snatched from his hands before he could open it. But Steve would be okay with it because he had been wined and dined and gifted. NOWHERE in the plans did there include
“That’s no way to speak to a pregnant lady Steve.” Sam berated him, giving his spot on the sofa to Jane.
Steve watched Nat, Sam, and Bucky huddle, plotting their next move.
“Well… I thought we were making pie after this?” Steve asked, tone losing its playfulness as he rubbed at the bump where he hit his head.
And just as quickly as it happened he was gone. Tony was left blinking at the ground below him. His face was flushed and his body was apparently very excited now. He blinked a few times as he rebooted his brain. He looked around to see where Steve had run off to. Nothing. He looked down at his crotch to remind himself they were playing tag and to calm the fuck down. When he felt he was decent enough he went off to go look for Steve.
“It’s- he’s-” Steve continued trying until he was finally able to shut his mouth. He gave a warm smile to the waitress as she set down their food, politely ignoring the blush that crept on her face as he did so. He took a deep breath then looked back at Tony who was now scowling at the waitress.
