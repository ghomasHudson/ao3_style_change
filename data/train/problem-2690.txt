The demon’s eyes widened. Lucifer, according to their intelligence, had casually dragged Hell to Earth along with his demons. Especially
When Dean finished, he climbed carefully off the table, jamming the paint can back into a long pocket in his jacket. “If we gotta go out this way, you crawl like hell, sunshine.”
Castiel swallowed against his own emotion rising painfully in his throat. They had kept each other anchored, then, even though they were both lost in the sea. At least they’d been lost together.
“Danvers,” the woman barked. “This is the presence we tracked.” She scowled between Dean and Castiel. “Which one is it? Or is it both of them?”
“Just...think, okay? I thought it was your brother keeping you here. For the longest time. But this site...I think we’ve got to consider it. Do you remember anything that might have gotten left? I know you said your memory of Sam here is patchy after you...you know.”
Castiel opened the photo, expanded it, and looked at it. He remembered to breathe. He looked at it some more.
As soon as the last duck disappeared after the group into a copse of trees, the spell holding Dean and Castiel in place broke. Dean realized it first, stumbling forward to embrace Castiel from behind, drawing him in sharply to his chest. “Fuck,” Dean whispered in his ear. He was shaking.
“They do sound amazing,” Castiel said, happily allowing Dean to guide his hands through process. “And you learned to make this when you were eleven?” He looked at his counter, already a complete disaster with eggs, spilled bread crumbs, and dusted flour. “In a motel room.”
They ate in companionable, exhausted silence punctuated by the occasional weary bleat of the sheep in the belly of the house. Castiel washed the pot quickly, dried it, and repacked their cook gear. He stretched out long and yawned. It had been a tiring day and tension from the lack of sleep and constant hunching under the boat’s canopy manifested from his head to his tailbone. He rolled his neck from side to side, letting it pop around the aches.
In the early hours of the morning, Dean drove them all home. Kevin and Channing, once settled in the back seat of the Impala, transformed into an exhausted two-headed lump, and slumped off with quiet farewells when Dean dropped them off. Then Dean drove towards Castiel’s apartment with companionable silence between them.
Sam frowned. “Um. Hold on.” He held up one finger and disappeared into the house. Castiel stood there and waited at the half open door. He could hear signs of life in the house. The shrieking laughter of Avery and whuffled barking. When Sam returned, it was with Eileen. She looked worried but strangely it didn’t seem to be directed at Castiel. “Dean got a phone call before he left. On your tablet. He took off right after that.”
He yawned, cleared his throat, and took a quick sip of water so the words would come out clear and perfect. When the words were right and his mind centered, pies fell like careful-cut crystals from his lips. If his attention or mood wavered, the pies reflected that as well. Castiel took a slow breath then spoke deliberately. Another pie appeared and he caught it with the unerring accuracy of constant practice.
he thought with wonder. They’d spoken about family on one of their first dates, the conversation spinning into darker territory than either of them had probably planned. Castiel had learned a little more about Dean’s unsteady childhood, and Castiel had told him a little bit about his awful run of institutional “therapy” that had culminated in him leaving home. Dean remembered that Charlie was Castiel’s family now, though it hadn’t been mentioned since, and he was astonished at his solicitude.
“All pies are good. It’s the law of pies.” Dean flew his hands up and retreated to the kitchen island and the casserole he’d been preparing there.
“So,” Dean said, staring hard at the silhouette of a tree across the street. “There’s a reason for… I didn’t think before I…”
They drove in a wide loop around Jackson, skirting well south of Detroit, before stopping for the night in the middle of vast farmland gone fallow and redolent with the smell of decaying hay. If there were Croats around, they’d have their work cut out to find them.
“Ah,” Castiel murmurs, embarrassment immediately rushing in to fill him after the despair of the Empty. Dean lets him push up and away, rolling to the side, and Castiel is immediately engulfed in an embrace as Jack and Sam rush in.
Dean smirked then winked in an entirely inappropriate way for a scientist leading a major study. “Delicious as always,” he said at last. “But it’s still not my favorite.”
The question brushed against him as he settled back into work. It loomed as he walked the quiet hallways of the house.
It was a perfect pie. Strawberry cream as light as a cloud filled the crust with a swirl and sugar crystals gleamed along the edge. A latticework of dark chocolate crossed over the top like a sweet rope net.
Dean peered at the distant boat. “It’s a ways out,” he remarked. “And nothing between here and there but water. Gonna need to head out there under darkness.” He grimaced. “And find a boat.”
Castiel ignored the board, stowing it away on the shelf under his coffee table. If there was a spirit - and Castiel wasn’t ready to say there was - it was quieter now. Even the chill at night had eased lately. It was just Castiel…just
Dean blew in like a sweet breeze, tugging Castiel in for a kiss. Castiel wrapped one hand around his collar and the other at his waist and returned his kiss like this might be the last time. When Dean pulled away long enough to shut the door, it was with starry eyes and a wicked smile. “Now,” he said without preamble. “What’s up with the sudden, ‘never mind, not coming?’ I promise you, Sam hasn’t bitten anyone since he was four.” He slipped a hand around Castiel’s waist, teasing skillful fingers towards the hem of his shirt.
“We know enough,” Castiel signed rapidly. Why was Dean acting worried? Shouldn’t he be celebrating? Charlie had finally found
“Guess so.” Dean’s voice sounded strange and Castiel looked at him. Dean stared out the door into the back garden. A light breeze ran along the hedge leaves and a cardinal sang in the wide oak that spanned the property line. “Dunno if I’m happy or not.”
Charlie managed to track down a surly, sandy-haired man who seemed to derive great pleasure from being a recent recipient of one of Amara’s curses. Charlie had left him standing on the street, shouting while frogs and snakes fell from his mouth. She’d looked shaken by the encounter when she recounted it later to Dean and Castiel. “It feels like a warning,” she’d said. “A warning to you.”
Castiel drooped, and dropped his phone before clutching his hair. He was still sitting there, mind scrambling for an exit strategy, when Dean texted that he was downstairs. Castiel sighed, ground his forehead into his knees.
“I’ll follow you out?” Dean asked and Castiel nodded. Dean grabbed the large pastry box of leftover healing pies to donate to a food pantry while Castiel settled things back at the Comm. Together, they formed a small caravan through the blooming city streets. Castiel parked his truck and headed inside to finish preparing his kitchen space for a potentially long absence.
The castle itself was a wonder unparalleled to even Harroway. The exterior was smooth, opalescent up close, and it looked as though it had been dribbled into existence, built up like wet sand by a large, delicate hand. Despite its bubbled surface, graceful windows cut into its spires and across the bracing buildings. Each window shone with merry gold light. And while the woods leading to the castle had shivered like living metal, here fragrant, flowering plants embraced the castle like lips to a breast.
“‘M fine,” Dean said in his ear. He squeezed him tightly, then pulled back, tugging at Castiel. “Come on,” he said. “Let’s find a little privacy.”
“Is that why you tried to attack my vegetables?” As soon as the words left his mouth, Castiel regretted them. “I mean. It’s fine. I didn’t mean
Dean laughed. “You will be. I promise.” He leaned an elbow on the table, for all appearances like someone relaxing next to a friend.
Castiel shook his head with a grimace, then pulled out his tablet. Rapidly, he looped his fingers on the keyboard, typing into his dictation app. A smooth, male voice emerged from its speakers. “I finally went to the Surly Cow last night. That bar you told me about?”
When the all clear was issued, Castiel finally let himself breathe. The driver’s question came from near the rolling door, sounding incredibly bored by the whole operation. “Why does Lucifer want all this shit anyway?”
Pushing himself upright, Castiel was pleased to see that his feet were no longer anchored to the ground. He shifted up into a sitting position and turned to see Dean still straining against the magic that held him. Dean struggled to reach him, but his fingertips stopped inches away from Castiel.
Crowley lounged in the far booth as though he’d never left. He leaned forward, both elbows on the table, and sipped a whiskey with a bored look on his face. He brightened when he saw Castiel, and his palpable joy made Castiel even more nervous, hope crumbling like pie crust.
He follows the sound, inexplicably loud in the realm of nothing, until he sees Dean. Castiel freezes.
Castiel set his finger over Sam Winchester’s new entry in his contacts and then pressed it. The phone rang. A man picked up. Castiel’s heart thundered in his chest as he put the phone on speaker. “Hello, this is— My name is Castiel Novak. I’m calling for Sam Winchester.”
When they were ready to test the device, Castiel took a butterfly-filled breath and let it out slowly. He’d been doing this speech-without-speech trick for years now. He could manage it in the face of Dean's intense focus. He looked down at the tablet Dean had placed in front of him. There was a list of phrases and short sentences. Castiel recognized it almost immediately. He’d spent several years in close connection to speech therapists. This particular sample set included words of slowly increasing length and complexity. If he closed his eyes, he could probably recite them from memory alone.
The conversation’s volume dwindled, but as they approached, Lucifer’s lackey was easily overheard again.
“C’mon, man. It’s my favorite road trip snack! A man’s gotta have more than pie!” Dean paused and his eyes widened as Castiel burst into laughter. “ I can’t believe I just said that.”
“That’s a mistake,” Dean spat. “We’ve been up against Lucifer and come out of it alive and we didn’t have any fancy weapons.” This last was a blatant lie, but Castiel approved of Dean’s calm bravado in making it.
In Maltese, winter held the perfect amount of snow cover during the darkest days like the city was posing for a postcard. Castiel and Dean waded through powdery snow that glittered in the late sunshine as they stalked Central Park looking for the witch. The chill air was cold enough to make each breath just a little painful, but the sun warmed them far more than it had for the past few months. Castiel struggled for composure as they roved the park in wary silence. He had to keep a cool head. This needed to go perfectly.
The bus rumbles pleasantly around him, sleepy chatter from the other passengers creating a gentle symphony. Castiel can’t be soothed. He feels cracked down the middle. He can close his eyes and see Dean’s face, bloody. He can close his eyes and see a vast warehouse of the same thing. Dean wouldn’t call him family if he knew how close Castiel had come to buckling under the fist of Heaven.
Dean scrubbed a palm across the back of his neck. “D’you have a stall at the Night Market this year?”
“Died?” Dean laughed. “Uh, hit up a hunt. Turned out to be vamps killing parents and kidnapping kids. We got cornered and then…” Memory sliced through him. “There was one chick who tried to get the drop on me and Sam. The fight got bad and I got a piece of rebar in my back. Hey,” he said, noticing Castiel’s increasing alarm. “You get thrown into walls your whole life, eventually there’s gonna be one with a big-ass piece of metal that’s got your name on it.”
Castiel laughed at Dean’s attempt to lighten the mood, and the lemon rush helped clear out some of the fug from earlier. “I understand now. You only love me for my food,” he wrote, then looked up with an exaggerated frown.
Another grunt and something like a whimper replied, then the man parted his lips again and allowed Castiel to lift the flask for him enough to wet his lips and tongue. The man jerked at the burn of alcohol and Castiel locked his own grimace deep within himself. If he’d retained the power of healing, he could have pressed his grace into this man and proceeded with the job of interrogation. Instead, he waited while the prisoner calmed his breathing and tested his mouth and tongue. When he stilled again, Castiel asked again, “Who are you? Why are you here?”
“Fine,” Dean said with an expansive gesture for Castiel to break into the container. “You win. Maybe it’s an East Coast thing.” He crossed the room to steady the cylinder, gripping it above the bolt holes at its base. “Let’s crack this piñata.”
“Did I ever tell you about my first time camping with Bobby?” Dean asks quietly. “I swear this place is better. There were bloodsuckers everywhere, and not the kind you can slice through. Bobby thought bug spray scared away game so...”
Castiel hummed happily and shrugged. It wasn’t his fault that the very thought of Dean made such ridiculously frothy pies. Well, maybe it was his fault just a little.
Dean shook his head, seemingly oblivious to Castiel’s discomfort. His expression turned on a dime into something strangely like childish delight. “Do you speak ASL?” he asked, hands swiftly moving with his words. “Because I’d love someone else to practice with.”
When they finally parted, Dean held Castiel’s palm and traced along the center line - the heart line - with tender kisses. “Say it again,” he begged, this time with a mischievous light. He repositioned Castiel’s palm as though preparing him to catch a pie.
Castiel rubbed at his lip and once again released the words, feeling vulnerable out on the front porch. “I missed him. He’s not at his place, either.” The pie left a lingering taste of peas on his tongue and it steamed in his hand, green and viscous.
Dean emerged to find Castiel still standing at his open duffel, staring into space. Castiel was startled from his reverie by Dean sliding one arm around his waist and intoning in mock announcer style, “Earth to Cas. Come in, Cas.”
Castiel hesitated just inside the door as his eyes adjusted to the light. He surveyed the long, dark bar.
“Nowhere in particular and just passing through. We should get going,” Castiel said. “Thank you for your time.”
Castiel blinked at this new information. It seemed they both had unrevealed pasts. “And your threat?” Castiel asked. “What did you say to Crowley? Is he going to come after you?”
They couldn't take the chance that Amara might warp his gift into something uglier. Harsher. Instead, Castiel slipped the piece of paper she had given him into a drawer, so that he would always remember the choices he had made to steer his own fate.
Dean’s proximity felt dizzying. Castiel didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look up to watch the fine textures of Dean’s scruff dance as he spoke. Dean continued speaking, apparently unaffected. Right. He was a professional.
Outside the hospital, the sun painted the summer-sweet, greening world in emerald and sapphire as the new season began in earnest. In Maltese, the effects would be radically apparent, with suddenly-bloomed flowers painting the streets in rainbows. Kansas was more outwardly normal, but Castiel thought he knew better now. A little magic existed everywhere whether it was acknowledged or not, and like a pie crust holds a filling, love held everything together and made it whole.
He approached a service desk warily, eyeing the plexiglass erected over the “Information” sign and the woman staffing it. The woman looked up as he approached. “Can I help you, sir?”
Dean answered with a sharp grunt and Castiel set off at high speed, tires spinning, engine revving. Ahead, they could now see the army of hungry diseased humans ripping each other apart to get to them.
is why he had come. Castiel thought he might do anything - promise anything - to get his hands on a device like that. The video ended on a close-up of Dean holding the spidery headset. “Lyrebird,” he said to the camera as orchestral music swelled. “It’s the voice of the future.”
“Don't move. Don’t talk,” she advised him in cool, deadly tone, but his shout had worked. Dean turned around in the booth with an incredulous and wildly relieved expression.
“I need you to come with me,” Charlie pleaded. “I need you to be there because...because I don’t know how I’m gonna face it, otherwise.”
“They are,” Castiel admitted, though this time his focus was solely on the man walking behind him. They pushed their way through the dense brush, both weighted by memory.
In the video, Hannah stood next to her and indicated the headset, which was wrapped around the woman’s skull and hooked up to a hefty computer. “We use this to monitor the electrical signals in your brain that order your vocal assembly to move and tap those signals to power the speech delivery. For example.” She tapped something on the computer and a jumping graph on the computer monitor went wild. Hannah signaled the brunette with her hand, and the woman mouthed the same thing as before. This time, a silky voice emanated from the computer. It appeared to match her words beautifully. She delivered the next line with what looked like a suppressed laugh, and the sentence emerged light and fluttering, like she really had been laughing. The brunette read simple lines from a tablet, perfectly and clearly. She sounded every bit as warm as rich as though she’d spoken the words aloud herself.
Castiel had scrambled out from under the covers before he had time to even form the thought. “Let’s go.” He pushed himself off the bed, falling half into Dean’s cold form. “I’ll help you find it,” he promised. “Dean, I’m gonna set you free.”
Knitting his fingers together in his lap, Castiel contemplated them before staring again at the apparition
“Just kill me,” the demon gasped, clutching their side, fingers clawing over the bullet hole fruitlessly. “Please.”
Dean greeted him in the kitchen with a kiss, a streak of flour curling in the hair over his ear. “You’re late,” Dean whispered as they drew away, but he winked to soften the accusation. He waved a hand at the bar-height counter jutting from the wall and dividing the kitchen from a large, oval dining table. “Pies go there.”
Castiel cleared his throat. “I admire your inventiveness,” he said at last, voice only a little rough. “But I’m reserving judgment. For now.” He looked back at the counter, at the array of ingredients Dean had persuaded him to bring home and attempt to cook.
Castiel used to think a great deal about the soul, but as an abstract concept against a rubric of the rewards or punishments of an afterlife. Now, he thought about it in terms of concrete actions: opening doors, flipping through movies, walking outside. Laughing. Touching. Castiel’s feet beat against the gravel shoulder. Queen Anne’s lace thunked into his knees and delicate sideoats grama tickled the skin above his socks. The air felt hot, dusty, and so thick he could eat it on the tines of a fork. He could touch these things. Smell them. Reach down and pluck a grass blade to taste and twirl between his lips.
One extensive ultrasound and an actual MRI later, Castiel was led to a line of chairs set along the bigger hallway. He pressed back into one of the chairs, exhausted in mind and body. It had been an overwhelming afternoon. Too many hospitals and too many tests in his youth had taught him the costs of some of the equipment they’d used with him today. An MRI machine? How much money was this company throwing after this project if they had their own MRI?
Anger ballooned in Castiel’s chest. Of course, his angelic nature was still extant enough to trigger a tracking spell, but not enough to be any good for anything else. Rapidly, he rearranged his plans. What mattered was stopping Lucifer. What mattered was saving the world. He’d allow himself to be locked away so that Dean could work with the Men of Letters. He could--
Davies had laughed. “No, I don’t think so. If my ship’s plan A and you’re plan B, then somebody’s got to stay alive to try and muster up a plan C. There are hidden bunkers in America. I’m headed there to explore the lore for more options. I’m told the Americans held onto some frankly astonishing things.”
Dean’s look of disbelief conveyed reams of feelings on the subject. “Believe me,” he said. “It’s never just ice cream. Not when there’s magic involved.”
It was always surreal, the bright flash of a distant explosion before the sound caught up, like a silent movie playing out. And then the rumble surged over them, the groan of fire and shrieking collapse of metal and brick and stone.
“Oh!” The voice on the other line sounded young. Surprised. “I though you were calling from— Is everything okay? With the house?” There was an awkward huff on the other end of the phone that sounded so much like Dean it took Castiel’s breath away.
By sight, Castiel could tell the man was human. Both monster and demon showed their true faces to him. At least his angelic eyesight hadn’t failed him yet. But human didn’t necessarily mean “on their side.”
Castiel pulled her into a hug. She sank into his embrace and sniffled on his shoulder. “I ran for such a goddamn long time. But now I’m thinking it’s time to stop. And maybe I gotta—” Castiel could feel her begin to shake in his arms. “Maybe I gotta let her go. I tried to do that last month,” she whispered. “I tried so fucking hard.”
, Castiel realized, sliding carefully to one knee beside the man. He kept his rifle propped on his other leg, while he dug in one of his pockets for his flask. He drew it out and uncapped it one-handed, well practiced in the move. He settled the open contained below the nose of the dark-haired man. “Drink,” Castiel commanded him shortly, tipping the flask up to the man’s lips.
Just as the last, this pie was perfect. It would remain in this unblemished just-ready-to-eat state for hours yet before it would start to fall prey to the forces of the natural world, like heat, cold, or rot. In his darker times, Castiel found this lasting perfection deeply disheartening. He loved to bake; loved to lose himself in fine measurements, careful cuts, and intricate new flavor combinations. But even his most perfect hand-made pie never seemed to exceed the ones magicked from his lips.
Dean shuddered theatrically. “So you’re one of those people.” His tone marked a death knell. “A morning person.”
“Sam Winchester.” Castiel typed the seller’s name into the search engine. “Did you know this house was haunted? Is this why it was such a good deal? Did you run all the way to California to get away?” He rubbed a finger thoughtfully under his lip. “Unless this is all just me.” Castiel sighed. “I suppose I wouldn’t discount that. But it is odd. What do you know about this house, Sam Winchester? What were you hiding?”
He turned to the counter and began to unbox the pies, rolling his eyes as Dean crowded over his shoulder to take a look. “What’d you make?” Dean asked eagerly, slipping one distracting hand to settle on Castiel’s hip. His breath tickled his ear and Castiel felt himself warm from the attention. He ought to be past this, accustomed to Dean’s easy affection. It still completely engulfed him.
Castiel fumbled in his pocket for the tablet, then remembering it was broken, tapped his throat and held up a finger before pointing it at his computer, sitting on an end table.
Castiel turned around slowly, hands holding onto the edge of the counter. “You’re still here,” he said as the mirror crackled with frost behind him. “In my house.”
“You got it, babe,” Dean agreed. His grip was solid as he helped Castiel up from the bench. Sandwiched between his boyfriend and best friend, Castiel headed for lunch and tried to push away worries about tomorrow.
The witch looked up from his bowl with an arch look in his eye. “Looking to bag some big prey tonight, hmm? You sure that’s wise?”
In a flash, Castiel grabbed his hand. “Follow me,” he said and with a sudden bright grin, he pulled Dean through the ballroom towards a wide balcony sheltered by fluttering curtains.
vegetables? I guess it depends on whether you’re a Slimer-style ghost or…or somebody who died?” He paused in arranging vegetables in the crisper drawer. “If you were someone who died, who were you? There must be some reason you’re here.”
Dean ignored the amused question at first, too fixed on the revelry and tracking Harroway's princesses in case he must flee with them. Down in this cavernous kingdom, he doubted his ability to track the hours on his own.
Dean leaned against the opposite shelf and a fleeting grin lit his features. “Dude. Your ‘every Gas ‘n’ Sip has the same features’ theory does not hold up. We found a cache in just one of ‘em and god knows how many I’ve hit..”
After a handful of hours of sleep, they met Charlie for an unhurried, late breakfast at the nearby pancake emporium. They went over the plan. “Mom’s in a private room,” Charlie said. “And when I come to visit I usually close the door for a little while. I did that every day for the past week and nobody said anything, so I think we’re good there. Nobody bothers me.”
Dean rolled his chair away to snag the tablet of the day’s verbal exercises. He slid it over to Castiel and busied himself on the computer before raising a finger in the air. “Okay. You’re good to go.”
Dean slumped against the wall and inhaled the stone-damp air of the narrow stairwell. Servants moved silently past him like he had already failed. Like he was already dead. Maybe he was. Swallowing against rising bile, Dean fumbled his way down to the door that opened out to the kitchen yard of the vast Harroway castle. He could do this. He could save himself. Right? It was a fairy tale palace, and if he survived he would one day rule it alongside his queen.
A cold bottle touched the back of his neck and Castiel pulled away with a shout. He laughed at Dean’s pleased expression and accepted the drink. “I’m glad you remembered.”
“You’re the only reality I want to have. I want this happy ending with you, Cas. I need it. I need you.”
“That does seem to be the way we’re going.” Hope fluttered in Castiel’s chest and he bashed it down fiercely.
A stiff, mulish expression settled on the man’s face and Castiel sighed to see it. He shifted his gun to his left hand and reached for his blade. A silent swift death was in order, after which they’d have to further infiltrate the ship to try to find the weapon Ketch had spoken about. There was no time for anything else.
It had been so long since he’d even contemplated dating anybody. The prospect of revealing his magic to someone he cared about was a terrifying thing. With the notable exception of Charlie, it tended to go very poorly for Castiel. His last relationship had burned him out on the idea of dating, of opening himself up to anyone new who might be able to wound him so deeply. And yet…
The curtain he’d moved had settled back into place. His apartment was dark and still. He sat carefully back down on the couch, heart in his throat and hands on his thighs, and waiting for the buzzer to stop.
“I’ve got his tablet,” Dean said to Crowley, voice tense. “It helps him talk. Can I give it to him?”
Dean looked around at Kevin, and only Kevin and then grimaced theatrically. “How rude of me. If I’d known there was pie I would’ve gotten away sooner.” He gestured at the perfect rosy sky ushering in the evening like he was waving away a gnat. “These all hand made?” he asked.
“Oh,” Charlie said, the comment neutral enough to draw his attention. Her eyes were wide and something like glee seemed to overtake her features. “You mean…?”
Castiel woke with his heart racing and his chest tight. He opened his eyes into the deep gray of his bedroom, spread his fingers across his chest, and gulped in long, shuddering breaths. A chill wrapped around the room. The walls creaked.
he thought. But there was a lot for him to unpack from this short conversation alone. But if anyone could understand feeling traumatized by magic, Castiel thought it would be himself.
Dean wrapped a careful hand around the pie and lifted it to his own lips, closing his eyes in bliss for a moment as he took a bite. Then he held it up for Castiel to do the same. The pie burst with flavor, layered and complex. “
Castiel smoothly turned, berating himself for the excitement that flared because Dean ordered one of his hand-made pies, rather than a magical variety. He pulled one out, settled it into a little paper pie plate, and handed it to him across the counter. He expected Dean to leave then, but instead he stood there under Kevin’s amused stare and inhaled the fragrance of the pie.
Castiel’s fingers faltered on his screen. Heat stole through him as he realized he was staring and he wrenched his gaze away and finished writing, looking at Kevin - and only Kevin - as the voice on his tablet recommended the lemon-mint medley, a new pie Castiel had perfected recently.
Castiel risked a glance at Dean. Speed turned the landscape around them into strips of paint. “Are you crazy?”
Maybe it was his exhaustion, Castiel decided later. Or the way dreams clung if you thought about them too much in the moments after waking. “What would you do?” he whispered.
“Well, I’m glad.” Castiel looked off to the side, ostensibly surveying the room. But Dean knew him better than that.
“Yo, Cas!” A brunette with a solar grin poked her head through her own truck window. Above her, an ice cream cone slowly whirled on a drunken axis. “Thought you’d never come out of there.”
, he thought. But that was a conversation for later when he could explain himself, apologize, and hopefully kiss Dean well enough to make both of them forget the past day.
The Empty Dean frowns deeply at the intrusion. “Oh, you made it through after all,” he says, voice modulating higher and body in flux until the Empty reforms as Meg. She pouts.
“Some things are worth it,” Dean assured him. “And I’ve got a feeling this is one of them. Now, are you gonna soak in worry all day, or are you going to dance with me?”
Castiel crossed his arms, but clenched his hands into his shirt. “When you emerge, having solved the mystery, your prize will be marriage. A kingdom and a princess all your own.”
Words shouldn’t be enough to send Castiel into a spiral, but the flare of want ignites in him again.
The cloak felt like a lightning-filled sky against his skin, or like the beggar’s clear gaze in the shadow of the castle. Dean shivered against it, and pushed open the princesses’ door. Through his arm, as though through clear glass, he watched the crack in the door widen. Marveling, he raised his hand and watched as the room shimmered into focus
“Yeah, any time,” Dean said, and then winced. “Sorry I— For me this was— Castiel.” He kissed him so he wouldn’t have to find the words.
Dean settled next to him and rested surprisingly gentle fingers at the nape of Castiel’s neck. “Where’s it bothering you. Here?”
The next room was clearly set up as Lucifer’s command room. It swarmed with demons, set up with tables and computers. Castiel swore silently as they retreated from the room back into the cover of the Orchid House. He knew the conservatory was set up in a loop, designed to bring visitors smoothly from room to room. Lucifer wasn’t in the command room, which meant if he was still in the building they would need to either fight their way through this mess of demons, or go all the way around the other way.
The shouting grew nearer and Castiel sprung up, surprisingly spry for his apparent injuries. “And that appears to be my cue. Thank you, Dean Winchester. And—good luck.” With a flashing smile, he disappeared through the trees, silent as a deer.
Castiel set down the peeled avocado on the cutting board and turned towards Dean. The ghost regarded him back warmly, his lips turned up in a self-deprecating smile. Castiel took his time taking him in. Dean’s eyes were warm and green and
When Castiel got back to his apartment, he locked the door behind him with shaking fingers, then pulled out his phone. He’d hoped that Dean might have called him or at least sent him a text in the hour it took to drive from Sam’s home back to the city. But his screen was unblemished with notifications. Stomach churning, he pulled up his messenger app. Maybe Dean had sent him a message but Castiel had somehow missed it? But again, no. The last message on there was a thumbs up emoji, Dean’s response to Castiel telling him he was heading his way.
Dean pressed a hand against his illusory wound, then passed it through his own body. He shook, or the lights trembled. “I’m dead,” Dean said. “I’m…dead.” When he looked up again, the warmth in his eyes was entirely gone. “Where’s Sam?” he asked in a panting howl. Wind picked up in the house, scraping the spice containers across the counter and whipping the blinds into a chattering frenzy.
Finally, Charlie deflated, wrapping her free hand around his. “You know I had your back the moment I learned your secret, okay? If you really want to stop looking for the witch who cursed you then I’ll…I’ll respect your wishes.” She sounded like the words had to be torn from her chest and Castiel sandwiched her hand in his own and squeezed. She tightened her other arm around him in response, pulling him close and whispering an apology in his ear.
Castiel was just working up the nerve to ask Dean if he’d heard bad news about the future of the project when Dean stopped typing and sucked in a deep breath. He turned towards Castiel with a look of trepidation, fingertips running restlessly along the table edge. “So,” he said, and after another moment, “Cas.”
When they pulled away at last, Dean shook his shoulders gently. “Who cares what she said about magic. I love you,” Dean grinned as Castiel gaped at him. “I love you,” he said. “So go on. Say something.
Davies strolled out of view and returned with Castiel’s angel blade in his palms. “So this might be your blade, then? Not something you picked up along the way?”
Sam laughed and rubbed at the circles under his eyes. “Yeah. I’m bushed. Cas,” he said. “Great to have you here. Dean, you’re making breakfast.”
“You healed your mother,” Amara said, sounding pleased, and Castiel turned back towards her sharply. She crouched in the snow, her dress spread out like an event horizon against the ice.
For a moment, Dean looked surprised. His mouth dropped open, he took Castiel in from tangled hair to tipped up knees. For a spirit, Dean was incredibly accomplished at the simulation of life, and he sucked in a short, hitching breath as he watched Castiel - like it was too much. Like he needed more. His tongue wet his lips and Castiel was helplessly drawn to watch it. To drink in every bit of him.
If any of his tension was apparent, the woman guiding him down a bright, sunny hallway didn’t mention it. “My name’s Hannah. I’m the speech therapist in our little group, so I’ll be evaluating you this afternoon. It’s so great that you could join our study,” she told him. “We’re doing some really exciting work with speech software. You haven’t participated in any of our other work, have you?” Castiel shook his head and her mouth slipped up into a wry half smile. “Winchester said you’d be new to all this, but he thought you’d be a good addition.”
“Dean,” Castiel replied, his own voice low and certain. He took a deep breath, enjoying the way his body arched into Dean, and the way Dean let him, riding the wave of his inhale. Slowly, he began to slide his fingers up Dean’s thighs.
Among the very few patrons, Castiel saw two of the usual absurdly well-dressed guards and someone occupying the last booth. Crowley’s booth. He could see Crowley shifting on his far bench, leaning back against the plush crimson walls of the booth.
Dean’s lips were warm and soft and utterly, perfectly pliant under the weight of Castiel’s kiss. Castiel sank into it, letting the rest of the evening cease to matter as long as he could be here, kissing Dean. The other man twined a hand into Castiel’s shirt and Castiel suppressed a pleased groan, deepening the kiss and bringing up one hand to brush along the soft stubble on Dean’s jaw.
Castiel halted in his tracks and pulled Dean into a desperate embrace. “I couldn’t have done it without you,” he whispered, expertly snagging the light-as-air pie that emerged.
He’d bought the place sight unseen. The realtor had described it as an amazing investment opportunity, a home priced low for a quick sale and close to Castiel’s job. Other than the ghost, it had lived up to the realtor’s claim that it was a solid purchase. The seller had also been remote, managing his end of the sale from California. At the time, this hadn’t bothered Castiel. Now, he wondered what the seller had been running from.
“I shouldn’t have involved you,” Castiel said over her protests. “And I’m afraid…” He hesitated, searching for words, but there was too much to list. They’d hit him twice, hard, before chucking him out the door. But that had just been punctuation on their threat of dropping a load of dark magic down on his head if he tried to pursue the witch any further, much less resist their “escort” outside. He quelled a shiver that tried to rattle its way out, thinking about Charlie - pure-sunshine and innocent in all of this - in the grips of the people back at that bar. “It’s done,” he wrote. Printed in black and white on his screen, the words seemed final. “I’m done. Please.”
Castiel closed his eyes and sighed into her shoulder, quietly this time, and there was no flavor in his silent exhale. Just the lavender scent of Charlie, his oldest friend in the city. Hell, maybe she was his
. It hovered over the letter for just a second before racing to the next. Castiel tried to memorize the letters hurriedly, his mind too addled to completely put it together.
Minutes later, the truck’s engine restarted and trundled the rest of the way to the sprawling Conservatory grounds. Dean grunted against Castiel’s shoulder. “Now?”
It felt like absolution as he drew it near his ear. Holy oil would destroy Castiel quickly and mercilessly, even with the full use of his grace. Surely it would at least slow down an archangel.
“Cas!” Dean laid a hand along Castiel’s arm, halting his flight. “You can’t be seriously going to meet her. You two don’t know anything about her!”
Giddy thoughts kept trying to interfere: after this they’d go out to celebrate. Like Dean, like nearly everyone else, Castiel would order food by calmly telling the waitstaff his order. Compared to other fantasies, it might seem minor, but to Castiel one tiny, normal activity felt like the height of years of yearning.
Dean stepped back, knife still held threateningly. But Crowley seemed to be true to his word. The man busied himself with straightening his tie and running a smoothing hand over his hair while his guards settled resentfully along the edge of the room. Dean held out a hand to Cas, with eyebrows raised.
In the midst of the chaos, Dean moved like a cobra striking, lunging across one of the tables and hauling Crowley upwards and inwards across its surface. A knife flashed in his hand, at Crowley’s neck.
Too much delight sparked in Charlie’s eyes and Castiel, remembering his recent run-in at the bar, worried for her. He should keep her safe, he knew that. But selfishly, he wanted her by his side. He needed her there, cheering him on, helping him unpeel the hidden layers that wrapped around the magical core of the city. With Charlie’s help, he’d find the witch. This time, there would be no delays, no hesitation on Castiel’s part in seeking her out. Then the witch would take back her “blessing” as soon as she realized it had really been a curse.
Castiel backed to the couch and settled on the far end. “I’m sorry,” he said. A lifetime of drilled-in manners welled up inside him like a terrible bubble. “Do you,” he cleared his throat. “Do you want to sit down?” He gestured to the couch.
“Oh! Yeah.” Dean bent toward the pies once more like he’d never given Castiel the third degree. “Strawberry pecan cream,” he said finally. “They all look awesome, though.” The last statement was delivered in a register of polite chit-chat. As Castiel watched him, a curtain of casual ease drew over Dean’s face.
The fabric between them turned everything plastic and unreal, so Castiel pressed their hips together. He ground his aching cock against Dean, dragging it against his concealed length. “Dean,” Castiel gasped into Dean’s throat. A pulse beat there, quick and quiet as a bird.
Dean seemed to notice Castiel’s focus and he parted his lips deliberately this time. Leaning forward, crowding into Castiel’s space, he whispered, “First, I’d kiss your neck. Kiss it slow, just there.”
Dean rose from the bench seat and Castiel started to step towards him again when the woman chuckled. “Oh no. Looks like we’ll have that chat now.” The cold tip of her barrel kissed his temple and Castiel stopped where he stepped.
“It’s not like it’s any different than what you’ve been up to with young Dean Winchester here. Getting an artificial voice to cover up for your Betty Crocker voicebox.” Crowley turned to Dean. “I can fix your little boyfriend. I just need you to do me one little favor.”
The chill came without warning. Sudden and bitter, gooseflesh rose on Castiel’s arms. Not from fear, or from cold, but from horror. “No,” Castiel said, frantically switching off the burner and turning around to examine the kitchen. “You can’t be here. Dean, you’re supposed to be waking up!”
“Traps,” Castiel murmured. If they came face-to-face with Lucifer, there would be little time to prepare. And if Lucifer wasn’t here they faced a high possibility of losing any element of surprise for future attempts if they were discovered.
“If they don’t let you in the doors because you’re not human,” Dean said with all the practice of an often repeated argument, “I’ll tear the universe apart until I find you.”
“Oh.” Dean’s voice changed to something like surprise, drawing Castiel’s attention. A devilish smirk crossed Dean’s lips and he quirked an eyebrow. “A good dream.”
Castiel shook his head, feeling slightly baffled by the casual environment of what surely must be a high security establishment. Before he’d left home, he thought that he had plenty of exposure to the high stakes business world. His family’s sprawling company seemed like the opposite of FutureTech; Novak Inc was a sea of dove-gray and white, overlaid by a culture of silence and subservience. It had never occurred to him that working for a large company could be fun or...happy. He’d arrived at FutureTech steeling himself against reminders of his past. Having his early expectations prove false was oddly soothing.
he decided as he rolled to his side and burrowed into the arm of the couch. One week to see what kind of fallout he faced. One week to wrap up his life here. It’d be fine. Nobody would miss him.
His friend settled next to him with a gusty sigh. She stretched her legs out, letting her feet dangle next to his over the side of the building.
Chill blasts of air scraped through the halls and slammed doors that should be ajar, and immobile. There’d been no more vegetable explosions, but that was a small comfort. Like a punchline to a bad joke, after a rash of inexplicable cold and strange thumps in the walls, he’d find his kitchen cabinets flung open once again.
Castiel cast around frantically for a weapon - anything he could use to gain an advantage and get away. He grabbed his tablet from his pocket and cracked it as hard as he could against her skull. She grunted as the tablet shattered and split, but didn’t move. And Dean-- He had pulled Dean into this. Dean, who had-- Castiel’s attention caught on motion to his right, a blur at the tables lining the rooms.
“You,” Castiel said quietly to Dean’s hollow, exhausted face. “I never realized how alone I was until I moved in here, and met you. You make everything better and I’ve been so happy— Dean, I want you in my world. But even if we can’t or you don’t want— I need you alive in the world. You’re so full of life. The most vibrant person I—“
Castiel stared for a moment longer, then nudged his tablet awake. He used the few seconds it took to type to compose himself and pretend his heart wasn’t throwing a circus parade. “Everything,” he said, looking up with faux-challenge in his gaze, determined not to waste this opportunity to flirt.
He and Dean had known this would be the end for one of them - probably both of them. But watching Lucifer smirk to himself had sent a bolt of clear, cold rage through Castiel. With that rage came clarity. He’d run for a window at the end of the hall, shattered glass framing the opening like jagged teeth. He’d jumped to the earth below, rolling clumsily across the overgrown lawn. Then he raced for Dean, heedless suddenly of the hopeless fight left behind him, not even caring about the lack of cover in the gaping stretch of lawn between the sanitarium and the woods. He’d either die or he wouldn’t.
Sam greeted him with surprise, and not a small amount of wariness. “Cas,” he said, opening the door, but not quite all the way. “What are you doing here?”
“I don’t want you to go.” The confession slipped out of Castiel and he sealed his lips after them. But it was too late.
“Croats can’t swim worth shit,” Dean said, eyes sharp and squinted against the water. “Rage only gets you so far before you sink, I guess.”
When Dean first appeared, Castiel was brushing his teeth, eyes glazed over with exhaustion in front of the mirror. Looking back on the experience later, he commended himself on not shrieking, or leaping forward and hurtling himself against the hard edge of the bathroom counter.
“Drop your weapon,” the guard ordered, pressing the weapon into Castiel’s skin. Castiel sealed his lips against the fear and pain. He watched Dean, his heart in his throat.
“Wow. That’s… Well, that’s a lot.” The witch shook his head. “But you do you.” He laid aside the pestle and picked up a bright pink book of matches. “Wrap that hex bag tight now, princess. Time travel’s a bumpy ride int he best of times, and I’ve never tried this spell on a vamp.” He winked. “First time for everything though, right?”
“You’re all set, hon,” the nurse told Charlie. “And when you get a minute, stop by the station. Doctor Vancour wants to talk to you.”
While Dean’s passion was spellbinding, and the rest of the team’s introduction engaging, the true standout came at the end of the orientation video. In it, the same brunette from before sat on a stool, the audio so attuned that it picked up the tiny pops and clicks her mouth made as she moved it. Noiselessly. An animated graph on one screen showed only tiny spikes as her mouth moved to form words. She only appeared to speak, like somebody might do for a lip-reader.
Dean plucked up a card and scanned it before pocketing it. “Cool,” he said, carefully gathering the pies into his hands. “Thanks. Nice meeting you. And, uh, have a good one,” he said, awkwardly hoisting the pies in Castiel’s direction before turning and walking back towards the party.
Castiel pointed his weapon directly at the man’s heart and smiled cooly. “Don’t scream,” he directed and then nodded at Dean, who loosed the cord.
Castiel drooped. “Dean,” he said out loud. A bright green basil quiche dropped and Castiel caught it and set it impatiently on the coffee table. He moved to type again, trying to ignore the urge to hide the pie. It steamed on the table, a fragrant reminder of the curse. “He might come after you anyway for all that. What should I do? I can leave—”
Dean relaxed in the atmosphere like he’d been born to it. He slung one thumb into the strap of his backpack, jammed with a selection of tradable goods pulled from the Jeep’s storage lockboxes. His other hand rested lightly on his holstered weapon. “Let’s grab a seat at the bar. See what we turn up.”
They wandered together through the crowd as they stripped off salty-sweet battered bacon, aimless and apparently with no intention of joining up with Kevin and Channing anytime soon. Castiel bought them each beer in cheap plastic cups, and they settled in front of another bandstand while a comedian-fiddler duo entertained the crowd. The act shouldn’t have worked; Dean muttered that it was an abomination as they sat down. But they were soon consumed in belly laughs that added a sweet ginger tinge to Castiel’s beer as they drank.
Dean seemed blithely unaware of Castiel’s earth-shaking revelation. “So, that’s it for today. Next time we’re gonna have your vocal profile ready to go, so that’ll be fun. You can head to 302 now and set up the rest of your appointments.” Dean looked apologetic, shrugging and indicating the computer. “Right now this uses a ton of processing power but someday I want to get this all to something about the size of a waist pack, you know? So you can wear it around.” Dean unwrapped the headset from Castiel’s scalp with far less care than he’d taken placing it on. The thin wires combed through his hair, tousling it and Castiel smoothed it without thought. Dean grimaced at the motion. “Yeah, sorry.” He placed the headset on the table and held out his hand in a jarringly formal farewell.
Months later, when Castiel finally trusted her enough to tell her about the childhood curse behind his magic pies, she had even offered to help him find the witch who had done it. Finding the witch was the main reason he’d settled in Maltese instead of hiding away in some quiet, dull suburb on the other side of the country. Castiel had accepted her help with the same sense of constant surprise with which he embraced her friendship. With her help, he’d planned to find the witch, break his curse, and he could live a normal life at last.
Castiel clung to that feeling as he parked and waited for Dean to do the same. Dean’s expression was somber and otherwise unreadable as he got out of his own car and carefully locked it. They walked up the stairs to Castiel’s apartment together. Castiel voiceless and unwilling to produce more pies when he so desperately wanted to be normal. Dean was apparently content to follow him up in silence.
Castiel decided. He advanced on the prisoner carefully, ready to end him quickly and run if this should prove to be a more elaborate trap. “Who are you?”
Castiel tore down the path, leaping over the calf-high rope chain fence that bordered it to shortcut across a pack of terra-sculpted mounds that swelled between himself and the duck pond.
Castiel had always considered himself to be a bit of a recluse, happier on his own than in a crowd. Weeks of isolation paired with the strained intimacy of video meetings in his own home left their mark, however. Arriving home laden with groceries one day, he found himself talking to the cabinets in the kitchen with a feeling approaching desperation.
Charlie seemed to pick up on it too, because she didn’t bother to sit down before demanding, “Did you find her?” Her tone clearly indicated disbelief in whatever assurances Crowley might deliver.
Charlie let her other leg flop down and rolled to her side, sympathy written across her features. “Cas.”
“So long magical quest,” Charlie said at last with a rueful laugh. She deflated against him, half in support and half seeking it, and Castiel did the same.
“A very indecisive one,” Castiel remonstrated. He gestured to the green lawn at large, and the vast expanse of space between his truck and the rest of the party. “You’re keeping my many customers waiting.”
Outside of the market, the street was especially dark, and the lack of lights in the homes suddenly seemed to Castiel to be an indictment of the Night Market’s revelry. They walked down the sidewalk, not touching now.
. Scrubbing a hand through his hair, Dean stepped into the hay-strewn courtyard. Two out of his allotted three nights had passed in the castle, and he’d slept like a swaddled babe through both of them. If he couldn’t manage to stay awake for one more night and learn the secret of the princesses’ terrible exhaustion and nearly daily ruined shoes, he’d be sent to the gallows rather than the altar. And the princesses would go on destroying footwear and men’s lives long after his death.
It had been easier for Dean to leave the life. He’d been wearing thin for years, since before Lucifer’s defeat. One day they’d been offered a deed to a small piece of land in northeastern Kansas by a grateful survivor of a vengeful haunting. To both Castiel’s and Sam’s surprise, Dean had accepted it on the spot. “I’m tired,” he’d explained to them both. “I deserve a rest. We all do.” Sam couldn’t settle down but Castiel steeled himself, like he always did, and took the plunge for Dean. With Dean.
“Loss projections?” Lucifer laughed and the plants seemed to shiver. “Your team delayed a Purgatory strike because of loss projections?”
Mag shoveled the medicine into a bag she’d produced from a hidden pocket. “You don’t seem shocked by magic,” she said, apparently willing to be more open once she had the goods in hand.
“I’m well aware of what dwells in Purgatory: lowly, primordial worms,” Lucifer spat. “Leviathan. Do they plan to resist my rule?”
Regret that he had stopped trying crashed down around Castiel like a tide, then, when he found the bracelet.
He had just finished entering his finely strategized medical history and settled back in one of the waiting chairs, when a door on the far end of the reception area opened and a casually-dressed woman stepped through it. She smiled broadly, pleasant face gleaming when she saw him.
Charging in, Dean found a melee. Three vampires lay in various states of anguished repose on the bed, two with arms held at delicately wrong angles. On the farthest side of the room, Castiel fought against four other monsters, boxed into the sink alcove by the vampires. Each wielded a shining silver angel bade.
Castiel woke abruptly, sweat-sticky and frustrated, with Dean’s name on his lips. He shifted his hips experimentally as awareness returned to him. He was in his bedroom and he was, disappointingly, now awake. Castiel let out a small groan when he found himself twisted in his sheets. He shifted, pulling his hand from where he’d apparently been clumsily groping at his own cock in his sleep, and wriggled to free his arm from the binding sheets. He let out a long, slow, frustrated breath.
“The Winchester’s own private guardian angel? I didn’t know you were still on Earth. We thought Heaven sealed up long ago.”
Something hard and sticky lay there. Castiel picked up the ball of singed dough and hurled it sightlessly at the wall. He heard it crack into the plaster and fracture, pieces of pie spattering to the floor. His mouth tasted like he’d been sucking on firewood, all cinder and char.
Dean rested his hands on his thighs loosely, like he didn’t know what else to do with them. “Cas,” he said in tentative tones.
“That her?” Dean asked, his eyes alight with fiery determination. “I got your back, Cas. Let’s go get her.”
Once outside, he realized that he was shaking. So Crowley knew who he was. He knew about Dean. Hell, he probably knew more about Charlie than Castiel himself did. It was like Castiel had tried to escape a serpent by hiding in a cave, only to find himself face to face with a murderous bear. Worry shivered over his skin and burned pastry lingered on his tongue.
Castiel laughed, and if it was a little wild and high, he didn’t think it was unjustified. “I’d like to try to help you. Move on or…or find your brother. Or whatever it is that’s keeping you here. I guess you’re my quarantine project,” he concluded.
Dean pulled the pie towards himself, brows drawn in serious contemplation. Slowly, deliberately, he reached into the pie plate and scooped a dollop of filling onto his finger. Slowly, deliberately, he moved that finger to his lips, drew it inside, and sucked the cream off the tip.
“Cas,” Dean said and he wrapped his fingers in Castiel’s collar as though to prevent him from fleeing. He looked intent, on a mission, as he said slowly, “You’re all I need. Cursed or not. And that’s not what I wanted. I just wanna hear--”
“It’s s’posed to bring good luck. Bring you your heart’s desire,” Dean spat. “Instead it burned our house down and...and our mom with it.” The fire department said it was just a candle that caught the living room on fire but I-- Me and my dad. We knew the truth. There was purple smoke all around the house, curling out from the door. Magic,” he said. “The color of magic.”
So. Castiel must be perfectly visible as well. He felt his ears warm and dropped his eyes away for a moment, struggling for words when what he really wanted was to touch, taste, feel— He shifted his hips restlessly, and immediately regretted it.
What he found in the Fern Room made his heart sink. The concrete floor was cracked in one long, jagged line which had split the two angel traps on the floor into nothing but ineffective paint. Dean was sprawled at the far end of the room, apparently pinned to the path with Lucifer looming over him.
Castiel tapped the tip of his nose with his finger in appreciation before writing. “You’re special.”
Castiel swallowed and let his eyes slip closed for slow, quiet seconds as Dean’s fingers combed across his scalp.
Castiel tried to push his way past anyway and she gripped his coat and hauled him back, hard. “Sorry, Ariel,” she smirked. “Go dry your fins in the corner. Your turn’s gonna come.”
“Not you,” Castiel said, and it came out like a vow. “That’s not what you’re truly going to get in this world. In your life.” He shook his head slowly, like clearing out cobwebs.
“Dude, I’ve been calling your name for like five minutes.” Her words were irate and impatient, but her lips were puckered in worry. “And you’re not even wearing headphones.”
Castiel felt himself stiffen. He nodded, chin knocking against Dean’s shoulder. Dean let him go and pulled away.
He used to resent his curse for so easily crafting something that otherwise took hours, like making the perfect pastry and filling was nothing - a fruitless exercise. Lately, he’d come to appreciate the differences of craft. Speaking pies into existence was less about creating food and more about...emotion. It was why he recited poetry for many of his magical pies. The words created a heady mix of feelings in him, and his curse translated those feelings into an edible journey for people visiting his truck. Sometimes he thought he could see those emotions play across the faces of people who ate his magical pies, like the pies were merely a transfer medium serving poetry via pie.
When Victor Henriksen called just two weeks later saying he found Sam Winchester, Castiel couldn’t even muster surprise. It seemed so obvious now that he should have made this move months ago.
“Dean.” Castiel started scrolling. “I’ll summarize it for you. Point one,” he emphasized over Dean’s derisive snort. “Ghosts disturb electrical systems.”
“I told everyone you were assigned to my cabin ‘cause you didn’t sleep. So I’d get the place to myself, pretty much. And then later, when you started to pass out I’d tell people I got a bum deal, right? I’m an asshole, Cas.” The words came out broken and when Dean lifted his head, tears shone in the flickering light. “I’m sorry. I needed you there, with me. The whole time, I needed you there. Hell, even when you broke your foot and you were the biggest asshole in camp, you kept me grounded.”
Castiel trailed a finger across Dean’s chest, feather-light. “You’ve concealed pieces of my forest in your cloak. If those pass through the portal, it will close forever.”
Castiel cleared his throat, the sound erupting like sandpaper on steel in the terribly quiet booth. It appeared that he had little choice. And if he was to have any chance of finding the witch, this was their one good lead in years. With trepidation, he spoke. “Pies appear when I speak.” A hard, over-caramelized pecan pie fell from his lips. Castiel caught it out of long practice and set it in the middle of the table. He didn’t know what he was expecting. Shock? Confusion?
Castiel startled in his seat, blinking away from the neon strip lighting that ran along the edge of bowling alley to focus on Dean. He raised his brows questioningly and tried not to let his guilt show on his face.
. “Nah, I had that cooking way before I left town.” Her cheerful demeanor dropped. “But there’s something personal that— That you don’t know about me. And I just couldn’t do it over text.”
Castiel blinked in surprise at the empty space in the garden once occupied by Lucifer, then he raced across the garden.
Castiel read through the sample lines on the tablet, trying to talk around nothing more than air. Cinnamon and blueberry gathered on his tongue. The taste of pepper and egg and sweet raspberry gathered along his teeth. All these almost-words built up the magic inside him, stirring beneath the surface. But he managed to keep his focus.
The words short circuit what’s left of Castiel’s ability to process in the moment, and he’s left with his mouth open, wordless.
“He’s waking up.” There was a pause, as though the news had burst out of Sam uncontrollably. “They’re telling me he’s showing signs of waking and I gotta—“
Castiel glared at Dean, but without ire. It was good to see him smile. Good to see him laugh, even if it was edged in derision. Instead, he tipped his chin up, raised an eyebrow, and stalked to the back of the store. “Paolo swore that most of ‘em had it. Maybe it’s an east coast thing. We’re in Ohio now. That’s getting close.” Castiel ignored Dean sarcastically parroting this behind his back. He’d been given this tip by a very earnest hunter who’d worked stints at a few different Gas ‘n’ Sip locations when he’d needed to make some quick cash between hunts. In the stations Paulo had worked at, they’d kept lock boxes as part of an opiate and other prescription “safe returns” program. They were kept locked away in hidden back closets, unmarked and uninteresting.
“I’m just trying to help you, darling. With your ghost problem? Are things still going bump in the night? And not in a good way, if you know what I mean.”
Castiel let the deeper cold of Dean’s fingers wrap over his and guide his grip around the ripe avocado.
Dean’s look was intensely sorrowful, but he lifted his finger to Castiel’s cheek. He traced the faint scar there, skin still angry from his wound when the kitchen exploded. “I gotta. I’m losing myself a little more every damn day. Some day— I don’t want to—”
. When he collapsed again, it was with a sleepy smile. “Wanted you to have as much time as possible with her before the solstice.”
Castiel swallowed hard, then looked at Dean. He cocked his head to one side and held up the card with a crease in his brow, his heart ricocheting for a very different reason now.
Castiel vowed. He opened his mouth to say as much when Dean flashed again. This time he crouched over the coffee table, where his hand passed right through the remote.
Castiel heaved a long breath and looked away, torn and utterly without a good excuse. He could say Charlie needed his help with something, although Dean knew Charlie was gone for the next three weeks. Castiel would have to become a hermit to keep up the pretense that he’d gone with her, and that seemed exhausting. Dean curled his hand over Castiel’s thigh, thumb running soothingly along the outer seam of his jeans. “Hey,” he said, gently. “I know you don’t like to talk about family. And holidays are hard. I get that. But maybe it’s time to start some new family traditions. Better ones. I’ll even make sure we keep a lid on the prank wars this year.” Dean stared at him, fingers tightening. “Please? Come with me?”
Jackson disappeared in a fireball that belched black smoke over the city, eating away the sky and the buildings behind them.
“Don’t knock it ’til you try it.” Dean shook his head, his arm relaxing and the chill in the room easing. “So sticky, though. Ugh. That’s probably why Sam went on a health kick as a teen. That kid packs away a salad like I tackle a steak. I kept telling him. Sam, you’re growing. You need some meat!”
HIs growing reputation meant that more difficult-to-help customers were beginning to find him. He’d met a woman in the morning who’d been battling a tumor. Castiel had promised to do his best to help her, even if it was just to ease her suffering during treatment. The potential of Amara’s gift boggled his mind. He got the sense that he was only scratching the surface of what he might be able to achieve through it.
Gamrit is still panting from the fight, but she nods obediently. If she has any questions, she knows she doesn’t have enough rank to voice them. Castiel is busy - he’s the leader of the resistance, after all.
“Sorry, it’s been a crazy morning. Look, I don’t mean to be rude, but I’ve gotta call back the hospital this morning before I head in to work and—“
“You happen to know somebody that I would like to know better.” He rested his chin on his hand and smiled up through his eyelashes. “One Dean Winchester, FutureTech lackey.”
They all looked down at the woman on the bed. Thin tubes ran into her, giving her air and food. “So how does she eat it?” Dean asked, voicing what they were all thinking.
The night was cold; the open jeep offered little warmth aside from being drier than the ground. Dean snapped a bedroll from the kit bolted over the wheel well in the back and opened it up. “I’ll keep watch first,” he said, tossing the blanket at Castiel. “You get some sleep and we’ll figure our shit out in the morning.”
Slowly, Dean shook his head. “I mean…things back on Earth feel fuzzy. Distant, you know? Like I’m looking back on everything through those old glass insulators we used to pick up when Sammy and I walked the rail line out by Bobby’s.” He shrugged. “It’s hard to focus, but I think I’d remember that.” A grin crept back onto his face. “You saying we all own a bar together? Or just… you and me. Partners.” The word sounded beautiful. Perfect. It was the perfect opening to finally tell Cas—
Castiel nodded slowly, though the ache seemed to melt away at Dean’s touch, replaced by static anticipation. He closed his eyes as Dean began to work his hands along his spine, curving strong fingers over the musculature of his shoulders and running knuckles down the ridges of his spine. For his part, Dean was silent. Nothing but the press of his hands and his breathing described his presence until Dean paused to mutter, “Hold on.”
“Awww.” She leveled him with her most unrelenting stare. “Isn’t Dean special?” At Castiel’s nod, she said, “So why not trust him?”
A bolt of jealousy fueled Dean’s next words. “So the lies above. The deaths at Harroway of men like me. Those don’t matter to you?” He grabbed at Castiel’s wrists and held his hands away.
In so many ways, it was incredible, like every fantasy Castiel had ever entertained about normalcy had been supercharged. With his heightened joy, however, came increased anxiety.
Castiel sat on the stoop and breathed it all in, enjoying the hum of insects until his ears finally picked up the sound he’d been waiting for: the deep rumble of Dean’s car.
Wind picked up the room. “I can feel it. Knowing that’s there. It’s like I finally get to read the end of a book.”
Crowley’s eyes gleamed, guessing his question. “A magician never reveals his secrets.” He chuckled. In the corner, one of the suited lackeys leaned in to whisper to the other and they both laughed.
Dean pulled him towards a low stone wall covered in soft, green moss. Castiel sat next to him, conscious of the distance between them. He flipped his tablet onto one knee. “That was rude,” he wrote pointedly. “And embarrassing.”
Castiel eyed the dank interior warily. The walls were painted black where they weren’t old chipped wood paneling, and roughly hewn boards had been added around the booths ringing the room like a shoddy attempt at creating a conference center’s business stations. He could see figures moving inside the little sheltered booths and wondered what deals were brokered there. What threats were made.
Arriving at Sam Winchester’s house on Thanksgiving felt like a slice of someone else’s life. Sam and Eileen welcomed him into their home with all the aplomb of greeting long-lost family, helping him to juggle the three pies he’d brought above an over-excited dog and their child, Avery. They made an odd crew: a small child, an excited dog, two mostly silent adults, and Sam Winchester towering over them all and bellowing a conversation back and forth with his brother to “Move all your sh--. I mean, stuff, Dean. Make some room on the counter!”
Dean was down on the ground, moving feebly. He looked towards Castiel with hooded eyes, slipping towards unconsciousness. Heaving himself upright on one arm only had the effect of toppling him to sprawl along the stone path, rather than the wall.
“The vamp. She was some chick we tried to save years ago. We got there too late and she turned monster, and apparently was preying on people ever since.” Shaking his head, the bliss of Heaven was momentarily dulled by Dean’s soft disappointment. “All those people. All those kids over the years. If only we’d stopped her right then, you know?”
“Dean!” Castiel shouted. The pie falling from his lips startled the guard and she took a steadying step back and whipped out her gun, leveling it at his head.
Seeking perfection for Castiel used to be cultivating prowess in battle and following the Heavenly plan precisely. After Heaven sealed him in the ruins of the mortal world, Castiel thought that perfection was an impossibility, a fool’s dream. Now, he thought he could see perfection in single moments, in spans of time measurable and fleeting. This was one such moment.
Castiel took deep, shuddering breaths, trying to calm down. The nightmare still chased him - the bliss so closely followed by horror. He squeezed his eyes shut and clamped his mouth tight and tried to will himself to normalcy again. He passed a shaking hand through his sweat-dampened hair before dropping it to his chest.
His building was poorly situated to show him the door. The upper floors had half balconies that adorned the front of the building - pretty but unable to bear weight. Still, Castiel was tempted to slide open the window and inch out to try to dangle over the edge. However, at four floors up that seemed like asking for injury. As deeply awful as his day had been, he wasn’t that low.
Castiel tried calling out for Dean the rest of the afternoon. Night fell, died, and rose again as a new day. Still, Dean didn’t reappear in the house. There were no cool breezes, no unexplained chills. Just one house, echoing with the pacing of its lone occupant. That morning, Castiel went for a walk.
“Right,” Crowley said once Castiel passed into earshot. He sounded as pleased as a tiger at a game-filled pond. “Now that we’re all here, let’s discuss the terms of our agreement.”
Like he was obeying a general’s orders, Dean gasped, “Fuck, Cas. That’s so fucking good. Your body, feeling you—“ He ran a hand along Castiel’s hip and slid it over the curve of his ass, pulling at him. “You feel so good. So good to me.” He continued his litany of praise, sweet and low, and Castiel thought he might burn from it. He painted Dean with kisses and the strokes of his hands and the slide of his body. When their cocks slid together, Dean’s words faltered with a delighted intake of breath.
Castiel drank him in, this spirit trapped in his home, gracing his home like a living, breathing presence.
Beside him, his laptop flickered. The planchette slid to YES. Horror swamped Castiel so thoroughly that it gave him strength. This time, Castiel kept his fingers on the teardrop.
Dean sank into Castiel’s touch greedily, still so hungry after so many years of want between them. “Yeah,” he rumbled. “You’re right. Love you, Cas.”
Castiel, through long practice, drank his own searing drink stone-faced before settling back to beckon the bartender over. “We’re looking for some information,” he said quietly. “About a ship that might be on the lakes. We need to talk to someone who knows the water.”
“Stuck with the pies,” Castiel said aloud, a congealed custard pie emerging. “Stuck with him too,” he said and couldn’t help the grin that spread, or the sweet raspberry pie that emerged. Charlie caught the raspberry pie and added it to her collection, then grabbed the custard and launched it over the side to the fallow lot below.
The young man sitting there greeted him with an earnest grin and the slightest twinge of a southern accent. “Heya, welcome to FutureTech. How can I help you?” Castiel pulled out the card and slid it across, fingering his tablet with his other hand. What should he even say?
Digging through the memory, Castiel saw the chain of events through Amara’s eyes. “So my pies can...heal?” The pie that emerged was just as wobbly as his understanding.
Castiel opened his eyes again. Forced them to focus. He was lying on his side at the edge of the circle, collapsed over one of the crystals. On the opposite side, hunched under the tall workbench, a white-suited figure wrapped a gentle hand around Dean’s shoulder.
“You’ll have to read through these agreements, sign them with your finger, and then bring them back to me. Then I’ll get you settled at one of our kiosks--” the man gestured to a bank of computers with blue lit keyboards lined up on a tall counter. “We’ll have some questionnaires for you to fill out before you meet with Hannah, our speech therapist.”
Charlie gulped and Castiel laughed a little hysterically. Dean clapped a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and gripped him there. When the doctor left, they were allowed to head back up to the room to clear up their things.
Charlie looked relieved at this. “You will? Thanks. Thanks, Cas.” She blinked rapidly and looked away, breathing a little too deliberately to not be crying just a little.
Slowly, with no rebuke apparent, Castiel held Dean closer. He dipped his nose low, burying his face against the curve of Dean’s neck, and breathed in the scent of him deeply. Was it possible that he might still have this? Could he be so lucky as to keep Dean, even after all the events of the past twelve hours.
“Why would you help us?” Castiel asked, flexing his hand and feeling the sigil burn as his skin stretched over his knuckles.
As soon as they emerged, they could practically taste the fair on the air. It was salt and buttered popcorn, it was roasting meat and open flame, and music so loud that it broke apart against the buildings into high notes and low bass thrums. Underneath it all was the sweet, rotten smell of the Equinox and the chatter of insects before cold cast them back into the earth. It was overwhelming, and it stunned them all to reverent silence.
Dean reached out a hand to Castiel’s face. Now it was free of the bruises and cuts the guards had inflicted on him earlier. His fingertip brushed along his jaw in wonder and Castiel sucked in a sharp breath, drawing out of reach. His hand raised to his cheek where Dean had touched him, his eyes wide as though Dean had leaned forward and branded him with a kiss. Castiel dropped his eyes, before taking a trailing look from Dean’s thighs to the sweep of his brow. “You wear my cloak well,” he said warmly.
The treadmill stopped flowing almost instantly and Castiel felt his knees try to buckle at the unplanned change of pace. He instinctively grabbed for the bars and leaned heavily on them, glaring at his interruptor.
Castiel felt sweat break out in a cold flush along his arms and neck, steadying himself for the tornado of Dean lost again in a rage, uncontrolled.
with a satisfying finality in Lucifer’s shoulder, flaring bright white where it bit into his body. Lucifer turned with a snarl, throwing his arm up towards Castiel.
Castiel shrugged. “It’s not all bad,” he wrote, making several choices at once. As Dean watched him, Castiel let a grin grow. “I got you in a dark street all to myself.”
The electrical room is dark, but they find Zoriel there, hiding like a rat in a cellar. With that warmth burning a hole into him, Castiel dispatches her in a flash of power and char. Wiping a fleck of blood from his forehead, he tells Gamrit, “I need to go. Clean this up.”
Castiel pulled his tablet in so he could balance it easily and still cradle Dean’s hand as he wrote. “What happened back there?”
The sun paints dancing parallelograms on the fabric-covered bus seats as it twists along the looping ridge-side road. This close, the angel tablet feels intoxicating, like lips against his ear. Castiel wants to press into it.
Charlie smiled sympathetically. “Too good? In an ‘oh god it’s gonna fall apart’ kinda way?” Castiel nodded. “Been there. Done that.”
Crowley stared at Castiel and only at Castiel. He let silence stretch between them like taffy. When he finally spoke, it was with quiet control and a not-quite-disguised lilt of glee. “Who says that dumb witch is the only one with a little magic up her sleeve?” He smirked at Castiel, then tweaked at the cuff of his jacket demonstratively.
“Nah, gotta wait around for Kevin and Channing.” Dean sighed and slumped down, arms balanced on his knees. He stared at the sidewalk for some time before rolling his chin to look at Castiel. “Besides, I was having fun.” He looked at Castiel steadily. “Sorry if I ruined the night for you.”
When Castiel opened his eyes, it was to find Dean still standing next to him. He raised his hand to invite Dean to sit on his couch, feeling suddenly stiff and formal. And then Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel and pulled him close.
Searching Sam Winchester’s name pulled up a probate court legal notice for claims against the estate of a John Winchester from earlier in the year - Sam’s father, according to the notice. With a new name to search, finding news articles about the car crash was far too easy.
Castiel shrugged. “This barrier-busting spell is old. I haven’t used it in...about six hundred years. Give or take. I’d be hesitant to improvise new ingredients.”
Clacking heels resounded in the hallway and moments later, two more well-dressed individuals entered the room. Their former prisoner stepped towards the newcomers and cleared his throat. “Davis. Bevell.”
As he latched the canopy to the side of the truck, Castiel caressed it. Now Honey Pies had a greater purpose, and a community which seemed well on its way to embracing both normal and magical wares fully, if the burgeoning magical markets were any indication.
Sighing and not bothering to conceal his amusement, Castiel turned his back to her in a side stretch. Turned towards the window, he looked out over the city. Late afternoon sun filtered the buildings beyond into a harvest color wheel. Green leaves framed Maltese like fading emeralds, red, gold, and brown taking their place. Fall slid into the city swiftly and Castiel let himself fantasize for a moment about curling up in front of a winter scene with Dean, talking quietly together as the snow fell and beyond, lights twinkling like stars. He could have that future.
Once they’d hatched their wild plan to try to help Charlie’s mother however, Dean had suggested seeking out Amara to learn more about control and the limits of her gift. Charlie had put out feelers. There were rumors that Amara still roamed the city.
Dean couldn’t help, but he guided Castiel through cutting into his walls, cautioning him about electrical lines and insulation, and laughing at him when Castiel recoiled from ancient newspaper spilling from the wall cavities.
“I used to make this for Sammy. For a while we lived down around Chula Vista,” Dean said as Castiel was preparing dinner. “No,” he paused with a sharp laugh. “You’ll crush ‘em before you even get started.”
“Cas.” The way this younger Dean says his name is soft and sorrowful, and so far past the sharp demand he used so long ago in that first stormy year. The nickname falls like folded rose petals in the space between them. “Cas,” Dean says again, reaching out. Castiel flinches backward, and Dean drops his hand. A lopsided smile lights his face, entirely unlike anything Castiel has ever managed to deserve.
“I love you.” Castiel slid his hand to encircle Dean’s cheek, fingertips trailing the stubble along his throat.
The ghost turned up his hands and his jaw dropped with shock. Then his mouth snapped shut and he rolled his eyes. “Ya think, genius?”
“You need more? I thought we’d get a couple hours under our belts before we stop for dinner but we can grab something on the way.”
Castiel directed him another five miles to the driveway he’d spotted. They turned down the empty, overgrown lane. Long grasses and thick, fat forbs thwacked the undercarriage like insistent fingers rapping on the car.
“Good,” Lucifer said. And after another moment, he whirled on the demon, who still stood in a stilted half bow. “Well?” The demon raced off towards the front exit. Lucifer pushed a hand roughly through Sam’s hair and scowled up at the ceiling.
“It’s a...pink lemonade pie,” Castiel explained as he nudged the pie box towards Dean, top flap open. When it had manifested, Castiel had surveyed it skeptically. That apparently was a ‘do you wanna go out with me’ pie. It was pink. Very pink. The whipped filling resembled nothing short of a cloud and the curse had even concocted tiny little flamingo-pink sprinkles in the shape of martini glasses.
“Do you have…” What was the line? “Unfinished business?” The pointer hovered in the middle of the board. “Um, guessing that means you don’t know? Did this Sam Winchester guy…did he…” Castiel paused. Did he really want to know this? “Did he kill you?”
Magic permeated Harroway, wrapped around Dean, and soaked down into the chambers beneath the royal apartments. Dean had expected the hatchway to open up into the long, dark throat of the palace. But the winding staircase was neither close nor dark. Instead, light assaulted his eyes. A forest gleamed as far as he could see on either side of the steps, and the ceiling was flecked with light as though by stars.
“Oh, well in that case...farewell, Dean. I’m off to fight monsters.” Castiel stood and dusted futilely at his jeans.
His phone rang, loud in the quiet courtyard. Castiel fumbled it out of his pocket and with a full body jolt, saw Sam Winchester’s name on the display. He immediately pressed it to his ear. “Sam?”
Dean grabbed a fistful of Castiel’s shirt, hauling him back to join him in the center of the kitchen. He handed him a knife and a bundle of celery, silently conscripting him into cooking. Castiel happily following suit. “The Sleep Rite Inn,” Dean pronounced, finely chopping rosemary. “And that was because I tried making it in a toaster oven. A whole, full size pie,” Dean said to Castiel. “Like, the entire size of this tiny ass toaster oven.”
When Dean pulled away, Castiel’s thoughts were scattered like dandelion down across a vast field. Dean’s tongue slid along his lower lip, his eyes were wide, his breathing hard. Dean looked scared.
“Charlie’s busy this year,” Castiel wrote. “So this is perfect.” And it was true. Charlie had told him a few weeks ago that she couldn’t make Thanksgiving and that she would, in fact, be out of the city for most of November. She’d refused to tell Castiel why, and he’d been afraid to pry at it too hard. He knew what it felt like to let a secret loose before it was ready to be shared.
Castiel had earned a reputation in this city over the last couple of years, grateful to discover that his baking seemed to do the talking for him. Even with private events, like this one, there were usually at least one or two customers who had visited his food truck at least once before. Repeat customers often did Castiel’s proselytizing work for him, and as the attendance at today’s function swelled, Castiel found his truck’s patronage grew in proportion.
When Dean recovered he flipped them so that they lay on their sides, Dean loose in his movement but intent. He closed his fist around Castiel and held him close with his other arm, fingers splayed across his back. Castiel reveled in the all-over sensations and being held so tightly by someone he adored.
Castiel watched Dean track the pie from his lips to the counter, and so he saw the exact moment his relationship with Dean died. A shadow passed over Dean, brows knitting. Dean’s voice dropped low as he asked, “Is this magic? Are you a...a witch?”
Castiel nipped at Dean’s mouth. “You’ll have to wash me off later. But for now, I was promised pie.” He inhaled the fragrance coming from the kitchen. “Pumpkin?”
Once settled in the back seat, Charlie rested her elbows on the seat cushion between Dean and Castiel. “So, we’re ready for this, right? Tomorrow’s the solstice. Do we have everything we need?”
Castiel nodded solemnly at her and wrapped an arm around her shoulder in comfort. Charlie had returned a week ago with a shadow behind her smile, and excuses when he probed at her absence. She’d been cagey over texts up until then. He’d been worried and that worry had started to sour his pies if he dwelled on it too much. If he’d been working hard at any one life lesson, it was the importance of addressing problems before they became insurmountable.
“Goodbye,” Dean said simply, and could not bear to meet Castiel’s eyes before he turned away. The branches in the cloak’s inner pocket scratched against his heart as he slunk across the palace grounds into the shallow boats, and stole across the water with the twelve bedraggled princesses.
The man gasped roughly, coughed once, and then reached up to straighten his tie. “Who are you, and what are you doing on this ship?”
A sharp breeze whipped around Castiel, kissing his cheek with frost. “Okay, are you trying to contact him? To, to move on maybe?”
The lights were on in the hallway, casting a firm yellow light across the foot of his bed as Castiel climbed under the covers. He lay there for a long time, whiskey souring his stomach and adrenaline still spiking whenever he relaxed enough to feel like he was falling asleep.
In the seconds while Dean’s body was in flight and Lucifer had craned Sam’s neck impossibly long to track it, Castiel pulled out his own Plan B.
Castiel thought at him like a prayer. He nodded once at Dean, and then slapped his chest with his bloodied hand while Dean did the same.
“Pumpkin spice this far from fall? Daring.” Dean tapped a nail on the glass. “And yes, that is absolutely up my alley. One of those, please.” He rocked back on his heels to look up at Castiel. “Business good?”
Below them, ringing the hill, the nearest town appeared to be abandoned. At this time of year, with chill cutting the air, usually they’d expect to see at least some sign of life: smoke from a cooking fire or someone moving in open areas, trying to eke out some semblance of agricultural survival in the quiet, sunlit time. Down below, the buildings sat cold and gray.
“Not exactly? But mostly, yeah.” He raised a finger. “Two peach pies. One would be for me. The other’s to bribe my buddy Benny — he’s the DJ.” Dean pointed to a burly man frowning seriously at an equipment-laden table on the edge of the green. “Gotta get him to play something cooler than whatever party mix he promised corporate. And your tropical medley’s been on my mind for the last hour.” He looked up at Castiel through his eyelashes.
As summer faded away to the heart of autumn, he and Dean slipped into something like a routine. Castiel still worked odd hours at his truck, baking early, cleaning late, and filling much of his time with special events. But now the rest of the time - those quiet solitary, lonely hours he’d had before were now filled with Dean.
“Sam moved out, in case you didn’t notice. What, did he leave behind my Zepp posters? My record collection? My car? ‘Cause I sure as hell only see your shit in here.”
he thought while his heart tried to flee his body. He would be able to talk whenever he wanted. Sing in the shower without clogging the drain. He’d be able to take Dean’s hands in his own and tell him how he felt in his own voice. He would be free to love and be loved by somebody like Dean. There was so much to gain, it was hard to imagine what he’d have to lose.
Water ripples soundlessly around them, driven by an illogical wind. Castiel wants to drop to the dock and wrap his arms around his legs. He could close his eyes. Maybe Dean would accept his presence here as just another illogical chunk of dream and Castiel could lose himself here, in Dean’s calm retreat. If he didn’t know other angels could pry into dreams, maybe he would.
“Non-human? We have an enchantment laid on the ship that’s rather indestructible - even from your little assault on her primary shield. It latches onto monsters - non-humans - from the moment they come aboard.” She reached into her blouse and pulled out a large silver locket. Opening it, she moved it between Dean and Castiel. The interior glowed brightly, but dimmed noticeably any time it passed near Dean. Next to Castiel, it glowed solar-white. “Forgive me, but monsters cannot be trusted under any circumstances. Winchester, I think we can work together but this...thing...cannot be a part of this.”
He tried to convey that through the iron hold of his arms and his whuff of relief whispered softly across Dean’s nape.
“Well, I have always had a fondness for a guppy,” Crowley said with a wide smile. “I’ve been looking into you,
The south entrance was a steel archway sculpted into vines, with old forks, soup spoons, and garden tools hacked apart and welded into flowers. Somebody had hung little canvas squares along the arch, painted with mystical beasts twining around letters that spelled out N-I-G-H-T M-A-R-K-E-T. Beyond the archway, holiday lights twinkled in every color, some strung neatly in angles around windows and doors and others cast haphazardly to dangle down the sheer brick walls like spilling yarn.
Dean raises his eyebrows expectantly, one hand braced against the ground and a knee poised to stand. Castiel deflates. “Fine.” One hand fumbles for his pocket and then flutters away - an old habit that came back to him when Dean found him. Like his hand has no control and must be contained or it will reach out and—
“But you’re the one who did it!” Dean protested. Amara shrugged in seeming helplessness. “What about true love?” Dean asked.
. Achieving a technically perfect pie, or coming up with a gorgeous new recipe gave Castiel the kind of high that can only come from hard work and the slower path to perfection.
“So much was broken. And the bracelet? I didn’t see it again.” Dean gasped and wind sloughed through the room. “There were holes in the walls, Cas. I punched holes in the walls. Sammy got ‘em patched up and then—”
Hannah led him down the corridor to a room a little bigger than a closet. Mirrors took up one wall; Castiel suspected they were two way mirrors, having been in his share of research rooms. He kept his expression neutral, therefore, when she settled him at a desk set in front of an open laptop. A video was freeze-framed on the screen.
Castiel felt his chin tremble and he closed his eyes so he wouldn’t have to see Dean when he said, “How should we do this?”
Up close, Dean looked worse, pale skin standing sharply against the sigil on his chest. But his chest rose and fell softly. Dean was alive, and Castiel’s vision sparked at a nearly overwhelming rush of relief.
A pink flush suffused her cheeks and she was just opening her mouth to deliver a no-doubt sparking reply when another person entered.
Castiel grasped his palm automatically, and shook it slowly. Their hands warmed together; Dean’s fingers wrapped around his own felt incredible. Castiel bobbed his head in a slow nod before releasing Dean’s hand and pulling up his own tablet from his lap. “Thank you,” he wrote.
If anyone else of limited acquaintance had said that to Castiel, he would have changed the subject quickly, taken his leave, and tried to forget about it. But Dean had said the word
Castiel hid inside his truck; he sat on his little folding stool with gloved hands held in a cradling position four inches from the cleft of his chin. He spoke clearly in the quiet truck, his voice deep and sure. Neruda’s words rolled off his tongue and formed substance.
Castiel pictured the vat holding the ice cream, remembering the way it smoked lavender in the chill evening. A modicum of understanding stole over him. That must have been what set Dean rigid in the middle of the market. “I’m sorry about your mother,” he wrote.
Castiel thought with amusement, only becoming flustered when Dean insisted on using his own tokens to purchase them each a fried treat.
When they arrived in the bedroom, Dean fastened the cook kit to his pack carefully and then closed the door, pulling a chair to rest under the doorknob. Several objects clattered from his hand and, by the light of his flashlight, Castiel watched Dean light three small, squat candles on the dresser. Dean extinguished the match with a quick flourish and turned to Castiel. “C’mon. Shirt off. Lay down.” His tone was gruff, but he seemed...strange, somehow. Dean wouldn’t meet Castiel’s gaze, busying himself instead with dropping to his knee and untying his boots.
Room 302 gleamed with warm, rose-tinted wood set against creamy walls. It was like stepping into a strawberry ice cream cone. A receptionist greeted him with a brilliant smile and Castiel drew out his license and Dean’s card again, presenting them without comment. The man took them with a pert nod, entered something into his computer, and then handed them back across the desk with a tablet. He reached across the desk and tapped a button on the tablet, opening up what looked like a lengthy legal disclaimer. “Welcome. We’ve been expecting you,” he said warmly. Castiel started at that; he hadn’t told Dean that he’d changed his mind. Instead, he’d shown up half hoping to be turned away, like building security might make the decision for him instead. But the receptionist was already moving on just as the relaxed security guard had forged onward downstairs.
We watched three of those movies while you were following up on that California lead on the Colt.” Castiel shook his head. “Humans have a real knack for gallow’s humor.” He started back up the steep, weedy bank.
Dean refused to look back at him, instead focusing on Amara. “True love’s kisses. How do those work?”
“Where?” Castiel growled, and he flipped his blade in his hand, twirling it so it pointed directly at the demon’s chest. “I’ll make it quick,” he promised.
Disappointment sunk like a stone, quickly followed by fear as a more horrible scenario sprang to mind. He’d heard the rumors of a task force that traveled the city and prosecuted magic users. Maybe they’d found him. Maybe Crowley had finally tipped them off. Or maybe Dean--
Eyes still closed, Castiel eased the Rilke-inspired sunken cottage pie away from his lips and placed it on the bedside table. He’d heat up some coffee and eat it for breakfast; sturdy fare for a long day ahead. He ran his tongue along his teeth, examining the first warm flavor of fall. It was autumn today. Officially, at least. The Equinox marked the end of summer, but looking ahead, Castiel felt a little bit like he was staring at the sun.
“Hey, a girl can dream. Fresh cherries every year and all mine? Ours, I guess.” She settled back on her elbows again and rummaged in the bag of cherries sitting open between them. It was late and the moon had risen over the tops of the buildings, bathing the city in silver and shadow.
Castiel took a deep, shuddering breath in the suddenly quiet kitchen. “Here goes everything,” he murmured as the kitchen warmed quickly in the sunlight.
They hesitated outside the archway, looking at each other with more than a hint of nerve. All, that is, except for Channing. She surveyed them with amusement, then proffered her arm to Kevin. “The band I want to see starts soon on the First Street crossroad,” she said. “Who’s coming?” She glanced at Dean and Castiel.
There’s blood smeared down one white wall, dark red except where fumbling fingertips scraped it thin. There, it’s brown, and shows the path of the hand clearly as it traveled down to the floor. The angel’s body is gone, but the blood of Castiel's dead soldier remains as a warning. Castiel grips his blade and feels it sing against his palm.
A hand, warm and broad, rested on his shoulder. Dean sucked in a startled breath and whirled to face…
“I’ll kiss my way up your— Your gorgeous thighs. Fuck, they’re just so… And then I’ll spend some time there in that hollow between your leg and your— Do you want me to touch you?”
With a grimace, Castiel wrote, “I barely made it past the door. I overheard someone talking about the ‘most powerful witch.’ I asked them about her.”
Despite what his baser instincts screamed at him, Castiel started to talk to the ghost as he went about his day. “No word yet from Sam,” he’d tell his refrigerator. “Nothing yet,” he’d say consolingly to his bookshelf. “Leave my computer alone,” he’d tell the kitchen at large any time he stepped away from work.
Guilt lays low in his bowels and Castiel slips a wary hand to his abdomen before dropping it to his side again, a momentary lapse. He should not be standing here, doubting God’s plan. Dean Winchester is a part of a hedge that must be clipped, but Castiel would rather see him - would rather see everyone - making their own brief butterfly flashes against the sky.
Hauling himself over the side of the ship at last, Castiel expected ambush. Instead, he discovered that the ladder led to the top of a long wall which ringed a massive, nearly windowless central cabin. The cabin appeared to run nearly the length of the ship, its exterior punctuated with bleating red lights which had been no doubt triggered by their barrier busting spell. On the foredeck, a strange smokeless fire raged, licking at the building with purple flame and sending peeling bits of smoldering wall into the air.
“I could. But some things are worth it.” Their gazes tangled like clinging vines, until shouting from the kitchen yard stirred them.
Charlie grabbed his hand and squeezed it. “Hey, we just walk away, okay? It’ll be fine. We didn’t make any kind of deal. So, he knows who you are. So what? The guy’s just a bunch of empty threats. We’ll find another way, Cas.” As they drove away, Castiel tried to make himself believe that was true.
Castiel slid his tablet from his pocket. “I think I am too.” He screwed up his face in an uncertain fashion.
“Good! Finally.” Charlie nodded in satisfaction. “Were we right? Did they know her?” Her gaze flicked across his creased brow and the lines of tension draw around his mouth. The merriment faded from her eyes. Castiel looked away, back down at his tablet. He might not be able to speak his mind, but Charlie always was able to read volumes in his expressions. “Shit. What happened?”
Castiel thrust into his hand, against Dean who undulated against him in return. They settled into a rhythm of mounting power, static building in their bones and buzzing under their skin. Words fled, the air resounding with the sound of sliding skin and gasping breaths.
“Wanna come with me then? Um. Me and Kevin, that is. I’ve never been and Kevin asked me if I would go with him because he’s never been and someone’s gotta look after the kid and--” Dean stopped speaking abruptly and grimaced. “Sorry. Rambling.”
There was always a steady flow of regulars and newcomers at his cart, and he was usually busy enough that he could retreat into a meditative state of near-silence as he served people pie, ran cards, or made change. It was a steady life. Nobody stayed too long; they didn’t want their food to get too cold or too warm or too sticky or stale. Castiel himself was a passing novelty, a stamp in a stranger’s passport.
After so many years of struggling against the magic inside himself, nurturing and exploring it felt like a revelation. There were so many ways to speak - for communication, for joy, by computer or voice - and now he was learning to speak for a greater purpose.
Castiel shook his head, not sure if he was denying his own foolish nightmares or accepting his friend’s solidarity. He pulled his legs up into a butterfly stretch and breathed into it for a moment, gathering his thoughts. Then he looked at her seriously, wishing he could convey everything right then: all his worry and frustration tangled up with the absolute joy he’d experienced under the concentrated spotlight of Dean’s attention. Her face was open, eyes wide and imploring him to talk to him. The question he had for her weighed on him, but he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t been thinking about it since the morning after the Market.
“I settled at Chitaqua to watch the world burn, Dean.” Castiel dropped his eyes. “I gave up. I know it wasn’t easy sharing a space with me.”
“Sir,” a frightened voice replied. “We made it through the portal and, just like you told us to, we planted the crystals. But there’re things there… Creatures. Ancient and--.”
Memories of leviathan tickle his skull. Balthazar, Hannah, Inias, Rachel and others engage him in rounds of circular talk, accusations and unheard apologies. Memories of Dean envelope him entirely, as he knew they would. He may have addressed one of his long-standing regrets before the Empty slid in and sucked him away, but ten years has generated plenty of other wrong turns.
After another moment of hesitation, Castiel sighed and picked up the package. He brought it inside and opened it up, tipping out the contents and breaking down the box for recycling before washing his hands. Ritual complete, he returned to the package on the counter.
The pointer interrupted his rambling, sliding away and centering itself on the board as though it were waiting for Castiel. “You said ‘Sam,’” Castiel began again. “Sammy? Did you know the person who lived here?”
“Tough,” Castiel said gently, drawing abreast of the ghost. He passed his hand over Dean’s shoulder - through Dean’s shoulder. “I want to hold you. And I need you to get better for that.”
“You fucking better,” Dean said, voice tight. He pocketed the golden egg without further protest, and when the demons attacked, Dean cut his way through the nearest one and ran back down the path, shouting for Lucifer. Two demons peeled off after him, but Castiel couldn’t worry about them now. Nine demons grinned at him, armed with knives or trowels. Two of them bore the telltale silver gleam of a purloined angel blade and Castiel watched them closely.
Ketch’s gaze grew cooler. “You’ll need me along,” he grunted. “Our ship is warded. No mere hunters can get inside.” He tossed out the word “hunter” like it was refuse. Gunfire echoed in the hallway. The fighting had arrived at their level at last. “Uncuff me and let’s go,” he said shortly.
“You know what? We’re good.” It was Charlie’s turn to tug at Castiel’s arm but Castiel held fast, fixed in place and wanting to hear Crowley’s offer, at least.
Castiel laughed at him. “Yeah, I guessed that,” he said easily, the headset wires tickling his temples and his voice coming from the computer’s speakers. “But it’s a nice summer pie. Light, sweet, and a little sour.”
Castiel laughed and shook his head forcefully. The prospect of a public class was an alarming one and he let the proposal fade the same way he did with suggestions that he open his own restaurant, or author a cookbook. He ignored the suggestion entirely and directed his attention to whatever distraction presented itself. In this case, he looked meaningfully at Dean, hoping to catch his eye and deflect Kevin’s line of conversation.
Dean drew out the bundle Castiel had shoved into his hands. When Dean had found a safe place to hide after fleeing the guards, he’d shaken out the bundle to find that he’d been given a cloak. Now, he let it ripple free and wrapped it over his shoulders, drawing up the hood. When he stood, the cloth pooled to the floor like a spilling fountain.
Through gritted teeth, Bevell assented to the older woman’s commands and half the soldiers left alongside the two women. The others roughly took hold of Castiel and Dean, quickly divesting them of weapons before pushing them ahead of them. Davies and the soldiers escorted Dean and Castiel deeper into the ship
The ballroom was easily the largest room Dean had ever seen. Still, milling revelers filled the place, at times so thick as to obscure the swirling dancers carving patterns across the floor. Dean stood in the doorway as the princesses joined the dancing, and laughed. “An enchanted palace under the castle,” he said, as giddy disbelief threatened to overwhelm him at last. “Unbelievable.” He patted his cloak and the twigs and leaves pressed against his chest, firm proof of the strange place beneath the princesses’ chamber. He hoped it would be enough to convince the king that he was telling the truth. Surely at the very least, these spare twigs were a fine dowry, even for one as poor as himself.
The woman approached, hands poised perfectly on her hips. She made an elaborate show of sizing Dean up and down before shrugging. “I suppose, as idiotic as you are, we could make use of you there. Lucifer is riding your brother, is he not?”
They had finished breading the avocado and the fruit was gently frying in Castiel’s single pan when he asked, “Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you’d grown up differently?”
Her brows raised. “Can’t say that I have. That you boys then? Monster hunters?” She hummed. “Sounds awful handy, gotta say. I’ve seen some weird shit out there. Where’re you two from anyway?”
They begin to speak at the same time, Castiel to offer assurances that nothing needs to change between them. He’s here for the fight, and beyond. He’ll always be here.
, was painted butter-yellow and gold inside and out. It made the interior feel as warm as sunshine, even when the thick metal awning was still locked into the truck body, and all the doors and windows were closed to prying eyes.
Castiel started the car and peeled out of the driveway with a shriek of tires. His mouth still tasted apple-sweet as he drove away.
“That kind of cheese doesn’t go bad,” Dean argued and Castiel got the sudden sense that he had wandered into the middle of a very old argument. Dean paused in his casserole assembly to glare at his brother. “Anyway,” he continued in much milder tones. “Cas, no offense, but my mom’s pie will probably always be my favorite. Not great, not awful, but my favorite anyway. We always used to sit out on the porch in the summer and eat it and, you know, that cheese would be flaking off everywhere. It was awesome. The last time she’d made it was for a party she and dad were going to.” Dean began slicing mushrooms, methodically, and his voice dropped to encompass only Castiel. “I got scared. There’d been thunderstorms all afternoon, I think. She made this huge blanket fort out of sheets. We got every pillow from all over the house. Beds, couches, you name it. And then they canceled their plans and we all sat under there eating out of the pie plate with our forks, Sam passed out in dad’s arms.”
Castiel laughed. “Shootouts,” he said, too astonished to see levity in Dean to do much more than smile. “I should have gotten there sooner.”
Dean flushed red with anger and dismay, visible even in the dim room, and Castiel willed him to keep a cool head.
Castiel flexed his hips, pushing into his hand and imagined Dean in the vee of his legs. Imagined his tongue and his lips as Dean murmured low words and static mounted in the room.
“They don’t have termites here. Or,” Castiel squinted suspiciously at his smooth wooden floor and stomped on it a few times, pausing to listen for scuttling insect legs. “I hope not. No, there’s something…” He grimaced at the kitchen cabinets, all closed securely, thank god. “Don’t laugh.”
When he hung up the phone, Castiel stared at the porch door warily and steadied himself. “I just need some rest,” he told the house. He edged back inside. “We’re going to get along just fine, right?” he asked the
project?” Dean asked, face screwed up in confusion and looking so affably real for a moment that Castiel forgot he was talking to a ghost.
The page was old - internet old - with a cascading marbleized background layered over blinking gifs of six pointed stars.
The demon abruptly froze, spun, and dropped. Castiel ran to the demon, dropped to one knee, and pulled out his blade threateningly. “What are you protecting here?” he demanded.
“I mean, it’s either this or we try plan B.” At his squint she continued with a lilt, “True love’s kiss!”
It was rectangular and long, wrapped in plain brown paper crumpled to keep it from slipping around in the shipping box. Castiel unwrapped it and then immediately groaned as the item was revealed. He stomped into his bedroom to get his phone and made a call.
“Damn it,” Dean growled, and sprinted back towards the guards and their victim. The first one went down quickly, Dean’s blow to the back of his head delivered squarely. He fell into the dirt next to the beggar. Dean finished the job with a quick strike of his boot to the guard’s temple. The second guard swore at him before swinging into a defensive stance. This had the effect of freeing their victim from his blows. But the second guard was a burly man, well fed and well trained. His fists landed like thunder across Dean’s upraised arms, cutting into his ribs when he managed to slip a blow past Dean’s defenses. When the guard finally fell, blood anointed Dean’s forehead, and his knuckles ached.
And he would find his way back here, Castiel resolved as he bade farewell to Dean and started down the corridor. He’d done it. He had spoken out loud and kept the curse at bay with the help of Dean’s device. Maybe someday it wouldn’t even feel any different than a scar in terms of the effect it had on his daily life.
Castiel froze. He’d set up his tablet as a secondary phone for the convenience of texting; nobody ever called him. He took a breath. Except Charlie. She might call him if he didn’t check in. What had she said to Dean? “Was it Charlie?”
Dean’s eyes flew wide and he skimmed Castiel in a slow once over. “Oh!” he said, eyes fixed on Castiel’s tablet for a moment. He seemed to forget himself for a moment, mouth hanging open mid-sentence. Then he drew in a quick breath and made a terrible facsimile of a pout. “I had my nephew’s birthday party today! What kind of uncle do you take me for?”
Dean shook himself after a long moment of staring, and he slipped his hand from Castiel’s palms and picked up the pot tongs from the side of the fire. With a concentrated hiss, he pulled their meal from the flame and then tugged off the lid. The smell of fragrant beef and onion stew hit them, and Castiel leaned into it with a pleased groan. He dug his spoon from a pocket and joined Dean in scooping a mouthful from the pot nestled in the stones and fallen leaves at their feet. He raised his spoon between them and steam danced from it like grace.
“You should teach cooking classes, Cas,” Kevin said, peeling back the paper bowl to take a bite out of the side of the pie. “I’ll do the talking for you. You can pay me in pies.”
“Oh.” Castiel looked around the house warily. “And you died here.” He’d delivered the question as a sure statement, but the pointer swung immediately to NO. “Are you looking for him? I, uh, don’t really know how ghosts work. He’s not here.” The fact leaked out with an accusatory tone. “Your brother is in California as far as I know.”
Eileen nodded, and Castiel turned around without another word and ran for his car, heedless of Sam’s shouts behind him.
.” He waited until she’d begrudgingly brought one leg up and hugged it to her chest. “Things with Dean have been good.” Castiel made a face.
Dean shivered like a spirit passed through him. “Yeah, I’m not most people.” He applied a cocky grin to the situation and eased back, resting his elbow on his knee. “And you lucked out. I just so happen to be the person at the palace with the least to fear from those two leatherheads.”
and I had to come home to—“ Jenny’s voice quavered and she swallowed hard against the emotion trying to punch its way out of her throat. After steadying breaths, she continued. “I need to save her. I did all the spells. I talked to every fucking oracle. And if I can just travel back in time, I think I’ve got a chance.”
The man chained to the rusted soil stack at the far end of the room didn’t bother to look up at Castiel when he burst in, though he twitched at the sound of the door banging open.
The video was flashy and corporate, but there were two things that made Castiel sit forward and hover at the edge of the seat.
The mortal world was a gift, and Dean was trapped back in his house - in Dean’s old house - unable to touch or taste or breathe. It wasn’t fair.
Dean spat out rain water and glared at Castiel through the persistent drizzle that coated the pre-dawn sky in dim silver. “Like hell I will. We go together, Cas, or not at all.” He thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a plastic bag, fishing a hand inside to pull out the sheep heart. “Get ready to chant on my count.”
The planchette remained immobile under Castiel’s fingers. Gradually, the chill in the room decreased and his skin warmed. He shook with adrenaline. Pulling
They had a plan, Castiel kept assuring himself. They just needed more information before they could reliably act. He was so close to lifting the curse.
They had, to Castiel’s absolute delight, spent quite a lot of time off the main market row kissing and exploring each other, Dean murmuring sweetly in his ear. When they returned to the market, it was with a new ease. Dean had insisted they return to the ice cream stall, and picked up a paper cup himself before handing it to Castiel. Castiel had thought about preventing him. He didn’t require tests (only more kissing, please). But Dean seemed to need it, like he was finally climbing over a wall that he’d spent his entire life trying to scale. Castiel had eaten the ice cream feeling half guilty, like he’d forced Dean to venture into dangerous waters. Dean had noticeably watched him for any adverse effects, but he’d also resumed kissing Castiel. So all was apparently well enough.
Dean sat in a nest of blankets, Miracle curled up on Castiel’s pillow like a territorial cat. Dean blinked at him, then blearily rubbed his eyes with both palms. “Just want it to be perfect,” he muttered.
Castiel dissolved against the wall, heart thudding as he tried to understand what was happening in the room. All he could hear was medical jargon tossed between seasoned professionals, and Charlie asking repeatedly about her mother.
The day of the Night Market came up before Castiel felt quite ready for it. He lay in bed that morning staring at the ceiling and prodding delicately at the thudding fear that had taken the place of his heart overnight. He rubbed circles into his chest, trying to force relaxation back into his body with each breath. It would be easier to stay in bed. He’d return to his work and his quiet mornings alone in the kitchen or the solitude of his truck.
“Getting a weird feeling in there,” Dean muttered as they crossed the nearly empty main street, making straight for the gate at the far end of the town.
Castiel raised a querying brow. “Yes, Dean?” The converted voice sounded a bit more amused than he thought he felt, but Castiel couldn’t complain. Dean seemed to relax at the lighter tone and glanced up to meet Castiel’s gaze.
The dispassionate articles read more like traffic reports than odes to lost lives. The driver, John Winchester, had apparently died instantly. His son Dean was reported to have been extracted from the wreckage of the car in critical condition. “But you died,” Castiel squinted into the gloomy room. “And now you’re here. But for what? For last words for your brother?” He knocked his head against the wall. “That doesn’t help me at all. How do you get a ghost to move cross country?”
Castiel held the mangled pie in his hands and blinked at Dean in the dim glow cast by a small seashell night light plugged into the wall. Dean stared back at him, then leaned down to pick up his dropped phone. Slowly he raised it, the tiny flashlight beam illuminating the pie in Castiel’s hands. Castiel dropped it to the counter.
“Don’t let him hear you say that,” the guard advised as the door was rolled shut. “Or you’ll be fertilizer too.”
“Something like that,” Castiel typed. “I like the variety,” he said, which was something closer to the truth. “And seeing new places is a nice bonus.”
“What would my life be like if I’d had some kind of apple pie, picket fence?” Dean shrugged. “Sure, I mean, what kid hasn’t wondered who they’d be if they were richer or, or..?” He shook his head. “But I had Sam. And that was enough. It was always enough. I think I raised him right.”
Dean narrowed his eyes as Castiel froze. His contingency plan to flee town whirled through his mind even as the thought of leaving Dean and Charlie tore at him. “You wouldn’t.”
Trailing his fingers over the stash, he lingered for a moment on a small baggie of hexagonal pills. Now
Eileen smiled at them, and then yawned widely. “You’re staying the night, right?” Dean nodded against his shoulder, thumb flying upward, and Castiel belatedly echoed it. He hadn’t been planning on it, exactly, but weeks of occasional nights at Dean’s apartment had trained him to keep an overnight bag ready. “Need me to show you the guest room?”
Dean shook his head, frowning. The King had issued his challenge a full year before; of course these men and their princesses were well accustomed to each other by now. Quickly, Dean trailed the eldest to her boat. He stepped into the belly of the craft carefully. Taking up a long pole, the silent boatmen began to push the elegant skiffs across the lake to a castle that shone like a mist-shrouded moon on the distant shore.
Dean let himself be steered down and over onto his side. Castiel climbed on top of him and pressed a grinning kiss to Dean’s reddened lips. He fitted himself between Dean’s legs and settled his attention on Dean’s throat. His thumbs traced runelike curves along his hip bones before sliding closer to his cock. Dean let out a choked groan.
The demon spat out the details and watched the blade descend with something like relief. After the demon sparked out, Castiel cleaned his blade on the dead man’s jacket and re-sheathed it in his own coat. A prisoner Lucifer needed kept alive? It was hard to imagine anyone hitting that level of importance with the archangel. Unless something they knew, or had access to, scared Lucifer. A spark of hope kindled in Castiel’s chest. Before the assault he and Dean had agreed that there was no other way to defeat Lucifer except for all-out sacrifice. But what if there was another way, after all?
He breathed in the earthy smell of spring thaw and it steadied him. “And then the cabinets in the kitchen… Sometimes I come in and they’re open. All of them. And I said to myself, it’s an old house. This is normal, right? And then there was the day with the vegetables.”
Charlie took a deep breath like she was steeling herself for an epic jump, then launched into her story. “When I was little,” she said, “I got scared at a slumber party.” She stared out over the fallow field below them, now spotted with plump piles of snow gathering between the grasses. “I told the parents I was staying with to call my mom and dad, and they took off right away to pick me up. There was—” Her fingers tightened in Castiel’s grip and her tone flattened, like she was trying very hard not to cry. “There was an accident. My dad didn’t make it. My mom—” She turned to Castiel and he could see in her pooling eyes how much it cost her to tell him this. “The doctors say she’s brain dead. I’ve been hearing for years that I’ve gotta let her go. Unplug the machine. But I couldn’t.”
The new customer, Dean, bent to examine the display of pies behind Castiel’s display case with all the gravitas of a building inspector. Castiel considered him for a breathless moment before retreating into the truck to pull Kevin’s request from the refrigerator. He settled it into a disposable pie plate and slid the pie across the counter.
“I was wondering. Do you--” Dean cleared his throat and Castiel thought that a true mind-reading-to-speech device would be incredibly useful right at that moment. He could use it on Dean and get all the answers he needed without having to wait and hope to hear what he wanted.
Inside the conservatory the air felt immediately different - heavier and wet and warm. High in the structure of the greenhouse, birds chirruped like the apocalypse had never happened. Weak sun straggled through the glass, giving everything a soft glow. Long tables lined the sides of the greenhouse and center of the room. Much of it was filled with potted plants and the mundane trappings of gardening like trowels and sacks of soil. It certainly didn’t feel like a demon stronghold.
“Pretty empty,” Charlie murmured quietly. Castiel nodded. The sparsely populated bar didn’t make him feel any better. If anything, it felt more foreboding, like anything could happen to them now with few witnesses.
He opened his eyes to the dull dawn, then heaved himself up to sitting, swinging his legs to the side of the bed. There, he paused for a moment, collecting himself.
They drove through the meandering hills of New York’s coast with a wooden rowboat tied to the roll bars of the Jeep. The wood creaked and moaned with every turn and rattle of the road but the bleating of the sheep Dean had captured and hog-tied drowned it all out.
Charlie clutched the precious pie close to her and stumbled back as the first nurse rushed in. The three of them pressed back into the corner as a cadre of nurses flooded the room.
Down below them, just visible between the trees, the waterfront glinted with metal. Wood rose like teeth from barriers erected around the shore. Castiel whistled. “I didn’t realize this was so fortified now.” Makeshift barriers chopped the scenery into jagged strips of wood and water.
Her head tilted for a moment, like she was taking his measure. Then she nodded. “Okay, tell you what. You head outside and hang a left out of the doors. There’s a courtyard a little ways down. That ward’s sort of close to the right-hand corner of it.”
“The witch. The witch who cursed me.” The pie that emerged was red as blood, the crust a cookie crumble as dark as night.
His fingers wound tight on Castiel’s forearm, fingers digging in with unexpected force. “Dude, not those.”
The world swam in front of Castiel’s eyes. His chest burned. His body burned. The last thing he saw was Dean slumping to the ground, and the brilliant blue-white of Lucifer swirling over the mouth of the pit.
Castiel whirled on the couch. Dread struck his chest like a knife. “Who’s there?” he called, his voice unsteady.
Castiel rolled his lower lip in his teeth and nodded. “I’m okay,” he said with deliberately narrow focus. It was easier not to be overwhelmed if he only thought about the practical function of forming words. “It has been a very long time.” From the speakers, his voice emphasized the word
Castiel stood up with an audible moan as his back tried to stay in the crooked position he’d slept in during the night. Outside, the day looked bright and the sun high. He must have slept through much of the morning. Or possibly into the afternoon? He scrubbed at his jaw, then pulled open his curtain.
Except for the occasional car and stray animals wading down the shoulders like the asphalt was a stream cutting through the countryside, the roads were quiet. In five years or maybe a decade, they’d start to fall to ruin. Grass seeds would blow into cracked asphalt and take root, spreading green over and through. Given enough time, seeds were as effective as a sledgehammer. Already, green wrinkles streaked the concrete.
Castiel scrambled to his feet and took a tentative step towards Dean. His palms were wet with blood or sweat, or maybe both, but he tightened his grip on his blades nonetheless. So. Lucifer was letting him walk free.
“Leave me,” Castiel growled as they prepared their assault on the ship, the wind stealing the words from his lips and hurling them into the choppy lake. “Get a head start swimming. I’ll trigger the spell and then--”
Castiel blinked at him, then blinked again at the man’s perfectly raised brow. Dean seemed to know that he'd surprised Castiel and this apparently pleased him. That proud look of achievement was about to be dashed, however. Castiel knew very little ASL; what he did know was gleaned from the schools and hospitals his parents had sent him to after he had been cursed. But he had only learned enough to dangle on the edge of his classmates’ conversations.
They knelt on the hardwood floor for unmeasurable minutes before Castiel finally sucked in a breath and opened his eyes. He looked at Dean, taking in the bruised purple of his spirit. “Let’s do this right now,” he said in a rush. “Before I lose my nerve.”
The further they descended, the brighter the secret forest became. The grove of gold gave way to one of diamond, which cracked like frost across the vast cavern. Dean stole a branch of diamond, and placed it in his cloak.
“All magic comes at a price. I gave you the power to make pies with the power to heal your mother and as a price, it robbed you of pie-less speech.” Amara swept a curtain of hair back, revealing a disdainful expression. “I’d think saving your mother’s life would have been worth the inconvenience.”
Shaking his head emphatically, Castiel said, “You’re very much alive. Or you should be. We— We run a bar together. On Earth. Do you remember any of that?”
“You got this, Cas.” Dean whispered, pressed a quick kiss to his jaw, and stepped away. Charlie didn’t say a word, standing off to Castiel’s other side. He suspected she was incapable of speech right now. Like him, she was a knot of fear and expectation.
That thought ached, and only partially because of what he would be missing if Lyrebird never made it to market. Over the past few months, he’d witnessed how much of himself Dean poured into his work. He always spoke so lightly, so dismissively of his contributions, but everything he had seemed dedicated to making it work for larger-scale production. The headset had gone from something a little too Frankenstein’s Monster to ever pass for normal to something sleek and lightweight, designed in black and chrome silver. Now it might pass for an elaborate bluetooth headset more than anything.
“Nah. It’s a bonus for work but...” Dean’s ears definitely appeared a little rosy at the attention. Castiel felt the stone within him melt as the man jammed his hands back into his pockets like a bit of denim was the only force in the universe that might contain them properly. “My brother and his wife speak it so, you know.” His mouth slid into a lopsided smile. “Family dinners are a lot more fun when you know what everyone’s saying.” He elbowed Kevin in a conspiratorial manner. “Now Sam can’t talk about me in front of my face. Mostly. And I can talk to Eileen behind his back, like, literally. Which is pretty friggin’ handy.” He looked back at Castiel with a steadier gaze, apparently less rattled now. “Sorry, I hope this isn’t too personal but… You can hear?” Castiel nodded. “But don’t speak?”
Dean chewed on his lip. “My mom died when I was a kid. House fire. My dad got me and my brother out but before he could go back in for her, the house just…” The fingers of his other hand fluttered, like ashes spreading in the wind. “She died because of magic. My dad bought her this thing from a guy selling stuff out of his trunk at a gas station. A wishing candle?” He glanced sideways at Castiel, who shook his head at Dean’s prompt. He’d never heard of such a thing.
“Well, anyway. There’s some personal stuff that I’ve gotta--” She cleared her throat and looked away. “Gotta deal with.”
When she finally pulled away, she scrubbed her hand rapidly across her cheeks. “Uh. So. Change of subject, please?”
Castiel shifted in his chair, still sitting like he was lined up against a metal pole, and wished that for once in his life he could unravel and reciprocate.
Castiel swallowed and nodded. He led the way forward at first by halting steps, then in a full-tilt sprint.
“How’d it go?” Dean spoke this nearly into his ear and Castiel jumped, then scowled. Dean laughed and laid a steadying hand on his waist. “Somebody was absorbed in their work.” In response, Castiel mimed a yawn - which turned into a real one. Dean’s teasing grin softened. “You wanna sit down? I can finish packing up.”
The light traced their bodies with its slow touch and time passed without their interference, marching towards dawn and their assault on Lucifer’s throne room.
Castiel barely managed to contain a frustrated eye roll. He’d spent so long hiding his secret, the thought of exposure blocked his throat. He looked down at his tablet, then back up at Crowley. Crowley met his gaze then slowly, meaningfully, turned to look at Charlie.
Crowley sipped his drink. “Ah. Yes.” He looked between the two of them and then shifted to sit angled towards Castiel, his gaze piercing. “And what is the nature of the curse?” he purred. A slow smile lit his features.
“Save it,” Dean said shortly, but his voice held uncontained joy. Dean fumbled at his side and pulled up Castiel’s hand. “You can make it up to me, alright? World’s not dead yet.” He squeezed Castiel’s palm and pulled his hand up to lay a kiss along his palm. “There’s always hope. Now, c’mon.”
“Your mother was ailing. You were ferrying baked goods to the hospital. I told you to make her a pie that would make her feel better.”
By the end of the night, Castiel still had no idea exactly what FutureTech did, but he could say with certainty that their employees could party like they had dedicated their lives to the art of group fun. Honey Pies had been contracted until ten at night and Castiel had expected it to be bookended by dead lulls as guests filtered in or out. Instead, business was steady enough that Castiel considered pressing himself into a hidden corner of his truck to speak more pies into existence, rather than admit that he’d run out of too many varieties. The cold fear of discovery was enough to stop him; and the last time he’d tried to speak pies on the fly with a worried state of mind, the crusts had come out wobbly, the worst of them burnt.
She gripped his wrist. “No, I’m not moving. Not thinking seriously about it anyway. I...just…I used to move every year, you know? New place, new challenges. Sometimes I feel like I’ve overstayed my welcome here. Like I’ve gotta find something new. You know I used to mark time by where I lived? I’ve been here so long, I think I’m forgetting to pay attention. I didn’t even realize it’d been three years until…” Charlie sighed.
Castiel watched the main door, as well as the length of the workmans’ greenhouse while Dean climbed onto the center table. Reaching high and squinting against the drifting spray of the spray can, Dean painted a careful angel trap across the ceiling. He stepped back and forth between the tall workbenches to span the length of the path, until the white-painted trap was completed. In the mostly cloudy sky, it was largely invisible against the glass, blending into the window framing. It would hold Lucifer there for a short time, if he tried to leave through that doorway. There was just enough room for Castiel to squeeze past the trap, if he threw all dignity aside and crawled under the tables close to the wall.
Castiel turned back to the road, managing to glance at Dean between rearview mirror checks of the carnage Lucifer’s temper tantrum left behind. There was nothing in Jackson anymore. No intel, no resistance, and no Lucifer. The archangel would have dusted ash from his white jacket and flown away, a sneer drawn up on Sam Winchester’s face.
Dean caught the pie and tossed it to clatter on the bedside table. He raked fingers through his hair as a muscle in his jaw worked. He was clenching his teeth, and it was with a voice thick with strain that he finally said, “Fine. I’m coming, though.”
“Wait!” Mag’s voice raised high behind them. Castiel stopped, whirled, and lifted his weapon towards her out of instinct. She drew up her hands. “Wait,” she said again. “I’ll walk with you. Tell those boys up there to let you go.”
Learning to use Amara’s gift to create healing pies had taken a lot of practice. There was still so much to learn that Castiel sometimes thought it might take a lifetime to master it. Adding that extra element to his pies - to heal, not just comfort or entertain - took considerably more energy than normal baking ever could. Where magic used to be a shortcut to feed his friends and customers, creating more
For several years, he’d had a lurking worry that he’d forgotten too much about the witch. After all, they’d only met briefly and that had been a trying and traumatic day on the whole. But looking at the picture Charlie had sent, Castiel
Castiel stared between the board the the rest of the now-quiet room. “Well, that was easy?” he said finally. “I hope.”
The only correct response to this was an exasperated eye roll. Dean laughed at him and turned the music down a couple notches as Castiel rounded the car and slid into the passenger seat. His and Dean’s bags were packed and taking up space in the backseat. An unopened bag of beef jerky slouched on the seat between them.
Castiel rolled his eyes as Dean flickered back to the couch. “Can’t believe you’re making me watch these.”
“So perfect.” The sheets slithered down Castiel’s body, pulled by the forces Dean summoned. Fingers touched the hem of his shirt and Castiel stopped breathing for a moment. “I’d find out what you like,” Dean said, and Castiel exhaled. “Suck a mark into your throat. Push up your shirt.” The hem of Castiel’s shirt moved, sliding up his abdomen. Hair prickled along his trail and he raised both arms to the pillow like he was giving a lover space to work.
Dean shuddered and he dropped his head against Castiel’s palm, once more fading transparent. “Okay. Here goes nothing,” he said, and then disappeared.
sounded incredibly dramatic and in the rational light of day, perhaps incorrect. He shook his head. “I don’t think I’ll find any more leads at the Surly Cow. The regulars weren’t friendly.”
The man looked down at his tattered clothing. At the blood staining his tunic crimson. “Surely not as low as me.”
“What are you doing here?” Castiel pleaded with his heart in his throat. “You’re waking up! You’re alive!”
“Wait, no.” Dean looked back at him, eyes alight with mischief. “Let me try something.” He snapped his fingers. There was an electrical pop from something in Castiel’s house, but the television flicked on instantly. Dean crowed in triumph.
“I’d complain that you’re trying to show me up,” Dean said as he helped unbox the next pie - a more traditional pumpkin with cleanly constructed pastry oak leaves. “But I knew what I was getting into.”
Together, they confronted Lucifer, who awaited them like an ancient marbled statue against the dreary backdrop of the sanitarium. He was the only pristine thing in a hundred miles, Castiel thought inanely as they entered the garden. Even as fallen as he was, Castiel could feel the hum of his archangel grace, primordial and strong. He hated it. He yearned for it.
“We got the time. Ain’t seen anyone else since we left that seaport. You’ll need a good meal in you before we head on to Lake Ontario. Who knows what we’ll find.”
Castiel dropped the cue list to his lap and stared at Dean. He took a deep, shuddering breath, held it, then let it out again. He licked his lips, sucking the flavor from them. “This is incredible,” he finally said, struggling to find the right words, or any words. “And you did this.”
Pulling back from the kiss, Castiel saw that they were now in the park ringed by trees, rolling hills, and nothing else. Dean’s lips were kiss swollen, red from friction. He smiled and the light turned autumnal so that Dean’s hair was gilded with gold. Castiel moved his hand from Dean’s disappointingly jeans-clad ass back to his face, tracing the sharp lines of his jaw up to his ear and then curving around to the delicate hair that grew at his temple.
Unseen breezes shifted the hair along Castiel’s brow. “If I could hold a spatula without, you know, exploding the food…” He blinked out of view for the space of a few breaths, but the cold remained. When Dean flashed back, one leg was drawn up, his chin balanced on the knee. “I can make an amazing burger,” he said wistfully.
If Dean had looked defiant, if he’d tried to spend one more minute convincing Castiel of his imminent danger, or foolishness in consuming something magical, then Castiel would have walked away without looking back.
Gold and diamond foliage, it turned out, went a long way towards buying a secure academic career and every comfort Dean could wish for Sam. With nothing left for himself, Dean left his brother again and set out with Castiel’s cloak embracing him. Its magic as solid as ever, Dean faded into the misty morning like a spirit walking the earth.
He dug into his jacket pocket and pulled out a sheet of paper, edges worn from repeated folding. Castiel smoothed the paper open and handed her the poem. She read the first stanza aloud.
Castiel’s scrambled awareness registered guns pointed at his and Dean’s head. And a knife held solidly in Dean’s hand. “Dean,” he gasped. “What are you doing?” A pie thunked to the floor and in the short silence that followed, the two guards recovered themselves. The guard Castiel had been trying to choke stepped back again, her gun steady on Castiel again.
Castiel eased himself to the floor and extended his aching leg in front of him, propping the tablet next to his knee so he could write easily. “Just a lot on my mind.”
“Sounds like a bad joke,” Dean continued as though he hadn’t heard him. “It’s killing me,” he parroted himself. “Fucking useless in life, in death, just like my dad and now he’ll never— And I’ll never—“
Eventually, only Castiel remained standing in a wide circle of fallen demons. He panted where he stood, adrenaline ripping through him as he sucked in air. Dimly, he was aware that he was injured. His side burned and his left arm felt weak, like something vital may have been severed. A spider-trickle of blood crept down his temple. But all he could think about, past the fog of the fight, was Dean.
“Change of plan,” Castiel whispered, laying a hand on Dean’s arm to stay him from rushing forward to confront Lucifer, as he’d been about to do.
Dean flinched at the touch, so small that it would have gone unnoticed had Castiel not been cradling the back of his hand with his palm, trying to will him to relax his grip on the wall.
“Least I can do.” Dean moved to lean on the counter next to Castiel. His hands traced the words quickly. “One of these days we’ll teach Sammy to cook.”
“Castiel.” Dean’s lips twitched in a smile. “Can’t say it’s entirely been a pleasure but that’s no fault of your own.”
Lucifer had taunted them, which Castiel had expected, and showered them with condescending praise, which Castiel hadn’t. Dean had listened to him, listened to every golden dagger that fell from the Great Deceiver’s lips. Until Lucifer made the mistake of bringing up Mary Winchester.
Dean’s eyes widened and he stared at the pie lying on the floor for a moment, then looked back up to meet Castiel’s eyes. There was fear there but, Castiel started to realize, it seemed to be fear for him. For the gun still trained lovingly on his scalp from inches away.
If a stomach could drop entirely out of a body, Castiel’s did that now. Charlie had told Dean about the Throne Room deal? Why? “The Throne Room,” he repeated and his voice shook. “Are you sure?” The resultant pie was a blackened thing and suddenly not caring, Castiel let it drop to the front step.
Castiel took a long moment to gather his thoughts. Before them, the fire crackled and steam escaped from the edges of the lid of the pot, setting it to a low, intermittent clatter. He’d been lost in dark tunnels of despair for so many months now that the rest of the world felt as blinding as the flames cooking their dinner. He hadn’t wanted to accept the fall of the world and had given up so much only to join the losing side. He had lost himself. But now...
“Yeah. It was.” Dean set the spoon on the log beside him and gestured around. “ You know, out here, it doesn’t feel like the end.”
Castiel couldn’t stop himself from laughing in disbelief and ginger flooded his tongue. He focused on the facsimile speech then, carefully enunciating through the device, “I think it’s incredible. Perfect,” he said, because it was. “Sorry. I’m ready now. I’m okay.”
Two demons entered as Dean was finishing his paint job along the back curve of the path. They wore dirt-streaked smocks and carried trowels, but their eyes flashed black when they noticed Castiel. For his part, Castiel moved on them like a whirlwind. He sprang out from the greenery before they could shout, staying low and twisting high with his blade to catch one of them right in the gut. As the first demon sparked out, the second whirled to attack. Castiel blocked one blow and absorbed another sharp cut to his jaw before twisting around and jamming his blade behind him. His sword hit their flesh hard and the demon let out one small gasp - a gust of wind against the nape of his neck. Then there was nothing but the sound of a spray can hissing, and the soft
“Sometimes I wonder…” Dean stopped and hung his head, examining his hands in the light of the fire, turning them in its warmth. “Is there any chance of us winning? Any hope? Even if I kill...Lucifer. How do we come back from this, Cas?”
Castiel nodded solemnly. “A bakery isn’t very mobile. I wanted to move.” Sometimes typing was a boon to him, a way to cut the words from his body and leave his behind. His restaurant had barely lasted two years, back when he’d been foolish enough to try to settle down and live his life. Back when he’d been foolish enough to try to love and be loved openly.
As they prowl down the cheerfully lit stair to the basement, Castiel’s chest warms. He breathes out slowly, no outward hesitation in this vital mission. But the warm weight remains and it spurs Castiel forward, recklessly fast. Gamrit, he can tell, is taken by surprise at his speed but follows gamely as Castiel charges ahead.
Dean stopped bobbing his head and opened his eyes, pinning Castiel with his gaze for one long moment. Slowly, he smiled with a look both taunting and a little shy. “You’re just trying to get in my pants,” he rejoined, a little breathlessly. A spark kindled in his eye.
She poked him in the side, playfully. It seemed to signal a shift in subject and Castiel went along with it willingly. “You know,” Charlie said. “I’ve been thinking a lot about what we talked about last week. You giving up on finding the witch. And I think it’s a good idea. In fact, I think it’s the best idea. It’ll be so good for you to move on with your life and just...start living it.” Charlie sounded wistful, and Castiel was hit with the sudden realization that she was wishing the same thing for herself. He ached, knowing that she wasn’t ready to confide in him, and he resolved to be there for her in whatever way he could.
Dean returned to Earth with a jolt, knees buckling under the weight of his suddenly corporeal body. He looked up to find himself kneeling in front of a garish motel, painted bright orange and teal with bright blue fish sketched along the wall channels. Inside the motel, a lamp shattered with a. bright pop, followed by the much louder sound of a body hitting wood.
Sitting very still, he bowed his head to wait for Dean to start attaching the headset. He dropped his hands to his lap, keeping them intentionally wide and relaxed-looking. In reality, the old terror tried to grip him as memories of past pain returned. He didn’t realize he was holding his breath until Dean tapped his forearm with a fingertip. Castiel looked up.
She drove them to the bar and parked on the curbside. The road hosting the Throne Room felt ominously empty to Castiel, like a cleared street in a western just before a shootout.
“You can watch from here. Me and Benny got a good view.” Benny grunts an affirmative. “Cas, c’mon.” There’s the sound of boots shifting against root and soil.
“Now,” Castiel agreed in a sharp exhale. They pried their way out from behind their wall of boxes as soon as the truck slowed. When the rear door was reopened, they were waiting at its mouth.
There was a light swat on his hip. When he turned back towards Dean, his boyfriend winked. “Crush ‘em, babe.”
Castiel pressed his palms into his knees to stand and followed Dean towards the room beyond. The motion of Dean’s body as he led the way into the room carried with it a gentle scent of cologne, like a breeze pulling the aroma of summer from an equatorial island. Castiel drank it in, felt like a foolish idiot, and inhaled it some more. Now this just wasn’t fair at all.
Dean flicked his gaze upwards at that and met Castiel’s eye, intent yet unreadable. “They all look good,” he said at last. He shoved his hands in his pockets again, now clearly with discomfort. “Listen. I’m, uh, sorry about earlier. I realized I was grilling you about talking. That was crappy.”
“As if I’d allow anything else,” Dean said with a laugh. He hauled himself up, then extended a hand for Castiel. Together, they made their way to the guest room.
When Mag finally arrived, she was revealed to be a short, compact woman with steely thick forearms and a cool expression. “So you’re the new boys in town,” she said, expertly scanning them. Her gaze lit on their weaponry and seemed to linger on the hidden pockets that held blades and bullets. “Justice said you’re looking for a strange ship? Explain.”
“Winchester?” Bevell looked both delighted and horrified at the news. “Dean Winchester, as in one half of the two American boys who destroyed the world?”
The following week, Castiel and Charlie walked into the Throne Room for the first time. It reminded Castiel of the bar he’d been kicked out of; there were sigils painted on the wall and the room had an iron smell to it that reminded him uncomfortably of blood.
“Shh,” Castiel admonished, though he had half a mind to spring out from behind the crate immediately. The HPG egg bit into his side like an unrelenting fist. He’d have a bruise there, later. Surely they could take over the truck and pilot it towards the Conservatory themselves. But then there would be gate checks or arrival protocols...and their faces were among the most notorious “most wanted” of Lucifer’s new rule. No, arriving as part of a shipment was singularly inglorious, but strategically sound.
It was risky showing their hand like that. But without getting a boat themselves and trying their luck on the open lakes, shore intel was their best bet.
It had been a good day. The transition of seasons was hard on people and several late spring viruses passed around the city’s residents like overzealous do-si-do partners. He’d had steady business with his robust cold-remedy pies, savory things that stayed blessedly warm for hours. With a few warm almost-summer days under their belts, there were also early sunburns to deal with. Castiel thought he would never stop being amused watching someone consume a bright red berry-burn pie, and see the scarlet flush ease away like it was being sucked into a black hole of jam.
Dean laughed warmly and suddenly he was standing beside the counter instead of sliding into Castiel’s space. “Yeah, well, a dresser-top’s as good a counter as any. And my dad didn’t care. You can just pick avocados off the sidewalk there and flour’s cheap. Get a little day old bread, a little dumpster dive, and you’re practically good to go.”
Bevell’s eyes widened and a mirthless smile quirked her lips upward. “Really? Do they even know what it’s for?” Her eyes traveled the length of Castiel and her nose wrinkled delicately. “They look as though they’ve been swamping. Tell me,” she directed this to Dean and Castiel. “What would you do if you had such an item?”
Dean’s childhood hadn’t been happy, full of too much uncertainty - even once his father had managed to anchor their family in a house. From the sound of it, neither of Castiel nor Dean had managed to escape without lonely scars etched into them. That Castiel found someone now for whom connection seemed easy seemed like a miracle. And a curse, of course, given that one of them was dead.
Castiel ran careful fingers around the edges of the crusts. His pies were earning a reputation. People bought them to seal wounds, cure colds, or lift depression for a while. None of the pies were basic, though many seemed deceptively streamlined. A simple pumpkin spice helped eczema. A sprightly lemon meringue tackled anxiety. They were small pies, with modest miracles contained within. And they were still so much more than Castiel had ever dreamed they might be to anyone.
Dean frowned at Castiel, drinking in the sharp planes of his cheekbones, his wide eyes dark under the cavernous stars. “She is not half so beautiful as you,” he said softly, and was gratified to see Castiel smile grow into a slow and private thing between them. “You know, I’m no fool. There’s no love at first sight. You’ve got to work for it.”
When he reached the Jeep, he spared a quick glance at the distant brick building. The gunfire had ceased. The last of the hunters likely dead or wishing they were. They’d lost everyone, but then that had been the plan all along. Castiel tamped down his instinct to grieve and tumbled Dean into the passenger’s seat of the Jeep, where he slumped, fully unconscious. He was alive, and so was Dean. That was a start. Castiel ran to the driver’s seat and jumped inside. The Jeep coughed to life, absurdly loud in the dead city. Castiel glanced around them surveying for threats before driving away. Behind them, the sanitarium stood ringed by empty woods. Before them was nothing but the burned out city, and the road.
Dean struggled to remember why he was here, if not to touch and be touched. His next question came out embarrassingly like a gasp. “Those princesses. Those girls - because two of them are younger than Sammy - are they going to be drawn back here forever?”
The sigh of wind rustled the room. “Good. That’s good. Don’t get yourself off yet. Close your eyes.” Castiel closed them. “I want you to picture me. I— I’m between your legs. Pushing them open.” Pressure at his knees made Castiel moan and he let his legs fall open, the sheet billowing down between them.
