Bucky nods and sniffs. He almost considers backing out and they do something else, but then he remembers his nephew and how much Peter had been looking forward to the party.
Tony never did come by again. And Steve never called. They weren’t meant to be and there was no point in holding onto something Steve was never going to have. Peter didn’t need Tony in his life. He had Steve and the Avengers. And that was enough.
“Uh what do you want to know? You guys knew each other first, right?”
“Is it the kids?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, one hand coming up to cup Steve’s cheek. His thumb gently swipes along the smooth skin. “I don’t want to rush you. I don’t...I don’t want to...hurt you.”
Steve scoffs again and her smile instantly vanishes.
Tony eyes him closely while he sips from his wine glass. Peter catches his gaze and then quickly glances back down at his plate.
A team of superheroes. The Avengers.
“We just name him Benjamin Ben. There. Can we stop now?”
Steve nods, his face heating up. “I think it’s hormones but I need you right now.”
“Good. Now let’s take a break and have a snack.”
Tony is lounging on the sofa, skimming through the designs he had for their son’s room. He had shown Steve a few of his ideas but they had yet to meet in the middle.
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe both.
“I don’t know. You are eating more, but your metabolism isn’t normal. You’re always needing the calories,” Tony argues.
“I know, but it’s almost over. You can do this,” Happy encourages.
“Tonight?”
“I don’t go around scaring you from the ceiling.”
“It’s all your fault. You ruined everything!” Peter screams and he fires strings of web at the shield, not caring if he’s ruining the memorial. He yanks on the strands and pulls as hard as he can; the stone shield begins to crack. “I don’t want this stupid shield! I don’t want it!”
“I know,” Pepper rubs a hand along his back, “I know it hurts. But it’ll get better. You can’t go back but you can go forward. You can be better for yourself and your son.”
“Honey?” Steve’s eyes shoot open at the concerned tone of his husband’s voice. Tony is frowning at him. “It doesn’t really hurt.”
Bucky rushes to his side when he picks up on the painful sound, offering Steve a cup of ice chips the nurse had brought in a few minutes prior. Steve shakes his head and Bucky frowns.
Flash’s eyes grow dark with anger and Peter half expects him to issue the first punch.
“What are you-forget it.”
“Is it a raise?” Pepper smirks. “I’m not against the idea.”
He didn’t care if his son was an alpha. Any prejudice and fear Steve had for them didn’t exist with his son. Peter would grow up to be like his father. Tony was strong, smart, selfless; Peter would possess those same qualities. At just a few weeks old, Peter was already proving that he was one of the good ones.
And now with the approaching holiday, Steve was looking forward to it. Their first year together, Tony had gone overboard with gifts, showering Steve with large bouquets of flowers, boxes of chocolates, and stuffed animals too big to fit into the apartment. The gesture was sweet but too much. Tony made sure to tone it down, albeit the best he could. It was still Tony, which meant that though a large stuffed animal didn’t happen, he made up for it with another extravagant gift. At least a wristwatch could fit into their home...until Steve learned it cost a few million dollars.
Peter whimpers and Steve’s eyes land on him, whining softly for his pup. Pierce points the gun at Steve, pressing the cold metal into his forehead.
Steve doesn’t even flinch when Tony’s hands are on him again. He can feel when he’s close by, and can even smell him. Tony’s hands roam over his legs and spreads them open, then he’s positioning himself between them.
Natasha lets out a heavy sigh and sets her glass down on the coffee table. Tony waits for her to yell at him or maybe even through the glass at his face. He deserved whatever she had planned for him. He hurt her and the rest of his friends. He hurt his son. He hurt Steve.
“It won’t be the same without you, Cap. No one can lead the team better than you.”
“I figured. You don’t have to worry about taking me to school or anything.”
“I know.” Steve cranes his neck to make sure his son was where he was supposed to be, then he directs his attention back on his husband. “I don’t know how. This isn’t fair, Tony. This isn’t fair.”
“Whatever you like, sweetheart. So the right partner, huh? You sure that’s me?”
“Fuck,” Steve pants and he glances down to watch Tony’s fingers stretch him open.
Steve casts his gaze down toward his lap. Of course Bucky would be the one to figure it out.
“Blue. Yours?”
And Tony had to live with that guilt for the rest of his life.
The man turns away for a moment and presses his finger against his right ear, speaking to someone Steve can’t see. Steve eyes him closely, straining his ears to pick up any information that could be useful.
“Sorry,” Peter apologizes and rushes into the building. He glances around the large lobby, taking in its professional and lavish style.
Tony gets the call the next day. He’s sitting in a boring meeting when Natasha calls him. Pepper isn’t even angry when he tells her he needs to leave.
Steve peers up at him. “At what?”
Bucky frowns and turns to Sam. “He’s hiding something from us.”
“What?” Tony is taken aback from the question. He thought he had already made it clear to his son that he loved Steve. That he still loves him.
“Don’t make me start,” Natasha threatens. Then she turns and leaves the room. “I love you!” She calls out.
“Ever hear of a PB&J?”
“I just mean from you. What did you think about him?”
Doctor Banner smiles warmly, but that’s not enough to calm Peter’s nerves. Peter eyes him closely, taking in as much of him as he could. Bruce seemed nice, his parents knew him from back in the day, but Peter was still hesitant.
“I’m sorry,” Natasha says, her voice low. Tony still catches the apology and he pulls her into a hug. It’s more for herself than him.
Peter nods and his eyes drift toward the doorway, finding his uncle leaning against the frame with his arms crossed and lips pursed in a tight line. He didn’t seem too happy, but Peter didn’t understand or care why. All that mattered was that his papa was home early.
“I don’t care.” Steve smiles and pecks a quick kiss to Tony’s lips. “But maybe brush your teeth before we go.”
“Yep.” Bucky shuts the tv off and makes his way to the kitchen. Peter makes sure to remind his uncle to add extra jelly, and Bucky gives him a thumbs up in response.
“Damn you, Steve,” Tony angrily speaks to the image as if Steve was really standing in front of him. “I’m not taking all the blame for this. You could’ve done more. It wasn’t just me.”
Steve keeps his teeth bare, not caring that he’ll get reprimanded for it later. He needs to protect his daughter.
It’s difficult to ignore him, but Tony forces himself to do it, instead focusing on getting his daughter’s bag and carseat. He straps her in and places a blanket over her to keep her warm. Steve comes closer, trying to get to his baby.
“Make yourself comfy,” Tony gestures toward the sofa, then he heads toward the kitchen.
Soooo....this one has some more drama between these two. I swear I’ll leave them alone and let them be happy!
“Don’t worry about it.” Tony waves a dismissive hand and steps into the bathroom. He makes himself comfortable on the closed lid of the toilet. “How is he?”
Peter glances down at himself and huffs out a small laugh. “It is a little uncomfortable.”
“Hey, it’s...I guess I can’t say okay because honestly I don’t know. But I can assure you this one is in good hands. You’ll get a chance to raise this one, be a mother. I won’t let anyone hurt you or this baby.”
Steve frowns. “That’s not very reassuring.”
“We have
“Is it the right time?” Peter asks, hopeful.
Pretty soon, she’d have them both back.
The baby kicks again.
“Are you?” Sam’s tone is serious this time.
Anyway! Thank you so so much for the wonderful support you have given me and this story. It was a lot of fun! I love you all so much! ❤️
Peter’s face pales. “Wait, I can’t do that! He’ll kill me!”
“Relax,” Tony says, snapping Steve from his thoughts. “Don’t worry about what people think.”
“You okay?” Tony is quick to sense Steve’s uneasiness. “If you want we can just do the small stuff,” Tony suggests, taking a couple of small boxes into his arms. He gives one a little shake and smiles when something slides around. “This one might just be clothes.”
Steve jumps slightly and turns his head over his shoulder. “I didn’t hear you come in. Sorry. I’m going to clean-”
Tony chuckles. “I think someone needs a nap, and it’s not this little guy.”
Steve knew when something was wrong with his son. Peter was a quiet kid, but when he was sick or dealing with something, he shut down. He was doing that now and Steve just knew Peter was being secretive. The issue was Steve didn’t understand why. They had an open door policy and Peter usually came to him or Tony when he needed advice or was sick.
Steve nods his head. “Yes. And Happy?”
“Pete,” Steve sighs and rubs a hand over his face. Despite having a serum that granted him superhuman abilities, the fatigue still managed to kick his ass. Perhaps he was over exerting himself. If he wasn’t counseling healing omegas then he was caring for his pups. Life was hectic, but it was good and he wouldn’t trade this life for anything.
“I’m gonna get Pep and Happy to take the kiddos and we’ll stick around here.”
Tony smiles. “Only for you.”
“Pretty boring,” Peter starts to say while he stabs his fork into the chicken. “But Ned did tell me about his new Star Wars Lego set. Oh and I talked to MJ-uh I mean...that’s not important.”
“Sorry!” Peter quickly apologizes. “I didn’t mean...I was just looking for you and...are you okay?”
“Kid, I don’t think anyone can. But doesn’t the world still need Cap?”
Peter nods and his uncle leaves the room. With a huff Peter collapses on the bed. Sleep beckons him, but just like previous nights, he knows he won’t be getting any. The nightmares never leave him alone.
Steve takes a deep breath and blows it out, then he bears down again. His back arches and his body lifts off the seat. He groans, voicing the start of another contraction, and he pushes hard, screaming when he stretches wider. Then finally, the head slides out completely.
Putting distance between himself and the dog proves to be a challenge. There are only so many times Tony can use his lab to avoid crossing paths with the furry mutt. The dog is always there, lingering around Tony’s space. Though that could be ignored, sharing his bed was a whole other story.
“Sorry. We can talk about the good stuff. Did he still draw?”
Steve shoots his son a reassuring smile. “It’s fine, Pete. You come first.”
He pushed everyone he ever cared about out of his life because he was afraid of hurting them. But he realized the pushing ended relationships. Relationship requires effort and he was trying his best to put forth as much effort as he could. He wishes he had put more with Steve, but that was the past and the person standing in front of him was his present and future. He couldn’t let another one go.
“Hi.” Steve smiles down at his son, his heart bursting with joy. His son was absolutely perfect. He meant everything to him. “Daddy will be home tomorrow okay? It’s just you and me tonight. We’ll be okay, right?”
It should be obvious that the next person to wield the famous shield should be Sam, but judging by his face, he’s ready to pass on it. He thinks back to that last real conversation he had with his friend. Steve was going to retire and pass the shield to him. Maybe then, at that moment, Sam would’ve accepted his new role. But he can’t do that now. It doesn’t feel right.
“I know.” Tony glances down to watch Steve rub circles over his belly. “And I’m going to get bigger. Joy.”
“Steve, what’s wrong?” Tony asks, immediately regretting asking the question when Steve’s expression hardens. The way his jaw clenches is just one of the signs indicating that he was getting agitated.
“Not always. It’s okay, Steve. It still felt good for me. Watching you enjoy youself...it was so good. How did it feel?”
“What happened?” Natasha asks. She glances down at Morgan then back up at Tony. “Where’s Steve?”
Tony steps away from the conversation to find a snack for them both. He frowns when he opens his fridge and finds it low on supplies. He didn’t consider himself much of a chef and didn’t bother preparing meals unless he wanted to burn the tower to the ground, but now that he had a kid to look after, he might as well start making a grocery list.
Tony turns to Natasha, mouthing ‘see’
He’s fine with the coffee; Steve makes it specially for him. He’s more than fine with the morning run Steve likes to take; that’s Steve’s time to unwind and clear his head. Tony would honestly prefer if he skipped the pills instead of the run.
Tony kisses back, enjoying the feel of Steve’s soft lips upon his own. A few more gentle kisses like that are shared before Tony is breaking the kiss and resting his forehead on Steve’s again.
“Do you? Your son was in tears, Tony! What the hell did you do!”
Tony frowns. He’s starting to second guess himself. Was it really an excellent idea? Pepper knew about Peter, but introducing her to him would be...interesting. Pepper would probably love him instantly. Happy would be confused and probably ask a million questions. Then there was Rhodey…
“But-”
“Me, too.” Steve nods in agreement.
He wishes he had retired for good. His hiatus was good for him but not for anyone else. Pepper had to take up extra work and he figures her phone calls was her telling him she was burnt out and ready to quit. He couldn’t lose her. He’s lost enough already.
Peter keeps the picture secretly tucked away in the pocket of his hoodie. There would only be one reason for him to bring it to school. Ned still needed to know.
“I wasn’t going to-”
“I don’t know, but we will.”
Steve does his best to ignore the puzzled looks being sent his way. His teammates knew that wherever he went Tony was sure to follow. Steve glances at the door, waiting for it to open and for his husband to walk through it. They were supposed to be going together, but Tony insisted Steve go without him and he’d catch up.
It’s not until his last day with Peter does Tony decide to be the bigger person and fix the issue. Steve is cold when he answers the door, but he surprises Tony by allowing him in. Tony was sure Steve would’ve taken their son and slammed the door in his face.
“Guess those hormones aren’t going away anytime soon,” Clint teases.
“Yeah. I can find them a therapist if that helps. I know I’m gonna need to talk to someone and if you need that too then we can set that up. I want you to heal and get back to how you used to be. And I don’t mean the kid from Brooklyn.”
Happy still doesn’t appear convinced, but he drops it. “Okay. Let me know if it gets worse. I said I’d protect Tony, but that includes you and your son too.”
Giving up was something Steve never did. It wasn’t who he was. He was willing to stand up and fight until he couldn’t. Giving up wasn’t in his blood.
“She’s asleep,” Steve informs when he enters the room. “I think I wore her out.”
“He usually sets the table,” Bucky says as he does Peter’s usual job. Sam nods in response. “Where is he? He’s okay, right? Should I call him again?”
Sam is the best! I love their friendship.
Tony smiles. “Of course. Anything for you, honey.”
“You’re okay. You can do this,” Tony assures.
“Not everyone,” Bucky says, still frowning.
“You just had a baby. He can’t send you out-”
“You did good, Omega. Hydra thanks you.”
Bruce shakes his head disapprovingly, and Tony waits for another lecture to come. But it never does.
“That's okay. Today we’ll determine that. When were you last sexually active?”
“Shut up and help me.”
“Thank you. And tell Captain Rogers that I hope he feels better.”
Tony lays a fresh pair of clothes on the bed, then he leaves the room and shuts the door behind him. Steve throws the blankets off with a huff and climbs out of bed. The new clothes waiting for him appear bigger in size, but not by much and they’re still a little tight when he slips into them. He’d rather wear the sweatshirt he’s stolen. Maybe this was Tony’s way of asking for it back.
Tony thinks it’s a waste of time to paint the spare bedroom, but Steve insists that they do. In just a few months they’d be welcoming their first child. At just twenty weeks pregnant, Steve is already glowing and bursting with happiness. Tony’s never seen him this happy.
“Sorry,” Peter quickly apologizes when he catches the way Tony’s eyes drift in the direction of his sleeping daughter. “I felt bad about letting her sleep alone and then she started crying and-”
“I don’t know. I've heard of it but this sounds different. You’re not the only one who’s noticed how you’ve changed. Are you sure you’re not-”
“Yeah. I didn’t tell them anything else. They would’ve killed me.”
Peter was only a couple of weeks old and still had a ways to go before he did anything other than sleep and poop, but Tony still managed to get excited over every little thing his son did.
“I don’t know.”
Steve eyes him closely until Tony has no choice but to give in. With a sigh he says, “Okay. You got me. I need a break. But they were asking for you.”
“Peter, please.”
“So what do we do? I don’t want to lose you again.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.
Tony smiles.
“Always,” Steve promises.
“The best. He did everything he could to give me a good life. Sometimes I wish he would’ve done more,” Peter sighs sadly.
“This. I wondered if I’d ever get a chance to do this again, and now I have him. And this time I promise to never let him go. I’d do anything to protect him.”
Steve winces. It was his fault that Tony was away from his job and friends. He was the reason why Tony was robbed from his old life. A horrible thought enters his mind, and he wonders if Tony would be better off without him.
“Is it?”
Hello! This is it, guys! Baby Peter is coming! I can't wait to introduce him and for Steve to meet his baby. Hope you all are doing well!
I’m not saying anything...🤐
Tony frowns. The event was still fuzzy in his mind. He remembered bits and pieces, but for the life of him he couldn’t remember how he had gotten home. It hadn’t been the first time, but there was something off about this time.
“You won’t. Steve-”
Tony takes the lead, gently pushing Steve down onto the bed and hovering over him. He connects their lips again, slipping his tongue inside Steve’s mouth when Steve moans softly. Steve’s hands find their way into Tony’s hair, running his fingers through the locks and tugging softy.
With a shaky breath Steve looks away. He doesn’t recognize the person in the mirror anymore. Maybe at one point in time he had, but that seemed like such a long time ago now. He wanted nothing more than to look in the mirror and like what he saw. But the image never changed. He was still a damaged omega.
When Steve enters the room, he finds Tony lying in the bed, hooked up to a machine, and upon closer inspection, his face is decorated in black and blue bruises.
That same voice is back, screaming at Tony to come clean.
“I can’t do that.”
“I'm missing a lot, aren’t I?”
“He should come back,” Thor decides to speak. “His son needs him.”
“I’m sorry. I was blind. I should’ve been more considerate of your feelings. I guess I was so caught up in finally having a baby that I didn’t pay attention to how it was affecting you.”
“At least try.”
This time Pierce had been in the dream. He wasn’t hurting Steve the way he used to do, but instead threatening him of worse to come, laughing at him for believing that everything was okay now. It was just Steve’s fears playing with him and conjuring the nightmares, but they still left him waking unnerved.
Tony sighs and turns back around to focus on his work. He jumps when arms wrap around his neck and soft lips are kissing his cheek.
Steve takes a moment to compose himself and he runs a hand through his hair. The shaky intake of air he takes and the tears that roll down his face only urges Tony to comfort him even more.
“Hi, Sarah.” He tries out the name. It fits her. It’s perfect. “You’re so beautiful,” he says, stroking her face lovingly.
“It’s okay,” the omega says. He thrusts his hips up, urging Tony to touch him again. Tony groans and both hands grip the omega’s hips. “Do it. You have to.”
“Don’t forget Happy.”
He was back in hiding now, shielding himself behind the comfort of the walls his lake house provided. He was probably better off staying in the city, but he needed to give Peter space. This was the only way he knew how.
Peter knew sneaking onto the Quinjet was a very bad idea. He had done a lot of stupid things during his short life, but nothing as stupid and dangerous as hijacking a mission. A mission he was not supposed to be allowed on.
“I’ll talk to him. Maybe sit this one out.”
“I don’t know. I’m hungry.” Tony opens the bag and pops a few blueberries into his mouth, chewing the fruit happily. He lets out a content sigh and leans back against the pillows he brought from home. “So far this is nice. I get to lie in bed and eat snacks, finally get around to that upgrade for your suit, and let you pamper me. This is great!”
“Not really. Or we switch them and-”
The hand over his mouth is removed, only to be replaced with the alpha’s lips. Those lips trail lower until they’re hovering over the spot no other alpha was allowed to touch. Steve’s body reacts when a kiss is placed there.
“Sir…” Jarvis sounds unsure, almost timid to say anything else. Then he finally finds the courage to say, “I’m sorry.”
Peter opens the book and skims through the first few pages. “Thanks. I’ll read it.”
“A surprise!” Sarah says enthusiastically.
“Is this your first pregnancy, Peter?” Bruce asks, turning away from the computer to face the teenager.
Steve takes the gift, brows furrowing in confusion. He can’t imagine what could be this small. His question is still unanswered when he pulls out a small crystal vial filled with a strange, purple liquid. He stares up at the god quizzically.
“Hey, it’s okay. It’s just a movie.”
“I’m glad Stark got punched. It’s a shame it only took 16 years.”
“And you’re attractive you know.” Tony leans casually against the counter. Steve peers up at him and Tony blushes. “Uh I mean...you have a nice...face.”
“Alpha, I’m so-”
Stepping down was the best choice. He would’ve done it a long time ago, but he needed to keep his son safe. Peter was older now, knew how to take care of himself. He still needed his father for some things, but pretty soon Peter would be all grownup and moving on with his life.
“I don’t know what you’re so afraid of, but figure out how to deal with it,” Steve says, then he’s slamming the door on his way out.
“Can I kiss you?” Tony glances up just in time to find Steve nodding his head. Tony moves closer, leaning in until their lips brush together. The kiss is careful, not lasting more than a few seconds.
“Do I look like I want to talk to you?”
“I do!”
“No. Honestly, even if I wanted to I couldn’t. I have no idea where you’re from and-”
Sam nods. “I know. I do too. We all do.”
“I’m not surprised. You’re so smart.”
“Yeah. Crazy right? Who would’ve thought we’d end up here?”
The base of Tony’s cock tingles, a clear indication that his knot was close to popping. He chases after his own pleasure, pushing the forming knot in and out, moans escaping him from the intense feeling of having the omega’s walls squeeze around the sensitive knot.
Bucky appears like he’s going to forfeit and turn away, but then he’s turning back around and slamming his metal fist into the wall beside Tony’s head.
“Never say never but if and when we do, he’s probably gonna be older and won’t need a nursery anymore.”
Peter was his son after all.
Peter doesn’t dare tell his best friend that it was a little late for that. He was already growing attached. He doesn’t want to, especially since he’s still indecisive about keeping the baby or giving it up. But he can’t help the new feelings he has now.
“Sir,” Jarvis pipes up. “Doctor Banner has arrived.”
“Yeah.” Steve nods and he picks at the top of the muffin. “I know. Your scent...coffee is the first thing I smell.”
Tony can’t help but smirk. “A romantic dinner and possibly dessert afterwards? Darling, I’d never be late for that.”
Steve is able to find his voice. “Tony!”
Pierce cries out when Steve grips him hard by his hair and slams his face forward, his broken nose spilling more blood. The alpha continues to fight against the leather straps keeping him in place.
“I know, I know. Just don’t look at it. I’m gonna get you in the shower okay?”
“I will,” Tony says. But he’s referring to something entirely different.
“It was.” Peter helps himself to the pizza and places a couple of slices on the paper plates the restaurant provided. “Disney World was our favorite place. We would go all the time.”
“Because it’s
But that all changed when Steve woke up in a new time period. The holiday was still the same, though maybe now it was worse, but what made it better was Tony.
With a huff Tony plops back down in the chair. He pulls out his phone while he waits, shooting a quick text to Natasha to check in. The last update he had gotten about Morgan was thirty minutes ago. She was probably still asleep, but Tony can’t help but check in anyway.
“Honey, it’s okay. Don’t cry. They’re okay.”
Steve had wanted to hold off on exposing his secret a little longer. Only his close friends knew and if Steve could have it his way, they’d be the only ones. The world didn’t need to know that the famous Captain America had a one night stand that resulted in an unplanned pregnancy. Especially if the other father was Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man. The press would have a field day with that information.
“Don’t,” Steve warns, pointing the knife in the alpha’s direction when he steps closer. Rollins follows and Steve directs his attention to him. “Don’t,” he growls.
Peter had started going by his superhero title now. Morgan couldn’t help but laugh when he told her he was Spider-Man. She couldn’t grasp the idea of him having the word ‘man’ in the title of his new name when he still acted like a little boy. That always started a fight between them.
“N-no,” Steve stammers. He lifts his head from where it’s been resting on Bucky’s shoulder, showing off more of the purple and black bruises. “I’m fine. I don’t need-”
“Uh sort of. We uh-wait, what does he want?”
“What?”
It’s Sam who gives him the strength and encouragement to finally speak. And all he needed to do was place a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
They would’ve walked away from each other anyway. Tony just decided to beat Steve to it.
“Honey, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean it.”
“Yeah. I thought about it and you were right. You weren’t trying to take anything away from me; you’re just trying to help, and I was just being stubborn.”
Becoming a parent is one of the most extraordinary yet terrifying experiences Steve has ever had. Steve had no clue how to be a mother. He was never given the chance to try.
“So what does that make the Avengers?”
“Don’t worry about him, Pete,” Steve assures and he takes his original spot at the table. “He’s just busy.”
“Please don’t go. I still need you. The team needs you. Dad needs you. Please, Papa, don’t go. Please don’t leave me.”
Rumlow chuckles again and backs off. For a moment Steve believes he’ll be left alone. He’d rather stay locked up in a dark room than be around Rumlow, but he’s not that lucky, and the alpha takes a hold of Steve again and leads him out of the room.
“I know.”
“Yeah. And you are too.”
“At least someone does.”
Tony groans and pulls Steve closer until their sweaty bodies are pressed up against each other. Steve tries to reach between them for his cock, only to pull back when Tony slaps his hand away.
It’s Steve who stops them from getting any closer. He lays one hand over Tony’s chest to stop him, but feeling Tony again, after so long, he can’t help but let his hand wander around the warm skin. His eyes fall shut, the urge to kiss Tony right now too strong. But he needs to fight the temptation.
“Don’t wanna.” Comes Peter’s response.
A fiery pain shoots through Steve’s shoulder but he ignores it. Rumlow fights back, struggling to break free and push the omega off. But Steve holds his ground, not giving the alpha a chance to escape.
“It’s very tempting but-” Steve untangles himself from Tony’s arms, chuckling at the frown that appears over his face. “-we did tell your friends about the shower.”
By the time the party comes to an end, Steve is exhausted. He’s had his fill of delicious food and it was beginning to make him drowsy. Peter had other ideas and seemed to be having a little party of his own. Maybe that second helping of cake hadn’t been a good idea.
It’s not enough.
Steve’s eyes lock with Tony’s, and the alpha slowly nods his head. “It’s okay,” Tony assures.
“You ramble too much.” Morgan giggles and Peter’s face flushes with embarrassment. “But yes, I’d like to help. I’m thinking maybe a pink suit this time. Maybe you can shoot glitter instead of webs.”
“I know your face.”
“Okay, I think you’re jumping ahead. We’re taking this slow. I’m just trying to keep him safe.”
“I get that. But you can’t properly heal unless you want to.”
Steve shakes his head. He doesn’t want to talk about it when he’s sharing this moment with an alpha that truly cares about him. But Tony asks again and Steve gives in.
“Do you want to hold him?”
Tony scoffs and finishes the water. He tries to stand and that’s when Steve rushes toward him, gently pulling him to his feet. Steve leads him to the bedroom, not letting go until he has Tony on the bed.
Steve’s eyes are shut and he’s frowning. He clings tightly to his pillow, another whimper escaping him. The change in his scent is what has Tony sitting up and leaning over the pup between them to gently shake Steve’s shoulder.
“I’ll survive. Besides, I still need to inform the team.”
It was a night that probably never should have happened. It only made leaving that much more difficult. But Steve didn’t need to know that. He probably didn’t feel anything anyway.
“We’re okay, right?” He asks. “I know the other day we kind of-”
The door to the conference room opens and Tony walks in. Just the sight and scent of his mate is enough to bring a smile to Steve’s face. Tony greets him the same way and comes over to comfort him. He must smell the sourness in Steve’s scent.
“Don’t mention it.” Tony hugs his son back, then he pats Peter’s shoulder and pulls away. “I guess this is perfect timing. I have designs for your room.”
“Steve?”
He senses the omega’s hesitation immediately. Tony scolds himself for coming on too strong. It was something he did a lot.
“Don’t,” Peter says. “Don’t say it.”
“Pete.” Natasha's eyes are sad and full of tears.
Peter rushes toward his father, pushing through to get to him. Sam tries to protest, but one look from Natasha has him backing away and allowing the teenager closer.
Peter nods and watches as his dad climbs into his car. Tony rolls down the window and Peter steps closer to say goodbye.
“I got you, sweetheart.”
Steve smiles, then it falters. He wouldn’t have his friends for a while.
But not to him. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. The light in the room didn’t offer much, but it was enough to illuminate the bright hair on her head. She squirms, small whimpers escaping her when she’s forced to endure the same harsh treatment the room has to offer. Steve brings her closer, hoping the natural warmth he produces would be enough.
Peter winces. “A little.”
I hope you all are doing good and had a good day! This chapter was a little on the short side but I hope you guys don’t mind. Thank you so much for reading!
“I guess she just needed you,” Tony says and Steve peers up at him. “She knows you better than me-”
Bucky nods and glances back down at the newborn when Peter stirs and his eyes flutter open. Peter yawns, the simple motion bringing a smile to his uncle’s face.
“I know.” Steve smiles.
“We don’t know for sure-”
Steve smiles. “Yeah. Peter fought me initially but I think he likes his own crib and room now. Harley also threw a fit because he had to take a nap. Know anything about that?”
Tony learns that Steve not only stayed with Bucky, but disappeared one night with him. Only a note addressed to Tony was left behind.
“Don’t. It’s okay to be overwhelmed. It’s a lot to take in.”
Peter shakes his head and turns on the faucet, cupping his hands under the water to gather some and rinse his mouth.
“Oh! Uh...before dinner I guess. Uncle Sam always makes dinner at 6.”
Steve is up bright and early, ready to start a new day. The sky is still dark, just the way Steve likes it. He hasn’t been on a run in a while-being a parent meant sacrifices-but now that his son was old enough, it was time he tagged along.
Bucky smiles smugly and cuddles his new pet.
Peter hasn’t even registered the tears in his eyes until small drops of water land on the letter. He quickly tries to wipe them away and not smear the ink. He reads over it again and again and again until he’s sure it’s embedded in his mind. It was all he had left.
“You don’t even know my situation.”
Tony huffs out a small laugh. “I hate it when you do that.”
“Sounds good to me,” Tony eventually answers the question. He’s occupied with the dough, his hands in the glass bowl and sticky. Steve can’t help but giggle when Tony makes a face. “What?” Tony narrows his eyes at Steve.
Peter’s smile falters and he picks at the pepperoni on his pizza. “He was busy. He always had superhero stuff. I’m not saying he abandoned me, but there were times when I hated what he did. He’d always be gone for too long or when he did come back he’d be beaten and...and I hated it.”
“Anything. I’m sorry I’m the worst boyfriend ever. You can punish me if you want.” Tony waggles his brows and this time Steve does get away from him.
“We can take this to go.” Tony suggests and he waves over the waiter to ask for both a box and the check.
Tony takes his time with this part, not wanting to hurt Steve. He teases Steve’s entrance, then slowly pushes the tip of his finger inside. His eyes flicker up to Steve’s face, looking for any signs of discomfort in his features. When he finds none, he presses in a little more until his finger sinks in all the way. Steve moans and clenches down, desperate for more. Tony gives it to him and he adds another finger, using them to stretch and scissor his husband open.
I think it’s time Steve and Tony find out 😉
“Yeah.” Steve rubs the back of his neck nervously.
“It’s not.” Bucky shrugs Sam off. “And I wish everyone would stop pretending that it was.”
“I was just wondering if you could help me with-”
“Thank God! I mean it wouldn’t be the end of the world but a baby right now would just be-wait, not yours? Whose is it?”
“Yeah well...I guess I deserve it.”
Lucky for Peter, he finds Flash alone.
“Yeah,” Steve replies with a yawn and he sets the paper down to stretch. “I think around 4. I couldn’t go back to sleep.”
It angers him to know that this omega was being abused. And while he was pregnant. What kind of alpha would hurt their mate and risk the life of their unborn child? Tony is quickly reminded that Steve wasn’t bonded. He needed more of his story.
As if on cue, Steve is emerging from the bedroom and entering the living room. He’s dressed and has his hair nicely groomed; it’s a look Tony hasn’t seen in a while. Since the baby, Steve has cared less and less about his appearance. He preferred to lounge around in his track pants and a plain t-shirt. Tony didn’t care what his husband chose to wear, but seeing him put some effort in his appearance made him wonder if he was feeling like himself again.
“I’m done contributing.”
He didn’t have a chance to go home and get what he needed for the delivery. As soon as he announced that he was in labor, Fury ordered him out and he was rushed to the medbay. The mission still carried on and he was left to say goodbye to his friends once he was settled in his private room.
“Just say it,” Tony says.
Bucky sighs and enters the living room, sitting down on the couch and leaning forward to get a view of the picture Peter found more interesting than food. He’s not surprised to find a picture of his best friend and nephew together.
“I needed a distraction,” Tony says, turning around to pick up where he left off. He doesn’t get very far.
Steve nods and sits down, curling up with a blanket and taking a sip of his tea before replying, “Yeah. I just feel off.”
Steve smiles softly and caresses Tony’s cheek. “It’s okay. I’m giving my consent. At least you made sure to wait until I did.”
“What else does he need?” Tony asks, moving along the aisles and studying the shelves. “Probably more clothes, but we can hit that section later. Bottles? Or are you going to…” he waves a hand around his chest, causing Steve to blush.
“I don’t know what I did either.”
With her quiet and content in his arms, Steve allows himself to rest. He rests his head against the wall and closes his eyes. He’s still on high alert, listening for any sign of the dangers lurking outside.
“I think I have an idea.”
“And we appreciate it, but if you need a moment to yourself then tell me. Something is going on with you, more than just needing a break.”
“We’re not done.”
“Forget it,” Tony rubs at his head, hoping to rid himself from the ache their conversation has brought on. “We can talk more later. I’m sure you want to rest, maybe take a shower. Happy should be back soon with some clothes.”
“Not yours but I’ve heard stories from others who have been. There’s a lot of alphas out there that are real assholes, even some betas. But Tony’s not one of them and you have no reason to doubt him.”
“A little.”
Steve looks over his shoulder to shoot Tony a smile. “It’s for both of you. You are his...we agreed dad, right?”
It was pathetic loving someone who was never going to love him back. He wishes that they never met. He was better off working alone and marrying Pepper one day. But the vision of them together was clouded. All he could see was Steve.
“I know,” Steve groans and rubs at his lower back. “Kind of hoping he comes soon.”
“Not really. I’m having a baby,” Steve grits out. He groans again. “Shit. It hurts.”
“Yeah!” Peter adds. “You’re all you got.”
“Unfortunately that information is classified. We’re here to help find out where he’s located and bring him in. If you have any information then please come forward.”
“You won’t. What happened that night-”
He could do this.
His knot softens and Tony pulls out. He keeps himself on top of the omega, eyes shut and chest rising and falling rapidly. He’s afraid to move. His legs feel unsteady.
His shoes echo loudly once he steps through the front door and into one of the biggest living rooms he’s ever seen. He can vividly remember the small one he walked into every time he stepped through the door of his one bedroom apartment, but this place was unlike anything Steve’s ever imagined. He came from rags while it was evident Tony was from riches.
“No, I get that,” Tony sighs. “Never mind.”
Yay I'm so proud of myself for updating again!
It’s not just Dodger that’s smothering him. Tony had taken it upon himself to spoil Steve, and just like Dodger, he was always lingering. Steve understood, he was just as cautious about doing everything right, but there was a line there and his boyfriend and dog had started to cross it.
Steve smiles softly. “Yeah she does. I think she’s trying to put her toes in too.”
“No.” Steve shakes his head. “I want someone else. Find our son and bring him back.”
Pepper nods and sets her glass down. “I want to apologize for how we first met. I probably came off a little...unwelcoming. At the time I thought you were just another one of Tony’s booty calls. I’m sorry I judged you.”
With his son distracted, it’s easy to sneak in an attack. Peter dodges it quickly, no doubt using his spider senses to aid him.
Steve screams and throws his head back. His lower half burns, the pain so intense it brings tears to his eyes. He can still hear Tony counting and he forces himself to keep going.
Morgan’s cries are louder, but it’s not just the sound she’s making that worries Tony. His ears finally pick up on Steve-he sounds upset. Tony pushes the door to the nursery open, walking straight into a scene he thought he’d never have to witness again.
“I’m on my way home, dear. Meeting ran a little longer than- are you okay?”
The first few presents are harmless:baby clothes, bottles, pacifiers, a diaper bag; things Steve was already expecting. Then came other items like a baby monitor and a bottle warmer and a few large items such as a car seat and stroller. Steve appreciated the monitor but he was positive Jarvis would be alerting them about Peter throughout the night.
Peter rolls his eyes and turns back toward the window. He wishes he had gone to see his papa instead.
Tony gives a glance around the room, frowning when he realizes he went overboard with the decorations. More was still needed to be done. The caterer would arrive soon with an array of food and a cake probably too big for just five people. And that wasn’t even including the gifts.
“Stop!” Peter screams. “My name is Peter! All you refer to me as is ‘kid’. Do you even think of me as your son? Or are you doing this  because you screwed up and feel guilty?”
This time Steve glances up to meet Tony’s eyes, shooting him a small smile. “We’ll be okay. I think I’m getting the hang of this.”
“Damn you, Steve,” Tony curses, his anger building. It wasn’t as if any of this was Steve’s fault. It wasn’t like Steve knew he was going to die so unexpectedly. But damn did it hurt. It hurt badly. “Fuck,” Tony grumbles and angrily wipes at the tears that roll down his face.
“Ignore the mess,” Tony says when he catches Steve’s wandering eyes. He returns to his original task of cleaning up. “I’m working on it.”
Steve scoffs and slips his hands free. “Better? Sure. This is better. This is better for who, Tony? Our son? Me? No, it’s better for you.”
“Yeah. I guess it is.”
“We can stop,” he whispers. His hands rub along Steve’s shoulders and down to his arms. “You don’t have to help me.”
, the voice taunts. Tony ignores it and continues to drive them to the tower.
His pleas go unheard.
“Do you always ramble?”
“Sit,” Alpha gestures toward the small table and chairs that are usually set up for dinnertime. Steve’s eyes flicker in the direction of the furniture, brows drawing together in confusion when he notices the two plates set up. It’s like the alpha could read his mind. “You’re joining me for dinner tonight,” he explains and he waves the omega over. “Sit, sit. You must be exhausted.”
Tony finds it on the next thrust, curling his finger to stimulate the sensitive gland. Steve cries out, back lifting off the bed and eyes squeezing shut. Tony fucks him harder with his fingers, plowing them through the abundance of slick that leaks out of Steve’s hole. Tony carefully slides his fingers free, marveling at the wetness coating his fingers.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers and Peter holds him tighter. “I’m so sorry.”
“I’m not an easy person to get along with either. Not all of this is your fault. I want to make this work, Tony, and not just because of our son. He shouldn’t be the only reason why we get back together. In the long run it won’t be good for anyone.”
“No,” Natasha rolls her eyes. “He’s getting emotional. It’s a big day for all of us.”
Tony leans in for another kiss, their lips brushing for a moment before Happy interrupts.
“Please?” Steve tries again.
“Doctor, please!” Steve begs and more tears spill from his eyes.
Ned nods, then he’s frowning. “Did you tell-”
“It’s okay,” Steve soothes, hoping to coax his son back to him. He stretches out a hand and James eyes it for a moment, then he takes it. Steve smiles. “I won’t hurt you. Mama will never hurt you.”
“I’m sorry. I can’t...it’s hard.”
Bucky scoffs and rips his hand away. He was finally letting it out.
The nursery is finally complete and all of the items Steve received for his baby shower have a home and are neatly put away. There was only a few weeks left until he’d be welcoming his baby boy, and there was still more that needed to be done.
“M-ma? M-mama?” James stutters and cowers away.
“Don’t make me go. Please, Tony, don’t make me go.” Steve is in hysterics; tears are running down his face and he releases small sobs and whimpers.
“There,” she says in her native tongue and points at a large glass window. Behind it is a smaller room. Tony instantly recognizes it.
Steve kisses him again. Tony pulls Steve closer until their bodies are pressed up against each other. He uses both hands to cup Steve’s face and deepens the kiss, both moaning softly in response. Steve gasps when he’s pressed into the counter.
Steve nods in understanding. Maybe he wasn’t the only one with trust issues.
His warning goes ignored and the room erupts with laughter. Steve frowns, face turning red from both embarrassment and anger.
Tony tenses. The description was vague and could describe just about anyone walking the streets, but he can’t help but wonder if the mysterious blue-eyed man he has in his conference room is the one Alexander is searching for. Tony doesn’t want to jump to conclusions, but if the omega Tony saved is the one, he doesn’t want to let the alpha know that.
“I don’t want to go to school,” he huffs and collapses backwards.
“I’m his best friend so I’m cutting,” Bucky says, only to halt when Natasha holds up a warning finger. “Or not. Here’s fine.”
“Hey.” Tony rounds the island to get to Steve and he places both hands over his shoulders. “I want to. I think I owe it to you.”
“No, it’s okay. Can you take her? Just for a bit? I need a moment. Please, Nat?”
“I think he’s good,” Tony says and he glances back in Steve’s direction, finding the omega on the verge of passing out. “Go to sleep, Steve.”
“Tony, wait. I wanted to tell you-”
“I’ll-”
“That’s what I keep telling him,” Steve says and he takes the spot beside his husband. “He doesn’t listen to me.”
Jarvis complies and shows the footage Tony had struggled to watch. It still hurts to see Steve’s smiling face and hear the sound of his laughter. But Tony forces himself to watch the full video.
The only perk of carrying a pup is the lack of abuse. He’s handled carefully and no longer required to be restrained when he’s outside of his room. The pup in his belly was the only thing saving him from hours of torture.
“Deal.”
Steve nods and stands up from the chair. “I’ll let the team know.”
“I’m almost done here. Sam and I-” Steve winces when he realizes he’s forgotten to introduce his friend. He turns around to face Sam and apologizes. “I’m so sorry. I wasn’t deliberately trying to ignore you.”
As usual, Morgan is up early and demanding food. Steve stirs from the familiar sound, but before he can get up, Tony is already climbing out of bed to tend to her.
Tony connects their lips again, this time deepening the kiss. He pushes Steve back until he’s lying flat on his back with Tony hovering over him. The kiss grows more heated and passionate. Steve moans softly when Tony’s tongue brushes against his lips, begging for access.
“What a hell of a day.”
“I’m sorry, Peter. I shouldn’t have-”
“I have. But now I relate. She can’t have a baby and I can’t have a baby and-and-”
“It’s a great name!”
“You know why, Steve. Come on, don’t make me say it,” Tony says.
The woman-another beta- is screaming and Tony quickly lowers his gun and places a finger to his lips, signaling her to be quiet.
Dodger woofs in response, his tail wagging happily. He places both of his front legs on the couch cushion and leans in close to sniff and lick along Peter’s face. Peter’s face contorts and a loud wail escapes his pouty lips. Dodger ignores the shrill cry and continues to lick Peter’s face.
Steve shakes his head, not wanting to believe that he could be carrying his abuser’s pup. He was only supposed to carry Tony’s. Tony was the alpha that loved him. Tony was his mate.
“I’ll see you later okay?” Natasha says.
“Yep! Dodger can help me.” Peter throws his arms around Dodger’s neck, giggling when he’s given slobbery kisses.
“Hey, Fri? Keep an eye on them will you?”
“T-Tony, please?” Steve whimpers when they break apart.
Tony smiles at those words. “Good to know. I got worried for a moment.”
“Hey,” Tony greets, shifting uncomfortably in the doorway. “ I hope you weren’t too uncomfortable back there. I swear Bruce is a good guy.”
Nick nods. “Then I guess congratulations are in order.”
“Move,” Steve urges, clenching down to get his alpha moving.
“Shit,” Peter curses when the floor beneath him shakes and he stumbles. There was no way in hell using the walls as his advantage was going to work now; they were crumbling around him.
“I had to do it. He tied me up and blindfolded me so I couldn’t see your face. I have to let you do it.”
Tony sighs. “If I can feed her then you can get some sleep. That’s all I was trying to gain from this. I want to help.”
Steve chuckles and gives Tony another kiss, pulling back when Peter stirs. Steve smiles down at him and runs his fingers through the messy curls on Peter’s head.
Morgan’s cries die down and her dark eyes open, revealing the tears in them. Their eyes meet and Tony smiles down at her. He offers the bottle again and this time she takes it without a fuss.
“Harley is pretty cute. I kind of like that one,” Steve says.
“I know, Sarah. But brothers aren’t that bad,” Steve tries to assure, but he’s failing miserably when his daughter continues to cry into his neck.
“Do you? Forget it. I don’t care if you come to bed or not.”
Just like the path, the gazebo is decorated with strings of white lights. Inside, the wooden base is covered with red rose petals and candles. Tony is in the center of the petals, a bright smile on his face.
“Cramps? Steve, maybe you should get checked out.”
“My suit!”
When Peter nods his head, Tony sighs sadly and puts the picture back in the journal. He pulls his son close again.
“It’s okay,” Tony soothes and wraps his arms protectively around Steve. “You’re safe.”
Steve had complained about Dodger’s smothering in the past, but as of late he’s kept quiet and never voiced his complaints. That didn’t stop Tony from trying to get Dodger to hang out with him every now and then, but Dodger was stubborn and Steve was forced to accept that the remainder of his pregnancy was going to be spent with their furry friend.
Hello! Hope everyone is doing good! I've been feeling a little better. I can't taste or smell and that's depressing, but at least I have my stories and lovely readers to lift my spirits.
“Good,” Tony grins, perhaps a little too smugly. “It’s supposed to.”
“Is the baby making him sick again?”
Peter sniffs again and uses the sleeve of his hoodie to wipe his eyes. “It’s okay. Sorry. I’m a big baby, huh?”
“You told me that you needed him, that you needed me. But the truth is I’m the one who needs you. You came into my life unexpectedly, throwing one of the biggest curveballs at me, but I don’t regret even a second of it. I need you, Pete. You make me want to do better, to be better. I don’t know what I’d do without you. And if you still want space, then I’ll give it, no questions asked. I just wanted to stop by and give you your birthday present.”
“This isn’t the fifties.” Pepper laughs.
“Okay.”
There was no point dancing around and Steve gets straight to business. It’s difficult to get the words out, but once he does, it’s like a heavy weight was lifted off his chest and he could breathe again. Then Nick is silent and Steve begins to fear the worst.
“I heard you guys talking last night,” Peter says, and he nervously glances at his uncles.
“Good.” He’s praised for his good behavior, it makes Steve sick.
“Da?” Peter turns and points at the door again. His face lights up. “Da!”
Tony frowns in response to the question. He opens his mouth to speak, only to shut it when he can’t properly form a response. He doesn’t understand what Steve means.
“He looks so much like you,” Tony comments, his eyes taking in the same familiar features Steve had been doing. “We don’t have a name for him, huh?”
Steve’s sitting cross legged in the middle of the room with Morgan. He’s helping her balance on her tiny legs and she giggles and bounces in delight.
“Hey.” Tony smiles and steps further into the room, his eyes immediately landing on the bundle in his husband’s arms. His smile grows wider. “Wow. She’s here.”
He’s trying. He’s trying so hard to make things right and get back to where they used to be. Where
“I screwed up. Is that what you want to hear?”
“Yes.” Tony rolls his eyes and throws an arm over Peter’s shoulder, leading him further into the apartment. “Can you handle this, kiddo?”
“It’s my fault, Tony. I never should’ve ran away.”
Tony rolls over, a heavy sigh leaving him at the sight of the empty spot beside him. He reaches out and lays a hand over the place Steve normally lies. It’s cold to the touch.
“Really?” Steve frowns and rolls his eyes when Tony shrugs his shoulders. “This is ridiculous. All I wanted was for us to name him and you’re hating all of my suggestions. I don’t see you helping.”
Steve rolls his eyes and dumps the coffee down the drain, making sure to pour Tony’s first. “Fine.”
The rest of the room is filled with what Steve can only assume is state of the art technology. Tony was a genius and an incredible inventor. It made sense that everything in his tower was created to be the best.
Tony smiles and situates the tray over Steve’s middle. It’s a little wobbly due to the large baby bump he’s sporting. Tony curls up beside Steve and snatches a strip of bacon from off the plate, munching on it happily.
Steve’s eyes fill with tears. Their son whimpers again and both their eyes fall on the tiny pup.
Steve huffs and runs a hand over the black material, guessing it cost way too damn much. The tie Tony had placed with it catches Steve’s eye and he takes it into his hand, enjoying the silky texture. It’s red; Tony’s favorite color.
“This is your fault!” Peter screams angrily at the statue. “You lied to me! You promised you’d always come back and you lied!”
Tony smirks and spreads his legs a bit, showing off the bulge in his underwear. That sight alone is enough to send all of the blood in Steve’s body down south. His own cock stirs in interest.
Tony fights the urge. He wasn’t about to force himself on this omega. He was raised better than that. He may have a past playboy reputation, but even in those days he knew how to respect omegas. They weren’t property and sexual objects.
“You didn’t give him my passcode did you?”
“I’ll take care of you, Mr. Stark,” Alexander promises. Tony doesn’t see the sinister grin on his face.
“Alpha, please!”
“I know,” Tony mocks sympathy and hands Steve the steaming mug of tea. “I made this to help.”
He shakes his head at that thought.
“If he doesn’t-Nat, I don’t know what I’ll do. I still-”
“I just think you need to take this seriously-”
Perhaps to Tony this was how breakups were supposed to go. Given his reputation for having a lot of relationships, this must be how he always ends them. But to Steve… sleeping together didn’t seem right.
They eat and watch the show in silence. There’s still some awkwardness but Steve would rather have that than Happy giving him the cold shoulder. They were still strangers, and it was going to take time to get to know each other.
Steve rests his head on Tony’s shoulder and continues to sob for the little boy they lost. Tony cries along with him. He cries for their son, but he also cries for his actions. He’s the one responsible for the heavy loss.
He decides to tell another person.
He didn’t know how to express his fear of a possible pregnancy when Tony was dealing with enough as it is. The moment they returned home Tony was left to meet with the press and tell his story. He didn’t go into a lot of details, making sure to leave out Steve and their pups. Steve wasn’t ready yet and Tony respected that. He’ll face the world one day.
He reaches for the glass and chugs it down.
“Yeah.” Steve nods and glances back down at the test still in his hand. Tony had suggested he read the results. Steve had been nervous at first, afraid of getting his dreams crushed again. But now it’s starting to sink in, and he couldn’t be happier.
“Maybe. Can we talk about it later? I don’t want to ruin another party.”
“Not bad.” Tony lets his eyes scan around the room, frowning at the thought of Steve having to call this place home when home was back with him and Morgan, back with their friends at the compound. This didn’t compare. “At least you have TV.”
“I got it,” Tony mumbles beside him. He’s exhausted, more so than he’s ever been, but he wants to do this. He wants to be a dad. “Go back to sleep.”
“Uh-huh.” Tony’s voice is lower, more seductive than before. He steps closer, crowding Steve’s space and pressing up against him. “Wanna try it, sweetheart? Will you let me tie you up?”
“What? Why?”
For a moment he forgets that their relationship is ending. It’s hard to think about anything else when Tony is currently pleasuring him in the best way possible. The feel of Tony inside of him is unlike Steve has ever experienced. He was going to miss this.
“Aw.” Tony pretends to be hurt. “I was really hoping you’d want a fairytale wedding. I know a guy with a horse and carriage.”
“Come get your friend please,” Happy grumbles. “We’ll be up in five minutes.”
“I don’t want to pet him. Just- Steve, get him out of here.” Tony steps back, keeping one hand out just in case he needs to protect himself. The dog comes closer, his slobbery tongue making contact with Tony’s outstretched hand.
Morgan is at least thankful she was mentioned.
Flash approaches them, eyeing Ned for a moment before settling his gaze on Peter. “Can we talk? Alone?”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “So James is our only angelic one?”
“You’re lucky you get to do it though. I wanted this more than anything.” Steve rubs circles over the bump. “Thank you for giving me a son. Thank you for doing this for me...because you didn’t have to.”
“Dad’s here,” Peter begins and he sighs again. “He left though. Maybe next time he’ll stay and talk to you. I don’t know. He’s...kind of difficult. I’m trying to get to know him and so far it’s been...fine. I’m still learning about him.
“Yeah,” Steve winces at the memory of the muffin he destroyed. “I’m sorry about breakfast. I’m sure it would have been good.”
“Should’ve worn the suit,” Tony sighs when the traffic moves only to come to a halt a few minutes later. “Definitely should’ve worn the suit.”
“Steve? Steve!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What the hell was that for?” he asks, grabbing his cheek.
“I’m sorry. Tony, I didn’t mean-what he did back there-”
“It’s okay. I’m sorry Uncle Bucky hit you and said all those things. I know you didn’t kill him. I guess he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.”
“I’m not skilled with cakes or anything but I tried,” Peter says with a little shrug. “Do you like it?”
Steve can’t help but flinch when his cheek is gently patted.
They barely speak after their fight. Steve calls to check in on Peter, but other than that he doesn’t have anything to say to Tony. He comes by sometimes, but it’s to never talk and work things out. Tony gets it. It was his fault they were fighting again. So much for being closer.
“The truth, Tony! The truth!” Pepper exclaims, throwing her hands up in the air. Tony waits, expecting another outburst, but then she calms herself down with a deep breath and places her hands over her hips. “You should’ve told him how you really feel. Why is that so difficult for you?”
There’s still a part of him that’s hesitant to trust Tony. They knew nothing about each other and yet by some strange turn of events, Steve now finds himself living with the man he never thought he’d see again. The plan was never to bump into the alpha that sired his pup. All Steve wanted was to get away from Hydra and start over.
Steve pats his belly, wincing when a sharp pain shoots through it. He hisses from the discomfort and shifts in his seat. It leaves as soon as it appears.
“Steve?” Tony says softly and the small sobs Steve makes die down instantly. “Hey, you okay?” Tony asks, stepping further into the room until he’s standing near the opposite side of the bed. Steve’s back is still facing him, but Tony can see the movement of his head when he nods in response.
There’s a tension in the room that Steve had been expecting. It wasn’t everyday that he was asking the Director if he could recruit and train new members. Nick had been ready to listen, knowing that the Captain was getting ready to step down and allow someone else to take his place. He just didn’t think it would be a fifteen-year-old kid.
More drama! Don’t worry Tony will apologize and all will be well again....for now. Just wait until Tony shows Peter the last voicemail 😈
“I know, but he’s here now. He said something about you wanting to see him again and-Tony, what’s wrong?”
Morgan keeps nursing from the bottle, completely unaware of the words being spoken to her. She’s calm, though, something Tony is thankful for. He doesn’t want to interrupt Steve again.
She turns her head in Steve’s direction when he doesn’t respond, finding him already asleep. She smiles and adjusts the blankets around him.
“Let me help you up. We can get you a ride home and discuss this some other time.”
“Sorry, buddy,” Tony apologizes. “I needed...space.”
“Of course, sir. Anything else?”
“What the hell is she doing?” Sam frowns and tries to move the cat away, only to yank his hand back when she hisses at him. “Evil cat. Go away.”
Peter squeezes his eyes shut. He waits for the beating to stop. He waits for the fingers to stop threading through his hair.
Morgan started to realize the changes two months after her brother started training. It seemed like more and more of whatever time their parents had to spare went to him or Harley. It made sense with Harley since he was only 4, soon to be 5, and needed the extra attention. But Morgan was sure she would be getting some of their love too. She was their middle child. That had to count for something.
“Even bigger clothes?”
“I know.” Steve smiles sympathetically. “But it’ll get better.”
There was good news waiting for them when they’re allowed to see their son. The less wires and tubes around him was a good sign. The baby was breathing on his own, something both parents and medical staff didn’t expect to happen so quickly. Steve wonders if the serum had anything to do with his son’s health.
“You’re not disgusting. You could never be. I don’t know why you see yourself that way.”
Tony’s phone buzzes in his pocket and reaches for it, huffing at the incoming messages he receives. He knew Pepper wasn’t going to be thrilled for his tardiness.
“It’s after 4. I always get home at this time,” Morgan says and plops down in the chair beside her father.
This time he does sob and Natasha quickly pulls him into a hug. He holds onto her tightly, burying his face in her chest and releasing all the sobs he tried to contain. No one even bats an eye at his behavior. They understood the pain that came with losing one of their own. But none of them would hurt more than him. They had lost a friend, a brother, a hero. But Peter lost a parent. The only parent he had.
“I wanted a family, yeah. But being pregnant…” Tony sighs. “I gotta be honest with you but it sucks. I love this kiddo,I really do, but damn it making him is...it’s hard.”
“Oh yeah of course. I love puking my guts out every second of every day.”
“I guess this is it,” Steve says. He reaches up with one hand to wipe away the tear that rolls down his face. “I’m going to miss you.”
“I love you.”
But he can’t lie to his son. They were supposed to be creating a bond. Lying wasn’t going to make them grow closer. He had lied to Steve and the last thing he wanted to do was lie to his son.
“Okay. I’ll get the doctor.”
They’ve never experienced something like this before. They had been lucky when it came to Peter. The pregnancy had its uncomfortable moments like all do, but at the end of it all they were blessed with a healthy, baby boy.
Tony shrugs. “You said the simple life wasn’t something you wanted anymore.”
“Ignoring you? I haven’t ignored you, and I’m sorry you hate Dodger being everywhere but this is his home too. Unless you want me to throw him out?”
Tony nods, but hesitates to return to the room. “You’re going to stay, right? I can’t imagine you flying back now. I have a room.”
Steve’s jolted awake by a loud bang. He sits up quickly and does a scan of the room, finding that he’s alone. His brows furrow in confusion. He remembered Tony being with him.
On his way out, he can’t help but stop by his father’s office. The door is slightly ajar and he finds himself pushing it the rest of the way and stepping inside. Just like the rest of their home, the space is immaculate. Peter’s almost afraid him being in the room would somehow disrupt how his papa left it, but he can’t help but want to stay a little longer.
Steve’s expression softens. “It’s a little scary.”
“I don’t want to rush you. I’ll wait if I have to. I just...there’s something here, Steve. I want to be near you all the time. And I don’t know, maybe it’s my alpha wanting to protect you, but I don’t think that’s the only reason.”
“Can I...can I hear the audio? I just want to hear his voice.”
Morgan nods. “Will he be here tomorrow? He promised he’d help with my science project. It’s not due yet but I wanted to get a head start.”
“If he...if he doesn’t make it...I don’t know what I’ll do.”
“The baby…” Tony pauses, unable to form the right words. He shares another look with Steve, silently pleading for him to take over. But he can’t let Steve do that. It wouldn’t be right. Steve was suffering with so much already. “The baby...the baby was…”
“Just...thinking.”
“Tony! It hurts!” Steve cries. Tears fill his eyes and roll down his face, leaving behind wet tracks. He clings to Tony tighter, whimpering and crying when the contraction peaks.
“Well now that you’re all here…” Steve trails off, the smile on his face growing brighter. “I have a surprise.”
“You don’t know anything. You think you know him but you don’t,” Peter says, his tone bitter.
“I think I want to. It’s part of healing, right?” Peter looks up at his dad for affirmation.
“He misses you too,” Sam says and rises to his feet. “I’m not going to stop you from wanting to see him. The decision is yours okay? But make sure you come back for cake.”
“There we go. All better.” Tony tells her while he gently wipes around her mouth. He glances up at Steve. “You gonna get ready?”
Steve glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. “No. I want him to have your name...or I don’t know...both? Stark-Rogers works, right?”
“Or a boy and then a girl.”
“Is he okay?” Steve asks, remembering how early he had gone into labor.
“It’s not your fault. These things happen, honey. It’s not your fault.”
“Wait, is it a boy or girl?”
Making a lucky guess and crossing his fingers, Tony presses the button for the third floor. The elevator jolts to life and Tony staggers backwards, his bare feet stepping into a warm puddle of blood. He wishes Pierce would have had the decency to kidnap him with shoes.
Peter gives a small shrug in response. “Kinda...I don’t know. We haven’t...talked much.”
“Yeah. Go ahead and sleep. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“I thought perfect alpha’s don’t exist?” Tony says.
Steve cries out and reaches for the band of his pants, shoving them down his legs until they’re around his ankles. A part of him feels ashamed for being this exposed to Happy, but the other half of him can’t bring himself to care. He was giving birth. No one said it was going to be pretty.
“Okay fine. Add more about how you love him and all that gooey romantic crap.”
“Don’t be a hard ass on him. He needs us now more than ever.”
“Exactly! He’s a kid. I didn’t want this for him. I wanted him to be better than me. Now he has to sacrifice everything like I-”
Tony wraps both arms around himself, trying to bring some sort of comfort from the excruciating pain. He can’t imagine what Steve was going through. Steve was the one who had to experience this tragedy from another level. He was the one who carried and nourished their child. He was the one who had to suffer losing the baby.
“At least he won’t be sneaking out anymore,” Bruce says, then he turns toward Sam and Bucky. “How did he manage to get past you guys?”
“Ah fuck!” Steve cries out from a particular hard thrust from Tony. He arches his back, a loud moan slipping past his parted lips when Tony continues to move inside of him at an unforgiving pace.
Steve smiles again and presses their lips together. “Then do it, alpha,” he murmurs against Tony’s lips.
They fall into silence again.
“How would you know? You haven’t-”
Now if only he could share all of that with the alpha seated in front of him.
Tony’s knot eventually softens and he pulls out. They curl up against each other, scenting the other and sharing loving kisses. It’s not until Peter’s cries from down the hall interrupt and Steve is forced to get out of bed. He quickly slips on his sweats and purposely steals Tony’s t-shirt.
“Shit. We better go.”
She was useless.
“We are?”
Bucky rolls his eyes and stands. “Oh for Christ’s sake. He knew what we were doing.”
“He’s looking good,” Bruce pipes up. His presence had nearly been forgotten since he announced the gender to the two parents. “Steve, keep doing what you’re doing. Your son is in good hands.”
Steve nods. “An alpha and beta found us.”
Bucky smiles again and wraps an arm around his nephew and brings him close.
“Yeah,” Tony answers. The last thing he needs is for Steve to believe he’s unable to care for their son. He still had five more days left with him before they were switching again. “We did a tour of the facility and then came here for lunch.”
“Are you back to yell at me? Make me feel like an asshole. I know I’m an asshole.”
“You’re in trouble. Alpha won’t be pleased with you once he finds out.”
It's tempting to do just that, but avoiding the other wasn’t going to fix anything. Communication wasn’t always their strong suit. They were getting better, but they still had their moments.
Tony is sitting in the chair beside him, oddly quiet now that they were alone. Just a few minutes ago he had been asking the doctor all sorts of questions. He was determined to know the reason behind the miscarriage, but unfortunately he was left with none.
“Now you can have a break.”
I will also be getting into his backstory in the next chapter! Thank you for reading!
It wasn’t just his sarcastic side that Steve had fallen in love with. It was no secret that Tony usually kept to himself. The walls he had built were specifically designed to never come down, but with time, not all structures remain standing.
Steve shakes his head. His eyes appear shiny and Tony wishes he had a tissue to offer him right about now.
Tony moves closer to be near his little family. He wraps them in his arms, holding them close. It was a promise that he’d never let them go.
“Me? Nervous? Nah. I’m peachy. This’ll be fun. But not too fun. I’ve changed my ways.”
A part of him wanted to flee the school or pretend that he was sick. His principal should understand. There had been some hesitancy about Peter coming back anyway. Maybe it was too soon for someone to return to school after losing a parent. Whatever the reason, Peter didn’t care. He wanted to go to school. He
“Sometimes it’s too big. Sometimes I wonder if I should go off the grid, live somewhere quiet and away from this.”
Tony huffs. “Please? I swear it’s not as bad as you think. He’s not like the others.”
“But, dad my project!” Morgan whines.
“I kind of figured that much. Guess we’re not good at having a relationship or ending it,” Steve says.
“How will I know you’ll answer?”
“We can stop.”
Maybe Tony would get lucky and the pregnancy would fail. It was a miracle they were pregnant in the first place. Tony thought for sure that the serum would intervene and make conceiving difficult for them. But it turns out Steve was the lucky one. He was getting what he wanted.
“I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes for what feels like the hundredth time. And that was just since this morning. He had to be at SI for the meeting in an hour and if he was even a minute late Pepper would have his head. Steve doesn’t appear as upset as he did on the day Tony first broke the news, but it was clear that he was still annoyed. “I’ll be back later,” Tony assures as he straightens his tie. He sneaks a glance in the mirror, meeting Steve’s eyes.
“Jarvis-”
“You’re not upset, right? You’re excited?”
“Hey,” he greets softly and Steve snaps his head up to send Tony a smile. “How is he?”
He glances up from the test, unable to stare at it any longer. The sight he finds is much worse. Steve’s smile is almost identical to the one the smiley face wears. Shit. Maybe Tony was supposed to be happy.
The last thing he ever expected was to crawl out from the hole he’s being hiding in and receive another letter from Steve. He hasn’t heard from him in years. Of course it was him who had blocked all calls and messages from Steve, but the letters he still got. It was tempting to just forward them back, but he kept every single one of them. He never had the courage to read them and disregarded them like everything else in his life.
“Okay.” Pepper nods. “Take care, Tony.”
Pepper offers him a small compact mirror. Tony takes a look at his face, frowning slightly at the sight staring back at him. He reaches up and gingerly touches the bruise on his cheek, wincing from the tenderness.
“I don’t know if you know this but babies have their own schedule. If this kid wants out now then he’s coming.”
I’ll update soon!
“Yeah,” Tony waves him off. But Steve can see right through the act. “Don’t know what hit me.”
“I love it when you beg.” Tony doesn’t let up and he picks up the pace, fucking Steve hard and fast with his fingers. Steve responds with a moan and his walls tighten around Tony’s fingers.
Being up in his penthouse beats stuck in his office all day, but even the comfort of his own home fails to distract him from his thoughts. He spends most of his time locked away in his lab, tinkering and updating projects that needed his attention. But even then he struggles to focus.
“Are you...okay?” Peter asks.
Steve’s lips curve into a small smile. He works quietly on tying the tie, and once finished, he runs his fingers over it to smooth out any wrinkles. “Don’t be late. I was thinking maybe dinner and if Morgan falls asleep early…”
“So beautiful,” he says, and reaches out to touch Steve’s chest. The omega gasps when that same hand travels lower and lingers over his belly. They had said they’d wait until the other pups were older, but Tony still can’t help but imagine his mate pregnant all over again.
“Yeah. What’s that?”
So when he comes home one afternoon after a failed attempt at Halloween costume shopping with their 5-year-old son, Peter, he can’t help but shake his head at what he finds. Their apartment is once again ready for the holiday. Ghosts, spiders, skeletons; anything and everything creepy was hanging from the ceiling or decorating the walls. The stairs leading up the upper floor were covered in webs and fake spiders.
Tony decides some music might do some good and he puts on AC/DC. He instantly relaxes.
“But what about us? Are we retiring?”
“I’m going to fix this. I made a promise to keep Steve and the baby safe. So far I think I’ve done a pretty good job.”
“Yeah. I got him calm enough,” Natasha says and her eyes flicker in Tony’s direction. “Let’s see how long that lasts.”
“Your brain. All I knew about you was how intelligent you are. They thought if they combined your intelligence and my strength, then they could create their next leader,” Steve says. He glances down at his belly and rubs the spot tenderly. “I don’t know if this is the one, but they want this baby. And I can’t let them take another.”
“Not really but-”
“So…” Tony tries again to make conversation. He kicks himself for not knowing what word should come next. It shouldn’t be this hard to talk to someone. Especially if that someone was his own son. Maybe that’s why Tony was so tongue-tied. It hadn’t fully sunk in yet.
Tony turns in his seat so that he can see Steve properly. Lately the omega had taken a liking to hanging around the lab whenever Tony was working. Tony wonders if it’s because they’ve recently created a bond and Steve needed to be close by, or if he generally liked spending time with him. Maybe it was a bit of both.
“I did give you space.”
“Doodling?” Comes Sam’s voice and Steve peers up when his friend approaches. “You must be nervous.”
Peter doesn’t head toward Stark Tower right away. He visits his papa like he always does, this time leaving a little sketch he did during AP History. His drawing skills could never compare to the ones his papa possessed, but he figures his papa would’ve loved it anyway. He would probably smile and hug Peter as he thanked him. It was what he always did whenever Peter made him a picture.
“I don’t know a lot about grandpa Howard. Papa only told me stories from when he knew him.”
“He’s having second thoughts about the costume you made for him, sir,” Jarvis answers.
He swings out of the entrance, flying through the air for a moment before falling to the ground and rolling onto his side. Peter grunts and rolls himself onto his back, eyes shut and chest rising and falling rapidly. His eyes still sting but his lungs are grateful for the fresh air.
Pepper nods again. “Okay. Wow. I never thought…”
“You know what, forget it. I don’t need you. I’ll do this myself!”
“I didn’t know Tony Stark liked parenthood.”
Peter frowns at the defensive tone his dad suddenly has. He didn’t understand how they went from laughing and talking about movies to this. He didn’t know much about his dad, but he did know one thing. Tony hated being uncomfortable. Only this time he wasn’t making awkward jokes to hide it. He was getting upset.
“You can wait. What is with all of you wanting to eat raw pancakes?” Steve huffs.
“I mean I’m curious,” Bucky says, earning a disapproving look from both his husband and Natasha.
It wasn’t the only unusual thing he’s experienced. The past few months have been odd. He found himself fatigued more often, and on a few occasions he’d feel sick to his stomach. Those symptoms were worrisome, but he had pushed those aside too. He blamed the stress from the breakup and the amount of work he’s been having to do with his teammates.
I swear I didn't forget about this story! I've just been busy with work and other parts of my life. And I've also had more inspiration for my other works lately. But I will find some balance! I hope everyone is doing well!
“Uh. A little bit. I remember how boring it was. Would’ve been a lot better if you were there,” Tony says, a small smile forming over his lips. Pepper smiles back. “Maybe next time.”
“Fine,” Tony says. Both Steve and Peter relax, but Tony isn't finished. “So, Flash-”
“Until he goes to college.”
It’s not long before he’s drifting off to sleep.
“Spread your legs,” Tony instructs and Steve complies, his legs falling open and displaying his most intimate area. Tony’s eyes are immediately drawn to the tight, pink hole. His cock begs to fill it up. “You’re so fucking sexy. Fuck look at you.”
“Good.” Clint squeezes Peter’s shoulder affectionately.
Tony smiles again, this time brighter than before. He pulls Steve close and presses his lips against Steve’s.
Steve makes sure the bag for the hospital is packed before Happy arrives. He had spent the past few weeks getting it together in case his daughter decided to come early, and now he was thankful he had been prepared. She wasn’t waiting for anyone, especially her own father.
“Can I go now?” Steve lifts his head to peer down at her.
Before Steve can even reply to the question, Natasha is joining. “I mean if he chooses not to, at least you still have us.”
“True.” Steve smiles and caresses his small belly fondly.
Steve rises to his feet. He must not be moving fast enough because the next thing he knows the alpha is growing angry and moving toward him. The first hit with the baton had Steve gritting his teeth and tears springing to his eyes.
Bucky stares straight ahead, his jaw clenching and metal hand rolling into a fist. Alpine meows, sensing the change in his attitude and jumps off the couch to rub herself against his legs. Bucky instantly relaxes.
It wasn’t fair that it would now just be a dream.
“Sorry,” Steve decides it’s best to apologize for the awkward silence and uncomfortableness he’s put the alpha through.
“Hey, man, don’t worry,” Peter waves him off.
“About time,” Steve jokes.
Tony loved waking up to Steve each day. He loved how tousled his hair got; he loved how thick and deep his voice was first thing in the morning. In Tony’s opinion, this was when Steve looked his best.
“Thanks,” Tony mutters and accepts the tissue. He wipes along his mouth. “Gross,” he grimaces at the soiled tissue before tossing in the toilet.
Peter nods his head frantically. “I totally understand that, Mr. Stark. I’m still trying to figure this out too. It’s weird and confusing and...I don’t know. I’m excited though. I mean you’re you and it’s so cool that you’re my dad!”
But then the loud wail reaches his ears and he finds the strength to lift his head. A smile forms on his face at the sight of his son. Harley is gently placed on his chest, covered in blood and other fluids, but he’s absolutely perfect.
Steve hums around the finger in his mouth and pulls off with a wet pop. “Come on,” Steve urges, thrusting his hips and rubbing himself against Tony’s hardening cock. Tony groans in response and ducks his head down, burying his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and inhaling the familiar scent.
“And you think he’s here?”
Tony sighs sadly. “I know.”
“We were older! We were-”
“And if it doesn’t-”
The pain is at its worst. It’s coming every few minutes, forcing cries of pain and obscenities to spew from his lips. The epidural should be doing its job and yet Tony could feel every damn contraction that hits. They must’ve stopped giving him the medication. He doesn’t even need to watch the little waves on the monitor anymore to know when one’s coming; his stomach tightens, the muscles hardening like a rock. The pain brings tears to his eyes. He just wants it to end.
from the 70's. Geez. Thanks for making me feel old.”
“So good. You feel so good.”
He can’t imagine losing anyone else close to him. He had already lost the most important person in his life, and now it seemed like it was going to happen again. His family meant the world to him. They had always been there for him. He couldn’t lose his uncle. The whole team would suffer without him, and Peter would crumble for sure.
“Papa!” Peter cries and wraps his arms around his father’s neck, emitting a hiss from Steve and forcing Peter to let go. “Papa, you’re hurt.”
Peter frowns at those words. “Is it bad? Are you going on another mission?” He gasps suddenly. “Can I come, too! I want to fight bad guys!”
The begging is pathetic, but it’s all he has right now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh my God. Please tell me there’s not another one…”
Tony falls silent. He wishes he could say something relatable, but he grew up with everything. Well, except for the attention. His mother made sure to tell him she loved him. It was his father who couldn’t form those words.
“You want to drug his baby?” Bucky asks with a frown.
“Okay.” Steve nods, then he disappears to his bedroom.
“Shh, sweetheart, it’s okay. If you want to keep it then I’ll raise it like my own. And if you want to go another route then I’m fine with that too. The choice is yours. You can make your own choices now.”
“T-Tony,” Steve whimpers and bites down on his bottom lip to stifle a moan. Tony continues to suck, enjoying the whines and whimpers Steve makes below him. He brings one hand up to play with the other nipple, rolling the sensitive bud between his fingers.
“You’re a horrible liar.” Tony scoots forward in the chair and reaches out to brush back the blond strands of hair that have fallen in Steve’s face. He smiles at him. “Go to sleep. I’ll be awake in case anything changes.”
Tony doesn’t blame the AI for ignoring him. It had been JARVIS who tried to convince Tony to stop drinking and find another way to cope. But Tony had ignored him, deciding he knew best. He needed a drink.
But being a parent had its rewarding moments. Steve never missed any milestones. He was there for Peter’s first words, his first steps, his first tooth; Steve vowed never to miss anything. He wanted to be there for his son, just like his mother had been there for him.
He considered the alpha more than just his counselor. Sam was a good friend. Perhaps even Steve’s best friend. It’s been so long since he’s had one.
“Actually...I’m not good.”
“Kind of find that hard to believe. And plus the world has the Avengers. That’s good enough.”
“Of course. I’m never leaving or hurting you again. I promise.”
“I know, but he never would have had to stay there if I just...I’m a horrible father, Tony. Maybe because I didn’t have one I don’t know how to be one.”
“How about just dad?”
“I’m fine!” Peter doesn’t mean to snap. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. “I’m sorry, Aunt Nat, but...I can’t be locked up here anymore. All I think about is him and-”
They decide to talk in his office. It was more secure and further away from the offices on the lower level. The last thing Tony wanted was for anyone to eavesdrop.
Peter follows through and ducks his head down to give his brother a big kiss on the head.
“Good. He’s with Pete now. We’re trying to get ready for this move on top of dealing with a newborn so it’s been crazy. He’s good, though.” Tony can’t help but smile at the thought of his mate. Steve was probably more than good, but Tony didn’t want to take up anymore of Pepper’s time.
“Maguna!” Harley points at his sister.
Peter is changed and ready to be fed, only this time he refuses to eat. Steve grows confused when his son decides he’s not hungry. All night that had been the reason why he was pulling Steve out of bed.
“I know. I’m so afraid, Tony. I want to be here with you and our daughter but-”
The way Steve smiles and giggles from the dog’s affection almost makes Tony change his mind. He’s never seen his boyfriend so happy…well, happy like the way he was now. And Steve’s happiness was always going to come before his own.
“Okay,” Tony frowns and leans against the counter, folding his arms over his chest. “So does this mean he’s…”
“I hope so.”
“I guess it’s done a lot of altercations, huh? But I bet getting drunk isn’t one of the worst things,” Tony says and digs into his own food.
Steve shifts uncomfortably in his seat when a sharp pain runs along his lower back. He winces from the discomfort, pinning the blame on the chairs or the fact that he’s been sitting too long. Before pregnancy he was able to sit through hours of meetings without any issues. But now his body wasn’t the same, and he ached in places he never used to.
“It’s not a helmet,” Peter corrects and he continues to color. “ We’re at Disney World.”
“We’ll discuss it later. This isn’t the time or place. Steve wouldn’t want this.”
“That’s not going to happen,” Sam assures. Bucky doesn’t appear convinced.
For the most part he’s able to keep quiet. Natasha is the first to track him down and fish for information. She finds him in the gym-a place he usually goes to think and be alone- and he’s forced to stop punching his third bag to greet her. She isn’t dressed in anything indicating that she wants to train, leaving him to assume that she just wants him to talk.
“Oh no.” Peter winces and giggles. “What happened? Did he hate it?”
“I know. He said he’d be here in ten minutes.”
He doesn’t register the tears at first. It’s not until the image of Steve and Peter blur does he realize the tears have clouded his vision. Tony sniffs and quickly wipes at them, clearing up the scene. But more tears take their place and Tony has to shut his eyes to keep them from spilling.
Pepper sighs sadly and wraps her arms around him. Tony turns and clings to her tightly, sobbing quietly.
Tony huffs. “Fine. I’ll have Pep get me some.”
It’s tempting to return back to his apartment and spend the rest of the day locked in there, but being away from his friends is the last thing he needs. There were still times when Peter would grow fussy and refuse to calm down despite Steve’s best efforts. It was getting better, but it wasn’t just his upset baby that Steve was worried about.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Here’s your tea,” he says, offering the beverage to the omega.
“Steve,” Tony eventually finds his voice. “They have him...I saw…Pete…”
He’s the one forced to end their embrace when he picks up on soft whimpers coming from the vehicle. He turns his head toward the sound, a soft whine escaping him as the need to be near his pups grows stronger. Pepper senses this immediately and lets him go, watching with curious eyes as he helps a little boy out from the backseat.
They hold each other for a few moments before Natasha pulls away first and wipes her eyes. “We better get out there before the pizza’s gone.”
“Traitor,” Tony tells Dodger, then he turns to his boyfriend with a frown. “Thanks a lot, Cap. We were bonding.”
He opens it with shaky hands, his breath hitching at the sketch he finds. It’s of his suit...the one they were supposed to design together. Peter releases a small sob and carefully runs a finger over the black spider in the center of the suit.
He can’t help but picture the three pups running around the penthouse along with Peter. He frowns at the image his brain conjures up. His space was big but not big enough to hold him and Steve and four pups. Plus they were kids and kids needed space to run and play.
“No more missions. Iron Man will have to take a break for a while.”
Peter understands these meetings are important to his papa and he sits quietly, not making a single sound when the meeting starts. Steve always comes prepared in case he needs to bring his son, and he’s brought Peter’s coloring book and crayons. The little boy works quietly in his book while the grownups talk about bad guys and other superhero stuff.
“Hey, hey,” Tony soothes and sits down on the bed. The omega tries to move away. “Steve, I’m not going to do that. I’d never do that. But listen to me, I need you to tell me who he is.”
“And don’t think I don’t know where you live, kid. If you try anything funny I’ll find you. Got it?”
“There’s no more bread. Shall I add it to the list?”
“My birthdays were…” Tony pauses for a moment to plan out his next words. He doesn’t want to mention the tower of presents, the large cake, the decorations, and the massive group of people that attended the occasion. It would come off as bragging, something Tony wouldn’t intend but it would sound that way. He decides to be honest about them. “They were...depressing.”
“I’m just wondering. I hadn’t heard from you and I thought maybe I screwed up somehow and drove you away. I tend to do that.”
“I don’t know. I don’t know his name. Please, Tony don’t make me go. Please!”
Peter watches as he leaves, a sad sigh escaping him. He wishes his dad would’ve stayed. Maybe they could’ve talked to his papa together.
“He’s a computer,” Tony cuts in, “you know like...like…” Tony trails off and turns around in his seat and gestures toward his array of monitors. “Like this. Only he likes to talk back.”
Steve doesn’t offer the baby in his arms. It feels selfish to not want to allow his friends to hold his son, but they’d understand why he’d be so hesitant. Harley was never supposed to have happened, and by some miracle he was here and sleeping peacefully in Steve’s arms. Steve never wanted to let him go.
Steve chuckles softly. “You’re probably right. Hey, Tony? Do you think Dodger will be okay?”
“But it’s just-”
“Because...I don’t know. Just curious,” Peter mumbles.
“Right.”
His team is already waiting for him by the time Steve gets down to the jet, ready for their latest assignment. The briefing had been quick since the mission was unexpected, but there was plenty of time for them to discuss a plan on the flight.
“Steve,” Tony moans softly, rubbing himself a little harder. He’s losing control. Steve did something to him that no other omega has ever done before. Steve was intoxicating, stronger than any alcohol Tony has ever consumed.
“Tony, that’s not true. You’re not him.”
“Nat, we don’t have time-” Clint tries to argue but falls silent once he realizes he’s being ignored.
A shaky breath escapes him. He can’t cry now, but the tears gather in his eyes anyway.
Tony was terrified. He tried to make more lame jokes to lighten the situation, claiming it was to distract Steve from the pain, but in reality it was just his way of coping. In just a few hours they would be welcoming their son and Tony would officially be a father. He had months to prepare for this moment and now that it had arrived, he felt like any preparation he had was stolen.
He rolls over onto his side, finding Steve already drifting off to sleep. “You want me to stay the night?” Tony asks.
He looks like...well, Peter doesn’t want to say shit but it’s all he can think of. It’s rude, but the truth.
He holds onto hope that one day he’ll glance in the mirror and be happy with what he finds. It was going to take time and a lot of care before then. And he was grateful he had his mate and children by his side.
“Because I said so!” Tony’s voice raises. He turns toward his son, finding him staring wide-eyed at him. “Fuck. I’m sorry.”
Steve huffs and wipes the mess on his sweatpants. “So...Spider-Man, huh?”
“I’ve grown quite fond of your mate. And he had asked me politely to refer to him by his first name.”
It’s not too late when they get home, but Tony still can’t help but feel bad for keeping Peter out on a school night.
“Yeah yeah.” Tony waves his hand dismissively. Another question enters his mind, but he’s unsure if he should ask it. Talking about Steve was too sensitive for the both of them.
“You know her?” Steve glances at Tony in confusion.
“I thought it was about Peter.” Tony sits down at the table with a huff.
“Dad!”
This time Tony turns himself to properly look at Steve. He doesn’t spot any obvious signs of his depression, but he still can’t help but feel hesitant to leave him. He can’t shake the feeling. He reminds himself that Steve was making significant improvement. The support group was helping him cope with the pent up feelings and the pills...well, they needed to be upped a dose.
Steve hated his new attitude toward Tony. It was like they both had gone backwards instead of forwards, treating each other like they did before taking their relationship to the next level. That relationship was over now and it was becoming clear that nothing was going to be the same between them again.
Ned sighs, obviously not agreeing with Peter’s decision, but he doesn’t judge him for it. Ned was a loyal friend.
“I guess,” Tony huffs and he comes over to investigate the piece of furniture. “Didn’t we just order a crib at the other store? Why does he need two beds?”
You guys! This is the last chapter! I'm sad to see it end but I look forward to the new fics I'm working on and future stony stuff (I have a lot of ideas). These two get their happy ending with their beautiful son and I'm so happy for them! They came a long way.
The growl Steve emits in response quickly becomes something he regrets. The baton digs deeper into his lower back.
Yay Steve has both his babies! Now the team needs to me them 😊
He refuses to eat and drink. All he does is lock himself in the bedroom and sob until he’s too exhausted to do anything else. Tony hates it. He hates it more because he knows he’s responsible for Steve’s pain.
“Are you sure about this? I know how much you wanted to follow in Steve’s footsteps.”
Steve can’t tear his eyes away from his son’s sleeping face. Peter had only opened his eyes once, giving Steve a glimpse of them before shutting them again. Steve had seen enough; he had Tony’s eyes. Another Stark trait was the dark hair on his head.
“I could schedule an interview,” Pepper suggests and Tony takes a moment to think it over. “It will be more controlled and Steve won’t have to worry about a crowd full of people throwing questions at him.”
The voice gets louder and louder, repeating those two words until it’s all Steve can hear. Morgan is still looking up at him, but it’s not enough. He needs Tony.
“We need to talk,” Peter says.
“Again!” Steve cries, wiggling impatiently in his older cousin’s arms.
“Let him go!” Tony seethes, his tone dripping with venom. He struggles to break free, but the restraints hold true and prevent him from getting to his mate.
Steve clicks his tongue in disapproval and Tony winces.
But with the urge to end the life of their unborn child only growing stronger each day, Tony knows he’ll have to hurt Steve. It was going to be painful to see his husband so distraught over the loss, but it had to be done. It would save them both pain in the long run.
“And then Ned was telling me about his new Star Wars Lego Death Star and I was like ‘that sounds awesome!’ and then he said we could do it this weekend, after homework and stuff.”
“So...Peter huh?” Natasha decides to change the subject.
“Can I see him?”
Tony lays his head over Steve’s chest. “I love you, too.”
Tony doesn’t hear from his son or his best friend. He was sure after a few days that at least one of them would have called him back. He could have easily reached out to them first, and for one person he did, but still there had been no response. Maybe this was karma’s way of getting him back. He did blow Steve off after multiple phone calls, texts, voicemails, and letters were sent. Maybe Tony was getting punished now.
“Oh we’re not,” Tony interrupts and he turns back to Steve. “It’s a boy.”
Tony huffs and runs a hand through his damp hair. He hated himself for what he had done. Hurting Steve wasn’t going to solve the problem and make it all go away. He loved Steve. He could never hurt him like the way he just did.
Steve is silent for a moment.
“Kiddo, I missed a lot of birthdays. There’s no way in hell I’m missing this one. Or any others.”
“Steve was different. He also didn’t stink or tear up the sofa.”
Tony growls and crawls toward his mate. “Waiting is difficult for me. Especially when I have such a sexy omega in my bed.”
The team is ready and beginning to load the jet. Tony lingers behind, that sense of hesitation clouding his decision to leave. FRIDAY has already alerted Tony that his teammates were waiting for him.
. I hated...I hated the pup we made. That’s so wrong, isn’t it? The baby was innocent and I-I hated it. I didn’t want it. It was from him. I wanted nothing to do with him.”
“Then pay attention. If you want to go out there and fight then your guard always has to be-” Steve is cut off when something sticky wraps around his legs and he’s yanked down to the mat. He lands on his back with an ‘oof’.
Poor Steve still has a lot of issues to work through. The next chapter will focus on the therapy, and him healing. Maybe some smut? Tony will make it romantic of course 😉
Jarvis chooses to go silent, probably ignoring him. It’s fine. Tony needed to be ignored right now.
“I love you, too.”
“Eh.”
Peter pulls away, whimpering softly for a moment before calming down. Steve adjusts him into an upright position, carefully following the instructions he had been given to burp his son. The nurse is nearby if he needs help, but he wants to do this on his own. Eventually, it’s going to be just him.
“Yeah I heard. Guess we have our new Cap.”
Steve only nods.
“It’ll be okay. This is good for me. This is what I need.”
He’s currently sitting behind his desk, drumming his fingers against the polished surface as he contemplates his next move. Obviously Pepper needed to be in on his secret. It wasn’t like he could keep it from her. Not that he could even if he wanted to. She always knew how to expose his lies.
Clint promised to teach their son how to shoot and to not be surprised if they got a bow and arrow for the baby shower. Bruce was happy, more so that both the baby and Tony were doing fine.
“Great. Now you pissed him off,” Tony huffs.
“I...I want to apologize for what I said. I didn’t mean to make things uncomfortable.”
“Okay, okay. Relax. My intentions were not meant to steal that away from you. I know that’s your time to bond. I just wanted to help.”
Steve sags in his seat. God did he wish it worked like that. He’d give anything to be cured right on the spot. His pups and his mate needed him.
Peter chuckles and stands so that he can walk Flash out. “You won’t,” he assures.
Tony shrugs. “I’m down. But if you want to continue as the heroic Captain then go for it. I can be a stay at home dad.”
Morgan decides to check on him. She uses her math homework as an excuse. She knew the material and didn’t require any assistance, but she figured it would be a good reason to get his attention.
“Well it has been 15 years.”
“Really? I don’t want to invade-”
“I love you.”
He smiles softly. “I love you, too.”
“I bet. Then maybe you get your butt down to the training room and I let you win.”
“I’m sorry. I don’t want to promise I won’t do it again because I don’t know. Tony, I’m a mess. I don’t know if I can-”
Morgan smiles again and her little legs kick out happily. Tony peers up at Steve and they share a look, then all attention falls on their daughter again. She keeps her eyes locked on the familiar face of her father for a moment, then she begins to rock from side to side until she’s rolling over onto her back.
“See?” Peter’s eyes are full of a tears, a few escaping and rolling down his face. “He did ask for you and you did nothing.”
“Thank you again,” Steve tells her. “It means a lot.”
Peter Benjamin. That was the name they finally decided on. It was a struggle to meet in the middle-even more so with Tony’s mood swings- but they managed to come together and pick out a name for their son. But it wasn’t just a name that they were struggling with.
But he hesitates. His papa would drop everything and rush over, but then he’d also smother and Peter did not want to be smothered. His papa would try every home remedy in the book until giving in and driving Peter’s ass to the nearest emergency room. And that could not happen. Peter’s secret would be revealed and that was the last thing he needed.
He even sounds beautiful.
They never really fought, at least not in front of them. If they did, Morgan never really knew about it. They must have forgotten to keep their voices down this time.
“Me, either.”
Steve chuckles and curls up against Tony, his eyes falling shut. It’s not long before he’s drifting off to sleep again.
“Something new?” Steve questions, his face heating up and pants growing tight. He runs a finger over one of the cuffs, imagining them wrapped around his wrists. He frowns suddenly. He could easily break these and their fun would be over.
“Yeah,” Steve replies, doing his best to keep the pain out of his tone. The tightening in his middle starts to fade, relieving him from the intense pressure. “Yeah, I’m good.”
By the time dinner is ready, the rest of the family shows up. Steve isn’t thrilled with their tardiness and he orders them to clean up before calling them to eat.
“I’m pregnant.”
There’s a moment of silence and then…
“You’re famous,” Nick says, his tone casual. It only makes the omega even more confused.
“I already told you,” Tony says. “I just had a little too much to drink. Happens all the time.”
“Why? I can take him.”
“Because he was having a baby with someone else and I lost it! What else was I supposed to say!”
“Dammit,” Steve curses to himself. He could wait until Tony was home, but he wouldn’t be able to conceal his excitement for that long. “Jarvis, can you call Tony? I have good news for him.”
“Having a baby and living together doesn’t mean marriage. We’re fine where we’re at.”
“I mean you must, right? Why else would you two-”
“Can I help?” Peter asks, moving his chair closer so he can get a better look.
“I won’t,” Tony assures.
Thank you for reading! 😊
But when he’s greeted with nothing, his heart shatters and a choked sob escapes him. Tony’s taking his hand, the gentle squeeze a reminder that he was still there, that he was always going to be.
He doesn’t speak anymore after that. It was still too difficult to talk so openly about his experiences. But it was also his first day. Maybe next week he’d feel more comfortable.
“It’s just for a while. We can still talk and visit.”
“No,” Peter sighs sadly and slants back in his seat. “I want to be an Avenger one day. He was training me so I could take his place but...we never finished. We were supposed to make a really cool suit too.”
“He is. We’re going to bring him home soon.”
Building a nursery was a big one. The spare room in their apartment was currently being remodeled into Peter’s room. The walls have been painted a light gray and new carpet was put in. But that was the only progress they’ve made. A theme for the room hadn’t been decided on yet.
“Sorry. I’m not used to him having one. I know we all have a name but him...I wasn't allowed to use it. I wasn’t allowed to do anything.”
“I’m here, hon.”
“Let me make a phone call. Meet me in the briefing room in ten minutes.”
Steve inhales sharply. “His appointment. I told you this last week.”
“I guess Steve was strict huh?” Tony immediately regrets those words too but it’s too late to take them back.
“I am.”
“Keep it down,” Tony hisses and his voice drops lower. “I’m working on it okay? I didn’t know how to tell him.”
The first thing he notices is how small the pup is. It’s not until he properly inspects the newborn does he realize it’s a girl. An omega girl.
Happy pulls up to the front of the cool and turns in his seat to wish Peter a good day and to once again to remind him of the weirdos he would gladly take care of if they as much looked at Peter funny.
Steve smiles and leans closer to press a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips. James gags and hides his face away.
But then Bruce is leading him to another room and that’s when Peter starts to panic. He knows what’s about to happen next and he can’t help but start to feel uneasy. All he wants to do is go home and pretend that none of this was real.
“I know.” Peter nods. “He’s just…I don’t know. He seemed fine at the ceremony and now…what if he’s freaking out because we’re all here? But I guess that wouldn’t make sense because he’s been with us for every holiday and birthday and-”
Tony chuckles and leans closer until he’s close enough to rest his head over the bump. His eyes fall shut and he rubs his hand in small circles. “Hey, Pete. You better be good for, mama.”
“If it was too much I wouldn’t have put that ring on your finger. I told you I love those kids and nothing is ever going to change that. I am a little tired, sure but…it’s worth it.”
But it wasn’t meant to be, and at least Tony was willing to do it all. Steve loved him even more because of it.
It’s not until Steve is returning a few minutes later with the diaper bag and stroller does Tony hesitate letting Steve go alone. He’s ready to tag along, only to stop himself. He didn’t want to ruin their bonding time. And he trusted Steve. Everything was going to be fine.
But again, Steve was different. He had the damn serum. No doubt that was the issue. That’s what Tony decides to pin the blame on.
Just the thought of him has Peter choking out a sob. He buries his face into his hands and sobs into them. His legs threaten to give out and he has to grip the railing to keep himself from sliding down to the floor.
Steve sniffs and peers up at Tony with glistening eyes. “W-who?”
Another gunshot rings out and this time Steve gasps, pain erupting in his side. He glances down to investigate, finding a bloody spot spreading across his dirtied shirt. He slumps off the alpha and holds his side, his teeth gritted tight.
“I was ready to go after you but she insisted she do it. Are you okay now?”
“Oh I will. And the next time we run I’ll aim for your legs.”
“Okay. And if it turns out that it’s not your pup, then what?”
It wasn’t just Peter that was struggling. Tony couldn’t figure out what his next costume should be. He didn’t want a repeat of previous years and he definitely wasn't taking Steve’s suggestion and using his Iron Man suit. He needed something good. Something different.
Peter glances up to stare at the statue of his father, knowing that he would be proud.
Keeping a secret as big as this one for years wasn’t difficult. Nick was used to hiding information. But occasionally he would get the urge to let at least one person in on his project.
“It’s temporary. Maybe one day we’ll reconnect.”
Peter chuckles. “Red. Sorry.”
“Best invention yet?”
It only takes a few more pushes for Peter to slide out to his shoulders. Another contraction builds and Tony leans forward, screaming and squeezing Steve’s hand while he pushes one last time. One glance between his legs shows the doctor’s smiling face and the screaming baby boy in her arms.
“You two met recently. After you and I spoke about making a contribution to my organization, you bumped into him. You two only spoke for a few minutes, but he seemed to take a liking to you.”
“You’re gonna pay for that,” he threatens.
Natasha rolls her eyes playfully but says nothing.
Sensing his mate’s urgency, Steve reaches between them to take the alpha’s cock into his hands, stroking the hard flesh and emitting another moan from the man above him. “Does it feel good?” Steve asks, a little unsurely.
“My fault,” Tony says and earns a glare from both his mate and friend.
“You should have read the letters,” Bucky says. “Or answered every fucking call. He tried to tell you, but you didn’t listen because all you care about is yourself.”
“Hold on,” Tony says quickly before crossing the room to get the nursing pillow. He helps get Peter in a comfortable position and soon the room fills with the sound of his suckling.
When Steve’s birthday rolls around, a heavy sorrow lingers over the team. His special day had never been shadowed with such a deep sadness before. The team never failed to bring happiness and joy to Steve on this day. Every year he had done the same for each of them. The team’s happiness and well-being always came before anything else. Steve put aside his own feelings just so that his family could be content.
His response is relieving, both to the alpha and omega. The pup was healthy.
Ned’s eyes light up for a moment, then he’s frowning. “Wait, you don’t want it?”
He was going to need Steve now more than ever. He didn’t have the first clue about taking care of a baby.
“Really? It’s been that long?”
“I...I can’t have anymore. Not now. Not when I don’t feel comfortable. Tony, I’m sorry.”
Steve quietly steps out of the room, following after his son. Peter immediately tries to run into his room to get toys, but Steve stops him.
“I really want you too but…”
“Hmm? What’s wrong?” Tony mumbles. His eyes remain closed and Morgan knows he’ll fall back to sleep soon.
“I know.” Tony soothingly runs a hand along Steve’s back. “You’re doing so good, honey. Just breathe through it.”
The nightmares never stop.
“Blame the kid. Now hurry up.”
“You won’t. He’s not the type one forgets so easily. Trust me I know.”
Natasha chuckles. “I’ll give you another chance. And I guess I’ll go easy on you.”
Steve inhales sharply. “I just don’t understand why now. You had no problem with this job in the past.”
That inner voice wiggles it’s way back in, reminding Tony of the feelings he still has for Steve. They have grown closer since the birth of their son and have managed to put aside their feelings about the breakup to team up and care for their son. But now they were back to the way things used to be.
“I’m not! Oh God!” Steve groans, blindly reaching for Tony’s hand and when he finds it, he squeezes it hard. “Tony, please!”
The rest of the exam passes fairly quickly. Steve was in good health and his pregnancy was progressing as it should be. Bruce doesn’t spend much time, but does remind the omega to reach out to him if something were to change.
Tony chokes back another sob. “Tell them to hurry! Please!” He orders.
“You can go back to bed,” Steve says when Tony refuses to leave their daughter’s side.
Tony takes Steve up the stairs and toward the large master bedroom. He could easily offer one of the other rooms his penthouse has, but he wants Steve comfortable.
Tony is curious to know what else Steve has gone through the past few years, but he holds back. They had so much that still needed to be said and unpacked. But it was going to take time. They still didn’t really know or trust each other.
Peter blows out a deep breath and pushes forward, determined to find Flash and get it over with. It was like ripping off a bandaid. Or at least that’s what Peter wishes for it to be like. Ripping a bandaid off would probably be easier and less humiliating.
“It’s a boy. Just accept the fact that you’re  wrong.”
“What does that mean?” Pepper asks. “Do you think he did this?”
“No this one is...anyway, yeah it could be mine and I have to help him out. We didn’t exactly bond or anything-”
Steve shrugs Tony off. “If this is all because you feel guilty, then I don’t want it. I don’t want your clothes or your muffins.” Steve slams the muffin into Tony’s chest, creating a mess on the floor.
The details of his death were vague; all Tony knows is he was KIA. Steve fought hard to protect his country and the world. He died doing the thing he loved.
“Tony?”
Steve huffs out a laugh and a small grin forms over his face. “If the circumstances were different…”
“Would you prefer Baby Stark?”
“Because all you care about is yourself!” Peter yells, then he points at the statue. “And all he cared about was being Captain America. You’re both selfish! You don’t care about me.”
He plays along and paints the room and even goes baby shopping with Steve and Natasha. They’re not sure what the gender is yet. Steve’s already admitted that he didn’t care as long as their baby was healthy. That’s all that mattered.
Natasha frowns. “Is he okay?”
Steve lets out another sob. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to do this.”
“I can give you one. Just tell me. You’re not supposed to take all of this on by yourself.”
“So much for riding alone,” he murmurs.
and whatever else the kid liked to talk about, but Peter remained silent, refusing to mutter a single word.
Peter smiles. “I hope so. Everyone’s here.”
Steve decides at that moment that dinner was ready. The last thing he wanted was for his son to get upset. Peter had seemed better today and he didn’t want that streak to end so quickly.
“That doesn’t sound reassuring.”
“Right. I guess that makes sense. He’s been a little-”
Tony has no choice but to give in. “Okay,” he says with a fake smile. Steve smiles back. “Let’s have a baby.”
“Oh!” It finally dawns on Tony. “You want to be me me, not Iron Man. Why? You don’t want a really cool suit?”
Steve nods and a frown appears over his face. “Why so early?”
“But you feed her…”
“Happy?” Steve asks, hopeful.
“Hurt me? Jarvis, what do you mean? Tony wouldn’t do that. He loves me.”
“Oh yeah? What is it?”
Alexander nods and mirrors him. “I hope I do, too. He’s very important to me. I just want him and our baby home safely.”
He can’t help but reach out anyway, gently running his fingers over Steve’s belly. The muscles ripple under his fingertips. He wonders what it would be like if their roles were switched, if it was him carrying the baby instead. Maybe Steve wouldn’t have been so careless.
Tony shakes his head and plops back down in his chair. “No...no...that’s not...Pep, he…”
“I know you want to laugh,” Steve says when he catches the grin on his husband’s face. He sighs again. “Go ahead. Just get it out.”
“I mean it,” Steve says. “I know what you’re going through. I dealt with the exact same thing.”
“Hey, hey,” Tony makes sure his tone is calm. “Kid, I don’t know why you’re getting upset. If it’s because of me-”
Tony rolls his eyes and steps away, inching closer to Steve. He keeps a safe distance, not wanting to crowd around the omega and scare him off. He wonders if he already has when he suggested Steve stay with him.
“Am I making a mistake?” Steve asks. “Can I really do this?”
“Sorry,” Peter apologizes when he picks up on the defensive tone. “I didn’t mean to make you mad.”
“Just get home. Peter is-Harley, no! Don’t put that in the toilet!”
“You’re doing good. Just keep pushing. Almost there.”
“Steve, we-you can’t keep him.” Tony stares the dog down, nose wrinkling in disgust when the dog scratches at its ear. Great, the dirty mutt had fleas.
Harley had been unexpected, or at least he had been to her. She didn’t even know her parents had wanted anymore children. But once she came around to the idea of another sibling, she started to like it and imagined having a little sister. There were too many boys in their household. Auntie Nat would agree.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not always. You’re here, right?” Tony stands and pats the bodyguard on the shoulder. “Make sure we get there in one piece.”
“Yeah,” Ned nods and a smile appears over his face. It seems forced. “See you for lunch?”
“No.” Steve shakes his head. “This is fine. I’m just gonna…”
“Good. He’s kicking right now if you want to…” Steve trails off. Pepper smiles again and comes over, reaching out to place her hand over his belly. Steve takes her hand and leads it to the spot where Peter was currently moving.
Steve sets the bear down in exchange for the box, ripping the paper off and removing the lid to reveal the item inside. He wasn’t exactly sure what he was expecting, but red, metal handcuffs were not one of them.
“I got you, sweetheart,” Tony promises and he connects their lips again. He breaks the kiss to remove his own shirt, tossing it somewhere behind him. This time it’s Steve who reaches out to touch and explore the alpha’s exposed chest. “You can touch me all you want. I’m yours.”
They spend the rest of the evening talking about other things, making sure Steve doesn’t get brought up unless it has to do with happy memories. Peter had plenty of those and he’s willing to share all of them.
“Tony!” Steve cries out when his mate’s eyes flutter. “Tony, don’t do this. We can get out. It’s over.”
“Neither do I. But I just know you’ll be good to him.”
The welcome Tony gets doesn’t feel warm, or at least like the ones he used to get from the Avengers. The two people genuinely happy to see him are of course Peter and then Bruce. At least Tony felt safe in knowing if shit were to go down, he’d have the green guy on his side.
“Isn’t he though? Never mind. I just need to keep him here a little longer.”
Tony growls and shoves in, cursing at the incredible heat that surrounds him. The man under him whimpers, head falling back and breaths coming out as heavy pants. Tony takes a moment to adjust to the feeling of having his cock sheathed inside.
“What did I do?”
He doesn’t mention the feelings he may or may not have for Tony. The point of the letter isn’t to confess that he misses Tony or wishes for them to start over and mend what’s broken. All he has to do is confess about the life currently growing in his belly.
“I’ll sleep on it I guess.”
“I know. But you’ll figure it out. You always do.”
Peter’s phone dings, notifying him of a new message. Sam catches a glimpse of the name on the screen and smiles.
Tony glances up when he hears Steve grunt. “You okay?” he asks and Steve nods his head in response. “You’re a terrible liar. What hurts?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’re here.”
Tony smiles softly and brings Steve in for a kiss. The air around them has lost the pungent stench and Steve’s sweetness fills Tony’s nose again. The omega is calmer now, and he buries his face in Tony’s neck, inhaling the scent of his alpha. The soft sound of Steve’s purring makes Tony’s heart flutter.
“I wouldn’t be do anything anyway. But I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
He wonders what his son is doing and if he was even doing okay. His next visit with Bruce wasn’t for a few more weeks and that reminder dampens his mood. It’s not until he remembers someone else’s capabilities.
“Is that a problem?”
“He wasn’t there for the mission,” Natasha reminds.
“What’s going on?” Tony’s voice has the pups quieting down and abandoning their games to rush to him.
“I know.” Steve sighs and steps into the room, shutting the door behind him to give them privacy. He takes a seat beside his son, his eyes immediately landing on the backpack. “Going somewhere?”
“And here I was thinking you just liked me.”
They stumble further into the apartment, only breaking apart to rush up the stairs and toward their bedroom. Steve connects their lips again, fingers wrapping around the front of Tony’s suit and fisting the material.
Bucky releases a sob and grips the edge of the sink harder, his shoulders hunching and head dropping down between them. Sam comes up behind him and wraps both arms around Bucky’s waist, hugging him close.
The room breaks out into a flurry of activity. The baby is passed to one of the nurses and whisked away. Steve’s gaze follows after her, hoping to catch another glimpse of the baby. He doesn’t.
“What do you want?” Peter asks, doing his best to keep his tone calm and any tears or hurt detected.
“I can assume by that goofy smile on your face that it’s good news,” Tony says and Steve looks up at him, finding a similar smile on his own.
It’s meant as a joke, but Steve can’t bring himself to laugh. “Actually…” he pauses, one hand falling to his stomach. The queasiness returns and Steve has to bite back the urge to vomit.
“Yeah, I guess so. I just miss you.” Peter throws his arms around Steve’s neck, hugging him tightly.
“Maybe I should’ve done more-”
The trip back to New York is set after Steve’s birthday and the baby shower. Steve didn’t know it yet, but Tony was planning a celebration. He couldn’t go over the top like he usually loved to do with his parties; it was too risky to draw attention and plus Steve wouldn’t be too thrilled. He was simple.
“You said you weren’t like him, and I believe you. What you did wasn’t you.” Steve steps forward again and Tony takes one back. “Please, Tony. I’m sorry.”
Steve nods. “I do. God I want one so bad. But I can’t...I can’t lose another. I’d never forgive myself for taking another life.”
“I know.” Tony nods and takes his original spot beside his husband. He takes Steve’s hand and with his own, brushes away the tears that don’t stop falling. “But you’re so strong and I, and everyone else, knows that you can get through this. It’s not going to be easy and honestly, this sucks. I hate you being here while Morgan and are forced to pretend that everything’s okay. But you can’t give up. You promised that, remember?”
It’s Tony’s turn to wrap her in a hug. He holds her for a moment before letting go and placing both hands over her shoulders. “I screwed up, and I’m so so sorry. I let work and Pete’s training get in the way. I do want to hear about your day and I do want to help with science projects. I promised myself that I’d be a better father than the one I had and I blew it.”
“Need to...touch you,” is all Steve can say. He pulls a little harder at the cuffs, huffing when they refuse to loosen around him. The frame creaks and he has stop himself from pulling it apart.
