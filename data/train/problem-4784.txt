Tony could see the slightly defeated look on the blond’s face. He tried to school his own reaction, knowing that it wouldn’t help anything if Steve detected a hint of disappointment in his next question. “So you didn’t understand any of it? Not even the videos from last year’s events?”
“Well yeah but…” Steve started, wondering if his next words would be seen as bold or just rude, “I just never thought a guy like you would notice someone like me long enough to want to offer up a room in your home during a blizzard.”
“Not a problem, but please let go before you crush me to death…” Sam choked out. Steve jumped back quickly, shrugging in apology.
It was all over almost as quickly as it began. Once the last few notes of the song sounded, Steve slowly took back his hand and took a step back. “I need some air,” he stammered, before quickly leaving the gym.
“Buh-bye Ony, I love yew,” Cora turned to listen to Steve as he whispered something, and excitedly turned back to blow a the screen a kiss. Steve moved the camera, so that he was all Tony could see.
“Nice to meet you, Tony,” Steve said, smiling as he offered his hand to shake. Tony took it, and couldn’t help but notice how strong the shorter man’s handshake was.
As he sat in his car, Steve closed his eyes and tried making a mental list of every fear he had about his first day on the job, then he tried assessing ways to deal with each fear. After less than a minute, Steve heard a knock at his car window and jumped. His eyes went wide in shock, as he looked out to see a man with floppy brown hair and glasses that covered the bluest eyes he’d ever seen.
“Yeah,” Tony finally answered, smiling up at the blond in front of him, “I’d love to try something new. Same time as usual?”
“Well, I still appreciate that you know how to follow directions. Seems like a lost art these days,” Tony quipped, taking a seat atop of one of the work stations. “So, how are things with1 everyone in the outside world?”
And wasn't that something, Tony thought. Discovering a new kink at his age. In reality, nothing about this should have surprised him; he’d always liked to put his name on his things. Tony just never thought one of those “things” would be Steve Rogers. That was a fact that would probably always shock the hell out of Tony: that Steve was
“Well, this dinner took a rather unexpected turn,” Steve joked, not entirely sure how to progress the conversation.
They were seated almost immediately, and as luck would have it, they were placed in Steve’s section.
“They asked that I not tell you they were waiting for you,” was all Happy said before they continued the rest of their ride in silence.
Steve tried to nod, but felt the resistance as Tony’s hand pulled his hair, just enough to barely hurt. “Yes, fuck Tony, yes!”
“I want you to pay me a monthly allowance and I want you to leave me and my family alone. You do that, and I’ll do whatever you want with the company once it’s mine.”
,” Steve moaned, lifting his free hand to brace it on the blanket above his head. The move gave him the leverage to take Tony deeper. At this angle, Tony realized he was able to hit Steve’s prostate dead on. Though he was close, he knew it wouldn't take long for Steve to come like this as long as he kept up the dirty talk. So Tony did just that.
“You’ve got that stupid look on your face, that ‘something involving Steve is happening right now and I’m giddier than a schoolgirl about it’ face,” Carol pointed out, waving the steak at the end of her fork at Tony and his phone.
Clint narrowed his eyes then let out a huff in defeat. “Fine, whatever, I’m sorry. Jesus fuck, you guys are the worst,” he muttered as he headed towards the fridge.
“Barton…” Fury warned. Clint crossed his arms in a huff and frowned. “What?! I’m just stating a fact. I’m arguably the best P.E. teacher in the entire world, so the man is lucky that I’m taking him under my wing. To guide him on this journey of both knowledge and fitness.” Clint finished on a whisper, clutching his hands to his chest and looking wistful, as if the love of his life just asked for his hand in marriage.
Tony was ready to let Steve have a piece of his mind when a look of recognition came over the blond’s face. He turned to the stage to look at the man singing, before turning back towards Tony. “Is this—” Steve began, not able to finish asking his question.
Steve went the rest of the week without speaking to Tony, in an effort to try to think clearly. More often than not, some part of him would say this was a mistake while the rest of him screamed for him to find the brunet and kiss the life out of him. Steve just couldn’t wrap his mind around any of this, now that it was a reality instead of a far off fantasy. He knew how his friends all felt about it, but there was one last person he needed approval from before making any kind of decision. He decided then that once work ended on Friday, he would make his way to see his mom.
; it looked to be at least half of the entire floor of the apartment building. The amazement Steve felt walking through the hallway paled in comparison to the awe he felt looking at the guest bedroom itself. The space looked to be as big as his one bedroom apartment, with a massive floor to ceiling window. Taking in the view of the city below him, Steve heard a light knock on the bedroom door.
Tony sat on the private jet that his father insisted on sending to get him, thinking. Thinking about how badly he didn't want to go to this symposium, thinking about how badly he would miss his friends while he was gone, and thinking about how badly he currently wanted a drink to take the edge off. Mostly, though, he was thinking about what Steve had said when the alpha told him about this trip.
As stressful as things had been, Steve really was starting to enjoy his new job and friends. He had no idea what the school year would have in store for him, but part of him was looking forward to that challenge.
Tony accepted the sandwich, too distracted by his newly realized hunger to feel embarrassed by the loud rumble emanating from his stomach. He quickly took a bite of the food and let out a moan. “Good god, if I’d known this was all it took to get such deliciousness hand delivered to my classroom, I would have invited you to the workshop and told you all about my bad habits a lot sooner.” Tony smiled to himself at the way Steve looked away and blushed at that.
Steve looked up at his friend to see a sincere smile with kind eyes. He gave a small nod before smiling up at the brunet.
“Yeah I looked over some of the documents you sent over and, honestly, a lot of it just looked like Greek to me. I’m really not familiar with code or engineering terminology enough to know what I’m looking at.”
The blond looked up at the man across from him, who was in the midst of trying desperately to stifle a laugh.
That small unintentional display that let the alpha know he’d gotten under Howard’s skin was enough to tide him over, at least until they got home. Walking around, Tony took in his surroundings and frowned.
“So, even though I’m terrified right now, I understand what you’re saying and why you’re saying it. I’m genuinely glad that Tony has someone like you in his life to protect him.”
“Oh,” Steve said, finally taking a moment to stop and think over the question, “I’m sorry, Tony, I didn’t actually ask for the guy’s name. I was too excited to think about that,” Steve said, clearly a little embarrassed.
“Either you know how much I love wine, or this is an indication of what I’m going to have to sit through,” the blonde said, taking her seat.
The two of them sat in Tony’s workshop like that; joking with each other and genuinely having a good time, when the sound of heels clicking on the concrete floor interrupted them. Tony didn’t even have to look up to know who it was.
This oddly felt like deja vu, with the exception that Tony was actually excited to see Ty this time. “Let him in, J,” Tony said, settling into his office chair.
Tony gave a self satisfied smile before walking over to the group of kids. Once he was out of earshot, Rhodey turned on Steve, narrowing his eyes.
Tony looked down at the smaller man and smiled to himself. He moved slowly to reach for the remote, figuring he could watch a show until the smaller man awake. As an episode of
“Stevie’s new crush?! Who is this and why have I not heard about them?!” Sam asked, losing all interest in the axe he was about to throw, in favor of prying into his friend’s life.
“Thanks,” Tony admitted, bashfully. He leaned forward and kissed Coraline’s name. “And this one is you.”
He knew his mom didn’t want him to break his back working to keep her taken care of, so he quickly continued before she had a chance to argue.
Steve looked at him, slightly suspicious, but ultimately just shrugged it off. “Alright, I’ll walk a little faster, but don’t come crying to me if you’re lovely little legs get tired and aren’t able to keep up.”
"I may or may not have a reputation around here for having legendary anger issues, so most of the personnel knows better than to tell me no when it isn't a life or death matter."
“I’m going to keep asking you ‘why’ until you actually give me an answer!” Bruce replied, equally as done with his friend.
“I...listen,” Tony began, visibly seeing how those two words immediately crushed the omega, “I care so much about you and Mason, you have to know that. But I just...I can’t be your bond mate, Steve.”
As he sat in front of one of his favorite piece from the new Degas exhibit, he heard someone walk up behind him.
The appointment was conducted with very little conversation, outside of the routine questions about how Steve was doing. They were all seemingly excited to get to the biggest part of the day. Once Bruce began the ultrasound, Tony sat in a seat beside the exam table, holding Steve’s hand. The room was absolutely silent, save for the whir of the machines.
“Yeah I uhm...needed to come see you about something,” Steve spoke, stopping to give Sarah a kiss on the cheek on his way to the couch.
"No buts, Nat. First of all I'm pretty sure it's against company policy to party with your supervisors,"
Sam had reached out the night before to apologize again for the way he and Bucky had ganged up on Steve about his crush. After accepting the apology, Steve couldn’t seem to stop himself from gushing about Tony. Sam, bless him, tried to be supportive, but he couldn’t give his well wishes without also giving a word of caution. “Just don’t get too ahead of yourself, man. I don’t want to see you get hurt again,” Sam had said before wishing Steve luck.
“I spent a lot of money on your Christmas present this year,” Tony warned. “I wasn’t going to but then I did.”
“While all of those things are true, I’m not very sure you know just how badly you’ve fucked up here,” Natasha said, moving to show Tony something on her phone.
Peter fussed with Tony, placing him amongst the group just so, smiling once he was satisfied with his work. “Perfect,” he said, turning to look at the camera.
“Yeah, I… yeah,” Tony offered, just as breathless. He had received a call from his dad the night of Coraline’s birthday, demanding that he come home for Spring Break. Though he put up more of a fight this time, Tony still gave in, and promised he’d make it home for the break.
“Thanks for suggesting we come to this park, I had a lot of fun today. I hope you did too,” Tony said, suddenly looking bashful.
Steve was horizontal on the couch, Cora asleep on his chest, his head resting in Tony’s lap. Tony was idly playing with his hair. The boys were dozing, slipping in and out of consciousness. Tony’s pocket vibrated, startling both he and Steve. He fished it out and saw…
The three of them sat there quietly for a moment, trying to make sense of it all, before Nat moved to place a hand on Steve’s arm.
Tony was met with a growl that quickly reminded him who was boss, and sat down in the closest chair without even thinking about it. Coulson was the type of alpha who never really liked to show his gender, so when he tried to show dominance it was for a reason and you knew he wasn’t to be messed with.
“I’m a pretty firm believer in the notion that sometimes we need to acknowledge and celebrate the selfless acts we do. You might not always want to draw attention to all that you’ve been through, but it’s okay to acknowledge that you’ve done something amazing. That you’re
Tony visibly deflated at those words. Howard was an asshole who wanted nothing more than to see Tony miserable. He knew this, he always knew this, and yet every time, he let Howard goad him with his words, and put doubts into his head.
“Guys, look, either he’s coming or he isn’t. Either way, we’re all going to have a great time watching some of our favorite movies, ok?”
Tony stood at a workstation, wearing nothing but jeans, a black tank and goggles as he worked with a soldering iron. At that moment, lyrics sung by Axel Rose began blasting out over the speakers.
That night was the last time Steve had seen Natasha, and without her helping to keep things straight, he’d managed to convince himself that he couldn’t go back to work. Now that he had been promoted, it was unthinkable to possibly be Tony’s manager while walking around with the growing reminder of their time together. The omega drafted up an email, detailing his resignation. No matter how many times he went back to edit each and every single line, it never seemed right. So Steve decided that enough was enough, and settled for what he had in the moment, then sent it off to Coulson.
Walking to his desk, Steve found a hot cup of green tea waiting for him. He smiled, knowing exactly who left it there.
Tony sat in the driver's seat, clutching the steering wheel so hard his knuckles were white. He and Rhodey had been driving back to Midtown High for all of 15 minutes, and Tony couldn't help the antsiness he felt, waiting to get all of the thoughts he had out in the open.
It didn’t take too long for Steve to bring out the whole spread. Being a college kid on a budget, there was really only so much he could make. Regardless, he was still proud of what he had put together. He laid out the chicken and creamy garlic pasta, salad, and warm rolls before pouring some Coke into the nicest cups he had.
“I...no! You know, you can’t just go around throwing all these wild accusations at people! That’s how you end up getting sued.”
“Well, after I told him all that, he said he was fully aware that if he was up to anything, dealing with your wrath would be worse than anything anyone else had to offer. I knew after that that he was an alright guy.”
“‘There’s no place more private here than a car in the parking lot the night of a school dance’. Honestly, that’s been the best advice I’ve gotten since starting my job here” Steve laughed and shook his head. “I didn’t think…” he began, but groaned in frustration before starting again.
He couldn’t help but smile, as he considered all that he had in his life. Not only were Pepper and Rhodey the greatest best friends he could have ever asked for, but now Steve and Coraline were kind of a thing he had (it looked like it would get there, at least). He never really considered himself fortunate for most of the things that he had in life, but for the first time in a long time, Tony truly felt like the luckiest man alive.
“But this painting... god, I love you so much.” Tony lept into Steve’s arms, wrapping his legs around his boyfriend, and smothering him in a kiss. “Thank you,” he whispered, leaning their foreheads together. “I love it. And I love you.”
Tony ran a hand over his face as he let Pepper’s words settle on him. He remembered back to the day that he overheard Natasha inviting Steve to the party. Steve didn’t want to come, mainly because he didn’t like Tony, and yeah...it hurt like hell to actually hear the blond say it. He had wanted to right things with Steve for quite some time but had never figured out the right way to do it. Tony figured if he could find a way to get Steve to come to his party, maybe he could fix things between them. Not actually expecting that plan to work, Tony went into overdrive trying to make sure nothing screwed up his chances of getting in Steve’s good graces.
“A thing happened at work, and Pepper is busy at some kind of business cocktail hour thing so she can’t help me.”
Steve turned to see where Tony was pointing and, sure enough, there was a clownfish repeatedly swimming into the glass in the tank across from them.
At this point, Howard was seething. Tony hadn’t seen the man this angry since the day he stated that his mother was better off dead than continuing to live with Howard as a husband. The older man stalked over and stood in front of Tony as he sat in his chair. Howard braced his hands on the arms of the chair, leaning in close to Tony’s face.
Tony moved to greet Natasha, taken aback by the hug that she pulled him into. “Glad you and Steve were able to make it,” she said, smugness dripping from her voice.
Less than five minutes went by before calls, texts and emails started flooding his phone. When it got to be too much, he just turned the device off, hoping that he could just fade away from the world all together. He knew there was only a matter of hours before the work day would end and at the very least, Natasha would come looking for him, so he hoped that would be enough time for him to figure this mess out.
He tried, honestly, Tony put in a legitimate effort to let it go. He was doing what a good friend and a respectable alpha would do, helping Steve through his heat. Yet, it felt like so much more. What happened between them was permanently etched in his mind, seemingly popping up at the most inconvenient times. Like right now, for instance. Tony needed to get into work early, to put together the final touches for a very important presentation, he didn’t have the time to deal with this.
“No, but really though! Technically, Steve is Stark Industries property. Maybe I should let him know that I’m not above refreezing things that I own.”
“Why don’t you ask for help? Guy like you has to have a large group of friends who wouldn’t mind lending a hand.”
Once Steve gave him the go ahead, Tony added a second finger. Every so often Steve would flinch, but when Tony said that he’d gladly stop and turn the tables, Steve urged him on. Then, all at once, Tony’s fingers brushed against Steve’s prostate and Steve bucked off the bed.
Steve tried to read the look on Tony’s face, but didn’t see anything more than mild nervousness. He pulled the brunet in by the waist before landing a gentle kiss on his lips. “Thanks so much for this, I’ll make it up to you somehow.”
Walking over to the rest of the team, Steve noticed that Tony was standing with Peter and Rhodey, laughing. The way his nose scrunched up and his eyes crinkled at the edges as he held his stomach, barely able to control his laughter, took Steve’s breath away. He looked on, feeling something new and beautiful and terrifying bloom within his chest as his inner voice confirmed what Steve had suspected for some time now.
, all the while, avoiding any serious conversations. Steve truly would have been grateful for the evening he’d had, if not for the memory of why his friends had come over in the first place.
Steve gave Natasha a weary look as he considered his answer. Truth be told, Steve hadn't planned anything for Halloween, mainly because he worked with all of his friends and they were going to Tony's party. Steve looked up at the brunet, and internally cringed at the cocky smile on the man's face. Everything within him screamed that this was a horrible idea, yet Steve found himself giving a half assed smile before saying "sure, sounds like fun."
treat me with anything less than the respect someone of my stature deserves,” Howard spat out, trying desperately to keep his composure. Tony just looked up at him, smirking as he sat back in his chair.
“I don’t want to ruin the surprise,” Steve said, glancing at his phone. “But it seems he’s here, so why don’t you go let him in.”
The second time was a week later. Their group was supposed to meet in the library to work on the project but they had been the only people to show up. Tony was about to open his mouth, but the words
Tony Stark, the Founder of Stark Labs, billionaire son of Howard Stark, was standing at the end of Steve’s desk, bundled in a designer pea coat, knitted cap, and leather gloves. It took Steve a moment to kick his brain back into gear after it shorted at the realization that Tony was
“You’re so afraid of this that you’d rather run than fight,” Steve spoke, while walking to the door, “well if that’s what you want then fine. But don’t think that you get to have your cake and eat it too. Mason and I are a packaged deal, you don’t just get to throw me away and expect me to think you wouldn’t do the same to her.”
“Definitely,” Steve answered, giving a chuckle that was more nervous than anything else. Thankfully, Tony didn’t seem to notice.
“Where are we going?” Steve asked around a yawn. Tony had woken him up at the asscrack of dawn to get started on their trip.
“I’m sure Steve thinks as much, but is that all you want to be?” Pepper asked, concern lacing her face.
Steve held on a little longer than necessary, as a silent thank you to her. Once they pulled away, she stood and saw herself out. Steve spent the rest of the day doing anything he could to keep his mind off of everything. By the time he had gotten ready for bed, though, all he could think about was the interaction from that morning. He went through every single detail that he remembered about sleeping on Tony, the way he felt, the way he smelled. All things he hadn’t really thought he had the time to notice before falling asleep on the man, but apparently he’d filed away anyway.
“Why wouldn’t we? You’re our friend, Tony, we just want to make sure you’re not being taken advantage of,” Rhodey offered.
“And Batroc. Rachel, and Bernie, and Betty, and Peggy” Bucky listed, ticking off each name on his finger.
“I think we’re going to need a moment,” Pepper answered. Steve just bowed his head and walked away, quietly. Once he returned, Pepper placed an order for both herself and Tony with some kindness in her voice. Steve hoped that the change in attitude wasn’t temporary, and lucky for him it wasn’t.
“Steve! Glad you finally made it down,” Tony yelled over the music. “JARVIS, reduce the music volume by 50%.” he said, seemingly to no one.
“Excuse you, that fucker was huge and clearly after my life so don’t even go there,” Tony responded, attempting to sound offended, and failing miserably.
There was some part of Tony that knew better, but in this moment, all he wanted was to be locked inside of the sweet omega beneath him. Without warning, Tony came, hard, inside of Steve. He felt pulse after pulse of cum release, and sighed as he tried to drive himself deeper. Shortly after that, his knot began to form, and once it had grown to full size, he took hold of Steve’s cock. He tried his best to match the pumping of his fist with the movement of his hips and within no time, Steve came with a shout.
"You know damn well there isn't a single person standing here that would let some shitty rule keep us from our best friends and their brand new baby," Carol explained.
“Yeah uh… it’s a key to my apartment,” Steve offered, clearing his throat while rubbing the back of his head. Tony’s eyes went wide, and Steve scrambled to explain.
“Look, Steve, I don’t know all that’s happened between the two of you, but you have to try to make things right.”
“That look is for the idiot that’s sitting in front of me. I can’t believe you still haven’t asked the guy out. He clearly likes you, just do it!”
Steve stood there, watching as Tony wrapped the scarf around his neck, securely, giving a content smile once he’d gotten himself together.
Steve heard Tony’s voice waiver, before he sniffled, indicating that he was holding back tears. Tony cleared his throat, before continuing on.
, is you. I don't give a fuck what the google does or doesn't say and I don't care what people on this campus think. I love Tony. Cora loves Tony... hell even Peggy loves Tony! That's all that matters."
“Anyway, he said he’d told them that something like that would happen. Who just let’s an eighteen-year-old have exclusive access to an aquarium and let them have sex, in the open, pressed up against a fucking fish tank?”
“Would you like some coffee? Why are you all wet?” Steve asked, moving around, nervously, trying to gather what he needed to prepare coffee.
“Sure thing, Pepper, please have a seat,” Steve offered, taking a seat on the couch as well. “Now, what it is that you wanted to talk about?”
“You and Natasha,” Steve began, shaking his head,”what I just told you was what I was worried about telling you!”
“I mean...in the world or where? I’ve been here all day working, and I haven’t really talked to anyone so--”
A large smile spread on Steve’s face at that. He gave a small nod to Natasha, before they stepped out of the car to head towards the doctor’s office. It didn’t take long after checking in for Steve to be seen by his doctor, a short woman named Dr. Foster.
“What do you mean?” Carol asked, now lowering the TV volume and giving the brunet her full attention.
“Yeah, I mean, now is as good a time as any. We’re both clearly free since, we’re here. Why don’t we finish going through the rest of the museum, then go get something to eat?”
That thought had begun to sink in the next morning, until Steve walked into his office to find Tony standing there. Over a week of not seeing the brunet had apparently caused Steve’s memory to go a little fuzzy, because seeing him here, it seemed that Tony was even more gorgeous than he had remembered.
“Anyway, I wanted to let you know that we’ve noticed that your work has really improved lately, especially what you’ve been doing with our web content. I know you graduated with a degree in Web Design and a minor in Graphic Design, so why’d you come into the company only wanting to do graphic design?”
In that moment it truly felt like they were the only two in the room, but Clint quickly brought him back to reality.
. You don’t need to keep apologizing for things in the past, especially when I’ve forgiven you for it all. I appreciate the gesture, but I just want to move forward with you and Coraline, and make up for the time that we’ve lost.”
Steve stood up slowly, adjusting his now cum stained apron. “I guess we should get dressed before we go about the rest of our day?”
The rest of the evening consisted of conversations about the meet up and plans for the robotics team over sushi. Steve talked about strategy for the team’s first robotics meet, animatedly waving sushi with his chopsticks.
Tony stood at the door, watching as Steve and his friends drove away. Once he finally turned to go back to his friends, he saw them standing not far behind him.
Tony stood beside his friend Bruce as he paid for his lunch. Once they finally found a table at the on campus deli, Tony responded to the question with a shrug.
“Aww, but we weren’t done gossiping about which student couples we think made it through the Summer break,” Barton whined.
“For a man who seems so interesting, I wouldn’t expect you to like the most boring ice cream flavor the world has to offer,” Steve said, giving a nod of thanks as the waiter placed a glass of water in front of him. The second their waiter left the table, Tony stuck a finger in his glass, and flicked it at the blond.
During his four years in the army before he was discharged, Steve spent his time training to become a strategist. He’d been taught how to truly evaluate and dissect any and all obstacles that came his way, to a point where he tried to solve all of life’s troubles in the same way. His fears about this new job were no different.
“You are not the only one whose feelings are at stake here. You are not the only person who’s ever been hurt before. You’re allowed to move on and you’re allowed to be happy. I know better than anyone what it’s like to want to wallow in the past forever but at some point you need to pick up and move on. So when you decide that you’re done sacrificing your happiness to make up for your past, come find me.”
“Maybe he’s not interested,” she offered, with a slight shrug. Tony looked at her, bewildered, and scoffed.
It pained Steve to know that he couldn’t see his daughter, he wasn’t even sure of when he would get to meet her. But hearing Tony talk about her, talk about Mason was an amazing feeling. As the doctors began their efforts to stitch him back up, Steve willed himself to wake up, to no avail. He wanted to let Tony know that he was awake, and that he was ok, but he just couldn’t get his body to move.
“This is awful,” Steve whined as he helped Tony untangle his limbs from the sweater that was currently holding him hostage. “I’m so sorry.”
“Really? Even after all the grief I’ve given you for the past three years?” Tony asked, a hint of hope in his voice.
When he got an email from her saying that she wanted to talk to him as soon as he woke up, Steve knew he was in for a very unpleasant conversation.
“Yeah, I feel like with all this craziness going on, we haven’t really had a chance to spend time together,” Steve offered, wrapping an arm around the redhead's shoulders.
Tony just flipped her off, and shook his head laughing. It was rare that he really sought the advice of those around him, but when he did it always served as a reminder that he was truly lucky to have the friends he had.
Steve had been applying for jobs all summer, and finally heard back from the Olive Garden, of all places. When it finally came time for his interview, he stood outside. He could hear Cora telling everyone it was her birthday. He could see the proud smile on Tony’s face after he took Cora to the bathroom. His hand felt cold without Tony’s in it. So much was riding on him getting this job and all he could think about was the last time he had been here; when he was happy. Not wanting to be late, he finally took a deep breath and walked in.
Tony waved off the apology. “It’s fine, there’s no way you’d have known without me saying as much. It’s just...things were really bad back when I drank and I really don’t ever want to get back to that place again. But I also don’t want my sobriety to be something that gets in the way of me living my life so I decided a long time ago that I’d work to be able to spend time around alcohol and drinking without feeling the need to partake. I usually just drink soda water with a lime and people are none the wiser.”
“Well,” he started, handing Cora’s snacks to her. “I um… I’ll be leaving Thursday morning for two weeks. I’m being forced to go on holiday with my parents for Christmas break.”
Tony was halfway out the door when Coraline made a sound. Tony turned around to see the baby’s eyes trained on him.
“Ah, I see. That’s kind of how my friend group met as well. I mean, Rhodey and I met and through me, Rhodey and Pepper became best friends. Really, what bonded them was just trying to keep my dumb ass out of trouble,” Tony said around a laugh.
about alcohol makes me want to,” he said, pitifully taking a bite of his toast. “Thanks for the food, by the way.”
Tony just gaped at the blond before seemingly shaking himself out of his stupor. “I’ll uh… just coke and a lemon water, please.”
“You guys should go together! That’s what my friends and I do when we’re all going to the same event; we just make plans to go together!”
Before he knew it, Steve had arrived at the park. He shot off a text to Tony letting him know where he was waiting, and within a few minutes, he heard someone calling his name.
Bucky just smiled down at the smaller man, knowing all too well just how eager Steve always seemed to be to stand up to literally anyone.
“Just because I left twenty minutes after you guys doesn't mean I was going to be late. It’s amazing how quickly you can get places when you treat the speed limit as merely a suggestion!” Tony said, smiling devilishly.
“You missed it. You missed hearing this baby’s heartbeat; seeing them for the first time. It was the best moment of my life, because it confirmed that this wasn’t a dream and that this baby is real and you missed that.”
“Steve, I love you, I always have and I always will. You are one of my best friends, you’re the father of my child, and I couldn’t imagine my life without you in it. With all that being said, you might be the most aggravating, stubborn ass I’ve ever met.”
“Anyway, as Clint was saying, we’d like you to be a chaperone,” Natasha stated. “All you have to do is give up your Saturday evening to hang out and make sure a bunch of high school kids don’t get up to anything crazy. Also you get to stand around, drinking punch and listening to music.”
They pulled up to the front, stepping out of the car to grab their bags. Tony handed his keys and a bill that’s worth Steve wasn’t able to determine, as they walked into the lobby to check in. Once at the front counter, Tony placed his hand on the chest high countertop, smiling wide once the young attendant met eyes with him.
“Okay, great!” Steve began. “Well if you’re free, would you like to grab a drink? I’ve got a lot to process from today, and I find that’s best done with beer and good company.”
It was only a matter of seconds before Steve felt Tony’s lips on his own. Initially, his intentions were innocent, all he wanted was to just kiss Tony for a moment or two, but before he knew it, Steve had lifted the brunet into his lap, hands resting on his hips, as he deepened the kiss. To have the weight of Tony’s body on him felt amazing, and Steve wanted nothing more than to take as much as Tony was willing to give.
Steve squared his shoulders and lifted his chin. “I don’t know much about robotics, but every team needs someone who’s good at assessing strategies, no matter what game that team is playing.”
“She would probably tell me that she’s disappointed in my carelessness but that she’d still love and support me no matter what. But unfortunately, with her being dead and all, I guess we’ll never know, will we?”
“Is that not what you said about the others that you were ‘so in love with’?” Howard asked, moving to examine the items on Tony’s desk with feigned interest.
“Considering who you grew up with and the examples you had, you are literally the last human being who should be lecturing me on love,” Steve snapped.
lunch. I always bring a little extra since I know you’ve got an aversion to actually taking care of yourself.”
“I truly am sorry for all of this, but we couldn’t keep living a lie. I promise you, Tony, that this is all for the best.”
“Absolutely,” Steve answered, honestly. “Plus, I wasn’t sure how far you were going to go to not have to share a room with me, and I wasn’t in the mood to have my feelings hurt,” Steve added, looking down but smirking up at Tony through his lashes.
The conversation he’d had with Rhodey, while somewhat annoying, really made Tony think. He wanted to give Steve a chance to prove himself, but he also wanted to give his team the best chance possible at having a successful season. The only way that was going to happen was if Tony did the work to make sure that Steve was at least somewhat familiar with robotics.
The robotics league had very strict rules about what qualified as acceptable for teams to use. Very basic machine learning was allowed, as long as it still required some input from the students controlling the bots. Running something like this, where the bot was basically fully autonomous was against the rules.
It felt like the day dragged on longer than usual. Tony attributed half of it to the rainy weather and the other half to the fact that he was waiting for his meeting with Steve and Natasha. Once work was over, Tony hurried to
"I've known Tony for what feels like forever and other those years I've seen a lot of people come into his life who wanted nothing but to use him. I know you haven't known him very long, at least not long enough to notice this but the one thing Tony wants more than anything is to be accepted and liked by those around him. It's because of this that he goes to great lengths to please people he cares about, whether or not his actions are in his best interest."
As Steve made his way through the house, it dawned on him that he hadn’t really seen much of Tony all night. Aside from during their group photos, Tony was seemingly busy entertaining everyone who wasn’t Steve. The blond didn’t know why that fact irked him the way it did but after all the fuss over him showing up, he figured Tony would have at least said hello. Steve tried not to think too much about it as he made his way up to the main level of the house and out on the back deck.
“We haven’t bonded, okay? Truth be told, I doubt we will. I mean...I don’t really think much about it, mainly because I’m just so confused all the time about what we are right now,” Tony finally answered.
“What I’m trying to say is...I think maybe things have happened this way because we were meant to be together, and I was wondering if...I mean, when you’re ready of course, but I was wondering if you wanted to be my bond mate?”
Steve choked on his drink, but Tony turned to give Bucky a wicked grin. “Well, she’s not new but I hear there’s a Russian teacher who’ll be on the market once she ditches her current fiance.”
“I had to call in a lot of favors to figure out who the mole at SI was, so the least you can do is chaperone this dance, Tony.”
With that, Tony put his phone down and got to preparing the rest of dinner. He didn’t do it often, but the alpha absolutely loved making dinner for others. Something about it gave him a sense of happiness that he was never quite able to explain. Very few people were even aware of the fact that Tony knew his way around the kitchen, but those who did never passed up the chance to have some of his cooking.
Steve nestled up to the alpha as they settled into the bed, knowing full well that any hospital personnel would have a fit if they saw the pair as they were. But neither of them cared.
“Alright, great. Tony should be here soon, so I suppose I’ll get out of your hair,” Pepper said, standing to walk towards the door.
After that first day, a habit formed. Steve would bring down food and then the two of them would just sit there while Tony worked. Steve being completely silent lasted all of five minutes, but Tony just gave up on pretending to be irritated by all the questions. As much as he hated to admit it, Tony actually enjoyed having Steve around. Aside from Bruce, no one ever expressed an interest in the things that he did. Though he knew practically everything he said was going over Steve’s head, Tony saw that he was trying and he couldn’t fault him for that.
Tony hadn’t slept in days. Aside from Howard practically working him to death during his trip, he was anxious and worried about returning home. He had truly missed both Steve and Bug, but those feelings were paired with a sense of mourning now. Part of him had wanted to back out of what he had resolved to do, just be selfish and continue living the way he had been for the better part of six months now. But he knew that that would just be proving his father right.
“You know, I used to love Captain Planet, but never in a million years would I have thought I’d be standing here in my twenties dressed as the Heart planeteer. It’s just weird because he was arguably the most useless team member, and I’m arguably the most useful team member at work.”
Tony sat at his desk, typing away, with a small smile on his face. He sat patiently, waiting for the one regular daily occurrence that he’d come to look forward to. Like clockwork, at 10:30 am Steve popped up, seemingly out of nowhere, with a sheepish grin on his face.
“I want to show you how much I love being your omega,” Steve climbed onto the bed, straddling Tony’s legs. He ground down, slowly, soliciting a low moan from the alpha as their cocks brushed against each other.
They sat through the rest of their meal, quietly exchanging glances and small smiles. Once they were finished, Tony offered to wash the dishes while Steve set up a movie for them to watch. Tony finally joined Steve on the couch, as the movie began playing.
“Well, I’m adapting to your sense of humor, so either stop teaching me how to be sarcastic or learn to deal with it.”
Steve chuckled at Tony’s ridiculousness. Though it seemed like a daunting task, he was beyond excited to celebrate Halloween with Cora this year. It was the first year that they were taking her out trick-or-treating.
Tony gave a playful sigh before putting down the tools he’d been working with. He wasn't exactly sure how to answer his friend’s question. Had he spent all of his money at
His mom developed Multiple Sclerosis when he was in middle school and it had steadily been getting worse. When Steve graduated college, it had become apparent that she would need to live in a community where someone could look after her. Having his mom live there gave Steve peace of mind, knowing that if she had a flare-up someone would always be there to help her, but the distance did weigh heavy on him. He tried to make it out to her every other Sunday, but with his two jobs now, that made things a little difficult. This would be Steve’s first visit since starting at
Steve knew he should probably just drop it; Tony never talked about his family and there was probably a very good reason for that. But he began to realize that he had a lot of questions about Tony that needed to be answered. Whether either of them liked it or not.
“Honestly, Cap, it’s perfectly fine,” he offered before turning on his heels and walking off in their original direction.
Pepper looked at Tony with a soft smile, and he physically cringed. She thought this was endearing, he could practically feel the sympathy radiating off of her, which somehow made it all worse.
Steve woke up, drenched in sweat and writhing in pain. He’d been feeling like absolute shit for almost two weeks now, and he couldn’t figure out why at first...until today. This was the first time since he hit puberty that Steve had gone into an unexpected heat. He’d always tried to be so careful to make sure that he took his suppressants, and to this day he had always stayed on top of it. However, the new suppressant he was taking, a shot given once every three months, had it’s side effects; one being the possibility of an unexpected heat. The omega cursed himself for not noticing the signs sooner so he could possibly stop it or at least prepare for it. He sat in his apartment, alone, in the worst pain, while the people he trusted most were nowhere near to help.
“Yeah, you won, but you could have done it in an easier, quicker way that would have likely put less strain on your bots, ultimately prolonging the longevity of the machines the team uses.” Steve said, matter of fact.
The day had finally come; it was New Years Eve and Tony was going to take Steve on the most perfect date imaginable. He’d been beside himself since finding out that Peggy would be able to watch after Cora for them. The only thing that got him through his horrible Christmas holiday was knowing that, come New Years Eve, he’d have Steve all to himself.
“Well, I told my friends about the baby, and may or may not have induced a panic attack in the process…”
"Alright, so, honestly I’ve been avoiding bringing this up for months now,” Tony started, causing all of the blood to drain from Steve’s face, “but...uhm...you’ve heard of Stark Industries before, right?”
Steve gave a small smile, still a little groggy, but managed get out the one thing he’d been wanting to say for months now. He looked into the eyes of the brunet and struggled to whisper.
“Okay, uh, there are stairs,” Tony admitted, bringing Steve to the bottom of them. “But we got this, right?”
“Well, I’ve been getting sick lately because I’ve been dealing with morning sickness. Tony I’m...I’m pregnant.”
“Yeah. My left contact ended up going down the drain this morning and I didn’t have it in me to find and open another pair.”
Tony could tell that Steve wasn’t happy in the slightest about Bucky’s behavior. He wanted nothing more than to put a stop to the questions, but Tony knew that he needed to get through this. He gingerly placed his hand on Steve’s arm, causing the blond to look at him, concerned. Tony just gave him a small smile before stepping forward to stand right in front of Bucky.
Bucky seemed to visibly relax, if only a little, at Steve’s words. Natasha, however, fixed him with a suspicious look.
“Are you sure?” Tony knew it felt good, but he also knew that the first couple of times hurt a little. “I don’t want to rush anything if you’re not comfo--”
Steve looked puzzled momentarily, before realization hit. “Oh, this! I found it in the closet when I first got here. It was nice of you to get me something for this trip,” he said around a bashful smile before digging in to the meal in front of him. Tony tried his best to eat his dinner and listen to his boyfriend’s conversation, but all he could do was stare at Steve in that sweater...in
Steve considered both names, thought what it would be like to finally their baby and have a legitimate name for them, and a wide smile broke out onto his face.
“If you knew Steve, you’d know that’s not the kind of guy he is. He barely lets me buy him lunch let alone try to steal my money.”
Tony gave a slow thrust into Steve’s fist, pulling a low groan from both men. Tony’s movement melted into a mix of thrusting up into Steve fist as he jerked them off. Steve was close, he could feel his orgasm bubbling within his belly. Tony pulled him in for a kiss, licking into his mouth. The moment Steve felt Tony’s teeth rake across his bottom lip, Steve lost it. He came with a low groan, cum spilling over his hand and Tony’s cock.
“Mmhmm.” Steve offered, seemingly more interested in shoveling food in his face than answering his friend’s questions.
“That’s ok,” Steve replied, stopping to turn and look at the brunet, “ that just means you’ve got more space to fill with your friends and the people you care about. And hey, if you really are as good a cook as you say, maybe we can put together a dinner party for our friends some time.”
“Food time!” he yelled, as he parked behind the small diner. He made his way around the side of the car to open Steve’s door and let him out. “I’m going to take this blindfold off of you, but you have to promise not to try to figure out where we are, ok?” Steve just nodded. Once the blindfold was off, he stuck his tongue out, mock angry, before turning to stomp off into the diner.
“Happy to help,” Steve said with an understanding smile. “It was pretty evident by the split second look of fear and annoyance, when that first guy introduced himself, that you didn’t really want to deal with that kind of stuff.”
“And what do any of those projects have to do with you? You’ve been down there almost as much as he has these last few weeks.”
, speed walking through the rain. He found the pair sitting at a table in the back, and was excited to make his way to them until he saw the apprehensive look on the blond’s face. He stopped once he reached the table, trying not to let his smile falter.
Tony flinched at hearing Natasha’s words. He knew this was bad, but he truly had no idea. Steve clearly cared for Tony, much more than he knew.
Steve narrowed his eyes at Tony, now looking offended by the accusation. “I don't know what the hell you’re talking about, but why would I come back here and ask you on a date if I was part of this elaborate scheme to steal your tech?”
“So, I’m thinking,” Tony whispered, as he laid a trail of kisses from the base of Steve’s neck to his ear. “Maybe once we put Cora to bed, we could test out that jacuzzi tub. Y’know, make sure it really does have enough room for two and all.”
“Seriously, Tony, what’s the big deal? So you have a crush on the guy, so what?” Carol asked, a more caring tone this time.
“Well, when you have some free time, we will need to catch up,” Tony stated, making it clear that bruce didn’t have much of a choice.
Tony paced around his office, nervously waiting. After he had dropped off Peter, Tony received another text from Tiberius telling him to be ready to meet at Stark Tower on Sunday afternoon. So here Tony was, waiting like an idiot.
“Hey, what’s your schedule look like today?” Steve asked, as he had every day for the past two months.
“You still have time to make things right,” Bruce said, now with a kinder tone, “obviously it’s going to take some time, but Steve does miss you. He wanted for things to work out between you two, and I’m sure if you explain this all to him, he’ll understand --”
“Steve, I want to thank you for being such a good friend to Tony. Though my decision to leave him honestly has nothing to do with anything he has done, I can’t change my mind.”
By the time Bucky and Natasha had arrived, Cora had finally stopped crying, though she ran from Steve every time he tried to get close to her.The second Cora saw Natasha, her mood changed, dramatically.
Tony surged forward, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck in a hug. “I love it,” he breathed before pulling away and taking Steve’s face in his hands. “And I love you.”
awkward now that he and Tony weren’t...talking or dating or whatever it was that they were doing before.
to take this farther. I just… I like you a lot Steve, and I want to make sure that we do this right. I don't want to just jump into something like this and make it all about the physical stuff before we're ready."
“Nah, I should be good from here. Get yourself to the B&B I booked for you and rest up for your drive back to the city tomorrow,” Tony replied. Happy gave a nod before climbing into the car and heading off to his accommodations for the evening.
“Where did you get that sweater?” Tony asked, completely glossing over what had just been said in favor of taking in the navy marl Aran sweater before him.
When he came back to himself, Steve saw Clint clear across the gym, standing close to a door, waving his arms. “Yoohoo, blondie! Keep up with the tour or get left behind!” Steve rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed at having fallen behind, before walking towards the shorter man.
By the time, Tony’s knot had gone down, he had managed to doze off. Steve felt the draw of sleep pulling him further as he snuggled closely to the man beneath him. He knew that at some point they’d need to talk this all over, but Steve couldn’t hold back a smile as he looked up at Tony, at
“Is that all that’s got you so stressed?” Bucky asked, apparently better at reading Steve than the blond had thought.
“So, Stark, how’s the school year going? Any cute teachers you’ve got your eye on?” Bucky asked, steering the conversation in a whole new direction.
“Why not?” Tony asked, standing his ground. He’d gotten this far. “I’ve been flirting with you for weeks! You clearly want to flirt back, but you just don’t. It’s infuriating. Do I smell or something? No, I know the answer to that because I wear very expensive cologne, so it’s obviously not that. But, I do have to admit, your restraint and self control alone are pretty admirable and deserve a reward.”
Upon exiting the elevator, it dawned on Steve, that not only was he about to see his crush’s apartment, but was he about to see where
The ride to the party mostly consisted of Steve geeking out over the custom dark green ‘67 Camaro that Tony had driven. He wanted to impress the blond and the best way he could think to do that was with a flashy car, so sue him. He’d hoped that Steve would enjoy the ride, and as the man excitedly changed subjects from cars to motorcycles, Tony tried to internally process the afternoon they’d just had.
It’d been a long day for Tony so far. He’d woken up earlier than anticipated, and found himself pressed against Steve’s back, arm flung over his chest. Tony told himself that would be his own little secret as he slowly took his arm back and put some space between the two of them. The unhappy whine that came from Steve would be another of Tony’s little secrets.
Steve poured him a cup, taking care to use the dishes he’d laid out on the table. He handed the mug over to Tony, waiting for him to shake off the haze of sleep, which happened right around the time that Tony reached out to rub Steve’s back in thanks.
Steve really wanted to push this, he couldn’t imagine what Tony had to say that he felt he couldn’t share, but he decided to drop it for now. If Tony wanted time, then the least he could do was give him that. He just wasn’t sure how much longer he’d be able to wait around for Tony to finally let him in.
They made quick work of their meal, and though he had to practically rip Steve away from the sink and the dirty dishes he was intent on washing, Tony was finally able to get them both settled on the couch.
“I can do you one better,” the omega challenged, “I told my friends about the baby and ended up pinning my best friend to the wall in a choke hold after growling at everyone in the apartment.”
.” Tony gingerly grasped Steve’s cock, giving his boyfriend the chance to protest at any point, but the shuddering exhale Steve let out was indication enough to continue.
Steve could hear the smile in her voice and wanted to throw the biggest tantrum, but just kept his eyes shut for the remainder of the ride. When he felt the car come to a stop, he opened his eyes to see that they were back at his apartment. He exited the car, not even pretending to give the bag of...objects, a second thought. Natasha followed him to his front door and the second he stepped inside, he felt a finger tapping his shoulder. Steve turned to see the redhead holding out the black plastic bag.
Once he pulled up to the hospital, a large smile spread across Tony’s face, as he saw Steve standing there waiting.
“Do you think just because you’re away at school that you are not going to be held to the same family expectations as in years previous? You are a Stark by blood and you will join your mother and I in Italy, end of story. Now I really must go.”
Tony sprang forward to wrap his arms around the man in front of him in a hug. The positioning was awkward, given the fact that Steve was sitting, but Tony didn’t care.
“I don’t think you understand, Rogers” Bucky spoke, quiet anger seeping through each word and causing a shiver down Steve’s spine.
Tony began peppering kisses from Steve's shoulder up his neck, all the while slowly stroking Steve under the apron. Just as Steve felt the faint tingling of pleasure rising up his spine, Tony withdrew his hand, stopping to whisper in Steve's ear. “I think one of the first traditions we should start is eating dessert right after breakfast.” Tony moved his hands to massage Steve’s ass, and he couldn't help but hitch his breath at the implication. “Spread your legs and lean on the counter,” Tony ordered.
“For the last fucking time, we aren’t dating!” Steve spat out, beyond done with the conversation at hand.
They’d been out celebrating their friend Janet’s birthday, having a great time dancing. Steve had been looking forward to letting loose after an exhausting week at work, laying out the next edition of SHIELD Entertainment magazine, and he couldn’t wait to show off his favorite clubbing look. According to Tony, Steve always looked gorgeous in whatever he wore, but he never actually
Steve sat there and continued to listen as the sound took him over. The only word he could think to describe this moment was overwhelming, but only in the best way possible.
When Steve finally reached his room, he’d let out a breath he didn’t even know he was holding. Not only had he confessed that he had feelings for Tony, but he told him that he wanted to try a relationship. This day had gone in a direction that Steve never could have predicted. He wanted someone to talk to about this but he had no idea who to go to. He ran through the list of friends he could trust with this, but only came up with Tony and Jarvis. As great as Jarvis was, Steve knew he needed to talk to a real person. There was on person who came to mind that may have been the most trustworthy person on the planet, Steve just didn’t know whether or not they would give a damn about his issues. He decided to take a chance and made his way down the hall. When he finally made it to his destination he quietly knocked on the door. He stood there for a moment, and when no one answered, he considered leaving. Just as he turned to go, he door opened.
“Ah, you really didn’t have to,” Tony offered, taking a seat and serving himself a plate in spite of his previous statement.
Steve smiled wide at Pepper as she waved goodbye before closing the door behind her. He wanted to think that Pepper believed his words, that she understood that he meant what he said about making up for his actions. But he knew it would take some time for her, for anyone, to truly believe that he was in this for the long haul. As he received the text from Tony saying that he was downstairs to pick him up, Steve promised himself that no matter what, he would do whatever it took to make sure that above all else, Tony knew just how loved he truly was.
“I’m taking that as license to come in here and talk your ear off, which, you will probably come to regret,” Tony spoke, putting down is payment.
The alpha sat there in silence, looking down at the table. Steve followed his eyes to their hands, and immediately drew his hand away, as if he’d been burned.
The alpha had finally started coming to terms with the fact that he had feelings for Steve, even before finding out about the baby. Tony was fairly certain that it was next to impossible for the omega to be any more adorable than he was regularly until he walked into Steve's apartment that day. He had been so embarrassed to tell the alpha about his shopping mishap, but Tony swore he was going to die right then and there looking at the blond’s face. All he wanted was to grab the man and give him a kiss at that moment, but he thought better of it, and just laughed.
“Look, you’re clearly not going to be able to live like this forever. At some point, you’re going to have to realize that you have legitimate feelings for this guy and do something about it. Because as much as I love coming over here for free food, I can’t keep watching you run around like a lovesick puppy trying to figure out what to do. Just ask him on a date and quit bothering me about it.”
The look of sheer amazement on Steve’s face at the thought of Tony’s suggestion was enough to make the alpha give a small laugh. From the time that the waiter came to take their orders up until their food was delivered, Steve was beaming with happiness and excitement for his meal. As the blond prepared to dig into the plate in front of him, Tony just smiled and shook his head.
“I...I’m so sorry, sir,” the girl, ‘Heidi’ as stated on her nametag, began typing, clearly starting to panic.
That night, though, when Tony had less control over his thoughts than he would have liked, his dream ran wild. The brunet found himself faced with a naked Steve, working himself open, and begging for Tony to take him. The smaller man was panting, telling Tony that he could use him however he wanted; that all he wanted was to make the taller man feel good. Somewhere in his mind, Tony wanted to resist, but his dream self wasn’t going to pass up such an amazing opportunity. He obliged the blond’s requests and sank into him. From there, it didn’t take long for both of them to finish, Tony coming with Steve’s name on his lips.
The meeting went by relatively quickly, as the students started planning the bots that they wanted to build for the season. Tony observed as Steve walked around, commenting on the work that was being done, and even giving his input on what skill sets might be more useful to have at their disposal. Watching Steve interact with students in a normal setting would have been nothing, but watching him with these kids,
The second the omega stepped in the store, however, he was suddenly overwhelmed with an intense craving for fruit. Walking through the produce section, Steve stopped by each and every single fruit considering whether or not he could fit it into dinner somehow. After a few minutes he decided he didn't much care whether or not he could fit certain fruits into dinner and just put almost everything in sight into his cart.
As he left the restaurant, Steve couldn’t help but smile to himself. For the first time in weeks he felt like he could breathe.
It was the end of the day, and Tony found himself making his way to the Shop class room. They had learned the previous year that holding robotics team meetings in that class room made life easier when they needed to build or make modifications on their bots. As he continued down the hall, holding his box for the meeting, Tony thought back to earlier in the day with Steve and Peter.
He jumped at the boom of Pepper’s voice. As impossible as it seemed, Tony closed his mouth and sat in silence.
“Yes, but I’m your mess and currently, this mess is pissed that a 90 year old man in a star spangled unitard said such shitty things about me!”
Steve stood completely still as the brunet finished tying off the scarf. Standing this close, he could smell Tony’s shampoo. The minty scent had a hint of something that Steve couldn’t quite place, but something about the aroma as a whole was extremely comforting.
“That is actually what her feet looked like the day she was born. Size and everything. I brought the certificate with me when I went to get it done.”
Tony looked up from the papers he was grading at his desk to see Peter Parker, his student assistant, holding the small bin with graphing calculators. Peter was a junior who had taken Advanced Physics the year before, and was also a member of the robotics team. When Peter had said he needed a place to spend his free periods, Tony had agreed to let him help around his classroom.
Once they got to the carousel, Tony made sure to step in front of the blond. “Don’t worry, I got this,” he said, taking out a five dollar bill. “No point in having all this money if you can’t throw it around a little.”
“Have you ever stopped to think that your father just keeps putting these thoughts in your head because he wants you to be miserable?!” Bruce yelled, removing his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose to calm himself down.
Steve saw the smallest flicker of a look between Tony and Peter out of the corner of his eye. A little confused, the blond just ignored it in favor of progressing the conversation. “I’m not doing anything that afternoon, if you’d like to go together.”
Tony plopped down next to Pepper, and slowly nestled his head up to her neck. She began stroking his hair as he continued to whine (because honestly, this level of complaining could rival that of a 5 year old), and rolling her eyes as she strapped in for what was sure to be an endless night of reassuring Iron Man.
“Alright then, I’ll see you in a bit,” Tony said softly, smiling to himself as he walked out of the teacher’s lounge.
He wanted to tell Steve that he was wrong, that he’d never hurt Mason like this, but truth be told he didn’t even believe that right now. The second he stepped out of the apartment, the door slammed behind him. He held his head high as he walked to the elevator, waited in the lobby, and rode home in a cab. The second he locked the door to his house, though, he crumpled to the floor and let out a sob as he cried in earnest, reminding himself over and over again that no matter how much this hurt, he did the right thing.
“It’s a pi’ture of yew, me an’ Ony! It’s for his burfday!” Steve looked over the picture, smiling wide at the crudely drawn blobs of various sizes, the smallest one wearing something that looked to resemble a bow.
“Yeah,” Steve answered in a hushed voice, “As long as Tony is part of the package, I'm more than okay with anything else that’s included.”
One would have thought that after an entire night of venting, Tony would have gotten over his tiff with Steve. However, Tony Stark has never been known to just let things go (he currently holds the record for longest grudge ever held). So Pepper knew that something was up when three weeks later, Tony was still griping about it.
“Please, call me Maria,” she said, standing to offer her hand. “Nice to meet you, Steve. If you could, just follow me to the principal's office.”
Steve’s laugh turned into a whine turned into a moan. “I sincerely doubt that.” After a few moments, Steve squeezed Tony’s hand. “Go ahead. Move.”
Everything had been or was going to be ruined. His company, his team, his relationship with Steve...everything. Tony gave himself a few minutes to wallow in the sorrow of this entire mess, but the second he stepped back out into the hallway he rolled his shoulders back, stood up straight and walked out of that school as a man on a mission.
Steve seemed to want to look anywhere other than the alpha, but when he finally did, Tony could see the tears threatening to fall from his eyes.
“Seriously, Steve, you becoming friends with Tony is probably the best thing that’s happened to us!” Sam spoke, excitedly.
“I’m going to overlook you judging my taste in wonderful television programming, and just focus on the rest of your statement,” Steve said around a small laugh.
“Hi Steve, I see here that you’ve not been feeling very well lately,” Dr. Foster, looking at Steve's chart.
“Wait, what?” Tony asked, feeling his cheeks warm at the realization that he had completely missed whatever had been said to him.
“I’m really sorry to do this, but Cora will be home soon. I want her to know that you’re back in our lives but I’m just not sure tonight is the best time.”
Tony sat at his desk, tinkering with one of the robots from the year before. He’d brought it out in the hopes that he could use it to help teach Steve some of the basics of engineering, and wanted to make sure that it was in decent working order.
They needed to move, but Tony knew there was no way they'd make it anywhere near the bedroom with how desperate he was to have the younger man. “Living room,” he stated more than asked, hoping that his intentions were understood. Steve just gave a shaky breath but nodded, letting himself be pulled along towards the couch. Tony gently urged Steve to sit down, before grabbing a pillow. “Jarvis, lights off, fire on,” he spoke without taking his eyes off of the man in front of him.
“I mean how long have you been unhappy with me? How long have you wanted to end this? And how long have you been
Tony had been beside himself thinking about what Steve’s words meant to him, and as he sat on that jet, dreading what the next two weeks had in store for him, he came to the conclusion that Steve was it. Steve was the one he was meant to bond with, and Tony was a little more than excited and terrified about it. He decided to close his eyes and rest up before the actual nightmare he was sure that time around Howard would be, but as he faded off to sleep, Tony had the hope of bonding with Steve once he got home at the forefront of his mind.
Tony just nodded, as he made his way to the front door. Without checking through the peephole, he opened the door quickly.
In the handful of weeks they had been together, Steve and Tony had done all of this before. Making out, hand jobs, blow jobs, even sex. But Tony had always been the one to bottom. They’d talked about it, and Steve had expressed interest in wanting to switch roles at some point. Tony just didn't expect that point to be right now.
“Master has been very sorrowful for the past few weeks, yet he hasn’t truly dealt with those feelings. Perhaps you should give him the chance to drown his sorrows in a place where he will still be safe.”
As he sat there on his own, laying on the exam table, Steve couldn’t help but smile from ear to ear while thinking about what he had just seen. Seeing and hearing his baby was a surreal experience and he knew he would remember this forever. There was a knock at the door before the doctor came back in holding a folder. Steve vaguely listened to Dr. Banner’s words as he talked of future appointments and gave his congratulations.
“I figure it’d be a lot easier for me to have morning sex with you if you were actually in my bed instead of halfway across campus when I woke up.”
Tony gave a confused look, only to be met with the faces of all their friends. Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, Carol, Sam and Clint piled into the small hospital room, all seeming highly pleased with their ability to surprise Tony.
“Did you do all of this yourself?” Tony asked, looking around at the candles and the nice dishes set out.
Steve took in the antsy, almost nervous look on Tony's face as he waited for an answer. Steve turned toward the window, watching as huge, soft snowflakes continued to fall. Nothing about this day made any sense to him, but Steve knew not to ask too many questions when the universe handed you such an amazing opportunity. “Okay...yeah, sure. That sounds great, thank you,” Steve stood packing up his things. Once he'd gotten all his belongings and bundled up, he reached out a gloved hand. “I'm Steve Rogers, by the way.”
And with that, Tony resolved to make his way to Steve’s house...once he figured out where exactly that was. He did some digging online, losing some of his buzz in the process. Though he was able to think a little clearer, he was still just as intent on making this trip.
“Simmer down now, I didn’t say anything about all that,” Bucky said around a laugh, “well, I’m gunna head out so I’ll see you tomorrow, but good luck tonight!”
“Tony, hon,” Pepper said gently, as she placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “why don’t we go outside for a minute, hmm?” she asked, guiding him towards the back door.
"Glad to see some familiar faces," Tony spoke, slowly removing himself from the bed, making an effort not to stir the sleeping omega.
Steve swatted at him, rolling his eyes as he smiled fondly. “None of that, mister. We’ve got to eat breakfast before we start any of our holiday festivities.”
Natasha bit her lip for a second, considering whether or not she really wanted to ask, but gave a sigh when she finally decided to go for it.
“One of these days, you’re going to have to order something other than coke,” Steve joked. Tony wanted to respond with a witty rebuttal, but he was too busy not being able to breathe thanks to the smile that Steve had just given him. Bruce looked between the two before shaking his head and asking for a water. Once Steve left, Tony finally began breathing again.
He wanted to remember the way it felt when Steve put the lube on his finger and twirled it against Tony’s entrance. He wanted to remember the way Steve used his middle finger to rub against his prostate while cupping his balls and kissing the head of his cock. He wanted to remember the way it felt when the head of Steve’s cock entered him. He wanted to remember the look on Steve’s face as he pushed all the way in.
The day before, almost immediately after Bucky left his office, Coulson stopped by to let Tony know that one of his deadlines had been pushed forward. As if he wasn’t overworked and stressed enough without this added weight of this deadline added to the mix. All he could do was grumble under his breath but get to work and hope he’d be able to get at least a couple hours of sleep that night.
It seemed as though the car ride was significantly shorter the second time around, but once they reached Steve’s apartment, he just grabbed Tony’s hand and led him up in silence. Neither of them said a word until they’d made it to Steve’s couch.
“Tony, honey, you have to breath slowly, ok? Rhodey, get some water…” Pepper instructed as she knelt down in front of the brunet.
With Steve working earlier and Tony meeting up with his friends for breakfast, they figured they didn’t have enough time for their usual museum and late lunch, so Steve invited the brunet over for movies.He was all to happy for the change in plans until he came to find out they’d be watching horror movies. Tony tried to play it cool, as if horror movies didn't scare the shit out of him. People always assumed since he was a genius he’d know better than to be afraid of some so seemingly harmless, and yet, here he was, pretty much hiding behind his hands and the blanket that he was sitting under throughout the entirety of
Tony left the gym, racking his brain to figure out where the blond would be, when it hit him. He ran out to the parking lot, looking around until he found Steve’s car. Tony took a moment, seeing Steve sitting with his eyes closed, just like on his first day. He smiled as he gently knocked at the window, startling the blond.
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Tony replied, picking up one of the takeout containers to pick over what little was left.
Steve’s nerves started to ease. This wasn’t the place where they went for Cora’s birthday; this was the place that he would hopefully be working at.
Steve remembered looking up seconds before a car slammed right into his taxi. The car hit the driver’s side, opposite of where Steve sat, buckled in safely. He played the events back in his mind and as if in slow motion, he remembered the shattering of glass, the explosion of the driver’s airbag, the feeling of his seat belt buckling at his chest as he was thrust forward , and his head whipping to the left before slamming into the window causing everything to go black. Once he was able to recall what had happened, Steve began to panic. Where was he and why couldn’t he move?
“Regardless, I didn’t just spend three weeks of my life hanging out with you because I made Pepper a promise. I did it because I care about you and I know what it’s like losing someone important to you. I just didn’t want you to have to go through this alone.”
"Jesus, Stark, are you high?" Bucky asked, taken aback by Tony's behavior. Tony just raised an eyebrow and crossed his heart in a huff. "No, Barnes, it's just the first time I've ever actually been happy to see you. Now help me!"
“Do you think it has anything to do with Peggy leaving or the break up with Tony?” Bucky asked, before taking a sip of his drink.
“No, all that matters is that Bucky is a jerk,” Tony muttered as he crossed his arms in a huff. Steve just laughed and gave him a kiss to the temple before standing.
“No!” Tony sobbed. “No ‘but’. Please. Nothing has to change. I won’t buy you lavish gifts. I’ll do whatever you want. If you want to buy the ice cream when we go out next time, I’ll let you. Whatever you want, I will give it to you. I need you.”
Steve stood there, mouth agape, waiting for his brain to reboot. He didn’t know what it was that broke him: how gorgeous Tony was or how unimaginably smart he was. Either way, the last five minutes had done absolutely nothing to help quell the raging crush Steve had on the brunet. While he stood there, willing his legs to remember how walking worked, he felt something bump into him. He turned around to see what looked to be a robotic arm with wheels. It held a tennis ball and moved up and down, waiting for Steve to take it.
Steve just gave a weak smile and slowly nodded his head. That seemed to be enough for Coulson, as he turned and made his way back to his office. The second Coulson was gone, Steve stood and ran for the bathroom. He shot past Tony’s desk, only briefly noticing the look of concern on the alpha’s face. He wanted to stop to explain himself, but he knew he didn’t have enough time.
The transition from light pink to deep red happened almost instantaneously as Steve felt his face warm up. As awkward was it was for him to admit his feelings out loud, it felt good getting all of this off his chest.
Steve stood in front of the building, not able to tamp down the fear that he’d gotten the address wrong. But upon looking up and seeing the massive ‘STARK’ atop the building, he knew he was in the absolute right place. Stark Tower. Tony had asked him to come visit his workshop inside of
Later that night, once everyone made Bucky apologize at least five times, Steve and Tony found themselves laying on the couch, finally alone.
“Tony, we’re going to have a daughter. Natasha, Pepper and Carol are going to absolutely love this.”
“Listen, I knew if I told you beforehand, you’d put up a fight, but I don't want that, and deep down you know this is the best.”
“Wait, hold on,” Steve said, reaching out for Bucky’s arm, “last night you and Tony disappeared somewhere. What’d you say to him?”
“Hope you’re hungry, babe. I made your favorite for dinner… well, really someone else made it and I had it delivered.” Once Tony saw the bag from
A slight panic began to set in, until it dawned on him that he could turn to the internet for help. Right was Tony was about to push play on the
“Alright, Tony. Just… let’s get some rest okay?” Steve asked, forcing a smile. He knew Tony saw right through it, but the brunet just yawned returned his head to Steve’s chest.
“Look, I got your message loud and clear, Tony. I won’t be bothering you anymore. You don’t have to pretend that you want to be here for me or the baby. I’ll be just fine on my own.”
“You have to trust me, ok? There’s a good chance you’re not going to agree to go if I tell you where we’re going ahead of time, but just...trust me.”
. That’s not just pocket change, and I just… I can’t take something this expensive from you,” Steve said, softly placing the paint set on the living room table. The pair of them stood looking at each other for a moment. Tony genuinely couldn’t comprehend why Steve wouldn’t just take the gift. He
even though I knew they weren’t.” Tony ran his hands over his face. “There’s a pool? Like, a private pool for us.” Tony groaned, making to get off of Steve’s lap, but Steve just put his hands on Tony’s hips.
“Well, yeah. If I hadn't told him he would have found your gratuitous flirting tonight a little odd,” the redhead answered.
“Stevie, all we know how to do is be overprotective and embarrassing, you know that,” Natasha offered sweetly.
“Alrighty, here we are,” Steve said, pulling up to the drop-off area at the airport. When he found out how early Tony’s flight was, he’d offered to give him a ride. This was the first time since they’d started dating that they’d be spending such a long amount of time apart. Steve would be lying if he said not having Tony with him for Christmas didn't hurt, but he held on to the hope that they’d get to spend New Years Eve together just as they’d planned.
Steve stretched, as his alarm continued to wail. He sighed, realizing that his belly was now too big for him to be able to just reach an arm across his body to get to his phone. He pushed himself up into a sitting position on the bed, and leaned over to get the phone to turn off the alarm. He sat there for a moment, collecting himself before getting out of bed to shower. The day was meant to be a lazy day, what with it being Sunday and all, but Steve felt he still had so much to get done to ready his apartment for Mason’s arrival.
“Not to be rude Jarvis, but I know I need to give him a reason to leave the workshop. I just don’t know what that reason should be.”
“I can’t believe you did all of this just for me,” Tony marveled, taking a seat at the table. His mouth was watering at the smell of the food in front of him.
“So, are you just going to stand there or are you actually got to let me into your house?” The blond asked, lightheartedly.
Steve wanted to grab the paper to read just what his best friend had in store for Tony, but before he could move to do so, he felt his phone vibrate.
“As you know, I’ve been pregnant for five months now, and I’ve had a lot of time to think about the situation we’ve found ourselves in. Initially, when I found out we were having a baby, I was absolutely terrified, as I’m sure you were too. But over the last several months, it’s dawned on me that even though this isn’t the most conventional way of things happening, that maybe we were meant to be brought together by by this baby.”
“Please Tony, I...I need your knot...want to feel you swell inside me and...fill me up. Please, please please,” Steve cried.
Before he knew what he was doing, Tony sprang forward and pressed his lips to Steve’s. It was chaste, and didn’t last nearly as long as Tony would have liked, but it was more than he ever could have hoped for. When he opened his eyes, Steve sat in front of him, face redder than Captain American’s boots.
“… But after a while, he figured it out. So I’ve always known that this is who I am. However it took me until two hours ago to realize that I am attracted to you and that’s ok.”
He was scared, terrified, of what was to come, but he felt extremely alone. Steve hadn’t given much thought to what he imagined Mason’s birth to be like, but he knew he had never even considered it could be like this. Sitting in a room, seemingly unconscious yet aware of his surroundings, with no one around that he trusted, to tell him that everything would be okay. He heard the clambering of people, talking about anesthetics, and once he lost feeling in the lower half of his body, he knew it wouldn’t be long before Mason was here.
“There is chicken parmesan in this box, yes,” Steve answered without having to hear the whole question. Tony calmly let Coraline down, before practically tackling Steve, peppering kisses all over his face.
“Sure did! Boy, you should have seen the look on Peggy’s face when I led those men back to our camp!”
“No, Tony.” Pepper soothed, running her fingers through his greasy hair. She tried not to think about when the last time he showered was. “No, he wasn’t.”
“I’m really glad we did this, I’ve missed you lately,” Natasha spoke, moving to rest her head on Steve’s chest where they lay on the floor.
“Well I just think you should give him some space; let him figure things out. Then if that doesn’t work, just walk around shirtless until he can’t stand it anymore.”
Barton quietly grumbled, but stood to make his way towards the door. “Come on, Steve, let’s go before Principal Grumpasauras Rex loses it.”
“Not only did Tony Stark come in here tonight and spend the entire time chatting it up with Steve, but he left the man a $500 tip!”
All three friends sat in silence, Pepper and Rhodey clearly finding this funnier than Tony did. He sat there, full pout on his face, until Steve walked through the door.
The genuine look of sorrow on Steve’s face was enough to choke Pepper up. When he noticed how hard she was trying to fight back tears, he pulled out a seat for her. Before taking a seat himself he offered her his sandwich. After she politely declined, he took a seat and began to speak.
In the next moment, Tony slowly moved forward, breaching Steve’s rim and taking care to be as gentle as possible. He bottomed out in no time, and looked down to check in with his partner. Steve had the most beautiful expression on his face, the moment all discomfort from the intrusion gave way to sheer bliss. While giving Steve’s body a chance to adjust, Tony closed his eyes to take in everything he was feeling. The tight, slick warmth of Steve’s hole felt absolutely magnificent. Tony wanted nothing more than to stay here, like this, until the end of time. However, the deep, shuddering breath that Steve let out brought him back to the current moment. He opened his eyes to look down at his lover, to see Steve already panting.
Tony gently moved Coraline to the spot next to him and walked over to where Steve was pulling a huge, flat
left, and I refuse to just sit by and wait for the day that I’ll have to break Cora’s heart and tell her that you’ve left too. I might as well just cut all ties now while she’s young.”
He struggled to his feet, then turned to extend a hand to Steve who gladly accepted the help. Once back at the car, Tony pulled the blindfold out of his pocket. Steve just rolled his eyes before taking the blindfold and securing it himself. Tony ushered him into the car, helping him to fasten his seatbelt, then ran to get in. They made the rest of the drive hands intertwined and in silence, save for the sound of the heat blasting through the car.
Steve gave a sheepish nod at that. Sarah moved to take both of his hands in hers, looking her son in the eyes.
. There was a person growing inside of him and if nothing else, he owed it to this little baby to pull through.
“If you had been my teacher I’m sure I would have been far too distracted to actually learn anything about physics,” Steve muttered, apparently louder than he’d intended, if the laugh that Tony barked out was any indication.
He sat in silence for the entire ride, looking out the window to survey the world around him. Spring was coming soon, and even though it’d still be cold for a while in New York, things were starting to look a lot less cold and bleak. Tony genuinely loved this time of year, but now, with a baby to look forward to, things just seemed a little brighter.
As Steve continued to suck the cock in his mouth, he felt Tony’s hand in his hair; a signal that the alpha was close. He slowly pulled off, taking time to swirl his tongue around the head before letting the cock slip from his lips. Tony reached down, pulling Steve up towards him to lazily kiss him. The omega knew this was a ploy to give Tony a break, for him to cool his jets a little before they went any further, but Steve couldn’t wait. He took Tony in hand, and stroked a few times before lowering himself on the alpha’s cock. Both men let out a low moan as Steve continued to take more of Tony in until he was fully seated.
they’re not true. I should have never doubted you or your character for a second, and I just hope you can accept my apology.”
“Yeah, ‘that’. I am curious to find out why you thought you needed to go through all of this corporate espionage to steal something you don’t even know how to use.”
It was then that they saw Coraline answer Steve’s phone that had been on the table. “Hi mommy,” she exclaimed. “It’s Ony’s burfday and we’re openin’ presents!” Her face twisted into one of confusion and she toddled over to Steve and Tony. “Mommy wants ta talk to yew.”
When Howard finally came to get me, Jarvis let me keep the sweater. I held on to it for a really long time, even after I grew into it, but after that oversized sweaters have always reminded me of that day. If I ever feel like shit, I’ll just throw on a massive sweater and it makes everything suck just a tiny bit less.”
“All it takes is some detailed searching to find out about who you are, or rather, who your family is. You and Steve apparently hated each other a year ago, and now he’s pregnant with your baby. That doesn’t seem a little suspect to you at all?”
With that the two of them wolfed down their breakfast, only stopping once all of the food was gone. Once they put their plates in the sink, they stood in the kitchen, now unsure of what to do next.
"We’ll definitely be revisiting that statement,” Tony continued, narrowing his eyes, “But 2. The fact that anything of mine fits you, specifically, is all kinds of sexy. Just the combination of you wearing something of mine that's only purpose is to make me feel less shitty...I don't know, it just revs my engines, I guess.”
“Please Tony, do tell me, when exactly is the right time to just say ‘hey by the way my dad’s--and my--name is on the side of a building and I’m loaded. Hurr hurr hurr’?”
The museum always seemed bring Steve out of whatever he was dealing with in his day to day life. Being around so many magnificent pieces was almost therapeutic for him in a way, and this trip was no exception. Steve found himself meandering longer than usually, realizing that he really needed this, needed to be in a place that genuinely felt good for his soul.
“Well, you seem to have a handle on things so we’re just gonna head out. But if you need anything just call us, we won’t be too far,” Natasha said, going in for a half hug.
“You didn’t. You’re a concerned friend, and I appreciate you giving me your opinion…Do you mind if I ask a favor of you?”
what that thing was. It seemed to be an important part of Tony’s life so that's all that mattered. This thing in Tony’s chest was as big a deal to Steve as Bucky’s metal arm; that is to say, Steve never gave much attention to either because it just seemed those things weren't defining factors to him. If Tony ever wanted to open up about the object in his chest, Steve would be ready to listen, but until then, he had no intention of looking any further into it.
He stopped to think about what Steve just said. He’d been down in the workshop for an entire day, which wasn’t out of the norm. However, he’d barely gotten anything accomplished because he was doing more hiding than he was working. He hadn’t seen or spoken to anyone since Pepper had left him, and he still didn’t want to interact with anyone. But there Steve was, with food that smelled delicious, and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t starving.
“Definitely...now are you guys ready to see the baby and find out what you’re having?” Bruce asked, eager to get the attention off of himself.
“Alright, look, I’ll see what I can find out for you but I don’t want you to get your hopes up. Thinking someone is attractive and wanting to be in a legitimate relationship are two completely different things. So just be prepared for this to not go exactly the way you hope.”
Tony carried the two glasses into the living room—their living room—and looked around. This was their house. Garish floor to ceiling windows and overpriced furniture littered the place, along with all of the new toys Cora had gotten for Christmas. There were still a few unpacked boxes from when Steve had moved in the week before, but that didn’t matter. Tony had never felt more at home anywhere in his entire life.
Tony waved him off. “It’s okay, honestly, Steve. I get it. Thanks for hearing me out, and I guess I’ll see you around.”
Tony sealed his statement with a kiss to the omega’s temple and suddenly, Steve felt a calm come over him. Moments later, he felt a strange sensation over his lower stomach, then a lot of tugging. Tony’s hold on his hand became tighter as time went on, but suddenly, his hold loosened, and he seemingly shifted.
Tony could see the exact moment that it all clicked for Howard. The thought had never crossed his mind that Tony could do with the company what he wanted in once Howard was gone. Truth be told, the thought had never really occurred to Tony, either. But once he saw that look on his father’s face, he knew he’d found a way to win.
“Ok, go ahead and finish your story,” she prompted in an effort to keep Tony from staying stuck on that fact for too long.
Steve laughed as he gently punched Tony’s shoulder, and both men froze at the contact. It wasn’t the first time they had touched; it was just the first time they had done so in a friendly situation. A blush began to creep its way onto Steve’s face, and for some reason it made Tony smile. Thankfully, he realized that he was grinning like an idiot before Steve’s eyes rested on him again. In the interest of making the current silence a little less awkward, Tony raised the IPod in between them.
Thirteen weeks. That's how long Steve and Tony spend day in and day out waking up, spending hours on end watching as their daughter grew healthy enough and strong enough to come home. It was hard, knowing at the end of each day they would go home together, having to leave the one thing that made them feel whole, behind.
"Hey," Steve spoke, slightly waddling out to kitchen, "Is everything ok? You seem like you've had something on your mind lately."
“No, just the once,” Steve answered in a small voice, pulling his knees to his chest to make himself as small as possible.
Tony recalled their last encounter: he was 21 and had stormed out of a nightclub after catching Ty hanging off of some social climber. Ty had tried to sweet talk him, but Tony knew all of the promises to change, to treat him better, to
Dinner was a fairly painless ordeal with only one spilled juice, until chocolate cake was thrown at Steve.
The blond really thought that he had conquered his initial fears about this pregnancy up until the day that he was cornered by Pepper on his way back to his office.
Cora excitedly skipped into Steve’s room, where they all changed. Everyone knew that Cora would be dressed as a chicken nugget, but it wasn’t until all three of them walked out that everyone realized that Steve and Tony were going dressed as hipster versions of Ronald McDonald and the Hamburglar. The whole apartment erupted with laughter as they walked out of the room, holding Cora’s hand. Not only did her costume turn out perfectly, but they added a little bow, to make her look extra adorable.
As they looked over the food offerings, Steve still relishing in just how hilarious the shocked look on Bucky’s face was, Tony felt this electric buzzing feeling just under his skin. He’d been open and honest with Steve today in a way that he’d never been with anyone else, not in such a short amount of time anyway. Steve had remembered his drink of choice, and brought it to him to avoid having to explain himself to anyone else. He’d shared Tony with his best friends, and enjoyed the way they teased one another.
“Listen, you’re going to be here for a whole two weeks. I would much rather you hold off on being an insufferable brat at least until closer to the end of your trip.”
“Pepper, I am so over this,” Tony huffed, exasperated, as he dropped his backpack by the table before falling onto the couch. Pepper was a sophomore and a year ahead of him. She had a nice suite on campus; the exact opposite Tony’s twelve-by-twelve concrete box of a dorm room.
“It’s kind of an inside joke we have. The day he invited me to this thing, it was pretty cold out so he let me borrow his scarf. Every day since, he’s let me borrow it on our way to lunch, but it seems like he only has one. I figured if I gave him another one he could wear that one so we could both keep warm,” Steve answered thinking back on the past few days, with a fond smile.
“It’s good to see you again, Tony,” Bruce spoke, gesturing for the alpha to take a seat, “how have you been?”
Tony smiled at Peter, wondering how he ever got so lucky as to have such a great student in his life. “Well, kid, it’s still pretty weird to have your help with any of this, but I appreciate it all the same. Now, Bruce,” Tony said, clapping Bruce on the shoulder, “I’m going to need your help putting this whole plan together.”
Natasha’s eyes lit up at that! She looked at Steve and shot him a smile that conveyed more excitement than he’d ever seen from her.
much self reflection), until now. However, realizing that Pepper was right and that he, in fact, did have a thing for Steve, was something Tony just couldn’t handle.
Tony continued eating, taking a few more bites of his food before addressing his friend’s statement.
“Thanks,” Steve offered, trying to keep his heart from beating out of his chest as their fingers brushed.
Steve stood aside to let Pepper in. He suddenly became very aware of how much of a mess both he and his place were. He quickly tried to pick up what he could, as Pepper made her way to the living room couch. “Can I get you anything to drink: water, tea, coffee?”
reality. Tony is it for you, okay? You don’t get two Tony’s in life. People are fucking lucky if they get one, you hear? You’ve made a dumbass mistake letting him go and I’m going to need you to get your head out of your ass and realize that before it’s too late.”
“Meant for what, exactly, hm?” the blond asked, now rising to his feet, “ for being a father, a husband or for being loved?”
“Great question, Ty! It was a matter of just connecting to that bot. Since I had no clue the code was stolen, I didn’t have JARVIS looking out for any new machines to connect to. Thank you, by the way, for pointing out that glaring oversight. From now on, I’ll have JARVIS constantly checking for new machines running my code.”
“You’re a stubborn bastard and an asshole a good portion of the time, but you are a good person, Tony. You’re kind hearted and you look out for others. You put your heart and soul into the things you care about.”
"Why didn't you say anything," Tony asked, not even trying to hide the defeat he felt finding out his secret wasn't a secret at all.
Once in Steve’s living room, Tony tried to take in all of what he had just learned. Coraline, “Cora” as Steve affectionately called her, was Steve and Peggy’s year and a half old daughter. They’d decided after their junior prom that they wanted to lose their virginities to someone special, but thanks to a lack of any real planning in terms of birth control, Peggy ended up getting pregnant. They’d both taken a year off between high school and college, which explained why Steve was nineteen at the start of his freshman year.
“Hey there, Bug. I’m not sure if you heard but Steve and I have come up with a name for you, are you ready? You’re gunna be named Mason Alexander, if you’re a boy, and Mason Alexandra if you’re a girl. I suppose you already know that which name applies, but we’ll find out soon enough!” Tony whispered, rubbing Steve’s belly gently.
“No, it’s ok. I’ve been so blessed with the family that I have in my ma and my friends so it hasn’t been anything that’s really bothered me much. I just always figured I’d be alone. Then you come along and it’s like my whole world was turned upside down. I hadn’t even thought about what could happen when we first met. Thinking about it now, I don’t see how we didn’t figure this out sooner,” the blond gave a small laugh at that.
“I appreciate what you’re doing, but at this rate it might take another year before we’re both finally naked,” Tony gingerly moved Steve off of him in order to stand to undress himself.
he thought. Steve just offered a smile, now noticing the somewhat worried look on Tony’s face as they began walking towards the parking lot.
As the pair of them walked, the omega began to feel his heart race, trying to determine what they could possibly have to discuss. The second they got to his office and shut the door, Pepper took a seat, waiting patiently for Steve to sit as well, before she began.
Tony took in all that Steve was telling him. He wasn’t sure whether to find some of these things absolutely terrifying or unreasonably adorable. He settled for some strange combination of both once he realized he had zoned out and was missing vital information.
But those closest to him, those who recognized that tone as a defense mechanism knew that something was up.
“It’s been coming down pretty hard for a while, apparently. I just can't believe I wasn't the only one working so hard I didn't notice.”
Tony froze instantly at the question. No one but Bruce knew that Tony had held on to Steve’s apartment key after their break up. Initially, he’d blamed the high tension and emotions for his forgetfulness. However, once confronted with the reality that he needed to give back the key, Tony conveniently managed to leave the key at home every chance he got. He didn’t want to admit it, but he secretly hoped there would be a reason for him to use it. Though he knew that hope was far fetched, he still couldn’t bring himself to part with the key.
Tony took a deep breath at that and felt a mix of fear and pride. He was going to get to see his baby for the first time, and if that wasn’t incentive enough for him to push through all of this, Tony didn’t know what was.
Tony threw the idea around for a bit, wondering if Steve would even be interested in hanging out with him outside of work.
“I’m sure your friends have been trying their best to help, but I know Tony better than anyone, and I really think you deserve to have the full picture before you decide if you want him out of your life.”
“I wish I could say that I was, but I’ve still got to figure out a more permanent solution to daycare for Cora while I’m in class,” Steve answered walking into the supply closet that also served as the employee coat room.
“Is that...Steve is that all? That’s really nothing for you to be worried about,” Natasha offered, hoping to calm the blond.
Somehow, it had never occured to Tony that how quickly they won their matches would have a significant impact on anything, let alone on the bots themselves. His mind was suddenly swimming with new ideas and possibilities. “If I pull up the clips, could you point out the instances where we could have scored and how we could have done a better job?”
“Don’t forget to take protection, Stevie,” Bucky teased, trying to keep a straight face. “STDs are real and despite what you might think, you

“Well everything good in my life gets taken from me, and Pepper’s no different. I did a lot of things I’m not proud of before this came along…”
“Holy shit, that’s absolutely insane!” the alpha yelled, now taking both hands and placing them on Steve’s belly in an attempt to feel any more movement.
Steve froze immediately, realizing who was standing right behind him. Without looking, he began to stumble through an apology.

Tony stood there, shaking, as Howard walked out, a pleased smile on his face no doubt. He wanted to yell, tell his sorry excuse for a father that he was full of nothing shit and that Steve was twice the man and father he could ever be.

It was only a matter of time, though, before Tony realized that the only thing his ex-boyfriend loved was his money.
It seemed as if time stopped at that moment. All Tony wanted was to hear something, anything, from his friends. Yet, minute after painful minute went by with nothing but silence filling the air.
Tony scrunched his nose and swatted her hand away, causing Nat to laugh. They sat there in silence for a moment before she stood. “You still have a chance, you know. Don’t give up just yet,” she said before walking out of the room.
“I’ve never heard so much silence coming from any of you in my life, so either something big happened or you’ve all just died standing up,” Natasha spoke, as she came into the front of the bar. Upon taking in the faces of all three men, her demeanor became more serious.
