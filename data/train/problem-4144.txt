Two months. He hasn’t had a heat in two months. No. No way. Just stress. Stress fucks with your system. Messes up your cycles. That’s all this is.
Suddenly aware that he’s been staring at Cas’ mouth for what is probably a creepy amount of time, and that his “loaf around the house” pajama pants leave
FUCK. What am I gonna do? Everything is suddenly too much, and he slides down against the bathroom wall, head in his hands. Tears fall down his face, splattering on the tile. Sobs wrack his body as he gives into the need to cry out his fears. He thought himself a fuck up before, but this is a whole new level. He isn’t just responsible for himself now, he has a child. A child that will need him to get his shit together and stop feeling sorry for himself on the hard bathroom floor. He blows his nose in a wad of toilet paper, splashes cold water on his face, and drinks from his cupped hands. Blowing out a breath, he strips and slides under his pile of blankets. His hands automatically move to his stomach, gently rubbing circles over the sleeping inhabitant. In the quiet, he whispers:
Then it doesn’t matter if we buy these. They’ll be negative, and then we can go drink ourselves stupid one night to unwind.
When Michael comes in for lunch, he can tell something is wrong. Dean takes his break and fills him in on the day he’s had so far.
“What are we doing now,” Dean asks. He hadn’t been looking for perfume, as he’s pretty sure that’s more along the lines of a spouse gift than a loving brother gift. He watches as Castiel selects a bottle and a little white card. He sprays the card, waves it around, and holds it out to Dean.
feel, however, is restless. Knowing that he needs to settle his mind, (and his libido,) before attempting to start his grading, he goes upstairs to change into his running clothes.
! I’ve heard of ‘leaf green’ or ‘grass green’ eyes, but I’d never seen them until he opened his eyes this afternoon. Must have gotten them from Dean.”
“Look, Dean. This was never going to be a long-term thing. I was only here on assignment. Now, my assignment is up and I’m going home.” Checking through the drawers and closet, Michael zips his garment bag. He removes his shaving kit from the ensuite, places it in his last open duffel, and zips it closed.
He pulls out his phone to check his list for the stores he wants to check out. The more organized he is, the less time he spends dithering and stressed out, and the more time he gets to enjoy the holidays. He compares the list with the map and decides to start at the farthest end and make his way back.
Cas’ hands are busy pulling Dean’s jeans and boxers down just far enough to free his cock. Still maintaining eye contact (
Jimmy laughs, thinking about Gabe’s insane amount of confidence and charisma, and the number of “friends” he was always bringing home. “He thinks he is. You’d like him. Well, first you’d probably want to punch him in the face. He’s a bit much for some people. Including those of us that grew up with him." He can't count the number of times they'd all come to blows when they were young.
Turns out that Michael wasn’t trying to buy Dean’s time tonight. He’s gone when the last call is made, but Dean finds a crisp hundred-dollar bill folded up with a business card for Michael A. Milton in his tip jar, personal cell phone number neatly printed on the back.
He'd heard Cas come home last night, when he had turned on his own shower. That was one of the curses to living in these older buildings, the noisy plumbing. He'd been in the middle of a
“We. Where are we going? I’m going to crash with a friend. You’re going to Bobby’s.” Dean doesn’t trust John not to take his anger out on Sammy once he wakes up, and he’ll be damned if he’s going to take the chance. Odds are good he’ll find couch space somewhere. If not, Baby’s backseat is plenty comfortable. It takes Dean less than fifteen minutes to grab what he considers essential, Sam takes less than that, and they’re out. He’s still got a few hours before his lunch shift, and he’s in no shape to deal with people right now, so he heads to the library after dropping Sammy off at the bus stop.
Two things happen simultaneously. Dean turns the key to start the car, and he presses the brake pedal. There's a loud pop, and blue, green, and gold glitter explodes all over Dean and Baby's once-immaculate interior.
If anyone said that Dean Winchester basically skipped out to the parking lot, they were dirty rotten liars.
Gabe thinks. Gently, he removes the swaddling. He’s never seen, much less held, something so small. “Aren’t you sweet? You look like a jelly bean. Wait, has omega Daddy even named you yet? I don’t think he’s really gotten a chance yet, has he?” The baby just looks at him, as if to say;
Dean smiles. “Nope. No girlfriend. No boyfriend, either. Just me, the perpetually single brother.” If this guy is going to fish, Dean’s going to stock the pond. Why make it harder?
Cas and Sam spend the weekend in Denver, taking a day tour through the Rocky Mountain National Park, trying out a zip-line, and ending their mini vacation with a haunted pub tour. Dean spends Saturday sulking and Sunday in his underwear catching up on his Netflix queue. On the nightstand, his phone pings.
"I was wondering why you're trying your damnedest to work yourself into bed rest? Why aren't any of your friends helping you? Where's your family?" Jimmy doesn't bother mentioning the person who put Dean in this position to begin with. Dean's never mentioned the baby's alpha parent, and Jimmy's not going to bring it up.
Cheeks chipmunked out, he nods his head quickly, trying to wash down a large amount of burger with a swig of his beer. He wipes his hands on his jeans and holds one out. “I’m Jimmy, and I think this place has ruined me for all other burgers.” Jimmy’s got a good grip, strong without trying to crush Dean’s hand. If they hold on a little longer than is considered normal, it doesn’t seem to bother them.
The only downside to Dean's Christmas-palooza? His near obsession with finding That Perfect Gift™ for each person on his list. Some years were simple, and he managed everyone with minimal fuss. Other years, he was grateful that he started hunting in October. Those are the years that he's glued to his phone, watching as the package tracker gets closer and closer to his house.
After a bit of cleanup, Dean is on the sofa while Cas gets them some water from the kitchen. He comes back with two glasses and the gift bag he’d brought. He hands it and a glass to Dean before taking his own seat. Excitedly, Dean tears into the bag. “Oh man, I can’t wait to see-”
nice mental scenario starring his hot neighbor sprawled in a desk chair, pants open, shirt pushed up under his armpits, biting on his own tie as he stared down at Dean as he swallowed around Cas' cock. So if
Another week passes before the proverbial shit hits the fan. The semester is ending, which means finals, which means that if Dean’s not working, he’s studying. His finals and Sammy’s midterms coincide, and neither of them have done much (any) housework that wasn’t strictly necessary. The laundry is done, the trash is taken out, it’s livable even if it’s not fit for Better Homes and Gardens. Everyone’s clean and fed, but that doesn’t satisfy John. It’s early on another Saturday morning when Dean’s jerked (literally) from his bed and onto the floor.
more of their conversation fixated on his mouth than his eyes? Which were, of course, just as breathtaking as the rest of him. He should feel like a creep. What he
“I’m sorry I expected you to treat me like a human being and tell me about things that have a direct impact on me! Did it ever occur to you that I’m going to need time to get a place?”
"Pie and beer? How cheap do you think I am? Don't answer that." Dean relieves Cas of his burdens and heads back to the kitchen. There's ice cream in the freezer, and it's almost sacrilege to eat pie without it.
It was an hour before the mall closed up, and Castiel was swamped. He was looking forward to a beer and a few hours with his editing software before calling it a night. His last shoot had yielded some excellent results, and he was itching to tweak the dozen or so images he had selected.
To his credit, it only took Cas a moment to collect himself after Dean’s display. “Sorry, Dean. With a name like mine, one has to look for humor.” Cas grins, and Dean is about 100000% sure that he’s in trouble. Cas is attractive even all rumpled and straight-faced, but add the grin? That grin is dangerous. It promises things that Dean
“I’d say here’s my spare key. When do you get off?” He almost throws the key at Dean in his haste to slide it to him.
The package had arrived two days after he ordered it, complete with a list of suggested uses and installation instructions. He waited until Sam and Dean went to bed, then crept to the garage. Armed with a flashlight and the package, he apparated into Baby's pristine front seat and went to work. In less than 15 minutes he was done and back in his room.
“Whatever, Gabriel. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Right now, there’s a hot shower and a cold beer calling me. Send me more pictures tomorrow.”
When he argued it, John told him to man-up or get the fuck out, knowing full well that Dean would never leave Sam. Not while he still had two more years of high school to get through. Dean knows that Sam’s out as soon as he’s got his high school diploma in hand. He’s already researching schools as far from John as he can get. They’ve talked about it, started making plans. Half of Dean’s salary goes into a separate account for relocating them. It’s going to be rough, but they’ll manage.
“Whenever I want, as often as I can.” Dean picks up the key and pockets it with a wink. “Break’s over, gotta head back.”
When he walks into Dean’s rooms, he notices that Dean’s patio door is ajar, and he smiles at the way it mirrors the last time this happened. He quietly checks on (sleeping!) Jimmybean then takes a seat in one of the armchairs in Dean’s sitting area. He doesn’t have to wait long before Dean comes inside.
“Oh fuck yes, Cas. Gonna fuck you so good, baby. Can’t wait to be inside you, split you open on my cock, fill you up-”
Because he’s a stubborn bastard on the best of days, Dean’s loaded down with bulging plastic bags. No, Sammy, he’s not gonna carry his own reusable bags. A guy that drives a car older than himself doesn’t exactly have his mind fixated on his carbon footprint. He pointedly ignores Sammy’s voice in his head saying that’s exactly why he should be concerned with his carbon footprint. By the time he gets inside, he’s gotta tap a kidney something fierce. He debates leaving the tests in their package, just to be an asshole. Considering the only one that’ll bother is him, he grabs the box and dashes into the bathroom for the second time today.
“Same. You gonna be here for a while?” Dean would like to talk to him more, but duty calls and customers don’t tip for slow service, no matter how hot the bartender or how firm his ass.
Cas had had one of those days where he was reminded of why he became an educator. Even though it was the last day before a four-day weekend, his kids had been engaged, focused, and most importantly to him, kind to each other. Teens aren’t always as self-absorbed and oblivious as people like to think they are, especially in these days of social media. He knew that some of his students had burdens that would flatten many adults he knew. He worked hard to keep his classroom a safe haven, and today was one of the days that he felt he had succeeded.
“Shit, Cas. You’re killing me here. I gotta-let me-” Dean runs his arms up into Cas shirt, pushing it up as he goes. Cas releases his neck long enough to let Dean pull his shirt over his head, before leaning forward to claim his mouth again. He grips the hem of Dean’s t-shirt, releasing his mouth in favor of the expanse of exposed skin before him.
Suddenly, it's much quieter than it has been. Sam just assumes that each man went to their separate corners to fume in peace. He shrugs to himself and continues reading.
Not getting them, although that's pretty great. Dean loves giving presents. He's one of those “it's better to give, than to receive” types, and at Christmas, he can get away with giving more than he can the rest of the year. His family learned years ago that it's futile to try and reign him in. He needs this. Dean's not always great with words and feelings, so he shows his affection with gifts.
Dean thinks Castiel is trying to kill him, that’s what he thinks. He’s sprayed the card with the same cologne he’s wearing, and Dean’s going to have to go be alone for a moment if he doesn’t get a hold of himself, fast. “Um...good. Yeah, it smells really good. Not sure if it’s right for me though.”
“Don’t apologise,” the angel interrupted, turning around to place the bag in the basket, avoiding eye contact. “Honestly, I’ve never known anyone to say sorry as frequently as you do. You hadn’t even done anything wrong.”
felt more like a statement. Dean felt like flipping a table or some shit because, sure, from Dean's perspective he had been charmed in a way, but it wasn't anything like what Bobby was alluding to; and regardless, it had nothing to do with what Dean had offered as an argument. He knew damn well he had sound reasoning behind defending Cas - reasoning that sure as shit had nothing to do with his stupid little crush - and it was fucking frustrating to have all that overlooked purely because Bobby wasn't willing to listen.
“Well, my dad told me about the angels that he’d met and the powers they had, so I was wondering if all angels had the same powers or not,” he lied. He wasn’t ignorant enough to think that every angel would be an exact copycat in terms of their abilities, but he’d found that one of the only ways he got a decent answer was to seem fairly ignorant. It was lame, yes, but in this situation especially, he wanted a good answer.
He couldn't hurt the boy, but the boy could hurt him! By accepting the deal, he'd given the demon fucking
"If this is going to be yet another apology, then I suggest you don't finish that sentence," Castiel interrupted, resting back on his hands as the warmth of the morning sun washed over him.
Dean smiled, gently taking hold of the clothing before taking a step back to clear the doorway, trying not to think about how similar it was to the first time they'd met. "Well, they don't look all that pathetic," he insisted when Cas stepped inside, closing the door behind them. "More impressive than a shadow."
"My ... my uncle's dog knocked me down earlier," Dean started, his face burning hotter. "He's, uhhh ... he's sorta big and I wasn't really ... yeah."
So, maybe Dean didn't know everything about angels, and it was kinda naive of him to underestimate Castiel like that, but still. Cas had given him no reason to be worried and right now he actually preferred the thought of staying with Cas than he did Bobby.
He hadn't really expected time to creep up on them like that, bringing them way closer to the halfway point.
Not that it was any of Dean's business. That's why he hadn't asked about the content of the angel's nightmares either. Castiel was under no obligation to tell him anything, and for all Dean knew, it could have been a pretty sore subject. Even addressing it now was somewhat risky, but he was desperate to show that he was just as willing to listen to Castiel's problems as the angel was willing to listen to his.
Also, I apologise for how late this update is. I had an art exam I had to prepare for, and knowing me I left all the work till last minute.
He looked off to the side when the angel's gaze softened, aware of how Castiel was effectively analyzing him, and he turned away completely, rubbing at the back of his neck. His dad had never said it was a
A few days ago, he'd ventured back to the site of the werewolf attack. Most of the homes had been taped up and he'd had to wait around till late in the evening before he could easily evade the police stationed there, but once it got quiet, he was able to do what he probably should have considered the first time around.
"I'm surprised, actually," Castiel started, measuring up the width of the bandage against his fingers as the demon moved behind him again. "The demons I know definitely don't see my kind as 'wise' or anything of the sort."
“I didn’t know if that actually applied to …” He gestured toward Castiel weakly. “Whatever this is.”
He felt the mattress dip again slightly, and he steadied his breathing, slowly pulsing energy around the inflamed flesh of his stomach.
But it wasn't just the conversations and the lack of hunting that Dean liked. He missed that temporary freedom of essentially getting to do everything he wanted.
for it, but he knew why the guy hadn't accepted it and that was totally reasonable. He just thought it slightly ridiculous that Castiel would turn down a meal when he'd clearly said that diet affected the power of his Grace.
The roads surrounding his route back were virtually barren, scarce patches of dirt that gradually developed into grasslands and forests, a calm and serene travel. But there were few – if any – cars headed in the direction in which he came, although they weren’t necessarily heading toward that town in particular. Even if they were, it would only alert the police should they still remain unaware. Everything would be reported back ahead of his arrival anyway, ensuring him of his pay.
In a way, he was relatively grateful his Grace had been cut off, solely because it bought him more time. If he understood the situation correctly, the demon would wait for him to be fully healed before they even started the procedure, and Castiel would have been fed something genuinely beneficial to his health. Right now, even though he was exhausted and weary, his Grace would still be growing stronger from a lack of use, so perhaps there was a way to overcome the spells cast on his restraints. As soon as those were off - most importantly the collar - he could be out and back home within a few minutes of such an occurrence.
It wasn't like Dean had really had anything to hide though. He and Cas had mostly spoken through calls, and Dean hadn't exactly been raving about the angel in his messages to Sam. No, after the way the kid had ripped into him the last time Dean had mentioned Castiel in conversation, Dean didn't plan on ever talking about Cas again, still feeling kinda embarrassed about name-dropping the guy so many times.
"I'm guessing you'd prefer to walk to the bathroom," he assumed lightly, recalling just how unsteady Cas had been the past few times Dean had transported him anywhere. Obviously, it was kinda lazy to want to teleport now, but if Cas was gonna be sick, he should probably get there as quickly as possible.
"But do you think you'll be able to heal someone who's got an illness, not an injury?" He pressed, crossing his legs as he turned his body fully toward the angel. "Would that be more difficult or what?"
There was stuff like the collar that sort of countered the argument of a charm, along with the fact that Cas probably wouldn't have bothered with the whole healing Sam thing if he could avoid it, and that did give him a sense of relief. Of course, there was a brief moment where Castiel
He raised a hand to pull the fabric away from the skin, grimacing a little at how clingy it was. He didn't really understand why it had started bleeding
Dean tried to relax, drawing in a sharp breath. "You said ... dad had made some stupid decisions," he began, still failing to completely reign in his anger. "Do you agree that the whole bleeding thing was wrong?"
And suddenly he found himself upstairs again, his vision blurring as the heat pulsed at his temples and his chest tightened. He keeled over as he tried to regulate his breathing, reaching blindly in front of him in an attempt to find something he could rest his full weight against and jolting when Castiel's hands enveloped both wrists.
Castiel wanted to scream. He wanted to cancel the deal solely so he could smash the demon’s fucking face in, because he didn’t care if the boy was putting it on or not, or even if the demon was giving up everything. Castiel was
It was cowardly, in a way, for John to give Dean the responsibility for something so important, but at least this way Sam had actually been healed. If their dad had gotten his way and Cas had died, then there'd be three deaths as a consequence, and ultimately, it would have been the stupidest outcome of the whole thing.
"They turned gold?" Dean asked, and the angel smiled a little wider, though it wasn't anywhere near as bright as Dean wanted it to be.
"Good," Dean voiced, watching as Sam shuffled back along the mattress, his face lighting up when he outstretched his arms, almost like he'd been too distracted to notice his better health before. "I'll be back in a couple of minutes, alright?"
"Yeah. Mom's turned sort of grey, so obviously she didn't really have to try and conceal them at all, but dad couldn't do much to hide the colour until around the time I was born. Not that he really needed to," Castiel added. "Only my mom was working up until that point, but he wanted to get work to help out with the bills. And the contacts stopped humans from thinking him a freak I guess."
It was best not to think about it. He didn’t really commune with demons, and in return, they didn’t bother him. Not unless Crowley had thought it amusing to situate both of their hunts in the same location.
Castiel pressed call without much thought, bringing the phone up to his ear, listening to the few rings that followed. He couldn't help but smile when the call picked up and a timid 'hello?' was murmured into the mouthpiece.
"No, I ..." Castiel could feel the flush creep up the back of his neck. "Dean, you're about as cute as an elephant seal."
The halls were surprisingly darker on the upper level, thick drapery hanging over the dust-covered windows with only the slimmest bars of light hitting the hard, wood panels of the floor. It was grimier once they reached the top of the stairs, the illusion of wealth dispersing as Dean’s shadow dragged over the sticky, rotten oak. It also smelled a lot worse, almost as if there was more than just house degradation thickening the air.
"Is it Cas?" Sam asked brightly, amusement clear in his tone. Dean shoved at the kid's face with his free hand in retaliation.
The demon looked down to it, taking a step back and holding up his hands. "No, no - it's fine. You finish reading it first."
The angel’s eyes opened a little, a sneer on his lips, "Really concerned about the whole blood loss situation, huh?"
"It's not that bad," Dean insisted, bracing his hands on the edge of the counter. "I do it out of love."
Dean sat close beside him on the cushions, his expression softening despite the blatant panic in his eyes. “You’re safe here, Cas. Don’t worry.”
He could see that Castiel's eyes had turned blue again, if not a little lighter in colour, and he wondered if that's how hunters could tell what he was. It was subtle, sure, but for someone who constantly analysed everything - especially when they'd been trained to be wary of everyone - the whole turning purple thing was probably a bit more obvious.
But Castiel didn't really change the way he acted. He didn't even seem to care that Dean had been approached in the first place, and it wasn't like Cas had ever shied away from asking questions in the past. Dean didn't see why him being drunk would have made much difference in a situation like that.
“It doesn’t matter,” he announced solemnly. “So long as you feel prepared to head out now, I can give you the general location of the nest.”
For a brief second, he swore he could see the boy grin, before the demon vanished completely with a sooty outline replacing his figure, and Castiel crashed to the floor, throwing out his arm so he didn’t land on his knife. The weight returned to his spine, his arms pulled back and his wrists locked together by some kind of spell as the boy placed a palm on Castiel’s left shoulder blade, keeping him pressed to the ground.
something, and he jolted back just in time to avoid being headbutted by the angel again, Castiel drawing in a sharp breath before he was curling in on himself and letting out some sort of strangled, choke-like noise.
Dean huffed out a light laugh briefly just thinking about it, running his hand down his face and setting his book to the side.
Castiel had been putting it off for a while so the pile of damaged items had begun to spill out of the crate where everything was kept. His main issue was just how little he actually had left to wear that didn't need washing, but that was an issue for another day, preferably where it would be easier for him to wash things in the spring.
It was a struggle: choosing whether or not he should start healing immediately over numbing the area itself. It was apparent that Bobby had passed out from the agony and Castiel wasn’t ready to bear the brunt of such a thing when he was barely even halfway through the entire healing process. The actual pain he was feeling through the man wasn’t like anything he’d actually experienced before, and it varied considerably from the sensations he’d encountered whilst healing Sam, open wounds aside. There was a heat to it that had him squirming in his seat, his breathing restricted as he absorbed the damage. The energy was unusually heavy in his veins and he ceased the healing abruptly, pushing away in an attempt to stand.
Castiel tried to make himself believe that the sick feeling he had in his stomach was caused by anger and not fear, a frown pulling tight on his lips. Once more, he didn't reply, ashamed for feeling as utterly unprepared as he did. He'd been thinking about this call for
He kept his shadow drifting around the base of the couch just in case. Whilst it wouldn't be much use against Cas if he was still super feverish, it would at least prevent Rufus from trying to fucking shoot him.
Dean wiped the tears brimming in his eyes, striding back out into the hallway so he could take as many towels from the laundry closet as possible, heading back downstairs as soon as he was able.
Castiel rolled his eyes, dropping his shirt to pick up the antiseptic wipe again, looking over his shoulder as he started to clear the blood from his skin. “It’s pretty fucking obvious what I’m doing,” he ground out, hissing when he added a bit too much pressure to the nearest gash.
"Oh, shit! I'm so sorry!" Dean blundered, snapping his fingers to make the silver band disappear. "It didn't weaken your Grace or anything, did it?"
But then again, Castiel had just shot him. That wasn’t exactly a relaxing experience, no matter how well his captor seemed to be coping with it.
Honestly, he wouldn't be surprised if the bleeding process was less painful. He really didn't know how to cope with everything wrong with him right now but he wanted to get it over as soon as he fucking could.
Castiel wasn’t going to go against the demon’s wants despite having the opportunity to do so now. He didn’t want to breach the trust the boy had in him.
There were flashes of light around him, but he willed shards of metal to develop in the air above his fresh wounds, squinting through the brightness as the creature beside his feet let out a gargled shriek from the impact; and he kicked one final time, dragging himself away as the grasp was relinquished altogether.
mind me asking that kind of question?” Dean followed up, and Castiel met his line of sight for a brief few seconds before turning toward the display again.
Dean didn't want to believe it was fake anyway. Not when he'd finally have the chance to talk to someone whenever he wanted - someone who (hopefully) wouldn't mind listening to his bullshit problems when he got too worked up to keep everything bottled away.
finally got a minute to doodle a thing for this fic again. if I have time I might draw little things more regularly - especially when I get further along in the story bc there are SO MANY THINGS I want to draw for future chapters
"Fuck off!" Castiel snarled, lashing out once more, and this time Dean rose to his feet, scuffing back and grabbing the med kit as he went to leave.
Dean swung his legs over the side of the bed to stand when Bobby went to leave the room. "You okay with me hanging here til you're back, or do you genuinely need the help?"
But Castiel was rubbing at his eyes, looking like he wasn't quite as at ease with his symptoms as he was making out to be, and Dean touched at his shoulder to grab his attention, anxious to find out what exactly had caused Cas to almost
Maybe the whole missing Dean thing was more to do with regret than anything else. He should have said more to keep the kid's spirits up.
The angel just kept staring at him, so Dean decided to stare right back, watching Castiel's expression revert back to that of an emotionless one; impassive.
“I can’t exactly help it,” the demon grumbled, standing beside the bed and lifting the corner of the comforter.
Dean loitered in the corridor as he watched Rufus slowly help Bobby up from the sofa, his shadow curving anxiously around the doorframe whilst he waited for the two men to move. He was actually, himself, scared to move; too worried about what Castiel had mentioned upstairs to try wandering about the house as normal, even if he sincerely doubted that Bobby had any demonic warding situated around the place. Rufus had gone off for a while and obviously done
," he stressed, attempting to shift the conversation away from that topic as quickly as possible. "If you're not gonna be sick again, go lay down or something. Sam can wait a little longer."
!" He yelled again, lowering himself above Castiel to listen out for even the smallest fucking breath, just in case the past thirty seconds hadn't given him enough evidence as to what Castiel's situation was, but he was fucking
He didn’t want to care about their opinions as much as he did, but he could only imagine what they were thinking: that he’d been charmed, that he’d let an angel get inside his head and manipulate him into believing it was good.
“Christ, Dean! Don’t scare me like that!” He blurted, picking the brush up again and rinsing it momentarily under the tap.
"Please? Just one more," he begged, pulling out a twenty from his pocket when he was standing. He still had a fair amount money left from the last time he'd gone out hunting with his dad, but he kinda felt guilty for not contributing all that much since staying at Bobby's. This wasn't exactly that big a gesture but he figured it was better than nothing, and he pushed the money across the table before straightening up again. "I'll pay for this round."
Castiel scrubbed at his jaw. "Right, well, you didn't make me uncomfortable, so there's no reason to apologise. Okay?"
He yawned, looking to the closed curtains as the windows rattled with yet another oncoming train. He'd heard it happen a couple of times now so he was beginning to understand why Dean had had such a problem getting to sleep to begin with, but he was just glad the boy had managed to fall asleep since then, especially since a lack of sleep could only make Dean more emotional.
Dean froze at the realisation of what had just happened, immediately regretting saying anything at all. Castiel had fallen quiet with a grimace on his face, and it only made Dean feel worse knowing that the angel hadn't simply ignored the question, but instead had been thinking up a fucking answer!
"Go get the truck ready," Bobby prompted, patting him on the shoulder as he got up from the table. "We're leavin' at eleven."
"I prefer being in control, not experiencing some impromptu disappearance act that makes me feel like I'm stuck on a damn carousel," Castiel insisted, feeling his stomach clench at the mere thought of it. It didn't help the pain, and Castiel pulled a face in irritation, glaring down at his own chest as he willed the agony to cease, if only for a while longer.
He scrolled down through the pages, glancing out the window every so often to see the sun get that little bit lower. Despite how cloudy it was, the light still managed to break through and warm the surface of the comforter, and from the corner of his eye, he spotted his phone beneath a few items of clothing, reflecting the gold of the sun. He reached for it absentmindedly, rotating it in his hand as he continued to read through the pages of his comic, his eyes scanning each page with a certain laziness.
"This is, uhhh ... this is the reason why I'm so concerned about what'll happen to you," Dean murmured, his fingers pushing Sam's hair from his brow. "I don't want you passing out in the middle of the forest."
“I-I’m not gonna hurt you, Cas. I just wanted to make sure you were okay,” Dean said softly, genuinely surprised that Cas hadn’t even told him to fuck off or anything yet given the situation before. He’d at least expected Cas to make some sort of remark on their closeness, or even tried to push him away, but instead Castiel simply stared. Like, completely frozen, and Dean didn’t know whether that was because he was scared or because he knew that trying to hurt Dean would only rebound, but seriously: the staring was starting to creep Dean out.
He drew his hands back close to him when Dean leant in to examine the map, dragging his palms over the blood spatter on the table to partially clear the stains.
"He'll be okay," the boy grinned, looking back at Sam. "Well, he'll be a lot more accepting than I was anyway."
was helping now: to repay the debt. He'd made it clear that he didn't want to assist the angel any more than he had to, and once this was all over he never wanted Cas to visit the property again. Rufus clearly wasn’t as welcoming and Dean had yet to hear an argument from the man himself yet, but Dean was satisfied with the assistance he’d been offered so far.
Dean left it another day before showing his face downstairs again. Bobby hadn't gone out on a hunt after all, but he hadn't been all that present around the house either. Not that Dean had actively sought him out. He'd kinda left it a while, nestled upstairs in his bed with one of the bestiaries going over all the scary shit again to prepare himself properly. It was only when he'd gone downstairs, masked in his shadow to get a different book, that he noticed Bobby was sat in the kitchen, having breakfast by himself.
Dean dropped his bag to the bed, sitting down beside it. His face was still hot, and his frustration was making his head ache, but he didn't have anything to take the edge off of it. Sleeping pills would do fuck all, apart from the obvious, but he wasn't really tired enough to want to go to sleep. Plus it was only, like, half six. For all he knew, Bobby might be open to conversation later, and he felt like he'd be being rude by going to bed now.
No sooner had he lifted himself from the trap door and seated himself on the edge did he hear what the boy was saying properly, able to watch the demon pace back and forth through the main part of the cabin. The holy fire had been extinguished, but the beam still lay across the floor, the boy stepping onto the end to walk along the length of the wood carefully.
But he was provided with a new kind of terror altogether when he finally acknowledged the boy in front of him, his blood running cold and a nauseous sensation rising in his chest at the sight.
Dean entered the room almost timidly, and Castiel cast a small smile in his direction, even if he was somewhat aggravated by how controlling the boy had been prior. He marginally understood why Dean didn't want him taking on any more of the illness, but Castiel knew that so long as he managed his healing, he would be perfectly alright.
But it still made Dean feel sick at the thought of how much suffering his dad wanted to put Cas through – just for
Dean couldn’t even fucking describe it. He’d still been wearing his ring with all the complex warding on, but as soon as Castiel had gone out of his way to interact with the shadow in that way specifically, there was this weird fucking tingling feeling that shot up the base of his spine. It didn’t necessarily
There was so much confusing shit in the hunter community; he potentially would have just gotten himself killed approaching the guy, and it was for that reason that he was glad he'd never found himself paired with another angel on a hunt. Thinking about it, he'd most likely have refused to partake in the mission solely because of his lacklustre understanding of his own race.
But it wasn’t simply the faded scars and evidence of past troubles – it was his features: youthful and feminine, and his eyes; the surprisingly green irises were uncommon for a demon to possess, and they looked so very familiar. It felt odd to want to murder someone who resembled a past colleague or companion – especially since he’d had so very few who were actually convivial.
His hands fell loosely to his sides and his smile was just as weak as he felt. "Good," he muttered, casting his eyes to the floor as he turned to leave the room. There wasn't anything else he could say, and he couldn't really be bothered to argue anymore. Bobby wouldn't be giving him his phone back no matter how many more times he asked.
The boy's hand stilled, the wipe resting at an awkward angle against his wound, and he squirmed, shuffling forward a little so it didn't hurt as much.
"But ... you admit that I'm attractive?" Dean followed up smugly, and Castiel rolled his eyes, his bare feet padding silently over the stone. He should have known to expect Dean's vanity, but it was amusing just how much Dean seemed to be doting on his opinion, even if all Castiel would be doing was boosting the kid's ego.
His eyes were immediately drawn to the sad-looking couch that lay directly opposite the front door; at the wilted cushions that made up the cramped two-seater. He had every intention of letting Dean take the bed later, but now that it was getting late, he was not particularly looking forward to sleeping on something that appeared even more dishevelled than the furniture he’d made for his own home.
Castiel was surprised at the blatant honesty behind the words, pleased that he hadn’t been fed some sappy lie about ‘genuinely caring’ instead. It still bothered him that the boy’s father was apparently kicking him out for what seemed to be the more sensible option, especially since the demon was saving more than just one life through this choice.
But instead, he kept his mouth shut, attempting to straighten out his frown before he was being shoved to the side, his hip slamming against the wood of the nightstand.
His eyes went to Cas’s face when the guy’s head jerked, taking in the furrowed brow and the sheen on his forehead; a look of real pain that he recognized as similar to that of Sam’s fevers, but since Cas could heal illness and stuff, did that mean it was something else?
, but he'd done a fairly good job of avoiding those topics whilst the boy had read beside him, the noise of pages turning almost soothing to hear.
Maybe angel blood did have healing properties. Maybe it didn’t. The point was, it didn’t belong to anyone other than the angel, and there’s a good fucking reason as to why the transaction is banned. Dean didn’t even know how many angels were left in America, having been told that the majority fled shortly before the Union actually came to a decision of banning the bleeding process, but Cas had to be pretty fucking brave to stay through it all. Especially since the law had only been passed a few years ago.
Castiel turned his head to level Dean with a look that bordered on a glare, a certain austerity to his features that Dean hadn't actually seen before. It admittedly made him feel an immense discomfort, continuing to toy with his ring as the realisation slowly dawned on the angel's face, Cas's lips parting ever so slightly.
Although finding out something like that would definitely make it easier for Dean to go without contacting him during the whole grounding period.
He was stood in what seemed to be a library; books were stacked in various places all over the hard, wood floor, and the panic set in immediately as Dean pulled harshly at his wrist, leading him over to where a man lay on the couch.
Dean felt sorry for Rumsfeld sometimes, knowing that it must suck for him whenever Bobby went out on a hunt, even if it was usually for no longer than a night or so. It couldn't be all that fun chained up outside for hours on end with nothing to do - and it probably got worse when he went the night without being fed. Not that Bobby starved his dog or anything, seeing as he barely took on hunts anymore as it was, issuing work more than anything else, but still. Bobby rarely let the dog in the house. Rumsfeld was out on his own more often than not.
"What?" Dean prompted quietly, and it had Castiel shrinking in on himself. He tipped back the rest of his beer to finish it off, his arms falling loosely to his sides when he was done, and he stared down at the concrete floor, his hair falling down into his eyes.
Castiel went on to light a fire in the place he always did, sitting beside the pit and appreciating the sound of the flames against the backdrop of rain. It was incredibly comforting, and he wished he could have remained like that for far longer than he did.
It was incredibly warm in the house. Too warm. Dean was lain out on the bed in his underwear and a shirt, his laptop balanced on his chest as he watched some crappy horror film to pass the time. He wasn't exactly paying attention to it; the heat was making him uncomfortable and it was difficult to concentrate on anything else at all. It was actually why he'd put off researching again, knowing damn well that as soon as he started reading, he'd lose focus and end up taking another nap.
Dean blinked. "Well, I'd have thought if you didn't want me looking at you, we'd be having a repeat of earlier."
He didn't get an answer but the silence was enough, so he busied himself by grabbing the cannister of gasoline from a duffel on the floor, throwing it in every single direction to make sure the creatures would definitely stay dead once they'd headed back to Bobby's. He doubted they had much time to get out of here before the police came, given just how much shouting the older men had done. Obviously, it wasn't their fault, but it had Dean worried that someone'd come running in at any minute.
Dean was halfway through a mouthful of bacon when he heard Bobby clear his throat, so he set his cutlery down out of courtesy, wiping at his mouth with the back of his hand.
He went to push open the bathroom door, stalling for a moment when he caught that light in the corner of his eye again, and he turned his head slightly to get a better look, freezing when he realised what - or rather,
But it was in that moment that he noticed the remaining tears of the prior entry; slices of paper near the spine of the book that he knew had been removed out of common courtesy.
The whole thing was bullshit. Dean was fighting as hard as he could to keep his emotions in check, his shadow writhing beneath the body of his chair.
It’d probably make it easier for Bobby to get behind the whole idea of Dean befriending Cas if he continued to make an effort to research the angelic species and ward himself properly. Well, given recent events it would likely be a while before Bobby would go out of his way to help Dean learn about something like that - more so if having the warding in place would only encourage Dean to hang out with Cas more - but Bobby had experienced Castiel’s kindness first hand now. The angel didn’t ask for anything from the older man, and had taken on the worst of his injuries.
Castiel sat down in front of the cabinets in the kitchen, the boy beside him with a little over a foot between them, and a virtually silent atmosphere. It was nice to not be expected to initiate conversation, and what made it better was the fact that the demon had finally quieted down, having kept silent for almost a full half hour. It was assuredly the longest the boy had gone speaking to him during the time in each other's company, and for the first time in what felt like days, Castiel didn't have anything particularly stressful to think about.
He dropped his head against the wall with a groan. They hadn’t exactly had the chance to discuss the plan for the hunt yet, but even the thought of talking it over now was draining him enough to put him off the whole idea of hunting altogether, especially if Cas wanted to start early.
It was actually starting to worry him because he'd been intending to sing Castiel's praises when referring him to another hunting firm, but if Cas was saying it was stupid, then how the hell was Dean meant to give a good impression?
Part of him was incredibly paranoid; the thought of him going back to face Crowley after the way he'd been set up had him worrying that the demon could easily sell him off to the next delusional creature that asked for his blood. He was well aware that Crowley's other employees were fairly terrified of him as it was, and although Castiel had no intention of completely alienating himself from everyone else, this was really the push he needed to find a better employer. Crowley may pay well, but it was hardly worth risking being sold off as medicine for a second time.
Not when Castiel had been hunting for a lot longer than Dean had actually anticipated. Cas probably knew about every fucking monster out there by this point.
"If you're worried about me getting hurt, we could always make a deal," Dean suggested coyly, leaning forward. "Give me some extra protection."
“Stop pulling me around like that! I can’t heal myself anymore!” Castiel yelped, and Dean could hear the pain in his voice; the discomfort as a result of Dean’s anger.
"Uhhh, yeah. For now, anyway," Dean murmured, and Castiel could feel the boy's fingertips touch at his wrist, attempting to lift it away from his shirt. "Let me put a gauze on this, dude. You're not healing as fast as I thought you would.”
He skidded down the bank surprisingly gracefully, his shoes stirring up the dry dirt into a dust cloud that loitered around his ankles for a few moments as he continued to walk forward. Part of him actually hoped there was nothing waiting for him in the trap because killing the creature was effort. So was skinning. And cooking. Even fucking eating was something Castiel didn't feel up to right now, and yes, it was confusing considering just how little he'd eaten over the past day and a half, but he just couldn't be bothered.
Castiel stood at the mouth of his cave, staring out and watching the leaves twitch with the gentle summer breeze. There was still a fair portion of the forest that he had yet to learn, but he didn't want to risk being seen wandering about the areas frequented by tourists and the like. He knew that camping out in these sections was illegal, and he wasn't all that keen on the idea of moving to an unfamiliar section and recreating everything he'd built here. He doubted he'd ever have as much energy as he'd had those few years ago.
God. He didn't even know what he could do to stop feeling this way. Maybe letting Cas come round - or even calling the guy for a start - wasn't such a great idea, but he'd
"Well." He gathered a few of his drawings together before reaching across to dump them on Castiel's lap. "Lucky for you, I've spent
“All those big stores make billions every year. I don’t see the harm in me taking something small every now and again,” Dean retorted, stabbing at the pasta in his bowl. “Especially if it’s gonna benefit you.”
“Have you ... always shared with Sam?” He asked, because whilst he knew that Dean was likely lonely without his younger brother’s company, he still didn’t quite know the extent of their relationship. As someone who had spent so many years by himself - and had never had a sibling for company - it was one of those things that he doubted he’d ever be able to fully understand; so if it actually brought Dean a sense of comfort to share a bed, it wasn't all that ridiculous of a proposition.
"I don't feel comfortable letting you go back to that house yet in case they trap you again," Castiel called over his shoulder. "I'll teach you the spell to overcome it first."
"When you first put the handcuffs on me," he murmured, turning on the balls of his feet to start walking in the opposite direction again.
Dean rested his chin in a palm, balancing his elbow on his thigh as he watched Castiel mold the liquid into the shape of an unrecognizable cartridge, the beer stretched out in midair to craft a long, thin tip, sorta similar to an FMJ spitzer only Dean doubted Cas had made the core any different to the exterior. It was slowly frozen over, the dull colour of the drink turning an almost opaque grey, completely encased in ice.
sensation in his chest when Castiel diffidently met his gaze, the combination of both fear and anger practically emitting from his form, twisting the knife deeper every second Dean stood there holding his line of sight.
There was one story in particular that kind of struck a chord with him, mostly because it seemed so simple and way less dramatic than all the stuff involving some human-hating-alpha-angels.
Rufus reappeared at the other entrance to the living room, his hand resting on the gun holstered to his waist, a stern look in his eyes.
Castiel wasn't staring at him with the expected air of amusement, his head cocked to the side out of apparent analysis more than anything else, and Dean could feel the flush burn up the back of his neck, making him feel even more uncomfortable with the whole thing
I figured I may as well give a go at finishing this fic off in his honour (hopefully I find time for the other one too), even if I do have to prioritise my art work from here on out
The demon sighed, rubbing a hand over his brow as his cheeks turned an even brighter shade of pink. “It’s not
Dean grimaced at the reminder of the camp John had been trying to persuade Dean to attend a while back, claiming that it'd toughen him up a bit. Make him a better hunter.
"You're a horrible person," he teased, even if the words could be seen as truth. He himself had never gone out of his way to torment a human like that, but in all honesty, they could have witnessed something far worse than two people vanishing from a room.
He’d never seen something alter its anatomy so fluidly before. Like, he’d seen a skinwalker’s bones rearrange, but he’d never dealt with anything that could fuck around with specific pieces of its body whilst ultimately remaining human-looking to some degree! Even as it sparred with Cas, its limbs twisted and the skin erupted with thick scales, clattering against Castiel’s blade as he darted between each swipe.
The line went completely dead but Castiel didn't move. He stiffened, unable to keep his eyes from running over the blood-covered boy that appeared in the middle of his motel room. His arm fell to his side slowly, his hold on his phone going lax.
The phone went smashing against the wall, the intricate components scattering over the floor from the impact, and Castiel risked a few steps over, reaching for the boy's wrist. The demon jolted, and Castiel immediately felt his power weaken as the boy turned round to face him, fear in his eyes. Castiel ignored the expression, slightly offended by the abrupt block of his Grace, but he coaxed the boy to open his hand, flattening out his palm to examine the bloody indentations his fingernails had left.
with me; but he's a smart, albeit cruel man, and his Daeva will be observing me the second I get to that location. It's not worth the risk."
The demon’s absence was in no way alarming, and Castiel grimaced as he straightened up in posture, craning his neck to examine the blood stain on the back of his shirt and frowning further at the new dampness that had begun to soak through. He’d worsened the condition of the wound when he’d sat up before, and even though he was numbing the pain with his Grace, there was still a certain stinging sensation surrounding the injury. He didn’t want to waste all of his energy on his own injuries when he would only be expected to heal someone else, and he still hadn’t been informed of the severity of such an illness so he didn’t know how much Grace he’d actually require. It would be very unfortunate if he went to heal them and end up unable – especially when that would most likely result in him appearing as if a liar, the deal abandoned as some other demon bled him out instead. He wanted to get out of this alive, and if it meant putting up with the same irritable pain for a further twenty-four hours, then he would endure it.
Obviously, Castiel couldn't really afford to eat it all raw, given the fact that he wanted to save his supplies for as long as possible and freezing the vegetables didn't seem all that wise. At least the soups maintained their flavour when they were defrosted. Vegetables always seemed to wilt, their taste bland and their consistency ... off.
Being shot in the shoulder must be a regular occurrence if the boy considered it to be ‘fine’. Castiel snorted with amusement, noting the obvious discomfort the demon experienced whilst speaking to whoever it was on the phone. Their boss, most likely, although it was confusing to think that the demon would great his boss so nonchalantly to begin with. Castiel wouldn’t have ever addressed Crowley through such a method. It would seem rude, and would quite possibly put him out of work.
There were certain things he could address during this time though - like why the boy had had a change of heart. Castiel wasn't an idiot. The demon had quite blatantly intended his death, but for him to suddenly give up a home and family, of all things, was yet another bold decision the boy had made - one that should have encouraged him to act marginally more upset than he appeared, considering how he'd acted before in the kitchen. It brought his doubts back to the surface despite his earlier assumptions regarding the boy's emotions, and it had one question in particular gliding off his tongue thoughtlessly:
“No,” Dean argued, wrestling with the volume of his words because he didn't want to come across as aggressive as he'd initially intended to be. “All you’ve told me is he’s dangerous because he’s an angel, and I’m fully aware of just how dangerous angels can be.” He pointed to Castiel’s unconscious form. “But he is not the threat that you think he is.”
Dean didn't care what Bobby's opinion on angels was. He didn't care if this could get him kicked out of his temporary home either. He would do everything he could to make sure Bobby would be okay, and if that meant bringing Cas round to make that happen, then it was definitely worth the fucking risk.
Castiel froze, able to hear the shouting that was suddenly emitted from the device. He was surprised, moreover, that the demon had been addressing his father as ‘
Why the fuck was it so easy to think about, yet when he went to discuss it he had a fucking breakdown? He'd figured things out - he knew how to take care of himself - so there was no need for this
! He'd been kinda reluctant to read too much about their powers so close to going back to bed, so after skimming over a couple of entries he decided to start researching the whole 'charming' thing first, given how concerned Bobby had been. There was pretty much an entry for charming in every book, so Dean figured he'd be able to get a broader understanding of what he could look out for both currently, and in the future.
“Now, Pamela’s on her way down to take a look at him,” Bobby continued, his voice crackling with static. “I can’t make any promises though, Dean. There’s not much more I can offer after that.”
Perhaps it was petty of him to still hold something like that to heart, but with all of this new knowledge, he was finding it harder to accept John’s anger toward him letting Castiel go. If the angel had murdered a shit-ton of people in the same way his parents had, then Dean would understand why he was top pick.
Castiel had closed his eyes, those mumblings coming again as Dean pulled him up, resting him against the wall.
different. They definitely trusted each other more, and whilst Dean knew deep down that the chances of them sharing a bed for a second time were pretty slim, Castiel was so much more comfortable in his company now so there was still
When he finally went back downstairs again, it wasn't to talk. He'd started to make himself feel kinda claustrophobic and he was aching to move around more than a few steps a day.
It was definitely a different experience cooking in a house than it was in a motel, and Dean still wasn't completely certain he knew how to work the oven here. He could remember the many times that he and Sam had been left alone for a few days in a room that's only functional kitchen appliance was a microwave and it had definitely encouraged Dean to get more creative with meals, even if by creative it meant pouring dry cereal between two slices of bread, calling it a dessert and hoping Sam wouldn't mention anything to John.
for all you guys who read fragment and were wondering when i'd finally get my ass in gear, i'll update tomorrow. i know i kinda left that one for a long time too, but after tuesday's episode, i was really in the mood for writing angst and the chapter's pretty much almost done.
Castiel pulled his phone from his back pocket as he walked to the sink to get water, looking down at the glowing screen. “It’s nine-fifteen.”
Well, obviously getting the message out there as soon as possible would be better, but he doubted it would change the views all that quickly. He was pretty sure there were other hunters that knew just how useless angel blood was, and some of them may have even spoken about it before, but Dean would have to persuade a considerable amount of people if he had a chance of making a more prominent change to the way people view angels as a whole.
John bellowed, and Dean shut his eyes before the tears could fall, not wanting his dad to shout at him for longer than he could handle.
He stared up at the ceiling, breathing heavily as he tried to block out the sound of Castiel vomiting 15 feet away.
Regardless, it had benefited Castiel greatly, and it had given him a greater insight to the demon species as a whole.
To put it simply, Castiel had been observant enough to notice the bruises on Dean's face and that was enough to kick-start some kind of paternal instinct within him, wanting nothing more than to heal Dean of any afflictions the boy had suffered in the three weeks they'd gone without seeing each other. He'd refrained from asking if Dean actually wanted to be healed though, concerned that he'd accidentally do more harm than good overall if the boy were to say 'yes'. It had given him this odd, tight sensation in his chest seeing the damage up close and knowing that he couldn't really risk doing anything about it. Dean hadn't seemed too fussed about the injuries, his boisterous attitude almost distracting Castiel from the wounds as Dean had continued to tease him for being so dazed by the entire encounter, and Castiel had found more than just the influence of alcohol reddening his face when he'd found the demon staring at his eyes again.
"How?" Dean pressed, looking at the smooth underside. "You light an explosive in a body of ice and all you get is a tiny chip in the shell? What the hell do you do to them?"
decisions as a collective that would decide whether or not Castiel would pull through this had him feeling more than just a little anxious.
, you know. I'm not going to waste my energy walking when I could be home five minutes after you drop me off."
It hit a bit different to have Castiel being so bossy this time around. It actually made Dean feel a little giddy, unable to keep the stupid grin from his face as the angel seemed to lean toward him ever so slightly. “Yes, sir!”
he was being so disgustingly selfish again. Cas wasn’t even calling him out on it. He was just being his usual self: tolerating Dean.
Both brothers were silent for a moment, Dean's hand curving around to act as a support between his shoulder blades, and Castiel let himself go slightly limp, trying to steady his breathing as his body became weakened again, encouraging his Grace to disperse briefly to numb the pain.
The boy went quiet, and Castiel winced as the metal of his restraints dug deeper into his flesh. The pain was good - useful and distracting, but the pressure on his bladder was worsening and he
It didn't bother him as much as he thought it would: the conversation he'd have to have with the older man soon. Dean had no regrets about what happened, and he would proudly say as much. If anything, he was actually a little bit excited to talk about it, as weird as that sounded. Castiel had clearly done Bobby a favour, and the fact that Castiel hadn't even gone for Rufus after being shot at
It didn't really bother him: how close the demon sat. Not when he knew just how damn terrified the kid had looked before. Of course, the power he held over the boy was what he'd wanted, but it wasn't as satisfying as he'd thought it'd be to see what kind of results it produced. He'd thought the boy was on the verge of hyperventilating or even deeming Castiel a threat. All he'd wanted to do was make things a little easier.
Sometimes Crowley was doubtful of his work, but Castiel never failed. He didn’t want to ruin his reputation by screwing up a job so simple, but every last werewolf had been taken care of. He hadn’t detected any other form of dangerous civilization in the vicinity once he had decidedly finished so he had assuredly completed the task to his full potential.
Castiel encouraged Dean to turn his head to the side, tenderly brushing a thumb over the bruise on Dean's cheek, but then he felt that weird foreign buzz beneath his skin that had him grabbing the angel's wrist, holding it at bay.
He waited until Dean had finished using the bathroom patiently, his arms folded across the arm of the settee with his chin resting atop them. The cushions truly were uncomfortable, giving way completely beneath his weight - so much so that Castiel could feel the solid base of the couch under his thighs.
"Yes, you did! You went in the corner to do that breathing thing 'cos you thought he was gonna die."
The bite mark almost throbbed when Castiel mentioned it, but it wasn't so bad an injury that Dean really needed it healing in the first place. It had stopped bleeding long before they had left Bobby's, and whilst it did look kinda deep, Dean imagined it would only leave a small scar.
“Sam knows Bobby’s number anyway, so if he had the opportunity himself he’d call,” Dean continued, handing Castiel one of the bowls. “Think my dad might be keeping an eye on him at the moment though. Wouldn’t be surprised if he’d done the same to Sam as Bobby’s done to me to stop us from talking.”
Sure, there was pain - plenty of pain - but Castiel had been expecting that and his Grace had been automatically dulling it as it passed over into his own form. What he hadn’t been expecting with quite as much severity was the blood that began to seep through the fabric of his own shirt, his stomach gradually tearing open as the energy ebbed between their forms.
The ring slipped from his finger and he withdrew his shadow abruptly with a yell as the harsh burn tore through the dark extension, rippling throughout his whole body until he found himself stumbling against the nearest wall, clutching at his chest. Something screeched and he felt claws dig into his legs, but aside from pain, his senses had been impacted so heavily that all he could do was kick wildly at whatever the fuck it was that was holding onto him so tight.
Castiel didn't feel safe at all. There was some form of strong warding on the walls that almost restricted his actions and his joints were aching the more he attempted to relax. He doubted Dean would even be able to remove the warding for him - not that he should actually ask. He didn’t know how this hunter would react to having something so crucial erased from the walls, even if it was for such an important process.
Castiel continued to stare, wondering if the demon before him inherited the same looks his father possessed. “That doesn’t rule out the possibility. Did he ever mention the case he worked?”
to leave, but he could see that the bleeding over his throat had been staunched now so there were only a few droplets of blood on the floor, and it had Dean wondering if Cas’s blood really did have healing properties. From what Cas had told him, it was the whole ‘Grace’ factor that healed him, and when John had talked about it, he’d always said an angel’s Grace was their life energy – like the soul of a human, only when angels made deals, their Grace couldn’t be used as bargaining material. Dean had heard that it couldn’t be taken but it could be given, so didn’t that mean if Cas didn’t actually want anyone taking his blood, the blood wouldn’t have any healing properties? The Grace wasn’t an object so it couldn’t be extracted in any way, and Dean didn’t know how Cas summoned it to heal himself or anything because if it was just some sort of presence, then where the hell did it stay?
The idea of dating someone whilst he was still a hunter kind of put him off the idea altogether because that would surely be more of a struggle. He didn't actually know how his own parents had managed for as long as they did. Dean knew that if he ever had kids in the future he'd at least want to be settled down properly instead of constantly moving around the country, but that was obviously easier said than done. It wasn't like Dean really had any qualifications to get himself a serious job.
So throwing out most of the photos was easy. The ones he had wanted to keep were stashed away in the same manner that Castiel had hidden this picture: between the pages of an old book, knowing that John wouldn’t ever flick through something like that in the first place.
He’d asked about it numerous times, but it was a genuine concern of his. He didn’t like to think that Dean would share the same childhood Castiel himself had lived, and if Dean didn’t get out of hunting soon, he’d most likely end up spending the rest of his life earning little to nothing just to get by. It made Castiel feel sick – especially when he knew there wasn’t anything he could really do to help with that. All he could do was hope that the demon’s uncle was generous enough to allow Dean to live as he wanted.
He looked around the rest of the cabin hurriedly, rushing to the far side as he sought out another means of exit. He’d prefer it if he didn't have to face the boy, mostly because the child hadn't actually done any wrong yet. He hadn't really deserved to be wounded in the first place, and although Castiel had virtually threatened him, he would rather not have to take anyone’s life without an order to do so.
The kid was in terrible condition, barely able to even sit up on his own anymore, so he was basically permanently bedridden. They'd been to doctors and healers, psychics and witches - and still, they didn't have a fucking clue what they were dealing with.
Castiel knew that he was being somewhat arrogant by assuming he'd be able to master a skill when it mightn't even be possible, but he was determined to become strong enough that he didn't have to worry about being hunted down by anyone else. This was about making himself feel as safe as he could. He'd been living in fear for far too long, and if he could make even the slightest improvement to his life then
The rest of the day seemed to pass incredibly slowly, with the summer heat making it horribly uncomfortable to stay out on the rock face for longer than half an hour at a time. The weather wasn't that unbearable overall, but the rock was hot beneath the soles of his feet and it was the only part of the woodland that didn't seem to be covered in shade. Even the spring was hidden beneath the shadow of the forest at this hour, the sun gradually lowering itself over the mountains as the sky was streaked with reds and purples.
Dean ignored the dull ache the angel's foot made in his side before meeting the cold glare, "At what point did I say I pitied you?"
Castiel stopped listening after that, running the demon’s words over and over in his head to extract the lies buried within. There was no way the boy would simply choose to let him go just like
He'd only made two deals so far: the one with Cas, and another with a girl called Lisa. Obviously, Castiel didn't have a soul and they'd based their deal more on a trade so Dean didn't have any guilt regarding that, but the deal with Lisa was different. It had been unintentional and stemmed from a dare, and Dean definitely felt guilty about that one, more so now that he had a soul to cash in at any moment. Given that he could choose when Lisa's soul departed, he'd left her with it for now, but it did make him anxious thinking about the effects it would have if he sold it off. He'd never seen a soulless human before.
Dean transported himself outside as quickly as he could, not wanting to be made to feel more insignificant than he already did. He knew he'd done the right thing by letting Cas live. Cas had healed Sam and that was the most important factor any of them should have cared about; not where the angel was.
, is...dead.” He will never, ever get used to the stabbing pain that comes with those words. He can’t imagine how Cassie must be feeling. “I imagine he would be sick.”
The recorded mall closing message plays, and Dean realizes that he’s spent the last hour talking to the hottest guy he’s ever seen about skincare and cologne. Not his usual repertoire. Not to mention that not everything in this basket he’s holding is for Eileen. He’s not sure how he got talked into charcoal masks and citrus scrubs, but he enjoyed every second of it. He’s actually looking forward to going home and trying them out. After braving the mall this close to Christmas on a Friday night, and completing his Christmas shopping, he deserves some Dean Time. His biggest decision then will be whether to read one of his new magazines or one of the paperbacks while he sprawls in the tub.
“You can make a more informed choice if you try them yourself. Plus, you might find that you like it,” Castiel arches an eyebrow at Dean in an unspoken challenge. After a brief, but obvious, internal debate, Dean follows Castiel to the display. “Good boy,” Castiel murmurs. Dean nearly trips over his own feet.
“Shhh...I know you will. Gonna be so good for me, Omega,” Michael lets out a deep sigh as he frees his cock from its confines and presses against Dean’s ass. “Mmmm, is this what you need?”
to it is killing him. He really needs to come clean, at least to Cas. Then he can pass along to Gabe and Chuck what a complete asshole Dean has been once he leaves. He doesn’t like that idea any better than the other one. Quietly, he sits the tray down on Cas’ desk and gestures towards it. Cas looks at him like he’s never seen anything so wonderful and mimes pouring into a glass. Dean pours them each a glass of what turns out to be orange pineapple juice, and Cas takes it gratefully.
There’s a brief chuckle from close behind him, and dear god, the man smells amazing. “There are quite a few options. You wouldn’t be the first to be a bit overwhelmed.” Dean turns around, his trademark grin in place, and he feels the earth grind to a halt. If Dean were to go all Weird Science and build his perfect man, he’d be a carbon copy of the one standing in front of him.  Dark hair expertly (or carelessly) tousled into an epic head of sex hair, three days’ worth of stubble on a strong jaw, expertly lined piercing blue eyes, and what he’s sure are the most kissable lips he’s ever seen. That’s just from the neck up. The store uniform does nothing to hide broad shoulders and strong arms. Their height difference is negligible, allowing Dean to stare into eyes the colour of summer skies..
He doesn't trust himself to drive, and he knows that Cas is probably as sick as he is. He fumbles his phone out of his pocket. "Hey Google, call Short Stack."
“At least I got a solid hit in. Didn’t know I had it in me. I’ve always been the good little soldier,” he sighs, leaning his head back against the booth.
“Cas, you’re busy. He’ll stop eventually.” They’ve raised their voices now to be heard over JB’s frantic wails. Dean’s patting his tiny back, trying to calm him down. The more Jimmybean cries, the worse Dean feels. Once again he unhooks the straps and transfers the carrier and JB back to Cas. After he’s strapped in, Jimmybean calms considerably. His sobs become hiccups before stopping altogether. He crams his thumb into his mouth and eyes his father. If Dean didn’t know better, he’d swear the boy was doing this on purpose.
Jimmy has made a point of going to Pam’s for lunch on the weekends and dinner twice a week. He always sits in Dean’s section, or at the bar if that’s where he’s working. They talk, but Jimmy gets the impression that there’s much more to Dean’s story than he’s telling. Why, for example, he’s busting his ass seven days a week at what looks to be halfway through his pregnancy. He understands that it’s not his business, and that he has no right to ask, but it bothers him. Where is his family? His partner? A guy like Dean has got to have dozens of friends, right? Where are all of these people when Dean could clearly use their support?
He’d eventually packed what he’d wanted to save, and the rest was waiting on the truck from Goodwill. Jimmy hadn’t had a car, so he assumes the keys are Dean’s. No keyfob means checking cars in the lot. A little ways down the sidewalk, Castiel hits the jackpot. A sleek black muscle car with a car seat strapped in the back was parked under a streetlight and covered in a fine dusting of yellow pollen.
Cas just smiles softly at him. “It’s no trouble at all, Dean. I’m here for you. Both of you. Whatever you need.”
His Saturday lunch shift is busy, as usual. Dean’s pretty sure he’s walked thirty miles so far, and it doesn’t bear thinking about how much weight he’s lifted. He’s not sure what it says about him that he considers his bartending shift relaxing, but he’s looking forward to the downtime tonight. He’s in the midst of pre-busing one of his tables when his manager calls him over. Dean’s anxiety level immediately skyrockets, and he’s grateful for the dampeners he applied on his last break.
"I worry, Dean, because from the first time I walked in here, you struck me as family. I need to help you, protect you, and I keep having to remind myself that it's not my place. I can't explain it any better than that. I wish I could. I'm angry at the people who've abandoned you, and I get angry at you, working yourself harder than you should be."
Around 5:45, because he's also a paranoid bastard, Dean took a break from cooking and grabbed a chilled beer from the fridge. He stuck the new offering in a Ziploc baggie with a note "there's more where this came from," taped both note and baggie to the bottle, then went outside to carefully arrange the day's mail around both items.
“Well, that’s awesome. When were you going to tell me this?” Dean’s not hurt, he’s pissed. He follows as Michael takes a load of luggage out to the hallway to place on a cart that Dean had missed when he first came up.
He'd enjoyed that last wood disc ornament, so he was making another one. What he wasn't expecting, though, was exactly how fucking sticky his homemade modge-podge would get if he had to rework some things. As a result, the screen on his phone was cloudy where he checked his pins, he had bits of paper stuck in various places on his body, and his hands were covered in different-degrees-of-dry-or-drying sticky white goop.
John’s voice plays in his head. “Not good for anything but knottin’ and breedin’.” Joke’s on him. Michael never knotted him. Now he knows why, because he never planned to stay. Looks like he left something behind after all.
“You’re safe with me, Dean. I just want to help. And while yes, you are ridiculously attractive, I’m not attracted
When Cas returns this time, he comes bearing pie and beer. He lifts the items with a cautious grin. "Peace offering?"
Dean grimaces. "It's my fault, Gabe. I need your help. I’ll explain everything, just come and get us. Please." He tells Gabe the name of the park and settles in to wait. He's sick twice more before Gabe and Balth reach them.
Honestly, all the transporting was making him feel kind of dizzy. He didn't usually use the ability as frequently as this in such a short time frame and he wasn't really prepared to pass out in the middle of a city in his underwear and a shirt, so he walked briskly through the open doors of the grocery store, automatically scouting out a place to sit down until the light-headedness went away.
He never spent more than he could afford, and although he did hoard away hundreds of dollars for evenings like these in particular, the money rarely stretched far and it only frustrated him when he lost more money renting rooms than he earned back on the hunt itself. It had encouraged him to be pickier with the jobs he was assigned. He’d never really seen the point in wasting all his energy flying such extreme distances only to pass out in a room for three days straight to recover. Of course, he’d done it a few times when he’d been incredibly desperate, but it had never been worth the few dollars profit he made after covering the motel costs.
Part of him had always wanted to figure out the meaning and identity of the person in his mind, but to pin it all on one demon purely because of the child’s abnormality was stupid. It really could be nothing more than fiction.
He turned the page again, skimming his eyes over the text boxes as he attempted to register what it was exactly that was going on in the storyline.
Dean swallowed thickly, his eyes inadvertently drifting to the single bed before he directed his gaze to the floor. "I, uhhh ... I hadn't actually planned that far ahead yet. You okay with me staying?"
Dean knew this was a serious conversation - one that could more than likely see him being thrown out of the household - but he didn't want to read it. He'd read several books outlining the same shit hundreds of times before and the thought of reading anything like that ever again made him want to puke. Sure, there were probably shitty angels out there but Cas wasn't one of them, and no amount of text could change his opinion on that.
But, again, that wasn't his parents' fault, nor were they to blame for the life he had now. Castiel had made his fair share of poor decisions to get him where he currently was, and he wouldn't dream of blaming anyone else for that - his parents especially. The last time he'd seen another angel, he'd found himself too intimidated to go up and ask them how their Grace looked so bright. That day was easily five or six years ago, and although Castiel had the confidence to take on any situation he faced, he hadn't met another angel outside of his immediate family. Given the fact he'd been raised under the guise of a human, he didn't really know how he could have approached the hunter he'd seen across the bar, and to be frank, he didn't even know how he could go about it now.
He clenched his jaw, swallowing thickly as he transported them both inside. He felt almost jittery as he and the angel stood in the dark house together, his chest feeling tight as his vision began to adjust to the poor lighting.
There were few organs that had gone unaffected by whatever it was that was poisoning his body. Thankfully, his brain was still receiving enough oxygen to function as per normal, and maybe his heartbeat was a little off kilter but it would only take a couple more minutes to even that out. It was just everything else that seemed to be failing, and Castiel knew that healing all of the damage immediately with his weakened state of Grace would probably result in some sort of coma.
He'd actually been hoping to find out that this was one of the rarer abilities, but after a couple of sentences, he realised that probably wasn't the case - especially when two of the entries stated that charming was actually one of the more common powers. Not only that, but while Dean had just assumed it would be something similar to low-class witch's hex, he found himself proved wrong
Castiel hadn't really tried sewing with his power before. He could move items with a mere thought but he'd never had the energy to apply it to something like that. He didn't really think he could hold an object steady enough to get the precision necessary. Besides, with something like stitching he wanted to get it finished as fast as possible, and fucking up would just make the whole process a hell of a lot longer.
like that!” Dean stressed again, but the words came out strangled and suddenly there were three pairs of eyes on him again, making him feel even more self-conscious than he had been moments before.
He was feeling a little light-headed from both his outburst and his lack of sleep, so he shuffled back to his chair weakly, accepting that nothing he said would even make a difference at this stage. He may as well have been talking to a fucking wall. Even Pamela hadn’t bothered to chip in and say something about the way Castiel was treated by the hunting community, leading Dean to believe that she was just as bigoted as Bobby and Rufus were.
He wasn’t really sure what to make of this treatment. Dean didn’t owe him anything, and Castiel didn’t want Dean doing things for him because he felt obligated to do so. He considered Dean an equal, and if they really were … if they were friends, then he didn’t want Dean to feel like they had to constantly trade favours.
"Sorry," Dean murmured, standing up immediately and clearing his throat. "Anyway, if there's anything more specific that you want, just let me know. I don't mind going out again."
“Go ‘way,” the boy grumbled, shoving at Castiel’s wrist pathetically before trying to roll over again, and Castiel let him, biting back his laugh at the sound of the thump and the quiet ‘fuck’ muffled against the wooden floorboards.
It was actually a lot safer for him to train in such a way, and he wouldn't be surprised if it actually helped him conserve energy in the future if he was in better shape.
Dean trailed along behind him, prodding him in the back when they neared the door, and Castiel turned around to see Dean's shadow cradling a bunch of change in one of its dark tendrils.
He rounded the corner, starting up the steady slope that he had molded himself, having flattened out the jagged edges so that he could even walk along it bare-foot. He was oddly proud of all the work he’d put into making something as obscure as a rock into his home, knowing that if someone did come looking for him, this wasn’t the most obvious place in the world. Some hunters were still ignorant enough to believe that angels lived in the trees, or even that some of them returned to Heaven to make their home. It was this kind of unaware insolence that annoyed Castiel more than anything else. His kind had been run from their initial homes in the forested lands – and yes, at some point or another, they may have lived in the treetops, but they didn’t sleep on the branches like everyone seemed to assume. They had built homes just like any other creature – houses like the humans, in more of a tree house fashion, but they were homes none the less – and they had been content.
"Put a song on for me," the demon requested quietly, and then he was gone, a light dusting of ash falling onto Castiel's clothes as he lingered outside the bar door alone.
He sat by the window despite it being where the light was weakest; crosslegged on the couch with his shadow drawn over his legs like a blanket, he balanced the book on his right knee so he could rest his weight on his other. The light from the desk was strong enough to let him read without casting a glare on the windows, allowing him to look out every now and again just in case Bobby
The first time Dean had discovered this power, he'd found himself toppling into the back seat of the Impala mid-conversation with Sam. He'd heard the boy screaming from his seat in the car, and he'd sat there in a sort of daze, rolling the window down and climbing out just as John came barrelling out of the motel room. Dean still didn't know how the whole power worked logically, but he could remember the way John had near interrogated him about what had happened and whether or not he'd be able to do it again.
“Yeah, when my parents weren’t out hunting,” Dean informed him. “Not so much recently because dad would just … he’d be out … a lot. We could never really afford more than one twin room.”
The minutes that followed were incredibly uncomfortable. Dean actually considered leaving the room to give Castiel his space, but he knew he'd upset the guy by bailing earlier on. He didn't want to stress Cas out even more by upping-and-leaving, even if it meant Dean could monitor the two hunters downstairs.
When Dean had stood up, Jimmy was able to see the small swell under his apron. His protective instincts had flared, and they’d only gotten stronger when he’d seen neither ring nor bite on Dean. An omega, alone, tired, and carrying. And with
“Yes, Alpha. Please, Alpha. Fuck me hard. I’ll be good, I’ll—” they both cry out as Michael slams home with one thrust. Not giving either of them time to adjust, he pounds into Dean furiously. It’s not long before they’re both riding the edge, Michael’s knot catching on Dean’s rim on every pull out.
They make small talk while he waits on his burger. He’s only been here a week, finally got all of his crap unpacked and decided to treat himself to lunch. The rain hadn’t been so heavy when he’d left, although it went to crap as soon as he was too far away to turn around and go home. He laughs at himself, making Dean smile. “Well, you’re welcome to hang out here until it lets up. Just yell if you need something. Name’s Dean.”
“Where will you go?” Michael seems genuinely concerned, and Dean’s not sure what to do with that. The only other person to show concern over his welfare was Sam.
Gabe weighs trying to clean off the spit up with just tossing the shirt in the laundry, and decides it’s not worth the time it would take. He pulls it over his head and tosses it in the general direction of his duffel.
Dean’s eyes are rolling back in his head, he’s so close...just… Michael tightens his grip and rubs across the head of his cock, and that’s it. Dean’s coming all over the door, clamping down on the cock in his ass as he groans out his release. A few more thrusts and Dean feels Michael’s cock throb as he fills him.
