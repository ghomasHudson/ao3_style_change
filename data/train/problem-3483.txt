"Oh please!" Sam scoffed. "I've seen you two. You're practically attached at the hip!"
Sam gave him warm smile and placed his hand on the nephilim's shoulder. ‚ÄúYeah, we should. You know, Dean and I are getting a little old to be constantly on the road, hacking away at whatever monsters we can find. Maybe it wouldn't kill us to take a few more breaks in between hunts.‚Äù
" Are you sure?" Mary asked, still in shock.
"Nuh- uh." Dean shook his head, and pulled Cas's lips back to his own. "sent a text....told 'em I...found...you... we're good." He said between kisses.
‚ÄúWell, there was also Jack. ‚ÄúDean offered. He felt another pain of loss wash over him at the mention of the kid's name. It was like rubbing salt in an open wound.
De day da
"As long as we're on the same page on that " he grunted. He slid the box on top of the table and swung his legs over the side of the bed.
"This is so NOT funny, Cas!"
"I feel like you sometimes forget that I was a soldier for centuries before I met you." Cas huffed. "Now that I have something worthy to fight for, I don't foresee that ending as long as you're alive."
"I'm, uh, gonna go see if Marie needs help cleaning anything up..." Sam mumbled as he practically skittered away.
"The Empty." Sam repeated. " It's probably different where you're from, but...it's the place angels and demons here go when they die."
‚ÄúA rugarou.‚Äù Sam grunted, he looked back over his list. ‚ÄúIt feeds off human flesh.‚Äù
Well he was certainly different from the Gabriel from their world.
It was one of the happiest times of Sam's childhood until one day, when he neglected tell Dean that he only had a half day at school. He had caught the bus back to the hotel after scrounging up some change from the fountain in front of the school. He knew Dean wouldn't get payed until the next week and they were low on gas as it was. Even though it was one of Dean's rare days off, he didn't want to make his brother drive up to the school when the rent was so close to being due. He wished he would have just called Dean ahead of time as soon as he walked in the door. He stood there in the doorway shocked to see one of the waitresses from Dean's work splayed out backwards over the counter of the kitchenette, skirt pulled up over her hips, moaning loudly as she twisted her fingers into Dean's hair, who was on his knees with his head squeezed firmly between her thighs. Sam couldn't bring himself to move, not even enough to close his eyes when she opened hers and saw him gaping at the scene before him.
‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù Adam gasped. ‚ÄúBut you aren't green or anything.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about that trench coat then, Dean.‚Äù Crowley challenged.
Alright, I'm gonna be honest. I'm procrastinating here. Also kinda projecting my own nerves onto Dean so please excuse Dean's little freak out and moment of almost 0 self confidence. I've said before that I resonate with Dean on many levels so I may have put my own characteristics in him for a bit. Sorry.
‚ÄúNow, remember,‚Äù Rowena lectured, ‚Äúwhen you see the other half appear, stand back before you smash that. It's volatile energy and can hurt you if you're too close.‚Äù
Fuck. Shitshitshit fuck goddamn. Dean knew he should've kept his big fucking mouth shut. He probably just freaked the guy out with all that sappy shit. No...no that wasn't it. Fuck, this was about Michael. He mentioned his short life expectancy and Cas thought he was talking about his plan on dealing with Michael. Maybe Cas was going to tell him he still planned on leaving? He was probably gonna sneak off after they all fell asleep. Shit! ‚ÄúOkay....‚Äù he said, bracing himself for the onslaught of Cas's departing words.
‚ÄúIt's more than a car.‚Äù Sam said. He realized how it must have sounded and was trying to run damage control before Kaia decided they were too heartless to waste her time on. ‚ÄúBefore we found this place, it was more like our home than anything. We traveled a lot when we were younger, never really stayed in the same place more than a few weeks. The Impala was our only constant, growing up.‚Äù Kaia listened to him with her lips pursed, still seeming unconvinced. ‚ÄúAnd to be fair, we've known the car a lot longer than we knew our mom.‚Äù Her eyes grew wide with confusion, and she looked as if she was about to say something when Sam threw his hands out in defense. ‚ÄúDon't get me wrong, Mom was great. We really did love her, but she wasn't exactly around until recently, which wasn't entirely her fault, then when she did come back she wasn't really warm and fuzzy about hanging around her adult sons at first... she eventually came around, but she still kinda kept her distance and there was probably still a lot left unsaid between her and Dean, I didn't really know her at all, but he did and I think Dean just kinda had it in his head that she'd just eventually come around to being the mother he knew when he was a kid, even though it turns out she wasn't exactly that person either. He just really wanted a parent that cared about him, not that our dad was completely horrible either, I mean he wasn't the best, but it's not like he...‚Äù
Aziraphale couldn't help but smirk at the nervous tone in the demon's voice. He had been working with Dean in the kitchen over the past month, learning how to cook things the human way because, as Dean had told him (and as the angel always believed, himself), 'food tastes better when the person who makes it puts their heart into it. It's not the same if you just pull it out of thin air!' It was a simple sandwich, nothing fancy or over complicated, yet every bite filled him with a sense of pride and affection, just knowing that the demon had put in the effort to show how much he cared. "It was as good as the person who made it." He replied, using his napkin to dab the corners of his mouth.
"We wait." Rowena said calmly. And the quite grew strong once more. It was Aziraphale that broke the silence, with a terrifying realization.
"You realize that you're talking about the same person." Cas said.
The angel let out a long sigh and Dean could hear him slide down the other side of the door. "What in the hell are you talking about?"
That's when shit hit the fan. Jack he could excuse. He was a kid. He didn't know any better. But Sam was a grown ass man. "I guess that makes me 'Uncle Sam' then, huh?" The dumb sasquatch chuckled out.
"You sure about that?" Claire chuckled. "Cuz, you sure as hell sound like one. I should know, I've been stuck with those little shits for weeks now."
"What deal!?" Sam asked. "When?"
A moment later Adam came back out the door and started walking away. ‚ÄúJasmine Cottage isn't too far from here. Follow me.‚Äù They walked for about half a block before Dean noticed Adam starting up at him, and cocked his head in silent question. ‚ÄùIs there an America on your world?‚Äù He asked.
He sat there for two days, patiently waiting. Watching Rowena as she came in every so often with a bowl of ingredients, chanting some foreign words as she spread them around his wounds. Two days, listening to Aziraphale explain what he was doing as he laid his hands over the other angel letting bits of his power surge through him to ease the pain. Two days, observing Alex as she checked the cuts for infection and spreading antibiotic ointment on the ones that were slower to heal. Two days, waiting for any sign that Cas was gonna be okay. "You know, it's kinda funny, man." Dean chuckled after Alex had left that afternoon. It was the first words he had managed to say since that first night, and they were mostly to himself. "Me watching over you like this? I used to get so pissed when you did this to me. I thought it was fucking creepy as hell, but I guess I kinda get it now." He let his head hang down, watching his own hands as he wringed them around. " It's comforting. I don't really know what's going on in that dome of yours, or if you're even aware that I'm here, but it's comforting to me. Seeing you breath and stuff. Knowing your alive. I don't think I would've been able to keep it together this long if I just left you in here. Not knowing if you were still breathing, still okay. So, yeah. I think I get it now."
I debated for a while on splitting it into two parts and leaving it here, for those who wanted to read a purely SPN fic or those who skipped this chapters and wanted all the fluff and no angst, but it felt unresolved. This is my warning that the two stories will be combined from now on. There will be fluff...there will be angst...but ultimately it should end happy if you wish to end it here and leave it open to your interpretation of what happened after this, that's great. Thank you for coming on this journey with me.üòò
Sam was still pissed, that was for sure, but Dean was madder. He took a step back as soon as Dean turned around with that look in his eyes. The one he wore when he was about to tear through a monster that had personally wronged him. He felt his heart leap to his throat, blocking the words that he tried to get out as Dean took a step closer. This was it. In the back of his mind, he always knew that Dean was going to be the one to kill him. Their own father had told him he had to. And why not now? They probably weren't gonna make it out alive this time any way. At least, this way, Sam would get to avoid the messy end. He probably wouldn't mean to do it. Sam was bigger, stronger, sure, but he was no match for his brother's blind rage. Dean was about to beat the ever-loving shit out of him. Except....was he laughing? He was. It wasn't a good laugh. It was the kind of laugh you hear walking passed the mental dorm of a high security prison. No, Dean wasn't gonna kill him. He had finally fucking lost it. "Dean.... I.. "
"Stand back, darling, I have to smash this, and I wouldn't want you to get a cut." She said.
Dean took another breath, a little steadier this time, and managed to get out a weak, "Where am I?"
Cas is upset he pushed Dean through the rift. He travels the world searching for him only to come up empty handed. Sam is depressed and felling hopeless until Rowena helps him see how Cas and Dean actually feel about each other. Cas tells Sam about his deal with the Empty and the two fight. Cas gets drunk and goes off to find Kaia to prove to Sam she wouldn't be willing to help them. We find out the origin of the mix tape and Kaia agrees to help. They set up an elaborate spell and Kaia and Cas get severely hurt in the process of trying to open another rift.
‚ÄúMy eyes don't get strained. I'm a bloody demon for Satan's sake.‚Äù Crowley mumbled under his breath as he proceeded to slip the glasses off, revealing his serpent like eyes. Dean had to bite his lip to keep himself from making a whip noise. He recognized a power play when he saw one. He decided, in that moment, that he really liked the angel as well.
"He is your friend, Dean." Cas said. "I wouldn't let harm come to someone you care about if I am able to prevent it. You say that he is trustworthy. I trust you."
"Oh, I really think you do, old man." Claire smirked back.
‚ÄúI've got this, Dad.‚Äù The boy smiled. ‚ÄúDon't worry.‚Äù
"Hey, uh...is ... how's Cas doing?" Dean asked awkwardly, shifting on his bed.
"WHY?!" He squeaked. She ignored him and began to speak a few foreign words before smashing the strange orb on the ground, another bright light bursting from inside and connecting itself to the one already there. "What is going on?!"
" Dean, we don't have time..."
" Oh, c'mon Dean it isn't that bad!" Sam said , straining to hold back his own laughter. "It could be worse! At least he's laughing about it!"
"And just where the hell have you been all night, young man?" Crowley smirked, leaning up against the door frame. "Your mother and I have been worried sick!"
"Yeah." Dean nodded, though all he really cared about was the ' going to bed' part. " Sounds great! Let's go." He got up off the couch without thinking and pulled Cas up with him.
" I didn't know I was invited." Cas replied, confused.
Dean and Crowley shard twin looks of skepticism, and they stood up and glanced back at the angel with a chorus of. ‚ÄúTotally.‚Äù ‚ÄúHilarious, really.‚Äù ‚ÄúReal barrel of laughs.‚Äù ‚ÄúCouldn't agree more.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you, Rowena‚Äù she smiled, then turned to Crowley and Aziraphale. ‚ÄúSee you two on the other side.‚Äù she nodded, then her and Adam stepped through.
"Wait what?" Sam whipped around to glare at Cas.
"Why?" Cas asked, lifting that damn sexy eyebrow.
‚ÄúWhat do we need?‚Äù Asked Sam, trying his damnedest to keep the tension between the two of them to a minimum.
Crowley straightened back up, barely suppressing a laugh, and he waved his hand out in front of him. "Lead the way."
‚ÄúAre you sure there's nothing I can get you gentlemen?‚Äù Anathema asks as she walks into the room, holding an empty plate in her hand.
"Why would he tell you to..."
The two of them laid like that for a while, clutched tightly in each other's arms. The room was dark, the only sound was their breathing. Eventually Cas pulled out of Dean(earning a low hiss in response) and rolled over beside him. He borrowed his head in the crook of the hunter's neck and swiped a hand over their bodies, cleaning them off with his grace. Dean wrapped his arms around the angel's shoulder pulling the blanket, that had gotten pushed off to the side of the bed during their escapades, around them.
The time spent alone in his room was sobering to say the least. After two hours, Dean began to wonder if maybe he was wrong about Cas forgiving him. Sam couldn't possibly still be up. He knew Mary was leaving tomorrow, and he'd want to be up in time to see her. Jack expended a lot of energy today and, with all the candy Cas had been sneaking him through diner, he had to have crashed out by now. So why had Cas not come? He couldn't still be mad. Dean's done stupider things before and Cas always forgave him.
I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
Amara smiled then and brushed her hand gently over Dean's cheek. "No. You couldn't have." She said. " I'm glad to know you are well, Dean. I will never forget you. And thank you, for everything, as well."
Couldn't resist Castiel's bee thing. Sorry not sorry.
Cas rolled his eyes and let out a sigh. "I think you forget Dean, that I am billions of years old. A few hours on the side of a road is nothing to me." Then he let a small smile slip on to his features. "Try not to read to much into it."
"I rather think it would be in best interest to do as I say. Wouldn't want you to end up like this door here would we?" He hissed.
‚ÄúYou do?‚Äù
The angel blade was set carefully in the center of the table in the back room next to a pair of white cotton gloves and surrounded by piles of books. ‚ÄúPlease, have a seat.‚Äù Aziraphale said as he picked up the gloves and slipped them on. ‚ÄúI have a few questions to ask you, Dean, if you don't mind. Before we can discuss finding a way to send you home, I was hoping you might provide me with some answers.‚Äù Dean nodded and the angel gently scooped up the blade and ran two fingers over the top of it. ‚ÄúFirst, I would like to know how you acquired this blade. I know you said you have an in with an angel, and you were kind enough to give us somewhat of a back story, however you said that your angel was called 'Cas'. This blade reads 'Hester'.‚Äù
"I don't know what else to do." Crowley sagged limply into the angel‚Äôs arms, Aziraphale dutifully wrapping his arms around him.
"Is that even a real question?" Aziraphale sighed exasperated.
"Seriously, man?" Sam chided "What were you up doing last night then? There's no way you slept in this late if you went to bed on time."
"Oh, please it's no more ridiculous than you!"
"Chill dude." Claire interrupted. "We've been over this. You're not my dad. You don't owe me anything. You don't have to keep trying to make all that up to me. I know you feel responsible for me or whatever but... don't. I'm an adult now. Just...be a friend...okay?"
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúAnd why would this entity be the one who gets to say whether or not you live or die?‚Äù
Rowena shook her head and dew a long nail down the wall. ‚ÄúThere are very few things that can contain power such as this. I don't know of anything that would.... unless....‚Äù  She paused and whipped around excitedly ‚ÄúAnathema, darling? Do you know what a Witch's Ball is?‚Äù
"Are you gonna drop this 'destiel' nonsense?" Dean inquired
"Jack kno‚Ä¶" Dean used his tounge to pull his bottom lip into his mouth and bit down hard as he took a sharp breath through his nose and looked up at the ceiling.
With another wave of the man's hand Dean crumpled to the ground, asleep. "That's enough of that!" The man said as he strolled past Dean. "Honestly, the mouth on that boy!" The man picked up the receiver of a rotary phone and began to dial. "I don't suppose I should expect anything less from an American though."
"Speak for yourself, Angel." Crowley yawned as he pushed back from the table. "I'm never one to turn down sleep when I can afford it. Besides,"  he smirked, "I shared my home with Dean while he was with us. It's only fair I give him the opportunity to return the favor. It's the least he can do."
"Aren't you?" Sam said angrily. "Only a coward runs away when things go sideways. If you were anything else, you would try to make things right."
‚ÄúIt said it wanted me to suffer.‚Äù Cas answered vaguely. When Dean didn't reply he let out a long sigh and continued. ‚Äú It said it would wait until I forgot about the whole thing. Wait until the moment I finally allowed myself to be truly happy...and then it would take me.‚Äù
"Then let's go home." Aziraphale said. "We have the means, we know the spell. This place is dangerous Crowley. I want to help these people as much as you do, but not if it comes at the cost of our lives. These people, those monsters...we can't do anything. This is way over our heads. Please. Let's just go home. "
Thanks again to everyone who chooses to continue subjecting themselves to my madness. Y'all are amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
"No." Gabriel groaned, rubbing his hand over his forehead. " Pretty sure they're not real big fans of me either after ditching out on Heaven and all." He sighed, closing his eyes as he rubbed harder. "What about Michael, or Raphael? It can't hurt to have another archangel on hand."
"I don't know, Dean. I just....."
"You can take your little apology..." Cas said quietly, before letting his smile slip completely, "and you cram it up your ass."
"You know...." came a weirdly calm and joyful voice from behind them as a piece of the ceiling crashed to the floor. They turned around to see the arch angel leaning casually against a pile of rubble with a lollipop in his mouth. He pulled the sucker out of his mouth with a pop and used it to gesture between the two of them. "I'm loving this dynamic you two crazy kids got going on here, really, I am, I'd love to see more of it, but we got kind of a situation going so..." The two of them stared at the angel before them, in awe of his caviler attitude, as the world literally fell apart around them. Another crash rang out behind them, another body slammed to the floor and words escaped them entirely. "Okay... introductions then..." He said popping the candy back into his mouth. "I'm Gabriel, archangel, trickster, porn star extraordinaire and judging by the fact that you look completely unfamiliar I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and say you're the snake that dicked over Adam and Eve in that other world, and the choir boy that's dicking him.....so we're good now yeah? Okay, so auntie Amara over there is running on empty and sooner or later and just so we're up to speed some one's gonna have to back her up sooner or later before we all turn into a pile of goo."
"I'm just trying to understand." Dean said, slamming a pack of chicken down on the counter. "Was it a language barrier or something? I know Cas had problems with slang there for a while." He sliced open the plastic and began pulling out the breasts, slicing down the middle of each before setting them aside. "Does 'can it' mean something different to you? Should I have said something a little more obvious, like 'keep your fucking mouth shut'?!"
"Yeah about that," Dean said, stuffing a couple of pieces of bacon from the plate Cas handed him into his mouth, "what's the deal? They ever going home or‚Ä¶"
Sam nodded and slowly pulled a knife from his pocket. He had given it to Jack to protect himself after Lucifer had eaten his grace. He looked down at his hands, twirling it back and forth between his fingers as he quietly reminisced about teaching him how to throw it, watching him slice his fingers every time he tried to open it quickly, seeing how proud he was the first time he managed it without a mistake. He had given it back to Sam the day after Michael had been destroyed. He had said he wouldn't need it anymore, that he could protect himself against anything on his own again. Sam gave the knife one final squeeze before handing bit over to Rowena. ‚ÄúHere, uh, this was his. He cut himself on it a couple times...it...uh...it should work.‚Äù
"I swear." Chuck insisted, hands up in surrender. "Looks like the power was inside you the whole time, Dorothy."
‚ÄúHow do you mean?‚Äù She asked.
"You're a real dick, ya know that?"
"Can't you just, I don't know, make your self unhappy or something?!" Dean asked. "Like, think of dead puppies or whatever?"
Castiel could tell Dean fighting a losing battle with his anger, but he was right. Now was not the time to be keeping secrets. "Jack knows about the deal. He was there when I made it." He told Dean.
"Go ahead." Dean smirked. "What's stopping ya?"
shoving them into his pockets.
"As much as I would love to see Dean turn that shade of red again," Marie winked "I actually do have to get going. I have to go help set up for an engagement party and....wait! Oh my God! You guys should come!"
"I can take care of Sam's injuries. Please...please get back to Dean. I...I need someone there with him...I need..." He sputtered to the other angel.
"How long have you..." Aziraphale asked, leaving the question open ended.
Sam clicked his tongue and smiled " Seems like you and Cas here are the most written about pairing on just about every forum we come across."
‚ÄúNo, you don't.‚Äù Crowley smirked sauntering behind him. Dean stuffed his hands in his pockets and ducked his head to hide his chuckle as he shuffled along behind them.
*****
"You should see the other guys." Dean chuckled as the angel jumped up to inspect each of them.
"Ugh!" Sam scoffed finishing his drink.
"Well, duh." Chuck chuckled. "Nobody's satisfied with their first draft. I mean you read enough Aziraphale, you should know that."
Cas bit his lip and shook his head. ‚ÄúIt hardly matters anyway. The Shadow said it would only come for me when I allowed myself to be truly happy...‚Äù
"Dean what are you..."
‚ÄúOw!‚Äù he laughed, rubbing the spot she hit. ‚Äú Sorry, you set yourself up for that one.‚Äù They both laughed for a while before stepping in for another brief hug. ‚ÄúI love you mom. Be careful, okay? Call is if you need anything and please let me know when you make it back.‚Äù
And they talked.
"Dean..."
They had the place warded and armed to the teeth.
He saw it as a small mercy that they were the only ones in the bunker at the time. The hunters from the other world, that hadn't already found a place of their own, were all out on various cases. At least the universe had granted him that ( he knew Chuck had nothing to do with it.)
"I'm fine." Cas grunted, dragging himself to his feet. "You have to fight it, Dean. Fight her!"
"You got it." Dean winked as he revved baby up and peeled out of the garage. It was about a half mile away from the bunker when they came upon the complete carnage that used to be the forest on the outskirts of Lebanon. "Jesus!" Dean cursed under his breath. "It looks like a bomb went off here. Maybe we should head back to the bunker and warn Sam about this."
‚ÄúNope. I'm sorry. It's just not how it works.‚Äù Aziraphale said with resolve.
Well, that went well. It wasn't a very descriptive word, he admitted but he really wasn't sure what else to call it. "Oh, you know, just..well a thing is all."
Adam nodded and gave him a small smile. ‚ÄúYou should've hidden your powers better. I understand though. The sad man and your brother probably miss you very much. I wouldn't want to be selfish.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Dean chuckled scratching the back of his head. He turned back around and hitched a thumb over his shoulder at Crowley and Aziraphale. ‚ÄúLook, these guys, they aren't like that, okay? I just fell into their laps, and they've done nothing but help me from the get go. They took me in and helped me get back. I swear. They aren't here to cause any trouble.‚Äù
"YOUR friends taught me a lesson. There are far too many uncertainties in life to spend it wasting time instead of doing the things that we are certain about. One of us could have a freak accident and be gone tomorrow. Why should we sit
Jack struggled against him, tears flowing freely now in his panic. "What about Sam and Dean?! What am I supposed to tell them?!"
Sam blew out a large breath and scrubbed his hands over his face, shaking his head. "Souls? He said souls were complicated, even for him. We built a would bomb once, to take out Amara, but we never got the chance to use it. We don't even know if it would have worked. It was hard enough trying to gather enough to even make it, I don't think building a soul cage would be any easier."
He quickly shook those thoughts from his mind. It's fine. It's gonna be okay. They were gonna figure out a way to fix it. To fix everything. Because Cas deserved to be happy, dammit. Dean deserved to be happy. They all did. And he would be damned if anything was gonna stand in their way this time. That was his final thought as he drifted off into a dreamless sleep, for the first time in days.
"Of course," Cas smiled, but his eyes flickered back to the same direction as before, almost to quick to notice. " There is nothing here I require."
"That I should block them out or keep them to myself." Patience said petulantly. "Sorry, miss Jody."
"Okay, if you say so, Dean."
"I'm afraid there's nothing I can do." Cas replied.
"Well," Aziraphale said glancing over at Crowley, "I don't see the harm in staying a few more hours. "It would be pointless to open up the shop in so late in the morning and travel does tend to make one peckish."
"Don't worry Dean." Sam huffed. "He's not dead. Though I'm pretty sure he wishes he was. I don't know where he is, but he's alive and, by my guess, pretty fucking miserable, so ..safe." Dean turned to Sam again, a million questions filling his eyes. "The Shadow told him it wanted him to suffer like it did when Cas woke it up. Said it wanted him to know what it was like to feel true happiness and peace, so it could be the one to rip it away. Guess you beat it to the punch."
"I wasn't." Sam scoffed, downing his drink.
Dean rolled his eyes and nugded Cas's shoulder with his own. " Just shut up and watch....wait... NO!" He tried to cover the angel's eyes from what was happening on the screen but failed.
"Hmm." Mary had her lips pressed together and her arms crossed, a doubtful look in her eyes.
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Dean crouched down in front of him, so he could look him in the eye, ‚Äú I've had a real good time hanging out with you. You're really cool, and crazy smart. I wish I could stay here and get to know you better, but I gotta get to back to my world. My family needs me. I wasn't smart like you. I spent my whole life saving people and now I gotta go be a superhero.‚Äù
"It wasn't a zombie." Sam laughed. "It's almost never a zombie."
"You can't destroy souls, Chuck. You can make them, and you can send them away, but you can't get rid of them, not completely. Believe me I've tried."
Dean was heart broken. He was being selfish, he knew that he was. But hearing his thoughts told to him...by Cas...seeing that look of betrayal and hurt on the angel's face...Cas knew. He knew the whole time. The guilt had finally taken its toll on on Dean. He felt his eyes well up with tears as he lowered his head and scratched the back of it, fighting with himself to find the right words. "Cas, I... I'm so sorry....I just..."
"Dean?"
Um bo bo
"What?" They both replied, mouths full of food.
"No." Chuck shook his head. "She wouldn't do that. She wouldn't..."
Cas shot him a quick, guilty, glance before looking back down at his feet. "I‚Ä¶I wanted to. I intervened once, before Jack could find out that I had come looking for you. After that one time‚Ä¶.we agreed it was best to let you live your lives without us getting in the way. You deserved to be free of our interference."
"Do I?" She asked coldly. "Apparently last time I helped you it didn't serve you well at all."
Cas gave him a weak half smile in return, before tilting his head back towards the ceiling and closing his eyes again. "Hello, Dean." He sighed, just before falling back to sleep.
Dean and Sam exchanged a pained look, instantly recognizing the music. It was the instrumental to 'The Road So Far' from the play. Cas however seemed enthralled by what was playing on the screen, not recognizing the music at all.
Dean sighed and shook his head, setting his coffee and book on the night stand. "I'm not pissed at Sam. I'm pissed at the situation. It was our only option, and he knew that. It's not his fault things went sideways."
" Right!" Dean chucked nervously and scratched the back of his head. "Guess I forgot."
‚ÄúIt's not her fault, Dean.‚Äù Adam interrupted. ‚ÄúShe really did try, but I was too fast for her.‚Äù
" What the hell are you?" Dean screeched as soon as he felt his voice return. "Are you some kind of fucking witch? A Djinn? Are you one of Michael‚Äôs freaks? Where the fuck am I?! I need to get back right the fuck no...."
"Excuse me for being realistic." Sam retorted.
"What's this?"
"And if it doesn't?" Rowena said from behind. They both turned to face her, as she stood cradling the Book of the Damned in her arms. "Face facts here, Samuel. The creatures of the night may be at heel, but you have yet to come up with a plan to trap God."
Sam looked at him with pity in his eyes and took a deep breath. "Dean, if you're worried about Cas...."
"No, I've always been rebellious." Cas assured.
Mary sighed and gave her son a sad smile. " I want to talk, Dean." she replied. "Sam explained to me what was going on. I just want to talk about what happened out there."
Cas nodded and turned his gaze back to Dean. "You're right. Though I would expect it should come as somewhat of a relief to you. "
Cas apparently shared the same sentiment. He grabbed Dean's wrist urging him to release his girl and moved to work at Dean's button and zipper. He pushed Dean onto his back and began leaving kisses down his body, removing his pants as he went. When his head made it to the hunter's crotch, he licked the slit of Dean's dick before moving to place kisses down his inner thighs. He was moving painfully slow. By the time his head disappeared behind the bed Dean was panting. He wasn't sure how so little was affecting him so much, his only guess was because it was coming from Cas. When the Angel reappeared on the bed from the floor, he was also fully undressed. He laid back down on his and pulled Dean in close, one hand gripping the back of his head the other pulling him by the hip until their bodies were flush. He placed his lips over Dean's and moved his hand from the hunter's hip, gripping them both before swiping a thumb over the head of each of their leaking cocks and began to pump.
He headed to the library, grabbing a peice of paper and a pen on his way and sat down. 'This is just stupid.' He thought to himself as he wrote down the words 'On the Head of a Pin'. He heard the bunker door open. Dean walked up, the look on his face telling Sam that it was time for his ass- chewing, so he decided to cut it off before it could start.
Petrichor. Cas once told him that is what the smell of rain is called. That was the smell that was filling his nose as he felt the angel's lips move firmly against his own. Petrichor and fresh soil and grass and wind and lighting and wood and honey and home. It was home. The feel of Cas's firm grip on his jaw, the strong, secure grasp of his hand on Dean‚Äôs waist, the sure, confident movements of his mouth, the sharp sting of his teeth against Dean's lower lip before being soothed by the slick warmth of his tongue. Cas was home. It was the strongest feeling swirling through the storm of emotions raging through Dean. Home. It wasn't until Cas moved away enough to let Dean breath, that what had just happened came crashing forward. "You absolute DICK!" Dean growled as soon as he caught his breath. A strange feeling of both anger and amusement flaring up inside of him that he wasn't entirely sure was his own.
He stopped by his room, pulling all the keys from his pockets and locking them
Dean smiled over at Cas who was drying his hands on a dish towel. He set the towel down and walked over to Dean, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling him in for a small kiss. ‚ÄúYou didn't have to do that, ya know?‚Äù Dean mumbled, ignoring the groan from Sam. ‚ÄúI could've taken care of it.‚Äù
I only have a couple more chapters before the end now. Thank you so much for your continued support.
My editing app is refusing to accept Cas and Aziraphale as names. I try my best to go through and correct it when it changes them to Case, Cash or Airplane but I might miss a few. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you catch it. I am but a betaless writer, trying their best to make their work readable.
"Dean, I understand...."
Cas placed his hands on Dean's shoulders and held him there at arm's length searching his eyes. ‚ÄúNo, Dean. I'm sorry. You were right. I was being stupid and selfish. You had every right to be upset.‚Äù
"Dean," Sam shouted up at his brother " Wait! We didn't even tell you what toppings we want."
******
"Nothing." He shrugged. " I just never imagined you were this repressed. You humans are so hung up on gender and sexuality. It really is quite astounding."
Cas and Dean venture into the Darkness
"No offense, auntie Am, but you're not exactly most likely to be named homecoming queen of the sky kingdom." Gabe laughed. "You did quite a bit of damage up there, and last time I checked you fit in more with the ...evil variety. They don't take to kindly to your type."
Dean clapped his hand over heart and gasped. "I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me." He mocked. " Really, it was nothing, guys. But thanks for the ego boost."
"Those two fight for humanity." Meg continued. " Without human souls, you and me are out of business. They tried to lock me and mine away to keep us from corrupting those souls and let's face it, less business for us means more for you. Are you idiots really so blind that you can't see the bigger picture here? The Winchester's are good. Last time I checked, that's the kind of stuff that's supposed to tickle your jollies. Now you can either shut up and let him explain or you can go one living in your butt hurt little world but know this:" she paused, her eyes flashing black as night as her smile grew even more wicked. "I will personally make sure every second you spend here for the rest of eternity will be a living hell."
"Because this time it's God!" Castiel barked coming to a pause. "Our father abandoned us, left us to our own devices with nothing but a vague promise of righteousness, left us to rot. He left us without choice, and this is our chance to make him atone for his mistakes."
" Yeah, not a Demon anymore, kid!" Dean said wiping his face dry.  "Why is it always holy water? Why doesn't anyone throw salt or say 'Christo' anymore?"
"Did Castiel put you up to this?" She interrupted.
******
Cas stopped at the top of the stairs, holding on to the railing with a white-knuckle grip. "Why do you care?"
"Got anything besides hard candy and Rolaids a girl can eat stashed away in this thing?" Claire smirked.
Dean let his eyes open, finally, his blurred vision registering cold, angry eyes that were the wrong shade of blue, so different from the ones he met before he closed them. "I saved him." He said, his voice shallow and weak. It was about damn time too. He thought about all the times Cas had pulled his ass out of the fire. Sure, Dean had been there to patch him up, but he always had help. Cas had risked everything to fight for Dean's life, because he loved him. It was about damn time Dean did the same. So, he did. He just laid everything on the line to pull Cas out of the fire.
A pair of golden, black tipped wings suddenly blocked Sam and Dean's view, spreading out high and wide as Jack's voice boomed above them. "You will leave the Winchester's Alone!"
"Screw your stupid deal, Cas!" Dean shouted back.
"Okay." Amara nodded. "Okay, I'll do it."
"No, no, look, will you just listen! Like for once?‚Äù Gabriel snapped. "When Mikey was here, he pumped a bunch of monsters full of Grace. That's half the battle! If me and the kid can figure out how to drain the monster part out and pump more angel juice in...."
"Got something you wanna share with the class P?" Alex said, putting her fork down on her empty plate.
time." He pulled a chair over to the stairs then grabbed Mary and sat her down. "I need you to stay right here and guard the door. No one in, no one out! Got it?" He pulled a gun from under the table and placed it in her hand.
‚ÄúDo you honestly think we aren't going to walk you through?‚Äù Aziraphale interrupted. ‚ÄúIt's the least we can do.‚Äù
‚ÄúOK...‚Äù that kind of made sense Dean guessed. He had heard Cas describe angels as 'Wavelengths of Celestial Intent' a few times. He knew there were some angels who took both male and female vessels. It was just kinda hard to think in those terms. There were dudes and chicks. That's what he grew up knowing. Still, Crowley wasn't answering any of his questions.  ‚ÄúBut, what I mean is, do you like, love him or whatever?‚Äù
"Jack chose me as his father before he was born." Cas sighed irritability. "I don't have time to explain all of this. Will you help us or not?"
"I don't wanna feel like this anymore." He choked out.
who he was dealing with. He kept his hand in the handle and dropped his forehead to the door. "So, is this your plan? You just gonna hide out in there forever?"
"Great." Dean shrugged. " Then we'll ask their help. Later. When all of us can be there. Can...Can we please just take this one cosmic plane at a time?"
‚ÄúYou're sure you wouldn't have preferred me in a female vessel?‚Äù He burrowed further against Dean's chest.
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
‚ÄúGetting along?‚Äù Crowley scoffed. ‚ÄúWith him? Never.‚Äù
"He did." Aziraphale nodded, encouraging Sam to continue.
Dean laughed and shook his head. Classic cas, not understanding the meaning of a common phrase. "Alright, then phase one complete. Target aquired. Onto phase two. Wooing."
Sam and Dean shared a look, each of them sure that the angel was probably right. Dean chuckled, trying his best to lighten the mood. "Well then, I guess it's up to us to repopulate the world." Cas and Sam both glared at him, before Sam started laughing himself. Cas, however, still looked rather unamused. "What? What else are we supposed to do." Cas narrowed his eyes further and turned away. "Oh, C'mon Cas, what are you worried about? It's not like every sexual encounter you have is gonna end with the chick sticking you like a pig. If that were the case, I'd have been dead years ago."
"I'm done waiting for people to give me things." Cas smirked before raising his hand to Dean's cheek placing his face against the other. "I take what I want now." He growled into Dean's ear. Cas placed a gentle kiss on his cheek at the same time a small surge of Grace pulsed through his veins.
Aziraphale sighed and rolled his eyes. "There are more important things to worry about right no, than your bruised ego."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sorry, Jack." Mary said patting him on the shoulder. " Still, a little too much information."
They had pulled up to a Mexican restaurant that was about halfway between the arcade and the bunker. Mary had said she always drove past it and wanted to try it out. Dean spent most of the ride avoiding the teasing glances from Sam. He didn't regret getting something for Cas, but he was starting to wish he had waited to give it to him when no one else was around. It all came to a head when they got out of the car, Cas with his bee in hand.
"I don't like this Castiel." Jack shook his head. "You told me demons can't be trusted, I don't understand why you would...."
"Oh, you think so?" Dean snarked. "Cuz I got a demon killing blade here with your name written all over it, pal."
"Meg!" Cas chided. "There are more important things to discuss right now and I'd appreciate if you would refrain from such subjects in front of Jack."
1: I know Dean doesn't sob. He gets angry. I also know that he has put up with 36 years of complete and utter bull shit and, as strong as he is, a man can only take so much. I can't be the only one who's noticed he seems to be breaking easier lately. And losing Cas, again...well that would do it.
As soon as they got in the room, Sam and Dean started rummaging through their duffles bags for their pyjamas. It really had been a long day and neither of them felt like wasting time, after the play was over, to get undressed. This way they could just pop it in, get it over with and go to sleep. Meanwhile, Cas stood awkwardly in the corner holding the bag of various snacks for Dean.
Jack lit up like a Christmas tree. "Are you sure?!"
Sam looked over at Rowena, who was sitting, ramrod straight, looking at Castiel, paralyzed in fear. She had experienced the wrath of an angel before, and he knew that Cas throwing a hissy fit would be enough to knock any sense of confidence right out of her. Hopeless as they were, the three of them were probably all that each other had left anymore and now was not the time to create a divide between them. ‚ÄúDude! Calm...‚Äù
*****
‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Dean grumbled as he walked to the other side of the car and got in.
"You're a child." Dean croaked back, mostly on reflex.
"Why not?" Chuck seethed.
‚ÄúCas listen...‚Äù Sam felt like the room was spinning. Nothing made sense anymore. He couldn't risk losing the angel as an anchor. Not now. He couldn't watch someone lose their faith again. ‚Äú We can find a way to bring him back. I don't know how but, please, you can't give up. We'll...‚Äù
Cas's hand reached out and grabbed him by the wrist, stopping him. "You need to rest, Dean." He used his best authoritative tone, the one that sent shivers up Dean's spine and made him almost impossible to argue with. Almost.
‚ÄúI'm sure Dean has seen much worse.‚Äù Aziraphale dismissed as he kept walking. ‚ÄúHe's been to Hell and back after all. I hardly think it will disturb him. I wouldn't want you to hurt your eyes, straining to see in the dark.‚Äù
"It is you!" Susie gleefully confirmed "I almost didn't recognize you without your uniforms! It's been what, four years now? I hope nothing too terrible has brought you up this way. Though, if the FBI is here I suppose it must be serious. You know I haven't even heard anything on the news...but then I suppose I don't pay that much attention to the news anyway..."
Sam was right of course. He had said that and, although the prospect of making some broad regret her life decisions did sound a little appealing, it wasn't nearly as good as the thought of continuing to explore what he had started with Cas. "Yeah, well, mom's only gonna be in town a couple more days." Dean explained. "I figure we might as well all spend as much time as possible together while we got the chance. I can get laid any day of the week. A few more nights won't hurt."
Poor Sam. They had made such progress over the years. They had become even closer, they had become genuinely happy. It was a bittersweet realization what had happened. He must have gotten into a terrible wreck on his way to meet his nephew. He felt awful that he had died the night the baby was born, but there was nothing he could do about it now. He hoped his brother would forgive him.
"I mean, don't get us wrong, it is a little disappointing." Siobhan answered. "With the musical being when we realized we were in love with each other and all. How perfect would that be, am I right? But after actually meeting you....not really a big shock." She smiled up at the men, a hint of sadness behind her eyes.
His eyes tracked upwards from the large, dull, black boots covered by the cuff of wrinkled suit pants, to the ends of the tattered, tan coat. He followed that trail all the way to the backwards blue tie sitting over the loose, white dress shirt when a flash of black off to the side of the broad chest caught his eye. His gaze immediately shot upward to the expansive mass of feathers, the color of an oil spill glistening in the sunlight, trickled down from wings expanding at least twenty feet out, over a mussy brown tuft of hair. He finally let himself gaze upon the face of the angel standing tall amongst the rubble and felt his heart stop.
"So?"
‚ÄúThat's Kaia.‚Äù Dean told him. ‚ÄúShe has been helping us out for a while now. She's from a different world too. ‚ÄúAdam‚Äôs eyes grew large as he took in the information that there were even more worlds out there with even more aliens on them. Dean let him soak it up for a minute before pointing over to Rowena. ‚ÄúAnd the small woman? That's Rowena. She's a witch. Kind of like Anathema.‚Äù
"Oh, before I forget!" Aziraphale said turning to Newt and grabbing his hand to shake it. "Congratulations on the engagement, Mr. Pulsifer. You have a fine woman. She will make an excellent wife. I do expect an invitation."
Rowena had a chair set up in the middle of the room facing away from the door. ‚ÄúNow Kaia, dear,‚Äù she said, leading the girl to the chair ‚Äúyou will be sitting here. Once the spells have been cast, Sam and I will retreat just beyond the door. I figured it would be best to have the opening as far from the door as possible, that way if anything charges through, we all can escape quickly and lock it in.‚Äù
'Damnit.' Cas thought to himself.
Silence. "Oh, yes, right. I suppose you'll need your voice to answer me, then." The man waved his hand again.
‚ÄúI best be getting you home, now Adam. ‚ÄúAnathema said grabbing the boy's arm. ‚ÄúYour mother will be terribly worried.‚Äú
Sam and Cas talk about Kaia
"There were robots Sam, in space!"
The noise Cas made in response could only be described as a literal growl, the dim lights in the dark room flickering around them. "Cool it, Cas." Dean whispered behind him, pulling tighter on the angel's sleeve. Cas's head snapped back to glare at him, his eyes glowing with Grace. "Not the time."
"Stop." Dean half shouted, causing Sam to jump. He took a breath and tried again, a little calmer. "Stop, Sam. Just‚Ä¶stop. There's nothing you could have done."
Cas's jaw clenched tight at Sam's words, as he moved dangerously close into the hunter's space. "Now is not the time for these petty arguments." He snarled in Sam's face. "We have more important matters to attend to. "
"That doesn't frighten you?"
‚ÄúTomorrow morning actually. ‚ÄúShe replied carefully. ‚ÄúI'm sorry do you mind telling me what this is regarding? He's not in trouble again, is he? Whatever he did, I promise...‚Äù
"Speak for yourself, Angel." Crowley said teasingly "You won't be the one providing room and board. I'm not a bloody B&B!"
"Oh I'm in." Meg nodded. "Any chance to stick it to the big man himself. " She stepped up to Cas and put a hand on his shoulder. "Besides, I can't pass up the chance to shake the hand of my competition in person."
Siobhan turned and placed her forehead against Kristen's "And I, you Krissy. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you." Their kiss was interrupted by the sound of metal tinking against glass.
"We would love to fill you in on the details some other time, but I'm afraid we really must be going." Aziraphale said.
"Naomi told me they had to rewire me several times. I suppose that's why they gave me my own garrison to command. To keep me out of trouble."
The last thing he saw, was a fury of power as Amara's arm shot out towards him, before he found himself tumbling to the floor of the bunker's library.
"Let me out!"
‚ÄúWell where else are you going to sleep? In the bin out back?‚Äù Crowley scoffed. ‚ÄúYes, you're coming back to my place.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat are you getting at?‚Äù Sam asked.
Hopefully I'll have everything posted ( should only be a chapter {possibly two short ones} and the  epilogue) before tomorrow night. So excited for this episode! 1 month is too long to wait
They left the 'Dean Cave', everyone saying their separate 'goodnights' and headed off to their own separate rooms. Even Cas, much to Dean's dismay. Without so much as a word to Dean. He closed his door and went over to his dresser mind reeling. Had he done something wrong? Maybe he read the whole situation in the closet earlier the wrong way. Maybe Cas really did just see him as family. It had probably been years since the guy got laid, probably not since that fucking reaper. Maybe Dean had just confused him. That's why he really stopped when Dean got too excited, he finally came to his fucking senses.
Aziraphale smiled back at him sweetly. "So, if you're the king of Hell, what would that make me?"
"Dean...I..." Cas's words came out in a reverent whisper, echoing in Dean's ears, ripping him apart knowing they were the last thing he would ever hear his angel say.
‚ÄúIt's a good thing, Adam.‚Äù Aziraphale assured.
‚ÄúWhat did I order?‚Äù Dean asked.
"I still don't understand why this is my fault." Crowley pouted.
Dean just smiled and shook his head. ‚ÄúWhere did you even learn all that?‚Äù
"Oh, tons!" Jack smiled eagerly. "Grandma Mary taught me how to shoot an AK."
"Dean, I know I messed up. That is why I spent the last three years trying to fix my mistakes. I will never forgive myself for having a hand in making your life miserable. It is why I agreed to stay out of your life after Jack brought me back. I‚Ä¶I know what I said to you‚Ä¶I didn't want to make things‚Ä¶I'm sorry‚Ä¶if you want I can leave you in peace here as well‚Ä¶"
‚ÄúWhy not?!‚Äù Aziraphale scoffed. ‚ÄúMy dear, we just finished fighting our own apocalypse. I don't know about you but I believe one 'end of days' is enough for a lifetime. This world is dangerous, Crowley.‚Äù
"Hey, guys heads up." Jody's voice came through the speaker, cutting Claire off. "Patience, says we have a pretty massive hoard up a head, so stay on your toes. We might have a fight a head of us."
‚ÄúYep.‚Äù Adam nodded proudly. ‚ÄúAnd you, the tall man with lady's hair.‚Äù He said pointing at Sam ‚ÄúYou're Dean's brother, right?‚Äù
"Jesus, Cas, a little blunt the man." Dean said nudging him.
" ‚Ä¶and I would never ask you to give the damn thing up. They make you happy and I genuinely enjoy your happiness. I'm just asking you to share that happiness with me." Crowley finished.
This chapter is pretty short. I didn't realize that at first, but now that I do I'm glad I didn't post it alone.
"I'm peachy." Dean snarked. " Nothing like having to attend my mother's funeral. Twice." He felt Cas tense beneath his fingers at the mention of Mary, but kept his gaze locked on her. It was still something they hadn't fully discussed yet, but now wasn't the time.
Some time towards the end of the night, Cas and Marie had disappeared. Sam and Dean didn't think much of it until Cas had returned holding a DVD case like it was the most precious thing on Earth. " What ya got there, Cas?" Sam asked.
Castiel held out his hand and shook hers firmly " Nice to meet you. I'm agent Be...." Dean shoved his elbow into the angel's side to cut him off. He had to quit calling himself agent Beyonce.
"Castiel." Chuck gasped, looking as confused as Dean felt.
"Absolutely." Crowley said in a serious tone. Aziraphale smiled then, kissing the demon on the cheek and continuing on their way. "Would you?" Crowley asked after a while
Dean loved him.
"Why?" Dean scoffed. "What's up? You put us on some cupcake mission and you don't want the others to get pissy?" He smirked
"I like this one Cassie." Gabriel whispered in his ear. "She's spicy."
Dean had been brooding in his room for an hour, before he heard a knock on his door. " Go away." he mumbled. He didn't feel like being anywhere near his family right now.
"Please, Angel!" Crowley rolled his eyes. " I can hardly handle being gone over you! I'm not adding some human to the mix. Calm yourself. Jealousy is a dreadful color on you."
"Like, mine specifically?" Claire chuckled. " Or just in general? Cuz I gotta tell you Castiel, in case you haven't been paying attention, I'm pretty sure everyone's life is kinda the same right now. Bloody." Cas furrowed his brows in embarrassment and kept his eyes on the road, prompting Claire to break into laughter. " Relax, dork! I'm teasing you. I'm good. Up until recently, things have been going pretty well. I had some trouble working through some stuff, but you know me. I can bounce back."
"I told you from the beginning, that this was a dangerous plight." Aziraphale said casually, as he licked his finger to turn the page. "You're the one who insisted that we had no other choice but to at least try." Crowley replied with an annoyed huff, tilting his head back to stare straight at the wall in front of him. "How is he?" Aziraphale asked after a while.
Dean's head shook itself, his eyes refusing to open, knowing that everything he ever wanted, everything he needed and was too stupid to know that he already had wouldn't be on the other side of the safety of his closed lids.
"Crowley?" Dean smiled. "Yeah I do. He's a really good guy, Sam. He helped me out a lot when I was with them, and not just by letting me crash with him either. He's just misunderstood, is all. He's just a really cool guy."
üé∂Now listen, when you say your body's aching?
"No?" Crowley quirked an eyebrow. "Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe we had a discussion about angels being genderless. Loving your angel wouldn't make you gay, or bi, though that is something we'll have to discuss later, or anything else it is you seem to be afraid of being called. It would just be you...in love...with an angel...which you are."
Garth and his family agreed to heading one of the other bunkers, using their beliefs to teach more werewolves, among other, more peaceful monsters, their way of life. Jody, Donna and Bobby agreed that it was time for them to hang up their hats and use their knowledge to train the next generation of hunters. Rowena was elated at the thought of creating her own coven of witches, good or otherwise, as long as Patience, Alex and Sam (a fact that Dean would go on to be suspicious of for a while) stayed under her tutelage. At the end of the day, after all the brainstorming and discussions, the Winchester's, the angels, and the mischievous demon felt like they could use just a bit more time together before they said their goodbyes.
"What are you talking about?" Sam asked, finally finding his voice.
I know I initially said I would update once, maybe twice a week, and I don't want to get too ambitious, but....it may be a little more frequently. Mainly because these chapters are taking up A LOT of space on my phone which is making editing a nightmare ( no space means slow apps). Anyway.... Here's a chapter about fanfiction.
"We're your children..." Aziraphale shook his head.
He had to be dead, because it wouldn't start back up again. He had to be dead, because suddenly he couldn't breathe. He had to be dead, because there was no way in Heaven, Hell, or on Earth that this was...
" Relax, Dean." Sam rested his hand on his brother's shoulder. "It's not like they know we're real people. To them, we're just characters from a series of books. Like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. They're just adding their own flair to the stories they like. It's harmless."
"What about me?"
"I don't care!" Dean said, pushing against Crowley, trying to get past. " I have to tell him I'm sorry."
Cas's head tilted as his eyes squinted to the point of being almost closed. "I have known the Winchester's for a long time now. Dean may not be as apt at things that require significant brain power as Sam is..."
"Was." Bobby replied, getting Dean's attention. "Now I'm not. That kid of yours, before he went‚Ä¶ where ever‚Ä¶made some changes here. Busted my ass out, and then he‚Ä¶well he‚Ä¶set some thing's right."
"That's not really our place." Crowley said, shaking his head.
"Patricide."
"Make a list." He spoke in a commanding tone, wings flaring out above his head. "We have an army to build."
"Somebody has to." Aziraphale smiled. "Your quite useless on your own." He leaned into the touch, letting the demon‚Äôs hair brush against his cheek. " You've been rather affectionate lately, is there a reason?"
"Hmm." Cas nodded thoughtfully, sliding his hand under Dean's shirt, along his side. "And other times?"
Because that angel, was no longer alive.
Cas tilted his head and nodded. "I'll need to split them into groups, it would be most effective to attack from all sides. I want my most trusted in charge of each faction. It will be you, Gabriel, Gadreel, Inias and Balthazar at the lead"
‚ÄúWhoa, there lady!‚Äù Dean balked. ‚ÄúI'm desperate to get home and all but I ain't bleeding no kid!‚Äù
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know." Cas replied, tilting his head to give Dean more access.
"What kind of monster you've always been." Crowley added bitterly.
"Well isn't that a neat little trick." She gleamed, whipping more flames into her hand.
Cas tried to school his face and failed miserably before opting to gaze out the window instead. "While there do seem to be a few factions that agree with you, the general consensus is quite the opposite."
"It's nothing, Cas." Sam said, ushering him towards the door. "It's what families do. We take care of each other."
‚ÄúJack's life was far more important than my own.‚Äù Cas argued. ‚ÄúIf not for him the world would currently be under Michael‚Äôs reign, Lucifer would be running free and who knows what else could've happened if I had simply let him go. He had been far more helpful in his short time on Earth than I ever was.‚Äù
******
" Hey, uh, Cas..." About a million questions crossed the hunter's mind at that moment, but he settled on the one that had been nagging him most of the night. "back at the party, in the theater...what uh...what made you cry..."
"I wouldn't judge you."
"Yeah, keep telling yourself that, Dean." Sam scoffed. "Whatever helps you sleep at night. Honestly, I don't think anyone could be happy if they cared about you the way he does."
"YOU WHAT?!" Dean shouted.
There had to be a way to get a way to get Dean back. There wasn't another option at this point. He couldn't let either of them suffer like this. But Cas was right. It was hopeless. Jack was gone. The archangels were all dead. Even if they weren't there was no way to be sure they could even get to the right universe in time. Everything was over. There was nothing they could do. There was no one else who could possibly open a rift...
"Couldn't you try again?" Aziraphale argued. "Perhaps if you explained to her what's at stake ..."
"Rowena." The witch said gently pushing herself away and dusting herself off. "McLeod. A pleasure." She sneered.
Crowley stared at the angel for a bit. He took his glasses off, setting them on the bed side table, and pinched the bridge of his nose. "We can't leave. Not yet. I'm sorry."
Sam and Cas looked at each other with absolute fear in their eyes. They were both silent for a while, until Sam let out a long breath, pushed back his hair and started shuffling away. ‚ÄúI... I think Dean may have some pictures and stuff from when we were kids in his room.‚Äù Sam said as he backed into the hallway.
"Lord Crowley!" Said one demon nervously as all of them (except one) scrambled to their feet from their poker game at the table. "To what do we owe the honor..."
Dean had, somewhat of a plan. He really did. It wasn't his fault that it got derailed the second he discovered Cas wasn't actually in his room. That's where Aziraphale and Crowley told him that he would be. So, really, it was their fault that he was currently running through the halls of the bunker like a maniac. Emotions were high and it was a little more than obvious, that wasn't when Dean's brain power functioned at its highest. In hindsight, he realized that basically drifting around each corner wasn't the safest, but it's not like he planned to run into Claire full speed, effectively Knocking her on her ass.
"c'mere." He mumbled down at his chest, motioning to Cas with his head.
‚ÄúWhat did I say, Sam?‚Äù Cas mumbled as he walked away. ‚ÄúIt's hopeless.‚Äù
Castiel straightened back up and looked her dead in the eyes. ‚ÄúI assure you. The implications of what would happen if someone were to harm the Impala are much more severe than his animosity towards me regarding his mother's death.‚Äù
It was a terrible lie, Aziraphale knew. It was clear that apprehension was not what was causing the seraph's sour mood. Even Sam was able to sense that.
"I know." Cas said, confidence wavering slightly. " I know that it was my own mistakes that brought is here, but I assure you..."
oh, I think I saw you in my sleep darling
Crowley rolled his eyes and made a grab for the angel‚Äôs sleeve again. "Right, of course, because human beings have the capability of logical thinking in times of turmoil." Aziraphale pulled his sleeve from his grasp again, fixing him with a determined glare. "You've seen it yourself, Angel. You've seen how far their kind will go to win wars. They will stop at nothing!"
"Because I love him." Dean said, cutting the angel off. They both were silent, staring at Dean in shock. "Yeah, no shit." Dean scoffed plopping himself down on the bed. He scrubbed his hands over his face, listening to the deafening silence that filled the room. "If you're waiting for some kinda big gay freak out or something you can cool it. That happened like twenty years ago." He lifted his head to see the two of them still frozen in place with the same expressions of shock plastered on their faces. "I told you guys, I may be dumb, but I'm not a complete fucking idiot! I know what my feelings are."
‚ÄúKeep going Adam,‚Äù Anathema urged, ‚ÄúIt's working!‚Äù
"Uh, yeah‚Ä¶" Sam said, standing up and grabbing her duffle off the bed.
"It means that I will be available to you, for whatever you require of me." Cas said. " As soon as this is over, we can go our separate ways. I promise not to be a burden to you any longer than necessary. I'm only sorry I couldn't make my bargain for Jack's soul a little more binding, so that it would be possible for you to be rid of me sooner, more permanent."
"Why is it so hard for you to accept that I'm not?" He replied, placing the empty plate in the sink
Mary just shook her head in resignation "I never said he wasn't. I was just a little confused on the extent."
Dean chuckled and sat down next to Cas patting him on the back. "It's not like you could've done anything to stop it, Cas. None of us could. We're as helpless as you are here. They all knew the risks going into this. It's bad out there, man. We're all kinda flying by the seat of our pants, and hoping for the best."
Aziraphale sighed and shook his head. ‚ÄúAs you can imagine, I am not exactly in good standing with Heaven, at the moment. I doubt they'd do anything I would request from them. They'd be more likely to try to kill me than anything, for even suggesting such a notion, I'm afraid.‚Äù
Sam reached across the table and placed his hand over Mary's. "Mom it's fine. We know, okay? We made peace with all of that years ago. Besides, Dad apologized when he was here. How many people can say that they actually got closure with their dead father? Really, mom. We're fine."
"Well I don't." Dean grunted. " I'll track him down after Cas wakes up and talk to him."
Dean snatched the tape out of the player and threw it back at Cas, fixing Crowley with a vicious glare "Oh, you are so dead when all this is over!"
‚ÄúAs I'll ever be.‚Äù Dean replied, closing his eyes.
‚Äú And what would you two like?‚Äù she asked, when it came time for Dean to order. ‚Äú How should I know?‚Äù Dean grunted ‚Äú I'm not his keeper.‚Äù He handed her the menu, without even looking at it. ‚ÄúJust get me a number six, will ya sweetheart?"
"Oh, no." Aziraphale said gravely. "He's made attempts, let me assure you. The first day or so it was nothing but screaming. Then, rather crafty attempts at bargaining. At one point the box was levitating almost to the ceiling before crashing to the floor. We think he was trying to break it, but the box held strong. It seems as though his final act of arrogance, his thinking that he could destroy us all before we managed to lock him away, ended up being his demise, as arrogance usually always is."
Dean swallowed again, and closed his eyes. "I told you. Jack's sacrifice, Cas's‚Ä¶they mean nothing if we don't  try to live the best lives we can. We owe it to them to try."
"Precisely!" Balthazar beamed. "This man is willing to work with demons." He nodded towards Meg. "He has defied death, several time over. He has fought against Lucifer, and Michael. Hell, he stood toe to toe with Fate. He gets what he wants and will kill anyone that stands in his way when he believes what he is doing is right. He has always fought for the greater good, and I can't think of a better person to lead us in a fight against God himself. If blind determination isn't the best quality to have in a leader, then I don't know what is."
Much to Dean's delight the arcade happened to be the kind that had a mini Cafe. He totally forgot to eat before they had left, so while the others were getting their tokens he gorged himself on the stale chips and squeeze cheese the place was passing off as nachos. He sat and watched the others as he downed his slush-puppy. It was nice. Sam was showing Mary one of the virtual-reality games they had set up in the far corner. He couldn't help but laugh at his mother's expressions as she tried to navigate her movements. Technology was still very new to her and something like that probably felt alien.
Of course he wanted to go check out the flowers and shit. He'd probably spend the whole time chasing down the various insects, trying to make friends. Dean couldn't help but smile at the thought of Cas crouching down, trying to make conversation with an ant hill. " Yeah, not really the best time of year for that, bud. maybe next time."
"Good!" Cas shouted. "Now maybe you can understand how I felt when I had to choose between saving existence and losing you! Maybe now you'll understand how helpless I felt without my powers, as I spent HOURS searching for you in the rubble. Now you can know how I felt when I found your broken, bloodied body half a mile away, barely alive, doing everything I could to save you and coming up short! Why I had to seek the comfort of that so called 'demon whore', who did nothing but console me over the last few days while they kept me away from you because I was so sick with worry, it became a danger to you! All because you wouldn't fucking listen!"
‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Cas apologized again.
Sam rolled his head to the side to see the angel staring down at him, disappointed. "Yeah? How so?"
Not a word is spoken
‚ÄúYou what?!‚Äù Dean shot off the bed and glared in the general direction of the angel, hoping like hell Cas could feel his ire in the darkness.
‚ÄúDean, I didn't think...‚Äù
‚ÄúJust go with it.‚Äù Dean mouthed over Adam's head.
"What's 'The Deal'?" Aziraphale asked finally, having remained silent through the entire exchange.
I want to say that I hate doing this to Dean. I have never resonated with a character so much in my life. He might be my spirit animal. So believe me when I say, hurting Dean hurts me more.
"Odd." Castiel finished for him.
" What is it, Crowley?" The angel asked, clearly exasperated, eyes still fixed on the book.
"Oh, come now," Aziraphale's tutted, "everything we managed to find said it should go away in time. Just the amount of time is uncertain."
The first thing that clicked in his head, when he looked over at Crowley with rage to see the demon singing along to the words, with a cocky smile on his face, was that this was definitely NOT Zeppelin.
"Hey, hey no!" Dean shook his head. "None of that. You got us out just in time. She was like one second away from toasting us both. You did good buddy. You did good."
"No." He answered finally, anger seeping through his core as he thought about the horror of such wonderful beings forced to spend eternity in pain.
"Yeah." Sam scoffed. "Mine and Dean's deal. That we never follow."
Dean watched as Cas processed that information, his face slipping slowly from a look of deep thought to one that read 'please don't make me do this' as realization kicked in. "Dean...I don't think that's such a good idea..."
Dean glared at her over the edge of his book before glancing over at Cas's sleeping form. The, bruises were long gone by now, the only evidence of the scrapes were the quickly fading scars they had left behind. But the black marks remained, though they had shrunk to the size of cigarette burns, they still served as reminders of why Cas was even sleeping in the first place. He gritted his teeth and set down his book, looking at her out the side of his eyes after tipping his head in Cas's direction. "I think it's pretty clear that Sam won't change his mind, once it's set on something."
what happened?
"Well," Sam said, placing the orb into a box, "What now?"
"You may be an abomination," Cas replied coldly, taking the demon's hand, "but I can see right through you. I understand that you had good intentions. You are a kind creature at heart, even if you refuse to admit it."
Watching some good friends screaming
Cas turned to see Crowley leaned casually against the door frame, a cocky smirk plastered across his face. "Understatement." Cas huffed, twirling the tape once more.
‚ÄúHoly fuck!‚Äù Dean exclaimed after catching his breath.
Oh, shit. Was Cas being serious? Did he just fuck something up with that little stunt? ‚Äú It's for me.‚Äù Dean grumbled. ‚Äú I'm gonna need to be buzzed if I'm gonna make it through the rest of the night with you two chuckle heads.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs that why you're so sad, Castiel?‚Äù
"Don't bother." Cas said as soon as they rounded the corner. His face was cold, his stance was fierce. He looked well and truly, like a warrior of God. "I heard enough."
Dean had been arguing on the phone with Sam for the better part of an hour now. He hadn't even gotten the chance to appreciate the sheer enormity of the hotel Cas had found for them before his little brother had called to check in. Which was an absolute shame because from the outside, this place looked like the God-damned Palace of Versailles. He couldn't say much for the inside though. As soon as Baby had been safely parked inside the half-empty parking garage, Cas zapped them all to the penthouse suite. He said that it was necessary for everyone's peace of mind to avoid the carnage throughout the rest of the hotel. "No, I already called the girls and told them to wait. We can probably be there by tomorrow night, and I don't want them out in that mess by themselves." He swirled the perfectly aged whiskey Cas had gotten him (after Dean had insisted it would be the only way he'd be able to get any sleep) from the bar downstairs, around in his glass, mindlessly watching the whirlpool of liquid in the center as he spoke. "I told you dude. It's bad out there. There's no way we'd make it before tomorrow anyway, and Cas demanded we get some rest."
‚ÄúWell, unfortunately for us, I don't believe we have that option.‚Äù Aziraphale said as he began to pace. ‚ÄúThey aren't exactly pleased with me after the apocalypse debacle.‚Äù
"I never claimed I was 'mysterious'." Dean mumbled. "I'm about as open of a book as it gets. Jesus, can't a guy just be concerned for his friend‚Äôs wellbeing? The guys just got blasted by God's sister. Someone's gotta make sure he doesn't keel over."
'Keep him distracted.' That was the plan. Keep him weak. Don't let him gain a second of clarity to gather his thoughts. Attack from all sides. Keep him confused. Just long enough for the small group of angels to sacrifice most of their Grace to Amara to give her strength. Once she had enough power, all the angels would release a collective smite onto Chuck on Castiel's command and she could deal the final blow. Not strong enough to kill, just weak enough to capture. Just a little more time, everything was going fine, they were going to pull this off...
keys to all the cars.
‚ÄúIs it always like this with them?‚Äù Crowley asked, leaning into Sam as they all stood and watched the exchange from the other side of the room.
Cas needed Dean. Plain and simple. It had been that way from the moment he laid a hand on his soul. Sam, needed his brother. The world needed every last Winchester it could get. They needed to find Dean. ‚Äú What do you propose we do?‚Äù He asked.
"Bitch." Dean huffed.
"Bullshit!" Dean spat. "He always has a fucking reason! He always thinks he's doing the right thing, and we're always left to pick up the pieces when it blows up in his face!"
Dean looked up at him for a moment, before looking back at Cas. ‚ÄúWhat Sam?‚Äù
"Yeah fat chance, sister!" Dean scoffed, pushing them both further back into the hall. "You said you'd take him when he was happy. You don't get to break a deal just because you found a loophole to your little insomnia problem."
‚ÄúGiven Dean's surly nature, I'd assume you would be the sibling to have a kinder disposition.‚Äù He continued, staring over the rim of his glasses at the open page. ‚Äú It just goes to show you that even with years of knowledge, it is foolish to make assumptions, even when based on experience.‚Äù
When they sat back down, Dean was still fixated on Cas. He was completely awestruck by how much he had come to love the angel. Up until that point he had ignored the ceremony completely, but then an idea stuck him. He didn't do chick flick moments. They weren't his style. He spent his entire life suppressing his feelings, pushing them down until they eventually came boiling to the surface in one form or another. But this was Cas. He had given everything to Dean, even something that the hunter was sure he would never be allowed to have. True love. Dean could give him this.
This wasn't happening. It wasn't fair.
Castiel sat with his wings curled around his form, his head hung low. He shook violently with silent sobs, dry, salt-crusted streaks down his face were the only evidence he ever had tears to begin with, as his ducts had long ago run out. He had screamed himself horse for hours, in every language, every tongue, only to heal himself so he could do it again, so many times that he had drained himself, and now all he could do was sit, and shake.
‚ÄúOkay...‚Äù Dean said ‚Äúbut what about my other clothes...‚Äù
" More exhausting than anything, really." Dean agreed.
"I have no friends, other than you." Crowley replied stubbornly " I find it insulting you would think otherwise. I've already forgotten their names. No more than a horrible, distant memory, the whole lot of them."
Cas looked back and forth between the bickering brothers with a look of concern "I don't understand. What is going on?"
"Did he really?" Crowley paused, barely glancing over his shoulder.
"He's a good guy." Dean insisted. "He takes some getting used to, but I promise, give him a chance and you'll learn to like him."
"Pyjamas, Cas." Dean snapped. "You know, sleep wear? Lounge clothes?"
"Don't!" Cas growled again, the power in the bunker starting to surge, causing the shadow of those midnight black wings he had seen in person before, rise against the walls. "I am so SICK of your half assed apologies. You only give them out when you‚Äôre scared or there is something you want from me, so save it! For once, FOR ONCE, you are going to listen!" Cas was backing him down the stairs into the War room now, a wicked smile spreading across his face. "That's YOUR problem, Dean. You never, NEVER listen."
"Excuse you?" Amara gaped. "What makes you think you can stop me?"
Sam walked in at the same time that the ball shattered into light and the rift reassembled itself. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?!‚Äù He screeched.
that your body couldn't keep
"Crowley?"
Crowley continued to make several more mistakes over the centuries due to faulty judgement, including thinking that moving a few traffic cones during the construction of the M25 would be nothing more than a harmless prank, or trusting the Antichrist in the hands of a bunch of blabbering nuns or, most recently, trusting a man who fell out of the sky not to lead him to ultimate doom. It turned out that the only good decision he had managed to make in all his time was falling in love with someone he had no business in loving. Still, Crowley prided himself on being, at least, somewhat intelligent, albeit, slightly naive. Therefore, it should stand to reason that an army of angels popping up out of black goo lead by a demon, a scrawny, pale man who looked like he could be blown over by a slight breeze, and someone he saw die, right in front of his very eyes only a week ago, couldn't possibly mean anything good. Yet, somehow he couldn't help the little flutter of hope that was bursting through him at the sight.
"You trust me that much, huh?" She smiled.
Dean ignored him and made a grab for the phone. "I've gotten pretty good with these things lately. I'm pretty sure I can..."
I debated for a while on splitting it into two parts and leaving it here, for those who wanted to avoid any serious angsty angst, but it felt unresolved. This is my warning that the two stories will be combined from now on. There will be fluff....there will be angst...but ultimately it should end happy if you wish to end it here and leave it open to your interpretation of what happened after this, that's great. Thank you for coming on this journey with me.üòò
üé∂But I know that I love you soüé∂
"I don't believe we have such a thing." Aziraphale said, now fascinated. " What sort of deal would Castiel have that would apply here?"
"It's so good to see you again, Dean." She said softly as he turned to face her, melting his entire resolve.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
"I love you Dean Winchester. I always have. And I'm sorry" Cas said quietly as the remaining shards of wood burst into the room, the Shadow storming in after. "Goodbye, Dean"
Jack made a face and shook his head. "Pizza actually sounds nice, though."
He tore his eyes away from Dean and fixed his gaze on Sam. " I will need another day to fully restore my Grace. I will fly us to Reno first thing in the morning."
"OTHER PEOPLE LIVE HERE GUYS!" Sam protested, clearly annoyed from getting a similar response from both of them.
"...me?"
"I don't know about you two, but I feel like I could eat a whole fucking elephant right about now. What d'ya say we snag a couple burgers or something before we head back home?"
‚ÄúOh, get up!‚Äù Crowley groaned. ‚ÄúI'm not carrying you to the car, if you pass out in this chair.‚Äù
Dean looked down and nodded his head, possibly reflecting on the times his own arrogance almost did him in as well. "Good." He said breathlessly. "Good, that's...that's pretty frickin awesome actually. Guess karma's a really bitch, right?"
"Claire, I wasn't.... "
"Take me back!" Dean yelled at the angels.
"Oh you don't know the half of it." Marie's smiled. "But really it was my pleasure. It's the least I could do for my favorite stars."
‚ÄúNo, you look! Life with me, back in our world, may not be life in the fast lane, but we've done well for ourselves so far. I promise you that once we get home, we can try to find things that you find more exciting, if that's what you want, but I can't let you...‚Äù
"Who?" Dean asked, trying to remember a time Cas had ever actually killed him.
"Like Sam said, Dean," Cas interjected "these stories are harmless. Really. We all know what our lives really are, I don't see any harm in letting people have their own creative license when we know the truth."
Well here it is, almost a year later, the end. I'm sorry it took so long, and im sorry if it isnt what you hoped it would be.
And yet....
‚ÄúWell, regardless of your opinions of your brother's love life,‚Äù Rowena said, ‚Äúwe can at least agree that there is a broken-hearted creature down that hallway, who is suffering right now, and one of his only friends just spent a good amount of time yelling at him and telling him his plight was hopeless.‚Äù
‚ÄúI'll try...‚Äù Adam said rolling his eyes. He turned to Castiel then and looked him up and down. ‚ÄúYou'll take care of Dean, won't you?‚Äù Cas nodded and was surprised when Adam threw his arms around his waist. ‚ÄúTry not to be so sad, alright? Things will get better. There's no point in staying sad all the time. You won't get anything done that way.‚Äù
******
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?‚Äù Sam grumbled.
*****
Someone who would listen to music with him, and watch his favorite movies with. Someone he could joke around with. He wanted someone who worried about his safety when he went off on dangerous quests to save humanity. Someone who put him first.
"That's all I'm sayin." Dean said. "You both live, neither of you rules, everyone is happy. The end."
"I'm sorry, what?!" She screeched "I know it's like the most popular ship on the internet but I had no idea Destiel was actually a thing!"
Her expression softened into a smile as she held out her arms. "Bring it in Dean. I'm so glad you're okay." She hugged him right and swayed him back and forth a couple times, before pulling back and smacking him on his arm.
"I am not a coward." He repeated, causing them both to fall on their asses as he stood. "I am God! I gave you life, and I can take it away as I choose!" Another, slightly stronger burst of power struck him across the face, just before Aziraphale spoke.
Dean adjusted his stance to stand protectively over Castiel and took a deep breath, gritting his teeth. "You don't want to help? Fine! I was giving you a chance to save his life, trap him or something, like he did you. We can't do that without your help. So our only option is to kill him!"
Cas nodded and blew the candle out, picking up the fork gingerly before sitting himself down on the bed. He took a large bite, swirling the taste around in his mouth before swallowing. "Thank you." He smiled, taking another, smaller bite.
"I don't see how my weakness makes me anymore qualified to..."
"You really know how to make a girl blush." She laughed. "Wait did I hear you say Gadreel? Like THE Gadreel. The angel who toppled Eden? That Gadreel?"
"Didn't you get the memo?" Gabriel says, slinging his arm around Cas's shoulder. "Dad's screwing with the universe and no one's happy about it."
"You told him about Castiel's deal?" Crowley asked from across the hall.
"I said NO, Cas!" Dean said turning on him.
Dean couldn't help but notice that the two of them seemed to have changed to most in four years. Siobhan's once long dark hair was now sitting shoulder length, streaked with several neon colors. She was clad in all black, tight jeans and a loose shirt, covered by a leather jacket. Kristen had grown taller and half her dark hair was grown out to the same length as Siobhan's while the other half was shaved. It could've been because Dean had never really seen them out of costume, but it was a little weird seeing Kristen in a brightly colored floral dress. It was almost as weird seeing her out of the trenchcoat as it was Cas. They looked more confident too. Happier. It just strengthened the feeling of hope the party had already brought on.
"Me and Cas ain't like that. Fucking asshole thinks he knows everything. "
Aziraphale gave Crowley a nervous glance, but the demon kept his eyes fixed on the man. ‚ÄúThat's right.‚Äù Crowley nodded. ‚ÄúI delivered Adam. We're here to speak to him about his hospital records. If you would be so kind as to...‚Äù
‚ÄúIt's right over there.‚Äù Aziraphale said, breaking Dean from his thoughts. He looked out the window to see that they were driving through a quaint little village, old brick houses covered in vines, white picket fences surrounding plush lawns, a mail box in front of each one. Something that Dean would probably never see in his world again. They pulled up behind a well-kept classic car parked in front of one of the houses. ‚ÄúNow, Dean,‚Äù Aziraphale said turning in his seat ‚ÄúYou are welcome to come along, but it is important that you let Crowley and I do the talking. He's very powerful, and we don't want to upset him, you understand.‚Äù
His knees hit the ground, his body felt like jelly; his legs could no longer hold him, and he tasted copper when he swallowed. (Had he been screaming? Was his throat bleeding?) He was vaguely aware of the voice booming commands and questions at him, but it was coming from miles away and he really couldn't bring himself to care. It didn't matter. Nothing mattered. They were right. Every snide comment made over the years, every joke, every skeptical look he pushed aside and ignored. All of it. It was all true. Cas loved him. And now he was gone. For good; forever. No resurrections, no miraculous escapes. Gone. Dean did that. The angel had survived for eons, broken, beaten, taken out by just about every major creature in existence only to come out the other side, still fighting. And it was Dean Winchester who finally killed him. He let the tears fall freely from his eyes; it didn't matter who saw him cry anymore. What did he care? Nothing mattered.
"No, you're not!" Chuckled one of the demons on the floor.
"I know." Cas said. "I know it's just.... I can't help but feel like all of this is hopeless."
time consuming. Hope y'all enjoy.
"Cas, don't..." Dean heaved a frustrated sigh and pulled the angel back into his room, shutting the door behind him. "Cas please don't be mad at me. I'm sorry, okay? I was an ass today and I know it. Just.... please forgive me."
‚ÄúYeah. I do.‚Äù Dean grunted.
Castiel deflated a bit and let out a sigh, shifting his gaze to the floor. "No, I'm sorry. I'm just.... it's as you said. I'm just... apprehensive about the task at hand, is all."
"Dean, Cas wouldn't..."
Cas's arms had fallen limply to  his sides. He was standing still as a statue, not even blinking. Dean wasn't even sure if he was breathing (not that he needed to but, still). His eyes were wide and his mouth was hanging open. He looked as terrified as he had the night Dean had taken him to a brothel.
"The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few." Dean said as he walked into the room. They all turned to look at him, taking in his sunken eyes and lifeless stare. He marched across the room stopping a few feet before Amara and nodded. "Do it."
Cas nodded, relaxing a bit at Claire's tone. "I'm glad to hear that. What sort of stuff were you having trouble with? You know you can always call me if you're struggling. I owe it to you..."
Dean swallowed hard, his ears tinged red (though he wasn't sure of it was more from anger or crippling embarrassment) as he turned back to the road, refusing to make eye contact with anyone in the car. "It's fine Cas. Crowley's just being an asshole. Your songs are still on there. He just doesn't want us to listen to anything good."
'Strike one, bitch!' Dean thought to himself pulling Cas closer to his side. "Your brother's to blame for that! Not Cas! You leave him out of this!" He snarled.
"Our home?!" Aziraphale asked.
"If anybody wants the job," said another one as she wobbled to her feet, speaking in a mocking tone, "he can come through me!" The laughter grew even louder then as the group looked on with disgruntled stares.
üé∂ She's a killer queeen, gunpowder, gelatine, dynamite with a laser beam...üé∂
‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù Anathema breathed out apologetically ‚ÄúI was trying my best to keep him away from it while you were saying your goodbyes, but he just...‚Äù
"And what else would you have me do, Sam."
" That ain't exactly my fault now, is it?" Dean said, side eyeing the angel as he put the last dish in the strainer.
üé∂Don't you feel the same way?
"Part of it!" Sam answered ignoring his brother's outrage. "He went storming off before I could tell him anything past trading his life for Jack's!"
He pulled out his phone and shot a quick text to let Jack and Mary know that he
I had something important to add to my notes....I KNOW I did....but for the life of me, I cannot remember what it was. Oh, well...I'll add it later...
"I suppose there's no immediate rush." Crowley agreed "I don't see the problem in postponing our departure until after lunch‚Ä¶"
‚ÄúSo, you're sure you're okay with this?‚Äù Dean asked as he tossed Mary's bag into the truck. ‚ÄúThis whole me and Cas thing?‚Äù
"Deano!" Meg smiled as he walked past. "So nice of you to finally join our little powwow." He was trying his best to ignore her at the moment. It was hard. The only reason he had stopped at the door instead of immediately joining in the conversation was because of her; because of where she was. He had walked into the library to see her arms draped over Cas's shoulders, her chin resting on his head. In the half hour Dean had been hiding in the shadows he had seen her whisper something in his ear at least twice and Cas reach up to squeeze her had in response. It had become painfully clear why Cas hadn't come visit him then. Dean has messed up way too many times, and now Cas had moved on. He moved on to someone who had never abandoned him. Someone who didn't hesitate to let him know how they felt. It was what he deserved of course, but Dean would be lying if he said it didn't fucking sting. After everything that happened, after everything they had been through....he almost died trying to save Cas, and he didn't even know it was already too late.
Cas set his jaw and settled Dean in a determined gaze. " Marie worked very hard on her interpretation, Dean. It didn't look like a 'crapfest' from the scenes that I saw."
"No." Cas replied. "But right now, they're all we've got."
Dean's eyebrows shot to the sky as he looked over at Crowley, blush slowly creeping up his neck. It wasn't the first time Crowley had called Cas his angel, Dean had been begging him to stop since day one. It was, however, the first time he had said anything like that in front of Cas. A fact only made worse when the angel disappeared as soon as the words left his mouth. Dean was only allowed a few seconds of panic though, when Cas returned moments later, seemingly unfazed by Crowley's comment.
"No." Dean said again, shaking his head. He turned to walk away from the whole damn stupid conversation when Cas caught him quickly by the arm.
"Dean said that Benny helped him fight through purgatory, right?" She said. "He met him pretty early on in his time there, no?"
Dean stared at the angel in shock, shifting his gaze to Sam only to get a shrug in return. He looked back at Cas's stupid smirk and shook his head in resignation. " Let's go get ready for this stupid party." He marched over to the car and flung open the door slamming himself inside.
"I know." Sam sniffed. "I know."
Crowley grinned and turned to his angel with a shrug. " Well, I may have exaggerated a bit. Though the words weren't too kind, it was the energy he was giving off that was really frightening. Remind me never to get on Castiel's bad side."
"Please!" Dean yelled, and Amara paused. She glanced at Dean with a confused look but kept her hold.
Dean stumbled into the kitchen the next morning greeted by four impatient looking faces.
"Don't." Dean begged again, closing his eyes.
It had been a little over six thousand years since his heart had made the right call. It was about time for another one.
‚ÄúIt isn't his fault.‚Äù Crowley said defensively ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a demon. He's and angel. He wasn't supposed to sully his pure nature with my presence, it just happened. It's only fair that he lived in denial. We've always been close. He just had a difficult time accepting that he wasn't what he thought he was. I'm sure your angel struggled with your time as demon as well.‚Äù
Now was not the time for secrets.
"When we first met, you were so broken‚Ä¶" Castiel said stepping closer once more. A pounding on the door grabbed Dean's attention. He turned his head to look at the doorway, but Castiel needed him to look him in the eyes as he said this. One last time he needed Dean Winchester to listen to him. He grabbed onto the hunter's shoulder, gripping him tight in the same place he had held him, all those years ago, when he pulled his soul out of hell. Dean turned his head slowly back towards Castiel, tears rolling down his face. "You truly believed that you weren't worthy of being saved. I didn't understand it then. How someone with a soul as pure as yours could think so little of yourself. And then I grew to know you." Outside, The shadow had begun swinging at the door with the scythe, successfully managing to break it away peice by peice. "It wasn't just being saved you felt you were unworthy of. You felt that you were unworthy of anything good. Unworthy of love."
Jody and Rowena stood in a staring contest for a while, until Rowena sighed and shook her head. "Very well. I will be in the library if you need me. Just remember that I tried to warn you when you are staring into the face of certain death."
The brothers would never admit it out loud if you asked them, but seeing the play for the first time, without being shocked by its existence or hunting down a scarecrow, it was actually pretty enjoyable. Dean had already found the songs he had heard pretty catchy and the ones that he hadn't didn't dissapoint in that category either. It was almost cathartic watching their lives played out before them coupled with showtunes. Comical even. Cas had eventually settled back on the bed, asking the other two questions about the particular cases he wasn't exactly privy to, absentmindedly nibbling on the snacks that Dean had placed on the bed between them, not even minding the taste of molecules.
"What difference will it make?" Aziraphale sighed. "You said it yourself, love, we're doomed either way."
Cas was confused. He couldn't think of anyone Dean would despise so thoroughly on his behalf, let alone a woman. He looked between the brothers, both looking like they were about to explode waiting for one of them to speak. "Sam? Who..."
Dean pointed a finger at Marie and Sam, speaking firmly to get his point across. "It's nothing! Not a thing! Never was, never is, never will be! Got it?!"
"Jack, no!" Cas said. "I won't let you be used..."
Time didn't speed up again until he clicked the fast-forward button on the player, releasing it when he felt that he was safe, and the song was over.
"I know that Claire, but I need you." He insisted. " They'll listen to you better than anyone else, and besides, we need someone that can train them to defend themselves in case things go sideways"
‚ÄúWhat's the matter, Angel?‚Äù Crowley asked, voicing Dean's thoughts.
"Ew, gross, no." Charlie said, scrunching her face at Dean's implications. "Sam, was just helping me with my bags. Right Sam?"
Cas huffed a small laugh. "It doesn't bother you then? Me being in a male vessel."
Kaia let her head fall to the side trying to look over her shoulder. ‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù She asked, pointing her eyes at where Cas was laying.
The second one was closer, the third closer still and approaching rapidly.
He looked back over at Cas to see him looking down at the bee with a sad smile on his face. "Thank you, Dean. I love it."
"Take it back!" He yelled, pushing a gust of wind in her direction, sending her crashing into another pillar. She quickly regrouped sending another, slightly weaker bolt his way, square across his face, leaving an ugly gash in its wake.
‚ÄúCas....‚Äù Sam repeated, placing his hand on the angel's shoulder.
Crowley's eyes went wide as he grinned sheepishly up at Sam. "Nothing...."
"What's that supposed to mean?" It came out a little harsher than Dean had intended. He didn't want to snap at his mom, but he really wasn't in the mood to deal with his brother's bullshit.
mumbled.
Cas tilted his head in Crowley's direction. "I thought you didn't need to sleep."
"I could go for some pizza." Mary agreed.
"You ever hear the sound of a million wailing souls." Her voice somehow echoed, though her tone was quite as she licked the outer shell of the angel's ear. "It's quite the song, let me tell you. If you refuse to help us take down God, all those sad little people, every single one that was ever born, will end up here and I'll make sure you'll never sleep again. You will spend the rest of eternity listening to the cries of all those you refused to save. Capiche?" The angel gulped and nodded. " If you were smart, you'd be batting for the team that wants to take you home." She said as she walked back to Castiel's side. " Not the guy who wants you to spend eternity in pain. So?" She turned around to face the group again. " What's it gonna be?"
"So, you know." Sam said grimly, in more of a statement than a question.
‚ÄúNope. I'm getting home one way or another.‚Äù Dean answered. ‚ÄúI got a family to get back to.‚Äù
"Hmm‚Ä¶."
"Yeah." Dean smiled, a blush creeping up his neck as he pulled his face out of Cas's grip while still squeezing his hand. "Yeah okay I get it. No need to get all mushy. Uh, same for me though, by the way." Cas smiled back.
Dean smirked. "Why do you have that damn bee stuffed in your coat?"
"I'm not..." Dean was shaking
"Excellent," Dean chuckled, getting the exact response from his friend as he wanted "so it's settled. I saw a decent looking hole in the wall a couple towns over when we were coming in. Let's go eat."
"Jerks."
Next up: old friends and big problems
"He's not my dad!" Claire snapped as she stepped into the room, tossing Castiel's clothes on the bed. "Here. I pulled these out of the dryer for you. They probably shrunk, and I can't promise they aren't covered in like, a million little grubby hand prints! Where the hell did you even go last night?! Sam needs all of us in the...."
The next day, Sam called Eileen, apologizing for everything, and explaining what had happened. The next few days was a flurry of activity, moving Eileen into the bunker, Dean going off to his first day on his new job, setting up their plans for the future. Every once in a while Sam would find Dean thinking quietly to himself, lost inside his head. He left him alone in those times, but was always there when Dean needed to talk. It was a few months before Sam and Eileen had worked out a plan, eventually settling on Dean's idea of creating a safe space for hunters at the bunker, reviving the Men of Letters and combining it with the hunting network. Sam and Eileen would be the dispatchers, gathering information and sending people out on hunts. They had decided to mostly retire from active duty themselves, only taking simple salt and burns, or other hunts that posed the least risk. It was time they settled down and made a life for themselves anyway. Within the year, the three of them had managed to make the bunker a real home, for themselves and the family they made along the way.
"I don't." Crowley shrugged. "I like to sleep. It makes me happy. You could afford to indulge in a few human luxuries yourself, Castiel. You never know what you might find to tickle your fancy."
"Balthazar. Inias. Hanna. Joshua. You've gotta be kidding me with this, Cassie." Gabriel said, marching alongside Castiel as he paced. "You asked for a list and all you gave us was cliff notes. You've got like forty angels here dude. We need an army, not a marching band!"
Pressure on people, people on streets
Dean had spent a good portion of his night having a mild panic attack. In his onslaught of actual emotions, he had told two people (or entities he guessed) that he hardly knew from Adam, his biggest, most shameful secret. It wasn't hard for anyone to deduce that he was bi, not if they paid enough attention. It's not like he went around waving a flag or anything, but he didn't exactly keep it that well-hidden. If anyone bothered to ask him directly (which very few people, including his own family, ever had) he wouldn't outright lie about it either. Half-truths, maybe, but he got over being scared about that part of himself years ago. But he had never, not once, not ever, told ANYONE, about how he really felt about Cas. Not out loud. Not even to himself. He's thought it loud enough, plenty of times, sure. There were even times he almost said it to Cas directly, hell he did, multiple times, in different ways, but using the actual words? No. Just no. He couldn't do that. Not to Cas. Not to himself.
‚ÄúWe'll figure this out, Cas.‚Äù Dean yawned, snuggling deeper into the angel. ‚Äú We'll fix this shit with Michael, we'll figure out a way to save your ass from the Empty, because that's what we do. Save the world: one dumb ass mistake at a time.‚Äù
"Uh...thanks....' Sam said awkwardly as he held his hand out to the angel.
"How long can you hold him off?" Dean asked, pulling himself to his feet.
"Oh, shit!" Dean said, at the same time the bunker began to shake.
"I don't get it‚Ä¶" Sam replied.
"You gave Cas a heart." Sam chimed in, his voice watery, but strong. ‚ÄúBecause of that he wasn't just some mindless drone full of holy wrath. He was loyal, and thoughtful and he learned to love."
Dean turned his head cautiously, now completely convinced he was dreaming after all, because there he was, standing just a few feet away, hands awkwardly shoved into the pockets of that stupid, ugly trench coat, looking the same as he did the day he left Dean.
"Ugh!" Meg groaned from behind them. "That's enough lovey-dovey crap to last me the next thousand years. I need to go torture something." She walked up to Cas and grabbed him by the shoulders, gaining his attention. "You sure you're gonna be okay without me, Clarence?"
And love dares you to care for
" There's an arcade!" Jack said, finally speaking up from his corner of the kitchen, where he had been silently shoveling sugary cereal down his gullet, watching the exchange go down. Everyone turned to face him. "It's not to far from here actually. Maybe an hour or so? I saw it on the way back from the cabin. " He smiled warmly, a hopeful glint passing his eyes. "I've never been to an arcade before!"
"I told him not to tell you or your brother." Castiel continued. "You were both going through enough and I didn't want to add anymore cause for concern." He watched as Dean began taking deep breaths. The hunter dropped his face from the ceiling, turning it to the floor as he squeezed his eyes shut and pressed his tongue against the inside of his cheek. "I realize that it was wrong of me to ask him to lie on my account. I do apologize for that but I did what was necessary to bring him back and I won't‚Ä¶"
Dean didn't have special angel powers. He hadn't ripped Castiel from hell and put him back together. He hadn't spent countless hours watching the angel sleep, observing him without his knowledge. He wasn't even good at knowing his own feelings let alone anyone else's. But he knew the angel well enough to know which part of his whole speech was a lie. He just couldn't believe he had been to dense to see it before.
Dean chuckled a bit, stepping back as he wiped his eyes with his sleeve. "I feel statements, Cas? Really? Is that what we're doing now?"
"Go fuck yourself, Dean." Cas huffed.
‚ÄúThe beginning is usually a good place for that.‚Äù Cas supplied.
Anathema peaked at him through her fingers and gave him a weak smile. ‚ÄúIs there any way we can achieve it the same way you did before?‚Äù
‚ÄúHold on a minute. What?‚Äù Kaia scoffed waving her hand in front of her face. ‚ÄúHis mother is dead?‚Äù There was so much information flying around it was causing her head to spin.
