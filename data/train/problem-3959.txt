Cas woke up to sunlight streaming in through his bedroom window. He opened his eyes, immediately shutting them because the light was too painful to bear. His head felt like it might explode. He rolled over and saw the water and Tylenol on the nightstand, a smile trying to form on his face. Cas managed to sit up and take the pills before he noticed the smell of food coming from the kitchen. He made his way down the steps and saw what could possibly be the best sight on the planet.
"In the bathroom."
"Texas Longhorns are definitely in the running. So is UCLA."
"Not my style, dick."
"Here's hoping." Cas put his face in Dean's hair.
“Hey. It's been awhile. What's up?”
He hung up. "Alright, let's go. My mom is stuck in traffic but she'll be there."
"Dean Henry, get out of bed! You have an early practice remember?" He opened his eyes and groaned. He looked at his clock. 5:30 am. "Shit!" He got out of bed and walked to his closet, grabbing his jersey and a plain white t-shirt then to his dresser and grabbed a pair of jeans, socks, and boxers. He got dressed and made his way downstairs. Where there was a glass of orange juice, two toaster pastries, and a protein bar waiting for him. He downed the orange juice and grabbed the food. Then walked over to the kitchen table and grabbed his backpack and keys. Taking a bite of a toaster pastry, he slipped on his shoes and opened the front door. "See you at the game!" He called to his mom. He walked down the path to the driveway. He got in the Impala his mom had bought him for his sixteenth birthday. He started the car, letting it idle just so he can hear it for a moment. He would never get tired of hearing his baby pur. He smiled and backed out of the driveway. He popped a mixtape of 80's rock and headed to school.
Cas looked up. "Well, this kid here wanted to make some noise and cause a ruckus, so I bought us all plane tickets to Vegas."
Cas remained still until the paramedics arrived. Dean and Charlie backed up and let them through. Charlie had her hand over her mouth, crying. Dean put his arm around her. "It's okay. He'll be okay." Not sure if he was trying to convince her or himself. Two firefighters slowly moved the bike off of Cas as one paramedic was asking Cas questions to keep him conscious. "What's your name honey?" She asked, holding his head. Cas moved his eyes to her. "Castiel Novak. Cas for short."
"Only because I like your car."
Cas darted forward and covered her mouth with his hand. "Shh! Keep it down!" He whispered loudly. He let his hand fall to his side. "What happened?"
In the days that follow, it was easy to fall into a routine. Cas started helping out at The Drive along side Charlie. Dean had fallen back into his old routine as well. Checking the perimeter while Cas was working in between lunch and dinner. Even though they hadn't mated, they hardly went anywhere without each other. Dean told Cas to keep taking his blockers and the first heat there went seemingly unnoticed.
Cas stepped gingerly out of his room and made his way to the stairs. Naomi smiled."Castiel James Novak. You clean up alright." He was wearing the blue button down with the black buttons, with a  black vest and tailored black dress pants. He even had on formal shoes. He has thrown some gel in his hair and gave it a messy look.
Everyone played their instruments at the same time. Cas played the keyboard along with them.
That's it.
“Dean...”
Cas stepped out of the changing room and his mother nearly cried. “Castiel James you look absolutely amazing! How is it you're still single? The ladies should be just eating you up…” Cas shot a glare at Gabriel, who was trying not to laugh. He swallowed and forced a smile. “Guess I'm just too busy for lady-hunting, ma. But I do like this jacket. It's nicely tailored. Even if it is a knock-off Armani.” Cas winked at Gabriel, who had to excuse himself because he was laughing so hard. If Cas had to be stuck here with his ridiculous family, who continue to deny who Castiel James Novak really was, then he was going to be as gay as possible for his own entertainment.
"What, protecting you?"
“I guess there's no going back to my cabin to change in stealth...” Cas laughed.
He leaned in, grabbed the phone and yanked it off the wall, throwing it behind him. "Naomi Novak. Where is she?" The lady, now startled, pointed to the ER. Cas took off.
"Fuck are you serious?!"
"Sitting is probably a good idea seeing how I can't feel my feet right now."
Music started playing and everyone surrounded the dance floor. "Now dancing together for the first time, Dean and Castiel Winchester." The song "This guy's in love with you" by Burt Bacharach began to play. Dean took Cas' hand and led him to the middle of the floor, putting his hands on Cas' hips. Cas put his arms around Dean's neck and they swayed slowly to the music. Once again Mary took pictures. Dean fought the urge to stick his tongue out at her camera. He focused on Cas. Both of them had she'd their tux jackets but still had the rest of it on. Dean looked at Cas' dark forest green vest that matched the tux jacket. "I have to say, you clean up well Dean." Cas smiled at him. Dean laughed. "You don't do so bad yourself."
He let himself float in that familiar void of nothing and the image of Dean faded to nothing.
Sam waved as he opened the door. "See ya."
He heard gunfire and sat up. He pushed himself off the bed and crawled to the bars of his cell. He pulled himself up, trying to see what was going on. He could hear the Germans yelling "Get the American! Get the prisoner!" One soldier emerged, yelling at Dean to get back. He sat down and pushed himself backwards to the wall then put his hands up. Like he could run anyway. A gun rang out and the soldier fell. Two British soldiers now stood in front of him. "Who are you?" They pointed their guns at him. "Private First Class Dean Winchester. 101st airborne. United States Army. My dog tags are probably on one of the Germans." One soldier pulled a set of dog tags out of his pocket and looked at them. "Found these on one. Claimed he blew off the back of a prisoners head. Stand up."  He looked at them for a moment. "I can't. My legs are shattered. There's a steel plate in the back of my head. Not all my hair has grown back. Feel for yourself." One walked over to him and ran a hand across the back of his head. "There's something there. Let's take him to base. We have a few guys from the 101st. See if the know him."
“Come on, really? You?”
"RJ doesn't let anyone ride him. Like his daddy before him."
Dean whipped around. "He's breathing..." It was barely a whisper. He stepped back into the room as they moved Cas to a stretcher.
“Alright Cas now hand me the gauze, padding, and that stuff that looks like duct tape.”
Cas couldn't help but smile as Dean walked down the isle to him. As soon as he saw him, he wasn't nervous anymore, not that he acted nervous. He fought the urge to meet Dean halfway and just kiss him like the fucking world is ending.
“I've been told it's spring rain and cinnamon.”
"I wouldn't have been if I did jump on that grenade."
Dean looked at him. "Your mom didn't name you?"
March 1942
Hey, gorgeous."
"I know so."
"You act like you don't do this."
"You're welcome and there isn't anywhere else I'd rather be."
“Hey, Charlie.” Charlie wrapped him in a hug. “It's so good to see you.” Charlie squeezed his biceps. “Damn boy, nice…”
"It is! Cassie and his boy toy! Hey! Cassie!"
"Cas...?"
"Yeah, of course."
Despite everything, they got along if only for Ben's sake.
If we wake up and you wanna break up that's cool
Cas cut the engine to his bike and walked it up the driveway next to the Impala. He walked up to the door and knocked. Mary answered. "Cas! Good to see you! Dean's still asleep but I'm sure you can wake him and he wouldn't mind." She smiled and let him in. He returned the smile and she gave him a hug which kind of surprised him. "You look good." Cas smiled again. He thanked her and headed upstairs to Dean's room. He slowly opened the door. Dean was sprawled out across the bed, laying on his back and snoring. Cas smiled. He walked over to the bed took a deep breath and yelled "Good morning Vietnam!" And shook the bed. Dean jumped up. "What the fuck!"
“You don't look fine. You're shaking.”
Cas ran his tongue from base to tip, flicking again at the slit. Dean arched his back and lifted his hips as a moan escaped his lips. Dean's hips were moving in rhythm with Cas. Suddenly, Dean wrapped his legs around Cas, who removed his mouth long enough to speak. "Oh yeah...." Cas was interrupted by Dean flipping him to his back. An evil grin crossed Cas' face.
Songs in the chapter
“When is your next heat little bitch!”
"DEAN!" Cas crouched next to Dean, who was staring Zachariah down with an anger that terrified him. He had never seen Dean like this. Cas put his hand on Dean's arm. "It's not worth it. He's not worth it." Dean didn't break his stare, but he lowered his arm. Zachariah seemed to heave a sigh of relief as Dean climbed off of him and turned back toward the house. Zachariah stood up.
"Yes sir. He's helping me in math and science. They're my worst subjects and I have to maintain a C average if I want to keep playing sports."
There wasn’t much more than a bed and a bathroom, which was more than enough for a one night stand. He cradled Anna’s face in has hands and looked at her for a moment before taking over her mouth. Anna returned his kiss, moving her hands under his shirt and working it over his head.
“What? Sam, no. I didn't even know he was here.” Dean said quickly.
"Mom?!" Cas pulled away from Dean and watched her walk towards them. Dean blinked.
Dean watched as Sam and Cas headed back to camp, Benny close on their heels to round up the Alphas. He looked back out at the tree line. The Betas were just sitting there.
"Surprised? Yes, I know. But my son is racing today and I decided I wasn't going to miss it."
"Look at me."
"Uh...what am I supposed to be kidding about?"
They all hung out until the fire was almost dead, then decided to call it a night. Benny, Adam, Charlie, and Meg all piled in Benny’s truck to go to their respective homes to sleep. Dean on the other hand, had other plans, and none of them included sleep. As soon as he closed the bedroom door, he pulled Cas in and kissed him, slowly. He thrust his tongue into Cas' mouth and brought his hips to his own, pushing him up against the door to the room. Cas ran his hands under Dean's shirt, feeling his way around his chest and down his torso, undoing the button on Dean's jeans when he got there. Cas slipped his hands just inside of the fabric of Dean's jeans and boxers, gripping the skin on Dean's hips and grinding himself against the other man’s cock. Dean pulled his shirt over his head and let it fall to the floor, then walked Cas back to the bed. He lowered Cas slowly, never breaking the kiss. When Cas was finally on his back, Dean worked at his own jeans, then Cas’, sliding them off of Cas' hips and thighs slowly until they were on the floor, kissing his chest and torso as he worked, stopping only to nip at the skin as he passed over. Dean bit his lip as he heard Cas let out a soft moan and felt him lift his hips from the bed. Dean smiled as he pinned Cas' hips to the bed. He moved to Cas' neck, gently biting as he went. Cas pushed his hips against Dean's, dragging his erection against his partner's. His breath hitched.
"I'll tell you when I get there. I just don't want to get worked up while I'm driving."
“Shut up. I smelled Dean on him so I assumed.” Alec retorted.
"Probably shouldn't drink anymore if you don't remember."
He started playing his guitar.
Cas walked over to the couch and sat next to Dean. He sighed. "Well, at least you tried. I appreciate that." He kissed Dean on the cheek. "I love you."
"What?!" He tried to get up.
"Are you asking me on a date Dean?"
"You think so?"
Nothing.
"You see? See what you've turned him into? He's become a shadow of your corruption! A walking sin!" Dean looked at her. "Excuse me?" He took a step closer to her. "What did you just call him?"
"Yes!" Cas ran up to Dean's room and got Charlie on the line. Then he called Adam. Dean had made his way to his room and was standing in the doorway. "All good?"
Dean smiled, backing away slowly.
"Yeah sorry, not interested" He hung up the phone. "Who was that?" Dean asked. He sat next to Cas. Cas put his phone on silent and put it in his pocket. "Just a stupid salesman." He lied. He didn't want to tell Dean and get him involved.
"Brother."
I take you, D-Dean, as my husband and partner in l-life." He was shaking and couldn't make it stop. He glanced at Dean. Dean smiled at him and gave a small nod to reassure him. Cas exhaled again. When did he stop breathing?
She smiled. "Clearly. You're like, my favorite singer! I have all the albums and I've been to three shows, which always kick ass!"
"I'm taking a nap."
Dean reached out to take his own cock in his hand. He was so close; that pain-­pleasure feeling was building and he was quickly shutting down. Cas grabbed Dean's hand and guided his arm back over his head.
Cas shrugged again. “I guess. I don't see anyone crossing Dean though. He's like everyone's savior or something.”
When it used to come so easy.
Dean sped up his pace, still nailing that certain spot deep inside Cas. Cas was moving his hips in unison with Dean by now, and Dean was unraveling fast.
"But you'll be working. Can't have you distracted."
"Four...three...two..."
To this broken Capulet
ENJOY!
"It'll wear off." Josh smiled. "Took me a while to get used to it. Just don't let it go to your head." Cas smiled. "That's why this dude is here. He keeps me level. One of the many reasons I love him."
"I'd take you to all the colleges you want to play for so you find the right one."
A few days later he was going through some of Dean's things for the hundredth time. he was folding one of Dean's uniforms when something fell out of one of the pockets. It was an envelope. He picked it up and turned it over. On the front, in Dean's neat handwriting, it said
Sam walked in. "Hey Dean, the Novaks are outside." Dean turned around. "Is Cas here yet?" Sam nodded. "Keep him inside. Don't tell him his parents are here." Again, Sam nodded and walked out.
“He keeps you busy, I take it?”
Cas sat up and streched. He rubbed his head and gave Dean a sleepy smile. "What time is it?" He stood up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Dean smiled, remembering Cas used to do that whenever he would spend the night when they were kids. "Almost nine." He replied as he grabbed a few plates. He put an even amount of eggs and sausage on the plates, then grabbed two forks and walked into the living room. He handed Cas his plate. "Ih! Hold on." He went to the refrigerator and returned with a bottle of ketchup. "You remembered." He smiled, taking the bottle and sitting on the couch. Dean sat next to him. They ate in silence. When they finished, Dean took Cas plate and took both plates to the kitchen and rinsed them off, as well as the pans and put them in the dishwasher. He walked back into the living room and sat next to Cas, turning on the TV. They watched reruns of Dr. Sexy until mid afternoon.
"Last time I checked, there was a Winchester behind the Novak, but yes."
"Well that didn't take long."
"You crashed. Don't move."
Cas climbed the stairs to the projection booth and opened the door. "Hey Rufus. Thanks for helping me." The man turned to Cas. "No problem kid. Got the video?" Cas handed him a flash drive. Rufus took it and download the contents. He played with a few things for a minute. "Alright, everything is set. It'll come on before the previews."
"I love you too."
"Yeah, well, moms do that. Their like lions or bears. Fuck with their young and the claws come out." Cas laughed. "I guess. This is the first problem like this my mom has delt with. And it happens to involve the whole city. I wouldn't be surprised if this made the news."
He closed his eyes but repeated the action. To his amazement, he did feel a little better.
Charlie punched Cas in the shoulder. "Are fucking serious right now?" Cas looked at her, shocked that she just punched him. "Yeah. I am. I'm a mess. He deserves better." Charlie punched him again.
"I'll go with you."
"What are those for?"
"I'm not going anywhere until I know that my boyfriend is okay you can put me in handcuffs if you want. I'm still not going anywhere." She walked over to him and pulled out her handcuffs then looked at the guards. "Get the other two boys too. As of right now, they are being charged with assault. I saw what happened. They had plenty of time to stop the hit after he got rid of the ball. They meant to do this." Cas looked at her. She returned the look before Cas looked back at Dean. The paramedics were around him. One slowly took his helmet off. Was this how Dean felt when he saw Cas lying on the road? He wouldn't admit to Dean or even Charlie that he did remember that moment. When he woke up on the ground and had seen Dean looking down at him. The look on Dean's face was a mix of being terrified and relieved. The sound of Dean's voice told Cas he was trying hard to keep it together. Cas didn't know why he didn't tell anyone, maybe he felt guilty for putting Dean through that."
"Hey Rookie!" Dean caught the five year old boy as he leaped. He scooped the boy up and put him on his hip.
“Entertainment would have been watching you beat my pompous father’s ass yesterday. But I'm sure this will have its merits, too.” Gabriel winked at Dean. "I'll get the folks." Gabriel stepped aside and let Dean walk in. Dean removed his hat and stood in the large foyer. Zachariah and Naomi walked into the room. "We have nothing to say to you." Zachariah said.
"Not bad Omega. Looks like your brother taught you well." The Alpha half smiled, taking a drink of water the Omega handed to him.
"Because you're slowly killing yourself Cas. I'm not just gonna sit on a fluffy cloud and watch you die!"
They finally met up with everyone. Sam handed Dean one of those happy new year hats. Dean flung it back at him. "I'm not wearing that."
"What about your mom?"
A phantom limb is all that I am hanging on
"Where the fuck have you been you little shit?!"
"Well, you're definitely good at it." Cas said to him. He took another bite. Dean took a bite of his own. Sam was right, he outdid himself. They talked about school, and what Sam has planned for after graduation. "I want to go to law school and become a lawyer." Dean nodded. "Good choice Sammy. What about Jess?" Sam set his fork  down. "She's going to be a doctor."
"What does that mean?"
Gabriel smiled and winked. He had always been one for sweets.
"Stay away from my wife!" Mr Novak shoved Dean right into Cas. They both hit the floor. "You okay?" Cas nodded. Dean looked at Mr Novak and stood up. Cas was right behind him. Dean walked right up to Mr Novak and punched him in the face. Mrs Novak started yelling. "Shut up." Dean spat. She went quiet. "This is what's gonna happen, you and your husband are going to get on a plane, go back to Michigan and forget you even had a son. If I ever see you around my fiance again it will be the last mistake you ever make." He pulled out his wallet and threw money into the air. "For your trip. Have a nice life" He stood there for a second until Cas took him by the arm and started pulling him away. "Come on Dean. Let's go."
As soon as they stepped inside, Dean was greeted with a hug from his mom. "I'm so glad you're here!" She said enthusiastically. Dean smiled. "Glad to be home. Can I at least take my jacket off?" He laughed. Mary pulled away. "Sorry. It's just been a few months since we've seen you." She replied. Dean set his duffel down and took off his jacket. Cas had his folded in his arms. Dean rolled his eyes and took it, hanging both on the rack.  Dean then noticed all eyes were on Cas. Dean knew they would be surprised. "You remember Cas everyone." It wasn't a question. Mary's eyes grew wide. "Oh my goodness! Of course!" She wrapped Cas in a hug, smiling. She pulled away and looked at him. "Look at you! You were a handsome kid but wow! You became quite the looker." Cas smiled, damn near blushing. "Thank you Mrs Winchester."
"Heard Winchester stood up for you." She smiled.
"Agreed. I miss you."
“Arm?”
Everyone slowly filtered out of the bar around midnight. Dean was the only one that wasn't drunk but he did have a good buzz going. Everyone tried to get him to drink more but he'd rather not drink so much. Dean, Jaxon, and a few others were walking through the ally between the bar and another building. They were still laughing about how crazy everyone acted in the bar. Everything happened very fast after that. Jaxon grabbed Dean's arm and spun him around. Before Dean knew what was happening, Jaxon's lips were on his. He pushed Jaxon off and saw someone standing far off behind them.
He thought. They had restrained him by chaining his arms and legs to the bed. Then he notice some rubber thing in his mouth.
Cas smiled and scooted in closer. He kissed Dean on the nose.Dean stirred a little, grunting as he woke up. He opened his eyes."Hi, creeper."
Ten minutes later he was knocking on Cas' door. As soon as the door opened, he pushed past Rob and made his way to the the stairs. Rob grabbed his arm. "Who the fuck are you?" Dean turned around slowly and looked at him. "Let go of me you sorry excuse of a human being." His voice cold and deadly. Rob flinched, but didn't let go. Dean simply pulled his arm free and continued to the stairs. "Julie, call the police." Dean stopped and turned around, smiling. "Yeah Julie. Call the cops. I'm sure they'd love to take both of you in for child abuse and child molestation. Not to mention the drugs that you have sitting on the table." Both of them stared at him. "Yeah, that's what I though. Free rids over fuckers. Cas isn't living here anymore." Rob grabbed him and pinned him against the wall. "See, I was hoping you would do something like this, because now the ass kicking I'm about to give you is self defense." Dean shoved Rob off him. Rob punched Dean in the face. Dean tackled him to the floor and started punching him in the face. "Dean!" His uncle pulled him off Rob before he did any life threatening. "Hey, calm down kid! You're here to get Cas' things not kill his foster dad!" Dean dealt one final blow in the form of a kick to Rob's head then let Bobby drag him up the stairs to Cas' room. Dean had managed to grab Cas' keys before Bobby took the bike to the shop.
Breakdown by Seether
Alec pushed Dean off of him and stood up, smiling.
"You're welcome." He laughed. Dean pulled him close. "You're amazing, you know that?" Cas smiled. "It's been said." Kissing Dean before getting up. "Alright ladies and boyfriend, our plane leaves in two hours. Let's go shopping."
"I've been here for…” Cas counted on his fingers. “You mother fucker. You set this up?"
Alec looked at him. “Why would I be mad? Because you got in my face when I was just trying to help?”
"That I will always love you. And I'm not afraid to love you the way you deserve to be loved. Because of the war, I'll have bad days but you already know that. I want the good days to matter, to make them the best days ever. To be happy with you right by my side. And for you to not be afraid of the bad, the flashbacks I may have, the nightmares. Because after all of it, I'll still love you. I'll never stop loving you. So before I came home, I got something." He stood up. Cas stood as well. He dug in his pocket then got down on one knee. Cas' eyes widened. "Castiel Novack. Our time together has been the most amazing two and a half years of my life. While I was in Germany this time, I dreamed of this moment. And I promise that if you'll have me, I will spend every waking moment making the rest of our lives amazing." Tears streamed down Cas' face. With tears in his eyes he took Cas' hand and showed him the ring. "Will you do me the amazing honor of marrying me?" Speechless, Cas nodded. Dean smiled as he slid the ring on his finger. He stood and kissed Cas softly. "I love you Cas. Now and forever. I promise." He never broke his promises to Cas.
They chased him through the house and outside. The rest of the gang followed, including Dean, after he put on some pants.
Desperate Measures by Marianas Trench  (written as JTH)
I should know you as well
After dinner they walked to the theater. Cas bought the tickets and handed them to Dean. "You guys go in. There's something I need to do real quick." He gave Dean a quick kiss and walked off. "Any idea what he's talking about?" Dean asked the girls. They shrugged. "Maybe he has to pee." Meg said. Charlie linked arms with Dean. "Come on, let's go get our seats. He'll find us."
"Bitch."
Dean nodded and hugged him. "Thank you." He whispered to him. Dean kissed his cheek.
"Where's Meg...? Oh there! I'm gonna go dance with my girl. Behave." Cas laughed. "And you've known me for how long?"
"Hey! Give it back Cas!" Dean reached for the picture. Cas kept it out of his reach. He got up, Dean followed. "Come on Cas!" Cas held out the picture, Dean went to grab it and Cas pulled it away. "Gonna have to be faster than that Winchester." Cas ran from the living room to the kitchen, Dean chased him around the table. "Come on Cas, this isn't funny."
"My family. I'm not like them. Never have been."
Dean hit his helmet and shook his head. "Fucking ridiculous." He started walking back with Benny. Lawrence got the extra point. A player from the other team shoulder checked Dean. "Watch it fag." Dean stopped and looked at him. "What did you just call me?" The kid turned and looked at him.
Charlie was staring him down. She wanted more information and a stare down is how she always got it when they were kids. Cas rolled his eyes.
"I love you, too." He whispered into Dean's lips. Dean slid down the shower wall to the floor of the tub, taking Cas with him in his arms. The water was still on. Cas buried his face in Dean's chest and sighed. "You mean, we could have been doing that for the last decade but we choose not to?"
Dean looked at him. "And you've never acted like this before."
Cas' phone buzzed on the table. "It's Charlie." He picked it up and answered.
"Just the usual. Can't sing, so I can't work. Which means I just sit here. And you're leaving for training and I'm gonna be stuck here all by myself."
"No, I mean..."
As Cas stroked him through his orgasm, the sound of Dean made him come.
Dean ran a hand down his face and sighed. "Dammit. Alright, I'm on it. Call you later."
"Hey Red."
He tapped his pencil on his desk then flicked his eyes back to Dean
Cas flipped her off with a smile. Dean put a finger under Cas' chin, tipping his head up slightly. "I love you."
"Cas?"
Dean had an incredible body for a seventeen year old. He looked like a God carved out of marble. He didn't notice before because he was drunk and was just trying to get off.
"You got it!"
Dean played the guitar on cue while Cas continued singing and playing the piano.
"Oh my God, Cas! You look like shit."
He woke up at his usual time and got dressed, which was a little difficult with a broken arm. His shoulder had pretty much healed already, it was just really sore now.
"Yes sir. Top twenty."
"Yes, I remember. Have a seat." He did as he was told. "Alright Winchester. You said you want to be a paratrooper, correct? " Dean swallowed. "Yes sir."
He looked over at the stands. Cas and Charlie decided to stay and watch the whole game. Dean smiled. "Red eighty-five!" He yelled. His teammates moved into position. "Red eighty-five!" He looked back and forth down the line to make sure his guys were in the right place. He looked down. "Hut!" The ball was snapped. He caught it and took three wide steps back. He couldn't find Cole and he was in danger of being sacked. He tucked the ball under his arm and ran. Benny and Cain guarded him until they got taken down. Dean was faster than people thought. He was well ahead and pretty much walked it in for a touchdown. The crowd jumped to their feet and cheered. Dean took off his helmet and raised it above his head, smiling. His team gathered around him and patted him on the back, shoulders, and head. He looked at the clock. Just enough time for one more play. He ran over to the coach. The both looked at the clock, then at each other. "Think you got one more in you Winchester?" Dean looked at the bleachers to see Cas and Charlie were dancing with the band music. He laughed then looked back at the coach. "Yes sir."
Cas lead Dean back out to the main area of the bar. A few people were staring at them as they came out of the bathroom, to which Cas responded by adjusting his belt and winking. Dean smiled and pretend to fix his hair and shirt.
"Well hell boy, your dad's a fuckin' hero son! Good man." He looked over his shoulder. "Put Winchester in the 101st." He turned back to Dean. "Grab your bags kid. You're with me."
“Says the man that has saved damn near one hundred people by bringing them here.”
"Oh, well congratulations."
He had just made the arrangements to have his mom transported back to Kansas. He sighed, putting his phone in his pocket and put his new helmet on. Looks like he was going back to Kansas to make funeral arrangements. He started the bike and took off down the road. He had to make a quick stop first.
Dean laughed and shook his head. "Cas... Castiel yes. Yes I will marry you!" He pulled Cas in close and kissed him.
Dean stopped the horse and Cas. “Let me see.”
“Where the fuck did you learn that, anyway?” Dean breathed.
"It's okay." Cas put his hand on Dean's. "Really. You were worried. You've been there through a lot but that was..."
Cas gave a half smile. “I've been better. Just came out to my mom. She wouldn't shut up about me finding a wife.”
Behind Benny, Dean himself was staring at the two, his face went pale.
Adam turned to face Charlie as he lit a match. “You might want to step back.” Charlie's eyes widened. “Oh shit!” She turned and ran toward the parked vehicles.
He couldn't hear anything outside the cell, or smell anything except the small traces of the last Omega that was in here. He could smell traces of a fresh winter's snow and clean linen, trying to imagine what the last Omega looked like, trying to focus on anything other than the quiet...or Dean.
"I've never backed down from a challenge have I.... oh my God..." Dean laughed as his husband shuddered in response to Dean gently massaging his tip with his fingers.
"So Mr. Novak, how did it feel having sex with your high school crush turned lover?" Meg asked.
"Are you kidding me?! You're a lyrical genius!"
In all the excitement, Cas fell asleep halfway home. Dean dropped Charlie off first. "Dean?" "Yeah?" "I don't think I've ever seen Cas this happy and he deserves everything that happened tonight." "I know. I knew he'd bring the house down. He's more at home on a stage in front of screaming people thanhe is anywhere else." Charlie smiled. "Yeah. Well, I'm out. I can hear my bed yell my name from here. Night Dean."
"Adam, dude. It's not a fucking D cord you fucktard! It's a fucking G for Christ sake." He told Adam for the thousandth time.
"Figures." She said when she saw the kit for Heroin.
Cas plopped down on the bed next to Dean. "Well? What'd the big, bad asshat say?"
“Not my fault you don’t knock or, heaven forbid, wait.” He pulled the sheet up higher and sat up. Charlie plopped herself next to him. “Thought we could go for a walk and chat. I haven’t been able to talk to you much.”
"I think we got what we asked for." Dean looked at Cas.
"Lucky's it is, then. A burger sounds fantastic."
"For as long as I live."
Cas snaked his arm around Dean's waist. "A thank you would suffice. Or a blow job. Either works."
Time seemed to freeze as they sat in the waiting room. "How to you know Castiel?" The cop asked. Dean had his head back looking at the ceiling. Charlie was staring at her feet. "I'm his friend. I've known him since he moved here." Charlie replied quietly. Dean leaned forward, his arms on his knees. "I'm his boyfriend." He said tonelessly, looking over at the cop. The cop looked up from his notebook to Dean. Dean continued to look at him. "That's not a joke. We've been together for a few weeks." The cop looked back at his little notebook. "To your knowledge, has Castiel ever done drugs?" Dean leaned back in his seat. Charlie looked up at the cop. She had no idea. Cas would be pissed at him, but they would find the heroin in his system soon enough. So Dean stalled. "Look, can we finish this later? I just found my boyfriend half dead on the side of the road." The cop closed that stupid notebook and nodded, walking out of the room. When he was gone, Dean got up and walked into the hall. Charlie followed. He looked down the hall to see a doctor walking over to them. Dean tugged on Charlie's jacket and nodded in the doctors direction. They both held their breath.
They walked down the hill to the Omega cabins, which were spaced out enough so the others couldn't be seen. Ellen lead him on a different path up a different hill.
He kept his eyes closed, still smiling as a breeze blew on his face.
"Your dad."
"When don't I?" He buttoned up his shirt. "Good point. How did Dean find you anyway?"
"Well that's surprising. I bet most of them don't even really remember me." He rubbed his head.
Zachariah stared at Dean, wide-eyed. He started to speak when Gabriel interrupted him.
"And backstage passes. I won a contest while you were in rehab. It was for a chance to play on stage with Marianas Trench." Cas looked at him. "Are you serious?" Dean smiled. "Holy shit! This is amazing!" He practically jumped on Dean and kissed him. "How did you win?" He asked when he pulled away. "I had to finish a part of one of their songs. They announced the contest a few weeks in advance so I memorized all of their songs."
Better than, better than, better than
Lover Dearest by Marianas Trench  (written as JTH)
“We all are.” Alec smirked.
It was around four when the movie ended. Dean pulled up in front of the house and turned the car off. "That was fun." He smiled, getting out. He walked around and opened Cas' door. "Yeah, it was. We should do this more often." They walked up the path and Dean unlocked the door. "We could have a date night every Saturday." He suggested, opening the door. "Yeah, that sounds good."
Dean sighed. "Yeah, yeah, Gabe. Glad I can entertain you."
“Stop talking.”
"I know that for a fact. What you're doing isn't a solution."
“Yep. And he's not getting away with it. Go put RJ away. I'll be back.”
Dean growled. “Dammit guys! Nothing happened okay? We didn't mate! Why is this such a big deal?”
I could be your perfect disaster
He flipped it over and sat down, Cas followed suit. Dean put one hand in his pocket and stared at it. "Are you sure everything's okay Dean?" Dean looked forward. The sun was starting to set. He smiled. "Do you remember, we were sitting right here when our tattoos first started glowing, and we thought we were superheros?" His kept looking at the sky in front of him. Cas chuckled. "How could I forget?" Dean's smile grew. He was silent for a monent. He could feel Cas' eyes on him. He brought his hand out of his pocket as well as a small box. He looked at Cas and opened it to reveal a ring.
"Yeah."
Jeff clapped his hands together. "Let's do this, fellas."The four gathered on the stairs and positioned themselves according to what the photographer asked.Dean laughed as Cas' overgrown hair kept falling in his face. Cas flipped him off. After a few hours of shooting, the photographer called it."We have so many great shots. I can't wait to show you all the finished product."
He would swear he felt his own heart stop.
Gabriel smiled. "Well it's about damn time, Cassie."
“That close to heat are ya? Not surprised. Dean said he was having a little bit of difficulty keeping you warm.”
“Yup. Cleaned it up, too.” Cas put his hands on his hips. Dean looked around the room. “I see that. Nice. I love it. So, uh… what’s the occasion?”
The door opened. A pretty redhead with blue eyes looked up at him. “Hello, Dean.” Dean smiled at her. “Hey, Anna. It’s been… too long.” She smiled at Dean as she looked him up and down. “It definitely has, farmboy.” Anna stepped aside and let Dean into the room.
"That you did."Dean pulled Cas in for a hug.
"When do I ever keep it clean?" Cas asked, a crooked smile on his face.Dean sighed. "Never." He gave Cas a quick kiss on the cheek.
Just like I do
Dean kissed Cas. "Bye, Perfect Disaster."
The song ended and they went right into the next one. They played Desperate Measures, Lover Dearest, Ever After, and All To Myself. Cas was out of breath and sweating because he was jumping up and down and dancing pretty much the whole time.
Prom night was upon them. Cas was literally throwing his clothes all over the room trying to find the right outfit. "Whoa. Hurricane Cas, calm down."
"Don't want me to meet the parents yet?" He grinned.
"Shut up and clean yourself off." They cleaned themselves off, and then the floor, and the wall. Dean looked around the room. "I hope you guys don't use blacklights in here."
Cas laughed a little. “I was actually getting ready to pack because I was volunteering for breeding.”
Cas trotted down the stairs, slapping Dean's ass as he passed by. "A woman wouldn't know how to handle your jerky. Now... how do I look?"
"Are you any good at cooking ground beef?"
Charlie sat back in her chair. "I can't believe he wanted to meet me."
"Speaking of home, have you like, been there?"
One minute until midnight. Some people started counting down. The rest blew into their noise makers, but everyone was watching the count down clock. Dean had his arm around Cas' waist, holding him close. Just seconds left now.
“Why a movie?” Dean asked.
"Listen, you're going to need to get back here. You're still in college. There are rules."
About half way through some of the kids stopped and stared. Some laughed and pointed. But Cas really didn't care. He was just trying to have some fun with his best friend. When the song was over Charlie leaned in the car and turned the music down. "You're crazy Novak." She laughed. He smiled and shrugged. He put his guitar back in her car. She rolled up the window and locked it. Cas put his arm around her and they walked into the building. "So, band playing tonight?" She asked. He looked down and smiled then looked at her. "Of course, it is Friday after all." He replied. She smiled and nodded. "Can't wait." Charlie always showed up at his concerts. Cas is the lead singer and guitar for a cover band he and a few of his friends formed in the eighth grade. They were even in the talent show at the end of the year. They played "All the small things" By Blink 182. They walked down the hall to their lockers. They were only a few lockers away from each other, so they could still talk. "What are you playing tonight?" Charlie asked. Cas unlocked his locker and opened it. "Seether, Mayday Parade, MCR, Dead By Sunrise, From First To Last, and The Summer Set." He replied as he dug out the books he'll need for his morning classes. "Oh! What songs?" She asked excited. He looked at her and smiled.
“You won't. I'm not in heat so you won't go bat shit crazy.”
"Wow, really?"
"Let's hope."
"Oh good, you're awake."
So, how did you like the chapter? Was it worth the wait? Oh and for those reading my other story Silence of a Whisper, I'll be updating that soon! Anyways! Don't forget to comment and let me know what you think!
"You want me to fuck you Dean?"
"One more song!"
"What's the boyfriend tag?"
Dean sat up. "Cas, chill. They'll be fine."
"Sorry! I'm just really happy!"
He took off in a dead sprint. Before he got any closer, Benny grabbed Dean around the waist. Dean fought Benny, and hard. "No! They're still in there! Let me the fuck go! When the fire department arrived, Dean just stood there, not moving. Not talking.
"Good morning. I'm gonna make us breakfast. No rush, okay?"
I think I want to marry you
"Like, just got loud?"
Dean type it in, finding mainly videos about the video game Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2, until he came across a channel that had a little over one thousand subscribers. He clicked on it. The first video was a cover of a band Dean had never heard of. He didn't like the song that much, so he went to a different video titled "We Like It Loud"
"Let's do this!" Cas grabbed Dean by the hand and walked out of the room behind Josh, the band and Charlie and Meg following. As they reached the ballroom, Cas stopped and took a deep breath.
"More like, fucked De..."
Castiel looked up at him.
"Fine, fine!" Cas carefully tore the paper back and opened the box. His eyes lit up. A shiny gold band with two gemstones set in it looked up at him. "Dean, what...?"Dean licked his lips. "It's a promise ring. Because I promise to never leave you. Ever."
"Where is he when I need him Benny?" Dean flicked his eyes to his friend. "Why would he just leave? Now...now you guys and Sam are all I have left. What am I gonna tell Sam?" Dean looked up at Benny. Benny didn't know what to say. Dean was beyond hurt.
"Nope. Pandora and RJ are brother and sister. Pandora's older by two years. RJ is two years old."  Cas scratched his head.
“Everyone but me.” Cas put his hands in his pockets and stepped to the side. “I was living my life, having a decent time in my comfortable apartment and shiny office and you all were here. Suffering. I’m an ass. I honestly don’t know how you can all be so welcoming after what I did.”
************
Killing the Alphas was just a way for the Betas to keep control. The first killings were thought to be serial killers, but then, after a while a large group of Betas stepped forward after a Beta became president when the last was assassinated in his own home.
"Please, spandex is way better." He gave Dean a quick kiss. "Gotta go. I have to go tell the principal and give him time to decide."
Later that night, Dean and Cas were in Dean's cabin, sitting on the bed playing Go Fish. It did take Dean a little while to calm down, but everything was back to normal when he did.
"Not anymore."
“I've been taking the blockers.”
Dean threw off the covers and got out of bed, completely forgetting he was in only boxers. Cas made a noise, blushed, and looked away. Dean got dressed quickly. He noticed Cas was in pajamas.
Cas took his guitar off and threw his pick into the crowd. His eyes met Dean's. Dean was smiling. He whistled and Charlie was screaming. Cas smiled at them and winked before going backstage. Charlie met him back there. "Kick ass show Cassie!" She hugged him even though he was covered in sweat. He smiled as he put his guitar away. "Always." He teased. She rolled her eyes. "Hey, I'm gonna catch a ride with Meg. See you at school." She kissed his cheek and practically bounced out of the room. Cas shook his head. "Too bad you both play for different teams, you'd make a cute couple." His band-mate Adam said.
They did numerous surgeries on his legs over the next few weeks. Both his legs in splints to help him walk, but he still had to use a wheelchair for a month and walk using crutches until they could get him into physical therapy in the states. He really didn't give a shit because he could finally go home.
"Uh, have you seen my mom? She should have been here by now..."
Great.
"Really Cas?"
“Please Dean...come inside me...”
Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go
"I'M GONNA PARTY WITH JOSH RAMSAY OH MY FUCKING SHIT!"
"Oh, so it's a 'get to know you' date."
"Did you expect any less?"
"Yeah yeah, the old Cas is back which means you're all in a shit load of trouble." He grinned and grabbed a beer from the fridge.
He assumed it was there so he didn't try to bit off his tongue. The though was appealing...but try as he might, he couldn't get the damn thing out of his mouth.
"Oh, how nice of him."
"Okay, then." Cas pulled out almost all the way and rammed back in, hitting that cluster of nerves at full force. "Fuck Cas!"
Cas grabbed his boxers and put them on under the blanket. He got up, ran across the room and grabbed their phones, pushing past them.
Cas let out a strangled yell as he finished. They stayed there for a minute or so before he pulled out and grabbed some toilet paper and cleaned himself and Dean off. They were still catching their breath as they pulled up their pants.
Dean walked into the sound booth, paying no attention to the other band members. He stood in front of Cas, hands on both sides of Cas' face staring into those electric blue eyes. "I'm... I'm so sorry..."
The years had definitely been good to Dean, there was no denying that, even if Cas tried his hardest. Dean was muscular, no doubt from all of the hours he put in working the ranch. His skin was tanned from working outside in the sun, and his hair was a little lighter from the same force of nature. All of those elements did everything Cas did not want them to do to him at that moment, especially the way Dean’s emerald eyes stood out...
Everyone was seated. Dean and Cas were at the front of the room. Sam tapped his fork on his glass. The room fell quiet and he stood up. "Okay, so before we get started, mom, dad, Jess, and myself put together a video for you." The room went dark as a projection screen emerged. A picture of Dean and Cas taken for the engagement announcement popped up. Over it it said Dean and Castiel. "Oh here we go." Dean whispered. Cas nudged him.
Present Day
Charlie dropped her fork. "Seriously?! Vegas?! Holy crap!" Cas pulled the tickets out of his pocket and passed them around. "First class. Being a rock star does have it's advantages." He smiled. "Well what are we waiting for?!" Charlie exclaimed. Cas laughed. "First, since we didn't pack, we'll need clothes. I figured we'd hit up the mall."
"Will do Mrs Winchester."
"He's driven and he loves what he does. And he's awesome at it. Win or lose tonight he is going to rock the house."
"One...HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
Cas stared at Dean, stone faced.
"No, dipshit. You lookin at his window." Adam put his hands in his pockets and looked at Dean. "You know, it ain't a crime to tell someone how you feel..."
The camera went to Josh.
“I'm not leaving until you tell me.”
"Cole Trenton? Running back on the football team?"
"I'm staying right here with you."
"No. By beating it out of him." He pointed his baseball bat at Cas.
Cas pulled back after a few seconds.
"By not freaking out for one. Just talk to me or something. Tell me a story, sing, just do something."
He unlocked the door and stepped inside, hanging the keys on the hook. He took off his shoes and walked into the living room then collapsed on the couch. He made sure the volume on his phone was turned up all the way in case Charlie or Ellen called then put his arm over his face, falling asleep in seconds.
"Bullshit I can’t! That's my husband! I'm going in there!" He tried to get free. He could hear machines going off and everyone was running around and...was someone doing CPR?
Meg accepted, bending down and putting the pen shell in a nostril, closing the other and snorted the line. Sniffing, she handed the pen shell to him and he did the same.
"I can tell by the way your breath changes. Don't worry Cas. Nothing can keep me away from you for very long."
The Omega grabbed the injured Beta's side arm and readied it.
Dean opened his eyes and looked at him. “Because this is dangerous and I need you to help Sam. That's how you can help.”
"I want to do a music video." Josh smiled. "Oh hell yeah! Count me in! Tell me what to do."
Cas looked up at him. He shrugged and continued sipping his coffee. Dean didn't push the subject.
June 1941
"Don't make out with anyone."
Dean hung up. Jaxon pushed him out the door. "Okay, okay I'm goin jeez." He laughed. "Well, we can't start without you." Jaxon walked around him, leading the way. Jaxon was a little shorter than Dean and had a small muscular frame. He always said he was built for speed. It must be true too because Jaxon was damn near untouchable.
By the way, yes the title is from the Kenny Chesney song. It fits.
At lunch, everyone else ordered beer and Cas ordered a nice Chardonnay. When they picked up Naomi's dress, Cas made sure to nitpick the fabric and take extra time to find her shoes that complimented the look. Gabriel just watched and laughed.
"The last month has not exactly been a vacation, babe."
C. Novak
Oh that's
Jeff, the drummer, was getting some cake. "Nice job, Cas! You're probably the best."
~*~*~
"You did what you had to do. Nobody blames you."
"Like what you see?"
"Wha... what?" Cas looked at Dean, snapping to attention. Dean laughed. "I said, you'll be great. So stop the nervous fidgeting."
"Castiel,"
Dean looked at him for a second then back to the sky. "It's not fair. Who's gonna be my sidekick now?"
"Because I can't sing."
Cas was on his knees in front of Dean. Still holding his soaked over shirt to Dean's cut.
"You're good to them."
So. As a whole, how did you enjoy the story? I absolutely loved writing this!
"No you don't."
Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow
"At the store. She uh, hit me with her cart." Dean smiled and brought the cup close to his lips. "Thank God for texting and shopping." He took another sip.
He laid Cas on the bed and went downstairs to get a glass of water. Then to the bathroom and grabbed two Tylenol.
"Yeah, see ya." Dean was focused on the man that was now walking up to the car.
"How about no?" He turned to leave. He felt a hand on his shoulder and was spun around. "Please! Just listen!" Cas pushed him away. "Don't touch me!" He turned around. Walking away he heard something click. He stopped and turned around. "Oh good. A gun. Ya know, I was missing the good old days of almost dying."
"Fuck my life. I swear you're trying to kill me. Everyone better have the background vocals before I come back tomorrow." He looked back down at the lyrics. "Alright one more time."
He slid in the seat in front of Cas. "Sorry I'm late. Class got out late." Cas looked up at Dean and closed his menu, smiling. "I figured that when you text me twenty times." He mused. Dean blushed. "Too much?" He shifted. He had never been on a date before. Cas shook his head. "No Dean. It's fine." His smile reached his eyes, like it did when they were kids. Dean rubbed the back of his neck. "Sorry. This is all foreign to me." Cas took a drink of his water before saying, "It is to me too, but if it wasn't meant to be Dean, we wouldn't be here." Dean looked at the bright blue design on his wrist. It was true. If it wasn't meant to be, it would be glowing. It wouldn't have began to glow ten years ago on a playground.
Cas was finally feeling at home on the stage again. He had almost forgotten how good it felt to be up there, in the lights, playing his music and interacting with the fans. It's what he'd always been good at. The crowd was going nuts. During Celebrity Status he jumped off stage and walked through the crowd singing and jumped along with them.
He hit him again.
"Nothing like an overdose to put life in prospective." He walked past Dean to the bed and sat down. "This is gonna get boring." He fell back on the bed. Dean sat next to him. "Speaking of which..."
Arriving at the cake table, Cas signaled a waiter with a thumbs up. The waiter disappeared for a moment, returning with...
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
"I'll always love you too." His eyes never opened again after that.
"That didn't answer my question."
Cas laughed. “Something like that.”
"Birthday?"
"His right lung is filling with fluid and close to collapsing. They need to drain the fluid before that happens."
"Well, sit, y'all. We have a lot of work to do and I'm only here in the office until Friday."
Dean and Whiskey landed the jump. Cas pumped a fist in the air. “Woo! Hell yeah, Winchester! I knew she’d do it!” He high-fived Dean as he rode past.
"Babe, you have outdone yourself. This is.... beyond anything...."
“I don't know! I panicked. I don't think my mom wants to see me naked on the living room floor about to have sex.” Cas shrugged.
“Castiel, my baby! It has been far too long!”
“I should go, let you get back to sleep.”
Dean slept for about two hours. He streched and yawned as he stood up. Hearing everyone talking when he reached the stairs, he decided to listen.
"I...wouldn't mind running a poll." Charlie piped up. Cas looked at her. "Really? You'd do that?"
"I'm serious. You are."
Two... Pulled him close.
Silence.
Cas got out of bed and walked to where Dean was, not caring that he didn’t have any pants on. He wrapped his arms around Dean from behind, kissing him on the shoulder. "I'm here, baby. I've got you." Dean clenched his jaw. "I'm fine Cas. Really. Go back to bed."
"Nah, not me Mrs W. My mama's making meatloaf." Benny said. The others also politely declined.
"Don't. Don't you dare say you're sorry. Not you." He threw the bottle at the wall. It shattered, causing Dean to jump a little.
Then he found the email of the cover art and picked out a few. Now it was time to write the thank yous. Cas went into detail on a few. After he was finished with that, he sent it to the label along with the album tracks. "Well now that that's done, time to do some interviews. Which we have to go all around the country to do." The first interview was a local radio station. Then they had an interview with MTV where the were giving a performance.
"I can hear you."
"Cas..." There was that bundle of nerves again. "...the table..."
"Ever had sex on Ecstasy?"
They kept it a secret.
"What's one thing you don't like about me?"
"Wasn't his fault mom. Total misunderstanding." Naomi glanced at Cas, and then back at Dean. "Well, I know how happy you guys are together. Congratulations." She hugged Dean and then hugged Cas. "I'm going to lay down. Behave yourselves."
"Word travels fast."
They went silent, the only sound was their breathing and the crickets outside. Dean walked over to the bed and sat down. He ran his fingers through his hair and looked down.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean sighed. “Just enjoying the view for a moment.” Cas threw Dean's boxers onto the bed.
Don’t you wanna love,
Cas fell asleep on the couch. Charlie had just gotten up to go to bed when her phone vibrated in her pocket. She moved to the other room and answered.
Cas acted shocked. "But, ma, I'm a perfect angel..." Naomi rolled her eyes at her son and walked off to her room. Dean snorted. Cas winked at him. "Oh yeah, food. What are you in the mood for?" Dean pursed his lips in thought. "Hmm, whatever you decide to make." He took a drink of his soda.
Adam took that as his cue to exit the room.
the way. He brushed himself off and kept dancing down the sidewalk.
He pulled off behind an old warehouse downtown before the highway. He got off his bike and took his helmet off, carrying it in his arm.
"By Monday morning."
“Dean!” Sam began to protest, but Dean shot him a look and he fell silent.
"It's the same bar..."
"Likewise."
"I hate you both." Cas said as he cleared the table. "But that does give me an idea for Desperate Measures. Well, when we actually sign with someone and start playing shows."
"Hey cock block."
"Mom, is it on?"
The kept him alive for reasons he didn't know. They had put a steel plate in the back of his head. It was a miracle that he didn't get blown in half. There really must be a God. The last thing he remembered before waking up in a cell was Adam. Saying he'd tell Cas he went out like a hero. Cas. The Army must have told him by now that he's dead. His heart sank. Cas thinks he's dead. If he didn't get our of here he might as well be. Dean was to weak to do anything. He couldn't walk because of his legs. He was surprised he still had them. He still lost consciousness frequently, but he refused to die. He promised Cas he'd come home to him. Alive. The "back in one piece" part was a little harder since part of his skull is in the woods somewhere. His head was exploding with pain. He fought to stay conscious but still faded.
(My love)
Cas looked at him. "I know. I'm just being selfish."
Adam turned and looked at Dean, smiling.
"I'm joking around Dean."
“Stay away from my mate!” Dean growled.
Cas looked at him. "Oh yeah." He smiled and stood up.
"You didn't ask. And it wasn't another Appaloosa. The son of a bitch shacked up with Whiskey. Twice."
"I would be if traffic wasn't such a bitch. I'll get there eventually."
Castiel patted RJ's neck and kissed his nose. He exhaled and put his forehead on the horse's’ nose. "This is all so... so... fucking complicated. I don't know what to do. Do I want him? Yes. Does he want me? Probably. Are we both too stubborn to admit it to each other? Definitely. What do you think, RJ?"
He was woken up by the scent of cinnamon and spring rain. He rolled over to see Cas next to him in his bed. He shook his head, smiling and running his fingers through his hair. The door slammed open making both men jump and sit up.
Dean grabbed Cas' hands and pinned them over his head. Cas' shirt raised, revealing from his hips to his bellybutton. Dean moved down and kissed Cas' hip. He pulled Cas' jacket off his shoulders and moved to Cas' neck. Brushing his lips up to his jaw as Cas took off his jacket. Dean put his hand on Cas' back and lifted him, pulling off his shirt. Cas unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans and kicked off his shoes. Dean tugged the jeans off, leaving him in his boxers. Dean, however, was already dressed for the occasion. Wearing nothing but boxers. He ran his hands up Cas' body, his head following. Pressing and grinding on Cas' erection. Cas' head fell back in a soft moan. Fourteen days. That was the last time they touched each other. Now, it seemed with Cas' newfound sobriety, his senses were heightened. He then realized that he had some kind of drug in his system every time they had sex. Hell every time he had sex at all, even before Dean.
"Come on Sam, I didn't get a chance to do this last time."
"Then why are you laughing?" He ran to the front door and stopped. "Don't you dare." Dean warned. Cas wagged his eyebrows and opened the door. "Cas..." He slowly backed out the door, still smiling. Dean ran to him, he grabbed for the picture again. Cas ran out the door and jumped off the porch, running down the path. John, Mary, and Sam stood on the porch. Mary took a few pictures. "Oh thanks, take pictures...big help." Dean said and continued to chase Cas around the yard. Dean finally grabbed Cas around the waist and wrapped his arms around him. "Gotcha!"
"We'd lose anyway."
Hey everyone! real quick update here...
"Alright, I've been scoping out the competition and there is only one horse that might give RJ some trouble and I'm not talking about speed wise. The horse's name is Little Demon, the rider's name is Crowley. They both play dirty. I've seen Crowley hit other riders with his whip and the horse runs into other horses." Charlie leaned against the trailer. Cas sighed.
He watched Dean's muscles tighten and relax, the beads of sweat forming on his forehead, they way he licked his lips right after he moaned.
“I...you...” He sighed. “I can't even be mad at that.”
"I know you will. Like always."
Cas was sitting on the floor drumming on his legs with the plastic utensils from lunch, trying to do anything to keep his mind off the itch and craving. Nothing was really helping, so he decided to lightly bang his head on the wooden foot board of the bed. chanting "Fuck my life" in time with his head hitting the wood. At least it relieved the boredom for a bit, until he got a headache. Two days and he was already going insane. He forgot he had music going. The mix that Dean gave him was playing. He hadn't listened to it all the way through, only the first couple songs. The current song ended followed by about ten seconds of silence. Then...
He hit the message icon.
Sure, he's been bullied and beaten up. But it'll be a million times worse now. He'll probably get jumped first thing Monday. Then all day after that.
"Finish that sentence and I'll kill you."
"Call it a halftime pick me up."
Cas sat back and continued to watch the band set up. A few minutes later, the waitress brought out a bottle of Jack Daniels and two shot glasses. Cas looked at the bottle then to Dean. "Remember drinking this at suicide drop?"
"You and Castiel want to have a sleepover?" Dean grabbed two apples out of the bowl on the counter and handed one to Cas. "Bingo!" He grinned. "We already asked his parents." Without even waiting for a response, the boys ran out of the kitchen and up to Dean's room. Dean took a bite of his apple and closed his door.
Dean laughed a little. “You pick.”
Just like I do
"Don't be surprised if the paparazzi comes knocking."
Dean chuckled. "Got one packed Missouri."
"Now boarding, flight 293 to Los Angeles at gate 2A."
"The auditorium at school."
Dean put his arm around Cas and helped him away from the table. "G'night everybody!" Cas slurred. Dean pushed opened the door. Cas' head fell on Dean's shoulder and giggled. "Helping me to your car..."
"Uh-huh."
"You're in high demand here too." He sighed, sitting up and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. "It's bad enough when I'm on tour for half a year..."
"So what will the first single be off the album?"
Dean rolled his eyes and took the phone. "Okay, last question. Where do you see yourself in five years?"
"What about your parents?" Dean asked. Cas shrugged. "What about them?" He flipped through the wedding invitations. "Are you going to invite them?" Cas looked at him. "I don't see why since the whole point of moving was to get me away from you." Dean was flipping through a "save the date" book. They decided on a summer wedding. "They're your parents Cas. You should still invite them."
Cas sighed again. “Let’s go before grandma has a stroke.” The horn went off again, and grandma was leaning out of the passenger side window. “Move it, Naomi!”
"I didn't know until an hour ago and you wouldn't answer your phone."
"Back home." Castiel choked on his coffee.
Dean shrugged and rolled his eyes. "Well, it's my job, isn't it? I like taking care of you."
Dean looked up again. They may not have the same class, but they were in the same hall. There was one boys bathroom in each hall. He got up and grabbed the hall pass for the bathroom and walked out. He walked towards the bathroom, mind racing. He really didn't want to fight with Cas, but he needed to know what was going on with him. He pushed open the door to see Cas leaving a stall. "Cas." Cas jumped, something fell from his hand and hit the marble floor. Dean saw what it was before Cas picked it up. "Are you fucking kidding me right now?" He locked the door and walked over to Cas and pushed him against the stall. "Are you crazy or just plain stupid? I really want to know. What the hell are you doing drugs for?! In school!" Cas looked at him. "Keep it down Winchester or you'll get us suspended." He said calmly.
Adam looked at Dean. "Dude, I don't really want details, but what the hell happened in there? He did a total three sixty..."
"How's he doing?" Dean asked as he was putting his things away.
"Fuck you! You're just pissed because I fucked Winchester!" He yelled.
There were narrow stairs, so he shrugged and climbed up. He found himself in a small room with a bed and dresser. The lights worked. The bed seemed newer, maybe Dean had spent some time out here. Maybe with other people, other people Dean had fucked. Cas shook his head; those days were gone now. A grin grew on Cas’ face.
"Haven't decided yet. I don't want to show them up. There are other ways I can make a statement, anyway."
The drugs he had taken at school that day wore off hours ago and he was starting to come down, which sucked by itself. Never mind the fact that he would go through withdrawals sometime in the next couple of days. He wished he could call Dean. He had never seen Dean so mad and he felt like a dick. He groaned and covered his face with the pillow. He would apologize the first chance he got. Dean wouldn't have gotten so pissed if he didn't care about Cas' well being. He removed the pillow and rolled over, staring at the radio.
All of the sudden, another vehicle came out of the tree line. Cas skidded to a halt and ran in a different direction. A few sots rang out and he could hear Dean yelling, but couldn't make out what he was saying over the roar of the Humvee. Another shot rang out and Cas felt a white hot pain shoot up his leg. He instantly dropped to the ground. The Humvee stopped and out ran four Betas. Three of them began shooting at Dean. Cas barely made out Dean's silhouette fall to the ground. Cas started yelling and fighting with everything he had as the dragged him to the vehicle and threw him in back before everything went black.
He hit Adam in the face, hearing Castiel cough and gasp for air.
"Dean..."
"You guys should totally play a few songs!" Meg said. "Everyone wants to hear you."
"I have no record of that. the couple you were with never signed any papers to take you home and foster you."
Dean stirred a little, slowly waking up. "You guys talk too much." He said, still half asleep. His eyes shot open and he sat up quickly. Electric blue eyes were looking back at him. "You're really slow on the uptake, aren't you?" Cas smiled.
The horse snorted and lipped at Cas. Cas found some treats and gave him a couple. "I'll figure it out. Hopefully." He looked to the house. All the lights were off. He turned back to RJ.
Wouldn’t you say-oh, a-oh, a-oh
Ten years later...
"Can you just make sure Dean doesn't do anything stupid when I'm gone?"
The way he whispered it sent a shiver down his spine. He pushed the cards off the bed, hearing them fall to the floor, then put a hand on Cas' hip and slowly pushed him down. Cas tugged down Dean's pajama pants, boxers going down for the ride. Dean got the clothing the rest of the way off and tossed them aside, then pulled off Cas' pajama pants. He couldn't help but smile a little when he noticed Cas was already starting to get wet.
"I live thirty minutes away in Lawrence. I've been there pretty much this whole time."
His notification tone rang out.
"But before that I stalked you and after that we had sex on a cliff. So technically I wasn't lying."
Cas was doing another shot when he heard the Nine Inch Nails kick on. He did yet another shot when the lyrics came on.
"Whatever you say Neanderthal."
"Hey, you're back." Naomi rounded the corner. She smiled at the sight before her. "I take it someone had a good time."
"Of course she did. So uh, what's up?"
"Cas, just... come sit... sit down on the couch and..."
"Nice shirt faggot." Benny the linebacker said, shoulder checking him as he passed. Cas dropped his food as a result.
A flash went off in his face. He blinked and looked up. "Uh...excuse you."
He checked for a pulse. It was alarmingly faint.
"Well? Have a good time?" Sam asked, that grin on his face. Dean eyed him.
" Umm ya! Of course you dork."
"Because I always get lunch duty." Benny laughed.
Cas sulked through his next few classes. He couldn't believe that after all he and Dean had been through he couldn't even make a stupid music video with him. He tapped his pencil on his desk and watched the clock tick down to final bell.
Dean narrowed his eyes at his brother as he closed the door behind him.
"Watch it or I'll tie you down again."
An hour later, right on schedule, a light blue Malibu slowly made its way up the gravel driveway. Cas heard a horn honk from his room. “Let the games begin,” he said to himself. He picked himself up and made his way to the front door, sighing as he opened it and stepped out onto the porch. A tall, slender woman with long dark hair flounced out of the car with her arms open.
"I wanted to put that on there but I wanted more songs that people haven't heard."
"Asshat."
"Why? Why is this such a big deal to you? You could be in heaven right now Dean!"
"A ride. Ride as in..." Charlie raised an eyebrow.
"Hey mom. You on your way?"
“My thigh. It hurts. I don't know if it was Crowley or an accident. I haven't looked at it yet.”
They walked to the kitchen and sat at the table. Sam slid him a plate of eggs and bacon and toast. "Thank you Sam. I appreciate you looking out for me this whole time. I'm sure Dean does too."
"I know, I know."
again. And for the first time in what felt like years...he smiled.
“Phew. They bought it.” She tossed the pink book back on the bed and opened the drawer to her nightstand, opening the trick bottom that she made in it. In it was another pink book.
"Yeah?"
Cas heard a gun hit the cement floor.
He felt Dean kiss the top of his head. "I love you too." Then continued humming.
"Yeah well, take your own advice and face the music when it's dire."
Dean dramatically clutched his chest. "Oh the horror!"
"What's he gonna do with a car like that in Dallas and being a lawyer?"
"You have no reason to be afraid of what I might or might not think. Ever." Cas took the fork out of Dean's hand and intertwined their fingers. "You can trust me."
Cas looked up from his book. “But you just showered…”
He thrust the bag into the Alpha's hands, grabbed one of his arms, and lead him to the back exit. Opening the door, he looked both ways before grabbing the Alpha once again and they took off in a dead sprint. Running between the little run down duplexes. The Alpha smelled a Beta. He immediately grabbed the scrawny Omega and pulled him back just as the Beta came into view, weapon drawn.
"Look, Ellen is on her way. She'll stay up here and you can go get some sleep."
“You heard the man. Let's go.” Dean and Cas got into the Impala, the rest in the truck, and they all headed back to the ranch.
Charlie smiled smugly. "Had to break the ice somehow." Cas stuck his tongue out at her. He turned back to Dean.
“No, I meant what are you doing here and how did you know where I live?”
The Alphas nodded and went to move into position. Dean grabbed a few magazines for each weapon and got down on one knee, aiming at the tree line. The Betas slowly trickled out, weapons drawn.
He laughed as Cas let out a long, low, wrecked moan when he bit at the area between his shoulder blades. He leaned forward.
The curtain rose and the song changed. The video continued to play. The rest of the band was there but Cas wasn't.
Cas looked down at his plate, pushing the bacon almost off the plate with his index finger. He pushed the plate away and sat back in his chair. "I just...don't want you to leave is all." He looked up at him.
"Really?"
When they finished, Dean smiled at him and stood up, extending his hand to Cas. "I have an idea." Cas tilted his head and looked at Dean, taking his hand. "Lead the way." He smiled.
"More like out of your galaxy! Golden boy has only been with one guy that I know of, and the kid was a track star."
Month four. Cas put his key in the the door and pushed. The house was quiet, which was weird, because it was a Saturday and the guys were normally home. He headed to his room and opened the door. "Holy fuck! When did you... how... fuck!"
Dean kept Cas pinned to the bed and leaned down, biting at one nipple and then the other, flicking the second one with his tongue as he pulled back.
"Alpha camp. A bunch of Alphas were hiding at an old camp near Junction City, least they were before I was captured."
Charlie shook her head. “Get in here, asshat.” She pulled him into a hug, which he held a little longer than normal.
Zachariah was stunned silent, clearly caught off guard. "Excuse me?"
"No, Mr Winchester I don't see that he's been here today. I'm sorry."
In no time, Cas had bottomed out  and began to push and pull slowly until Dean got used to it. Once Dean started to move with Cas, Cas sped up his pace. He angled his hips, searching for that cluster of nerves deep inside. He smiled when Dean cried out, knowing he had found it. He hit it a few more times when he felt himself nearing the edge. Dean wanted to grab Cas and flip him over, but the reins kept his hands out of the way. He wrapped his legs around Cas and pulled him in. Dean felt his eyes roll back in his head as Cas hit his prostate again.
They stayed there for a few minutes in silence as they recovered from the first time either of them had felt release in two months.Cas grabbed some wet wipes and handed one to Dean. Dean looked at him. "I have a habit of spilling shit when I get excited."
"Cas..." Dean called out, his voice shaky. Cas turned around.
Morning came quickly. Cas woke up to sunlight streaming in through his bedroom window. He blinked his eyes. An arm was draped across him. Dean's arm. Cas rolled over so he could see his lover's face.Dean's face was smashed into the pillow and his lips were pushed up.
"Like I said, I'm just being selfish."
"I don't like dogs, but I guess I'll have to deal."
Dean woke up to the most amazing thing that he possibly could. Cas was sleeping next to him. His hair was in different directions and he was snoring lightly, laying on his back. The blankets were just high enough to show his hips. Dean propped himself up on his elbow and just watched Cas sleep before kissing his forehead lightly. Cas stirred and slowly opened those breathtaking electric blue eyes, smiling sleepily. "Mornin." He said, voice thick with sleep.
“When I come back, I'm gonna want a rematch.”
"What was that for?"
Everyone left the studio, giving the two a few minutes alone. Cas let his hands drop to his side. "It's just..." He sighed, looking away. "It's like my world came crashing down in one second." He sighed again and closed his eyes for a second then continued. "It was the worst I felt in awhile and I came dangerously close to relapsing a few times because I was just at a loss of what to do."
The sun was about to set when he got to the park. He heard the low rumble of a muscle car and turned around. It was Dean.
"I will honor and cherish you..."
Cas picked up his books and walked off to class.
"Neither did I," Dean whispered.
A tear found it's way out of Cas' eyes. He cursed himself internally for showing this side of himself. Dean just wiped the tears with his thumbs and kissed Cas again.
"Of course you did..." He muttered.
Ten seconds left in the fourth and the game was tied. There was no way in hell he was about to let this game go into overtime. There was only one problem, number twenty-three. The whole second half he was on Dean like white on rice, making it very difficult for Dean to make a play let alone get rid of the damn ball.
"I love you, too."
"Oh," Dean licked his lips and nodded. "You were in a hurry. For what, exactly?"
Dean's eyes fell to Adam. Cas didn't look.
"Okay, so they'll come get you guys when it's time. It's gonna be amazing!"Josh and the band started to head out. Suddenly, Josh turned to Dean. "They have a special place for you and Charlie to watch so you can see him onstage, because I'm sure you don't want to miss it. This is magic!"
Again Dean nodded. Cas pulled out and got Dean to his feet then sat down. He held his cock up with one hand and pulled Dean down with the other. Then he held Dean up and slammed into his prostate hard and fast. Dean's head fell back.
“Michael.”
Dean smiled. "It's never a dull moment with you."
Cas exhaled. "I hope so."
Mary and Naomi walked together and found their seats. Then Charlie and Sam, who took their places near the officiant. The music changed to Elvis' "I Can't Help Falling in Love With You." Dean waited a few bars before slowly stepping out.
“Shut up Alec.”
"And, why is it so hard for you, exactly? It's not like you ever..." Cas stopped and sighed. "Never mind. Just...never mind. You don't want me here anyway." He shook his head and turned to leave.
She looked at him for a second. “Cas, come here will ya?”
"Nah, it's okay Cas. I want to. Really."
At Meg's house, Cas told her everything that happened. How did this happen? He should have paid attention to who he was about to fuck. He could have fucked anyone, anyone except Dean Winchester. Now the whole school will know.
If I can’t have you
"Because I wasn't happy there. I never belonged."
"Yes, yes Castiel, we're all impressed by your music video. Now sit down. You're back in school." Cas jumped off the chair and sat in it, still smiling. Crowley turned around. "I Expect big things from you this semester."
“Don't play dumb I can smell him all over you!”
"Cas..."
After they evaluated him, they pretty much told him that detox for him was going to suck. A lot. Once he hit the withdraw stage it was probably going to suck even more, and quite possibly hurt. They took his phone and searched him and his bag to make sure he wasn't hiding anything and showed him to his room. He fell back on to the bed as and orderly named Gadreel unpacked his things. "Sounds like your in for a rough time." He said. Cas looked at the ceiling. "Yeah, and not the kind of rough I like either." Gadreel laughed.
Naomi and Mary continued to take candid pictures of the friends, especially when they weren't looking. Charlie managed to record Cas and Dean while they were making out behind some trees. Cas flipped her off and Dean winked at the camera, moving in between Charlie and Cas so she couldn't see anything. They all goofed around a little longer. After a while, the people started to clear out and head home.
"Well, sometimes your sarcasm gets on my nerves but other than that, nothing."
Oh yeah...all of it. Well, that explains it. Overdose.
Everyone was singing "Shake Tramp" with the window down as they pulled up. Cas was hanging out the window. "Try a little more try a little more!" Josh jumped on top of a car and raised his arms. "I slap you like a bitch and you take it like a whore!" He sang along with Cas. Everyone around got into the song until Cas was on the car with Josh and they were both jumping up and down on the car singing.
"I feel like I was hit by a mack truck. Ten times. And I wasn't even drinking."
"Wow, I'm sorry Charlie."
He pulled out a small wrapped box and put in his pants pocket. With a deep breath, he headed to the auditorium. Cas was standing on the stage. "Knew I'd find you in here." Cas turned to see Dean walking up to the stage. He climbed up.
Cas opened his eyes and looked into green orbs, nearly black from the pupils being dilated. "Yeah?"
Cas turned to the sound booth where the band had been running through the music. "Think we can lay one down?" They all nodded. Cas clapped his hands. "Let's get to it, then."
They only took small breaks, pushing on as much as they could. Dean was actually impressed with Castiel who didn't speak or complain.
"Great."
“The Drive?”
"Very official little bro."
Eleven Years Ago
"Not until you move on Cas. Everyone else has started to. Why can't you?"
"Since when do we ever just lay low and stay quiet. I mean really. This isn't our style, and it certainly isn't yours."
Dean put his hands on Cas' waist and pulled him closer. "If I know you, and I do pretty damn well, I know you'll do great. And if RJ is half the horse River is, he'll showboat win or lose." Dean smiled. Cas laughed. "Yeah, you're right." Cas tipped his head up and kissed Dean. As he did, he caught something out of the corner of his eye. He turned to see what it was. It was Gabriel walking toward them, and next to him was...
“Okay, fine. But don’t tell anyone. Especially Dean.”
December 8th 1941
"Woops. Gotta go!"
"Should I get you a pill box with the days of the week on it so you don't get confused?"
"He didn't want that to be the title because it gave the ending away."
"Hey! Is this gonna be a let's pick on Charlie trip? I didn't sign up for that!"
“Dean...Dean! Can you hear me?”
Dean was up before the sun. He walked over to where his hanging clothes were and grabbed an Army pullover, then got in his dresser and pulled out a t-shirt, boxers, and basketball shorts. Quietly, he made his way to the bathroom to get dressed, deciding on showering after his run.
"Yeah."
"Any word?" Ellen asked.
“We'll be out of your hair soon. We'll make celebratory food tomorrow.”
"So. You said noisy. Got somewhere specific in mind?"
“Can I help you?” Cas smiled as he gave Dean a sideways glance. Dean leaned in and whispered in the other man's ear. “Nope. Well, at least not right now. But I'm sure I can think of something later.”
"Yeah, yeah, you're so fashionably late. We get it. So.... how was your night? Get any sleep?" Meg had propped her head in her hands and was eyeing Cas and Dean with a shit eating grin on her face. Cas returned her look. "We slept just fine, thank you." Meg picked up her menu. "Uh-huh sure ya did. So what's good here? Char, what are you thinking..."
“Don't worry about me.”
"God yes! Please! You feel so good inside me!"
“Absolutely not.”
"There's more than that going on. They've been drugging him for years Charlie."
“Dean, it's okay, let go.”
Someone helped him up and sat him on a chair. He leaned forward, putting his arms on his legs. "Have you ever had a panic attack before?" a doctor asked. Dean shook his head. "We may have to run some tests..."
Dean turned around and looked at Cas, walking backwards. He winked and smiled, then turned and kept walking. Adam punched Cas in the arm. "Welcome back." Cas laughed. "Thanks." They walked inside and everyone sat in the living room.
"Uh..."
Dean punched Sam in the arm. "No cake. Beer. I barely know him. We're just... hanging out tonight."
"Like what, slut? Because it ain't uploading whatever you have on that phone."
"Will do. See ya Mrs Winchester."
To-o-o-o-o-oy soldiers
Cas rubbed his head. “Ow...what was that for?”
That when I get back, you won't believe
"What you normally do. Sing it out."
Learn to love me
A few minutes later, he pulled in front of his uncle's shop. "Why are we at an auto shop?" Dean just smiled and got out. He walked around and opened Cas' door the grabbed his crutches and handed them to him. "Follow me." He led the way around the back. He unlocked the door and they went inside. Cas noticed the shop was empty except for whatever was under a blue tarp in the middle of the garage. Dean walked over to it. Cas, however, stayed put. Dean pulled the tarp off to reveal Cas' motorcycle. Cas looked at him and smiled. "No way. You fixed it?" He moved closer.
"Cas, just don't. Not right now."
"Your brother was injured. Badly. His platoon was on a mission to help another unit that had been pinned down by the Germans. They threw a grenade and it landed feet away from most of his unit. Dean jumped on top of the grenade and saved everyone." Cas went numb. Sam leaned against the door for support. Jess started crying. "Is he...is he dead?" Sam asked.
“Hey, ready for dinner?” He smiled at Cas, putting his arm around the Omega.
"Don't call me Cas. I left that kid in Texas."
"What do you mean?"
"Drop what? Having sex with you? Gladly."
"But I wanted to. Open it already!"
"Little bro. You're selling? How romantic."
"Well, they ran a shit ton of tests after you left and everything was normal, which is actually an insult in my book because I am anything but normal."
"I'm gonna go find some booze." Meg said over the loud, terrible rap music thudding through the sound system in the living room.
Cas could see the finish line. He was so close. Crowley and Little Demon were coming up behind him. His thigh was on fire. Cas leaned forward and gave RJ some length on his reins, heeling him one more time. As they crossed the finish line, Little Demon ran straight into RJ, causing RJ to stumble and Cas to almost fall off. The crowd gasped. Cas regained his balance and waved a hand in the air to signal that he was okay. As the crowd applauded, the announcer came over the loudspeaker.
He opened his eyes and played on cue. Then continued singing.
Help me... the only thing that works for me... help me get away from myself....
Cas was sitting in the living room in silence smoking a cigarette. Sam, Jess, Bobby, and Ellen were sitting in the kitchen. Cas heard the sound of breaks and looked out the window. The same car. Oh God. They came to tell them Dean's dead. But instead of coming to the door, the over went around the other side of the car. He put a pair of walking crutches on top of the car. Someone emerged from the car. "Guys?" He got up and walked to the window. The rest joined him. The two shared a handshake and a salute before the officer got back in the car. The second man turned and Cas stopped breathing. "Oh my God!" He ran to the door and threw it open. "Dean!" He ran down the driveway and tacked Dean to the grass. "Ow! Jesus! Watch it babe." The rest stood there, stunned. "I knew you were alive!" He wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. Dean hugged him tightly, eyes squeezed shut. "I thought..." Cas' voice cracked. He fought back tears. Dean laser his fingers through Cas' hair. "Shh...it's okay. I'm here. I'm alright. I promised you didn't I?" They laid there for a moment. "Cas, you should probably get off me now. Still a little busted up." Cas jumped up then helped Dean up. "Sorry." He said picking up Dean's bags. Dean kissed him. "Don't be." He slowly made his way to the house. Everyone gathered around him, all crying with joy. Dean heard a car pull up and turned around. John walked up the driveway and stopped at the sight of his son. Dean slowly made is way to him. John met him in the middle. Tears streaming down his face, he hugged Dean. "I'm sorry. When they said that you...I thought...and the last thing I said..." Dean hugged him with one arm. "It's okay dad." He said through his tears. He wasn't mad at him anymore. He had told himself if he made it home, he would make things right with him. "It's okay, I forgive you." He felt his dad's body shake as he cried into Dean's shoulder. Dean tightened his arm around him a little. John pulled away first. "Let's get you inside huh?"
The next morning Dean was sitting on the couch watching the news. Cas was making breakfast. They both knew it was a matter of time before Dean was shipped off. The loud knock on the door confirmed it. Dean looked at Cas and got up. Opening the door to see a man in uniform. Cas' heart dropped. "Private First Class Winchester. Your orders. You are to report in at o500." He handed Dean a thick envelope. Dean took it. Even though Dean was out of uniform, he saluted. "Understood sir." He closed the door. Cas was frozen in his place. Dean opened the envelope and read it. He dropped the contents after reading them and looked up at Cas. "I have to be there first thing in the morning. They want me to leave tonight." Cas walked around the counter over to Dean.
ENJOY!
“Shit!”
He played the keyboard and sang.
"It's definitely my best work." He smiled. He turned to Cas. "I think I found my muse." He gently tugged on Cas shirt, pulling him closer. He brushed his lips over Cas'. Cas smiled.
He dried off and dressed then walked out to see Cas grabbing his things. He looked up at Dean. "I'm sorry. I should have knocked. I should have known that you might be in the shower." Dean laughed at the look on Cas' face. "Hey, we're both to blame. I should have locked the door." Cas straightened. "You're not mad?" Dean shook his head, smiling. "With the look on your face? How could I be?" He started laughing again. Cas tilted his head to the side. "What look?" Dean calmed his laughing. "You looked like a lost deer. But I can imagine I had the same look." He scratched his head. "I think I should go."
Dean looked up. “Still think I'll run away screaming?”
Cas looked at what was left of the burger. "I am forever grateful that Biggerson's is open twentyfour hours."
"There was nothing you could have done to change the outcome. From what I've been told, the barn was completely engulfed in flames by the time you got there. You would have only hurt yourself, babe."
Dean looked at him. "You didn't make anything worse."
"And no going-"
“I'm sorry...”
"Hey, you're the one who brought it out of him in the shower apparently."  Cas walked back to the edge of the porch and set his beer down. He pushed of the porch with his feet and did a back flip in the air, landing on his feet. He straightened with a smile. "Boom bitches. That's right. I still got it." Cas put on his aviators.
"Oh, no you don't..." Dean leapt onto Pandora and heeled her into action, taking off after Cas.
Cas looked up at Dean. He shrugged. "Well, you're not wrong..."
"Blow me red."
“Scent?”
"You and me against Charlie and Meg."
“I'm standing right here...you could have asked.”
"You never asked." She looked at Cas. "I was in foster care too. I got lucky. The family adopted me. Right after I met Cas. My parents died in a car accident when I was eight. Hit by a drunk driver. They were on their way to pick me up from a slumber party."
“Good call.” Cas slowly pulled the beads out, rinsing them off before turning the shower off. He pulled the curtain open and shook the water out of his hair. Dean ran a towel through his and dried quickly, handing it to Cas he bent down and picked up the box. Cas ran the towel over himself quickly and followed Dean. As soon as Dean opened his bedroom door, Cas grabbed the box and set it on the nearest waist level place, grabbed Dean's wrists and pulled him into a kiss. “Cas” Dean breathed between kisses.
"But they guys are excited and you have definitely earned a night off."
After his bath, Cas helped him get into his night clothes. He wheeled himself across the hall to the bedroom. Cas started to help him into bed. "I can do it." Dean looked at him. Cas nodded, kissing his forehead. Dean pushed himself up and on to the bed. He swung his legs over and got under the blanket. Cas walked around to the other side and laid next to him. Dean turned over on his side, facing Cas. They looked at each other. "I'm sorry." Dean said quietly. Cas propped himself up on his elbow. "For what?"
************
"Now, I didn't write song, and I'm not a poet, but I do like to tell it how it is. And it's simple. I love you. And I think I realized it a long time ago, before I even knew what I was feeling. I couldn't put a word to it, but I knew that if I went without seeing you or hearing your voice I wasn't whole. And that hasn't changed. I want your face to be the last thing I see at night and the first thing I see in the morning. Your arms are home to me. And I never want to be without you again."
"What happened to you?" Dean asked.
Cas' smile grew. "You want me to make you come?"
Is it the look in your eyes?
"You're gonna be late Winchester, ditch the fag and let's go!"
You say you'll never date me
Cas smiled. "There's a reason I always eat first. More energy."
Dean looked at him. "Run you off? What are you talking about?" Cas took another drink of his coffee. "He's most of the reason why I left. Hell he pretty much had me escorted to the damn plane just to make sure I got on it. He knew Dean, and he didn't like it. He wanted me away from you."
Dean started making out with Cas again. He had his hands moving down to the zipper on Cas' jeans when the phone rang again. Dean pulled away.
Cas strapped on his guitar. Finally, he was in his element.
Dean nodded.  "I tried Cas, I really did. I just didn't have enough fight left in me I guess. I'm sorry you had to see me go out like that. I'm sorry for all of it, but I don't want to see you die Cas. Please. You have to let me go."
You could be my ever after, after all
B Team by Marianas Trench
Cas paused. He noticed spots on the page that looked like...dry tears. Dean cried while he wrote this. He imagined Dean biting his lip, trying not to cry. He remembered that day when Dean went to the doctor. It was the day before Sam's wedding; And he had written this just few days ago. Meaning he might have only had a few weeks or days left. He made himself finish the letter.
"Cas..."
"Call the band. I'm gonna keep looking. Gonna check the hospital. I'll call you."
"You could emancipate yourself."
"I'd take you to all the Marianas Trench concerts."
He opened the door to see Alec packing.
"Dean...if you're still here, you can go now."
"I said go away!"
They finished eating and Dean offered to clean up. "You've done enough already honey. You just relax." Mary said patting her eldest son's shoulder. Dean grabbed he and Cas' things and took them to his room. He let himself fall on his bed, exhausted from the drive. There was a knock. "Yeah?" His door opened with a screech. "Hey." Sam stepped inside and closed the door. "I need some advice." Dean propped himself up on his elbows. "Shoot." Sam grabbed the desk chair and sat down. "If you wanted to, you know, ask the question, how would you do it?" Dean sat up. "Are we talking about a proposal here Sammy?" Sam nodded. "Hell if I know."
"Sure thing." She smiled.
"Dean. Just... what? What happened?"
Cas took a deep, calming breath. He looked up at his brother.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
that was over a metallic blue button up that matched his eyes.
"I won't tell if you don't." Hannah smiled.
Cas tilted his head back. "God Dean.....So good!" Digging his blunt nails into the bedding, biting his lips as even more moans filled the room as Dean continued to push all the right buttons. Dean had him right were he wanted him. Cas knew he wasn't going to let him off that easy, and he didn't. He stopped, knowing Cas was so close to the edge. He leaned over and brushed his lips down Cas' jaw to his neck. Waiting, pulling Cas from the edge. Cas didn't know whether to curs or praise Dean for this action. They were still for only seconds, but to Cas it felt like hours. Then, mercifully, Dean continued. Pulling out almost all the way and slowly pushing back in until his dick hit the spot just hard enough. Dean pulled out just enough so he wasn't touching the bundle of nerves, then pushed in. He kept repeating this until Cas was a mess underneath him. Eyes closed, biting his lip, arching his back, and moaning Dean's name. Cas begged for release, but at the same time he didn't want it to end. He just wanted to be there, on the bed with Dean, having Dean make love to him forever.
She laughed. “Sure did. Come on.”
"Take it Cas!" Josh said. Cas sang:
Sorry for the wait! I ended up getting blocked on this chapter! By the way...this is actually not exactly what I had planned but hey. Hope you like it!
"Okay, and we're leaving."
You say your mom will hate me
And never face the music when it's dire
"Aw..."
Both boys were now laying down on the dusty floor, staring at the wooden ceiling. Dean was fully clothed, Cas left his shirt off.
Castiel spat the words out without thinking. "Third door to the left, hold the handle down when you flush it, and don't flush when someone is in the shower." Dean looked at him, puzzled. "Ummm, yeah... there's only... a few people who know that..."
"THEY'RE OFF!"
“I love you too Dean.”
Castiel sighed. "I rambled on and on about music pretty much the whole time. He just sat there...not saying a word. He kept staring at me so I just kept talking..."
"Jesus! Finally! I've only been blowing up your phone for twenty minutes!"
"Apple pie?! You got me a pie!"
"Go home Dean. I'm fine."
"God, I miss you."
“Hey there, asshats!” Adam jumped out of the truck and walked up to Cas. “Wondered where y’all had got to!”
"You'll be great."
Dr Mills looked at Cas and smiled. "You're husband's a good man, Castiel. You should listen to him."
Naomi turned a little in her seat, keeping her eyes on the road. “Yes, sweetie?”
“Son of a bitch!”
"The way I was looking at you. He said it was the way Gabe looks at girls."
The others got off stage when everyone started clapping. Cas played something different on the keyboard and looked up. "Well, as long as I'm up here, not trying to take advantage or anything. There's a song that I took out of the last album. I wrote it after there was a little uh, miscommunication with the man who's sadly, stuck with me for the rest of his life. Not to beat a dead horse...but, this has kinda been stuck in my head for like two years. This song is called So Soon."
"Cas, you have to tell someone!"
"Then put a gag on blue sky over there."
Cas smiled. “Good to know. I just…” He stopped and stared ahead of them. Charlie looked around.
"Dad."
After breakfast, he grabbed some clothes and walked into the bathroom to take a shower. He turned on the water and stepped in, closing the shower curtain. He let the hot water run over him for a minute. He thought back to breakfast. How Cas looked playing with his cup of coffee. His messy hair from sleep. His eyes...God those eyes. He shook his head to get the thought from his mind. After he was clean he turned the water off and grabbed the towel. Putting it over his face as he opened the curtain. As soon as he did, the door opened. Cas was standing there. He looked at Dean. "Sorry I didn't know..." He trailed off and closed the door. Great. A complete stranger had just seen him naked. Not awkward at all.
November 1941
Okay, you wanted more? Here's more! I guess my one shot just became a multi chapter short fic. ENJOY!
"Dammit." He punched the seat again. Castiel had no choice but to get out now because Dean had spotted him and was making his way to the car. He reluctantly opened the door and stepped out of the car.
"Holy crap! Dean!"
Positioning his tip, he pushed in until he bottomed out. The boy under him tensed but moaned. Cas pulled out slightly and rammed back in, drilling into the kid til they both came.
Within seconds, they were running around the school yard throwing snowballs at each other. They called a truce and started building a snowman, then wrote their names in the snow.
"Fine, but I'm not staying."
Dean nodded. “What if I don't feel pressured though?”
Castiel nodded slightly. Dean put his arms around the Omega and pulled him almost on top of him. Castiel's sent hit him instantly, like cinnamon and spring rain. It was the most calming sent he had ever smelled. Instinctively, he reached his hand up and started running his fingers through Castiel's hair. The Omega practically melted, curling himself up on Dean's lap and putting his head against Dean's chest. He smiled slightly as Castiel nuzzled his neck.
Alfie turned to the rest of his band and nodded for them to start, and then turned back to the mic. The guitar player kicked it off.
“Yeah, cause I can go anywhere naked, wet, and with your mom here.” He teased. Dean shook his head and walked to the door. Cas watched him as he did. “You have a nice ass Winchester.” Dean turned his head, smiled, and winked at him. He turned to the door and opened it, looking left and right before dashing out of sight. “Hate to see him leave, but love to watch him go.” Cas said to himself. A minute later Dean was back, holding a shoe box. He closed the door and set the box down right out side the shower. Cas peered over the top to see that he was not the only freak in school. Cas bent over and picked up a dildo. “Standard Winchester. What else do you have?” “Shh! Just-” He grabbed the dildo and put it back in the box. Cas looked in the box again, seeing something that looked like a flashlight. He picked it up. “Is this what I think it is?” He looked at Dean. Dean looked at him. “Yes Cas, it's called a fleshlight.” Cas looked at the toy, thoroughly inspecting it. He looked back at Dean. “Got any whips or handcuffs?” He smiled, Dean rolled his eyes and shook his head. “Not that much of a freak are we? You'll learn” Dean stepped back in the shower, hiding something behind his back. Cas just waited patiently. Dean closed the curtain with one hand then looked at Cas. “I do have this though.” To his surprise, Dean pulled out Anal beads. Cas raised his eyebrows. “How did you get all of this?” Dean shrugged.
Cas just stood there for a second, a look of pure devastation on his face. He just walked away without saying a word. "Cas!" Dean ran after him, but by time he got out of the ally, Cas was gone.
"This isn't a sickness or some stupid lifestyle. It's not a choice. The only choice I have is who to give my heart and soul to. Just like a straight person. But I'm not straight. I like men. More specifically, I like Cas. From the second I saw him in the diner-"
"You're weird Winchester." He shook his head. "Just don't break my guitar or I'll kick your ass." He pushed off on his bike and started it. He revved it a few times then looked back at Dean. Before he could say his next thought, Dean kissed him. Cas' eyes widened. It was a quick kiss, he didn't have time to kiss Dean back. Cas calmed himself and smiled at him. "Watch it Winchester. I don't think you can handle me."Dean smiled. "Have you ever actually been with a boy Dean? Physically?"
Cas turned and looked at the two Alphas now staring him down. “Bathroom. Wanna hold it for me?”
"I just talked." He kissed Cas forehead. "Promise." Cas squinted his eyes at Dean. Then he smiled at him. "Alright. Well let's get going. I'm tired. You're tired. RJ's tired."
"Well, duh. I came up with it."Cas smiled. "I got it! You're helping. Come to my lair. We have work to do."
"Because apparently she's still pissed that I talked you into running away when we were ten."
Don't you look so shocked
"Somebody's still butt hurt."
After school, they threw him in the dumpster.
Dean swallowed hard. “Hey, Anna… it’s Dean… Yeah, it’s been a long time. Listen I was wondering if you… if you were free tonight?.....Awesome, yeah, uh, the old spot?... Sounds great. Be there soon.” He hung up and put the phone down on the bed, hesitating for a minute before springing to life and changing his clothes, not that what he was wearing really mattered because in about an hour they’d be on the floor of a cheap hotel room. He walked quietly out to the Impala and drove off.
"No. I really don't think so, Cas."
"Gonna be amazing, that's what. And hey, your band is here." Dean gestured to the left, where the rest of Join The Hunt was waiting.
Dean didn't say anything, he just pulled Cas close and kissed him.
The gate flew open and RJ took off. If someone else were riding, the person would have fallen off. But Cas was made for this, and he'd known it for a long time.
Dean put his hands in the air and turned away from Cas, so that his back was to him. “I don't know. Just...not now. I've barely even wrapped my head around the fact that you're even here okay?"
Cas arched his neck at the sensation and wrapped his legs around Dean’s hips, pulling him slightly closer. Dean took a deep breath and bit his lip again. He pushed himself inside Cas slowly, stopping for a few seconds to allow Cas to get used to the feeling. Cas' eyes fluttered closed and moaned. "Dean..." It was barely a whisper. "I know baby, I know. Just slowing it down a bit."
Dean smiled and opened his menu. He had never been here before. It was a soul mate only restaurant. He looked around. High vaulted ceilings with wooden beams and crown molding outlining the top of the walls. Red and gold paint with matching curtains on the windows. The tables were made of Mahogany, the chairs and booths Cherry.
And I've been broken but I'm better every day
Cas jumped up and turned around. “Yeah?”
“Cas, you okay?”
Hello awesome people! Just a quick thanks for reading, commenting, and giving this kudos! Love ya!
Better than, better than, better than
Cas sighed and ended the call, promptly putting his face back into the pile of papers in front of him.
Now stand back up and be a man about it
When they got to the house, Cas' phone rang as soon as he walked through the door. He put it on speaker.
"Well smack my grandma and kiss me sideways. Is that Cas Novak standing in front of me?" Castiel rolled his eyes. "Nice to see you, Benny."
"It happens. It will be weird not being in school. Well, for you."
"How did you-?"
Cas put his hand on Dean's. "Well, it's all null and void now because I'm here. And I'm not hiding this from them anymore."
"No, that's not why. You know you can tell me Cas."
"What about Ellen?"
"One female, one male, both appear to be in their mid to late fifties..."
"Um... yeah. Yeah I am. I'm also going to go to that race. You should, too. Mom!" Gabriel looked at Naomi, who had been silent the entire time. "Will you be joining me?"
Cas, Sam, and the others followed the two Alphas the rest of the way to the mine. Everyone filed in and sat down just inside. Cas and Sam sat close to the exit, watching as Meg and Benny did a head count, making sure all the Omegas, Betas, and children were present. As the two Alphas were distracted, gunfire imminently caught Cas' attention, looking out into the night. He knew he wouldn't be able to see much.
"Now swing your legs over, like you're sitting on a chair, then just push off." Dean instructed. Cas swung his legs over. Dean tossed the bag aside, ready to catch his friend. Cas didn't jump. "It's not that bad Cas, like flying! I'll catch you, I promise." His friend nodded, csed his eyes, and pushed off. A second later he landed on Dean. They both fell to the ground with a loud thud.
In all the years she had known Cas, she never heard him sing like that before. It was beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. She had to send it to Dean. She realized there were tears running down her face. She dried her eyes with her shirt and quickly send the video to Dean along with a text that said "Look
Dean shook free and sprinted to the barn. He ran inside and looked around. "Mom! Dad!"
"Feels like it is. I guess I'll let you get some sleep too. See ya." He hung up. He set his phone on his nightstand and put his arm over his eyes. At least Cas was safe.
"Yeah, it's pretty crazy. I mean I had no idea that many people even listen to our music. The best artist nomination did come as a shock and I almost crapped my pants and threw up, but I just feel honored that the fans love us that much and we love them for it. I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for them. Even if we don't win anything, we'll still give a kick ass performance."
"Come again?"
Dean walked into his room, sweaty from hours of drills and team building. He tossed his bag on the floor and peeled off his clothing, stepping directly into a hot shower. He faced the front of the shower with his hand on the wall, leaning so that the water ran down his back. He played with his wedding band. He sighed. It had been almost three weeks since Dean had left Cas at their home and right now he could just say screw it all and quit so he could go back and hold Cas. He was almost at the point of not caring of anyone picked him up or not. The semester was over anyway, so what the hell was he doing here?
One love (one love), one love you get
Cas was extremely pale and there were dark circles around his eyes. Dean had never seen him this bad before. It had never been this bad. Not even when they were teenagers. Dean knew there was a chance Cas might relapse, that he could deal with, but an overdose? He really didn't know if it was an accident or not. Right now, he really didn't care.
Cas, Charlie, and Meg were on the stage having a three way light-saber fight. You wouldn't think there would be a such thing as "Advanced Drama" but there it. You just have to audition for it or in very few cases, be switched to it by the teacher. Light from the hallway poured into the dimly lit auditorium. That usually meant Mr. Fergus (He let the students call him Crowley) had entered. He was a short British man with a beard, and he always wore a black suit. Cas, Charlie, and Meg continued with their light-saber fight. "All right you three. Don't kill each other." Cas looked at him and stowed his light-saber. Charlie hit Cas in the shoulder with hers. He brought his back out. "Oh that's it Red! Prepare to meet thy doom!" Charlie ran and jumped off stage. Cas followed her. They ran around the auditorium yelling and laughing like little kids. "All right, calm down Castiel. We have a new arrival." Cas and Charlie stopped and looked at each other. Their faces lit up. It was a rare occasion when someone switched from drama four to advanced.
You can say that I don't know romance
"The cliff. It's nice out there." Cas turned around. "You know, I'm surprised you didn't just rip my head off for riding him like you did when I petted Pandora."
He was upstairs all of fifteen minutes. Whatever that drink was, it hit him fast. Maybe he shouldn't have drank it so fast. It wasn't long until he and another boy stumbled into a dark room, tearing at each others' clothes. He couldn't make out a face, not that he cared since it's been weeks since he's gotten laid.
Cas seemed to relax a bit after his shower. Funny thing was, Dean really didn't mind that Cas had seen him naked. He thought back to the look on Cas' face. Before looking shocked and embarrassed, he looked...for a split second...like he liked what he saw.
Cas again ran his fingers along the keys. “The family I lived with before Rob and Julie taught me how, the only decent thing they did for me.” “Play something.” Dean urged. Cas thought about what to play for a few moments, then began to play “Roads Untraveled” by Linkin Park.
Dean looked up at Cas. "A little rough today. I like it."
"Wait, River. I know that name. Wasn't there a horse named River that raced here years ago?"
"Yeah, but..."
"You don't remember waking up when Charlie and I got there?"
Cas shrugged. "We had a couple of events here, and once I came here with the band just to eat. They treat me well."
He looked back up. Castiel kissed him gently on the lips.
Cas thought for a second. "Starving actually, probably literally too." He smiled.
Adam grabbed Castiel by the shirt and hit him in the face. Dean struggled against Cain, but to no avail. Adam hit Cas again, Cole let him fall to the ground.
But it's not for me,
so...now that we're nearing the end...what predictions do you have for the end and the sequel? Leave a comment!!!
Then he noticed the sound the fireworks made. Like bombs. Every few seconds. He suddenly felt like he was back in Germany. Bombs and grenades exploding around him. He tried to breath. To take deep slow breaths. He closed his eyes and covered his ears. "Dean?" His family looked at him. Cas was on his knees next to him. "Dean? What is it?" He shook his head and pressed his hands tighter over his ears. "Fireworks...bombs...granade. God Cas the grenade!" John scooped him out of his wheelchair. "What are you doing?" Bobby asked. John looked back at him. "He can't be here! The noise! It's making him have a panic attack" They all got up and followed John to his car. He laid Dean down in the back seat. "Just keep your hands over your ears Dean. You'll be home soon." He closed the door. "What do you mean a panic attack?"
Castiel swallowed. "Gabriel, when I said I was never going home, I meant it. And I still mean it."
Adam got one good swing in, landing right above his eye.
Cas got up and looked out the window. "Huh." He looked at Dean. "Better call your mom. Looks like your stuck here til this clears up."
Cas smiled and put his phone back in his pocket. He drained his coffee then it was off to the label.   "You boys have made a little noise in the last few months and I must say, the public loves it. At first we were a little hesitant because of all the other bands in the same category as you including Marianas Trench, but it seems you've let your music do the talking for you." The label owner held up their demo.
"Now that I'll drink to." He smiled, draining the liquid and setting the shot glasses down. The band started up as they finished their shots, leading the set with Aerosmith's Walk This Way. The waitress brought their appetizers to the table and took their order. A bacon cheeseburger for Dean and a double bacon cheese
I never opened up to anyone. So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms. ..
“Sounds fine to me.” Cas leaned in and kissed Dean on the mouth before falling asleep again. Dean wasn't far behind. He pulled Castiel in as close as possible as his own eyes fluttered shut.
Then a picture of them at the age of ten sitting on the swings. Both of them were laughing at a joke Dean had told. Cas looked like he was about to fall of the swing in laughter. Then a video of them walking down the street arm in arm. Dean looked back at the camera, tapped cas' shoulder, whispered something, then both boys took off running.
"Good one! What can I do for you?"
“I am.”
Cas didn't say anything. He just stared out the window.
"How was school?"
The door jerked open. Cas sniffed, smelling nothing. A Beta.
“Dean I thought-”
"This doesn't surprise me one bit." Mary began as they all sat in the living room. Dean sat in between Cas and Sam. John sat in his chair, Mary sat on the arm of his chair. "You two were joined at the hip since you were one." She continued. Dean rolled his eyes. "And she's off." He murmured. Cas snorted a laugh. "You would rarely let Cas out of your site Dean." Dean leaned closer to Cas. "This could take a while." Cas gave him a nudge and smiled. "Oh! That reminds me! I have a photo album of you two!"
"Relapse? At this point, it's highly possible."
Hey awesome people! This chapter is a little longer because there were a few things I wanted to get out this chapter. Including the one of the reasons I added Alec to the story and he'll be a key player later on as well.
Cas looked down then back at Dean, sighing. “I'll change.”
He looked around, everything came back in little flashes. He slowly looked up at Castiel. "What did I do?"
"What are you doing?! I need to go back up there!"
"Yeah, it was nice. Had a few drinks, talked and stuff. Probably gonna do it again."
Cas sighed. "I... I want to. I'm just... nervous... for some reason."
"I am so looking forward to that." Dean pulled Cas in by the waist and kissed him again. "Alright. I have to sit on a plane. And you need to go buy us a new coffee table. Maybe one that's a little sturdier."
"Yup. Doc said no more cigarettes. Dean said no more cigarettes. So..." she smiled at Cas. He rolled his eyes and handed her the pack that was in with his things.
"Why would anything be wrong?"
"Well I do like a little ass." Cas looked at Dean and winked.
Castiel almost blushed. Now he really wished he had kept the sweater on.
“Well, he was the first one that came up with it that's for sure. Word spread quietly through the nation and now there's one in every state, supplied by allies on the outside.”
"No, you don't."
"Bye, Ever After." Dean pulled back, his hand trailing across Cas' hip. He smiled before turning to walk through the gate. Cas fingered the ring on his finger and smiled.
"Saw what? Me scooping shit? That's nothin new."
Three... Cas turned to Dean and grabbed him by the hips.
It was around 2:30 when Dean pulled in front of Cas house. “You going to school tomorrow?” He asked. Cas was looking out the window at his house. “Do you think I'll ever find my mom?” Dean looked at him. “Why would you ask that?” Cas sighed, not taking his eyes off the slightly rundown house with it's chipping grey paint, falling shutters, busted garage door and drafty windows. They house wasn't much better on the inside. Holes in the ceiling, walls and doors. He tried to keep everything clean just in case his caseworker came by. “I can't stand them Dean. I'm invisible until Rob feels the need to hit me or-” He cut himself off. “Or what?” Cas sighed, looking straight ahead and let his head fall back, resting against the seat. “Nothing. Just forget it.” He unbuckled and opened the door. “Cas-” “There's a reason why I told you to let it be.” He got out and closed the door. Dean shut the car off and got out, quickly catching up to Cas, grabbing his wrist and turning him. “What the hell are you talking about?” Cas clenched his jaw and pulled his wrist free, saying noting. He turned again and walked to the front door. He unlocked it and stepped inside; before he could close it, Dean walked in after him.
"I can't give away the who and what, but I will say that there is something in the works."
back home, August 1942
And beg he did.
"Ready Captain!" Ben gave a salute.
Cas looked at his friend. “He has?”
“It's just...dammit, I don't know.” He stood up and paced back and forth.
"Castiel Novak?"
“Because I want you to feel safe.”
Dean rolled over and shut off his alarm. The clock read five thirty. He sat up and ran his hands through his hair and rubbed his face. Finally, he got up and got dressed.
"No. I think it's my turn. I only have you for a little longer."
“Dammit. They're close. Were gonna have to run.”
Sam laughed. "Yeah, go. Have fun. Be safe."
Cas walked over and grabbed his guitar then returned to the mic. "So anywhore, we're about to hit the studio and make a new album."
“Cold?”
"But people will be uncomfortable with it. That doesn't make sense."
"What about Lover Dearest?"
“Eat your food.”
John walked out and stood next to Dean. "Is there a problem here?" He folded his arms over his chest. "It's okay dad, they were just leaving."
"That's the best way to explain it. But right now he thinks he's back in Germany. It happened to me after I came back. The doctors call it Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He needs to go home. To be away from the noise." They all looked at Dean, trembling in the back seat. "Make it stop! Please!" He yelled. John got in the car and started it. Cas jumped in the passenger seat. John looked at him. "We don't have time for you to sit here. If you expect me to run there while Dean is like this, then you can fuck off." John nodded. He tore out on to the road, doing well over the speed limit.
"They almost killed you Dean."
You should know me
"Shhh. Nobody knows I'm here. I've been in stealth mode since I got here."
Cas met Dean's eyes, keeping them locked as he sank his mouth down on Dean's cock again.
"Yeah, I think you might be right..."
"Castiel! You're alive."
Dean woke up and looked around. The room was dark and Cas wasn't in the bed. He scrambled to his feet.
When they got there everyone had a spot saved. Sitting on a blanket. When people saw Dean, they would shake his hand and thank him for serving. He would smile and thank them even though he didn't want to be thanked. There were three other soldiers that left with him after Pearl Harbor. He was the only one who made it back alive. Guys he grew up with. A few people asked why he wasn't in his uniform. He gave excuses but he didn't want to wear it as a reminder of what happened. He looked at all the kids running around with sparklers and smiled. Remembering when that used to be him and Sam. Once it was dark enough the fireworks show began. He looked down at Cas who was sitting next to him. Smiling as his eyes lit up. He had forgotten he brought his camera. Cas bought him a new one. He grabbed it and took pictures. Cas looked at him and smiled. He looked up at the sky as they were being lit up; Wondering if his unit was celebrating too.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean opened the bathroom door. He half expected to find Cas naked, but he was fully clothed, and running gel through his hair. Cas turned to him, then Dean saw what he was wearing. A black leather biker jacket, a white Sex Pistols shirt, and black worn and ripped skinny jeans. "Got a hot date or something?" Dean smiled. Cas washed the gel off his hands then dried them. He closed the gap between them. "Damn right. Now get dressed. Were gonna paint this town tonight Winchester."
Dean nodded in agreement, taking Cas by the hand and leading him through the maze of the compound to the exit.
He put his hand over the omega's mouth so he didn't scream. He waited, listening as the horde of running footsteps in the corridor faded. He realized he had pulled the omega close to him so nobody would see.
Cas shuddered a little. “Dammit, Dean.” Dean laughed in response as he walked back to take his shot.
"I'm very sorry for your loss."
He sat up and grabbed the syringe off the nightstand and looked at it. He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair then took the cap off the needle. "Fuck it." A few minutes later, he put his head back on the pillow, closing his eyes and letting the sensation take him over.
This was not the way I planned it
"'Kay. Might as well come up."
Dean rolled his eyes and kissed Cas slowly. Cas put one hand and Dean's back and the other on the back of his head, deepening the kiss. "I did miss you." Dean whispered when he pulled back.
He put his tip on Dean's hole and pushed in, moaning at the feeling of Dean tensing and relaxingaround him. He pushed in more. "God damn. Is it me or have you gotten tighter?"
"It's Novak you Neanderthal. And I didn't hear you complain til you got caught with my dick in your ass. I'm not getting my ass beat over a mistake you made."
"We're keeping him in the ICU ward for the time being. One of his ribs punctured a lung and he's having trouble breathing on his own. His left arm is broken, and the bike shattered his right leg. His skull was also fractured from the impact. If he didn't have his helmet on, this would be a different story" Dean once again put his arm around Charlie. "He would be dead." He finished the doctor's thought. The doctor nodded.
Cas let out a breath, running his fingers through his naturally messy hair.
"You gonna ask him?"
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
"We need to go."
Cas snorted at Dean. "Well, I'm not really your ex anymore."
"No, I don't have any on me. But I have plenty at home. I'll bring some next time."
"Had to. I was in the hospital for about a month. Charlie didn't let me drive much after I got out. Still didn't stop me. I just started driving the truck until Charlie hid the keys to the truck and the Impala. Everyone took turns babysitting me after that. So I just stayed in here. Only got up to go to the bathroom and take a shower. Didn't eat much. Guess everyone got sick of my shit so they called Sam. He damn near smacked me silly. I knew I was being stupid but I didn't care. You were gone, then Whiskey, then my parents. It felt like it all happened on the same day."
"Well isn't that cute."
It didn't take him long to eat the whole burger. Dean just watched Cas as he ate. "Slow down, it's not going anywhere."
He was on his fifth cigarette when John walked out. Cas, Sam, and Adam stood up. John looked at them. His face emotionless. Cas dropped his cigarette. John bowed his head. "No!" Cas took off running. Sam yelling behind him. He took the stairs. running up them as fast as his legs would allow. When he made it to Dean's room doctor and nurses were just standing there. The machine was off. He looked at Dean, waiting for him to open his eyes, move, something.
Twelve Years Ago
He went in his pocket and dug out three small bags, each a different drug. His head fell back to the wall and he looked away from Dean. "That doesn't answer my question." Cas didn't look at him. He moved his eyes to the floor. "How pissed would you be if I said it was a mix of all three?" Dean looked at him for a moment, at a lose of words. He tightened his grip on Cas' shirt. "Oh, I'll show you how pissed I am." He pulled Cas into the stall and held him against the wall, dropping the needle on the floor and stomping on it, breaking it into pieces. He kept his hold on Cas and picked up the pieces and threw them in the toilet. Then threw the little bags of drugs in their and flushed it with his foot. Dean pulled out his phone. "What are you doing?" Dean looked at him.
"What else do you have?"
The pace horse and rider led Cas and RJ the rest of the way to the start gate, where another man guided them in. It was narrow and RJ was getting rowdy, but so were some of the other horses. Cas looked around. Crowley was four gates down. As the timer ticked down, Cas got into position.
Cas smiled. "Sounds like a plan."
"I... I guess I wasn't ready to talk about it like I knew we would. It's not something you just casually talk about." Dean thought for a moment before a thought hit him. "Wait... if I didn't tell you, then how do you..." Cas looked at the ceiling and took a deep breath.
"From first to last. The long sleeve one."
"Aww, are we on a coffee date?"
"I can't really think of anything. I like everything about you."
Graduation was closing in at an alarming rate. Cas had ordered his class ring (and one for Dean to wear around his neck) as well as his yearbook weeks ago. Everything was handed out during lunch the day of graduation. It seemed the seniors were either extremely happy or extremely sad. The whole day was bittersweet for all of them.
"Hey maybe I can call Meg and we can finally play the game we talked about all those years ago." Cas turned in the seat and looked at her. "You and Meg still going? Damn I'm impressed."
"So... I have stuff for tacos. Tacos it is."
"How long has it been going on?"
“Seriously? Because Dean's sent is all over you.” Alec laughed.
Cas shrugged. "Nah. Been out for almost a month. We've been keeping it quiet. Figured since I almost kicked it, it would be a good idea to take it easy. And now I'm back."
"We won't."
"Definitely."
"You know, one day Dean will just be a childhood memory." Turning to the door. "Keep telling yourself that. You don't know Dean like I do."
"Yeah, well the girls were about to send me in as search and rescue." Dean said. Cas leaned in and planted a deep, slow kiss on Dean's lips. "Yeah, and then neither of us would have watched the movie."
As the song ended, Cas threw his hands in the air.
Songs in the chapter:
Dean went around to the back of the car and began to pull luggage out. Castiel made his way to the same place. As he walked, he caught a glimpse of a black car parked off to the side. Shit.
Cas sighed. "Do you remember that day you jumped Whiskey for the first time?"
"Cas, hey. Stay still."
“Siblings?”
Dean walked in the room, letting the door close behind him. "Cas?"
"Yeah, I discovered I can run pretty damn fast when I want to." He slightly smiled.
"Well, I do have an almost infinite amount of money available, so I really don't mind." Cas spied a black bag among the others in his hand. "What's that?" Dean shrugged. "A surprise." Cas linked his arm in Dean's. "Well I do like surprises."
"What are the rules?"
Cas smiled. "Calm down. Doc said coughing is normal. While you were asleep, doc said there's probably still a little fluid in my lungs. She also said I'm lucky I didn't get pneumonia. I'm probably gonna have to take some kind of steroids on top of whatever meds she gives me for the arrhythmia."
Cas sighed. "When do I get to come see you?" Dean asked. "Later today. We have some preliminary stuff that's pretty boring so I'll have someone come get you guys. I'll call first."
“Hey Chuck.”
April, 1941
Dean got himself settled and looked at Cas, who had a giant, cheesy grin on his face.
Cas' eyes flicked up to Dean, then back to the floor. "About two weeks after I got here, six years ago."
Castiel shot his brother a look as he walked out the door.
Just say I do,
“So they don't use it by accident.”
"Hm?"
"That's not good."
“Do me a favor,” She grabbed his hands, putting one on Dean's shoulder and the other on his shoulder blade. “When I count to three, I need you to push with your left and pull with your right. I gotta set his wrist.”
“Don’t beat yourself up, buddy. You’re here now and that’s what matters to him.”
"I almost didn't. When you came into the bathroom just now I got defensive. Sharing and caring has never been my strongest trait. So, I'm sorry. For being an ass about it."
A red head and a brunette casually walked up to the three.
Cas got up and sat on the bed. His phone vibrated in his pocket. He pulled it out and looked at it. It wasn't a number he recognized, but he was expecting a call from a therapist since he now had to go to mandatory therapy sessions twice a week. He answered.
He took in a shaky breath. “When I knotted with him, I kept apologizing to him over and over. The told him to wiggle his ass so I'd come even more until we were finally free.”
"Gabriel told me you sold your company. Why on earth would you do something like that?"
"Stupid, reckless, and irresponsible. You always have been." She turned her nose up at him. "No, it was stupid and irresponsible of you to take him the way you did. I know you had some idea of what was really going on. Why we always wore long sleeves and refused to leave each other? My parents sure caught on quick when I turned thirteen. I'm sure Cas acted the same way I did when he found out. I think you knew right then what I was to Cas."
(My love)
"Just discovered it huh Charlie?"
Dean leaned over and kissed him. "You'll be kick ass as always." Cas hummed and looked at him. "As long as you're there."
"Dean."
"Boys? What can I do for you?"
“No, the stitches are fine...just...calm down. I can smell your panic and it's not helping.”
There was a knock on her window. She sat up to see Cas outside. She got up and ran to the window. "Cas? What the hell? It's the middle of the night."
one to Dean.
“...slap you like a bitch and take it like a whore…”
"No you didn't."
"I was sleeping. That didn't seem to stop you. Go see your man! He's been pathetic with worry."
“Fuck my life.”
The students cheered and whsitled. The high fived Cas as they left the gym. "I can't wait to see it finished!" Cas turned to the band. "We fucking did it!" The guys high fived and hugged it out. "I'll have this done in no time. I'll call ya when it's ready." Charlie packed up and headed out.
“Where the hell have you been anyway Dean?” The one named Sam asked.
"There you two are! We've been calling for an hour!" Charlie said, walking into the barn with the rest of the gang on her heels. "Where the hell were you?"
"It's gonna be great."
Mary was on the verge of tears. "Come on mom, don't cry. I'll be back for spring break." He wrapped her in a hug and kissed her forehead before letting go. She wiped the tears from her eyes and smiled. He gave a quick hug to John and Sam. "Be careful on the road son." John told him as he walked around to the driver side. "Always." He smiled opening the door. "Let us know when you get there." Mary added. "I will." Dean responded before getting in and closing the door. In the side mirror, Dean had seen John put his arm around Mary.
Dean stared at Cas. Finally, he pushed his plate away and turned in his chair to face Cas.
"Yeah, no. Barking up the wrong dick honey. Somebody get that bitch a dildo! Hold on..." Cas jumped off stage. "Who said that?" A young woman raised her hand. Cas grabbed her and took her on stage. He stood her in front of Josh. "Josh, meet fuck me lady. Fuck me lady, meet Josh. Have fun." The crowd was roaring with laughter.
Castiel rolled his eyes as he grabbed the hoodie. "I'll be back later."
"Come on, he was scared."
Dean put the Impala in gear and headed home. He tried to sleep, but he couldn't. Not when Cas was in a situation like that.
He killed the engine and walked the bike by the Impala. After putting it on the kickstand, he got off and walked up to the door, taking off his helmet before knocking. The door opened. "You don't have to knock you know."
