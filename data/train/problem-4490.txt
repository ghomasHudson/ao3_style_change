She set the phone to speaker and set it down on the counter as she sleepily tried to load the coffee pot, and Ivan's voice came through.
"That's why I said to get your backpack."
"Is that going to be enough?"
"No, it can stay. I don't even care."
"Why is the jump rope wrapped around the neck of that doll?" Naomi asked, choosing to remain in the hallway.
Dean shrugged, "I know what I'm doing, I know what I expect from people, and I'm not worried what they're going to think of me. But I was about your age when my dad kicked me out, I was homeless for a few weeks, and then I got a job offer at the same time I had a gun in my face, so, split second decision, I decided I didn't want any more run ins like that, I knew that was the way I was going to go if I didn't take that chance, so I started working for Bobby. Now, Bobby knew my dad, so he was able to get him drunk enough to sign something that let me change schools, and then I screwed that up a few months later, nearly beat a kid to death, Bobby had a hell of a time helping me get back on my feet after that. They didn't even want me in the alternative program. But when I got out of juvie, Bobby was waiting for me. Didn't matter what I did, he'd give me hell for it, but he was there for me every step of the way... Your parents never had it that bad, not as kids, anyway, and maybe that makes it harder for them to know exactly what they're trying to keep you away from."
"You need to sit down?" Kevin asked, already looking around.
Ben shook his head.
"Home. I'm staying home today. Nick died last night. You better head out, don't want to be late."
"Who? Claire? Or Samandriel?"
"Just get over here, you little shit."
"She apologized."
"No." the toddler echoed.
"I can't trick or treat anymore, I'm ten now."
"Doesn't matter, it all tastes like cardboard right now," he said, his voice low and unhappy.
"What, this?" Lucas asked, "Making things easy for the sheriff's department to find you. Though they could probably track you down just fine with the credit card info."
The house was quiet as she got ready for the day, and it didn't take her long to figure out that she was alone in the house.
"Why would you think that?"
"Okay?"
Cas nodded, "She doesn't want to to work at the school anymore. She's not prone to emotional mood swings, I have no reason to doubt that she's serious."
"I'm gone, man." Alfie said, popping open the door.
"I just... He said something last night, I don't think he'll remember. Sounds like he feels guilty about it, and I was just wondering if you had any idea what it might be about."
Ben shook his head as the words tumbled out of their own accord, "You aren't a backup plan, I wasn't going to ask anybody else."
"What if somebody goes too far, or gets violent, or something?" he asked, following Dean into the kitchen, as it had become obvious that two cups of coffee were not going to cover this particular morning.
Margaret set her hand on her hip, "You? You took away as many of my choices as possible, and told me I was only any good at stuff when it was what you wanted me to do. Now, I'm learning what an awesome person I am, without you around to make me question it, and Kevin is right about everything!"
"What?"
"You're not even close to it yet. You'll get a feel for it when you've been driving for a while."
"Yeah, I'm serious. I haven't said anything to your dad yet, but I don't think he-"
"Claire, that has no bering on this. You can't keep throwing it out there to shut me up. You need to take responsibility."
"Not yet. And Jaime has homework, if you think you're up to that. And Lauren's looking for you."
Having known Kevin for as long as his memory served him, Alfie knew well the physical motions that accompanied Kevin's mental attempts to explain himself in terms the average person could more easily comprehend, and those motions were occurring during a brief, but awkward silence.
"I'm still hungover, this whole thing came out of nowhere, who was I going to lean on for this? Sometimes it takes Kevin to straighten you out, I didn't know what else to do."
"Yeah, actually. Old sci-fi, too."
"Oh, God... So, what happened in there? You went to talk to him?"
"I was upstairs five times yesterday, it's not the stairs," Cas groused.
He'd asked about school, an easy cop out for any adult speaking to a child, and gained the usual answer, it was 'fine.' He'd apologized for missing her birthday, explaining that he had tried to call several times after the last number he'd had had been shut off, hoping it would be reconnected. Her reply had been both uncomfortable and forgiving, making excuses for her mother. He'd clarified what her age was, getting it right on the first try, and she'd talked about a movie she'd seen with some friends. He'd listened intently, but missed so much of what she'd said, silent tears in his eyes, just happy to hear her voice. He'd asked for the new address, and said he would be sending her mother child support, and asked if she needed anything... In a request that was all too familiar to him, she'd asked him to send her a photo of himself, as she didn't have any.
Cora huffed, "Only difference between us and singletons is I've been kicking his ass since before we were born."
"Yeah. When we were dating, he and his buddies spray painted some awful stuff on her car. I had to take it off and repaint it, because she hadn't learned how yet. He's a mess," Alfie replied, "He's sunk so deep in his own head, thinking everything bad in his life is someone else's fault, he may never get out of it."
Cas looked away sheepishly until Dean kissed him, dragging Cas' hand down to his ass, and squirming as Cas grabbed a handful.
"Oh my god! He picks you up at the mailboxes? How far do you have to walk?"
Dean scoffed, "You should have come back sooner."
"Maybe?"
"Yeah. Emma was crying. They wouldn't tell me, though, Aunt Millie said I had to talk to you, and if you wanted to know what was going on, you can call her. But it's a stupid secret, I mean, I could hear them through the door."
"Go get in, I'll be out in a minute."
"What?" Alfie asked, as a chill washed through him. He started scouring the page, far busier with faces, but Melody pointed straight to his father's face in a photo nearest to her.
"Yeah, I know."
"It's a four hour drive." Margaret said through a hushed sob.
Melody's fuss became much louder at the sight of her mother, reaching for Claire with one arm, before Rachel turned around to get her to retract the arm.
The door creaked open as she spoke, and a bedraggled Kevin wobbled in, "Sorry."
"When I had to adjust what I was eating, after my heart attack, the thing that helped me the most was that Grandpa tried very hard to stick to the same diet. There's nothing you can have that I shouldn't be eating, it's still very balanced, it won't be difficult for me to cook for both of us, and let your parents worry about themselves and Lauren and Jaime. It might even be easier for everyone."
"I hate you both, I just want to be clear about that," Naomi said smoothly, "Now, you both added a lot of loopholes, you're both in a position to royally screw this up. This entirely depends on you both respecting each other and actually showing up when you say you will, do you understand?"
Ivan nodded, "Yeah, okay... I guess she'd probably freak out less if you're there... But, y'know, in the future..."
Claire narrowed her eyes at the boy in the darkness. He had been taller than she was for months, but he was getting less lanky each time she saw him, a far cry from the tiny black-haired baby her closest friends had asked her to accept as her own should anything happen to them, or the skittish, skinny little boy frightened by the oddest things. She'd seen the changes he was growing though happen in both of her brothers, and would, she knew, eventually see in her own son. "Don't get too cold."
"Uh, yeah. Lots of fun," Alfie answered distractedly.
"So, 'Kill him with kindness?' You know, that doesn't always work."
"Okay, upstairs," Kevin said softly, "How are you feeling about this?"
Claire shook her head. "I'm really not planning on going."
Cas looked over her face closely, "That's all this is? Moving on?... You're not suicidal?"
"Because his father's on the school board, he has free reign to assault another student? Uri,-"
Liam abruptly knocked over the stacked cups with the toy dinosaur before scooting back, away from his toys.
"From what I can tell, she's scared to raise any of her own, but there's no way she'd drop Mike off at a fire station, she'd take care of him... Or, she'd be kind of hands-off, and let Alfie handle it. Think about how she is with Ben."
"Why? I thought we were pretty much okay? I mean, I fucked up, but-"
(See the end of the chapter for
Late into the night, one of the nurses had made it very clear that Claire was not going to be needed, and suggested she head home to her baby. Claire, fairly uncomfortable from being off of Melody's schedule, had carefully hugged Cas and Dean, and took Xander and Ben back to Ben's car.
"That's what I did. Ben wasn't planned, you know that. Lisa's uncle turned around real fast, suddenly I wasn't so bad anymore if it meant they'd get to see Ben."
"I'm sorry," he breathed.
"I suppose that's true. Still, considering lineage-"
Cas nodded, "Is there anything else I should know?"
"No matter what I do, even if he lives to be a hundred, he's gonna die someday." Margaret said through her tears, "And I'm just not okay with that!"
Something was different, yet oddly familiar as he sat up straighter to look at the items she'd put down before him, but as she was standing on the other side of the desk, her waistband was very much in his field of view. And just below the hem of her shirt, before the denim began, that waistband was knit. He knew where he'd seen them before, and it had been years.
"Who was that guy?" Sam prodded.
Cas shrugged, "Normally I'd suggest 'whatever makes her happy, and doesn't cause trouble,' but as you're here-"
Dean woke to find the bed otherwise empty, which immediately put him into a grumpy mood, but the door stood open and sounds and scents drifted in from the kitchen, quiet talking, eggs being scrambled, juice being poured, and a dog being let out into the back yard.
"She wants to eat your liver. She was just hiding it." Margaret answered, rubbing her hand just below her navel, "Why does skin stretching have to itch so much?"
Ben turned around and took the box to his closet, "You don't have a back fence, do you?"
"They fuck up my car, I can fix it. But who's gonna fix their truck?"
Randy scoffed, "We're charging you extra, anyway, just because we had to see your ugly face again."
She rocked back against him with a shaky breath, and a nod, "Ohh... more like that..."
"Hell no! Not when you're seventeen and everything revolves around one thing, and you're running around with an older woman!" Dean answered gruffly.
Kevin started back for the cubicle where they'd been, sitting down immediately. The man looked up from his phone as Linda followed Kevin in and sat down.
Claire had made a suggestion about running them all down with a forklift, but had also stopped them at one point and sent them inside for water. Cas had stopped in at the shop to leave his car for an oil change and find out from Dean whether Ben's friends were going to be staying for dinner.
After she left the table with a nod, Ben turned a suspicious look on Dean, "Okay, so?"
"It seems to be, this week," Cas answered dryly.
It wasn't that Ben hadn't seen her cry before, but even the first few times it had happened, she'd more closely resembled a roaring beast than whatever this was he saw now. Suddenly her rage seemed far less frightening than whatever had brought her to this point.
He crossed his arms, "Well, you're lucky I can read between the lines, boy, because you still haven't come out and said it, not directly."
Cas sat on the couch, continuing to counsel Jack, which had mostly devolved into providing a listening ear while he vented in hushed tones, as Dean, a bit more familiar with children under twelve, particularly little boys, had taken up a spot on the floor in Liam's bedroom, attempting to chat as though it were perfectly ordinary that the boy had been lodged below the furniture for over an hour and a half.
(A/N: Okay, this is a whole lot of action outlining a difficult day, but doesn't actually propel the story forward by much. Finished it and came within a centimeter of scrapping it as a chapter and loading it as a deleted scene side-story. Meh. Doing it anyway.
With a nod, she went back to the office, relayed Dean's message, and started back for the garage. She hung in his doorway a moment longer, "Are you still looking for somebody for the desk?"
Linda came home from her late weekend shift, filling in for a coworker, only to find Kevin in the kitchen. He was slamming pots and pans around, and a burnt smell lingered, but otherwise, there was certainly an edible meal in progress.
Dean took a sidelong look, scoping Cas' body, "You are way too relaxed. I may have to take advantage of that later."
"You. You're great with Cyndi, you don't care how I used to be, or what I did with who, and you got her talking more, and I just... I don't want to be some messed up girl for you to get all heroic over."
"His mom's bra?"
He pushed the keys on the digital lock to gain entry, and the door swung easily into the foyer, where he found the house to be mostly dark.
"I miss you." Margaret said softly, her tone was depressed.
"Of course," Cas muttered, "We can't have that."
She held her hand up, miming a phone to her ear, "Hello? Police? Yeah, I need a dozen glazed, and a dozen extra sprinkles. 'K, thanks, bye."
Dean grabbed Claire's arms interrupting her swing before she could connect, and lifted her bodily from the ground, one hand shaking the bar from her hands. "Claire, you have to stop. Nobody's gonna hurt you. But we need to get you inside. You're too cold, it's making you sick."
Ben nodded, silently chewing, and Claire looked up from her burger. "Cool, so you can just log in and check on him, huh?"
Alfie stared after her as she made her way to her room. The entire time he'd been in Dallas had been a rollercoaster of strange and boring, and when he thought his aunt couldn't get more controlling, impersonal, or unfeeling, she stepped it up.
"But you just said-" Dean was cut off as Cas' hands grabbed his ass firmly.
"You've been acting strangely since you got home, and-"
"Go away."
"Technically, I was th-"
Cas gasped as Dean moved lower rather abruptly, setting his nerves on edge. Suddenly a textured, wet heat replaced Dean's fingers, making Cas writhe and moan as he tongued the delicate flesh.
"Yeah, well, I'll get used to it. How have you been? Are you still working at the school? No, you know what, come join us, we were actually trying to look you up, but then, here you are!"
"That, too."
He could hear it in Dean's voice that he was nearing sleep again when Dean whispered against his hair, "Are you mad at me?"
"The less you know, the less you can tell your mom later... But I really couldn't figure a way out of this, so, either she's going to find out from you, and know you were there, or she'll find out a year or several years down the road when she talks to her sister, maybe. Either way, I'm getting neutered again when it happens."
"When?" Kevin asked, looking at the piece of paper, but discerning nothing from it as he saw red.
Melody set the tin on the desk, out of his reach as she fished around in her coat pockets. Lucas continued to pretend to ignore her as she pulled out a white envelope, "I need new handlebar grips, and I looked on the internet and they're clear with glitter, and they're six bucks. Can you do it for ten?"
Alfie tilted his head a little, "There's a few stories in there, and one, they were married for fifteen years, she goes on a girls night out, gets separated from her friends, and got attacked. Then she was like a completely different person, it just ruined everything for them, and they wound up getting divorced."
"Are you going to stand there while the water gets cold?" Claire whispered.
Claire nodded.
"Well, she spent time with you."
"Well, the kids are old enough, yeah, but what would they be doing? If we have to fly them all the way out to my parents, and back again after, we might as well just have Dean watch them for a weekend, and make it a shorter trip."
Claire's eyes opened wider. "Are you serious? ...I spent half an hour prying it open with a screwdriver, and all I had to do was go pull the thing?"
It had been hours, but Dean had been right. It was about dinner time for most people, and the general consensus had been to kick Kevin out to get something to eat so he'd be fully focused and available later, when things got more intense.
She adjusted the pillow below her cheek as she turned to look at him, "I was laughing at something the other day, and, I don't know, it just felt really weird, and a couple of days later, thinking about it, I realized it was because I wasn't faking it, I was laughing for real... I felt like maybe I had forgotten how... Then I cried for a bit, not because I was sad, but, just, I could feel something again. And then I felt really bad that, maybe, if I had started the medication sooner, I could have felt better years ago. But I'm still glad it seems like it's working."
Chaz looked to be about to say something when he spotted Xander headed back to the door of the bar, his phone still to his ear.
Dr Thompson made a note. "That's a subject that should be approached carefully, but why don't we just go ahead and expound on that, since you brought it up. Did he leave something out?"
'Ben was going to be a Sara,' I was supposed to be a boy. 'Ben was over 9lbs, the hospital baby shirts didn't fit,' that's my oldest. Second was born at home, only an ounce smaller, so I was already expecting to start in 0-3 size.
Cas turned back to Uri as he set his cue on the rack on the wall, "Well, we're done here, but you have a pleasant evening, Uri."
"Where's
"Yeah, I wanna know."
"It's preventative," Alfie suggested with a partial smirk.
"That doesn't sound so good," Dean said softly as he stepped inside, "What about you, are you okay?"
His voice came back tired and hoarse, but also unsurprised, "Good morning, Charlie. Do you mind waiting downstairs?"
"No," Mike answered her, "I'm up."
"You've seen me, but you're still doing this."
"We're trying to get her to stop without anything going into her records, that could follow her-"
At the shop, Lucas and Randy had gotten into a heated discussion about whether or not Barney the purple dinosaur was an allegory for Budai in children's television, and Dean had threatened to find a Barney CD Ben had had and play it in the shop nonstop until they dropped the conversation completely, but the conversation continued. Dean had gotten irritated enough that he'd had to walk away from that one.
"So, I guess your back is bothering you again? What was it this time, vicodin?" Alfie asked loudly enough to get the message across to Julie as they entered the small house single-file.
"So he was making comments?"
Claire continued walking toward her house. Alfie followed after her.
"Oh, come on!" Jack protested.
Cas waited patiently as Xander worked to get the words in order through the doubts that ate away at his confidence, "I was... I was thinking about seeing if Cora wants to get married, but, I... I don't know if that's the right thing, because-... You know, I don't want her to just be stuck with me, and I don't really know anybody, personally, who made it work unless they were both..."
Late Sunday, out of excuses, Cyndi finally dodged her younger siblings long enough to return her father's second missed call from the day before. Preparing to handle the call, she couldn't help musing at how much it felt like a chore, an obligation.
"Yeah, you've said that a bunch of times, like when you started dropping me off at the mailboxes." Claire responded.
"You are gonna-" the door creaked open again as Melody was getting to her feet, "-stay the fuck away from that Lowery kid-"
Sam nodded, shifting, "It can't be all dad's fault all of the time. Some of this, this distance? Part of that has to be on us."
"I take after my dad's side. Or, that's what they tell me," Claire replied.
"I have... I have a cousin I prefer to avoid, but I was an only child."
Just past Paula's heavy frame was a shy face with a split lip. The look in her eyes wrenched at his heart.
"Oh," Donovan answered with a nod, set to leave the interaction as it was and wonder off again, but he knew Lee would say it was too brief to count, "Well, was it something fun?"
"Keep going?" Margaret asked in a wistful tone.
"She's the one you should be saying that to."
"Yes, well, the paperwork does get interesting when two people divorce, and neither are in the country when it happens." the man answered in a deep, raspy voice with a light British accent. "You don't have to pretend to be happy to see me, Samandriel. I can guess a young man of your age would prefer to be left to his own devices."
Claire shook her head, "Nobody, right now. Mel's doctor wants to test something, though. I'm just... well, I'm a mess. Do you think you can drive me?"
Before he could turn his critical gaze on Ben, Ben spoke up, "Um, for my side of that, yeah, promise."
(A/N 1: Warnings, in this order... make-out scene, no big deal, descriptions of past abuse, sappy lovey dovey crap, and then some smut.
"There's one more thing, though, before the kids get up," Sam added, "We would really appreciate it if you don't tell the kids who your dad is, because there's no way they can keep their mouths shut, and I already have to be careful to keep a wall between them and my work, okay?"
Julie attempted to scoffed to cover a chuckle, "Stop it. Don't make me laugh when I'm mad at you."
The door had not even closed behind her as she posed the question, "What's wrong with your car, Mike?"
The playground of the elementary school bustled with children as Jack glanced around, looking for a fourth.
Alfie walked in slowly, still a mixture of overly cautious and absolute awe as he carried the baby to Claire.
"Lady troubles." Lucas called.
Through the front door, which he'd been too distracted to close, they could both hear the sound of a vehicle's tires crunching on the gravel road.
He put the bottle back in the open glove box and closed it, pressed the lock button and shut the door of the Chevelle. They had just started back toward the door when Claire pointed out a thin man in a suit approaching one of the hotel employees near the dumpsters.
Cas looked over the hood of the Jaguar, the hood ornament, the mess, and the faint traces of Dean's message as it began to dry. "You were right... That was fun."
"Okay," Kevin said, closing the door, "What's up? What's the wrong thing?"
"Yeah. Before he moved out here..." Dean said. "Listen, Claire didn't say it, she didn't have to, but the kid that hit her the other day, it's same one that made her walk home tonight. She said she was out there for about three hours."
Claire's face fell, "I was never going to tell you."
"They didn't send these emails, Dean. They may have had issues with the other students, but they didn't forge a letter from a teacher implying he routinely places his own head inside of his rectum."
"You're right. I'm sorry, dear. What was I thinking?" Kevin replied, "Honestly, after that stunt in Kansas City, I'm surprised Naomi wants me around at all. How much was clean up?"
"How long does that take?" Claire asked.
Cas stood up, breathing roughly, probably having just moved several of the paint cans and looked up. "Your father's here, better come down.. Carefully."
Much closer now, he could see the tears flowing down her face even as she raged at him, "I-... did w-what?"
because Charlie is unarguably the best at what she does. Unfortunately, since he went through my log-in to access hers, it begs the question of how he came by my password to begin with."
"No, it's all right."
Dean thought carefully, and the only possible occurrence came to mind, "Yeah, I think so."
"Don't you send him over-" Carl began, his voice low, but when faced with the outstretched hands of his only grandchild, he caved quickly, and settled the boy into the chair in the crook of his elbow, quickly pretending the awkward exchange hadn't happened at all.
"Probably nothing. Just gotta check on something, stay in the house. Both of you. I mean that." Dean turned back around as Cas came downstairs, "We're just gonna go walk over to Claire's for a minute."
Susie's joyful screams and some sort of chanting from Cyndi came through the moment the video chat connected, lightening his mood immediately.  He knew, at the same time he'd be going on, Julie would be dealing with bath times, bedtime, and stories, but a quick moment to connect with his family at home would make his side of things far less tedious.
"Yes, she and her boyfriend are living there now." Cas answered.
"You think this is funny? I'm sure you wouldn't be laughing if my husband were here."
"Phhht. Don't listen to him, he's just trying to get in your pants." Kevin replied jokingly, "So, do you want to hang it up? Or put it back in the tube and get him to frame it?"
Looking closely, she noticed a perfect reflection of the stars she had been looking at balanced in her eyes.
"Sorry, she's just-"
"Great, yeah, if she's up for it, just send her over around seven, I'll make sure I've got some cash for her, and for pizza, and write down my number, show her where the first aid kit is, all of that."
The therapist nodded. "You understand drug addiction is not grounds for terminating custody, don't you? The state regularly allows people suffering from addiction to keep their children so long as they are attempting to receive treatment."
"So, I guess, get in his way, start making out with her, and if there weren't a lot of people around maybe take it as far as she'd let me, totally about her, obviously, just to piss him off."
Normally so very in tune, capable of predicting each other easily, due to the stress and exhaustion of the day, neither had expected the other's movement. Margaret leaned down to kiss him warmly as Kevin attempted to throw his arms around her waist, as it was convenient to him, and off-balance, they managed to land tangled on the floor with a painful thud, his face in her chest, both quickly shaking it off with laughter at the absurdity of it.
"We're not at school. I'm well aware that young people favor rough language, especially when they think adults aren't around."
"That's not till ten," Margaret replied.
Dean sighed, "Poor kid keeps getting dragged around, probably just wants to be home with his mom."
Alfie scoffed, which, as he'd expected, earned him an icy glare.
"You'd be surprised," he answered, "I took your mom to her junior prom, and her ex-boyfriend went to her house and said some pretty awful things about her to Pop-pop, so, y'know, when somebody is a jerk, they can't hide it all the time."
"Oh," Cyndi pulled what she thought was the emergency brake release, as the two were close together, causing a thump from the front of the car as the hood popped up an inch and a half, "Oh, crap. Did I break it? What did I do?"
Cas shook his head, "I'm sorry, I don't have any answers for you. I wish I did... I do have some tea, though, and if you'd like to apply logic and science to that, the ingredients do tend to reduce stress."
Claire stepped closer as he turned the frame to show her, a smile spreading across his face. "Your mother said it was a costume contest at a Halloween festival. You were seven."
Ben rested his arm against a low overhead branch as he continued to look around, as his chest suddenly felt tight with the realization that Caitlin's family had a very different concept of the word 'strict.' He considered making a Rapunzel joke, but worried it would hurt her feelings.
"Of course," Cas nodded, starting for the back door with a less steady walk than Claire was comfortable with.
"Does your dog have a command for attacking people?"
"Are you hurt?"
"I think he hung up."
Alfie mumbled something about galleries and events he went to without her, and her concern began to grow, but there was a change in his tone just before he drifted away from sense, "I almost don't feel bad anymore for letting Crowley kill that guy."
"Just checking. Yeah, go. You two have a good time and stay safe," Ivan closed the door behind them before going back to the couch.
"Ben's not going to give you any trouble, we've got a bunch of movies, order a pizza, there's a small first aid kit in the upstairs bathroom, and also..." she followed him into the kitchen, "One in here, left of the sink, see?... Couple of things, I get you're a teenager, but if you drink, smoke, or have anyone over tonight, Ben will rat you out, and not only will you not be watching him again, I'll have to tell your dad. Whatever you do the rest of the time is your business, got it?"
"It's been fairly obvious for some time that you didn't seem to have the same interest in dating that Ben does, but at the same time, Ben never had a serious brain injury. I'm just curious if you discussed it with your doctor."
Dr Thompson nodded, "So, he's your buddy, he's a dad, he knows where you're at in life, what you're going through, and despite the fact that she looks like a grown woman, he sees your daughter as a teenager, and treats her like one?"
"I think you feel safe enough with him that it's not that much of a stretch."
"How'd it go after they kicked me out?"
Scoffing in reply, Cas shook his head, "I'll be quick. It's not like I've bent you over the desk, much less out front."
"You know," Alfie said, slowing to make a turn onto the street he'd been directed to, "Mike's dad once beat me at Magic using a Pokemon deck."
Thanks for reading! Hoping to have this story done before GISHWHES, if not, there will be a break during the hunt.
This got Dean's attention, and he looked over to where Ben had picked up his glass.
"...Is that why you hit Dean?"
Javier shrugged as he rapped his knuckles on the bottom of her boot, "Right. Except Dean. And your husband, he's been here longer than that. So, you gonna get your feet off the desk, and maybe tell me?"
"Well," Harker replied, "I wasn't there. And I haven't heard either way, so I'm asking you directly. Plans. Do you got any?"
Margaret shrugged again, "Yeah... But if I had to live a lie that big, I would just end up hating myself. Probably resent every part of it, you, the baby... Kind of funny, right? I'm done with them, and you're done with me."
"Oh, hey!... How's Ben?"
Deep down, though, he knew the only thing he couldn't do was walk away. Not from her.
"Still there?"
Melody only grumbled low in her throat and shook her head, popping a thumb into her mouth as he walked. Next to his ear as she was, Claire was certain he could hear the odd bubbling sounds in her tiny breaths.
"I'll think about it." Dean answered.
Alfie gestured to the door, "What's going to happen with the student who hit my daughter? Who put her friend in a headlock?"
"I know. You hit me pretty hard." Cas took a deep breath, finding it rattling slightly. "I'm going to let go, and I'm going outside. I'll come back in a little while, we will need to talk about this."
A small tremble ran through Cas, who was too drained to focus as his soul seemed to take refuge in the tiny bit of shelter provided by Dean's comforting embrace.
-girlfriend who's pregnant with your kid, and has got exactly you, me, and Claire that she feels like she can lean on, and wants to patch shit up with you, despite you doing every possible thing to get back with her except forgiving her, and admitting that it is exactly what you want. And I know that she walked away from her whole entire family over this baby, and it goes a lot deeper than that, but she hasn't told you that part because she doesn't want to use guilt to get you back." Alfie replied.
"That I'm not really your father?" Cas asked, "Only one person would say that, and I can't think of a reason you'd actually believe her."
"Cities are big and scary, traffic is bad, and you got me a taser to play with? Oh, and don't tase Alfie when he's driving."
Ben didn't want to think. He'd nearly finished with his tasks at Dr Parker's veterinary clinic, and everything had been a blur. Uncertain he'd done everything correctly, he backtracked and checked his work.
He looked around, receiving a chorus of nods from the three he could see, and a verbal affirmative from Ivan, below the Cadillac.
"Millie, c'mon... It's-"
"There's a moose."
Claire caught his other hand as it started to move.
"Okay," Dean replied, "We'd be glad to get that done, but we've got a bit of a wait."
daughter."
"What was I supposed to say? Seriously, Claire, how do you tell someone that?... 'Guess what? I put in a call to my uncle and said, 'hey, have the family corporation drop a couple mil on this chunk of space' so, tah-dah.' I mean, I was going to tell you, eventually."
"Shut up." Dean said without looking up.
Cas was still piecing together exactly what had occurred that Lee had been so upset about, but it was beginning to come together.
"It's not your fault. She's got every right to be upset, but all you ever did was give her everything she needed, and almost everything she wanted. She's gonna come around."
"Not since I figured out you were asleep. You okay, gorgeous?"
"You were only here in case something went wrong, he's got no reason to yell at you," Xander replied.
"You're making that up so I won't kiss girls, aren't you?" Ben asked.
"The movie was okay. It was nice to get out, I suppose. I might try to it a bit more often," Cas replied.
It was painful for him to know that for her, at the moment, it was very likely true, while there wasn't enough left of him inside to feel it. Below the pain, however, there was comfort in the familiarity of having her close by.
"No."
She knew she'd put Cyndi down on the couch before stretching out with Ivan, but at some point during the night, it seemed, Cyndi had woken up and found her way to the bed, and now resembled a large limp rag doll between them.
Dean seemed relieved, "Okay, so that narrows down how many asses I have to kick today. What are you doing? Do you know how fast people drive on this highway? Do you know what's gonna happen if somebody answers a text thinking they're in the clear, and they don't see you?"
Dean ended the call, and looked up, "You brought your bike today, didn't you?"
"He's probably texting his lawyers right now, Roy," the second offered, pointing toward Ivan.
Claire cut in before Cas could answer, "But if you're serious, you can bring over huge campaign posters with your face on them, ten feet tall, and post them all over both Singer locations, drop off buttons, whatever. Kick his ass. I'm sure Xander and Ben would vote for you."
"Are you sure you're up to this?" Cas asked, looking over the top of the locked trunk.
"Uh... if I say no, what are you gonna fix?"
"I can do better, and I should be doing better, okay? I admit it, I'm falling down on the job, but I'll sort it out and shut them up. I already got on to both of them about that tracking thing, I'll get them back in line, or tell them to go."
Claire looked up in shock, rarely hearing anything so harsh from him.
"She's not fit to take care of herself!" Jack objected, "You don't care who you hurt, as long as you get elected."
"Somebody needs to go check on Xander," Claire stated simply, "He's over at the house, and I think some girl is throwing rocks at him... I mean, I'd almost expect that with Ben, but, ...whatever."
"Worst case scenario, though, that's death from blood loss, possibly before the baby can survive outside the womb, and they both die," Cas said softly, giving a nod before running a hand over his face.
Cas settled his cheek against the top of Dean's head, and his arms across Dean's chest.
"Where's Cas?"
Dean looked back and forth between the two, "What?... What was that?"
Linda's concerned reaction didn't bother him as much as the smirk of adoration on his son's face, "What happened to the other guy, Dad?"
"Um... wrong neighbor... What's going on?" Sam asked, looking between them.
"I let this happen, Alfie, too, because we didn't listen to her, we didn't ask questions, we were too focused on getting her to stop."
Alfie froze, and started to slide out of her slowly, "Okay, it's okay... What do you-?"
"Great. Super. Got a total respect-boner for you. What the hell does that have to do with breaking things off without any hint about why?"
"Who's Javier?"
"Nevermind. I mean, your ears aren't pierced, how would you know, right?" Claire rambled slightly.
Dean rolled his eyes as got out of the chair, he'd been in a bad mood all morning, "Complaint department's on vacation."
"Why?" Claire asked, still smiling.
Claire nodded, "Dad can... Where the hell is Alfie?"
Still tired from her morning at the shop in town before collecting her children from school, Claire was looking rough as the small family gathered in the living room. The children seemed anxious, as organized family discussions were rarely called for, unless a new rule was being put into the works.
"It was only half a box of donuts."
Julie chuckled, "Seems like a really stupid thing to need to find out about, but she really wants an old car."
Alfie gave a surprised blink, "Um... Another one?"
All the way back to his car, he could still taste her strawberry milkshake.
"You don't wear these." Claire stated, but clearly questioned.
Looking past the porch, he saw a car pulling in, which quickly changed course and veered closer to the house. He didn't recognize it, and Alfie's reaction seemed to imply he didn't either, but it became clear as it pulled out of the way, parked, and the driver emerged.
"That was a good one..." Dean's voice came out as a whisper.
"Okay, well, I guess I'll have to check that out sometime." Claire replied, passing him the small plate.
"Sick worse. I mean, his friends are freaking out, couldn't tell me the rest, just said Will said whenever he did it, he was going to call her dad when he was done and tell him she cried the whole time." Kevin went silent, his expression uncharacteristically dark and heavy.
Cas seemed to agree reluctantly, "Mike, you weren't with whoever caused the damage in the first place, were you?"
Dean sat the rest of the way up, "Really? Okay, I'm awake, so let's get this done with, because I'm not having this discussion again tomorrow night."
"If I can get that family to leave town, leave my wife and kids alone, and do it without anyone getting hurt, I don't see anything wrong with wrapping it up blurred truths. Wallace and his busted nose change schools, Psycho Sr. has no reason to show up at Singer again, ever, and we don't have to wait on the local law enforcement to sit on their thumbs for three months and eventually tell the guy to tone it down. A hundred miles and we probably never see them again for probably less than what you could dig out of my dad's couch cushions."
"He wouldn't let me drive." Claire replied.
"Dean passed away last night. The boys had to drag Dad out of the room. He's downstairs now, Alfie's got him, but Ben and Xander, their moms... I'm not a hundred percent I have everybody in hand. But we need space for the folks coming out to pick him up, and-"
Dean felt it as Cas attempted a second finger, barely managing it, and tried to keep his muscles from squeezing down painfully.
Cautiously, Kevin slowly opened the door, only to find Mike approaching to open it himself, "Dinner. Preferably healthy. Got any ideas?"
"Yeah, nobody wants that on their records." Dean replied, "You know, I always heard boys were easier. I don't get it."
Margaret wandered away from the window as Kevin continued to watch the moose, picking up the brochures he'd taken from the front desk when they'd checked into the lodge, "Barnacles are probably high maintenance. Let's just take home a geyser instead, it'll go off on it's own."
As he got closer, it was increasingly apparent that the man in the suit was indeed Alfie, and despite a few decent blows he'd managed to land, he was indeed outmatched by the hotel employee. Cas tried to shove them apart, to make a gap between the two as he ordered them to stop, but Chaz had taken hold of Alfie's jacket, and was keeping him upright to continue to pummel him despite Cas' interference.
"You were doing burnouts, weren't you?"
"Dean, we would have annulled it later-"
"If you sit down on the floor, you won't see anything." the nurse spoke up, turning then to Claire, "You know you can have whoever you want with you, right? Or we can wait for your dad."
Cas moaned deeply as his hands went for Dean's hair, "You're finding each one."
"Necessary things. I won't lie to you, but I won't bog you down in the details, either. I'm doing my part, here, and I won't apologize for it."
"Do you want to help?" he asked abruptly, biting back the chance to call her out for not caring when the original injury had occurred, "No? Then do me a favor and pipe down."
"Thank you."
He returned to the kitchen cooly, setting the broom back on it's hook inside the pantry door.
Alfie had chosen to ride along, and as it was a slow day, Dean had had no objections.
"What if I need to process these thoughts, though?" he asked.
Alfie's blood ran cold. He'd heard it once or twice, between sobs in the middle of the night, and only once in one horrible conversation the following morning. "Should it?"
Nathan shook his head, "I don't go to her church. And, actually, after she disowned her own kid, and everyone around her just encouraged her to dig in her heels, well, I found a new church. I grew as a person. And honestly, to tell somebody that they're going to hell means you're claiming to know what God thinks, even more than God does, so how is that not a sin in itself? ...No, hell, I think that's reserved for people who actually go out of their way to hurt people. I believe in a forgiving God, who defaults back to love, as often as possible."
"From my side of things, it seems like you're shrinking."
Still lost to the world, shaking in her throes, Claire hardly felt it when Alfie pulled his hand free and grabbed her hips, lifting her off of him, and letting her fall across his chest toward the back of the couch as his own climax hit him hard, thick spurts landing where they may.
Cas shrugged as he set the bottle down, "You're criticizing the fact that I've kept this place in good repair?"
"It's different because your mind is wired-"
"You're going with Claire and Alfie to California," it was a statement with no hint of question.
His words echoed in her ears as she was caught by surprise, unsure whether she'd heard him correctly, but she did somewhat recognize his voice. She turned her head slowly, trying to keep her expression as neutral as possible, wondering if the young man was posing as Alfie in order to impress her, but catching sight of the mole next to his nose, she was certain it was him.
Making better time through traffic than Cas did with paperwork, Claire called him as she paced near the main entrance of the largest building in the town's small medical complex. Mike, less jittery by a mile, sat on the side of a large planter, trying to keep Lauren amused.
The ride to the gallery had Claire rolling her eyes as Naomi repeatedly reminded her of her duty to uphold her husband's popularity and marketability by giving him space so his ambiguous relationship status would be upheld.
Nick had found a small stick, and Ben was tugging at it as he looked up, "What's a homewrecker?"
Claire looked through the back window trying to catch sight of the sign that gave the number of the county road they'd taken, "Trust you? If you weren't acting like this, I might."
Dean heard the office door at a quarter till two, and soon Claire had entered the garage.
"Kevin wouldn't hurt a fly." Margaret answered.
"That's great. Really... Um, what was that rule we had? About the kids seeing my mother without one of us there?"
When the bedroom door swung open, Dean was surprised to see Cas enter, damp with sweat, "What's going on?"
"Why am I in trouble?"
"I don't know. I mean, you don't want to?"
"Can I watch?" Kevin asked quietly, only to be met with a slap on the arm from Margaret.
Alfie pulled the tails of the black silk shirt free, unbuttoning it, rolling the hem up, tying the free ends in front of his sternum leaving his white undershirt showing, and took a quick selfie, sending it to Kevin with the caption, 'They said I could be anything, so I became a panda.'
"Shut it, shit-for-brains. Where are you right now?"
Claire shook her head, "I have work, we're moving, and I want to go home. I think I was right last time, standing up to her, I just, I don't know."
"Claire, would you be comfortable waiting outside for a few minutes?" Dr Thompson asked.
"I'm fine. Really."
"It's more likely that you both would have fallen... You were on the way down, though. You were going against the peer pressure to jump, making it easier for Xander to feel like he didn't have to. You did the right thing." Cas answered, hazarding a glance over the side.
"Okay...Yeah, I know, trading baseball cards or whatever, I did that."
"Not sure I'll be able to learn it without giving away the whole thing, though, if I'm home."
"Can I go now?"
"Well, just, me and her, right? Drain our bank accounts, like, absolute zero plus a little debt. I'd be back on my feet in two days, but her? She'd be completely screwed. Alfie said her side of the family was originally from Austria, missed the whole revolution, and as far as anyone knows, never not had tons of cash... I think his dad had the right idea, stranding him here, even if they did a really bad job of it. Took the silver spoon right out of his mouth, you know?"
"Nevermind."
"You're admitting it?" Millie asked, "Wow, that must have been really difficult, I mean, this has only been not-a-thing for the last three or four months!"
"So... as it turns out, baby girl can, in fact, throw a punch."
Sam watched as Cas rolled his eyes, "She's not convinced?"
"Hey."
"No, I haven't."
Lucas shrugged, "She said you don't leave the couch until she says so."
"Claire, jus-"
"You're not supposed to-" Kevin started, but he was immediately cut off as Linda reached into her purse and pulled out a few foil wrapped chocolates, passing them to her, "Mom! You're gonna piss off the nurses."
"He's scared. He has to be. If he's not scared of being dropped in the next person's lap when you get bored, he's a lot farther gone than you want to think about."
She nodded, "Right. Could've been anything. But you, they've known you since before I was born, never said a bad word about you, so I think I get why they'd call you about it, knowing I would be here anyway."
Dean ran a hand along Cas' thigh to his raised knee as Cas gave a comfortable hum that was nearly a purr, "So how old are those?"
"Yeah, we used it with Jaime, too. At least, we did, until he figured out how to climb out at eleven months. I think Melody had a hand in that," Claire tilted her head, silently recalling how unusually soon Jaime had begun toddling after Melody, "Oh, come in here, you'll like this. I think I told you I had a birthing tub with Melody?"
Ben shrugged, "No. She doesn't talk to anybody. I finally got her to talk to me, and she said she just wants me to leave her alone."
"He was in the yard pulling a fuel door," Lucas answered quietly, "They're about two minutes away."
"He never said a word about that, but I know you... Get some sleep, okay?" he said as quietly as he could, jostling James to hush him as he moved toward the door. Claire's eyes held a hint of anger, but he made it to the doorway without bloodshed, which he found telling. If he made it downstairs, she probably wouldn't kill him later on, even once she was feeling up to it. There were few enough people in the world that Claire would trust with her children in the first place, and while he was sure she'd never admit to it, she did trust his intelligence, if not always his judgement.
"I don't know what she wants. But she sucks slightly less than his dad's bunch... Sort of. I mean, she's mean and nasty, but his father's side is dangerous."
Xander flipped her off as he started for the door once more, making her laugh. Ben was glad to hear it, and if he was being honest with himself, he'd have complained less about the distance he'd been experiencing from Xander and Jack, as he would have had no intention of leaving Caitlin, and Caitlin hadn't had any interest in going anywhere since her father had left. She'd made it to her classes that morning, and he'd taken her to the grocery store afterward, but for the most part, she was still alternating between incredibly emotional, and numb.
"Damn... I though that was your thing," Ivan chuckled, bouncing James gently.
"Marc," Cas spoke up, "I'm sorry, but I'm actually recovering from a heart attack, and I'm afraid we'll have to talk some other time."
Dean shrugged one shoulder, "My mom liked it... And, I don't know, it's sweet, pretty basic love song, and no genders, so... Sorry, sweetheart, I know I can't sing for shit. Probably kept you awake, just-"
"Of course." Cas replied, waving her in.
"Um, so, you gonna pay for those?" she asked.
Checking the reading with his flashlight, he set the thermometer down, and picked up a folded quilt he had set on the couch. "Not good, you're still too cold."
Cas sat up again with a tired groan, retrieving his phone and dialing Alfie's number.
"Oh, thank god." Alfie muttered, looking around.
"Yeah, actually, I do know, that's why I asked if they actually said 'conversion therapy'... And it's sick, and it's why I'm going along with this." Kevin replied, slowing down to make a turn.
"Okay," she answered, "That's okay, we can talk about that later."
Concerned, he went back downstairs.
Rachel laughed slightly in response, "Brand new parents, always so obsessed with the baby. It'll pass. You'll have a bigger house to make room for a nanny when you get tired of running every time she cries."
"Just letting you know I know what an appropriate song is,
Conceding, Cas nodded toward the garage, "Then I suppose we should."
At the top of the stairs, just to the left, he cracked her door only an inch or two, "Claire?"
It was after two in the morning by the time the three of them made it back to Naomi's high rise apartment.
"Don't be a bitch," Ben said quietly, "Your Grandma's dying, you can at least put it off for a few days."
Cas huffed, "He'll cave even faster if his father threatens your safety, you realize that?"
Dean cringed, "Oh, that would have been incredibly hot if it wasn't bringing something else to mind right now."
"That's odd, I thought she was still asleep." Cas replied, "...It's because of that bandage, isn't it?"
Alfie shook his head, "That was working for me."
Cas looked horrified, "Claire, that's enough."
Dean shrugged, "You're not far off that, now."
"You were in a car accident."
"Samandriel, please. Obviously you knew the risks of swallowing something as pungent as kerosene. If you were that desperate to amuse yourselves, it must have been worth it," Crowley murmured in an unamused tone as he retreated to the guest room, "I'll rest a bit easier knowing you had the sense to stay out of the water. Life isn't something to be so careless with."
A look of concern washed over her face, "Yeah, but it shouldn't."
(A/N: New chapter!
"Claire-" Alfie said, stopping in his tracks, "Believe me, I see that. Every bit of it. It's taking over your whole life lately. That's exactly why I didn't bring her over to the shop to hole-up in the office with you, and I didn't want her at home being ignored by me, she's little, she needs attention. But take two seconds, okay? Stop being angry with me for two seconds, and tell me, why, given every opportunity to do anything you wanted, are you working this hard to open a second car shop in town? What's keeping you from staying home all day, every day?"
Thanks for reading and sharing this story with me. FW)
"Yeah." Gabe answered, "I saw that."
Ben wiped at the scratch, "Uncle Bobby told him this story about this guy that got lost in the mountains or something, I don't know, dad tells it better, and the guy was going to give up, and he stopped, and it was cold, and he knew he was going to freeze to death, and he didn't care anymore, but he went a little bit further and found a town, and he lived. So later, he looked at a map, and he had walked over fifty miles, and the place where he was going to give up was only one mile from the town, and that's where he was going to die."
"Mags... I don't know why I decided to be an idiot about this, but one thing he said is he's not asking to be in contact, because he doesn't want to make any of it any harder on you. That's why your sister called me when he turned up, and they wanted family to come get him."
"Where'd it come from, though? How'd it get out?" Ivan asked quickly.
"Nope," Lucas called, sitting back down into the desk chair, "Got to be about that time, and Cas drove her, since Alfie's already in town. They just stopped over here to drop off the homunculous first."
"Yeah, well, she helped Ben, too, so I owe her."
"Hop-pop," Lauren called unnecessarily as she climbed onto the couch, bringing Cas a hairbrush that seemed very large in comparison to her small stature. She insisted he accept it from her and dropped clumsily to sit on the edge of the couch beside him, her legs dangling from the edge as she waited patiently.
Claire nodded, "Okay, that works. I hope she's not giving you too much trouble."
"I miss you."
"My uncle had a guy... probably tortured, weighed down, and dropped into the... deepest known point of any ocean... I think he was still alive. Because I said I knew his name."
Uncomfortable, Alfie shrugged, "She, uh... She cleaned up the blood, helped me wash them out, put ointment on it, and used some butterfly tape on the worst spots."
"I hate you for bringing this part up."
"I never wanted to make her proud, Dad. Everybody else in my life, yeah, but not her. I think I probably knew the whole time... I don't feel bad about not going, now."
"What did you do with the cars?"
"Mammmmaaaa!" she fussed, as tears threatened at the edges of her eyes.
Alfie looked over the printed news articles and released security stills, the same words repeating over and over. 'Bartlett,' 'California man,' 'missing,' 'island vacation,' and that was just the headlines and keywords. His face slowly drained of color, and he felt sick to his stomach as he looked up.
"The midwife isn't there, neither is Alfie, and she was going this route because she wanted to be left alone as much as possible, remember?"
Claire had sleeping fitfully, and he was concerned what even the mention of a trip to California would do.
Claire ate quietly as Cas set up the coffee maker, and looked for a bottle of painkillers, eventually returning to the table with a large mug of coffee and a double dose of ibuprofen.
"What?" Cas asked in a startled voice.
"If I do, on accident, call me on it and I'll come back in here and put on one of the bikinis myself." Alfie said, letting a smile take over his face, "And I'm pretty sure there's some robes in there, too."
"I'm weaning you off it."
"Have you lost it? We've only been going out for a few weeks. Last Thursday night wasn't supposed to happen."
"How bad was Alfie's accident?" Claire asked, trying to get her coveralls off without dislodging her shoes.
"Did you two gentlemen just get married?" the old man asked, shifting his grip on his cane.
"Hey," Cora gave his elbow a quick squeeze, "I'm not saying something to be a bitch, I'm saying something because I'm worried, okay? It's mom-stuff, and it's all kicking my ass at one time."
Ben pointed, "Top drawer... Cas says there's dead bodies in the woods."
A motion caught Dean's attention where the gravel road approached the highway, causing him to focus on it with a squint, as the figure was still too far off.
Alfie nodded, despite the hatred that rose within him at the idea of anyone attacking his wife, especially in her obviously pregnant condition, "I never should have asked any of you to come with me."
Alfie shut off the water and gave the bear a thorough squeeze, leaving it in the sink as he stepped to the stove, removing a pre-packaged frozen dinner from the oven, and setting it on the table.
"Probably horror movies." Ivan guessed.
"You staying with her?"
"Cas..."
"No, he does that when I'm single, I never told him off for it before, so, I don't know. It doesn't bother me, usually," Cora explained, "But then he said some shit, like, he said like, he
Xander looked over his shoulder, "Would you go? To the car show, I mean."
Alfie started to reach for her, but she had turned to go back inside.
He hadn't noticed what she had picked up before leaving their bedroom when she stopped at the dresser, but now as she bent forward, he could see her wedding ring in her fingers as she set it down atop the device. The static crackled slightly differently, but no louder.
A brief flash of light caught his eye further off, but he ignored it. Rachel took another glance at the image where it was displayed, and gave a nod, walking toward it.
"Fair enough," Crowley answered, "Thank you for your patience. I'll see myself out," he gestured to the screens, "and evidently, so will you."
"So, just hanging out with your grandpas, then, and getting a little more strict where maybe your parents were more permissive?" Garth asked.
"What does that have to do with it?"
During the course of the evening, he planned to have Alfie and Claire help him move everything away from the wall the was the end of the building, and tomorrow the crew would open it up, joining the new room into the current garage.
"I-..." Alfie ran a hand over his face as he was met with his own frustrations, and decided he had no place burdening his daughter with him, "I will talk to her, talk her down, but you gotta promise me two things, Mel."
Margaret shrugged and looked away.
"Were you close with Bobby?"
As the afternoon had dragged on, Ben had eventually had to leave, although Margaret, ever loyal, had stuck around the house, waiting until Melody was out of earshot to relate the tiny details to Claire. Tired and shaken, Melody had followed her father upstairs as he followed the usual routine to get Lauren down for her nap, and Cas had wandered off with some noise regarding meeting Jaime's bus, and speaking to Lucas.
"There's a million other places we could do that... Places that might be easier."
He bit back a chuckle, "Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. That's, uh, that's my younger boy. Lee was about to be in bigger trouble than I want to admit to. But Donovan, no, he's in seventh. But you wouldn't be here if you weren't worried about it. So what's going on that got you all shaken up?"
Claire tried to push past her feelings, and remind herself he hadn't done this on purpose.  "Sounds like your aunt is the one who owes me an apology, not you."
Sam stopped in his tracks, "Wait, what?"
"Aw, come on! I need to go find them, they're probably in the car," Dean complained as the cuff clicked shut around his wrist.
Cas got out and marched straight for the bays.
Cas nodded, "I'm sure you're well aware why."
Claire seemed to move quite a bit all at once, "I can't wear this. This is tight."
Alfie shook his head, "It broke."
"If you're going to sneak up on me to get me back, you need to be quieter." Alfie's voice was barely a whisper, but the echo of the bare walls and tiled floor carried it. Claire stopped in the hallway.
Dean glanced at Ben, considering the offer. It was hard to know sometimes, where family began, and where it ended.
"There isn't, I checked... Do you get how weird it is that you guys have this down like some kind of weekly ritual?" Claire said softly, not wanting the children to hear her.
"That was supposed to be private," Naomi replied, doing her best to save face.
"You saw her, right?... The blonde girl? Really pretty? Do you want to know what happened to her? Her mother was going to make her do porn, and that pales in comparison to what had already happened. She was fourteen at the time."
"Boring, stressful, and nailed it. For all of them." Claire answered, "I don't exactly have perfect grades, but this is going to be better than last year... So, um... Why did you drop out, anyway? I mean, everyone knows, but I've never heard why."
"All the deserts are gone," Jaime reported, "And Daddy says Grandpa's a jackass."
The woman narrowed her eyes, exaggerating her already wrinkled skin, "Honey, I have been holding onto Marian's little heirloom for a damn good long time now. I've been very patient about this, I don't mind waiting longer. Have you got an I.D. card with your middle name, and your birth date on it?"
Claire pointed out an open gate, "Left turn."
"There's a bunch of the crispy rice ones... way to ruin good chocolate." Claire commented.
She seemed to miss everything he'd said, "I panicked and froze because he used a word someone else used... I had to pull over and throw up on the way home."
"Nobody wants your granny-panties and giant bat-wing arm tape, lady," Xander answered in a mouthy tone.
Kevin rolled her with a hint of roughness onto her back, settling against her, "Voulez-vous un morceau de gâteau? Celui-ci n'a pas de poivre."
"Of course, what legacy does that leave this upstanding guy with? The good man we came to see off today, he was not in the business of getting rich, or leaving his name. What mark does he leave on the world, now that he's going from it?" The question hung in the air as Rabbi Jake allowed the idea to sink in, "There is a great gift in generosity. Once you have received it, it never leaves you, no matter how many times you pass it on. That is the place that many good people of many faiths find what they call 'God.' I'm told Dean did not consider himself religious, but his family has another idea on that. Dean put his faith in people. His people."
Digging below a pile of cables, she retrieved a bottle of bright yellow nail polish.
"That's not the point. I know it belongs in a museum, that's the difference. There's no reason for me to have to open the email app just to see who the message is coming from, and the subject, that's ridiculous. I showed them my set up beforehand, and they didn't listen to me," she complained, "At least I've got you, you know how to get into things you're not supposed to, and you can put that to good use."
"You will. I'm going to be here running this one, and half the time managing whatever fires crop up at home. Once it's off the ground running, though, if it isn't worth the involvement, I'll convince Dean to let you buy it outright, and you'll be set up."
"Part of my insides were sick, the doctors took the sick part out," Dean explained to the tiny child, "Too much junk food."
He'd decided to be direct, and responded that they were well, even with the added stress of the district currently looking very closely into Cas' records, but that he was confident the issue would clear itself up in short order. His acquaintance seemed disappointed to see that Xander had been less than rattled, and that disappointment, as though he'd wanted to see Xander concerned or upset, is what dug at him as he got into his truck.
Looking up with glee on her face, Lauren showed him the small snake happily, "Noodle!"
"It's at a lake. My dad said I should spend some time with his brother and my new aunt because I don't know them very well. But he can't go because of the shop."
"No," Melody said quietly.
"Why do you have her phone?" Cas asked.
"You really don't."
Looking up from his phone as he'd reread the text from Alfie aloud, he found Margaret's hand over her mouth, and shock tinged her eyes, "How?"
"Hey. I'm not trying to get in the way, just, even with you guys being back together, she still doesn't have a lot of people to lean on."
"I've heard that, yes," Hannah answered with a slow nod, "But the possibility of that potential manifesting in a destructive way is what gives me cause for concern about allowing you into my high school... I've seen your assessment scores. They don't match your grades. I thought, at first, it was a lack of effort, but then I saw a pattern. You're holding yourself back."
"Um... I got shaken up by a customer."
The distance to her own driveway was not terribly long, but it did occur to her as she made her way there, that the boy had to have been perfectly secure in his trust in Dean to attempt to go for a joyride in the Impala, as neither of her brothers would ever have considered it.
Ivan made an involuntary choking sound, "Uh..."
"I'm great," she answered sarcastically, "Go sic some lawyers on somebody for looking at me sideways."
He'd had Lauren in his lap the moment he sat down, but as Claire carefully kept it together just long enough to get the words out, Melody curled into a tearful ball in the corner of the couch, and Jaime was on his feet marching for the back yard, loudly proclaiming his mother a liar.
Cas gave another mute nod, and pulled Dean close for a kiss.
"Not for the thing with your husband?" he mumbled.
"I figured that part out, at least, okay? I don't want to die," Ivan breathed a sigh of relief at her words, and waited as she continued, nodding to himself, "I thought about walking away from all of it, and if that's what it takes, I'll do it, I'll be a washed up has-been, I just don't want to die... I'm scared."
Dean watched as Claire hung her head. He waited, trying to give her time in case she had anything to say, but her silence was clear.
Claire stopped him, keeping him above her, forcing her breathing to a relaxed pace.
"Dad, I don't know what to do." Claire sounded determined but desperate, her voice hushed, and he could hear gravel crunching as she paced, "Dean's out on a tow, and Ben's up on the stack Xander fell from. He's not answering me, and he's got something in his hands."
"Is she hot?"
"You think maybe we should burn all of them?" Cas asked, "Would that help her any? To not carry these things around?"
"Man, I can't tell you how sorry I am that this landed on you like that, when I'm the one that set the psycho shithead off to start with." Ivan said, propping open the hood of the small pile of rust that was once a sedan.
"Well, he has a car, probably needed something done."
"What?"
"Goddammit, Ben," she carefully began the process of getting up from the couch, a small ordeal on it's own, and readying herself to leave.
With a nod, he settled back in his seat, only to find one of the arm rests had been pushed up while he was gone. Claire seemed to be absorbed in the movie, but with a smirk, he pulled her closer, wondering if he should ask another question to get her to whisper in his ear again, or if it would be pushing his luck.
"That didn't come out right... No, look, all that horrible crap you hear on the news, most of the time, a kid gets hurt, goes missing, turns up dead, half the time it's 'mom's boyfriend,' right?... Nobody plans for that. My mom didn't plan to date scumbags, but it happens... and just, what harm is it gonna do, if later on, things don't work, I still get to see her sometimes?"
"But I sure as hell wouldn't tell her she could never play again, either. I wouldn't stick her in a wheelchair and say 'that's it, honey, don't even try, you're ruined.' But this is no broken leg, and you know it."
"Oh, and the best part wasn't even the book."
Dean gave a shrug and stepped closer, settling an arm around him, and giving him a tender kiss. "Go take care of your kid. I'll see you later."
"So they know what you do for work."
Dean ran his hands up Cas' ribs, raking his short nails gently over the sensitive skin, getting a quiet, pleased noise from him, and kept going, continuing to try to rock his hips.
"Margaret, how are you feeling?" the doctor asked.
Claire exhaled a bit more strongly through her nose, "And I've accidentally trained you to be the person on the receiving end of that."
"Oh, yeah. And short skirts, and tall boots, and really bad teen makeup, so-"
"And who have we got here?" the older fellow asked, looking in Mike's direction, having closed the door.
"Yeah," Kevin nodded, "I guess I should tell you, I thought about it, too. I just figured done with one part meant done with the other, and I didn't want to ask you."
"Not anymore."
"Hot? Pretty sure you said hot before." Claire muttered.
"Okay, I want you to think about that glass of water, what was wrong with it? Was it cloudy? Or, um, bitter? Taste like salt?"
"Um, yeah?" he answered cautiously, climbing up the ladder once again.
Having seen Mike off into Claire's care, as Margaret would have had a longer drive from the shop on the county road, Cas had sent a text to Kevin's phone, and returned to the meeting room.
"Speaking of last names, I'm thinking even if my dad changes his, I'm going to leave mine as it is."
"So, what really happened?"
Claire nodded, following him back to the front office, "Yeah, at least I got this one."
"Of course I was, your ass was at eye level," Cas reasoned.
"Weight bench in the garage." Cas replied.
Kevin nodded slowly, taking in her words and trying to assess any possible questions he might need to address, taking his time, "You want this to be a formality, only. No other changes."
"I already am... Do you want me to help with your hair, or just pass you stuff?"
Something in the way Claire had calmly tossed the relatively minor insult her way, two plain, uncolorful words, had cut into her years of built up guilt, and eased her burden. Claire's anger seemed justified, if not exacted and avenged, and yet it humanized her deeply. She was not untouchable or perfect, she was not a saint, she was flawed. She had the same fears, worries, hopes, dreams, and irritable moods as everyone else. It made her own failings feel comparable, as though they'd reached a more even ground, and it assured Julie that despite the loads of forgiveness Claire had provided her through the years, Claire didn't hold her blameless, and that the events had actually been damaging enough to deserve the apologies given.
Cas couldn't find the words to reply as Claire made her way to her room, closing the door.
"How long?"
"She trusts me? ...She didn't tell Julie to shove it and stay away from me, because she trusts me not to fall for it?"
Claire was sympathetic as she carefully got to her feet before helping her husband up from the floor, as he carefully put most of his weight on his far less damaged leg, "Give it time, he'll be following you around again when the novelty wears off. It's just different with another guy in the house."
(A/N: When it rains, it pours.
"What'd she say?"
"Your dad stopped to get Dean since he's still not walking very far, and I came out and asked if they could take her for a bit so I could get some stuff ready, this isn't some huge deal-"
Cas pulled Ben into a tight hug, not minding the tears, "What about you, Jack? How'd you get mixed up in this?"
Cynthia choked back a sob as she'd begun to cry, her emotions still a wreck and easily manipulated, and took a deep breath as Claire tried to sort out her own. Her words, likely rhetorical, were quiet, "Why does everything in my life have to be so hard right now, like, all at one time?"
"Okay, the curve in the middle is a cheekbone, you're kind of looking at the bottom of it, it blocks off a little of the eye-"
"Works for me." Ivan answered, settling into a booth by the window, letting Cyndi stand on the bench next to him as he opened up the piece of paper, "Okay, so, when I was your age, I liked Big Bird. But he has this long beak, and all we've got is red and blue. So, Elmo, or Grover?"
"He's climbing over one, I think."
After some more fumbling with the corsage, and pictures on the porch, by the gate, and by the car, Dean appeared around the bend. "Put the camera down and let them leave, Cas. You're going to make them late."
"-smaller families... What?"
"Well, whatever it is, you're clearly not taking any shit off of anybody. Though I suppose you could have been John Wayne in a past life."
"The kid at the bar," Dean muttered.
"I don't want to just drop this, so can I just ask, are you okay with me getting that book?"
Dr Thompson gestured to Cas and Dean, "And the 'dads' are okay with that?"
Claire shrugged, "I'm sure I'll find out later. Didn't you have homework?"
"Yeah, I'm not going." Ivan said with an aire of certainty.
"Ah!" Marc said, pointing at nothing in particular, "Good ol' junior high! What's he doing skipping work with a big old job like that?"
"If you both weren't always arguing, you'd be asleep right now," Susie mumbled, heading back to her room.
"Great." Claire replied sarcastically, "So, you know really bad, basically that means you don't have a good idea what a good one looks like. Hell, neither do I."
Chaz jabbed a finger toward him, "You don't give a shit that he-" he jabbed the same finger in Alfie's direction, "-is messing around with the kid you keep pretending is yours? And you don't think that murderous bitch is going to let shit slide?"
"Hi Mr. Novak. I'll get my dad." Ben turned to call for Dean, but Cas stopped him.
Cas looked genuinely confused, "How did you figure out the song?"
"What was the other thing you wanted to tell me?" Kevin asked, putting the car in park.
Claire nodded once more, attempting to answer with an 'okay' of her own, only to have the word get stuck in her throat.
Less than pleased, but desperately trying to cope with her situation, Claire nodded hesitantly.
He watched through the glass, anxious about letting her out of his sight, but as she had learned to do on many occasions before, she marched directly to the counter to give her name, checking in for her appointment, and was directed to wait. She sat down easily, far from the door, and where Kevin could spot her in the corner of his eye.
"What did you hit?" Dean asked.
Trying to hide her nervous behavior, she approached the building in a quick and businesslike fashion, and slipped through the door.
"You don't have to-"
He set down his ratchet and socket and hurried to the door of the paint shed, concerned when he heard a louder slamming inside, and realized it had to be something larger than a raccoon, but he couldn't stop himself once he'd reached the door, and soon discovered it was Claire. She had thrown a few loose items sitting out, durable items, onto the floor, and was now frantically punching at the inside of one of the sheet-metal walls.
Rachel nodded, "I'm very proud. And as long as that hideous picture of me never sees the light of day, I'll stay proud."
"I thought that was fine when she's working? That's what she told me."
"What does this have to do with me?"
"Yeah, but literally, by my shoulder. Xander was ready to flatten him, I don't think I've ever seen him like that before, and Matt followed the guy out and worked him over in the parking lot," she explained.
"It's okay," Ben said quietly, "I'll put the salad together, we can do those frozen microwavable burgers."
"No, it's cooking," Alfie replied.
"Playing by the rules, remember? I'm not allowed to see you guys except on your own turf, your house. That's how you wanted it," Lucius replied. He spread his hands as best he could with one holding the gift, still, "So here I am. Seems like Claire's in a good mood, since she hasn't threatened to murder me this time."
Cas nodded as he felt another finger on the edge of the opening, and continued to breathe deeply, but lost for words.
Kevin looked at at her defensively, "I just mean, if we... Just, probably a good idea if at least one of us knows what the hell we're doing."
"Can I be excused?" Melody asked quietly.
Dean was about to slide under the Toyota again, but stopped. "Okay, I gotta know, why?"
Claire shrugged, "You're scared."
Alfie leaned his chair back, "What's up?"
Cas stopped typing and faced him more directly.
"It's ten blocks away."
"I quit because you didn't care if I got hurt!"
"I guess that's probably for the best."
"I don't know," she complained.
Alfie grinned and slammed against the door a little harder, "OHGODCLAIRENOTTHATHARD!"
"Only to children," she answered.
"Maybe you couldn't handle it because you're guys. Margaret's gonna love this one, telling her how my dads sat me down in front of my boyfriend to talk about how scary girl-parts are." Claire suggested with a hint of attitude.
Ivan nodded and got up, heading to the garage.
"I have seen Claire get violent with her dad, with her friends, and I've even taken a few of her hits, so trust me when I tell you, she was really holding back. You might be bigger, but she was still looking out for you... Now, me and Cas are going out tonight. You're old enough to stay home by yourself, but I checked with Claire, she's going to be home in case you need anything, because she's still willing to look out for you."
"Right at the start. Well, after that first time, I mean."
Cas nodded in agreement, "Yes, you've both been very reliable through this whole mess, and that really does mean a lot to both of us, knowing we can count on you both."
"Long day?" Jack asked.
"I guess so. I mean, it's not like a month, and it's family, so it's not strangers." Ben looked toward the shop, "But my dad is going to be here by himself the whole time. He hasn't been all by himself like that since my mom died."
"You can't even drop a few inches without breaking something. I have a ladder."
"Nothing at all like your dad, thank god," Claire muttered, pulling the bedroom door open to leave, only to find Melody raising her hand to knock, "What's up, sweetie?"
"It seems we have our answer, or at least my side of it. They've been good parents, and they love her dearly... Although I have to admit, every time I've picked her up, it's been hard to put her down." Cas said softly, "You know, I was thinking about it the other day, do you realize I've had more time to be part of Ben's childhood than I did Claire's? Xander, too."
"I don't 'mope and cling,' that's not something I would do."
Claire tied her robe in a flurry and pulled her hair out from the back of the collar as Alfie closed the door, "What's going on?"
"Yeah," Ivan nodded, "I blew it, I'll go get her, or help out, so I'm there, and then if there's time, I guess we'll go see the car. Unless you still want to look at newer ones?"
"Yeah, and you're gonna be alone in it if you don't stop being a bitch!" Julie snapped, and hurried upstairs with Cyndi on her  shoulder.
Claire kissed him firmly, softening as he silently reminded her that their intentions had been to go slow.
"What do we know about this kid, Shane? Aside from the fact that he wears shirts for groups and events he's never heard of?"
"Lauren is perfectly fine," Cas assured her, wandering past the treeline that commonly dictated the edge of the yard.
A large fake potted plant sat at the end of the walkway, adding balance as there was no window at that end, much ignored unless to dust the plastic leaves. She rustled through the false foliage and retrieved a compact fishing pole, untying its string from the railing, causing the large frame above him to tremble then jerk.
Julie smiled when she saw him, "Hey, Ivan. Here for the whole shop, or just you?"
"I suppose so."
"Well, that's nice."
Ben shrugged, "I figured I was going to get in trouble anyway, he might as well get what he deserved. And he said he was sorry on the bus home, so, he thought he had it coming, too."
"And you have stuff?"
Livid, Jack ended the call.
Claire shifted slightly as he pulled the blankets away, "More like, how much better am I doing, if Sam picking me up off the floor yesterday didn't freak me out? I mean, I didn't try to hit him, and I didn't chase after him, and he came in here today and, well, you know how he's always touching people, shoulders, pat on the back, or whatever, like, all the time?"
"Because your control-freak aunt decided to cut me off from the world, and that includes you. But you and mom did nothing to help me. You wanted me to tough it out, so I did. But I'm not some programmable robot, I can't live like that. So I found a workaround, a glitch in her system, and I exploited it. And I'm not about to say how, just in case somehow she manages to force me back into that room."
I know I said I was taking a break, but it's rolling out fast, so you get it early. )
"One second, that's it!" Margaret growled.
"Why not?"
Kevin glanced around the floor, "I said I would."
Cora didn't seem to register his words as she moved further back, a cry apparently setting itself up in her voice, "What did you do?"
"I'm not mad, I'm just out. I'm not talking to lawyers or cops, or going in for any hearings, I'm out. I am not involved. You can go sneak around and hire goons to do your bidding, have Cora owing you a favor, I don't care. This is not something I'm going to let you drag me into, and taking a stand is not childish," Claire answered firmly.
"There's my night owls," Alfie commented quietly, "Did everything go good today?"
Julie looked up, confused, "What do you mean?"
"It's not like we're the only ones here."
"That you and Mom had an abortion."
Sleep kept a heavy hold on Cas as he felt the bed move. He tried desperately to ignore the click of the lamp given the early hour, but soon rough hands were gently cradling his face.
"What I mean is, you're only nineteen, you've only had one baby, and you're not married. What if you get married later on and your husband wants children?" she asked.
With a hitch in her breath, she angrily wiped at intrusive tears as she set her glass down harshly before continuing.
"Absolutely. There are plenty of people in the world who would want to be friends with someone who is genuinely nice, rather than someone who's pretending to go along following some psychopath's cult. You can do better."
"Is that all you think about?" Cas groused.
Xander nodded, accepting it, "Well, as weird as my life has been, really, anywhere else, any other family, I would have stuck out, never would have been able to fit in... This bunch of oddballs, all of us... I'm really lucky to have wound up with you and Dad. And even with Claire out of the house before I got there, you'd never know it. I never felt like I wasn't family."
"He never saw it that way."
"As long as it's not right in my ear," Cas muttered, shifting Dean roughly to face away from him, and pulling Dean's back tight against his chest, planting a kiss against the back of Dean's neck as his hands found comfortable positions on Dean's chest and stomach, "This could work."
Suddenly the growling and moaning, the gasps and whimpers were replaced with a shaken pleading, "Don't! Dean, please! Not yet! I need it!"
"I will throw both my shoes at you!" Melody declared angrily with a scowl that seemed to take over her entire body.
"I don't have the stuff here for that." Kevin said, starting for Margaret's room before abruptly turning around and heading the other side of the house.
Claire's lip trembled, "Hold me."
Slowly rejoining at the end of the day, however, with the scent of a meal in the crock pot that Dean had set up during his lunch break, there was no doubt in any of their minds that the adjustments being made to their home life were good ones.
The room went quiet for a few seconds as Cora's tale had come to such a poignant end, and she reached for another tissue, still attempting damage control on the many layers of makeup.
"Something's wrong, and it's not about this, is it?" Alfie asked, "Are you worrying about the birth?"
Julie motioned to the door he was preventing her from leaving by, "Because she jumps in her car, and goes. And I don't know what to do anymore, except threaten to kick her out, and that's not happening. So, what? What do you expect me to do?"
"No. When she broke up with me, she just said she was done. Either she was lying, or she changed her mind and she's playing me. But Samandriel says I'm playing mind games with her."
"How literal is this lock and key thing? I mean, I saw the bars on the windows, but I thought those were decorative."
Claire took a deep breath and let it out slowly, "Okay... back up a little, what happened in the bushes?"
Dean clamped his mouth shut as Castiel settled between his legs, suddenly pouring a generous amount of lube over his stomach and groin.
Watching her carefully once more, understanding how precarious the position was, Alfie moved a little faster, still in a gentle motion, unwilling to cause Claire any discomfort, even as her breathing began to pick up in speed again, her hands roaming his chest, neck, shoulders and arms.
"That's not funny."
"Claire's not like that, though. Most of the time she's cool."
"Damn good thing you write better than you talk," Alfie chuckled.
"Something like that." Claire muttered as Dean picked up the length of her locks while standing to the side of her, knowing how much she hated having anyone behind her. He picked at the ends with the brush until he could work the brush in further up.
"I am, I'm completely helpless with you around."
Claire had passed off closing up to Randy and Blake and started across the short distance to the small house, surprised to see the rental gone.
"Oh. Yeah, I guess she would."
Kevin kept a quick pace getting back to the Labor and Delivery area of the hospital, only to find Dean in the waiting room. "Hey... Did they call you?"
Late in the morning, not long after Alfie had arrived to work at the desk, Ivan was looking for manual when Cas came in. He'd expected tension between Cas and Alfie, which didn't seem to occur.
Ben heard it when the door creaked open, but it wasn't unusual. After one particularly bad night a few years ago, a night filled with shed tears, blood, bandages, and promises to keep the thin line on Xander's wrist a secret from their parents, he would never even remotely suggest Xander wasn't welcome.
"How come you only get this goofy when you're out with Dean?"
"Like what?"
"Maybe I should stick to the easier games for a bit while I get back to it." Xander answered, clearly unhappy, "Sorry I broke the controller."
"Just got in her face?" Dean asked gently, "I know he's acting weird, but, you break that down to that one piece, sounds like me before coffee, so..."
"There's one more thing, um... Kevin said that Will... um..."
With a hint of irritation, Cas dug the keys from his pocket, "Fine, but you're not leaving this room."
He tried, he really did, to use the same words and motions he'd seen Claire use every Wednesday last semester, when he'd been on lunch room duty at the same time she was volunteering. By now, all the children should be used to it, it should be routine, but the miniaturized crowd wasn't having it today.
"Yeah, but I'm getting tired of her shit... I think I'll get a hotel this time."
Dean waited until she was looking directly at him before he answered, "Because you can't prove something happened when it didn't. So when I had calmed down a bit, and my brother pointed this out, he would just keep coming back if we gave him anything. It's better to let this run the course, show that Cas didn't do anything, and that Trey lied. Then his name is clear, and it won't come up again."
Alfie was groggily chewing on a toaster pastry, half awake, when Kevin was suddenly tearing through the house.
"Yeah." Ben replied, getting up.
"Take them off." Castiel repeated, impatiently. "Or do you prefer I do that for you?"
Thanks for reading! FW)
"So do you do this with mannequins?"
"No, just faking to see your face." Margaret growled sarcastically, her hand clenching in his shirt.
"Trey's got a plan for something that's gonna be awesome. He said he's gonna give you another chance." Jack said quietly.
"That young woman needs to-, needs to watch her mouth! I have connections at the Better Business Bureau, and I-"
"Claire-"
"Of course. It's a Bruce Springsteen song."
Sam sputtered, still trying to reach for him, but now Ben was laughing, "I got you that time!"
"Do I wanna know?" Claire asked, looking up from her laptop and pulling an earbud free.
"It's kind of weird that our dads are dating, right?"
"She's not answering?"
"Cora and Chance would stay covered under Xander, that won't be a concern," Claire responded, turning her head to check on Jaime through the glass of the back door where the boy was attempting to cross the top of the monkey bars by walking across the top of them, "As it is, Ben is actually covered by Millie, since we have better coverage than what the vet's office carries."
Alfie nodded.  "Okay."
Cas seemed to think it over briefly, "
"Don't say flexible. Not right now. I'm not doing this. And maybe you're right, maybe you do know how far I'd go for you, but if you don't respect me for that, then what the hell am I doing here? Why am I with you?" Tears welled in Caitlin's eyes as her loss for words became apparent, but Ben shook his head, "Scares the hell out of you, right? That's why you keep making all these conditions and rules, and pushing me away, dragging me back, it's outside of your control, so you hate it, at least that part. Love makes people stupid, and that drives you crazy, doesn't it?"
"I don't know if you're bossy enough to be a good landlord," Dean answered, making for the kitchen, and finding Xander and Cora speaking quietly to avoid being heard. Both of them carried a sour expression. As he got closer, he could make out bits and pieces.
Claire drank deeply and rubbed at her face. She moved to set the glass down, only to find his propped phone next to the lamp, her own face staring back at her.
"I'm sorry, Dean," Castiel said sarcastically, "Maybe I should just start acting on your requests, would that make things clearer? Although I doubt we'd have enough room in the back seat of my car for both of us and the box of pizza. You also misjudged the length of my feathers."
"It's fine, but, um, Xander, I gotta talk to Ben about school, how about you go see about setting the table?" Dean asked, offering him a hand up from the floor.
"Yes, ma'am," Claire answered, with feigned obedience, "I'd hate to have anything happen to them."
"Did you ever tell me not to?"
As Alfie came outside with another soda, Cas waved him over to a more isolated part of the yard. Alfie followed after him with a glance toward Ivan, "What's up?"
Dean had barely set them on the counter by the stove when he heard quick, light footsteps dance up the steps of the front porch, followed by an obscenely loud pounding on the front door. Making his way to answer it, he'd assumed Claire had somehow gotten word, and was on the warpath, ready wield her pregnancy hormones like a bazooka in scorching earth, or was simply desperate to comfort her father.
Claire nodded, "So you thought you were going to come up behind me and I was going to turn around and kiss you?"
Claire rolled her eyes, "Yeah, okay."
"I don't get it. And I've been really clear, I'd follow her around wherever, but it's like she's trying to be the absolute best at what she wants to do, and she's not okay with me not doing the same. Veterinary school isn't enough, 'is it the best one? Can you specialize in something only point-oh-three percent of the population can do?' God... Not enough to specialize in dealing with her crazy crap, I swear... Might be zero percent of the population pretty soon."
There was no ashtray on the work surface anymore. Cas was certain Ellen had had something to do with it, even if he had replaced his mysteriously crushed pack of cigarettes, and returned to storing them in the smaller house.
Crowley had been by during the time leading up to the trip when Alfie and Claire had taken the children to visit Rachel in Paris, during which time, he'd had a long conversation with both Melody and Jaime regarding manners and pretending, and how the two were often used together. The entire thing had struck her as ludicrous, but the rules of the game, as he had explained it, had stuck with her.
"Don't."
At the sound of the front door closing downstairs, Claire closed the folder and shoved it hurriedly back into the box, swinging the door closed, and leaving the closet.
Janelle bit short a laugh, "You're still a kid. And it doesn't tickle."
Inside the warm space, where Millie had been baking, likely testing her equipment and the layout of the kitchen, Millie's uncle was red faced and snapping at her as Alfie came through the door.
Ivan nodded, trying to consider what she was saying, conflicted because he knew Julie would be looking for him soon, "So, I'm supposed to meet up with somebody, is there a better time to talk about this?"
Ivan looked back and forth between Dean and Alfie for a moment before Dean went for his office muttering about his son, and Alfie retrieved the wrench he'd tossed, and got back to work.
Dean nodded, "Only saying what I'm thinking."
"I still think we should start small, let me drive your car sometime." he said, sitting down.
Claire nodded, "Okay, then how about you just pretend, and add an extra ten years, okay? He's thirty, I'm twenty-nine, and you have school in the morning."
Cas looked over his shoulder at the door, "I thought I heard Alfie. Did he drop in?"
He didn't fuss as Claire set a full plate before him and gave him a quick kiss as she left the room to get on with her day, a day he knew would see him at least mostly useless. He predicted correctly that Jaime, whose emotional tendencies often took after his own, would be particularly clingy, seeing as the boy had not even attempted to sleep in his own bed the night before.
He was plenty respectful, he was sure, as disjointed thoughts and emotions began to cloud his mind. He pushed his anger down, and echoed something he'd heard a high schooler say at the comic book store, something he'd found witty and insightful with a touch of badass, "I respect my betters, not my elders."
Next to Dean's car, almost close enough to block the door, sat a dark purple Jaguar.
Dean stepped closer to the back of the couch and tapped her shoulder. "Hey..."
"I'm just... lost my footing, and I'm not-" Cas swallowed heavily, appearing disoriented as Alfie noticed tears in the older man's eyes. Cas opened his mouth to speak again, and out poured a stream of words Alfie could not possibly recognize, with no sign of stopping.
"Because he already read it a bunch of times, and I was done with mine... Doesn't mean we're friends."
Claire shrugged, "Oh, well... Maybe next time you can teach Naomi to act like you, dress like you, and she can impersonate you and handle things her way. She'd love that."
The Oldsmobile, less one car seat, which had been left with Ben, swung up to the curb as the three men arranged the suitcase and carry-ons in the trunk before piling in, Alfie climbing into the passenger seat and greeting Claire with a kiss.
"All set?" Jack asked, tightening the tarp over the load in the back of Xander's truck.
"The kids are fine, your dads totally have this, relax," Kevin replied, "I mean, you-... Well... Hold up, we really only have just Dean, and just Ben to go on, huh?"
"So, Houston...? How was the party?"
"You're supposed to get it later anyway."
"Claire was just about to say how she met Bobby-"
"You broke my boyfriend, dad! God, he is the quietest, nicest person in the whole world and you know that, so why the hell did you do that? You guys were fine the other day at dinner, what happened?"
"Yeah... Where is she?" Claire asked, starting to let go. Cas, however, wasn't having it, and tightened his arms.
"Well, he said he's seeing some girl named Margaret, so I guess he's over me. But if you want, I'll let Dean know so things don't get weird."
"Yeah." Alfie said, nodding slowly. "I thought that might be the case."
"But whatever I do, someday I'm gonna fuck it all up! My baby is gonna hate me."
Knowing Ben was taking the bus, and would be home soon, Cas went straight to the garage, where the makeshift hutch had been set up. Ben had followed the veterinarian's every instruction to the letter, but Cas was getting home early every day to check on it, first.
"Rough to start, but still slow... I want to know what you're capable of."
Alfie shrugged, unwilling to consider it, then lead the way to the living room, "So what's going on? How's life, lately?"
Alfie had been sitting about a foot away for several minutes, in silence.
"I didn't."
"Are you taking care to make sure you're not spreading yourself too thin? Considering what Melody's going through right now, land deeds seem like something that could wait."
While Dean had arranged for Cas to accompany him in meeting Sam, Ben, and Xander at the bar, Cas, who'd been slipping further into his funk, had decided he'd rather spend his evening with Claire and Alfie. His excuse had been that while it would doubtless be no quieter than a bar, not where Melody and Jaime were concerned, he knew he was welcome, and wouldn't have to police his every move.
"Yeah, I'll trade you," Millie replied, setting her purse down and hurrying off as Ben went for the kitchen, only to stop half way to the bathroom, "Wait... What do I tell her?"
"Two more days." Dean said quietly.
He'd left the bathroom light on, and she could see the bruising on his nose and mouth swelling and changing color, "I messed up your face again."
"He won't be out long, you can wait in the garage for him, stay out of the way, and don't help unless somebody asks you to." Claire answered his unasked question.
The minimal and false conversation fell to an uncomfortable lull, and Ben decided to jump in with a question that had been weighing on him for some time.
Ben nodded.
"I guess you have a lot of faith in her," Henry said softly, turning to glance out the window.
As the car door shut behind her, Claire could feel a trace of Dean’s blood on her knuckles as she leaned at an angle into the seat back, watching the commotion. She specifically watched her mother.
"Not the dumbest idea I've heard today, just needs some tweaking," Ben mused, pulling into the driveway, "What if we eminent-domain Pops' office? Set her up in there?"
Cas nodded, then his expression changed, "Five...?"
"No, that was issued by the hospital. Kind of hard to fake." Alfie said quietly.
"So give her space. Mind your own business. Try to talk to other girls until your next crush shows up, and start fresh."
"That must have been horrible."
"Shhh."
Her chest felt tight, and breathing became more difficult as she approached her locker, but as she was stowing her back pack, she felt something strike the side of her boot. Looking down, she found two very rough halves of what had been a red apple before it had hit her boot.
Even in the dark, he could see that Castiel's features fell slightly, "I've made this awkward. I'm sorry, I thought-"
"Okay, just checking... So, we have time to think it out."
"I don't have any right to be angry, as I wasn't the one with a weapon aimed at my head."
Alfie nodded, "Yeah, we'll try to set up for a sitter, or something."
He knew it had reached about sixty-five degrees that afternoon, but even so, argued, "No. No way, no, it's February, you're supposed to be hibernating, or-"
Cas looked up, and for a moment Dean couldn't tell if he was amused or horrified. "I'd be lying if I said that didn't sound like a good idea."
"Damn."
Linda nodded, "Okay... You realize that, having told me this, that means we're now both accessories to murder, after the fact, right?"
"Yeah," Donovan answered quickly, "Sure... Wait, he's not going to kick my butt if we're hanging out?"
"I regret that stuff with Bobby."
"And these concerns, are they a problem right now?"
Dinner was going fine.
"Were you going to faint?" Ben asked, "Because that would have been funny. You get scared of the possum, the possum gets scared of you, and you both faint. That would go viral."
"Yeah," Dean answered, "We still have work to do, anything we can get done out here keeps us from getting too far behind."
"That's beautiful, Julie," he replied, trying very hard not to yawn as his eyelids were quickly growing heavy.
"'Is she okay?' I'm the one bleeding, here... She's fine, but she's getting locked up for bit." Dean replied, dabbing at his nose with a wadded paper towel he carried, "Listen, close up, then I need you to take care of the dog for me, I have to go into town with Cas in case he can get this done today, but it's getting late."
He tucked a throw pillow under her head to replace his thigh before leaning closer to her and singing her a quiet lullaby, which seemed to have no effect. Standing up from the couch, though, she didn't stir to follow him, a sure sign she'd be asleep shortly.
"Yeah, me too. I'll see you at home... I love you."
"Both of them. Donovan's a nice boy, and she could mop the floor with him. Wallace is gonna give Jabba the Hutt competition on bad attitude and hygiene, and his mom is enabling that shit. She brought him in to order his birthday cake a couple months back, eyeing Millie up and down, and she just took an attitude about the uniform instead of setting her boy straight. Damn near threw her out."
"Yeah?" Dean called over his shoulder, stowing the straps on the back of the truck that had kept the parts in place.
"...A toy helicopter?"
"Well, c'mon, I think I've got a jug of two-percent in here someplace," Gabe replied, leading them through the house to modest kitchen, "I'm sure if these are any good, you're gonna get some extra brownie points with Santa this year."
"Little wedding, big party? If we're going to do a big party anyway, we could just rent out a hall or something. Have a minister come out for it." Dean suggested.
"Yeah, you sound like you're fine," Alfie responded sarcastically as he started for the kitchen to get her some ice.
"Hey, man, don't. Okay? You... you weren't exactly someone who's really that close to start with, you know? It wouldn't be fair to expect you to dump everything and come running. And if you did, you probably would have just been underfoot. Me and Ben needed some time, and we got that."
"See," Ivan explained gently, "I was asking about the number you have tattooed on your wrist, I wasn't sure if it was a lucky number, a limit for you, some kind of superstition, but every single doubt I had, you just put to rest. Not with what you just said, but how you said it."
(A/N: Omg, coarse language!
Dean shrugged, "Nope, just dropping this off, and the nurse saw my name in your file and wanted me to come in here, said something was wrong?"
"Okay, starts with everybody takes a drink, right?" Sam asked.
"Yeah," Ben answered, sitting back in his chair.
Uri spoke slowly, with intent, "Your son just implied Cas Novak has a nipple ring."
He got up and followed her as she went to his bedroom doorway, stepping inside and waiting for him.
He nodded automatically, despite the fact that Ben wouldn't see it, "Uh, yeah. I can do that. I guess I'll tell Cora. Or, is that cool?"
"Or what?" Chaz snarled.
Still flustered, Claire pointed between them both, speaking clearly into the phone, "
"I'll ask Claire about it. If we can work it into the budget, yeah. Did you have a certain amount in mind?"
Her attention wandered to a large black and white portrait on the wall, a beautiful piece that she'd been happy to help with at the time. Mike had been a newborn, and after some back and forth planning, Alfie had arranged it.
Alfie shrugged, looking increasingly uncomfortable, "Well, she cares about how she looks, and when she's giving to charity, she looks benevolent. I mean, it's good there's a new hospital going up in South America somewhere, but it's a joke compared to how much she spends on shoes."
Margaret's seething looked dropped, leaving only a look of understanding and vindicated assumptions.
Alfie sat down in the same spot as before, but this time Claire turned her back and leaned on the table, similar to how she usually did to the desk at the shop. "Have you ever been to the abandoned airport on County Road 40?"
Alfie pointed vaguely in the direction of the hallway.
Claire was updating a file at the front desk when a middle-aged man came in.
"What... What do I do?"
"Okay, first, rude. Secondly... Why can't you handle it?" Claire asked.
"I know." Julie sounded as though she didn't believe it.
Unfortunately, the pajamas she'd put on were a set he found particularly adorable, not that he'd ever brought it up. Fluffy white bottoms covered in brightly-colored teddy bears, which were incredibly soft to the touch, as he knew from experience, and a thin white top that fit over her breasts like a second skin.
At the sound of the front door shutting loudly, she moved into the hallway, and was surprised to hear Kevin's voice.
"I'm not playing it, I'm sending Dean a text. Calm down!" Cas answered, giving up at his attempt to type when Claire didn't let go of his wrist, instead hitting the call button. He set the phone to speaker, and placed it on his knee as he shifted to sit cross-legged, and put his other hand over hers as a gesture of comfort.
Jess followed him in. It was cheerful and warm, with a large window looking down toward the shop, a wood floor, and toys that were mostly put away.
"You didn't, though. And even if you had raised your voice or something, you would have apologized and he'd be okay."
"I have to admit, I'm a little scared what I might find when I get over there... I'm not sure I should have come over at all."
"Hey, Xander, don't be a wimp." Trey called up.
"We're at the fall fest, he was helping Ivan with equipment. If he left to walk the two blocks back to the house where Margaret's at, he was supposed to come tell me first, so I know he's still in the park."
"Ivan, you're really nice to me, but, if this is just, like, some stupid kind of revenge thing, then, I don't want to be involved."
Xander drew himself up to his full height, broad shoulders back, an intimidating stance he'd picked up from Dean, "Stop me when I'm wrong! But no, actually, I have always wanted to know, and I can't really ask anyone else your motive on this, so I'm almost glad you're here, why her? I mean, why would you put her through that? Why let somebody force himself on her? Wouldn't it have been easier to spread your own legs, you fucking monster? I mean, did he just have a thing for children, or were you already just that dried up and ugly by that time?"
Cas opened his door, "How did we get to this from Bobby's car?... Anyway, you have your answer, I'm not seeing him, we're friends."
Cas looked discouraged as he tried to piece his words together, but Dean cut him off.
"This morning. Bay three. I guess about ten-fifteenish."
"Not exactly-" Dr Thompson started.
Dean looked up and immediately noticed the screen. "What is... Is that Claire?"
Cas looked around. He couldn't be sure, but it had to be at least close. It was a painful memory to look back on, as he had pulled Claire toward the house, completely oblivious to the fear she'd had to be feeling, the devastation in her eyes, soaked and shaking. She'd swung the tire iron at him with everything she had, and Dean had stepped in, likely saving him from a broken jaw.
Alfie got up from the bed carefully to avoid spilling the plethora of items pulled from the minibar, "Knock yourself out, I'll buy another one."
Dean jumped out of his chair, went behind Cas' seat at the end of the table, and hauled Alfie off of Kevin. Kevin started to protest in his best lisp, but Dean had already planted Alfie back into his seat.
"What am I supposed to think when you get home this late?"
Starting down the hallway, Dean doubled back as he heard the front door close, significantly more attitude on his face.
Cas spread his hands helplessly and turned to Alfie.
"Bob the Builder? Dude, you're a big kid, you can get one with real paper," Jack replied, choosing one from a higher shelf that had the same characters, and passed it to his nephew, "How about this one? Or do you have this one already?"
"No!" Dean barked, "Not happening. Cas, I can't, okay? I'm strictly monogamous... What about you?"
"Maybe not," Donna answered, moving to take the chair beside Charlie, "We don't really know what's going on, only that there's talk."
"Why am I a mechanic? Because I like cars."
But Claire had made a request of them, one last responsibility before they would be able to grieve, and Xander seemed hell bent on getting it done. With knowing care, Ben guided Claire aside to step past her in the small space and hurried after Xander. Part of him wanted to accompany Xander, protect him from what could only be waiting for them upstairs, but at the same time, dread filled him. He couldn't stop himself from climbing the stairs, however, not so long as Xander and Cas were both ahead of him.
"No, don't argue with me. And since she's mine, too, I'm stepping in, here. Just give me a day."
"My mom has a fetus and every time she goes to throw up Jaime thinks it died, and she's gonna puke it out."
He had his fingers crossed that Julie would be in a good mood, she hadn't said much, and he hadn't been able to have a conversation with her yet.
If he was being honest with himself, not all of his irritation with her was healthy. Yes, she was a drug-addled monster whose actions had caused his child untold suffering, but apart from that righteous fury, there was also a layer of petty indignation.
Heat building throughout his body, he whimpered as she suddenly pulled away. She pulled the condom off him, starting to reach for the box. "Your turn."
Mike shook his head, "I don't want to get kicked out of school over this."
Cas was quickly divested of what was left of his clothing before Dean dragged him onto the bed, pressing him down onto his back and trying to settle himself on Cas' still unlubed cock before falling forward onto his chest with a burst of humor, "That didn't work."
"She doesn't want me there, either. Or the kids. She wants a private conversation with you."
Crowley noted her presence as he tucked a dark, ornate wooden case under his arm and closed the car door, "Melody! You've gotten taller. Are you taller than me, now?"
"I didn't want to let this wait any longer. You know damn well I'm not perfect, and this isn't a habit for me. I screwed up, and I'm sorry."
Gabe nodded, "Okay, listen, you do not want to piss this guy off, so you better run this whole thing by me."
"That kind of makes me wonder what they say about me," Claire admitted, rounding the front of the car as Cora got inside.
"Because most guys are bigger than most girls, and have more upper body mass, making it an unfair fight." Ben parroted.
Sunday afternoon, bored already, and with too much upheaval to properly process the fun that was supposed to be winter break and the fast approaching holiday, Ben logged into his school message board to see what his friends were doing. Or at least, that was what he told himself.
"Go for what?"
"Worse than a caveman in a dress?" Claire asked with a chuckle.
Alfie chuckled and continued to work on his shading, as Cas turned his attention to Claire. "Anything new while I was gone?"
A shadow crossed Dean's face quickly, but in an attempt to hide it, he shrugged, "They're all related by adoption, not that that matters. They know family is more than that."
"She would never even think it... She's really sweet, you'll love her. Melody's getting big, we're thinking about getting a dog when she's a little older." Alfie said quietly. It half an attempt to inform his mother of their lives, half talking to himself.
"Yes, sir." Randy replied, heading back for the garage.
"Emotional?" Cas offered.
"Did you wet your bed and leave your wet clothes in the bathroom instead of waking me up?" she asked.
Claire waved him in, silently inviting him to sit down, and in quiet observation he noticed she was uncomfortably rubbing the side of her swelling belly.
Kevin shrugged, "We wouldn't have had that problem at the beach."
Ben looked up when he heard the zipper on Jack's backpack as he opened it, retrieving a Superman comic Ben had passed up, and hadn't been able to find again.
The look of disgust on Haven's face soon turned to one of concern, "Why? What is he gonna do?"
Claire scooted closer, resting her chin on her hand, feeling the worry in his voice, "What happened, exactly?"
Cas scoffed, "Dean, go to sleep. You can deal with your parental guilt in the morning, with a clear head."
Cas shook his head, "A lot more than that."
"No, but we have dog bottles." Ben replied, "Dad says she won't need them for very long. A coyote got her mom, and the rest of the babies."
"Two days." Claire answered, trying to keep her breathing under control.
"You look beautiful, y'know. In case I was too distracted to say so earlier." Alfie said softly as he started the engine, "Very distracting..."
Cas took a deep breath, "If he was likely to try driving drunk, he'd be home right now. Jack offered to let him sleep it off at his house, so he has a safe haven close by. He hasn't had an easy time socially, and this isn't exactly a habit for him... I think we should wait, let him bolster his reputation, and sort him out when he gets home."
Hannah, seated on the other side of the very large desk with her usual half-smile nodded politely, "I'm listening, Cas. But let me remind you, I don't owe you any favors."
"Like me, he's a single father, and we hang out sometimes. I know what she said sounded alarming, but, I was there, I've gotten to know him, he understood what she was saying before I did, and did what he could to help."
Dean nudged Cas' shoulder with his own in a soft bump, "Hey... Don't worry about it, okay? I'm gonna get you a nice glider swing, nothing to install, and we'll have something to cuddle up on."
"Dad," Claire asked, getting back to her own chair with a hint of a wobble as Alfie took another drink, "Are you trying to get him drunk?"
Millie sighed deeply, "Look, I know you're freaked out, but it keeps happening because we're both cool with it, and we're cool with it because we are cool with each other. And we never actually officially broke up in high school, we just drifted apart, so either break up with me for real, and stop meeting up with me for lunch, asking me to hit the bookstore with you, and cooking me dinner, and it won't lead to this anymore... Or, y'know, grow a pair and get honest with yourself."
Claire seemed somewhat shaky, and looked as tired as he felt. Through their chats and occasional calls, he knew a bit about her, the subjects she hated in school, her distaste for the color pink, and how her cat had died a year before, but it was nothing compared to sitting across a table from her and hearing her voice in person. Seeing the dark circles under her eyes, and the worry that kept her quiet.
Ben shrugged, his arm obviously constrained, "Because at this rate, I'd have to saw off my hand, so, no. I'm staying right here. But she'd probably let go if you want me to fix you a sandwich. Do you want one?"
Her skin was a sickly color, and she was noticeably weak, as Sam had described.
"Yeah, well, he started with enough attitude for both of them. Good to see things evened out. Kind of funny, though, the way he was about Claire working at the shop, now he's got two little girls at home."
"FUCKYOUTHAT'SHOWCLOSETHEYARE!" Claire yelled before settling her head against Kevin's shoulder again, "Fucking Margaret ditched me."
Ben stole a glance at Cas' face as Cora passed him to go into the house, and found what looked to be a contented smile before his expression became far more serious, "Dean-"
"Nothing at all?" Lucius raised his eyebrows, "Are you sure?"
"I need some water," Claire said, ignoring his rambling.
"No," Dean replied, coming up the front steps, glancing back over his shoulder to see if Cas needed any help, "She was scared. Probably had no idea it was me. We talked about that, remember?"
Alfie grinned and continued to work. The noise was loud enough to drown out the talking in the office, but he was sure Claire could handle it.
"Right... Okay, staying put. Just saying, kick me out any time you want." Kevin said, looking around at the various charts on the walls.
Alfie had told him that Cas had beaten the snot out of some guy who'd picked a fight with him, but when asked about the reason for it, would only say that it wasn't important.
"Why?" Gabe suggested, "I'll tell you later."
"Okay. Fine. So, now what? Because there's no room in this house for a baby."
"Dad, just answer me!"
"No, I do. You always tell me more than I want to know."
"Why not? Margaret liked working there. She said she only left to get the shelter under control because she could take him with her, she wanted to come back, now she's knee-deep in high turnover and doesn't think she can leave without the whole thing caving... He'd be better off working at the shop, probably safer than what Kevin's gone and got himself into."
"Yeah, but I don't think that counts."
"I don't give a shit who's running the place, because with just a couple of phone calls, I can get the entire thing shut down. So, no more kids in the goddamn junkyard!"
"Because," Cas paused, struggling with years of hate for the gray-faced, dying woman before him, "Because Claire needed to know that you wouldn't be alone."
"No. Give me the beauty school classes."
"No, but maybe they taught Uncle Ben to do that," Jaime suggested.
"Do you think she's all right?" Cas asked at a similar volume.
"That'd be too far away from the baby. I mean, that's really early, I might be nursing."
Claire took a deep breath, "I haven't even been able to talk to her about this."
"Is that right?" it was less of a question, and more of an obvious reply.
"Dean?" Cas asked, his body still as Dean composed himself.
Uncertain he was actually awake, Alfie set his head against the edge of the door as Lauren slipped past his knee, "What...?"
"How sure are you that they're actually your grandchildren?" Naomi asked, raising the window and pulling into an empty spot in the driveway outside of the large house near the end of the road.
"Yes," she began, as though his presence and assistance were expected, "My friend Helen Lawrence had her car repaired here, she told me she got a very good deal, and I want the same service."
"Nope."
"Without me."
Nodding, and with nothing left to add, Xander left quietly.
"Because I know more than I care to regarding her mama, and some things you just can't forgive. Now I'm going to go spend my day with an old friend, talk him toward a healthier option that's suddenly the only one available to him, and you're gonna get that set up from your end when you have time, and this whole thing stays between us. If anybody wants to know, I was asking you about how he's getting on."
The doctor nodded, "Round ligament pain can come and go, but watch it in case it's something more serious. As long as it matches the description on the usual pregnancy websites and isn't too severe, nothing to worry about. Your weight looks good, food stays down okay? No signs of hyperemesis?"
Claire shook her head, "Kip came to the shop today. He had a gun pointed right at Dean's face."
"Yeah, well, we'll do it. Don't worry," he reassured her.
"Well, we can't clean it up now," Aiden answered, "I'm not about to sneak around with you idiots and a can of paint thinner. And anyway, the store's closed."
Cas was clearly still feeling guilty as he watched through the window as Jaime pitched his backpack over the low white fence and proceed to scramble over it rather than go around, "I don't understand, he drinks soda with caffeine in it, and this doesn't happen. And it's done some mildly hyperactive children a lot of good."
Margaret nodded, "Yeah, just when I start getting used to it, the kicks get harder."
Dean stepped into the small space and looked around, "I don't know, he doesn't have that much, not once you consider how much he keeps in his dresser. He might be able to use the space better if we leave the ones on this side, and take out the ones over here..."
"That's...um..."
"And we're still getting nowhere with the wedding planning... Not even sure she'd go."
Kevin's attention shot back to Alfie with a questioning look, "I told you to quit dangling her, I said she was going to get hurt."
He felt the twinges of guilt increase in frequency as he got closer, and they came from several sources. His haircut had been an excuse, of course, to speak to Kevin, but having seen himself and finding his reflection more recognizable, it had made it easier to put on the trappings of what he now felt to be his former life, and make the much avoided visit.
"Okay," Claire said quietly, in a leading tone, waiting for him to explain.
"But she'll be pissed at you."
Rachel was admonishing Naomi for something, Dean wasn't sure what, but wasn't allowing her sister a breath to answer, and had backed her toward the door, causing her to step backward and stumble slightly as she bumped into Dean, who caught Naomi carefully by the back of her ribs. He spotted Melody, in the midst of it all, holding a cookie tin and for once in her life, weeping openly, and decided in the few seconds of whatever he'd walked in on, he'd had enough.
"Oh, hell no. My lips are sealed. About you, about him, forget it. I can neither confirm nor deny anything about you two," Jack replied, noting that the song had ended, and offered his elbow to escort her off the dance floor.
Melody looked up quickly, meeting her eyes, but turned them to her father, "Daddy, am I in trouble?"
Curious, Dean attempted to catch a glimpse of it, but his hint of suspicion eased as a stream of slick fluid fell over him, and a second, smaller bottle was added to the window sill, the cap carefully closed while Cas' hands were suddenly all over him, making him jump. Deep breathing settled him, almost, before Cas' own hard, thick flesh was added to the mix, making Dean's erection twitch roughly.
"So you don't want to be like my step-dad." Claire said quietly, "Since I'm not a kid, and not exactly planning on sticking around, I meant to be out by now. If things went right, we never would have even been living in the house at the same time... I get it. It's okay, you know. Hell, if I got out of your way sooner, maybe you and dad wouldn't have taken so long to move in together."
"Well the old ads for places I've been getting told aren't empty any more usually ask for two hundred a month."
"I got it."
Dean took the tiny bottle he'd fixed the night before from the fridge and started the hot water running in the sink, sloshing the bottle to stir it as it warmed quickly to room temperature. It wasn't quick enough for Nick, though, and she continually struggled toward it until he shut the water off and put the bottle to her mouth.
"I always had it in my head that she was horrible to you, for some reason," Claire said softly, "Seems like we knew two different versions of her."
With the tiniest bit of pity, Kevin allowed him some antique Gameboy before taking the power cables from each item in the entertainment center, especially the television, and locked them all away in the home office with other various devices, laptops, tablets, and an iPod Margaret had almost forgotten she had. Kevin had made a joke about old modems and picking up a rotary phone.
Ben shrugged, "I have no idea what's going on in there. But I'm going to get Mel out of the frosting, and Emma just wants you, she won't talk to me."
Wondering if it was her own actions or Ivan overreacting to them that had painted her as such a wrathful person. Nothing seemed to line up, lately, every misunderstanding snowballing into a larger argument. But what was painfully clear was that when she left things alone, when she caved to everyone else's whims and moods, when she put herself last, everything was peaceful. And it killed her to do it. She had come to the conclusion some time back that it was not her place to bend over backward to keep everyone else happy, but the blame that settled on her for raising the voice of reason and responsibility still hurt.
Dean twisted the knob to turn off the spigot, "No, go ahead, I'm all ears."
"That is what he's having difficulty with." Cas replied.
"And your girlfriend's not going?"
The first time, he chalked it up to getting to know the neighbors, or perhaps boredom. He took no action, and he didn't bother to mention it, but he did notice.
Eyeing the brushes, Ben was happy to run back to the shop for his father's permission to help paint.
"Got that right," Kevin grumbled, awkwardly adjusting to fit Henry's hand to a small soaking bowl.
"That her kid was doing homework with a friend at the bakery? I told her, but it wasn't exactly a big deal. At least, not until that woman came into the shop, screaming about Mel today."
"And Mel's not going to stay twelve forever. Eventually she's going to wind up-"
"Claire, I don't think she's bulimic. She's not the type."
"But it's different, right? I mean, you didn't plan on owning a shop, it just kind of fell on you."
Dean backtracked a few steps, planting a quick, clumsy kiss, "Shower, and then we're going. Promise."
"Hm?"
Seeing Ben's name on her phone's screen before the ringtone began, however, she decided she'd given up enough time to playing nice for her husband's sake, and started for the next room, "I'm sorry, I have to take this."
"I love you, I mean that, and I just shouldn't have left your side. If I'd stayed with you the whole time, or if you didn't go, nothing would have happened."
"How long has this been gong on?" the nurse asked, turning to Melody where she sat slouching on the exam table, but also shooting a questioning glance toward Cas.
Kevin chuckled, "My girlfriend is the only one who gets access to my ass, actually."
Claire passed her drink to Alfie, sitting next to her, and followed Ben over to the giant inflatable jousting ring, kicking off her shoes.
"Okay, uh, I pick Claire. Claire, I know I'm not around you as much, but, from what I've heard from Ben, um, and Dean, you're a great kid, and I think it's great that Dean's finally getting a daughter, and I'm gonna be proud to be your uncle."
"Um... No?" Alfie replied with a chuckle.
Cas shook his head, "I don't ask much of you-"
(A/N: TRIGGER WARNING!!! - Pregnancy loss. Nothing more graphic than emotion.
With slight scrambling and clamoring, they both got out, and Melody gave Donovan a very quick hug on the sidewalk before getting into the front seat, saying her goodbyes. Alfie waited until Donovan was safely inside the front door before he began to pull away from the curb.
"Yeah." Dean replied.
"What's wrong? Because if he's sick, I can't be bringing it home."
"He won't."
With something of a growl, Claire snapped, "Because if you scramble your brain on the way out of high school, and need a guardian as an adult, who do you think has to look out for you after our parents are dead? Me and Ben. And if that's your plan, numb the pain by killing a few more brain cells, it's not just you that you're hurting. Not when you could stop right now and be a functional adult."
Claire walked into the office of the high school, and pulled a stack of paper from her backpack.
"What was the one good time?"
"Was this going on before you got surprised the other night?" Alfie asked quietly, shooting a glance over his shoulder at the open bedroom door to be sure Jaime had gone to his room.
Ivan sat down in a relatively clear space on the floor, "Sure. You've got every right to do that, we'll call you whatever you want. But you know why that recording existed in the first place. I wasn't home to sing to you and your sister every night, and I didn't want you to go without."
"Because while I was getting it done, he made a comment about them making good attachment points for a car battery... He'd already taken things too far a few times, I just hadn't been ready to end it yet, but that sealed the deal. So I pretended to wimp out, and left it at one."
Dean narrowed his eyes, "You know it's not fair to use the kids against me, right?"
"So, what about being, like, a bad influence, or whatever?"
"No, no, it's cool, weird hours. What's going on?" he asked.
"Hey, it's scary, I get it. But you're safe, okay?... You want room service for breakfast, or do you want to go out someplace? I can have something up here by the time you're out of the shower."
"But it's perfectly fine, it drove all the way out here," Mr Peters objected, "Except for the headlight, all the damage is cosmetic."
The car door closed with a snap behind him as Alfie sat down in the passenger seat of the Chevelle, having used it for the drive, leaving the sedan at home with Claire. Claire was just happy to be behind the wheel of her finely tuned mechanical extension once again. She almost missed the look on his face.
work keeps you entertained! We ought to lock you both in a basement on LAN for a week, you'd come out with a security system too advanced to run on modern electronics," Cas mused, "You're a very intelligent child, Mike, but you're also an idiot."
"Like, Ivan had a few girlfriends, but he was only ever serious about your mom. And the fact that you were along for the ride, he knew he had to figure out what he was doing, decide exactly how much effort he was willing to put in, because he knew it was going to be much more complicated. So I told him to go talk to Cas, because he'd gone through some hard parenting choices when Claire was a baby. I wasn't there for that, but I know what Cas went through, and a few months later, you were calling him 'dad.' Have you ever asked him about what his family was like?"
Claire's face froze in horror, but Alfie didn't notice it at all as he had turned in his seat, "You can't speak to my wife like that."
Cas shrugged slightly, "In all fairness, when we met, and for a long time afterward, you were doing your level best to be unlikable."
"No more than I'm pissed at myself. Don't worry."
Julie reached over quickly and hit the power button on the car stereo as she pulled into the parking lot at the day care.
"Long-exposure. I made this app myself... Think you can keep from blinking for thirty seconds?" Alfie asked as she got back into the car, double checking that her skirt was out of the way before she shut the door.
"Okay, what have we got?" Dean asked as Lucas took a seat at the keyboard.
"Why?"
"Yeah," she answered, rolling to her side to press herself up from the bed to sit on the edge of it, "What's up?"
Dean put his phone back in his pocket, "Your mother showed up. Your dad wants you gone. They can't force him to hand you over if you're not here. If they make him trace your phone, you won't have it on you."
"You love it." Margaret smirked.
"Fine... What do rainbow daisies mean? Sorry for waking me up?"
"What happened to your face, Stansfield?"
Half-turning to face Xander, the man caught hold of the shoulder of her coveralls and gave her a small shake, at which point Xander noticed Claire's face had gone pale, "Yeah? Or what?"
"Let's make sure we're clear on this, Cas, nobody makes Claire do anything... And that's probably for the best, considering the shit that happened with her mom. She made her decision, and I didn't have time to come up with a better way to keep her safe! Now you've gotta get your shit together and get her home." Dean answered fiercely, "She seemed to think you could do that, so... what? Talk to the judge again? Call a lawyer?"
"Get out," Alfie growled.
"Not doing anything right now, though?"
Alfie shook his head slightly, and replied, "J'ai des manières, la classe, et une grosse bite."
"Where are you now?" he asked, stepping off the porch, onto the grass.
"Ben," Dean called after him as he made a beeline for the back door.
He'd managed to get off the phone before his emotions completely took over.
From below a small Ford, Lucas began to scramble to his feet, ready to head to the office, but Dean was already crossing the garage, and waved him off, "I got it. What's going on?"
"Does she say that?"
"You can wait in the car." Margaret replied in a grumpy tone.
"That can't be it."
Claire started to shake her head, but Alfie sat up straighter and reached for her hand.
Ben looked back down the path between the cars where Dean had been. Dean had a sneaking feeling he knew exactly why.
"I remember."
Mike eyed the black box with the buttons in the center of the table, "Just ask the questions, okay? I'm fine."
"I'm not going to be okay with being a widower when Cora hears that," Kevin answered automatically.
"Um..." Alfie attempted to reply regarding the alcohol, but instead changed the subject, "How are you feeling apart from that?"
"But then it stops being your fault," Alfie objected as Kevin started to pass him the baby.
Cas pulled Dean into a snug embrace, kissing him softly.
A crackling came through the speakers as the light of the manual dial came to life for the first time in a very long time. Cas let his hands drop to the rough plywood he had set across two saw horses Bobby had crafted for more practical uses decades before, taking in the faint glow, barely noticeable in the shade of the few trees. Further away, there was some commotion in the garage of the shop, followed by some swearing, but he paid it no mind.
"You know she doesn't want to be relying on you for everything. There's a bunch of empty space here, it's not like it's a big deal." Alfie replied.
"Some of us never grow out of that." Cas replied.
"That's really rare."
Jess was speechless.
"Well, if you need a whole barn for your rock collection, then, yeah. I gotta see that," Millie teased.
"I can run to the store if we need cookie dough ice cream, handle this properly." Kevin offered.
