Sherlock licked his slightly-swollen lips and cleared his throat. “John, you know I could not have done all this without you. I could not have defeated the
When the conversation peters out, John shifts closer and briefly presses his lips to Sherlock’s.
A click made John’s gaze dart to the side. A tall figure waited, a gun in his hand. John sighed and released the man. This was not worth being shot over; John had now had enough experience with bullet wounds and their effects for a lifetime.
Sherlock chuckled softly. “You’d say that anyway.”
“Who?” he asked. But then, he spotted James Sholto, leaning against the foremast, a bottle in his hand. His face was downcast.
Sherlock nodded back. “It’s only been about nineteen months since he was convicted.”
“I'm fine!” Sherlock barked back.
She laughs merrily. “I know what you meant.” Then, her eyes flash between him and the still-hiding Sherlock. “So… are you two… on a
To Sherlock, Ekene’s fingers shaped what John suspected was a question, from the way his eyebrows raised. His hands moved too quickly for John to follow, however.
“Twice, but only for conventions. Never for a book tour on my own. And this’ll be at… well, the Strand, this massive independent bookstore.”
“Still, you were fairly adamant I should have said something to someone,” Sherlock glared.
He almost stopped walking as he fully parsed his own words. John would have to wait? Had he really just thought that?
Sherlock shook his head. “No.”
They fell silent again. Finally, there was a noise, like Watson shifting in his chair. “Why did you get so upset anyway? I thought you didn't care what people think.”
“I’ve been thinking,” he announced.
Carrying their steaming drinks with caution, John navigated back from the kitchen to their blanket kingdom and paused to gaze down at his boyfriend.
"Well..." Sherlock trailed off then heaved a sigh. "Fine, maybe not entirely."
John thought.
Sherlock blinked, then smiled at him, a look that sent warmth straight through John’s entire soaked body. “I can’t believe it’s you.”
John’s lips tightened as he wiped at the dried blood on his arm. “It is not. But I do know these people, so trust me when I say that they are… good people. Honourable.”
John lets out a bark of laughter. Then, in a burst of energy like the shattering of a nucleus, he
Has he truly won John’s heart?
“But the
As three deck hands untied the prisoner and began to lead him away, John saw Sebastian and Sherlock exchange a dark look, laced with utter loathing on both sides.
Oh, God, he was getting to him. Sebastian was in his head now, sowing paranoia.
With somewhat jerking motions, the crew pulled John and the man upward, toward the deck. As they reached the railing, John seized it and helped his crew lug them over. Several pairs of hands reached out to steady John and lower the still-unconscious man to the deck.
I bought this ship partially made. A shipbuilder in Ireland was destitute, desperate. We had enough pilfered coin and goods to fund the rest of the construction. She is small, only needs a crew of twenty or so. However, I have organized it so if needed, it can be run with only a handful.”
Would they truly be able to surprise a ship that had defeated so many and caused so much pain and death? Or was this just a foolish, suicidal plan?
“I don’t need saving,” Sherlock growled. They regarded each other, the sounds of the waves against the boat serving as the only symphony to accompany their heartbeats. John could not read Sherlock’s expression. He only knew he could not let Sherlock be harmed. Not after everything the pirate had done for him, not after years of missing him.
“Thanks,” he mutters, joining Sherlock on the sofa and giving him a slightly crooked, utterly charming smile. “So. What did you want to talk about?”
John automatically raises his hand to his face, where indeed there is a small smear of sauce. He laughs, and Sherlock joins in, even as he shoves his hands in his pockets, twirls back around, and continues on.
with any clarity, let alone the Dutch ship. He swiped an arm across his face in a futile attempt to improve his sight. “You cannot leave them to die!”
By the time Molly reached the top of the stairs, she felt humiliatingly winded. Lucky for her, the corridor was deserted so no one witnessed her laboured inhales. Four flights of stairs should not be so taxing, and yet…
John does laugh this time, throwing his head back. “Oh, bloody hell, you’ve picked up your disdain for Hemingway from Kitty and Regan, haven’t you?”
“Fine,” she smiled. “I was just hoping you’d take a look at my draft…”
ship the one that is sinking?”
“I’m not a sailor,” John said. Then, with Moriarty mesmerized, gaze fixed on him, his brown eyes shining in the light of the fires surrounding them, John moved. He lifted his own sword, pulled from the flames and now red-hot, and pressed the blade to the wound in his stomach. Steam rose, and he yelled as it burned and burned at his skin.
John chuckled and brushed Sherlock’s curls back again, thumb brushing the scar he was studiously attempting not to think about. “Feeling better?”
“He would look good in a Bond suit,” Greg said without thinking.
Sherlock kissed him, those shapely lips seeming to fit unnaturally well against John’s. “Likewise, John.”
“I didn’t know that! I saw none on board-”
“Oh,” John says, and realization blooms on his face. He rests his forehead against Sherlock’s chest. “You’re going to laugh at me.”
“Of course. If you have any further questions, or want me to look at another draft, you know where to find me. And don't worry - I know your paper will be just fine. Don't stress.”
John felt a wash of savage pleasure as the sound, even as the
“I lied,” Sherlock murmured, trying not to move against the cool metal.
She and Ekene exchanged a glance. The three of them formed a triangle, Ekene leaning against the mast, Irene perched on a barrel, and John standing.
“It was all well and good, with you, for a while,” Moriarty nodded. “But only because you were so stupid. So blind to the truth right in front of your nose. Quite entertaining for me, but it did get old after a few years. So when I left, claiming to be working for the East India Company, I assumed I would never hear from you again. How could you and your idiot brother ever get anywhere near my father’s operation?”
“So?” John shifts closer, just an inch or two. “That doesn’t mean everything I’ve seen of you has been a lie, like you implied earlier.”
He stood atop a low hill overlooking a shore and the ocean beyond. From this vantage point he could see far away toward the horizon, where the first golden-pink streaks of the sunrise were appearing. Few clouds marred the colorful scene. The waves of the incoming tide swept toward the shore in forlorn, rhythmic crashes.
John looked at him with cynical amusement. "I hardly think his overdose falls exclusively in my hands. If he was telling the truth, that's kind of a double standard. Seems there were similar events on your watch. "
Rat’s eyes narrowed and he stood up like he’d lost his senses, “Grady Pauly, you never could shoot a wee cock with a great canon!”
Mary stood and put her arm around him. “We’ll see to him.  It is just a seizure.  Looks worse than it probably is.  You have the stewardess get us some more blankets and something…well…he may vomit.  Save the carpet?”
"I am not displeased that you were not afraid and that you found this experience less controlled. Perhaps you are more stimulated by men than you ever admitted."
She would watch the flames dance and feel the pain of all those pointless dreams. But because of Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, she would watch her heart burn in silence. She would stand in the hot coals and see that she had only loved a monster. As all fires cool, so would her anger. She was practical. She'd find some way to blame herself, until one day; she would only consider Sherlock Holmes to be a hard lesson learned.
“Okay. Go on.” John said his index finger at his lip, rubbing nervously.
John's eyes narrowed and he tilts his head searching the slate-coloured unfeeling eyes in the darkness. "Why is it any concern of yours?"
It was joked that the Holmes family had been behind the crown since England had been an outpost of Rome. There were four families who were called the magic behind the majesty. There is a legend that says when the ravens leave the tower of London, England would fall. There are actual captive birds who people think her majesty has discourse with for advice. It is a silly fairytale much beloved by the tourists and touted as fact.
"Sherlock. Oh God, don't go crazy in the… the dark." She grasp for the button that will again light up the phone screen. Molly can't seem to find the correct button and worries that it is dead.
She leaned in and kissed him, slowly and sweetly. He closed his eyes and kissed her back. He sighed with annoyance when he heard the click of her phone taking a picture.
"Not like you deserve. Not like he deserved. I left him there, on the floor. I slipped away, and I kissed him...but he didn't know. I hurt everything that cares for me. I always have. I ruin everyone. It's what I do. I took you and I made you a liar, and a sneaky, cunning thing full of desperation and deceit. "
His eyes blazed and he grinned at her expectantly. His rapid movement stopped once he shrugged his rumpled blazer on. "You should stop caring about me. Caring was never an advantage. I don't know if you can out fox my brother for long. It doesn't matter. It's the price of betraying me. This place, he's never found it. It gives you a sporting chance. I leave you to whatever fate you make for yourself."
“You promised me. You promised you would not leave me on purpose again.  That it was a one off…the drugs…you said it was only for the case.  You promised me, Sherlock, and now…this.” John admonished as gently as he could.
Sherlock Holmes jumped off a fucking building to save him and it took him this long to question that he may have not been quite as selfish of a bastard as the person he saved had thought.
Mycroft sat and contemplated these connections, feeling like he'd been personally betrayed by those who had vetted her. But, this had all taken place years before, so there had been no glaring connections to follow up. James would not risk his kingdom for many years and there was no reason to suspect Sherlock would be able to pull himself out of the rubbish he'd made of his life at that time. Molly was actually one of the few people who seemed to be willing to give Sherlock any kindness.
By the time he answered Sherlock’s call, something inside John had begun to die. His chair, the perfume, and Sherlock’s first words in the hospital were swirling in his average brain with increasing speed. His heart screamed that he had to be wrong as the phone made its connections and he refused to believe the ones he was making.
It was an advertisement for a person of exemplarily credentials to share a flat. It was in this very building. He stared at it for a moment. He looked skyward and wondered if it could be the player of a certain violin. He smiled. He had no intent of agreeing to the arrangements, but it might be a chance to meet the artist. He hoped that this violin belonged to a tall man who's eyes changed color with ethereal light, all their own.
"Which brings us to the subject of Sebastian Moran." John says slowly.
[Know what? Whoever you are, just tell MH that this is my note. He will understand.]
“Chocolate and whiskey is amazeballs.”
“Who now?”  John kept moving trying to pin down who was making them a target.
Mycroft had attempted to exert his own polite torture techniques. He let it be known that forcing Sherlock to escape for each visit was just his attempt to keep his brother entertained but he did warn John that he would not be allowed such leeway.
Rat shook his head, “Took a music stand to the face, bled out.  Operation Fubar. We need to poof!”
“Perhaps I don’t want your help? Why would I?”
Molly shook her head even though he couldn't see her. "That's not true. The first time we met, you told me everyone hated you. You wouldn't have admitted that if you hadn't noticed it. You wouldn't have noticed it if it didn't bother you. I loved you. All these years later, I still do. Until you met John and Miss Adler, I wasn't sure you could love. But that didn't matter. You were still worth loving."
John went to the kitchen to make tea, but did not refrain from actively eavesdropping.
John scrabbled around disoriented and groggy. He leapt to his feet when he saw the violin case was gone. He flung open the door and screamed, "Sherlock? Sherlock?" He took off into the rain and ran less than a block before he realized he has no hope of finding him. He stands there at the end of the mews, looking up and down the street, and his shoulders slumped. The picture of dejection, John doesn't know what to do with himself. He just stood there in the rain and closed his eyes.
"Then walk me through it, because I am at a loss. You have managed all this time. What occurred today that made this the moment you picked to stop existing?"
It was the first time she had ever seen him absolutely alive. “Jesus, you just saved my life. That is extraordinary. Where did you learn to handle one of these…like that?”
“Oh dear. On the bright side, you got a pretty good run out of it? One of the nurses propositioned me, by the way, four times. Sponge baths were unbearable. Thanks for that,” He teased wiping her tears away with a clean spot on his dressing gown sleeve.
“You actually sounded jealous just now.  Never noticed it before.  It’s weird.”
He was about to shout it to whoever was watching him, when he was interrupted by the low sound of a buzzer that infiltrated even his own soundproof quarters.
Sherlock looked toward the tower. He smiled. Time.
"Finding it true so quickly?"
“You will not tell her what transpired here tonight. You will pretend you did not read the flash drive and you will destroy it as a token of faith. It will save you the whole Christmas shopping business by giving her what she needs the most.” Sherlock stared at John, his eyes confident he was right and hating every word. At last he saw John give way and he nodded with sad encouragement.
Molly holds her arms out, blindly waiting in the choking darkness. She can smell something tainted with some fluid that belongs to motorcars and something that may be petrol, but she can't see anything and the only noise comes from him. She assumes he is fumbling for light and patiently waits in place trying to force her eyes to adjust by blinking rapidly which is as useful as hitting the button to the lift when it is already lit up. She can't see anything and has no idea how he's negotiating around in this total lack of luminance. It reminded her of a cave.
[11:13 – That request isn't strictly up to me at this time is it? I am disappointed. I will advise you on his behalf should there be one, but we shall speak of sailing wax and string later. ]
A few seconds later a familiar accent rang across the rooftop.    “Your frekin who again?”
"And the thus the contrary truth. He's capable. But, he's not willing. It seems thinking Moriarty would be the death of my brother caused me to overlook the actual force that would bring about his demise. All the bullies and bad-guys, drug dealers and psychotic stalkers outsourced by one small doctor." Mycroft's eyebrows rose and he twirled his umbrella dramatically as he turned and without another word, left John's room.
One of them laughed and knelt beside John, a blade in his hand. “You won’t be having a chance, mate.  Shoulda’ just forked out a few quid.  We still nicked that, but now you die soon as we quit finding your ass worth the trouble of holding you down.  You just meat now, old man.  Another word and I start with your tongue.”
Molly tries to understand her loss
John followed  without comment.  “About what?  The whole thing blew up in our face, we have no idea what happened and we are now getting shot at for no apparent reason, typical day at the office?”
“Is he?”
Mycroft looked down at the bleeding damaged man at his feet. That was unexpected.
The meddlers came and went and he knew nothing of their comings and goings.  Exhaustion had finally claimed his mind and Sherlock estimated he’d been asleep for at least thirty-six hours when something gently touched his cheek.  He opened his eyes to find John standing over him.
John knew he wasn't a jumper-wearing broken charity case in Rat's eyes. He was skilled and still vital to Rat or he wouldn't be here. It felt good to be himself and feel the rush of war again. There was no need for Rat to have concern that John Watson felt this was a sacrifice.
The brilliant searing sun and his sidekick the cool quiet moon.
-umentary all about you and Sherlock, solving crimes, tragic lovers, dead before your time. Blah, Blah, Blah. It was quite moving," he says, purposefully crossing his eyes to convey that it was probably ghastly and sentimental twaddle.
"I am sorry, Doctor.  The patient is fine.    You however have some items at the nurses station. I just was trying to determine the best way to wake you gently.  You are military like my, Da, so thought it best to just let my presence find your soldier radar...rather than ...well...waking me Da was a bit of a punt, sir."
Greg returned with two cups of tea and pressed one into her hands. Molly sipped it, looking out the window and watching the rain, worried about him being out in this, alone. It is silly of course, he won't care at this point, but the thought still tugs at her heart. Her eyes close and she remembered how just a few hours ago he was on his knees, warm and almost happy, and how she had ruined it all. "He asked me. And I told him yes, but that he would change his mind. He promised. The last memory had to be spectacular. It was. It was lovely. Not how I expected. Still. It was. If I had known…" she sips her tea.
"Not to my knowledge."
Just like old times. Like when you faked your death. Oh Sherlock, I am such a fool. You will get bored and I will lose you. You think just because we have given in to need, all is forgiven. John didn't sleep at all. He watched the sun rise, turning Sherlock's skin a golden-orange. He watched him breath, then quietly he slipped out of bed.
"Really? Care to test my word? Testing my word is why we're here, I believe. I do hope you remember that I don't just have access to this room, Sherlock. There is an entire Palace for me to play in now. Your palace. And you can only stop me by sending me away. This time, you have to try harder. I'm in your head. I will
The man tilted his head and slipped his hands in his back pocket. "What do you learn from that?"
The entire vista was absurdly picturesque, but something about standing on solid ground rather than a ship embittered such a view. How he longed to be back out there…
By the time the diplomas are being distributed, Mrs. Holmes is sniffling next to him. She takes John’s hand for a moment, and he squeezes back. When Sherlock’s name is called, and he crosses the stage to receive the diploma and handshakes, John himself feels his eyes getting wet. He surreptitiously brushes the tears away, and applauds louder than anyone.
Sherlock shook his head. “It
Sherlock couldn't stop his probably absurd smile as John took his hand again and they started off away from campus. "I, um." Great, he was still stammering. He held up his phone as John looked up at him. "I found a place to go for lunch."
Wait.
John laughs. “Not a fan of horror, I take it?”
“I still lied to you,” Sherlock conceded. If John could be brave and say these things, Sherlock could admit this.
“I…” Sherlock has to clear his throat and swallow before his voice can come out not croaky. “I was thinking we could go to my flat. It’s not far from here.”
“And you are certain? There is nothing more you know to do?” Sherlock was asking, low and intense.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Oh, fine.”
The fire was unstoppable now, climbing the masts and spreading all across the deck. Red and orange light flickered across John’s face. He felt the near-scalding heat creep along his skin, and he knew he had to escape.
“Is that what my father said to you? When I was in the other room with Mum?”
And then a huge something slammed into them both, from the side. And then, perhaps by some miracle, Sebastian’s weight and the knife were both gone. And then Sherlock could open his mouth and
“Sherlock?” Victor’s entire bearing changed. He sat up on his elbows, a smile creasing his handsome face. “I lost track of him years ago.” He smirked. “How did he befriend a Navy man?”
“Don’t patronize me,” John cried. “In spite of what you might think, I am not a fool. Which is why I am telling you this is foolish. We can find some other way to defeat them, that does not involve you risking your life!”
Victor stammered the same explanation he had given John, though his voice wavered and his body swayed. Instead of listening, though, John found himself examining Sherlock. He looked strong, healthy, and just as beautiful and handsome as ever. Though he seemed a bit thinner, his muscles were just as well-defined as ever beneath his brilliant seafoam-green shirt and dark-as-night trousers. He wore his usual black boots, but had added a striking blue headscarf across his forehead.
“This is about more than mere theft, Irene. As you know, I have never been a mere pirate.”
Sherlock nodded, definitely blushing now and keeping his eyes off John.
John didn’t think he knew the answer.
A second later, he grimaces. Honestly. What mawkish nonsense.
“Oh, I think you’ll be surprised, Sebastian,” Irene called, eliciting cries of assent or challenge from the spectators.
“Well, I had considered asking you to be our ship doctor before she came to me with her decision. I can hardly turn her away, she’s a friend, so I was unsure what to do with you.” Sherlock shifted his position and made a show of adjusting their course.
“My outline,” John grins, charmed.
Remembering earlier with the green chair, Sherlock takes his turn in pulling out John’s chair for him.
Rosie grew. Her hair tumbled to her shoulders in golden waves. Her hands reached for everything but mostly for her fathers’ hands.
“You can’t expect us to-” another began, but John lifted a hand to silence him.
Sherlock looked up at him, a slight crease between his brows. John resisted the urge to kiss it. “But I thought… Sholto…?”
He climbed out of bed, movements only a little clumsy despite his weakness. John followed, curious. On Sherlock’s desk, which John had only spared a cursory glance the night before, was the scattered detritus of genius. There were diagrams and maps, more detailed than John had ever seen, that he suspected were drawn by Sherlock himself. Another pile of papers were titled
. He could not explain it, and perhaps it was all in his head, but he had a strange inkling something was not right. They had missed something, overlooked a key fact, in making this impassioned plan. Driven by grief and revenge, they all had failed to notice one specific factor. John only wished he knew what it was, but for now something in his gut told him they had to act, had to get to Sherlock before something terrible happened to him.
“This isn’t his fault,” Lestrade pressed, expression hard.
“It should pass soon,” Sherlock says after checking the weather app on his phone. John detects a slight tinge of disappointment in his tone, and is glad for it.
He staggered when his feet connected with the deck, and he landed on hands and knees, gasping and coughing. He recovered quickly and turned.
“Mummy, please,” Sherlock groans, making a valiant but fruitless effort to extricate himself. “Don’t be so sentimental.”
Sherlock sighed. “The Programme betrayed my father. They turned over the reports to his noble friends, claiming
did, I just..."
“Yeah…” Winter’s eyes drifted closed.
On one hand, there were stolen kisses, private giggles, and soft words whenever he and Sherlock could steal a moment. There were smiles meant just for one another, toiling side by side, and the crew’s affectionate jokes about the two of them while they were on deck. Everyone seemed to know of their altered relationship, and no one seemed surprised. John ate with the crew, talking most with Irene and Ekene and Wiggins, and found himself content. He fulfilled Winter’s and Sebastian’s duties with Ekene, and enjoyed them more than he had expected. Overall, things aboard the
She had sent him a link, accompanied by a smile that, despite being composed of nothing more than a colon and parenthesis, still managed to look cheeky somehow. He hesitated before clicking on the link. In the brief time he had known Janine, he had grown accustomed to being startled by her boldness. That aspect of her personality should not have continued to be a shock, as the first conversation they had ever had consisted of a rather explicit description of her alibi for her neighbour’s murder—she had been sleeping with the flat’s
“Hi,” Sherlock said, suddenly breathless. Maybe he was here to make up, as Sherlock so wanted to do.
let its dark grey sails unfurl in the cold wind. It caught a favorable breeze as it angled toward the open sea and its next journey.
“I love you.”
John just shook his head, grinning. “No, it’s alright.”
Or… did John want to move in with Sherlock somewhere? Was it too early to think about that kind of thing?
Though try as he might to concentrate on the formulas and experiment notes before him, he could not deny how rapidly his heart was pounding.
“India, actually.” Sherlock’s cheeks were pinker now, which John took to be a good sign. “She was training to be a doctor there where she lived with a lover, named Tom, until it ended badly. We ran into one another and I offered her passage. She may be our doctor only temporarily, but we are glad to have her.” He cleared his throat, blushing harder. “So… You've changed,” he noted with raised eyebrows.
Sherlock chuckles. “Yes, you are.”
But the rest of Sebastian’s retort was drowned by a sickening sound and a gasp. The fall of his sword had smashed Winter’s downwards, which set her off balance and caused her to stumble toward him. With her thus vulnerable, Sebastian had brought his sword around again, and stabbed straight into her side.
“I should probably mention,” he calls to John, “I think I got ketchup on your cheek during that kiss.”
“I know. But you are the one whose ship was destroyed.”
John’s lips press to the top of Sherlock’s head. “You’re welcome.”
Sherlock smirks and sets the laptop on the table, then leans back against the sofa cushions. “I like it.”
, its black sails filled with wind, its red sails still rolled up. As the pirates watched, it slid away, eventually melding with the dark skies and disappearing.
“Quite possible, yes,” Mycroft nodded. “However, as I have no other means by which to convince you, you will have to trust that my knowledge comes from the very man whom we are discussing. And that I am who I say I am.”
John groaned in embarrassment as the other two had burst into more laughter. Sholto had signed an affirmative for Ekene, who also chuckled.
“Alcohol,” she replied. “The crew wasn’t too happy at first that I used some of it for this, but once I explained, they’ve taken to setting at least a bottle aside. It’s maybe a bit silly, but it seems to help.”
"What happened?" Greg pressed, leaning forward. The men around looked over, all listening. "On the pirate ship."
“Where… where am I?” he croaked.
“Mm, yes.” But Sherlock doesn’t move.
“I’m sorry he made you uncomfortable,” he says when Sherlock finishes. “I’ve never interacted with him much, but what I know of him…” He trails off with a grimace.
“Yes.” Sebastian seized Sherlock’s arm and yanked him back to standing. “You’re coming with me.”
That afternoon, John practically dragged Sherlock to Regent's Park and sat him down on the bench, chewing on his lip. Sherlock watched, a sudden chill going through him. Was something wrong?
“Several minutes at least. Major case just landed on his desk, so to speak. He’s being filled in now by the Chief Superintendent, I expect. Still, you’d better watch the door.”
Dark spatters adorn your skin
They remained curled up on the floor for several minutes, catching their breath. Finally, John rolled off Sherlock to the side, but Sherlock immediately pulled him in to his side.
The next morning, John enters the seating area of the graduation venue, where he spots Mycroft right away. He waves John over, and John gulps.
“I don’t want to break up with you either,” he said, breathless. “I… I want to fix this. I should have told you about Sebastian, and I’m sorry about that, but I was scared and didn’t know what to do. And you left me alone, and that hurt, but I still… I still want you.” It all flooded out in a rush, leaving his chest heaving and his heart aching.
“Good,” Sherlock felt his smile shift into something smug. “So what’s my double prize?”
“I am,” Sherlock said. “And it seems you are fortunate to be here as well.”
John spent a fitful night and day in the infirmary. His wound opened up again, several hours after Sherlock Holmes departed, and from then on, John could not keep himself fully awake. He drifted in and out of wakefulness for ages, dim awareness of people moving around him, poking and prodding and doing who knew what else to his injury. It was uncomfortable, but he supposed he should be grateful they had not sent him into the brig or tied him down. Most likely, this was because they were in the middle of the ocean; there was nowhere for him to go, after all. Yes, that would be why.
“I’ve been thinking about you for months, Sherlock Holmes. How you and your freakish meddling ruined me. If you hadn’t pried, I wouldn’t have had to come to your flat, you wouldn’t have got me arrested. You have any idea what prison is like? What it does to you? What it teaches you about people and yourself? I learned there, Holmes, that people are terrible. Every single one.
“He,” of course, referring to Sherlock.
“That all, Captain?” the man, Ekene, then asked in a rough voice with a glance and small nod at John. His brown eyes were almost golden in the sunlight, full of a quiet intensity.
“See you.”
as he had struggled with Sebastian, shaking all over and pulling at his captor and crying out in pain.
“We’re friends, that is all. Perhaps if I had not met you first, I’d have…” John cleared his throat. “But you’re rather diverting.”
She nodded, the crease still present in her brow. “So he just collapsed suddenly?”
“What?” John asked.
“Winter,” he breathed. His harsh expression melted in an instant as he crossed the deck in three strides and dropped to his knees beside the girl. His hand found hers and held it to his lips. “Winter, it’s alright. Breathe.”
BOOM.
“Well then,” Mycroft murmured. “I fear I have disturbed your evening needlessly.”
He paused two ships away from the
John’s heart sinks. This is far from an ideal time to have this sort of fight, not when there is so much change before them — the graduation, the idea of moving in together, the upcoming Ellipsis Award…
The strange man straightened up and smoothed out his clothes. Posh, neat articles made of fine cloth, John noted. This was a man of means, and apparently was important enough to employ guards.
You tell me all about these diff’rent forms,
“You’re turning into one of us,” John says. “God help us all.”
Sherlock felt as if he couldn’t breathe. His heart pounded in his ears, a roaring noise that blocked out all other sound. He couldn’t shift his gaze from the spot where Sebastian had been standing, watching them. He did not understand how he had been so stupid, how he had just assumed Sebastian could not, would not, find out where he lived. The man had already done so once back in the first year of uni, after all. How had Sherlock been such an idiot?
make it rhyme. And… and about that last line, I don’t know what I was thinking. Well, I suppose I wasn’t thinking at all, but the point is, don’t take too much meaning from that…” He trails off and clears his throat self-consciously. He shouldn’t have shown John the poem; what a foolish decision.
“Oh, call me Margaret, please,” she says when she steps back. “Goodness knows, Sherlock talks about you enough on the phone, we may as well be on a first name basis. This is my husband, William.”
“I bet,” Irene leaned in. “Holmes cheated on him.”
“Yeah.”
BOOM.
The captain of the
“Got it!” She jerked a line, and the sails swelled with wind. The
He turned, but had only managed a half dozen steps before Sherlock’s hand was grasping his good arm and spinning him back around. Once again, those intense eyes found John’s.
has any knowledge of how to have a relationship!”
“Right,” John said. “But what can we do about it? We can’t exactly…”
“Who are you?” One of the men, John could not see who, demanded of their rescuers.
He turned to find Sebastian stalking toward him. He scrambled to curl in on himself as the man who had caused such distress and pain bent down and looked at him.
“Why?” John asked, tilting his head up toward Sherlock. “What is special about this ship?”
“I have no intention of dying in this endeavor,” he whispered in a low rumble. “I intend to end this, once and for all.”
Ekene nodded and darted down to where he had spread his maps and tools on the main deck. Sholto, meanwhile, emerged topside again, having gone below to search one last time. The worried shake of his head told John the answer before he even asked his question.
Greg understood she was not referring to notes on the actual subject, but on Watson's behaviour. He nodded, and she and Mike departed.
“Are… are you and him…?” he stammered.
John pursed his lips and kissed the top of Sherlock’s head. “I could say the same to you, you know.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Not intensely.”
Sherlock takes it and scans it quickly. His eyes widen, and his mouth drops open in amazement.
Holmes chuckled. “Scandalous,” he said, sarcasm thick in his words. He came to a stop at the prow and turned to look at John, who claimed a place next to him, reluctant and nervous. But at the same time, he was intrigued. He had not gotten a good look at the pirate captain until now, and he found he could not keep his eyes from traveling over the man.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said shortly.
Up on deck, the crew of the
“John!” Sherlock snapped. “The
if I’m right about that text being from Holmes, then… yeah, they might have fought.”
John stiffened, the cup clattering to the floor. Blood rushed through his ears as, without warning, he was transported back.
Moments later, though, his icy eyes seemed to shutter and go emotionless. “That’s what you think of us,” he said in a low voice. “But you do not have the full story. You have no idea why we do what we do, why
“Hush, no one asked you, dear,” Margaret says with so much finality that Mycroft sits back in his seat, chagrined. John glances at Margaret, who winks at him.
“Pirates!” she yelled. Her voice carried only as well as John’s did, but the crew she addressed responded nonetheless. “Lay down arms!”
?” he asks after a few moments, trying to coax the man back into speech.
“I’m sure. He’s also attracted to you.”
Sherlock, who now has a book with a rather special title page:
“That’s what I thought!” Kitty nods. “And, like, they knew about me being published? That’s weird. It’s like they just go through all the lit journals in England and email whoever’s published in them. It just feels really underhanded.”
As expected, they both melt at the sight and assure him it’s perfectly fine, to take as long as he needs!
“Why even keep up the letters for so long?” Sherlock asked. He still was stiff, pressed back against the side of the ship. Mentally, he berated himself. He should have realized something was wrong, that Victor had explained away his having to fake his death too easily. Sherlock should have scented something off. He
He backed out of the room, shoulder bumping the doorframe as he retreated. Molly watched, amazed. She had never seen Holmes move so gracelessly, so unsure of himself.
“I’m going to renew my lease, I think.” John smiled, though the look of mild confusion remained. “It’s London living yeah, but I figure I can pay off any loans once I finish school and get a proper job. So I wouldn’t give it up. Besides, rent out here is much better than in the middle of the city for a poor student like me.
“I gave up two years ago.” He meets John’s gaze for a second before dropping it again. “I decided my brother was right — sentiment is a defect.”
“Someone has been murdered!” Sherlock snapped. “Did that realization penetrate their thick skulls?”
“No,” Sherlock’s cheeks return to their familiar pink state. “All I know about what you do is, well, writing books.”
“Alright, let me sail,” he scolded in a faux-severe tone. John chuckled and resumed his position behind Sherlock, again slinging his arms around him. They fell into a companionable silence for several minutes. On the main deck, most of the crew had started up a card game, sitting in a circle near the mizzenmast. That sight of his friends relaxed and laughing proved to John they were really, truly in the clear. The threat of the NOTP had been neutralized—without their leadership, they were helpless. A message from Mycroft had reported that, thanks to his own information and connections, the remaining operatives were under scrutiny by multiple governments. The East India Company, it seemed, was ecstatic. Mycroft was unsure how to feel about that, but he was assured that the world was a better place with only one trading programme in it.
He would not be useless.
They all hesitated, staring at John. None seemed eager to break off from the group. He nodded, and a deckhand broke away to sling one of Sholto’s arms over his own shoulders. Together, he and Molly helped him get below.
Winter in the Atlantic proved to be intense. More than one storm sent the
to cause harm.”
And it was rather familiar.
He would have to do research in the morning. Employment records of the carnival, criminal records, and perhaps even - if he could manage to hack into the right sites - reports from the prison. He supposed he could do it right now, but…
“Yeah,” John says. “I know.”
“Hi,” Sherlock breathed. He flinched at the sound of his voice, all hoarse and croaky. Speaking hurt a bit. Damn Sebastian…
John opened his mouth to retort, but Irene’s scream cut him off.
“Hot,” he manages, choking slightly. John tries not to laugh, but doesn’t succeed. Finally, Sherlock recovers after guzzling down half a glass of water. He blinks rapidly to stave off the wetness in his eyes.
“Water?” He raised his eyebrows. “Molly, we're still days from port. We need to ration it.”
Sherlock had inclined his head, eyes closing in response to the massage. "I'm fine."
Another silence passed. Molly stood, her belongings finally gathered in her arms. Then, just as she turned to leave, Holmes spoke once more.
“I know,” he said instead. “If I weren’t already pretty sure about them, I’d be way more convinced by that.”
John giggled at the petulant look on Sherlock’s face, and soon Sherlock’s put-out expression faded until they both were shaking with mirth. John felt buoyant, as if nothing could go wrong. Sherlock was here, in his arms, and they were alright.
“What can be done?”
“What?” John exclaimed, racing to Sherlock’s side. He pointed his own telescope toward Jakarta again, and Sherlock’s fingers guided it to the correct location. Indeed, the
Sherlock’s shoulders slump. Relieved. “Good. I… I’m glad you like it.”
And considering his books have brought this wonderful man into his life, he has no cause to feel badly about them. And if this wonderful man thinks him worthy, maybe he is.
Ekene piped up, fingers insistent. “And the Captain is a capable man. He will be fine.”
Sherlock stared down at the text, frowning. His thumbs flew across the screen as he composed a tentative reply.
Sherlock laughs, and steps close to take his hands. John hops about a bit more, twirling Sherlock with him, until they stumble into each other and end up in an embrace.
Greg found himself chuckling. “Irene, for someone who seems to deem it fit to remind us she's a lesbian every few minutes or so, you certainly bring up the hotness of the male professors a lot.”
John waved that away. “Did you even
“What?” John asks, looking down at his hands.
Sebastian glances at him, then shrugs. He seems to know he’s done the damage he wanted to, and now has ammunition for the time they have class together. “No need to be rude,” he says with a roll of his eyes. Without another word, he strolls out the door.
Finally, when the silence had lasted what felt like an age, John sighed. “Did you have something to tell me,
Molly arrived, a frown on her face. “What happened, Captain Watson?”
John pressed closer, arms moving around the pirate’s lithe body. Sherlock sighed with contentment and allowed John to roll him over. The changed angle shifted the tone of their embrace; Sherlock melted into the bed as John shifted atop him, kissing his neck.
“No!” John cried. “No, you-”
red-gold and grey —
When John had realized through the telescope that Sherlock was being keelhauled—the rope stretching into the ocean off the stern had revealed the terrible truth—he had nearly fallen over with fear. What a barbaric punishment. There had been no question in John’s mind that it was Sherlock at the end of that rope, Sherlock who was likely terrified if he was even conscious, Sherlock who was drowning and bleeding and dying.
He joined them in the kitchen, his two favourite people. Sherlock was already moving about the room, swinging Rosie out of his arms into her chair. She sat agreeably, watching with a rapt expression as Sherlock started preparing Rosie’s oatmeal while simultaneously putting the kettle on and whisking eggs for omelettes. She grinned at John when he pressed a good morning kiss to the top of her head.
He leaned down and captured Sherlock’s lips again, and pulled back to gaze at him.
“It’s alright, Watson,” she smiled. As she turned that look on Sebastian, however, it turned more snide. “If he wants another go, fine.”
*wink*
“I didn’t know that,” John breathed. He couldn’t deny that was adorable, though.
“Consider it a little repayment for the bag,” Sherlock pats it.
There was a long pause, and then the pirate sighed. “I ordered my crew to return after we gathered supplies-”
point yet,” he conceded, “but I doubt that if I met you for the first time now, I’d ever accuse you of being a machine, or heartless.”
“What the hell was-”
Irene only smirked and slung an arm around John’s waist. “Enjoying yourselves?”
rocked once more, and John felt the entire vessel tilt. The aft end rose high above the stern. The hull was breached. They were sinking.
Sherlock grins, reaching out to grasp John’s hands. “Surprising you, obviously.” His anxiety retreats, and the confident tone comes easily, for once, in response to John’s enthusiasm.
He was rolling the sixth barrel when he felt it. A slim, cool line of metal, pressed against the side of his neck.
And the scrutiny of Sherlock Holmes was far from unwelcome.
“Am I supposed to know what those words mean?”
“I’ve got a present for you,” John says, then groans as he tilts his head back to grant Sherlock better access to his throat.
"Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock!"
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, no,” John brushed a thumb across Sherlock's cheekbone. “Don't talk like that. This was not your doing. Besides, your life is not worth sacrificing for a ship. I know losing the

has to sail this ship, and I am loath to interrupt their merriment.” He gestured to the circle, still wrapped up in their card game. “But later…” Sherlock smiled. “Yes. That sounds… agreeable.”
Sherlock gazed up at him and squeezed his leg again. "It's not that he doesn't like you..."
But what was Sebastian planning? Were they perhaps empty threats? Sherlock had been tired, after all, and probably over-thinking everything about the situation last night. Sebastian couldn’t know where he was… He’d moved to Baker Street now, he was in all different classes. There was no way Sebastian could find him too easily.
“If only we hadn’t lost you in the first place, Lieutenant!” a loud sailor called over, having apparently listened to the conversation.
“Did I ever tell you about the time my friend pushed his girlfriend off the end of Brighton Pier?” John grins once they’re seated at the counter, sipping their piping hot drinks. He’s talkative today, though Sherlock fleetingly wonders at his motivation for such unconnected subjects. It’s as if he’s trying to suss something out. And yet Sherlock can’t quite deduce the reason.
“If you count an audience of two hundred and an hour long Q&A after the first presentation as successful, then yeah,” John smiles, though he feels a bit awkward as always when speaking about his own successes. He’s not one to talk about himself all the time, though he finds himself having to do so more than he’d like, especially when he has book signings and such.
Sherlock manages a smile, and John relaxes. He may not have solved Sherlock’s problems, but he doesn’t have to. He made him smile; that’s enough for now.
“Nevertheless,” he waved a hand, dismissive. “If I am to keep you-”
are you fixated on now?”
All their eyes shifted to John, who nodded. Grudgingly, they set down their weapons and moved together into a group. Sherlock’s crew dispersed, working to get the vessel moving once more. John spotted Wiggins shooting off to obey his captain’s command.
Happy hums echoing in my ears,
“Oh,” John says, and lets Sherlock drag him, giggling, toward the bedroom.
She departed, her ponytail swinging from side to side, and Greg drank down the last dregs of his own tea. The traffic in the university cafeteria was picking up again, as it was nearing time for an early dinner. He’d better leave soon, before the noise level grew to such a high decibel level that he could not hear his own thoughts.
kettle, did you?”
“Because I want you to, and besides you’ve not had fresh air all day.”
“Well, I was thinking…” John hesitates, realizing he hasn’t really planned what he was going to say. He’s only thought in the abstract, not the specific, about this conversation. “You know, we already spend pretty much all our nights together, and, er, the Jubilee Line’s handy from here, and—” He trails off, swallowing, his courage rather failing him. Why is this so hard? They love each other, they can cohabit without too much drama. Why is this so difficult to verbalize?
You yell at Father Christmas,
“Okay, enough,” Sherlock says, pulling away and sitting up straighter against the headboard. “I have reading to do. Away with you.”
“No,” John says. “I don’t think so.”
John gave a small nod, relieved. "Good. I'm glad we're agreed."
He has a rather pleasant chat with a pair of university students about his books and characters. They are kind and insightful and polite, the ideal fans. He gladly signs and personalizes their books, thinking they might be the best fans he will meet all day. However, after they finish their conversation with John and wander off to browse through the shelves, he hears a crash and several thumps.
On the floor next to the chair sat a baby monitor, though John could hear no noises from the other end, just a quiet hum. Rosie was sound asleep too, and John smiled as he imagined Sherlock putting her to bed — always so gentle and doting, in a way John had never believed Sherlock could be until Rosie happened.
“And insufferable, and interfering and generally a prat?” Sherlock nods. “Yes.”
Sherlock bit back a groan. “You let them take it to the morgue already? Why would you do that? You know I need-”
, John Watson, published author, a man Sherlock has for so long only known by his name on a printed page and yet a man who somehow managed to be better in real life.
John shakes his head. His fingers grasp the notebook and pull it toward him, handling it as if it’s breakable. “Don’t worry about that. These words are written by you, so… they’ll be beautiful.”
Victor’s mouth dropped open. John stared up at Sherlock, his hand stilling on the pirate’s arm. “
“Oh, how I love you, Sherlock Holmes,” he whispered against his mouth. “But I have to warn you. I believe you are in imminent danger.”
“Well, I was thinking you could look at my draft later. Just see what you think.”
She beamed wickedly. “Indeed, Captain Watson. A party. Specifically, a dance. It’s been ages since we had one, and besides, everyone’s restless lately. There’s only so long pirates can go without something to distract them.”
John purses his lips, but decides the debate about quitting is a discussion for another time. “What are you doing out here?”
“Nothing,” Sherlock says far too quickly. He crosses the room and drops down next to John, his arms crossed over his chest. His eyes keep flicking over to John’s face, though, which makes John start to suspect he is rather keen on the glasses.
, she thought.
“And to think we were both afraid we were going to break up,” he murmured.
“Have you.” John felt his fists tighten at his sides.
, three years since he had been with Sherlock.
“Because I’m an idiot, apparently.” He lays his head on the table. “And a predictable, unoriginal, boring writer.”
Quick PSA. This chapter is a little more graphic than the others in terms of violence. I’d still call it PG-13 however, so I’ve left the official rating as it is. I just wanted people to be aware.
, isn't it?" John's heart pounded in his chest, perhaps trying to hammer its way out so it could lodge in Sherlock's rib cage instead, where it belonged. Now that he considered all the angles of a marriage proposal, he just wasn’t sure if it was the best move. Luckily, Sherlock seemed to accept his role of talking John down.
“Nothing, just... “ he frowned as he tried to decide how best to broach this subject, especially so early in the morning. “I was wondering what I’m going to do next year, when we’re probably living in different places.”
“There you are!”
“And the actual bomb-defusing scene was excellent,” Sherlock adds. “From what I can tell, it was accurate.”
“You okay?” John asks, placing his foot over Sherlock’s again. He wants to take his hand, but is unsure if Sherlock would be comfortable with that. Then again, he had allowed it on their first date, so…
“Trevor, come on!”
It's the smile that makes Sherlock smile too.
The fabric was pitch black in color, and though it was raggedly torn in half and burned at the edges, John could still distinguish the distinct shapes upon it.
Sherlock hefts his bag and follows obediently, through the main entrance of the building and passing signs pointing toward the expo floor. Sherlock’s anticipation increases along with the volume of voices. John is in this building, and maybe when he sees him, Sherlock can get some answers.
“Oh, God yes.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “No need to apologize. The thought hadn’t occurred to me either, until… well.”
“What did they do?” John asked. He had shifted forward while listening to Sherlock, their knees now inches from one another’s.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, it’s fine.” He raised his head, grabbed John, and determinedly pressed their mouths together once more. Although still baffled, John kissed back.
He could feel eyes on him, even as he moved farther and farther from his ship, his home. Someone watched, and he did not have to look back to know who it was.
“At least for a while. I have a novel to finish reading, after all,” he says with a smirk and twinkling eyes.
He shook his thoughts off as he looked across the deck. Several of the pirates, bored from a lack of work, had paired off and dueling together. They moved with sure motions; it was clear they were well-trained at the sword. John watched with some envy.
“I know, I’m with you. But there’s nothing I can do. I’ve told them to hold off reopening this entrance for another half hour, so…” he gestured toward the bloodstains on the floor. “Get to it.”
“This will be fun,” he murmured. “Come on. Let me introduce you to my crew.”
He was tall, slender, and leaned against the wall, an eyebrow cocked. The light was too dim for John to get as sufficient a look at him as he desired, but he could see the man was pale with dark hair. The orange light from the lantern cast rather ominous shadows across his face, obscuring most of his features. His fingers were wrapped around the hilt of a gleaming sword, which he held unsheathed against his shoulder
She twirled a thin rapier in her hands, and John wondered how she could make such a move seem so lewd. Perhaps it was something in her expression, the way she could look so wicked, enticing, and playful all at once.
“-it’s not like Bart’s goes easy on me, just because I’m a-”
, he thought,
Sherlock leads him to Baker Street of all places. Ahead, John catches sight of a red awning belonging to a small café. As he and Sherlock pass by, John glances in the window and inhales the smell. Sandwiches, soup, pastries. Everything looks delicious, despite how full John is. He peers through the window with interest, but Sherlock does not even stop to look.
“How's Winter?”
“I’ve worked on several ships, sailor boy,” she said. “And I’ve never served under a captain like him. His crew trusts him.”
“Hey lovely,” the writer says, pulling Sherlock close to give him a light kiss on the cheek.
He shrugs again. “A bit.” Clearly a bit self-conscious, he turns his gaze to the closed laptop. “I did have a question about the housekeeper, you know.”
“Us,” he echoed. “Who’s…”
“You didn't have to do that,” he mutters. John just shakes his head, smiling. He does, however, take a moment to squeeze Sherlock's fingers under the table. The touch sends a warmth all through Sherlock, a warmth that he fears gathers in his cheeks. Unfortunately, his fear is confirmed by the grin on John's face and the affectionate sparkle that appears in the man's eyes.
Ropes were being cut, on both ships, the connections linking them falling away.
“Well, maybe I would have!” Sherlock cried. To his horror, he felt his eyes prickle and blinked quickly to dispel the sensation. “Maybe, if you’d actually been
“Anything you’re interested in exploring, as long as it’s a topic within the time period we’ve covered.” Watson said. “Just email me your ideas, or run it by me after class. Any questions?”
That was a definite improvement. The breeze no longer pressed the sticky cloth to him, but instead cooled his skin. He sighed and swept his damp fringe back, then turned back to Sherlock.
But it seemed his fumbling had inadvertently done the trick; Sherlock’s eyes were widening, his lips parting in surprise.
Sherlock shouldn’t have let himself believe it. He shouldn’t have let himself get so close, should have rebuffed John’s gentle advances once they’d become friends, should have told John after their first kiss that a relationship with him was not a good idea that would only end in pain for them both. He shouldn’t have given into his own sentiment, because now he was paying the price. The price being, of course, his heart, which he felt was becoming more bruised by the day.
John and Sherlock did not, in fact, speak the next morning.
, Greg reflected.
"Don't worry about it," John smiled, glancing at his watch. "We don't have much time, anyway. We slept a bit late."
John met Sherlock’s gaze. “Thank you. You did not have to do this.”
“John, why are you still awake? It’s past midnight. Don’t you have to be awake early tomorrow?”
“As well we should,” John kissed the wrinkle, then pulled back to survey Sherlock’s face. His thumb traced over the scar above his brow. “Will you tell me about this, dearest?” he asked.
Sherlock smirked. “Hush, we don’t want to wake Rosie.”
“John,” Sherlock murmured in a questioning tone.
And Sherlock revels in it. He leans back against John’s arm and enjoys the show. However, in the back of his mind, the desire to kiss John grows and grows. He
Not many people are here yet. So John occupies himself by adjusting the placement of his book, turning it on its stand so it better faces toward the front of the store. He then spends several minutes digging through his bag for his favorite pen, one he reserves especially for signing contracts or books. Finally finding it, he places it carefully on the tabletop and waits.
“Er…” John began.
John’s hand lets go of his and moves up to cradle his cheek. “Happy New Year, by the way. I never actually said it aloud.”
James rolled his eyes. “We agreed the last spar yesterday was a draw.”
Very well. John started forward, though exhaustion from so long staying afloat and holding his breath made his movements sluggish. Still, he reached the first of the longboats before any of his surviving men.
at him, was…
“I know you’re awake. Your breathing increased in both depth and speed.”
“Well enough. I imagine you and Molly will make me eat full rations today.” His nose crinkled.
“Mmm,” John groaned. His voice contained a touch of hoarseness, which made Sherlock’s stomach turn over in a strange yet pleasant way. “You.”
“Try to explain,” John murmurs. “Please.”
“What was that about?” he asks, sounding concerned.
“They would kill you immediately.”
Mycroft lifts an eyebrow. He does not reply for a moment, only looks John up and down, as if x-raying him. “Do you know what is interesting about you, Mr. Watson?”
“What case? I haven’t given you any new ones.”
“What?” Sherlock’s eyes widened.
Sherlock tried to move forward to help, but weakness brought him to his knees before he could do more than take a single step. Then, a claw grabbed him and pressed an icy-cold sword against his throat.
Sherlock's eyes crinkled at the corners. “You remember the skull?”
“Sorry,” John heard himself whisper. “I couldn’t stay away.”
“It’s Captain James Moriarty, you insolent creature. Not Victor. Hateful name anyway. Although…” he smirked. “Almost appropriate, as I rule the seas. I am the victor, the conqueror.”
Sherlock scowled. “Because as you said to your own men, you are a guest here. Thus, you are beholden to me. Let us speak, Captain, alone.”
“I’m not going to use it when we board,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “But when I sneak onto ships in ports, it could come in handy.”
"I don't think he's ever entirely forgiven me for how I reacted to the whole... Sebastian thing," John admitted as he smoothed the locks of hair off Sherlock's forehead. "He sounded kind of... I don't know, terse."
“What, for people like Jimmy or Mike? Yeah, well, I’m not them,” John waves a dismissive hand.
“He saved your life,” she snapped. “It was his decision to stay back and help your crew. We could have given chase, but instead he ordered us to drop the longboats and fish you lot out of the water. So. Talk to him.”
She entered to find her professor sat at a small desk in the back corner of the room. The rest of the space, with low slanting ceilings, was taken up by three other desks. None of the others were occupied at that time of the afternoon, but Molly could still imagine that when all were occupied, it was rather crowded.
He laid his head back down, and John held him just a bit tighter. Only a few days away was Christmas, which would surely be full of smiles and laughter, but beyond that John hardly knew what to expect. Sherlock's birthday was soon, winter would end, and someday they would be married. But the particulars John hadn't planned for. At the moment, he wasn't bothered by that. His plan had gone well, and he hadn’t felt the need to plan any farther.
You might have noticed the chapter count went up. I decided I needed one more, because the next bit isn't quite done, and I wanted to stay on schedule and post something today. So this one's a bit of a cliffhanger (sorry!), but the next part will come in about a week.
He gives his text a rapid once-over.
Sherlock opens his eyes and smiles.
John softens at that. It’s an odd compliment to be sure, disguised by an almost-insult, but he knows Sherlock doesn’t mean it in a disparaging way. And honestly, it’s one of the most romantic things Sherlock has ever said.
John frowned. “In contact? No, erm, no I am not. I haven’t seen him in more than seven months.”
. After all, how many Navy men had been on a pirate ship and lived to tell the tale?
“So what is it?” John asked old Stamford as he reached the bottom of the hill where the man waited. This town’s harbor was small but significant for the region; they needed the easy access to the shipments of supplies. Stamford and his young son had once lived in London, on the same street John had once taken rooms. Now, they were crossing paths again unexpectedly. Despite his quest for a bit of solitude, John had been glad to see a friendly face in this remote area.
“Sorry,” Sherlock sounded miserable, distressed. He buried his face in his hands.
Molly nudged Greg's arm in greeting. He nudged back and smiled, then pulled out his book, notebook, and pencil.
And the way John’s grip on him tightens, the way he kisses him harder, tells Sherlock that perhaps this new sentiment isn’t harmful. Not if John is with him, showing him the way.
, while John bent over their captain. No one spoke as he fumbled at Sherlock’s neck for a heartbeat.
I will clean out this malware
Okay, so I have never written smut before. Please go easy on me. It isn't that graphic, and probably isn't even well written, but... here you go.
—but this is the first time they will have spoken since then. Sherlock has had classes, and he assumes John has had things to do as well. It occurs to him he has no idea what the writer does, other than write and attend book signings. Hmm. He shall have to investigate that.
Irene seemed to read his mind. “He may be a pirate, Watson, but don’t let that fool you. It should tell you something, the way the crew is with him. They follow him—
Written before the events of How Novel.
“Damn, John Watson.” James shook his head. “You are a force to be reckoned with. How is it you only first began training with a sword a few years ago?”
But he couldn’t. So what kind of sailor was he?
,” Sherlock rolls his eyes spectacularly.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s oceanic eyes flickered with faint irritation. “While I may not have preemptively approved of your presence on my ship, I cannot deny the potential usefulness your knowledge could be, now that you are here.”
Thanks for reading this! Like I said in my note in chapter 1, I started this a year ago and then forgot about it. But, considering the current pandemic situation, I've been going through some of my old documents and seeing what in there is worth posting. So hopefully I'll get some old/new-to-readers stuff posted soon! I hope everyone is taking care of themselves. Stay safe, and stay strong.
resident at the time of the killing. Speaking of such things was simply… un-British of her.
darkness, as we all do. But it isn’t all you are.”
have been for the past few years.”
Sherlock shook himself. "Yes, sorry, I was just..." he smirked at John. "We should have done this ages ago.”
At the prow, fingers reached up and seized a line. A pair of boots stepped onto the railing, the toes hovering over the side of the ship, over the water, as if poised to leap into action. A hand reached up and adjusted the headscarf, of darkest azure, that held down a mass of unruly hair. As the hand lowered again, its touch lingered against the harsh white scar that trailed across a collarbone.
“I can’t believe it,” John whispers.
It is well after lunchtime, so Sherlock feels safe leading John to Angelo’s, which is luckily just under ten minutes away on foot. John seems perfectly content to walk, the crowds lightening as people’s lunch hours end and they head back to work. Sherlock still somehow manages to get rammed into rather badly, and he staggers into John, who catches him by the arm.
“No, actually,” John laughs. “I was already in uni studying writing. I’d loved stories since I was a kid. It was the best choice for me.”
Sherlock stands and faces Sebastian fully. He’s never been so glad he has a few inches over this viper. “Stay away from him. He wouldn’t be interested in someone like you.”
John gave him a curt nod back. “Good. After that though, we need to talk. About us,” he added in response to Sherlock’s nonplussed look. “You’ve lied to me for a month. So don’t bother pretending we’re okay while we work this case, okay?”
John wondered.
Sherlock looked suddenly guilty. “My work does, on occasion, necessitate my sacking of Royal Navy ships, as they often take on NOTP cargo.”
“Now!” a voice yelled. John’s voice.
“To the horizon,” he said.
“Still,” John said. “It is a terrible thing.”
“James Moriarty,” Sherlock says aloud. “Well, that settles it. Either the people who choose the nominees are far less competent than I had hoped, or they’ve already decided you’re going to win. His nomination is clearly a mere courtesy.”
He spotted Victor, curled up at the bottom of the longboat, and seized his arm.
“Stop,” he snaps, and John’s thumb freezes. His eyes go wide in surprise at Sherlock’s sharp tone. “I don’t know what I’ve been thinking, with all this.” He gestures between them with his free hand. “Because I don’t know what you feel this is, but…” he sighs, shoulders slumping. “This isn’t me, this quiet, soft… whatever you think I am.”
Sherlock ignored his sharp tone, too busy steeling himself to reveal everything to pay much attention to the warning John’s voice contained.
Sherlock grinned. “Only out of necessity,” he replied. “What I would not give for a bottle of proper wine… Still, it will help the pain.”
“Moran…” he murmured to the empty room. “Prison records…”
He paused in his gentle stroking, then rose. Sherlock watched, still a bit shellshocked, as John crossed to the window and peered out. A few moments later he seemed to deem everything satisfactory, for he pulled the curtains shut with a decisive yank. He hurried back to Sherlock’s side and resumed the backrub.
John felt his pique rising. He turned and faced Sherlock directly, gaze unwavering. “Do you want my opinion?”
likes a dramatic exit?” John echoed, voice hoarse. “That’s rich, coming from the most dramatic person I’ve ever met.”
Then again, Sherlock Holmes had always had a knack for surprising him.
John’s men shifted on their feet, uncertain what to make of such a phrase as “deal with.” Sherlock, on the other hand, nodded.
“What, so just because I’m the first—” John says, irritation flaring.
Good heavens, John, why did you make me try
yet.”
“John,” he murmured.
Holmes nodded and moved away, but not before he eyed her notebook and gave her a rare smile.
When I uploaded chapter 9, the date got messed up or something so it seemed to have posted weird. So I just want to make sure everyone saw that one before you read this one. Lots of things happened in 9, which you’ll need to know for 10 xo
Janine rolled her eyes — probably at Irene’s pun — and nudged Irene in the side. “Okay, that was one time. And they were absolutely shagging, okay?”
Sherlock had doomed it.
All the while, Janine had texted him, several times a day, to check in. She appeared to know what she had set off in him. She knew his competitive nature, knew his pride, and had played him accordingly. He was not sure why she was so invested in his love life, but he supposed that was probably just her twisted way of showing affection.
John’s smile starts small. “Are you sure?”
John only let his smile taunt the man. Their swords flashed, and their feet dodged. He kept an eye on Sherlock, still limp on the deck, clothing shredded and body stained scarlet from various wounds.
“Hi,” he mutters, shuffling his feet.
“My darling, I-”
“And, actually…” Watson spun around in his chair, then stood. “I think I have an article here that would really help you. Might give you a new perspective too.”
“What I wouldn’t give…” he murmured, the words slipping out of their own accord.
“Did he tell you what we’ve been trying to do? With the NOTP and all?”
Sherlock tilts his head, mouth curving up on one side. He looks rather pleased, rather full of wonder. As if he has never imagined this, has never thought anyone would ever ask him out, has never believed he could be liked.
“Is it my turn yet?”
"The bees."
Where had he spent last Christmas? When was the last time someone sung happy birthday to him? What will become of him in a few years, when he's aged beyond this life of battle and wits and stoic lonely searches for people who needed to stop existing? What happens to him when he can't run any longer?
The feeling of calm acceptance does not extend the forgiveness for Tiger to make art of Sherlock. If Sherlock were to be found with Seb's signature, God or not, John would win. Nothing would ever protect him because John rarely felt the need for wrath, but Sherlock had already proven that he could draw that emotion from John. John was back on the job. John would find some way to protect his idiot-boffin.
“Maybe you are right. It won’t matter much longer. I am leaving this room now. Like it or not.” John said low and hatefully.
He stumbled, pushed away from the ledge of the roof, and collapsed onto his knees several feet away. He felt light-headed, dizzy, and vaguely sick. His limbs shook, though he ignored everything else around him in favor of sucking in as much air as he could.
a chemistry prof…”
Now, even as John had to focus on Moriarty and his vicious sword, he could not help but watch for Sherlock to move. The man had slumped down, body shaking as he tried weakly to force himself to his feet again. And John’s heart twisted in his chest, worry for Sherlock overriding his worry for himself. How could he concentrate on the enemy before him, when his lover was in pain?
“John?”
Sherlock’s mouth is crammed with a marmalade-covered scone, but when he glances up at John, he smiles. His annoyed demeanor of an instant ago drops away. “She is,” he manages to say around his mouthful. “But don’t tell her I said that.”
John suppressed a sigh. This was just like one of the admiralty’s parties. There, there were always so many questions about his time on the
“Fine,” he sighed, shoulders sagging. “I just… Sherlock, you and I…”
“Hey, sexy!”
“John,” he growled, barely audible over the storm.
“What do you plan to do with me, pirate?” John asked. He didn’t want to bother with meaningless pleasantries. Not with this man.
In the morning you hate it all —
It wasn’t exactly peak hours, but John agreed anyway. He had a distinct feeling Sherlock had told the DI that they had fought the previous night, and so Lestrade wanted to keep an eye on them as long as possible. Not that he needed to; John felt like napping, not yelling.
“From wanting to know you,” John whispers, stroking Sherlock’s cheeks with his thumbs. “All of you, even the arrogant bits you try to hide under the charming bits. I want to know you, and I want you to know me, but that cannot happen until we trust each other and open up. I trust you, but it can’t be one-way like that. Not if this is going to be a proper relationship.”
She grins at him, sending a conspiratorial look in John’s direction. “Okay, okay, I’ll leave you alone. See you, Sherlock. Nice to meet you, John.”
Sherlock’s state.
but there is no holiday cheer here.
“During the years after my father’s death, while I still in school, I met Victor. He was an orphan, adopted by a friend of my father’s. But that guardian died soon after my father did, and we were brought together by similar griefs. We became close, and I told him my story. He was a passionate person, and declared we would get revenge.”
John whirled on him. “Fine! Yes, I am upset!”
“What is that?” Sherlock asked, eyeing the ration in Molly's hands.
deal with this on his own. No point worrying anyone else. They were all busy with their own lives, anyway.
John almost chuckled, even as his insides twisted. “Some pirate you are.”
He shakes himself. He isn’t here because of a strange, slightly sinister horror writer. He’s here because he used the word “love” in an insipid poem; he’s here because he cannot abide the doubt that’s swept in during the past day; he’s here because of John.
“I thought he told you that you were handsome,” John says, sounding furious that Moriarty had dared notice.
John blinks in surprise, though a pleased little smile fights its way onto his face. “What was that for?”
“Y-yes we do,” Sherlock says. “But here…”
“Well, I’ve never met a landlady who pulls double duty taking care of a genius science student before,” he winks back. “He seems like the type to be a bit disorganized.”
“To go back there,” John admitted. “To... I don’t know, start again.”
yourself just babble on about these things.
John blinks. “What?”
“You too,” she says sweetly. “So how do you know Sherlock?”
Sherlock shook his head as he at last felt his speeding heart begin to calm.
, he thought to himself.
Sherlock kissed John as if he had been created for nothing else.
He pronounced the last word as though it had previously been a foreign concept. The thought that Sherlock had spent so many years thinking he did not deserve or would never receive love made John's heart twist in his rib cage.
But the mischievous sparkle faded, then, and Sherlock’s tone went serious. “John. Ask me. Please, I… I want to hear it.”
They open the packages. John gets a few pairs of thick, woolen socks and a decadent box of chocolates. Sherlock gets a gleaming new kettle (this one with a large label that reads “FOR SCIENCE”), and—
“What?” Stamford asked, turning to him with wide eyes.
That evening, John finds that despite the fact it’s a holiday, he can’t stop thinking, wondering… worrying.
No, he amended. John was decent, and rather chivalrous at times. He would probably say goodbye in person.
“John-”
Now, though…
Sherlock snorts. Oh, John.
Sherlock huffed out a frustrated breath between his teeth. “Lieutenant Watson, just because I am a pirate does not mean, contrary to your opinion toward me and my kind, that I have no ability to care for other people.”
John started to nod, but the movement faded away as his expression slipped into one of shock and… horror?
He felt hands pushing him back to the center of the ring and knew he must have staggered farther this time. He clenched his teeth. A pirate would not beat him, he promised himself.
John grins at him and gestures to the store at large. “Go on, I can see you're aching to explore. I don't mind. Just come find me in a bit.”
He didn’t elaborate on his initial words, but simply observed. John took the opportunity to examine him in turn.
“Alright. Male, mid- to late-forties…”
“You ought to have. You have earned it.” Mycroft regarded him with those calm, calculating eyes, so like his brother’s had been. “I hope you will have a safe journey.”
Sherlock watched in wonder. The
, he thinks again rather wildly.
“So I have heard. But have you proof of this?” Sherlock asked sharply. “Have you witnessed these acts?”
Sherlock glares. “Some of them, yes.”
“I… liked him. Call it hormones, as that’s likely all it was. Well, that and he was one of the few people who treated me with any decency in that school. But when he heard I had been calling him my ‘boyfriend’ to others, he laughed in my face. He told me it wasn’t serious between us. He said he didn’t actually want to
“I will
“Of course I want this,” John whispered harshly. “I’ve missed you so much. I’ve thought of you all the time, even when I tried not to.” He kissed him again, hard and almost bruising. “And God, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I said, during the storm and yesterday and just now… You just, sometimes you make it so difficult to think straight. But know this, Sherlock Holmes—I want this life with you. I’ve not changed my mind about that in three years, so I hardly think ever I’m likely to. Alright? I want you.”
He fixed a delighted, bright-eyed look at John, whose heart fluttered at the sight of Sherlock so excited. “I’ve a plan, once we slip into port.”
Not that it mattered to John.
He helped the boy clean off the wound again, then clapped his shoulder as he left, head bowed. Sherlock watched, tense.
“Yes.”
Moriarty’s eyes widened dramatically, and he even lifted a hand to his chest as though scandalized. “Why, I can hardly imagine what you mean. We are a ship of a trading company-”
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, without warning overcome by the need to be closer, to be closer, to be closer. With Sherlock’s eager hands encouraging him, John climbed into his lap, straddling him, and they continued to kiss. Everything, all rational thought, drifted away in favour of simple feeling.
“No!” Sherlock cried, nearly upending the tray. John jumped, startled, as Sherlock set it aside and scrambled out of bed to stand in front of John.
“ I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.”
"Was it you? Is that what your saying? You killed him?"
Mary and John both speak to Sherlock in soothing calm voices as he continues to thrash. “Time?  He’s coming out of it.  That’s right, love.  You are fine. “  She studies him.  “Yep, here we are. Into the bucket, Sherlock. “
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "What became of his rifle?"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He silently challenged his guest.
[Do you see me?]
Author: Howlynn
Mary sniffed the air for something that was missing. They hadn’t dumped any fuel to land. It left two possibilities. For a three hour flight, they hoped to purchase fuel at a discount at the destination or the plane had never been intended to fly very far. Sherlock was too upset to be behind this. He had looked positively ill as he'd turned to duck into the cabin. Maybe John couldn't see, but she knew Sherlock was aware of his brief expected life span.
John turned and smiled.  “You are healing.  Your grief has lessened and I… will fade.”
"I was always here, you just couldn't see. I had to save you this time. Nobody else was close enough. I only thought you spotted me. But then I knew what you really meant and there was no choice."
"You half-witted, cockeyed son of a—"
Story Title: The 1st Perdition of John
Sherlock really did have faith.  Watching John sleep kept it strong.  At night, John dreamed.
There are dishes in the sink, and she felt the urge to wash them and put them away. They were not John's, but were left by the crew of people who had been riffling through his things. For her, John and Sherlock still breathed here and it broke something deep in her to think they might never come home.
call that a good outcome."
Sherlock paled but nodded silently. That was a surprising attitude for a fabrication of his imaginings.
"Bollocks. No. Please, God no. Ford Hall. Of course. Perfect. That is absolutely…my disaster of a life in triplicate. Dot the tees and cross the eyes I am…Going to throw up now," John said, actually turning slightly green.
“I am about to die. Alone.  It is always that way.  He’s already dead but he will take me with him.  It can’t end any other way.” Sherlock twists.
“What?  You don’t think I can be on stage dressed like this, do you?”
“What kind of life will it have, Sherlock? I can’t wrap my head around it. It would never be safe, not with her living anywhere near it,” John had responded with sad surety.
“Are he and Charles still…” Sherlock asked very quietly and his breathing was all that gave away his rage at the idea.
"He was not ugly. My age, blond. A German fellow, funny and cheerful. I thought it would be more exciting, but I knew after ten minutes of snogging this was a terrible mistake. He thought I had an injury that had affected me. He wasn't offended. Quite polite actually."
"My darling. I am not leaving anything, just going to follow you as always. You will live forever. My purpose is complete. I am honored to have called you friend and nothing will ever match those short moments. I hope you can forgive me for calling you a machine. You were always the most human of the two of us. I am sure that what I lost when you ended your journey with me was the most important thing I ever had. Genius needs an audience is what you told me, so I am taking my place. I am happy for the first time in an endless eternity without you. I don't know how you missed that I fell in love with you and I just hope you knew. The only thing that matters is a chance to tell you. I don't want anything else, but for you to know that. I expected miracles of you. But I know they don't really exist, so I will make one. I know that they did exist once. We found each other. Maybe we can do it just one more time and whatever we are after, we will find each other again. You made my heart stop. Every beat since has been only in my mind. "
John was helpless to do more than run. He can't speak. He follows a ghost made flesh and it called him so deeply he can do little else but match the long strides with his own shorter ones. He doesn't care where he's leading; only that Sherlock is real, and John is gloriously getting to run in the rain and the dark with the feeling of hope in tomorrow. Sherlock was racing ahead, not looking back and John ran one step behind, just where he belonged.
“Mary. Heart of the conspiracy,” Sherlock continues to speak but it is unintelligible.
This phone call, it's... it's my note. That's what people do, don't they? Leave a note.
"You were bluffing. I knew that, you know. I know that you…" John was startled by the arm that slid around his throat, but he offered little resistance as his head was forced forward in a traditional sleeper hold.
John knows there is a lot of activity going on and someone is kissing him as he spews something burnt, oily and nasty like a frigid volcano. Everything hurts and something is determined to shove at least one of his broken ribs into his lungs. He shoves the kisser aside and vomits, nearly aspirates before hands guide him to lie on his side and still there is more erupting from him. His pain level is so great that he feels his bowels and bladder release and he doesn't care in the least.
“Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list? Everything, Sherlock. Everything you've taken.”
"John, we can't do anything else for him. I know. I know you and he were … more than mere … friends. I don't know how far and I don't want to know, because it isn't my business and I don't care. I am here, because, there have been some who have mentioned you are not managing this. I do understand the desire to hope above all facts. But he wouldn't want to see you like this. I can't stand to see you do this any longer. You have to accept this. Grieve. Stop cursing your life with this obsessive false footing. I have seen this sort of thing. You have too."
It was stupid to have made promises to her he couldn't keep. He promised to love her and honor her and he did neither. He meant to, but it was more than he had to give. She had never pushed him, but as time slowed and they lost that initial something, she somehow understood who he was having some internal impossible affair with.
“So we have a spook convention disguised as a music festival?”
“He was…my…Sherlock. My Sherlock.” John said with a lazy exaggeration. A tear rolled down his cheek and his head shook as if to deny the ability to fathom a more grand description.
"Oh I understand. I'm going to hate it."
"You actually loved her. Or was it just that overactive martyr thing you think I haven't noticed."
John leaned back and looked at Sherlock in amused shock. "I never would have expected you to be such a jealous man, Sherlock. Never."
Then his head snapped up and Sherlock turned as he realised what the crashing sound behind him was just as the first sting followed by two more made him hiss in pain.
When John was finally pronounced to be in mission ready condition, the information was conveyed with delicate breads, fine cheeses, richly sauced meat, three bottles of wine and seduction.  Rat counted on the adrenaline rush John would feel at successfully completing his recovery.  He was not disappointed.  He and John were whole again.   He played John Watson’s pleasure like he played his violin, skillfully, passionately, and without apologies.  But it wasn’t enough.  Ford wanted more.  He wanted John to be his, just for a little while.
John was determined to wallow in his lonely tragic world. The friends began to forget to bother to ask him to their little gatherings. He'd been absent for some time and this finally became accepted as who he was. A friend can only do so much and eventually they gave up trying to make it better for him.
John shakes his head. “There is no obstruction, but I am losing him?  It’s all in his mind. “  without thinking John pulls his gun from the back of his trousers, where it is usually tucked.
“Naw. But got ya.” She leaned on the door and concentrated for a moment. “That was your let down speech, the one the good doctor cheated you out of, wasn’t it.”
John blushes as he asks. “So what's he like? The other me in the other place?”
"No. Not just this day. Every single one of them. Every day. All of them. This one just happened to win. I have spent more than a thousand days right here. More days then I knew you. It stopped being worth it after about three. You can't tell me you didn't know, not if Mycroft was giving you updates. Do you know how it feels that I have thought of nothing but finding you and you would rather I do this then trust me? You said you could have come back a year ago, but you didn't even ease my burden then.  It makes me feel like it was a mistake to have warned you. I could have left with hope and instead I have to know...for as long as I can stand it...that you didn't trust me and you didn't care if I lived or died.  Stupid, how what we believe can be so far from the truth. I had won every day so far...that's all.  Today was nothing special...just like me." John smiled and there was an unholy light there in his eyes like a man walking to a gallows with his dignity.  " Mary left me...I think... because she knew.  I couldn't hide it all the time. Tried.  But you were in my mind and she always knew.  She said she could see your ghost in me some days.  She knew one day I would...follow you.  She loved me.  She did...does.  I made promises to her that I had no intention of keeping. I let her go, because I cared enough not to make her watch."
"Oh, blast that, Izzy. You think you know everything and I saw exactly what you were about back in '84. Don't let her fool you for a wink, Martha. She's got no room to talk, carrying on with that Wiggams chap like he was God's gift. Left owing her eight month's rent and had that other poor girl in trouble to boot. That wasn't even the last of your business I could –" Mrs. Dalrimple said with popping-wide merry eyes.
They were meant to be words of comfort. Mycroft couldn't have known of their last words in person. Mycroft couldn't know he'd just locked the gates to hell. The violin is silent here in the abyss.
John looked at him skeptically. "Where would we be this moment, if I had left Baker Street, after the drugs bust? If I hadn't followed you?"
The second page said,
It was a Sunday special edition, that brought John both pure triumph and abject pain. His Sherlock was in the news again.
John had not let Paul finish his tirade, nor had he let him finish the last connections to the home-made explosive device Paul's fingers were desperately finalizing as he spoke his last advisement to his onetime friend. It took more than 30 hours and three remarkably close calls to disassemble the contraptions he'd left behind. If a local bomb force had found the devices, it probably would have made international headlines for weeks. Explosives were not John's area but he did see the debrief due to the fact he'd taken him out just in the nick of time.
“Yes. Well. It was a long time ago and I am wiser now. We have never gotten over that error and I am at some point going to have to resolve his position, once and for all. He is unfortunately far more devious than I once imagined. Things are in a delicate spot at the moment. I won’t allow another brother to be his chew toy.” Mycroft said with a deep sigh and an uncharacteristic slump deeper into the chair.
“Well, that reference was in poor taste. You are aware…” he questioned with mock surprise.
Marina and the Diamonds
The detective knew he was in trouble by the time he righted the toppled hive.  He tried to remain calm, but he was breathing hard and beginning to sweat and his mind could not stop his instinct to swat at the painful sticks of venom.
2nd Perditon
Ford had gone a bit berky and made John a wallet.  After hunting down and murdering the pathetic sod who had destroyed his John, Ford had thrown himself into his work.  He’d expected to hear something when John realized what the wallet represented.  He’d feared it would not be enough, his little token of vengeance, but he was confused to find no word of any kind sent through channels from John Watson acknowledging his effort.  It never dawned on him, considering his propensity for taking trophies, that John would miss the significance of his gesture.
Sherlock
"Of course. Yes. God, yes," she said with a tender smile and a nod.
Molly laughed. Sherlock could tell at once it was with him, not at him and he laughed too. Molly leaned her head back on the cool stone. He was right about the migraines. "Thank you for saying that. And for not being afraid of the creepy morgue girl. I like what I do. Probably weird, but, I think it's important. The dead talk to me in some ways. No, don't take that wrong. I don't hear them. I can see their lives on their faces. That's all. Some of them are beautiful, no matter how bad they look at that moment. Like these." She points up to the names on the wall behind her.
He felt like at that moment if he showed her just a glimpse of who Captain Watson had been, there was every chance that she would put him out of his misery. Mary was very easy going on small things but he’d seen her put her foot down too and seen her wrestle unruly patients to the floor with such efficiency that it had stopped him in his tracks. They play fought, like siblings at times and on more than one occasion he’d wondered if she had let him win.
He’d managed to follow much of his son’s activities.  It had kept his attention far from thoughts of a certain broken doctor.  His controllers unsurprisingly were sending him on missions at odds with Sherlock’s purposes, but he’d still managed to keep an eye on both of his son’s.  He knew Mycroft was heavily involved in the mess with Moriarty and conveniently the strands of that web were so vast that he could skew the covert assessments of individuals entangled enough to justify his involvement.
"Some. Many were of you always dying, but even the good ones simply made the nightmare a daymare, when I woke and you were still dead."
They would have been home when the call would have come. Mycroft would have spoken to Mary—
The cabbie gave him a bit of a second look as he counted, raised his eyebrows in surprise and tucked his cash away. "Look, you got some place to go, mate? I mean, this is in the bloody middle of nowhere. It's a dangerous spot to be dumped out, you know. I mean, there's these stories and shite. I could take you on to town?"
John stopped living and felt like a hero every single day he didn't die of a broken heart. He became that Machine he had accused his friend of being.
“Not long.  It’s our last night here.  I thought we could…”he trailed off letting his hands do the talking.
Story Title: The 3rd Perdition of John
A concussive wave filled with debris knocked him forward and his ears went silent with pain as a warm hand of heated air slammed him forward and lifted him before discarding him like a rag into a rubbish pile of crippled bodies and crumpled theater seating damned by the stage itself. More blasts seemed to roll over him like thunder, and he tucked his head and closed his eyes and wondered if Sherlock and Rat were some of the muffled voices he could hear screaming.
"She was critically injured. We know where she is, but…"
“Bring more chocolates.” Sherlock ordered and popped another in his mouth whole. His cheeks crinkled all the way from eyes to chin as he beamed at John.
“As safe as my son can manage.  He will be positioned in the most dangerous possible place and so safe is a relative word.   We are here to insure that never takes place and to try to keep him alive as wel,l if possible.  The featured cello player is one of ours as well.  We are to protect the two operatives and stop the assassination.  We are the swing vote, so to speak. This whole operation is an onion.”
Mycroft turned to the last page in the file. It was a handwritten note from his brother. Of course it was written in their own childish 'pirate' code. Mycroft's fingers trembled as he quickly translated it. It was a simple, if unknown, substitution and shift. It would only take an expert a few hours to extract any message written this way, but it did keep random prying eyes at bay.
“Oh.  Good then.  Should I be trying to find a clarinet?  I doubt my playing will do more than turn a few snobs into killers…” He smiled waiting for Rat to tell him what was going on.
John winced as Rat put him through his paces.
“We will stand on that bridge when the rain comes, John. It would be a good war, but it would break me to beat you.” She grinned genuinely.
Molly sat in total shock. It all hit her and she flung herself backward on the mattress and wailed like a soul was ripping from her flesh.
John held his breath as all the magic bled away and he really looked at the man sitting beside him. His eyes still looked like ash as if he could burn the world down and never show a second's regret. His face had moved south slightly and now, in his early sixties, the first puckers of jowls could be discerned. He was still magnificent, but in the same way as a Lion who is days from losing his place in the pride he had built and fathered.
'Good Morning. At the top of the hour, Mathew Carter will give you the latest on the FTSE 100 and what's happening right now on the London Stock Exchange. Kerrigan Havertry will tell us about our record temperature drop overnight and Scott Kole will bring you an update on what's to be expected this week in sports. Currently, we have the sad duty to report that a respected and beloved member of our community, best remembered for his work on some of the most baffling crimes of recent times, has apparently been reported missing. At this time, it is confirmed that the search and rescue mission has now changed over to search and recovery. Dr. John Watson, is presumed dead. Please be cautioned, these images may be disturbing.'
Mycroft takes a deep breath and holds it before admitting, “I was not responsible, but I missed an obvious deduction. I was distracted by sentiment.  I broke both of them in different ways. He made himself like this.”
"Then spell it out, because I can't see you kipping on Mycroft's sofa with much enthusiasm."
"Well, I am about to arrange for your death, and if you can't swim, that might go badly. And we have bigger concerns right now than your boyfriend troubles. How long has it been since you laid eyes on Tiger?" The dry tone is normal and John takes no offence at not having a clue what the man's plans are.
"Yes you are. I feel you. I accept your judgment, John. You didn't want me to die. You wanted me to live in torture. You want me to live what I put you through and I will die insane and old if it means you are satisfied. I would follow you now if you would let me. This second. I would happily be boiled alive if physical pain would appease you. I am afraid to die, for the first time in my life, John. If I die now, I will never see you again, because you will not have forgiven me. If I die now, I go to hell. "
Summary: 'It's all a game, John, and I always play to win."
An age of sighs pass before Sherlock responds, "Baker Street means nothing if you are not part of it."
John set his phone down and rubbed his eyes, exhausted and miserable.  His phone pinged that he had an unknown text.
Moriarty brought him his fifth pip as insurance. Things didn't go as smoothly as planned. John had done the unexpected. Moriarty had never intended to kill Sherlock. He'd wanted something else. If not, there was no purpose to the entire bomb game.
"You're a bloody idiot. You picked the wrong pill, Sherlock. You guessed and you guessed wrong."
Moriarty, in this case was not a family name, but a title. James Moriarty was never a man any more than Richard Brook was an actor. Mori means to die. Moriarty means a great navigator of the seas. He has no known children, yet it is said that they are searching for his heir.
That silly notion of hers, that one day she might win his heart, by default, tenacity, favor or pity, would be a pyre of dry optimism just touched with flame. She would try to fight it, those small smoldering places in her heart labeled with all the things she thinks she sees in him, but in the end the fire would win.
“I was talking to Mary?” John fired back.
John stepped forward at once and with military precision disarmed Sherlock and put him on the floor in a control position.  He shouted into his ear, out of breath and adrenaline fueling his need for oxygen.  "I hate you.  I really...really hate you.  What the hell is wrong with you?"
“No. You can’t know that. Who even told you this, Janine? The epitome of honesty?”
"Done.  Jesus...little buggers did a number on your face.  Heard about your accident.  You look pure shit."
The music filled the great building as if a storm rolled from the sea and John watched father and son play together with only one aware of the privilege.  Their movements were synchronized so precisely it was mesmerizing.  John had to force himself to look away and cast a quick glance around to look for danger.  There seemed to be no threat and yet a few moments later, John’s focus on the stage lost the wonder and his hackles began to rise.
“ Of course. Of course you do, John.”
"It wasn't trust, it was safety. I wanted to come back a year ago, but you were moving on. You were happy? I don't understand. Has something happened to your wife? You were happy. I saw you."
"Oh, darling. I am so sorry about your poor little doctor." Mummy said, making Sherlock's exact fake frown face.
Sherlock babbled nonstop for almost half an hour. John followed as best he could.
His vision is swimming and he is so tired as he stalked the banks of the Thames. He again tried to cure his situation though the tremors told him the battle with his body was nearing critical mass.
Sherlock deliberately formed a calculated smile.  “I am.”
[10:55 – Are you still with me? JW]
Sherlock is suddenly aware that he is somewhat afraid of New John. He chews his lip and frowns.
"Then it wasn't unloaded. Physically it was, but not in your mind. I have seen him kill. Molly, I should never have asked this of you. I should have done so many things differently. You have lost something. I ruined you, but I knew that long ago. I am always right." His hands roam up to her neck and he blindly caresses her cheek.
Sherlock laughs and says, "From my name, you decided you're safe? Talking to a bloke half the police force in the city calls a sociopathic freak doesn't scare you? Because my name alleviates any fear of my being a member of the dismembering body-maker club? I see why you like this lot then," his head nods toward the wall. "You're like them. Brilliant, I see. But also spectacularly foolish." He had puffed up and glares at her in an intimidating way.
His face had so many imperfections but the second it was animated by his spirit, John was warmer to Rat than the very sun.   Photos could never do him justice.  John could be a scary righteous little hound, a faithful dog and most of all, the wolf in wooly jumpers, but he would never be noticed when represented on high gloss paper.
He croons the words that he can remember to an old Bob Dylan tune as he started home, wishing for yesterday. He understands not having time to think, unfortunately thinking is not optional in his line of work. He has spent the day trying to think but the bits will never add up to John Watson's life snuffed out in the Thames being something unpreventable. Destiny cheated John and there is no platitude that can change the pointless waste of all he still had to give.
"Hey. Hey mister? You there?"
Was he mad to be so chuffed that the evil bastard who had wrecked their lives could still be out there playing games? Certainly it could be the worst thing he could possibly think of happening except for just one.
“You are wasting your time,” he assured her with a little kinder tone as he lowered himself into the chair and rolled back and forth nervously.
Pale skin and livid eyes. The magnificent one, here already. Sherlock nodded, pleased response only flashing in his eyes and the curl of his lip for a second.
John sucked his breath in and held it. “Is that a sideways ultimatum? Them or you?”
She studied Mycroft carefully and it dawned on her that there was wizard in the wind.
John laughs but it isn't mirthful, instead it borders on bitter. "Nothing that hasn't happened before."
"Delightful to know your thoughts.  I was having some lovely ones a moment ago.  You interrupted.   Pray tell for purpose other than my face located in proximity to Doctor Watson being a boon for your pocket book.  You have a case?"
"Your brilliant, aren't you? You are like me in a different way?"
They did understand that John had been fond of the man, though they themselves could express few redeeming qualities for Sherlock Holmes. John barely spoke of him now. They understood. It was like losing an aged parent to dementia or a small child to a preventable tragedy. There was nothing that could have been done, but the one responsible for the departed would, of course, have to examine every moment at length to finally assuage the simple survivor guilt.
"And this is unexpected how?"
She looked skeptical and slightly annoyed with him. “Seriously, do delusions of grandeur fill in anything the paranoia and chronic depression miss?”
Provided all those things fail to kill him, he has hypothermia, and probable pathogen borne infection to contemplate, while praying it's a low chemical load day and that nobody dumped anything near the river that will cost him his eyes or all his skin for that matter. Swimming in the Thames was a bad idea, no matter how confidently a Holmes said it would work.
"Oh. I'm sorry. Were you speaking to me?" she asked nervously stepping back slightly.
He couldn't help but dream of such things. He wasn't sure there would be another chance. Live or die, he knew who he wanted to spend his life with. Molly had been his choice only because the other choice had been taken away. He couldn't say he felt he was settling for second best, but without Sherlock, he'd allowed his dreams to morph into new more comfortably traditional places and his heart felt split. He could not be without Sherlock if allowed the option any time in the future, but he wasn't sure he wanted to be without Molly. He'd made this insane decision to go with Rat on the fly, without really weighing his options.
Taxi breaks squealed outside and the odor of kidney pie wafted up the stairs.
“Wait. You and Sherlock …have a brother?” John asked, dumbfounded.
"Bit late to worry about me seeing something secret. Who has been dusting it all along?" Mrs. Hudson says slightly offended.
"You're teaching me a lesson? You blame me?" She can't fathom how this encounter has changed so quickly. "You want to punish me, for John's death? Jesus, you have to be kidding me here. Don't be a coward, Sherlock. I won't play this kind of game. I won't. You made me wait all this time. And the reasons were horrible, but we were here…and…what was this? What did you think we were doing here?"
John was not gay. John was not a criminal justice major. They did know that John was a bit of a thrill seeker and they all assumed that beings this Holmes fellow seemed predisposed to disaster, perhaps John found it intoxicating. It, being danger, violence, trouble and general chaos, was their only explanation for his unexplainable attachment to the strange and, though brilliant, illusively manipulative Scotland yard snob.
"Too much of a coward?  You could try hitting me again, after all, you never really apologised.  Not for that.  Not for kicking me like you wanted me dead. Say it to me once and for all. Show me so I never have another doubt.  You apologised to your dead wife for cheating on her with my sister but...not to me...go ahead. Have another go...Doctor." Sherlock held his arms away from his body, palms up, a sacrificial lamb for the slaughter, daring his flatmate to again resort to violence.
John had made the appropriate phone calls to those concerned about Sherlock's condition.   Mycroft demanded an explanation for the behavior of the bees.
Mycroft’s face darkened. “Oh, dear lord, just tell me what disaster you have planned this time. I would rather have my fingernails pulled then hear about the revolting dude ranch experience again.”
Realm: Sherlock
John had been able to do that once and he thought he saw it refected from time to time.  He knew he had been able to show his feelings back when it really was just them against all the Donovans and Moriartys of the world.
"No use bringing up old hash. Martha needs that like she needs long red knickers. Besides, her guest belonged to the poor crippled doctor and she might take all our chin-wagging wrong. We are so sorry to hear of your loss, my poor, poor, dearie." Laura Hernsley declared sweetly to Molly.
Detective Sargent Lestrade and Molly Hooper had managed to pull his brother into sobriety and some measure of responsibility. At the time, Mycroft was appreciative of any small favor on Sherlock's behalf. He'd run off to America at one point and Mycroft had washed his hands of the whole affair. He'd assumed his brother was dead by the time his influence had grown enough to have the power to track him down to some Florida backwater. He was returned to England, alive but addicted and his mind addled to such a degree that Mycroft was unsure if he would ever find more than a disappointing end.
“Then what did you do that people still write to you? “
Story Title: The 4th Perdition of John
Sherlock had become nobody for him.
Sherlock flashes her his brilliant smile and Janine pretends not to see how liquid his eyes have grown.
" I couldn't give you anything, so I donated all the last good -bits to Molly. Forgive me, John. I know she belonged to you, but you did abandon her which allowed my prior claim to reinstate. That isn't the whole picture though." Sherlock takes several deep breaths as if he's having a small panic attack.
“Yes.  I see you too.  I’m here.  And…so are you.  I knew you were still here. I am always right.” Sherlock stood and slowly reached out and encircled John in his arms.
John doesn't say a word. He gets up, goes upstairs and changes his clothes. He returns to his chair and props the note on a book and tries to figure out what else he can say. He can't think as Ford moves around the kitchen, not needing to ask where the cups are or where he keeps the tea. John reminds himself, he has been here before.
"Look. Another one." The second male voice prompts.
"And you cared. I know you do." She moved her head, nuzzling him.
Fine.
He’d jumped to the conclusion that John and Sherlock were a pair, from all public innuendo and his own observation of body language in the increasingly regular media coverage of their exploits.  He read John’s blog, searching for clues, perhaps expecting to find confirmation and therefore extrapolating what he hoped to see.  He had hoped for a Christmas reunion, of sorts, but Mycroft was far too distracted to follow his obvious yellow brick road, so he’d carried on, as was expected of him.  Time passed and his son became the meteor he’d always known him to be.
A photograph flutters haphazardly toward the bed showing a man with a severe face and a snotty sneer gracing his face.  His arms are crossed and he glares haughtily with a conductor’s baton casually grasp in his fingers. “My job is to see that this person survives the evening.  Your job will be to watch for Tiger, and anyone who may be in his company.  When the man in this photo comes on stage, there will be an attempted assassination.  Those who do not wish to kill him or help achieve it, will seek to kidnap him.”
Mycroft smirked and cleared his throat. He rose from his seat and excused himself before exiting the plane.  The stewardess offered Mary a drink and she asked for the loo, leaving John and Sherlock to carry on.
3rd Perdition
“You killed me for the most part and made a bloody joke of me on the night I was going to propose and finally find the strength to let you go. I had finally decided to live, or at least stop being mostly dead and that was when you interrupted to discuss facial hair. You made fun of me. Then in the carriage with the bomb, you faked tears to make me forgive you and then we didn’t die. I loved you most. More than any of the ones who got to know you were alive and that hurt. I suffered long after the press quit hounding me and long after I stopped falling apart every time somebody said something horrible about you and even when they all announced that I had been right about you all along and they all started pointing fingers and wanting me to say things that I wished by then had actually happened – I didn’t get to be put out of my misery. You left me and never looked back. She was the one who picked up the broken foolish man who didn’t have a reason to not top himself. She said I was good enough. She didn’t love you or hate you. I got to tell her my stories and the Sherlock she knew was the one I painted. She didn’t care that you were tall or cool or a bloody lunatic and it meant there was someone who got it. I asked her not to read anything, about you. I wanted her to understand my Sherlock, not theirs, not the Reichenbach hero, but mine.” John said his breathing hard and his voice raspy.
