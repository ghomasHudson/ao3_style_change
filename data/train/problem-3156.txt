“Hello?”
His attraction - while understandable, they were both stunning nearly perfect looking men - did make him feel like a horrible creep. Especially with how sweet and loving they were to each other. Neither could seem to stay out of the other’s orbit, constantly touching and looking over at the other. Their scents permanently mingled showing how strong their bond was. It made Samandriel feel that much more guilty about every wet dream he had over them. Honestly, seeing them together he couldn’t imagine anyone quitting such a great job because they were against the union, but he totally believed quitting over the sexual frustration of being around the handsome men and knowing they had no chance with the intelligent, caring, and obviously in-love duo.
“Yes, congratulations Sam. I know you and Lana will be immensely happy together.”
Dean turned looking past the crowds, he had no idea where to begin searching for his little brother. For Dean, they hadn’t spoken in months and he only knew Sam’s schedule as far as when to call or text, not where on the property he would be found. Suddenly he noticed a tall man over by the steps of a red brick building. His hair was long but he had on a familiar light gray Kansas shirt Dean would recognize anywhere.
“With what?” His ice blue eyes widened in wonder, had it not been for the upward tilt to his lip she would have believed he’d forgotten.
“I...I don’t know. I mean they’re incredible, beautiful, funny, loving, they’re the best men I know but I never even entertained the idea of actually having them. I mean, I’m just me.”
The proud smile was back on Sam’s face and Dean turned to the window to avoid the hero worship in his brother’s eyes. “It’s a good thing he has you looking out for him then. Someone who knows when it’s okay to let the kid be strong and when he can be soft. I mean, you raised me and I might be biased, but I think you did one hell of a job.”
“No, he realized his brothers were going to push ahead and try to start a war with him. But now he had me and he didn’t want anything to put me at risk, so he went to Michael and asked if his brother would agree to step off the board. Michael said no, that this was their father’s will and had to be done. Plus they were still really mad about me, so Father took himself off the board instead. He grabbed Lilith, the first demon and the final key to the cage, and dragged her into the cage Grandfather built for him eons ago. Now no one can make him fight and he put me on the throne so I’m not a risk to Earth or the humans because I rule Hell.”
“I’m not abusive.” Her voice wavered and sounded meek to her own ears.
“Look, it’s late and I know we caught you by surprise. Just think about it, okay?”
The angel's face remained stoic but his eyes twinkled with mischief. “They attempted to undermine Jack, he defended himself, and put them in their place. Verbally and physically, it was an honor to witness.”
“He doesn’t have a black mark on his soul. Who is he and why is he here?”
Dean remembered, as he stared at his brother with too long hair, meticulously pouring sugar into his drink and stirring it in, that his mother offered him up to the Devil. Not knowing or caring that they weren’t going to hurt or kill his little brother. That she was the one responsible for the death of his baby brother and would have taken Sam, his rock, his best friend, away from him as well.
The normal courting period would last for over a year but neither of the three wanted to wait so long before Samandriel at least moved in. They broke tradition, but that was what the Winchesters were known for. And on a sunny Thursday morning a year after they first asked to court him, the two Alphas finally made the Omega theirs, and they were his, all three proudly wearing bites on either side of their necks. Of course since only an Omega in heat could be mated, no one was shocked when Samandriel announced his first pregnancy not a month later.
Jack grinded against the bed, whimpering woefully as he faced away from Dean. The older man wasn’t sure what to do but the boy sounded so pitiful that it broke his heart. He clutched Jack's hand, giving it a squeeze as the young boy cried to himself. It reminded Dean of all the times he took care of Sammy when he got sick. Of course Sam had regular colds and flus, not what Jack was suffering with. One thing was obvious and it was that the kid was in pain and needed to take his mind off of it.
“Fuck, I missed you. Love me some pie.”
Dean didn’t know what he expected living in Satan’s palace in Hell, but it was nothing like he would have assumed. The temperature was always comfortable, there were no sounds of eternal torture, the only fires he saw were torches in the halls and fireplaces in the rooms, but there were no screaming people in them.
“I didn’t realize you were religious.”
“You never have to thank me for that, you know I love that kid. Come on, take a bite, we both deserve some pie.”
Dean groaned clutching his stomach and trying to turn his body in an effort to aleviate the pain. “My dick doesn’t hurt so I’m not an Alpha. Do Beta’s get stomach aches this bad?”
“I want to speak to your manager you little shit! Damn teenagers think they’re too old for a whooping.”
At the mating contract signing he couldn’t help the nasty thought - which sounded like his father’s voice - that it was easy for her to say when she’s always been gorgeous, a commanding presence in every room she walks into. Samandriel was largely ignored or simply went unnoticed until someone walked right into him, he was so plain he could be wallpaper.
“Guessing the meeting with those asswipes didn’t go well.”
Castiel glowered at no one in particular, “no, they were generals under Lucifer. The first demons created after Lilith, when Hell was first made. They gave themselves the title of Princes, trying to make themselves seem more important than they are. It would be like Lilith calling herself Queen when she was actually just Lucifer’s experiment in breaking our father’s creation. To then claim it as a failure because once everything my father added was taken out it no longer worked the same.”
“My mom too.”
“Really? Little Jack kicked ass? And I missed it! Man, that sucks.” Dean couldn’t help but pout, but Cas just patted his shoulder.
“I see, well that’s unfortunate for your family then.”
“Hey now no, don’t be embarrassed Little Omega. It’s just my brother-in-law is actually looking for some help with his business. He and my brother live on a farmhouse outside of town.”
“Audience curiosity.”
Screw consciousness.
The smell of brimstone filled her nose as the sound of beating wings gave way to a handsome man in white standing before her. His suit was crisp and clean, a bright rose sat pinned to the suit jacket. His blonde hair was in a choppy men’s cut that complemented his face, softening the sharp edges of his features. His ice blue eyes stared into hers and the warning in her head she’d heard all night was now eerily silent.
The air around them became suffocating and oppressive, the smell of ozone overwhelming as it filled her senses out of nowhere.
Lana growled over the line and Dri scolded himself, he knew his cousin didn’t take to his negative self-talk well but he had to be honest right now. “I swear one day I’m slapping the nose right off your father’s face. Look, has there ever been an Omega they were interested in before?”
“It was for the best, they had actually attempted to threaten you. I fear had you been in the room instead of punishment and exile Jack may have ended their lives.”
“My King, I’ve returned from collecting from your father’s last deal.”
Dean suppressed a shiver at the handsome man’s authoritative tone.
“Awesome.”
“The Prince of Darkness, The Great Deceiver, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles… Satan? Yes to all, though you can just call me Lucifer.”
“Thank you, your majesty.” He bowed at his waist this time before turning to walk past his siblings. The three demons hissed at him with glowing yellow eyes but he ignored them and walked past the guards with his head held high.
“My brother takes my spot in Heaven. He gets to live his life without any demons or monsters or anything. My mother isn’t killed by any demons or monsters and when she dies, she doesn’t get made into a demon.”
“Your majesty,” Ramiel got in front of his shocked siblings and bowed low, kneeling on one leg until his head nearly touched the floor. “May I speak freely?”
“I… suppose I can call in to one of my siblings and have your Heaven closed off. Once your brother passes away, he would be able to get into your Heaven and remain undisturbed by the other angels should they discover he’s an intruder. Although you agreeing to take his place should wipe the black spot from his soul, making him less noticeable.”
“So, are you going to accept their offer?”
Samandriel couldn’t help the smile that blossomed on his face thinking of all the times he saw the duo kiss and touch and imagined he was a part of that. “That sounds amazing.”
“Dean-”
Desperate to change the topic enough to forget his own insecurities and embarrassment Dean handed Cas over the plastic bag from the cafe. “Here, I got this for you. It’s honey pie.”
Realisation dawned on him then and he couldn’t hide the embarrassment tainting his scent.
Samandriel chuckled, shaking his head; Dean was always such a jokester. “No, I actually got the idea to bring baked goods with us to the markets. You know, to show the customers what the honey can be used for. So many people think they can only eat it alone or with tea. I figured making some simple and easy things that anyone can make could inspire people to buy more jars and try and expand their own recipes.”
“I’m losing my fucking mind.”
“No, it isn’t safe.”
Dean’s face turned hotter under the small fond smile gracing Castiel’s lips. “Thank you Dean.”
Everything came to a head when Sam found out Mary had spent his inheritance from their father, money that was supposed to be put away for his college; she refused, saying Sam was staying home. Even Dean had argued with her but she would not be dissuaded. So Dean did the only thing he could think to do: he quit college, took whatever was left of his inheritance, and gave it to Sam. Sam had thankfully gotten a free ride to college, but with Dean’s money he was able to get books, food and whatever else he needed. The entire situation had been horrible to live through but gave Sam the drive to go into law. Dean tried hard to never think about the fact that Sam would one day become a lawyer and take their mother to court.
He sneered at her, “sure you’re not. Don’t worry, I’ll murder your ex husband, his wife and their innocent child and make sure you can’t be blamed. You just make sure your willful youngest son is home in ten years when I send for him and bring him to hell with me.”
Unable to choose between giving into his anger or his grief his voice came out numb, “he’s not there, his body is but Adam’s in Heaven now. He doesn’t even know he’s gone.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, still focused on the door, “Jack will not harm Dean. Dean is comforting him and doing a good job at that. I won’t let anything happen, Crowley.”
“He’s so great, so fucking smart and such a sweet kid. Life gave him a raw deal but he’s strong, so much stronger than I think anyone realizes.”
“Rut, it more closely resembles my father’s original plan for humans and wolves.”
“But I never chose a career. I have nothing to bring to the table.”
“You saying you not interested?” The human responded cheekily, his bravado not enough to hide his body’s responses from the celestial being.
“It’s nothing-”
Wringing her hands she stared at the ground in deep thought. The duo were silent long enough for Lucifer to summon a file and do his nails. The only sounds on the dark, deserted crossroads was the scratching of metal on nails.
“Nuh-uh, fuck this let me through.”
“Holy shit, Dean?” Sam hugged his brother back just as fiercely. Their hands gripped the backs of each other's shirts, uncaring of the curious eyes watching them.
“Excuse me, I don’t think I heard that correctly.”
“Why aren’t you in there then?”
“What does it matter? It’s death and destruction, isn’t that your thing?”
Seeing the woman walk away, the situation finally caught up with Samandriel and he began to shake. Castiel turned to ask him if he was okay but the young Omega was becoming distressed.
Sam rolled his eyes good naturedly, “I’m fine Dean. I’m not a kid anymore, you have an actual kid you need to look after. Hey, speaking of, how is he?”
“What’s going on? Is the kid okay?”
“Please don’t fire me Cas. I love this job, and I love the bees and I swear I’ll watch my mouth. I just shoot off sometimes and I don’t think and yeah I usually don’t have a job I care about so getting fired was never a reason to stay quiet but I swear I’ll do better just please give me another chance please.” Samandriel begged.
“I like stories, so tell me a story Mary. Tell me your story.”
The brothers waited as Crowley rolled his eyes dramatically and sat at another table not far from them. Dean didn’t know how to explain Crowley to his brother but he was well aware that Crowley was staying close to protect them, and that Juliet was probably circling the coffee shop to warn them of danger.
The night sky was a dark blue that faded into black. A lone figure huffed in the middle of a dusty, empty crossroads. A metal shovel scraped along the road, picking up dirt before throwing it on top of a small wooden box, filling the hole. Once the earth was packed and the hole covered, the woman pulled out a piece of chalk, marking the ground. The chirping of crickets stopped abruptly, the only sounds heard were coming from the woman’s heavy breaths. Candles were lit around the chalk-drawn symbol, the air heavy and oppressive.
“Career goals aren’t the only things Alphas look for in a mate though, you can’t let yourself get stressed out about this.”
Crowley rolled his eyes in response. “Oh please Squirrel, you think the King of the Crossroads wouldn’t know a marked soul when I see one? You’re as bright as the pearly gates, Ken-doll. Add in your over-protectiveness, I’m guessing you’re big brother Dean.”
“My penis is erect and refuses to give me any peace until I ejaculate.”
“I want my ex husband, John Winchester, his new wife, Kate Winchester, and their son Adam, out of the picture, and I don’t want anything linking me to it.”
Dean was confused, he had no idea what check Sam was talking about. The last thing he had sent his brother was a little bit of cash he was able to scrape together but nothing anywhere near enough to pay for an apartment. Crowley caught his eye and gave him a “roll with it” look from the other table.
She nodded woodenly, shocked that all of this had worked. “I wish to make a deal.”
“What?”
“Lana, I need you. Are you free?”
“You’re not here for my throne are you?” Jack frowned slightly and Dean couldn’t help but be reminded of Sam and how sad and let down he’d been when he found out Adam was dead and he wasn’t a big brother anymore.
“What!” Dean’s forkful of pie fell onto the carpeted floor. Seeing the once beautiful bite crumbled along the floor he mourned it with a sad, “son of a bitch.”
“Did the other one get jealous?”
Dri flashed back to all the hugs and touches he had thought were innocent or accidents. “Yeah, actually they have.”
“I want to hear you say it out loud. Tell me Mary Campbell - formerly Winchester - why do you seek out the Devil on an abandoned crossroad, forfeiting Heaven’s claim on your eternal soul? What’s so important that you’d risk it all just to talk to dear old Scratch?”
“You better jerk.”
“Shake on it?”
“Jack, I don’t think that’s wise. You don’t know if you can control yourself.”
“No Jack, you are having oatmeal with blueberries and poached eggs on sourdough for protein.”
“Sammy!” he cried out, running past the parting and shocked crowd until he was close enough to jump on top of his brother, hugging him tightly.
“Well I doubt you’d see my brother, Dean. He owns Winchester’s Garage and the classic car restoration building out by I-92. You’d mainly just be working with Cas.”
“I’m sure this must be a lot to take in.” Cas looked at him understandingly.
“Oh buddy believe me I consent. But yeah, let’s date… or court. Even though it kinda sounds like we’ve been doing it.”
“Kate, Dad… Adam!”
Castiel handed back the extra fork, “no thank you human food rarely tastes like anything to me, it’s all just molecules.”
Castiel sighed before turning to face the human, “Jack has locked himself in his father’s study. Lucifer himself put the protections on it so no one but he and Jack can enter or see inside.”
“This is exquisite. The honey is so rich and flavorful it’s allowing me to taste everything else in the recipe. That’s never happened before.”
Sam looked up in shock, not expecting that response or Dean’s tone. “I’m sorry De, I know you kinda put Mom on a pedestal.”
“Awesome, we really appreciate all your hard work.”
“You did nothing wrong and if you snap at anyone I know they probably deserved it. The customer is never right and if they knew everything they would be making everything themselves not buying it from professionals like us. So don’t ever feel you have to take abuse, disrespect, or threats from someone simply because of your employment.”
Dean blinked rapidly in confusion as his brain tried to process all the information. He decided to ignore the nicknames and the man’s title for now. “What do you mean marked soul?”
“Yeah, I’m gonna bring the pies and snack bars to the market tomorrow. If things go well I’m hoping to make more complicated dishes for more advanced bakers to see what they can make with Cas’ honey.”
Jack's small voice cut across the silence of the room, “They want my throne.”
“No...no, that’s not possible. I...I didn’t mean to.”
“Heaven… so I can never see her.”
“That’s good, my brother Balthazar recommended this one. It’s a summer peach pie, he swears the bourbon adds a warmth to it that isn’t overpowering.”
“I know you’re far more than your looks and a bright burning soul. But yes, courting would entail spending time together, getting to know one another, gifts, sharing meals...perhaps more if we both consent.”
“Did they bite you?” She asked out of breath once she came back on the line.
“That’s for me to know blah blah blah. Where is he?”
“Winchester!” She snapped before she could remember herself.
He wasn't a fool, he heard and understood that his mother would most likely still be ripped up in Hell, just not for the purpose of creating a demon. It was Hell, after all, and she was responsible for the death of his baby brother and their family. She made her bed and try as Dean might, he couldn’t fix this for her, but he could give her more time as well as protect Sam, who was innocent.
If it were up to him he’d never have anything to do with any of the dick with wings from Heaven. Of course he didn’t count Jack or Castiel among them, they were his family. Though the thought of an Archangel getting close to his brother raised his blood pressure. He hoped he could talk Cas into finding out why an Archangel was here. “Maybe some other time, I just wanted to check on you and see how you’re doing.”
“My mother would never.”
One of his favorite parts of the job though was working the farmer’s market. True, Samandriel didn’t enjoy working customer service, but there was something gratifying about showcasing his, Cas’, and the bees’ hard work. The crowd that shopped the farmer’s market was also a much kinder and calmer clientele. Of course there would always be at least one bad apple.
“Oh no, they live in the farm house but it’s not like an actual farm. Castiel - Cas, that’s my brother-in-law - he’s a beekeeper. He also sells homemade jars of honey at the local farmers market. Between all the land and the new hives, he’s been in need of some help, but it’s hard finding someone willing to work with him.”
----------
“It...is not a pleasurable experience to go through unmated.”
“Really? What can you taste?”
He blinked his ice blue eyes, turning them bright red as his voice dropped several octaves. “I have every right, when you are proof I was cast out for no reason. You’re a selfish, flawed abortion.”
“Uh huh.”
“Well, not everyone can be 7 feet tall like Sam.”
“That could be difficult but not impossible. We do have a feather brain in our mitts who could help.”
“You won’t?” That had been the main reason why Lana had never accepted any other Alpha after the courting period.
“I want my momma.” Jack begged tearfully.
Asmodeus grinned, feeling the fight brewing even from underneath his borrowed skin, “perhaps we should show this human what our father thought of his kind?”
“Jack gave me back all my memories. I remember placing lambs' blood on the doors in Egypt. I remember leading people to safety when the Catholics called for the death of anyone who dared to hold a different belief than theirs. So many times throughout history I rebelled against Heavens command for the human race. The last time was what got me claimed as a hero though. There was a human who was studying angels and our garrison leader, Ishim, became obsessed over her. Another angel, Akobel, protected her and her daughter from Ishim. Unfortunately Ishim did not give up easily. He managed to convince the host that Lily’s daughter was a nephilim and that the three were to be put to death. As soon as we came to carry out the order Akobel stepped forward to defend them. It was obvious looking at the child’s soul that she had no touch of angelic grace in her. I commanded everyone to lay down their weapons and they listened. Ishim was incensed and we fought. When we brought him before Michael the Archangel was fuming. He killed Ishim for lying, attempting to use his position for his own gain and for sharing heavens secrets with a mortal. Raphael allowed Akobel to stay with Lily and her daughter, supposedly to make sure that she never attempted to use what she learned about angels against us. And I was given command over the garrison.”
“Actually, I had an idea on how to connect all of that, if it pleases you of course.” Crowley leaned on one leg, a hand in his pocket exuding confidence as though he knew perfectly well his plan was foolproof. “Dean has one of if not the brightest soul I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been around for a long time. He’s caring, nurturing and raised his brother nearly on his own. I think, with your permission of course, that Dean could become your teacher on humanity and advisor on behalf of the humans on Earth. He could be a great asset to you.”
“Well then… good. See that you don’t.” He lifted his chin up haughtily. “I guess l’ll go kick out the Princes.”
Dean frowned at the tone. It was vague enough to have him worry while Cas was obviously trying to do the opposite.
Dean couldn’t take it anymore and climbed onto the bed pulling the boy into a tight hug he murmured into the nephilims temple. “I’m here Jack, you’re gonna be okay.”
“Eloquent as always Winchester, when do you wish to give them an audience my King?”
“What do you mean?”
Samandriel wrapped his arms around the Alpha, his own scent bursting with gratitude and happiness. “Thank you Sam, I won’t let you or Lana down.”
“Are you…” Her throat closed up.
Crowley’s eyes flashed red but Castiel didn’t bother to respond since the angel could easily kill the other. “Listen here you self-righteous bird brain I happen to like the bow-legged bastard and I care for the King and don’t want either to be hurt if Lucifer’s son loses control.”
“Yeah, an Omega twin. He’s an accountant and takes care of both of their businesses finances. Dean was never even tempted to be with him. He’s completely different from Cas and is like the perfect Omega as far as diplomas and education goes.”
], which is why he’s to be left alone in his room until it passes. He’s fine Dean.”
“So they’re Alpha-sexual? Okay, is that why he couldn’t find help? People can be so small minded; honestly, it’s not unheard of. Rare, sure, but not unheard of.”
“He’s taking me to court for full custody. He’d been trying to get shared custody since he moved in with Kate, but the witch I hired has been able to sway every judge we came across. I’m tired of wasting my money on her. I won’t let him take my boys. I want John and his family gone.”
Crowley’s eyes were far too calculating for Castiel’s tastes. “It’s his favorite food, since there’s no kitchen here he can’t really make it for himself. Is he inside with Jack?”
“Of course Dean, anything.”
Dean laughed at Cas’ dry delivery but was interrupted by an excited Jack before he could respond.
“You have no right to judge me!”
“They’ll see it as a dismissal.”
“So, what’cha doin’?”
Dean threw his jacket over the back of the chair, “so what’s this? You making us dinner now cause if so...fucking move in, please.”
“Dean and Cas want to mate me.”
“Morning Sunshine.”
“They’re mine, I birthed them. I stayed home with them and raised them while he worked. He spent our whole marriage never wanting to be home. And when he was, he’d rather drink than be an active member of my family. He doesn’t get to have some happily ever after now, live with a perfect family, and then take my boys from me while suddenly being the poster boy for sobriety. They’re everything to me.”
The Winchesters were excited to hear Samandriel accepted their offer to court him. Of course his father wasn’t thrilled that mated Alphas wanted his son. but he didn’t dare get in the way, not once the duo gifted the Omega their courting gift. It was a large and eye-catching jewelry piece that let everyone know Samandriel was being courted, and while the young man didn’t believe anyone else would be tempted to court him, he loved his gift. It was a silver middle finger ring with a black Chevy Impala etched into it, a thin gold chain connected the ring to the wrist, with three large white pearls hanging on the strand. From his wrist to just below his elbow the gold piece continued, this time covering his forearm in an intricate pattern that looked like a honeycomb.
Crowley eyed him flirtatiously, “spectacularly.”
Dri laughed at the Alpha’s exaggerated pout as Castiel walked in and saw his husband pouting.
Inside the room looked like a cross between a palatial bedroom and a toy room out of the old Ritchie Rich cartoons. There was a train set that was moving across the floor and up the wall on its own. Bookshelves that spanned a whole wall from floor to the cathedral ceiling. Toys and clothes strewn about the room, and a four poster bed with the curtains pulled back sat on the far wall near a window that somehow looked out to a sunny beach.
“You want me to be a farm hand?” He asked incredulously. He wasn’t a weakling, but he certainly didn’t have the build of someone who could do hard labor.
Castiel could feel his wings twitch with held-back aggravation, how dare these demons strut into Jack's throne room. He never wanted anyone to threaten his nephew but the angel just needed one good excuse to jam his blade into their necks. In truth he didn’t even require a good reason, just a passable one. No one would mourn them and anything Castiel did in service and protection of Jack was protected by both Heaven and Hell.
“I’m going to have to knock you out Dean, your body is going to go through a simultaneous and tremendous strain. You don’t want to be awake and feeling this.”
“You got me pie?”
“Are you going to help?”
“I’ve been waiting to be served for nearly an hour.”
“Castiel is still out with the hives.”
Dean could feel his face heat up as his shoulders rose so he could tuck his head lower, “stop it.”
At the end of the night Dean pulled up to Samandriel’s house dropping the Omega off.
“No, I’m proud of you and it’s about time you left Mom and started doing something you want. This is so great and the pay must be really great. That check you sent was incredible. I was able to afford the upfront fees on my new apartment thanks to it. You aren’t sending me the whole thing are you? I don’t want you thinking you need to use all your money on me. I do have a job.” He frowned at his brother, he had been meaning to call and make sure his self-sacrificing older brother wasn’t wasting all his money on him but now that they were together he could read Dean’s face and tell if he was lying.
Castiel’s posture changed as he stood taller and looked more authoritative. Dean was secretly pleased that the angel felt comfortable enough around him to let his guard down.
“Names Crowley and you, I have been wanting to meet.”
Samandriel stood in the middle of his living room annoyed and embarrassed as his father laid into him. He was already having a bad enough day having to go to his crappy job at the Weiner Hut, then the day got even worse. From several employees calling out, to young knot heads from the high school bothering him because of course his blockers ran out and he has such a baby face that no amount of telling the boys that he was too old for them made them stop and believe him. Then his manager had come and was aggravating him, ordering him to close that night even though that was 7 hours after the time Samandriel should have clocked out. They got into an argument and Samandriel threw a wet hot dog at the Beta before being fired. He had hoped to avoid his father but of course today of all days his father hadn’t left for work yet and was now reading him the riot act.
Jack smiled again, and Dean was oddly proud of himself for putting the boy at ease. “What job would you like?”
The man, Feathers, turned towards Dean, his cerulean eyes calculating and questioning as he seemed to look into Dean’s very soul. The human didn’t know what was found but the man tilted his head quizzically before giving an imperceptible nod. The large double doors slowly swung open on their own, revealing a bright throne room inside. The windows were filled with sunlight. Large sky blue drapes were pulled back and held in place by gold looking ropes. Dean followed Crowley and the man, making sure to not step off the light blue runner, to the large throne where a young teenage boy sat.
“What am I going to do with you Samandriel? You're twenty three years old, when are you going to start taking your life seriously? You can’t keep a job, you took a few classes at the center but you always quit before you can get certified in anything. If you don’t shape up and make something of yourself, you’ll never attract an Alpha of worth. No one of worth and class wants to mate a bum who's just going to sit at home and do nothing. Do you want to be some old Omega spinster living alone? Dying alone? Because I’ll be dead long before that happens and then you’ll have no one. You can’t count on friends because once they make their own families they’ll forget all about you. You keep fucking around and wasting time, you’ll end up mated to a trash bag. Someone who can’t provide for himself and will probably be a drunk. You’re not going to have a young face forever, the rest of your body will betray you with age. Your eggs will dry up, your skin will sag, and you won’t even have money to keep a roof over your head because you can’t hold down a job. Well, what do you have to say for yourself?”
Jack's grin was nearly blinding as he turned back towards Dean, “is it true Dean? You agreed to stay here and help me?”
“Crowley, what do you want?” Dean gulped at the stunning man's voice. It was deep and commanding and far too sexy to belong to someone in a trench coat.
“Sam gets left alone, no demons or Hellhounds or anything touches him. Ever! When he dies, in his old age, his soul takes my spot in Heaven.”
“Oh bugger, what now then?”
“None of you will have the throne. Ever! You will never keep the balance, you will never keep Heaven out of our business and you will all just fight with each other and destroy everything my father built. I am the rightful heir, I am my father’s son and I am a Morningstar. It wasn’t a title I bequeathed myself, it is a birthright. I’m glad you love Hell enough that you want the best for our kind, but I am what’s best. And I will not keep entertaining anyone’s delusions of grandeur to say otherwise.”
Crowley and Dean phased onto the middle of the Stanford campus quad, completely missed by all the students milling around. Dean turned himself around, taking in the bright, sun-filled campus and all the humans going about their day. He thought he’d never feel the touch of the sun’s warm rays on his skin ever again. For once he actually had the urge to lay down and sun himself, freckles be damned. Crowley looked around, ignoring Dean’s goofy grin as the human creeped out any students who passed by too closely to him. The demon sneered, seeing how many of the mortal students were dressed similarly to him. Of course none of them had their suits perfectly tailored, nevermind having the expensive name brand.
“Not possible. Heaven gave her up the moment she dug up the Crossroad. There’s nothing we can do for her. Well… there is one thing.”
“So what happens exactly?”
“The director, Mike, just reminded me we have a mated trio on staff here. It’s called a triad and the Alphas have to mate first to make sure the mating takes. Otherwise both Alphas will get territorial and could risk killing the Omega they share. So you see, even without knowing about you and what you guys would feel, they totally did the right thing. Have they been scent marking you?”
Dean felt something warm settle over him but checking his limbs, he saw nothing there. He looked back up at the supernatural creatures and gave them a half smile.
He could only shrug, “I’m a pretty good mechanic but...not really sure Hell has much need for cars. I’m pretty good at building things though and I’m a fast learner.”
“Oh how I’d love for this to be the type of deal we seal with a kiss. Those plush lips look delicious.”
The stocky built man in a dark black suit eyed him with a supercilious look. “Name’s Crowley, I’m here for Sam Winchester.”
“Hot pie is the best pie!”
“So this is the new tactic? The last time you had Dagon talking, droning on about how she should be helping to raise him so you can sit on the Morningstar throne?” Castiel glared at the demon. “It didn’t work then, this won’t work now.”
“Well yeah, he’s actually really cool and has been really helpful. You know, showing me the right classes to sign up for even though his department has nothing to do with law. He’s a sugar addict and loves pranks, maybe a little too much, but he’s a good guy. I think you’d really like meeting him.”
“Cas, there’s no such thing as a bad pie man…. it’s pie. They're all awesome.”
“Nah kid, I’m here to take my brother's place. Crowley says some job my brother was supposed to have is taken but he could offer me another.”
“Oh man it was so great seeing Sam. Hey, did you know Gabriel was Sam’s professor? Crowley says we probably don’t have to worry about him though.”
“You're the most beautiful creature I’ve ever seen. I’d be a fool to not be interested.”
“Why not let him take the boys? You’ll have more time to yourself.”
“I don’t believe he had a secondary designation, though if he did it would probably be Omega. He seemed very loving and community-oriented.”
“What about the oldest?”
“That’s great Castiel! Dean, as King of Hell, only child of Lucifer the Morningstar, I accept your conditions and agree to you, Dean Winchester, being the Official Ambassador and my tutor on humanity and Earth.”
“My deal, you said you read it.”
“His body is grown therefore he could impregnate someone
The Alpha’s smile was blinding as the scent of cedar and old books bloomed with his happiness. “Thank you, I like to think so. Her parents are going to be crushed though. Her dad seems to think I’m going to force Lana to quit acting and come be a home Omega.”
The pair continued eating, cleaning off their plates before cutting a more modest second helping. The hallway was silent except for the ting of forks hitting plates and pleased hums.
“Is he hurting?” Castiel looked off towards the door and the knot in Dean’s gut tightened. “Is he hurting, Cas?”
Castiel sat back, placing his fork on the now empty plate. He didn’t need to explain this to anyone. The other ones who mattered and needed to know were Jack and himself. But he found himself wanting to tell Dean. Wanting to confide in the human and trust in him to keep the information secret. Wanting the human to see why Castiel was worthy of his trust.
He gave her the chilling smile again, “you’re divorced. It was your idea, was it not? In fact, there’s a new Mrs. Winchester, isn’t there?”
Her instincts screamed to get up and leave, to turn back before she went too far; instead, she pressed on. Licking her dry lips, she repeated the incantation the witch had given her.
Jack gritted his teeth as another cramp forced him to tuck into himself. “I hate this.”
“Court me? Like in those Jane Austen books?” He glowered, sewing Cas’ intrigue, “what, I read!”
----------
Samandriel could hear noises in the background and Lana asking a man if he’d ever heard of two Alphas mating an Omega. “Oh my God, Dri, I’m so fucking stupid, I’m sorry.”
“I’m not sure, I sent word to Crowley to find out.”
“-It’s not much. Just, I was thinking ‘bout what you said about molecules. Thought I might have found a way around that, hopefully. Be a shame to be an immortal, celestial creature and never get to enjoy a slice of pie. That’s just cruel.”
“Yes, humans have a terrible habit of going against plans. It’s all that free will you were given. Nasty thing, causes you all to make such horrid choices.”
“Wow, I’m impressed.” He leaned over Dri’s shoulder to look at the pot, “so what are you making?”
“It sucks that everything tastes like molecules, but I’ll make sure to eat the whole thing in your honor, okay buddy?”
Sam laughed freely, throwing his head back in delight at unnerving his older brother who was known to flirt with everyone. “I’m actually seeing someone, I just like to freak Dean out. Sorry, but you are a very handsome man Crowley.”
“How dare you! Don’t you know anything about customer service? I demand a free jar for the terrible service I’ve received.”
Jack frowned watching the Princes enter the throne room. Three of the four had their heads up high acting as though they were royalty. The guards sneered at them and the young King found himself grateful for his people’s loyalty. It was something Crowley was constantly reminding him about, but it felt good to see it in action, the way the demon guards eyed the first demons distrustfully, as though the guards were ready to defend Jack with their lives if necessary.
“Those winged dicks wanted to end the world?”
“He’s in rut Dean, he can’t receive any visitors until it passes.”
“It is one. Dean likes pie?”
Castiel summoned his angel blade but Jack reacted even faster than the battle-hardened warrior of Heaven. He stood up off his throne, his eyes glowing gold as his 6 wings expanded as shadows arching on the wall. The trio dropped to their knees in agony, their bodies writhing as they screamed.
He watched from the doorway as she signed the papers detailing their prenup and how she was promising to mate the Alpha during her next heat. The young Alpha signed his name on each page promising the same, all the while staring back up at Lana as though she were a mirage that would vanish. He was genuinely happy for his cousin, she deserved to find love and it was obvious the young up-and-coming lawyer from her father’s firm was deeply in love with her.
“Hope I live up to the expectation.”
The Seraph snapped his head toward the nephilim, “reverse the spell now Jack!”
Recognizing the joke for what it was, Castiel chuckled. “This is just my way of saying thank you, for taking such good care of Jack.”
“Yes yes, your mother had them killed. Very tragic, very Shakespearean, but I actually have a lot to do so if you could just tell me where your brother is, I’ll be on my way.”
“My mother was a human, Kelly Kline. She made a deal and became pregnant with me. Humans can’t survive birthing Nephilims so she died during childbirth. Father took me in and raised me, and I thought everything was well. But Heaven was angry that Father had a child, even doubly so since his brothers were already pushing for an apocalypse.”
His emotions were going all over the place. First scared, then happy, then terrified and angry. He wanted this to be over, but he had to be smart about this; his family's souls were at stake.
“You’re married.”
Dean stared incredulously at the unflappable angel. “He’s a fucking toddler, how is he able to have kids?”
“Don’t we have to kiss?”
“That’s because he’s not a Beta,” Castiel ran a hand through Dean’s sweat soaked-hair as his own eyes began to bleed Alpha red. “You’ve created a male Omega.”
“Why? Is he hard to work for?”
Dean reached out placing his hand over the other man’s, a silent show of support.
Castiel raised an unimpressed brow at Dean, “and the stipulations would be what exactly?”
Shaking his head he went to walk towards the front door to leave when someone grabbed the back of his shirt and yanked him down. He cried out in surprise as something dragged him back towards the living room. He screamed in fear, his arms lashing out, trying to hit whatever had him in its grasp.
“Take me instead.”
“Why don’t you take your break now? I brought us some food from The Wayward Daughters booth. They brought the oven today and were able to make some pizzas. I got you spinach and bacon flakes with ranch and black olives.” Samandriel hugged the Alpha gratefully before sitting behind the booth to eat his food.
“I’m an Angel, once we make a deal we’re both bound to it.” He stuck out a long forked tongue, wiggling it obscenely as she turned her head, missing when he disappeared.
Castiel’s smile was nearly blinding, “yes, but now we’re aware of where it’s heading.”
“I won’t leave you, I promise.” Rocking them both, Dean did the only thing he could to soothe them both and sang “Hey Jude.”
The severity of the situation hit Jack as he screamed in fear. Tears were streaming down Jack's face, his eyes red-rimmed from crying. “I’m sorry Dean, I’m so sorry. Please don’t hate me, I didn’t want to lose you.”
“We are demons, so we only have demon-kind in mind, we don’t feel you can say the same… your majesty.” Asmodeus’ lips twitched to not sneer at the title, but the tone was obvious.
Dean wasn’t going to back down, even while standing in Hell in front of a demon, an angel, and whatever Jack was - he had to make sure Sam was safe. His brother's life was too important to throw away.
“Yeah, pretty much. But Lana, they’re so perfect together, how do I know I belong?”
“Lana, now there is an Omega who knew what she needed to do and did it. She got her education, she’s got a career, she’s made her money and made herself attractive enough that her father was able to arrange a mating with an Alpha of worth. Why can’t you be more like Lana?” When his son didn’t answer and instead continued to stare at the floor, he sighed defeatedly. “I have to get to work, take a shower and make yourself presentable. You don’t want to embarrass your cousin in front of her soon-to-be-mate smelling like hot dogs.”
“Why hadn’t you been home?”
“Don’t leave me.”
“You heard me, you poncey mountain of dicks. You said my soul was as bright as the pearly gates and while I don’t believe that, I do believe that makes it more valuable for Hell than my brother’s. Right?”
“Guards!” Castiel called to the guards staring at the scene from the door. “Take them away.”
“On one condition”
The job sounded amazing, he loved being outdoors and he had been obsessed with insects and Etymology when he was a pup. The thought that this Castiel was a terrible boss was the only reason he wasn’t accepting the offer outright.
His brother eyed him speculatively but whatever he saw he must have accepted. “Good, so have you visited Mom?”
Dean didn’t know how to read the room after voicing his conditions. Jack's eyes were wide and excited while Castiel just stared into him again.
The eldest of the Princes stepped forward, already trying to get everyone back on track after his brother’s public support of the boy King. “We feel you should abdicate the throne. Hell is at a crossroads, we could be very well looking at a civil war on our hands. Many don’t feel an infant should be leading us.”
“No, Jack is an Alpha. His body goes through rut twice a year so that he can sire a child. Angels and demons have a secondary designation that humans do not possess. Alphas are able to impregnate Omegas and some Betas. Omegas are able to be impregnated regardless of gender during their heats. And Betas closely resemble humans but are stronger and have a better sense of smell.”
“No problem sweetie, we’re all wishing you good luck from the set.”
“You are no such thing Samandriel! You are strong and kind, intelligent, empathetic and creative. You are sarcastic and quick witted, you are everything we never realized we were searching for.”
He rolled his eyes dramatically, with a snort. “Your soul was hell-bound the moment you buried that box.”
“Only if you stop calling me Alfie.”
Samandriel winced, seeing the time. His voice was thick with emotion that he tried to push down, “I need to get to Uncle’s house for Lana’s mating contract.”
“Why not look into being a stay at home Omega and taking home economics at the local college and some child raising courses? You hate math so maybe skip the home budgeting stuff.”
“Oh you know, got fired, Dad ranted and raved about how I’ll die alone and I’m not taking my future seriously. Same old.”
“Yeah but we’re also both interested in you. You gotta admit you fit in damn well with us.” Dean fidgeted in place, wanting to go to Dri to wrap the shocked Omega in a hug.
Dean looked down at the strange glowing symbol on his arm. It resembled a backwards F but the lines didn’t touch. His stomach was beginning to cramp but he ignored it to continue cradling his arm.
“Son of a bitch!”
Castiel frowned but shook his head, “Gabriel adores Jack and will never side with Heaven should they attempt anything. He does like to play tricks and tends to forget humans are more fragile than our kind. I’m sure everything is fine, he has been on Earth for eons now.”
She sneered at him, “no wonder you don’t have a bite or mating gift on. Who would want such a disrespectful, embarrassment of an Omega like you?”
“That would be my Hellhound, Juliet. Incredibly loyal, with an excellent pedigree, and a nose that can not be competed with. Apparently Sam isn’t here and his scent has been cleaned from the house.”
“Moose.” he sipped his drink as he eyed the young human’s muscular arms openly.
She rolled her eyes before dramatically flopping down on her vanity chair. “I don’t want to talk about the mating, it’s all anyone has talked about all week. Yes, I’m excited, of course I am. I adore Sam, but I’m also sad the courting period is over.” She played with the earrings dangling from her ear, the official courting gift that marked her as taken for anyone tempted to look; 6 hanging sapphires, surrounded by small cut diamonds all connected by white gold. “It’s stupid, I know, but it’s how I feel, so I want to focus on anything else. What’s new with you?”
Jack snapped his fingers, turning his oatmeal into an ice cream sundae. He giggled, stuffing the large spoon in his mouth, but neither of the two men reprimanded him. They knew Jack would eat a healthy lunch later and they wouldn’t argue if he wanted to do something different for once. Crowley walked in as Castiel and Dean took their seats at the table. Usually the three ate alone, but Crowley was the only demon allowed to come and eat with the Boy King.
“Dean is no longer human, he’s presenting.”
“Oh yeah, humans are very clever. It’s because you have free will, it opens your mind up to a world of new possibilities, and humans are driven to experiencing as much as possible. Castiel,” The young King pointed to the handsome man and Dean couldn’t help but be thrilled his name wasn’t actually Feathers, “has taught me a lot about humans and Earth, but our information has limitations.”
“I’ve missed you so much Sammy, God I’ve fucking missed you so much.”
“The King is in rut, tell Azazel and his siblings they will be summoned when their King chooses.”
“Kinda became a believer with the new job, or at least I realized I don’t have to believe the shit you hear at church.”
The morning after Jack's rut ended Dean walked into the sunlit dining room, fully rested and ready for things to get back to normal. He smiled seeing Castiel was already in the room, as per usual.
“How do you know I’m not him?” He crossed his arms across his chest, using his height and muscles to try and intimidate the other man.
Dean nearly fell to the floor in shock, “Cas is a spy?”
Dean rolled his eyes, “expecting everyone to have their lives planned out before they’re legally allowed to drink alcohol is stupid. We don’t care about that type of stuff Dri, but even so, look at all the awesome ideas you’ve had with the honey business. The new jars, the sample desserts, the website… I mean you’ve helped the business grow.”
He could make out Castiel’s figure by the door. The angel stood straight at attention, his hands clasped behind him as he guarded Jack's bedroom door. Walking up to him, Dean gave him a friendly smile. Cas was alright, a little stiff and didn’t get any of Dean’s frankly hilarious jokes, but the love and devotion between Uncle and Nephew was there. It did a lot to normalize Cas in Dean’s eyes, and adding in the fact that Castiel did try to make Dean feel more comfortable helped a lot as well.
Jack could feel the slight touch of Castiel’s grace, the signal they had so Jack knew his uncle agreed with something. “You are free to go Ramiel, from now on you will only be disturbed if I call on you specifically.”
Dean looked up from his fork in shock, “Princes? Did your dad have more kids?”
“My father created a spell, he had only used it once but I’ve made it better. I love you just as you are Dean, and I can’t lose you. I won’t.”
“Holy shit! What do you want?”
He shook his head as he sat back on her soft bed. “I don’t even know what classes I want to take. I find myself uninterested in most things or only slightly interested but not enough to base my whole life around this one thing. I love animals but I’m terrible at math and science, and I don’t have the stomach for euthanasia so can’t be a vet. I can’t deal with pushy customers so can’t be a dog washer or anything where the public can push me around. I love books but I’d be beholden to publishers and agents so writing is out. Can’t be a librarian because the classes are things I know I’d fail, like math and science, and I’d never have the money to get a masters degree.”
Cas placed his hands on either side of Dri’s head, just under his ears, and used his thumbs to rub the tears away from the young man’s cheeks. The Omega could feel Cas’ wrist rubbing against his neck, scent-marking him but assumed it was an accident. He’s a mated Alpha afterall.
Castiel tried to comfort the human but could do nothing more than awkwardly lay his hands on different areas of skin. He was shocked and horrified at the lengths and unnecessary risks his charge had taken on his boyfriend.
“So, the boys ratted you out to Daddy then?”
Samandriel had always been told his eyes were his best feature, which considering the plain packaging made sense. But his own ocean-blue eyes had nothing compared to Castiel’s crystalline hue. He had been eternally grateful that he had decided to wear his heat pad underwear that day and every workday since. It was the only thing strong enough to catch his overflow of slick and keep the smell muted.
Jack shuttered and struggled to turn back towards Dean. The lessons with Castiel on manners and proper behavior said to always face those you talk to.
“Actually, Castiel kept getting in trouble for disobeying orders. He’s quite rebellious, so they sent him here to spy on me under the guise of teaching me goodness.”
Dean tried to duck underneath Castiel’s arm but the angel was faster and wrapped him up in a bearhug from behind, lifting Dean until he could barely touch the floor. He tried to throw his head back to slam it against Cas’ but the angel ducked behind Dean’s shoulder. During the commotion the door opened and both men froze as Jack looked out from the small opening.
“Moose and squirrel? Really? Okay, should I call you Boris or Natasha?” Sam shot back cheekedly.
“How’d they even know about me?”
“Feathers, how nice to see you. I was going to call for you, this concerns you as well.”
“No, not Dean. He’s a good boy, responsible, quiet-natured and dutiful.”
Crowley bowed low as Feathers took a place standing beside the boy, looking very much like a royal guard regardless of how unimpressive his body was as far as fighting went. Not wanting to disrespect anyone, Dean tried to bow as well. Peeking his head up he noticed the barely-there smile on Feathers and the large grin on the boy, and assumed he’d passed some sort of test.
“What’s rut? Is it like an infection or something?” Dean’s mind was already jumping to try and remember the tomato rice soup recipe so he could make it for the young boy.
-“demon, yes. Thank you for finally getting up to speed. Where is Mary Campbell?” He pulled out a scroll of aged parchment and read it over to himself ignoring a fish mouthed Dean.
“Making Dean wait for the pie until it’s cool?”
“Crowley told me it was your favorite, but I wasn’t sure about which flavor.”
"Touching..." Castiel gestured at her hand as he considered her. He bit his underlip. Her palm made his body tingled in both fear and excitement. "I can't, not so soon." Anna moved her hand away from his shoulder slowly.
"I, uh, I have no such intentions," his voice sounded nervous to his own ears. He redirected his gaze at Dean once again. His grin gone from his face and Castiel wanted to have it back. But he waited.
"Soon," Sam said muttering. "Before then, not tell anyone about it. If you ever need me, call me by this phone number," Sam found a pen from the huge pile of magazines, he wrote the emergency number down and gave it to Haziel. "Only use it when you have to, okay?"
He walked up to the back door. Dean pushed slowly the door open. He recognized Bobby's low and intense voice from the living room. Dean quickened his pace. His shoes made small noises against the floor.
The room around dimmed and his focus was a hundred percent on Cas, Cas stillness was the same response back. The tension was thick in the air so thick that a butter knife wouldn't be able to cut through it. His hand laid on Cas's arm, unmoved. For some reason, a new feeling spread in his chest, Dean wasn't sure if he liked it or not.
The last fifth-teen minutes went in a blur, in no time he made himself ready to appear on stage. Dean's hand gripped around the microphone, his excitement was shown in his green eyes. The curtain went slowly upwards revealing Dean in his military jacket, blue jeans, and a black t-shirt.
Dean blinked. What?
. "Why do you care anyway? You could have killed me ages ago," Dean said. The mouth seemed to work on its own. An intuition he guessed. Had saved his life more than once.
He ignored Dean's yelling and started the car. In this, his only choice was to get away. Sam moved the impala out on the way while he began to check for the road he would use most of his day. His hands turned white when he clenched his hands on the wheel. This day was his last and he knew it. Tonight, his efforts would either succeed or not. He bypassed the happy people on the streets, most having the phones up in their noses.
Dean frowned. Castiel put his palm on his shoulder and they zapped out to somewhere outside the main city center. If he cared enough, he would know where. People talked animated to their kids, others walked their dogs. Cars drove past them, but by the crowd's expression, Dean knew Castiel had made them unseen. A handy trick he didn't mind stealing. For the greater good. Then Dean noticed a high tall brown-haired man walking in their direction.
"I understand. Are you asking me to...get a friend?" Castiel asked curiously.
"And she's buying a stairway to heaven." Dean finished singing and took a deep breath. He stared startled at Castiel and put his guitar against the wall. Dean rubbed his neck "Hey Cas,"
It became echoes of excited fans jumping up and down in pure bliss. Others started to cry. "Dean Winchester is my name and I am here to share my songs from the new album
Then...
"It did," he said. "The monsters still want to work with us considering they already know the deal between Castiel and hell. It would be wise to reconsider their offer," Haziel said as he shrugged. He glanced in between them and took a deep breath. "I am aware this is not what you want but is the only decent option at this point. We need every force we need against the enemy."
His eyes stared into his. "People find refugee in my music because they feel someone
he thought to himself. His hand took one part of his flannel towards his ear when the cloth reached his nose he made a disgusted face. Dean made a weird noise in the back of his throat. Quickly he walked into his room again and did his normal daily routine. The pills had slowly begun to work inside his body that way lessened the pain in his head.
They walked in together. Immediately the flashes of light momentarily made him blind. Rows and rows of seats were in the room, Dean cleared his throat. On top of a black table that was wide enough to him and Cas to be on where they stood. On top of it were two microphones. Dean walked over to it. He scolded his face so nobody in the room could tell what went through his mind.
. He stood up and walked into the bathroom.
Castiel rose from the chair, his eyes blazed with fury. "I won't involve any more people in this, I swore I wouldn't!" Cas snapped. He was about to turn away when Dean gripped his arm.
coming interviews for Dean's new plate as he answered "This is important for your future, Dean, being famous is hard work. Did you buy food? We are running low on beer again."
"Stand up to the Father, chose the way to freedom," Anna insisted. "Help yourself so you can help others."
"I know. Dean, I have a business to do this week. The car is fine and I have it," Sam lied. He got the reaction he expected but it hurt anyway. He wished deeply to tell his big brother why he was doing this. But then, Dean saw him as a freak. Sam unclenched his hands from the wheel and walked out of the car. His blue and yellow flannel covered for the wind. He used the keys to lock the car.
"I can't imagine a life without you in it," she said, she sniffed.
"You are the once and future king. The blood you have can confirm it. Don't be sad, Moose. I am not done yet. It came to my knowledge, you got demon blood in your veins since the fire where your parents died, isn't that right?" The man crouched to his level. He had brown hair as Magnus but his attitude showed Sam he dealt with a far stronger demon than he was used to.
"You are joking, right?" Dean's voice light yet his eyes betrayed him of the fear that filled his heart. He recognized the look, he wore it himself. Dean's hands shivered, Sam had no idea if Dean knew he was doing it. Sam put his hands on the table.
Dean blinked. Laugh made him move so he stared directly at Cas's eyes. The dark blue irises looked through him at his soul. Dean's face flushed and he rubbed his backhead. Back then they had been foolish and naive. But Dean learned more since then. Dean moved strands of Cas's ebony hair from his face. "No dude, I am a dead man remember?"
He saw Dean fall on top of his bed and press the pillow towards his face. Sam heard barely audible what Dean was mumbling.
in her hand. Her small mouth opened in shock. Dean immediately knew from the flash in the girl's eyes when she glanced at them twice before a short blink of light before the
"That is not true, his very soul was made for this purpose, he is the kind that can save us, do it," the rude guy hissed. Dean considered opening his eyes before he managed to do that a hand caressed his forehead.
"I have information for you," Haziel began, his voice grave. His hand tight on Castiel's arm. "You can not open the paper before the time is ready. Dean has the key to solve it all, he will know once he read it. Before that, you got to be sure Dean never knows. He is still under the control of our enemies."
"What happened to you?" He asked the curiousness got the best of him. Sam knocked a woman out with his bare hands before turning in his direction.
"What if I do?" Dean's eyes narrowed. He stepped back until his back was against the wall. Castiel looked surprised at Dean.
He frowned.
"Hello, Dean, nervous about your last concert this year?" Gabriel smiled and patted his back. His champagne-colored eyes meet his.
"You did everything I told you?" Father asked the archangel.
Questions evolved into a loud throb in his skull. The halls were lit up in white light bulbs over his head. Angels avoided looking straight into Dean's eyes, others (higher-ranking ones that were) greeted him. On the third floor, they had spare clothes where Dean was heading. The suit irked him to no end at this point.
"He knows how pain is, I will warn you now. Don't get too close," Anna leaned away from him, her body tensed up. "You will understand in the future where more is at risk than ourselves."
That caught Dean's interest. This was an important intel he had to tell Michael later. Haziel leaned forward over the table. His eyes two intense balls of intentions. Dean picked up his sword ready to stab if he needed to do so. "Yes, we are," Haziel said.
Dean's memories passed before his eyes. When Sam took his first steps towards him before he fell to the ground. He cried. Then, his mother gave him an apple pie to eat. The sweet savor on his tongue like he remembered it. John took him to his T-game. To watch his dad be proud when his team managed a win.
"Cas?" Dean asked as he moved quickly forward. The second their eyes locked Anna's eyes seemed to lit a few degrees lighter blue however it was gone.
"He still owes me from the time in New York." Dean high-fived the people he was passing. Around them, there was furious activity, people snapped short commands at each other.
Anna opened her mouth to respond but Haziel had returned. Castiel quickly noticed he had a bulge in his clothes but chose not to comment on it. He nodded in acknowledgment instead. "Haziel."
Father and Micheal exchanged a worried glance at one another. Dean waited. To say he was impatient was an underestimate. He didn't move a limp before he heard what Father told him.
"Killing makes you feel great and if you don't, you feel like hell. The Mark won't let you die, is a curse God decided to give me. Really nice? Giving it to his favorite?" Lucifer's voice turned dark by his last words.
"If it's lightening up someone's day, I am glad to take that role," Castiel took a new sip from his glass, he avoided looking into Dean's eyes. Suddenly he felt wary.
"Yeah every single thing, tied his shoes too, I had no idea I could do that," Dean said while he tried to refrain from laughing at the funny picture it created in his head. Micheal didn't seem to be too happy about it so Dean grinned in a thin line instead.
Raphael showed no surprise on his face. "I didn't," he said.
He pointed his finger at the sky before he continued. "I didn't know where you went, still your screaming is heard in my head. Day in. Day out." He let the despair into his voice. Dean opened his eyes and let his microphone swipe over the cheering crowd before he began singing into the microphone again. "Kicking we fell down the sky, only our souls safe in God's hands. Let's go down screamin', screamin', screamin'. For the lord."
"Hello, you made it," Sam answered. On purpose he left out the name of the angel, it took enough risk as it was to meet him. He lifted his hand from the blade, it stank from the angel. He knew better than show so. Sam turned toward the angel, a smile still on his face. "I know is a lot to ask, but are the archangels on our side? I am pretty sure Crowley won't like it."
"And where do you see yourself, ten years from now?"
He stared back at the interviewer. "Dead," Dean hissed.
Dean took one of the chairs available and sat down in front of him. He folded his hand together on the desk, Dean sat silently some time before he spoke up. "I know, no, I didn't be taking a ride because Baby needed it." He checked his phone in his palm.
"Hey Bobby," Dean smiled and walked in. He looked around in the small doorway. "Where is Sammy?" Dean asked curiously. "He is always on time." His eyes moved around the room, he frowned. Usually, his brother was on time, always. Dean's eyes landed on Bobby.
Dean rolled his eyes. Once Dean stood behind his brother's desk the paper seemed to disappear and he couldn't see it anywhere.  "Are you looking for something?" Sam continued. He shrugged before he took up his phone just in that second he received a message from Cas. Dean's finger hesitated over opening the message.
Sam thought to himself. "There has been killing that the media haven't been able to solve. Dean is better off without knowing. His schedule is busy enough as it is already."
Castiel's breath heaved. "What have you done to me?" He said through grit teeth.
Cas frowned in confusion while Dean lifted his gaze to Cas. "It's written by Sam Winchester, my little brother. He gave it to a man named Haziel told him it was important I got it. The amulet only works once and it can make me human again. I lose all my powers," Dean said excitedly. Before Cas started to interrupt him Dean continued. "It should work that you aren't a God anymore."
Sam leaned against the benches. He held the sword in his hand roughly. Castiel noted to himself that at some point, Sam's hand shook from the sword. "Well, exciting times. You saw Dean?" Sam asked.
"Better than being hiding and feeling alone. The choice is yours," Anna said, she leaned closer to him. "A choice is better than following a father's orders."
"Well, what do we have here?" A woman's soft voice almost right beside him.
That left Crowley with him and Lucifer, Sam knew how to play the manipulation trick after observing Lucifer for months when they discussed hell's morals and functions (also how Father was a big sack of dicks).
Dean's laugh when Castiel didn't understand the gay joke. When they watched
Magnus moved close to Crowley's head, though, he whispered hurriedly. Crowley nodded before he said, "Go and fetch me some wine." Then both vanished from thin air.
Dean really wanted to find out who the fuck talked. As far as Dean knew, the guy was an ass. Dean stopped moving when he heard the next sentences. His blood ran cold in his veins. "He also got your amulet, a sign Sam did his end of the bargain. Even when he didn't know."
He lowered his voice to a low whisper when he ended the song on a strong note. "My prayers shattered God since he was no more. I won once and for all. You thought you won? Oh man, there is no truth to be told. Let's go down screamin' for the lord."
"Can I...Ask you about your music?" Castiel asked nervously. He pushed his glass towards Bobby, he nodded at him.
? Dean thought as he leaned against the door. His little brother hadn't heard him yet. He stood there for a few moments before he took a deep breath.
Sam ended his phone call to the king of hell. The place he was in, is a regular meeting place for demons. The building was gray, music blasted loud enough to make Sam wince. Lights shone in neon colors. Green. Red. Blue. And repeat. The building was black as the sky above. The blazes made it yellow higher up.
The hours went by quickly Dean forgot life for a moment with all the worries. Dean got so into the music he only realized he should stop when Sam put his hand on his shoulder. He parted with his girlfriend(saying goodbyes and all) before he and his brother went looking for the interviewer.
He blinked surprised to Anna before he folded his arms on the desk. His heartbeat rapidly in his ribcage and he focused on calming down. "I am sorry, I didn't get that."
," he begged.
Dean looked over his shoulder, huge gray wings spread behind his back. The muscles cracked from not being used. Dean huffed. A strange force rolled through his veins. Dean was ready to take on the world. Raphael gave him a pointed glance.
Sam sighed. He put up his laptop again and began to search for the magazine wanting to interview his brother for his massive success in the music industry. It fascinated people how such a broken man could make so heartful songs if only they knew how true the songs were. Often when they recorded Sam had to keep himself from crying. The songs were about losing their parents, the struggle after, how Bobby became like a father to them. It was all there between the notes.
"Only my brother get to call me that," Sam hissed through grit teeth. His Blade moved on his own account, he sliced Lucifer from the shoulder blade and down to his hip. A scream shattered the powerful sounds from flames far below. "Cut the bullshit."
Later, 12:00 in the night, he arrived back at his home. Its well-known place was not the home Sam referred to but his brother. He walked up to the house and went in. Sam hide away the bag, book, and other important weapons from his hunt into its place. He found his comfortable bed and sighed. The dream still bugged him from the back of his mind.
"I am not in love with him!" Dean snapped. He clenched his fists and tried to calm down his beating heart. Dean felt Sam's hand squeezed his shoulder and he looked up at him. He bit his underlip. "He is innocent, I-I don't want him to be taken into this—" Dean pointed at Sam's closed laptop."Messed up life," Dean finished.
"By not giving him a choice? You could've told him years ago. Hell is no joke, Sam. Those that survive will not be the same person, the demons will change you. You need to talk before it's too late—"
The room had a holey carpet were worn out from the times they had walked over it. The brown packages stood leaning towards the wall. They were in all kinds of sizes. Big, small, wide, narrow, and square. He gripped hold of the package at the top and began working.
"I have other callings, and this isn't mine, Haziel," he said each word slowly.
Dean ran up to the highest point of the stage. He sang the chorus once again, this time with his fans. It warmed his soul in words he couldn't describe.
Dean thought.
Lucifer tsked. "You would have been a good lawyer, Sam. You sure got the guts and anger for it. I will give you three days and I want the answer. Yes or no. No maybes. That's not how hell works," Lucifer said before he too vanished into thin air.
More murder and less thinking. "I am fine and God? Just a jackass," Sam shrugged. Lucifer and Crowley exchanged a glance. He really wanted to get hold of a gun. Sam's hand twitched to use one, the possibilities to blow a person's brain out were endless.
"Guys, might want to move into the bar where we are actually going?" Sam asked politely.
Castiel attempted to convince himself. His eyes were blown wide and he tried to get enough air into his lungs.
"Could you be more boring?" Dean said sarcastically. "I was just getting to the good part." He noticed a cameraman filmed him and Dean winked. Afterward, he licked his lips. The band had begun to appear on stage, from each crew member the fans screamed higher.
He flinched when he heard the barks from the hellhounds, Sam stumbled a few steps backward. His hazel eyes dilated, his breath came out in short gasps. The moonlight shone the place in a halo, a sense of end reached him. The paws of hounds hit the surface, it could be more than one. Dean's eyes met his. Confusion and terror ran through them both. However, Sam was the only one capable of hearing them.
Sam shrugged. "I became a knight of hell, and you?" Before each sentence, he cut off a random person's head while doing a strong flicker with his hand. It extended into the sword and it killed people like ants.
Sam calculated that Balthazar, in reality, wanted him to say no but he was showing to him he would. "Yeah, show the way," Sam waited until Balthazar did. They ended up in the outskirts of the town.
"I want to heal my cancer." Stated Sam.
Being an agent for a rockstar had its positive sides; he got direct access to most of his brother's social media. On the other hand, keeping secrets would be harder since they lived practically on top of each other. His hazel eyes scanned through the page he was reading. A frown appeared on his face.
Dean bit his under the lip and laughed. Castiel stared confused at him. "What's the matter?" He couldn't keep himself from asking.
From behind another hellhound gripped hold of his hair and threw him down. He groaned of pain by the impact, in his vision, he saw Dean attempting to reach him but another hellhound quickly cast Dean to the wall. Dean slumped to the side and the ground. Blood dripped from Dean's temple.
Then Castiel's hands surrounded his cheeks. Dean walked unsure a few steps backward. For a moment the world spun around them both before Dean's back hit a tree. Six leaves fell to the ground. Castiel did not stop staring straight at his very being. Dean gulped, all his focus at the enemy before him.
Sam cleared his throat and everyone stared at him. "Guys, the press won't go easy on either of you. Both have to make the right choice, no matter how hard that might be. I trust you to handle this as adults and not create more of a mess we already have got it?" He informed them. In his gut, he had a feeling what was going to happen next. He refused to let the thoughts control his emotions either way.
Lucifer's eyes glowed in sparks of scarlet colors. "
Crowley moved her coat and revealed a weird looking sword. It was bowed in an awkward position and seemed more like teeth than a weapon Sam had ever seen in hell. Crowley put his palm around it.
"The music industry isn't known to be welcoming to gays and has again and again destroyed careers for musicians that identify themselves as such. Are you aware of the reputation you are giving your..." Jenna stopped and turned a page in her notebook. "Lover?" Jenna finished.
Slowly — he walked over to one of the mirrors in a bathroom two doors down. Took his time before Dean had the courage to look into the surface. The clothes didn't change how he saw himself, yet Sam's words echoed in his head;
. A grin spread on Sam's face by the title. Quite ironic the demon that was supposed to have written it had never taken a step into the higher-ups of hell. Crowley gets his tastes for sure.
"I am wondering, Sam. What did you choose?" Lucifer asked as if he wondered which cake Sam would decide to buy. He leaned closer to him. His eyes for a second light red color that gleamed. Lucifer shrugged and turned around. "This is exciting!" Lucifer placed his hands on Sam's shoulders.
, worry spread in his chest.
A group of people talked loudly together, clearly already drunk. The girls giggled and one of them brushed her blonde hair from her eyes before she winked at him. Castiel's eyes widened in surprise and he turned away. His heart raced in his chest, fear spread like wildfire. He noticed Bobby's hands in his line of view and looked up.
Just to test it, he summoned a demon once, to his surprise. He really came. Dean shook his head. His eyes were red from the crying he did every night. Dean heard his phone ringing and saw Cas's name on the display. He didn't bother to answer. The clatter from his beer bottles in the back took his attention back.
He cleared his throat and knocked on the door.
Father nodded. "Yes, it's a mission waiting for you, but you need to complete Raphael's tasks before that," he turned away. Then vanished as he was never there.
Castiel thought worried. Thirty minutes later they had managed to get into their rooms. It was still a while before they would reach California. Sam and Camilla shared rooms while he and Dean stuck in this tense space. Dean sat on the bed and surfed throughout the channels. Dean wore blue jeans with a flannel shirt having red and blue colors. He looked...adorable.
A silence fell upon them. The phone made sounds again, he flinched. Castiel's hands turned into fists and he breathed heavily through his nose.
About 169 messages were on his phone and not just from Cas or Bobby but everyone he knew. He closed the phone and put it back in its place but not before he sent Cas a message where to go. Then he turned to the guards again. "What are you doing here?"
"Wait!" Dean held his breath as he waited for Cas to leash on him. His heartbeat fast and his eyes dilated. "What happened?"
"I know a place," Balthazar stated while they walked out. "It's where the newest victim lost her life, are you sure you want to go?"
Sam’s all sensitive and pro-people doing whatever. He’d get his big sad eyes on, and want to go over every little thing he’s ever said to Dean that might have hurt his feelings. Everyone would walk on eggshells around him, afraid to say something wrong. And what if Dean doesn’t care? Is he supposed to start policing people now? Does he have to go around telling
There’s Cas. An arms length away. He’s laying on his cot, not breathing. His skin doesn’t look so sickly, and he’s not pouring light out of his wounds anymore. In fact— there was a cut on his cheekbone, that had been lit up from inside, and it looks like it scabbed over. Cas doesn’t breathe, so without the glow of grace, the vessel looks like a corpse. But there are no scorch marks under him from Cas’ wings burning out. He’s probably not dead.
“It would burn you to a husk,” Cas growls.
“Whatever it was, it was enough that Cas could feel it,” Dean says, “he dropped in right after I found you.”
“Not if it gets you killed,” Dean insists, “I thought you were
“But sometimes you say shit,” Dean points out, “and I—”
Dean’s pretty sure Benny’s coming onto him, again. He’s done it a few times now, no matter how many times Dean reminds him that he’s not queer. It’s not fair that Benny is hot enough to make Dean consider his offers. With his broad shoulders, his big thighs and his ease with a blade, he’s basically a dream come true. It’s a bonus that he’s dangerously smart, and funny when you least expect it. Dean likes the smell of him when Benny lends him his coat to sleep in.
“Okay, you said you were coming back with answers,” Dean butts in.
Dean looks at himself. Sees the failure he is. He’s all that Sam has. And Sam deserves so much better, but the universe left him with Dean.
The fabric bunches between his fingers as he squeezes. Cas is why they’re in this mess. He’s the one who hurt Sam, who promised to fix him if Dean just stayed out of his way. Dean should hate him. Anyone who lays a hand on Sam is dead to him. That’s the rule. Dean’s job in life is to take care of Sam, and Dean welcomed Cas in like a friend. Like family. Opened his trust to let Cas in, and Cas went and hurt the only thing that matters in Dean’s life.
Sam swings his gun to aim at the next angel.
As we come up on Amy's storyline, I wanted to remind everyone that I intended both TEA and TBAM to be "intro" stories to the 'The Love It Takes' universe I'm establishing, and as such there are a few plot points I'm dropping in now, with intention to wrap up in future works. Also like, oh hey, a wound in Sam's palm??? That bleeds?? What could that be?! [eyes emoji]
“Why?” Dean demands. What the hell does Cas have against Dean kneeling—
Dean reads up on depression. On suicidal thoughts. Bobby gives him some of the stuff he’d read, links to sites he’d researched following all the trouble with Sam. Most of it says to go to a professional, but Dean doesn’t think that’s ever going to be a possibility for him, Sam or Cas.
Wait.
Dad wouldn’t talk about it. Dad would’ve put Sam out of his misery.
“Get out of bed,” Death says, “we need to talk.”
of losing Cas.
"Angel airlines," Dean agrees, and holds up his hand before Cas can touch him. He fires off a quick text.
“Yes sir,” Sam and Dean say immediately. It’s a hunter’s farewell. Agree to a future, against all odds. Dean lays down on the second cot beside Cas, turns his head to look at him. What the fuck are they even doing. Cas said whatever Sam is about to try is impossible, has never been done before. Use Dean’s soul, a human soul, to try and patch Cas up? It sounds like apples and oranges.
“Why?” Dean asks.
Sam grins, tucks his hair behind his ear with his free hand, “Of course. Wow— you’re strong.”
, Sam. Cas had to keep telling me to call you back, something about anchors or some shit, and I thought you were dead, or dying in my arms again—”
“We can’t afford a fire,” Benny says, “we’d get spotted.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He should shove Benny off him. Tell him to go fuck himself. Dean wants to pull him in, grind against his thigh like Dean’s a teenager and like Benny isn’t a cold, undead vampire who could rip his throat out.
He doesn’t have the car. Dean’s trapped here, being obnoxiously queer in Bobby’s house.
“Yeah.”
“Stay if you wish,” he relents, “but I didn’t bring enough to share.”
“You can’t,” she argues.
Cas scowls at him, “This feels complicated. The point is to touch
“I don’t eat,” Cas says.
Sam bares his teeth at Death and then— oh shit, his eyes are bleeding again!
“I know,” Dean says.
Before Dean can react, Cas adds, “I understand you were malnourished and physically exhausted, but you slept well when I watched over you.”
With his matted hair and pale, sweaty skin, Sam looks like a body they found in a ditch. Bobby cleaned off his face, so he’s no longer covered in blood, and got him out of his wet clothes and wrapped up in blankets.
They start arguing about doing the dishes, because they
That’s a work in process thought. He’ll refine it as he goes.
Bobby’s tidying up his kitchen since the three of them have taken over the living room.
you Dean, but desire and destruction are the same thing to something like me. I’m scared of what I’ll do to you if I give in to it.”
“I almost ruined the world. I nearly annihilated heaven,” Cas says, “I—
Dean has spent years now twisted up over being queer. Spent weeks trying to bury everything he felt about Benny, about Cas. Spent weeks
“What’s in the bag?” Dean asks, if only to get Death to stop looking at Cas or Bobby.
Dean sucks in another ragged breath.
“Dirty,” Cas calls back, “but no glass. You can put Sam here.”
Cas says nothing, just watches him and waits for Dean to keep talking.
Dean steps out from behind Cas, putting himself between Cas and the angels. He’s taking point on this, and he wants to be clear that these angels are
Sam teases Dean about it. He thinks it’s funny that Cas is clearly more fond of Dean, than of him. Tells Dean to enjoy Cas being ‘clingy’, like it’s a romantic thing. Dean tells Sam to can it.
“You got an anniversary we can celebrate?” he tries.
He doesn’t have to talk to Bobby for a while, so hopefully it’ll be considered a slip up and Bobby won’t think to comment on it next time they talk.
And yet Dad’s ghost hangs over Dean so heavy that Dean feels like he could choke.
“I didn’t realize the hour,” Cas confesses, “I know how you humans feel about getting sleep. I thought I would wait.”
. Cas is forgiven because Dean wants him around, wants Cas by his side forever. Cas is his best friend, Cas is his, and Dean’s never letting him go.
“I wish I could be more helpful,” Cas admits, “I feel like dead weight that you and Sam have to—”
seen anything on this kind of scale. Not even that exploding shit Sam did with Naomi was like this.
See y'all on Sunday <3
Sam thinks on it a moment too long, before he sighs, “Sure. Yeah.”
Sam gives Dean an odd look.
That’s gonna put the three of them on the pullout, unless Dean goes to sleep by himself. Which is not happening.
“Oh my god,” Sam realizes. There it is. Sam looks so funny when he’s grossed out.
“A unique song, that is always evolving. I like it at all times. But I like it best when you’re happy.”
Bobby turns away from them to make the order. And now it’s Dean and Cas, alone for a moment since this whole nightmare started.
“Sam’s body was so badly damaged that restoring him entirely might have been worse. I assume he’ll recover slowly, like when he went blind from touching my grace,” Cas says.
“Oh,” Cas says, and he looks down at his hands, and then back at Dean, “you’re singing… for me?”
“Lucifer. What about him?” Sam orders.
Dean is unsuccessful in pulling his weapon out. Benny gives him a nudge to move over, and with a good heave of vampire strength, pulls it clear.
“I’m an angel,” Cas says, “I’m known to the leviathans— they and everything here are hunting me!”
“That’s a lot of blood on his face,” Dean grimaces, “did his eyes… you know?”
“Yeah, you are,” Sam argues, “you’re
“Why the hell hasn’t she been in touch?” Dean demands, “it’s been months!”
He’s got his brother, and he’s hunting. He’s got Cas, and their nights together.
“And you’re also the only reason it didn’t get blown to hell when Michael and Lucifer duked it out,” Dean reminds him, “this is free will, and sometimes it kinda sucks.”
Andrea catches Benny’s body before it hits the ground.
in here that Dean is supposed to pick up on, “what we were, happy or not, didn’t matter too much to him except as tools to fill out the life he wanted. And when he wanted to like us, to play the family man, things were good. They were great. I loved him so much, and I wanted to be his good son, but I could have never lived up to his expectations. He was obsessed with something we could never be. Would have ruined our lives with his shit. The only freedom for me and mine was through his death.”
No, they haven’t. Angels patch themselves up, or they die. The only in between was on the road to the apocalypse, when Cas was losing his grace.
It makes him too casual, too trusting. He and Cas meet up, at random times now, just to talk. It’s stupid, Dean should be sleeping, but he finds himself stepping out of his motel to meet Cas in the middle of the night anyways. They talk about all the things that Dean was never able to talk about before. All the things he can’t talk about with Sam, because Sam doesn’t seem to understand him anymore, and that distance between them scares Dean. Dean knows what he became in hell. But he was a lowly grunt, subject to the same tortures as everyone else.
“And Dean?” Bobby catches him, “you come back with an apology. Don’t you
Sam is here, is
“What is that?” she asks, and points at his food.
“Why? What happens there?”
. Dean needs to adjust.
This story will update on a weekly schedule at (roughly) the same time every Sunday and Wednesday. So see you then!
Dean tries for a hail mary, hands Sam the half-empty tub of bougie peanut butter. The one that Bobby insisted on buying for him months ago.
Go reblog on tumblr and spread the love!!! (and leave kind words in your tags)
Dean shakes him. He’s going to slap him— something to startle Sam out of this.
It’s like when he touched Cas’ wings.
And it’s sitting there, in the dark, with his brother and his arm around Cas, that Dean realizes he
“You worried about him?” Bobby asks, nodding to the living room where they left Cas’ vessel.
And speak of the devil, Benny ducks into the cave. He’s carrying a body under one arm.
Sam punches him in the shoulder.
Dean rubs a hand down his face, wishes he had a drink. Their
“You trying to let me down easy?” Benny asks.
They had a close call with Dick Roman’s goons. Dean’s gotta get them out of the state.
Dean swallows before he can speak, “More— more heaven shit? Like… the order to stick with me?”
“What are your lines?” Cas asks.
“Leviathans hunger, for eternity they will try to satiate that need but they never will. They were designed to eat everything, and to never be satisfied. And I…” Cas breathes through his mouth, like he’s run laps, “I hunger for
Dean shakes his head. Should he use a line about Cas being his first? Is that weird? Or would Cas find it hot?
Dean doesn’t know which way Sam’s gonna go. Is Sam gonna take a go at Death? Run off? Do something else insanely powerful that Dean doesn’t know about?
It’s a nightmare getting Sam up the stairs. Man weighs a ton, and he’s soaking wet. Dean’s the young guy in comparison to Bobby so Dean has to be the one to do the fireman’s carry. It’s not like Dean isn’t prepared to do this, he always makes sure he’ll be able to carry his partner out of a dicey situation. It’s just that he doesn’t want to.
“Yeah,” Dean groans. He gets through pouring two cups, hands them to Cas, and pushes them to the table. Bobby kicks one of the chairs out of the way so Cas can stay in the wheelchair and sit at the table. This is going to be awkward and
He said it all. He loves Cas. It’s true, it’s his truth, and it felt so right. And now Dean feels like an idiot. He showed his hand, again, and Cas got the better of him. Is Dean always going to be blindsided by Cas? Cas has the unique ability and position to be in Dean’s inner circle, and continue to hurt him, because Dean can’t help but love him?
“What the hell was that?” Bobby asks, “what kind of upgrade did Sam do to you?”
“You did something really cool,” Sam butts in, “with that machete— could you, maybe you should come by and show us sometime. I could use some work on my technique.”
Dean holsters his gun and drops down to his knees to shake his brother. Sam’s bleeding from his mouth, his nose, his ears, and a large amount from his eyes. But he’s breathing.
“So what are we doing?” Benny asks, “you’ve proven that you care about Cas. You’re killing yourself to find him. But at some point you need to save yourself.”
Sam rolls his eyes. Cas finally attempts a small bite. He chews for too long, and both Sam and Dean watch him like hawks.
Welcome back! Thank you everyone for the kind words last chapter <3 And I hope you're as excited as I am, because we are headfirst into the finale of TEA!
“Sam you scared the shit out of me. I almost lost you, and I can’t— I can’t do it again.”
kick you out for this, and I’m gonna hug you til you feel it!”
Classic Dean, always a disappointment.
Sam wants to talk about this. Cas wants to listen.
See him? Like— how? Dean assumes it’s a good thing. Sam doesn’t feel like ice anymore. He’s starting to warm up.
“Cas take the pullout,” Dean points, “I can walk. I’ll take the room upstairs.”
AND WE'RE CAUGHT UP!!!!
Sam looks to Dean,
Score another for Dean. Sam might have all the brains, but Dean gets his own moments to shine.
Dean stares at him. Benny stares back.
Benny squints at him, “How?”
“Tell me what you mean!” Sam snaps. The lightbulbs above Sam
“The rules? Well it’s simple enough. I’m sure you’ve noticed that this place changes you. Makes you your best self. So there’s only one rule: take what you want,” Benny says, and he’s very focused where Dean licks blood off of his lips, “cause this is the only place a monster can be truly free.”
Dean rolls down his window to let some hot air in before he freezes to death. The radio shrieks on, and it’s about to bust the windows. Dean covers his ears.
“Whatever it takes to keep that boy running,” Bobby agrees. He’s looking hollowed out too, deep circles under his eyes.
“And so that’s why my life…” Sam trails off with a scowl. He shakes his head, “okay. So what are you saying?”
Sam hands off the coffee, a sort of apology because Sam keeps feeling embarrassed he’s got ptsd from saving the world.
“A little variation is always nice,” Dean says, “depends on the mood I’m in, you know?”
“As long as it’s not your stupid claws,” Dean groans.
“Hey, call Bobby. Put him on speaker,” he says.
They were watching
Cas shakes his head, “Only by design. A soul can only be split manually. It’s done, on occasion, to ensure individuals stay close to one another.”
“Yeah,” Dean says slowly, because
“This wasn’t some ‘mistake’ that could be forgiven,” Cas sighs, “I went to heaven with the
“Take off your clothes,” Dean orders, and then hesitates, “or, uh, whatever you’re comfortable with. The goal is to get your dick out.”
"I thought you didn't make it?" Benny asks, and he looks to Dean now.
“Of course,” Dean agrees, “anything.”
Big love to everyone who left a comment on the last chapter <33 It's been so much fun seeing Dean, Cas n Sam settle into a new normal, especially when the Big Plot is arriving to change everything!
Oh shit, wait. That’s good role play right there. All Dean needs is an apron so he can play the housewife. But later! He’s got a mission for tonight.
Sam rolls his eyes, nods to Cas, “Hey Cas.”
“Cas,” Dean pushes him off of him. His stomach drops. They’re in Bobby’s house, not at home, not in Dean’s personal room where the locked door means they’re safe.
. Dean’s turned on enough to be willing to try something stupid. At the same time, of all the shit he and Benny got up to, they never made it all the way. Fuck, he’s not ready. Physically, mentally, spiritually, whatever— so, diversion.
Dean hears Cas’ entire speech. But he hears
“About him taking it off? I’m all for it,” Dean says. No one should be treated the way Cas has been treated by his family. It’s insane.
in. It’s somewhere where Dean doesn’t have to worry about Sam escaping, where Sam can wander the halls at night, and where he can cry and scream and no one else can hear them.
“Okay,” Sam agrees, and then asks, “are you okay?”
Dean’s been stripped of so many of his bullshit layers, guilt or fear that he used to carry, things that would hold him back in a fight, all gone so that he doesn’t even question it. He’s horny and hostile, and sometimes both at the same time. Benny is always down to help Dean work that extra energy out whether it’s a fuck or a scrap, or a little mix of both.
When he got Dean's urgent message, he planned his way back to Kansas. Unfortunately, the paparazzi made it difficult to get out of California without it making headlines. Castiel managed at the end of the weekend to get back to Dean's house. He wore his usual beige overcoat and black suit while having a white t-shirt bottomed.
"Castiel!" Anna's voice disturbed his thoughts.
Then there was a living room to his right, an old green couch with a Samsung television, magazines from the last time he had spent time there. Two other doors; one to the bedroom he and Dean used to share and another to bathroom. Also two exit doors.
? Sam shoved the thoughts away. His mind drifted away. A peace settled over him.
Dean gulped.
. Again the phone buzzed in his pocket.
"Did he tell anything else?" Anna asked curiously. She put her hand in the water in front of her.
"Good, when are we meeting up?" Dean asked to shift the topic. He took yet another big bite and he moaned happily after.
"Dean," Castiel repeated over and over. His hand laid on his neck, he kissed his nose, mouth, chin, ears everywhere he could reach. Dean's body tingled. He wanted more. More. Castiel hit a spot inside him.
"It's completely normal. The worry for a family member, when you want to help is something anyone would do in your shoes. The paparazzi does track your every move and Sam's. I advise you to talk about it," Castiel paced over to the exit getting ready to get home. He wanted to stay. Dean's hand suddenly stopped him. His pressure-tight, his eyes seemed to look for something in his face.
Dean's eyes moved to his companion, Anna. Yet another angel but fallen unlike himself.
"Shut up, I am a genius," he went for another beer before it disappeared before his eyes, Gabriel held it taunting so he couldn't reach it. His eyes narrowed. "What?"
Dean turned but was meet with hard muscle. Dean's mouth went dry, he swallowed. Castiel held him in an iron grip by his torso. Dean froze like a deer in the headlights. He felt his footsteps falter to a halt. The air around him tensed in something he had noticed in the God before. Dean's eyes lifted painfully slow up at Castiel. First to his chin. His full kissable lips. His nose. Castiel's sky blue eyes seemed to stare into his very soul.
Then without Dean really paying attention, his thoughts wandered to Cas's sky blue eyes that shone so clearly. Almost as he could watch into Dean's own soul, it was unsettling and intriguing.
Desire flooded through both of their systems. Yet it would be wrong. "What enemies did they refer to?" He continued.
"Twenty minutes left to get on stage, Dean," Gabriel informed him.
"God works in mysterious ways," Castiel began to walk beside Dean to his car. Which car it was he didn't know yet.
he realized a moment too late.
He put his hand on Camilla's shoulder until they reached their destination. Dean sighed quietly to himself. He opened the door to the small suit they entered and closed the door. Camilla let her hand through her thick hair. They stood in silence for a moment before she busted out crying again. Dean bit his under lip and looked away. He had to get this over with, no matter how much he hated his choices.
The day passed in a similar fashion. They visited museums, shops, and interviews. When he returned back to the hotel he felt had run a thousand miles. The sun moved down on the horizon. It's red, yellow, and white lights shone up the city before it disappeared behind some buildings. Castiel wiped away the sweat from his forehead and sighed.
Castiel nodded. "I will consider it a remarkable success." He walked over to Dean. They stood a few meters in between them. Before Castiel managed to open his mouth strong arms embraced him. For a short moment, his brain stopped working. Dean sighed into his shoulder. Not wanting to scare Dean away he moved slowly to hug him back. The wheels in his head turned to make sense of the situation.
"Yeah," he said simply. He took up a yellow page from his back pocket and gave it to the angel. "It's the solution to everything, don't give it to anyone before telling me first," Sam informed the angel.
"We should continue to recruit, Castiel. I have gotten reports from archangels planning to eliminate you," Anna said. She turned her head in his direction for a second her eyes stared straight into his own but he knew he was not seen. Anna smiled at Castiel.
What he saw surprised him. The laptop showed a picture of a hound Dean saw some weeks back. His green eyes narrowed once he read the text underneath the picture
"It doesn't explain your obsession with drinking, or that you have nightmares you never tell anyone about. It's alright to talk about it you know?" Sam's voice shattered his thoughts. He resisted the urge to say a sarcastic answer that laid ready on his tongue. Dean crossed his arms over his chest.
Castiel's eyes followed his moments, his brows furrowed. "I am God," as if that was the most obvious answer in the world. Castiel stood at a decent space from the knight. The dark vibes closer to his liking, he smiled. Sam was in the end still Dean's little brother and he planned to use that to his advantage in the future.
"You mean apart from being drunk? Not that I know of," Sam cleaned up from his side of the table and stared at him.
Castiel showed off by taking far more than he usually did. His stomach burned and tingled with the taste. About half an hour later the effects began to take place, the colors became clearer. His worried disappeared as if they had never been there in the first place. At some point, their hands were tangled together. His skin was buzzing. Castiel smiled dumbly. Dean's arm was over his shoulders and grinned back at him. His cheeks flushed. They stared intensely into each other's eyes.
They entered next to the average bar. Its walls were full of old pictures of famous artists and people Sam never saw before in his life. Old classics blasted through the speakers, the kind his father, John listened to when he was alive. Sam unwillingly got teary eyes yet he held them back. People walked around in flannel clothes and jeans.
"Castiel Novak, was your intention to turn Dean gay? According to rumors you only did that to get his money?" Jenna asked, her dirty brown eyes cold. She tapped her red pen into her notebook in front of her, her legs crossed. Jenna sat ready to dig into his every word.
Sam gave a nervous glance towards Cas that shook from the fear he was experiencing. He took a moment to recall the yelling could have been. "Cas?" His voice soft he stood in front of Cas. Cas blinked a few times before he opened his mouth.
He arrived at his house. In reality, Bobby's. It was a shaggy house, with three floors, Dean had yet to see the basement. The house had dark blue painted outer walls with three stairs in white. He checked his phone before he went out of Baby. Dean patted it and smiled.
"You knew," Dean stumbled backward some steps. The cold metal of angel blades made him stop. Dean raised his hands to signalize he wore no weapons. What he never told his superiors about, was the research he did when he felt like it. On purpose, he crossed his arms behind his back so the angel blades cut into his palm.
," Dean groaned tiredly.
"I am not a human," Dean rolled his eyes. He decided to wait for a few more minutes before taking a run for it. They obviously wouldn't care much anyway.
"Dean doesn't know?!" Bobby said.
Then...their lips met. Dean pressed harder to his side. His hands went into Dean's soft hair. His lips were just as soft as he recalled them if not better. Castiel gasped for breath by the end of the kiss. Dean's hair was ruffled from where his hands had been. His heart jumped in his chest. Castiel's hand took hold of the tie Dean wore, he tugged it until they were face to face.
Sam nodded before he turned to walk away, he said over his shoulder, "Got to get back to Lucifer, big stuff happening soon. I can't wait." Then Sam zapped out of where Castiel could reach.
He closed the distance between them and kissed Dean as if it was the last thing he would ever do. Compared to the prior ones where they hungered into each other, this felt different. Dean opened his mouth willingly. Castiel devoured his mouth. Dean's hands tangled themselves into his hair.
"I will fix it," Cas said. He nodded in Dean's direction. "They don't know about me and I can give you time to figure out before talking to the press. Also, I can order so we get an effective way out of this. Sam should have an idea of how each of you should act after this. We need to be quick, the people nor fans won't wait on anyone. Be sure you do your best out there. I know that you are aware of how brutal the press can be."
"Your God isn't the only one," Castiel said. The priest's eyes became even bigger of the surprise. "I am your one true God, and you will process your love onto me," Castiel walked over to the middle of the church.
Sam answered every single time,
. Dean said his goodbyes and went back into the car. Sam turned to him with his bitchface 1.0. He shrugged and drove the car into the parking lot after showing the guard's ID. Dean showed the way into the rooms where they jammed.
"Then we can begin in your case, are we going to research for the hunters or the murders?" Balthazar continued as Sam had never said anything. Sam introduced Balthazar to the little thing he managed to figure out on his own. When Sam finished telling, the sun was setting outside.
"Dean...?" He said.
"I—I," Dean tried to form words but was lost in the sensations. "What the hell was that?" Dean grabbed hold of Castiel's shoulders like a lifeline. Castiel continued to thrust into him, and Dean shut up. His hands squeezed Castiel's shoulders when he came all over the clean sheets. Shortly after Castiel's come was inside of him. Dean was in euphoria and landed on top of the bed. He was so gone he didn't hear Castiel chain him to the bed and kiss his lips muttering a
A burning hot memory surfaced from the deeps of his mind. How his boyfriend's hand had hit his face to his face ended up bloody. How much time to fix up the stitches while he had to lie. The lie that was so engraved into his being that he needed approval from someone else.
Dean thought shocked.
Dean scrambled up on his feet. "Sam!" without noticing his presence Sam bypassed them and went outside. Dean and Castiel followed shortly after. Worry etched into their faces. "Sammy!" Dean yelled again. His chest heaved, his pupils dilated. Dean ran down the stairs and Castiel saw Sam throw the bag into the bag seat before he began to drive the car.
He heard swear words been spat out by Bobby. Dean stopped a few centimeters from the door.
Sam shook his head. "He will understand." He deeply hoped he would. At least, he lived with himself better if he knew that. The spotlight had no importance for him anymore, he found greater happiness to kill having no conscience about it. The darkness inside him was eating him up and he welcomed it with open arms.
"Nothing of sexual content happened?" A man in a white jacket and crimson-colored hair asked him. His lips bit into his pen, the man's gaze penetrated his own. Castiel stared angrily into the man's eyes, his hands clenched into fists.
It looked nothing special, the walls were made of gray metal. A neon sign stated the name of the bar but Castiel paid none of this any special attention. He walked in beside Dean that nodded to the bartender and asked for some drinks. Dean's hand was at some point on his shoulder. Castiel felt exposed in that way but there was something vulnerable in Dean's green eyes that he couldn't look away from.
"Oh right, going to Chruch and all?" Dean said curiously.
"You like it," Dean said. He bit his underlip before he continued. It had been on his mind awhile, he folded his hands on the desk. "It's something that has...been on my mind,"  Dean said nervously. "Is about Sam."
He pressed send and fixed up his desk, he followed Dean to the other section of the house. Every second he had with Dean, he enjoyed it to its fullest, in Hell he might not be so lucky. "Sam, I know what you are thinking, stop."
The angel shook her head. "No, they are not. Dean, a new apprentice according to our sources is commanded directly underneath God and two other archangels. The names we haven't found out yet but we are working on it." She twisted her hair in the fingertips before she sighed. "Castiel is trying to make Dean back on our side where he is supposed to be."
Castiel laid in a hospital bed, his once dark hair now completely white. His energy was drained and Castiel to breath in every second he did. Anna sat by his side on a chair, seemingly haven't aged a day. Castiel had attempted to ask her about it before but she glanced at him as she told him 'You will know soon enough' then Anna would turn to read the news.
"I was curious, wanted to help another hurt soul. That's what music does right? Makes one feel what one wants to bury," Dean talked quickly Castiel barely managed to keep up.
"No Dean, I am busy—"
"Are you
Sam couldn't help himself. "Did you just quote
Castiel took a sip of the alcohol, which was apparently beer. He studied his friend for some moments, confusion once again shown on his face. "I don't understand, aren't we technically in the future?"
Castiel stood silently letting the words let sink. Dean let go of Cas.
Many of the reporters he recognized from past encounters, this wasn't going to be pretty. Some wore pitch guitar black uniforms, others held the cameras rolling in his direction. He put his palms on top of where the microphones stood. "Any questions?"
His eyes were suddenly dragged towards a man in a black suit like himself but less expensive. If it weren't for the man's blue eyes that on occasion scanning the room their gazes would never have locked together. Something about the man felt
He had honestly never considered that he learned new things from Dean every time he met him. He licked his lips and thought before he answered. "I have always spoken like I have, being polite has never hurt anyone, Dean," he looked into Dean's eyes.
Sam saw the time was closing into midnight. He gave himself a mental pat on the shoulder before he began to walk towards his room. In less than half an hour he was in bed sleeping.
“We can take her soul at the end of her life and not make her a demon. She won’t have her soul ripped up with the purpose of losing her humanity to become one of us. It’s the best I can offer.” he lifted his hands up in a “take it or leave it” manner and Dean bit his lip, contemplating.
“You’d think the mortals could find a better way to establish themselves and set themselves apart from the thousands of others on campus other than wear a suit.”
“But, why would Michael put you in charge? Didn’t he guess that you would always try and do the right thing even if it was against his command?”
“No, I’m the first. But that’s why I thought they were so solid. Dean’s never even been tempted to go with Cas’ identical twin brother Jimmy.”
“Are you a spy?”
Castiel chuckled at Dean’s exuberance, the human had so much life to him and Castiel found himself drawn to the light like a moth to a flame. He moved his hand from behind his back to show the pie to Dean.
“Who the fuck are you? What was that? How did you get in here?” Standing on shaky legs, he glared at the man before him.
Too late Castiel blasted through the door. Dean flopped back on the bed after Jack released him and cradled his arm to his body.
“Are you kidding, wild horses couldn’t keep me away! So, are you excited? Today’s the big day.”
Crowley quickly sat on the empty chair beside Dean, “not to worry Squirrel, Gabriel is on his own side but he loves Jack and Castiel. He can be counted as an ally.” His eyes took in the young man sitting across from him. Sam’s long chestnut hair framed his face and made his bright hazel eyes stand out, a kaleidoscope of colors that hypnotized anyone that stared too long.
“No, but I am way too old to have never even been courted once.” He grumbled, fighting the urge to cross his arms; he was not pouting.
Crowley raised his brows in agreement, “so you’ll come to Hell then?”
“Hi, I’m Jack.” The boy gave him a bright and friendly smile with a dorky little wave that instantly put him at ease.
“Damn, you’re kinda badass Cas.”
“Can we just find your missing brother already?”
“My youngest son, Sam. I can’t promise his soul, but you can take him to Hell with you. So long as it isn’t to make him a demon.”
Dean gasped as whatever had him let go and he had a moment to calm his rapidly beating heart.
Jack gasped excitedly and bounced his legs under the table. “You can go visit Sam!”
“Okay now you’re freaking me out, tell me what’s going on or I’ll just go ask Crowley.”
Sam grinned widely at his brother, completely unaware of any danger as he eyed Dean proudly. “I can’t believe you're taking care of a kid. That’s so awesome Dean, and Gabriel says you’ve taught his nephew so much. I knew you were so much more than you ever let yourself believe you were.”
Dri let his annoyance leak into his scent as he glared back at the woman. “Customer service is when a service is provided to a customer. A customer is someone who paid for something. You’re getting nothing unless you pay for it!”
“That’s true. See you tomorrow?”
“I just can’t help but feel shocked I guess, plus you’d think they’d pick a more worthy Omega.”
Before the words had time to hit Samandriel, Castiel pushed his way in between them. His eyes red and lips pulled up in a menacing growl before he snapped at the woman. “How dare you speak to him in that way. You are far older than Samandriel yet you have no mark or gift of your own. Most likely due to your abhorrent attitude that will no doubt turn anyone away. Get away from our booth, we would never sell to the likes of you.”
“Heaven isn’t what humans expect, it isn’t harps and halos and fluffy clouds. It’s political, bureaucratic and the cruelties that angels commit could far surpass those of demons. It’s just that angels are self-righteous enough in their actions to think their cruelty and heartlessness is warranted. One of the worst sins that the host commits is reprogramming. It’s a tourtureus act put in place to keep everyone in line. It’s painful and erases memories from an angel's mind. I’ve been reprogrammed several times. My actions were viewed as treasonous by some for going against the high command but others viewed it as continuing to follow our father’s desire to protect humans. Michael couldn’t just have me killed because many were loyal to me and he couldn’t risk making me a martyr. I didn’t even remember which memories were taken from me. Only the intense, all consuming pain and that my crimes were going against my superiors’ orders.”
“You’re a Knight of Hell now Dean. More powerful than any other creature alive except for me and the Archangels. I’m not sure if you’re more powerful than higher level angels but you’re definitely more powerful than Azazel and his siblings. And instead of turning you into a demon and warping your soul, I changed the spell so you can stay who you are. Who you were always meant to be.”
Dean dropped him unceremoniously but Crowley paid him no mind. He just attempted to fix his suit, scowling at the wrinkles from where Dean’s hands bunched up the jacket.
“That would be best, Dagon knows not to push but Asmodeus and Azazel can be conniving and thrive in sowing discourse and pain.” Castiel agreed, though he would gladly kill all four of the Princes to keep Jack and Dean safe. He was strategic enough to know it's better to not let an enemy know what your weakness was.
“Awe, what happened Crow? Not feeling like the special one of kind King of the Crossroads anymore?” Dean teased much to the annoyance of his demonic companion.
“You dare make threats? To me! No one threatens my family!” Jack's face shook with his rage as an energy wave shot out, hitting the demons and causing them to fall unconscious.
“I promise.”
“But I... I’m a fuck up.” His nose twitched at their combined suddenly angry scents.
Castiel allowed himself to be jostled by the hit to his shoulder, moving along with the motion to not hurt Dean’s arm. “I’m grateful for your sacrifice.”
Crowley winked back looking relaxed, “naturally and if you and your little paramour want to try something a little wilder I am available.”
“My soul.”
“Caaaaaassss,” Dean whined but Cas just kissed him lovingly, effectively shutting him up.
Samandriel was in the middle of helping an older gentleman choose the right flavor of honey for his wife’s biscuits. The man was in his golden years and was leaning on his cane, a small reusable bag in his hand with some flowers and fruit to bring back to his love. Dri couldn’t tell his designation since he seemed to be wearing scent blockers but the kind wrinkly eyes that looked up to him with gratitude was all the young Omega needed to patiently walk the man through each flavor, allowing him to try a sample spoon of each and explain how each hive was stationed near a different field to produce different tasting honey.
Dean’s eyes fell back on his young charge and saw the boy was naked save for a sheet he had wrapped around himself. Jack climbed back onto the bed wearily as though he had no strength to hold himself up. Dean still wasn’t sure what went on during a rut but he rushed forward to pick the boy up and lay him back on his pillows.
“It’s Sam, and I missed you too Dean.” Sam looked at his brother questionly. “Come on let’s get some coffee and catch up. I know a place on campus that serves great pie.”
“Bitch.”
Dean wiped his eyes, still refusing to look at his brother. “No chick flick moments.”
He jumped in surprise seeing Jack appear in his room. The book fell off to the side but he paid it no mind, instead grabbing on to the young nephilim.
Castiel’s lip ticked up into a smirk. “Everyone who witnessed my fight with Ishim knew I was the best one for the job. They were loyal to me and trusted me, if he chose someone else they wouldn’t have taken the position or he’d have to take someone from another garrison. Which would have alienated my entire garrison and since we were the strongest warriors that would have been unwise. He still found a way to get rid of me in the end. Jokes on him my garrison is still loyal to me and I have even more loyalists throughout the host.”
“I know, I’ll be watching to make sure you’re both alright.”
*********
“Hey Cas, can I ask you something?”
Dean wagged a finger in the smiling demon’s face, “no. Now give us some time alone.”
Castiel watched them from his post, his celestial form easily able to look through the spell-proofed door. His wings quivered in the plane of existence where he had them as he saw the human's bright soul caressing his Nephilim charge. The human most likely had no idea how his soul reached out to the boy. Dean truly had the most loving and compassionate heart Castiel had ever seen. He was the best of humanity and proved his father’s favoritism was justified. Cas couldn’t help but wish his fallen brother could have met Dean and seen how good he was, perhaps things would have been different.
“The owner stepped away but if you’d like to leave I certainly won’t stop you. And I’m not a teenager, I’m a grown ass man and if you try to touch me I’ll break your fucking arm, female or not.”
“Good luck to you guys too. Love you.”
“Heya Cas, Jack inside?.”
“Looks like someone’s grown a knot.” Dagon stage-whispered to Azazel.
“Remember that class on mythology I wanted to take as an elective, well I was able to get in and turns out the Professor is your ward's uncle.”
He chuckled shaking his head disbelievingly, “a 14 year old caring for an 11 year old for days on end while you’re getting drunk and letting strange young men plow you into unfamiliar beds?”
“What the hell is that?”
“Hey now, you’re not just anything. You're as beautiful and loving and funny as they are. Obviously they must see it too.”
to be changed. Would you want to be something other than human?”
“Delicious,” Dean shrugs, “I don’t— I don’t know? Meat? Cheese? Onion?”
It’s a blatant stalling tactic. It’s so obvious that Dean should call him out on it, but it gives Dean time to collect himself. He scrubs his hands down his face, breathes heavy. In, out. In, out. He could lie. He could always lie. Why is this so important? Why does he want to ruin things with Bobby? The rubber band in his chest gets tighter. Feels like it’s wrapped around his lungs. He can’t breathe.
Dean almost laughs. He remembers sitting on Bobby’s porch, before losing Ellen and Jo, and the two of them saying they were each other’s best friend.
“I’m wearing shorts, idiot! What’s wrong with
“You can barely walk,” Benny cuts him off, “besides, I’m stronger.”
dudes and chicks. That makes more sense.
“I’m gonna clean up in there,” Bobby nods to the kitchen, “so you go take a walk and figure out what you’re going to do. And if you’re not ready to change, then maybe you need to leave Sam and me alone for a while.”
The truck fills up much faster than baby’s tank, so Sam comes to keep him company while Dean waits.
“Hey, baby!” Dean coos as he jogs up to the impala. Right where they left her. And she’s still in one piece! Dean slides into the drivers seat and turns the ignition. Starts up like a dream, and purrs beautifully. She’s been dormant for too long, time to get her on the road and let her run.
Cas won’t look at him.
Cas thinks on that, “I suppose I can. But I… I’ve been thinking hard on this. I want to stop fighting.”
“I needed a medium to be able to communicate with you, as you are not special enough to understand my true voice,” Cas reminds him, “what this is… the body is a filter, that I may reach out and interact with this world without causing harm or panic amongst organic life forms.”
"I'm not human, I’m an angel," Cas reminds him, "I am... a soldier. I'm useful."
“Abomination,” Naomi spits, but even she steps back.
“I was impulsive. I’ll fix it,” Cas agrees. He steps forwards and raises a hand to heal the bite mark. Dean jerks back from him. Now Cas frowns at him.
“Shit, no! The, uh, magic Sight I have. Cas leaves like, I don’t know, grace fingerprints. You had grace on you.”
It’s a lie, Dean knows it. It’s the same tone Cas had all through purgatory, the one that Dean was tripping too hard on purgatory “clarity” to understand.
Thank you everyone for the kind words last chapter! I appreciate all of you for sticking with this story so long, and I'm so excited to share the upcoming last chapters with y'all! Everything I've been setting up since the start of
“I want to make you orgasm, on purpose,” Cas says, “your song was intoxicating.”
“So we’re scouting?” Sam muses, nods to himself, and then asks, “is Bobby meeting us there?”
Cas’ nose wrinkles in disgust.
Kissing Cas becomes Dean’s favorite pastime. Sometimes Cas gets things wrong— he misunderstood the force involved once and almost bit through Dean’s lip— and he’s not entirely sure about heavy petting, considering he’s got like no sex drive. It leads to some weird touches that aren’t sexy at all, but because Dean’s gone absolutely stupid with feelings, it makes his heart grow like three sizes or whatever chicks say.
“But you don’t want to kill me,” Dean repeats Cas from earlier, as a reminder for the both of them.
When Dean opens his eyes all he can see are Cas’ glowing eyes in the dark.
Which also means we are THREE CHAPTERS from the end holy shit. HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!
Warnings for this chapter: mentions of suicide and Sam's time in hell
Cas appears at the end of the bed.
“So perhaps I would like sex more, if it was with you. But right now I’ll admit I don’t see the point,” Cas finishes.
Dean hates that he’s been reduced to a piece of meat.
“How’s this?” he asks.
The angle is different, touching someone else. If Dean had thought this out, he might have tried to figure out some way he could be behind Cas, doing a little reach-around to touch him, to show Cas all the different things he could try.
“I’m okay, Sammy. I’m okay.”
Cas moves his hand slowly, like going too fast will spook Dean. Or maybe he’s not sure what’s expected of him.
Dean keeps convincing himself he can never have what he wants :(( but beano you COULD!!!!!
“What is this?” Dean demands. His heart hammers in his chest. He went from feeling hollow and strung out to dry, like some sort of husk that would crumble over time, to feeling like he was home and all was right in the world. His emotions come rushing back so fast it brings tears to his eyes. He’s so fucking scared, and relieved, all at the same time.
“Hey, hey— you need to multi-task,” Dean reminds him.
“Dean,” Cas lets out a long sigh, “you were reckless. You should not have…”
“Small?” Dean frowns, notes the slight difference in height between himself and Cas, “buddy, look in the mirror.”
“You don’t understand,” Naomi pleads, and she sounds desperate. What the hell? “I’m sure he is spinning lies to you, but you don’t
Cas looks… well, he looks like he’s stopped trying to figure Sam out, and he’s now back to ‘I’m a complete fuckup’. Dean needs to get off his ass— he’s got damage control to do here. Sam’s too close to breaking, and Cas needs a fucking break.
Dean grimaces, “Sorry, I—”
“What?” Sam asks. Fuck, he’s crying. Dean glares at Death. It’s so cold Dean’s teeth are clicking as he shivers. The empty cans on the counter rattle as a breeze, of all things, picks up in the kitchen.
"I don't see the point," Cas remarks, but he starts undressing.
obey heaven’s orders,” Cas points out, “and I am… well, I am the most famous rebellion since Lucifer’s fall. I am anything but obedient.”
Dean scowls at him, and Cas rethinks his words, “thank you. It may… there is a small chance this could help.”
“I don’t know what it is,” Sam shrugs, “cause he does, love you, I mean. But the
“How do you know?” Dean asks.
off!” and sends Dean to save Sam from ending the world.
Cas brings him home, back to Bobby’s, and heals him. Dean doesn’t feel any relief from the tension, from this
“Fuck me like you mean it, Cas,” Dean goads him. He pulls on Cas’ tie hard enough to lift himself so he can get up in Cas’ face.
Cas is precise and intensely focused as he pops the cap on the lube and squirts some into his hand. They’ve used lube to great effect in many different positions, so Cas is familiar enough to not be distracted by it now.
to do, but that they could never make happen. Even all the things he wanted Cas to do to him, the things he offered to do for Cas, that Cas never took him up on.
It’s been only a few days, they go longer than that without talking sometimes, but still… Dean missed him.
Bobby snorts, “Not everything’s about you, Dean. We’re at my dads grave. But if you want to talk about him...”
She makes a curious sound, like she’s agreeing, “You don’t seem strong enough,” she says.
“Hello Dean,” Cas says, and he holds Dean a little tighter, “you’ve lost weight.”
Dean would have liked that, he thinks. But he’d also tried to leave everything behind. He didn’t even contact Bobby for a year. It was the longest year of Dean’s life. Felt less like living, and more like waiting to die. With small spots of good in between.
Dean doubles over at the sink. Drops his head to touch the faucet. He’s going to be sick. He’s supposed to look after Sam! He’s supposed to take care of him! He’s so out of his depth with this, he doesn’t even know how to swim.
“Dad forgot how to love people. That the people you love, and who care about you, are important,” Sam says, “I’m not gonna make that mistake.”
one who disagrees with the Divine Plan. Am I… I fear that perhaps I am broken.”
They make it about three steps before Cas collapses.
Crowley’s face lights up as Dean closes the front door behind him, and he comes right up to the edge of the front steps, “Ah! Squirrel! Care to tell us what the hell is going on in there?”
of that, even? That shouldn’t be possible. That’s a secret Dean locked in the darkest corners of his mind, and then threw away the key. That he wishes there was someone who could know him
“Who the hell wears so many layers?” Dean growls. It’s hard to see what he’s doing when Cas is up in his face.
He and Sam sprawl out on the couch where they’ve set up a proper movie area. Sam crowds in on Dean’s space, not even putting up a ruse about being tough, and Dean lets him without making a joke about it. Dean texts Cas that he can come join them, if he wants. And he almost texts
“Looking for the angel is wasting our time,” Benny says, “it’s killing you to be here. And if you die, I don’t get to go home.”
Sam narrows his eyes, considers Dean’s words, and looks down at his seatbelt again.
“What I am…” Cas pauses, shakes his head. Dean really did open a can of worms didn’t he, and it’s going to take a lot of big words to get through this. He sits up so he and Cas are sitting shoulder-to-shoulder.
Dean and Bobby tear through the kitchen to find something Cas can eat. All of Bobby’s reserves are tv dinners or heavily processed shit that would only be appealing to Dean after a few beers. Very little in the way of ‘made with love’.
“Yeah, and I’ll believe that when I see it,” Dean says, “can you do me a favor though? I know you don’t want to teach him—”
“Sam?” Bobby asks, turning to face Sam. They’re all looking at Sam now. He’s leaning heavy on the doorway, looking pale, sweaty and twitchy.
“I’ve got your back,” Dean assures him.
“You’re supposed to dress eggs up. Cheese, hot sauce, you know?” Sam explains.
Dean makes it a clean kill.
“I could follow you,” Cas offers, and he looks up at Dean, “if I have the choice, I choose you. And if I don’t, well, I choose you. I love you.”
“Okay,” Dean agrees, “okay, I’m in.”
Death snorts, “It would have been helpful if you’d
“It’s not,” Dean cuts him off, “it’s just— it’s complicated.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, stunned, “my brother.”
“Fuck,” Benny growls, and thinks hard, “alright, come on.”
He’s cut off as the candle flames in the room flicker. Cas’ wounds light up brighter.
to feel me up?” Dean teases, and it’s kind of exciting how fast Cas can kiss him to prove him wrong.
He's safe now, in theory. That's the wrong way to think of it. He's not safe anywhere— but he's dangerous, armed, and he has a mission to complete. Benny's soul pulses hot under his skin.
Cas looks away from him, thinking.
Dean’s stomach lurches. No fire? No way to cook anything? But that means—
He wasn’t expecting like, cotton candy or anything. But come tastes awful. Dean grimaces, and Benny laughs at him.
this,
He’s one man, one sad, broken, useless man. And he’s supposed to do the impossible. But he can’t, he
So it’s kind of embarrassing, but also a little nostalgic, to get up the stairs with Bobby’s help. Dean distinctly remembers the time he was nine and he and Sam were left with Bobby while Dad was off on a hunt, and they were messing around in the scrap cars like they weren’t supposed to. Dean climbed up on top of a car, and when Sam attempted to follow him Dean tried to shove him down because babies shouldn’t do dangerous shit, and then Dean fell and rolled his ankle. He’d been unable to walk, and Sam had run to get Bobby.
“My shoes are gone,” he observes.
and he liked it. Dean used to think he didn’t deserve to go to hell, but now he knows the truth. Dean was made for dark things. Dad must have known what Dean was, how pathetic he is, so he did his best to make Dean into a useful weapon.
“It might be nice, not to fight for a while,” Cas says, and he sounds
Dean gives him a quick salute, and throws baby into drive to follow the truck out.
But also lmao Sam is SO GOOD at Dean-fu. Completely disarms Dean by coming at him from a whole new angle (with love) and doesn't rise to Dean's panic attempts to start a fight to hide. Both these boys are growing!!!! We love to see it.
“This human mask is not an indicator of my true self,” Cas says.
good,” Cas admits.
It’s the first time someone hasn’t recognized him as
He leans in and kisses Cas.
And a
, and Dean feels like he can breathe again.
Cas doesn’t even notice at first, and licks a line up Dean’s throat and it’s too much— oh fuck, Dean kinda
Sam grimaces, “I don’t know. It would have been different if he was around. We’d probably be doing other shit. Doesn’t mean it would have been better, or worse.”
"So many rules," Cas mutters, but he starts pushing himself into a sitting position.
“Lucifer and I were
He can’t— he can’t think about that. Why is the kitchen so gross? He cleans out the fridge, yells at Bobby for keeping shit in there long enough for it to gain sentience. He snaps at Sam for getting Bobby into white claws because now Bobby never has proper beer anymore. Dean wants to drink himself stupid, he wants Cas to answer his fucking phone already. He wants Cas to show up with some stupid reason that he wasn’t returning Dean’s calls. That he took a detour and saw a weird bug, and got distracted or something. Dean wants him to walk in the door and be okay. He’s got to focus on that. Cas is going to be okay.
“Mary Elizabeth Campbell, what a surprise.” The deep voice spoke in an almost bored tone, as though what she was doing was predictable; expected.
Usually Dean would threaten or physically push the shorter man out of his way but Cas had already proven his angel strength when Dean asked him to spar. The human would not soon forget how immovable the angel could be.
As Crowley filled his cup with tea he dropped the news to a chocolate covered Jack, “the Princes came while you were indisposed, your majesty. They were most unhappy to be turned away. Though I doubt they’re ever happy.”
“I’ve never known a Beta could smell so sweet.” Jack couldn’t help but inhale deeply at the building scent of homemade apple pie.
Castiel smiled, recognizing the deflection for what it was. “I wish to court you, if you’re amenable.”
“For a few, I’m actually in my trailer now. Netflix is having us film several episodes of Haunting at one time. It’s great cause I’ll be home with Sam sooner, but sucks because of the pressure to get every shot in one take. What’s wrong sweetie?”
“Yup, and a terrible one. He told me right away why they sent him, because he doesn’t believe in their mission. He believes in me and that I can do real good here and keep the balance.”
“Jesus Christ!”
He didn’t think he was worth all the fuss though. His talks with Jack - and it was mostly talks - didn't feel like an educational lesson, they were just him talking about his life and Jack asking for further explanations on certain things. Turned out the kid had lived in Hell since his birth. His father had tried to raise him for about two years before something happened and he sacrificed himself for his son. Jack's powers had caused him to age rapidly to protect himself when he realized he was in danger. If Dean already hadn’t been getting attached and protective of the kid, hearing he was pretty much a full-bodied three year old sealed the deal.
“Not when it’s hot enough to burn your tastebuds off, just let it cool.”
“Deal.”
She bit her lip, reflecting on everything and how best to put it to words. “After our divorce, things were great. I got to keep everything except for his car, he had to pay alimony and child support. He was living at his friend’s house because he couldn’t even afford his own place. I finally brought him to heel. Everything was perfect. Until he got hurt at work and met Florence Nightingale.” She sneered, picturing Kate’s smiling face.
“But we wish to be with you for far more than your business savvy. We wish to court you Samandriel and make you ours. Our mate.”
“No, they want to court me, but were very clear in that they want to mate me and be theirs.”
Dean threw his head back, laughing as one arm fell around Dri’s shoulder, rubbing his thumb on the Omega’s neck. Samandriel could smell that he was being scent marked. It made him feel cared for and wanted having the delicious Alphas scent on him but he knew it meant nothing. Dean was simply tactile in nature and probably didn’t even realize what he was doing.
A month later found Samandriel in the farm house's kitchen pouring Cheerios into a large saucepan as the Omega happily hummed along to the song on the radio. Knowing the rules of the house well, he kept the station on the classic rock channel. Dean walked in loudly belting out the chorus of the song making the Omega shake his head at the older man’s antics.
“What do you mean?”
“What about your mom?” Dean nearly shouted, hoping to distract him again.
He blinked again, letting his eyes turn back to blue as his posture relaxed to the detached aloofness he carried earlier.
Sam stared at Dean, shocked by his odd behavior. “Gabriel Angelus.”
“Hey,” Dean wrapped his arms around the frazzled looking teenager. “I’m okay, and I’m gonna always be okay. I’ve got you and Cas looking out for me right? You don’t ever have to worry about losing me. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Down Juliet. You might want to let me go, Squirrel, before the doggy decides to use you as a chew toy.”
Dean’s face scrunched up in disgust but it only seemed to amuse the demon. “Oh, calm down Squirrel. I just need to take you down to see the guy in charge, plus this way we can talk to the little Cherub and see about making sure your brother gets your old room upstairs.”
Dean followed the command unwillingly. "Yep, sure, God almighty," Dean expected a punch to his face and not how Cas began to laugh. Cas suddenly stopped grinning like a madman however, Dean couldn't imagine in his wildest thoughts what Cas would do next. It both excited and scared him.
Then the headache hit him as a trainwreck. It throbbed. Dean's eyes met Cas's from the other side, surprise reflected in those eyes. Regret. Guilt. Was some of the feelings rushing through his chest. Dean avoided Cas's gaze. "I shouldn't have done it," Dean muttered under his breath. Hell, he should've known better. The familiar sound of the leather seat cracks made him glance up. Cas's hand was put on his shoulder.
Yet after the kiss, Dean had looked scared and ready to tell him something before his girlfriend had broken the moment. Castiel leaned against the window on his side. The world passed by as it always did. Unchanged. They drove until the sun had long ago disappeared from his sight. A high building immediately made Castiel raise up from his seat. A hotel. It's walled tinted white as feathers. Yellow lights lit up the open space Dean parked on.
Unbearable ache splitting every cell in his body, Dean screamed. This went on for longer than Dean wanted to admit for himself. For at some point, his mind was a blank page. Dean's soul rewired itself and sealed the past him into a corner. Ready to respond to any other.
"Yes, sir," Haziel said and saluted shortly as he turned to Anna. They began to talk, he heard their chatter before he disappeared from their view.
He squinted his eyes against a blaze of lights from the cameras after Dean's question. People raised their hands as fast as the seconds could pass. He gave Dean a worried glance but Dean kept looking straight ahead with an unreadable face. Dean pointed towards a young lady that wore jeans a short overcoat and a black tie. She had her platinum blonde hair in a ponytail.
"About your parents?" Balthazar asked intrigued. He leaned forward with his hands folded on the table. His eyes gleamed amusement. Sam shook his head. Balthazar stared dumbfounded at him. "Economy?" He guessed again.
"Saving? I am a grown man. I take care of myself, I have a job I go to," Cas defend himself. "You can't save everyone."
"Damn it, Anna," Castiel mumbled underneath his breath. Suddenly he saw the sky began to shatter thunder all around.
"What?"
"After."
"What?" Dean asked confused. He stood oblivious for a few seconds before it dawned on him what Bobby wanted. "Yeah, sure," he shrugged while he walked before he shouted over his shoulder "Where are the packages?"
When he heard knocking on the door his head snapped up. "I am coming!" Dean's feet moved softly against the floor. There a nervous tapping with a few of his fingers, he cleared his throat as he opened the door. "Heya Cas," he smiled.
Sam gave Balthazar one of the few bitch-stares he usually reserved for his brother. "It's a case," Sam repeated irritated. The tension went out of his shoulder. Sam leaned back to the chair and avoided looking directly at Balthazar. He could see Balthazar's confused face out of his vision.
The ground started shaking underneath his feet. Castiel hit him in the face, an explosion of colors divided themselves everywhere he tried to see. For the second time, his back collided with a surface. Blood dripped from his light brown hair to his clothes. Dean smirked even when the crimson liquid fell from his mouth. "You see, I am not him."
"The interview will be with
"Just...don't," Dean's voice shook, he put his head in his hands. They sat silent for a long time before Castiel slowly put his hand on Dean's shoulder. Dean lifted his head. Once again, desperation passed between them. He knew it was wrong but he touched Dean's cheek with his fingertip. Dean didn't move from it and Castiel relaxed his tense shoulders.
Castiel thought to himself.
Then the guilt came crashing down once more. Castiel forced himself to relax his shoulders and to show his usual controlled self. He could barely hear the bar door being opened, he checked out of habit and was shocked when he saw Dean standing at the door. Excitement blended with happiness. Castiel let his eyes study Dean for a moment.
Shock reflected itself on Sam's face. "Dean? Because if this a trick, I am going to kick your ass."
. To his amusement, he was back at his apartment. However, his heart raced in his chest. The sting of hurt bumped like burning fires where he had gotten hit in the head. Some minutes later he managed to relax his rapid heartbeat.
"You must not look for your brother after you are dead," Baltazar said. He turned to the waitress and asked for the payment. Sam blinked a few times. He had heard the words, yes, but they were hard to comprehend. Balthazar moved to him again as if nothing important was exchanged.
"Dean, I—"
When Dean found Sam reading the newspaper while munching on the last piece of bread he rolled his eyes. "Thanks, Sammy," he said sarcastically. He opened the fridge and made himself a sandwich before he sat down on the other side of the table.
He drove the impala(or as Dean likes to call it 'Baby') for hours before Sam reached his destination. The case had taken his attention because of the death of the victims. Their eyeballs were burned out. No other pieces were in any way harmed, and also the weather events before and after the attacks. Sam texted on the phone before he cleared his throat. Dean's number displayed on his phone. The blue light illuminated his face.
"I wanted to help him, why won't he let me?" Dean spoke in the silence between them. Sam felt at a loss for words. He decided to take one of the smaller chairs before he sat beside him. He sighed and glanced towards his bag that was full of guns.
Dean Winchester?" Her voice held an underlying layer of offensiveness.
First, they would torture him before this meeting. Then they will put him on a torture table until he was a whimpering mess. Toward the end of the day, they would ask the same question;
Castiel thought. It flashed white. He covered his face with his left hand. The lighting seemed aimed at his car. He barely avoided one by turning drastically to the opposite side.
The claws stripped his flannel shirt into pieces, the pain penetrating his skin and body. Sam screamed out. Soon more followed, digging deeper into his body. Black spots appeared behind his eyelids. Sam covered his hands over the wound, the hellhound merely panted above him before a bit crushed the burn under his body to the full.
Dean saw Cas bend his head down, the next words he uttered would change once again how he felt about him.
The day had begun. Sam pinched his nose. For many hours he drove on the long streets, the sunlight hit without mercy at the black car. He tapped his fingers on the wheel, no music was on to take him away from the choice he had ahead. At his rear window, he saw a taxi followed him.
Father did come some seconds later as Micheal had told him beforehand. Father's features looked tired. The group greeted one another before they began to talk.
Cas smiled. He squeezed his shoulder and Dean relaxed. "Tomorrow is the day," he told him. Dean nodded. They had waited for this for days and finally, it would come together. However, fear crushed him from the inside. Would he able to fight when a mere command could make him turn to kill? Dean knew he wouldn't be able to survive without Cas or his little brother.
"It's going to be okay," Sam told Cas, unsure who he was going assure himself or Cas. But he knew each day were counted as the day he made the deal was closing in as a burning fire.
"Hey Dean," Sam said into his phone. He heard the rustle of bedsheets been pulled over. A familiar sigh was the first response he got from his big brother. Sam turned the speed slightly down so he could hear Dean's voice clearer.
Dean parked the Baby. A smile covered his face for a few seconds. For some hours, he drank the beer bottles. He waited. Sometimes, Dean didn't remember when Dean felt ready. Suddenly, the thoughts that had repeated themselves blanked him out.
Dean made space between them."Sure, show the way, Samantha."
Castiel opened and closed his mouth a few times. His cheeks heated up in embarrassment. "I have never—"
Then he began to hear screams from the inside, his body tensed up. His heartbeat as a bird that took flight. Dean focused on breathing calmly. A crowd of people left screaming, Dean watched them warily not entirely sure what to think. He waited.
Castiel's palm did another twist, white lights that appeared as chains surrounded his arms. Dean's hands relaxed in pure surprise that flickered through his gaze. Castiel then grabbed him by the shoulder. They appeared in Bobby's panic room for monsters.
The angel's head snapped up interested. Her blue eyes reminded him of Castiel. They were after all related to Sam's prior research in hell about angels and demons. Like always, the information came in handy. He decided to describe more of his point. Some angels did really not understand subtlety. "They want my power for their own gains. But I never actually planned anything like this," Sam gestured with his hand. The lie was easy on his lips.
Dean moved slowly his fingers. His head was completely blank from the pain he expected. The surface underneath him was compact but wasn't cool against his skin. An intense light made him glow, everything behind his eyelids became red dots flooding around. Then Dean heard voices, one deeper than the other.
Calling Cas had been a good idea, he needed someone to talk with. Dean took his brown military jacket his father had given him, he took the keys from the counter. Before walking out of the house he checked that Balthazar and Gabriel weren't outside. Silently he walked out, above his head, the full moon shone down the path to his Baby.
Balthazar crossed his arms over his chest. Said nothing for a while in deep, though. Sam used the time to eat up his salad however, he gave one worried glare towards the bodyguard that sat unnaturally still. To break the silence Sam continued, "I need help. But for this, both need to be armed with guns. This
"He fixed the press conference, haven't seen him since. I already told them what they needed to know. What did you conclude to do?" Cas last questioned directed at Camilla. He shared an understanding glance with her. He nodded quietly afterward.
he heard the sound of plates being collected loudly. He winced before he thought for a while how to answer her question. The air began to pour into his lungs. How Dean's green eyes changed color when a faint ray of light meet his. Like the world turned into life once again, how he tried, oh, how he insisted on helping.
He let his mind wander, even though, interrupted by devices that tug into his bones. Sam refused to plead.
Sam grits his teeth together when he saw the red flooding over to his own. The Mark fastened itself on him. Sam took a few breaths. This was entirely different, the willingness to destroy was bigger than ever. Lucifer snapped his fingers, "the Blade," he said.
"Not exactly what you expected, isn't it?" Baltazar said as he pointed his fingers to the hunters beside them. They heard chatter raise in volume when a normal guy walked in. He had brown curls, the outfit most wore and clear blue eyes in a lighter color than Cas, and signs of a beard. The guy stood after a few minutes of time on their side.
But Dean changed everything.
"Next week, I am gonna help Bobby out at opening this bar. I will be busy with stuff, you know interviews." Dean shrugged.
"You are beautiful," his words left his lips and he regretted it immediately after. Dean's smile died on his lips. His eyes became wide with fear and Dean coughed for a few seconds. They paid the bartender and walked out. Castiel's head against Dean's shoulder, his body felt as if he was light as a feather.
He felt exposed under his stare and finally let his eyes wander in another direction. Anna was gone, he noted to himself. Weird. The wind blew stronger, their clothes ruffled in the wind. Castiel's hands moved slower on his body. His cold towards his warm neck. Castiel laid his head on his right shoulder. "I missed you," Castiel mumbled, his breath ghosted over a sensitive spot of his.
Dean's eyes moved quickly, he seemed to be lost for a few minutes before he drank up his glass."Just asking," Dean took up his hands in defense.
"No," Dean sobbed in desperation, his green eyes beginning to tear up. His jaw set. Dean's strong body surrounded him. Sam closed his eyes. His body sagged into Dean's. One last time, he strengthens his grip around Dean.
," Anna cut him off.
The rest of the concert went successfully. After he took pictures, gave autographs a few hours later he was ready to stretch his legs and meet up with his brother. He told the crew goodbye and went into his trailer. Dean took a quick shower and changed into more appropriate clothes. He took on his black suit with a colorful tie.
To be fair, she had a point. Castiel sighed before he turned towards her. Sometimes, she was the only friend he trusted before meeting Sam at a later moment. But the connection he felt to Dean? He couldn't ignore that. But he was tired to bark orders, to watch innocent die by his word, and the worst, witness how humanity itself turned against him.
When Dean saw his brother going limp, he stood a few moments without moving an inch. Dean felt the angel blade against his skin. Dean lifted his gaze to Bobby, the right moment to strike was now. They would never see it coming. Bobby stood tense but Castiel seemed to have another plan in mind.
Lucifer gasped by his side, it would be complicated to keep them both out of function so he could escape with his head on his body. Lucifer rose in his standing glory. A white blaze began to cover the black-toned walls, Lucifer's broken wings spreading before them. Sam clenched his fist until he heard Crowley throwing up blood before he let go.
"I have to tend my armies as well," Castiel began. Sam glanced around the nonsuspicious humans around them. "Some angels are split and taking sides with Fathers instead of myself. I will need your manpower when they do attack us. Their biggest asset is the archangels which include Dean. I will get him home," Castiel ended his short speech.
"We are good," Castiel said his eyes avoided Dean's.
That broke the tension in an instant. Dean burst out laughing, he pressed his palm against his stomach."You are a funny dude, you know," Dean said between short breaths.
Stuff didn't make sense, just a little earlier he had been on his way home. Now he was literally home. But he knew for sure he visited Dean Winchester, his hands could still be felt on his skin. How could he explain the weird car encounter to anyone? They would conclude he was crazy.
Dean shrugged. Cas's eyes narrowed but it was a harmless threat, Dean was well aware Cas won't hurt him any more than he had to.
"I..." Dean started, he looked down. "Is nothing, Sammy," Dean finished, he picked up Sam's guitar and put it between Dean's own. Dean avoided standing directly in front of him.
"No way, I will own the stage," Dean laughed. His smile broadened once he began to hear the chanting of his name closer to the stage. His heart thrummed in his chest, he felt alive than ever. "It feels good to be home, I have missed my brother."
She had on a white necklace around her pale neck. Camilla had taken her black hair in a ponytail and on a grey overcoat and black tights. "Hi Dean-o, Sam," She nodded towards Sam in acknowledgment.
"No, pie. Pie is the best. And we can watch tv later, you in?" Dean shoved him playfully before he went to the kitchen without batting an eyelash. Sam rolled his eyes. He followed his brother quickly into the kitchen where he started putting up the ingredients Dean insisted on having available at all times.
The concert went as planned for the rest of the night.
"You must be kidding, right? Never watched it not even once?"
"So if we break the layer, we get Dean back?" Castiel asked a glint shone in his eyes. The blaze of hope.
Castiel resisted the urge to facepalm and he kept his eyes on the road instead. He rubbed his neck with his pale fingertips. However, he had this nagging feeling in his chest he wasn't able to take away. As if someone was watching him. He tightened his grip on the wheel.
Castiel went out of the car and locked it. He stared fondly at the car. Castiel had his first kiss there and his most profound memories, he had celebrated his twenty-one in the car. Alone.
"I am so sorry," Dean clenched his fist.
"That's none of your concern," Castiel said. He prayed to God that this torture soon would end if he could get away or disappear he won't mind either. Dean made him felt safe, none of these people did that. He fumbled with one of his hands on the end of his trenchcoat. Castiel's head turned when he heard Jenna's voice again.
His vision cleared and he groaned. Bobby was leaning against the wall a few centimeters away from his face. The jarring pain was gone. Sam blinked in confusion, the blood stuck to his hands from his clothes. His head hit the wall and he sighed. It took him a few more seconds to realize Castiel wasn't in the room and Bobby hadn't woken up. Probably some angel mojo involved. Immediately his thoughts went to Dean.
Sam gestured at him with his eyes in a shut-up-Dean stare. "You see, it's possible to fix him." Sam crossed his hands over his shoulders.
His body pulsed as his hands started shaking. The normal levels of cautiousness arose in him. Dean blinked many times before getting a clear view of what he saw around him. Dean staggered a few steps while he fell to the ground. Dean's hands pressed his palms against his skull. How long it lasted was exactly three hours and ten seconds.
“Yeah, I am. Thank you so much Lana.”
Dean leaned forward, his eyes wide as his brain quickly went through the small rolodex of Bible knowledge to figure out if his brother was in danger. “Who's your professor?”
“What do you want with Sam?” His glare intensified as the protective urge flared inside him.
Castiel raised a dark brow at the smug human. Dean's eyes widened as his stunning green eyes were nearly over taken by his lust-blown pupils. Castiel growled, enjoying the way the younger man shivered and the delectable scent of want in the air. “You shouldn’t tempt an Alpha, Dean.”
He put the mail on the kitchen counter as the automatic sprinkler system turned on. Mary had gotten it earlier, saying she didn’t want Dean coming over while she was away and wasting his time looking after the small home. He didn’t mind though, he liked feeling useful and just wanted to help. He knew he’d always been a bit of a people pleaser. Back when he was still dating Lisa, she pushed for him to go to therapy; he never thought he needed it but he wanted to make her happy. It was the people pleaser in him, he was well aware. Therapy had been fine, soothing even. At least until the doctor claimed that Dean was abused growing up and was forced into a role of “emotional parentification” by his mother whose constant abandonment forced him to try and take an adult role too early. Dean got so angry at the doctor and so defensive of his mother and family that he stormed out and never went back. The relationship with Lisa didn’t last much longer after that either.
