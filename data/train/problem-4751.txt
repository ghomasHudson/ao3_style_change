Dean threw his bag in the corner and sighed. His head was one second from exploding and he still felt nauseous. He grabbed his apron and pulled it over his head. Then he walked back out. “You take the register today, I'm not in the mood for talking.”
“Coming up.” Dean said and nodded.
Will Dean finally realize that Castiel is not together with Balthazar? It is too see....;)
The only thing he could think of was the sudden feeling that he was breathing through a straw. He didn't get enough air into his lungs and his surroundings began blurring slightly. From far away he heard someone softly say his name.
“I won’t.”
DISCLAIMER: All of the mental issues in THIS chapter is researched, and it is not something I have experienced myself.
“Good.” Castiel lied. “It's going good.”
“You should have heard it. As you pointed out, we were loud.”
He walked into the back room and took off his jacket and put on his apron.
They sat in silence as the train rolled over the tracks. Castiel rested his head on his friend's shoulder. “I'll miss you.” He mumbled.
Castiel noticed from far away how someone gently pulled him up from the chair and led him away. The person sat him down on something soft.
“Fuck…” A voice came from the corner, it sounded stressed.
As they walked into their apartment Balthazar´s bags were standing inside. He was gonna leave early in the morning. Castiel looked at it and sighed. Balthazar frowned.
And Castiel listened, holding onto the voice like a lifeline. Breathing still coming out as small gasps. His heart beat faster and faster each second. It felt like it was gonna pound out of his chest any second. He bought a hand up and pressed it over his heart, like he tried to slow it down, or keep it in place. He screwed his eyes shut. It felt like he was on fire. Like the whole world was on fire. Like he was being burned from the inside and out. The voice kept talking softly.
“I want to.” Castiel grumbled. “Being a writer sucks sometimes.”
As he walked past them he kept his eyes fixed on the floor. He thanked the higher power that they didn´t address him. He sat down and glanced up at them. Balthazar was sitting closest to the window and Castiel was sitting beside him, his head was resting on the blonde one's shoulder. His eyes were closed and his breathing was deep and slow. Dean looked back down and as the train started moving he felt nauseous again. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Castiel glared at him. “The largest coffee you have. With an extra shot of coffee please.”
Gabriel came out and handed her her coffee. “Have a good day.”
Dean stood as frozen. Charlie too. The attack lasted for about half an hour. Gabriel stayed at Castiel's side the whole time. He had his arm tightly wrapped around his brother and mumbled softly in his ear. Dean could not comprehend how Castiel managed to stay conscious. He was pale and his breath came out as short small gasps. He wished he could help but Gabriel seemed to handle it quite well.
them over his dick.
“Sure.” Sam side-eyed his brother, not buying a word of it. Dean had been shot, stabbed and even ripped apart by Hellhounds in the past; a little paper clip in the foot was nothing compared to all that. “Whatever.”
Unlikely, because Dean, but not completely impossible.
Cas huffed and mimicked Dean, swallowing the amber liquid. It burned, but he tried not to show it as he gulped down the second shot. As with beer, the whiskey tasted different to his human senses, but since he was already beginning to feel its effects, thanks to the beer in his system, he didn't dwell on it. Dean ordered them more and Cas drank whatever was given to him. Not surprisingly, his new tolerance fell quite a bit short of having to drink a liquor store to get buzzed and it wasn't long before he was on his way to being properly intoxicated.
The atmosphere in the car was excruciatingly awkward. Dean was blasting AC/DC as loud as possible – clearly for the sole purpose of preventing anyone from speaking – while gripping the steering wheel so tight his knuckles were white. Cas sat with his head bowed and sunglasses covering his eyes despite the overcast sky outside.
Miguel laughed. “So you guys did go there, huh?”
When Dean took hold of the base of his cock and opened his mouth to engulf him further, Cas had to cover his face with a pillow to stifle the noises we was making. Dean continued to suck him, working his way down, then sliding back up to swipe his tongue over the leaking tip. Cas knew he wouldn't last long. He had already been so close before Dean started and he could feel his orgasm quickly approaching. He wished once more that there was some light in the room so that he could see Dean pleasuring him and watch himself disappear between the hunter's gorgeous lips.
Sam sighed. "
"I'm close-," Dean muttered, breathlessly. His hips snapped forward a few more times before they stilled and Cas felt splashes of warm come hitting his chest and seeping over his fingers.
"According to your chart," Cas said, his voice even deeper than usual. "You appear to be suffering from a terrible case of Prolonged Erection Disorder."
Cas looked up at him through half-lidded eyes, his pupils blown and nodded. Dean thought it was the best his angel had ever looked and damn if that didn’t make him want to come right then. He tightened his grip and rocked faster. “
The feel of Dean hard and pressed against him, creating the perfect amount of friction, was quickly bringing Cas close to climax. He kneaded at the tight muscle of Dean's ass and pulled the other man closer, rocking up to meet each of his thrusts. Dean cursed, tangled his fingers in Cas' hair and brought their mouths together once more.
Cas frowns at that and his shoulders sag. Dean thinks maybe he should apologize, but before he gets the chance, Sam is giving him a patented bitchface and saying “Let’s go, Cas,” while dragging the former angel out of the kitchen with him.
Curious, Charlie and Kevin both bent down to look under the table.
“Cas,” Sam says and it almost sounds sympathetic.
“Then why'd you ask?” Dean snapped, but there was no venom in his tone.
get slimed."
“What the hell was that?” Dean asked when they left the kitchen and were far enough out of earshot. “Do you know how close I was to creaming in my pants back there?”
together, and was totally out of line hitting on him like that.”
'That's right! Shake your money maker, Cas.' Dean cheered from the bed.
Sam clears his throat and looks uncomfortable. “Why don’t we stay in and have a movie night instead? It would get Kevin out of his room for a while. Plus, you’re always saying that Cas needs to learn the classics.”
“You don’t even know where I went.”
“Me too,” Dean agreed and bent down to kiss him.
"Shut up, Cas."
they would not have consented to. The repercussions could potentially destroy their friendship.
Dean's head whipped around so fast he nearly lost his footing in his semi-drunken state. He had not expected
muttering Dean's name and broken words in Enochian, then collapsed spent and breathless on top of the hunter. They were both sticky and covered in sweat, but Dean didn't care. He wrapped his arms around Cas and held him close, planting soft kisses to his temple with the gentle affection he often only allowed himself to show post-coital.
"You haven't told me what dream-me dose next," Dean responded as if it were obvious he had only been awaiting instructions. Castiel had to refrain from pulling out a chunk of his hair.
“Right, of course,” Cas said understanding. “I thought about that which is why I cleaned myself out before I inserted the anal plug.”
"I wish I could see you," Cas said to the shadowed outline of the other man.
When he got no reply, he risked poking his head around to look into the room. This decision, Sam would later note, was his Stanford education failing him yet again.
Dean scoots closer so he can pet the other bunny. “We can keep them.”
“Maybe.”
“I got first shower,” Dean announced, dropping his duffel on one of the beds to dig out a pair of clean clothes. He heard a door slam and turned to see the bathroom door had been shut. “What the fuck, dude,” he yelled through the door. “I called dibs on the shower.”
He’s on his bed, in the middle of spite watching Netflix without Cas when there’s a knock on his bedroom door. He ignores it, but after the third unanswered knock the door cracks open and Cas sticks his head inside.
"Well, they can either take what you give 'em or do without. Leaves more for me to enjoy."
He quickly washed away the evidence, but he couldn't deny that he had just come, and come
“But I swear the first time I step in bunny shit; they’re going in a stew.”
Castiel placed a kiss to each of the hunter's knees and gently removed his fingers, leaving Dean feeling suddenly empty and desperate to be filled again. Cas continued to loom over Dean for several moments with his swollen lips set in a frown, brow furrowed and head titled slightly, suggesting he was either confused about something or deep in concentration.
"I get it," Dean said, irritated at his brother for trying to poke holes in his brilliant 'Get Cas Laid' plan. "He fucked up again and now he's stuck down in the dirt with the rest of us monkeys, blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just tryin' to show the guy that there are perks to being human."
and shut the fuck up about my
Sam disappears into the room, leaving Dean to face Cas alone. “Sam and I have not been intimate,” Cas informs him. He sounds insulted at the suggestion.
"That was awesome, Cas," Dean said after a minute. "You did good."
Mercifully, Cas seemed to forget about the plug while they were busy shopping, but he made up for it during lunch when he started to turn it on every time the attractive young waitress came by their table.
“Don't be so paranoid,” Sam told him and quickly put the phone in his pocket. “Nobody cares about what you get up to. I was actually looking up directions to that strip club.”
“No.”
in bold black letters before he whipped back around in his seat and threw his hands over his head. “Nope! Never mind. Sorry I asked.”
"I have no complaints." With Dean still hovering over him, Cas wanted nothing more than to reach out and palm the hunter's cock through his briefs. "May I touch you?" he asked, because despite recent developments, Cas had promised to gain consent first.
'Are you fucking serious?' Mia asked.
I don't read stuff like that.”
“Not exactly.”
“That scantily clad angel does seem familiar,” Cas pointed to a mannequin in the store window wearing white lingerie with a pair of fluffy wings attached to the back.
my napkin."
“Strictly chicks,” she answered. “I know a good-looking guy when I see one, but I have no desire to get naked and freaky with a dude. 100% proud and awesome lesbian.”
“Well, you said you wondered what it would be like to kiss me,” Dean answered as he tried and failed to sound causal. “I wanted to give you one you wouldn't forget.”
Dean found himself, not for the first time, grateful the former angel was a quick learner. After only a few times, the brunet was able to give a blowjob like he'd been doing it his whole life. He worked his tongue around expertly, sliding all the way down until his nose hit the coarse hair at the base. When he came back up, he stopped at the head and licked over the slit before pulling off.
“Freakin' thrilled.”
Cas whined when Dean moved his hand away, but his protests were cut off as the hunter crashed their mouths together and rubbed their cocks against each other. Both men moaned, rocking their hips again and began a slow rhythm. Cas lifted his head enough to reach Dean’s neck and suck on his salty skin.
Sweet mother of fucking fuckballs!”
“Cas, just-” Dean stood up and moved away from the bed. “I'm not having this conversation.”
Sam burst out laughing and Cas heard another
Dean read the message twice before he realized who had sent it and what they meant. He left his room and went to find his brother, who was, not surprisingly, in the library doing research -- because he's a giant nerd with nothing else to do.
“Touch me.”

“I'm not sure,” Dean answered, looking around the area. “I think I remember coming here though. Cas?”

“Dammit, I'm not done,” Dean interjected. “You gotta stop blaming yourself for everything that happens, okay? Don't keep beating yourself up over the stuff Naomi and Metadouche did. And for cryin' out loud,
Sam has the nerve to look confused when he asks, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“What is it?” Sam asked as Dean smoothed out the wrinkles to read.
'Are you recording?' the redhead they knew to be Shelby asked. 'Oh my gawd, can you believe he left you with all of his stuff. They don't even know
“I enjoyed last time,” Cas panted as Dean rubbed him through his jeans.
hurt him. But he already did plenty of yelling in the car and it didn't make a damn bit of difference. Words aren’t what Cas needs.
'Hope you're recording this,' Dean said, appearing on the screen. He was sitting on the edge of the hotel bed, looking excited with anticipation. The girls were giggling in the background and the camera panned out to show Cas standing stiffly in front of the hunter.
Dean cut him off with another quick kiss. “You gonna come?”
"Hey, Cas," Sam said as he tried and failed to hold back a laugh. "Sleep well?"
the night before. He couldn’t explain why, it just felt awkward being so exposed around the other man.
the door to Dean's room was open and the light on.
Moving the video forward, he stopped at the part where he removed Cas' boxers and the camera zoomed in on the leaking cock. His own dick was beginning to react to what was happening on the screen. He was pondering whether or not to give in and start touching himself (because why the hell not?) when the motel door flew open and Sam barged in holding his duffel under one arm and cradling his laptop with the other.
"You're sure about that," Dean asks.
Dean began rocking up, pounding into the pleasant heat of Cas that surrounded him. The room filled with the sounds of their combined grunts and groans and the wet slap of skin on skin. Cas changed angle and Dean's cock hit the little bundle of nerves inside and sent pleasure shooting through Cas' body.
“Your car is fine, asshole,” the redhead interrupted and tossed him the keys. “Same condition it was in when we borrowed it.”
"Nevertheless, this is
“What the fuck?” Dean shouts. He reaches for the knife he usually keeps tucked in his boot, only to remember that he didn’t grab it when he bolted from the bunker.
“You know my history. I'm not exactly cut out for relationships.”
“He means in our role playing game,” Sam cut in, glaring at Castiel and making a mental note to add 'lying' to the list of things the former angel needed to work on. “We're in town for an RPG tournament.”
“Are you happy?”
Dean huffed a laugh at his reaction and held down his hips. "Gotta be patient."
, Dean thinks. “Dude also needs to learn how to socialize with other people,” he counters.
Dean laughed even though he knew Cas wasn't joking. “I know, I don't understand myself most of the time.”
“I'll be sure to do it in your presence more often, then.”
"Well, I'm sticky and gross so
"Really, Dean?" Sam sighed, exasperated. Why was his brother such an idiot? "Don't you think it's past time you and Cas sat down and talked about the
“Hm?”
“Not with the way you were Hulking-out on this door,” Dean snapped back. “I'll wake Cas, you go get the car ready.”
Oh, I just want to take him home…
Contains the song: Devils backbone by The Civil Wars
Castiel reached out and grabbed Dean and pulled him close. “ I love you and I need you to know that. But, Dean, I can’t do his anymore.”
Dean glanced up at mirror, seeing Cas looking down at something with his lips curled in the hint of a smile. Based on Sam's reaction, he decided not to ask.
Cas waited a few moments to see if Dean was going to continue monologuing. “If you're finished, I do have a few things to say.”
touched,” Cas responded. “There were several unused items that I wanted to keep. I saved your women's underwear in case you wanted to wear them again.”
Charlie perked up, remembering why she was there. Yes, she
means his angel blade? “It's not really clean... up there.”
“What happened?” Sam asked, torn between concern and amusement.
Thinking if he was somehow wrong about Dean's intentions, he could later blame what he was about to do on sleep deprivation. He closed the small distance between them, aiming for the hunter's mouth. Their noses bumped together roughly -- eliciting a curse from Dean -- before Cas' lips made contact with the hunter's stubbled chin; completely missing his target in the dark.
"We visited some old buildings and went to a museum; nothing you'd be interested in," Sam interjects and hands Dean a mug of freshly brewed coffee in an obvious attempt to distract him.

bedroom. He went directly to the bed – leaving Cas to lock the door and shut off the light - and laid down in his still slightly warm spot. Always preferring to sleep nude, Cas slipped off his boxers before sliding in behind him. He draped his arm around Dean's waist and nestled in close.
"Are you offering?" Cas asked, sounding very serious.
“Dean? Cas?”
. His body tensed as he came, spraying hot white streams over Cas' hand and both of their stomachs. Cas kept his grip around Dean's cock, stroking slowly until the hunter's body slacked. After a few more thrusts Cas followed Dean over the edge, spilling out deep inside the other man.
“Oh my god!” Sam gaped. “That's what this is about, isn't it?”
Dean raised his eyebrows and smirked. “Holy shit, it's hot when you cuss.”
"Yes, doctor," Dean licked his lips. "I've been
"I wanted to do something
The bottle of Jack taunts him from the floorboard, so he throws it out and is only marginally satisfied when it shatters on the concrete. Looking around he finds the pizza boxes in the front seat; one box sits empty – Dean had eaten every slice – while Sam’s veggie pizza and Cas’ plain cheese were left untouched. Dean tosses them out to join the remains of the whiskey bottle.
"You're so beautiful, Dean," Cas whispered in Dean's ear. "I enjoy being inside you."
Cas cocked his head. “Don't you want to do something about your arousal?”
Cas extended his arm and pat Kevin on the head. "S'okay. I've exploded on multiple occasions."
The nosy trucker watches him with a death stare from the driver’s seat of her big rig and Dean wonders how much restraint it’s taking her not press the accelerator and plow into him.
Dean hooked his fingers under the elastic waistband and pulled the boxers down to join the jeans at Cas' feet. He wrapped his hand around the shaft, pumping a few times to relieve some of the built up pressure and Cas moaned loudly, his head falling back to rest on the door. Dean decided that was his new favorite sound and would make it his mission to hear it as often as possible.
stuff. Anyway, I'm a huge fan and hey, thanks for helping out with that whole apocalypse debacle.”
“Never!” Kevin shouted and doubled his efforts. “You're going down.”
Cas changed angles to graze Dean's prostate, sending a spasm of pleasure through the hunter's entire body. "It involved costumes." The angel hit his prostate with every other thrust, reducing Dean to a keening mess unable to respond, so he continued speaking, "I was looking forward to wearing my hat."
Cas rolled his hips to rub their lengths together, making them both groan."Bend over the table for me."
videos to get ideas."
“Dean?”
“Will it be a...pie
"Oh, yeah," Dean smiled. "The plan's still good. Tonight was one of those... whatchacallit... miscalculations... of geography, but that ain't the plan's fault. It'll work next time."
Sam furrowed his brow. “You're not sure about what? That you want to be with him?”
“I don't give a shit that those rapey skanks got canned. That's fucking karma. I wanna know what the last part is supposed to mean.”
“Jesus, Dean, could you watch the language?” Sam asked, turning to look at his brother. Dean was facing away from them, his palms gripped around the edge of the counter and trembling slightly. “You okay?”
. “Why the fuck are you naked?”
“Dean, are you okay?”
“Just go outside. We'll pick this shit up.”
,” Dead corrected as if it were the end of the discussion. “You got a better idea?”
A throat cleared behind Dean. Of course, Sam would choose that moment to come back with the food.
Cas looked down at the phone still in Dean's hand. “It doesn't bother me. Besides, after what Naomi did; drilling into my head, erasing my memories and who knows what else, countless times over the millennia,” he shrugged, “I don't like not knowing my own history, especially when we have the means to find out.”
between him and Cas. Not until Dean’s ready. If he’s ever ready.
“Exactly how it sounds,” Miguel explained.
Dean’s approval was all Cas needed. He moved to the other nipple and flicked the nub with his tongue before sucking it into his mouth. He moved lower, peppering Dean’s chest with kisses, giving the scarred areas extra attention. When he went even lower, Dean lifted his head to see what he was doing. When girls went that far down it’s because they were about to blow him. He didn’t think Cas was quite ready to suck dick yet, he knew he wasn’t.
I need –
Dean's head snapped up. “Wait, so you're not going to help get that damn video off the internet unless I talk about my feelings? That's blackmail.”
gets to be the bait.” He stood and moved to where the others were carefully inspecting the dead creature. “So...swamp monster, eh?”
Cas rolled his eyes, and despite himself, smiled. Dean did have a very nice body considering his lack of general exercise lately (outside of the bedroom) and the constant consumption of junk food. A very nice
Dean slumps down on the bed and buries his face in his hands. What the fuck was he thinking? What the fuck was
“Right,” he said, skeptically. “How many?”
Dean's body trembled. "Tickles."
'I know, right?' Shelby agreed. 'I'm

“Then what have you been doing?” Dean asks. “You’re hiding something.”
Extreme agitation.
“So Cas isn't feeling you up right now?”
be careful, Cas," Sam, who continues to keep his distance, warns, "he’s still contagious."
With Cas’ lower half exposed, Dean takes a moment to soak in the sight. His friend’s half-hard dick hangs long and smooth under a tuft of dark wiry hair and seems to swell further under the hunter’s gaze. Dean feels a nudge on the back of his head where Cas’ hand has settled and gives the impatient angel a cocky smirk before leaning forward to swipe his tongue teasingly over the head and along the length of his shaft. Cas lets out a small gasp at the sensation, so Dean repeats the action a couple of times before sucking the head between his lips. Cas begins to fully harden under his ministrations and Dean relishes the feel of it.
“He was still up reading,” Cas answers. “Shall we continue?” he asks.
feelings.”
Dean's jaw dropped. “I'm
. Castiel scoffed and nearly rolled his eyes out of his head at the implication he was in any way "dramatic" and stormed away from the amused hunter.
Sam eyed him skeptically for a moment. He was about to point out that Cas appeared to be more crestfallen than cranky when the former angel made his way down the stairs and over to the car. Without a word, he threw his bag in and climbed in the backseat, sitting on the passenger side – which Sam noted was highly unusual since Cas always sat behind Dean so they could stare longingly at each other through the mirror. Sam chose not to comment, taking his place in the front as Dean rounded the car and got behind the wheel.
“No shit,” Dean said annoyed. “What the hell do you have against sleep?"
“You're not gonna lose me,” Dean replied, trying to sound as sincere as possible. “I just need to know.”
Several things happened at once.
“Well, hello to you, too,” Dean grunts.
“Isn't that what this is about?” Cas asked, casually. “Your obvious attraction to me?”
“I am inclined to find out,” Cas answered.
He’s barely adjusted to the first finger when he feels the second one sliding in. The burn is new and strange, but not unwelcome and he thrusts down experimentally, encouraging them to go deeper. He feels full already, split open on nothing but fingers and groans when Cas begins scissoring him open. Much too soon a third finger appears at his entrance and before Dean can bitch about the lack of lube required to proceed, he recognizes the familiar cool tingle of angelic grace spread inside him, making him feel loose and wet.
"In case it wasn't clear, I'm really happy for you," Sam said sincerely. "But next time you guys decide to get it on with me in the next room,
“You comin'?” Dean asked, patting the empty space next to him, which ended up making the whole bed creak. "God, this thing's a piece of shit. Can't wait to get home to my memory foam."
, but Dean knew he would persuade him to go nonetheless.
and all.
Well, more like, aggressively make-out with him in a dirty motel room.
"Oh, yeah? Is this what you dream about, Cas? Me on top of you?" Dean asked playfully. He lightly grazed the smooth skin of Cas' cock before wrapping his fingers around it.
flirting with her,” Dean whined as the plug pulsed against his walls inside. “You gotta be friendly with people who handle your food otherwise they spit in it.”
like strippers, one was wearing a 'Wild Cherry's' shirt.” He elaborated when he was met with blank stares. “That's a strip club a few blocks east of here. They looked pretty skanky, if you ask me. I wouldn't be surprised if they're the ones that robbed you.”
“Mind your own business,” Dean answers and swats Cas’ hand away when he reaches for one of the files. “Said I wanted to work alone.”
Cas took the bottle and shook his head. “I have plenty in my room.”
his nipple harder. "That's not what I asked you." He pounded his hand into Dean's ass faster.
rough – as he begins stroking in earnest. Dean’s eyes flutter open when he feels two fingers prod at his lips, asking for entrance.
“Okay, I don't need all the details. I'll cover for you.” Dean said.
“Cassie…” Gabriel said calmly. “Breath. It's okay.”
Don't care if he's guilty... Don't care if he's not…
Gabriel shook his head. “Don't thank me, I will always help. Are you okay?”
“Where is the blonde one?”
“Oh.” Dean said, taken back a bit. “Well… I hope it gets better.”
He was wrong, he was so wrong. He would meet this dude more than once. And... he definitely was in love.
“Yup.” Both Charlie and Gabriel said in unison, “you are.”
“Yeah, yeah I do.” The man answered. “But if you put that goddamned song on I will kill you and myself.”
“Okay you need a coffee. And sleep.” Gabriel said. He handed him the coffee. “It’s on the house.”
About twenty minutes later he was walking down the street toward the subway station. His coat was flapping behind him in the wind. He had earphones in and QUEEN was playing on the highest volume.
He had to wait about ten minutes before the train rolled in with a high pitched shrieking. The doors opened and Dean got on. The first carriage was filled with people. So was the second and third one.
“Balthazar calls everyone darling.” Gabriel said. “Everyone. And by the way, he is in London with his boyfriend Peter at the moment.”
Oh, I just want to take him home…
“What just happened?” Charlie asked. “Who was that?”
was on the table.
“I know Balthy. I know. But when I have finished this chapter I will take a few weeks off, sounds good?”
Castiel shrugged his shoulders. “If laying on the floor passed out is sleeping then I got about one and a half hours of sleep.”
“Yeah… or… I will be.” Castiel added.”
“Cas...” The voice said. “Come on darling, let's get you more comfortable.”
“Good.” Charlie smiled, not aware of the fact that she had just busted Dean.
He looked back down at his computer and began typing slowly. A small smile appeared on his lips as he continued to write. Dean felt the hole grow bigger and bigger for each second. Suddenly, he said;
Dean handed her the cup and she paid.
“Tragic.” Dean said ironically as he walked into the small back office and grabbed his apron, pulling it over his head. “Any other interesting news?”
“Thank you Gabe.” Castiel said. “I really appreciate it.”
Castiel laughed. “How bad can a movie be Balthy?”
He opened his eyes and blinked a few times. He was laying on the couch in the living room. Behind him was Balthazar sitting. He had his arms wrapped around Castiel, who was leaning against his chest. He was still shaking and his cheeks were wet from tears.
“You two can take a seat meanwhile.” Dean said.
Hey darling, promise me too sleep and eat. I do not wish to find you passed out on Sunday. Don't hesitate calling if something happens.
“Couldn’t sleep.” Castiel mumbled.
“I know.”
“Good morning.” Dean greeted them. “What can I get you?”
Dean leaned against the bench while waiting for the next order. “Very many customers Gabriel, really.” He said and got a snicker in return from his friend.
“Dean! Green tea.” Gabriel said.
Castiel laughed. “Yeah, I heard it.”
“Not really, I just got a lot of sleep last night.” Dean said and closed the door behind him, not being able to hide his smile. He was still thinking about the man from the train. Really it was pathetic, he knew that but he couldn't bring himself to forget those blue eyes.
She paid and sat down. Dean threw a look at Castiel. He was once again writing and he was biting his lip slightly as he read through what he had written. He deleted something and rewrote it. Another customer walked in. A man in his mid thirties. He ordered an espresso and a brownie. Dean typed it into the register. “Anything more?”
Dean looked up, Castiel was still looking at the screen but his eyes were narrowed. Gabriel´s shoulders sank. “Sorry Cassie. How is it going?”
And Castiel did listen. He held onto the voice like a lifeline, to keep him from drowning in the burning pain and getting lost in the ringing sound that filled his head. The voice bought some kind of comfort. It eased the pain a little and made the ringing quiet down something. He clenched his fists tighter and and his breathing once again quickened dangerously.
“At least I'll die happy.” Gabriel grinned and sucked on the lollipop.
“He's not gonna respond.” He said calmly. “Try again in about an hour.”
“Oh my fucking lord. They are not together.” Gabriel laughed and wiped away the tears. “They are not. They are just very close friends.”
“I know.”
“Go home, I'll finish up here.”
“Okay, thanks.” Balthazar smiled. “Just promise me you will sleep. I do not wish to find you dead or something when I get home.”
Oh lord, Oh lord I'm begging you please…
The higher power listened.
“Sure, is everything okay?” Gabriel asked, worry filling his voice.
“Thank you…” Castiel whispered after a few minutes of silence.
At the end of the day Dean was sure that if he stood up one hour more his legs were gonna need to be amputated.
“If you say so.” Dean muttered.
“It's okay Cassie. Everything is okay. It's okay. I'm here, you are safe.” The voice returned and mumbled softly.
Oh lord, Oh lord, he's somewhere in between...
Both Gabriel and Dean turned to her, one in surprise and the other in desperate need to make her shut up.
“I'm glad to hear that.” Balthazar said. “Does it mean you won't write all your awaken time?”
“Coming up.”
“Huh? Yeah… Yeah I'm fine.” Dean managed to choke out. “Is he?”
“That will be five dollars.” Dean said. And Cass handed him the money.
“Sorry.” Dean said.
“Hello?” he answered groggily. His brain was still trying to catch up after the attack.
*        *       *
“Coming right up.” Dean said and walked out from the office to the machines. He made the cup quickly and Gabriel came and grabbed it. “Thank you.” He said.
He stood up, that was a mistake he realized rather quickly. His knees gave out and his vision blurred out to black.
It was not until around lunchtime that the customers started coming. Dean got stuck in the back making coffee and drinks.
“No, you are gonna go and have an awesome weekend with him.” Castiel said. “I will be fine, I promise.”
“London.” Castiel said as he typed faster.
Oh lord, oh lord… What have I done?
The rest of the day was similar. Not many other customers came in so Dean was all but busy.
“I will be.” Castiel said and smiled tiredly.
“What is he doing there?”
Oh he did what he had to do…
“Son of a bitch...” He muttered.
“Thanks man.” Gabriel said and disappeared out again as the doorbell rang and the first customer walked in. “Hey what can I get you?”
After about twenty minutes he walked back into his room. He closed the door and looked back at the clock. In ten minutes Balthazar would get up and leave. A part of him wanted to walk into his friend's room and beg him to stay, he knew his friend would agree. But the other part of him knew he had to let Balthazar go. He was an adult for god's sake. He could take care of himself.
Castiel slumped against his brother while trying to catch his breath. “T-Thank you…”
Castiel vaguely noticed how Balthazar closed his laptop and moved it away, putting it on the floor.
“Yeah I am.” Castiel said. “Just a little confused.”
“I need to finish this.” Castiel said. “Please.”
Gabriel choked on bare air. “What boyfriend?”
“Sure.” Dean said and hung his jacket on the door. “Got any plans?”
To his and Charlie's surprise Gabriel broke down in laughter. “Do you mean Balthazar?” He asked between the gulps of air.
Castiel returned to the table and watched as Balthazar padded into the room. Eyes tired and his sleeping shirt rumpled.
Dean walked out into the night. He decided to go out for a drink. He chose a bar a few streets away where his friend Charlie worked.
“No worries man.” Dean said and shook his head. “It was my fault, I was late.”
Dean pushed the door open and walked out. It wasn't as cold as he thought it would be. He started his path down the street and towards the subway station. As he walked past a restaurant he saw something that made his heart ache. Castiel and Balthazar were sitting at the window table. They didn't see him but he saw them. They looked happy. Dean's gaze returned to the ground as he hurried past the window. A tear slipped down his face. He cursed silently and wiped it away, Dean Winchester didn't cry. It just didn't happen. Ever.
“Nothing.” Dean mumbled “Just tired.”
“I just care about you Cas.” Balthazar said softly. “I don’t want you to stay awake for hours just to finish a book.”
“But he is together with someone else?”
“Shut your cakehole.” Dean muttered but went back to making drinks and food.
Dean's mouth fell open. “What?”
“Yeah I'm okay.” Castiel said, surprised how he could sound so natural.
“You will be in the register today.” Gabriel said. His voice was sharp.
Castiel was sitting at the restaurant with Balthazar. They had just ordered.
Oh lord, Oh lord I'm begging you please…
“Two espressos and brownies.” Gabriel repeated from the kitchen. “Coming up.”
Don't take that sinner from me…
Dean nodded quietly and swept the whole glass in one motion. “Yeah, love sucks.”
“Yes, I promise.” Dean said.
Castiel smiled. He turned around and put on a pot of coffee. He made a sandwich and sat down. He opened his laptop and read through what he had managed to write last night. It was all garbage. He deleted it and sighed. He had to be done with this soon. Panic slowly started to build up in his chest. His hands started shaking.
He clenched his fists and felt how his breathing quickened drastically.
*        *       *
She handed him two glasses. “Celebrating or sulking?” She asked.
Balthazar sighed and nodded. “Better hit the hay now if I am gonna get in time to the airport.”
“Yeah.”
“Shhh… I'm here. You are safe.” Gabriel murmured.
Castiel, who never liked to lie about serious things, answered honestly. “I was probably passed out on the floor.”
You know when you have had a gym pass, when you wake up the morning after you whole body aches and hurts. Like you don't want to ever move again. When Castiel woke up it was exactly how he felt. He slowly opened his eyes and let out a low groan. He was laying on his kitchen floor. He sat up and rubbed the back of his head. He remembered writing, or glaring at his screen… Right, he had had a panic attack. This was, without doubt, the worst attack he had been through yet.
“Yup.”
Here’s the sixth chapter of my fic:)
He stayed a few hours more until he stood up and walked out in the night. Somehow he managed to get home. He laid down on the couch and sighed.
“That Castiel?!”
“Maybe titanic?” Cass asked, a teasing smile playing on his lips.
Castiel sat at a table towards the back of the coffee shop, one elbow on the surface, head resting in hand, using his other hand to stir his sugary sweet coffee. Just as he shifted to pour in some more milk, the door jingled and he saw that it was Dean, dressed in the same boots, light colored jeans, with a dark green shirt and dark leather jacket. Castiel felt a little over dressed with his pressed black pants and button up shirt, but it was much too late to change now.
Castiel sighed, “I have to let it go. I dedicated my heart and body to God the day Lucifer died. I made vows, Gabriel, I can’t go back on that.”
“I already moved my things to another room. Try to get some rest, tonight was probably rough for you.” Castiel finally stood up, gripping the back of the chair. He took a deep breath, then left, pretending he could hear Dean crying.
“Do you need help?” The priest asked quietly, “we have a few programs through the church that specialize in domestic-“
“He what?” Sam asked, “you would never.” He looked offended.
“I have a question.”
“Well,” Castiel stalled as he looked down with burning cheeks.
Dean smiled as Castiel rolled his eyes and scooted closer, Castiel’s large hand coming to rest on his knee.
“Yes.” Castiel replied quietly.
Castiel’s heart nearly stopped in his chest and he hid his tears by pushing his face into Dean’s neck. “Why?” He whispered, why am not good enough for you, he doesn’t say.
Just as he realized he was hard, Dean stumbled through the door, looking tired.
“Dean? Hey Dean, the service is over.” Sam shook his brother as people all around started to stand slowly, “if you wanted to sleep we could have just stayed in the room.”
A few weeks go by without Dean leaving, which makes Castiel’s heart sing in happiness. He still gets this, gets the love and affection and now, occasionally, he gets to give Dean blowjobs and handjobs and he’s never been happier. Maybe he should be more concerned that his own boyfriend doesn’t want to touch him back, but he can’t bring himself to care.
“Then you are a good person.” Dean insisted, “that you would put aside all your pain to see your brother, after all he did? That’s pretty amazing, man.”
Micheal looked on with disgust in his face, “how dare you, Castiel. You would sin like this in your own house! God will never forgive you.” He advanced on the young boys, enjoying the look of terror that crossed Castiel’s face. “You,” he pointed at Josh, “this is your fault!”
He went over the his bed side dresser and pulled out a rustic, antique jewelry box. Sitting down on the edge of his twin sized bed he patted the spot next to him, encouraging Dean to sit. He opened the box and pulled out the only contents: a silver vessel with just enough glass showing to see a radiating, bright blue liquid-like substance swirling around inside.
“Holy-! Jesus, Cas. You scared the hell out of me!” Sam said, then, “oh god.”
“I was. After seeing the way those people treated you, I wanted you to know that I could do that for you without hurting you.”
“Oh uh, just plain black coffee will be fine, thanks.”
“It’s basically my job, man. I have to go back.”
“Morning, Bessy.” Dean said politely, “here to pay up for another week.”
“Oh?” Dean said with a laugh, letting his hands fall to grip Castiel’s thighs.
“Exploded because I was close, Dean. I was so close.”
Two days later, Castiel hadn’t seen Dean again and it was driving him crazy. Currently, while having lunch with Gabriel, his mind kept wondering back to green eyes, wild hair and smooth, so smooth, lips.
We learn about Castiel’s troubling past and our dudes get frisky.
The woman at the front desk had her hair up in a messy bun, make up light with thick mascara. She leaned heavily on the counter, pen in her hand, that mornings crossword puzzle from the paper a laid out in front of her. From what he could see from the counter, her clothes were dingy and old, stained by something he didn’t want to name. Castiel was never one to judge, so he paid no mind to the faint stench coming off the woman and stepped up to greet her.
They get coffee
——————
Castile nodded and proceeded to the line to order the drink, paid and made his way back to the table.
Castiel’s heart was pounding. Him and Dean have been together together, like dating together, for almost six months now. In all honesty he had expected to already have been taken to bed but it hasn’t happened yet. Castiel realized that he would have to initiate the second he saw Dean come out of their shared bathroom in only a towel, steam rolling out behind him.
“No, I know. I won’t tell him anything.” Dean said quickly, “I just- being in church, around Castiel, it made me feel closer to Mom somehow. Safer.”
“Didn’t break. Should I take that as an insult?” He asked as he slid off Castiel and laid next to him. He gave his lover a goofy smile as he opened his eyes, burry and unfocused.
Dean obliged happily, moaning at the feeling. He tried not to push too much, not wanting to scare Castiel away, but he couldn’t help himself. He placed both hands on Castiel’s cheeks, gently pressing his tongue against the other mans lips. His tongue danced with Castiel’s slowly, showing him just how to use his tongue to get his partner going. Castiel was definitely inexperienced when it came to most things sexual, which didn’t surprise Dean all that much. If anything, it was just another reason to like Castiel. This man was going to go possibly the rest of his life without doing this with another person but put all that on hold just because he thought Dean was special enough.
“Dean,” his father said in warning.
Castiel brought Dean into the church through a side door and to his room which wasn’t far from the entrance. He felt mildly embarrassed at the lack of items he had in his room, but with God in his life, he didn’t have much room for anything else.
“No, I was thinking about you, how much I like you. How happy I am since we started dating.” Castiel said quietly, cheeks burning in embarrassment.
“You make me feel so safe, Dean. I want to give everything to you.” Castiels eyes were wide and honest, taking Dean’s breath away at the implication.
“Fuck, are you crying?” Dean placed a palm against Castiels cheek, “I’m so sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t have done that. I won’t do that. Ever again, I promise.”
“So that’s it. We’re just over?” Dean whispered this, eyes begging Castiel to look up, but the angel doesn’t.
Castiel collapsed on Dean, unable to stop his legs from shaking. “Thank you, thank you.” He said between placing gentle kisses all over Dean’s face.
Castiel shuttered out a breath and closed the book he had been trying to read. He knew he would never get over Dean if all he ever did was sit in his room and think about the man. But. Going outside, seeing the light without being able to witness it laying on Dean’s beautiful face made him want to stay in the dark forever. Maybe he couldn’t go on like this. Maybe it wasn’t really worth fighting for anymore.
Dean beamed at him and surged up to kiss Castiel, both laughing in delight as they fell to the side, splaying out in the front seat.
“No, actually.” He said, shifting uncomfortably, “I was looking for someone who might be staying here.”
Castiel decided not to push it further and  hid under the covers, hiding away like if he can’t see Dean then none of this actually exists.
“You were at the bar all the time. You wouldn’t have sex with me and that first night you came home you had hickeys and bruises on your hips.” Castiel desperately wanted to reach out and touch Dean but didn’t know if he was allowed to anymore. How could he have though those terrible things about Dean? What kind of monster was he for making Dean feel like this?
Dean jerked up with a surprised shout as a bolt of pleasure shot through him, making his toes curl.
Castiel could tell Dean wasn’t up to telling him the real reason for the bruise, so he decided to change the subject, “how did you like the service?”
“I’ve wanted this for so long.” Dean grunted as he situated himself on Castiel’s lap. “So damn long.”
Castiel reached up and wiped a tear from his cheek, “yes, thank you. You cleared somethings up for me.”
Sam could deal with the rest of the Vamps.
Sams eyes softened, “that’s a good thing Cas, I promise. I know Dean isn’t very good with his words, but he does care about you, ok? You don’t have to have sex with him to make him love you or anything. If he had the... urge or whatever,” he looked sick, “then he can handle it himself.”
“Who you trying to convince here?” Gabriel asked with a slight laugh, dropping it after Castiel closed his eyes tightly, as if stoping tears. “So, tell me about him. What’s he like?”
“Was it one of the vampires?” Sam asked as he lifted Dean’s shirt to show a long cut on his side.
Dean turned to look at the priest, just as the man smiled.
“No time,” Castiel sat up and kissed Dean again, fingers angelically slicking as they trailed down Dean’s back and towards his ass. “Please, Dean. Let me inside?”
“What happened, Dean?”
“You’re right, I have to at least try. Where would I even start? For all I know he’s already left town.”
“Cas, man, hey,” Dean cupped Castiel’s cheek, pulling him back up. “No, not that. Not anymore. I wanna love you, Cas. All of you.”
“I would never ask you to stop hunting.” Castiel said, then, “but, then why would you have sex with me?”
“Hell yeah,” Dean pulled Castiel up and guided him to lay face down on the bed, a pillow under his hips. “Let’s erase that bad memory with a good one, yeah?” Dean asked as he pulled his pajama pants off.
“What about... Dean I know there are certain things you don’t want from me. Things that I want from you. How can we work if we can’t give each other what we need?” Castiel wanted to cling onto the hope but he knew it was pointless if he became weak again.
Castiel stopped breathing, eyes aching from how hard they were rolling. He surged up, curling around Dean’s head as he finally, finally, came, the glass from the lights not concerning him as they shattered around the room, riding the best high known to man.
“Sure, guess it couldn’t hurt. Follow me.”
Lucifer was glad he turned around because now he was grinning manically, “oh, good. That’s good, I’ll let you know when it‘s ready.” He said tightly, cheeks starting to hurt.
“Ye- Ah!” Dean shouted and shuttered from head to toe as another bolt ran though his body.
“A moment, please.” Castiel said, slowly moving his own hips, trying to get used to the feeling. Dean shifted then, angling further down so he would rub against his prostate. “Ha, yes, yes, yes. Move, move.”
“Dad?” Dean asked quietly and his fathers fingers tightened in his hair, “I’m sorry about not leaving a note, it won’t happen again.”
“Church?” Sam asked and turned around to fully face Dean, “I mean I wouldn’t mind, but do you think dad would actually let us go?”
Before Castiel could argue that Dean was most definitely not a gal, Dean kneeled in front of him, hand coming down to rest on his upper thigh. His thumb stroked up and down slowly, making Castiel’s breath catch in his throat.
“Cas?” Balthazar asked. “He hasn't been sleeping a lot and he unfortunately suffers from panic attacks.”
“Uh yes!” The man exclaimed.
Oh lord, Oh lord… What do I do?
Gabriel coked on laughter. “Jesus no, he usually just looks like he is about to kill someone or punch the screen and then kill someone.”
Reminder that every mental health issue this fic will contain is researched and not something I have experienced myself.
Here is the fourth part of my "in progress destiel fanfic"
“Good.” Balthazaer said.
And oh sweet jesus.
“I am aware, thank you.” Dean mumbled.
Dean uncomfortably shifted from foot to foot. He felt Gabriels look burn at his back. If looks could kill, Dean would be lying lifeless on the floor right now. He was a bit guilty for not telling the truth but he couldn't tell Gabriel that he had gone out and drinked away his feelings for Gabriel's brother. “Yeah…”
“Gonna miss you too darling.”
Enjoy:)
“Sorry what?” The man asked and choked on his coffee. “You can’t like it. It’s awful. I’m sorry but we can’t be friends anymore.”
“Yes.” Castiel said. “I am, besides, I am an adult. I can take care of myself for three days.”
Dean allowed himself to chuckle.
Don´t take that sinner from me…
“Dunno.” Dean said and took a sip.
“Are you okay?” He heard someone say.
“I'm never drinking again.” He muttered as he stood up and walked into the bathroom.
“If you want to, I can stay, I'll just tell Peter I cant this weekend.”
“The coffee is on the house.” Dean said after a second. “Your friend over there looks like he needs it.”
Give me the burden… Give me the blame…
Balthazar eyed him. “Are you sure, you look a bit pale.”
“I gotta dash now Gabe.” He said and grabbed his bag and put on his jacket. “See you tomorrow.”
“Hey Charlie.” He smiled. “What can I get you?”
The far too familiar ringing sound filled his head and his vision blurred slightly. “No, no…”
Gabriel sighed. “You are so stubborn Cas.”
“You look happy.” Gabriel remarked as Dean walked into the shop. He was once again sucking on a lollipop. “Has something good happened?”
“No problem.” Dean said and threw the wet cloth in the sink.
“I know what a boyfriend is.” Dean cut him off. “God, I am so stupid.”
“Thank you Gabe.” Castiel said. He got seated in the corner and opened his laptop. He actually had one idea but he didn’t know how to put it in words.
“Good. Better than it has in a few weeks.” Castiel said. “So can you two please quiet down a bit?”
“Thanks.” One of them said and smiled.
“Why so grumpy Dean?” Gabriel suddenly asked, peeking out from the kitchen.
“Yeah, not many customers today tho.” Gabriel said as Dean put down his bag on the floor with a thump. “I've only had five this far.”
“I can take the register today.” Dean said, silently hoping that the mysterious Cass would return. “It's your turn to be in the kitchen.
“Hey Gabriel.” Dean answered as he walked in behind the counter, “Everything good?”
They hugged quickly before walking into separate bedrooms. As soon as Castiel heard Balthazar's breathing slow down; the apartment had awfully thin walls, he opened his laptop and began to write. It all boiled down to him glaring at the screen. He checked the time and cursed. He had been awake for five hours. In one hour Balthazar would leave. He sighed and ran his hand through his hair, resulting in it sticking up in every possible direction.
There wasn't a wrong or a right he could choose…
He removed the pillow and cursed quietly as the light once again blinded him.
Dean was standing cleaning off the espresso machine as Gabriel walked in. “Hey Gabe, you good?” He asked without looking up from his task.
“Honestly I don’t know.” Castiel admitted. “I guess… I guess it’s scary when you’re alone. It feels like you are gonna die…”
“Cas?” He heard a raspy voice say from the hallway. “Why are you awake?”
I've fallen for someone who's nothing like you…
“Yes.” Dean sighed.
Dean chuckled softly and walked back out to Gabriel. The blonde man was leaning against the counter. A smirk played on his lips. “And how is everything with Benny?”
“Can you take my nightshift today?!” Gabriel shouted into the office.
“Maybe not in love but I definitely want to go out with him.” Dean laughed sadly and shook his head.
“Okay.” Gabriel said and smiled.
Honestly Dean didn't get how Gabriel could eat so much candy, the guy was definitely gonna end up in a hospital soon with sugar poisoning. A sweet tooth was the kindest way to put it.
“Don't question my gut Dean.” Gabriel said from the desk. “This is gonna be a busy day, soon.”
He heard Balthazar sigh. “Are you okay darling?”
“I promise.” Castiel said, well knowing he would probably not call him. “Imma head out for a walk. My head is throbbing.”
“Coming up.” Dean nodded and hurried over to the espresso machine. placing a cup under it and pressing the on button. When the coffee was done he handed the cup to the woman and she handed him the money.
“Okay.” Dean smiled. “Did you catch that Gabe?!”
The other one, Cass apparently. Just sighed and nodded quietly in defeat. They disappeared through the door. Dean kept his eyes on them as they disappeared into the night. He prayed to a higher power that they would come in again.
“You can stop by at mine whenever you want or need.” Gabriel said. “Okay?”
“Yeah.” Castiel said, managing to plaster a smile on his lips. “I am.”
Dean elbowed Gabriel as he walked past him. “Sometimes you are a nightmare Gabe.”
Gabriel chuckled and walked back into the kitchen. Castiel looked up at Dean for a second and smiled. “I apologise if I sounded rude before. I am used to telling that blonde nightmare to shut up.”
“Yup.”
Dean elbowed him in the side as he walked past him. Gabriel just chuckled softly.
After a while of glaring at the screen Gabriel approached the table. “How’s it going? You look like you want to punch the screen.”
“I promise.” Castiel said. “I will sleep.”
“Fucking hell…” He muttered.
“Can’t that wait until you’ve at least gotten five hours of sleep?”
“So… What about a movie night?” Cass asked the blonde one and leaned back in his chair.
He drank a glass of water and decided that if he ate now, he would probably not be able to keep it down. So he just grabbed his keys and walked out the door. It was a chilly morning and the sun had barely risen yet. He locked the door and began walking down the street against the subway. People rushed by him, on their way to work, or home to their families. Once again his thoughts returned to Cas.
“What do you mean by that Castiel?” Gabriel asked.
Then he told her about the mysterious man on the train. Cass. And his damn eyes.
Castiel was sitting in the kitchen of his and Balthazar’s shared apartment. It was late at night and he had just finished his fifth cup of coffee. He just had to write one more chapter before he could hit the hay.
“Dean!” The red headed girl exclaimed as he walked in. “Long time no see.”
Castiel unconsciously reached out. Trying to find something to hold on to. A hand grabbed him and squeezed carefully. How much time had passed? He didn't know. It could have been anything from five minutes to an hour. He was beginning to feel lightheaded. His head was spinning.
Castiel slowly and methodically became aware of his surroundings again. The ringing stopped almost completely and his breathing calmed down to the point where he managed to take a deep breath.
“You know…” Dean muttered. “The blonde one with the British accent.”
Here you have the sixth chapter of my fanfic, hope you’ll like it.
“Okay.” Castiel said and nodded.
“Yeah… at least I think so.” Castiel said. “Dunno.”
“Hey Cas.” Balthazar said. “Just wanted to check in, I've been calling for ten minutes. Why didn't you pick it up?”
Sincerely: Balthazar
“Sure.” Gabriel said. “Who doesn't love the scent of coffee in the morning?”
“No.” Castiel sighed. “Not again. You will go tomorrow.”
Then, finally, Castiel's breathing began to slow down. “Good.” Gabriel said. “Thats right. In and out…”
Dean just shrugged his shoulders in silence, I don't know really.
Their food came and they began to eat. They had both ordered pizza. “How is it going with the book?”
“Castiel Novak I swear to god, we are never watching that movie again. That goddamned song made me want to smite myself.” The blonde man said and raised a finger.
“Passed out?” Balthazar asked.
“It's okay, I got you.” The person murmured. “I promise, it's okay.”
“You do!” Charlie said happily. “He always talks about the mysterious Cas who comes into the shop sometimes. And he is like depressed because he has this boyfriend who comes in with him often.”
“You look like hell.” Gabriel laughed as Dean walked into the warm cafe.
“Yup.” Castiel muttered and sat down in a chair. “I had a panic attack, the worst one yet. I passed out I think. At least I woke up on the floor.”
“No problem Cass.” The other one smiled triumphantly and took a sip of his own coffee.
“Listen to me Castiel. In… and out…” Gabriel said softly.
The man returned to the table and pushed one of the cups in the hands of the man. “Please Cassy, drink.”
He ran his hand through his hair that already was standing in every possible direction. The computer screen remained as empty as for a few seconds before.
“No, stay with Peter. I will be okay.”
If Dean wasn't so embarrassed he would have graduated Charlie on being the first one to leave Gabriel speechless. He was staring at her with wide eyes. Then he turned to Dean.
“Screw you.” Dean muttered and headed into the kitchen. Soon he heard the first customer enter, they ordered an iced coffee.
Gabriel walked in with the order and handed it over to the man who paid. He got seated at one of the tables next to Castiel. Dean was amazed how Castiel didn't even react when the man sat down and began stirring his cup. Gabriel walked up to Dean. “He will probably not move for the next hour.” He said. “It's good that he's finally getting somewhere.”
Dean walked into the back room and threw his bag on a chair.
“Okay, love you.”
“So you have seen him three times in your life and you are in love?” Charlie asked.
Dean sighed. He was so stupid sometimes.
He's good and he's bad and he's all that I got…
He stood up and took support against the counter. Then, suddenly his phone rang. He sighed and picked it up.
“Not really, just that the hairdresser over the street has closed. Apparently her husband cheated on her with her co-worker and she wanted a new start.” Gabriel said and glanced out the window.
this is a chapter written from Cass pov.
*        *       *
“Yup. Thanks for taking my shift mate.”
“You are welcome Deano.” Gabriel smirked. “Now, collect yourself. I have a feeling this is gonna be a busy day.”
He had the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen, it was like two oceans that you immediately drowned in. The man gave a slight nod at Dean before looking back down and continuing to read. Dean sat down and pulled out his phone, scrolling through some old message convos to try and distract him from the stranger. Every now and then Dean looked up at the handsome stranger. The man's brows were furrowed as he read, like he was concentrating or was confused. Or both. As the train stopped where Dean was gonna get off, the man stayed. Dean was disappointed that the man didn't look up as he walked off. He would have wanted to see those eyes one more time. To once again drown in those blue oceans.
The arms squeezed gently and Castiel's breathing slowed down a small bit. The person started singing softly as they held Castiel;
“Hey, love sucks bro.” Charlie chuckled. “Sometimes.”
“No, you are not pulling an all-nighter again.” Balthazar said seriously. “You know it doesn’t end well.”
Dean sighed and straightened his back when another customer walked in.
“I'm sorry I'm late, I managed to sleep through all of my alarms.”
“It's okay Cassie.” Gabriel said. “Everything is okay.”
“Where the hell have you been?” Gabriel asked and poked his head through the kitchen opening. “Two hours Dean! You are lucky only my brother is here.”
Castiel didn't answer, it seemed like he didn't even hear the question. Gabriel once again appeared at Dean´s side.
A few hours later Dean was finally putting on his jacket to head home. Gabriel was cleaning off the tables.
“Wait what?” Gabriel asked.
After about forty minutes the two guys stood up. The blonde one kept a hand on the other's shoulder as they walked out. “Cass darling, I don't care about your damn book. If you don't sleep soon you will collapse.”
I'll shoulder the load and I'll swallow the shame…
Dean didn't argue. He just nodded and grabbed his things. “See you in the morning Gabe.”
The first customer of the day walked in. A long slim woman with a kid on her hip. “A black coffee please.” She said,
Cass took the cups and sat down. He handed the blonde one one of the cups. As he leaned down a bit to blow on the steaming coffee his hair fell down in his face. Dean would do anything to be able to run his hand through the soft looking hair. To trace those lips with his thumb and kiss them. He shook his head in an attempt to clear it. Jesus! He had met this man once before.
“Imma leave you to your work now.” Dean said. “Good luck.”
He pointed at Castiel who still didn't react. Dean's mind froze. “Brother?”
He grabbed a glass and filled it with ice and coffee. He also added some caramel syrup and snapped on the lid. Gabriel poked in his head and Dean handed him the mug. “Thank you.”
“But it can also be beautiful.” Charlie pointed out.
“Darling.” The man said. “It’s awful. Did you even watch?”
“Two cups of coffee and a sandwich.” He ordered and looked up at the menu.
When Castiel woke up in the morning it was quiet in the apartment. He sat up and rubbed his eyes. A big yawn escaped him. He stood up and walked into the kitchen. A small note
Please leave comments on what you think. And let me know if I got something wrong.
The women paid and sat down. Clattering from glass sounded from the kitchen. Gabriel came out balancing two cups and plates on a tray. He gave it to Dean who rounded the counter and walked up to the women's table and placed the tray down. “Two espressos and brownies for you ladies.”
“See you tomorrow Deano.” Gabriel said and waved as Dean opened the door and walked out in the cold October evening. He shuddered and cursed himself for taking his leather jacket. The wind was blowing hard and his breathing turned into small smoke clouds. He started walking towards the subway to get home.
Castiel's breathing slowed down more and the ringing began to quiet down.
Dean's heart sank. Those two were dating. Of course they were dating. He bowed his head down and sighed.
“Cas?” Balthazar asked, voice worried. “Are you okay?”
“I actually never quite liked him.” Gabriel pointed out and shrugged his shoulders.
“Panic attack.” Castiel waved him off. “Hyperventilating stuff you know.”
“Boyfriend, you know, when you like a boy and you two get together and-”
“Do you like him?” He asked.
“Yeah.” Cass said.
“No it can’t Balthy.” Castiel said tiredly. “I need to finish this.”
“Green tea please.” Someone answered.
When Dean woke up the next morning his head was pounding. He was nasuase and his body felt heavy. He cracked his eyes open and immediately regretted the decision. The light that shone in from between the blinds made his head explode. He groaned and grabbed a pillow from beside him. Pressing it over his face, trying to block out the light.
“Kay, I believe you, but next time you call the second you wake up.”
“Sure thing.” Dean smiled and typed into the register.
Enjoy!<3
“Are you okay darling?” Balthazar asked.
The trenchcoated man looked up and sighed. “Okay, thank you darling.”
“Bye bye Cassie.” Gabriel said.
“Have you been sleeping? You’re pale.”
Hey, here you got chapter five. This fic will also contain alcoholism, so if you are triggered by that I would advice to go and read something else:) enjoy!
Chapter two of my fanfic; A cup of bittersweet.
“I know you love me.” Cas teased and wiped his eyes.
“That was my brother Castiel.” Gabriel said and walked behind the counter again. “He suffers from panic attacks.”
He stood up too once again to fill his cup. As he walked over to the coffee machine he heard soft steps against the oak floor. Great, Balthazar had woken up.
Gabriel carefully wrapped his arm around the shaking man's shoulders. “In and out… come on…”
Castiel nodded. “Night Balthy, imma miss you.”
About one hour went by before they stood up and walked out from the restaurant. They just managed to catch the train that rolled in the second they came down the stairs.
“Shut up.” Dean grumbled.
Castiel leaned over and laughed. “Jesus Balthy. You really hated that movie.”
“I don't think we were right for each other anyway.” Dean admitted.
“Yeah.” Dean said and typed into the register. “That was me. Is that all?”
“I guess so.” Castiel said distantly. He was thinking how the hell he would be able to go three days without the only thing that kept him sane during his panic attacks. That, by the way, seemed to become more and more.
Dean straightened up and took his eyes off the man as another customer walked in. “An espresso please.” She said, “Extra foam.”
“Are you working on your book today?” Gabriel asked as he typed into the register.
“Are you okay now?” Gabriel asked, his voice worried.
Gabriel walked to the door, unlocked it and turned the closed sign to open. Then he shuffled into the kitchen and Dean leaned against the counter. The door opened and two people walked in. Dean sighed, it wasn't the two from yesterday. It was two women.
“Hey Deano!” Gabriel, his co-worker, greeted him as he stepped into the coffee shop. Sucking on a lollipop.
“What?” Dean asked, surprised.
He closed his eyes and dozed off.
Dean hugged the girl. “Two beers please.”
Soon the coffee was done and he poured it into a cup. He took a sip and sighed. This was just what he needed.
“Dean! Chop chop!” Gabriel yelled into the kitchen. “As my gut said, customers.”
Castiel chuckled quietly. “Why were you late?”
“Bye Gabe.” Dean said. “See you tomorrow.”
“Hey Cassie!” The blonde nightmare said and grinned.
Give me the burden… Give me the blame…
“I promise.”
Here is the second chapter, as said, every mental health issue that this story will contain is researched and not something i have experienced myself. Please leave comments.
“Okay. You go home now and rest.” Gabriel said softly. “No more writing today.”
Dean was walking against the cafe. He knew he was late but he had managed to sleep through all of his alarms. His head was pounding and he was nauseous. He buried his hands in his pockets and slowly breathed out. He was never gonna drink again.
“I know what a fucking brother is Gabriel.” Dean said.
“Yes, and it’s a complete nightmare. I have no ideas.”
He internally cursed when he saw Balthazar and Castiel. They were sitting in the seats closest to the doors, which meant Dean had to pass them in order to sit down.
He glanced at the man. His eyes were tired and he had dark circles under his eyes. He was glaring at his computer screen with the same frown as yesterday.
Don't take… that sinner… from me....
“Okay. I will call tonight.”
“Good.” Balthazar said. “Now sleep darling. You need to.”
As Dean walked into his apartment and closed the door all he could think about was that man. His blue eyes and ruffled hair. The way he had frowned…
“Is it really okay?” Balthazar asked.
“I need coffee…” He grumbled and stood up. He passed out in the kitchen and put on a pot. As he waited for it to boil he leaned against the counter. How could he go three days without the only person who was able to keep him sorta grounded during his attacks? But yet again, Balthazar should go out and meet other people than him.
“Yeah but,” Dean shook his head, “I thought you were only doing that to make me feel better.”
“Wasn’t sleeping.” Dean mumbled, “come with me, I want to introduce you to someone.” He stood and walked towards the front of the huge church, where Castiel and another priest were talking with some members.
Castiel spluttered, cheeks burning.
“Yeah, maybe it is.” Dean stood up, ready to leave this conversation. He got Cas in the end, that’s all that mattered.
Dean huffed air though his nose and smiled slightly, “figures. You’re a friggin’ angel, eh?”
Just then, the bell on the front door rang, causing Castiel to look back and see his topic of interest walking through the door. Dean stopped when he saw Castiel then made his way to the counter.
“Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?” Castiel asked, slowly, unsure of himself. He’s never tried to seduce anyone before, but this was Dean, it should be as easy as breathing.
