"Bucky and Steve were inseparable," Sarah explained, shaking her head in fond exasperation, "they constantly got into trouble together, but it was expected when you think about how they met! Want to tell the story?" Sarah asked her son.
Tony laughed, his voice sounding a little wet and eyes still having this moist look. "I never said you can't."
“Vanilla and orange blossom. I had a feeling you will like it,” Tony smiled, adding the bath bomb to the pile in the basket.
Sam waved the baguette in warning at this friend but smiled back. It wasn't something he ever imagined himself doing, but overall it was a fun experience. Maybe Parfait would appear in the Pitted Olive from time to time. Steve enjoyed seeing Sam like that, more opened and relaxed, the previous tension gone. Getting in touch with his female side did a great thing for Sam.
"Maybe, but it isn't our concern. And from what I heard, Stark is no saint either. They deserve each other," Bucky said, closing his locker.
“This is Steve. Steve, this is Loki,” Tony introduced them, and Steve lowered his head in a greeting. Loki didn’t return the gesture. “Steve is writing an article about me.”
But why try to break something that went together hand in hand? He just had to say it. For his own sanity. It was hard, but he had to, to quiet his heart and mind.
Tony laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He just wanted to have a calm, afternoon nap. Just him, warm covers, and some sleep. When Steve had decided to join, it was even better, because the super soldier serum made him a living furnace and Tony liked the idea of being cuddled into something nice and heated. He just didn’t expect that his nice and heated thing would gently poke all over him, finding sensitive spots and wriggling fingers into them.
"Oh, right!" she said, suddenly remembering that the time was passing and her shift would soon start. "Hey, come to my bar, we will talk some more. And we could meet one day and catch up. I have to get ready now," she reached her hand for the aloe and Red Velvet tossed it to her. "Thanks! I will see you both later!"
“Oh,” Tony gasped, feeling a distinctive hardness on Steve’s body. “Hm. I guess having a younger lover has its perks,” Tony giggled and Steve quieted him down with more kisses.
"I am gonna walk you there," Tiberius Stone, a buff and handsome senior from a rich family, offered charmingly taking the books out of Tony's hands. "After all, this is my duty as your boyfriend, right?" he smiled in a way that could be seen as loving, pulling the smaller teen closer to himself and Tony had to try hard to not let the fear show on his face. Why Stone couldn't just leave him alone?
He looked at the closed door, trying to remember where Tony had said the shower was because he could use a one. A very, very cold one.
“Hey,” Arrow turned her blue eyes to Sam, deciding to jump on the torment Sam wagon. “Aren’t you the one working at Mama’s Little Bakery in downtown? The one with pink and frilly curtains in the windows?”
Steve frowned, of course, knowing that. “But it is just 3 pm,” he said, not wanting Tony to leave yet. The show was supposed to start in six hours.
"That's sweet," Steve said, laughing when Bucky cursed, which was a lot less sweet, but a whole lot more amusing. "I don't know why you are so upset about this."
It was a change for sure. Steve turned his hands and looked at the fronts and bottoms, quite liking what he was seeing. Who would have thought that hands could look so nice?
Steve smiled, feeling that he had an upper hand in this matter and handed two lipsticks back to Tony. “I work in an art supply store, Tony. I can tell shades of red apart,” he explained, sounding smug and Tony smiled cheekily.
"I am going to the back," Steve pointed at the door leading to the staff only area, letting the kids resolve this one between themselves. He heard the banter and smiled, thinking that since Sam made a decision to take interns from the baking school, the bakery became much more lively. Entering the kitchen was a whole new experience. The shop part looked sweet and inviting, set in light pinks and cream colors, just as Sam's mom designed. The kitchen was white, with a lot of silver utensils, and the most colorful sprinkles and icing stashed neatly on the shelves. It was perfectly organized.
"I am here, I am here!" Steve barreled into the baby room, almost tripping over some toys laying on the floor. Still better than stepping barefoot on one of the colorful, wooden blocks, Peter liked to toss into a basket and then dump everything out. He skidded to his weeping husband and handed Tony the bottle.
It took one press on the small of his lover's back to get the legs open wider, and Steve was very grateful that Tony maintained the acquired skill of doing split from his teenage years. It was a gift in their bedroom play.
It was as happy as it could be, and Steve and Red were getting lost in each other when the final person and a very late guest showed up.
"Mhm," when the kiss ended, Tony opened his eyes and smiled at Steve, dazed and starry-eyed, the moment disappearing when he saw how somber his boyfriend's eyes were. "What's wrong?" Tony asked, not understanding. Steve had this peculiar look on his face, that looked a lot like disappointment. Which wasn't appropriate after mind-blowing sex. Unless... "Oh, shit, I am sorry, you didn't-"
"Mhhhm," Steve smiled, savoring the sweet flavor of the pancakes and the spongy, melting in his mouth texture. Tony wasn't as bad in the kitchen as everyone assumed he was, but had some difficulties with properly measuring the time for cooking, so sometimes he burnt or left the food not fully cooked. This was perfect, just like Tony could perfectly make omelets and scrambled eggs, mastering the two simple dishes and elevating them.
"Now, as I was saying," Sarah clapped in her hands, "shoes off, hands clean and we can sit to dinner -"
"It will be fine, babe," Steve said in a low, comforting voice. It felt like he had repeated those words over one hundred times already, but he could understand and sympathize with Tony's nervousness. Tony was always so confident and full of bravado, and there was something incredibly sweet in seeing him so vulnerable. Or more, in allowing himself to be so vulnerable in front of Steve. No mask, no filters, just Tony.
Steve let out a long, tired breath, enjoying the silence. Parenthood was hard, but the sight of Tony and his son together was the most beautiful reward. It was all worth for such sweet moments.
"I can feel you smirking, if you don't put me down right now, you will be sleeping on this damn couch for the rest of the month!"
"At least I tucked in properly at my first attempt!" Sam defended his name choice while ridiculing the origin of Bucky's drag name. Tootsie Roll was a good name too.
“What? Villains have much more interesting lives than heroes. And I am definitely a queen,” Tony joked, flopping some curls near his ear away in a playful manner.
That was nice. The flickering lights in the background, coming from their private Christmas tree reminded Tony that he should be nice too. “Thanks for the pizza. I was getting hungry down there.”
Steve heard a voice and stared when he saw Bucky, standing in the doorway leading to the backspace. Hair ruffled from sleep, some smudged makeup under his eyes, and a spare set of white clothes, shirt, and pants, Sam used while baking, all crumpled. Comparing to Sam's work look, Bucky looked like a total mess.
Steve was grinning, watching Tony crumbling and laughing, coming apart under his fingers. Steve was right, it was a win-win for both of them.
They would pay for this. Stone turned to the blond, still seeing a fist raised in his direction, while the brunet teenager had Hammer in the same position. "This isn't your business, get out of here!" he yelled out, curling his fists and throwing a punch at the blond. In a second, he was knocked out, landing in the mud, blinded by another punch.
“I saw it. And I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. Steve died in front of me. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.”
“There isn’t one, I just want you to know that we all trust you with our lives. We have so much respect for what you do and I want to get you to believe me. I’ll tell you everyday if I have to,” he promised. Tony stared at him like he was crazy but ultimately laughed lightly and pressed his forehead into his chest while embracing Steve in a crushing hug.
“I wanted you to stop rambling,” he said rolling his eyes. “Yeah, you created Ultron, but I know you. You thought that Ultron would be a viable solution to a real problem and I understand why you did it.”
“Me too darlin’, give me a hand,” Tony moaned arching his back. Steve reached down blindly to grab Tony and give him a few quick tugs until he was shouting out profanities while he came. He moved his other hand up to Tony’s mouth to muffle the noise while he stilled his hand to carry Tony through the rest of his orgasm. Tony pressed a small kiss to the inside of his hand and clenched around Steve once again.
“Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.” Steve swallowed his anger and set his bag next to the bed. He knew that Tony would say anything to avoid talking and he would have to be patient.
“Normally I would be sorry but these are really, really, comfortable,” Tony responded with a sly grin as he hopped back onto the bed.
“You know that Nat and Clint have a bet about what we're doing up here?” Tony threw his head back and laughed.
“Fuck Tony,” he said shifting himself forward. Tony pulled off of him slightly before pushing himself back.
“Jesus christ Stark,” he felt himself bucking his hips involuntarily. Tony continued bobbing his head up and down as he swirled his tongue around the head and sucking softly. After what could've been 5 minutes or 5 hours, he really didn't know, he carefully pulled Tony’s head up until his cock popped out of his mouth.
“You have nothing to be sorry about,” Tony laughed softly, curling his fist around his dick and licking a long stripe down the side.
“I can put on a shirt if this makes you or I mean if this looks awkward or no bad I uh,” he said flustered.
“You say ‘sorry’ too much,” Tony teased. “Are you sure you’re okay? You look really uncomfortable and I would say it’s because I’m shirtless, but you are also, well,” he gestured to Steve’s torso. Then he pulled on one of his close fitting black shirts.
“I don’t know,” he said looking up at Tony who raised an eyebrow and smirked. “I mean, I think that you’re, uh well, you're just very,” he gestured to Tony’s torso awkwardly. “It means yes, alright,” he blushed.
“I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.”
Their relationship was a mystery to both him and the entire team. When they were on the field they coordinated well for the most part, with a couple scuffles here and there. When they were at the tower eating meals with the team they would help eachother cook meals and set the tables (how had his life with these crazy people seen domestic days?). When he had taken the responsibility of teaching Steve about pop culture, they could sit together on the couch and laugh for hours on end; except for the time that they had watched the titanic and Steve had gotten ansty at the sex scene, and then horrified at the ship sinking.
“Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time,” Steve growled.
“I’m nothing special, Capsicle. Not next to you,” Tony muttered turning back towards the bathroom to grab a washcloth.
“Cap, you don’t have to return any favors,” Tony laughed. “Are you sure that you’re okay?” he added, turning over towards Steve.
“Tony it is not my place to meddle in your personal life, but the relationship between you and the Captain is on a crux. None of us are quite sure which way you two will fall.”
“Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception,” Steve said, throwing another log onto his large pile of firewood.
“Well, yeah I want to know that later maybe. But I just want to know why you didn’t tell me about it.”
“Who’s on what side?” he chuckled, shaking his head. “Oh no Cap, I’m not ruining my chances. Tomorrow morning I’ll tell ya who won,” he said with an evil smirk. “You're in the first room to your right, up the stairs. Good luck on your mission Captain Rogers.”
“I’ll take Tony.” Clint raised his brow and stared at him. “Don’t give me that look, you know that isn’t how I mean it.”
“Good lord Steve,” Tony muttered pulling away, “use me, don't hold yourself back,” he growled, clicking his tongue.
“I know, you’ll be alright in a minute,” he assured, leaning down to plant small kisses to smooth skin.
“Yeah, I'll give her a kick.” As he turned to leave he looked back to his pile of chopped wood. “Don't take from my pile.” He left quickly before he could see the angry reaction from the Captain. When he got to the barn it was none other than Fury lying in wait. Fury lectured him like he normally did when they got together, but he felt like he was still being attacked from all sides.
“If we did fuck - oh I’m sorry, if we made love, who would win the bet? Because we already argued,” Tony remarked.
“Oh I love when you swear,” Tony groaned as he continued to fuck himself on Steve’s cock. “Wanna help me out Capsicle?” Steve snapped his hips forward and grabbed Tony’s slim shoulders for leverage as he began pounding into him at a brutal pace.
“Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him,” he pointed out going for another log.
“Okay well Steve you can stay with, uhm. Well your options are stay in a room with Stark, or sleep on the jet,” Clint looked at him apologetically.
“- that would end the team,” he barked. “Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?!” That’s when Steve took the log he was holding and ripped it in half like it was paper. Tony felt his heart jump a bit after that.
“Right,” he flinched. Tony was suddenly right there leaning over him and pushing his hands away from his face. He then gave him a devilish grin before he swung his leg over Steve’s torso and he sat on his knees over him.
“Really?” Tony exclaimed, sliding his hands under his waistband. Steve threw his head back laughing at the genius who was acting like a kid on christmas.
“Huh,” he breathed, letting his body sink into Tony’s touch. Tony worked at a tantalizing pace, carefully circling the knots in his back until he felt himself leaning backwards towards the engineer. He slowly ran his hands down Steve’s sides until he was rubbing them across his lower back.
“Damnit.” Tony was only joking about sex, and it had brought his mind to the dangerous place of his fantasies. He groaned angrily, because he should not jack off in his teammates bathroom while the teammate of his infatuation sat right outside the door. “Shit the things you do to me,” he muttered looking at the ceiling. He felt relieved when his dick was freed from his jeans but he tucked himself into his waistband and pulled on black sweats, brushed his teeth, and walked out of the bathroom thinking about war and the horrible Titanic movie Tony made him watch. It helped a bit. He dropped his bag by the door and looked over at Tony who was pulling off his t-shirt.
“You have to make me, because I don’t know how to shut up on my own. I just really like the sound of my own voice and I mean who wouldn’t, I’m a charmer -” Steve rolled over and pressed his lips against Tony’s until he felt him melt into the kiss.
“If it’s a bad idea then you should probably stop me,” he muttered before leaning back down and sucking on another part of his neck.
“I promise, it’s uh nothing important. I’m okay I swear. Better than okay now,” he forced a smile to hide his anxiety. Then he very ungracefully tried to readjust his erection under the blanket and Tony, being Tony, simply lifted the sheet and said, “oh.” “Damn it Tony stop that,” he yanked the blanket back down and rolled to the edge of the bed.
“I’m sorry I don’t hate you, I swear. I don’t… I mean maybe I’m just… shit I don’t know how to say this kind of stuff,” he cried shaking his head. Steve sat next to him on the bed and hunched over with his elbows on his knees.
“Just sit up Steve, for one minute,” Tony pushed on his shoulder. So he listened and forced himself to sit up on the mattress. “Now just swing your legs over the edge of the bed there.”
“Mmm your Brooklyn accent is gorgeous,” he responded, his lithe body stretching like a cat. Steve leaned down to Tony’s ass and slowly ran his tongue over his rim.
“- no.” Tony sat back on Steve’s stomach and ran his fingers in circles around his nipples, making him tempted to buck his hips, but he held himself back.
“I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.”
“Steve you keep saying you’re okay but you're acting… a bit off. You’re making me worry which I don’t like to do about just anyone,” he said looking at him with a very serious expression that he seldom wore.
Tony closed his eyes against the thought, burying his face into crossed arms as he pulled his knees tightly to his chest. This couldn’t be real. None of this was. How could it be? He wasn’t dead. Steve wasn’t dead. This was all a lie, a trick. He wanted to go home, to his own time. He needed to go back. He had to go back.
Natasha was quiet as she slowed her steps, halting their walk in the hall. “Have you talked to him about it?”
“Says who?” Tony was closing in on Steve now, uncaring of pretenses, feeling slightly desperate. He knew he was losing his grip on the situation, but he could also see Steve cracking, slowly but surely. “Look, we both made mistakes, and I might not be able to forgive you for yours, and you might not be able to forgive me for mine, but we can still find some kind of understanding, at the very least? Christ, Steve, I...I want to fix this.” He motioned between the two of them with one hand, trying for a smile. “I need to fix this. I need you, Cap. I’m not half as good at anything as I am when I’m doing it next to you**. We both know that.”
Natasha stared hard at Steve, before turning around. “No,” she said sweetly, no semblance of her previous anger to be found. It reminded Steve of just how terrifying the woman could be. “Water’s on the bottom shelf, if Sam remembered to restock it.”
God, was he even time traveling anymore? Or was he just fucking everything up? Had he changed the timeline? Entered an alternate universe? His head ached with the possibilities, and he pulled at his hair. “Get a grip, Stark. Just think. Take in your surroundings. There has to be something here—“
Tony closed the door, bottle of water now in hand. He opened it, moving to the island to drop the cap on it. He took a small sip before placing it beside the cap. “Back there. With Bruce. You guys get into a fight I don’t know about? Not that it’s necessarily any of my business, but...”
“Not a priority?” Steve asked, leaning forward in his seat. “We’ve seen the damage the Hulk can do, and how easily he can be turned against us.” Wanda dipped her chin at that, eyes down, and Steve felt a moment of remorse for bringing up the reminder. “So, if you’re going to be a part of this team, which is why I assume you’re here, what’s the fail safe? Or did you just think everything would work out, like with Ultron?”
“I thought fugitives were supposed to be all about laying low,” Tony teased, eyeing the bike appreciatively. He’d stopped at the edge of the porch, unable to will himself any further. As petty as it was, he wanted Steve to come to him.
Tony dropped it quickly, unable to watch the flutter of emotions flickering through Steve’s gaze as he did.
“I was just....worried. About you,” Steve tried, thinking of some way to explain that whatever Tony was reading into wasn’t what he thought it was. Was it?
“I’m sorry,” he said. More tears fell from his eyes, but he didn’t care. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know…”
Tony saw right through him, offended Steve would even try to lie to him, especially now. “Look, as much as I adore the boy scout schtick, it’s kind of pissing me off right now.”
Steve felt a jolt of panic pass through him, and he looked away pointedly, hating how his hands were currently, well, tied. “I wasn’t jealous.”
With that she left, maneuvering easily around Tony and disappearing out the door. When it closed, Steve just stood there, a wave of instant guilt crashing over him.
Besides, it wasn’t like anyone could really blame him for wanting to covet a sleeping Steve to himself.
“It is strange, though. Sam said something similar happened to him a few weeks ago,” Tony began, cap forgotten. He was only looking at Steve now, and Steve had a bad feeling about that. “It is quite an achievement, to earn the wraith of Captain America.
A heavy silence fell between the two of them as they just stared, some absurd game of manly chicken being played between them, and Tony made sure to break it. “Come on, I didn’t invite you here to just stand outside.” He didn’t wait for Steve before heading back inside.
Natasha waved a hand. “Anytime. Oh, and while you’re washing up, make sure to get that green off your face. It’s not a good look on you.”
“Maybe not aloud,” Natasha admitted, and Steve couldn’t hold her gaze, giving her the fuel to keep going. “You’re compromised, Rogers. And now it’s bleeding into everything, including the team.”
“I didn’t mean to ignore you,” he began, still not looking at Steve. His shoulders were sagged, and he leaned forward a bit, as if bracing himself. “I just got....busy, I guess? With, well, everything.” He paused, huffing a small laugh. “I was so focused on fixing things, I ended up breaking something else, huh?”
“Here,” he said finally, gesturing it toward Tony, outstretched. “I thought I should return it. I...” He threw in a smile, barely visible in the moonlight. “Turns out you were right after all.”
“Do you know how long I...” Steve started, words seeming to fall out of him before morphing into a contented sigh.
“Can I talk to you a moment?” She asked, and Steve didn’t have to be a telepath to know the only answer to that question right now was yes. So, he followed her out of the room and down the hall to the main kitchen. It wasn’t very large, considering the size of the compound, but it also wasn’t the only one either.
Iron Man’s faceplate turned his way, and for a moment Tony wondered if he’d heard him, if he could see himself standing to the side, desperate and broken and warning him to stop while he could, to stop breaking everything they’d worked so hard to achieve.
. This couldn’t be happening. Had he changed the timeline? Created a new one? Would Steve still be alive when he got back? Would he be? He felt like he was spiraling, falling further and further into god knows where.
Steve was silent a long time before realization seemed to dawn on him. “Wait, you’re in love with me?”
“Sorry, I was just,” He looked around a moment before spotting the fridge and pointed to it. “Looking for some water. Public speaking always dries me out faster than a sauna. Am I interrupting something?”
“Tony, it wasn’t real,” Steve reminded, giving a quick, reassuring squeeze with his hand before lifting it, retreating back.
They sat like that a while, just touching each other, keeping close, before Tony broke the moment, hand dropping from Steve. Steve missed it instantly.
Tony sighed, as if expecting the question. “What aren’t I trying to fix? After Ultron, I needed to... make amends. Right my wrongs, and all that stuff. I fucked up, and I’m not too proud to admit it, even if it does hurt.” He threw Steve a cheeky grin, but when Steve didn’t react to it, it dropped, returning his expression to something more serious, grimmer. “I also realized that we’re vulnerable. All of us. You, me, the team. There’s so much out there we don’t know about or understand, and I just wanted to protect us from that. But I shut everyone else out while doing so, and that was on me. So, I’m trying. I really am.”
He wasn’t sure if time in the present passed differently while traveling through time. He’d hoped it hadn’t been long. And if it had been, Strange would surely have come looking for him by now, right?
For a moment, Tony could almost pretend there was genuine concern in those words. “As alright as it can be, I suppose. Given the circumstances.” He hadn’t meant to let the implications lie, yet there they were, exposed.
“God, Tony,” Steve said, and he honestly sounded like he might cry. “I don’t know what I ever did to deserve you.”
“Well, maybe if you didn’t just talk over people all the time and listened to them every once in a while,” Steve exclaimed, gestures a bit more animated, anger growing. "God, you can be so infuriating sometimes.”
Tony lay curled on his chest, hand roaming Steve’s own skin lazily. He honestly thought he could stare at his body forever, especially when he knew what it was capable of. “Yeah, that came through pretty loud and clear when you came inside me three times.” He smiled when Steve tensed beneath him, obviously embarrassed. “God bless the super soldier serum.”
“It’s okay,” he said quietly, barely audible so Tony was sure only he could hear. “I’m okay. I’m here.”
“Often enough,” Tony admitted, looking down at the cap, twisting it between his fingers. “He’s the only one who can wade through my rambling. Plus, his setup is nicer than mine. Cleaner.”
Sarah arrived about ten minutes earlier than Steve asked her to, firm in her belief that it was better to be a bit earlier and wait instead of being late and making someone wait for her, a view she successfully passed to her only son. That's why she expected Steve to already wait for her and she really wished he did, not understanding why her son asked her to come. Sarah looked from her phone to the brightly shining neon, unsure if Steve gave her the correct address. The name was the same, but the reality didn't match her expectations. The Pitted Olive in her head was a name suitable for an Italian restaurant and not for something that looked like a night cocktail bar. Besides, her son didn't drink a lot of alcohol and was more of a beer guy than a cocktail person, so why he invited her to a bar and sounded so urgent about it?
"Sounds good," Tony smiled, taking the unlit cigarette out of his mouth and standing on his toes to kiss Steve for goodbye. Their lips met in a quick kiss, but something else also took place during the short moment.
Well, even if Steve was in a mood for quieter, more tranquil sex, he still wanted to be a top performer and delivered and delivered and delivered until both of them came in a tremble, Steve gritting his teeth when the pleasure reached its peak, Tony's arms giving up as he fell forward into the bed, letting out a long, pleased shrill, that instead of being taken as a compliment, just made Steve's ears ache.
"Tell what?" Tony asked, closing the door, and Steve caught the glimpse of Bucky waving his hand in front of Clint's eyes, trying to get a reaction.
“My show is about to start,” Red Velvet said and Steve’s eyes widened. When did the time fly? “Are you coming?” she asked, walking to the door.
“What?” she asked, stopping the kisses, cheeks flushed as she looked at Steve with glazed eyes. She did sound a little irritated, as if not believing that Steve was spoiling the moment for both of them.
Flawless indeed. Even Tony's skin looked smooth and plump, and maybe Steve should reconsider his statement on not letting Tony massage tsubaki oil into his face every evening, unlike Tony did.
“No,” Coulson smiled brighter as if just waiting for Tony to snark at him and being satisfied with what he got. “Good day, Mr. Stark,” he said and finally started to leave Tony’s sanctuary.
No, Steve would never think that. Tony was the great love of his life and Steve accepted him on every level.
Steve was still wrapped in blissful sleep when he felt it. The dip of the bed, the thigh pressing against his leg, radiating characteristic heat. Someone looking at his face and leaning in, soft breathing hearable in the quiet surroundings. Steve thought that wakening up by a kiss was a quite good scenario, a scenario he would happily follow. It just wasn't this scenario.
The office turned out to be a room full of stacks of papers and crumpled notes piling on a sturdy wooden desk and, to Steve's surprise, a calendar with photos of cats. Huh.
“Just remember to gently coat the skin, don’t work it in,” Tony said, showing on his face to which areas apply the mask. “Fifteen minutes is plenty of time to let it sit.”
“And please, folks, remember to keep hands to yourself. Otherwise, you may never know if they won’t get chopped off, especially if you interrupt a drag queen.”
"Thank you, honey," Steve leaned in closer, kissing Tony and strongly tasting coffee on his husband's lips. Well, Tony had to somehow keep himself awake.
"HAH!" Tony's head jerked up, sparkles showing in his eyes. Bingo. Steve indulged his lover with few more precise moves, watching Tony's face became heated, moans and gasp falling from his lips and when they reached the desired level of loudness, Steve slowly withdrew his hand. "Wait-what?" Tony asked, eyes opening wide when he felt the unwelcomed emptiness. "What the fuck, Ste-"
Steve pursed his lips together, feeling upset that Tony was so willing to share with strangers, but not with him. This whole site seemed so secretive, and while Steve felt a bit betrayed, he started to think about things from Tony’s perspective. Tickling wasn’t a mainstream kink. Bondage, spanking, food play - all the things they had tried seemed to be more acceptable in the sex world while tickling… Some people enjoyed it, some hated it. Steve was somewhere in between. It could be a fun thing among loved ones, but could quickly become overwhelming and unbearable. Steve didn’t think about it earlier, but he really liked tickling Tony. He loved the way his body twitched, the sound of his laughter, and the feeling of closeness and trust in the action. For Steve it was fun. For Tony, it had to run much deeper, forming stronger connections than it did for Steve.
"Okay, stop yelling at me," Steve asked, standing behind his naked boyfriend and pulling him closer to himself. He pressed a kiss to the damp hair and Tony huffed, partially cheered up. When Steve moved his hands down Tony's torso and rubbed him just in the right places, Tony shivered, definitely more cheered up.
Steve watched and listened, adoring every word, every subtle gesture. The way light fell on her face and long eyelashes cast shadows on pale cheeks. Her voice was smooth and deep, but raspy on the edges, showing some masculinity. It was a beautiful mix.
One - it was pretty tedious to keep up with everything. Tony eagerly showed him all social accounts he had - Twitter, Instagram, Facebook profile, Youtube, and it all just gave him a headache as Tony chattered which media was good for what and gladly showed him his own Instagram page (mostly workshop photos and meals Steve had prepared for him, which was kinda sweet) and if Steve became slightly interested in that, his interest dropped after hearing about filters and tags. Too much work.
"Go ahead," Steve waved his hand in a carefree manner, "just so you know, my mom can accept a lot of things, but not willingly giving yourself lung cancer."
“So… You are not disappointed in me?” he asked, genuinely surprised. It would be so heartbreaking that Tony could be so insecure if the circumstances weren’t so hilarious.
"Move," this time Tiberius addressed Tony, pushing him roughly forward. Not having a choice, Tony lowered his head and walked. Just last until the end of this year. Then Stone would go to college and he would be free. Just a few more months.
"Which kid needs more than two friends?" Tony asked, not waiting for an answer. "I had one friend growing up, you had one friend, we both turned out fine," Tony rambled, and Steve felt a little soft, planting a kiss into his husband's fluffy hair. Steve understood the concern but still felt a bit bad for Peter who had an adamant curfew and didn't participate in typical high school parties too often, forbade by both of them. Being Captain America and Iron Man's son wasn't easy and both Tony and Steve always had this thought at the back of their heads that Peter might get used by fake friends, people who want to take advantage of his status. Tony and Steve met two of Peter's friends, Ned and Michelle, Ned being a computer enthusiast and Michelle, more commonly known as MJ, a girl with a sarcastic, guarded demeanor who was slowly opening up. Neither Tony and Steve were blind and could see the affectionate looks measured both by Peter and MJ at each other when they thought the other wasn't looking and it had all the potential to turn into something more meaningful with time.
"Tony!" Steve gasped when many days later he saw the brunet at the school gate. With a relief, Steve noticed that Tony looked much better. He wasn't slouching and his face had a healthy color and there was some beginning of sparkle in his eyes, something Steve didn't see before. "What are you doing here?" he asked, trotting to the teen.
“You look beautiful,” Steve said in an honest voice, finding Tony even more breathtaking than before.
"I am taking those," Steve said, and before Tony could understand what Steve meant, he saw his boyfriend holding a pack of cigarettes.
“Thank you!” a hand snatched the box and the door closed again. Steve only blinked, noticing the pale arm and red nails belonging to Red Velvet, and not Tony’s tanned one.
Mint smiled gratefully at her sister, and Steve had to add that she was also the modest of the group. "Red is also an academic."
"We were just discussing our next meeting," Sarah explained to Steve, "some of my friends want to meet Tony and get beauty advice."
The introduction was late and happened in the wrong order, but it was enough to bring the carefree atmosphere back.
“Do what?” Steve asked innocently, planting himself more firmly and trapping his boyfriend, knowing he needed some extra support for what was about to happen. “This?” He asked, his thumb finding Tony’s outie belly button and gently rubbing over the sticking out bit of skin.
And Tony didn’t have to, because Steve knew the answer anyway, but he needed his own slice of comfort and he kept smiling beautifully as he watched Tony wriggle and laugh underneath him. And Tony, just like Steve, would deny his husband anything.
Tony would stay mad if it wasn’t for the soft and adoring way Steve was looking at him. Unfair. “Morning.”
"I am Tony and that is Steve," he said, motioning to his boyfriend, and Steve nodded, brightening when he saw Pietro's shirt with a green and red printing on.
When his breath calmed down, cautiously, Tony moved in closer and closer, until he put his face on the pillow next to Steve’s, their noses almost touching. Just how it was before Steve had decided to play on his sides.
"Tsk, where are your manners," Red Velvet reprimanded, "Steve, I present to you my daughter, Tootsie Roll. Tootsie, this is Steve."
"It is over, Steve," Tony panted out, rolling on his back and lying flat on the cool ground. "They got me. I am dead. You can go on without me."
"It will be fine, babe," Steve assured, walking closer and leaning down behind the brunet, pulling him into a comforting embrace.
"Good," Red replied with a smile, moving away, "because I am a little sore. It is not easy getting a full body wax."
"Thanks for coming with me, Buck," Steve smiled. He knew that Bucky didn't share his point of view, but was grateful for the company. If he was alone, it wouldn't go so smoothly. "Hey, you okay?" Steve asked, crouching down in front of the teen in the mud.
"Eh," Steve shrugged it off and yawned, closing his eyes back to sleep, thinking that he didn't marry Tony for being an organized person, and his husband did have some adorable quirky qualities that made him more lovable.
Breakfast could wait. Tony could call back. But their life as an engaged couple started right now and it was a moment Steve didn't want to share with anyone. Only him, Tony and Red Velvet.
Tiberius looked at Hammer and saw that the brunet teen still had him cornered. Hammer was no fighter. Tiberius was outnumbered. He looked at Tony, still in the mud. It wasn't worth it. He scrambled up and started running, Hammer soon following.
"THE HELL, STEVE!" Tony shrieked out, not able to cover himself or even stand up, not when Figaro was weighing him down.
"I already found something suitable, I don't know if I am good enough," Steve admitted, holding Red around her hips. It was a cryptic message and he didn't want to give more than necessary. At least not yet.
Steve stared at Tony in surprise. In their almost a month dating time, neither of them ever been to the other’s place. Steve already felt like barging into Tony’s space and wanted to slow things down a bit and get to know each other better before taking that step. Seemed that Tony had different plans for them. It was something comforting and intimate about it and made him feel all happy inside. Trusting his gut feeling, he decided to go with it.
"Babe? You awake?" Steve asked, peeking into the bedroom, still holding the bag with bread in his hands.
Wearing Steve's Captain America suit, swinging a toy replica of Steve's shield, was Peter. The suit hung on his smaller frame, but it wasn't enough of a hint and Peter still wrapped himself in it, doing an impression of Steve on the battlefield, poorly flailing the toy shield around in front of Ned and MJ, who was basically dying from laughter.
"Once you teach a man how to tuck, the whole shame is gone," he turned to Steve with a bright smile. Steve still didn't look placated, and Tony came closer to wrap hands around his neck in a tender gesture. "What is the next torture in your guys day out?"
"La la la la!" Steve sang, pressing hands to his ears and closing his eyes. When he opened them after a while, Red was looking at him with a smirk. Such a big guy and yet he acted like a baby.
All you. Steve swallowed thickly again. He reached for one of the pillows on the sofa and hugged it close to himself.
The bedroom was quiet, the lights were dimmed, and he saw his boyfriend curled under the covers, blankets pulled all the way up to his nose. He wasn’t sleeping, but his eyes were not fully opened either, just were slowly closing in as if he fought with his own tiredness until Tony could join him.
"No, not that -" Steve lifted himself to look better at his husband. Tony's gaze followed him and there was some surprise in his eyes, as Steve looked irritated. Irritated with himself. "You wanted to do something nice and I feel like I ruined it."
"He only wants to get to the box!" Steve snapped, knowing that it was how cat minds worked - you see a box, you climb in the box.
Steve laughed, wrapping his arm around Tony's waist and guiding him into the kitchen. "Jealous? Let’s go eat, you must be starving."
Of course, when Steve seemed to pay attention to him, he still was just thinking about Tony's stomach.
"Mah!" Steve protested through the puff pastry and whipped cream when he recognized the book his mom was holding, laying open into Tony's lap as both of them were cooing on the couch. The album with photos from his childhood.
If two days ago, Sam had screamed it out in his face in the middle of the Olive, Steve would slip under the table in sheer embarrassment. Instead, he remained in his seat, leaning casually to the back and sipping his Long Island Ice tea. Virgin. It wasn’t expected of him, but he wanted to support Tony in every way possible.
Steve almost had a heart attack out of joy. The moment was magical, but before he could truly embrace it, Red Velvet took out the mic from the stand and began walking on the stage.
Steve and Tony make another big step in their relationship and Steve starts to understand that Tony is the only one for him and plans the biggest step of all.
"Babe, remember that we are going for a dinner to my ma's tomorrow," Steve reminded, drying his hands. There was a pause and Tony's head dropped lower at the mention.
"Finally!" Steve breathed out, happily kicking off the pumps, his face saying pure relief. Tony slid his feet into the shoes and did a short test walk, before smiling wide.
"I shouldn't have any allergies. I remember having allergies, but it all stopped since I took the serum and - " Steve rambled, spiraling into something bad. If his allergies came back, who knew what would come next. And when. And that really scared him.
It was when Steve finally looked. It was like in slow motion for him. He saw Tony on the screen, his Tony, becoming a little red under the collar in the pressure and seeming overwhelmed, and a blushing Wanda. Not thinking much, and being carried solely on the moment, Steve took Tony's wrist and pulled him up to a standing position, pinning his lips against Tony's in a long kiss, not wasting any second.
And just like that it became loud and cheerful again, and Red was outvoted on if she would look good in an open leg dress, but she could definitely wear a body tight dress with a slit in the back going all the way down because her bubble butt was one of her greatest features.
Tony’s lips twitched into a little smile. “Alright, thanks. So, I guess I will see you around? I hope you will let me know before the interview will be posted, I’d like to take a look at it before printing.”
"Friday," Steve said in a firmer voice, hearing that 'nothing' from Tony too many times when it clearly was 'something'. Like father, like daughter.
There was a person who closely observed the whole situation. He kept looking at the group passing him, Stone with his nose stuck up high in the air, Hammer with his aura of thinking that he was above everyone else, and Aldrich trotting after them obediently. And then Tony. A medium height, dark-haired teen, curled and clearly frightened, but with some anger shining in his eyes, anger he couldn't afford to let take control over him. He didn't fit into this picture.
"I missed you so so much," Steve cooed, pressing his cheek into his boyfriend’s belly. "I prepared all delicious treats for you. Who knows what they were feeding you in that horrible hotel in France."
"I asked how's your head?" she repeated, red lips curling up as if she was expecting some coded answer Steve had no idea about.
“You know what?” Sam started, no hostility in his voice. “I will go talk to Tootsie, if you go talk to your girl.”
"Do you know what she is doing now? Do you? She kept showing those photos to everyone and going on and on how cute her drag daughter is. Do you have any idea what it does to my reputation?"
"Ewww," Tony laughed, his nose scrunching in disgust. That was one mental image he didn't need to picture. "What if you get hungry?"
Steve only smiled again, thinking that Tony's laugh lines were so fetching and that there was nothing wrong in making them a bit deeper.
"I am glad you're home!" Steve kept smiling sunnily and all kinds of emotions washed over Tony. Steve really missed him. And Tony did miss Steve too, but he had a reputation to uphold.
“Thanks, Loki,” Tony smiled, without makeup and out of drag, walking out of his changing room. Steve had been in the corridor, waiting for Tony to be done and stood up when the man approached him. Tony skipped a bit, as if trying to find back his balance after hours on high heels and looked tired, but happy. His shows always attracted a lot of people and he loved the attention.
Tony trotted to the door with an excited smile, and opened it, looking into the changing room. "Where are you going?"
“Mmmm, it’s when you can tell people’s sexual orientation. It is an intuitive thing, but we are mostly correct.”
“I am so glad everything is fine,” Tony sobbed out, drawing away and Steve cupped Tony’s face with both hands, brushing his tears away.
"Ladies and gentlemen," Loki's mellow voice announced through the speaker, "please welcome our first performer of the night, the sweetest cake in town, Miss Red Velvet."
The scent of tomato sauce and melted cheese distracted him. Cautiously, Tony made his way to the box, weary of Steve’s taste in pizza and not trusting it, being a firm believer that pineapple on a pizza was a federal crime, and flipped the lid open as if expecting pineapple to punch him in the face. None of that happened. Pepperoni slices, doused in a hot sauce squirted as a smile, looked at him invitingly.
“My parents died in the same year when I became of age and was able to legally drink. Not that it didn’t happen before but - back then, this is how my visits here looked. I bought flowers, candles, and the cheapest bottle of bourbon. I stayed here for hours, even after dark, not knowing what to do with myself because they were gone and I was all alone. One time, I went too far. Someone found me in the morning, barely conscious and delirious, clenching an empty bottle in my hand. I was admitted into the hospital and had my stomach pumped, was on a drip and stayed there for two weeks because I also got pneumonia from staying all night out on the cold ground. And when I was let out, I felt I had to change something. That I can’t live like that anymore.”
"It is alright," Tony smiled, sitting on a swing in a playground in the nearby park, Steve next to him as they both were swaying gently. "For a moment it was rough, but dad started to finally listen to me and I shared with him some of my ideas. I think we will be okay," he said, trying to not sound too proud.
"Good job," Steve praised, playing with the short hair at the back of Tony's head. He kissed his husband's temple, feeling his heart swell with love and just ecstatic from the shared moment and how well Tony listened. It was a true partnership, where they both cared about their needs and Steve just loved his husband more and more. "You can talk now, by the way," Steve said, remembering that he never called off the
"Hi, Mr. and Mr. Stark-Rogers!" MJ called, waving to them and just then Ned got out of shock and said his hello, still a bit intimidated by the superhero couple.
“I need to trim my beard,” she replied, putting on the trimming end of the electric shaver. “Then I cover what remains with a thin layer of latex and blend it all with makeup.”
"Bye," Red said with a soft smile, closing the door behind her boyfriend. She waited a bit at the door, in case if Steve would forget something, but he didn't come back. Before chaos could start again, Red turned to her sisters and daughter with a serious face and a burning question. "Okay, ladies, real talk time!" she called, clapping in her hands for attention and waited for all to focus on her. "What do you think of Steve?"
“No, please!” Tony giggled, kicking his legs, trying to wriggle away, as Steve’s menacingly moving fingers were getting closer and closer. “I cahahahan’t!”
"Hey, nice jacket!" Arrow passed him and praised with an approving smile, on the way to her changing room. Steve smiled gratefully, feeling a lot more confident with having a drag queen's approval, especially one as much fashion-oriented as Arrow. He reached his hand to knock on the door to Red's changing room, feeling his heart in his throat.
Looking enthusiastic, Tony got to writing. Soon, Steve got up and leaned over Tony’s shoulder, looking at the screen.
Tony scrunched his nose. "Not that I am not in the mood to get drunk and listen to grunge music, but I was hoping we can go home. I need a proper bath, I feel like I still have some mud in my ass crack."
“Um, yeah,” Steve nodded, walking after Tony into the crowded shop. It had a black sign above with the name of the shop in white, bold print and the shelves were in dark, almost black color, big signs above every cabinet indicating what products you could find. Steve guessed that the black interior was supposed to emphasize more the multicolored stock. In one hundred years, Steve wouldn’t guess that Tony would take him to a handmade cosmetic shop. That’s what he meant by restocking his supplies for the show. Makeup.
The third time Steve woke up was at 5:10 am, his usual wakening up hour. He was still alone in the bed and sat up, not feeling exactly rested, the last two wake ups leaving a toll on him, but it was time to start his day -
"Uhmmm..." Steve sent as insecure look towards his boyfriend and Tony didn't move, but his jaws tightening nervously. Just when everything seemed to be going so smoothly, they had to meet another bump on the road. "Uhm, kindaaa," Steve said, trying to dance around the topic.
"Glad you like it," Tony smiled, "I tried to give you a pedicure too, but you kept kicking me away whenever I touched your feet. As for someone who is such a heavy sleeper, you can get very squeamish when it comes to your feet."
"No, she likes Tony, the makeup artist," Tony sighed, "what if she won't like me as your boyfriend? What if she thinks that I am messed up in the head and corrupting her darling little boy and stopping him from living the picture-perfect life with a loving wife, five kids and a dog in the backyard?"
"Uh, yeah, you never forget the first guy who busted your lip," Bucky said, pointing at the left corner of his mouth, where he had a thin, pale scar. "He had the boniest fists."
Of course, they didn't stay in the bed forever but did have a lot more shared sweet moments both in bed and on the couch and wherever they found suitable.
Tony giggled, holding a cup with coffee in one hand, and blueberry pop tart in the other leisurely leaned against the bed frame. "Just temporarily. My girls are coming over and I think you will get bored."
"Don't laugh, tucking in is a serious business," Red reprimanded, narrowing her eyes. There was some knocking on the door, and she turned away from the mirror. "Come in!"
LONG TIME NO SEE, RIGHT? I admit, I got a bit lost with this series… also I wasn’t so sure if I liked the direction this story was heading, buuut then decided that this topic can’t be avoided and is a big part of every lgbt+ person’s life. also, I do enjoy a bit of drama. and there is no better month to be back with this series than pride month! hope you enjoyed this update! Bruce’s drag name was created by a dear friend of mine steve-sketchbooks.tumblr.com, thanks for your love for this story!
"What do you mean, dear?" Sarah asked, taking a sip of her tea. That drew Steve's attention to her hands which also changed, not calloused anymore after long hours from working, but smooth and soft, nails in neat, oval shape and coated with sheen nail polish. Just like Steve's were.
Steve took the tablet and unlocked it, searching for the Twitter app. Letter T on a blue background. Steve pressed it and skimmed over the screen, looking at the design of the app. Huh, it looked very different from the account owner’s point of view. He scrolled down the screen, seeing a lot of text, too much text because wasn’t there a limit of signs per tweet? Further, into the app, Steve saw more of things he didn’t recognize, didn’t see any posts from other Avengers, instead of images and gifs and -
“Here you go, boys,” she said, putting a fresh glass of Long Island Ice Tea in front of Steve and a mug of ale near Sam. Sam gagged a bit in panic, when in the white foam he saw a pink umbrella, standing tall and proud. At the reaction, Arrow smiled and walked away, not before winking at Steve.
Tony didn't move but saw Figaro zooming across the room, chasing the free scrunchie, happy with getting his toy back. Tony wasn't that happy.
Just to be sure, Steve glanced over at the bar, and saw Arrow behind it, skillfully mixing some cocktails. Next to her, was a new person, Steve had never seen before.
Tony groaned, almost sliding off the chair. “In my defense, you were not supposed to see this,” he said, sounding and looking embarrassed.
“Yeah,” Tony admitted, burying his heated face deeper into Steve’s neck. “Feels really good. Especially when you are the one ti - doing it.”
"Dirty whore," Stone commented and there was a disgusting laugh coming from two other seniors. "Time to put you back in your place. Killian! Hold his hands!"
"Who should I cheer for?" Tony asked, raising his voice to make it through the applauding crowd when two teams entered the field.
"We have our own plans! And the walls are pretty thin, so keep the gross stuff to the minimum!" Bucky added.
“Don’t let his appearance fool you, I saw Loki breaking a man’s arm. Snapped it like a twig,” Tony said in a light tone, treating the story as an anecdote. Somehow it sent a cold shiver down Steve’s spine.
“Um…” Steve started, feeling unsure. “You know that I don’t plan anything bad, don’t you?” he asked To— Red Velvet, and maybe it was naive, but he had to make sure.
Tony was sweating and so tired, and not in a good way. Steve was just snickering at him, which made him even more irritated. A stupid idea with a stupid guys day out. For starters, Steve had taken Tony out to a paintball park. So far, Tony was running where Steve pointed him to, walking on some hills and rolling in mud, in scorching sun while dressed in unflattering moro suit, all while carrying a paintball gun with himself. He wasn't having the best time.
There was something really, really comforting in wakening up in the arms of your beloved person. That was why Tony was so surprised when the good morning kiss he wanted to place on Steve’s cheek was met with a palm pressing to his face and keeping him away.
"It isn't important what we think, though," Arrow said, flipping a page in the magazine, "what is important is what you think. So?"
It was a moronic move on his part and he still couldn’t believe that he did that. Scratch that, he couldn’t believe that Red Velvet actually agreed to meet with him. He closed his eyes going back once more to that moment.
“All of them, babe,” Steve assured, smiling broadly. He had remembered some of the things he read and gifs he saw, and could easily imagine Tony on the receiving end.
“Hi, honey!” Sarah Rogers, Steve’s mom, smiled at her son. She had blond hair and blue eyes, something Steve had inherited from her and had a petite frame. Steve had to lean down when she walked over to kiss her son’s cheek as hello.
"We are. Thanks!" he smiled at the hot dog vendor taking a paper plate with four hot dogs on a big soda to share. He handed the hotdogs to Tony and took his hand, guiding him to their seats.
Really, increasingly difficult. He couldn’t distance himself from the topic that ran so close to his heart and affected directly one of the people he cared about the most. Steve was good and kind and didn’t deserve bad things happen to him for being himself.
"Hey," Steve said back, walking to the bed. He kneeled next to his boyfriend and put both hands on his cheeks. "Babe, I am sorry," Steve apologized, hating to see how much he wounded his lover.
Steve gently lowered Tony’s arms, feeling happiness growing in him when the other man allowed that and leaned down to kiss the tip of his nose. It was silly and sweet and Tony giggled, his eyes and nose crinkling at the simple affection.
Steve groaned and rubbed his forehead. In minutes, Red would be called to the stage and Steve would have to scurry to the audience, taking his seat next to Sam at their usual table. The timing was wrong, but he knew he wouldn't be able to enjoy the show, without getting it out from his system.
Taking a step back, Tony let Coulson walk in and set the pizza down on one of the work tables. So many questions and Tony couldn’t ask them. What was more, instead of leaving already, Coulson stopped at the table and looked at Tony, still smiling in a weird manner, looking oddly proud.
Tony rolled his eyes, not in the playful, dramatic way he used to sometimes, but as if he really considered Steve dense. “Dating? You know, two people meeting with each other? I know that gay people have an opinion of sleeping around, but I always was a fan of monogamy once I am in relationship with someone, so correct me if I am wrong, because maybe it is just one-sided and I would like to know if it is—” Tony’s blabbing was interrupted, when Steve pressed him close and quietened with a kiss. In the middle of the mall. With people passing by. Tony couldn’t help but blush.
Next to him, was standing a guy, looking back at him. Steve never saw him before. He looked casual and smart, in a fitted steel gray jacket and dark blue t-shirt underneath with a v-shaped neckline, pants matching the jacket and sneakers which gave the whole set a sporty look. He was tanned and had a dark goatee in a style Steve never saw before, and brown hair with a jagged top. But it wasn’t until the moment when the stranger took off his sunglasses, showing eyes in the warmest shade of brown, like melted chocolate. He might look different, but it was the shape of the eyes that made Steve sure.
No. Steve wouldn’t fall for it. And Tony felt so stupid for creating that account in the first place, but he needed a place to vent. He didn’t plan on socializing, sharing his life, just get the urges out and move on. He just… Wanted to feel accepted. Find people who thought the same as he did. Not feel so alone.
The outburst of happiness was overwhelming and certainly drawing out the harsh sound as if someone dropped a microphone down. Sarah pressed both hands to her face, hoping that it was all going in a direction she thought it was going, Sam stared and clapped almost mindlessly, while Rhodey blinked surprised, and Mint tried to get Tootsie's attention to ask what was going on, but Tootsie, together with Arrow, were absolutely going wild behind the bar, probably cheering the loudest.
"I actually do know that," Tony raised his eyebrows. "Scott and Logan are coming together to get their machines, and you know how those two get competitive over the smallest things, I don't want to trigger that in my workshop! Get to work, kids!" he ordered, and Riri rolled her eyes, but obediently took Tony's place underneath the car, while Harley kept working on the bike, focusing hard judging on the expression.
The dinner went surprisingly well. In the beginning, Tony was still tense, but Sarah went out of her way, to make him feel welcomed and accepted, and before the dessert, Tony got back his charisma and chatted with Steve's mom just as easily and comfortably as during their first meeting. And maybe that was the reason why, when Steve was asked to go to the kitchen and get the pastries, he lowered his guard down, and walked back into the living room, almost spitting out the cream puff he had managed to push into his mouth.
"Uhm," Steve cocked his head to the side, temporarily distracted by Tony's gently narrowed waist and bubble butt. He really didn't need much padding with such curves. "A bit?" he answered, smiling sheepishly, seeing at least five blooming purple marks on brunet's back.
Steve eagerly got up, wanting to know every step. He opened the closet and saw many dresses, many shoes and a few boxes with black hair inside. It would look creepy if Steve didn’t know that they were all wigs.
"Yeah. I think that there is like thirty minutes left before he shows up," Rhodey answered Tony with a mischievous grin as both men enjoyed the growing panic in the teenager.
Times have changed. Drag queen bars were becoming more popular and drag became a form of art. The line between what was female and what was male was getting blurry and both genders were overlapping and taking from each other. And Tony really hoped that all this was taken into consideration and Steve’s story would have a happy ending. Because if it didn't… It was all Tony’s fault.
“You know, Sam, you could just go and talk to her,” Steve advised gently, looking at his friend. “Under all that makeup, there is a regular person inside.”
“It was lovely seeing you both,” Sarah turned to Steve and Steve leaned down on automat, letting his mom kiss his cheek. Then she turned to Tony and granted him with the same motherly affection.
"Ready. Eat up," Sarah smiled, putting in front of Steve a plate with a huge scoop of mashed potatoes and a generous portion of beef tips, all smothered with dark and shiny sauce. Delicious, homemade food.
Steve watched Tony eat, almost greedily devouring the chopped fruits. Suddenly the images from the movies flooded his mind, the ones of bored husbands waiting in the changing room, as their wives tried on numerous dresses, presenting themselves to their partners, whose enthusiasms kept dropping with every new outfit, opposite to the women’s who took energy from trying on more clothes. He could picture himself doing that with Tony while being more enthusiastic, of course, and it was a tempting image, one that made his heart beat faster.
"P-pops!" Peter called, dropping the toy shield down as if he never was holding it. He looked for a blanket, a pillow, anything to cover himself up, and hide the suit, but it was pretty pointless.
"Also, not gonna lie, I am letting this one slide, because I want to be the one to bake your wedding cake," Sam added.
Dating Tony was great. Each day, Steve felt more and more in love with the quirky brunet, enjoying both the female and male sides of his boyfriend. It was exciting and refreshing and so different from the previous relationship Steve's had. Of course, it wasn't all sweet, and sometimes they had some disagreements, but always found a way back to each other, and it just made the bond between them stronger. Their dating time wasn't that long, but Steve already felt that Tony was the one for him and by the way Tony smiled at him, touched him, slept curled into him, he could feel that Tony thought the same about him. It was a good, mature and honest relationship. There wasn't a thing he would be afraid to tell Tony. He was an open book.
Steve gets the courage to ask Tony a very important question,  all in a style worthy of his drag queen! Sam takes a new step in his life, friends gather and someone special makes an appearance.
"I know, and I would love to," Steve replied, pulling his shoes on and smooching Velvet's forehead. "I just made plans earlier. Promised my mom to drop in for dinner, didn't see her in a while."
Steve counted in his mind and when the time came, he put his hand through the silver material and waved, only for a split of a second, hoping that the rest of the crowd focusing on Red Velvet, didn’t spot him
After that, they didn't say anything more and kept gently rocking on the swings. Steve knew that Tony's heart was broken and he needed time before he could invite anyone else in his world. Steve decided to be patient. Tony was worth the wait.
“Well, that was fun, but I have to skedaddle,” he said, reaching into his pocket. “I have a show tonight and need to get prepared.”
"Oh," Tony looked at the screen and Steve did too, seeing a face in full makeup, the photo signed Manilla. "Can I...?" Tony asked, smiling shyly and gesturing at his phone, abandoned in the covers.
"Thanks," Tony whimpered out, shaking the bottle for good measure and putting close to Peter's mouth hoping the boy would start to suck. Please suck. Peter's small lips found the bottle and locked on the teat. Some soothing, gulping sounds. Silence.
"Oh, please," Red waved her hand dismissively, "I just have some doctorates, but I still chose to spend my days fixing the world's most respected car brands," she said, trying to brush it off as it was nothing, but there was some smug note in her voice she didn't try to hide.
"Give me a heads up next time you do this, okay?" Steve seethed, making his way to the toilet and keeping away from the bathtub the best he could, as if afraid that a hand would pop out from the mass of hair and reach for him. It was a miracle he didn't wet himself, considering how full his bladder was.
Steve sighed deeply. It all was giving him a headache and it had to show. "Honestly, I want to propose to Tony and I am looking for a good ring, and it is exhausting."
"Huh?" Steve asked, wiping his mouth when the rest of the cupcake was gone. "What do you mean by that?"
"Don't make me wait for too long, mom gave us boxty dumplings and barmbrack, and you might not get any if you show up too late," Steve warned with a smile.
"You are welcomed to, if you want to," Tony shrugged, "just a fair warning, we will probably put you into a dress and makeup-"
"I am sorry for leaving you," Steve apologized again, kissing Tony's forehead and getting in bed, Tony making room for him, just to come closer when Steve lay down. Their legs tangled together and Tony put his head in the crook of Steve's neck, arms wrapped around each other, locking them in place.
"Oh," Red blinked in surprise. That was a sweet surprise. "Uh, then say hello to Sarah from me," she smiled, her voice sounding a little odd as if hiding something, but Steve didn't notice.
Sam, engrossed in a conversation with a pretty young girl behind the bar, turned around, blinking surprised when he saw Steve's mom. "Mrs. Rogers!" Sam called and waved back, turning to Tootsie to tell her a few words, before he took his beer and came closer. "Hello, Mrs. Rogers," he greeted her properly, leaning down so Sarah could smooch his cheek.
"I guess you will be switching schools now?" Steve asked sadly. He would understand if the traumatic events would make him want to leave, but Steve would still miss him.
"You know what I want to hear," Steve reminded in a cheerful voice, running his fingers over his boy's sides and belly, despite Peter squirming in his grasp.
After the performance, Red Velvet left the stage in a round of applause and Steve stood up, clapping for her too, causing her to smile. Usually, Red Velvet would step down the stage and mingle with the guests for a moment, but instead of doing that, they got back to her dressing room.
I think it was a bit risky to write this moment, but I tried to do it justice and respect the topic. hope you will like this chapter, if you do, remember to leave comments and kudos! happier moments will appear in the next chapter!
“You should,” Steve repeated, rolling on completely naked Tony and kissing his lips, “write on your,” a kiss on the chin, “Tumblr,” Steve finished, blowing a raspberry into Tony’s neck.
“I could be mean,” Steve threatened with a dangerous grin. He lowered his hand and put it under his head, staying on his side with no intention of moving. “I could have kept going until you ran out of breath, but I let you go,” Steve explained himself lightly.
There was some triumphant laughter, and Steve tried to locate the source, holding his gun high and ready.
"Did you give me a manicure while I was sleeping?" Steve asked, eyes glued to hands that didn't look anymore like the ones he remembered having.
Steve tightened his jaws out of frustration. There were plenty of rumors surrounding the seemingly hottest couple in high school. Both Stark and Stone were handsome, incredibly smart, and came from wealthy families. They seemed like a match made in heaven.
Cautiously, Steve scrolled down again, trying to keep an open mind and be more cautious. He wasn’t a prude, he knew that people had different kinks and it was completely normal. Heck, he and Tony had a very healthy sex and intimate life and the sight of Tony tied down for their playtime always made Steve’s blood boil with lust and desire and they did indulge in some kinks, Steve current favorite one included spanking Tony’s bouncy ass and watch it jiggle and the skin turn red. Tony had no problems with sharing his kinky fantasies and Steve was always willing to give it a go, sometimes proposing things on his own, like wax play, which wasn’t only sexy but also artistic - Tony’s body colored with drips of different colored wax was a beautiful sight. This… This was something different, Steve didn’t think to consider.
Tony and Rhodey kept talking about something, but Steve pretty much muted the whole conversation out. It felt like he walked into an entirely different world.
When Steve pressed his finger over Tony’s outie delicately and Tony burst into giggling, almost maniacal laughter, Steve was in heaven. It was settled, Tony was keeping his blog for further tips for Steve.
Steve chuckled softly, looking at his husband's calm and smiling face. Tony had this almost magical ability to fix things for Steve. After all, his husband was a mechanic, building and fixing was his thing and it went further than machines.
Except for the terrible morning, Tony had a pretty good day. He aced another assignment, no surprise here, managed to eat lunch in peace with Tiberius, and his henchmen disappearing somewhere. He just needed to get home safely. When the last bell rang, Tony hurriedly left the class, hoping that it was a good sign that Tiberius wasn't present during lunch break and maybe he could have some peaceful afternoon.
"Snickering at me," Steve complained, trying not to sound too pathetic. Judging by the giggle behind him, he obviously failed.
“Can I get you, boys, anything else?” Arrow asked, gently taking the empty glass from Steve’s clutches and on putting it on the tray she was caring, a single strand of red hair slipping out of the green hood. Arrow’s thing was fantasy looks. She rocked it in green cape going down to her nicely shaped butt, and a belt with big buckle was hugging her waist, bringing out the feminine shape of the body clad in a green leather suit.
"Then it will be more things and I will love you just as much I love you now," Tony assured, bringing Steve's hand closer and kissing his knuckles. That made Steve smile. "You still love me too, even if I changed, right?" Tony asked, meaning the flow of time and what it was doing to him. His hair became a bit more grey, eyes were set deeper and more often there was some sort of pain in his bones, one he didn't remember having. It was all part of life and couldn't exactly be stopped.
There was applause and Steve smiled and clapped with everyone as Red Velvet walked onto the stage, waving to the audience and stopping her eyes on Steve for a second, her smile a bit wider and more beautiful just for him before it dimmed down into something subtler and charming. Steve sat in the audience, listening to a song that seemed less melancholic in comparison to the ones he already knew, and took in every moment, not letting Red Velvet out of his sight. She was radiant and confident and Steve felt his heart growing just from looking at her, knowing her back story and how she came to life. And Steve knew that once the makeup and dress would be off, he would continue to feel the same while looking at Tony, at his Tony who had his share of suffering and created something beautiful and Steve felt privileged to be a part of his story. And how amazing was that?
"Good luck with that," Tony grinned wider, moving slow and sensual, the subtle twist of his waist and hips making Steve's brain short circuit. They could easily move to round two from here, Steve already stiffening from the wonderful feeling Tony's skilled moves invoked, but Steve could be difficult too when he wanted to.
"It is my wig," Tony laughed, reaching his hand into the bathtub, taking out the long, wet hair. It was the knee-length wig, the one with perfectly straight, silky smooth hair, Steve found incredibly sexy on Red Velvet, but he might reconsider that statement after today. The black strands were hanging down miserably, dripping with water and it was like something pulled out of a horror movie. The view sent a shiver down Steve's spine, and Tony didn't seem bothered, used to it. "I am washing them," Tony explained simply, pointing Steve's attention to more plastic containers stacked on the washing machine, full of black hair of different texture.
It was a day when Steve spent in a cosmetic shop more time than he would like to admit to, but he didn’t notice the time fly, as the whole time he was trying to think what he would tell his mom in the end. What was his relationship with Tony? Calling him his friend seemed too little, and boyfriend was a bold word. Lover was sweet, but could also indicate other things and cause confusion. He didn’t know.
"Not in a sense you think," Red smiled, obviously enjoying seeing Steve's shocked face in the mirror. "I meant my drag daughter. Tootsie Roll."
“Why not shave it off completely?” Steve asked, and the way Red Velvet turned around and glared at him, was equally scary and amusing.
Those posts were Tony’s. That account was Tony’s. Tony had two Twitter accounts? Steve looked back, just now noticing that it wasn’t Twitter after all. At the top of the screen on a background of dark blue in white letters was written Tumblr. Steve didn’t hear of the app, it wasn’t listed as one of the most popular ones for celebrities and that’s probably why Tony used it for -
“Sure,” Steve agreed, walking back to the closet. Unfortunately for his sanity, the first hanger on the left was the one nearest the breastplate. “Ummm… Will you need this too?” he asked, trying not to look.
Definitely knew the author. At the top of the post, he saw a name, probably the username and clicked on it. Blue background color, and image of feathers and the username in white bold font. The Spare Parts Man.
That was a good question and meant so much more than Tony initially intended to. Steve felt more and more ready. There was no other person for him than Tony. No other tiny bathrobe he would be seeing for the rest of his life.
"Oh, and this was from one of the scariest days in my life!" Sarah said, pointing at one photo. Tony's eyes immediately followed there and widened when he recognized who was in the photo if he wasn't mistaken. "Steve, you remember this, right?"
“Am I gay?” Red Velvet asked, walking behind a four-panel room divider, for a change, in black color. Steve’s face burnt a little at the forward question, he asked for in the first place.
so, after over a month, here is part two. still a work in progress, but for sure there will be more chapters and I hope to keep it updated monthly. comments and kudos are welcomed and needed! ps. a cookie for a person who will guess who Tony's drag mom is :D
"Yeah, that!" Tony snapped his fingers, and Harley groaned, well knowing what his bosses were doing, but still falling for it. And it still brought so much joy for Tony and Rhodey. "Okay, I still need someone to work on Scott's car… RIRI! Mazda is yours!"
Steve laughed in relief. He liked this side of Tony. He was feeling they were getting somewhere when Tony looked at the clock and clicked his tongue.
Red Velvet opened her eyes and reached her hand forward. Steve wanted to take it, to hold it, to kiss it. To be there for her at every moment.
"Came to see you," Tony smiled and Steve's heart almost melted. He never before saw Tony smiling and it was some gorgeous smile. "Walk with me?" Tony asked, pointing a direction with his head. They couldn't stay near school as other kids were already recognizing him and the whispering started. Steve followed.
“Orange?” Steve asked in humor, not imagining that Tony would ever choose an orange car. Black. Red. Some dark color. But orange? “You really like to attract attention,” he chuckled.
“So, what does your gay radar say about me?” Steve asked, trying to focus on something else, then bare, tempting skin.
"Come on, Pete! If you knock Steve down, I will triple your allowance!" Tony called with a huge grin, Ned and MJ cheering for Peter to do it.
“Sounds great,” Steve said, liking the fond tone of voice Tony was using. It had to be great memories.
"HIHIHIHI!" Tony was laughing his heart out, the examination driving him crazy. Steve even went as far as to lift his shirt and kiss and nibble over his stomach, luckily for Tony's ticklish skin, just very briefly, only to give some extra attention to his favorite belly.
Tony laughed, and Steve decided to not interfere, even if the bonding time was happening at his expanse. Instead of taking part in the conversation, he got a plate and piled some cream puffs on it, digging in. Sarah eagerly explained every photo and Tony was taking it all in, smiling and nodding and asking questions. At that moment, Steve started to wonder if Tony had any photos from his childhood because Steve would love to see them one day.
With a growl, Steve sunk into the couch, looking pleadingly at the ceiling, as if asking for someone to end this all.
"Okay," Tony said after a while, his voice trembling with emotions, and the whole happiness Steve had experienced was gone, when he noticed that tears were building up in his boyfriend's eyes. "Thank you," Tony sniffled, overwhelmed with the amount of love he was receiving from practically a strange woman, while he never got even a fraction of that kind of support from his parents. Things would happen differently in his life if he would grow up with a parent similar to Sarah.
“He will have the most vibrant and pink cocktail you have on the menu,” Steve changed Sam’s order, smiling gleefully at Arrow, who laughed in a voice deeper than she used to talk earlier.
"Uh, what are you doing here, man?" Red finally asked, sounding a lot more like Tony, than Red Velvet. Bianca del Rio was a busy woman, traveling and performing all around the globe since she won that show which name slipped Tony's mind.
“You don’t really have to, with your porcelain skin and beautiful cheekbones!” Tony praised enthusiastically and Sarah laughed. Steve looked at Tony in panic. What the heck was happening. “But if you would like to try a little bit of makeup, I will be happy to help. I have some time, and I could assist you. Think of me as your personal makeup artist.”
“I thought you wanted to sleep. Why are you not going to sleep?” Steve asked in a teasing voice, glancing at his boyfriend and replacing his mouth with hands, softly brushing over the warm skin.
"Bring it on, sugar," she said enticingly. Steve smiled wider and leaned down while Red put her hands on his cheeks, bringing their lips into a kiss, probably the last one before she would take the makeup off after her show. The deal was sealed. "Now, get out, I need to get ready," she said, when the kiss ended, turning back to the mirror.
"Tony... You look beautiful," Steve said in a love filled voice, adding a third finger, and Tony's eyes snapped open when the build up was reaching its climax. It was incredible how he could feel every stroke, not distracted by his own voice, and how focused and thorough Steve was, finding every sensitive spot. Just staying quiet was becoming more and more difficult as the heat in his body was increasing, pooling in the pit of his stomach, and when Steve's fingers pressed on his sweet spot and held, Tony's body started to shiver and there was this wonderful rush in his head, causing his limbs to go all stiff and hips snap forward when he came for the second time. Different, quieter, but so deep he could feel it in every nerve ending on his body.
“HIHIHIHI!” Tony erupted into high pitched laughter, legs kicking helplessly as Steve’s lips rediscovered every inch of ticklish, soft skin. It wasn’t fair how much it tickled and how good it felt at the same time. “Nohohoho, stahahap!”
“Actually, it was a bet,” Tony explained, getting in and motioning for Steve to do the same. Once they settled in, he continued. “My friend, Rhodey, once told me that no one looks good in orange. So, I bought an orange car to prove him wrong,” he ended the story on a lighthearted note, and Steve had to think for a while what was Tony’s day job that he could afford a new car, just to win a bet. “Seat belts,” Tony reminded, waiting for Steve to fasten his seat belts.
"You're gonna be so smooth after this," Tony hummed enticingly, still rubbing the stripe making sure it would catch as much hair as possible. "I won't be able to get my hands off of you," he said, leaning his warm weight over Steve's, the cool satin feeling pleasantly slippery and soothing on his skin.
“Well, maybe somebody should be,” Steve shot back, meeting Tony without hesitation. “God, Tony, you always do this. You run blindly into these things you don’t know, don’t fully understand, and then you get hurt. Sometimes even at the expense of other people.” He rubbed at his face, other hand now on his hip, frustrated. “At least Howard took the time to listen to what other people told him before he acted.”
“Stop,” Tony heard himself say out loud, an outstretched hand reaching for them, grasping for some control over the situation. “Stop it,” he said even louder, this time moving to drop down the concrete curve. God, he wanted to run over and shake himself. Couldn’t he see what he was doing? He was going to destroy everything. He was so close to ruining one of the only good things in his life-- “Stop!”
“I’m not jealous,” was all Steve could get out before tearing his arm away and leaving the room. Tony said something as he did so, but he didn’t stop to listen. He was too busy quieting the pounding in his chest, and the roaring in his ears.
“You think I’m not fit to lead?” Steve felt a low, simmering anger building in him at the words. He’d always put the team above everything else. Always. “Because of these feelings you think I’m having?”
“Let me know if you ever find out,” Tony replied while nipping at Steve’s chest. “Now stop talking. I’m exhausted, and I’m sure there will be at least ten phone calls from Pepper alone in the morning.”
As if agreeing, Steve yawned, and turned more onto his side, cradling Tony to him. “Okay. See you in the morning?”
Steve did so wordlessly, hands a steadying presence on Tony’s shoulder and forearm, grip almost too tight. But then he let go, took a step back, away, and Tony found himself latching back on, grip desperate.
God, what was happening? It felt like the world was bending beneath him, moments of his life flashing before him, scenery morphing from one place into the next. He was battling Bruce in Johannesburg. Recruiting Peter for Germany. Throwing a party in the tower, Steve smiling soft and easy as Tony teased him over his glass. The sounds of it all were growing louder, the fighting and screams rapidly overwhelming everything else.
“Goddammit,” Tony cursed quietly, but with the beginnings of a smile. “You know, I meant it when I said I wasn’t ignoring you. It was just, every time I saw you all I could think about was what I’d seen, and I thought...I was afraid that you’d--”
“I’m in fucking space,” he breathed, incredulous, and slowly sank down to the floor, knees pulled up as he pressed his head into his hands. “Fucking space.” This wasn’t real, couldn’t be real. He’d never actually been to space before. Not unless those few moments in New York counted.
His next breath came out like a puff of smoke, and a sharp chill rushed over him. He felt wind picking up, and turned around in time to see snow falling quietly around him. The compound was gone, likely thousands of miles from where he was, and in its place was a door, large and obvious against the rocky, snow covered tundra. He only hesitated a moment before going inside.
He stumbled stupidly upon entry, half twisting in an attempt to close the door behind him as he went, but instead of being shoved into a wall or rack of hangers, he was in the middle of the kitchen of the Avengers Compound. He turned around once, and then again, before he realized there was no closet in sight. No door he’d come in through. Running a hand through his hair, he moved around the island bar slowly, listening for footsteps or voices. But none came, and only then did he notice the sun was already setting.
“No. No, there’s nothing.” Tony briefly pictured Pepper on the other side of the wall, expression sour. “Well, I mean there is something, there’s always something, but--”
Tony’s eyes flickered across Steve’s, and as the moments passed, a wetness seemed to come over them, and he used his free hand to wipe at them quickly, shaking his head.
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been gone, but he did know he felt better now, calmer. Until he saw Steve again.
Tony hadn’t felt the initial sting of his hand when it made contact with Steve’s face. When he did, it was already hanging between the two of them, suspended in disbelief as the two of them stared at each other, eyes widening.
Tony pulled out the phone, looking at the ID. “Sorry, that’s Pepper. We’ve got a lunch date, which.....” He checked his watch, frowning. “I am now fifteen minutes late for. Shit.”
The voice was loud inside Tony’s head, and he thought he saw bright orange sparks before feeling like the floor had been yanked out from under him. It felt like he’d been falling, but he never landed. Instead he awoke inside his lab with Strange kneeling over him, concerned.
“I’m going to need you to give me something here, Rogers,” he said after a moment, a slight nervous tilt to his words that made all the tension in Steve’s shoulders fall away.
“What about the Hulkbuster armor?” Steve interrupted eventually, catching Bruce off guard as he was explaining the new wings they were planning to give Sam. Apparently that was what Sam had been testing when Tony had picked him up a few weeks back.
Steve peeked out from under his hand, and Tony looked up, meeting his gaze with a wink. “You know I can’t say no to you, right?”
Steve smiled as he dismounted, taking slow easy strides to Tony. He hesitated at the bottom of the porch stairs before looking back at his bike. “It’s easier to maneuver. Makes for a faster getaway. Natasha recommended it.”
Steve didn’t hesitate. “You try so hard to let the world know that you and Howard aren’t the same, but I knew him and I know you. Just like I know how desperately you want to be able to go off and play goddamn house with Pepper just to prove you can be a better father than him. Just to prove that you can raise a kid without it turning out like you.”
Steve stood to help as well, but Natasha stopped him with a firm grip around his forearm, holding tight.
Natasha eyed him, leaning against the table. “I’m talking about you giving Sam hell today for no reason.”
“So you really keep in touch with everyone on the team?” Steve asked, both impressed yet hurt by the fact that Tony had never even attempted to reach out to him. But he supposed the man had just explained why that had happened, but it still didn’t mean it sat anything but heavy in his chest.
“No, wait.” Tony quickly pressed his hands into Steve’s shirt, reeling him back in. Again. “I didn’t mean it like that. Just, I’m not going anywhere. No rush.”
Steve let himself smile, appreciating the reassurance. “Thanks, Tasha. I know.  It’s just--” He stopped, gaze focusing over her shoulder, causing Natasha to turn and follow it. “Tony?”
“Sorry,” he said, finally finding his breath and inhaling. Exhaling slowly. “It’s nothing. I’m fine. We’re fine. See?” He wrapped his hands around Steve’s neck, and tried a smile.
The admission pleased Tony more than it should have. “Which is why I am willing to exploit that fact to the fullest.” He pushed up on his hands, moving up to kiss Steve, slow and open mouthed. Teasing.
Later, after Steve had fucked Tony into the mattress more than once and turned him into a writhing, whining mess that the tabloids of his past would have had a field day with, those three little words seemed to creep over them once again, soft and sweet.
But in that small moment, Steve had run at him, shield held high as he aimed it at the suit. Iron Man raised both hands instinctively and let lose a too loud blast. It had been practically pointblank, gauntlets closely pressed against Steve’s chest before firing, and it had sent him flying across the room. He crashed into the far wall with a sickening crack, before he slumped to the floor. Tony could see the front of his uniform burnt black, singed and bloodied skin underneath.
“No, you really don’t.” Steve gave a huff of a laugh, something edging on manic, lost. “God, you have no idea.  I had thought that maybe by not telling you certain things I was helping you. I thought maybe I could protect you, help focus you on all the good in your life. But really all I was doing was hurting you even more. I thought…I thought I could be this wall between you and the rest of the world, but I realized you didn’t need that. You don’t need me. You’ve been doing fine all these years without me. God, how much strength and perseverance and determination it must have taken to get you where you are today, and you did all of it without me in your life. You said that you’re no good without me, yet that’s the farthest thing from the truth. You’re so amazing, Tony, and I’m just sorry I couldn’t see it before now. I wish I could have. Maybe things would have been different if I did.”
When he’d poked the stone with a piece of scrap metal left in his pocket, he hadn’t expected the thing to glow so fucking bright, his head pounding like his brain was banging around freely in the Iron Man suit. He also hadn’t expected to end up on the streets of New York, vacant except for the Chitauri running rampant while the Avengers scurried after them.
“How about I just build you a time machine instead, and you can fuck off to the forties where you and dad were such good friends,” Tony asked, chest tightening. “That way you can play soldier and argue over who gets to ‘fondue’ Peggy all you want.”
The pause that followed was only a little concerning. “He’s a bit..indisposed at the moment.“ Okay, maybe more than a little. “I just wanted to see if it actually worked.”
Someone cleared their throat, and Tony looked to Natasha now at his side. “Hate to break up the moment, but Bruce really needs to get you checked out. After that, you’re gonna need to rest.”
Steve looked up from his holopad. He was sitting in one of the meeting rooms, going over the afternoon’s mission. There’d been an explosion in an apartment complex, and the fire was growing too fast for local firefighters to maintain. The team had been called in personally to secure both the building and the people inside.
“One sec.” Tony pulled it from his pocket, smiling after a moment. He looked up at Steve, apologetic. “Sorry. Pep. Guess I missed another lunch date.”
“You mean your grandmother?” Steve corrected, and Tony thought his voice sounded just a little bit softer, more relaxed.
“Hello?”  He answered as casually as he could, evening his breaths so it wasn’t obvious how quickly he’d jumped to pull the thing out of his pocket. He held up a finger to a confused Pepper, mouthing “sorry” before leaving the room.
Tony didn’t know what he’d been expecting when he and Steve went back inside, but it definitely wasn’t to have Steve crowd him up against the nearest wall and kiss him, hard and desperate.
Panic overwhelmed him, and he closed his eyes again. But all he could see was Steve, bloodied and still. Himself broken and lost inside the compound. God, he wanted to go home. He wanted to go back to New York, or to the tower. He so desperately wanted to be anywhere but where he was.
“Blame you,” Steve finished for him, sighing. Had he really caused Tony to think so little of him? “Tony, the only reason I get mad at you for these things is because I care about you. You understand that, right?”
“You told me I could have saved you,” Tony admitted finally, the words sounding as if they had to have been torn from his throat, raspy and raw. “And I just, I didn’t know what to do. I was so scared, and then it all just disappeared. And then Ultron happened, and I realized you were right. I could have saved you, all of you, but instead I just keep...”
“Right,” Steve said after a moment, removing himself from the bed. He stood, straightening out his shirt, and Tony followed, running a hand through his rustled hair. The two looked at each other, grinning again before heading to the door.
Steve only looked at the shield, hands remaining firmly at his side. He suddenly looked very tired. “Tony, I--” He met Tony’s gaze. Tried again. “Thank you. I mean it.” Tony only jumped a little when Steve stepped forward to take it, running one of his own hands over the edge before smiling, appreciative. “I don’t really know what to say.”
“Wait, you’re leaving?” Tony was more than a little bewildered. Whiplashed might be a better word for it. “Why?”
“Your team is much more observant than you think,” Tony explained, moving that much closer. Steve didn’t try to move away. “Technically, it was Sam’s idea, but....”
Steve’s expression flipped instantly to barely contained annoyance.  A familiar face, at least. “Look, I didn’t come here to fight.”
Tony’s own expression never change, silencing the phone before pocketing it. “Friends can still eat lunch together, Rogers. Wild concept, I know. Anyway, I got to run. Let me know when visiting hours are, yeah?”
It’s not like he didn’t know it worked, but he’d just never expected the damn thing to actually, well, work. On his end at least. Some part of him knew he would break one day, give in to that urge and just fucking call.
Tony stared at Steve long and hard, trying his hardest to work out what was going on in that thick, super soldier skull of his. “Okay, so I’m just going to go ahead and apologize if I hadn’t made it abundantly clear when I kissed you outside--and then allowed you to kiss me again inside--but I’m kind of in love with you? More than kind of. A lot, actually. So, yeah, I’d really, really appreciate it if you stayed. With me. Here. Together?”
“That’s the one. So what do you say? Up for a trip to the lake?” Tony could only wait a short moment before trying again. “Steve?”
He’d hated himself then for being so weak, for allowing himself to crumble so easily onto the floor of a man who thought so little of him. Allowed himself to drink until he couldn’t feel the bruises or see the desperate anger in those bright, blue eyes.
“Just like that,” Tony repeated, shoving his hands in his pockets. He took a few steps forward, hating how close Steve was to the door now. How close he was to leaving again. “Listen, I’ve been talking to Ross. The UN realizes the Avengers are only an asset when we’re a working unit. Cohesive. Right now, we’re just one half of a whole. I’m even working on getting Barnes cleared, and that’s become a hell of a lot easier with Zemo in custody, so I just thought....”
“Screw the compound,” Tony said almost too quickly, fingers aching from how tightly he was holding the phone now. “I mean, I get it. Not very inconspicuous, it? But what about somewhere else? The tower?”
. But once the surprise passed, Steve realized how utterly and true that was to the Tony he knew. The Tony right next to him, enjoying his jealousy, kissing him.
Tony couldn’t stop himself as he pulled Steve close enough to lean into, wasn’t content until he could feel the other against him, warm and alive and breathing.
The sun was low in the sky when he finally opened the door, Steve having just pulled up alongside his own car. He’d shown up on a motorcycle of all things, and Tony had to give him some style points for it. It was a sleek, black thing with enough old school modifications to make it feel less Tokyo Drift and more Captain America.
“I’m guessing you don’t come here too often,” Steve quipped as he entered the house, eyes roaming. The furniture was a bit dated, sure, and the weight of stale air was ever present, but for a place last used maybe thirty years ago it wasn’t awful.
“Well,” Tony said, looking down at his hand still curled around Steve’s wrist, held in place by Steve’s other hand. “Obviously not, but, well, I guess now I do, huh?”
Tony felt his newly formed walls crumble all over again. “Christ.” He rubbed a hand over his face before walking forward to push the shield aside. “No, I’m not. But neither are you.”
He’d never brought it up after that, and neither had Steve. The team too concerned with murderous robots and Clint’s secret family. As always, everything else had just gotten in the way.
Tony followed the path as far as he could before it seemed to disappear in the darkness. The lake was silent now, moving quietly in the glow of the now rising moon. Tony took a few steps toward it, toeing the edge. He crouched down, reaching a hand into the shallowest part to brush at stones and wet earth.
Tony pulled back what felt like too soon to Steve, and he only stared as Tony searched his face, looking for something.
“What are you doing here?” Steve had to ask, even when he knew it came out more like an accusation than a genuine question.
Tony stopped speaking, eyes closed, as if reliving the moment. Steve reached out a hand, placing it over the man’s arm. Tony opened his eyes at the touch, and turned, meeting Steve’s gaze.
“Oh, cause good ol’ dad was so good at listening,” Tony mused, unable to stop the unabashed eye roll that statement conjured. “Really a staple of my childhood. How could I forget?”
“That’s not what I--” Steve started, realizing he’d been too defensive himself. But he was cut off by the sound of Tony’s phone ringing, some song from a show or movie Steve had probably never gotten around to watching even though half the team assured him it was worth it.
The slam of a screen door brought him back to the window. Tony watched as Steve got a few steps from the porch before hesitating. He turned around, looking back at the Barton home, and while Tony couldn’t see his face he thought the man looked…sad? He didn’t remember Steve leaving back then, having been sucked in by Clint and his secret wife and kids and the fucking domesticity of it all hidden right under their noses.
“I did. But I still own it.” Pepper had been quick to advise him not to do anything rash, like sell the entire tower out of grief. “But I get if that might be too gloomy for you? I mean, we all did live there, however briefly. But there’s plenty of other Stark properties to choose from.” Tony racked his mind, thinking of what he knew was nearby, away from prying eyes. “What about a lake house? There’s one not far from the compound, an heirloom of my mother’s mother.”
When Steve did pull away, he kept a strong arm wrapped around Tony. The other reached up to cradle Tony’s hand that still ran through his hair. He pressed it gently against his own cheek, eyes closed. The warmth of Steve’s skin seeped into Tony’s cold hand.
Steve followed his gaze, realizing what he was looking at, and quickly lifted his top hand. “Sorry.”
Steve could only blink at the words, practically frozen as Tony’s hand moved along his neck to cup right under his face. They stared at each other a moment, Steve’s brain finally catching up to the moment, and, as if on cue, Tony asked, “Is it okay if I...”
But, god, having Steve under him, laid bare and exposed, those thoughts quickly became the last thing on his mind.
Natasha scoffed, one hand on the kitchen counter. “I’m talking about you making Bruce out to be the bad guy. Turning against Sam. I’d hate to see what you’d say to Pepper if she ever showed her face around here.”
Tony bounced as he landed, bedsprings creaking, and he swore he could see dust mingling in the air around him. His breath left him when he looked up at Steve, but in a good way. He was looming over Tony with that fierce look in his eyes, that intensity that screamed familiar, dangerous....
Tony practically melted into the touch, free hand pressing against Steve’s chest and gripping the fabric tight, definitely wrinkling it. He eventually allowed Steve to do as he please, taking a back seat as Steve nipped at his lips, exploring slowly as he essentially poured all the things he’d been feeling the last few months into this thing between them. Admitting just how right everyone had been. That he had been jealous, practically boiling over with it, and it wasn’t until Tony had let him have him that he’d realized how possessive of the man he was. He wanted anything and everything he had to give, and hated the idea of sharing it with anyone else to an overwhelming point.
The quinjet was parked on a large front lawn, and he was just able to catch the last of the Avengers entering the Barton farmhouse.
Tony felt a thrill at the implication and settled in for however long they had left before morning. “Night, Cap,” he affirmed, tasting the nickname on his tongue like it was the first; like it suddenly felt new and oh so right. “Make sure you dream of me.”
“Monopolize my time?” Tony interrupted, leaning even closer to Steve, one hand reaching out to rest along his arm, gentle. “Have my complete and undivided attention? Because I’ll let you in on a secret: you have it. You always do.”
Steve’s expression grew increasingly pained, and his voice was now low, almost hesitant. “Because I know you don’t mean it. I know it’s not what you want, not really. It’s just what you think you should do, and I could never let you do that. I can’t let you sacrifice yourself just to spare me my feelings.”
“I can’t say for sure. The Time Stone is complicated at best when it isn’t damaged, so I can’t know for sure where it took him or for how long.” He paused a moment, as if hesitant to continue. “I found him in the future. A future, if you will. Not necessarily ours, but an option nonetheless.”
“Shit.” Tony pulled his hand from the water, face tilted toward the sky. His expression was grim yet resolved. “I am so fucked.”
“Right,” Natasha said, tone implying that Steve was one to talk about impulsivity. “And I’m sure this has nothing to do with the fact that you saw Tony dropping him off this morning?”
“Hmm,” Tony hummed, thumb running against Steve’s skin. Steve jumped, and Tony lifted his hands slowly as Steve pulled his own back.
The sun was quickly setting when Tony left, the last stretches of light throwing shadows as he walked. The path around the lake was clear enough to see, however, so he followed it. His pace was quick, and he felt like every part of him was coiled up into this tight mass of rage. But just beneath that rage was the aching hurt he still felt at Steve’s words.
“Then don’t go,” Tony breathed, hands pulling Steve down so his mouth ghosted over his before kissing him gentle and slow.
Steve wasn’t amused by the dazzling smile Tony gave him then. His expression mirrored something closer to slow creeping dread. “Wait, were you....Please don’t tell me you were planning this from the beginning?”
“Wait, Steve,” Tony gasped, pulling away long enough to get a word in while Steve’s hands ghosted over his sides.
Tony opened his mouth to speak, but he couldn’t make any words come out. He sucked in a sharp breath, felt himself on the verge of hyperventilating, and realized he was crying.
Natasha searched Steve’s face a moment, before closing her eyes with a nod. “Right. Well, like the man said, you’re sweaty, and so am I. Hit the showers. Pizza for lunch?”
Natasha maneuvered him easily through the lab, making sure he didn’t fall even as he turned one final glance over his shoulder.
Tony smiled, hand fidgeting with the cap on the island. “Yeah. Guess I’d have noticed if you were making trips to his place, considering.”
Steve wanted to laugh. “And tell him what? ‘Hey, Tony, I know you’re busy and all, but is there any way you could stop all that and just sit down with me for five minutes to talk?’ That just sounds so....”
It was Steve’s turn to be surprised, but after a moment, he took it in stride, meeting Tony’s advances with his own. It was a bit awkward at first, but eventually they found a rhythm, and Steve couldn’t stop himself from pushing closer to Tony, wanting more, hand moving from his thigh to up and over his hip, gripping as he maneuvered the man to a better angle. His other hand found its way to the side of Tony’s face before moving back into his hair, gripping tight.
Steve responded only by lifting his own hips, meeting Tony’s ass with force as he thrust upwards. His hands splayed over Tony’s hips, edging on painful. “Tony...”
Tony felt his calm fall away, tensing at the accusation. “What? No, of course not. I mean, not exactly. A small part of me might have hoped? But I never assumed that it would actually happen--”
Tony wasn’t a fan of where this conversation was going. “Steve, look, it’s in the past, okay? I get it.”
Tony hesitated a moment, hands slipping into the pockets of his jacket. “Oh, you know, just checking in on Rhodes. I also wanted to ask him a favor. Although, at this point, I think I owe him more than he owes me.”
“Because it won’t,” Steve said, holding Tony’s gaze as he spoke and making sure each word made its way to him. “Because I know you won’t let it. Because you care so much, and we all know that. We’re a team, Tony, and that means we’re all in this together, whatever happens. You can’t put all of that on your shoulders, alone. That’s why I get so angry at you sometimes. Because you try to take on these burdens alone. And that’s not what I want. That’s not what any of us want. Okay?”
“Tony c’mon,” he protested grabbing what he thought were his own sweatpants from the end of the bed. “Uh Tony?”
“Oh fuck,” he moaned reaching down to tangle his fingers in soft brown hair. Tony steadied himself before sinking down over his cock until his nose was brushing his stomach.
“You won’t hurt me Steve,” Tony sat up and arched backwards with an incredible flexibility and kissed him passionately. “I meant it when I said I trust you.”
“For creating Ultron and getting the team into this mess and not to mention I’m kinda an ass and You’re right I’m self deprecating because you guys are just more responsible and smart and sensible and you aren't the ones making these mist -” Steve surged forward to kiss Tony quiet.
“Do you want to fuck me? Or I can suck you off, or give you a handjob, or we can just lay here together. Just show or tell Capsicle, I want whatever you give me,” Tony insinuated running his hand down his side.
“Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question,” Steve angrily slammed his axe down again.
“Damn all ready for me,” Tony grinned leaning into another kiss. His tongue was snaking into Steve’s mouth while his hands wandered over his shoulders. He tugged at Tony’s pants until he pulled them off and threw them to the floor. Tony broke their kiss momentarily and reached for the nightstand before shoving the vaseline into his hand.
“Shit Tony… I’m gonna cum,” he moaned letting go of Tony’s head to let him up. Tony pushed himself all the way down while gripping Steve’s thighs. “Fuck -” he cried out reaching to grip Tony’s shoulders tightly as he rode out his orgasm. He barely registered Tony swallowing around him as he came and dropped his head back on the pillow breathing heavily. Tony pulled his head up, giving his dick one last lick before crawling up his side and nuzzling Steve’s neck .
“Do you like what you’re seeing there Cap?” Tony laughed as he languidly slid his body down to the bed while holding his ass in the air in front of Steve.
“I'll do fifty.” Clint held out a hand and she shook it with a large grin. She was going to win fifty dollars in the morning.
Despite the times that they got along, there were the times that they did not get along. When they had first met they were prepared to rip each other's throats out. After one of their first raids on a hydra base at the beginning of the year, Tony had fucked up and ignored one of Steve’s orders. The Captain had approached him in a SHIELD briefing room and practically shouted at him for twenty minutes about responsibility. He had pointed out that no one was injured and his plan had worked, but it had only enraged Steve more. They had not spoken for two weeks after that, and they only spoke again because Natasha had threatened him.
“How can I be quiet when you're shoving your incredible cock in my ass,” Tony replied through heavy breaths. Steve groaned in response as he sunk fully into the tight heat of the genius.
“Tony, what are you doing?” he sighed, scooting to the edge of the bed and settling with his legs dangling over the side. “You gotta relax Cap. You need to sleep,” Tony murmured sitting on his knees behind him.
“No, no sorry,” he ducked his head and practically jumped onto the other side of the bed and laid on his back.
“Then don’t Steve. You want this,” Tony was practically gloating as he ground his hips down against Steve’s.”
“Let me work my magic Capsicle.” Tony placed his hands on Steve’s bare shoulders and he felt himself tensing up. “Relax Captain,” he purred, massaging his upper back.
“I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might…” Laura interrupted shyly.
“Fuck Stevie.” ‘Mhm’ he answered, moving his tongue in slow circles. He carefully spit into his hand and slipped a finger past the taught muscle while Tony squirmed beneath him. He pushed his tongue in even further as he hooked his finger and pressed against the sweet spot that earned him a deep guttural moan from the engineer. He worked a second finger in and began scissoring slowly.
“Then… can you tell me why you like it?” Steve tried, sounding gentle and not judgmental. Keeping an open mind was the key here.
“Ah hahaha… Ohkahay!” Tony agreed, shielding his stomach with one hand and using the other one to reach for his phone. “Uhh… Should I update and delete it?” Tony asked. With everything working out so great, there was no reason for him to keep that account. No more secret lusting, when he had it all in real life.
Steve heard Tony's voice, sounding a bit echoey, and looked around, not spotting his boyfriend anywhere. Only workers and the cars.
Steve read the address, putting on his helmet and starting the bike, making it roar beautifully. Fortunately, it wasn't that far and in all their dating time, he never properly asked what was Tony's day job. It was another step in their relationship and Steve felt privileged to take it, learning a bit more about his boyfriend.
"From the moment I saw you, I felt like I was living in a dream. I was smitten by Red Velvet, some may call it an obsession," Steve said, laughing a bit and having Sam's face in his mind, "but it wasn't until I saw you, the real you, when I realized that reality can be better than dreams. I love and want all of you, and I hope you will take all of me too. So, Tony Stark and Red Velvet, will you marry me?"
"HYP!" Tony jumped when Steve used his thumb and index finger to knead around the middle of his stomach, catching the skin with light pinches. "HEHEHEY!"
Steve felt like the air was punched out of him and stared in shock at his boyfriend. This wasn't a part of the plan. Steve was perfectly aware that Tony's night job would be discussed sooner or later, but he had no idea his boyfriend would bring it up so soon. By the way, color drained off Tony's face, Steve could read that Tony didn't plan it either, it just slipped.
"You are ruining my singing carrier, Steve!" Tony called when he got his voice back. The signature raspiness in his warm baritone was solely thanks to smoking cigarettes.
"Hey, Steve! Look!" he called, raising his hand up and tugging at Steve's sleeve. "Kiss cam!" he said, watching with a smile all the couples exchanging heated kisses.
Nothing like a precise answer. Steve leaned his forehead against the cool, painted wood. Just man up and ask. "I need to use the bathroom, can I come in?"
The upcoming days at school were not calm. It all started the next morning, when Tony was getting out his books, when a red-faced Bucky jumped to him, looking frantic.
"It is a good spot. Comfy," Tony replied, rubbing Steve's cheeks playfully before letting go. He patted his lap back, urging Steve to lay down again. Steve's eyes followed the movement, and then he slid his gaze up, all over the expensive suit and white shirt with undone top buttons, no sight of the tie, his gaze heating up. Such a waste. It all could very well lead in one direction if it wasn't for a question burning in the back of his head.
“Steve,” she huffed out in irritation, “that was the worst interview I ever took part in. It doesn’t take a genius to know that you faked it.”
"Rose water and white chocolate cookies," Kamala smiled proudly. Although the bakery specialized in homemade, traditional pastries, the newly hired young personnel was welcomed to experiment. "Teddy came up with that."
It wasn’t a long distance between the kitchen and the bedroom, but with every step, Tony’s mind was bringing out numerous stories he heard in the past, ones that didn’t have a happy ending until many years later or even at all. Just would Steve have enough of will power to wait until that point?
Steve blushed, hoping that it wasn’t too obvious in the dim light of the bar. “That’s different,” he said weakly, fidgeting in his seat. It really was different.
"Steve? What's wrong?" Tony asked, lifting on his elbows and sounding alarmed. It wasn't like Steve to get sick all out of sudden.
"I am not a makeup artist," Tony confessed, voice coming out strained and pained, "I am a drag queen. Well, three times per week I am a drag queen, sometimes four when I have to fill in someone's shift," Tony tried to joke, but stopped immediately seeing the analyzing look Sarah was giving him. "So, yeah, that's who I am," Tony ended, looking down at the album in his lap, fingers once splayed over the photo from Steve's childhood, curling into a fist from nervousness.
"Thanks!" Steve beamed more, "I have to set up some details now, I will send photos to your phone of who to expect."
Steve snorted. Was that what Tony thought Steve wanted in his life? Sure, Steve could picture himself as a husband and a father, but it was way too early for that discussion. Having a dog was a different story.
Steve's eyes turned a bit soft at the sight. Yeah, it was cute. And the plushies were really well made and detailed, not like some plushies that didn't resemble anything.
Everything seemed to go well and Steve's heart was beating a cheerful melody. Even the expected, sour look Loki had sent him after he had entered the club, didn't bring him down. He stopped in front of Red's changing room, combing a hand through his hair, rehearsing in his mind what he wanted to say.
"Hairnet or get out from my kitchen!" Sam ordered, slamming the pile of dough against the table to get more air bubbles inside.
“I wanted to,” Tony finally spoke, his voice coming out quiet, “I didn’t know how,” this wasn’t a good answer. Tony closed his eyes, not able to look at Steve. “I was embarrassed, I guess.”
The lungful of air was a calming one, and Peter reached his hands to Figaro, babbling softly. There were still some wet traces of tears on his face, but no new ones building up. And then, with all eight teeth Peter had, he smiled, all while looking at the cat.
Steve’s eyes widened. “Oh my God, you didn’t eat for the whole day!” he gasped out, sounding distressed by the discovery.
“He will take the pastrami sandwich. And give him a refill, please,” he turned back to the waitress, moving from the bar area and taking Steve’s wrist to guide him. Steve followed, completely stunned. Hips swaying. Round butt. There was no mistake.
Steve opened his eyes. The voice was deeper and less husked out, but he recognized the intonation. He snapped his head to the side, eyes widening. She came—
Tony smiled, slow and beautiful before he rolled to the edge of the bed and pulled out a shoe box from underneath. He took the lid off and Steve saw a pair of black pumps, made from shiny faux leather, on an extremely high and slim heel, in Tony's size. Steve's breath immediately quickened. He and Red Velvet made out a couple of times, but fooling around with Tony while he was wearing only parts of his female side's wardrobe, was a new level of excitement.
“I read some of your blog,” Steve said and Tony panicked again, Steve holding him closer when he felt brunet’s body tense, “and I understand how hard it is for you to talk about it and how important it is for you. I really do. If anything, I am… a bit disappointed you didn’t tell me. Why didn’t you?”
Tony groaned and threw arms over his face, covering himself. “I hate you and your young, smooth skin,” he grunted, sounding embarrassed. The age difference between them wasn’t so big to start with, but sometimes Tony felt more bothered by it.
"Yeah, family," Steve nodded, remembering the day the Wilson family moved into the neighborhood. They had renovated a shop that used to be a barber place, and Mrs. Wilson finally fulfilled her dream of owning a bakery, a ten-year-old Sam and his siblings helping in every way they could. With time, Sam's older siblings went to live on their own in different parts of the country, and Sam stayed with his mom, still helping. When she was unable to work anymore, Sam took over the business, letting his mom's dream live on through him. Like every person, Sam had doubts about what he was doing, and Steve could see it more often in his friend. Yet, today in the bakery… Sam looked truly happy.
“Gay radar,” Red Velvet added, unlocking the door, “we all have it here. Sorry, Arrow, I really have to get ready. And you should too! Your stubble is growing back!” she teased, pointing to the area around her mouth.
"Hi, Kamala," Steve greeted the dark haired girl behind the counter. He took a deep breath, smelling all the frosting and sweet toppings and some earthy notes of a good, real bread. It was a special smell.
For a moment, he considered calling out to Steve, asking if he was alright. But in the next he scolded himself for being so soft.
Tony raised a brow, pulling back his hand as his frustration grew. “God, why do you always have to do this? You always want to be the martyr, the one who lays it all on the line. For once, why can’t you just let me fight for the things I want? Why can’t you just trust me?”
Steve did as he was told. God, he looked like a child getting scolded. Tony took the few steps forward until Steve was looking down on him, as visible as it could be in the dark. They watched each other for a while, neither moving, before Tony continued.
Tony reached out a hand to open it, but stopped, and turned on his heels, practically slamming into Steve as he pulled him down for another kiss, open mouthed and slow. When he pulled away, Steve could only stare, tongue darting out over his own lips instinctively.
Tony looked around a moment, gaze lingering over the sparse furniture. “I’ve got to say, I’m surprised by the modernity. Always pegged you as an antique knick-knack kind of guy.”
Strange interrupted him before he could continue. “I can assure you all is well in this reality. However, there are infinite universes, infinite timelines outside of ours. As displeasing as they may be, they are not our responsibility to atone for.”
Steve didn’t look like any of that made him feel better.  “I’ve never hated you, Tony. You know that.”
His final yell was barely audible over Bucky’s scream as his arm was blasted off, sending him halfway across the floor, dazed and most likely concussed. Some probable nerve damage. Just looking at the arm, seeing the way it had moved, Tony knew it had been linked to blood and tissue, that it could feel and hurt just like the rest of him.
. “Listen, I know Natasha was the one who called, so don’t feel like you need to keep talking. I understand if you have something more important to--”
Tony shrugged, dipping his head. “That maybe that could be incentive enough for you, for all of you, to come back home.” The last word had to be practically dragged from his throat, ripped from between clenched teeth, but he knew it needed to be said. He felt better with it out in the air, the concept, the idea hanging between them.
Bruce looked at Steve a moment, then to Tony, thinking, before shrugging a shoulder. “Well, I mean, we haven’t exactly made it a priority, but--”
“We should, uh, get back,” Tony said, motioning behind him to the door. Steve looked at it, then back at Tony. “Supposed to be testing and all that.”
Natasha’s gaze became sympathetic, and she reached out a hand, tilting Steve’s lowered chin back up. “Hey, Tony might be emotionally complicated at times, but he’s not dumb. He knows you, and he knows better than to think anything you say isn’t coming from a place of care. We all do. Okay?”
When he turned, Tony was staring in awe, an even bigger smile growing on his face. “Holy shit. You are jealous.”
Tony only had time to pull the dusty covers off some idle furniture and open a few windows before he heard the soft purr of an engine outside.
“I just wanted to make sure you were okay,” he said, eventually, and it was such a quiet, heartfelt confession that Tony was surprised by his need to hide it. “And I also wanted to apologize, about what I said--”
“Bye, Tony,” Natasha said as he walked away, waiting until the man was out of side before rounding on Steve, expression scolding. “What the hell was that, Rogers?”
“I...wasn’t sure,” Tony admitted, before lighting up. “But now that I know you’ve been pining after me for months...”
“I just think he should be...more involved. He’s still part of the team, but we haven’t had a chance to even talk seriously about, well, anything.” And it was true. After Ultron, Tony has basically dumped Steve with the others at the compound and left without a word. Whenever he did visit, it was always to either talk to Rhodey or drop off a new invention.
“I’ll have Friday send you the location,” he said, checking his watch. Pepper was sure to come looking for him any minute now. “Guess I’ll see you soon?”
The sigh that came over the phone was heavy and unfiltered, and Tony swore he could see Steve’s patented this-is-a-bad-idea face so clearly it was like he was right there in the hall with him.  “I don’t know. I’m just not sure if the compound is---”
Tony couldn’t stop the amused noise he made at the mention of ‘friend’. “Oh? I’ll be sure to let Sam and Natasha know to look out for a shield to the chest next time I see them.”
That got a smile out of Steve, who huffed childishly before wrapping his arms around Tony, pressing the two of them into a tight hug
“Steve?” He heard himself say, voice gargled from inside the suit, communication system barely hanging on.
He cleared his throat a moment, finding a steady tone. “What did she want anyway?” he asked, hoping to change the subject.
“Oh, hey,” Tony said, looking between Steve and Natasha quickly before returning to his phone. He waited until the two of them caught up to him before pocketing it. “What’s up? You look sweaty.”
Steve halted immediately, and only then was Tony able to recognize the want in Steve’s eyes, the flush of his face. He couldn’t help but laugh.
“Hey.” Tony reached out reflexively, grabbing on to Steve’s jacket, keeping him close. “Look, yeah, I might still be a little shaken from everything that’s happened, but who wouldn’t be? It’s nothing we can’t overcome. You know this. I know you. I trust you.”
Just the name was enough to shut him up. “Right. Rambling. Sorry. What I mean to say is that, it’s okay. Us talking. Right now. I’m, uh, glad you’re doing okay. You are doing okay, right?”
Steve reached a hand up to rest gently against Tony’s jaw, warm and gentle. Tony closed his eyes and tried his best not to lean into the touch.
Steve tried to answer, but even he wasn’t sure. It was like even looking at Tony just made him...“I don’t know. Sorry.”
Steve didn’t move when Tony cradled his face in his hands, eyes trained on only him. Willing Steve to understand.  To let whatever was going on in his head go.
Tony shook his head. “Nah. She’s pretty tight-lipped when she wants to be. But Wanda seemed concerned about you when I called her awhile back, and then Sam had told me about the incident after our brainstorming session, so--”
It all seemed to stop, time finally slowing, as he watched a frail, sickly version of himself press his reactor into Steve’s hand before collapsing. He didn’t remember doing that, couldn’t recall the words that had come out of his mouth only moments before.
He hadn’t expected Steve to crush him to his chest, arms wrapped around Tony tight, almost desperate.
“No, it’s not,” Steve argued, letting the shield now fall to the wayside, focusing only on Tony. “I don’t want to say things that hurt you, Tony, especially when they aren’t true. I don’t want to lie to you.  Not anymore.”
The sound of glass breaking startled him as he entered a nearby hall. It was followed by a few curses and then silence. Moving closer, Tony took note of a familiar door. The silver nameplate next to it read
Steve hadn’t seen him since Sekovia. He’d been told the man had undergone some kind of physical distress the last time he’d Hulked out, so he’d been laying low and resting ever since. Although, apparently, he’d also been spending time with Tony, as the two regaled the team with their new designs for equipment, along with an updated schematic for the compound’s defense system.
God, not now, Tony told himself. He closed his eyes, attempting to will the panic in his chest away. This was different, Steve wasn’t going to hurt him, he wouldn’t, he’d never---
“Sure,” Natasha said after a moment, lip quirking briefly. She made a grab for Steve’s bottle, which he quickly raised out of her reach. She shot him a look, shaking her own, empty one, and Steve sighed before handing it her way. “Not jealous. Just bothered by the fact that Stark wants to spend time with everyone but you.”
“You could have just called,” Steve pointed out. Why make the trip at all? They all had been gifted new Stark phones only a few months back. Seemed strange to not put them to use, especially given the drive form the tower to the compound.
“See if you get a fucking present from me this year,” Tony said aloud, grimacing at the idea of the Avengers being together for the holidays. Fat chance of that ever happening, especially now. “Fuck.”
Steve raised his head, uncurling from his seat on the porch steps. He’d been leaning against the railing, head hung low and shield laid gently against his legs. When Tony said his name, he picked it up and looked over it in the darkness.
Steve moved his hips to press back into him, and Tony let his head fall back, a pleasurable groan tearing from his lips. This angle was so much better than before.
Tony seemed amused by the question, as if the answer was obvious. “You know I built this place, right? Be a bit weird not to give myself override access.”
Tony thought that made sense. He pulled away from Steve, but remained unable to look away from those bright, blue eyes. They weren’t filled with rage anymore, only a lingering fondness Tony couldn’t allow himself to read into. Not anymore. “I think I changed something. In the past. I—“
, his mind supplied, helpfully. He waved it away as best he could, and instead of turning back to where the others were, he went the opposite way, needing a moment alone.
Steve smiled politely at that, and watched as Tony didn’t leave. Instead, he made his way across the room and sat down on the bed beside Steve. He didn’t look at him, however. Instead, he just stared straight ahead, as if observing the wall in front of them.
Tony didn’t say anything, but took the lifted hand and placed it back down, placing his own hand on top of it, holding it in place. “Were you really jealous?”
He replied without speaking, moving himself forward to kiss Tony just as softly, and placed a hand against the man’s thigh, fingertips pushing into skin just so. Tony made a surprised sound, barely audible, but it made Steve laugh against Tony’s mouth, and Tony took the opening to commandeer the moment and slip his tongue inside Steve’s mouth.
Steve was a bit taken aback by the intensity with which Tony spoke, practically watching as the man frayed apart before him at some hypothetical. So he let Tony hang on to him, and he placed his other hand over Tony’s, hoping to comfort. Ground him in the now.
Tony kept his hand on the door as he opened it, not bothering to turn around. “I don’t know,” he admitted finally and made sure to slam the door on the way out.
A muffled voice on Natasha’s end interrupted them. She said something back, mouth away from the phone, probably covered with one hand. Spies, Tony begrudged, wanting to roll his eyes. “Natasha? You still there?”
Steve put the holopad down, leaning back in his seat. He was still dressed in his uniform, cowl pushed off his face. It smelled like smoke. “He broke the perimeter. Strayed from formation.”
Bucky was crowding him against the wall now, tearing at his reactor as he screamed something unintelligible, and Tony remembered panicking, anger and fear raging, the voice in his suit too loud—
Seeing Steve naked wasn’t as weird as Tony thought it might be. Having grown up practically idolizing the man, remembering how much his dad had raved about him during one in a million family dinners, he thought there might be some ingrained awkwardness between them because of it.
“Because you won’t even admit what those feelings are, Rogers,” Natasha snapped, and the look in her eyes was deadly. Angry. That wasn’t ideal. “Whatever’s going on inside that head of yours, you need to stop taking it out on everyone else. Deal with your shit or I’ll deal with it for you.”
“Tony.” Steve said his name with a sigh and, ah, yes. There it was. That golden boy glare. “Look, you don’t have to play nice with me. I came here because you asked, because you’re my friend--”
“In my car,” Tony explained, nonchalant. His hands smoothed out where they’d grasped Steve’s shirt, dragging slow. Maybe a little teasing. “Whatever you’re thinking we need, I have it. Don’t you know a Stark always comes prepared?”
“Only because it’s true,” Natasha shot back before walking away. Steve only watched her a moment before pressing the button for the elevator.
“No it’s not,” Steve cut in, voice louder now, angry. Tony couldn’t stop himself from flinching, arms now raised in defense, and that seemed to break Steve even more. “God, look at you. Even now you’re scared of me. Of what I might do to you.”
Natasha watched Steve a moment before sighing, arms dropping. “Get some rest, Rogers,” was all she said before leaving, tone final, and the sound of the metal door whooshing close behind her echoed in the room.
Steve began nodding slowly, his next exhale a bit shaky. “Always,” was his reply, and Tony knew it to be truer than anything either of them had said that day. It was always the small things with them. How they seemed to forget to exist outside of the subtle. Sometimes, they forgot that they had the ability to hold what they wanted, what they felt, in the curve of their hands. It made most of their relationship very, very frustrating.
Sam was out of his seat quickly, coming along to Bruce’s side to offer a pat on the shoulder and something spoken low enough Steve couldn’t hear. Vision hesitated a moment, looking to Wanda who was still curled in on herself. She looked up with a smile, noticing his gaze, before tilting her head after Sam, and Vision must have taken that as approval to do as Tony asked.
