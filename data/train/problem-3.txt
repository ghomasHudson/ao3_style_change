He kept his eyes closed and took stock. A warm hand still gently holding on to his wrist, a dip in the mattress where someone else was lying nearby. A stray ray of sunshine falling through the gap in the curtains and warming his back.
Next to him, John chuckled.
They exchanged glances and the woman took another step forward.
Lestrade smelled very much the way he looked, John decided. Copious amounts of coffee, paper, exhaustion, nicotine and - surprisingly - a hint of cinnamon.
He carefully returned the ring to its bag and then frowned at it. Perhaps it was an heirloom? That would explain the odd engraving. Either way, it didn't seem like a good idea to leave it lying around out here, where anyone might take it. He'd keep it on his person until Sherlock got out of here, keep it safe for him. Nodding to himself, John shoved the small bag into his pocket.
He threw them to her and she caught them with one hand. John found his eyes tracking their flight trajectory and was almost disappointed to see them land safely in Donovan's hand. He would have quite liked something to chase.
Before he could say anything, Sherlock disappeared into his bedroom, returning several minutes later with his overnight bag. He always had one at hand for out-of-town cases and only needed to throw in some toiletries to be ready to go.
"I'll have the results of the other tests in a day or two," she told Sherlock before turning to John. "Hi there, Johnny."
"Tell him Sasha sends her love," she said. "There is no code I can give you in return. You will know him when you see him and you will only see him when he wishes you to."
He swore he could feel Sherlock blush. "Well, there was only one of me and a whole group of soldiers."
Half an hour later found John sniffing at the door to the victim's flat as Sherlock carefully peeled back the police seal and inserted the key. Lestrade stood next to them in the hallway, looking as uneasy as if they were accessing the crime scene illegally instead of in the company of the lead investigator, who happened to be Lestrade himself.
Sherlock spent the rest of the day going over the case files again and re-watching the security footage in the helpless hope that something might jump out at him.

"Similar reasons, I suppose. Well, without the boyfriend. Sometimes you just get too much going through your head and need a way to unwind, you know?"
But it wasn't Mycroft standing in the sitting room.
*****
There was a skip next to him, blocking most of the light that came from the street lamp just around the corner.
"Michelle," John corrected him, sounding surprised. "I completely forgot about that. Too busy trying to figure out where you had gone and trying not to worry about you. What's that got to do with you getting drunk?"
"Fine. We did warn you, though."
The next day found them standing at another crime scene in the early morning hours, surrounded by police and more witnesses than they knew what to do with. The victim had collapsed in the middle of Waterloo station during the early morning rush hour.
"A whirlpool, actually," Harry told him. "I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
John whined at him and rolled his eyes, but couldn't help but think
After the experience of Sherlock Holmes in the flesh and his subsequent online research, John supposed he should have been ready for anything, but there was nothing to prepare him for the fact that the landlady of the flat they were inspecting was an elderly deer changeling. Even more surprisingly, Sherlock greeted her with a gesture that hinted at a hug and a kiss to the cheek. There was no actual contact, of course, but the suggestion was there.
It was an anchor and a lifeline, a pulsing thing of love and rage and fear. And it pulled him straight to Sherlock.
Sherlock stalked towards him and came to a halt very much inside his personal space. "Over my dead body. I'm taking John with me and I'll be keeping an eye on him while you lot work on an antidote to reverse this. And if you try and stop me...," he paused and looked the man over from head to foot, "... well, I'd like to see what animal I could turn
Several seconds passed in which the only sound was John's continued growling.
more and not let go of it ever again once I've got it."
He blew out an angry breath, made sure the towel was tied securely around his waist, squared his shoulders, opened the door -
The remainder of the day passed in a series of naps interspersed with Sherlock being his usual crazy self.
John had noticed the weight loss. And Sherlock had flinched a good bit during their recent conversations, though it hadn't been particularly noisy. John frowned. "I haven't really spent much time with him. I'll... I'll keep an eye out. Thanks for the warning."
"Bad results?" he asked.
"Should we-" he began.
They don't talk about it for two weeks.
And John, perfect, unpredictable John, kisses the corner of his mouth and says 'Hurry.'
Her name was Molly, that much could be gathered from the few words the other Psy spoke to her, and John could not help but wonder how someone so shy and demure could possibly survive in the cold environment of Psy society. In John's opinion, she acted more like a non-predatory or submissive changeling might than other members of her emotionless race.
Sherlock's whole body jerked and he actually jumped back in surprise, breaking the contact.
Now that she has a way of linking Mary to at least one of the victims, it's time to return to her actual plan. A woman walking down a street is hardly evidence of a crime. Sally needs more if she wants this to stick.
The hotel owner, a Mr Kingsley from London, had quickly responded to his request for a guest list the day before they had left for the hotel and a quick google search had provided some additional information about them, so he indulged in a minute or two of matching names to faces, made more difficult by the fact that there was no guarantee he was getting it right. However, he didn't call himself a genius for nothing.
He wondered what it was that made John look at him like this, but the thought was fleeting, there and gone again. He didn't really care so long as John would just keep looking at him like Sherlock was all he had ever wanted.
"Want me to get up?"
Sherlock hesitated. "I ... you might not like this."
"Sometime in the early morning hours," Lestrade told him. "I've got some PCs canvassing the neighbourhood. Perhaps we'll find a witness."
He knew what that meant, what that could mean, and it was all he could do not to vomit right then and there. And he knew where his best chance of getting her back lay. He just needed to reach out and grasp it.
"No."
He smiled fondly at the memory. They had played Catch and practised sneaking up on one another and the amused adult members of the pack. Even then John had loved the playful fights and, when he got older, he had started to entertain hopes of one day making Sentinel, one of the top soldiers of the pack. But puberty had happened and his loner status had asserted itself and he had decided that he couldn't properly serve as Sentinel when all he wanted was to be as far away as possible and that was that.
A slow, tentative smile curled around the corners of Sherlock's mouth. "Mmh, it is rather cold out here. And I believe you did say something about a hot tub."
And he threw the stick as far as he could.
"Came to check on you," John said easily, reclaiming his chair. "Do you remember how you got here?"
Sherlock licked his lips and nodded. "I- yes. More?"
Sherlock ran his statement through his head again, filtered it through the moment they had just had, and elaborated: “Out of this dark niche if you want to see me with this ridiculous flower wig.”
Sherlock blinked. It took barely a second for the idea to form. A man like Moriarty wouldn't have broken his Silence. He would have used it, honed it to perfection, learned all its borders and carefully arranged his own life to work around them. Because Moriarty only knew how to shatter minds. He didn't know how they worked, how the Silence was anchored, how the pain triggers could be disabled. Sherlock didn't know either. But if there was one thing he had become an expert in, it was triggering dissonance.
He traced the scent up the stairs and to a closed door that most likely led into Benjamin Forsythe's childhood room. No doubt he had still made use of it when coming over to visit his parents. The scent did not grow stronger, though, leading John to conclude that whatever had caused it could not be found inside the room.
*****
He pressed his lips together to stop them from escaping, staring straight ahead over the crown of John's head, unseeing, unblinking.
Slowly, he raised his gaze to meet John’s eyes and demonstratively licked his lips. “I’m starving.” Pause. “Are you done in the bathroom?”
"It was perfect," Sherlock said. "Your daughter is turning into quite the ornithologist."
"I'll have someone look into it," Lestrade promised. "But it's not your style to just sit here and come up with theories. We can do that ourselves. I come for you when I need hard evidence, Sherlock."
And it had been beyond his control, it truly had. Perhaps he could have stopped himself from shoving Sherlock to the floor but that was hardly fair. He had been entitled to his anger. Time and distance had allowed Sherlock to understand and accept that. After all, if John had tackled him to the floor to hug him from sheer joy, the result would have been the same. Of course there would be consequences to his leaving for two years, of pretending to be dead. He merely hadn’t expected them, or John’s fury. Or Mary.
Part of him was uncomfortable at the thought, but mostly he was uncomfortable with how much he liked it. Affection was nice, touch was nice, and he liked having both directed at him - but he wasn’t used to the idea of Sherlock being the person providing all of this.
He could almost hear Sherlock rolling his eyes, but his reply was soft. "Good night, John."
Surely, this was paradise.
Sherlock identified a thrill of warmth that he suspected wasn't quite in keeping with the terror he was supposed to feel.
"There are several Psy designations that have to initiate physical contact for their power to work. Most of the Psychometry skill set is firmly linked to contact."
"I really don't have the patience for your admonitions right now," he rasped, still refusing to move. If he stayed where he was, perhaps Mycroft would just give up.
"What else?" John asked.
He would have been a fool to miss the relief in Sherlock's eyes, even as it mingled with disappointment. John sympathised entirely. "Come here."
For a full three seconds, neither of them does anything. They just stand there, lips pressed together.
He grasped John's hips and scooted back a little to drink him in, the infinite softness of him stretched over a steely core, much like John himself. So deceptive, so marvellous.
The actual thunderstorm wasn't even the main problem, he admitted wryly to himself. No, the real issue was that with all this noise, he had no way of making sure Sherlock was fine without seeking him out. Usually, once the sounds of traffic had calmed down at night, he could hear the man's heartbeat even while up in his room. But now? Nothing. He had stayed in the sitting room in hopes that the increased proximity would help, but the cacophony outside drowned out every other sound.
The thought was sobering and he sighed in defeat. He had less than six days left and the clock was ticking. He was starting to think that perhaps he should just give up and let sleeping dogs lie.
"Yeah, I heard," John told him. "Changeling hearing, remember."
"Dinner is at 6," she calls after him. "Don't be late or we will have words!"
He followed that with a general rundown of the case Sherlock had solved while he had been 'away' and concluded by saying that Johnny the dog was now back with Sherlock's parents and that Sherlock was moping about and pretending not to miss him.
"A what?"
The sensible thing would be to move away and go back to sleep before Sherlock woke and had time to wonder what John was doing so close to him - a question John had no answer to that wouldn't raise more questions.
Sherlock makes a tiny, choked noise and falls into him.
"In that case," he said softly, "I hope you enjoy being disappointed."
"This is my second batch," Mrs Hudson told her earlier. "A certain someone ate the first yesterday afternoon."
They stared at one another for a long moment and Sherlock wondered if his own eyes were as wide and dark as John's.
This exile had been his choice, the second time around even more so. There was no danger of drugs now. He was finally done with that and he wouldn't go back. Impossible to find anyone dealing here, anyway. They only had weed they were growing in their greenhouses next to the tomatoes and everyone pretended not to know.
The moment he processed this knowledge was the moment Sherlock woke, too, perhaps drawn from sleep by the sudden tension in John’s body. It was a tension Sherlock immediately mirrored.
"Wait until she gets her keys out," Sherlock said softly. "John, you know what to do if she runs. And for god's sake, mind the traffic."
Sherlock doesn't know either, but he decides to hazard a suggestion anyway. "Perhaps you're simply not ready yet. The circumstances under which your last relationship ended were rather traumatising and-"
The doctor nodded and proceeded to disinfect the wound before going in search of bandages. "Has he been neutered?"
John wagged his tail excitedly as Sherlock reclaimed his lead from Sally and started to walk away. Finally! He had no idea how much time had passed but it had felt like an eternity, him being forced to stay behind and wait for Sherlock to finish examining the body. And while having his ears scratched by Donovan was fine, it was nothing in comparison to having Sherlock right there and moving.
There was something about his tone of voice that made Sherlock comply. His datapad floated into his outstretched hand and he quickly navigated to his messages.
Holmes doesn't talk much on these occasions and she rarely addresses him. They simply don't have much to say to each other.
Something wet and warm dripped onto his shoulder and for a moment he thought Sherlock was crying - nothing seemed impossible just now.
John hates it.
"Packing," Sherlock said, not turning around.
Sherlock's mouth twisted into a sad little smile. "Let's just say my return did not go quite as I had hoped."
"What do people normally say?"
There were more first times - their first meal together as a family, their first time taking Redbeard for a walk. This one was just Sherlock and Rosie while John stayed behind to supervise Mycroft's people as they brought in all of Sherlock's things. He hadn't brought many, but there was still enough chaos to make it a good idea to get the child and dog out of the way. Sherlock, of course, would have paid a fortune for the chance to walk through Regents Park with Rosie and Redbeard, and so was quite happy to be able to do so for free.
He hesitated. "All I know is that for people like me, Silence is a blessing and a gift."
Several seconds passed as Sherlock worked through all the things John had very loudly not said.
He bent and unhooked the lead from John's collar.
John followed Sherlock into the house and almost forgot to close the front door behind him. Had Sherlock just blushed at being called a ‘lovebird’ by the cabbie or was that John’s imagination? It couldn’t have been the heat, not in the comfortably cool back of the cab.
"Don't look like that, John. He'll be back in no time at all, just you wait. Your man can look after himself for a time, even though you wouldn't believe it just looking at him," Mrs Hudson tried to console him, patting his back and ruffling his ears. "Now budge up, they're showing Skyfall on Channel 4. That Daniel Craig is a fine specimen of man, let me tell you."
"Make yourself at home," he muttered, pushing the chair opposite himself away from the table with his foot.
"John, what are you doing?"
"It worked," Judd said, confirming what Sherlock had perceived from their hours of work. "The kill-switch has been disabled and reprogrammed and the dissonance triggers have been removed."
“Mycroft had me see a very good, very discreet doctor who does all sorts of patch-up jobs for certain people. He did his best. And of course some of the wounds were older because I got them in other places. That small scar near my left kidney is from a knife to the back in Bangladesh.”
"She will be provided for," Sherlock said. "You know she will. All that I have is hers. She will be able to do anything, go anywhere, study whatever she likes so long as she is clever enough. And she will be."
In the same time, Sally follows up on all her leads and ties together loose ends. She'll not let Mary slip through her fingers. She sure as hell won't let her walk free. Not after spending almost half a year investigating her every move.
Sherlock let the handcuffs that had tied his arms to the back of the chair fall to the floor. "I would have been disappointed if they had been," he said and rearranged himself in his chair until he was sitting comfortably, his arms crossed loosely in front of him. "Well? You wanted my attention. Now what?"
He pointed them to the cluttered sideboard where an old phone with a dialing disk was perched precariously on a pile of paper.
Mrs Hudson shakes her head sadly. "There is nothing we can do, dear. I'd tell you to go up and talk to him but he's got visitors."
"And I was so stupid," he continued. "After you died and I met Mary, I clung to her like a drowning person clings to a piece of driftwood. She was all that kept me going. So when you came back, it was a shock. And it was terrifying. What if you disappeared again? What if you left me behind again? I knew I couldn't do it again. I told you the other day and I meant it:
He walked into the kitchen, back ramrod straight, and pulled the divorce papers out of a drawer that John was reasonably sure also contained several tongue depressors and a handful of pipe cleaners.
John was the one expressing something so perhaps Sherlock should focus on possible meanings behind that touch.
"Oh."
John dragged Mrs Hudson through Regent's Park at a much slower pace than he and Sherlock usually took. The weather was nice and she seemed perfectly happy to be going for a walk with him. And this had the added bonus of leaving 221 Baker Street completely empty except for Sherlock.
Within minutes they were in a cab on the way to the address Lestrade had texted and Sherlock was giving him a run-down of what he knew so far. The DI had been sparing with the details but that had never stopped Sherlock from knowing more than he should.
John did not intend to let that happen and while he told himself that this was entirely due to his unwillingness to have to listen to that, seeing as he had no means of escape, he knew that he wasn't yet ready to admit the other reason for his utter refusal of the very idea.
"Much better," Sherlock murmured.
"Some of the Yarders are ... reluctant when it comes to working with me," Sherlock said, masterfully downplaying years of mutual animosity. "Having a medical expert I could trust on hand would be immensely helpful."
He blinked at her, trying to make the words make sense.
Either way, things stay the same. Sherlock no longer looks wary and there's no extra distance between them. John continues to make a lot of tea at the drop of a hat.
need me to wait."
"You've done that before," he finally said.
John didn't even look at him, just stared fixedly ahead, his body tense and poised, as if he were ready to fling himself out of the car at any moment.
Now, though, after a week of being separated and only able to talk on the phone at night, the idea of it not happening didn't even arise. They simply got ready for bed together, brushing their teeth side by side, and walked into the bedroom hand in hand.
John seemed utterly relaxed, leaning into his touch with absolute trust and every sign of enjoyment. That was good, Sherlock thought. As a tactile man, he had been itching to run his hands through the thick fur all the time, and now it was readily apparent that John did not mind in the slightest. Perhaps his transformation had also eradicated the few remaining personal boundaries between them. He wondered what would happen when John was back in his real body. Would the boundaries return?
"Oh," Sherlock breathed. And then, a bit louder: "Oh!"
Greg got himself a pint and Sherlock a cider because he may not be a genius but he did pay attention to people. He sat down and shoved the menu in Sherlock's face. "Here, choose something. You're only allowed a starter or dessert if you also get a main."
. I do not want you here, not today and not any other time. I already told you you were right. There, I've repeated it. Are you happy now?!"
He sighed. "John deserves better. I want him to have someone whom he can touch whenever he wants, who won't develop a brain haemorrhage from a simple hug."
"To one member of the council," Sherlock corrected. "It used to be Councillor Ming LeBron but he lost their loyalty some time ago. The Arrows are not loyal to the Council or even the Silence Protocol. Their loyalty belongs to the PsyNet. Nothing more, nothing less. They are all well-trained killers and assassins, the best fighting unit in the world. There isn't a threat they could not deal with. Only the best of the best are chosen and trained for the Arrow Squad. They move like ghosts. Every single one of them is more dangerous than half the council combined."
Sherlock shrugged. "You would have done the same thing for me."
Once they had left half an hour later, Sherlock moved over to the sofa, gave John a look and held up his datapad
Sherlock grinned. "Thought you'd appreciate that one."
"In that case, I cannot help you," Sherlock told him calmly. "Except to suggest that you seek out a different therapist."
He dived back in.
"No," John replied and tried to think back. Was there anyone Sherlock might have met while planning his wedd-
Sherlock stared back, always helpless to tear himself away when John was touching him. He saw the look in John's eyes, the intent, and dropped his head.
"It's a sanitary thing, sir."
"If you say so."
"Okay, I'm almost done here," he said, working to sound as reassuring as possible as he shoved the fabric the rest of the way down. Thankfully, Sherlock's calves were slender enough for his trousers to move much more easily here.
"Broadly speaking, yes."
"All of what?"
John had been too breathless with joy to pay attention to anything else and now they were both paying the price for his inattention.
Sally smiles again. She types "RESEARCH" and hits 'send'.
"I think Sergeant Donovan elbowed me in the stomach," John provided, wincing at the memory. "But I think I may have stepped on her foot in retaliation, so we're even."
With the wistfulness came trepidation - he didn't like the idea of returning to Baskerville and he certainly didn't enjoy the thought of being poked and prodded and perhaps injected with something. Being a dog was not his preferred choice, but at least it was a stable state of being and didn't come with any potential side effects. There was only so much that could go wrong with being a dog but quite a lot of things that could go wrong with being transformed from a dog back into a human. John would quite like to have his own body intact and the correct shape, thank you very much.
Sherlock smiled back, relieved. "Me too, John."
"Short of not strangling him, I don't have any," she says. "Not to step on your toes but I don't think we're very well-suited."
John did. "Vaguely. That was a nine, wasn't it? I mostly remember you not sleeping and experimenting with various compounds to find out how the robbers had caused the memory loss..."
"Are you going to stop talking to me now, too?" he murmured, leaning forward so his mouth was just a hair's breadth from touching the soft shell of Sherlock's ear.
"Hey, hey, come here. Don't ..."
Molly's reply arrives seconds later:
Their arrival at the small flat in Lambeth was greeted with mixed reactions. Lestrade seemed happy to see them both and greeted John with a slap on his good shoulder and a gruff ”Good to see you getting back in the saddle, John” that was just loud enough to make the rest of his team duck their heads and keep their comments to themselves, though of course some still eyed him curiously. John felt a bit like an exhibit at the zoo and tried to tune them out as best he could.
"Wrong answer," the DI said. "And what about food? Have you eaten? You could cut someone with those bloody cheekbones of yours."
He had felt guilty, in between all the horror and - worse - the relief. Because he had been relieved and he knew it was irrational to think his personal wishes had anything to do with what happened, but some things defied all logic.
"Got it," he says, rocking back down as he switches the light on. Both movements happen almost simultaneously and so John has the perfect view of Sherlock's face as he unconsciously lowers himself right onto the detective's lap.
Sherlock frowned at him. "Yes, of course. She's your daughter, John. I don't care who else contributed to her DNA. From the moment I first saw her, I knew she was all you. In every way that matters, she's yours alone."
Sherlock shrugs. "Headbutted, in fact."
"At home, I would think. I left before he rose this morning."
Finally, he spoke, his voice as faraway as the look in his eyes. "I don't remember how I got home that night. One moment I was standing outside your door and the next I was reading that letter and then I was ... here. I wasn't ... I know I walked here but I have no recollection of it. I came to see you because I had to, because I needed to make sure you and Rosie were all right. I would have given anything, done anything you asked. And this was what you asked of me. To stay away."
Sherlock stood and shoved both phones into his pocket. It was time to find John and have another chat.
It's enough to break the spell and John jerks back, breathless. He's exhilarated and terrified in equal measure and unable to tell which of these is caused by kissing Sherlock and which by chasing and being chased by a murderer.
They managed to get through four months of what passed for peace in their life.
"Fantastic! Thank you, boys. Now off you go and come back in one piece."
"Really, John, it will be fine. We'll go down there, you'll be your usual oblivious self and I'll have no trouble at all looking just as in love with you as ever."
"At least he shaved," he says, apparently to no one in particular. "Perhaps that may be considered progress."
The light inside the fridge was a bit bright after the cozy dim lighting in their living room, so he had to blink a few times in order to focus.
Sherlock choked out a breath, not sure if it had been supposed to be a laugh or not.
So far he had seen Sherlock high on tranquiliser and various painkillers, as well as drugged at Baskerville.
He broke off, shaking his head as much as he could in his position. "I have ... loved you ... from the start."
He had a text from Harry, barely two days old, and since John usually took his sweet time responding - if a response was necessary - she wouldn't have been tipped off by the silence on his end. Harry knew that John sometimes didn't reply for ages if he and Sherlock were in the thick of a case or if his phone had once again been destroyed or forcibly taken off him by whatever criminal had gotten the drop on him. It happened sometimes and Mycroft was usually quick to supply a replacement which then went through the distressing process of Sherlock taking it apart under his microscope to remove all the bugs before John felt comfortable using it.
Sherlock tensed again. “I was in Serbia,” he finally volunteered. “It was the last stop on my journey. I was supposed to infiltrate them but they caught me. I fled but they were faster. They had dogs and helicopters and it was cold and dark. Of course they got me. Three months in their cells. I nicked the key to the locks of my chains from one of the guards. I intended to try to escape. The plan was to either flee or die trying. I couldn’t stand it any more. Of course that was the very day that Mycroft showed up to get me out. We made sure no one else made it out of the compound and then burned the whole thing to the ground.”
He dropped down onto the carpet and peered under the bed, using that as his excuse to delay his reply as he fought not to throw up.
John did, pulling back just long enough to smile down at him. "Merry Christmas, Sherlock Holmes."
"In that case, leaving the Net will be impossible for me," he said softly. "There are no other adult Psy I know who would be willing or able to defect and form a new network with me."
Somehow, inexplicably, John appeared to have moved closer to him. When he spoke, his voice was so low Sherlock had to struggle not to lean down to hear him better.
John nodded, gratitude in his eyes.
*****
Sherlock shrugged. "It was you and I. I don't need anything else."
John clearly wasn't impressed with this assertion. He simply wagged his tail at him, the bastard!
Testosterone, oxytocin, adrenalin ... he had smelled some of these before, back at the lab on Molly.
"I won't," Sherlock said. "Is Anthea still looking after Redbeard?"
Sherlock watched as he paced and wondered if John was aware of the fact that his behaviour was getting increasingly cat-like with each passing day.
John wondered, too, but was too busy thinking about the other aspect of the story. So a Psy – and a Cardinal no less – had not only defected from the Net, but had done so out of love. A mating bond was something every changeling hoped for. There was only one mate for everyone and the bond lasted a lifetime. Mated partners were known to often die soon after the other or even at almost the same time, unable to bear the profound loss. It was a mental bond as much as an emotional one, not something so ridiculous as the human habit of calling anyone their 'soulmate' just because they happened to have some common interests.
John rolled his eyes. "Here, sit up. I've got the good stuff for you."
*****
He brought the tennis ball and throwing arm along and John was glad to get to stretch his legs a bit.
"Indeed. My apologies for the false name but we thought it might tip the killer off that I was on their trail."
And so Sherlock resigned himself to waiting, biding his time in the hopes that something might change and make this whole mess make sense.
Sherlock hated her with a burning passion. He hated her with every fibre of his being and it felt so good to finally allow himself to do so, to have a legitimate reason to resent her beyond the mind-blowing jealousy he had been faced with before. At least now he was justified in his loathing. At least now he was allowed to be glad to his very bones that she was dead and gone.
Sighing in relief as the warm water closed around his body, John reclined in the tub and closed his eyes, resting his head against the edge. "Care to join me?"
John had gone again, stormed out without another word.
There was a knock on the door and a moment later Mrs Hudson poked her head in. "Hoo-hoo, Sherlock dear. Are you all right? I heard the door slam and someone stomping down the stairs and I thought I'd better see how you are doing. We don't want a repeat of your last angry client."
"Oh, shut up, John."
was not a statement you simply forgot. It had brought him up short then and it still did so now, whenever he thought about it.
"I need you to tell me what to do," Sherlock said calmly. "I am not equipped to deal with sentiment but it is obvious that John suffers. He has not said anything to me except that he was friends with your packmate. Now she is dead and he is ... not his usual self. He is losing weight and his mental equilibrium appears shaken. I do not know how to make it better."
"See you tomorrow, then," John says. "And text me if any interesting cases come in. Christmas always has the most interesting murders. Remember that thing with the Christmas cracker?"
“Coming?” John asked, turning around to smile at him and Sherlock realised he had once again stopped walking.
"I don't blame you," John assured him. "It never would have occurred to me to blame you. It wasn't your fault, Sherlock. And of course you were entitled to be relieved. Hell, I would have been relieved, too, if it had been the other way around. I'm certainly rather relieved now, with the wisdom of hindsight."
Time to get up. He didn't want to. He wanted to stay right here and not move and maybe time would simply do him the favour of passing and he could skip over the next year or so until he felt ready to deal with the world again.
John, who was busy preparing a meal in the kitchen, turned towards him. "Come again?"
After a moment, John turned around to face him and Sherlock dropped his hand, somehow sure that letting it trail across John's chest would have an entirely different meaning. He rather suspected it might be more intimate than was allowed. Of course, if you chose to be fastidious about it, he was not allowed any of this. Considering how excited the changeling population seemed about the mating of two Psy women to members of one of the strongest packs in America, Sherlock suspected that the Council would not much like the thought of a Psy-changeling flat-share such as his and John's. Clearly prolonged exposure to changelings was dangerous.
He had never felt so helpless.
John had a glass of wine to go with his pasta. Sherlock stuck to water. This was not going to change. Psy physiology and their unique minds meant they had very interesting reactions to alcohol and therefore didn't drink any if it could be avoided at all. Sherlock didn't think it was a big loss. There were alcohol-free drinks that tasted similarly, were a lot cheaper and didn't cause unwelcome side effects such as hangovers, memory loss and embarrassing behaviour, to name only the top three he had heard of or personally observed in others. It did not sound desirable at all to him.
Sherlock glowered.  “It's not rocket science, John.”
Well, this was hopeless.  John got up and took his sopping wet flannel and his sticky body to the bathroom, where he cleaned up quickly.  He went back, pulled on his trousers, and followed out to the kitchen.  Sherlock had found a dressing gown, which he was wearing with the belt untied, and was searching through the detritus on the table for...something.  The slides, perhaps.  John sighed, and went on his own search.  He found the kettle, tea of dubious age, and some cups.  He found a few other things he's rather not think about as well, such as a bat mummified in salt and a baggie of yellow mush with dead maggots in it, but he did not find any milk or sugar.  Still...the occasion called for tea and he made it.
What relationship do they make with family?  The children of this mother are half Wakandan.  But, the children of this mother have a colonizer father.  Will you allow the father to visit, to stay?  His relatives?”
“She didn't like his looks.  Too rough, she said.   And the boy by the fern.” John smiled.  “Molly said he's too young for me.”
John looked around.  Bar along one side of the room, a dozen tables in the middle, booths along the far wall.  Low lighting in the corners, where couples leaned towards each other.  Lots of ferns in pots.  Copper bowls with fancy artificial candles flickering on each table.  Two thirds of the patrons were men sitting with other men.  “What is it, then?”
No sexy bits, really, in this chapter.  Sorry about that.  I had to go back and add a few words to chapter 3 in defense of John's not THAT tiny dick.  I don't know as that make s much difference, but there you go John.  We got yer back.
This time, Taba didn't object.  She gestured, the ceremonial spear thumped the ground once, and no one protested, so they began to disband.  Good.
“Yes.  Thank you, John. Even after some investigation and analysis there were some aspects the whole affair which were not explained to my satisfaction.”
"Exactly!"
“Whip?”  Whipping dead bodies was not really...good.
“R...right.  Yes.  I will.  I'll call.  Rosie....”  John picked up the suitcase and his bag.
“The problems which drove them away may still be here.  They will bring problems which were thought solved.  Some will want justice.  Or revenge. This will be more trouble than it is worth.”
“Mother's father turned out to be a bigamist,” Sherlock reported to John.
“I'll stop downstairs, say goodbye on my way out,” John was saying.  Mrs. Hudson had Rosie this afternoon.   Sherlock turned and led the way back down the steps.
Sherlock watched John and added, “She sent money, told the friend that Rudy would not be back and instructed her to use the money to raise the children.”
“What I discovered in the secret cabinet is disturbing.  It's going to take some time to untangle the legalities and  it will--” he glanced at Sherlock and did not go on.
Instead he was marveling at how easily Sherlock had been distracted.  But even as the thought passed through is mind Sherlock turned his attention to John again.  The vest was pulled off over his head.  Gentle fingers traced his scars while soft lips pressed into the juncture of shoulder and neck.  John shivered and drew away, reaching out.   He had a slightly hard time pulling off Sherlock's shirt.  He had to do it one-handed as that shoulder didn't have the range of motion to reach so far over his head.  He was reminded again of the sheer maleness of the person he was undressing.
“Tell me about the wager,” the man demanded again.  It was almost charming, but not quite, due to a bit of arrogance in the tone.  Okay.  A lot of arrogance.  The man didn't care how embarrassing it might be for John, he wanted answers to his question.
John's arm shot out, his hand flattened against that sweaty, glorious chest and growled, very politely, “Go clean yourself off and bring me a flannel.  Please.”
Mycroft grimaced, his face turning slightly pink.  Embarrassment?  “I believe it was simply prejudice.  You see, the money she sent went to a bank in Africa.”
“Oh, don't look like that.  It was for a case!”
“It's fine,” she told him hastily.
“Hence the spirited discussion after you had ordered.”  The man gave a nod and  his glance went out over the room.
He wasn't alone in that.  John had questions, too.  Along the line of 'What the fuck?' and, 'What is this, anyway?' and, 'Why did we stop?'
“Porn is quite ineffective for a man of my talents.  For someone who can deduce the participants actual feelings  and motivations it becomes quite, well, distracting.  One actor was quite put off because his partner reminded him of his mother.”
“Will be safe here.  We won't be going out much. I...if there is a case, I'll solve it from here,” he promised awkwardly.
“I know what was my fault.  What I did wrong.”
“Consulting detective.  General public.  Tiresome.  But they usually pay me.”
Sherlock waited.
Right in the middle of it, Sherlock asked, “How do you feel about the violin?”  John never did get to answer.  John was remembering the question, thinking about asking about it.  Although absolutely light-headed and still wiped out, he had no way managed to engage his voice.  When the phone call came, he was almost there, but it all left him again as he watched Sherlock, butt in the air, lean over to find his phone.  As he clutched it to his ear Sherlock fell back into bed, bouncing them both..  After a short exchange of five or six words, Sherlock shot out of bed, scrambling to get dressed.
African Sunrise: The Other Side  Wakanda
“As this is not precisely a gay bar,  she's created an interesting dynamic.”  At john's questioning glance he explained, “I've never kissed a man, myself.”
“And?” Sherlock prodded when Mycroft just sat there.  Mycroft's lip folded over the edge of his teeth in a look which his brother had seldom seen.
Sexy times start here.
There was a long, long silence.
Apparently not.  In fact, Sherlock seemed to be enjoying his explorations.  His fingers coiled through the hairs, raked them, ruffled them and stroked them smooth again.  His large nose traced through them to John's armpit and a red tongue came out and licked him there.
John decided to change the subject. “Some day you'll have to tell me about these cousins that you already know about.  That bad?”
Then Sherlock's hands were deftly undoing his belt and John's stomach was suddenly churning.  The angle was wrong to reciprocate and so he let his hands settle on Sherlock's hips and stepped out of his trousers when they fell to the floor.  Should have taken his shoes off first he thought as he heeled them off. He shivered as the air hit his mostly nude body.   Sherlock stepped out of his own shoes as John  returned the favor, trying to show confidence as he worked at getting the trousers to slide off those hardly-there hips. God, the fabric.
John laughed. “Sounds too good to be true. I’m in.”
Sherlock had never thought that one day he would have to beg help of a changeling pack instead of vice versa.
His own hands were unable to settle, fluttering here and there in a fitful, desperate attempt to touch as much of John as possible at once.
The moment the door to 221b fell closed behind them or they were within the safety of the walls of Scotland Yard, they reached for each other. They were still experimenting with touch and bathtubs and although their time up North helped a lot with both, touch was still new enough for Sherlock to make him absolutely single-minded in his attention towards it.
Sherlock nodded. "I might as well. I don't think it will help much, but we shouldn't leave anything uncovered."
- made his fingers itch like this, the constant urge to reach out and pat his head, stroke his back, scratch that spot behind his ears he knew perfectly well dogs loved having scratched. He even had evidence that this was also true for John-the-dog, thanks to Sally Donovan.
Anthea had made a quick appearance at some point and brought him a change of clothes. Sherlock put them on rather sluggishly, feeling more exhausted than he could remember being in quite some time. He shoved his pyjamas into the bag and looked around for any other items of his but couldn't find any. His phone, which Anthea had also brought, was already nestled safely in his jacket pocket. He couldn't see his watch anywhere, not even in the drawer of the hospital night stand, which meant he must have left it on his night stand at home.
"Only a couple of hours longer," Sherlock said. "If it hasn't burned by 3am, I doubt it will."
That alone would have at least warranted a second look from Sherlock, who had never seen the sense in denying himself anything he actively enjoyed. But a soldier in fatigues with a kind face and kinder words? That was new.
It's disturbing to watch, somehow. Sally wonders if this will become the new normal, now.
"Come sit," Mrs Hudson says to Sally and before she knows it, she finds herself sitting next to Mrs Hudson on the surprisingly comfortable old sofa and Holmes is bent over something on a chair by the window.
"He didn't say hello to me either, if it makes you feel any better," Sherlock muttered, sinking onto the sofa. "Or goodbye."
"Is that important?" John asked, frowning.
"All right," Sherlock said. "We'll get you there another way, then. Don't wriggle around."
John pulled him close and hugged him, clinging to his mad best friend in the crazy hope that it would somehow make Sherlock understand. He didn't want to let go. He didn't want to get married to someone who didn't feel like home.
*****
"The guy jumped head-first into the fire, tore it apart screaming his lungs out," one of the Bobbies says. "Heard it from my mate who was on patrol near the scene. He pulled an unconscious guy out, said he'd been abducted by someone. Who the fuck does that?"
Finally Sherlock nodded and John bounded out onto the landing and down the stairs, pulling his friend along in his enthusiasm to get out of the house. If Sherlock had any complaints, he didn't voice them.
John felt the sudden urge to laugh. He didn't, of course, but it was a close thing. Because he could count the number of times he had seen Sherlock looking uncomfortable or embarrassed on the fingers of one hand and this was one of them.
"Not at all."
They waited until the door was shut behind them and they were sure they had the hallway to themselves.
Louder, she added: "Cash or card? That'll be ₤17.25 please, and we must ask you to leave your dog outside next time."
His heart sped up. If Sherlock was too busy contemplating escape routes to respond to his accusation, there must be something to it. A sliver of something that felt like hope fluttered in his chest.
Sherlock watched him pull his jumper and vest over his head as he went, utterly unashamed. Of course he would be - any shyness his medical training hadn't eradicated would have been taken care of by his time in the military. That was as far as Sherlock's brain got him before his thought process was overwhelmed by the sight of John Watson's broad, muscular shoulders.
"Soon," John promised him. "But I think we've induced enough brain damage in you for one day. Perhaps tomorrow."
After leaving Mary and moving back into 221b, John had started to hit the gym, citing his need to be able to keep up with Sherlock and the various criminals they ended up chasing. Sherlock had seen it as a good sign, a promise of working together the way they used to do. It certainly hadn't escaped his notice that John had gotten rather fit in recent months; he had definitely noticed the way his shirts and trousers fit differently and how his strength and endurance had increased. It hadn't been enough to sufficiently prepare him for the sight of it.
"Best take things slow today," he advised, wishing he knew what Sherlock was thinking. "Your head could probably need some rest from all the high-speed thinking you usually do and your stomach is upset enough already without you rushing all about town."
"What's going on?" John asks as they enter.
Sherlock considered this.
"Don't you have a case going on? Any case at all?" The pleading tone of John's voice was almost disturbing. John didn't like it when people got killed. Perhaps a nice robbery would cheer him up.
"I'm sorry to hear it," Mike said and actually sounded sincere. "Come, let me invite you for a cuppa, for old times' sake."
It happened sometimes, after months of peace, and he wished it wouldn't. He had certainly hoped it wouldn't happen now, while there was a case on and - more importantly - while John was a dog and ridiculously well-equipped to pick up on the state Sherlock was in.
The sound of dozens of instruments hitting the floor and several glass vials and dishes shattering on the tiles added to the horrified shrieks of the scientists.
But Sherlock didn't look convinced. John thought he probably had a right to be sceptical, after everything that had happened. After everything John
He hesitates, opens his mouth and Sally strains her ears but-
He snorted softly. "So you're saying you haven't deduced anything yet?"
He realised he was trembling. "Worse. I need to get out. I'm sorry ... I can't ... I can't stay. It's this or the drugs again and I promised ..."
"Yes," he gasped. "God, yes."
“Oh... of course,” she said, throwing a worried glance at John. “I’ll leave you to it, then. Please do let me know if you’re going to rush off after anyone. I wouldn’t know what to say if that nice Detective Inspector Lestrade came around asking for you.”
Something wet hit John's cheek and it took Sherlock an embarrassingly long time to realise it was a tear and that he was crying. When had that happened?
*****
Sherlock's hand stilled. "From your own room, too? Incredible." He chuckled. "And to think I thought you might not be able to hear me talk from up there."
"She won't be alone," Emily said quietly, drawing Sherlock's attention back to her. "That was my nephew up there."
“Oh, Sherlock,” she said, catching sight of him on the floor in the middle of the carnage.
She sighs. "I think John has forgiven him for ... well, the past two years. Or at least he's trying to or they're both pretending he has. Who knows. But he also just dragged Mary through the house for an engagement party. I guess you can make of that what you will."
John bit the insides of his cheeks to hide his smile. It was such a Sherlock thing to say.
(See the end of the chapter for
A quiet sound caught his attention. John froze, listening. Was that movement downstairs?
It was just possible that Sherlock had gone a little pale at this but it was hard to tell. He looked as if he hadn't been outside in weeks.
But in that moment, it didn't matter. It didn't matter because they were finally seeing eye to eye, finally understanding each other again. After two years and four endless months of separation, they were finally together again. Nothing else mattered.
John nodded. "Right. Sure. Neither has anyone else, I think. So these papers...?"
That earned him a soft, fond look. "No," John agreed. "But you deserve better. So I was thinking ... we should have a do-over. A proper wedding ceremony. Invite our friends, and your parents, have a cake or something and make a lovely day of it. Something worth remembering. Because I want to remember it, Sherlock. I want to remember sliding a ring onto your finger and making my vows and hearing yours. I want to have a ring on my hand and I want you to be the one who puts it there, and I want everyone who matters to us to see you do it." He took a breath and looked directly into Sherlock's eyes. "Sherlock Holmes ... will you marry me again?"
"Thank you," John said. "For ... well, everything really. Looking after me."
"John?"
God, he was still shaking. He couldn't even tell if it was due to the cold water or the after-effects of falling apart so spectacularly.
Sherlock smirked. "You mean the one where we pretend we're not shagging at every given opportunity?"
"Excuse me?"
"Means we're looking at two victims," Lestrade said gruffly, shaking his head. "Bloody hell."
"Yes, John, I am well aware. My own mother is only allowed in the kitchen under strict supervision and is not allowed to carry out tasks that go beyond peeling potatoes. However, I do fully trust in your ability to find someone capable of cooking a decent meal in your long row of girlfriends."
"It's the mating bond," John explained, rubbing a hand over his face. "It makes me irrational. It will pass - it's just the first couple of days. All I want is to have you to myself, to keep you away from anyone else."
John smiled. "It's a great shot, Sherlock. That one can definitely go on the mantle - and that one, too," he added when Sherlock flipped to the next picture.
"You can patronise me later, just shut up and listen. This is an emergency. There's been an accident at the lab. I need one of your cars at Baskerville ASAP, and possibly a vet. Your brilliant scientists just turned John into a dog."
The argument sounded flimsy even in his own head.
"You seem to take a large interest in my life," he noted.
John chuckled. "He is in some situations. Once he's done catching all of London's criminals, he can set up shop as a wedding planner."
"By kissing me," John said flatly.
"Is... is that really why you left?" John asked. "That letter?"
Sherlock blinks at him, clearly incomprehending, which is rare enough.
Sherlock shook his head and took half a step backwards.
*****
He was home.
A moment later, his eyes flew open.
Sherlock shifted closer with hardly any hesitation whatsoever and a moment later they were pressed together from head to toe and Sherlock's arms wrapped around him, holding on tight.
"Why would you do that?" he asked again, staring down at the unconscious Psy. "Why on earth would you kiss me?"
"Both, I think," Molly sighs. "Not that it matters now."
He knew it was a rather pointless offer, seeing as Mycroft could probably have the machine read-outs sent to his phone or something if he wanted to, but the man nodded anyway and left with one last glance at his brother.
The look of bliss on his face as John fed him a piece of the Black Forest gateau Mrs Hudson had baked for them.
Silence.
When she turns it on, it becomes immediately obvious that it has been heavily doctored.
He tried not to think about it too much. There were some images he did not want in his head for the sake of his peace of mind, but this was much better than waiting until Sherlock cracked on his own and gave in to the demands of his transport with John right there to listen and smell the after-effects.
How would he have reacted then? Would he have shrugged and written it off as Sherlock being sentimental? Would he have realised what it was Sherlock was actually saying?
“Good day?” he asked.
He paused and threw his hands up in exasperation.
"Quite right," Sherlock agreed, an amused glint in his eye. "Did everything I told him to."
He pulled Sherlock back gently, even though he knew that the worst Sherlock could do on this hill was roll down it like a child on a sugar rush and get his clothes dirty.
He turned his head closer to Sherlock, his nose brushing against the heavy wool of the Belstaff. Without even thinking about it, John took a breath.
Wrapped in a neat bow is a box of chocolates. She frowns, and pulls it out. Her frown turns into a smile.
With three races as different as changelings, humans and Psy, the law had to be adjusted and the general rule was that the law of the victim's race applied. To avoid arguments, any humans mated into changeling packs fell under changeling law.
Sally glances at Lestrade. They both look at Holmes.
"John? John! Can you hear me? John."
Sherlock did, reluctantly letting go of John's cock and slotting their hips together instead.
The changelings exchanged a glance and then turned as one towards a distraught female who had to be held back by several of her peers to prevent her from climbing after the cub. The mother, no doubt.
He hardly knew what he was going to feel next, let alone how he was going to react to it. It was only logical to assume that someone infinitely more familiar with emotion would be in a better position to make an estimated guess.
"You do know you have a perfectly suitable real bed upstairs, don't you?" Sherlock asked.
"You will need to let me past your shields," Judd told Sherlock again. "It will be difficult and your every instinct will fight you on this. Do try not to attack me."
*****
And where did that leave them now, with John petitioning for a divorce? It wasn't as if he wanted to get away from Sherlock - not anymore. But, well, he couldn't marry Mary if he was already married to someone else. The government frowned on polygamy.
"I'm sorry," he repeated, wishing it was enough. Wishing it could somehow undo all of this, make them both forget about it all.
"Because humans are boring!" the Psy shouted. An unexpected reaction and Sherlock just barely managed to stop himself from flinching away. "Changelings at least present a challenge with their natural shields. But you ..." He stared at Sherlock with evil delight. "You are the true challenge. Who would have thought you would have that many shields? I've seen Councillors with less."
"So what happened then?" John asked. "You must have thought I was crazy."
"Your parents will have a fit when they hear," Haley said.
He stretched out on the worn carpet in front of the fireplace and put his head down between his paws, his eyes fixed on the two Psy.
Sherlock flinched. "Why would I do any such thing? The point was to see if you would remember what happened. I would have been perfectly fine enjoying a normal day with you."
There was something hesitant yet hopeful in his voice that made John's heart clench.
With the state of mind John was currently in, Sherlock really didn’t want to have to explain to him that he had shown up at the Landmark with fresh stitches and bandages all over his back. John had already gotten enough news to turn his world on its head this week. There was no need to add more guilt for something beyond his control to the pile.
"Bullshit. The only reason you even left was to save me and Lestrade and Mrs Hudson."
They passed two hours in quiet conversation about everything and nothing, interspersed with companionable silence and John forcing Sherlock to have some of the tea. Not the mulled wine; they could save that for later.
No, this was going to be him shouting to the world that he was present and available and then he would just have to hope that John got the message and ran with it.
"And did you believe her?" Sherlock demanded.
And then he stepped into the bathroom, still out of breath from his mad dash up the stairs. "Shit. Sherlock? Can you hear me?"
Someone said: "Johnny! Sit!"
Sally grins. "We could put up some mistle toe, distract Mary for a while and lure John into the flat alone."
"Oh," Sherlock made. "I ... see."
He'd been half-hard all day and the mere thought of getting relief, finally,
It was as open and honest as John had ever heard him, and he knew a lot depended on his reaction.
The changelings shared a long, loaded look.
John turned his head and blinked at him. He had quite a couple of suggestions, actually, but rather suspected that Sherlock wouldn't like any of them.
"You buy the same things every week on this day," Holmes says. "It was the least I could do, seeing as I am already taking up so much of your evening."
“Let’s not get in their way,” John merely said when Sherlock hesitated. “You know where everything belongs, boys. Probably better than I do, actually.”
He decided to allow Lestrade the distraction. It wouldn’t do to try and get information out of him without John present. John had a right to be the first person to learn anything concerning the case.
John let that sink in to marinate along with all the other thoughts about Sherlock that had begun to resurface since his return from the not-quite-as-dead-as-assumed.
For once, John's response was neither surprised nor sarcastic. "Yes."
John froze halfway through the door. "Excuse me?"
"There we are," he said, shoving the door open with his foot and turning to face Sherlock so he could help him take off his coat.
John hadn’t made a noise but Sherlock wasn’t stupid enough to assume his friend was asleep. He had wanted to go in, to comfort him somehow. He had never been good at this sort of thing but it was the thing that was done, yes? And he would do anything for John. Providing comfort could hardly be considered a hardship. He could always google ways to do it before applying himself to the task.
"Do what? Go for a run? You need to get out of the city every now and then, John. Stretch your legs a litt-"
Sherlock toes out of his wet shoes and slouches off towards the bathroom, trailing drops of water after him. He sheds his suit jacket on the way and John tries not to stare at his white, now translucent shirt or the way it clings to his back.
No. If there was no way to have all of Sherlock - gorgeous body
"From what I gathered, they didn't want to waste the stag night," Sally says. "I didn't even know Holmes was organising one."
There was no reply and he glanced up again to see a myriad of expressions flickering across John's face.
"I was waiting for you to say something like that," John sighed. "This investigation has been far too tame for your standards so far. We've only gone snooping around in the middle of the night once."
He was thinking of the army as he realized that never before in a sexual situation had he found himself feeling so...conquering.  The masculine essence of the act increased for him when the body under his was masculine.  Making a man make those sounds, those low, rumbling erotic sounds,  was inspirational.  Sherlock's long arms around him meant they were so very close as they rutted against each other and a tiny bit of John's mind that wasn't in thrall to the sensation was wondering if he could stop and deal with a condom, could....
“I did it! Dumbledore’s gonna be in prison for the rest of his life!” he exclaimed, before passing out on the carpet.
"And that’s where …"
(See the end of the chapter for
much of the night reading and practising occulemency. While he was unsure how effective he would be, when morning rolled around, he had all but mastered putting up walls around his mind. Having spent his whole life learning how to organise his thoughts and keep track of just about every single one, simply blocking them out was pretty easy. He had complete control over his mind, something unbelievably useful when it came to occulemency.
"I'll leave this one up to you, Lestrade," Sherlock said, a smirk finding its way onto his face. He then went into the cupboard and looked at the small, black-haired boy who was crying more than ever.
"Canticum." The room was once again filled with soft music and the three-headed dog that had been growling at him plopped down on the ground and started snoring. Luckily for Harry, he missed the trapdoor and Harry was able to open it and peer into the darkness.
Harry forgot all about the pub as he stared at the bustling street in front of them.
"Th-the what?" stammered Sherlock, his face paling.
The song ended and the hall was filled with applause. Harry felt some of the nervousness leave him. He just had to try on a hat! Though harry would rather not have something poking around in his mind, he much preferred this over being tested. Slytherin and Ravenclaw definitely sounded best.
Must pay most dearly in their turn.
"Hello, Mycroft. Do you have any real information to give me this time? Okay, I suppose that makes sense. We'll be right over." He hung up. "Mycroft has offered to let us stay in his manor to wait for the situation to clear up. Usually, I would refuse, but these are very different circumstances." John and Harry nodded, then the three of them repacked what was scattered around the rooms.
"Well," said Hagrid, "We need to buy your school supplies tomorrow, so I'll just stay overnight, if that's okay?" He raised an eyebrow at Sherlock who nodded. Then the four of them went their separate ways, Harry, John and Sherlock back to their rooms, Hagrid to the nearest sofa. It sank down slightly as he sat down. He sighed and pulled his coat closer around himself. There was something strange about Harry, Hagrid thought, he's going to do incredible things.
"Would you really do that?" asked Harry
“Fawn V!” groaned Dumbledore, his voice filled with pain and shaking in fear. Fawn like the one from my dream? thought Harry. He stood up and paced around the office, the professor still lying in pain.
“I don’t blame you, but I don’t think I forgive you yet. I want to, but I don’t think I can.” Harry took a step back from Draco and nodded.
"Ah, the latest edition to the vault. You have a good eye," said Griphook as he looked at the gun. Harry unzipped his hoodie, revealing a shoulder holster with a far newer handgun. He switched out the holster for the one that fit the revolver then looked around for a second before finding a box of bullets. He loaded the gun with a practised hand then holstered it. He left his old gun on the shelf and zipped his hoodie back up.
The receptionist hurriedly gave Lestrade a key and the room number before everyone sprinted up the stairs. As they neared the hallway of Dumbledore’s room, Harry cast a spell to detect wards and disabled every one he came across.
Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
None of you should be surprised by how long this took.
"I was talking to a new friend," Draco replied. His parents' faces softened.
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.
“I know that,” snapped Harry, louder than he had intended.
"Where do you want to go?" The taxi driver asked him.
Mrs Hudson decided that the best way to spend the day was to go to the London Eye. The queue was long and the city centre was packed with people, but Mrs Hudson did the easy thing. She accentuated her limp and put on a pained expression. People let her pass quickly and the two of them got to the front of the line in a few minutes.
“So now all we have to do is figure out who’s gonna steal it,” said Harry.
“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this morning.” A young man with a pimply face and a purple uniform was leaning out of the back of the bus.
McGonagall reached the door she was walking towards and ushered the first-years inside. It was a rather small room and all the students were standing rather too close for comfort. They were muttering and giggling, as children often did, only stopping when McGonagall started to talk.
"Thanks for the tea, Harry," said Sherlock.
This continued for around seven years, then Sherlock proposed. John, of course, said yes. Everyone was in high spirits as the wedding was planned. It was a glorious occasion. There were only around thirty guests, as neither John nor Sherlock had many friends, but they didn't mind. Harry was so happy to finally see his dads getting married. It had been years since he'd called either by their names and was excited that they were both going to be his legal fathers.
"Do you guys know who Nicolas Flamel is?" he asked his friends. They shook their heads. Harry was sure he had heard the name before, but he couldn't remember where. He racked his brains, but came up with nothing.
Even with this position, there was little he discovered about Harry Potter. All he could find out about was that his parents, James Potter and Lily Evans, died in mysterious circumstances in a place called Godric's Hollow. There was no record of them going to school or having jobs.
“And you’re sure John and Sherlock won't mind us staying?” asked Hermione for the hundredth time.
Sorry, but I think you have the wrong Harry. I don’t have a dad, and I don’t know anyone called Sherlock.
"We need to interrogate one of the goblins. I think I know one who would talk." And with that, Harry sprinted from the hall, running all through the castle until finally arriving in the owlery. He grabbed a pen and a piece of parchment that was in one of his pockets and wrote out a short letter to Griphook. Then he called over Hedwig and tied the letter to her leg. The owl then flew from the room, soaring over the grounds. Harry watched her leave, then turned to go.
Sherlock and John looked at each other.
“Right. Lestrade, I’ll help you with the paperwork, Harry, you start writing down how to organise the court, Professor, could you please figure out a way to get evidence, and John, please try not to kill anyone,” said Sherlock, already with a hand on John’s arm. Everyone nodded and went to complete their tasks, all while Dumbledore sat silently in his cell.
"I suppose it makes sense. I've done some strange things that I always put down to circumstance, but I suppose it could be magic," Harry said.
"That bloody kid," said John. They shared an awkward laugh, then relaxed slightly. "So," said John, "Was he right?" Sherlock sat silently for a moment.
Bring back what we’ve forgot,
Around an hour later, Hagrid, Sherlock, and John were standing in the foyer, arguing with Hagrid.
"I wouldn't call a three-headed dog awesome," said Draco.
"Welcome!" he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
“And we’ll probably go on a case or something,” said Harry, smiling as the twins’ faces lit up with child-like glee.
Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. "I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr Holmes. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather – just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother – why, its brother gave you that scar." Harry swallowed. "Yes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember … I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter … After all, He Who Must Not Be Named did great things – terrible, yes, but great."
"Maybe muggles aren't so bad," said Draco a long while later. Harry smiled at him, glad that his new friend was seeing sense.
“Just a few simple things. I’ll know them when I see them,” she replied. Harry nodded.
"Yes he does," said McGonagall, pulling a small golden key from her cloak. She handed it to the goblin who examined it for a moment before nodding in approval.
The weeks went by without any sort of disturbance, so as the Christmas holidays drew nearer, Harry had no issue leaving the school, to see his family again. Sherlock and John were just as excited, and the three Holmes couldn’t wait.
"Well, he won't dare bother me again," said Harry as he began walking back to the Slytherin common room.
“I just can’t sleep anymore,” said Harry, falling into step beside Hermione as they walked to their first class. “The dreams are too weird. I honestly prefer this to what I see.” Harry shivered slightly, closing his eyes as dozens of dead bodies filled his mind. He shook his head slightly and did his best to push the images to the dark depths of his memory.
"You've trained it to expect pain when it hears the clankers," said Harry softly, looking into the dragon's pale eyes that were sunken deep into its scarred face.
"What're those things pulling the carriages?" he asked Draco.
Once he had climbed the many stairs out of the dungeons and into the entrance hall, Hedwig took off from his shoulder and flew out of one of the windows. Harry watched her fly off, admiring her pure white feathers against the blue sky.
"Oh. Well then, Harry Holmes, I assume you've heard of Hogwarts." Harry nodded. "Would I be able to come in?" Harry nodded again and unchained the door, allowing the professor into the house.
When the evening came, Sherlock and John were dressed their best, both trying very hard not to blush.
“I feel like this isn’t legal,” said John from the back of the room.
"Everyone in?" asked Hagrid, who was sitting in his own boat at the head of the fleet. When there were a few weak replies, Hagrid nodded and adjusted his seating. "Right then - FORWARD!"
A week later, after being prescribed countless sleeping draughts that did nothing, Harry received a letter. It was unusual, written on printer paper in ballpoint. Harry slowly opened the letter, looking at the familiar handwriting, wishing he could place it.
“It’s just here,” said the client, fumbling with her keys as she climbed up the stairs of the nearest house. She managed to unlock the door after a few tries and it slowly creaked open.
"You too, John," he replied. Mrs Hudson tutted and ushered them out of the door into a waiting taxi. They drove off into the night. Mrs Hudson turned to Harry.
None of the ten or so students working in the common room looked up as he walked through the room and into his dormitory. He flopped onto his bed and picked up a book, absently flicking through the pages. It took only a few minutes for him to get bored.
"But it doesn't make sense. There's no such thing as magic. It can all be put down to coincidence," said Sherlock.
"I'm going to adopt him, of course." The tall man then walked to the side of the road and hailed a taxi.
"Lumos," he whispered, holding up his now lit wand as he stepped into the stone corridor.
With that, he turned, marching away from potions and up. Draco chased after him, calling his name, trying to catch up, but Harry was pissed.
"You must be Mr Holmes," said McGonagall to Sherlock. Sherlock nodded.
"You've never met Sherlock or John. I would know if you had."
"We have an issue. We have reason to believe that Harry is being stalked, and it has escalated quite considerably." Lestrade sat up instantly. He looked at the worried faces of John and Sherlock and swore silently.
Draco must've seen his face as he began talking all about what he hoped would happen at school. Harry was glad for the distraction and the two of them talked until all meals were finished and desert had come and gone. There was a ghost hovering over the pair for most of the meal. He was covered in silver blood and chains, but he didn't say anything, just watched with cold, dead eyes.
Cowering in the back of the cave was a massive white dragon covered in scars. It raised its tattered wings weakly before retreating even further. There was a bloodied chain wrapped around its neck and manacles keeping it firmly in place. Even though it was a terrifying creature, the sight of it made Harry so sad. It retreated back further and further until it was attempting to climb the wall. It was trying to get away from the noise, or rather what it associated with it.
So teach us things worth knowing,
"Perhaps. I think we might need a bit more information first. I don't want you to be in any danger," answered Sherlock. Harry and Hagrid nodded.
Once he was out in the hallway, he bumped into a breathless Draco and Hermione.
"What's Dumbledore like?" Harry asked Draco. Draco held up his finger and quickly swallowed the chocolate in his mouth before answering.
“Are your headaches getting worse?” asked Hermione a few minutes later as she left the great hall. Harry looked up at her, bloodshot eyes and sunken features. “And the nightmares?” She looked at him, pity clear on her face.
“Maybe, but I’m not taking that chance. Fred, George, Hermione, Draco, could you please take a taxi home?” Sherlock chucked his wallet to Harry who caught it before storming out angrily, his friends close behind.
"I am so sorry," said Draco quickly. Harry laughed and picked them up off the ground, repairing them.
Their daring, nerve and chivalry
Those cunning folk use any means
Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
to anyone reading this, i apologise, but it's not like the story was ever gonna get better
"Well," said Harry, "We've got to start somewhere."
Will always find their kind;
A few loud bangs and a lot of falling over later, the five students had reached their destination. They clambered out of the bus as fast as they could, all of them relieved to be on stable ground again.
"No, he's not. His name is Harry Holmes, and you are going to leave our son alone." John started walking faster towards the door, as did McGonagall.
"Right, I am making a new rule, one shot of coffee a day. No matter what. Okay, Harry?" John sounded sterner than usual. He was on edge because of the letters, thought Harry.
"You'll see them in the holidays," said Draco in an attempt to comfort him.
There was another boom, shaking the floor they were standing on. Sherlock grabbed his gun from inside his jacket and raised it at the door. It was hit another time and Harry saw cracks forming in the surface. He could see that it would only take two more hits of the same force before it was broken open.
When they finally came back down, Harry was filled with energy. He ran all around the square, Mrs Hudson doing her best to follow him. She lost sight of him for a minute and panicked before finding him staring at the sign for the aquarium.
"Why were you running?"
"It's almost as if people with a certain amount of power don't have to abide by the law," said Hermione sarcastically.
"After what your father did to me, how could I not?" replied Snape, anger radiating off of him.
All was going fairly well until there was a loud hissing and someone cried out. Harry looked past Snape, who was currently telling the whole class how perfectly Draco had stewed his horned slugs. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob. The potion was spreading across the stone floor, burning holes in peoples' shoes if they couldn't climb on top of their stools fast enough.
“We should go. My dads’ll be home soon,” he said, walking back to the Leaky Cauldron. Everyone followed after him and arrived back at the flat only a few minutes before John and Sherlock. Everyone rushed up to Harry’s room and picked up various books to make themselves look busy.
"Holmes," he said sharply. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
"So you're Harry Potter," said a small voice in his head.
"Do you want to go back to London already?" he said, opening the train door. Harry and Hermione smiled, then Harry shoved his book back into his trunk and quickly pulled a robe on, hoping no-one would notice it wasn't the full uniform. Then he closed the trunk and locked it with a spell before jumping out of the train to join his friends.
Harry gave the note to the owl and it flew off, back to whoever sent it.
"Start shaking them," said Griphook as the group rounded a corner. They entered a massive cave that was almost completely black other than a large white mound in the corner. It took a few seconds for Harry to fully comprehend what he was looking at. It made him stop in his tracks.
At long last, the weekend arrived. Harry spent the entirety of Saturday morning sleeping. When he finally did get up, he spent the rest of the day reading and doing homework. Finally, he decided to find out some of the castle's secrets. After dinner was over, he started with the most obvious place, the third-floor corridor.
"I think so," answered Fred.
"Hiya, Mr Watson. Where did you serve?" John looked quite surprised at the question. Harry smiled.
"You head down, we'll be with you soon." Harry nodded and pulled on a hoodie, then ran down to the dining hall.
Griphook.
“Well, there’s a tracking potion I can make if we go to Diagon Alley, and Harry’s the Boy Who Lived,” said Hermione.
"Sure," said Harry, examining the card and locking the information into a new room in his mind palace, this one purely devoted to Dumbledore. Harry had a feeling that there was a lot to learn about his headmaster, and that quite a lot of it would be things the man would rather not become public knowledge.
Of finding more than treasure there.
Harry woke to the sun streaming down on his face. He scrunched his eyes and turned over, wishing he'd stayed awake long enough to close the bed curtains the night before.
"You're pretty cool," said Draco. Harry smiled at him, then began looking for anything that could indicate a secret. He found one pretty quickly. Half-covered by the dog's massive body was a trapdoor. Draco and Harry tried to push the dog off, but it was too heavy.
“Yes you do,” said McGonagall, flicking her wand. A piece of paper appeared in her hand and she gave it to a stunned looking Lestrade.
