“I love you, you know,” John whispers into the dark. He can barely see Sherlock, just the thick wave of his salt and pepper hair against his face, the glimmer of moonlight against the milk white skin of his nape. “I love you so much I can’t see straight sometimes.”
"Oh." Sherlock looks as if John's just asked him to change the channel on the telly. Though John knows that actually means he's panicking internally, that his heart is racing and he can't form thoughts. His hand has stopped its leisurely kneading of John's spine. He blinks rapidly, and John knows he's trying to process what John's just said.
“Please, please, baby, I want, can I…” Sherlock’s never called anyone baby in his life, but it feels right, it just slips out, and John smiles slowly and crookedly as Sherlock runs his finger lightly over the crease of John's arse.
“Ha, minion. No. Just...uh...I don’t know what to call me really. I just know him, and we uh...got into some trouble, together, well, he got me into trouble and then got me out of some trouble...but now it’s...I better tell you when you get here.” John could almost hear the guy squirming.
Mycroft’s voice drops to a barely there whisper, his eyes deadly serious. “And you know the last time people were disappearing in this manner.”
, and he can trust John with every part of him - even the messy, ugly, ridiculous, overgrown pigeon parts of him. He’s been holding himself back from John for so long, and suddenly, it’s all fallen away. He can
"John, I assure you I'm not judging you. I'm simply trying to extract maximum information, and understand the nature of what you thought you'd be doing in America."
“Ah. Well then.” Greg turns and grins at Sally, who’s standing with her arms crossed, though even her mouth is ticked up at the corners. “I guess we’ll just let the bomb boys do their clean up work dismantling and such. I think you two can, um, go home.”
“...like it kind of rough.” Sherlock whispers, licking his own lips. He’s known this about John, long before he was the one in John’s bed. Yesterday John was holding back, because it was their first time, because he was emotional, because he didn’t want to alarm Sherlock, but Sherlock had said he wanted it hard, hadn’t he? And now John is pressing further, seeing how far Sherlock will let him take this, feeling out the edges of this new
“I wanted you yesterday, the minute I saw you, I wanted...oh god, Sherlock...Sherlock…” He’s gasping, pulling at Sherlock’s hair so hard it hurts, his voice gone rough.
“What a gentleman, Watson,” Rose smirks, and kicks him in the shin as she sits down. “I could have done that myself, you know.”
“Promise. I’ll behave.” John’s eyes twinkled, the curl of his lip so endearingly familiar that Sherlock was entirely disarmed.
"I said." Sherlock pulls back, nudging his nose against John's, "I said, I want you. I want you, too. I want all those things, too, John. I do. I always have."
They stare at each other a moment longer, and then - not knowing what else to do - Sherlock puts the tube in John’s hand and closes his fingers around it. John tucks it into the waistband pocket and steps toward the door.
John didn't say anything. Sherlock raised his head and looked up. John's eyes were closed, his lips trembling in a sad smile, tears running down his cheeks. His hand pushed gently at Sherlock’s head, easing it back down against his stomach.
John allows him talk for a solid twenty or thirty minutes without interruption, until Sherlock pauses for a breath, right in the middle of telling John about the recent boom in urban rooftop beehives and the medicinal uses of honey and bee pollen.
Sherlock turns to him, tears of pain and frustration trembling on his eyelashes. “I can’t, John. I can’t. I don’t know how to make this work.”
Sherlock had said he wasn’t interested in anyone like that, said it that first night, when John was so obviously testing the waters. So John had backed off. Allowed Sherlock to sabotage any chance he had at a relationship with anyone else, while he knew damn well he would never be allowed to love Sherlock the way he wanted to. By the time they’d known each other less than two years, John had realised he could never be parted from Sherlock.
“It’s just.” John clears his throat, stretches his hand out flat against Sherlock’s sternum and idly runs his fingertip through the sparse dark hairs there. “You - loving you - missing you - you’re the only thing about me that never changed. When I couldn’t even get out of the fucking bed, when I was too damned drunk to stand...you were still in there somewhere. It drove me
an amateur. We are though - well, Sherlock is. I guess I rather hang around and get in the way, right, Sherlock?”
Sherlock picked up John's arm, laying across his stomach, and tapped his fingers along the edges of the bandage. He sighed, interlaced his fingers with John's, and laid their entwined hands back on his belly. "We have a very complicated dynamic, John."
"What?" John's chuckling as he pushes up off the bed, leaving Sherlock's back cold where his warmth had been.
They sit side by side on the sofa, slurping noodles and watching a rerun of Top Gear. It's almost perfect.
Sherlock gets to the The Diogenes and is shown into Mycroft’s office in silence. He knocks on the door and waits for Mycroft in allow him into the room. He hated this lore, having to be welcomed into places, why couldn’t he just go whenever he liked like normal humans. It would be so much easier.
Sherlock moans at the touch. “You’re going to make me come my pants if you keep that up.” He whimpers.
John nods. “Thank you, Father. I appreciate that. I’ll just be a while longer finishing up praying to her most cherished stations.” He hums, watching the priest go.
Sherlock's tongue slides across his lips and he parts them, letting it dip inside him. Their first breach of two becoming one. Sherlock gently teases and explores John’s mouth with his tongue, his fingers finding their way to John’s hair and pulling just enough to make him groan. He holds John’s hip in his other hand and rocks his hips up against John’s. He can feel John’s slick starting to dampen his pants.
"You're going to get me pregnant aren't you? I know how you look at the pregnant women who come into work. How you want to be the one to knock them up. To be the father."
“Oh Mycroft.” Anthea tears up and holds onto him tightly or as tightly as he weakened body will let her.
John growls back and fights for dominance, adding another finger into Collin, making him four fingers full.
Sherlock comes downstairs, smiling brightly when he sees Jason. He wraps his arms around him, pulling him close.
She moans and opens her mouth for her, holding her close. She blushes and mewls as she rubs her belly.
“Nice. You’re lips were plump and soft just like they look.” John says rubbing Sherlock’s hips and tips of his thighs absentmindedly, blushing brightly when he realizes what came out of his mouth.
Maggie opens the door with her magic and walks in, carrying a tray full of breakfast foods. “Mornin’, boys.”
One containing letters written by his parents. Another for the questions his dad wrote down, and their answers, which were easily spotted by the number circled in the top corner. The third folder contained anything else they'd found. Newspaper clippings, copies of bonding certificates and reports, and letters written by other people
“See how desperate he is? Absolutely gagging for more cock. Go do something about that.” Violet smirks.
Molly grits her teeth against another contraction as the pull up at the hospital. "Argh... oh my...!"
John smiles. "You might want to talk to Sky once she's come back to herself. She's having a hard time at the moment." He hums.
Anthea giggles but Mycroft groans and his hands drift up to Harry's thighs. She looks down at him and smiles, seeing the want and desire in his face.
“Perfect sense.” Sherlock nods, cuddling into John. He could spend the rest of his life like this and be perfectly content and happy.
Mycroft made sure to put a little thank you bonus in Anthea's bank account. She was a good sort, and loyal, even if she did eavesdrop.
“Love it. So much.” Sky whines, her tits bouncing as he pounds her. She strokes his cock through her stomach.
"Just a bug, love." John says after spitting into the sink and washing the toothpaste down the drain. "Probably got it from one of the kids at my aunts."
“John, if you’re about to tell me the dog’s writing you notes, I may have to check you into the hospital.”
Mycroft chuckles. "I’d prefer to spend time with you too, Gregory." He murmured. "Unfortunately, the London underworld and paperwork won't look after themselves." He sighed.
“You should also look and see if there are samples of John’s parents' DNA on file. We need a larger pool to sample from. We need to find others. Others with soulmate bonds. If we have any hope of figuring this out we need more data. We also need to look into folk and fairy tales. Especially those perpetuated by omegas. We need more omega input. They’re the key. Omegas are the key.” He resists licking John’s belly but only just. He’s not sure if he’s making any sense but that doesn’t really matter to him since he can smell his
Greg makes a choked sobbing sound and holds him tightly. "I'm sorry. I'm so so sorry. I'll die before I let anything ever happen to you again."
Sherlock smiles. “You’re going to have to help me remember everyone, especially now I’m full of babies.” He chuckles. “I’m hungry John, when will this feast begin?” He whines.
“You should have known better than to lash out. Than to take matters into your own hands. It is not your place to make any call. Every decision comes to me. I make the decisions. I make sure our kind is safe. You could have exposed us to the world and we all would have had to go into hiding. How dare you risk your brothers and sisters so selfishly?” Camille sighs and shakes her head. “Weak. You are weak.”
He growls. "I'll fill you with so much cum, you'll be drowning in it." He thrusts harder and faster, his cock catching on her cervix with each thrust.
"He came back and started touching my.." Sky waves a hand over her chest. "I told him to stop and he ripped my dress so I knocked him out." She looks terribly embarrassed and ashamed as she holds her dress up to cover herself.
Sherlock gets up and sits between John’s legs. He rests his head on John’s belly and looks up at him, letting out a soft sigh.
He wraps his arm around him and kisses his head. After everyone's finishes eating Amelia and Carol take the empty dishes to the kitchen. Collin takes Danny out to the sitting room and sits him on his blanket surrounded by his toys. Sky and George go to the door when the bell rings. "Иван! рад видеть тебя!" Sky says speaking in fluent Russian, 'Ivan! It's good to see you!'. "Небо, как сексуально, как в последний раз я видел вас." Ivan says and smirks, 'Sky, just as sexy as the last time I saw you'.
Sherlock relaxes a bit. “Alright.” He nods. “I also want to get her counseling and therapy. Anthea has a list of approved beta and omega professionals that you and your mother can go through when she’s ready.”
Turk bites his lip and looks to Sky. "Tell him." Sky nods. "The Council is made up I people like me and Sky. They oversee the handling of others with abilities. Making sure they don't get used and a abused. Basically it's like watch dog for people with powers. Is.. Is she dead?" Turk asks and Sky shakes her head.
“We’ll have to cut through. There are old cut branches that have healed and regrown.” Sherlock nods.
Jim walks over to a crate set to the side of his set up and opens the lid. He pulls out a bullwhip and an iron bar. "Which first? Any preferences?"
"What do you think? That's the sweeter sauce because I know you like things sweeter. I also made a spicy one because I like the kick." She smiles.
Instead of a bed there's a chair that reminds John of a dentist's chair. Pointing to if he asks, "Want me there? Or..."
“There are some things I can control. Like sudden sounds or smells. Or someone’s voice. Or shoes. Shoes are the worst for some reason.” Sherlock downs the rest of his wine. “I’m glad yours are better.”
“I don’t know if I want her to sleep with us. I don’t like sharing you,” John pouts. “ when you’re being surprisingly dirty,” he teases and gives Sherlock a kiss on his cheek.
Right, that's enough about my balls. Don't read that bit to Rosie? Please? Tell her daddy was talking about grown-up stuff.
“We’re having to be very careful with what Sherlock does and doesn’t do because at this moment there are people watching Mrs. Hudson and DI Lestrade who work for Jim.” Anthea sighs. “Ever since you killed Jim’s cabbie he’s been obsessed with Sherlock and how his mind works. He thinks they’re soulmates, not you and Sherlock. He thinks they’re the same because Sherlock can solve his puzzles. We’re trying to find all the ends of the web before we start pulling on the strands.”
"Let's do that tomorrow. I have a better idea. You said you'd touch me after my heat is over. Well, it's over."
“You’re the only one I want to come in.” Dominic smiles, he gently pulls out of Leona and rolls them on their side, wrapping around her. “I can’t believe you’re pregnant again.”
"Do whatever you want. It's nothing compared to what Sebastian is going to have done to me. If you kill me you would be doing me a fucking favor." He snaps.
“When you next go to sleep.” John says softly. “In the morning you’ll have a little bump, it won’t be the kids, but everything your body needs to grow them.” He says softly.
He blushes and whimpers. “Please..” He gasps softly against him, pressing closer and rubbing his cock against him.
John smiles and continues to suck on it. He pushes Sherlock to lay down and straddles his hips, pining his hands above his head.
“Passes will help us crack down on vampires who feed from humans without permission. Fails means I don’t have to argue with him.” Camille shrugs.
A man in a suit comes in a few minutes later. "Ma'am there's a... Woman at the door for you.." He says. "Fuck." Sky sighs and nods as the man leaves.
Carol cries out out and comes hard, knowing they wouldn't stop. Collin groans, fucking Sherlock harder and faster.
"Oh..." Sabine seemed to pause to collect herself. "I... I was under the impression that you never wanted to speak to me, ever again." She swallows.
“That’s a lie. About everyone drinking volunteered blood. I saw what your kind does. You should all be murdered.” Greg spits.
"Don't think for a second you were clever enough for me not to find out." John says with a glare, "I saw you two. Thick as thieves whenever he'd come over with a case. I admit, I didn't think much of him when we first met but I suppose you needed an assistant. And since I couldn't fulfill that role, he was the perfect replacement." He snaps, arms falling to his sides, hands fisted till his knuckles turned white. "Was that it? Was he the perfect childless replacement for me? Is that why you did it?" The hurt he's been trying to hide is finally coming to the surface. "Don't deny it, Sherlock. I saw you and Thomas in the hall that night. You were like two cats in heat. And then you had the audacity to actually leave overnight on a case with him not a week later. I'm not stupid, Sherlock. I know you were fucking him."
Morna whines as she gets up like a good little breeding cow, all round and full. She moans as he plays with her breasts, so full and heavy.
She whimpers softly and tries to relax in his arms but she can't. She tenses and pulls away. "I'm sorry." Her voice cracks. "It's not you. It's not. I just can't be touched right now. I'm sorry." She looks down at the floor and trembles a bit.
A few hours later Richardson calls Mycroft and Richardson never calls, only takes his orders and does his job. So calling was alarming to say the least.
Sherlock’s room, now the sixth year boys’ room, is the third door on the left. The honeyed oak door gives a loud creak as he pushes it open, and he flinches, sure he’s woken someone. But no one stirs as he shuts it carefully and tiptoes across the chilly stone floor to his four-poster. Alchemy's sound asleep on his pillow. He moves the rat gently to the side so he can lie down, slips under the heavy quilt and draws the curtains shut, the message from Mycroft still clutched tight in his fist.
." John tugged at his hair again, and Sherlock pulled off with a debauched slurp, his chin and his nose covered in drool and precome. John looked down at him, chest heaving, and traced the outline of his wet mouth with two fingers. "I almost came right in that pretty mouth."
John pushes at the mattress with his feet, climbs onto Sherlock with his knees on either side of Sherlock's hips, not allowing either one of them to break what's become a wet and desperate kiss. Sherlock licks along the curl of John's tongue in his mouth and the sound John makes is like a growl as he rolls his hips, the hot length of him poking into Sherlock's belly. It registers in Sherlock's mind that he really has to stop this now, because they won't be able to stop in just a minute more.
He told me your family was tenacious, there were other family hunters. They were killed off. You were tenacious. You’re a survivor John. If I go back to Mycroft and ask for it back, he will kill me. Do you want me dead for the sake of try, and failing, to get your broach back? -SH
He grips his hips tighter and bites John's thigh next to his face over his shoulder. He thrusts harder and harder being spurred on by John's sounds.
He blushes. “I’ll have to ask Collin for some clothes. I didn’t bring anything other than my panties.”
“You’re more intuitive than you know, love.” Joann smiles softly, holding him close. “Tell me stories? About you and Sherlock.”
Mycroft nods and smiles. “Come on then Kia. You tell me the way.” He says softly, he starts to waddle, holding Kia carefully on his large hip. “You seem younger than you were when we met.”
Mycroft frowns. “I feel a warmth. But... I don’t know Sherlock. I can’t feel your emotions.” He says sadly, “I’m sorry, brother dear.”
Greg's moans grow, rocking his hips a bit into her mouth. "God.. it's fucking incredible.. She'd have to be talented in order to take your huge cock."
“Such a good boy for Daddy.” George smirks and strokes him over his pants, making the wet spot grow.
Mycroft takes his fingers out of himself with a small whimpers. "I-I.. I'm sorry.. I just, I can't.."
Sherlock smiles as he sips from the glass. “I love you John. Really, you’re... I know that you’re my match.” He whispers.
"We have a big week ahead. Everyone goes back to work, Zack starts chemo and his mother is coming, Christmas, and you are staring in Hamlet." She smiles brightly.
“Morna can barely stand. Let alone be vengeful.” Myropis laughs. “She’s let herself go too far this time. But as a show of good will. She can have one of her many, many babies back.” He sneers, as a baby appeared on a ceiling, above one of the walls of fire. The magic holding it there, disappeared and the baby fell.
Mycroft frowns and kisses his cheek softly as he listens to their conversation. Sherlock watches John get up to comfort Greg and follows him.
“Mm. How about when we move here, I’ll fuck you as much as you want for as long as you want to celebrate.”
He sighs as he loses the connection, his mind starting to shut down from lack of sleep and food. Turk frowns. “Where are we going?”
“Mm good. I’ll fuck you however you want. As long as you dump your cum inside her. Deal?” He rubs his prostate gently.
"Who knew shaved heads were so efficient." She giggles and stretches up to kiss him before pulling back to wash her hair.
“No. Not yet. I haven’t told Cecil and Violet yet either. I wanted to make sure he was stable first. Turk has been working on repairing the damage. We can go tell them if you want.”
He blushes and mewls. He's still deep in subspace and his words fail him. He rolls over slowly and burrows to Mycroft's side.
“Of course she is.” Chloe smirks, gathering Mel’s slick on her fingers. “Look how wet she is. I haven’t even put a finger in her yet.” She shows Zack her wet fingers. Mel blushes brightly, slipping deeper and deeper into subspace as they play with her.
“Mm is that right?” He nibbles and sucks at her breasts, ignoring her nipples to tease her. “How many?”
"It's a bit early to drink now, Greg. Besides I think it would be best if you were sober for meeting your biological father for the first time. He'll offer you a drink when we get there." Sky hums as she slides a big beautiful engagement ring from the box. "He has excellent taste." She hums as she looks at the ring.
"I'll go get Lydia and Anthea up. George you go find your daughters and Collin. We'll go get out costumes and masks." She smiles.
Greg let's go of a breath he didn't know he was holding in. He does the rest of the shopping on auto pilot and goes back to the cottage.
Lydia looks at Sherlock's chart and smiles happily. "How are you feeling over all, Sherlock?" She looks up at him smiling.
"Sky is seeing bodies at the Thames. Donovan is about to call me." Greg says as he catches Sky when she sways. "So much blood.." She frowns.
“I thought it would be rude to make you even more pregnant and leave,” Sherlock says softly. “I’m sorry, John. I wish I could be there with you. I.. I keep failing you.”
Dominic chuckles and bites her lip as he come into Leona, moaning loudly into her mouth. He thrusts up, emptying himself into her.
Crystal slowly turns the crank and lifts Mycroft off the ground. She tied his wrist together behind his head and bound his arms so his elbow point up. She has his legs tied so he looks like he’s squatting. She’s perfectly suspended him. “Mm gorgeous.” She smirks.
Greg lays on the floor breathing hard and trembling, his arm thrown over his eyes. Sherlock stares at Greg with wide eyes and jaw dropped. "Amazing.." Sherlock groans.
Sherlock smiled pulling Ryan up against his back, sandwiched between the two men. He could feel Ryan's cock against his ass. He grimaced softly, but ground into Ryan, pretending to come under the effect of whatever had been in the drink.
He strips John of his trousers and pants along with his own. He slots himself between John's legs and grinds them together as he kisses him.
"More. Needs to be bigger. I'm not even getting any milk." He fakes a pout, a smirk hidden behind it.
Once the door to their room is closed John turns around and leans on it. He'd been hit with so many emotions throughout the day. Joy at knowing he'd be seeing his mate, shock and joy when it came to seeing his mother, then the floodgates opened with his dad walking in. Then there was Sherlock, standing in the back with a knowing smile on his face.
John smiles and rests his other hand on top of Sherlock’s stomach. “There’s no sex in the pool, and everyone has to remain decent.” He says softly, “just tell me if you want anything.”
Ryan smiles and puts his arms around the two men. "Let's get out of here..." He says, tugging them toward the door.
"I didn't say anything..." Sherlock smirks against John's lips. He groans at the feel of John's tongue, burying his hands in John's short hair.
Mel drops to her knees in front of her and nuzzles her thighs. “I can see how wet you are, Mummy. Can I have a taste? Please? I know making you feel good with make the babies happy. Don’t you want the babies to be happy?” She purrs and kisses her full belly.
Michael giggles and leans back against him. "Mm, 've always thought y'were handsome. So sexy.. thought you were outta my league."
John wakes up in the night alone. He sighs softly and gets up. He sneaks past the nurses and slips into Sherlock's room. Sherlock is sleeping and John smiles as he sits in his chair by the bed.
“And for the record, you’re not a coward. You’re the bravest man I know. And I love you, Sherlock Holmes. More than life itself.”
"Christ, Mycroft. You're one spoiled man. Spoiled rotten." He growls and rocks his hips as he strokes him faster.
“Mostly crimes against children and if your violent.” She nods. “They didn’t say anything about my past.” She shrugs.
“There’s a hard problem back at my office that I asked for Collin’s help on.” Sam smirks. “Ah I see.” Carol giggles.
“You are drunk and you’re putting us all in danger. You’ve already killed one and now you’ve probably hurt Crystal just because you want a child that was never yours to begin with. We are your children but we have never been enough for you. That’s why you’ve turned so many of us. Because you’re trying to fill a void. Because you’ve decided we are not good enough. We are all casualties in your war against a Lucifer after he used you and left you for dead.” Mycroft frowns. “So go ahead. Kill us all one by one until you are alone again. That’s what you want isn’t it? Because you keep hurting us over and over again. One day there will be no one left and you will be alone.” He whispers. “I love you, Sire. But you’re scaring me..”
Sherlock smiles, “That’s good. I was thinking, maybe, Lydia clearly likes us... and I’ve always wanted a kid.” He whispers.
He blushes and nods, moving to sit next to her. He watches the people as well, his cock stirring curiously.
John, taking his pillows and pushing them under Sherlock's hips, leaned over to open a drawer and pull out a bottle of lube. He looks down at Sherlock and smiles slightly. Putting the lube down, for now, he leans forward and nuzzles the cleft of Sherlock's arse, spreading the cheeks with his hands and blowing warm breath against the man's anus.
Mycroft lay on the pillow, snuggling into Greg's side, slowly and carefully beginning to touch him, mapping with his fingers, learning the man's most intimate areas.
"Sean one two and three," John threatens though the threat is nearly lost in his giggles. "Oi! Your hair is tickling my ear!"
John takes the cake from his mother and sets it aside to cool. He'd ice it later, but for now, he had fruit to chop.
She groans as she grinds her naked self against Morna. She finishes feeding Morna the grapes and kisses her hard. “You’re a good little Queen. You know it’s your job just to let us have our way with you.” She smiles as she opens the second punnet.
Kia smiles. “I want to be good. They’re happy too.” She looks at Sherlock’s belly before sitting his John tells her.
“Alright.” Jason smirks and picks him up. “Bend him over and you can take his arse and I’ll use his mouth? Then switch?” Sherlock smirks. “Why not.” Jason grins.
Sherlock blushes and giggles. “I want to taste my cum in your mouth but I can’t seem to move so you’re going to have to come up here and kiss me.”
"Do you want to see Sherlock and Greg quick before we go?" Lydia signs to John. He nods and follows Mycroft back into Sherlock's room.
“Good good. Her hips did good then.” Margaret smiles and nods, scooping the foal up into her arms and taking it to its mother. Her strengthens quite impressive since the foal was at least forty five kilos. “You eat up while I muck you and you Mummy’s stall.” She smiles and watches the foal eat for a moment before cleaning out the stall.
"Hold him down and show me his neck!" Sky snaps as she fills a syringe with a vial she pulled from her pocket. Lydia holds Sherlock's head back and Sky injects his neck. Sky sighs as Sherlock stops seizing. "Here. Give him a syringe full of this every two hours until the vial is gone." Sky hands the vial to John.
I was dumb and let time slip by me unnoticed. The first week in September I'll be working Boston Comic Con (Wednesday - Sunday) so I'm going to take that week off from fic posting. It's a long drive there and back, and long hours. I'm just going to need the break.
“Yes absolutely. I can do that,” John sighs with relief. He shuffles them both so they are lying the right way and he takes the lead, head on a pillow and pulling Sherlock against him protectively. “This feels so weird, getting to be here on your bed like this.” He grins against Sherlock’s curls, looking about in awe. His hand strokes absently at Sherlock’s shoulder and brushes gently against the edge of the scarring on his back.
John takes ten quid downstairs to Speedy’s and brings back takeaway coffees and two egg sandwiches each. They eat them in the chairs by the fireplace, John automatically taking the hideous flowered armchair and Sherlock curling up in the sprawling leather one. There’s a peace inside him that he’s
John notices his silence as they stop walking in front of a NatWest branch with an ATM in the stone wall outside. “You okay?”
"Um. Alright. My cigarettes are in my coat, I'll just..." Sherlock shrinks around the kitchen doorway and returns with his coat on and his cigarettes in his hand.
Molly Hooper is standing next to him, her eyes merry, her brown hair done up in a messy bun on top of her head. Rose, and Sherlock’s dorm mate Mike Stamford, are hovering by the barrel that serves as the door to the Hufflepuff dormitory. Mike’s chubby and always smiling, excellent at Herbology and rubbish at nearly everything else, but Sherlock’s always liked him. They get on easily, and Mike never seems bothered by Sherlock’s moodiness.
Through his shock and panic, Sherlock reaches out tentatively, winds his fingers under John’s, laying still, so horribly still, on the stretcher. He threads them together, John’s barely responding, just the barest flicker of movement against Sherlock’s hand. He bows his head down to John’s forearm. Sherlock's an atheist. He doesn't believe in god.
I cannot adequately explain the true emotions that John stirred within me when we were locked together in these moments I would never - and had never - shared with any other person. I could only say that the entirety of my body and soul belonged to him, and I wished to be owned in this way for the rest of my life and beyond. Never did I feel more complete than when John took me as his own, claiming me with his mouth and his words and his seed.
“Oh. I didn’t know you smoked.” Sherlock tried to cover his shock, to speak more gently than he normally would. John was so fragile. Sherlock felt it in every glance, saw it in every sad smile, every twitch of his eyelids. There were emotions between them too deep, too unfathomably deep, to even verbalise. They were talking around each other, falling into old patterns.
He can't think of anything else to say, so he depresses the end button. He looks up at the grey streaked black sky, feeling disconnected from everything around him. Surreal. It's all so surreal. Things like this don't happen in real life. It's like a bad detective series from the 1990's, like his parents used to watch on rainy afternoons on the tiny telly in the kitchen.
"Tell me about your shit plan later." John says, his teeth nicking against Sherlock's throat. "Right now I want you just to bloody well do what I tell you. Shut up and get on the bed."
"I know, I know. I am too. I should have, too. Said something. Long time ago." John works his way down Sherlock's neck again, stubble scratching his mouth and his nose, and rubs his hand up and down Sherlock's side.
“Probably didn’t want to cause you more anxiety.” Sherlock says quickly, and douses the end of his sentence in a huge swallow of his drink. He chokes a little, coughs and clears his throat.
Oh fuck, he was really hurting him. He came back to himself, pulled his mouth reluctantly away from Sherlock’s now freely bleeding arm. “Jesus Christ, baby, I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me, fuck. I’m so sorry, love.”
“No, sir. Just up from London on holiday.” John had already assumed that voice he put on when he was trying to blend in, pretend he was just a normal bloke.
The room was desperately hot. John couldn’t get a deep breath, the air was so dry and thick. He fumbled for the call button, fingers clumsy and swollen. He couldn’t make his fingers contract enough to actually press it. Fuck. He needed water, and paracetamol, and food. Oh, god, it was bright. How can eyeballs hurt, he wondered, as he let his eyes fall shut. Because, god, they did.
“Well, sit down then, and stop blocking out the light.” Sherlock’s own voice is jittery, needle thin after more than twelve hours without a fix. His throat’s dry. “You got anything to drink?”
Sherlock kisses John again, just because he can, and also to allow his voice time to stop quivering. “I don’t know. But I missed you.”
“Every day. From now on. I want to start every morning with your wet hair in my face and your damned cold feet slipping all over mine. Sound good to you?” John's heart is full to bursting with the kinds of emotions he's spent years trying to submerge - exuberance, giddiness, joy, lust. He thought he'd have to settle for a beige existence, his moments with Sherlock the only all too brief flashes of colour. Knowing he's going to have this kind of love in his life all the time, this soul deep connection, this wall shaking sex, and everything in between - it's almost too much to fathom.
Take all day. If we want it to." John turns so their chests are flush, too many layers of coat and clothes between them, and trails his finger down Sherlock's neck to the edge of his scarf. "But it doesn't
John closed his lips around the end of Sherlock’s tongue and sucked, and it was Sherlock’s turn to gasp. There was a tightness growing between his legs, and he knew they had to put an end to this, but the tingling in his groin seemed to be making it hard to think rationally. He had wanted this for so long, not dared to dream it would actually happen, that John would want him. The feeling John’s mouth on his own was earth-shakingly intense. John’s lips were so ruined, bloody and scabbed. Sherlock could feel every rope of shredded skin under his tongue. It was the most beautiful feeling. He didn’t think anything about John could ever not be beautiful again.
Scant minutes pass before the room is filled with the sound of Sherlock's quiet snores, and his weight against John's side increases as sleep claims him. John reaches into the bedside drawer, careful not to dislodge Sherlock, and retrieves his book, props his wrist against the rhythmic rise and fall of Sherlock's shoulder, and begins reading.
"Hmm." John furrowed his brow, but he was grinning. He began undoing Sherlock's trousers, unbuckling his belt and rubbing his hands over his hips as he let them fall to the floor. "Okay, love. I'm not really following you, but I guess more John is a good thing?"
“No. I haven’t changed my mind. I want this, very much.” Sherlock closed his eyes, nuzzled into John’s thigh, his hand still methodically stroking over the base of the plug, the fabric of John’s jeans catching it, rocking it. John’s legs were beginning to shake. “It’s just, you know I’m not so good at talking about sentiment. This is...a very sentimental act for me.”
John sighs and settles his weight stretched all along Sherlock's back, his head resting in the curve of Sherlock's neck. His arms drape over Sherlock's waist and he tucks his hands up against his ribs. Sherlock feels John's belly expanding into the small of Sherlock's back with every inhalation, filling the space between them.
“...and that’s how I realised he’d actually been blackmailing the Polish ambassador. After that it was easy. Lestrade and I were just finishing up, and then I couldn’t get a cab, and the tube took a while.” Sherlock looked up at him with bright eyes, his long dark lashes casting shadows on his eyelids in the flickering blue light from the telly. “You weren’t even actually listening to me, were you, John?”
, but that his favourite author was actually Tolkien. He knew the exact shade of blue John's eyes turned when he was about to cry, and that it was four shades darker than when he was laughing. He knew that John had a journal pressed between the mattress and the box spring that Sherlock wasn't supposed to know was there. He knew the taste of John's mouth after his first cup of coffee, and of the back of his neck after a shower. He knew that John loved him in measures and depths that neither of them could begin to understand, and Sherlock saw it every time their eyes met.
John puts his left hand against Sherlock’s hip and pushes up a bit more on his right elbow, licking more forcefully, salt on his tongue. “I have been waiting so long to do this. Jesus Christ.”
“Yeah, come on, Sherlock. It’s Friday night, leave off the homework for a bit, nerd.” Rose smirks at him and nudges the barrel door open with her foot.
“We don’t yet know - though there are theories. There’s much I can’t tell you. I was authorised to get your assistance, but. This is extremely sensitive and classified information.”
“Are you fucking kidding me? We’re fucking criminals, Lester. Smoking in a public building is the least of our problems. Now, fucking hand me my cigarettes.” John shoved himself higher on the bed, rolled his aching neck. As he held his hand out to take the cigarette pack from Lester, he saw how battered he was - his whole forearm purple and black, hands bandaged and swollen, a few fingernails had fallen out. “Jesus fucking Christ.”
John actually felt his mouth tick up marginally. It was the first time a memory of Sherlock didn’t burn. His phone buzzed, and a thrill of anticipation shot through his belly.
She guides him to a wood slatted bench and sits down next to him, crosses her legs and holds out her hand. "You're welcome. I'll take one of those, dear. Not exactly a normal day for me either."
He shuffles off the bed, aching and empty, pours himself a cup of cold coffee and curls in his chair with his knees drawn up to his chest. He pulls a blank notebook, the kind he usually keeps case notes in, off the bookshelf.
The doctor looks at him, eyes sympathetic and soft. “No, son. He’s not dead. He’s got a fairly serious laceration to his liver, lost a large amount of blood. I don’t believe the liver itself will require surgery, but he’ll require almost constant bed rest for the next several days. We've repaired the exterior wound. He's awake. Tired and in some pain, but awake. Give us thirty minutes or so to get him settled in a room and we’ll let you see him, alright?”
Sherlock smiled that smile that only John got to see, almost bashful, his eyes soft and dark behind fluttering lashes. "I know. I feel the same, John."
The body beneath him squirmed and moaned, back bending. He slid his hand up the curve of spine. Not skinny enough, really, to be perfect, but close enough. The hair was right. That was always the most important detail. If the hair was wrong - straight, or not black enough - he just wasn’t interested.
He pulls back enough to aim a seductive glance at Sherlock as his fingertips delve just under the waistband of Sherlock’s trousers. He nibbles at his bottom lip, and looks up through the cage of his lowered lashes to see Sherlock’s cheeks flush a shade darker and his tongue dart out unconsciously to trace his own lips.
"Why don't you reach across me and fucking try it?" This was the way he talked to people now. John Watson, the old John Watson, would never have talked to anyone like this. He supposed it was because he just truly didn't care anymore. About himself. About other people. About anything, really. Not since he'd watched Sherlock falling, coat billowing...No. No. Don't picture it.
feel cold, for godssake. He rolls over, wriggles down into the warm cocoon of blankets around him, feeling as though he’s forgetting to do something important. Still foggy with sleep, he drags his eyes open and picks up his phone from the bedside table.
Sherlock tosses the keys up in the air and catches them, flashes John a dazzling grin and sweeps over to the door. As he disappears inside, John breathes through his nose, wills himself (as he's done so many times he can no longer count) to be calm, and goes inside Speedy's to order the coffees.
“I don’t know. I just know we have an hour until we have to be back in our dorms, and I’d like to spend it with you. If that’s alright?” John’s voice is husky and low, and it sends shivers down Sherlock’s spine.
He set his chin atop John’s head and tightened his embrace. John hummed contentedly and sank more heavily against Sherlock, brought his hands up to hold Sherlock’s forearms. Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, and then thought better of it. Instead he closed his eyes and allowed himself to bask in the warmth of John’s body against his own, the closeness between them.
Sherlock twists and rolls between John's legs, winces as his tingling skin brushes against the bedding. Rivulets of tears cover his face, striations from the sheets pressed into his cheek. His eyes are red rimmed, soft and docile. John leans over and kisses him tenderly, touching the very tip of his tongue to Sherlock's upper lip. "Ready for a bit more?"
He knows Mycroft’s brilliant, and dependable, and certainly as intelligent as Sherlock himself. Maybe more so, in certain areas. Beyond that, he’s Sherlock’s big brother - it’s instinctive for Sherlock to put his trust in him, to believe that he’s right. Except he just can’t be, not this time. There is nothing - nothing - about John Watson that says he could be capable of spying on his friends for ex-Death Eaters. Every molecule of Sherlock’s body is screaming that this is flat out wrong.
Sherlock can taste himself on John’s tongue, salty and bitter. He’s never tasted come before, his own or anyone else’s. He licks at his lower lip, curious.
God. Mrs Hudson. Billy the skull. Sherlock's chem set. Blogging on that ancient laptop. Doctor Who nights that always began with Sherlock grumbling and ended with Sherlock's feet tucked under John's thigh while he tore apart the pseudo science of the episode, as John watched him with affectionate eyes and a hungry heart. Greg's footsteps thundering in the hallway. John wandering into the sitting room in nothing but pants and a dressing gown to find Mycroft sitting prim in Sherlock's chair on a Sunday morning. It all seemed like someone else's life.
Sherlock ducks his head and looks up at John with his bottom lip half in his mouth. "I just wasn't sure..."
“Come ‘ere,” Sherlock hears himself saying, arousal-slurred and low, slipping his hand up onto John’s hip, caressing the curve of his arse, the taut musculature of the back of his thigh.
John slips his fingers out and surreptitiously wipes them on the sheets in the vee of Sherlock’s legs. He nudges Sherlock’s thighs wider with his knee, crawls in between them. “Ready then, love?”
The next Saturday dawned clear and crisp, the sky a brilliant sapphire blue. With a nearly eight hour drive ahead of them, they were loading the rented Ford Galaxy just as the sun broke over the tree line in Regent's Park. John was quiet, contemplative, as he slammed the gate down and tugged at it to make sure the latch had caught.
“Nothing so grand as all that. Just wanna make people feel better. Help them when they’re sick, or - whatever else. My mum - ” John trails off, his eyes fixed ahead of them.
He’s just going to keep talking. He’s just going to apologise until they’re blown to bits, because that’s what Sherlock does. He never bloody shuts up long enough to actually listen to anyone else. He’s going to talk John to death, literally.
Sherlock swallows and swirls the pads of his thumbs in little circles over the heels of John's hands. "Because. Because we just got home yesterday, and you've been -- difficult to predict since we came back, and we've barely had enough time to have a proper conversation and I just -- I think we should just slow down a bit."
"It is not fucking alright, Sherlock. There is absolutely nothing alright about that." John sucks in a breath, and reaches up to touch Sherlock's face. "God, what - what have you gone through? How could I not have - I didn't even ask you."
I let him slip from my mouth and looked up, suddenly aware of how wet my face had become, with saliva and sweat and
“But.” The ball of tension is back, tight and hot and terrible, making Sherlock feel like he’s going to be sick.
God, he would do anything for this not to end - the cuddling, the warmth of John’s body stretched out against his, fingertips tracing lazy lines along his hairline. Now that the initial panic is receding, he really doesn’t give a
." John allows Sherlock to wrap his legs around John's back, and he sits on his heels, pulling Sherlock's arse up onto his thighs. The angle changes and John can actually feel the bump of Sherlock's prostate against the head of his cock. He thrusts up hard, fingers clawing at  Sherlock's waist. "I am going to make you come so hard, just from this. I'm not going to touch you."
“Probably we’re on our own right now. Mostly.” Sherlock looks around, scanning exits, taking stock of the other patrons. “Malvo’s not actually
The kiss was deep and purposeful, his tongue dipping in and out of my mouth rhythmically, mimicking the way he fucked me. A shudder wracked me at the thought, and I felt him smiling against my mouth. He was always so proud of how I responded to him, how visceral was my need. It was true that he rendered me helpless, my brain and all my logic washed away in a flood of chemical reactions over which I had no control. I was most utterly and joyfully at his mercy.
The wind is whipping above them, the canvases cracking and filling the station with echoes. For a moment he thinks John won’t answer, as he stares off into the blackness of the tunnel. But then he clears his throat and rubs his hand over his face, says in a hoarse weary voice. “I was tired of having the shit beat out of me every day.”
John says differently. John likes the smell of Tesco’s, plastic and cleaning fluid and new clothes and packaged food, because he says it reminds him of the first time he did the shopping for the both of them. John likes the heady green smell of grass being cut, because it reminds him of playing rugby when he was a boy. John likes the smell of Sherlock’s neck, musky and sour from sleep, because it reminds him of the first time they woke up in the same bed. Smells are associated with feelings, memories. Smells mean something, they stir the soul. That’s what John always says.
“More than.” The contact of their skin is pure electricity sparking up Sherlock’s arm. It’s better than heroin. More addictive.
,” he drawls, pulling his mouth around the vowel sounds as though he’s swallowing them. “Found a new friend?”
Sherlock sinks next to John on the sofa as Mrs Hudson pulls the door closed behind her, and smoothes his hand over his hair. "How are you feeling?"
The noises coming out of Sherlock are like nothing John’s yet heard in their six months of door-slamming, bed-shaking sex. Usually Sherlock’s nothing but grunting and pleading, his moans so ear-splittingly loud John often fights the urge to clap a hand over his mouth, thinking of poor Mrs Hudson downstairs.
“How much money do you have?” Sherlock has to break this spell. This is far too much, far too quickly. He darts his head back, grins, and John’s face breaks open like a light being flipped on in a dark room.
Then something clicks in his muddled mind. Something's off. Something’s missing. “Where’s your stuff?”
“Mrs Hudson’s - amazing, really. I don’t know where we’d be right now without her.” John murmurs, watching the coffee dripping down into the carafe.
John takes the invitation, scooting closer and lacing their fingers together. “Listen. I haven’t wanted to make you feel badly while you’ve been recovering, but. I need to.”
John licks his lips, wills himself not to scream. When he speaks, his voice is dead calm, if a bit shaky. "You let me because that's the -- arrangement -- we've come to. Because you asked -- no,
John flicks his tongue idly at Sherlock's earlobe, and reads out, "Hives in the City: Keeping Honey Bees Alive in an Urban World. You planning on starting beekeeping, Sherlock?"
A wave of nausea prevents John from opening his mouth. He shuts his eyes and shakes his head as gently as possible. It still feels like an avalanche inside his skull, and he swallows hard to try and not throw up all over the bed.
“So good, baby, so good.” John slips a hand into the staggering heat between Sherlock’s legs and palms his cock, murmuring encouragement between licks at the stiff pebbled flesh in his mouth.
“Oh my god, you’re such an idiot.” John bursts out, laughter ringing into the corners of their bedroom, and rolls so he’s caging Sherlock under him, hands braced on either side of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock’s lopsided grin shines in the dim blue light, and John’s heart feels full to bursting with affection. No, he can’t tell this beautiful, perfect man that their life isn’t good enough, that this isn’t what he wants anymore. Sherlock would be crushed. If John has one purpose in his entire life, it is to make this unearthly creature as happy as possible for as long as possible.
. Sherlock puts a hand on his hip to hold him down. He pushes a finger tip in, past the furled tension of John’s muscle, and John groans deep, shivering and shaking, clenching around Sherlock's finger. His cock thickens against Sherlock's tongue. He’s going to come.
Sherlock kicked at the now freed blankets until they crumpled to the floor at the end of the bed. God, he just wanted
Sherlock sucks hard at the smooth dip of muscle between John’s neck and shoulder, pulling his shirt collar back so he can get at the spot he wants more easily. John startles at the intensity of it, the sweet pain of Sherlock drawing his blood up, the prickle of bursting blood vessels; his fingers scrabble in Sherlock’s curls, trainers squeaking across the linoleum floor as he tries to keep standing up.
“And I should have told you the truth.” Sherlock shuffled them over to the bed and eased John down onto it. John looked up at him, the vulnerability that had always lain beneath the bravado now open and bare in every line of John’s face. Sherlock ached for what they had done to each other, for the cost of being in love and being afraid of it. He brushed John’s wet hair away from his face. “Forgive me? Please?”
"There. I've been waiting all week to have those gorgeous fingers up my arse.” John can barely breathe as Sherlock’s hand snakes between his legs and two wet fingers stroke softly at his perineum for a moment and then press into him. “Oh god, Sherlock.”
“Yeah, alright. Just pretend we’re on a date.” John rubs his thumb over Sherlock’s bottom lip, shivering at its plump softness, despite himself, despite the circumstances. Years of hunger and want and need aren’t so easily tamped down once freed.
Sherlock stands, gets his shoes and socks from beside the sofa. "No. I can't. I need -- I need. I need to get away from this place. That's so -- I can't think about you and me here. It's too close. It's too much
Tonight he’s in a clean dry bed, belly full of shots and real food, and perfect wonderful elfin nosed blonde haired angelic John Watson breathing hard underneath him. He’s not even high. He doesn't even want to be or need to be. John is his storm, his drug, everything.
"Something's come over you, John." Sherlock murmured, following at John's heels as they entered the darkened house. Sherlock could see a huge paneled glass door at the back, gleaming white countertops in an open kitchen, the outline of a grey stone fireplace against the opposite wall.
“Sleeping on my side now? Alright then.” John shrugs, laughing, and crawls over top of Sherlock to lie down behind him.
Sherlock sighs and rubs one hand down over his face, though looking more annoyed now than hurt. He steeples his hands under his nose and fixes his eyes on John’s, that intense deductive stare that still always makes John quail slightly.
“And you will. In due time.” The man reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a brown envelope, thick with what was surely cash. “Hopefully this will be enough incentive to retain your services for the time being.”
He's sitting in his chair again when Sherlock returns, nude and hard and flushed from hips to ears, the wrapped parcel in his hands. He drops to his knees in front of John and offers him the box.
They couldn’t have known then, what the years ahead would hold for them. The separation. The anguish of always misunderstanding each other. Trying to keep each other safe and always messing it up.
“No, yes, you are. That’s what this is - it’s every part of each other.” John tucks a stray curl behind Sherlock’s ear, kisses his cheek. “That’s all. It’s not complicated.”
It could be any other night at Baker Street. It’s almost as though nothing’s changed. Except when John sinks beside him on the sofa, Sherlock draws them together and murmurs "I love you," soft and deep against his ear. John answers with a lingering kiss, an arm tucked up the back of Sherlock's tee shirt, where his bare skin is still warm from the shower. They kiss and kiss, kiss until the doorbell rings and Sherlock murmurs something about food.
John doesn’t say anything, just shuts his eyes and swallows and swallows, tries to make the lump in his throat go away. He doesn’t want to spoil this, doesn’t want to say anything hurtful that he can’t take back.
“Yeah, well. That’s looking less likely by the second.” John’s mouth set into a tight line, his eyes tracking the mortuary van that was pulling up to park against a hedgerow of rose bushes, breaking several branches in the process.
John’s face breaks open into a wide relieved grin, and he bolts from the kitchen quick as a jackrabbit. Sherlock hovers between following John and slinking out the window, having rather forgotten all about Harry’s existence.
“I want,” I choked out, my head falling back as I luxuriated in the familiarity of his rough palms skating along my ribs. “I want…”
John sucks in a breath and exhales through his nostrils, eyes squeezed tightly shut, his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides. He’s so possessive, so protective, it makes Sherlock ache inside. He doesn’t
“Oh my god, John, oh my god,” Sherlock thumps his head against the bed and curls one long leg over John’s bad shoulder.
Finally, with a wink, John disappears inside the castle. Sherlock watches him through the sliver of open door, until he’s left alone and more than a little bit overwhelmed. Needing to process everything that happened in the last hour or so, he sinks down on the steps with his chin in his hands, and stares off across the rippling lake.
Sherlock claws at Jim's hands, smaller than his, and should be weaker, but he can't get a handle on them. He's panicking, the blood in his veins turning thick and frigid. Jim's face is so close it's blurred, his hot breath moist over Sherlock's mouth.
John straddles Sherlock's thighs, nudges them together so he can sit on them. Sherlock quakes at the feeling of John's testicles resting against his skin, and John grins in satisfaction, rubs his hips in a circle as he reaches up to take hold of the braided rope. He tugs on it, pulling the collar taut against Sherlock's throat. Sherlock gasps and bends back, his spine curving up as his shoulders leave the bed.
They laid there, Harry's soft snores the only other sound in the room, tracing each other's faces with their fingertips, and shifting until their knees were locked together, Sherlock cradling John in one arm. John picked up Sherlock's other hand, twined their fingers together, his eyes never leaving Sherlock's face. John tilted his chin up, mouth slightly open, wet his lips with that bright pink tongue, and pulled on Sherlock's tee shirt until Sherlock tore his eyes away from John's long enough to kiss him. John's lips were dry, Sherlock's cracked, their breath stale and sour. Neither cared, lost in the wonder of being together, their mouths only parting to murmur thankful promises.
“Yes, of course. I’m fantastic.” Sherlock smiled and spun John around, pointed him in the direction of the loo. “Go. Showers.”
"John - " Sherlock's hands are rubbing hot paths on John's thighs again, his words low and desperate.
him. All that Pureblood rubbish, what the fuck was he playing at?” John’s fists clench reflexively as he paces the distance between two massive old oaks, his shoulders tight.
Sherlock clearly felt him staring. A soft pink blush started on his cheeks and rushed down his neck. John could feel the heat burning in his eyes. God, he was all over the place. Ten minutes ago, he was in the midst of the worst panic attack he'd had in two years, now here he was, half hard in his rain soaked jeans, wondering if there were sheets on the bed.
John nudges Sherlock with his elbow, and Sherlock understands, leaps up to relieve Mrs Hudson of the tray.
“You haven’t done everything wrong, John.” Sherlock says tenderly, and inches closer, his hip digging into John’s thigh. “Not remotely.”
at this, not able to navigate the ups and downs of the kind of recovery John’s struggling through. He’s so goddamned inadequate. “Yes, of course I do.”
Sherlock slithers down, nuzzling his way down John's torso, sliding his hands down over his ribs and belly, nudges his nose into the soft blonde curls trailing down from John’s navel, breathing in the smell of him. He darts his tongue out, tasting salt and musk, and John shivers violently.
There’s nothing but stillness and silence behind him. Finally, Sherlock makes a choked off laugh that reminds John of the kind of annoyed noises he himself often makes when he’s at his wit’s end with Sherlock.
I hit you and I said horrible things, and I made you bleed like I had been bleeding for two years, with half my heart torn away. Just bleeding out onto the floor, dying a little more with every day that passed without you in it.
Sherlock doesn’t speed up, not even when his body is begging for it. Steady and measured, he rolls his hips, pressed without even a hairsbreadth of space up against the swell of John’s arse, his knee tight against the outside of John’s knee. John’s trembling under him, trying to turn his head so they can kiss, and making the sweetest, softest sounds Sherlock’s ever heard in his life. He could do this for hours. He could do this
Sherlock mouths against John's jaw and throws his hands behind him to grab at the headboard, "Fuck me hard, John, God I want it, so
John swiveled suddenly in Sherlock’s arms, brushing his nose up against his cold throat. “Well, come on then, gorgeous. Race you.”
“Sure. Whatever. Two each.” John’s looking decidedly wanton, the look in his eyes dangerous and raw. "You look gorgeous, you know."
“Good.” John mouths at Sherlock’s neck, drags his lips over his collarbone. “Little bruise here. I’m sorry if I hurt you.”
“Yes, John.” A wash of something akin to calm settles over him, though he’s still shaking with tension and his head is pounding. John’s in control. John's right, John has to be right.
“John.” Sherlock fixes him with the stare that even used to make Mycroft flinch a little. “Who on earth is going to come into this grotty old station, jump onto the tracks, and search for a loose tile with a cubby behind? The odds of that are --”
"Sherlock, I'm so sorry, love." John's arm tightens around Sherlock's waist. "It wasn't your fault."
ever - have with John, and it makes him think small, nasty things. Things he would never say aloud. And he
John huffed and yawned, rolled on his back so quickly Sherlock had to move or get his face crushed. He smacked his lips and yawned again, rubbed his belly. His eyes stayed shut, though, and after a few minutes he settled back into sleep, his head dropping to the side as his body relaxed.
"Not long. You've gotten quieter. That's a skill that will come in useful when we get back to casework."
"Thank you so much." John holds his hand out to her as he emerges from the cab, slightly hunched and very pale. "I'm John."
John can't swallow suddenly, the look on Sherlock's face so earnest and genuine that it lodges somewhere around John's sternum and stays there. They stare into each other's eyes just a few moments longer than is normal for mates, even mates as close as they are, and John has to inhale deeply and reteach himself how to breathe before he can speak again.
“I know. I do. Believe me.” Sherlock took John’s still bruised hand in his and kissed it softly. “Soon. Soon we’ll be out of here and this will all be behind us, and we can think about other things.”
Mrs Hudson sits down in a rolling office chair and pulls a bowl of stew to her as Sherlock hands John a bowl and sets a mug of tea down on the rickety side table for him. Sherlock sits across the table from Mrs Hudson, in a mismatched slatted wood chair with splintery arms. He lifts a spoonful of stew to his lips, chunks of carrot and potato, bits of parsnip, little whorls of grease spinning across the surface of the rich brown broth.
those footfalls, had listened to them every day for two and a half years. Listened to them taking the steps two at a time, pacing in the sitting room at 3:00am, in cadence with his own as they stalked to a crime scene feeling not a little bit like superheroes.
"Morning." Sherlock whispers, ashamed. Ashamed that he's made John angry and upset, ashamed of his own colossal stupidity.
John nods, and rests his head against the wall, traces his fingertips in patterns against Sherlock’s stomach. Sherlock closes his hand over John’s, and they stare at each other, fingers lazily stroking.
John takes a sip and it's too hot, burns the tip of his tongue and stings the open scab on his lip, and it's perfect. They take the tea to the couch and sit pressed together from ankles to shoulders and don’t speak.
He fists John’s shirt in his hands and draws him in, moving relentlessly against him, hips swiveling and grinding, pushing against John in as close a mimic to fucking him as he can. John grinds back, his eyes blazing hard, that perfect pink mouth open and panting. John’s fingers trail up around Sherlock's neck, his whole arm inside Sherlock’s shirt, pulls him down and slithers his hot tongue between Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock gives over completely, forgetting the dancing, anything but John’s tongue against his and John’s hands on his bare skin. Everywhere John touches him burns.
“Come here, Sherlock,” He murmured, his eyes drifting open, his hands closing round my hips possessively and folding me down into his lap.
"There's come all over the sofa." John giggles. Sherlock has never in his life heard any sound as maddeningly intoxicating as John giggling.
“I suppose.” Sherlock frowns as the light changes and they cross, stepping around a queue spilling out the door of Pret a Manger.
"Morning." His voice is hard, vibrating with barely concealed anger. Those beautiful blue eyes are storm swept grey, seething and dark.
John pushed himself up on his elbow so he could look into Sherlock's face. His cerulean eyes searched John's indigo ones, his mouth drawn up in a tight half smile. He was nervous and trying not to be.
Sherlock pulls a pen-sized torch out of his pocket and hands it to John, flicks another one on for himself. “It’s St Mark’s tube station. Closed in the 1960’s when the Tower Bridge station opened. It’s closed off from any lines, and pretty clean and safe, considering the alternatives.”
John wakes in the dark. His left arm completely numb under Sherlock's shoulders, his leg freezing where it's jutting out from the covers. Sherlock's rolled half on his side, curled in a ball except for his right arm thrown backwards across John's chest.
When Sherlock least expects it turns out to be a rainy Saturday morning, after they've just returned to the flat with takeaway coffees following a cosy breakfast at Speedy's. Sherlock immediately begins tidying up the sitting room from the night before as John settles in his chair. John watches him, the sinewy twist of his hips in a rare pair of jeans, his hair curlier than usual from the humidity, as he takes sips of his coffee in between stacking newspapers and winding up power cords.
to hurt people. I’ve broken men’s noses because I didn’t like how loudly they were breathing. I beat a guy unconscious for asking me to close the shade on the airplane window. I would never...I don’t know who I am, what the fuck I’m doing. I thought I was going to die. This was a suicide mission, Sherlock. I didn’t plan to make it home again.”
The rhythmic rumble of the train was strangely soothing, and it was at least six hours before he reached his stop. He hadn’t slept in over thirty six hours. Maybe a short rest...just to let the gritty burning behind his eyelids subside…
"I can't do this." Choking on his words, he stumbled backward, tripped off the kerb into a parked car, and leaned against it. His chest was heaving. He couldn't breathe.
“Which, judging from past interest, was absolutely not at all.” John’s hand brushes Sherlock’s cloak casually as they walk, their footsteps syncopated. He doesn’t seem to notice.
it. I love you. I love you." Sherlock kisses John's chin and his jaw, and John shakes and whimpers against him, wracked with tremors and chills.
John’s upper lip curls into a snarl and he turns on his heel, away from Sherlock, throwing himself into the sofa. A cloud of dust billows up around him and floats through a sliver of sunshine.
She drops a huge navy blue duffel bag on the floor with a thump. “I brought you some clothes. Didn’t have much time while mum and dad were at work, but, I managed to empty a few drawers and grab your trainers and a pair of boots.”
John feels it, as Sherlock's tongue slithers over his own, sweet and hot and wet, tasting the wine and spices in each others’ mouths. Whatever lingering wall there was between them, whatever doubts John may have harboured, whatever Sherlock was holding back from him - it’s all gone. There is nothing between them now, not a single atom. Where John Watson ends, Sherlock Holmes begins, swirling around and into one another like an eddy in a stream.
, and trails one finger down the side. John moans deeply, looking up at Sherlock with wide eyes. He reminds Sherlock of the boy in the alley, before he had a name, angelic and perfect. Those big blue eyes so trusting, so hungry.
John pulls Sherlock up by his hair, crushing their mouths together in a ferocious kiss. Sherlock moans, biting at John's mouth and crawling up the chair until he's practically in John's lap. John yanks him backwards, eliciting a harsh gasp from Sherlock, whose eyes are now watering.
“Hey, Sherlock,” John says, his voice so soft and warm that it lights Sherlock up from the inside out. He leans forward on his broom, and drops down to eye level with Sherlock. “I didn’t know you liked Quidditch. I’ve never seen you at a match.”
“Oh.” Sherlock threw the sheets back without hesitation or embarrassment and untangled the tube, moved it over so John could shift over more. “Better?”
our affections had been laid bare as I had quickly recovered from my shock and kissed him back fiercely, the love and passion that burned so brightly within me erupting without thought to consequence, after holding back for such a long time. We had kissed in that filthy dank alley until the fear of discovery finally descended upon us. Watson had wrapped my leg in a makeshift bandage - strips of his own torn sleeve - and we hobbled slowly home, gazing at one another with the wonder of newly acknowledged desire.
“I know,” Sherlock grinned and rubbed his face against John’s cock, allowing the head to slide along his cheekbone. Precome smeared wet against his skin and he shut his eyes and moaned, knowing exactly how wanton he looked.
John’s eyes cast down at the sheets, and he sighed deeply. “I wasn’t sure. That you’d really be here. It’s still...really hard for me to believe. This isn’t going to be easy. Nothing about any of this is going to be. I have...I have a job to finish here. I have to. Or...there will be consequences. Ugly ones. Before anything else, before we can…”
“You’ll make sure he gets home alright, yeah?” Owen leaned in the door of the cab as John crawled across the back seat and tried not to just face plant into the upholstery.
John’s groan resonates all the way down Sherlock’s throat, as Sherlock wraps his slippery hand around John’s cock and
Sherlock had stopped and blinked at the screen, his hands templed under his nose. He leaned forward until his face was distorted by the laptop camera. Those intense green eyes narrowed for a moment, and John was suddenly terrified that he’d said the completely wrong thing. Then Sherlock’s whole face transformed, a huge grin wrinkling up the corners of his eyes, rounding his hollow cheeks, making him look about twelve years old.
Sherlock glances up at John’s scarlet blushed face, at his pulse thrumming visibly in his neck, and nearly flinches at the ferocious desire in John’s eyes. No one has
The drinks are slammed in front of them before Sherlock has time to feel awkward about John's boldness. No one has ever kissed over his scabs, his scars, the evidence of what he does to himself.
“What lamp? Darling, are you certain you’re alright? You seem a bit - out of sorts. Let me ring Mrs Hudson to bring up the tea. I think you need fortifying. It’s been quite a long day.” As John stands up, stretching his arms over his head and rolling his neck, the outline of a bushy moustache that John certainly didn’t have that morning is clearly visible against the flicker of the firelight. A golden watch chain glimmers, dangling from a waistcoat pocket as he bends forward to put his folded newspaper back in his chair.
“We’re done. I’ll be in touch. Make my life marginally less complicated, would you, and don’t leave the flat again tonight.”
They reached the house just as the policemen were slamming their car doors shut, the radios on their shoulders humming with disembodied voices in the chill morning air. The driver of the mortuary van stepped out and stretched his back, looking supremely bored. A young ginger haired cop turned instinctively toward John and Sherlock as they came up behind the haphazard collection of vehicles. He strode toward them. No name badge on his uniform, but two pin holes where one was normally affixed. No watch either, but the skin round his wrist was pale. In a rush this morning, started his day off badly.
known. Not even when he was a kid, never. John smiles at him with cheese in the corner of his mouth, and Sherlock bursts out laughing and can’t stop. John starts laughing too, and saying, “What? What are we laughing about?” Which makes Sherlock laugh harder, laugh until his stomach hurts and he can’t breathe.
“As I, you, my love.” His eyes softened as he gazed down at me with the affection that we reserved for the private spaces, it being neither safe nor legal for us to adore each other so blatantly in public. “Come up here.”
They make breakfast together, eggs and beans on toast, giggling like schoolboys and kissing against the sink. When they go to Angelo’s for dinner that night, Angelo brings a candle for the table, and John smiles at Sherlock over the flickering flame.
than me, arsehole." John slapped him on the back and forced a laugh. He'd forgotten what it was like to do this, to unreservedly relax with friends, drink and sing and act ridiculous. He hooked a finger at the bartender, a willowy young woman with a double nose piercing and tattoos twining up her arms who poured shots at lightening speed. "Another round for this lot, love."
"Oh fuck me, that's so good," John's prick is already dripping copiously onto the back of Sherlock's tongue, “I don’t mind a little teeth, it’s alright. Just keep sucking me like that, it feels so good, you’re amazing - “
Relief surges through him, so powerfully he’s weak from it. A strangled sob lurches out of his throat, his eyes prickling with tears.
“Oh - oh - oh, god, I’m gonna -” John’s fingers suddenly curl at the headboard, his rough panting deepening into a low rumbling groan as his hips snap down hard.
“Hey now. You didn’t do anything wrong, sweetpea.” Sometimes John could hardly believe the string of pet names that fell from his lips when they were in this space together. It just felt so natural and right. Sherlock would have balked any other time, rolled his eyes in exasperation. When he was subbed out, though, he drank the endearments in like air, like an element necessary for existence. “Look at me, Sherlock. You don’t need to hang your head like that. You’ve done nothing wrong, darling. Alright?”
This moment, while he's staring at Blackfriars Bridge and the strangely beautiful brackish water flowing underneath, thinking about John's mouth kiss swollen murmuring
Sherlock unzips his jeans with one hand, thumbs over the mobile in his pocket with the other. He can feel Jim's eyes on his back, even though he's partially obscured by the wall and the shower stall. He tries to relax enough to actually piss. Closes his eyes and breathes out heavily, willing his stomach muscles to loosen. It's not working. He wants to turn on the tap, listen to the sound of rushing water, but he knows that would rouse Jim's curiosity. He tries to think of rivers, streams, any kind of moving water. Finally, picturing the sparkling green water of the Thames, he's able to let it go. Hopefully the sound will obscure the sound of the button. He flicks on the mobile as quickly as he can manage without moving his hand too much.
The space between them was thrumming with the remnants of John's anger. Speechless, Sherlock just laid his forehead on John's leg. The warm press of John's hand settled on the nape of his neck, fingers idly sifting through his curls.
John breathes hard through his nose, his shoulders trembling with the effort of containing the rage that's burning acid in his throat. His teeth hurt already from clenching them. "I am not going to hit you."
Mike, who hardly ever takes anything personally, laughs and takes the seat beside Sherlock. “He likes you a lot,” he says simply, and then falls silent, allowing Sherlock his contemplations.
He pulls on his loosest, softest jeans, and Sherlock’s blue dressing gown over his bare chest. It smells like Sherlock; cinnamony and sharp, clean sweat and strong black tea. He pulls the collar up over his nose and breathes Sherlock in as he shuffles into the kitchen. The electric kettle is half full of water, and Sherlock’s set John’s favourite mug next to it with two teabags already in the bottom.
“Oh.” Ginger sniffed, but it was a poor cover for the disapproving curl of his lip. He cleared his throat. “Wouldn’t have guessed that. You don’t look - well. Anyway. I’ll need to get your contact information,
“We didn’t. Do now. I went…” He nodded his head, smiling crookedly down at Sherlock, who was now passing exploring fingers over his neck and breathing hot against his throat. “...to a shop. I can’t believe you didn’t deduce it or smell it on me or something.”
“Goodnight, Sherlock.” John presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead and idly spins his wedding band around his finger, wondering what it really is about tonight that’s making his stomach twist in anxious knots.
John throws the Boots bag on the sofa, spins around and pushes Sherlock up against the just closed door with both hands. "
You’re moving around now. I can hear you. Your body wondering where I’ve gone even before you’re conscious.
Ginger ground his jaw and glared at them, as though whatever he’d heard through the radio was their fault. “I’m needed inside - but you two don’t move, alright?”
"Don't. Don't thank me." John rolls to his side, peers off the edge of the bunk down at Sherlock. "This is for both of us. I'm not being selfless."
Sherlock slowed the movements of his tongue, pulled off and ran his mouth down the side of John’s cock as he pushed a second finger into him and swept his fingertips across his prostate. He knew after three years together the exact combination of mouth and fingers that would make John absolutely undone.
Sherlock’s phone interrupts him, buzzing loudly with a text before he can send one. He lays the phone between them and motions John over to read the screen.
“Morning,” he mutters thickly, ducking back into his bed with the parchment clutched in his hand, and pulling the curtains shut tight with a snap. He grabs his wand from under his pillow and murmurs
“Have you before?” Sherlock opens his eyes as John shifts to the side, reaching into the bedside drawer where Sherlock had stashed his lube and condoms the day before. He runs his hand down the smooth tautness of John’s muscular back, over the curve of his arse. “God, you’re really so beautiful, John.”
"JOHN!! I lost my keys!! JOHN!" Sherlock's face has taken on that somewhat feral expression he wears when he's about to really lose control.
Sherlock, alive. Holding John in his arms. He couldn’t be angry right now. He just couldn’t. This was too miraculous.
A bell jingled merrily as he opened the door. This place was the opposite of the dreary Denny’s in Minneapolis. It was clean and warm and friendly, the kind of place people grew up in, made memories in. He thought immediately of Angelo’s, him wolfing down pasta, Sherlock watching him bemusedly, their knees bumping under the table.
“Shhh. You are not allowed to talk about the case. Or think about it. You need to rest, let your brain rest.” John sips his own water, watches his husband across the table. His
“Can I?” Sherlock whispers, his hand resting against John’s peach fuzz pale belly, waiting. It occurs to him this might be a strange thing to say, since they’ve obviously done this many, many times.
Sherlock had curled his shaking sweating body next to John's, his head thick. The pillow cool and firm, white sheets and industrial strength laundry soap. John's warm fingers soothing his brow.
Sherlock laughs too, turns his head and rubs his lips against John’s forehead, John’s temple, until John lifts his head and finds Sherlock’s mouth with his own. He kisses him messily, with puffy lips and bad aim, and presses his fingertips in
He walks away from the edge of the park, breathing hard, and shakes a cigarette out of the crushed pack. It's broken near the filter. He squeezes it together between his thumb and index finger, lights it and takes a long drag. Not as strong as it would be without the break, but good enough.
"As charming as ever, John." Mycroft flashes his most simpering smile and John sneers back, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling.
John looks up, fingers still gently stroking inside Sherlock, his face wet with tears and sweat, "We've just misunderstood each other for so long, haven't we?"
“Sir? Sir, where are you going? You can’t just roam the unit. Are you looking for someone?” One of the bored nurses steps from behind the counter, approaches him.
One of Sherlock’s long pale arms drapes down over John’s shoulder, then soft lips brush against the shell of his ear. “Wash your hair?”
He wakes up to the steady drip of rain against the window, the room lit grey and pale. John’s golden hair is all he can see when his eyes open, John’s head tipped down into Sherlock’s chest, breathing even and slow. He must have gotten up in the night and gotten a shower, gotten dressed. His hair smells like shampoo, and he’s back in the maroon button down and the dark denim shorts they bought at H&M yesterday.
Sherlock moves his face into John’s shoulder, presses himself hip to chest against him. He can’t get close enough. Lips over John’s throat, his Adam’s apple bobbing against Sherlock’s kisses as he licks his way up over John’s stubbly jaw, and John turns, catches his mouth, runs his tongue devastatingly lightly along the outside of Sherlock’s lips, makes Sherlock chase his mouth, then pulls his head back with a dangerous smile.
“Well,” Sherlock’s voice dips an octave lower, warm and sweet as melted chocolate, and he rocks his hips slowly from side to side against the leather cushions. “I believe we are due for some make up sex.”
Sherlock throws the sheets off, and drags on yesterday’s clothes, knowing he’s sticky and foul and smells like sex and stale sweat, but he’s still cleaner than he was a week ago, so he doesn’t care.
"Fuck, you're gorgeous like this. My pet. My perfect creature. I should have put you in a collar years ago." John circles his thumb in the wetness at the head of Sherlock's cock, making him whimper. His thighs are shaking already. "The collar is for both of us. You wear it when one of us wants this, and no other time."
“No, Sherlock. I need to think about this. This isn’t just you we’re putting in danger. This would be my job if we cock this up, and I’m not about to put my entire career on the line.” Lestrade stands, gathers up the small spiral notebook and pencil he’s been using to take copious notes. “You boys stay put. Stay in this flat. Don’t make yourselves targets. Do not - I repeat,
-  Sherlock’s moaning too, high pitched and broken, rocking his hips against John’s stomach as John pushes down onto his fingers, and then finally, finally, he’s able to flip the cap on the lube and drizzle it haphazardly all over both of them before he throws it behind him and hears it bounce off the bed and hit the floor.
“Stop bouncing round like an overactive otter, and maybe I will. You’re giving me a headache to look at you, my love.” John scrubs his knuckles into his eyes, the dull thud of a hangover resonating at the base of his skull. “Have you had a shower yet?”
He hates to think of what they’ll go back to when the money runs out for the hostel. Sleeping huddled together on the never washed sleeping bag, the rain pouring down the steps. Reality washes over him like a bucket of ice cold water.
more endearing. Sherlock wants to wrap his entire body around him, shield him, kiss every single pore on his face, never let the ugliness of the world wear down the wonderful goodness that is John Watson. Sherlock’s whole chest feels like it’s cracking open, everything soft and good that was left in him being exposed, John drawing it out of him. “Yes, it’s okay. We’ll just go slow, and you tell me if you want to stop.”
Sherlock’s fingers closed around the toy and eased it out of him. John felt empty and open without it. Sherlock let out a long shivering groan, his hands rubbing circles on John’s arse and hips. John felt his weight shift on the mattress, and he raised his hips, but instead of Sherlock’s cock pushing into him, it was the sweet wet heat of his tongue. His adrenaline spiked, a rush of endorphins like a tide sweeping up and over him, and everything went white as the pressure in his cock became almost unbearable.
They make their way into the bedroom, where Sherlock stands in front of the full length mirror, watching himself touching the collar, stroking his index finger over the ring. John can't stand not to touch him. He presses himself fully clothed against Sherlock's bare back, caresses his hips and his belly, mouths at his shoulder. Sherlock shivers under John's hands. John watches in the mirror as his eyes fall shut. John lets his hand wander down to Sherlock's now half hard prick, takes him in hand as he kisses across his shoulder blades. Sherlock sucks in a loud breath and arches into John's hand.
Without stopping to consider what he was doing, he pulled a hand out from under Sherlock's, and touched his fingertips to Sherlock's face. He had to. He had to touch him, even though he'd never once put a hand on Sherlock's face before. It seemed painfully intimate, but he couldn't not. Sherlock allowed himself a small smile, eyes fixed on John's.
“You know for what.” John kisses him again and slips backwards off the bed. “Okay, well, here we go, then.”
"No, we won't be needing two." John turns sparkling eyes on Sherlock, all the brighter in his wan and tired looking face.
- varying the pressure, seemingly trying to find the best way to make Sherlock swallow his own tongue.
“I’ve a better idea for keeping warm.” John presses a kiss to the centre of Sherlock’s chest, climbing across his knees and padding across the bare floor to a small fireplace Sherlock hadn’t even noticed the night before.
Sherlock lies there, helpless, scratching his fingers against John’s scalp and wondering how he never knew that having his nipples sucked would make him go completely insane. His other hand wanders down his belly.
“I have no idea. Couple thousand, I think. Wanna go find out?” John jumps up to standing and stretches his hand down to Sherlock, his face alight with mischief. “Come on.”
“Shhhh. That’s it,” John says again, quietly, as he presses a kiss against Sherlock’s forehead. “I know you’ve barely slept the whole time I was in hospital. Just relax, love.”
“You - what?!” There have been far too many conflicting emotions in the last five minutes. John’s stomach lurches and his vision fills with winking black spots. Overwhelmed, he clutches at Sherlock for support, and then remembers he’s angry with him. He drops his hands to his sides, clenching into fists, his fingernails slicing into his palms.
John smoothed his hands over Sherlock's chest, heedless of the mess between them, and stilled his hips. He breathed hard, looking down at Sherlock with shining eyes and a soft smile, "That's it, sweetheart. That's it. Oh god, you're beautiful."
He’s shuddering and biting at Sherlock’s mouth when Sherlock abruptly stops and pulls away. “No. Not like this. I want. I want you inside me.”
Sherlock rubs his hair with a towel, pulls on his new clothes. He hasn't said thank you. He hasn't...he must. John’s done so much, changed everything for him. Clears his throat. "John. I just wanted to say --"
John thinks Sherlock’s going to give. His eyes flicker for a second, mouth twitching, and John can see him struggling with himself. He looks down, but when his eyes focus on John again, they’re unforgiving. "If you
“Thank - thank you.” Sherlock doesn’t know what to do with his hands, arms dangling useless at his sides. He looks up at the ceiling.
John shut his eyes and breathed deep, and Sherlock could feel it. He could feel everything - John's shivering skin, his heart thumping wildly, the low guttural groan that rumbled through him as his pace picked up, thighs sliding damp against the sides of Sherlock's stomach. Sherlock's hand on his prick stuttered and slowed, lost for the moment in the pleasure of John surrounding him, the beautiful friction as the head of his cock rubbed against the  nub of John's prostate.
Sherlock cleared his throat, opened his mouth. He couldn’t seem to find the words. The question had been there, right there, a moment ago. Do you love me? Now, with John quiet and waiting, it was trapped behind years of bottled emotion, behind the certainty that he would never deserve John, that he was unworthy of anyone’s affections.
Sherlock looks down at him gratefully, knowing how much it’s costing John to support this, how much he’s holding in. John smiles at him reassuringly, though his eyes are melancholy.
, but he can't, he absolutely can't, and it aches terribly when he says, "No, I have to - we have to. You know what I've been doing."
“It’s alright. It’s fine. Just drop it.” Sherlock tucks in, avoiding his friends’ eyes, feeling fuzzy-headed and irritable.
“Johnny, oh god.” She whispers, hands coming up and covering her mouth. Her eyes flick to Sherlock, narrow suspiciously. Hands come away from her mouth and she plants them on her hips. “Who the hell are you?”
“I plan to.” John murmurs back, dipping his head back down to nuzzle at Sherlock’s mouth. A hard shiver runs the length of his spine, rippling out across his limbs and up the back of his neck. No one has ever turned him on the way Sherlock does, had the ability to make him feel like his skin is on fire, like he’s burning from the inside out.
John saunters back to him with an impish grin and ducks under the bar. For the first time tonight, there’s nothing between them - no bar, no writhing mass of people. John sidles up against Sherlock, all pretense abandoned, his half hard cock pressing against Sherlock’s thigh. He smells like sugared raspberries and tequila. Sherlock wants to lick every glittering centimeter of him, see if he tastes as sweet as he smells.
Sherlock hums and tilts his head so John can get a better angle. John’s still dressed. That has to change. He kneels up and yanks his jumper and tee shirt over his head in one movement, and then rolls on his back to kick his jeans and pants onto the floor, then rolls back to drape his naked body against Sherlock’s naked body, and it’s perfect how they fit together. John bends his knee over Sherlock’s thigh, noses at his neck, and says quietly, “Now where was I?”
Sherlock doesn’t ask why this time. This has gone beyond questioning it. For the first time in years, he doesn’t even want the drugs. He wants to sit up with John all night long and talk and watch the river and smoke. His body is screaming for them, though, and he can no longer deny himself. He puts needle to skin, lets his eyes fall shut, feels the pop, the coolness and then the burn as he depresses the plunger.
John chokes back the desperate noises that are trying to make their way out of his throat, the tears that are threatening in his eyes. "Sherlock."
Right. Need to interject, stop Sherlock before he really gets rolling. “Sherlock. Sweetheart. I don’t have a skull fracture. I promise you. I don’t.”
"I always did, from the start, always. Wanted you. Loved you." John says quietly, seriously, wanting Sherlock to understand how much he means this.
John covers them both with the sheets and the bedspread, curls to Sherlock's side with his head on his chest. "This is nice."
He pulled back slowly, holding my lip between both of his and rubbing the tips of our noses together. I opened my eyes and blinked hazily at him, already half drunk on endorphins, very nearly in a swoon. He reached up and wiped the saliva from my lip and chin. I could already feel the satisfying burn of his stubble around my mouth.
At least that's how John feels. This is momentous, what's happening between them now. They're breaking down walls of misunderstanding that have been established since the day they met. They've never said anything so honest before, about how they really feel about each other. John's heartbeat is deafening in his ears.
"John, I don't even know what it is we're doing. But whatever it is, I don't think it can wait any longer, do you?" Sherlock's voice is shaking.
He told Sherlock he'd be there when he woke up. When Sherlock's in his subspace, he's needy, dependent, can't be left. Shit.
"Oh Christ," The head of his cock touches Sherlock's body, just barely, and Sherlock groans, pants, claws into John's hip. "You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, Sherlock."
There's absolutely no explanation for how hot and perfect the sole of Sherlock's bare foot feels rubbing over his arse, except that it's Sherlock and of course he would do something bizarre like rub John's arse with his foot and make it sexy and endearing and wonderful. Sherlock puts his foot flat against him and pushes them together so tightly their hip bones grind together and it actually hurts, and John groans and tries to move and Sherlock whispers, "Sorry, sorry," and John doesn't care that it hurts because he just wants them as close as they can possibly get and so he says, "I don't care, it's fine," and kisses him again.
“But you like it now?” John’s mouth curved up, pleased and eager to share this simple moment of enjoying the same song together.
“You know, I have to say I don’t think they were very thorough with the CT scan. I mean, they only did the
John pulls Sherlock’s head against his chest, tucks his chin into his hair, and rubs his back with long easy strokes. Sherlock sighs, his body loosening, limbs going heavy as he loops his right arm over John’s chest and his right leg in between both of John’s.
"You safeword if you need to, understand?" John smoothes Sherlock's sweaty hair, wipes the tears from his nose.
A fat drop of fluid beaded at the tip of my cock and I could not help but reach down with a trembling hand, but John reached around my waist and grabbed my arm before I could touch myself.
“Yeah, sounds good.” John kisses Sherlock back as they turn towards the hallway, and tries not to think about the fact that Sherlock yet again managed to avoid saying
“There you are. I knew you could move if you just loosened up.” Sherlock tilts his head back, shouts in John’s ear. “More drinks?”
John purses his mouth, eyebrows raised, his eyes dancing with amusement. “I guess I’ll have to work a little harder, then. Tough crowd.”
John. John has given him this, this bud of hope in his chest that seems to be blooming larger with every passing minute. He
Soldier Boy has disappeared into the crowd. Damn. Well, he is quite short, probably only 165cm without the added height of the combat boots.
The tears started to come, and this time John let them. He usually had to after fucking the hell out of some guy who wasn’t Sherlock. It was when he felt, just for the length of the shower, like himself. Like a decent human being who could love someone. A sob wrenched out of his throat, and he said aloud, “I’m sorry, Sherlock. Fuck. I am so sorry. I just miss you so fucking badly. I don’t know how to stop.”
"Oh, that's lovely. I'll take two." She digs in her purse for coins, and sets them in John's outstretched hand. "Who's Mrs Hudson, by the way?"
The kettle whistles and John pours two cups of tea, though he knows Sherlock’s will go untouched until it’s cold and bitter. He sets the cup next to Sherlock’s chair, on the floor, and grabs his phone to email Ella about rescheduling. One damn appointment and she’s probably already completely fed up with him.
“Oh fuck, Sherlock, oh god.” He heard himself, as if from far away, moaning and whimpering like an animal in heat. Which is exactly what he felt like. There was nothing left in him except the instinct to rut and fuck and come, to bleed and lick and bite. Conquer, be conquered. Be taken.
"You have no problem ordering me about. You have no problem having me do all the chores. You have no hesitation about laying claim to me, possessing me. I wear your dog tags all day, we have scars on our bodies from cutting into each other. You have no reservations about telling me to hurry up and clean the sitting room before you get home or else I'll be in for it. You've spanked me and corrected me dozens of times. Because we both want those things. Because we've talked about it and agreed upon it. How is this any different?"
Jim sets the vial carefully in the palm of Sherlock’s other hand and closes his fingers for him. “Careful with that now. Wouldn’t do to lose it.”
John leans down, bracing himself with a hand on either side of Sherlock’s head, and noses under his jaw. He purrs against Sherlock’s skin, low and dirty and
When John returns, his face has been scrubbed clean, no eye make up, no glitter. He’s wearing worn light blue jeans, a striped blue and grey jumper, and chocolate brown oxfords. He’s got an army green backpack slung over his shoulder, and he looks like a fresh faced uni student. His eyelashes are no longer thick and black, but honey coloured and softly swooping up to touch his eyelids. He's still wearing a little bit of lip gloss, which shimmers in the dimly lit club. He gives Sherlock a crooked grin that makes his stomach flip over.
John’s job here seemed through, Lester off the hook, his brother in prison and Malvo seemingly disappeared. Whatever loose ends he had to tie up could be done safely from London. They needed distance. “I should tell the police what I know. That Solverson deputy. I should talk to her."
home together, not my home in which he resided. I could not then, nor can I now, adequately describe the deep emotions that stirred within me; the knowledge that Watson had chosen to make manifest our oneness. We were no longer even two separate people, but existed as one.
. Didn't that give you some kind of a clue, Mr Consulting Detective?" John laughed and smacked Sherlock on the thigh playfully. "Come on now, gorgeous. As irresistible as I find you when you're sulking, I'm too damned tired and drunk for serious conversation. Had enough of that with poor Mike. Fetch me the parcel and we'll see what's in it, yeah?"
"Shhhh. It's alright." John nipped at his belly, ran a hand down his thigh. "No one's ever taken you like this before, I know. No one's ever been inside you, touched you like this. I know. It's alright, I'm going to make you feel so good. You can trust me, lassie."
Finally, when the sun was fully up, bright and cold in the midwinter sky, Sherlock said, “I have to...I have to get up and use the loo and get some coffee. I’m sorry to disturb you, I just…”
Sherlock looks over at John, who is standing silent and watchful by the front door. He's wearing a pair of Sherlock's trousers because his one pair were covered in blood and cut off of him at the hospital. They're cuffed three times at the bottom, and he would look like a kid wearing his big brother's clothes if his face wasn't so rigid and ferocious, his back straight, those rugby strong arms folded across his chest. As it is, he looks like a bouncer.
“Oh my god, John, Jesus. You’re -- you’re lying there with a stab wound to your liver, inflicted on you because of me, and you’re asking if I’m okay?! If I’m okay.
"Oh. Yeah. Of course you would have done that. I'm sorry." What an idiot. To have thought the food would still be rotting in the fridge? God, what was wrong with him?
I shook off these recollections of times past and grabbed the petroleum. John was waiting. When I returned to the sitting room, John had stoked the fire up so it was blazing, the space in front of the hearth now at least ten degrees hotter than the rest of the chilled room. He had also liberated himself of his nightshirt and gown, which were now thrown carelessly over the end of the settee, and was sitting completely nude in the green chair, his cock stiff and proud against his belly.
“Since I came home. Around five.” John let his hand fall to Sherlock’s hair, pulled it a little. Sherlock gasped softly, and John pulled harder. “Well, first, I laid out everything we need for tonight. Then I took a shower, and let off a little built up steam, then I got myself nice and wet..." John gasped, clenched a little tighter; just telling Sherlock about it was setting his skin on fire, “And then I worked it in, and god, it’s been making me mad all fucking afternoon. I couldn’t wait for you to get here.”
really can't stand you bunging about the flat staring at me constantly. It's bloody creepy, actually."
“Oh, oh, oh my god, John,” Sherlock gasps, his back beginning to bow, hips stuttering upward as he chases his climax.
“Long story.” Sherlock pulls his belt with his teeth, tightens it around his arm. “Why are you out here?”
Sherlock played along, looking up at John with wide innocent eyes, and taking his mouth off his cock long enough to murmur, "I didn't learn it anywhere. This is my first time with a prick in my mouth."
Sometimes though. Sometimes I still startle awake, anxiety heavy in my stomach and my nerves on fire, at two in the morning. I try not to wake you, if you’re beside me.
John doesn’t even notice the flashlights coming down the track, the voices shouting to each other in the dark.
"Well maybe I'm reconsidering." Sherlock strides towards John menacingly, and John actually has to consciously force himself not to step back. Sherlock's voice is a harsh half whisper, "The Work, John. You interfered with The Work. And I
“Here, love, just come back a bit, there we go,” John pulls Sherlock to meet him, until the lush swells of his arse is fitted perfectly in the cradle of John’s bent legs. He takes himself in hand and pushes the thick head of his cock against Sherlock’s loosened entrance. It’s still incredibly tight, and John exhales, trying to control the urges of his body telling him to just push in hard and fast.
Sherlock laughs and pulls his coat tighter around him. “I thought he was rather pleasant today. For Mycroft, anyway.”
"Still feels good, Sherlock? Even though you already --" John wants Sherlock to want it, wants him keening and bouncing on his thighs, wailing for it, "I just, I don't want to do anything that doesn't feel good to you, alright?"
“You coming to breakfast? I’ll wait and walk up with you if you are,” Mike’s voice is muffled slightly by Sherlock’s curtains. The other two must have already left while Sherlock was ruminating.
"Okay." John smiles obligingly and rolls, wiggling his arse up against Sherlock as his runs his hand down his side and over his thigh.
The storm outside is getting heavier, the rain lashing hard against the window, hammering deafeningly loudly. The lights flicker again.
“Sherlock, I’m going to -” He trails off. Sherlock’s already in their flat, deep inside that extraordinary mind of his. He won’t notice John spending thirty minutes catching up with Mrs Hudson.
"You think so? Huh. I don't know, I think I'd feel bloody foolish." John abruptly closed the box and set it on the floor. "It was a hell of a lovely thought though. We
Sherlock takes his hands, eases him down to the bed, and turns on his side to face him, curled up with his hands beside his face. John pulls the condom off, ties it carefully and tosses it somewhere in the vicinity of the loo. He turns and looks at Sherlock, flushed and glowing with perspiration, his hair tangled, his eyes soft and drowsy.
“Sorry, get what?” There was one dark damp curl hanging down on his forehead. John wanted to reach out and play with it, just to feel the smooth hair shafts twisting around his skin. He didn’t.
"Of course you did. And you were right." John breathed out in a rush. He cleared his throat and looked down at his hands.
"Fine." Lestrade turns away from her and looks at Sherlock again. "You want to tell me what that message last night was about?"
"Oh, Christ. Fuck, yeah, just like that. That's perfect, love." John's right leg curled up over Sherlock's shoulder and the kilt fabric fell over the side of Sherlock's face, silky and hot against his ear and the side of his mouth. John reached down and rubbed it against Sherlock's cheek until he was moaning around John's cock, saliva running in rivulets over his fingers. "You highland -
John leaned down, curled the fingers of his other hand around Sherlock’s jaw, skin still chilly from being outside, and tilted his head to the side. Putting his lips to Sherlock’s ear, he whispered, “That’s my boy, that’s lovely. No, darling, not too late. Everything’s ready for us.
“No one else deserved to have it said.” John chin tilts up, and Sherlock’s down, and they’re kissing again, tongues curling wet and hot against each other, cool skin, John’s hand drifting down over his hip.
He didn’t have the guts to do it himself. He’d proved that. So many nights, perched on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, surrounded by his things, his smell, the memory of him pervading every crack in the floor and fiber in the bedsheets. The gun laying heavy in his hands, tears dripping off his chin and splashing against the metal.
His voice is so hoarse, barely audible. Words a bit slurred. He must be on pain medication. Sherlock gnaws into his lip.
He’d wandered into some seedy street one night, months ago, accidentally. He wasn’t looking for it. But there was a man, young, looked so much like Sherlock that it hurt. Not nearly as breathtaking, but gorgeous nonetheless. Curly hair, high cheekbones, pale skin. A close enough approximation that John’s breath caught painfully in his throat.
“Very well.” Mycroft takes a seat across from them and pulls his chair in, leans forward across the glossy finish of the huge table. “You realise this is all completely off the record. You were never here, we never spoke, and this certainly doesn’t have anything to do with Jim Moriarty.”
“Well. You are.” Sherlock sounds incredulous. His fingers slow their steady pace and he says much more quietly, slow and cautious, “You are
Sherlock smiled around John's thumb, feeling him shiver, his breath quicken. He sucked a little, swirled his tongue around his first knuckle and licked broadly at the second, hollowing his cheeks. John's mouth was suddenly against his throat, sucking and biting, licking up to his jaw and dragging down to his mouth, dislodging his thumb and replacing it with his tongue. Sherlock's arms instinctively circled round John's neck as he reciprocated, tracing the inside of John's mouth with the tip of his tongue. John groaned and turned without breaking the kiss, lowering himself over Sherlock's outstretched legs.
. With the whole of my being.” I said fervently, and pressed my cheek against his palm, brushing my lips against the silky skin of his wrist.
He’d laughed, long and unbelieving, and when Sherlock was still watching him, without the trace of a smile, he got his jacket and they went to church. Sherlock had sat there, silent, hands folded in his lap, his head turning like an owl, taking it all in. John just watched Sherlock; nothing in the church was as wondrous as the profile of that face in the dim wavering light.
John pushes his finger in up to the knuckle and moans, bends forward to kiss Sherlock’s stomach and rub his other hand up and down Sherlock’s side. “God, I love you.”
"John, why are you so - " Sherlock stops, at the look on John's face. He's standing in the kitchen doorway with his scarf half undone and his shirt untucked, eyes wide with confusion and not a small amount of fear. "I'm sorry. Maybe I said that wrong. I didn't mean I didn't want you."
Nina looks up and smiles. “Hi.” She goes to him, looking up at him. “You’ve got powers!” She gasps and grins.
Greg chuckles and changes his home screen saver on his phone to the picture of him and Mycroft. “Our first picture together.”
Sherlock clings to John, his hands trembling a bit as he holds onto John’s jumper. He just hopes John doesn’t notice that he’s not getting hard.
"You know you are terribly distracting. I completely forgot we were supposed to be having breakfast and instead you come in here and fuck me till I can't breathe. What am I going to do with you, hmm?" She smiles and kisses him.
Sherlock wants to watch John while he's still sleeping. He turns, careful not to move the mattress too much or dislodge the blankets. John rolls on his back, scratches clumsily at the side of his face where gingery stubble has cropped up overnight. Sherlock has always thought John was beautiful, in the way mountains are - imposing, solid, immovable, taking up the whole of the horizon with their grandiosity. Now he seems smaller. More real. Flawed and fragile, and somehow all the more beautiful for it.
“Keep still,” John whispers, and licks at the slit, letting Sherlock see his tongue - flat and pink and
“Science doesn’t have feelings. Which is sometimes convenient.” Sherlock smiles sadly, feeling the weight of all this compressing his lungs, making his limbs feel heavy.
He doesn't say any of those things. He just squeezes Sherlock's head in the cradle of his arms and kisses him until his lips are raw.
,” he groaned, long and low and tremulous. He bucked wildly for a moment, and then with one final jut of his hips, his thighs flexing against the curve of my arse, he fell forward against my back and tucked his face against my nape. His ragged whines faded into shuddering breaths as his arms closed around my waist and he held me close.
Sherlock hummed his assent, and made his way back down to the van. The moon had risen high above the trees now, having shed its autumnal glow. It was bright white and cold, bathing the landscape in an eerie blue light. Low round mountains rose in the north, narrow roads snaking through their valleys. Sherlock could just make out the square white tower of the Cairndow kirk. The only sounds were the scrabble of woodland creatures, the occasional hoot of an owl. Sherlock stood there, mesmerised, until he heard the "Goddammit!" and the unmistakable sound of logs tumbling over each other. He winced and waited a beat.
John rolled back between Sherlock's legs, running his palms over Sherlock's stomach and chest. "You certainly are," he murmured warmly, nipping at Sherlock's collarbone.
Sherlock flops down hard in the rickety wooden chair across from John and it rocks, Sherlock's leg flying up instinctively to balance him. He almost falls flat on his back on the sidewalk. But John's laughing and Sherlock's laughing, and that familiar frisson of electricity passes between them as they grin at each other. John shivers. Luckily he can just say he's cold if Sherlock asks. He clears his throat as the laughter fades. Now, they watch each other, taking the other in, gauging his mood. They feel their way around each other like this, always; carefully, gently.
Before he could tear his eyes away from them, a tall, painfully thin man with dark sunglasses and a spindly mustache slid comfortably into the bench across the table and folded his hands on top of it. He nodded at John. “Hello.”
Sherlock watches him chew and then makes an impatient noise and stretches his arms above his head. “Well, as we’re stuck here until Mycroft’s people show up, I’m going to get another drink. A coffee this time, I think.”
"So what would my consequences be?" John can hardly keep himself from smiling. He already knows he's going to agree.
“It’s completely impossible to find this unless you’re searching for it, and no one would.” They’re kneeling next to each other far back on the tunnel trackway, knees digging into hundred year old gravel and bits of rubbish. Sherlock jiggles the loose tile and it pulls loose with a little screech. He reaches into the cavity and retrieves a rusty metal box with a key sticking out. “It’s like our own safety deposit, John. No one would ever think to look here, and even if they did, we have the key.”
like it, he thinks. It’s ownership. No one else could call him those things without getting slapped. It means they belong to each other. Yes, yes, he would like that very much.
- but. God, Sherlock, I am still. I’m not. Shit, I’m sorry - this is really hard for me. I haven’t had sex with someone who wasn’t - you know - in years. And I just.”
"Ouch!" Sherlock shoves at his face, now alight with laughter, and bends a long leg up to kick at his arse.
“He is, yeah.” Pride swells fierce in Sherlock’s chest. Mycroft has advanced at the Ministry faster than any witch or wizard in a century.
“Oh. I know a lot of things. Useful things.” James drops his gaze momentarily and then looks up quickly, focusing his obsidian eyes on Sherlock’s. “Remember, old buddy?”
He’d learned to drive. He knew the transit system in America was shite, and with what he was going to be doing, he knew it was critical to be able to drive. Fast.
"It’s a psychological game, John. For now, anyway. And we have people in the buildings all around you. You’re being watched very closely.”
“Right. Nothing.” John leans back in the creased and worn seat, stretching his legs out under the table.
He flushed, looking somewhat embarrassed, and shrugged. “The bed didn’t seem half as welcoming without you in it.”
He realises with the sharp awareness that can only happen alone in one’s kitchen in the middle of the night that he’s
It’s impossible to feel any panic about it with John’s overheated languid body snugged against him, the sound of the rain dripping steadily off the eaves. He can’t remember the last time he was so comfortable, so relaxed.
He wonders briefly if it's actually possible to have a stroke from anger, as every vein in his head throbs and his heart hammers against its cage.
Sherlock is sobbing quietly, rolling his head from side to side. His knuckles are white, fingernails scraping into the headboard.
“You’re Mycroft Holmes’ brother.” Lily Potter looks at him approvingly. “My dad says he’s brilliant.”
Once they've both made quick work of the lasagna, Sherlock clears away the empty plates and pours them both more wine. Wine’s always had a different effect on John than liquor or beer. Wine makes him loose tongued, pleasantly slow-witted. He’s not quite there yet, but he’s on the edge of tipsy. Sherlock’s long fingers are tracing patterns on the inside of his wrist, the kitchen is still overly warm from the oven, and his belly is perfectly full.
John’s eyes fell closed again, too much effort to keep them open. Everything was edged in white fuzz, as if the room and his mind had both been padded with cotton. His ears were full, couldn’t hear properly.
He hurried to catch up, falling in step beside John and threading their fingers together as they crossed the dew-slippery grass. John’s palm was warm and smooth against his own icy one. Sherlock tightened his grip, just a quick squeeze of flesh and bone, their knuckles bumping. John’s eyes flicked up to meet Sherlock’s and he smiled knowingly.
“I could definitely slip. I could lose my balance.” John stretches up and presses a kiss in the hollow of Sherlock’s throat, rubs his nose in a little circle against the softness of his earlobe.
“You’re amazing. So amazing. I am the luckiest man in the world, Sherlock.” He breathed out his own slight anxiety, and dragged the tip of the scalpel across Sherlock’s arm with his skilled surgeon’s fingers. He felt the skin give underneath the blade, Sherlock sucked in a breath and held it. John pulled the blade away, watching as the blood beaded to the surface, slowly at first, then more quickly, beginning to run down the curves of Sherlock’s arm.
The scent of basil and garlic, savory and deep, rouses John from a dreamless slumber. The bedroom is bathed in an orange glow, the sun setting outside. He rolls to his back, mouth feeling thick and sticky, his skin greasy. All the alcohol leaving his system.
John says nothing, just jerks his head back and searches Sherlock’s face. His eyes are shining, half a smile on his lips. He shakes his head in disbelief.
“I’m going to tell you something, and you’ll probably be completely disgusted with me when I’m done. I'm disgusted with myself. But, this...what we do...what we’ve always fucking done - lying to each other, keeping things from each other - it ends now. I won’t do it anymore, and you won’t either. It’s all or nothing.” John’s voice caught, and he looked at Sherlock, smoke billowing out of his nostrils. “And I can’t live with nothing.”
John pushes Sherlock’s shirt up roughly, still kissing him, and circles his nipples with his thumbs. He bites at Sherlock’s upper lip and grinds his pelvis down. “Come on, Sherlock.
“No, John. I apologise.” Sherlock turned around and crossed the space between them in just two long strides, sank to his knees between John's legs and laid his cheek against the inside of his thigh. Somewhat breathlessly, "You could correct me for being late...only if you think it necessary."
“Don’t worry, darling, you can showcase your prowess in other areas very shortly.” John turned on him with dark eyes and flashed a predatory smile that sent a shiver down Sherlock's spine.
"Yeah, just...stronger than I'm used to." John wipes his mouth firmly, and Sherlock doesn't question him further.
"What an eager little lass." John hummed against his chest as he took Sherlock's left nipple into his mouth and sucked. Sherlock cried out, pulses of pleasure tearing down his spine, his hips aching to roll, to grind against John's. John held him down, lapped at the hard flesh in his mouth, scraped his teeth against it not quite hard enough to hurt. His fingers slipped over the edge of Sherlock's pyjama bottoms, brushing teasingly through soft black curls and down over his bollocks before circling back up and closing around his leaking prick. Sherlock thrashed and whined as John thumbed at the slit and sucked kisses across Sherlock's chest, "Oh, Christ, so wet for me already. So wet and ready."
Sherlock shuffles forward awkwardly on his knees, and John has a flash of himself last week, struggling to spread his knees as Sherlock wanted him to, while his jeans were bunched tightly around his ankles. The exquisite shame of that, the desperate need to please. Sherlock really was brilliant in orchestrating that to show John how it feels, the complicated nature of being a sub, how profoundly satisfying it can be to feel entirely at someone else's whim.
"I, ah, also had some rearranging done. I asked Mrs Hudson if she could -- Just a little. Just your clothes, really. Oh, and I think she had the neighbours move your side table down from your old room."
"Well, I'm going to leave you boys to it. I'll be downstairs if you need anything. There's a bit of food in the kitchen, I popped down to the shop when I knew you'd be coming. Nothing fancy, but enough for breakfast tomorrow. There's a telly in the bedroom closet, but I'm afraid I don't know if it works anymore. Sheets and towels in the loo." She picks up the tray and Sherlock holds the door open for her. Just as he begins to close the door, she turns with a barely concealed smile and a twinkle in her eye, "My sitting room is right under your bedroom. Just so you know."
“Sorry, couldn’t help it.” John ducks under Sherlock’s arm, twists and starts walking backwards, grinning and pulling Sherlock along by his fingers. “I want to have fun with you tonight, okay? Laugh and drink and see you dance.”
The rat nips reprimandingly at Sherlock’s index finger, but withdraws his claws, settling down once again against Sherlock’s neck with a low squeak.
I shut my eyes against the intensity of his gaze and inhaled deeply, squirming on his lap and trying to work myself closer. He sank lower in the chair, allowing his legs to drift open so that my arse sank down slightly between his thighs. Both of his hands now settled at my waist and he rocked me back and forth ever so slightly.
Once he’s gotten his cappuccino, they head back outside, where the pavement is marked with fat splotches of rain. The clouds above are pitch black. Alchemy shivers against Sherlock’s nape, snuggles closer.
"Yes, I quite agree. You're still recovering physically, and emotionally it's been a difficult morning. Also, you'll have some jet lag, I expect, after being in America so long. " Sherlock tucked the blankets over him, and patted his leg. "Sleep, John."
were good people?" Sherlock can't stop himself. No one ever thinks good of him anymore. No one except John.
"Irene?" He has to ask. It seems the right moment, though he feels his body tensing already anticipating the answer.
John coming - the warm pulse of semen inside him, the way John’s cock gets stiffer, wider. He throws his head back and
There's something. Something rough and bumpy and unexpected, as John's fingers slide over the curve of Sherlock's shoulder blade. Sherlock stills, going tense under John's hands.
“Tattoos tomorrow?” John realised they’d not drawn the blood needed to mix with that tattoo ink, the vials were still empty. They'd have to do that in the morning.
John runs his fingertips slowly up and down the back of Sherlock’s neck and up into his hair just the way he likes, the way he’s done hundreds of times laying in their bed with Sherlock next to him still naked and gulping air, neck covered in bruises from John’s hungry mouth.
Sherlock's apology is cut short by John's striding across the space between them, throwing the note on the floor. He grabs Sherlock in a fierce embrace, his face buried in Sherlock's neck. Sherlock's so stunned, he doesn't even hug John back. He just stands there, blinking, staring at the fireplace.
John’s forearm lays bracingly across his lower belly, keeping him still. With a gentle slide of lips, he draws Sherlock back into his mouth and settles flat between his legs. He sucks and sucks and
about you. Poor Sherlock. Poor messed up Sherlock who needs John to feed him and bathe him and treat him like a goddamned baby. It's never about John.
But I see sadness in your eyes sometimes that you won’t talk about. I’ve touched the scars on your back, I’ve kissed them with my mouth and my tears, and I still don’t know how you got them. You won’t tell me. We don’t talk about
"Yes." Sherlock already looks transcendent, even in the awkward position John's got him twisted into. His right cheek is pressed into the sheets with his arms cuffed together behind his back, his eyes wide and glassy, mouth parted, his tongue running along his lips repeatedly. John's never seen him quite like this. So wholly submitted to John's control.
you. I would die without you, just simply cease to be. There would be nothing left of me without you.
, who looks more peaceful and contented than Sherlock’s ever seen him. John’s shoulders are bare, scratch marks from Sherlock’s nails still pink across his pale skin. Sherlock stops long enough to tuck the blankets up over him. John hums and curls his arm into his chest, smiling in his sleep.
There’s a sudden rustling behind him, and the mattress dips and bounces. An icy nose touches between his shoulder blades.
During this whole rapid fire exchange, John’s eyes never left the man’s face. Nor did the man break eye contact with John. There lived behind this man’s calm brown eyes a menace that was all too familiar. This man would do someone harm without batting an eye, without remorse, and he would do it well. This was a man who would eviscerate someone without breaking a sweat. He would melt into the background, a face no one would remember, if he wanted to. Far from making John nervous, there was a burgeoning respect for a man who was bristling with danger, but only if someone knew how to look for it. It was the kind of man John had become.
“Necessary to be such a dick about it, Sherlock?” John looked up at him and grinned, something that was happening more often now. Those first days had been nothing but weeping and apologies, confessions and desperate kisses. While the desperate kissing showed no sign of abating, they were starting to regain some of who they’d been before. Some banter, a bit of hesitant teasing. John’s fragility lessened with each passing day, sometimes almost by the hour, the light and warmth slowly returning to his face. He’d gained some weight, eating hospital food and being sedentary, looked more like the John Sherlock remembered.
I slowed my ministrations, wrapping my fingers tightly around the base of him, and adjusted my position so that I could more easily touch his bollocks with my other hand. They were beautifully heavy, their fullness in my palm evidence of our five day separation. I pressed them up against the root of his cock, rolling them simultaneously against my chin and bottom lip, and John shook and cursed. I withdrew, drawing my lips purposefully up his length, and lapped at the swollen wet tip of him.
He’s got over five hours until he’s due to meet with Mycroft. His eyes feel heavy, and he decides a nap can’t hurt. He sets his alarm for 2:45am, and sleepily pulls the blankets over himself, letting Alchemy make a nest of his hair as it spreads against the pillow.
No moustache. That’s strange. No. Wait. That’s not strange. John only had a moustache while Sherlock was gone. Sherlock made him shave it, it was awful. There was
Silently I handed him the ring, and he solemnly slid it down over the ring finger of my right hand. Wearing it on my left would be too obvious.
"Fine." Sherlock threw himself flat on his back, purposefully bouncing the mattress and twisting the blankets half off of John.
look at him this way, Sherlock realises. Just as intimate, just as possessive - just not twined together in Sherlock’s bed.
"That's a nice name. Solid. And you are?” She looks at him questioningly, but gently. What has he ever done to deserve people like this?
a difference, but. I both love you and am horrifically, helplessly, and some other word I can’t think of right now, in love with you. I’m so in love with you I can’t stand it sometimes.” John isn’t good at this kind of thing, and words begin to fail him, so he just pulls Sherlock’s huge knobbly knuckled hands up to his mouth and kisses them. “Okay?”
Sherlock watched his blonde head bobbing along between the trees, and wondered what on earth he’d unleashed by insisting that they come here. Scotland was associated with happy memories for John, but also with his father and the unhappy childhood John rarely discussed or even allowed himself to think about. He’d said more than once that his life before Sherlock didn’t even feel like his own, that it hardly even felt real. Sherlock knew John well enough to understand that was only partially the truth.
It was nothing like it would have been with Sherlock. It never was. With Sherlock it would have been soft petting, and lips brushed lovingly together, Sherlock sighing into his mouth as John whispered ‘I love you.’ It would have been desperate and intense, them up against the wall in the hallway, fumbling at each other’s belts and laughing, clutching their hands together as they came. It would have been Sherlock’s face against John’s jeans, smiling up at him with heavy lidded eyes, saying “Come on, John, come to bed.” It would have been beautiful.
right. John very nearly feels at home in his own skin again - his belly full of Mrs Hudson’s cooking, his jumpers and jeans folded tidily in their -
I shifted uncomfortably on the hard leather seat of the hansom, sighing with impatience. The journey from Waterloo Station to Baker Street had never felt so intolerably long.
“I know, lovely, I know,” John grins, knowingly, full of affection, and Sherlock has the strangest sensation that they’ve had this exact exchange many, many times before now.
“Molly? Girlfriend?” John doesn’t look jealous, merely curious, the sparkly purple heart laying in his palm, a strand of Molly’s hair still stuck in it.
The case takes a week for Sherlock to solve. It feels longer. Sherlock gets terminally frustrated with himself, refusing tea, sex, sleep. He puffs on that damn pipe incessantly, filling the flat with smoke. He hasn’t been like this on a case in years. By the end of the week, John’s bursting at the seams, his jaw clenched so tight his teeth hurt.
Sherlock swallowed the hundred vitriolic comments that were rising in his throat. “It’s John, Mycroft. Please. I wouldn’t ask for anyone else.”
Then soft lips are moving up the column of his throat, mouthing wet over his jaw, as John’s arms drape over his shoulders. John’s lips meet his with a slow, deep slide, nothing but tongue and wet heat and Sherlock kisses him back with abandon, weak with desire and teetering on the knife’s edge of orgasm.
The book had been filled with pictures of John as a teenager, ticket stubs from concerts, a few programs from plays, scrawled notes passed under desks, interspersed with a few pictures of Harry, red haired and surly in Doc Martens and ripped jeans. John was golden and muscular, shining white teeth and rugby jerseys. Pictures filled with other boys who looked much the same, all piled together and grinning at themselves, at the ease of their joy - a tourney win, a girl to snog in the back of a car, a few pints with the lads - their lives so careless and untroubled.
Sherlock listens to the slap slap of John's bare feet on the floor, the rattle of the fridge opening, thinking that John's idea of spending the whole Sunday in bed really was rather brilliant. By the time John returns with a tray stacked with sandwiches and glasses of water, Sherlock's read the introduction and is thoroughly ensconced in the first chapter. John hands him a sandwich and settles back against the headboard, wiggling his feet in time to the soft music, and getting crumbs all over the sheets.
He shifts and slides up onto the sofa next to John. John's all over him the second they're at eye level, pulling Sherlock's face to his own, biting at his lower lip and nibbling down his jaw. Sherlock doesn't argue this time, allows John to slip his hand under the waistband of his jeans, pop the button open with his thumb. He raises his hips and wriggles until they're pushed down tight against his thighs. John's gasping against his mouth as he teases his fingers inside Sherlock's soft cotton pants and trails them over the hardness he finds there. Sherlock's breath catches in his chest, tight with affection and the ache of regret at what he has to do tonight.
John wandered into the kitchen, and absentmindedly opened the fridge, pulled out one of the expensive micro brewed brown ales that Sherlock had surprised him with as a gift the day before, and flopped down on the sofa. He set his phone on his thigh and flipped on the telly. Some rerun of Top Gear. Perfect. Mindless and funny, something to keep his mind occupied without much effort until Sherlock got home. He sat down and wiggled, clenching his arse muscles and adjusting himself in his jeans. He’d been half hard and waiting for hours. It was beginning to become more than a little tedious.
Sherlock wraps his free hand around the back of John’s head and holds him there, licks at the seam of his closed lips. He can feel John smiling, the little shake of his head.
." John leaned up and pulled Sherlock's head round for a deep kiss, and then drifted softer kisses over his jaw and neck as he laid back down, "Goodnight, you ridiculous beautiful thing."
“I hope Adrian didn’t give you lads too much trouble. He’s new, see. Feels like he’s got to prove himself or some such shite. He’s alright, really. Just comes off as a bit of a prick at first.” She gave them a conspiratorial wink and pulled a tattered crimson notebook from her pocket.
John strokes down Sherlock’s face with his thumb, pleased at how calm and peaceful he is, how easily he’s capitulated to everything John’s told him to do. Some days it’s still not easy for Sherlock to cede control, especially during a case.
"I mean it. We will find her." John presses a hard kiss to Sherlock's mouth and smooths his fringe from his forehead. "You love her, and I love you, and so it's important to me."
As he's putting on the coffee and popping bread in the toaster, he remembers to text Greg. Now that Sherlock's fed and rested, they should get back to The Yard ASAP. The potential price of Sherlock's mental stability, the fact that the killer could have struck again while they've been peacefully sleeping, isn't lost on John.
“Sherlock,” John whispered my name again, drawing out the vowel, cradling the L sound on the tip of his tongue. “Do you know? Do you know how you affect me, what you do to me?”
Sherlock clinked his glass against John's, smiled back, and took a long sip that burned down his throat and made his eyes water. John knocked back the rest of his drink in one go, and shook his head briskly. He set his empty glass down and slowly reached up to cup Sherlock's jaw in his hand. His thumb rubbed gently over Sherlock's lower lip, and Sherlock couldn't help but flick his tongue out to catch the tip of it, calloused and rough and wonderfully familiar. He had whole rooms in his mind palace for this, to catalogue the taste of John's skin, of his mouth - how his skin was muskier in the morning, or here in the moist mountain air by the loch, saltier than usual. John moaned softly and Sherlock closed his eyes, dipped his head forward and took John's whole thumb into his mouth.
"Mmmm. Bags can wait. We're not in London, no one's going to nick them." John voice was half lost in the hollow between Sherlock's collarbone and his throat. Warm lips traced up over Sherlock's jaw with just enough suction to make his eyes roll back in his head as his breath hitched.
“John. I’m so sorry I put you through all of this, and that you have carried such a burden. You’ve done nothing wrong. I’m not angry at you, I’m not disgusted. At all. I’m a bit flattered, now that I think about it.”
He chuckled darkly to himself and pulled a pack of Marlboros out of his pocket, tapped the pack against his hand and took one between his lips. He reflected back on the number of people who had been at the wrong end of his fists in the last year. He didn’t even recognise himself sometimes anymore. That was alright. John Watson died with Sherlock Holmes. With one sickening crack of bone against the kerb, everything he had been or had wanted to be sputtered out like a wet flame.
John nods, looks down at their hands clasped together and back up at Sherlock. “Yeah. I just, um. This meant a lot to me, doing this with you. I don’t know, it felt...like
“Alright, sweetheart. Just calm down.” She pulls a flip phone out of her purse. “I’ll call. You go back and see how he’s doing, alright?”
“Can we?” Sherlock knew he sounded like a wheedling child, trying to get an extra sweet out of an indulgent parent.
"She said it's important to be honest." John presses his mouth to Sherlock's throat. Sherlock shivers against him, reaches his hand up and takes a drag, blows smoke over John's head. John kisses him again, under his jaw. "To - to tell each other how we really feel." Mouth over Sherlock's ear lobe, pulling. The barest scrape of teeth. Sherlock breathes out hard and presses his hand into the curve of John's spine. "So. I'm telling you how I feel. I want you. I've always wanted you. I've wanted you since the fucking second I laid eyes on you. I thought I lost you. I thought I lost you without you knowing." He trails his tongue over the stubble at the corner of Sherlock's mouth. "I don't know what's going to happen from here, and I don't want to wait
“Well, I’ll have to stop doing things like that, then.” Sherlock lowered his lashes and looked up at John.
"Good." Sherlock finished making his notation, primly closed the notebook and slipped it back in his jacket pocket. He sipped his wine again and nodded at John's half eaten pasta. "Aren’t you going to finish eating?”
A sob rose up in Sherlock’s throat at the sight of John in a grey jumper striding across the parking lot of a run down motel. He was lean, beautiful. His hair so different, in little messy spikes. He was so thin. Thinner than Sherlock had ever seen him. His cheekbones stood out, his square jaw more prominent than ever. Even in these distant photos, those deep blue eyes looked bigger, taking over his face.
Sherlock rounds on John, and the moment their eyes meet, they dissolve into raucous guffaws. John still looks pale and has dark circles around his eyes, but his laugh sets his face alight with that captivating golden glow. Like a sunrise sparkling across the surface of running water. Sherlock has to touch him, has to have their bodies connected at as many points as possible. It's been far too long. He sinks to the floor and folds himself between John's legs, still laughing.
have a romantic relationship. Beyond kisses on the cheek and warm arms around his back. The realisation dredges up something complicated within him - regret for what he and John
“Good.” His fingertips trailed down my spine and he rested his face against my chest, his soft warm cock pressed against my thigh. It was the most intimate and tender embrace we had ever shared. He cleared his throat. “I have another present, actually. One I’ve been keeping from you for some time. I hope you’ll forgive me if I wasn’t ready to share it with you before now.”
Sherlock peeled off his trousers and button down and put them in the hamper on top of John’s jeans. His pyjamas were still laying across the bottom of the made bed, where he’d left them that morning. He pulled them on, and dragged his warmest dressing gown over top. He laid down beside John, careful not to jostle the mattress too much. John rolled again, this time to face Sherlock. Their knees bumped, and his eyelids fluttered open briefly.
“You’re as pale as a summer moon, Holmes, my god.” John rushes to Sherlock’s side and takes his elbow, easing him back down onto the sofa. He kneels again, eyes soft and warm, full of an easy affection that Sherlock has only caught glimpses of before. He reaches up and brushes his knuckles tenderly along Sherlock’s cheekbone, “You’re worrying me, my boy.”
“I know. I will answer every question you ask me, John. I promise.” Sherlock held John’s chin between his index finger and thumb and searched those blue eyes he’d been dreaming about for two years. They were bright with emotion. Sherlock couldn’t tell what John was thinking. “Will you answer me one?”
Sherlock’s coat is still puddled on the floor just inside the door, where he must have shaken it off before climbing into his chair and assuming his customary thinking pose. The sight of him squatting there, socked feet curled over the lip of the cushion, elbows tucked between his bent knees, his eyes fixed on things John can’t see, is the most comforting and familiar thing John can imagine.
Sherlock nodded and followed John across the water, assiduously treading in his footsteps, but still slipping several times on the slick green stones. By the time they were on dry land again, scarcely a minute later, the cuffs of Sherlock’s trousers were sodden and cold and there was a conspicuous dampness round the tops of his socks.
"No. No, I'm sorry. Look, I'll, I'll do whatever you want, Jim. I'll come back. You want me back, I'll..."
He turns to Sherlock with that blazing look he’s given him back at Jim’s place. “Well, then let’s go dancing, Sherlock.”
." John finally opens his eyes, looks at Sherlock in profile, the perfect pout of his lips, the aquiline nose, prominent brow. So beautiful, so unaware of it. John's always wants to tell him, tell him how he takes his breath away sometimes, how many hours he's spent just watching his pulse flickering in the graceful curve of his neck. Tell him that if there's one person.
it. He makes an involuntary noise that prompts John to half turn round, one side of his face cast in grey, one side lit rosy by the fire.
Twenty minutes later, they’re half jogging down Blandford Street, John warming his hands with a thermos of far too strong coffee. Sherlock is a bundle of nervous energy, twitchy and unsettled. John furrows and sips his coffee, watches Sherlock out of the corner of his eye.
Sherlock laughs, cold and sharp, and crushes a piece of mug under his bare foot. He's got to have cut himself, but he doesn't even wince. "Oh really? I didn't start this, John.
John laughed a little, as Sherlock had hoped he would, and squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “Don’t go far, okay?”
John pulls back and looks at him, runs his hand down to his waist. It's all knotted skin and raised lines. Sherlock's eyes are wide and worried.
“What on earth is an owl doing delivering the post at one in the morning?” Molly says curiously, making no move to actually let the owl in.
Now they’re here, with John’s perfect lithe little body spread out beside him, and far too many unwelcome thoughts rushing confusedly through his fatigued mind, and all he can do is peel his clothes off and clumsily crawl up over John’s back, kiss at his shoulders and the nape of his neck, and breathe him in. He smells like fresh air and tobacco smoke.
“You. God, you. I don’t know if I can keep pretending you’re a virgin if you keep doing things like that, you filthy wonderful thing.” John breathed out, his chest going concave with how hard he was breathing. Sherlock could see his pulse thumping in his neck.
This time it’s John dragging Sherlock back to the dance floor. Sherlock’s head is swimming pleasantly, the room buzzing a bit, the crush of bodies getting tighter as more and more people fill up the club. It's one heaving thrum. The air smells like sweat and sex, damp clean hair, alcohol and cologne. Sherlock’s sweating like hell, rivulets running down his spine and the sides of his face, lost in the rhythm, head lolling backwards. John’s hands snake inside Sherlock's shirt, fingertips exploring every ridge of bone, sliding in his perspiration. John's palms graze over his nipples, the moan Sherlock makes in response lost in the noise of the club.
“This is insane, we’re insane.” John husked out, arching his back under Sherlock’s clawing fingernails. “Oh, baby, I...I can’t...I can’t always be for you, what you need me to be."
“Ah. It’s nice to be home.” John sinks down into the sofa, automatically reaching behind him to adjust the throw pillow. His head still feels overly tight, and he rubs hard at his brow, trying to ease some of the tension.
"I would like that, John." Sherlock's voice quivering, muffled against the sheets, his knees sliding ever farther apart, even as he struggles to stay up.
"Harder." Sherlock pants, his chest and neck a violent shade of mottled red, his legs locked almost painfully tight around John's ribs. "
." Sherlock lifts up a forest green double strap collar, butter soft leather, and suede lined, a large silver ring shining at the center. He strokes it with his fingertips, turns it and holds it up against the light, examining it from every angle.
"What on earth did you think you were doing, coming here? Were you going to catch me out? Turn me into the police? You know they don't give a single fuck, Sherlock." Jim sighs exasperatedly and flops back on the sofa. "I'm just not in the mood for this tonight."
“Sherlock. Stop. Take a breath. It’s okay. I just need some rest, alright?” As John’s speaking, Sherlock’s eyes flick to a stop and bore into John’s, his hands twisting worriedly together over his sternum. “Come here.”
He typed slowly, hovering over send for at least a full minute before he heard Lester coming down the steps and quickly touched his finger to the screen.
?” John kisses at Sherlock’s temple, the only part of him he can reach, gets a mouthful of black curls. He laughs, because it’s all so tragically absurd. They can’t have more than a few seconds left now.
John's hands fall naturally to the top of Sherlock's head, fingers working gently through his curls. Sherlock lays his cheek alongside the inside of John's thigh and rubs a bit, feeling like a contented cat - well-fed and petted. They stay like that as their laughter fades away, wrapped together, Sherlock's long body curled into the outlines of John's much smaller one. John's fingers wander down to play with the helix of Sherlock's ear, the curls at the nape of his neck.
in my hand, not some damned condom." Warm soft lips trail over Sherlock's Adam's apple, down to his collarbone.
The flat goes dead silent, the only sounds their ragged breathing and the familiar tick of the mantle clock. Both of them stock still, bodies tensed. Ready for a brawl. John can't stop shivering.
He honestly doesn’t know. He opens his mouth several times, gaping like a fish, before he can conjure up any words.
John’s phone buzzed, still in his jeans folded on the chair. He stretched his hand toward it, IV lines trailing on the sheets. "Can you? I just want to see.”
A million mornings of takeaway coffees from Speedy's. John pressing Sherlock up against the flowered wallpaper, warm hands under his shirt. Mrs Hudson over for Christmas dinner, the three of them sharing pudding and hot toddies in front of the fireplace. Greg stomping up the steps with a case at all hours of the day and night. John reaching into the bedside drawer to get two small black jewelry boxes, his stomach muscles twisting under Sherlock's hands.
“Yes, daddy.” Sherlock smirks, the mood between them somehow light and flirtatious, despite everything. This bedroom, this flat, there’s a magic here, made of clear morning light and the smell of fresh coffee and warm bread - it’s impossible to not feel at least a little bit safe.
John immediately feels the kind of white hot anger he hasn't felt since he was a quick tempered rowdy teenager, and wants to punch in the teeth of anyone who was allowed to touch Sherlock this way and had the audacity to not tell him how perfect and gorgeous he was while they were doing it.
A chorus of voices erupt in agreement, and a wave of relief sweeps over Sherlock as Hugo begins shuffling the deck. He’s not going to be forced into conversation with everyone.
Sherlock was leaning up against the cold windows, hands templed over his mouth. John had just returned from a CT scan and an x-ray of his ribs, and was sitting upright in the bed with a cup of coffee from the hospital cafeteria. He sipped it, casting glances over at Sherlock as the doctor spoke. It was as if he expected Sherlock to disappear in a cloud of smoke at any second.
He’s compact, not powerfully built - slim but sturdy. His shoulders are square and broad, curving up into a strong thick neck. His back muscles ripple as he walks, shoulder blades smooth and beautifully shaped, underneath them a gently inward curve at his waist, that invitingly lickable back ending in two perfect dimples at the base of his spine. He's wearing black combat boots and there's a tattoo on his right bicep that's definitely military, though he's too far away to make out the details.
These were questions he couldn’t even fathom the existence of. Sherlock could NOT be alive. He’s seen his broken body. Been to his funeral.
, if he’s being honest about it. Sob loudly. A desperate, unbound noise like he’s never heard himself make before. Because he’s vaguely frightened, frankly, and more than a bit lost, but even in the midst of this hallucination? dream? - John’s lips are at his cheek, warm and soft and tender, and Sherlock
"John," Sherlock croaks out, his voice strained as John pulls his head back and bites at his throat.
Sherlock slides quickly down John's back, his knees bumping John's calves, sliding his fingers out of him and replacing them with his tongue. He pushes at the inside of John's thighs, and John spreads his knees wider, his cock twitching against his stomach. He tries desperately hard not to make a sound as Sherlock sucks at him and thrusts his tongue in quick dirty jabs. Sherlock licks all the way up to the small of his back as he stands up, stopping only when he reaches the hem of John's jacket, and then he's draping over him, one arm stretching out over John's to brace himself against the wall, and the other guiding his cock slowly inside. "Oh god, you're tight, Jesus, John."
Greg feels like he's going to be sick as Sherlock moves away from him. He takes a few sips of coffee while Mrs. Holmes natters on about noting in particular.
“You’re the one who just had me fuck him over the hood of his expensive car.” He teases. “You like it when I’m naughty.”
Lydia nods. “Maggie is smart. She can help. And if she can’t then she’ll know someone who can. It’ll be okay.” She smiles.
“Hello, Mike. Long time no see.” Theodora grins and walks to his desk, sitting down in one of the chairs.
Sherlock wolf whistles and giggles as he massages her stomach as it grows under his hands. “Look how big you are.” He chuckles.
He moans as his hair is pulled, his cock spurting as his prostate is hit. “Fuck, fuck. Harder. Use me.”
**Christ, I wish I could come over there and finish you off.. Suck you off and have you come down my throat. I'm sure you would taste amazing.. --MH**
"Mm I could see that.. The way John was so cold to him. I've never seen John like that before.. Plus I've had my own experiences with dangerous men.. It becomes second nature to tell if someone's the right sort or not.." She sighs and sits at the table.
“You do?” She asks, a broad smile of her face. “Can you take anymore?” She asks, slowly pushing her arm further into Morna.
At first she blamed the drinking on the death of her parents, though she knew it was a lie. Still, people accepted that, and left her alone to wallow.
"And I told you, they call you that so they have a reason to not be around you. It's their utter loss." John put the coffee on the bench.
She blushes shyly and kisses him back lovingly, sucking on his tongue gently. ‘You treat me so good, Daddy..’ She mumbles. ‘Letting me have all the cock I want. Making sure my body is ready to take it. You’ve had me pumped full of cum all night so you could be sure I could take it, didn’t you?’
Mycroft lays him down onto the bed and pulls him closer. He kisses him tenderly and rubs his back. "You did so good, bee.. You're so beautiful.."
He starts to pick up the pace, soon pounding into her. The head of his cock hits her cervix with each thrust. “That’s right. You were made to take Daddy’s cock. Made to be bred by Daddy.”
“My profession is fairly dangerous, so I visited the clinic John works at often. I was never subtle with my advances and for a while I didn’t think he would ever reciprocate. But I came in one night after a particularly close call, I had gotten shot, John was so very worried as I was going in and out of consciousness. He stayed by my side until he was sure I was alright. I believe while I was coming out of the anesthetic that I apologized for burdening him since I’m always in there. I could tell he was crying at this point, though at the time I was unaware why. He shook his head and laughed through the tears, calling me a bastard and telling me to shut up before kissing me.”
David smirks as all the men finish, the strays stepping up next, fighting over who gets to fuck her.
“Yes? You want to watch and feel my belly swell with your babies?” She purrs and presses his hands to her belly. “Want to see and touch my breasts as they fill with milk to feed your babies?” She moves his hands up to her breasts, letting him play with them.
“Ah... Sherlock... your coat?” John asks. Sherlock was behaving very strangely. And John started to worry. He had been waiting for the other shoe to drop, for Sherlock to finally snap.
"Easy, baby." Dean rubs his thumb over his cheek. "I'm sorry. I should have been paying better attention."
“I like it. It’s spur of the moment and you look gorgeous.” Greg smiles happily, slipping his phone back in his pocket continuing to walk with him.
“What’s the prognosis?” Mycroft asked from behind his brother, listening intently. “Will he make a full recovery?”
John nods and hums. “I understand. I just want to make sure you’re happy and healthy.” He says softly, closing his eyes.
After everything is put away Sherlock hears Mrs. Hudson’s familiar footsteps on the stairs. “Yoo-hoo! Boys? Are you decent?” She calls.
She follows him and takes the test. "I can't look. You'll have to look." She bites her lip after they finish waiting for the results.
He frowns a bit and does so. "I don't see how this will help. You can't possibly know how to turn this on."
Chloe pulls Mel’s hips down more and pushes her tongue into her cunt. Mel moans and arches, sucking in her clit.
'Michael, love. I need you to listen to me very carefully. I need you to stay in bed no matter what you're about to hear. Stay there with Jean until I tell you to move.' Sky hums in Michael's head as the intruder creeps closer to Michael's room.
"Just four months. I didn't know I was pregnant at the time. Sherlock wouldn't tell me why he kept looking at me funny."
Sherlock has ordered a butter curry, aromas of ginger and coconut rise up and make his mouth water. They divvy out the food, John taking a bit more Naan, and Sherlock extra rice.
He limped a little heavier, his shoulders slumped as he tried not to let any tears well up. Sherlock had gone all out for this guy. He must really be something. It was a bit overwhelming and John needed to get out of there before he embarrassed himself.
