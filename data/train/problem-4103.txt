“Come to bed when you feel up to the journey,” Dean teased.
Castiel’s face fell. He didn’t need to hear a name. He nodded once, lips twisting into something sour as the grace pulsed through his body once more. Jack stepped around the corner into the library and over to the table, settling the box between where Castiel sat and Sam stood.
“Sorta, yeah,” said Sam. “Me and Jack are reading up on archangels. Ways to kill them without the blade. Rowena’s looking for a third portal failsafe.”
“Why isn’t he moving?”
Castiel’s breath caught, and he whipped around to the hunter most directly in his line of sight—Claire, as it were. “She’s not casting a spell,” he growled, voice echoing across the room. “She is the—”
The last thing Dean saw was Castiel rising, closing in on him like a rabid animal, and a pair of bright blue eyes looking into his as if he were a stranger.
“Don’t we need some kind of—I don’t know. Officiant?”
“We’re here,” said Cas, and his heart began to beat again.
“What’s your specialty?”
The water was a little rougher as it neared its breaking point at the shore, and the struggle to stay upright and graceful made Dean feel suddenly awkward about his nakedness. When he was close enough to Castiel to speak, he called out, “M’like a freakin’ baby deer out here, Cas,” and then in an instant he was whisked to solid ground, the water lapping gently at the backs of his ankles. “Alright then,” he mumbled when the shock wore off.
Sam stared at him for a moment, then looked over to Jack, who’d shrunk backwards away from Dean’s words. “It’s okay, Jack. Can you bring some bandages with the ice? Do you know where the first aid kit is, in the—”
Song: Bette Davis Eyes
A restlessness hung over the hotel room like a heavy cloud, full of nervous static and weight.
“He lied.”
“Cas—” Sam called from behind, his own voice choked in his throat.
“So what does that mean?” demanded Dean. “You’re an archangel now?”
“So do I,” said Castiel, leaning in to kiss the words from Dean’s mouth.
Once inside, he closed the door gently behind him and locked it for good measure. He set the mortar and pestle down on his desk and drew in a deep breath, wiping his palms, which had grown suddenly sweaty, on his jeans while he went in search of a piece of Castiel. It didn’t take him too long—within a few minutes, he found a single, dark hair stuck to one of the pillowcases on the bed. Something about it made his heart lurch. Dean twirled it between his thumb and forefinger, watched the light glint down the thin strand, and wondered when this particular piece had been shaken loose. Maybe it had just come out naturally in sleep; maybe it had broken free one of the hundreds of times Dean ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair in the morning, or while his lover slept, or while they were tangled up in each other, lost to the rest of the world. Dean decided he preferred the latter. It gave him some kind of agency, a hint of control, and he strode across to the desk and dropped it gingerly atop the herbs in the bowl.
“No kidding,” said Sam, laughing a little.
“No,” said Dean. “Where we going?”
Castiel grunted low as he struggled to stand with Sam’s help, and staggered awkwardly to collapse in his chair beside the table.
“Yeah,” said Dean. He exhaled slowly. “You still mad at me?”
All three men immediately turned and gripped their weapons, suddenly again on high alert. The slow click of heels echoed through the room, and out of the shadows stepped a small, red-haired woman in a long black dress. Rowena smiled and held up a small vial that emanated a bright, silver-blue light.
“It’s not that,” grumbled Dean.
“Don’t,” said Castiel softly, shaking his head. He in turn moved towards Dean. “I shouldn’t have gone without telling you.”
“Dude, what the
SAMMY [9:48 AM]: Quit being an idiot and come back. Or at least call me.
“Maybe I am,” answered Castiel, canting his head.
Cas tilted his head and thumbed over Dean’s cheekbones. “Well, that’s impossible,” he said. “I’m right here and pretty pleasantly occupied.”
He set the thermometer aside and slipped his arm back into its hold around Castiel’s chest and let his head drop into the angel’s hair with a sigh. “Should be awake by now,” he grumbled, and then sighed again. “You asked for it. Last Beatles song. …Oh, darling, if you leave me, I’ll never make it—wait, no,” Dean began to tiredly sing, then cut himself off. “Rookie move, Winchester. Wrong verse.” He cleared his throat and said, “My bad, Cas,” before starting over through chattering teeth, “Oh, darling, please believe me, I’ll never—”
“What?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean pulled away and squeezed Castiel’s hand, turning to rifle through a box on his nightstand. He pulled out a cassette tape and crossed the room again, heading toward an old school boom box. “My dad made this for Mom while they were dating,” he said softly, a little grin on his face as he pulled the tape from its casing. “Right before he proposed. ‘Mary’s Mix Four.’ I have these fuzzy memories of them dancing to it in the kitchen before Dad would leave for work.” Dean pressed the cassette gently into the tape deck and closed it but didn’t hit play. “He stopped playing it after she died.”
“Like I said,” said Sam, working his jaw. “Rowena and I will go on to the warehouse. I’ll make the biggest holy oil trap we can, while Rowena sets up her spellwork.” He turned to the witch, and asked, “You’re
“Yeah?”
The name hung in the air like the last mournful blow of a retreating army’s horn across some ancient, hopeless battlefield. It sounded like defeat. The soles of Dean’s shoes seemed to be filled with lead. He was falling. Sinking. He was certain. The cold earth was softening beneath him and sucking at his feet, preventing movement. From across the yard, the radio blared a cheerful Boston song, completely out of place for the weight of the moment.
“What?”
“Yeah, uhh, we may need you after all,” came the voice over the receiver. Castiel’s phone had stopped ringing, and Dean put his on speaker. They could hear shrieks in the background, and a close-by gunshot. Dean guessed that was Claire.
“Nope, no,” said Dean, cutting Castiel off with a rough clear of his throat, shaking his head. “M’good.” He ran his hand back through his hair and sighed. “Okay, uhh—m’gonna start the car and crank the heat. We can lay our stuff out up front and maybe it’ll get dried at least a
“It was,” Castiel agreed softly. “But in a way I’m glad I did.”
“Hey—Cas?” asked Dean, shaking Castiel’s shoulder gently. The angel didn’t budge, but he did begin breathing more steadily. Humanly. “I think he’s—sleeping?”
“Trying not to get hurt,” Sam answered. He cleared his throat. “No, I get it. But this is
“Cas, it’s fine, really. Just—go easy on the hair?”
“It’s reading a hundred and twenty.”
“Hey. Anything?” asked Castiel, seating himself across from Sam.
“Really, Rowena…” Castiel sighed, rolling his eyes.
“So tell me anyway,” Castiel answered. Dean shook his head. “Dean…”
Jack nodded and took off inside, and Dean turned around to face Sam, tears streaking his face. “Yeah. Right. Alright,” he said as stoically as he could manage—which wasn’t much. His voice was thick and cracked, and though he stowed his tears with one hard sniff, he was still shaking as he paced quickly around to the driver’s side and opened the door. “You gotta help me carry him, Sammy.”
“Come on, Sammy, what’s the big deal?” asked Dean, waving him off. “So you like her. It’s not like—”
“And don’t stay there all night,” Dean said.
Castiel nodded, and Sam walked out with Rowena on his heels. Seconds later, the Impala roared outside, and then the sound grew faint and disappeared. Castiel turned back to Jack.
He was just about to wrench open the nearest door when he felt a hand on his shoulder, pulling him back. “No,” Castiel commanded, moving himself in front of Dean.
“Oh,” said Dean, cheeks flaring red beneath his freckles. He cleared his throat awkwardly as Castiel stepped away to easily scoop up Sam and place him on the bed in the center of the room. “We should leave him a note or something,” Dean added, striding over to the room’s desk. “He’ll think we’re in some kind of—”
“Sam,” Dean interrupted, tone warning. Castiel replaced his hand on Dean’s knee beneath the table and squeezed.
“Dean.”
“Ugh,
“Trouble in paradise?” Sam asked as they approached.
“Whatever, shut up,” Claire grumbled, finally. “Look, if we—I guess if we find the witch, they can take us to the monsters.”
“That gonna be a problem, Cas?” Dean worried, squinting into the shadows, where the action had picked back up. Bodies already littered the massive floor: at least five or six
“I think so,” said Jack, and Castiel dropped his hand. He smiled. “Thank you, Castiel.”
“Yes,” agreed Castiel. “It is certainly that.”
“I’ll just—bring the bottle,” said Sam haltingly. Once he loosened Castiel’s fingers, he took hold of both his hands. “Can you bend your knees if I pull up?”
Castiel rolled his eyes again, and said, “Can we please get back to the plan?”
“Not long,” answered Castiel, padding barefoot over to the table. “But I feel strangely okay. Just a bit more…human, than normal.”
“So am I,” said Castiel, smiling back.
“I can’t make you do anything, Cas.”
Dean shook his head and laughed, embarrassed. “I really don’t. Don’t even like the word. Don’t like the ‘married’ word either, honestly.” He paused and cleared his throat. “But I’d do it, y’know. If you wanted to.”
“That’s not true,” said Dean.
“Would you like to hear more?”
They danced through the slow, soft guitar from one song to the next.
“Thanks, Cas,” said Dean. He took the cup and sipped, then downed the whole thing in seconds flat, gasping for air.
Castiel dove immediately back down for another kiss, breathing in through his nose as he dipped his tongue into Dean’s mouth, kissing him hot and deep. Dean groaned in his chest and licked back up into Castiel, buried both hands in his dark hair and arched his back. In response, Castiel gripped Dean’s wrists and pinned them to the blanket above his head. Dean laughed against Castiel’s lips, and Castiel silenced him with another bruising kiss, then moved to mouth at the space where Dean’s jawline met his neck, sucking the soft skin between his teeth. He did this again, two more times, then three, moving slowly down the side of Dean’s neck until he reached the edge of his t-shirt.
Castiel snorted, shaking his head. “Whatever you say.”
Dean snorted again and shoved Castiel back, kicking off the blankets. He stretched again as he stood and padded slowly for the bathroom, then glanced back to Castiel sitting cross-legged on the bed in some of Dean’s pajamas, pouting. A swell of fondness inflated his chest and he leaned against the frame. “Hey.”
“Claire’s years older than you were when you started hunting,” Castiel reminded Dean flatly. “And that’s not why you want to go.”
“Uhm,” started Sam, and then he sighed and shook his head. “Cas and Dean are fighting. Dean went for a drive. I don’t know when he’ll be back.”
“Are we going to have a wedding?”
Dean parted his lips with a shuddering sigh, and Castiel carefully dribbled some water into his mouth. That stirred a creature need in Dean, and he carefully sat up, taking the bottle from Castiel to give it a long few swallows, little streams escaping the corner of his mouth and dripping down onto the blanket, his chest. “Thanks,” he huffed to Castiel when he finally lowered it. He made a bowl of his other hand and poured some water into it before rubbing it over his face and up into his hair, then chugged the rest of the water and tossed the empty bottle into the front seat.
“He—looked like an adult,” Sam said, clearing his throat. “When he was born, I mean.”
“Don’t play dumb,” said Sam, rolling his eyes. “You told me you were gonna propose—”
“You’re a terrible liar, Cas,” said Dean, scowling. “I’m fine.”
“So what happened?” Jack chimed in, leaning forward over the record player box, almost hugging it.
“I don’t need one,” Castiel answered, grinning at Dean’s discomfort. “And you don’t want one.”
He could smell the scent of coffee wafting lazily in from the kitchen. He walked down the hall and could see Sam—or rather, a projection of Sam—reading in the library. Mary’s voice called to her son from somewhere, and Sam rose to find her, walking straight through Castiel’s non-body and disappearing around the corner.
” Castiel demanded, and Dean pulled back once more, then added a third finger. He rolled back up Castiel’s body, moaning uncontrollably when Castiel gripped his length tight at the same time as he pushed back inside.
“Oi, careful! That’s Polygonatum, more commonly called Solomon’s Seal. The spell doesn’t work without them.”
“You’re brilliant,” said Jack, eyes and face lit up with an amazed grin. Sam smirked, but Castiel just rolled his eyes.
“What?”
“Anytime,” nodded Sam. He reached out and clapped Castiel on the shoulder as he passed, reassuring. “He’ll be fine. Don’t sweat it.”
“Bitch.”
“What? Nothing,” said Dean with a needless cough, recovering. He stood and righted the chair, pushing it beneath the desk. “Yeah, well. Not surprising. You’ve had a hell of a day and it’s only…” he glanced at the clock. “Not even noon.”
Dean’s blood ran cold. The voice that came from Cas wasn’t Cas. The heat that had been sustaining him was suddenly ripped away, and he opened his eyes to find himself not on top of Cas but face down on the dirt, fingers digging not into Cas’s hands, but the cold earth. He blinked and scrambled backwards. There was no grass, no sunlight; the hillside was bare and the sky gray. A bitter wind gusted suddenly out of the north, and there were no leaves to rustle—the bare branches of ghostly trees cricketed together like nails on a chalkboard. His jeans were zipped; his hands blue with cold. At the top of the hill, the Impala was on blocks, dull and covered in rust.
Dean looked from his blue-faced brother on his knees to the pained, panicked Castiel, held by his scruff like a dog, and folded. “Please,” he croaked. “Please. What do you want?”
“We’re not going to let you kill people,” added Sam.
Castiel stood and dusted himself off, disgruntled. He concentrated hard, and his borrowed wings worked again long enough to meet the others, but it left him afraid to use them for the rest of the hunt, and after promising Dean to explain when they got home, they spent the rest of the hunt slogging after the Wendigos on foot.
“Don’t say it,” said Sam, shaking his head. His eyes were watering, threatening, but for Dean’s sake, he forced the tears back. He returned his hand to Dean’s arm. “We don’t know that.”
Castiel attempted a smile, but it fell flat. In that moment, he looked as tired as Dean had ever seen him, his head falling into his hands.
“Oh yeah. She’s
ran unbidden through Dean’s brain an instant before he was tackled to the floor.
Castiel’s smile twitched a bit larger and he dropped his hand from Dean’s chin to rest easily on his partner’s knee. “It’s similar, though not quite the same as being psychic,” he explained. “Think of it like—well, like angel radio—which is a term we only use because of humans, by the way. The actual process is best described by a series of mathematical equations incomprehensible to the human mind, although—”
Sam huffed. “Fine. But you should talk about it with Cas, at least.”
“Okay, this is stupid. I’m not uncomfortable,” Dean griped.
When Dean was straddling Castiel, he pulled his fingers free and leaned down to kiss the almost-angel, guiding his hand around to his ass. “You trust me?” he whispered.
Dean reciprocated easily at first, pulling Castiel’s weight down atop him and digging fingers into his skin, pulling his hair, but as the warmth of desire pooled in his stomach, so too did the sting of anxious bile begin rising in his throat.
“Get out of the car,” said Castiel. He opened his eyes wide and they spilled out beams of violent blue light. A high-pitched ringing started to slowly consume the air. Dean threw a hand over his own eyes to shield them, and Castiel sat up to grip him by the shoulders, push him toward the passenger side door. “Get out of the car, Dean!” he repeated. “Now!”
“Okay,” said Sam, nodding once. He opened his mouth to speak again, but a hand flew to the gun at his hip at the sound of a car pulling up to their room, headlights beaming faintly through the curtains.
“So—what?”
“Say when,” answered Sam tensely. “Dean?”
, and intrigued, he singled it out and set the box aside to press that tape into the player. A low, grungy guitar started, and Castiel stared at the train passing as he listened to the music, turned down low to not wake the boys. He seemed to be enjoying it for the moment until a line,
“Okay,” said Sam, watching the pair almost sadly until they disappeared.
“You sure?” asked Dean, leaning against the door frame.
“Just—be patient with me,” said Dean. He dropped his hand to take Castiel’s. “M’trying. But it’s hard, between the Michael nightmares, the nightmares about you…it’s hard.”
“Tell me about the case,” Dean said, changing the subject brusquely.
Hallway scene inspiration:
“Of course I can,” slurred Castiel. “What a ridic—ridiculous question.” He hiccupped and opened his eyes just barely to squint blearily at the door.
“He is
“Excellent,” she said. “And the boy?”
“I’m okay, Sam.”
“Then what is it?” demanded Castiel, voice rising.
“Here is good,” said Castiel, and took two or three steps back, then tossed the duffel bag down and knelt beside it. He glanced up at Dean, first, and said, “Can I have the blanket?”
“I can’t make you do anything, Cas,” said Dean. He shut the door with a squeak and, staring straight ahead, kept driving in the opposite direction of home.
“Hot damn,” said Dean.
“I’m alright, Dean.”
“I understand,” said Jack, though he went quiet. They drove on like this for a few miles in silence, slowly weaving through golden grasslands that, in places, were taller than the car. “Where do we go, if we die like this?” he finally asked.
“You too,” she answered simply. “So, my guess is we won’t be here more than a week tops, but I took the master bedroom anyway. But the other one’s cozy. Got a twin bed and everything.”
“I know you do,” Sam said, grinning.
“I know,” said Sam. “Just tired.”
Dean looked over at Castiel, and when their eyes met, they smiled at each other through their panting.
work out for us. Not like this.”
Claire had been working a job closer to the plagued high school and beat the boys there. She scoped out the area and found a small, but unoccupied and still mostly-furnished foreclosure home in a suburban neighborhood close enough to the school that the bus ran down the street. She plucked the sign from the yard, picked the lock, texted Sam the address, and had already claimed the biggest bedroom by the time the Impala grumbled up the drive.
Castiel settled on the edge of the bed. “It’s a difficult concept,” he began. “But it’s easiest to think about it as our version of a soul—though it isn’t quite the same. It’s—well, it’s
“Is it him?” Sam asked, but then yelled, “Dean?”
Jack grinned as he emerged, traipsing happily over to where Sam stood beside the table. “What do you think?” He asked cheerily, starting to deposit flowers and leaves into the vessels.
“Yep,” said Dean again, waving blandly as Sam disappeared. “You want a beer?” He asked, and then, noticing Claire was still present, amended, “Either of you?”
Castiel stared at Dean, softening sadly as he listened. His shoulders fell and he fished out and tugged on his own boxers, then scooted across the seat to tilt Dean’s chin toward him. “Dean, look at me.” Dean did, and Castiel leaned in to press a soft kiss to the center of his forehead. He withdrew slowly, and said, “We’re not cursed. We can call it anything you want. I’m with you.”
, then sighed. Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes for a long moment, then deleted the words. He retyped,
“I do like this song, yes,” answered Castiel after a moment. “It’s calm. Less abrasive that most of the other music in here.”
“Not today. Not until you have your grace back.”
“Well, actually I was thinking…” Sam began, his gaze trailing back to Castiel.
“Cas, I can’t—I don’t want—I can’t fight with you right now.” His voice wavered. “I thought I’d lost you, this whole time, I wasn’t sure and—I wanted to believe, but—God, Cas. I can’t fight with you. Not now. Not when I have you, and—” Dean swallowed and looked away from Castiel, out over the dark cliffs, but Castiel pulled his chin back.
Sam sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. “We’re not gonna let that happen. Dean’ll be back any minute, Rowena’s coming—all of us together will figure something out. We will.”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean mumbled through the kiss, breaking it and rejoining and breaking it again. “I love you so damn much I can’t stand it.”
The drive, thankfully, wasn’t far. Within ten minutes they were screeching to a halt at the edge of the warehouse. Dean had shed his Fed coat sometime during the drive, and was out of the car in seconds, tucking guns into his waistband and loading his pockets with clips. Castiel slid an angel blade into the hidden holster in his sleeve, and Dean slammed the trunk.
“So…he has it?”
Castiel shook his head. “Almost. Like this,” he said to Jack, who held a can of red spray paint. Castiel gripped Jack gently by the wrist, then said softly, “Let me control your arm. Alright, spray.” Jack did, and Castiel swooped their arms together in one fluid motion to paint a particularly tricky sigil on the hotel wall. “Got it?”
Dean listened through one more time, and Castiel rewound it. When it started this time, he asked gently through his smile, “Like that one?”
“Now,” said Rowena, “You let me do the talking until I’m sure it’s Belial on the line. Aye?”
“Of course I do,” sighed Dean. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and pulled on his boxers. He ran a hand down his face before adding, “I know we deserve it. It’s just—hard to believe sometimes. And then that weird…” he flailed a hand at the door, “…I dunno, vision thing of you. It shook me up, man.”
Dean,” Jack exploded, pressing his palms into his temples. “Can you
Almost instantly, Jack’s body went slack. Sam caught him and dragged him to one of the plush chairs in the library, beleaguered by his own yawns the entire way.
& for that whole Sam/Jack intrusion:
“I—don’t know,” grumbled Dean, still hovering inches above Cas, but looking back over his shoulder towards the door, brows knit. “Thought I heard something.”
“Are you sure he’s okay?” Sam said again, finishing the question this time.
On the other end of the tub, Sam released Castiel’s legs, though they stayed down, the fabric of his trousers soaked through and heavy. “Dean…”
“What are you talking about?” said Dean, attempting nonchalance, but panic was tightening his chest. “Why wouldn’t it?”
“He didn’t approve,” said Dean softly. “Of me and Cas. You and Mom took my side, so he left.”
“Like I drank a fifth of bourbon,” Dean grumbled, eyes still squeezed shut. His voice was rough with sleep. “And then got hit by a bus.” He opened his eyes and tried to sit up but blew out a stream of air instead and sank back down to throw his hand over his face. “And dizzy.”
“Stop.”
“It’s just an expression.”
“So? I got my GED. We’ll watch some Magic Schoolbus.”
Nobody spoke. Dean cleared his throat and looked down to his shoes and made a noise in his throat, and Sam, blinked back at Jack and broke into a wide smile of his own.
Dean rested his forehead against Castiel’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around the angel’s back. “That’s really it?”
“Sorry,” Dean mumbled. He folded his arms across his chest to keep himself still, almost as if he could physically hold the nervous impatience in.
Castiel’s nostrils flared, and Dean didn’t miss that same sinister flash of grace behind the blue eyes. “Sam was very clear.”
“No, Dean,” said Castiel, grumpily.
They finished eating, and while Dean sealed up all the food and stacked the dishes, Sam dragged Jack and Castiel out into the little space of open grass just before the tree line to give frisbee instructions. Dean toted everything inside but the cooler and the radio, which he turned up when he got back outside. He seated himself and leaned back comfortably, reaching into the cooler for another beer. The lid slapped heavily closed, and Sam turned his head that way, then handed the frisbee to Jack and slapped him on the shoulder. He loped over to Dean and relaxed into the chair beside him.
Sam blinked. “What? How? It’s the weekend, the courthouse is closed.”
“What’s it gonna be?” asked Sam.
“I’m not opposed to it, but I don’t want to make Dean uncomfortable,” said Castiel.
“Alright,” said Dean, nodding to Rowena and Sam in turn. “Let’s get this show on the road.”
“Mmm,” Dean grunted, conceding. “That’s fair. How do you stop it, anyway?”
Dean, and I don’t mind and I don’t regret it, but at least the last time I was human I got to go outside!”
“Cas, what’s happening? What’s wrong?”
Dean blinked. “The record player in my head?” And then, with understanding, “…right, the song. I knew that.”
“Should do it,” nodded Dean, and watched as the man slowly began to type prices into an old school calculator. Rather than watch, Dean turned to glance absently over the smattering of odds and ends nearby.
“You don’t want to die.”
Sam bent down and started to pry Castiel’s fingers off the book. “Okay, so—muscle relaxer, maybe? Can you swallow?”
“Nah. Waiting to see how this thing with Cas’s grace goes, then I’ll call her.”
“Turn over.”
“Dean?” Castiel answered, quiet and serious as always. “Are you alright.”
It was pushing the angel over the edge. As the pressure built, Castiel’s moaning grew more frequent and uncontrolled, punctuating each thrust until the sound and feeling threatened to break Dean’s resolve as well. “I—” Castiel began, but lost his words, instead reaching his free hand to grip Dean’s wrist, propped near his head.
“Not yet.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” chirped Rowena, rolling her eyes.
Dean relaxed against Castiel and let out a slow breath, closing his eyes, savoring the warmth of Castiel’s skin. “I know,” he said softly. He reached up to trail his fingers slowly up and down Castiel’s arm over his chest. “I just forget sometimes. How—I dunno—ancient you are. Powerful. I know you’re an angel, but I don’t always process what exactly that means.”
But that was quick work, and a few hours later they were preparing for the move.
“…so, you remember that crystal? The one with—”
“The spell must operate outside of temporal constructs,” Castiel mused. “It’s mirroring each of our times, creating a sustainable—”
“Where’s the map?” asked Sam, looking over the spell.
Position: First song on side 1
Dean’s prayer came through loud and clear as Castiel lay stunned in the dirt, a few pines spread around him. So at least he wasn’t totally broken, he’d thought.
“I did,” he nodded proudly. “But Sam had to buy the champagne. And the streamers. And…well, everything, because I have no money, and I can’t drive.”
“Why you think that?”
Michael rolled his eyes again. “No. What you’ve got is
“This is—uhh—” Dean started, stammering. “It’s uhm…”
“Haven’t felt this good in a long time, man,” he finally said to Sam. “Not since—” He cut himself off and the warm serenity that had settled in his chest sank, replaced by tendrils of dread. Dean leaned forward and his eyes glazed over as he gripped the edge of the table, testing its reality.
“Aye, he is,” said Rowena. Beneath her breath, she kept up a slow, rhythmic chant.
“You can’t mix them,” he said, rummaging in his pack again and unrolling another bundle—one glowing a bit brighter, a bit more blue than Castiel’s. “But you can take this one instead.”
“Yeah, those seem pretty opposite,” said Dean, squeezing back. “Sure you’re okay?”
A chilling silence swept through the room once more. The empty eyes of Belial’s white face didn’t betray any emotion, but Dean swore he saw the tight skin around the corners of Belial’s mouth grow somehow tighter.
“Rowena.”
“About keeping it together,” reminded Sam lowly. “Dean?” he said when his brother didn’t answer.
“Remember that Michael took Cas? Of course I remember,” Dean snarled, rattling his restraints.
“I don’t know what to tell you,” said Cas, and he dropped the needle. It started spitting static again as he turned and he smiled at Dean. He reached out a beckoning hand and cocked a brow, and a peppy guitar blared from the speakers. “Except that we were having fun, and now we’re not. I’d like to get back there.”
“What are you thinking?” Cas finally asked, tilting his head. “I promised not to read your mind, but when you get like this it’s tempting.”
At that point, Dean had rolled his eyes and shoved a random cassette into his tape deck, a wailing guitar suddenly filling the cab.
After what must have been at least the eighth Bunker blackout in half as many weeks, Sam had figured it out, and was over it. He ignored it most of the time since they tended to occur at predictable times—early morning or late night, mostly—and he made up something for Jack about “old wiring,” but he suspected that Jack had figured it out too, considering Dean and Castiel never seemed to be around when they happened.
Dean huffed a little laugh. “Somethin’ like that,” he said, and dug out an age-stained notepad and an old fountain pen. The letterhead on the notepad was dated 1958. Dean cringed a little at the date and sucked on the pen to get the ink going, then crossed it out and wrote,
“Yeah,” said Dean. He released Castiel’s wrist and trailed his fingers slowly down the length of his arm. “Psychics just hear stuff all the time.”
“Alright, don’t get your trousers twisted,” she chirped back and waved her hand flippantly at Sam. “It’s not like no—”
“I…don’t know,” admitted Castiel. “I wanted you.”
“Make a choice, boys!” called out Rowena. The purple haze in the room warbled a bit as she focused her attention on the third set of spell items, which started glowing yellow. “I’m starting the final spell!”
"Dean?" I speak up softly, trying not to startle him as I round the corner. I crouch beside him, holding the top of the island for support. His head is hanging, and he's staring down at whatever's left of the beer bottle in his hand. Six or seven more empty ones litter the floor nearby, some tipped onto their sides.
Of toast as the butter runs
Dean’s phone buzzed again as he neared his car.
“You gonna be sick?”
Color rose in Dean’s cheeks and he felt himself grow somehow achingly harder. He moved to sit up and Castiel gently removed his fingers with the motion, eliciting a little noise from Dean. Dean leaned forward, first, to catch Castiel’s lips in a quick, hard kiss, and then ducked down to guide Castiel’s erection into his mouth, bracing a hand beside his hip. Castiel’s mouth fell open and his eyes closed, head tilting back as a sound of pleasure slipped past his lips. Dean sucked and slicked for about a minute before Castiel touched his cheek, and he lifted, looking up.
Castiel felt a familiar ache shuttle through his being—perhaps the grace made his projection more real, or perhaps it was because he was the one doing the work of infiltrating Dean’s mind. Whatever it was, he felt every moment of it, intense as ever. But the grace was working on him another way: his patience. His restraint. Castiel wasn’t used to such power, and it was desperate for an outlet. The ache suddenly flared into a barely controllable rage.
Castiel froze and his heart stuttered, but Dean held his ground, and it gave Castiel the encouragement he needed. He closed his eyes and angled his body so his back was against the door, and Dean pressed in closer. Castiel weaved his arms around Dean’s middle and finally kissed him back, hard.
Dean held his breath as he hurried to his room. He closed the door behind him, just in case, and went to pull open the desk drawer, withdrawing and then pocketing a small, brown paper sack before he set off once more for the garage.
Sam paused and turned around to lift his brows at Dean. “What happened in there?” he finally ventured.
“Am I interrupting something?” Claire’s voice shot through the kitchen, followed by a snort. “Obviously.”
So they pulled strings. The other parents who died? PTA members, yeah, but also: the local judge who kept the case from advancing; the cop who was paid off to fudge the arrest report and “lose” the breathalyzer results; and the spouses of those people who helped keep it quiet. Jessica’s family had lost their father/husband the year before, and now with no one, Jessica’s mother Angela went, the storytelling nurse said, insane—started getting into strange occult stuff, checking out weird books from the library, and generally disappeared from public life.

“You didn’t,” said Dean, quietly, and stretched. He shot a look over his shoulder at Sam and Jack, both still sleeping hard.
“No, really,” said Dean. He turned and jerked open the car door. “I thought we’d hit the ‘hiding things from each other’ phase of marriage in a couple years, but we got there in a week. Must be some kind of record.”
“Damnit, Cas! We ran out of options!” Dean snapped, hurling the empty skins of his fruit over the cliff. Castiel and Sam stared at him in silence, and he balled his fists into his jeans until his knuckles turned white. His teeth felt like they’d crack from the pressure of his clenching jaw. After a long minute of silence, he spoke again, words tense. “We didn’t have a choice,” he said slowly. “You were gone, and we had to make a decision, or you were going to stay gone. Because we could take you home right now, but that would only solve half the problem. We’d still have to deal with Michael, and you know he’d be back. He’d never quit. And he never will unless—”
“Sam’s fine,” said Castiel, consoling. “He’s just gone to check on Claire, back at the house. She broke her leg.”
“Why, Dean?” Michael’s voice turned inward. Dean watched helplessly as his own hands, without bidding, moved to grasp the sides of Cas’s face. “Because you’re quiet when you’re broken.”
Over his shoulder, Castiel glanced back to the water and his heart briefly stuttered when he didn’t see Dean. He stood, readying himself to flit to his rescue, but then caught sight of his lover’s head breaching the waves. An exhale of relief passed Castiel’s lips, and he turned back to separate the plates. Onto one, he dumped some half-crushed chocolate-covered strawberries from one of the boxes with a little frown at their state. He opened the remaining box and pulled out two antique champagne glasses, placing them carefully on the other plate. The envelope he folded and slipped into his back pocket, the boom box he settled behind the alcohol, and then he rose, taking the empty boxes to the duffel, and then tossing the duffel to the side.
“Should’ve woken me up,” grumbled Dean. “M’supposed to be keeping tabs on you.”
“Good,” said Cas, and stilled himself to lean forward and give Dean’s lips a peck. “Good things do happen, Dean.”
Dean’s hands went to his throat as his voice seized again. A piercing, high-pitched ring blew through the hallways of his mind, and he fell to his knees, hands pushing against either side of his head. In the warehouse, he didn’t know it, but his physical body was screaming.
“S’what I’m worried about,” grumbled Dean.
Dean!” Castiel yelled back. “You can’t keep me locked in here forever.”
Dean conceded the point in silence with a lift of his eyebrows, snatching the whiskey and heading to the couch, where he flopped down to drink in moody silence. Castiel slid into a chair beside Claire and rubbed his temple.
“Aye, alright,” she said, twisting her hair. “And your mum? Haven’t seen her about.”
“Cas!” Dean scrambled to his feet and followed, his heart splitting in his chest.
“What are you doing?” Dean demanded, trying to take the compass back, but Sam stepped away.
It took me years to finish this. Thank you for sticking around.
“Yes,” Dean breathed.
Faster than he’d moved since before he lost his wings, Castiel pulled up to Michael and pushed the tip of the blade against his throat. “You don’t know me at all.”
“Good, take these sons of bitches by surprise,” Dean grumbled, starting to edge forwards.
“Cover their tracks?” said Sam, shrugging. “Throw off the trail of hunters?”
“It’s a lot,” said Castiel, withdrawing a hand to run his thumb over Dean’s cheek.
Once it was silent, Dean let himself sigh. He looked down at Castiel and frowned. “Back for round two of ‘make sure Cas wakes up,’ I guess.”
Sam blinked at Castiel, staring at him a moment, his phone abandoned. “It’s heartache,” he said simply, almost in awe. “You’ve never—you don’t feel that as an angel?”
“Yeah, okay,” said Sam, readjusting the unconscious angel and catching up to Dean’s steps.
This one's a little longer and more of a logistics chapter, but I promise there's a bomb-ass fight & some sweet, sweet angst coming soon!
“Is he under?” asked Castiel, stepping closer to the flames and squinting at the bound body of Dean in the circle.
“This is important, Jack.”
Castiel glanced behind him and sighed. “Looking for anything on archangel grace.  It’s frustrating. Most of this I already know just by virtue of being an angel.”
“Thank you,” said Jack. “Sam and Dean tell me the same thing. But I’ll be alright if we don’t.” He looked at his palms, rubbed his thumbs over his fingertips. “I feel useless right now. But Sam and Dean aren’t useless, and they’re human too. They’ve just had practice.”
“Sam’s not exactly wrong, Dean, though again, I’m—”
“Of course I am.”
Cas sat up and scooted to sit next to Dean, pulling the blanket up around their waists. “You mean, does this feel too good to be true?” he asked. Dean nodded, and he answered simply, “Yeah, sometimes.”
Castiel slid into the backseat and across the far side so that he was behind Rowena, Dean’s legs spread limply across the seat behind Sam. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s shoulders, angling his body so Dean’s head rested gently against his chest. The whole drive back to the hotel Castiel pressed his lips to Dean’s ear, whispering Enochian words of love and grief.
“The hell, Rowena?” Dean snapped, stumbling sleep-groggy into the room. “I said four hours!”
“I suppose it worked, then?” asked Rowena simply, lounging at the table.
Blinking his eyes open, Castiel let out a sigh and looked up to find Dean standing in the doorway, brows knit. “Dean,” he said, and his voice still sounded too full of anger, so he cleared his throat and straightened before adding, almost shyly, “How long have you been standing there?”
“Let’s lower him in,” said Sam simply, nudging Dean by jostling Castiel’s legs just a bit. Dean nodded started shuffling sideways. When they were on either side of the tub, Sam asked, “Ready?” and when Dean nodded again, he slowly sunk Castiel’s legs into the water.
“Dean?” said Castiel, and then, “Dean! Dean Winchester!”
Jack made a pained face as he swallowed and cleared his throat. “No,” he lied badly.
“When did you even have time?” asked Sam.
“Just let go! It’s not that high.”
“I—hurt,” said Jack with a groan, and he sat up slowly as Castiel took a step back. “And I’m hungry. Really hungry.”
“Right,” said Castiel with a light laugh. “It’s all waves. So, like the radio, you have your own…station.”
“Whatever,” Dean said, making a stink face at the girl as she snagged a beer and turned for the stairs.
Within minutes, Dean was rumbling down the road in the Impala, cell phone pressed to his ear.
“Don’t be a spoilsport, Feathers,” she trilled, releasing the vial into Castiel’s hand. “Just trying to lighten the mood. You boys are always so dramatic. D’you know what we call you lot?”
“If that means you’re a coward then so am I,” answered Castiel lowly. He sighed through his nose and finally lifted his free hand to settle it gently on the back of Dean’s neck. He drew Dean forward to rest their foreheads together, closing his eyes as he continued. “But you don’t get to lock me away because you’re afraid. And I won’t do that to you.” He paused. “We’re not Rapunzels.”
“No, you’re not,” said Castiel. He glanced up at Dean from his work, soaking a thick piece of white gauze in rubbing alcohol. “You’ve been through something traumatic. Like Sam said—it takes time.”
“I need you,” Dean repeated, and a tear slipped from his eye, landing on Castiel’s cheek.
“Why would I go anywhere with you?” spat Castiel, turning to follow Michael’s back with his eyes.
“Does that mean nothing? Because so help me—”
“It’s just good gun hygiene,” muttered Dean, but Sam wasn’t convinced.
It turned out, Claire explained, the PTA was more tight-knit out of need than of friendship or school spirit. A chatty nurse in the witness crowd had told Claire the whole story: two years ago, the quarterback (who wasn’t yet the quarterback, but was a promising football player with his eyes on college scholarships) had driven drunk after a party and killed a girl out for a late-night run: Jessica Mathers. At the time, his mother was running for state senator, and her husband—the campaign manager, seemed to think it would be disastrous to her poll numbers if word got out—not to mention their son’s scholarship hopes would be dashed before they started.
Castiel smirked. “Never.”
“Yes,” Castiel moaned into Dean’s kiss, and Dean slowly pushed those two fingers inside, drawing an open-mouthed gasp from Castiel, who writhed beneath him. “Again,” Castiel said, and Dean obliged. He withdrew his fingers almost completely, then slowly, and with another grind of his hips, slid them back in. “
With a sigh, Sam looked back to Castiel and frowned, watching the angel shudder as the grace ricocheted through his body. “It’s killing you, isn’t it?” he asked softly.
Rowena, Sam, and Jack argued, voices overlapping, and all the while Castiel was silent. He rose from the edge of the bed and padded to a window while they continued, oblivious to his movements. After a few moments of staring out into the dark, he cleared his throat and turned to face the bickering trio.
“Something is snatching parents from a local high school,” Sam said, clearing his throat. “The article I read said they were all from the same PTA group.”
, and when I got back, when I
“Dean?”
“Okay, alright,” Sam conceded, holding up a palm. “Just—don’t freak out. We’ve made some progress with finding Cas already.”
“Right,” said Castiel.
“What’s that?”
Dean had retreated to the stove and was scraping ground beef and seasonings into a pan of oil. “What? No, Cas—it was a joke.” He snorted and shook his head at Castiel a little.
“He is,” said Castiel, and then mirrored Sam’s scowl. “But it all means nothing if we can’t convince him to abandon his dream state and eject Michael.”
“You kidding me?” Dean rounded on Sam. “She’s—”
Jack stared hard at Castiel, then looked to Sam again. Sam nodded, and Jack sighed in resignation, returning to his seat on the bed. “So we let you sacrifice yourself instead?”
“Come on, man. You’re smarter than that. Think.”
“Stop,” Sam interrupted, shaking his head. “It’s not happening. Okay?”
“NO!” yelled Castiel, reaching out to try and snag the front of Michael’s shirt, but he was too late.
Dean blinked over at the door and locked eyes with Sam, who gave him a nod as well, his eyes large and sad. Dean nodded back, and then sighed. “Right…right,” he said softly.
“Pie’s mostly for me,” Dean admitted with a shrug. “But, yeah. Last time Cas was human he was homeless. Can’t have been eating good food. I’m gonna milk this chance to give him something awesome.”
“I told him of your objections,” Castiel said sagely to Sam. “Dean was unconcerned.”
“I—” Dean began, but Castiel’s lips were too hungry, unwilling to part. Castiel swallowed Dean’s words, his hands moving too quickly and deftly down to Dean’s belt buckle. “Cas—” Dean tried again, but he couldn’t get the rest out—and part of him didn’t want to; wanted to stay in this moment of sensation.
Castiel withdrew his hands to his lap as Dean began to lean forward, watching him carefully. Dean held eye contact until his lips were a breath from Castiel’s, and then he grinned. Instead of kissing him, Dean dipped his head down below Castiel’s jawline and pressed his lips to the side of the angel’s neck. Castiel inhaled with a little gasp, and Dean felt him shiver as goosebumps began to ripple across his skin, so Dean went further. With the next brush of his lips he sucked a gentle kiss into Castiel’s neck, then repeated the gesture, slowly moving lower until his mouth reached the curve of his shoulder, and Dean let his teeth just barely graze against the dip. Castiel let out a slow sigh, his heart beating so hard Dean could feel his pulse through his lips. He smiled against the angel’s neck and started to withdraw, but Castiel’s hands flew up to his shoulders, holding him in place.
“Classic Cas,” Castiel repeated, smiling softly with the memory. “He was a very different angel.”
Castiel did him one better. He slid back down the couch and gently pulled Dean along with him, allowing the hunter to lie down and stretch out, and he carefully guided Dean’s head to rest on his leg. “Better?”
Sam snorted humorlessly. “When have our lives ever been clean?”
A smile curled Cas’s lips. “Is that what’s happening here, Dean Winchester? You’re
Dean smirked. “Relieved?”
“Okay,” repeated Castiel. He cracked a small smile. “Do you know what else is real?” Dean shook his head. “Your morning breath. You smell like a bar.”
Castiel looked down, almost bashfully, and he smiled back. “Burritos now, I think,” he said. “Burgers for dinner?”
Dean skimmed the record players quickly, grumbling under his breath. “C’mon, c’mon. Green sticker…”
Castiel’s easy smile faltered as he stood, and he reached up to touch at the corner of an eye. Sure enough, a droplet of blood appeared on his finger, and he nodded at Dean.
“Yes,” Dean answered. It wasn’t a question.
“I’m just—” Sam began, then laughed, looking down bashfully to his feet. He ran his hand through his hair before looking up again. “I’m really happy for you and Dean. You’ve always been family, but it’s good to call you my brother.”
“Is he breathing?” Sam huffed as he pulled up beside Dean, leaning against the door to peer in, but Dean didn’t answer. “Dean!” Sam yelled and shook him by the shoulder. “Snap out of it!”
“If you’re going faster, how are we talking now?”
“Alright, enough,” Dean finally interjected gruffly. “You’ve been grilling the poor guy for hours, Sam.”
Dean fidgeted with his slippery keys and opened the trunk, and they shoved everything hastily inside, then slammed it and sloshed around to the Impala’s front seat, sliding quickly inside. They pulled the doors closed and the sound of the rain muffled into a dull, static roar. For a moment they sat there, breathing heavily with effort and the chill of being drenched in the cool October rain, then they looked over at each other and began to laugh.
“We should get back,” Castiel agreed softly. He reached for his clothes and grimaced. “They’re not dry.”
“I guess I did promise, didn’t I?” croaked Dean, smiling humorlessly and looking down to his hands.
Dean blinked back his shock and Sam’s lips turned up into a silent, satisfied smirk, that only grew larger when Castiel, having misread the situation, answered, “I believe it’s been eight, or six, if we logically subtract the years I was—”
A loud, unbridled moan rippled through Castiel and he bucked up into Dean involuntarily, the noise and motion sending sparks surging through Dean’s blood. He let out his own cry, and then looked down to Castiel, whose eyes were blown wide open, crackling with blue fire. “Turn over,” he said to Dean, and Dean was powerless to resist.
“I’m sure Michael cooked up all kinds of false realities,” answered Castiel.
Album: Carry Fire
Castiel nodded and glanced to Sam. “Sam said the same. It’s very peaceful here.”
“It…I thought we might be able to use it,” said Dean, protesting. “To save Cas! To barter him back.”
Dean, on the other hand, had a promise to keep: get Castiel blackout drunk.
It was nearly noon when Dean finally woke, but the library was still bathed in shadow and sickly lamplight; no one had flipped the main switch to illuminate the room. He stirred with a groan and lifted his head from the table, picked up the whiskey bottle, empty save a splash, that had fallen to its side. In the glass dome that housed the growing crystal Dean caught sight of his reflection: the wood-grain pattern pressed into his cheek and the five-o-clock shadow beginning to dust his chin, his sleep-messy hair. He groaned again and scrubbed his hand down over his eyes, then focused on the Seal. The geode-like crystals that covered the stones were still small but beginning to come to points that grew towards each other instead of out. Assuming it was a good sign, Dean pushed back from the table and wobbled to the kitchen.
“Magic never truly is, darling,” she said, and pulled up beside Sam. “Shall we?”
“Yeah,” Dean finally conceded. He sank to his knees with a sigh, carefully keeping Castiel’s head above water. “Hey Jack,” he called over, finally calmer. “There a thermometer in the kit?”
“How long’s that gonna take?” growled Dean over Sam’s arm, then pushed it away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We need to talk about this,” said Sam, sighing. “Trust me, I don’t want to. But this has to st…” Sam trailed off, looking over his brother in the dark. “You’re—”
?” Sam insisted.
“What debt?” asked Sam.
“I know you didn’t,” said Dean softly. He reached out to touch Castiel’s shoulder but stopped short and rested his arm on the seatback instead. “How did you, by the way? Get me out? Which—I’m grateful for, by the way. But something’s up with you, and I need you to tell me, Cas.”
Dean kept beating his fists on the barrier, scrabbling to try and get view of Castiel. “CAS! Cas, hold on! Just hold on!” The shockwaves were so loud, Dean didn’t hear Sam and Jack trying to break down his door. The mist reached nearly to Dean’s shoulders, now. “CAS!”
“You really want him in this?”
Sam rolled his eyes, and was about to speak when Claire emerged from the crowd. “So, all these victims? Not just PTA,” she said. The boys looked at each other, and then back to Claire.
are a miracle.”
“I’m not dead now,” Castiel countered. “And it seems what I want still doesn’t matter.”
“You’re gonna have to prove it to me,” said Dean. “Something I couldn’t make up in my head to convince me it’s you.”
Dean rolled his eyes at Sam, who was taking out his frustration on a book of ancient sigils. He looked to his phone again and pulled up his messages, thumbing out a text to Castiel.
Gretchen smiled at the pair of them, and though a look of confusion flashed across her face at Dean’s expression, she quickly picked back up with the meeting, discussing plans to implement counseling sessions during homeroom in the wake of all the murders. Cas removed his hand, and Dean shoved his into his lap, his features turning to stone, but his ears burning red at the tips.
“Yes,” Michael said simply. His hand moved, lightning fast, to Castiel’s shoulder. His fingers dug into the flesh, hard and quick, and spots of red began to bloom across the white t-shirt where they landed.
Castiel’s head whipped to the side and he stared at Dean, then sat up suddenly, features a map of concern. “Did I—did I hurt you? Did you not have fun?”
“And you didn’t?”
“Not like this,” Cas whispered, and looked back up at Dean, awestruck, borderline worshipful.
“Do you not understand what just happened here?” growled Castiel through his teeth. He rose to stalk towards Sam and Jack, leaning into their personal space, and Sam was reminded of a Castiel from years ago, full of righteous fury. “I don’t know if you noticed, but he’s gone, Sam. Michael is gone, and this place was our one lead. Do you think he’ll be back here? Do you think he’ll make the mistake of staying in one place again?”
“Cas?” Dean asked again, quietly, and his eyelids began to droop. His chin tipped forward, and despite a chorus of his name and
“Yeah,” said Dean, noncommittal.
Dean didn’t answer—just took a long swig from his beer and sighed, watched Sam jog over to the tree where Castiel stood, helplessly staring up at Jack hanging from the branches, hands on his hips. He smirked as the wind carried the sound of their gentle bickering to the table.
“You don’t do that when you’re fine,” said Castiel.
“You can’t say a word,” Dean warned quietly, no real heat to his words. If anything, he sounded tired, beaten. He wouldn’t look at Sam. “He pulls out of this, m’gonna ask.” After a few moments, when Sam didn’t speak, he cleared his throat and shrugged. “You know me, man. I’m not—I’m a pretty simple guy. I’m not that complicated. There isn’t much I want. Even less that I need.”
Rowena smiled and held up her palms, turning to click slowly away. Sam watched her until she disappeared, then looked to Dean. “What did we talk about?”
Sam was already there at the table, phone to his ear. He lowered it and hung up when he saw Castiel’s approach. “Hey,” he said. Sam looked Castiel’s outfit up and down but said nothing.
“It isn’t,” agreed Castiel. He beamed a proud smile at Dean. “I found us a case.”
Castiel simply tilted his head in response. A few more parents trickled in, some singles, some in pairs, and then a short older woman with a bob stood up at the front, calling the meeting to order.
“Yep,” said Dean, defused. He strode to the fridge, which was now working despite the city having long ago turned off the foreclosed home’s power, thanks to a jolt from Cas to the transformer outside. “Hey, Cas, you think you could make the cable work too?”
“I think so,” said Castiel. He knit his brows in an odd kind of confusion. “It’s been a long time since—well, since the last time I was human. The memories are fuzzy.” As if on cue, Castiel’s stomach gave a loud, irritated growl, and his lips turned up in a half smile. “Yes, I’m hungry.”
“Hell yeah,” said Dean. He clinked back, and then downed half the glass in one go.
Castiel looked down at Dean below him, the world suddenly silent—the only sounds their breathing and the thumping of the rain on the Impala’s hood, occasional thunder. “I love you,” he whispered to Dean.
Castiel shook his head gently. “Tomorrow,” he said, and for a moment they fell into silence, happy to listen to the soft sounds of each other’s breathing. “How are you feeling?” he asked after a time.

“He’s not gonna die!” Dean yelled, and in desperation, shoved Castiel back under the water, neglecting his nose.
“Shut up,” Dean said, rolling his eyes.
“Cas! We heard a—”
“Yep.”
“Fine.”
“Dude—what?”
“Just like Lucifer,” said Sam.
getting caught in the rain? You’ve done nothing but complain about it the whole drive home.”
“Yes,” he said. “I did some reading.”
Dean took Castiel’s extended hand and pulled himself up, then tugged the towel more tightly around his shoulders. “B-bite me, Cas,” he chattered out.
Dean pulled his almost-empty mug to his chest and secretly reveled in the comforting warmth it sent through his sternum. “Okay,” he said, nodding. “I’m gonna…I don’t know. Go for a drive.”
Castiel leaned against the wide trunk of an ancient, massive tree near the edge of the waterfall and watched the sky in the distance lighten from black to purple to pink. When the first rays of sunlight shot beams over the horizon he exhaled long and low, as if he’d been holding his breath for the whole event. The river in the valley below burned orange with the sunrise, and the waterfall itself became a stream of living diamonds, too painful to look at, too beautiful to look away. But Castiel did look away; he rose and turned his back to the light, stretching out the kinks of another night of sleep on the hard ground.
“A ring?”
“That you’re married, you mean,” clarified Jack.
,” grinned Dean, winking back at Castiel. “Don’t let a shark get me.”

“Night,” mumbled Dean, and shuffled off for the stairs, leaving the angel to the empty couch.
Dean shook his head. He swallowed. “Was a dream, I guess,” he said lowly, cheeks coloring. “God, I’m so stupid.”
Dean bore Castiel slowly to his room, then settled him gently to the bed, where Castiel flopped backwards instantly. “I don’t sleep,” Castiel mumbled, “But this might come close.”
Dean stepped into his bedroom to find it hazy. The bathroom door stood open, filling the room with warm steam from the running shower. He smiled to himself and pulled the door closed gently behind him, setting his shoes down beside it. He threw his wet flannel over the back of his desk chair to dry, then stripped out of his t-shirt and did the same with it before heading to drag an old boom box from beneath his bed. Dean cleared a space on the nightstand and settled it there, then turned it on and began to fiddle with the dials. When he found the right frequency—a local classic rock station he liked that played a nice selection of chilled out and acoustic rock in the evenings—he turned it up and stripped out of his jeans, heading to the bathroom.
“Yes,” Dean exhaled. And then, quieter, “Please.”
feeling?”
“Thanks,” said Claire, and then smirked at Dean and Castiel. “So, who’s Dad and who’s Daddy? Our last name’s Jones, by the way. Keep it simple, easier to fake the IDs.”
“I love you too,” said Castiel, finally managing a small, crooked smile.
Castiel watched as Dean built himself back into a thing of stone, as fascinating as it was heartbreaking, as he turned to Claire.
“Aye, I believe so, but it’ll take some time and tinkering,” Rowena hinted. She looked aside at Dean and raised her brows. “Which is best done with careful concentration, meaning without a broody lumberjack looming over my shoulder.”
“That’s the idea,” Dean teased, and then ate his words: one of Castiel’s hands dragged down around Dean’s hip and slipped underneath to grip his arousal and pull, and in the shock of it, he let out a too-audible moan of his own.
“I have something you might want,” Dean answered. He balled a fist behind his back and pressed his nails into the flesh of his palm, steeling himself against this demon who was—somehow—more frightening than Lucifer had ever seemed to him.
Dean perked up at that. “How long?”
“Hey—” said Sam, stopping in the doorway. “I’m proud of you, Dean.”
“I’ll sleep next to you,” answered Castiel. He kissed Dean harder for a moment, raking his hands back through Dean’s hair and settling them at the back of his neck before pulling away to rest their foreheads together. “I’m trying to tell you I’ve thought about this, and I want this. I want
“No,” agreed Castiel, backing away from Dean with a small sigh through his nostrils. He spread his palms on the table on either side of Dean’s hips and closed his eyes for a moment, stilling his breath.
Castiel leaned in closer, pressing his forehead to Dean’s. “We don’t have to fight,” he soothed quietly. “Just talk to me, Dean. Tell me what you want.”
got back, you acted like everything was fine. I thought—”
Dean’s heart seized, and his skin went cold. He spoke without meaning to, and the voice that came from his lips sounded like it wasn’t his; like it was spoken by someone else at the far end of a hallway, the sound hollow and detached. “Michael.”
Sam huffed out a dry laugh. “Great,” and then set down the jug that held the oil. He pulled out a zippo and the phone again, and said, “Status update, Jack?”
“Yeah you are,” said Dean, and he smirked. He leaned to nip Cas’s bottom lip with a playful growl, and Cas slid his hands down over Dean’s chest, then wound them around Dean's back to pull him flush.
Dean considered for a moment, worrying his bottom lip. He reached over to his phone on the coffee table, checking the time. Nearly ten PM; earlier than he’d usually go to sleep, but hell, it had been a rough week.
Sam is my brother, too. Sam is my family. I want to call him back and tell him, to force him into one of those embraces he always shies away from--but my feet don't move that direction. They move towards the kitchen--towards
“Of course I do,” said Dean, though he didn’t sound at all enthused. “Lemme get my gun.”
“I know you do,” said Sam. He glanced around the table at all the open books, then added, “We’ve got it pretty covered here. Why don’t you—I don’t know. Go for a run or something?”
“For the thousandth time,
“There’s only two bedrooms?” Dean said, wheeling around to gawk at Claire, who nodded. “We are not sharing a bed,” he pointed at Castiel.
Castiel didn’t sleep, but he tried to. He
The rest went quickly; Sam and Jack returned a few moments later to say everything was ready, and they all loaded up their arms with food and drinks to carry it outside and set up a build-your-own-burrito bar out behind the bunker. Dean brought out a radio, and while he fidgeted with the dials, Sam disappeared back inside, then returned a few minutes later wearing a wide grin and toting a frisbee.
“Why doesn’t it?”
Dean woke up screaming. His body was covered in sweat and his heart was racing, but despite it, he was shivering, covered in goosebumps. He sat bolt upright in bed and panted, stared around his bedroom. He touched his face and the sheets to make sure they were real, then turned to his side, looking for Castiel. The bed was empty. He threw off the covers and ran to the bathroom, forced open the door. Empty. He looked for the glass of water he’d given Castiel the night before and found that it, too, was gone. “No, no, no,” he whispered to himself, panic thick and bitter in his throat. He shoved out of the bathroom and looked for something—anything—to prove this was real, that he was free of Michael.
“Dora the Explorer gonna make it?” Dean teased with a grin as Castiel neared.
“You didn’t, Cas. You don’t.”
So when they got home after days of trail mix and beef jerky, they were all worn to the bone—even Castiel—or so Sam thought. They got in just before midnight and Sam was in the shower, so tired he was barely staying on his feet, when the lights again went out, then flickered to red, and the water suddenly ran ice cold before stopping completely.
“Always so dramatic, Sam,” Michael said, rolling his eyes. “I’m merely curious. Nephilim are rare in every universe.” He winked at Jack. “Don’t worry, kid. You’re of no use to me dead—and I

“Listen, Cas, I just—” Dean started, and stopped, words broken up by sighs and frustrated grunts. “I’ve never—I’m not—but it’s
“I’ll stop, if you like.”
“Aye,” she grinned. “It’s that he’s your beau, isn’t he?”
“Annoying,” Michael’s voice groaned. “What’s it going to be, Dean? You said ‘yes’ for Sam. You won’t do the same to save your dear Castiel?”
“He should be back by now,” grumbled Sam as he scrolled through the contacts, then lifted the phone to his ear. “It’s almost seven.”
“Know what else is impossible?”
Rage flared up in Castiel, wild and more complicated than anything he’d felt as an angel—and in the back of his mind he realized this was why Dean flew off the handle so much easier than he did; human anger felt far more impossible to control. “We were meant to
“So, you weren’t…” Sam started, awkwardly. “Because, y’know, we both know—”
Castiel rolled his eyes and gave Dean a small shove. “Go—I don’t know. Take a shower or something.”
“Will morning be too late, if Michael comes back and finds you here?”
Dean tilted his head at Castiel, but didn’t answer, so Sam did instead.
“Probably us,” said Dean, handing off a glass to Castiel and leaning back on a hand. “Since it’s—y’know. Our honeymoon. But we ain’t exactly normal, so maybe…no Michael, no Chuck, no rules. Free will?”
Claire went through every piece of clothing Dean had with him and finally coerced the whining adult into a reasonably stylish outfit: the jeans and shoes he was wearing that he’d refused to take off and a light blue flannel—single layer, she’d insisted, with the sleeves rolled up. With some glasses, Claire joked, they’d look like the perfect hipster couple.
“Hex bag?” Dean wondered.
“Yeah, maybe,” agreed Sam. He smirked again and met Dean’s gaze. “But maybe he’ll change it up. Try to look cool for you, you know, since you’re dating now—”
Castiel pressed his lips. “My grace—my own grace—has been failing me for some time now,” he said. A sign for a county road turnoff approached in the distance, and Castiel slowed to turn. “More slowly than the archangel grace is burning out, but with Chuck—God—gone…” He trailed off, swinging the car’s long body left across the other lane to rumble it down the empty street. “My wings should be the least of my worries,” he finally finished.
“I’m not making a face!”
“It’s not a problem,” Castiel answered. He smiled and crooked a brow, settled his hand over Dean’s on his cheek. “When, though?”
“Yes?”
“Okay, dig in,” he said, smiling easily—more easily than he remembered smiling in years, as Castiel claimed the seat on his other side and Jack the one across from him.
“Ahhh!” Sam hissed, trying to draw back instinctively, but Rowena lifted his hand and directed it over the goblet to let the blood trickle inside. “You could’ve warned me!”
“Yeah,” said Sam. “Same one I mentioned a few days ago. I just—so, we’d need an archangel to wield the blade. When Cas had Michael’s grace, it might have worked because he was already an angel, but even that was a stretch. Now the blade’s pretty useless, but…” He ran his hands through his hair. “I don’t know. I’m reading about the War of Heaven and Hell. There’s talk of weapons that could hurt archangels, but none have been named so far. Which is why I need to focus.”
Castiel stared down at Dean and pushed wet hair from Dean’s eyes as Dean pulled back from the kiss, then threw back his head and laughed, deep and loud. Dean smiled up at him, blinking in the rain, and then released Castiel to pat him on the thigh.
Dean quirked an apologetic grin, but otherwise waved Castiel off. “Okay, fine. How about…” he cleared his throat and, mimicking Castiel, said, “At least I don’t look like a lumberjack.”
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Cas wondered quietly, rising to pace over and join Dean on the couch.
“They are not equal,” said Castiel, grimacing.
Position: Final song on side 2
At first it was easy. After all, it wasn’t Dean. This was a demon, and unlike Sam, Cas didn’t have much hope that the cure would work. It got harder when Dean started talking, when he sounded more like himself, and Cas got close. Let his guard down. The angel leaned forward over the chair, hands on Dean’s shoulders, to get a closer look at not-quite-Dean’s eyes. To inspect the black that coated them like oil. Dean shoved his neck out and kissed him, hard. Castiel recoiled, and Dean laughed.
Dean pulled his arms more securely around Castiel—protectively, as if he could stop whatever was raging inside the angel—and stayed up holding him all night, checking his pulse, watching his chest rise and fall with his breath.
“How could you possibly—”
“Sam, it’s time,” interrupted Dean. The glow in Castiel’s eyes flickered like a dying lightbulb, then dimmed, and finally disappeared entirely. The only blue that remained were his irises, and though beautiful, Dean noticed the blue was a bit darker—a little less light.
“I was just playing the role,” Castiel said, though he notably deflated. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“I hoped you would,” said Dean. “This whole thing with your grace—sort of a blessing in disguise, much as it sucks. Forcing us to lay low, you know? Giving us some time like this.”
“Alright,” said Dean, sighing. He pushed himself up and reached back for Castiel. “C’mon. Can you make it to the bathroom?”
Behind him stood Cas, but he wasn't quite right. And he wasn’t standing so much as hovering, arms behind his back—in the mist that was rolling suddenly in, his legs were obscured, and Dean couldn’t tell if Cas’s feet were touching the ground.
While they talked, Dean left Castiel’s side and moved around the kitchen, collecting utensils and cookware. He quietly gave Sam instructions, and within a minute or two, the brothers were beside each other at the counter, chopping vegetables, elbowing each other and bickering like everything was normal.
“Are you sure you want to go there?” Dean warned, and then threw up his hands, accusing, “Can we just work the job, please? I swear, man, it’s like you want to fight.”
“No, you’re not,” Sam replied simply, “And if your head’s not in it you don’t need to be out there. Go to the house, have your domestic spat, and fix it. You’re driving everyone crazy.”
“I like this,” said Jack, simply, beaming a grin at Sam.
“Oh,” said Castiel again. He stared at Dean, then leaned back on his hands to look out over the water. “What does that mean?”
“I figured,” said Sam. “Help me carry all this out? We’re going to eat in the war room.”
“Of course not!” Dean yelled back. He threw his arms to his side in frustration.
“Then I suppose you’re fine with killing Dean with an archangel blade?” said Rowena.
They arrived to find Jack dumping what must have been at least the third or fourth mixing bowl full of ice into the quickly-filling tub. He looked up as they entered, and his face paled. “Is he…?”
“You’re…acting weird,” Dean countered badly, clearing his throat. “M’gonna get dressed, okay? Show’s over.”
Castiel sighed into it and stepped forward, pushing Dean tenderly backwards into the shower’s wall. Dean made a low sound in his throat that vibrated against Castiel’s lips, pushed his hand up from Castiel’s cheek into his hair. Even in the shower’s heat, Castiel shivered so hard he broke the kiss to look down at his arm in shock at the visible goosebumps.
“Charming as always,” Rowena answered, flashing Dean a close-lipped, simpering smile.
“Who’s ‘we?’” asked Jack, unhelpfully.
Dean grunted a little into the kiss, breaking it just a bit to rub his nose against Castiel’s. “You’ll have to eat,” he said.
“Yeah,” said Dean, simply. His lips twitched in the barest smile as he looked up in time to watch Jack shake the frisbee loose but cling to the branch he’d climbed to, from which he now hung—just a hair too high for Castiel to reach him.
Jack lowered his chin in thought for a moment, staring at nothing, then cracked a small grin. “Dean would ask for a beer,” he said. “Or a bottle of whiskey.”
Dean blinked at Castiel as understanding settled sadly over his face. “…right. Okay. I—I’m sorry, Cas. This has—it’s just got me spun out. Michael and the grace, and this new thing with us, it’s…”
“I don’t,” said Castiel. “But that was before you made the rule.”
Dean blew out a long breath through his nose and listened for a moment, then sang along as he rounded a sharp curve, tires squealing, voice lost to the bluesy guitar and Robert Plant’s loud crooning. “But baby, since I’ve been loving you, yeah, I’m about to lose my worried mind.”
On the other side of the room, when Sam’s breathing had evened into soft snoring, Dean opened his eyes to stare at the white popcorn ceiling.
“Why don’t you take Jack grocery shopping? Cas is human for a little while. He’s gonna be hungry. Get some of his favorites?”
“No, it’s—seriously, this is awesome, Cas. But I just—it’s been chaos, you know? I was looking forward to having you back home, and I thought you might be ready to be home too.”
human, are you?” Dean asked softly, musing. “Not really.”
“Dean, it’s alright,” said Cas. “We don’t have to—”
“I won’t if you won’t,” Dean replied.
“Just for a little while,” Sam said apologetically. He tapped the end-call button as it went to voicemail, then scrolled down and pressed the call button on another number. “For Jack. He’s so excited.”

Dean shook his head, still staring past Cas at the spinning record. “I don’t use vinyl.”
The pair was so wrapped up in each other, they didn’t notice the lightbulbs in the library, usually dim, begin to blaze. Yellow light turned to white as they burned brighter and brighter, and finally a low buzzing began radiating off the glass. Dean and Castiel finally broke apart when the bulbs began to burst, one by one, showering the room in sparks. They watched as the popping extended beyond the library, down the hall, and into the kitchen, and finally with an electric heave the Bunker powered down into darkness. Seven seconds passed, and the emergency lights surged to life to bath their world in crimson.
“I don’t know,” said Cas. He wrapped both hands around the hot mug and added, soft and sad, “He won’t touch me, Sam. Or let me touch him.”
“And when it does it’s that much less that you’ll have.”
Inside, Sam and Rowena hovered over Jack, who was passed out on the spell-ingredient-strewn bed. He was pale, and a trickle of blood ran from his nose, but he appeared to be breathing. “He’s alright?” asked Castiel as he bumped the hotel door closed and walked to the other bed to gently spread Dean out on its length.
Sam shrugged. “I had a dog,” he said simply, and with a nod of understanding, Dean let it go.
Despite the lack of sleep, Dean wasn’t tired, and when Sam joined him in the kitchen he all but shoved breakfast down his brother’s throat.
Sam smiled. “I don’t think many hunters do.”
,” Rowena said. “And that’s a non-magical stone. We’re combining magic and science. The laws of nature will only bend so far.”
“You planning on force feeding him to death?”
alight where the blanket had been, but it was difficult to tell from this distance. What Dean could see was Castiel lift an arm and reach out a hand towards him, beckoning him back to shore. Dean’s chest swelled, and he began wading his way back to solid ground.
“I once…led armies,” Castiel slurred back, punctuated by a hiccup. His eyes were closed as he slumped against Dean, letting himself be dragged along limply.
“Fantastic,” said Dean. “So, what—I’m going to be a P.E. teacher again?”
“Power enough to crush you, insect,” said Michael, tilting his head, and suddenly static rippled through the air, causing the hairs on everyone’s arms to stand on end.
“Hmmph,” Castiel laughed a little, turning his full attention back to the road. He was quiet for a while longer, and when he spoke again, he was serious once more. “I know my wings are lost, whatever choice I make,” he said. “I’ve accepted that. Well—mostly.”
“Yeah,” Dean answered, flexing and turning his hand a little. He looked back up at Castiel. “Feels like it was made for me.”
“So what do you think I should do?” Castiel asked Jack as he pushed the faded blue ‘57 Ford Skyliner down the road—the most inconspicuous of the conspicuously vintage cars left in the Bunker’s garage. The motor was loud and rough, the vibrations rattling up through the seat and into Castiel’s bones, but he liked the sensation; it was grounding, a feeling he could trust in its reality. “What would you do?”
“Then let me,” said Jack, finally speaking up. “We can’t lose you, Cas. Without my powers, I’m—”
(See the end of the chapter for
SAMMY [9:49 AM]: Better yet, call Cas.
Castiel exhaled slowly and leaned his forehead back against Dean’s, closing his eyes. “Just feels too good to be true.”
“Take it,” Dean answered before Castiel could finish.
Sam smirked. “Yeah. The Seal of Solomon. We think that’s what Michael has, and what he used to skip worlds.”
Castiel’s head lolled forward, but he didn’t wake. Dean crouched and pulled Castiel’s left arm over his shoulder, winding his right around the angel’s back, and Sam mirrored him. They scooted him to the edge and on the count of three, lifted to bear Castiel limply across the room, up the stairs, and down the hall, his feet dragging the floor uselessly between them.
“You should’ve told me,” Dean said. “I would’ve stayed.”
“What made him so angry?” Castiel asked. “Why are
“How can you be so sure?”
Sam sat in the kitchen, drinking the last dregs of the morning’s coffee with his lunch while he absently scrolled through the local news, looking for cases. Across from him, Jack was pouring his third (or fourth) bowl of brightly-colored, sugary cereal of the day. The noise made Sam look up from his reading, and he sighed.
“Prayers? No,” said Castiel. “But I don’t get many.”
“I don’t need anything but you.”
Dean pressed his lips in answer and looked away. “Any progress?”
“No, man, I’m serious. You’re—family. And, y’know. I don’t think we tell you enough, but you’re important, Cas. We—I need you. You dragged me out of Hell and I can’t get over myself for a few hours to work a case.” Dean ran his free hand through his hair and sighed. “So—you’re right. I’ll stow my shit and play my role for this case. I’m sorry.”
“You don’t like it.”
“Dunno yet, but I’m chasing a lead,” said Sam. He reached for a bookmarked leather-bound journal and leaned in to hand it to Dean. “Here, you can—ugh.”
he sent back.
“Dude, you’d be Crowley’s stepdad,” said Dean.
“Dean?”
“Ready…” Rowena murmured, poising her fingers around the edges of the ball of smoke. “And…now.” Castiel inhaled deep and slow, and Rowena murmured one more foreign word as she stretched out her hands, forming the smoke from a ball into a thick, red rope that wound its way down Castiel’s throat.
I sigh. I don't mean to, but I sigh. How very typically Winchester of him. A long time ago, I would've said I didn't understand, but now I do. Now, I've been there--felt that need to swaddle feeling, to protect it like an infant. And the frustration instantly fades. I can't find it within me to be angry at his deflecting. Not anymore. Not this time.
Castiel’s features mirrored Dean’s. “Two weeks,” he answered softly, thoughtfully. “It seems time here moves differently.”
“Grill ready?” Dean asked as he loped into the kitchen, heading for the fridge.
“That’s not what I said,” answered Rowena curtly. She watched Sam’s blood trickle into the goblet until it coated the herbs and resins in the bottom, then released it. “That’ll do, Samuel.”
“Cas?” Dean ventured, voice catching. “Is that—is it really you?”
Just as the thought that this might be what it was like to not yet be born, Dean’s lungs prickled with need, and the weightless sensation vanished. He blew bubbles through his nose and planted his feet back into the sand, breaking the surface of the water with a gasp. He rubbed his hands over his eyes and looked back up at the moon, then turned around to see where he was. The current had carried him fifteen or so feet to the left of where he’d walked in, his body now in the vast, dark part of the sea the moonlight didn’t touch. Castiel stood at the edge of the water, almost shining, and behind him something
“Fine.”
“I want you to leave Dean,” said Castiel, staring intensely into Michael’s eyes, a blue light reflection of his own. “Or I will end my life and end us both” Castiel backstepped and flipped the blade around, pressing the point to his chest.
“Can we do anything?” asked Jack as he backed away.
Sam and Jack were silent for a few beats, considering, and finally Sam said with a little chuckle, “…yeah. Fair point.”
“Dean, stop,” Sam interrupted, shaking his head. “God didn’t kill Belial. He locked him up like he locked up Lucifer and the Darkness.”
Dean lowered Castiel in until the water covered his shoulders and carefully let his head loll back against the lip of the tub, but the angel didn’t stir.
“Just
“Where have you taken me?” Castiel growled, taking a defensive stance.
he wants are his problem. Not yours. I know you’re worried about your brother, but he’ll be alright. And whatever happens between he and I, I’m not going anywhere. Alright? Like you said, we’re family.”
Sam had just wrenched open the bunker door and was ushering Jack inside when Michael’s yell came out. He forced Jack into the hallway, but the three men hesitated at the threshold, looking back to the archangel, who cocked his head and smiled, blood coating his vessel’s teeth.
“Now shut up and go to sleep.”
When they arrived at their fake home, they found Claire lounging at the bare kitchen table drinking a beer, the remainder of the six-pack and a handle of cheap whiskey to her left.
“You were—we were dancing,” said Castiel, searching Dean’s gaze. “Could we—would it be okay if—”
“You don’t need to be sorry,” echoed Castiel. “I’m the one who walked in on something I wasn’t meant to see.”
Just as he spoke the room got heavier—they both felt the weight of the intimacy the seldom-used full name carried—and in the same moment, Jack burst through the door, arms laden with paper sacks, and he announced cheerily, “We got burritos, and burgers, and…”
“Yes.”
“I can’t—I can’t tell,” Dean said, and stumbled backwards. “You gotta check. I can’t, I can’t, Sammy, not again, I can’t—”
“Okay,” said Dean around the frog in his throat. “Okay but you—you have to be okay. With this archangel grace or whatever. Right now, you have to be okay.”
“I warded the cloth,” said Sam, walking slowly toward Castiel. “So Michael wouldn’t feel it either.”
“I know it isn’t,” sighed Castiel. They dissolved into an uncomfortable silence until Castiel asked, “Is there anything I can do? Anything you need?”
Dean snorted a little. “You do know us.”
“It doesn’t,” said Cas softly.
“Little warning never hurt,” said Dean, his head still spinning, “But—y’know. S’okay. It wasn’t
“And how did it feel when you watched them stumble into bed?”
“Sure thing, Cas,” said Sam, grinning easily. He rocked back on his heels and cleared his throat, shooting Dean a pointed glance. “Dean? You with us?”
“Give you something to think about,” said Dean, grinning wolfishly. “Y’know, for later.” He dried himself off quickly, rubbed the towel over his hair, and then tossed it to Castiel, who barely caught it. “Sammy’s gonna wonder, so I’ll meet you out there?”
“Of course I’m not!” yelled Dean. He grabbed the front of Castiel’s shirt on instinct, but released it almost instantly, taking a step back, eyes widening.
know is you do something to me, and I don’t know what to do with it—because there’s so
Castiel’s voice cut through the red haze of Dean’s anger and fear. He looked up at the man in the doorway, his terrified expression, and his own chest heaved. Hot tears spilled down Dean’s cheeks, and he became suddenly aware of the throbbing pain in his hands. He meant to say Castiel’s name, but instead, without meaning to, he simply croaked, “Are you real?”
Dean snorted. “Shut up,” he said, and filled his brother’s glass, allowing a little grin. He set the bottle back down and leaned against the desk, swirling his whiskey, though he stared over the rim of his glass at Castiel. “It really doesn’t matter?” he asked, almost a whisper.
“Sam!” Dean yelled as soon as he was in the hallway, striking out for the kitchen. “Hey, Sammy!”
“It’s made, as far as I can tell, from a melted-down angel blade,” murmured Castiel, watching Dean pore over the ring. At that, Dean’s eyes shot up to Castiel, and his brows lifted. Castiel smiled but continued. “I haven’t been able to figure out its purpose, exactly. But it’s hollow.” He reached out his hand to Dean, and Dean tilted the ring back into Castiel’s palm. Castiel angled the ring into the light and pointed out a tiny inscription of some kind of magical symbol printed on the inside. “That symbol acts almost like a door,” he said, before offering the ring back to Dean to look it over. “Or a seal. At first I thought it might be containing something malevolent, but…well, I tried to figure it out, using my grace. Instead it pulled a piece of my grace inside.”
“Michael killed him,” said Dean, shaking his head. Unlike Sam, he didn’t bother concealing the ache of resignation in his voice or his own tears. They rolled down his cheeks so freely and steadily that they left dark spots of moisture on the collar of his shirt where they fell. “Michael k—” he gulped. “Michael shot him in the head and it’s on me. Cas is dead and it’s my fault.”
Castiel’s face smoothed into stoicism as he listened for something Dean couldn’t hear. His nose twitched and he angled his head just slightly to one side and said, “No one is awake. Rowena talks in her sleep, though.”
“Yeah,” said Sam, clearing his throat.
When Cas is under Rowena’s spell, and Dean is so gentle with him in the bunker, takes such care to wrap him in blankets, lets his hands linger just a bit too long on the angel’s shoulders.
“Dad’s alive?”
“Well, any sexually transmitted diseases Jimmy Novak may have had were healed when I claimed this vessel,” said Castiel, completely deadpan—unbothered. “So it’s unlikely you’ve got one now. Though when I have my grace back I can check your—”
“Yeah, ‘course,” said Dean, knee-jerk. He started for the door again but faltered. In his chest, a warmth wrapped itself around his heart, squeezing uncharacteristically soft words up to his lips. He shifted to face Castiel again before he could talk himself out of the vulnerability and looked him in the eye. “I’ll always take care of you.” Castiel was quiet, staring intently back at Dean, and Dean felt suddenly too exposed and raw. “Starting with lunch,” he said, defusing the tension. “C’mon, sunshine.”
“Uhh…” Sam dumped the bottle into his palm and counted quickly. “Twenty-six.”
Castiel peered over at Sam. Dean’s fingers flinched just slightly tighter around his own. “Because what?”
“He’s going to be okay, Dean,” said Sam gently, holding out his glass to Dean.
“Fair enough,” said Sam. He looked up to Dean and cleared his throat. “So, Cas, we should talk now that Dean’s here.”
Dean watched him disappear into the hallway, the soft rustle of the angel’s trench coat reminding him of missing wings.
“Then I suggest you get him to a chair,” Rowena grinned. She lifted her hands, splaying fingers towards the three of them. “Somnum summatim.”
“That’s fair,” said Dean, chuckling softly. He sat up a moment later, considering Castiel, lip pursed in thought. “You still think of this as a vessel?” he asked, reaching out to give Castiel’s knee a little thump. “I dunno, man. To me this is
The only one who’d give you crap over it is Dad, and he’s not here. Nobody cares.
“The Bad Place, Apocalypse World…” Sam listed.
Dean’s chest heaved and his vision felt untrustworthy, but he nodded to Castiel. The angel nodded back and draped the blanket over his own bare shoulders, then gently coaxed Dean forward away from the door. Dean let himself be handled, and with gentle effortlessness, Castiel turned him in the seat so that Dean’s back came to rest against his chest. He scooted them back so that it was Castiel now leaning against a door, and Dean leaning against him. He wrapped the blanket around them both, and Dean closed his eyes, letting his head fall back against Castiel’s shoulder.
Position: Final song on side 2
?” Castiel balked.
“I’ve done it before.”
“Like I said,” answered Castiel, still mouthing the skin of Dean’s neck. “I’ve been searching for this for my entire existence. Before you, there was only duty. Now there’s reason. Purpose. That’s not something angels are meant to have. Don’t underestimate how significant you are. How rare this is.”
“Calm down, Hulk Hogan,” Dean said with a smile, hoping his voice didn’t waver too much. “Let’s get you in fighting shape first, huh?” Castiel tilted his head, bravado fading a bit, and Dean held up his phone to explain. “Sam and Jack are back. You still hungry?”
“Glad you’re enjoying yourself,” snorted Dean. He slid the boom box aside on the dresser and settled the turntable in its place, then simply opted to move the boom box to the floor, replacing it with the bag of records. Dean fumbled for a moment with the cords and the settings, and then pulled a record from the sack. “Listen,” he said softly over to the angel as he slid the vinyl from the sleeve and settled it on the turntable.
“You’re okay,” whispered Dean, panic in his voice and eyes. He knelt down beside the chair to keep his head level with Castiel’s. “You’re okay, Cas.”
“Then I am false,” said Castiel, turning his gaze briefly to the sky, a prayer to his Father. “And perhaps I am damned, because I feel no guilt.” He blew out a breath through his nose and looked back to Dean, smaller now further out. If he focused hard, he could pick up Dean’s steady heartbeat, and Castiel tried to hold on to that as he broke his gaze away from his lover to start digging into the duffel bag behind him.
“Romantic,” said Dean, clearing his throat. He looked down at his hands and sighed, standing. “I’ll get you a new record player.”
“Who, then, protects the rest of creation from the humans?” Michael snapped back. He crowded into Castiel’s space, forcing him closer to the cliff’s edge.
Castiel moaned low in his chest and dragged his hands down to hold Dean by the hips, pulling him in closer, harder, as he arched back up into him. He hooked his fingers into Dean’s belt loops and pulled impatiently, gathering a little chuckle from Dean, who reached down between them and, after a moment of fidgeting, had loosened both Castiel’s button and zipper and his own. He helped Castiel push them down, boxers and all, while Castiel angled up to use his heels to awkwardly shuffle his own off from the end, but it was enough.
“No, he’s alive,” Sam answered, and relief visibly swept over Jack’s face.
He found it empty, but the coffee machine was still on, the pot full. At the end of the table sat a plate heaped high with now-cold bacon and an empty mug that read “World’s Okayest Dad” that Jack had purchased from a gag shop with Sam’s help, which he had then gifted to Dean, not understanding it was a joke. Dean smiled vaguely at the memory and filled it with hot coffee, then splashed in the remaining whiskey for good measure. He abandoned the empty bottle and tugged his phone from his pocket, texting Sam with one hand.
“I love you,” answered Castiel. And then, with a smirk, “Let’s argue more often.”
Castiel shuffled a bit, then awkwardly pulled an envelope from his back pocket. “I’ve actually had this for a long time,” he said, turning the folded envelope in his hands. “I found it in the Bunker years ago, and I took it and hid it. Just in case. But I never thought…” He trailed off, thumbing over the paper and the hard lump in one corner of it, something like sadness mixed with joy thrilling in his veins.
Jack was sitting cross-legged on the bed, the ingredients of the spell spread out methodically before him. Rowena handed him a sheet of paper and set the hotel phone on the bed nearby. “Ready,” he said.
