“Cas, your socks,” Dean said, still laughing. Castiel was confused for a second, then he too looked down. He was wearing his favourite pair of socks, the yellow ones with the bees.
“I know you’re not. I know Sammy isn’t either, too. I guess it’s time I accept that.” Dean sounded defeated.
Specifically, Cas stops him by wrapping his hand around Dean’s wrist. His huge, strong, manly hand.
“Thank you, Dean. Your assessment of my attractiveness means a lot.”
“I, um, I didn’t know you were into… that.” He said lamely, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck. Cas frowned.
Castiel nodded. This approach provided a logical pattern that he could follow. He let Dean guide him through the shoes section, where after some deliberation he selected a pair of running shoes. The label said they were optimal for distance running and would support the arches of his feet, which he thought would be helpful since he found himself running from and towards monsters a lot. Emboldened by his small victory, he proceeded to pick out a selection of socks, one pair blue, one red and one yellow with little bees printed on it.
“You know what,” he whispered, “I think it’s a great idea.”
“It shouldn’t be!” Sam glared openly at Dean.
“Ineedyoutofuckme” Christ, was it possible to be more pathetic?
“You don’t understand? That’s rich, cause I’ve been trying to understand you but you haven’t made it exactly easy, Cas!”
Well, of course he did. Having a wet dream in the goddamn living room next to his best friend must not have been humiliating enough for the universe’s sick, sick sense of humor.
Studiously avoiding eye contact he reaches for a pillow--because it’s not like he has any room for subtlety, here--but Cas stops him.
Dean squirmed and Cas kissed his way down Dean’s torso, fingers finding his abused hole and easing inside so, so gently. Dean sighed in relief and embarrassment.
“Then why are you calling me? Are you okay, Dean?”
“But what about hookups?” Dean asked then. They were outside, listening to the steady hum of the bees. “I get not wanting a relationship--” big filthy lie, Dean Winchester, “--but everybody needs to knock boots sometimes. Wait, don’t tell me you’ve never…” he trailed off, disbelieving. Sure, Cas was a bit odd and not at all the stereotypical macho Alpha guy, but he was good looking and smelled nice and Dean couldn’t believe no pretty Omega lady had tried to get herself a piece of that. Cas blushed a little.
“Hello, Dean.”
His musings were interrupted by Cas pointing at a corner stool and saying: “There, the young man with the tattoo on his forearm,” and Dean nearly spat a mouthful of beer.
It’s a dream, so Dean doesn’t question it; it’s a dream, so Dean allows himself to taste and suck deeply, and Cas moans deep and low and drifts closer. There’s a ghost of a touch on Dean’s dick and he jerks his hips enthusiastically into it, spurred by Cas closing his eyes and moaning, Dean, Dean…
“That’s bizarre. When I compliment you on your soul you are usually very visibly flustered.”
“Cas, I…” Dean seemed like he was about to argue or perhaps cry again. He looked about, casting for words, then smiled suddenly. He chuckled and finally laughed, a deep belly laugh that Castiel felt reverberating in his bones.
“I don’t understand the purpose of being human if you’re going to be boring about it.”
“Not in the mood tonight, Cas?” He asked. His green eyes were bright with the influence of alcohol, which was close enough to happiness. Castiel stared at him.
“I’m just sayin’” Dean was truly enjoying himself now. “With those baby blues there and his clueless shtick, I’m pretty sure all the ladies here will be goners. You’re gonna be stuck with Rosie Palm, Sammy.”
“You could stay, you know,” he offered, and Castiel considered it, but decided that he would rather wake up in the motel room with Sam and Dean rather than in Danny’s unfamiliar apartment.
He leans forward and sucks.
“Cas,” he says carefully. “Either you didn’t enjoy what we just did at all, in which case I’d feel like the world’s shittiest friend…” he sneaks a quick glance to Cas’s crotch to check that it’s not the case, and thankfully his friend looks rock hard in his stupid slacks. “Or you did and you think I just wouldn’t reciprocate. In which case I’d also feel like the world’s shittiest friend.”
“Dean,” he said then. “I think… I think that since you are going to win a bet on the basis that I had sex I--ah!--I think I am entitled to partake of the prize.”
“I’ll show you insulting…” Dean was surely about to unleash a string of colorful words, but they were interrupted by a waitress asking them to take their lovers’ spat elsewhere. Needless to say, this did nothing to improve Dean’s mood; they made the drive back to the motel in stony silence.
One thing Castiel knew very well was that talking to Dean Winchester required a lot of finesse, planning and copious amounts of alcohol. The last item on the list was relatively easy to obtain, as Dean was thrilled when Castiel suggested they go out and drink; he was rarely the one to suggest it. Dean seemed in high spirits, and Castiel waited until he had imbibed a beer, then two, then three, then he suggested they drink shots and Dean laughed and took him up on that suggestion eagerly. Castiel watched his throat when Dean tipped his head back to down his shot, watched the adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. He was not the only person in the bar watching, but he had glared at every person who had looked at Dean or himself with even a hint of interest--tonight he was on a mission and he would not be derailed. Dean had noticed this but, to Castiel’s relief, he had not taken offense or insisted they go and find willing bedfellows for the night; he had simply laughed it off.
“You scare the motherfucking hell out of me,” Dean said, sounding surprisingly sober.
Being Omega sucked, and not in the fun way. His only saving grace was when his Uncle Bobby offered him a job at his salvage yard in South Dakota, because Bobby was a grumpy old man who would rather hack off his own right hand than talk about designation-related crap, so he quietly scheduled a week off for Dean every couple of months and got him halfway decent insurance so he could afford decent suppressants and never, ever mentioned a thing about it.
Dean came back a few hours later, thoroughly intoxicated. Castiel felt him enter the room, stumble into the bathroom and vomit loudly and, although he was still angry, he sighed, got up and went to Dean. He rubbed his back gently as he threw up and handed him a glass of water when he was finished.He realized that there were tears pooling in Dean’s eyes, running down on his cheeks.
Dean fell back on the pillow, mouth open, as Cas ate him out like he was starving. As incredible as Cas’s hands and mouth felt on him, though, eventually Dean felt his Heat rear its ugly head and demand more. He felt the urge building up inside him, tears gathering at the corners of his eyes and he begged, full-on begged to be fucked, even though he knew he was a selfish bastard, that Cas didn’t even like sex and was going out of his way for Dean and he shoulda just shut up and say ‘thank you and--
Well, Dean hadn’t become the skilled hunter he was today without being able to react quickly to what someone would call an Unexpected Situation. He reached up to card his fingers through Cas’s hair, like he’d wanted to do for a long fucking time, and it was soft and wild under his hands, and Cas’s shoulders, when he got to them, were broad and strong and perfect in every way except there were so many stupid layers covering his skin, and Dean had always secretly loved Cas’s trenchcoat because it kinda made him look sexy and badass, like a secret agent or something, but now he could set the damn thing on fire. He managed to convey this sentiment by pulling roughly on the lapels, and Cas leaned backwards fractionally to allow him to slide the coat off.
“Don’t ever change, Cas,” he said softly. “I don’t fucking know what’s gonna happen in the morning but…”
Bastard.
Music appeared to be another important feature of being a human and although Castiel wasn’t quite as passionate about it as Dean, he somehow ended up in possession of a second hand Johnny Cash cassette, which he popped into the Impala’s stereo those rare times it was his turn to choose the music. He found it soothing.
He was pleased. He glanced at his own bed, where the pile of his new belongings waited to be sorted and folded and put away in his bag. For the first time, he understood the dangers of greed, of being attached to material possessions. Before, he’d had strong feelings for his humans, for people, and objects had been merely functional to him. Now he saw it. They weren’t much, but he understood how the clothes he chose to wear were an intrinsic part of him, they marked his existence as a human on this plane. It was thrilling.
“Why the hell not?”
“What wrong idea is there to ‘get’, Dean?” Castiel frowned. “I didn’t mean to say that I care about you. I do, but I care about quite a few people, I even care about things. I love you.”
So basically, the problem with having Cas in the bunker with them is this: it’s great, but Dean’s fucked.
“Dean,” Sam interjected, bitchily. “Are you sure it’s a good idea to teach Cas the gospel of one-night-stands?”
Dean’s smile changed, growing from amused to impossibly tender. He brought his hand up to cup the back of Castiel’s neck.
“The problem is that it’s you. Because as long as we’re buddies, and we’re both banging chicks it’s good, alright? But when you start… when you start hooking up with guys too… it’s like there’s no more reasons not to… not too…”
When Castiel let himself silently back into the room, Dean was still awake.
Castiel’s second sexual encounter took place in Boston, after they hunted down a restless ghost that had been carving intricate roses on people’s backs and leaving his victims to die of exsanguination. The man had been a gardener in life. After they burned down the last tree he had planted, the one that his soul had attached itself to, Castiel and the Winchester brothers went to a bar to celebrate by drinking alcohol.
“That’s a word for it.”
“Is this what this is about? That dickface back in Boston? I said I was fucking sorry, Cas, okay, I get it, you’re gay, it’s all good we can hug now and I’ll take you to the fucking Pride Parade!”
“Yes.” Cas’s eyes travel down from Dean’s face to his crotch and back up again. “Help you.”
Castiel stared blankly at him, and Danny looked worried. “Hey, man I haven’t offended you, have I? Sometimes I don’t think enough before I speak.”
“Dean,” Cas murmured, one of his big hands coming to rest on Dean’s back, rubbing soothing circles between his shoulder blades.
“Not at all.” Cas smiled serenely. “Dean, I might not feel the same… drive most people do but I can and do enjoy sex. I just don’t like being made to feel inadequate and you definitely haven’t done that.”
“Look, Sammy’s a dick, you don’t have to listen to anything the mop-headed lug says--”
He pondered the matter for a long while. The first journal he had bought was long since finished, so he had bought another one, and wrote down all of Dean’s strange behavior, along with Sam’s somewhat confusing advice, to try and make sense of all of it. He couldn’t.
“You are an infuriating man,” Castiel said, though there was no heat to his words. “What is it that you find so funny?”
“Um.” Dean has zero fucking idea what the protocol is for this kind of situation. He doesn’t have to explain what just happened to Cas, does he? He had been human for, like, months. He actually had sex (bad, BAD thought, Dean). Surely he must know by now how things--adult things--work. Or whatever, he can Google it; Dean is going to get off (wait, no), get up (NOPE), leave this couch as soon as he can figure out how to do that without treating Cas to an unwelcome sighting of his perv boner and he will lock himself in his room, jerk off and shoot himself in the head.
Castiel frowned at the white t-shirt he was holding.
“Into… what?” He couldn’t be this fucking clueless. He just couldn’t be. Dean considered shooting himself.
Dean stilled. He could hear the quiet breaths in the space between them.
“Well?” Sam asked. “The guy seems really into you.”
(Heh).
Dean knows that in, like, Ye Old Times or something, women used to be so covered up that men would go batshit crazy at the sight of an ankle. It’s one of those things that everybody knows. Dean always thought it sounded stupid cause, come on, ankles? Okay, ankles can be nice and all, and all right, if you don’t get to see that much skin it sort of makes sense you’d fixate on every bit of it you could get, but still. He always sort of thought it was an exaggeration.
“That had not occurred to me,” said Cas stiffly,
Sam came back then, holding a travel bag, the soft kind you’d hoist over your shoulder with a strap. A duffel bag. He tossed it in the cart. “Thought you’d need something to put all that in,” he said, and Castiel nodded gratefully. He paid for his new things with a credit card that said ‘John Fogerty’ and as soon as they were back in their shared motel room he went to the bathroom to change. (Dean had explained to him, looking very red in the face, that it was not the done thing to change in front of one’s friends.)
“Come on, Dean,” Sam interjected from where he was picking out denim trousers. “Leave Cas alone. Him making his own choices is the point here, remember?”
“I’m not--okay, nope, not doing this. You complimented her how?”
He put on a pair of boxers, the blue jeans, the yellow bee socks, the running shoes, the ‘Good Girls Go to Heaven, Bad Girls Go Backstage’ t-shirt.
Great job, Dean.
“And we should spend it somewhere nice. Maybe a steak dinner?”
He finally decided he was going to try and talk to Dean. It was the only reasonable thing to do.
Cas still looked puzzled, like Dean was the one who, what came out to him after years of friendship or something.
His cache of personal belongings kept growing. He had a gun now, and a small silver knife, an analog watch and a journal and pens so he could write down all the new and interesting things human life had to offer. Since he still had a lot to learn he also acquired books, books about how to converse and cook and dress and act. He made lists of novels and movies that were apparently very important to know, and Dean teased about him but also sat with him through all three Star Wars movies, despite having already seen them, which Castiel greatly appreciated. He liked the robots the best, especially the small blue and white one. It reminded him of Dean, somehow.
“I’m lonely,” Cas said, and now he wasn’t looking at Dean and Dean stared at him.
“N-n-n…”
“I needed it, but it still wasn’t enough,” Dean gasped, “Cas, please…!”
“Yeah, that’s the point!” And okay, Dean didn’t mean to raise his voice but fuck everything, he’d never allowed himself to even entertain the thought that Cas might… that he could… because that was just ridiculous and, and bizarre. Not wrong, Dean would never think that but… okay, maybe a little. Angels were supposed to be pure and shit, and now what, Cas was hankering for a good ol’ fashioned dicking down?
“...but you’ve not been human for very long, I think you should give it a little more time before you start trolling the bars for hookups.”
They’re just… they’re very big. Cas is slightly shorter than him but his hands are bigger than Dean’s--he doesn’t know exactly how much, because he can’t exactly do that girly thing where they hold up their palm to yours and coo ‘ooh your hand is SO MUCH BIGGER than mine!’ Yeah, no. That’s like, Flirting 101. So it’s all guesswork and speculation. And Dean knows damn well that the rule re: hand and dick size is bullshit, but. Speculation. And it’s not just about that. Dean’s had some truly embarrassing thoughts about how Cas’s hands might fit on his face, for example. Would they cradle the whole thing? Chin to temple? Would they be warm? They look like they would be warm. And slightly rough. And his fingers, they are long, thick, strong… Dean has to fight the urge to swallow noisily if he looks at them for too long.
“Okay, okay! I get it. I care about you too,” Dean said very quickly. “Jesus, man. We have to work on how you say stuff. Wouldn’t want anyone getting the wrong idea.”
“I didn’t want you to feel… obligated.”
When he came to, Cas was awkwardly trying to shuffle out of his clothes while still locked inside Dean and trying not to jostle him. He looked kind of adorable, with his teeth worrying at his bottom lip in concentration as he braced himself up on one arm and tried to undo his buttons one-handed. Dean exhaled a weak laugh and reached up to help him.
Dean did not look back up after the little speech because, Jesus, now he felt stupid and inadequate and his neck and ears burned red with humiliation.
“Yeah, yeah, I get it, you used to be super amazing and all-powerful and we puny humans could never. Newsflash, Cthulhu, you’re one of us now. And if you don’t give a shit about ‘genitals’, how come you’ve been trying to get into the pants of everyone in this bar for the past two hours?”
In retrospect, the bet had not been the best idea. They were all keyed up from the hunt, and Dean off-handedly mentioned that he needed to find someone to get laid, stat. Sam rolled his eyes at him but it was such a token effort that Dean saw right through him. Sam liked to pretend he was above one-night-stands and that he was saving himself for his One True Love or something (that kid, seriously), but really after the thrill of a good hunt, with the adrenaline still buzzing in your veins and the sheer relief of having survived again, there really was nothing like a hard fuck.
“I don’t…” he paused, searching for words. “Dean, I was born a being made of light and wavelengths, with wings and multiple heads and countless libs and eyes,” he tried to explain. “I have seen humans evolve from underwater organisms and I have seen generations live and die. To me, the difference between males and females are so small as to appear… unimportant.”
“I’m… I’m not,” it came out as a strangled sob. “It hurts so bad. Cas. So bad.”
Castiel followed him. Dean had spotted a row of trench coats similar to Jimmy’s, which for some unfathomable reason made Castiel feel warm and melancholic at the same time. There was no tan coat like his previous one, so Castiel settled for a light grey color, and allowed Dean to add a black coat to the cart because he insisted he would ‘look more badass’.
“Yeah, right!” Sam burst out. “Uh, no offense, Cas, but I don’t think Dean should write me off as a lost cause just yet.”
Dean had lived with Heats for ten years by now and had nothing good to say about them. He knew there were moments--that could stretch and last for hours, days even--when he felt like he would die if someone didn’t bend him over and knot him properly. He’d sweat, ache and cry, try to stave off the worst of the pain with a vibrator and his overactive imagination until eventually the feeling receded and he felt like he could breathe again. He knew it was just a matter of waiting. He did. But this time it hit him harder than ever before.
Still, being Omega was awful and Heats were the worst. Oh, he knew that they were supposed to be incredible with a partner, he did. But he refused to put himself at the mercy of someone else so completely. He had occasionally chatted up a rare Alpha woman, but it never seemed to work out and, Omega or not, Dean was not going to get with a dude just because his stupid body told him so. It took him years to even muster the courage to buy a toy for himself--a cheap silicone vibrator with an inflatable knot at the base--and quietly resented how much he liked it. He never touched it outside a Heat.
“I’ll be there in forty minutes.” Dean squeezed two more sad orgasms out of himself waiting for Cas, and when his doorbell rang he scrambled to the door on unsteady legs, feeling like a shit man and an even worse friend. He all but collapsed on Cas right there on the doorstep, heedless of the fact that he was wearing an oversized t-shirt and nothing else or that he was a sweaty, slicky, unappealing mess.
--Cas unzipped his fly and rammed his cock into Dean and Dean’s mind went blissfully blank.
“I… well, I have tried--occasionally--there have been… I guess I didn’t like it that much.” He shrugged sheepishly.
“Yeah, and she looked into it! Then what?”
“You wanna know why I freaked out so much? Christ, you’ve got to think I’m some fucking homophobe, like I care about any of that. I fucking don’t, okay?”
“I believe the right phrase for it,” Castiel interrupted him, “is ‘we will take it one day at a time’.”
“I did not ‘sneak out’,” Castiel replied. “ That would have been rude. I said goodbye to Danny before leaving.” He took off his shoes. “ You also seem to have made a great deal of assumptions about me which are not necessarily true.” It was merely an observation but Dean winced in the darkness of the room.
He decided he liked the colors blue and yellow most of all, which led to his decision to purchase a blue and yellow striped pair of pyjamas, although Dean insisted he didn’t need them. “I am absolutely certain that it is customary for humans to have a separate outfit for sleeping,” Castiel told him firmly, “and I am determined to start my human life the proper way.” He looked forward to sleeping, truth be told. He had seen enough of Dean’s dreams and was extremely curious about what his own mind would concoct. Finally he decided he had all that he needed, when Dean stopped him in his tracks with a gentle hand around his elbow.
The thing was, Dean wasn’t doing this for the sake of his pride only. Cas let him get away with a lot but he was pretty sure his friend wasn't doing this to humor him. Dean knew him and could tell that Cas really wanted to have sex right the fuck now--poor bastard was still getting used to having a human body pumped full of hormones and a dick that acted out like everybody else’s. Dean wasn’t sure how that shit worked back when he was an angel: he remembered Cas getting a boner from pop-up bad pornography, remembered… whatever that was with Meg; further back, he remembered Cas being scared but intrigued when Dean dragged him to a brothel. But he was pretty sure Cas was somehow feeling more and more often now that he was walking the Earth for good. He could see it. And he wanted to help.
“Unless, of course, you tell me to stop. I never want to hurt you.” Cas eased back a little, maybe mistaking Dean’s trembling as something other than pure, unbridled lust.
“I don’t know what that means,” Castiel said.
“Yes, I… I mean. I’ve enjoyed, ah, giving my partners pleasure. I don’t mind it. But they seemed… put off by the fact that I was not very affected. I don’t know. It just seems easier not to do rather than face all the expectations I am simply not able to fulfill.”
“I complimented, like you said I should do. I think you are not very good at the flirting, Dean.”
“Just making sure there’s proof that you got laid. I still got a bet to win.” Dean answered. He got a soft bit of flesh between his teeth and bit, and sucked, and revelled in the way Cas breathed harder, twitching against him.
“Are you all right? I thought you’d taken time off work.”
“Dean,” he hissed, “you’re being an asshole for no reason!”
He headed back inside the bar to find Dean and was surprised to see that the woman Dean had been talking to--flirting with, he supposed--was nowhere in sight. Dean winked at him, congratulated him and told him “I can’t believe you hooked up with that chick, dude--good job,” paid for their drinks and they headed back to the motel. Dean seemed sincerely happy for him, but there was also a peculiar expression on his face that Castiel couldn’t quite understand.
He was incredibly wary of male Alphas. Most of them seemed to think they had a say in what he did, that they had to guide him--even those who didn’t want to knot him themselves were all too happy to tell him that he needed to find a nice mate, that it was not right for an Omega to be alone and defenseless and blah blah blah. Dicks. Like all rules in life, though, this one had an exception, and in this instance the exception was named Castiel Novak.
Dean gives up and turns to look at Cas. “Help me.”
“Cas,” he said, and it was a prayer and a confession all at once.
“You have not offended me,” Castiel reassured him. “In fact, I suppose it is… comforting that you can relate to my Daddy Issues.”
“You know what, Cas? You are absolutely right.”
“You can stick your prowess where the sun doesn’t shine! You don’t just come out and say something like that and expect everything to be peachy! What was I supposed to say, huh?”
A couple of months later they were joined in Idaho by another hunter, Annie Hawkins, to assist her with a troublesome nest of vampires. Annie took a shine to Castiel and they engaged in sexual intercourse, which was pleasant and a bit rougher than what he had experienced before. Both Winchesters were in equal parts amused and embarrassed by this, as it came out than they’d each had sex with Annie, too (on separate occasions). Dean seemed to fixate on the fact that Castiel had had sex with a woman again, which Castiel did not understand the significance of. He had been aware that Dean places sexual activities in high regard and thought about them a lot, but he had not realized the extent of his fixation on the genders of the people involved. He finally told Sam as such, one day when Dean was out getting groceries. Sam pressed his lips into a thin line.
“Th- wha-...” he blustered, a droplet of beer trailing down his bottom lip and landing on his chin. Smooth, Dean.
“Nope. All good, buddy,” Dean said, still not looking at him. Sam elbowed his brother in the ribs.
“What helps, Cas?”
“It is the truth. In case you had any doubts.”
He let out an absurdly loud moan when Cas’s tongue joined his fingers, laving at the reddened skin, lapping up his slick. Dean writhed on the mattress, absolutely out of his goddamn mind with lust. Was this what it was like to have an Alpha with you during the Heat? It was mind-blowingly good but also terrifying. Cas could have taken out a knife right now and carved his initials on Dean’s ribcage and Dean would have thanked him. He babbled incoherently, hips stuttering up to press himself even closer onto Cas’s face, and Cas’s free hand wrapped around Dean’s cock.
Cas had taken over the plot of land next to Singer Salvage when the cranky old owner, Cain, had kicked the bucket. He was a quiet guy, tended to his bees and sold little jars of honey at the farmer’s market. He was an Alpha, could be demanding and abrasive on occasion but he was also kind and funny in his own weird way and Dean, despite himself, quickly grew to consider him a friend. They’d drink beer together on Cas’s porch and watch bad television, and not once did Cas make an unwanted advance towards him. When asked about it, he confessed shyly that he didn’t think he was suited for the mated life, he had always been single and liked it that way.
“Why, Sammy,” said Dean, “worried Cas’ ll ruin the market for you?”
“I… Christ, Cas!” He choked. “What the hell?”
“Okay, sorry Oprah,” for a moment Dean looked as if he was getting genuinely angry, then he let out a sigh and his shoulders relaxed. “Yeah, no, I’m sorry, Cas. You haven’t done anything. I just didn’t expect you were gonna hook up with a dude, it’s all. It’s a little unexpected. But hey, more power to you!” He was looking at Castiel now, which was an improvement, but there was still something in his gaze that Castiel couldn’t decipher.
“Sexual intercourse,” the former angel clarified. He shifted in his seat. “I find myself very… unsettled.”
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. “Just… don’t talk about souls and supernatural shit, okay? It just sounds fake and douchey.”
He is fucked.
“Cas… m’sorry,” Dean mumbled, mouth full of toothpaste. He spat in the sink, rinsed his mouth and, to Cas’s shock, he sank down to the floor on his knees, right in front of the toilet, where Cas was sitting on the lid.
As it turned out, there were still a lot more things to acquire so that he could go about his human life. Personal hygiene products, for example--a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap and shampoo, deodorant, shaving cream, razors, aftershave. Dean asked him which scents he preferred and he, after a careful round of sniffing all samples the store had to offer, ended up choosing all the same brands Dean favored because, as he told his friend, he was the best smelling human he had ever met. Dean went red again in the middle of the store and coughed a lot. Apparently, it was another of those things you were not supposed to tell your friends, although Castiel couldn’t fathom why. He still chose the same products as Dean, though, because he truly liked them best.
“What.”
For the first time in years of friendship, he allowed himself to bury his face in Cas’s neck, inhaling deeply at his scent gland and yes yes yes, it was perfect, delicious, enticing and calming all at once.
“I don’t know, Dean! I did what you said, I introduced myself and asked if I could by her a drink”
“Okay, let’s start again. One thing at a time.” Dean patted him briefly on the back, ceasing bickering with his brother. “Let’s just… start from the bottom and work our way up, all right? First of all, you need shoes and socks.”
He opens his eyes.
And then, obviously, is when the lights come on and Sam grunts: “Guys, what the fuck is going oOOOH!” And Dean is kneeling on the floor with an inch of cock in his mouth like the world’s strangest lollipop.
Documentation was also in order, which meant photographs, and Castiel endured a long session in the photo booth so those could be acquired. Documentations--and money--required a place to put it all, so he bought a wallet, and the wallet had a small transparent pocket meant to hold pictures, so he selected a few discarded shots from the photo booth afternoon, the ones where Sam and Dean had joined him in the booth to joke around and tease him. There was one particular photo where he looked particularly aggravated, stuck in the middle of the two brothers as Dean ruffled his hair and Sam planted a teasing kiss on his cheek. This photograph made him smile the most, so he put that one in his wallet. There was also a shot featuring only Dean, grinning broadly, and Castiel kept that one too.
“Is something funny, Dean?” Cas honest to god growled, and the look in his eyes screamed bloody murder. It would have been even funnier if it wasn’t also--okay--pretty arousing. Dean reached down to where Cas’s hand was still wrestling with his belt buckle, covered it with his own.
“What? Of course, Cas, we’ll split it.” Dean mumbled against the curve of his neck.
Dean grinned wide around the neck of his beer bottle. This was too good for words. A chance to introduce his best friend to the world of earthly pleasures and Sam’s oft restrained inner caveman coming out to play? Gold. “Wanna bet?”
“I am not a child,” Castiel repeated, “but I do appreciate that you want to protect me. Your friendship and your guidance mean a great deal to me, Dean.” He finished buttoning his pyjama shirt and reached out to squeeze Dean’s shoulder. He felt Dean sigh and lean into his touch a bit. Then he said “Dude, I hope you washed those hands.”
“I told her that, though I could not see it, I thought she must have a beautiful soul.”
Despite the importance that Dean seemed to have placed on it, Castiel’s sex life was not very active and therefore it did not impact their shared life very much. After his encounter with Danny the bartender, Dean was uneasy around him for a while, then he got over it, as Dean was wont to do, and life resumed as normal. Sam talked to Castiel about it, apologised for his brother’s lack of tact, making oblique references to Dean ‘having his own issues to deal with’ (Castiel had no idea what those issues where), and assured him that he had Sam’s full support and Sam was available in case Castiel needed someone to talk to. Although Castiel didn’t quite understand the need for such concern, he was touched by Sam’s efforts and reassured him that he would come to him for emotional support if the need arose, which Sam found funny and decided to buy Castiel a beer.
Danny walked him to the door and left Castiel his number, which Castiel did put into his cell phone like he had done with Kelly’s, although it was aware that it was unlikely he would ever see either of these people again. Perhaps it was a human thing, having spent a nice time with someone, feeling residual affection and wanting to hold on to the illusion that the person you’d connected would stay in your life. Humans.
Whenever Castiel had thought about what it meant to be human, he had usually thought about the big, important matters. Free will. Life and death. Love. Fragility. Although he knew about it, he had never properly envisioned the endless trivialities that filled up a human’s days. Nor had he anticipated how many things he would end up needing. Clothing, for example. And it was not only down to quantity, but also choosing what to wear seemed to be a much more complicated process that he had anticipated.
“Fuck’s sake. Yeah, that would do it. Word of advice? Lay off the cheese next time.”
“Come ON, man!” Dean exclaimed. “Pick something with a little more personality, would you? It won’t kill you.”
“Really? I’m glad,” he said earnestly and son of a bitch, it was so fucking endearing that Dean felt the sudden and completely unjustifiable urge to kiss him.
He cleared his throat. “Cas,” he started, but Cas was staring at him again, like he had done every single godforsaken day since they met, yet this time it made Dean’s words dry out in his mouth. Fffuck. “Cas,” he tried again, “you know I… I mean, I don’t know how much, uh, experience you got already but um, the important thing is that if I make you uncomfortable or whatev--”
“Dean!”
Dean did not finish that sentence. Suddenly his back was pressed against the Impala’s door, he had a lapful of former Angel of the Lord and he was being kissed within an inch of his life.
“You can't be serious,” Dean said, but Castiel for once held his ground. “You told me to pick something with more personality, Dean,” he pointed out, “as I understand it, bright colors and decorative designs showcase personality. And I like these socks; they look cheerful.”
“Ah, Daddy Issues.” Castiel nodded, remembering Danny the bartender. Sam chuckled.
“I don’t. Now sit your ass down.” Cas obeys, and Dean stumbles--okay, half-falls--to the floor, and nudges Cas’s leg open to settle between them. Cas’s eyes are wide and he’s looking at Dean like he’s the best fucking thing in the whole world, like it’s a piece of art or something, and Dean ducks his head under his gaze and busies himself with the belt buckle, with the zipper, with Cas’s boxers because he’s still feeling raw and exposed and if they soulfully gaze into each other’s eyes another second he’s gonna spontanously combust. He briefly loses his nerve when Cas’s cock bobs free because--Jesus, he’s huge--and Dean’s never done it before--but Cas gently runs his hands through Dean’s hair and he feels calm all of a sudden--near invincible.
“The other three weren’t enough?” Dean asks, but he’s smirking and walking off with an arm around Jack’s shoulders.
Dean’s eyebrows go up before he laughs and shakes his head. “Listen, don’t listen to guys like that, they’re just idiots. Anybody can bake, or cook or whatever, it’s not related to being a girl or a boy or whatever.”
“But Dean,” Jack asks, “I don’t want to make tea, I want to make a pie. Preferably apple pie.”
His gaze drifts to his fingers, to the glossy polish coating his nails, his mind flitting back to a host of things he’s enjoyed despite knowing he shouldn’t, despite feeling less of a man for it. Then he stares at Jack, face screwed up in determination, but still so happy, so energetic and free of shame or self consciousness and he has to smile. That’s freedom, that’s bravery. His little half angel kid that isn’t even sure if he’s a boy or something outside of Dean's comprehension is more of a man than Dean is most days.
“Are these… All nail polishes?” Jack asks, jaw dropped in awe.
” comes a voice from somewhere above him.
He couldn't quite believe this was happening, he had been so sure that this time the angel had been gone for good, but somehow he had managed to pull off one last miracle.
like him?” Sam smirked, as Dean got into the back seat and laid Cas’ head gently in his lap.
Sam’s got a face on as Dean settles down on the bench with his full tray, and Dean stupidly asks him what’s wrong. When Sam brings up Cas, Dean’s almost angry; he came here as a way of distraction, not to talk about the feelings he’s been pointedly ignoring for the last fortnight – and why was Sam doing this in public? Dean may act as though he’s fine when Sam brings Cas up but there’s no way his brother doesn’t notice how quickly he disappears to his room after those painful and short conversations.
accepted him for who he truly was.
They struggle for a minute and Dean finds himself wishing he had waited for Sam.
Cas looked puzzled for a minute but shook it off, "It is good to see you, Dean." he smiled, touching his friend's shoulder. Dean just shrugged off Cas' hand and started up the Impala. Cas looked at Dean sadly but said nothing. It did occur to Dean that maybe Castiel didn't actually understand why he was mad at him, but Cas was just gonna have to deal with it, 'cause he was the cause of it.
Cas brings his hand up to rest against Dean’s neck as he slowly leans in, pressing his lips gently against Dean’s. The kiss is soft and sweet, so different to their first all those weeks ago, but every time they kiss Dean feels the same electricity he had the first time – the same sensation that this is just
with Jack and the other angels all this time?” Dean regrets these words as soon as they tumble clumsily from his mouth; anger and insecurity hadn’t been the feelings he had wanted to express to Cas, but he just couldn’t seem to form the words he actually wanted to say.
’ with your death – I have never coped fine! Ask Sam, ask Jack, ask
When it comes to a stop he hears several gasps from around the circle. He opens his eyes slowly, dreading who it could have landed on and his heart stops. After a few seconds of silence with everyone staring at the bottle or him, Dean decides he should probably say something.
“And The Empty ejected me,” Cas nodded. Dean's heart pounded in his chest as panic and guilt spread through him,
Dean pressed his palms against his eyes and shook his head, unable to form any more words as sobs wracked his body.
“Anyway, Cas is waiting outside. I think you guys should talk,” somehow, Sam’s words make it through Dean’s cloud of panicked thoughts. Seeing the look of alarm on his face, Sam continues. “I’ve already talked to him, Dean. He’s calmed down since the hunt, he was just worried about you.”
“Well?” Dean asked impatiently, jumping up from where he had been sitting on the floor.
The old lady behind the counter smiled at Castiel (yep, definitely real) sympathetically, "Loss of a loved one is hard on everyone," She replied sadly, misunderstanding the angel's strange comment, "I'm afraid I don't know this bunker, my love, but if you need to-"
“You know I did,” he said seriously, looking Dean right in the eye.
Another wave of intense pain hit him and he clenched his fists, trying his best to contain the screams threatening to burst out of him. In a brief painless moment, while The Empty taunted him more about Dean’s inevitable death, Cas looked at the item he had collided with.
. Ask them what I’m like when you’re gone. I’m a goddamn wreck, man, I can barely function! And every time I lose you it only gets harder. And this time – after what you said before –
it’s hard to admit what you’re feeling, but you
“Oh really?” he smirks, turning to face Cas and letting his hand slip down to rest at the angel’s waist.
He still hasn’t told Sam what happened, how Cas had–
– and if Dean wasn’t currently dying he’d probably be more than a little turned on.
Dean was heading out one day - Wednesday? - to get some supplies when he opened his bedroom door to find Kevin Tran, Prophet of the Lord, standing right in his way.

Dean suddenly feels very sick.
“Don’t be stupid.”
“That was real?”
Then Cas turns to him.
Dean's anger built up more and more as he drove back to the bunker in silence, and by the time he had gotten inside and led Castiel to the room he had made up for him he was almost at bursting point. When Cas was in the room with him he shut the door quietly so as not to disturb Sam or Kevin, whatever the hell they were doing.
And with that, at last, Cas pressed his lips to Dean’s, and Dean didn’t feel scared any more.
"No." said Dean quickly. "I'm pretty busy with... uh, research actually so, if you don't mind-" he tried to shut the door but Kevin blocked it with his foot.

“You cut out your grace?” Dean finished, his mouth agape in abject horror as his eyes fixed on the small cut on Cas' neck and he finally put two and two together.

“Angels… They don’t feel things like humans,” Dean stated, trying to keep his voice even. “So, what did he actually
no big loss; that there had ever been a time when Dean had been without Cas and had ‘coped fine’.
Cas shuffles awkwardly. “I thought after what I told you, you would need some space. I thought you might not want me around anymore.”
Dean just stares blankly at him, it’s obvious he has come out to cause trouble and Dean doesn’t want to give him any more reasons to make fun of him than he already has.
Gabriel spins immediately and the bottle comes to a stop on Cas, which, Jo reminds him gleefully, means he has to kiss Sam. Gabriel, Dean thinks, seems a little bit too happy with the result of his spin and Dean wonders for a second if Gabe had used his powers to rig it… before he comes to his senses,
Cas’s head whips up, his mouth slightly agape, wide, hopeful eyes fixed on Dean. “You
“Sort what out?” Dean replied, trying to act innocent.
As he begs Sam to stay with him – so sure this is it for him,
"Kevin! I

“It’s definitely Cas,” Sam told him. “And he’s doing okay... but I think you’d better go talk to him, Dean.”
“Why didn’t you come back, then?” Dean begins, trying to keep his voice even, despite the hurt he’s feeling. “I’ve been a mess without you, Cas. I thought you were gone forever - that I’d never see you again! And now I find out you’ve been up in Heaven just
how you reacted to him being gone, and the words he said to you before. Don’t pretend like they weren’t said, just because you’re scared,” Dean opened his mouth to protest but Sam just kept talking. “I
He feels as if he’s been waiting his entire life for this one moment and he never wants it to end but, while the angel may not require such things, Dean has to pull back to let out a shaky breath.
The case he’s finally allowed to accompany Sam on is a demon hunt. The brothers track them to an abandoned farm and easily ambush them inside the house, it seems as though the arrogant demons had not even seen them coming. There are only two there and he and Sam each take one on. While Sam fights with the female, Dean lunges for the male but he makes his escape out the door.
he would – but that didn’t make it any less scary. Teary-eyed, he looked at Sam and nodded.
“What do you want me to say?” Dean answers quickly, avoiding eye contact, knowing he’s seconds away from tears. “This isn’t the first time we’ve lost him. You
to know that I will always support you? That I always
“Um,” Dean begins awkwardly, all of a sudden feeling extremely uncomfortable, “Well, I do… Y’know. Feel that way for you as well.”
Somehow, he had managed to
Cas changed into the clothes Dean had left for him and lay down on the bed. He had not told Dean that the whole time he was without him he too was worrying that he would never see the other man again, and he had not told him that the reason he could not sleep was because he was knew what was out there, looking for him, and he did not know how to protect himself in this strange new skin, because Dean did not need to know this. He just needed to know that Cas was here for him if he needed him once more.
If Kevin was trying to comfort him, Dean thought he had a funny way of going about it, "Kevin, I don't wanna talk about this."
Cas begins talking as soon as Gabriel is gone, “I hope this will not affect our friendship, Dean. Gabriel has been attempting to persuade me to tell you of my true feelings for some time now, but as I am only just beginning to understand these kind of emotions I wasn’t really sure how I should proceed. I think that is probably the reason Gabriel insisted I joined everyone for this game this evening… He seems to be under the mistaken impression that you return my affections…” Cas shrugs slightly, clearly at a loss for what to say, just waiting for Dean to reject him.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas croaked, as he shut the door gently, and Dean got the impression he was being thanked for more than just leaving Cas to sleep.
Sam looks heartbroken, and the small spark of hope Dean had been feeling immediately dies.
"You can't be serious," Dean whines as Jo pushes him into Bobby's living room where his friends are all waiting, "I'm an adult, there’s
“What are you talking about, Dean?” Cas asks, his eyes narrowing slightly.
Kevin stepped back a little and looked at Dean sadly, "C'mon Dean, I know you feel like you have to be strong or something but it's okay to show us you're worried about Castiel. Wouldn't you feel better if you told me or Sam how you're feeling? You don't have to pretend like it's not a big deal; I know how close you and Castiel are."
you. I needed you and you weren’t here,” his voice breaks on the last word and he swallows heavily, willing himself not to cry.
"Whatever. If I'm needed I'll be in my room, okay?" He mumbled, grabbing his book off his table and stomping out the kitchen.

It was no less overwhelming the second time Cas said it. Dean felt his heartbeat speed up and his palms grow sweaty –

“I’ll see you day after tomorrow,” he told Dean quietly, before raising his voice to shout a goodbye to Cas.
the hospital. Three weeks and one day, to be precise, and there was still no sign of Castiel.
Dean is struggling to breathe as the angel’s hand slides down his side to the rapidly growing dark spot on his t-shirt. A warm glow emits from Cas’ hand and Dean can feel his body stitching itself back together. Dean frowns as he glances down to where the hand is pressed to his side. This was new; his hallucinations had never actually

“Don’t pull that shit with me, Dean,” Sam growled, eyes flicking briefly back to Cas to check the other man hadn’t heard him. “I saw how you were after Cas died,” Sam muttered, and Dean felt a jolt of pain go through his heart at Sam’s words – even though Cas was back, it still hurt Dean to think about the time they had spent apart. Sam raised an eyebrow at him, clearly noticing the change in Dean’s demeanour. “There you go,” he said matter-of-factly. “I

“Oh, I already thought of that,” Jo announces proudly “As there are two sets of brothers, I thought if one of you guys gets your brother you can just trade! Let’s say if Gabriel gets Cas he kisses Sam and if Dean gets Sam he kisses Castiel, etcetera etcetera!” Gabriel looks smug and Cas still obviously has no idea what’s going on, though his eyes widen even more when kissing is mentioned. Both Sam and Dean are about to argue with her but she doesn’t wait for a reply, “So, who wants to go first?”
Dean felt a wave of different emotions wash over him; shock, happiness, relief - and something else he couldn't quite put his finger on - then anger.
"Yes. What you said the other day, about me, Sam and Castiel being your family...? Dean, I know how you're feeling. I've lost my family, remember? You say you're fine but with Castiel missing - and it's not like before when he was missing, he's mortal now - I know you're worried Dean. You're trying to cover it up but I can see it, Sam can too."
It had been over three weeks since the

“But what about me, Cas?” Dean whispers, glancing up at Cas through his lashes. “I
And it’s the most wonderful feeling Dean has ever experienced, his heart is racing, his head is spinning, but it feels fantastic and he doesn't ever want it to end! But already -
“No.” Cas mutters, a pained expression on his face, “You don’t understand Dean. I didn’t want to kiss you in front of all of them. I thought I could, but it felt… wrong.”
. “I am sorry, Dean; I didn’t think it through. I was just trying to get back to you all – to help – but now I realise what little help I’ll be. Even now Chuck's gone - even just as a hunter - if I wasn’t of use to you with my significantly reduced powers, what good will I be to you as a human?”
and the wound
“Dean,” Cas began eventually. “I know I’ve not been of much use to you recently, since I lost most of my powers–”
When they got back to the bunker, Dean helped Cas to his room and left Sam to do the normal tests, and take a look over him with some of Rowena’s spells. Dean waited in the corridor outside, pacing to start with but after a while he sank to the floor, leaning his head back against the wall.
“Don’t dodge my question with all your cryptic shit,” Dean snapped, but there was no real heat behind it. “Just tell me if you meant what I thought you meant.”
"Well it sounded like that went well," Sam said when Kevin stalked angrily into the kitchen, "I told you not to bother. He'll never admit to being worried about Cas, that's just what he's like. The only thing we can do to help is reassure him Cas'll be fine. Which he will... Er, I hope." Sam didn't sound as sure as he seemed to want to put across, but Kevin had had enough of the brothers' amazing ability to deny things which were plainly obvious to everyone else for one day.
Dean laughs a little at that and puts his hand on Cas’ shoulder in a way that he hopes comes across as comforting.
Dean shuts his eyes, unable to bear the pitying look on his brother’s face and unwilling to let him see the tears threatening to fall.
In the kitchen he found Sam, on a video call to Eileen, which he promptly ended once he looked up and saw the state Dean was in.
With all the strength he could muster he cut into his throat and let his grace drain from him.

“Was it Cas?” Dean interrupts, not interested in hearing whatever rubbish his subconscious seemed to think was a good dying speech.

“It is,” he stated, placing his hands on his knees under the table, so Cas wouldn't be able to see how much they were shaking. “I need to know – did you mean it? Did you mean it how I
Perhaps Dean should have expected that to be the answer – Cas had, after all, said that Dean’s love was '
Sam exited Cas’ room about thirty minutes later, a worried look on his face.
It’s not too long before they go back to hunting; Sam is more eager than ever, but Dean’s heart isn’t in it anymore. He feels old – much older than he is – and
From the place where he stood, invisible, in the corner of the room, Jack smiled. He had promised not to meddle in human affairs, and he had kept his word, but he had needed to see this through to the end. Just to make sure that these two people he cared about so much got the happiness they deserved. Now that Cas was human, he and Dean would be able to grow old together, and when they died both their souls would be able to ascend to Jack’s new Heaven, where they could all be together as a family, once again.
Somehow they manage to find a case – it’s like trouble just follows them wherever they go. Before now, Dean had assumed that it was just Chuck writing in these coincidental cases, but maybe the Winchesters were actually just that unlucky.
talk about this, Sammy. I just can’t.”
“No,” it screeched. “We had a deal!” It dived towards Cas, sending an intense wave of pain through the angel as it did, but it wasn’t enough to stop him.
Cas knew it would take days, even weeks, for Dean to fully forgive him instead of just shrugging off his apologies with a joke or a smile, but it was no more than he deserved and he was willing to do anything to regain Dean's trust and prove to him that he was not going to leave him again. As Dean lay down next to him, wearing a faded AC/DC t-shirt and a sleepy smile, Cas felt safe for the first time since the fall.
Finally
"...An old abandoned bunker." Cas was saying in his deep, raspy voice,"Do you know it? I know the route I would take if I were to fly there, but unfortunately that is not an option anymore, and it seems to be a lot more difficult by foot... To be honest, everything seems to be a lot more difficult since I lost my Grace." Dean blinked a few times to check what he was seeing was actually real (he'd already had more than one experience of thinking he'd seen Cas when he wasn't really there, or mistaking someone else for the fallen angel).
For days, Dean had been acting weirdly around Castiel; unable to find the courage to mention the words spoken before The Empty had claimed him, waiting for the other man to bring it up first, but knowing he would not. Why would he, when he believed his feelings to be unrequited?
“Cas?” Dean gasps as he stares over the werewolf’s shoulder at the figure standing over them.
That isn’t the problem. Dean likes Benny and, if he’s being honest with himself, he isn’t completely averse to the idea of kissing him, but he is averse to the idea of kissing Benny in front of
It’s a couple of weeks before Sam lets Dean accompany him on a hunt again, despite Dean’s protests that he’s
It’s been three days since their last hunt and Dean is desperate for a distraction, so when he sees the ad for the pie festival he thinks
It’s a pretty typical case for them; small town near a large forest, bodies turning up mauled with their hearts missing, no witnesses. The local sheriff suspects a large wolf or a bear roaming the woods. The brothers had been following up separate leads, but both point to the same conclusion; a family of werewolves living in a small cabin on the outskirts of the forest. They arrange to meet near the cabin and plan their attack.
"Cas?" Dean interrupted, finally finding his voice. He had intended to sound his usual confident self but the name had come out as more of a broken whisper.
Billie’s scythe. Suddenly, Cas had an idea. A stupid, crazy idea, but what did he have left to lose? Surely he was dead either way? Picking the scythe up, he turned to face The Empty.
Dean shuffles closer to his angel, licking his lips slightly, “Gabriel lied ‘cause he and Jo wanted to play this ridiculous game, Cas.”
have said to you that I haven’t… I’m sorry, Cas. For making it seem like I didn’t care, for all the shit I’ve put you through that you’ve forgiven without question. You’re so selfless, I don’t deserve you.”
Cas’ eyes glisten with tears of happiness as he moves in to recapture Dean’s lips.
it’s so much harder for him to speak about it this time. Or perhaps it’s the fact that there is something different about it now, something that makes Dean feel as though there’s no way he can get Cas back. It feels
The Empty threw Cas across the endless stretch of nothingness and Cas collided with something solid.
In the days that followed, Sam pottered around the bunker attempting to restore some of its power with spells from the books Rowena had left him. He managed to get the monster radar and alarm system back online and was pretty pleased with himself for that.
Late on Thursday afternoon Dean decided he would brave the angel-infested outside and grab some supplies from the shop in a nearby town. He snuck out of his room, making sure he didn't run into Kevin or Sam, 'cause he just knew they'd just be annoying and sympathetic, despite the fact that Dean was
Dean glares at him before glancing around the circle,
Straight ahead of them, framed by the setting sun, was a large barn.
Dean smiles. He’s come for him – his angel.
“Dean,” Cas whispered, his hand coming up to cup the back of Dean’s neck gently, tears of happiness glistening in his eyes. “I’ve never wanted anything more in my life.”
"Can I come in?" Kevin asked quickly, before Dean could tell him to go away.

“Whats going on?” Dean questions, thoroughly confused by the strange interaction between the two brothers.
responding
Castiel looked at Dean like he'd just said something completely absurd. "I've been trying to find you, Dean." he replied, as if it was obvious, "I thought it would be simple, but I have found being without my Grace... increasingly difficult. Before it was so easy to locate you, but now... I don't really understand maps, Dean." Cas said seriously, frowning at him.
“It woulda been funny, if it wasn’t so heartbreakingly pathetic,” Sam says with a small smile and Dean shoots him a glare over his pillow. “A real chick flick moment – apart from Cas didn’t catch you.”
“What the hell is this?” Dean growled, angry, but not sure at whom.
, to the angel.
He hears a noise in the distance and his eyes flick up to somewhere above Sam’s shoulder where a dark-haired figure approaches.
A tear runs down Dean’s cheek as he reaches forward to grip at the sleeve of Cas’ trench coat lightly. “Please, Cas, don’t leave me again. I need you… I love you.”

On the 24
“Why are we even playing a game?” Cas asks, “Gabriel said it was a life or death situation and I needed to come at once! Shouldn’t we be trying to sort that out, whatever it is? It sounds pretty important.” He frowns at Dean.
It was only then Dean admitted to himself just how worried he had been; he had never expected to see Castiel again.
Cas said nothing, only held Dean close again and let him calm himself down, and when Dean regained his composure and pulled away from him, Cas told him quietly "I'm sorry, I did not know."
“You think this is funny?” Cas snarls, as he unceremoniously pulls the knife from Dean’s side and lets it drop to the ground with a loud clang. “I gave my

“That won’t kill me,” The Empty cackled, flicking its finger and sending a jolt of pain up Cas’ spine.
barn, Sammy!” He turned on the spot and fixed Sam with a look that made his heart break a little, before falling to his knees.
A voice inside his head screams
Of all the people it could have landed on, it lands on Cas?! He’s 99.9% sure Gabe had something to do with this; he’d probably rigged the whole game to be honest.
“Dammit!” Charlie cries, but she doesn’t complain any more than that, as she leans in to give Gabe a quick peck on the lips. She pulls a face as she backs away but Gabe just laughs and reaches for the bottle.
“Dean,” Cas murmured, and he was so close Dean could feel Cas' breath against his lips.
” he growls, trying to come across as angry as possible as he knocks the bottle aside with his hand. “You can’t be serious! First Benny, now
Dean groans loudly, “Come on guys, I didn’t wanna play this game in the first place! I’ve kissed Benny, can’t you just let it go?” He pleads with Jo and Gabriel, who he can already tell will not be giving in.
"Yeah... Well, just don't do it again." Dean joked, but Cas could tell it was more of an attempt to clear the air than actual acceptance of his apology. Dean sat down on the bed and awkwardly fiddled with the sleeve of his shirt, the comfortable silence the two used to share was different somehow and after a few minutes Dean cleared his throat and got back up, "It's, er, getting pretty late," he muttered, "think I'm gonna hit the hay, Cas. This is your room by the way..."
Cas is very still for a moment, his eyes wide as he just stares at Dean, speechless, before the penny finally drops and he surges forward to close the gap between them.
, Dean thinks, a warm feeling erupting in his chest as he gazes at the beautiful man before him.
It’s been years since Dean’s seen his angel look so angry – so
“Yeah,” Sam said, helping Dean back up. “This is definitely not normal.”
Cas released him but did not move away, just gazed intensely into his eyes, "I know, Dean." he replied quietly.
Dean groaned, reaching for the bottle of painkillers sitting on the kitchen counter as the alarm finally stopped and Sam rounded the corner.
Dean Winchester had never expected to make it to thirty, let alone forty-one, but somehow, against all odds, he was still here. Somehow, against all odds, he and his brother had saved the world again. Defeated Chuck – literally
“It’s been a long time since Cas was like the rest of the angels, Dean,” Sam said patiently, placing his beer down on the table and looking at Dean seriously. “I’m pretty sure he meant exactly what you think he did.”

"Yeah well you're gonna have to start understanding them 'cause us mortals can't just pop around the place like Harry freakin' Potter" Dean snapped.
Castiel turned towards the direction of the voice "Dean," he said calmly, smiling widely at the younger man, "I was just looking for you."
Dean can make out a look of concern on the other man’s face as he draws closer. He fights to stay conscious but can feel the darkness closing in around him as his eyelids grow heavy. The last thing he sees before his vision blacks out and his head lolls forwards are Castiel’s bright blue eyes staring down at him.
“It was obvious,” Sam replied simply, a sad smile gracing his features, before adding. “You mean to say, you didn’t?”
Dean one last time.
. He’s lost too much.
“Forty-two,” Dean sighs, sitting up in bed and taking the warm cup out of Cas’ hands with a chuckle. “Never thought I’d live to see the day.”
“You need to sort this out while I’m gone,” his brother told him quietly, gesturing to where Cas sat across the room, reading one of Rowena’s old books on astral projection.

It is at this point that Dean snaps. “I’m not ‘
“Meet you by the car in ten,” he said.
“It’s definitely him, right?” Sam asked, as Dean placed Cas in the back seat before throwing Sam his keys.
– Dean can’t even bring himself to
It makes sense, of course. Why would he be in a hospital if Cas had been able to heal him?
“Happy birthday, Dean,” Cas smiles as he reclaims his place next to Dean on the bed.
For a second he thinks he sees Cas out of the corner of his eye, but when he turns to look, there’s nothing but thick forest. He shakes his head as he hypes himself up for the fight.
Pushing the demon away, Dean falls to his knees, gasping for breath, wide-eyed as he stares at the knife protruding from his body.
“Did you not check on me?” Dean interrupts suddenly, insecurity rearing its head again as he moves off the bed to stare out of the motel room’s window.
Dean wasn’t sure if Sam was talking about Cas specifically, or if he meant on a wider scale, but he was too overwhelmed to say anything in reply. Overwhelmed with love for his baby brother, overwhelmed that someone he cared about
Dean’s heart is hammering in his chest and his hands are shaking as he grips at Cas’ trench coat, pulling him closer. The kiss is clumsy but, Dean thinks, it couldn’t be more perfect.
Cas makes no effort to move any closer to Dean, so Dean edges forward until their bodies are almost touching.
He hears Cas’ voice in his head as he nears the door.
“Dean,” Cas said, and he sounded much better than he had when he had last spoken on the drive back to the bunker.
“You- you
Dean struggled for a second before he relaxed into Castiel's grip and slowly let the anger go. It was replaced instead by a wave of sadness he he been holding in for the past weeks. "You can't even understand what I've been going through." Dean mumbled into Cas' shoulder, "I thought... Cas, I thought-"
Dean glares at no one in particular and mumbles “This game is so stupid.”
A couple of hours into the drive, just about when Dean had started to get really worried about Cas not waking up yet, the other man began to stir.
“Thank you, Sammy,” he said shakily as his brother pulled him into a hug. “I’ll do it, I’ll make this right.”
you might have meant, I understand that you don’t feel that now.”
, Cas! How could you expect me to just move on from that?”
Dean awakes to the slow, rhythmic beep of machines and a strong smell only associated with hospitals. He’s in a small, private room, and outside the window, the sky is dark. Sam is hunched over, asleep in an uncomfortable-looking plastic chair next to his bed.
," he continued as if nothing had happened. "If it’s that big, you’ll need help and it’s probably time for me to get back to what I do best. Killing things.”
“You think that because I have regained my grace fully, I am no longer in love with you?” he asks carefully, confusion evident on his face.
“Don’t talk,” Dean said, concern lacing his voice. “It looks like you mighta been injured. We’ll be back at the bunker soon enough and Sam’ll have a look at you.”
Dean was ripped from his slumber by an alarm blaring throughout the bunker, Cas’ words still playing in his mind. Dean stretched as he stood up from the kitchen chair he had accidentally fallen asleep in; that dream had been the closest he had found to peace since Cas had been taken from him, yet even in the dream he had not been able to shake the sense of loss and regret.
“I didn’t want to take part in that game, Dean.” Cas states as Dean approaches him.
Dean awakes on his bed, in his and Sam’s motel room. It’s dark outside but there is a dim light radiating from the bed next to him where Sam sits watching a TV show on his laptop. He glances over to Dean when the other man sits up, running a hand through his hair.
- Cas is pushing him away and Dean looks at him with hurt in his eyes, wondering if he did something wrong, and Cas shrugs apologetically before standing up and quickly walking out the room.
“Err, well, yeah… I, erm, I do. I guess.”
“I am so going to kill him.” Castiel tells Dean as he moves to stand next to him.
“Er, well. Cas turned up,” Sam starts and Dean’s eyes widen in shock, his heartbeat speeding up.
This was where he belonged. Dean was his family. He was finally home, and sleep had never come so easily.
The demon walks slowly back towards him, a sick smile on her face as Dean resigns himself to the thought that he will die here, alone save for a few demons, his brother not even knowing he’s in trouble.
Cas looked up from his book and waved as Sam exited the bunker, a bright smile on the former angel’s face, and Dean’s heart skipped a beat.
Sam looked down at Dean, sprawled on the floor, whisky bottle still in hand. He had sat on the floor most of the night with Dean as he cried, and drank, and cried some more; he had held his brother as he sobbed into Sam’s shoulder, soaking his shirt through with tears. They weren’t usually huggers, but Dean wasn’t usually a crier either – a lot had changed over the last few days.
“It’s not really fair,” Charlie is saying to her, “there’re
“So,” Gabriel begins, and Dean can already tell he’s going to say something incredible annoying, rude and/or horrible. “What are you guys doing? You’ve been out here a while, I thought you'd decided to make out some more!” he laughs, but when Cas just glowers at him and Dean remains completely silent a strange look crosses Gabriel’s face and he turns to fully face Cas. “What the hell Castiel? You can’t be serious. I have to do something about this!” Dean has no idea what the angel is on about but it’s pretty clear that Cas knows exactly what Gabe is suggesting.
Well, almost all of them.
of fun, Dean-o!”
Dean could have cried at how nonchalant Castiel sounded about the situation, like it hadn't been nearly a month since the last time they had spoken, since Cas had been left helplessly human in a world full of angels who wanted his head.
He had been out a few times, on a couple of low key cases while Kevin and Sam continued to research Knights of Hell (
could
“Why are you being so
Dean is shocked to say the least, and it seems like he’s not the only one.
In a flash, The Empty was on Cas – and Billie – devouring them in a flurry of darkness, and Dean was left alone, in the silence of the bunker, with nothing left of his best friend but a bloody handprint on his jacket.
“Stop stalling and get on with it, you guys!” Gabriel shouts, slinging his arm around a giggling Jo’s shoulder.
He rushed towards the lifeless body immediately, ignoring Sam’s shouts for him to wait. Collapsing on the floor next to Cas, Dean cradled the other man in his arms. He looked unharmed apart from some dried blood on his neck, and Dean let out a loud gasp when he realised Cas was breathing, slow and rhythmically.
Dean was like a zombie, only sleeping when he absolutely couldn’t stay awake or when he drank himself unconscious. Sometimes he started crying over the weirdest things, things Sam never would have even related to Cas. Before, Dean would have tried to hide his pain from his brother, considering it a weakness, but it seemed to Sam as though this sadness was so vast he simply didn’t care anymore.
“No,” Cas says slowly. “Just the hunts. Dean, we’re going to have to talk about how reckless you’re being. You’re lucky you always have Sam looking out for you, but still, if I hadn’t stepped in today you could have died.”
“Cas,” Dean answered shakily, trying to control the mix of emotions that had been building in him ever since he saw Cas’ body lying in that barn. Sam had told Dean he needed to talk to Cas but Cas didn’t seem to be offering up any information as to what they needed to talk about, so Dean took the initiative and asked, “How did you escape?”
he thought,
“Dean,” Cas says gently, a sad smile gracing his features.
“No, Dean. You’re not,” Sam barks as he pushes Dean into a chair and begins to clean the blood off of his hand. “I just walked in on you bleeding everywhere and yelling at the wall, you’re very far from
“What the hell is going on with you?” Sam shouts, as he smacks Dean’s hand away from the terrible bandaging job and grabs the first aid kit to sort it out himself.
glad you’re back,” Dean was close to tears at this point so he trailed off, not wanting to start blubbering in front of Cas like he had been in front of Sam the past few days. Cas shot Dean a small smile as Dean gestured awkwardly towards the door, “I’m jus’ gonna… leave you to get some rest for now,” Dean was sure that Cas would need some, and he was hoping that now Cas was back he would finally be able to get some peace himself.
Deepening the kiss, Dean rolls on top of Cas, eventually moving away from his lips to kiss and suck at his neck and, unbuttoning his shirt, he begins to kiss down his chest.
“Uh, yeah, basically,” he eventually responds weakly.
“I will,” Charlie volunteers, “I kinda wanna get it over with tbh. Er… No offence guys.”
“Okay,” Dean said with a deep breath. “I just didn’t know if we were on the same page, y’know, with you being an angel. I didn’t know if it meant something different to you.”
) and when they eventually break away for breath and he’s holding Cas in his arms and looking into his bright, gorgeous eyes, Dean only has one thought running through his mind;
Dean tries not to glare at Sam as he clears his throat and offhandedly spouts some bullshit about how they’ll
“So you haven’t seen how I’ve been… the rest of the time?”
“If there was a way, don’t you think Jack would have brought him back with everyone else?” Dean says, finally meeting Sam’s eye. Sam is silent at this, not sure how to counter such a logical argument. Dean just sighs as he pulls his hand from Sam’s grip and gets up to leave.
When Sam pies him in the face it’s almost a relief that he can let his happy façade slip.
Sam shot him a judgmental look, but didn’t comment on it. “Massive energy spike in Illinois, not sure what it could be but I’m heading to check it out,” Sam said breathlessly, and from the panicked look in his eyes Dean could tell this was something
– I have ever felt this for and the only one I ever will. I loved you before I even knew what the feeling was – before I even knew I was
There was an explosion of light and Cas felt himself being thrown backwards, through some invisible barrier, as if hitting the surface of water. And then, he finally fell asleep.
He thought back to his call with Eileen earlier, when he had explained to her everything that had gone down. He was desperate to see her but he didn’t know what Dean would do if left on his own right now, so had told Eileen he needed to be there for Dean and Eileen had understood, of course. She had assured Sam that she was fine and he could take all the time he needed to look after his brother, and Sam loved her even more for her compassion.
, three weeks, Cas, and you can't even call?!" He would have continued shouting for a lot longer if the angel hadn't have suddenly stepped into Dean's personal space and gently wrapped his arms around the other man.
Dean had questions –
“Uh huh. And now you’re all–” Dean motions vaguely up and down Cas’ body and pulls a face that he hopes conveys his meaning. “You don’t feel that for me anymore. That’s why you didn’t come back.”
when he told me he loved me?”
(not that he thinks he has a chance with him or anything). But there’s obviously nothing he can do about it. So he grumbles a bit, pulls a load of annoyed faces, and hits Benny a couple of times for making mocking kissy noises at him, before eventually he gives in.
me. I will
. Dean knows that even if he lives to see a hundred, he will never grow tired of kissing Castiel.
“Of course I wanted you around,” Dean replies immediately. Angry, but mainly at himself for all he’d done in the past to make Cas think this. “But even if I
Suddenly, the sound of thunder fills the air and the barn walls shake, there's a blinding flash of light, and Cas appears at the doorway to the barn; trench coat billowing behind him, dark wings raised and eyes glowing a bright white. Fury radiates from him. He lifts a hand and the bulbs in the nearby lamps burst as the three remaining demons that had been stalking towards Dean, drop to the floor.
it always hits me hard; he’s my best friend and this time… I just don’t think he’s coming back.”
happened. He ignores this though, in favour of cracking a joke, just like the old Dean would.
Three days after Cas had returned to the bunker, Sam pulled Dean aside and told him he was finally going to visit Eileen.
He knew he wanted to see that smile every day for the rest of his life, and he knew how to make that happen.
Dean noticed the panic on Sam’s face and tried to calm himself down.
to deny it. Poor Cas looks utterly distraught and Dean realises he should probably say something in response instead of just standing there, gaping like an idiot.
“Do you not like it? Want me to stop?” and fuck, Dean could sort of see where Cas’s previous partners had been coming from because the man sounded entirely too coherent for what he was doing, but the sick thing was that it was actually turning Dean on even more.
“No, thank you.”
“You’re all red,” Cas said quietly, his calm tone belying the filthy, filthy cant of his fingers. “You’ve been too rough on yourself.”
“Yeah. Dean is… yeah. Look, you’ve got to understand, I think a lot of it has to do with our Dad.”
He didn’t think, just wrapped his legs around Cas’s hips to urge him on, felt the fabric of Cas’s shirt on his belly and dick, drank into Cas’s scent surrounding him and let himself drown into the sheer pleasure of it all. The bed creaked, headboard slamming so hard on the wall it was sure to leave marks, and Dean vaguely thought that he’d never fucked this hard in his own bed and he should maybe envy Cas’s superior manliness but he couldn’t bring himself to care, not when Cas was taking him so hard, so deep, so good. He was barely lucid enough to mumble his assent when Cas asked to knot him, and when he felt the real-life flesh swell inside him he came so hard he blacked out.
“I believe I would like that,” he said. “I am going to alert my friends, I shall be back when you are finished with your work.” Danny winked at him and Castiel made his way back to their table. Dean and Sam were there, the former staring down at the table, the latter watching him curiously.
“Ah, it’s like… you know how Dean sleeps around--or used to. But he doesn’t really care about those girls, his family always comes first, and his best friends--that’d be you” Castiel allowed himself a brief flash of pleasure at the label. “What I’m trying to say is, I think Dean feels threatened if you sleep with guys because then it’s like what you and him have might be… less special.” Sam looked like he wanted to say more, but at Castiel’s prodding he insisted he had nothing more to say. Castiel did not press the issue, because even what Sam had told him was… unfathomable. Dean was the single most important person in Castiel’s life. The love and devotion Castiel felt for Dean was unparalleled, and to even think that his brief sexual escapades with anyone either of the female or male persuasion could change that was utterly laughable.
“Ah, Daddy issues,” Danny nodded sympathetically, “we all have them.”
“I’m not a child, Dean.”
“Or,” Cas says, “I could help you.”
Him and Sam go out for hunts still, and they try to find leads on the Darkness, but most of the time they stay in the bunker, all cooped up together and cozy like a happy fucking family. Except with pent-up sexual tension. It’s really no wonder that things, eventually, come to a head.
“The man in the corner. He is very attractive,” Cas repeated, easy as you please. Dean tried and failed to recover his cool.
He fell asleep on the couch. The room is dark, the tv screen frozen on a close-up of the lead character’s face, and Cas is leaning over him, peering at his face. The thing that Dean thought he felt on his crotch? That was the fucking empty popcorn bowl, and he apparently started bucking his hips up under it in his sleep because he’s that much of a sad fuck. It’s tilted already, and Dean tracks it with his eyes as it gently slides off his lap and lands on the couch cushion.
“Dean,” he said, “you are aware that I love you very much, right?”
Cas smiled back at him and undulated his hips languidly. Pleasure ripped down Dean’s spine and his brain short-circuited and okay, maybe Cas was showing off a little but what the fuck, the guy had earned it.
Dean scrunched her nose.
“Wait a minute, I’ll open the shop’s door, so you can climb up.”
“I certainly won’t.” retorted Castiel, feeling her cheeks blushing with annoyance.
