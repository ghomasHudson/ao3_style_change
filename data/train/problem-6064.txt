Steve just nodded but said nothing, almost like he'd expected as much.
Tony flashed a tight smile at him. "Yeah. You sure you didn't just plan this all at the last minute because JARVIS let it slip that I was maybe a little upset about it?"
The girl at the desk looked at her computer screen and said, "OK, Ms. Carbonell—" She reached over and picked up a series of papers attached to a clipboard. "If you could just fill these out—"
"And that is?" Natasha asked.
"I don't ever, ever want to hear you people piss and moan about what we do ever again. You hear me?" he said as he and Steve made the second cut together.
A couple of the others in the gallery turned to him at that but said or did nothing otherwise, and Ella's gaze pointedly went down to Tony's abdomen. Tony followed, matching her gaze with his own, and he put a hand on his belly and said, "He might be a hundred, but he's clearly not
"You know," he called out, "on second thought, I think I'm going to take a shower, too."
"Overwhelming?"
"'Knocked up.' It sounds so…"
Tony Stark? Iron Man. Avenger. Genius, billionaire, philanthropist?"
"You know what I mean, though. I knew Steve back then. He's… A lot of him's the same, but a lot of him's different now. Not sure I know him any better than he knows me. But I know who he was, and trust me, I've never seen him lose his head over anyone the way he's lost his head over you."
And Motown. He seemed to like Motown.
"Uh, you know we're married, right? JARVIS had your name put on the accounts, like, the very next day."
"Hey," Steve said, reaching up with his other hand to cup it around the hand he already held, his face sober and serious, "you know all that, right? Don't ever doubt that for a second. It's you and me, together through all of this, got it? I am
all that unbelievable?"
"Language," Steve said without thinking, and Tony turned to him.
Call him crazy — call him whatever you want — but there was a part of him that could still
But Steve let his guard down at one point, and that's when Tony took his chance to sneak out and make his way down to his lab. The lights came on upon his arrival, though DUM-E, who normally wheeled over to him in greeting, stayed over at his charging station and merely raised his arm at Tony as though to inspect the intruder in the lab.
"No. Here, think about it. Who was Tony Stark very publicly dating before all this started?"
He watched as Steve swallowed and stared down at the blankets that covered his lap, and he made a weird tic with his mouth and shrugged like he was embarrassed or abashed over something as he picked at a loose string.
"Yeah, but he's such a…motor-mouth," Barnes said because clearly he was jealous of Bruce's top spot on Tony's I'm-going-to-kill-the-son-of-a-bitch-when-I-have-the-chance list and had decided to challenge him for the title. "I thought he'd be shrieking out obscenities left and right at everyone."
"Uh," Bruce said, "does she usually?"
Steve winced away from him, and Tony realized he'd probably cried out a little louder than he'd meant. "Why not?" Steve asked.
Tony tweaked a smile at her then went back to the chair and sat down. He huffed a little and tried to get comfortable, shifting position every ten seconds until Steve said, "
"Would you even have
"Round six-hundred-and-sixteen of the pissing match," Tony said and picked up his glass to take a sip of the watered-down concoction through the little red swizzle stick. He swallowed down the taste and smacked his lips then said a breezy, "Come to apologize?"
Tony smirked at him. "Oh, think you're so smart, do you?" he asked then produced a spatula. "I'm very carefully going to scoop them off."
"Why…
"It's not that bad."
"Whatever," Tony said, realizing once again that he had to pee. "Ugh," he muttered and struggled to get up from where he sat on the couch, grumbling to himself and flailing pathetically as he did so.
hold up his end of the bargain—"
"No," he said with more disgust than he'd meant. He only now realized Tony was still rambling.
"Babe, she's probably been dead a good twenty years by this point."
"I didn't say you weren't," Rhodey said, quietly, like he was trying to avoid upsetting him. "I just said her real dad— I wasn't even trying to— Look, it was just a bad joke, all right? It was a stupid joke." He motioned at the pot. "Is that even edible?"
don't understand exactly how I feel about this!"
Bruce raised an eyebrow at him. "What's really going on here, Tony?" he asked, exhaustion coloring his tone.
" he shrieked, his voice hitting that high, pitchy screech he hated. "He goddamned did, Steve, and if you can't see that—"
Tony rolled his eyes and shook his head in disbelief while Wilson said a quiet and lamenting, "Yeah."
, he was built, wasn't he? He kind of just wanted to…bite…Steve's stomach — sink his teeth into that hard, firm muscle and lave it with his tongue all the way down—
Tony groaned and slid off Steve's lap, muttering, "He couldn't just fucking
He bit off another large chunk of his slice, and Tony watched him a moment then said, "Are you saying this because you really don't want it or you don't think you deserve it?"
Other Tony continued to talk, but Tony stared at him, gawking, squinting and thinking — wondering…

. Yes, Sir," he choked out, his throat slightly raw from abuse.
He shrugged. "I told you, not particularly. Weird, but no weirder than giving birth."
Steve, hold on!" he said through laughter, and Steve stopped and waited for Tony to get a hold of himself.
inside of him that was making him do things like that, wasn't it? Or it was all the come that Steve had pumped into him over the course of the past couple years? That was it. It was— He had too much of
Her eyes went wide. "But that's what you said! Daddy heard it, too. He tol' me I didn't hear that, but I heard it!"
"Nope," Tony said and peered at whatever he was reading on his tablet — a recipe, he supposed — one hand on a rolling pin and the other reaching into the pile of flour. "I told you — you feed that baby, you take care of whatever comes of it."
He snapped a bra on, rubbing his slightly tender breasts through the padded material to give himself some comfort, before he shimmied into the pajamas. He towel-dried his hair and pulled it into a ponytail, and it was as he was carrying the towels back to the bathroom to hang up (because unlike
"There?" he asked tentatively, but Tony just hummed a little and sat a little straighter, arching into the feel.
Without hesitation, he pushed in, taking less time and care than he normally did when he pushed into Tony, and Tony gasped, his eyes shooting open, and he let out a breath and looked at Steve — his pupils blown so wide his eyes almost looked black — and said a somewhat bemused, "Holy shit, I think you just took my virginity."
Tony frowned. "Who told you?"
"Oh, you did the math on that?"
"Ten minutes," Tony repeated and watched as Bruce hesitated, fidgeted, then turned and made his way out the door.
"These chairs are really uncomfortable."
He stayed slumped against the door of the stall until he was certain he'd gotten control of himself, and then he washed up, soaping his hands up extra good and wishing he had access to a change of clothes because even though he'd been extremely careful about not getting any of his spend on his pants, he couldn't help but wonder if there was something he'd missed—
"Look, I know I come off as a giant ass—"
She just cooed a bit and slapped her hands against his chest.
"Hmph," Welch muttered and set his glass down once more. "I could have sworn."
They followed the nurse back not to an examining room, but to the doctor's personal office. Tony had a feeling this wasn't standard procedure, but he kept his mouth shut about it and went along with it.
He swallowed and, ache subsiding for the moment as he stood perfectly still, said, "Anybody not authorized to be in this penthouse somehow gets in, you fry them, J. You hear me? You fry my daughter, and I'll reassign your new primary user as Barton, and you'll spend the rest of your life looking up the dumbest fucking stuff that you'll
He pushed himself to his feet and grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair. He threaded his arms through the sleeves and grabbed his keys from the counter. They'd be coming to collect him for the mission soon, but he still had some time to himself. Maybe he'd go get a coffee. Maybe he'd grab a newspaper. Maybe he'd step in front of a bus.
"Are you talking about the sprout or the Rascal?" Bruce asked.
to die for."
Yeah, you're that kind of doctor."
"I do not understand," he said. "I consider you to be among the truest of partnerships I have seen amongst the nine realms. Even the Goddess Esmeralda senses the bond that you share and feels it to be among the strongest she has ever made acquaintance with." He smiled a little. "The current misunderstanding between you and the Captain aside."
He shucked the rest of the wrapping paper to reveal—
But it was peaceful, staring at the city from this high up. Not that it helped him with his quandary any. There was still a mysterious little four-year-old sleeping on his couch that called him 'Papa' and, evidently, the Cap 'Daddy.' If he couldn't figure out a way to get her back to where she belonged before the Cap came back, oh, yeah, that would go over like gangbusters. He didn't know what the Cap would balk at more: being a father—
"Parents?" Bruce asked. "Other siblings?"
Steve hummed a bit in thought before he said, "That's part of it."
"I thought you didn't want to encourage it?"
"Right here good?" he asked and held his arms out as though to await the shot of whatever it was she did to change him from one body to the other.
daughter. Also, three words— I. Hate. Magic. Hate it. Despise it. Want it wiped from existence in all the nine realms. That would wipe a good eight of those from existence, and fucking good for them. There's one exception to that, but again, I can't tell you what that is mostly because, yeah, you're not ready for that." He laughed and shook his head some. "You're so not ready for that."

"Whatever," Barton said. "Bad guys are a pain in the ass, but I guess if there weren't any, we'd be out of a job. God, we'd have to work like

or accepted what had happened to him, and he wasn't sure he was quite ready to take that step yet. Oh, sure, he'd admitted to JARVIS that he was kind of enjoying the whole thing, but saying he
Stark made some sort of annoyed sound and pushed away from the car, spinning around to face Steve once more. “Yeah? What makes you even think I
"Good. When I come in your mouth, you're going to swallow, do you understand?"
He turned to Steve to see how he was taking his news — the 'jerking off' thing, not the 'best man' thing. Steve just sat there, still a little pink in the face, with his elbows resting on the arms of the chair, his hands folded over his abdomen, and a somewhat bemused and self-deprecating twist to his lips.
But none of her unease had let up. "I'm serious, Tony. Steve…leans on you." Tony scoffed, but she continued, "You're what grounds him. He's got the rest of us, and he's got the hunt for his old pal, but those are distractions. You… You made the future safe for him. You made it OK for him. Things aren't as scary for him as they could be because he's got you leading the way for him. He knows you're not going to let him fall any more than he's going to let you fall."
Tony glanced down at himself. "OK, first of all, that is horribly sexist and—"
"Yeah," Barton agreed, hunching over his coffee and seemingly inhaling the vapors, "and no one can seem to figure out which one or where. Or if any of them are working together—"
you get married."
"You said Unca Bruce's stuff tastes like stuff in dried walls!"
Tony paused in mid-cut and looked at him. "
"What Steve didn't know wouldn't hurt him," Hill said plainly, though Tony could tell from the rapid blink of her eyes and the tone of her voice that she was having a hard time admitting to herself the truth of Steve's condition.
for you?"
Tony motioned to a clearing just off the road. "If you'd really rather not wait, there's always that.
Bruce turned to him, the engines of the 'jet gearing up, and a suited-up Wilson called out from the loading ramp, "Nat! Let's go!"
"I'm going to tear. I could fucking hemorrhage. I could
The next morning, Steve was up and gone by the time he woke up, and he frowned at Steve's cold, empty, but rumpled side of the bed and muttered, "I didn't think the honeymoon was supposed to be over
"Like you?" Wilson asked with a raised eyebrow, and Barton shrugged.
Rhodey turned his attention to Steve. "Cap?"
"I'm sorry. Are you that disgusted by me that you can't even look at me?"
"You had to have remembered this then, didn't you? I mean didn't it—? And when I told you about—?" He clamped his mouth a moment then added, "Unless my not being so…" He blinked and looked at Steve, and Steve watched as Tony's eyes skirted all over his face before he said with an exhale of breath, "Well, probably only a couple months difference, anyway. Worked past it soon enough."
"You could call me 'Tony,'" he said and raised an eyebrow.
He just shot Tony a
bad though — or maybe a little disconcerting, anyway — was the actual production of milk. To say that Tony was producing milk was an understatement. He'd read the literature — yeah, yeah, he'd been reading up on this shit more now instead of leaving it to Steve — and he found the overabundance of fluid was totally natural and would even itself out once the baby got onto a regular schedule.
"Which do you like better?" another one of the guys said. "I mean, which one is the sex better in?"
"Why do you think you're a burden to everyone?"
Steve didn't know what a 'turn-on' was, but judging from the way Tony tightened his hold and nuzzled into Steve's neck, he took it as a good thing.
He sighed a little. "I…I've had to fight for everything I've ever gotten my whole life. Before I went into the army — well, really, I guess before I got that—"
Wilson just held up his phone some. "But this is the
" Wilson said and huffed as he sat back against the chair, Barnes sitting on his lap.
He couldn't breathe. Goddamn it, why couldn't be breathe? Why weren't his lungs expanding? Why was it so hot in here all of a sudden?
Steve sobered, and he broke the gaze with Tony and turned to Barnes. "That won't be necessary," he said, the voice pure Captain America, and even Barnes seem to understand it was a different tone than he was accustomed to. He frowned a little at Steve but then shrugged like he couldn't be bothered to figure it out, and Steve turned his attention to Tony. The voice was, again, pure Captain America, but the concern was all Steve Rogers — or Steve Stark-Rogers.
"It really bothers you that much that they moved to California?" Tony asked after a moment.
Bruce rolled his eyes. "That's not what I mean, and you know it."
Steve thought about this a moment. "So, I'm not a day over...twe— ah, twenty-five," he said, fumbling for the age at first as he tried to remember just how old he'd been when he'd been serumed-up.
"Wait, recollections?" Tony cut in. "Are you saying we should be able to
about that."
"Your
"What? It's a legit means of trying to pull one over on the Board. You really think I can waltz in there and tell them
She just nodded again and turned to make her way to the door. "Go to sleep. I'm going to have JARVIS monitor you to make sure that you do. Don't make me have to come back here." She turned back to him and smiled knowingly. "You won't like it if I do."
Yeah, maybe not a question he wanted to have answered.
Steve made a face. "That's…not what paper straws were like at all."
He rolled his eyes. "You fuss more than Steve."
But he shook his head, unable to fully comprehend what was happening just yet. "I don't understand. You were— They said— They all said— It was all over the—"
Tony glanced back and watched as the guy ran an appraising eye over Natasha and said, "You look familiar."
attractive in your male form."
Tony scoffed and said, "Throw it over the couch for all I care. You do have a couch underneath that pile of crap, don't you?"
He made to continue on his way — Tony hadn't left him a message, and they'd never made definite plans anyway — but something compelled him not to cross the street and head over to the subway per usual but to instead walk around the corner to at least maybe say a proper 'goodbye' to the one that had gotten away, and though he wanted to say something cool or something smart or witty, the only word that came out of his mouth was, "Hey."
He traced light fingertips over Tony's back.
"I think he's the poster child for 'failing up,'" Tony mused.
"Locked my keys in the car," he muttered and pulled out his phone.
"He told me I was his first," Tony said. "But I'm not exactly sure what Steve considers 'sex.' Much as I explain to him that it is, I don't think he considers getting sucked off 'sex.' Or eating out, for that matter."
to believe.
But he just nodded and said, "Positive."
"Yeah, and shouldn't she be in bed?"
just friends."
Tony mewled out a desperate and wanton cry because if Steve kept going the way he was, he wasn't sure he
"However long you feel comfortable for."
a nice—"
Steve, the bastard, just leaned down and made like he was going to kiss him but instead licked the jelly away from his mouth.
"There you are," she said and glanced back at her computer like she was closing down something. "I was just beginning to worry." She motioned to the door beside the window and said, "Come on through. Got the office to ourselves." And then she looked at Steve and said, "There should be a deadbolt on the door out there. Would you mind turning that?"
He took another bite, and Steve watched him — or, better, watched the sandwich — and asked, "You gonna finish that?"
"I'm just saying— You think Ross is the one he's talking about?"
Tony blinked and shook his head to pull himself out of his thoughts. "I'm sorry. What?"
trying to insult you in any way — maybe…they didn't think you were as much
He went to reach for Barnes's arm, but Barnes turned on him, and a flash of murder crossed his eyes before it vanished, and he pulled his arm away from Tony's reach.
Or like talking to Cap. Well, wasn't that a coincidence?
He grimaced and scratched at his forehead again. "I, uh, I think I made plans with him."
Natasha just shrugged.
The Councilors shared looks with each other at that, those words having not been spoken to anyone outside of private meetings deep within the confines of the castle.
"And you're attesting to the fact that you are the Anthony Edward Stark named on this application?"
in stilettos — "when I was younger." He continued to clutch tight to Natasha's arm to keep his balance. "But that was only 'cause I thought I was supposed to enjoy it. I never actually
"—about the Board, but you can't be bothered to come out here for my
"I love being Iron Man," Tony said, sort of like he was answering Steve's question but mostly like he was still caught up in his own thoughts. "I love — It's the first thing in my life that I've ever done that I'm actually proud of."
Steve made a face of contemplation, and Tony said, "You're thinking about it, aren't you? Wondering what it's like."
But Steve, conveniently, had seemingly passed out, his eyes closed and his mouth open and slack. Tony pursed his lips and reached out to poke him in the pectoral, petulant and annoyed, and Natasha reached out and pulled his hand away and said, "Go sit down, Stark."
again. The whole penetration thing? Yeah, no matter what fantasies were cooking up in Steve's perverted old brain, probably would want to wait on that until they could secure about five different reliable forms of birth control. He was definitely

He blinked several times and swallowed, and Steve knew an attempt at suppressing tears when he saw one. He hadn't meant for their date to go this way. He was kind of hoping they could just pick up where they'd left off.
," but he still turned in the direction of the voice and saw that same put-together young woman from inside the café.
"Early Pink Floyd," Tony said. "Before they started recording stuff people actually wanted to listen to."
"Haven't really had time, jellybean. Been sorta…babysitting alternate universe me's kid and trying not to break her. Seem to be doing OK so far."
"It's… I don't know what it is, really. I mean I'm happy—" He looked up at Tony quickly. "Don't get me wrong! I'm happy here. With you and the team and…the future's
Steve just exhaled a short breath through his nose as he looked through the folder. "That's not a valid reason for choosing her program," he said, his eyes scanning over printed request after printed request.
"Yeah, at least when he was pocket-sized, I could just grab him and hoist him out of trouble. Kind of hard to do now that he's bigger than I am."
"Honey, it's true. It's very, very true. You still think you're the underdog. You still think you have to prove that you're valuable to the world. Trust me, you're valuable. You're wanted, and you're needed. Look, I like Captain America as much as the next guy. He's awesome. But given a choice between him and Steve Rogers? I pick Steve Rogers every time."
"Yeah, I know what he said, but he's not exactly an ob/gyn. He doesn't know anything more about this than we do—"
after ten minutes of barely any work whatsoever, and he spent the remaining time in the living room with Rhodey, the TV tuned to one of the 24-hour cable news stations that was alternating between talking about the upcoming midterms and Captain America's very pregnant date at the previous night's Foundation gala. Tony could hear it as he sat in the bedroom and let Pepper and Natasha play with him like a dress-up doll, even if he would rather be in the living room discussing it with Steve and Rhodey, who were trying to rationalize their way through how this press conference was even going to go.
"No, it's fine. It's fine, Stevie. You trust a...stranger...with your kid more than you trust me."
And then, because he really, really couldn't entirely trust that being, he shot a quick glance behind him to make sure she hadn't given him a tail or something.
"Sweet! Gelato!" Clint said as he walked into the kitchen, tablet in hand. He grabbed a spoon from the drawer and made to scoop a spoonful out of the gelato container, but Tony took his own spoon and thwacked Clint hard over the knuckles with it, which earned him a, "The
To say Tony was blindsided or caught unaware would be an understatement. Like the flip of a switch, they were all up, all taking presumably predetermined places as they made their move — one that had clearly been discussed at length at some point prior. Or maybe the years of working together had finally paid off and they all just knew instinctively what to do without having to run it past each other.
"OK, but…you know you have to try to get her back, right?"
think—
He finally sat up, and he pushed himself to his feet and went into the kitchen and sat down at the island to wait for Steve. Knowing Steve, he'd only remembered to send that message as soon as he'd gotten into the lobby downstairs.
"You already did know. Don't pretend like I never got drunk and overshared my deepest, darkest teenage fantasies with you."
find out you told him that—"
"Yes, we do," Bruce said and strolled over to him. "You don't even know if she's from this world—"
anything."
"What? No—"
But what sucked — what fucking sucked more than anything — about it was that it wasn't by choice. It had been done to him against his will, and he shivered at the very thought that someone could have that much control over him. So, he didn't think about it. In fact, he tried to pretend like it hadn't even happened. That he hadn't been turned into a woman. That the rest of the team didn't see him any differently.
"I have to do a physical exam, Tony," he said with a sigh. "I'm going to need to see how dilated you are."
Tony just blinked at him again, almost feeling like he'd been betrayed. "Did any of you think to, I don't know,
"But nothing," he said. "Look, I don't expect you to believe me," he said, his eyes doing a dance with her ice blue ones, "but I can
"Uh, it's weaponized armor designed to withstand, I don't know, alien hordes. It's not made out of aluminum."
Tony looked up, and to Steve's surprise, a smile broke out over his face. "Hey." "Waiting for someone?"
Tony made a 'pfft' sound.
"I didn't want to be the one to tell you this," he murmured but wouldn't look at Tony.
Steve nodded, his hands falling away from Olivia's head, and figured that would have to suffice for an answer. Somehow, he had a feeling that it meant a lot more than it seemed on the surface.
"If you want to even call it that. Don't worry, I did the reading and a little bit is totally OK."
"And you think this is?"
"I practically was. Also, this designer of yours may have the goods, but her bedside manner could use a little work."
And suddenly, Tony seemed to understand what Steve was suggesting, a broad, knowing smile spreading over his lips.
"No, it's 'Colonel' to you. You lost that privilege when you brought this home."
He frowned and shook his head. "No, Steve, I couldn't ask you to—"
He grimaced and looked from the doctor and then to Steve and back again, and he knowing he wasn't going to get out of answering the question — god knows he'd tried — he averted his gaze and muttered, "I try not to think about it."
An art studio.
"Yeah, Tones, we know. We get it," Rhodey said. He then motioned to the small amount left on his plate and said, "Here, you want mine?"
"Why?" Natasha asked, a glass of something burgundy-colored in her hand.
He smiled and nodded his thanks to her then turned to Bruce and said, "Seriously, she could do wonders with you."
Steve just shrugged at him. "You never know. And what do you mean bring me back to life? What, like Frankenstein's monster?"
or something?"
Both men turned to glare at her like she'd just committed the most ultimate betrayal, and she just smiled a little and sat back, pleased with herself for what she'd said.
But Tony just sighed and said, "Honestly, Steve, I'm tired, and I... I think it's time we face the facts here."
"Stay here when they arrive? Don't— Don't torture yourself."
But the reporter was undeterred, and she stuck close and again asked, "Are you pregnant with Captain America's baby?"
"There is little that is not in my powers," she said, and she cast a glance over to 'Viz' after she said this, smiling at him faintly before turning back to the Council. "You wish him to fall in love with a wealthy noblewoman?"
Tony ran it through in his head in an attempt to figure out which year for certain it was, but Steve wasn't buying his concern. "Doesn't matter," he said like his word was law. "It's completely fictional."
"I owe it to a lot of people," Barnes added, a little quieter. "And I know there's no way to… I know saying 'I'm sorry' won't cut it, and I know saving your life and being there to help you through the birth of your kid doesn't make up for anything, either, but I just... I don't ever expect you to forgive me for what I did."
"I don't...really have a lot of experience with kids," he said but couldn't fathom why. The less this Tony knew about him, the better.
Steve groaned and rolled his eyes, most of the fight going out of him as he slumped over Thor's shoulder, and Tony sputtered a few times as he processed what this meant and said, "Are you fucking kidding me? Is there
Tony scoffed. "Yeah, I think it is," he said and took another painful sip of his coffee, literally finishing with an 'ack' sound and sticking his tongue out in disgust.
"Yeah, the only people that say that are the ones that can't get anything but self-lovin'," Tony said.
"Why?"
Tony practically cried. "What isn't possible?"
to her. Hill and Natasha are both hot, but would I
"Hmm? What stuff?"
Tony didn't feel like going back to bed because what was the point? Steve wasn't there, so Steve couldn't help finish what he'd started
"Are you mad because she likes the phone more than the robot?"
"I don't know what you're talking about," Steve said with a laugh then pulled the empty bottle away from the baby and set it down on the counter.
"No," he said and looked at her. "Don't hide it from him— her— whatever the hell he is. He deserves to know." He turned back to Tony. "They were in a building. Steve was there. Building came crashing down."
"Wait,
"Whatever," he muttered and switched back over to reading the newsfeeds from the day until he felt someone staring at him again, and he turned to see those same two women trying very hard not to look like they'd been watching him the entire time.
"Yeah, Grandpa, nobody calls them 'four-letter words' anymore."
Tony was crushed.
"What? I never said—"
And, wait,
"Steve," he said as Steve braced an arm over the door, "let me go."
"Hey, I'd like to see either of you do any better!" He directed his attention to the kid. "Hey, brat. Do either Uncle Bruce or Uncle Rhodey have spawn of their own?"
"You know," Steve said and pulled Tony into his embrace, taking Tony's arms and wrapping them around his waist before he put his arms tight around Tony, "we should probably preemptively work off some calories before we stuff ourselves full of Chinese. I don't know about you, but I ate an awful lot of Christmas cookies the past couple days."
Steve just shot Tony a look before he went back to the folder, not even deigning to respond with words, and Barton said, "Him wanting to pork one of you is stupid, but him being a vampire is totally legit?"
Steve, still half-asleep, looked over in concern.
I mean why would you and Steve even—"
And, as though to prove Tony's words, she held the cookie back out to Steve. Steve made a face, and he looked between Olivia, the soppy cookie in her hand, Tony, the cookie, Olivia, and back to Tony again.
me here! I know I don't look like I'm twenty-five, but I don't think I look like I'm forty-three, either."
conception she 'blesses,' and the wonderful and special father of my child refuses to chance anything because of that."
Bucky grinned licentiously then sobered as he turned back to Steve. "Seriously, that was an abusive relationship waiting to happen. Severed body parts stuffed into garbage bags and strewn along the highway. Head in the freezer. Pretty sure that's how that relationship would have ended. Your body parts, not his."
"This is scary. I get that. I'm not going to let you get hurt. We're going to figure it out. Whatever happens, we're going to figure it out, and it's going to be OK."
Bruce shrugged. "Could run an ultrasound." Tony made a face. "Will it hurt?"
"You know," he said as he spotted tiny little baby clothes hanging over the sides of the bassinette where there hadn't been any before, "it's kind of weird that the rest of the city's supposedly the setting for a dystopian novel, and you guys are clearly able to get your hands on things I bookmarked weeks ago."
"It wasn't supposed to be so obvious. You know it's probably already on those horrible sites like TMZ and…"
She made her way over to him and leaned against the table, folding her arms as she looked at him but didn't say anything, and Tony fumbled a little under her gaze but kept his cool as he grabbed his soldering iron again.
"Are we expecting company?" Steve had asked.
, and I hope to god your significant other has never exceeded the BMI for 'underweight' because I can only imagine you would spend every day of their life reminding them of that. And second, yeah, I
Tony thought back a moment to the hesitance, the unease, the nervousness and misery that had plagued Barnes — jeez, maybe it was time to start referring to him by his first name, too? — when that fucking asshole Hydra agent had cornered him and taunted him. He didn't
He stopped short and frowned as he thought about this.
He sighed and popped the cap on it, and she looked at her plate expectantly like she expected him to squirt the offending substance onto the eggs he'd just slaved to cook so…
Steve crowded fully into his space at that. "I could strangle that man for ever putting that doubt in your head. You are…amazing. You're absolutely amazing. You're intelligent and funny and you give so much and you love so much. And you're gorgeous. You're absolutely gorgeous."
the sparklers on the cake (and he was determined to get those bastards on the cake), and so he'd just gone with twenty-nine, which was, as best Tony could figure, the amount of lived experience Steve actually had (which…yeah, he was
Steve nodded. "I noticed. Looks good on you."
Steve laughed — an honest and true laugh — and he shook his head some before he met Tony's eyes again, his smile much lighter and truer than the last one had been.
Again, Steve tensed up beside him, but he just squeezed his arm and said, "OK, that's…really kind of personal and none of your business. I mean, really, that's mine and Steve's choice and not anyone else's. I mean, as it turns out, we really
Steve shot him a displeased look, and Barton shoved a spoonful of cereal in his mouth — two- forty-five in the afternoon, and he was shoveling Lucky Charms into his mouth — as Hill came into the kitchen, folder in-hand and serious look covering her face. She dropped the folder down in front of Steve, who looked up at her and said, "Is this all of them?"
"Old people are 'cute,' Steve. We're not old."
"You mean with us?"
"Hang on. Let me mark that on my calendar," Tony muttered and pulled the chair out to sit in it.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Who would do that, man?"
Steve hedged a bit, grimacing and glancing down at the sketch that he wouldn't let Tony see. "I don't know if I should."
"Wasn't it? You seemed pretty damned horrified that I was even suggesting anything remotely salacious—"
Her grip went a little tighter making Tony fight just a little harder. "Oh, no, please, let me—" she tried to say, but Tony succeeded in yanking his arms away, and he gave her a funny little look before he turned to waddle back in the direction of the personal elevator. He walked about ten feet before he threw a glance over his shoulder to see if the…he guessed she was a doctor by the white coat…was still standing there, but she was gone, and there was a gurney and a couple of what looked like nurses standing where she had been.
“Why, you wanton little slut,” he purred and pushed the plug a little deeper. “You were planning this, weren’t you? You knew exactly what you were doing disobeying me.”
He huffed a little and decided to humor her. "And how does he look at me?"
Tony thought about this a moment — thought about a tiny human being actually
Tony exhaled a breath. "We gotta be more careful now. I kind of have the feeling our joint fertility is through the roof, and unless I want to spend the rest of my, well, childbearing years pregnant, we've gotta watch what we're doing."
He glanced back, met Tony's gaze again, and said with so much love and hope in his voice that Tony almost begged him to take him with him, "Not yet."
"Unfortunately," Barnes continued and stood beside Natasha to lean against the table, re-folding his arms so that his metal arm rested above his flesh arm, "this little faction is a lot bigger than they thought. They're still playing catch-up, trying to stop the other targets from going offline, too."
"Uh, hey, kiddo," Bruce said, tentative and hesitant. "What are you doing here?"
"Oh," he said but wasn't sure how to feel about JARVIS's explanation. It would almost seem like they were trying to hide something from him — or at least from JARVIS — but Tony had seen no reason for them to do so. After all, it's not like they'd pulled anything like this in the past. Maybe they were just stepping out for a drink or something?
Steve frowned and took gentle hold of Olivia's hands to pull the cookie away from her mouth so that he could get a better look at it. She whined and tried to pull it back, but he just held her hands and looked over the shape that looked more like, well…
Steve set the remaining parts on the floor then pointed to the box. "Says right here for newborns to age three."
They watched a couple movies while Olivia napped, the one that had been on when he'd first come downstairs that morning about a kid that desperately wanted a BB gun (and he was inclined to agree that the dumb kid would just shoot his eye out with it) as well as a more recent one about a giant, overgrown elf that included a character that, according to Tony, looked exactly like Happy, whoever that was. He liked the one with the kid more, if only because it was clearly trying to ape the time that he himself came from, though there were certain details about it that were a little off, and Tony seemed to get a gigantic kick out of that every time he pointed it out.
"Helps if you get them onto those trays first," Steve said and nodded to the empty sheets stacked on the stovetop.
to want to tap that."
"Yeah, I don't even
Though Tony appreciated her gesture, he couldn't help but feel she was doing nothing but humoring him because of the situation at-hand, and he was assured of this when she put her hands on his shoulders and said, "I know it's— I know it isn't easy, but I want you to do something for me, OK?" When he nodded, she continued, "Just focus on having that baby. Just focus on having that baby, and we'll worry about everything else later, all right? No sense worrying about— One thing at a time. Focus on having the baby, and we'll worry about everything else afterward."
But Tony pulled back, almost like he needed to make his announcement without leaning on Steve, and he said, "I don't... I'm not sure... We can't do it anymore."
"Uh, who else?" Bucky asked, and Steve glanced at Tony, who glanced back up at him. Both Bucky and Sam seemed to catch the motion, as they next glanced to each other before they turned back to Steve and Tony, more hesitant and cautious than before.
Somewhere during his rounds, Tony and the others had left, which he was happily informed of when he got back to the desk, and his heart sank a little when he realized Tony had left without finalizing anything with him, his query to Sam of whether or not Tony had left any messages for him answered with a shrug and a, "Sorry, man."
“It might be the only thing that gets through to you,” he replied and gave Stark a hard shove in the direction of a worktable.
is what I'm talking about! I know you kinda get off on it, but you've got to stop this bullshit — this heading headlong into disaster bullshit. People are going to start to think you're suicidal, Steve."
, I guess is the word? Let's just say the number of my actual conquests has been greatly exaggerated."
Tony hummed and said, "Not unless I sneak down to wherever you are."
"Sure, if I only ever want my daughter to aim as high as 'barista at Starbucks' for a career choice."
"I fear for what he might use the scepter," Thor said, piling his bagel with deli meats and cheeses he'd pulled from the fridge. "Even Loki knew not what power it possessed. I fear for what trouble a mere mortal may cause with it."
Clearly the very idea of what was happening to him, what was in him, disgusted Steve. To be fair, he wasn't all that happy about it himself, but there wasn't much he could do at the moment, and he'd thought Steve, at the least, would be able to understand that there wasn't anything he could do about it. He hadn't asked for this. Hell, even he could admit it creeped him out a bit.
"Well, I know that now," Tony said and went back to rolling out the dough. "At the time, I just wasn't prepared for how...well, kinky you could be. It was kind of a surprise. Not a bad surprise just...a surprise. For someone that only learned what I knew about you from movies and books and...certain parental figures that shall remain nameless...yeah, definitely wasn't covered in any of those books just how much of a kinky little sex pervert Steve Rogers really could be."
“OK, first of all, you don’t want me using your title when we 'do that'—” he used finger quotes on the words, “—maybe we don’t play pissed-off-captain-fucks-his-cocky-teammate-into- submission.”
white." He shook his head. "Doesn't make any sense."
But the woman grinned at Tony, her eyes lighting up in delight and intrigue as she kept hold of Tony's hand. "So
He stretched his back out some then bent down to grab the suit by the legs, and Barton made a hesitant sound and said, "Uh, Stark? Maybe you shouldn't do that?"
I could marry Natasha Carbonell."
Christ, you could take the man out of the Depression…
Stark. Naked. He couldn't tell if that was genius or the dumbest crack he'd ever made.
"Seriously?" Tony asked.
hard. He blinked, panted out two heavy breaths, then said, "Why, you—" and took exactly three steps over to him.
"I promise," Steve said and rolled his eyes, now sitting on the edge of the cushion with his elbows resting on his knees.
I would think it would be the other way around."
"Tony, this has nothing to do with you being a woman."
"Yeah, uh, your scale needs to be recalibrated," he said and pointed to the number it had spit out. No fucking way was he a hundred and fifty-seven pounds!
Tony just sniffed. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said to Natasha's knowing smirk, and they both went quiet for a moment before he shook his head a little and said, "I can't do it. I can't do it without him."
"It's not that," he said, keeping his eyes squeezed shut. "I trust you more than I trust me, that's for sure."
"What?"
Steve looked to Natasha, who he figured to be the only one in the room that could actually give him the right story. She looked up at him, her face bland, but there was a look in her eyes that spoke to the idiotic nature of his two friends, and she said, "They have to learn how to share."
Tony stared at the tiny infant cradled in Steve's arm, her eyes focused up on Steve, who was smiling down at her as she slurped on her afternoon bottle. Tony watched father and daughter a moment longer then squinted his eyes as he tried to see, tried to find the similarities, tried to make the comparison between the infant cradled in Steve's arm and the little firebrand that had stumbled into his workshop once upon a time.
"It wasn't so much the initial hit as the fight he got into afterward," Natasha added, and Tony groaned and rolled his eyes.
She shrugged. "That's it."
He set the phone back down on the table and stretched out, and he lay there a few more moments and thought about waiting there until Steve got home and then making Steve sit on the coffee table and just feed him right where he was. But that would mean the potential for jelly and powdered sugar all over the couch and the carpet, and he groaned out the rest of his sleep and struggled to sit up, glaring down at his abdomen and wondering how much worse this could possibly get.
"Tony," Bruce called from where he still sat in front of him, "do you have a preference for who you want to cut the umbilical cord?"
"Are you humoring me? I
Steve shrugged again, concentration focused on the steady flow of red taillights ahead of him. "I don't know. I just do. Maybe it's just got more of a tune than those other ones you've forced me to listen to." He shook his head a little and added, "Music today just doesn't… It doesn't have rhythm. It doesn't have a tune. It's… It's
Natasha smiled at him, and she reached up and pushed a stray hair that had come out of the twist she'd done for him back into place. "It looks OK," she replied. "She's a bitch, but clearly she's a damned good designer. Why don't you go see for yourself?" She glanced at her watch and said, "I have to go round up the others."
"Are you sure?"
"Oh, you know, logically I know you're still our Shellhead, but it's kind of funny hearing you talk about yourself being a 'boyfriend' with that voice and that, uh, body."
"Low? It's not even noon!"
"Yeah, well," Steve said with a slight shrug as he held Tony in his arms and began to sway with him ever so gently to the soft tune that surrounded them, dipping his head slightly so he could press his cheek to Tony's.
think to bring me back anything?"
But this time was different. He could tell from the way Steve was talking that something was different about his interactions with Barnes this time, like there was a familiarity there, like Barnes maybe — just maybe — knew him. Recognized him. Was aware of who he really was.
"Yeah, thanks." He patted Steve's bicep. "I really feel the love there, honey."
Contrary to the shit Steve had pulled for his birthday, Tony made sure Steve and everyone knew what he was planning for Steve's birthday. Steve had the fortune of being born on one of the absolute best days in the American calendar to celebrate a birthday: July fourth, Independence Day. It was a day made for celebrations: grilling, fireworks, gaudy decorations. Steve wasn't one for making a big deal out of his birthday, but for the shit he pulled back with Tony's, the son-of-a-bitch was lucky if Tony didn't organize a fucking ticker-tape parade in his honor.
indebted to you now."
"That's not exactly how it works," Steve said, almost like he was trying to soften Tony's words for the others.
"Hey!" he said, brightly, deliberately trying to change the subject. "Let's go pilfer some of Daddy's art supplies!"
name is 'Tony'?" he asked as Steve stared the car and pulled out of the spot.
because that's what he wants — that's what he's always wanted."
He wasn't sure whether this was a dream or reality, but he said a silent prayer for it to be real, and he said another prayer that he might have just a little more time here to figure things out. Not just a day (if that's what this was) but…but just a little longer. He hadn't learned everything he was supposed to learn, he didn't think, and he wasn't ready to let it go. Not just yet.
Steve just gave a slight shake of his head and stabbed a sausage link. "It's not going to be easy."
"Am I really Tony Stark?" he finished for her, knowing without even having to look that there were other interested parties paying particular attention to their conversation.
Steve nodded and did as he was asked, and Tony looked at her and said, "Uh, there a chance people might try to come in or—?"
Natasha remained silent on that, and Tony let her fingers work their magic as they trailed up to his neck. He let his head dip forward some, and as she kneaded her fingers in, he muttered, "I look like Peggy."
"He's nervous," Steve said, back to having his arms folded.
"Seriously?" Tony asked and took another bite of his burger.
Tony nodded, parsing his words for what he was really saying, before he said, "You're saying I'm too fat to go to the beach."
But he bypassed the guy and made it a few steps before some weird sixth sense came over him, and he realized there was someone following him. He turned back around to see the Long Island Lothario following about two steps behind. He grinned at him and said, "Well, I guess we're going the same direction."
Contraction. Because he was in labor. Because he was pregnant. With the child of Captain America. Even one-year-ago-Tony would never have believed that.
Tony had insisted that it wasn't a real checkup unless he was covered only by a thin paper smock, but Bruce said there was no reason for him to get undressed and he could do whatever examinations and run whatever tests he needed while Tony was fully clothed.
Steve just nodded his understanding then said, "Never had Chinese for Christmas dinner before." Tony hummed in thought and said, "Well, you're not Jewish."
He got up to his bedroom and walked in, forgetting that he hadn't dared set foot in it since Pepper had been up here to pack a bag, and he went over to the bed and dropped Olivia down in the middle of it, and she laughed and bounced a little and ran her hands over the duvet and said, "Papa, d'ja get a new bed cover?"
Tony folded his arms, nestling them just beneath his breasts. "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm average."
"—but don't think I'm some goody-two-shoes choir boy that never did a bad thing in his life," the Cap said, steamrolling right over his words and evidently not even hearing that Tony had used his actual, given name for the first time in their relatively short acquaintance. "I was a poor kid from Brooklyn. We never had that much money even before the Depression. Sometimes, you had to do what you had to do in order to get by, if you get my drift."
. Contrary to popular belief, I am not the horrible brute I make myself out to be. He may just be…traumatized…by what he saw."
Esmeralda grinned at this.
"Yeah."
Pepper's eyes went wide, not with horror but awe. "Is it… Is it moving?"
"It's only a can of Coke," she said and sat down on the ottoman, setting the kit beside her. "It's not going to kill you."
"Sickeningly-happy couples are probably the most disgusting couples of all," Bucky said and Sam snorted a laugh in agreement.
He pulled the bottle out of the fridge and closed the door with his elbow. "Baby girl," he said and went over to the bowl of gravel, "you tell anyone about this, and I'll disown you."
Tony tilted his head from side-to-side and shrugged some. "Sometimes. It's hard to explain without spoiling too much. Let's just say we have this place, and we have a place in the city, too."
"Maybe. Or maybe deep down you know he wasn't the one that did it. You know he was just as much a victim of circumstance as anyone."
"Hey, I don't have pregnancy—"
"I find women attractive, too, Tony."
Because he knew through it all that that asshole Barton was right. He was Steve's princess. He had Steve wrapped around his finger, and whatever baby wanted, baby got. Maybe Steve idealized him or revered him too much — maybe he put him on too much of a pedestal — but he hoped that if there ever came a time that he suffered a fall from grace that Steve would still be standing there when the dust settled, ready, willing, and able to help him back up and brush the dirt off.
"You've had your share of breakouts."
He glanced at them a moment before he looked to Steve for explanation, and Steve shrugged and said, "I told you. I wanted it to be a surprise."
Tony held his breath and waited for Steve to leave, and once he heard Steve began to walk down the steps, he exhaled the breath and stepped out from behind the door, rolling his eyes and scowling at himself.
He blew out a couple breaths, and once the pain had subsided again, he exhaled and dropped his head some.
"Nothing," she said, continuing to glare at Bruce, who looked humbled and a little frightened as he said, "I'm sorry. I thought he knew. You were watching the newsfeed up here and—"
"Or Tony could have the baby right after he leaves."
Tony closed his eyes, his arms out at his sides, and he took a deep inhale of breath as he felt Esmeralda's finger touch his lips. The feeling was almost familiar now, a wave of shock of and heat flooding his body, and he felt himself go weightless before, next thing he knew, he was on his back looking up at the ceiling, Esmeralda and Steve standing above him looking down.
Other Tony shot a pointed look at him, and Tony's theory deflated just a little. "Oh."
" he snapped as he pulled out a bandage roll and wrapped it around his hand to stem the bleeding. He should have disinfected first, but fuck it.
But unless he'd just been had — which was always a possibility — the gulf between them would grow no longer. Yes, he was sacrificing a lot of things for this, but the very thought of staying young while he watched his family grow old and die before him was something he just couldn't bear to entertain. So, maybe it was selfish of him, and maybe — no matter what Esmeralda said — he did still owe a debt to those that had done this for him, but he wasn't an automaton. He wasn't a machine. Maybe he had been created as a weapon, but he was a human with feelings and wants and desires. He was a man that had been alone for far too long and was terrified of being left alone once again. He had never really meant for the Army — for Captain America — to be a permanent thing for him. There was a war on, and he had signed up to do his part. Maybe he would have stayed in after all was said and done — made a career of it — but that had never been his intention going into it, and he wasn't sure that he would have even kept up the 'Captain America' mantle after the war. He would have just gone back to being Captain Steven Rogers. Maybe a major. Maybe a colonel. Hell, maybe they'd make him some one- or two-star general. But 'Captain America' was never meant to be permanent. It was never meant to last beyond the war.
"Trust me, kewpie doll, I thought I
"Well, it was a stupid dream that has no basis in reality. Hydra wants either of us, they're going to have a fight on their hands, and I've been known to play dirty."
Nope. Wasn't the life he wanted at all.
And then, this face clouded some.
Steve took one last look at Olivia to make sure she didn't hurt herself, and satisfied at the happy babbling he heard from somewhere inside the pile, he turned back to Tony.
Now, that was probably a sight to see. Maybe, if he ever got to meet his alternate-universe self, he could ask him for pictures. He had to have one on standby, right? Tony would if he was in that situation.
Steve shook his head a little and began to glance at the menu. "Well, thank you for the effort."
Tony shrugged and extended his arm back down over the arm of the couch again. "I'm sure I can think of something you could do."
"Natasha?" Steve suggested. "I mean Black Widow Natasha, not your alter-ego."
"Do you?"
at the door when he added, "Ugh, tastes like motor oil, too—
He took another sip of coffee, and Steve watched him and said, "But we're married? I mean,
JARVIS didn't respond to that, instead preferring to strike up the seasonal tunes with Bing Crosby's version of 'White Christmas' — the remake he'd done after the war, not the one Steve had spent the war holiday seasons listening to. It was close, but not quite the same, and honestly, Steve preferred the original version. Not because it was the one that reminded him of the past but because he just thought it was better.
"Yeah, but I really feel like I'm being discriminated against and being forced to jump through more hoops than, well,
Steve turned, and sure enough, there was what looked to be a pair of white sweat socks tucked into a pair of tan boots. He grabbed them and put them on, telling Tony a sincere, "Thank you," as he laced them up.
that she's my daughter. I
"Sorry," he muttered then added, "just…Steve was always kind of a…sickly…sort. He used to talk about wanting kids, but he was the sort of fella… I just wasn't sure he'd actually ever be able to have 'em, you know what I mean?"
"Ah…I see. So, if I maybe reached over and ran my hand down—"
Tony leaned a hip against the table and folded his arms. "You're going to read more pregnancy articles, aren't you?"
"Whatever," he muttered and stabbed at the food on his plate. "I guess one of my suits then. I don't know. Think there's one I can make work. Have to see about a shirt. Red's a good color to get married in, right?"
He stifled a groan and stretched his back to work out some of the aches and kinks before he took her hand and led her over to the door.
"Yeah, he was a nice guy."
OK, things go a
He marched over to the elevator to meet up with Natasha, and she shrugged a little and said, "You get used to it," as she hit the button.
the cab with the guy instead of just apologizing to him. Surely, that was something they did back in his day.
Esmeralda merely directed her attention down to the baby cradled in Tony's arms. "She is quite beautiful, isn't she? Just like her mother."
As Bruce muttered something about that not being a visual he needed, Natasha smiled down at Tony and said, "Oh, I think there's more to it than that." She reached down and grabbed hold of his arm to pull him upright. "Come on, Shellhead. I'll whip you up a nice cup of chamomile and then you can go sleep it off for a little while."
for him to undergo it — and so maybe there was something a little 'amazing' about that?
"It doesn't," he replied, his voice sounding feeble even to his own ear, and Tony held out a couple towels to him.
option.
He just nodded and decided to change the subject to something a little less bone-chilling. This probably wasn't the last time he'd have to worry about Hydra getting their disgusting mitts on either one of them, but that was a worry for another day.
Cap, but the Cap that he knew — and so he instead asked "Said you'll be gone yet another week, right?"
more sense.
He winced away from her just the slightest. "Why?"
, if what he was saying was true, and there was a part of him, a very small part, that wanted to believe—
"What if you were all he'd ever wanted?"
"Tony, where is this coming from? Where are you getting this? Did someone say something—"
she's mine. I
Tony twitched his mouth back and forth and hummed in thought. "Yeah, sure,
— into his arms and shush him and promise he'd make it all better, but Tony wrenched away from him, and Steve saw that the wetness on his face wasn't just from the rainwater.
Steve just shrugged a little but wouldn't meet his gaze.
"No," Bucky said and grumbled as he slapped Sam's twenty bucks into his waiting palm. "But you're a fucking idiot. He said go out with him. You said you had to work. He asked what time you get off."
"She's a 'Rogers,' too," Steve said pointedly and, to shore up his response, reached in and picked the baby up from the highchair to sit her on his lap, cooing at her and bumping the tip of his nose against her cheek as he did so.
He motioned over to the TV at that, which was continuing to air images from the previous night's Foundation gala event alongside various talking heads and 'expert commentators' giving their two-cents' worth as they debated whether or not Tony Stark or Natasha Carbonell had been at the event last night and, no matter which one it was, just how cute were she and Captain America together?
Tony whined a little and sat back down.
Tony took that time to get dressed, selecting not a comfortable pair of pajamas but an arc reactor blue teddy with cream-colored trim and tiny bows that he'd got when Natasha and Hill had taken him shopping for his wedding (they'd insisted on lingerie as well). He wasn't sure why. He didn't have to entice Steve any longer; no, he realized as he moved a little and felt the ache of well-used and abused muscles in his ass and snatch — ugh, maybe it was best to stick with 'pussy' — that were going to be feeling what Steve did to him for
Steve laughed some and complied. "All right," he said and literally wiped a hand over his face. "How's this?" he asked and gave Tony the look that had always gotten him out of trouble as a boy — the one that had always gotten people to take pity on him whether he wanted them to or not: the big, sad-eyed look with the slight frown and the pouty bottom lip. Tony glanced at him and then muttered a low, "I hate you."
joke about anything like that."
Steve just shook his head and clutched a little tighter to the robot in his hands. "That's not the version I know. That damned song is everywhere. I hear it in my sleep. That's not the version I know."
"That's not— What? No, that's— That's not the only reason we're getting married, all right? We're engaged. We've been engaged. We're just…speeding up the process a little bit. And, look, isn't that a little stupid and old-fashioned and superstitious not to let us spend the night with each other?"
different from what I was before."
Steve made a motion as though to ask where he would even go, and Tony went into the foyer and up the stairs.
She made a face like she wasn't quite sure what to say, and Tony said, "How 'bout just 'Tony,' seeing as that's still my name? I know that's not the name I booked it under, but, whatever."
Tony nearly choked. "She
"He needs me, Tony. He—"
"Yeah, well, it's not like we're going to need the girl's name anyway. I think it's more important that we agree on a boy's name."
"Maybe we could try that here?" Steve said with a shrug, a somewhat hopeful tone in his voice. Tony met his eyes, and he smiled a little in return.
Tony went in for the kill.
"We are
He turned and began to make his way toward the elevator. "Where are you going?" Steve called out to him.
"Yes," he said and scooped the baby back into his arms. "I do. Incidentally, how did you manage that?"
Oh, god. Wait— No. No, that wasn't possible, right? Steve wouldn't make some crazy pact with some religious cult just so he could get Bucky back, right? And he sure as fuck wouldn't stick
"At you. Which brings me back to my point. The way Steve looks at you versus the way Steve looks at everything else."
"So, wait," one of the guys in the crowd said, "is it true you're a woman now, like, permanently?"
"Are you implying something by that?" he asked, one eyebrow raised in less question and more a challenge.
hanging around here? No runs. No going for runs."
Damn it, now why had he gone and said that?
I've had JARVIS run the security feed for the hour before she showed up. Nothing. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary until that…thing…opens and she shows up in the lab. But yet, she doesn't know who JARVIS is. She keeps talking about something called 'Friday,' she's naming people we've never even heard of—"
Though there was probably some element of jealousy involved.
"It's about time, don't you think?"
"Papa, where's Unca Rhodey goin'?"
But Steve just sighed and murmured a somewhat sad, "
"Yeah," she said like she was familiar with the place. "Have you heard from him?"
He let out a sharp breath, his gaze cast to the floor beneath him, one hand on his hip and the other resting against the back of his neck. "I mean, if— if the offer still stands."
ten pounds—?"
Tony exhaled a breath and thought about this a moment. "David Welch?" he said, giving the name of the old buzzard that had been a thorn in the Avengers' collective side since Day One. Tony hadn't paid attention to the old bastard too much — the rants of an old, senile former-hippy-turned-fervent-Reaganite didn't really rate high on must-read list — but he was well aware of the fact that he was out there poisoning the discourse, leading a one-man crusade for the Avengers' apprehension and permanent detention, preferably somewhere dark and dank.
Cap just shot him a flat look. "No, you're right. The Hydra weapons from the war, the Red Skull, the Tesseract, waking up seventy years in the future, Loki, the Chitauri… That makes sense. Nothing strange about any of that. Meeting an alternate universe version of myself?" He exhaled a heavy breath. "Yeah, don't know if I'd be able to handle that. Might be just a little much for this old soldier to take."
"What?"
"Was that before or after we watched
Tony met his gaze a moment before he shrugged and said, "To a point. He's not JARVIS, but then, JARVIS doesn't have a physical body like DUM-E has, so…"
Steve felt the bottom fall out of his stomach, and the pointer on the mouse shook as he tried to maneuver it over the link to click. He didn't know why it should bother him. It had been years since he'd last seen Tony, and he wouldn't exactly say their breakup had been amicable, but some stupid little voice in the back of his head had urged him time and again not to let his torch burn out. They were young and dumb and things could change for the better.
"Babe?" he murmured, and Steve turned and looked directly at the lighted eye-slits of the suit, crystalline blue irises lined with pain and grief.
"You."
"You saw what happened to Tony," Steve explained to him. "You really doubt powers like this exist in this universe?"
"Anyway," he said, "point is, I felt like I knew you from the start. Maybe, if I really think about it, it was like we were picking up where we left off. If there's anything to what that screwball says about soul mates and, if I was listening to her and Thor correctly, reincarnation, then, well… Maybe we're more stuck with each other than we originally thought?"
"Seems to be. Guess he never got over Steve the same as Steve never got over him."
"By what? Look, it's not like we haven't done this before—"
"Might not have a choice," Steve replied, tapping the tip of the knife against his plate in nervous thought. "Might have to be OK with it even if I'm not."
"I have," Steve replied, hitting the button on the side to mute the sound. "Someone keeps changing it back."
Bruce murmured to Natasha, who just shrugged.
Steve set the tablet down on the bedside table and rubbed his hand against Tony's belly. "I had a feeling you would. Besides, I'm not… I'm not saying it
"It's alphabetical that way."
"Tony!" Steve cried, not because it was too exorbitant an amount of money but because he knew Tony was just showing off.
"It's a breast, Steve," Tony said as he threaded his arms into the gown. "You should know what they look like. You've fondled mine enough."
"Because that would mean they got their hands on you," he said in a quiet voice, "and I would die before I let that happen to you."
"How's it going for you?"
, but maybe, in the far reaches in the back of his mind he'd kind of
"No, I guess—
"Goddamned sap," he muttered and went about getting dressed.
Tony shrugged. "A lot of babies subsist on it. Don't hear them complaining."
"What if that's what she wants to do with her life?" Steve asked.
She just blinked. "Of course not. The conception has already occurred."
"It was Pepsi-Cola back in my day. The cheap stuff," Steve explained, in no way defending himself from Tony's accusations. "Coca-Cola was the good stuff. That's what we'd get in the army. Just doesn't taste the same way now. Even the real sugar Pepsi-Cola doesn't taste the same as I remember it, but I don't like that high-fructose corn syrup. It gives it a funny flavor."
"You shouldn't have to get used to it," Steve said with a curt shake of his head. "This should— It should always be your choice, Tony. It shouldn't be something forced on you."
, and in many cases, you can continue to have sex right up until the baby is born, so long as there aren't any complications. Have you noticed any complications? Any irregular bleeding? Any pain?"
Steve arched an eyebrow at him. "Really? After all this—?"
Tony flattened his mouth and tilted his head at Thor as though to say,
"No?" Barton asked, his comment echoed by several of the others.
Tony dropped his arm and smiled proudly at the picture their little infant made in her outfit, and Steve hesitated a moment then said, "But what if she doesn't want—"
leaned into Steve's side, and the fluttering subsided again just as Rhodey asked, "You going to let us all get in on that or are you playing favorites?"
"OK. Then we figure out a way to put this right."
She turned back to her phone and continued to type something, her thumbs slamming against the screen like she was trying to take her frustrations out on her phone.
"It's not completely fictional," he countered. "They got some stuff right."
"I was in the army, Tony. I know my way around vulgarities and four-letter words."
I could wear something a little more
, I just lost you."
"Yeah, yeah," he muttered with a breezy wave of his hand and made to climb into the driver's seat but was stopped by Steve's hands on his arms. He cleared his throat and arched an eyebrow and said from behind rose-tinted sunglasses, "
"What?"
But Tony put a hand up to silence him and said, "Don't worry about it," nestling the baby closer to try and comfort her through her tears.
Damn it, he'd been doing fine until Sam and Clint had led him astray!
"No," Sam said, arms folded as he shrugged. "Just saying I don't get why you'd give your kid to an old girlfriend."
Rhodey just shook his head, and Tony quirked his head a little and said, "No, I changed my mind. I'm going with Sly and the Family Stone."
"Don't worry," he told Steve, "she doesn't hold a candle to you. You're still my favorite fondler." "Thanks," Steve said, flat but amused all the same.
what's happened to you, but have you
Of course, by the time Steve finally finished and was comfortable with the job he'd done, Tony had to pee again, and he grumbled and fumbled with the dress then sighed and looked at Steve and said, "Help me."
a little more than he thought it would. Actually, he hadn't thought it would hurt at all.
He grinned up at Tony, so proud of his achievement, and Tony could do nothing but shake his head and sigh out a breath.
"I overheard Stane tell you that no one wanted some 'fag freak' running the company and how he couldn't believe that someone with my debts wasn't with you just for the money. I know you always trusted Stane, you looked up to him, and I noticed after that that you…seemed a little closed-off to me, like you were trying to figure out if maybe he was right. I didn't ever want you to think there was even a possibility that he could be, and so I…"
"Well, you're Steve's best pal."
indicated she was a native to somewhere in the tri-state area) before she pulled away and then frowned as she glanced around.
"Thanks," he muttered and then startled a bit as Thor carried him back over to Tony.
Tony's smile faltered ever so slightly. "Yeah," he said, his voice clipped. "Sure."
Instead, he focused wholly on the situation — one he could control — at hand. He made to pull Tony’s jeans up for him, but Tony slapped his hands away, hissing as he pulled them up. He left them unbuttoned and unzipped, the tight material of the denim resting over his hips. There was no way he was getting them closed at that moment, and Steve thought about getting him off right then and there to spare him the agony, but he was pretty sure a responsible parent would tend to his child-in-need first.
, he supposed.
been dead. He'd been very happily dead, frozen and buried in his cold, dark grave like he should have been from the moment he'd been born.
"I don't even think Cher can turn back time," Natasha said then stopped cold in the middle of shaping Tony's nails and looked up at him. "That sounds like one of your references."
"Even if we got confirmation from Clint that they found him?"
. Or something like that. Whatever. Thor always spoke in flowery and poetic verse-type shit.
"Perhaps an heir is not fated to be," the witch said.
"Because he does," Natasha said, but there was no judgment behind the words. Just truth. "Because he spoils you."
Thor frowned a bit. "Perhaps they did favor one of us over the other, and Loki did feel himself to be slighted in affections from both Father and Mother."
difficult to explain Natasha Carbonell's attendance to the other attendees, especially given the rampant media speculation about her and Steve and what their relationship was doing to the Avengers.
"The serum?" he asked, hoping they might reveal their entire evil plan to him because why the hell not?
"Nothing ever happened. Honest. Bucky practically grilled Clint about it before he got up the nerve to ask Nat out. He didn't want there to be anything 'weird' between them, but Clint insisted he and Nat were just friends. Nothing beyond that."
"Look, we don't know where she actually comes from. For all we know, she was purposely sent here. Maybe where she comes from is terrible—"
And that baby was going to know it was loved and wanted and appreciated. Whatever happened with Steve — God, he didn't even want to think about that son-of-a-bitch at the moment — this child was only ever going to know love and security. This baby would know he loved him as much as he knew his own mother had loved him. There would never be any doubt in his mind.
Tony pursed his lips a little before he chugged the remainder of his coffee and set the mug back on the table. "So, she came here all the way from her…seashell or wherever the hell she lives because she thinks I'm bonded to Steve?"
He stepped in and was greeted with the sounds of babbling and rustling, and he could only think,
"Now, I've been having a hell of a time keeping my emotions in check since, oh, last December, really, so what do
(Steve, unsurprisingly, enjoyed that last one maybe even more than he did.)
the institution of marriage, he didn't know what was. And since when the hell was Barton of any use in a kitchen?
much? That implies you remember something."
Steve's dopey smile was contagious, and Tony found he couldn't help but return it in kind, even as the elevator finally opened its doors, and Steve took him gently and ushered him onto the elevator, Barton, Thor, and the Iron Man armor crowding in with them.
"Did anyone ask you?"
"Full house," he muttered under his breath and made his way to the elevator. He let JARVIS take him down to the communal floor, and he stepped into a heated and hushed discussion that immediately ceased as soon as his presence was felt. All eyes present turned toward him, and he felt judged for only a second before Barton said in a somewhat teasing voice, "So. What'd you and the Cap fight about this time?"
He shrugged. "I don't know—"
That might have caused a goddamned uproar.
"Not bad," Steve said with a shrug. "Haven't seen him in a while. There was some talk about him buying a farm —
Steve sighed out a, "
"You tell anyone about this and I will put you up for sale on Craigslist."
"According to her, my life is tied up in the life of this clump of cells growing in my abdomen. The clump of cells lives, I live; the clump of cells dies, I—"
Tony rolled his eyes and swallowed the bite. "Look, can we drop the whole me-and-Cap talk?" He grabbed a shitty paper napkin and wiped the grease from his fingers and chin. "Maybe alternate universe me was that desperate for a ring, but I like to think I have more taste than that."
Steve could be
"Look," Tony said and set his fork down. "What are we going to do? Come out and say Cap and Natasha are just really good friends? Which isn't
He smiled at him, and Steve exhaled a breath and said, "You really didn't have to go to all this trouble, you know."
She beamed up at him, eyes wide and innocent and shining with love, and Tony just shook his head some. Seriously, that Cap and Tony were pathetic.
"Not entirely. I meant it— I
Tony shrugged. "I don't know. Bonding-thing, I guess. You seem like the type of guy to want the wife and two-point-five kids and dog and house with little white fence."
After restraining the downed agent, they parted ways, Barnes telling him to get his goddamned ass back to the penthouse while Tony blew him off and said not until the threat was contained.
"Is she the only one? I mean, you said there's another couple on the team. Do they…?"
"You mean the finger quotes?"
Natasha nodded her agreement, and even Bruce seemed to indicate that he found Wilson and Barnes' strange dick-measuring contest to be of some amusement to him.
of what he'd done, but at least it had been by his choice, and at least he'd had a dick at the time.
"I'm a hundred percent sure those words actually came out of
"He's right," Hill said, still standing at Steve's elbow. "As far as they know, Tony Stark disappeared several months ago and Steve Rogers has been seen around town —
"I know lots of things," he said with an easy shrug.
Natasha went up on her toes and kissed his cheek and said, "Happy Birthday,
"It's the principle of the thing."
"Long story," Tony said with a blasé shrug.
to take a nap.
He groaned out the rest of his sleep — goddamn it, he had fallen asleep, hadn't he? — and sat up, and he stretched and said, "J? What time is it?"
Steve reached up and scratched at the back of his head. "I mean, I could probably go again but I thought you said you needed to rest—"
"Fucking amazing," Tony finally said once the song began to fade out and was replaced by another one.
, Steve?"
"Chances are they're already far ahead of whatever we could even begin to counteract," Hill said. "Our best bet might be to let the next two fall and try to head them off at the third."
and doesn't seem to have a filter. We kiss a lot around her. She thinks it's gross."
until you two are married," Barton grumbled, but Tony ignored him to continue his point.
Steve shook his head quickly and swallowed again. "No,
"Seriously," Steve said after the staff had left them alone again, "you didn't have to do this. We didn't need—"
Steve remained silent, not deigning to move a muscle, so Tony dropped his hands from the child's head and continued.
"You did not give me the idea to buy it."
"Doesn't mean he's right," Tony muttered before he turned back to them. "And why in the hell do you think I'd actually
"Look, you run your little tests. I'm gonna go look for something to eat because, holy shit, I don't know if I'm weak from hunger or blood loss—"
He fought to get up and then sighed a little when he saw nothing had been disturbed. Steve probably hadn't even come to check on him, and he grumbled and struggled to his feet and rubbed his belly some more. His stomach growled, and realizing he hadn't eaten since breakfast, he quietly made his way out of the bedroom so not as to disturb Steve and Barnes too much in their trip down memory lane.
He hadn't even thought about it before, but now that he was aware, it really hurt that Pepper wasn't going to make it. Sure, there was the history between them, but they were friends first and foremost, and he totally wanted her there for his big day.
He gasped a little, struggling to get oxygen in. He put a hand to his chest and gasped a few more times, and it was only after he felt Pepper's hands on his face that he realized he'd begun to panic, unable to breathe, unable to think — fuck, it was like those attacks he used to get right after New York, when he couldn't even
Tony scoffed.
Magazine," he grumbled.
He hadn't. He was just assuming as much because…because he had to believe that if this sequence matched exactly, then that meant that this Olivia was that Olivia. There was no possible way that an alternate universe would produce the same exact results. Similar, maybe, but not exact.
. Natasha Carbonell."
"Different strokes," Tony said with a shrug, and Steve considered this a moment.
OK, maybe it was time to let the brat go.
"Forget building a suit in a cave," Steve said. "That's impressive."
"You probably know how I'm gonna die."
because they wouldn't let us see each other until we got married. It was actually kind of nice not having to share the bed with a blanket hog."
But Steve shook his head a little, gaze still focused on the road ahead of him. "I still didn't— You didn't ask anything— It was nothing— It wasn't like us."
"Doesn't have to have been," Tony said breezily. "Could've been an ex or maybe a boyfriend no one knew about."
— looking like Captain America and the mysterious brunette he'd been seen around town with over the course of the past couple months? The one the media was already speculating was pregnant with his child?
He stared at the radio another moment and listened to the stupid thing before he shook his head and went over to the tree. He found the ornaments Tony had talked about earlier — the ones that were made up to look like what he presumed were the Avengers. There was a green one that matched the plush toy Olivia had gotten; another one that had sort of a winged helmet; another one with red hair in a black suit; another one with a quiver on his back; one with auburn hair and dressed in red; another one that was…kind of green and yellow; one that had a black mask and what almost looked like it was supposed to be a metal arm; another one with red wings; and a gray one that kind of looked like that Iron Man he'd seen.
the crazy son-of-a-bitch was still alive.
Steve laughed but said, "Oh? You don't look like you partake in anything but blended grass smoothies."
"Yes, you can," Natasha said. "If anyone can do this, you can."
"Yeah, that's kind of what formula already is. But maybe Brucie and I can unlock the secret to what
She put a hand to her mouth as horror dawned over her.
Tony burst out laughing like he'd just heard the funniest thing in the world, and Steve waited for him to calm down before he added, "I might not say it
Wilson snorted a laugh. "Yeah, I am."
"No, honey, of course you're not. You're brooding manfully into it."
He'd just squeezed his eyes shut, tears threatening to fall through, when the drums started. A march beat on snares. What sounded like an organ. English voices — or voices speaking English, anyway. His eyes still closed, he frowned and raised an eyebrow as he listened.
. I didn't mean
Steve didn’t bat an eyelash. “If that’s what it takes.”
"Thought we already established this, but yeah, it's Steve's."
"Oh, don't even pretend to look horrified at the very thought. Here, lemme paint a picture for you." He grinned a little and leaned closer. "You, putting a collar on your boy, Tony."
Tony Stark — is on life support after he tried to kill himself because Captain America was cheating on him with Jabba the Slut."
"God, you're so debauched," Tony murmured as they broke away, saliva and come on their lips. "Everyone thinks I'm the pervert. No one ever believed it was you."
"Bruce is full of shit!" he cried then clamped his mouth shut and sank back into the seat some as the driver glanced at him in the rear view mirror.
She smiled a little and stepped closer, and Tony cradled the baby closer and turned slightly so as to shield her from the nut that had
He gritted his teeth at him in a fierce smile, and, not wanting to cause any problems, said, "Excuse me. I'm trying to get back to my friends."
"If you want it, it's yours for the taking," Rhodey said. "Don't be that guy, Tony. Don't let your pride sabotage something that clearly makes you happy."
Tony just sighed. "Whatever. Where do I go for this shit? Can I just have JARVIS do it and send it to you?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "Not 'Jarbus,' you idiot. JARVIS. He runs the building. Hey, J?"
"I'm just saying, I mean, is he
Steve gave Tony a pat on the back and said, "Coming right up," before he went over to the fridge and pulled the carton out. Tony stuck a few slices of bread in the toaster then sat back down at the island.
"I don't think you understand how pregna—
"Hydra agents are scaling the building."
But why did he have this weird gut feeling like Steve was going to have to make a choice between them? And why, dear god, did a little voice in the back of his head assure him that if it came down to that, Tony might not be the one Steve would choose?
Cap simply nodded and scuffed one booted foot against the floor. "You know, you never answered my question."
Steve smiled, and he leaned over and pressed a gentle kiss against Tony's lips. Tony returned the kiss in kind before Steve pulled away again.
"Yeah, I don't know if I buy that. When the fella-slash-gal you've just made love to starts giggling at the end—"
. 'Roark' sounds like the kind of noise you'd make into a toilet after a weekend bender."
Tony motioned at him. "Which clearly means that she hasn't."
"It'll go by in a flash. Trust me."
“If I fuck you on command, it completely defeats the purpose of what I’m trying to do here. You’re an Avenger whether you like it or not. You have to learn to behave like you’re part of a team.”
Olivia huffed and rolled her eyes. "Yes, you do."
Steve was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that he could openly talk about something like this and not have to worry about looking over his shoulder for a cop or an MP or someone that could report him to some higher authority.
"What? That I want kids and Pep doesn't? Or that Pep wants kids but I don't?"
"No, I'm not, and no, it doesn't!"
So a pump-and-grind on a hot, sweaty, poorly-lit dance floor to music that was making his ears bleed was not exactly the sort of thing he'd call 'fun.' Not anymore. But he still grit his teeth and tried to pretend he was into it as his 'dance partner' pushed close to him, grinding their bodies together as he pushed his dick into Tony's hip. Clearly the guy was trying to entice him, show off to him, make him want to take that in him any way he could get it, but he'd had a semi-erect dick pushed into his hip not all that long ago, and this one, through the fabric of the man's denim jeans…was not anything to write home about.
"All right. Fuck you. I hate you. Get off my lap. I'm not gonna tell you again."
built into it."
Barnes didn't meet his gaze, instead staring down at the console between the driver's and passenger's seats. "Howard?" he murmured like he was being pulled from a dream.
"What do you mean it doesn't
"Happy?" he asked, slightly amused and a hell of a lot relieved. "Uh, aren't you—?"
"Good," he said and began to struggle to his feet. Barnes made a face like he wasn't quite sure what to do in that situation before he sighed and grumbled something, and then he was at Tony's side, bracing him and helping him out of the chair. "Thanks," he said, and Barnes nodded and dropped his arms away. "Anyway, I was about to tell you I was about two days away from telling you to get a haircut, you hippy."
Steve nodded then said, "Yeah, well, I just had three people trying to explain the need for a laser tag arena to me."
Well, was that really a surprise? She left him. Who didn't leave him?
the only one that heard the doctor say maybe half-a-dozen times how
"You cannot eat and control that suit at the same time," Barton said.
Maria. It's Olivia. Which probably was something suggested by my old man of a husband, who I just— Do you think we have sex? You think his old ticker can take it?"
, Captain!"
"Who's bragging?" Bucky asked with a squeamish face.
"You can't drive yourself to your own wedding," she said.
DUM-E let out a sad little whir at that, and Steve laughed and went over to the 'bot.
Are you currently in a relationship?
"Your shirt. I see you have the Avengers on your t-shirt."
— You could take me. Wet your fingers and— and stick them inside me one at a time, working me open slowly—
"Papa?" Steve said as he turned his attention away from inspecting a beveled glass-paneled cabinet door. "You're 'Papa'?"
"Because," he said and pulled up the hem of his shirt. "You're like, I don't know…" He unhooked the cup of his bra, and no sooner had he done that than did Olivia latch on and began to nurse from him. "This sort of perfect…"
She just made a face and rolled her eyes, pushing her way in between Tony and Rhodey and sitting down between them. She pointed to the baby and said to Rhodey with the utmost seriousness in her voice, "That baby's mine next," before she turned to Tony.
