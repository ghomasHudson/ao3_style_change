Tony's forehead furrowed a little, but then he said, "Right, okay, great. Anyway, thanks. I like doing this, but it was still good knowing I'd have a friendly face in the audience."
Steve was a little relieved that Thor wasn't on Earth at the moment. There was a lot about human culture that he just didn't get, much more so than Steve, who was just a few decades behind the curve. Thor was on an entirely different graph.
"It's a start. It's a bit light on detail, though." He could feel himself smiling too; he wondered if it had the same effect on Tony as Tony's smile had on him.
That, at least, got Tony to stop ranting about an actor Steve had never even heard of so he could stare open-mouthed at Steve for a few seconds. "I can't believe you just said that."
They'd talked about just about everything else under the sun: the new training program; the black eye and assortment of bandages Clint had come back from his mission with (Natasha just smiled and said "Ask Clint," when anyone asked her about them, and Clint told anyone who took her advice to go to hell, so there was obviously a story there); the closure of the team's favorite Thai place; whether the catering staff should keep bringing bran muffins even though nobody but Steve was willing to eat them, and even he didn't like them.
“Yeah, it’s me,” Steve agreed, “and for some reason, that’s my upper arm you’re cuddling.” He couldn’t make himself sound annoyed. He couldn’t make himself
But damn it, not only had Steve been on his ass about not sticking to the plan in Times Square--it was just the Wrecking Crew, for God's sake, it wasn't like Tony couldn't have handled them on his own--but then he'd nearly been lunch for a pack of saber-toothed tiger-deer (he might have been in his armor, but those fangs looked like they'd be effective can openers) and had, in part, been saved by Steve Rogers swinging a big stick because his shield was still back in New York.
There were a lot more in that vein, and some that verged into 140 characters of pornography, but still, overwhelmingly positive, and it filled Steve with a warm glow to think that so many people would wish them well.
“Okay, then,” Steve said to himself, turning off the light again. Tony hadn’t pulled the blankets all the way up, and the blue glow of the arc reactor in his chest gave Steve enough light to make his way over to the couch.
Not that Tony said he was angry. It was just so clear to anyone who'd spent as much time watching Tony as Steve had.
“That won’t be necessary,” JARVIS interrupted. “I woke you to inform you that Mr. Stark is on his way here.”
Then Tony had fallen silent for a minute or so. He did that sometimes, especially in the last few weeks, since he and Steve had admitted their feelings to one another. Steve didn't think talking about his feelings came any easier to Tony than it did to Steve.
--men I've ever known, and he isn't to blame. I'm the one who ended things between us, and it wasn't because Tony lied to me, or cheated on me, or whatever it is that you're imagining he did."
The Fresh Air Fund? Steve hadn't ever been able to go to one of their camps, because he was too sick, but Bucky and his oldest sister had gone one year to spend a summer out in the country where the air was clean. He'd been surprised to discover they were still around, but he was happy to help them.
Steve would have to thank Tony for that. He probably wasn't enjoying making small talk with a table full of public school teachers, but he talked about the Knicks, and rolled his eyes at Steve when Steve said, "Sorry, I'm a Nets fan. Once they moved to Brooklyn, I had no choice," in a way that looked affectionate even to Steve, who knew better.
He returned his armor to the armory, took an obscenely long, extremely hot, shower, and changed clothes.
That was why it took him by surprise when he felt someone--well, Steve, obviously--sitting down next to him on the couch. "After you told me what?"
Steve sighed. "I know. But what I meant is--" He shook his head, reaching out and putting his hand on Tony's forearm. Even before they'd pretended to be a couple, Steve would have done that without hesitation, and Tony wouldn't have objected.
A portal. The others were looking for them, and maybe they knew now that Steve and Tony were here and alive.
"But we live with two highly trained spies…" He hesitated, then grinned at Steve. "Well, one and a half, depending on whether or not Clint's paying attention."
But the fact that Steve felt like he was living for those few hours in the evening when he could go to his quarters, lock the door, and talk to Tony? That wasn't good. He needed to stay focused, to keep his head in the game. He was leading the Avengers now, and the team needed him.
Steve was silent enough throughout dinner that both Bruce and Natasha asked him if he was okay. "I'm fine," he said. "I just have a lot on my mind."
It would make sense to assume this place had shut down for the winter, and unless this was a late-season storm, he and Steve were going to be here for a while.
"The right kind of complicated," Tony said, pushing back against Steve's fingers. "If you weren't so incredibly annoying, I'd have to worry that you were an LMD or something instead of the real you."
Steve was taller than Tony, though not by that much. Enough that when Steve returned the hug and pulled Tony close, Tony fit against him nicely. Or maybe Steve would think that no matter what, because he wanted the two of them to fit together nicely.
He should probably pick them up, he thought, but he couldn't move, except to open and close his mouth in shock. It made him think of going fishing with his dad as a kid, and the way a fish would gulp for breath on dry land. Not a flattering metaphor, but he couldn't make himself stop.
Tony’s eyes flickered open for a moment, and Steve could feel Tony smiling against his mouth as Steve kissed him--softly, more of a promise than anything else. He was half asleep already, shifting in the bed to wrap himself around Steve.
No one outside the tower was going to have any idea that they weren't a couple. They worked together, they lived together--and the wild speculation that showed up on the internet made it clear that the general public had no idea of the team's living arrangements--and now they'd be spending a lot of their free time together, in public.
"I don't ask you for--Tony, you built this tower for us," he said. "And everything else you do for the team, besides."
There were shelves against most of the available wall space, all filled with baskets and wooden crates of supplies. The level of technology wasn't twenty-first century, maybe mid-twentieth? It was difficult to pinpoint.
"I've had nights like that." The apple was gnawed down to the core; Steve tossed it into the trash and concentrated on drinking his coffee.
"Because I was worried about you," Steve said again. "Because I was too stunned to move," he admitted. "And also, because running away wasn't going to change what I saw."
Tony slid over, as close to the wall as he could get, and Steve joined him under the blanket, bringing the two smaller jars of water with him. "This is from the boiled supply," he said, holding one out for Tony.
Steve must have had the same idea, because he crossed the room, giving the well cover a wide berth. "There's an opening back here," he reported before Tony could reach him. "I'm going to have a look."
The man caught Steve's eye and gave him a rueful grin. Steve smiled back in solidarity, and then caught himself.
"Why" was obvious enough, at least to Steve. It was a distraction and a subject change. It was also something Steve suspected he'd be tempted to do a lot, if he and Tony were really together, at least if it kept making Tony splutter indignantly and laugh until he wheezed, all at the same time.
"You have an evil streak, don't you?" Tony asked, but he turned his head to look at Steve, and he was grinning too.
Tony was still breathing hard when a sudden chill made him realize he was alone in the bed. This was it, then; the sex might have felt different, but they were still the same people.
"Well, we all appreciate you opening up to us like this." Steve could almost hear Tony's voice in his head, scoffing that she appreciated the ratings boost. There were probably interns backstage tweeting about it right now to get more viewers.
"I don't think so." Steve went over to fuss with the easel, turning it so that Tony couldn't see what he'd been painting. Not that he'd been trying, of course. "You made it clear that everything you said and did last night was purely because you were drunk, and that it wouldn't be repeated. That's not all that open to misinterpretation."
It hadn't occurred to him until his last night away that he could have called Tony. Even though no one would know whether or not he had, even though it contributed nothing to their pretense.
should have talked to Tony by now, but maybe the AI assumed that it was Steve's responsibility to handle that.
"Is it an emergency? Because otherwise, if we can do this later..." Steve waved the paintbrush in the air, getting a few drops of red paint on his shirt.
He circulates, before the caterer realizes that one of her servers is slacking on the job, but that means that in a few minutes, his tray's empty, and he has to go back to the kitchen for another round of pretentious snacks. When he comes back out, Tony appears to be telling a story; his face is lit up and he’s gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the hand resting possessively on his back.
Steve spent a couple of days in the tower, getting his life back in order after a week away, reading over some SHIELD reports that would probably lead to a STRIKE mission eventually, and realizing that even though he'd intended to give Tony his space when they were in private, Tony didn't really want space.
Tony's voice was warm, the words coming out thickly, like maybe he should have gotten a glass of water, too. "Tell me about them. Since it's going to be a while."
"This wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that Bruce is going to be at my house in about ninety minutes to help us unpack, would it?"
Tony could think of a lot worse things to do right now, while they waited for the storm to die down and their drinking water to cool and Steve to
"That's how you want to play?" he said. "Fine. Ravish me, Captain." He raised his arms, and Steve used one hand to pin them against the wall, while the other wrapped around both their cocks.
"Is this going somewhere?" Steve asked, because it felt like it was. It felt like it was going to a place where his heart was pounding in his chest, in a way it hadn't done since before the serum, though from a very different cause. He was surprised Tony couldn't hear it.
Tony clearly wanted him to go, and it would mean he could get away from here, away from Tony's amused expression and the armor standing silently in its niche.
A few minutes later, the door opened, and like the last time, Tony came in and got into bed. He hesitated a little when he realized he wasn’t alone in the bed, but Steve whispered, “It’s okay, it’s just me.”
And then Steve said, "I'm sorry," again, but this time he followed it with, "I had no idea," before Tony could say anything, there was a big, callused hand cupping his jaw, a thumb stroking softly over his cheekbone.
He could knock, but this way, Tony could be certain that Steve knew it was Tony out in the hall. If he chose not to answer the door, Tony would know he'd read everything wrong.
Steve accepted immediately, copying the publicists and also Tony. Which was only fair, because he accepted for Tony, too, after checking with JARVIS to be sure Tony's calendar was free.
Steve groaned as, almost involuntarily, he drew his knees up, spreading his thighs further apart as if Tony could actually touch him.
“I was starting to get that feeling, yeah.” Tony’s eyes closed, and Steve decided that whatever conversation they needed to have about this could wait until morning.
Tony was, for all intents and purposes, a million miles away, and that was much less of a good thing, but that was why Steve had contacted him, even though he didn't have anything important to say.
"You know what you did," Tony said. "Sat there and made it impossible for me to avoid you. Even after I told you."
"Tony," Steve began, but then hesitated, reaching for the right word. If Tony were here, Steve would have been able to put a hand on his shoulder, comforting him without having to actually search for the words he needed.
Steve couldn't think of an answer to that, at least not one that didn't agree with Tony, so he decided that now was the perfect time for what he'd had in mind: pushing Tony up against the wall of the elevator and kissing him.
Steve glances over in Tony’s direction; he’s checking his own phone, so Steve doesn’t have to worry about passing the information on to him. They’d agreed, when they planned this out, that if SHIELD decided to make an arrest tonight, Tony would try to lead their target away from the party, so that the arrival of SHIELD agents wouldn’t disrupt a party that was supposed to be raising money for the oncology ward at a children’s hospital.
Megan McLaren was still leaning toward him, still looking sympathetic. "I can only imagine," she said. "I mean... Tony Stark. I don't mean to belittle any of his accomplishments, and obviously, he's an Avenger, he's helped to save the world, but he's also been involved in a number of scandals."
"Yes," Steve agreed. "I know they exist, and I can understand why someone might want to use them." Steve's hand had always been enough for him, but there were some things, obviously, that might be better with a little assistance.
"Exactly," Steve agreed. "You're one of the smartest people I know, and you don't give up until you solve a problem."
"Because the world revolves around you," Steve said, laughing even though in this case, it wasn't just Tony's ego saying that. Steve's world--his personal, inner world, at least--did revolve around Tony, and he thought Tony knew that.
He poured himself a glass of water from a pitcher with orange slices floating in it, and then held the pitcher up to Tony. "Want some?"
What Tony had said didn't mean anything. Or at least, it didn't necessarily mean anything. But it did give him a new light to evaluate things in.
Well, Steve pretty much always could find room for a snack, since the serum, and Tony never remembered to keep regular mealtimes. Steve cut two oranges into quarters and put them on a plate with a couple of the muffins, then filled his mug and Tony's. Balancing the plate carefully on his forearm, he carried it and their coffee back to the lounge.
Besides, Tony had a sneaking suspicion that he knew who it was. After all, if Tony had been in as bad of shape last night as he thought he'd been, Steve would definitely have wanted to come and check on him.
"Clint's right, though," Bruce said. "This is a ridiculous plan. You're going to fake date someone to troll the conservatives?"
Steve reached out and pressed his hand against the breastplate of Tony's armor. Tony couldn't feel the touch, of course, but warmth spread through his chest anyway.
"When I said it was our little secret, I was talking about my so-called evil streak, not our relationship."
It must not have been clear enough, because Steve just said, "No, you didn't tell me that. You told me you were trying to avoid someone you--" Steve paused. "Someone you were in love with, who didn't return the feeling. You didn't want to see her all dressed up, looking beautiful, and knowing that she wasn't interested in you."
The only thing that dropped was the sponge, back into the basket, when Steve finished his task and kissed him again. "Move over a little?" he said. "I think there's room for both of us if we squeeze in."
Luckily for Steve, he'd just been linked with someone who didn't know the meaning of the phrase "completely private."
"Bonus," Tony said, dragging his last french fry through the ketchup on Steve's plate since he'd used all of his own, "in places like this, there'll be more people around, which increases the chances that pictures will wind up on the internet." He made a subtle gesture toward a nearby table where a couple of women had their phones pointed in their general direction.
He groaned. "I don't feel very in control right now." Tony's words had gone straight to his cock, the picture Tony was painting for him just as appealing to him as it was to Tony.
But still, when Tony and Bruce finished bringing the food to the table, Tony casually snagged his mug off the table, refilled it, and then sat down at the other end of the table, next to Natasha.
"Good to hear. Now, you were telling me that you were filling up a sketchbook for me with pictures of your cock," Tony said, "which I'm going to guess is as perfect as the rest of you, so I'm looking forward to seeing it in person as well as on paper."
"Good thing I didn't plan to send you off to bed, then," Steve said, letting himself grin at Tony. "Maybe we'll do that later," he added, "but right now, I want you in here."
"I have two mommies," the girl informed him. "And two daddies. And Mama's growing a baby for Daddy and Dad."
Now, over a month later, someone else had found that picture and decided it needed a wider audience; they'd attached the caption "
Tony didn't remember going to bed; he didn't actually remember leaving the gala, for that matter. The first thing he did, then, was to take stock.
Steve sighed. "Some woman whose heart you broke?" He sounded faintly disapproving. Of course he did. Tony was sure Steve disapproved of a lot of things about him, including the number of women he'd--well, Steve always said "dated," even if Tony hadn't actually
But Tony had convinced him that he needed to do one interview, at least, and so Steve had picked a local morning show. He knew clips from it would be aired elsewhere, and that was fine, but he was a New Yorker, and it was New York he wanted to talk to.
"Sounds great," Tony agreed cheerfully. He let go of Steve's shirt with one hand, slipping his hand down so that he could rub Steve's cock through his pants. "We can do that later. More than once. In multiple positions. Until we both die of exhaustion."
"You won't," Tony lied. "You can't." He'd be sore later, he knew that, but he'd be fine. Steve wasn't going to hurt him.
Of course, even though Pepper Potts was running the company just as she had when Tony was on Earth, Stark Industries had the same vested interest in getting Tony back that the Avengers had.
"I wouldn't clean wounds with it," Tony said, "but yeah, we can wash with it." He reached out for the sponge, but Steve pushed his hand aside.
But Steve had already apologized for that more than once, and right now, he wanted to see if they could move forward. "We could try it for real," he suggested quickly, before all the thoughts about how he should probably just try to maintain a professional relationship with Tony took over and silenced him.
Right now, though, Tony didn't show any signs of getting distracted. He wasn't even talking, thought he wasn't quiet, either; Steve's mouth on his muffled his whines and gasps so that no one outside the elevator would have been able to hear them, but Steve could still savor every one of them.
He tried to picture the two of them at the zoo, and something twisted in the vicinity of his heart. "That should be perfect," he said. If it stung that much knowing that none of it would be real, that meant it was exactly what they should do.
"Yeah. But hey, thanks. If it wasn't for you, and this whole scheme--I mean, obviously I give a lot of money to a lot of causes, and it's not entirely because of the tax write-off. I mean, it's
"Is that what you wanted to hear?" They still weren't touching, though all either of them had to do was move even slightly, and they would be.
"And let us know if anyone else is on this floor." There was nothing on this floor except the labs. Anyone here at this hour of the night would be looking for Tony, and Steve didn't plan to get caught
Tony raised an eyebrow. "Okay, it's not her, so don't jump to conclusions, okay?" When Steve nodded, he went on. "Natasha's a beautiful woman, right?"
"The part where you want to us to pretend we're a couple," Tony said. He came back and sat down on the end of the couch closest to Steve's chair. "I understand not going in for frantic denial, the whole 'protesting too much' thing. That's the best way to convince people that you're gay, dating me, and desperate to hide it."
"Okay," Steve said. "We're going to be ready for this. Only a few short days, and we'll be bringing you home."
And usually, none of those things. Instead: fascinated, challenged, amused, intrigued. Nothing boring about that, or about Tony Stark.
He rolled his eyes. "I could ask Steve," he agreed, "except that the time to ask him about this would have been when he brought me breakfast this morning, and I pretended to have a clue and not want to talk about it."
Steve rolled with the jokes, laughing along even though he couldn't yet find anything funny about the situation. He'd handled it badly, and Tony was angry with him, and that meant he was in danger of losing the one thing that Tony had been able to give him: his friendship.
Steve held the candle at arm's length, and Tony focused a low-power repulsor beam at it, just enough that the wick caught. "There are at least a dozen candles," Steve said. "That's just the basket I put my hand on first; there might be more. I'm going back in to explore."
Right now, he took his hand away, and then gave into a sudden impulse of his own. "Hands above your head," he told Tony, who grinned.
Tony's voice was all it took to push Steve over the edge; he groaned again and thrust in one last time before coming.
Tony laughs at whatever the man said, and then he leads the way to a quieter corner of the room. Steve follows; he’s not going to get too close, but he needs a clear line of sight, in case Tony needs him.
He waited until Tony was taking a drink before he said anything else, largely because it would let him get a whole sentence out before Tony could reply. "I can't stand cold water," he said. "Not to drink, that's obviously fine, but the hot water gave out in the shower the other day, and that night I kept dreaming about crashing into the ice."
Steve took a deep breath. "I left the woman I loved back in the nineteen-forties," he reminded Tony.
Seventy years ago, Steve would have been mortified. He'd have been desperate to change the subject, to throw Tony off the scent.
Steve's weight on top of Tony wasn't an unfamiliar sensation. That hadn't been what they did last night--last night Tony had buried himself in the glorious tight heat of Steve's perfect ass--but it happened often enough.
So while Tony kissed back, he also walked backward a bit, drawing Steve along with him until the backs of his knees bumped against one of the beds. "Take me to bed," Tony said, because he usually said, "Fuck me," and this time could, for once, be different.
That left Tony free to apply his superior intellect to the problem of finding the most efficient way of getting blackout drunk.
By Steve’s calculations, SHIELD is about two minutes out when Tony smirks at his companion. “What do you say we get out of here?”
"They're not of my face." There was no way that anyone would be able to identify him from the drawings, unless they'd taken pictures the last time Steve had had a physical at SHIELD. Even then, it was highly unlikely.
"Tell you a secret," Tony said. "I'm not doing it for you guys. I'm doing it because of what his face looked like when he saw your kid dressed like that."
"I'd like to see that, too. I want to make you go wild." Tony chuckled. "Maybe even get you to beg a little."
diner were getting used to seeing Iron Man and Captain America, in tuxedos or nice suits, drinking coffee and laughing and arguing about whether pancakes were better with maple syrup or with strawberries.
Maybe he should talk to Tony about it before he decided, but if he couldn't even say, "So, why did you kiss me last Thursday?" he wasn't sure he was going to be able to bring this up, either.
That brought Tony out of wherever he'd been hiding today. Probably his lab, but Steve hadn't checked; they had to spend enough time together that Steve thought it was best for him to leave Tony alone when they were in the tower. He didn't have to invade all of Tony's private life just because their public lives were temporarily entangled.
Steve's brain absolutely refused to let him finish that sentence with anything more descriptive than "in a compromising position."
Tony laughed. "I don't think all that many people will be in the position to experience your evil streak, so they wouldn't believe me anyway."
"I had time to think about it," Steve said, and Tony tried not to grimace. "And despite the fact that you're an unbelievably frustrating human being sometimes, you really are my type."
Steve straightened up, taking his hand off Tony's back. He poured more lube into his hand and began applying it to his cock. "Good," he said. "It'll be our little secret."
"I haven't complained about that in months," Steve said. Besides, it hadn't been much of a complaint then; he'd just thought that a more military environment might instill some of the discipline that the team had lacked. He'd blamed that for the team's breaking up before, but he'd realized by now that he'd been wrong. They might not have the same kind of discipline that a military unit had, but that was fine. What they had worked for them.
"That works. How about you get off on your floor, I go up to the penthouse and clean up, and you come join me when you're ready?"
Then he shook his head. "I was in that position last night, or so I thought, and finding out--again, so I thought--that there was some woman you were so much in love with that it was making you miserable, and she didn't want you? I didn't want to leave you alone and miserable."
And sure enough, Peter, MJ, and Ned were in the living room--Peter practically radiating cheerful helpfulness, Ned fidgeting uncomfortably, MJ looking just as bored as she'd sounded.
Afterward, Tony had wanted to check it out immediately, frustrated that tech he'd designed wasn't working perfectly.
On one side of the opening, there was a metal structure mounted into the rock wall; a second glance revealed that it was a heavy sliding metal door, and Tony found a mechanism on the other side that it would lock into. The other side of the door was covered with thin panels of wood that would blend in pretty well with the back wall of the cabin, when closed.
"I'm sure, Dr. Banner. I do know how to operate my equipment." The voice was familiar, but Tony couldn't place it. He was still trying to remember who it was when Steve interrupted the budding argument on the other side.
But perfect for Steve. If he wanted to be with someone who was never irritating and never found Steve irritating, either, he wouldn't have ever thought about Tony in the first place.
"No," Steve said. "I mean... it's personal. And, uh, painful." And he was piling lies upon lies, but what else was he supposed to do? He'd like to think that everything he'd said, all the people he'd apparently inspired or encouraged, would still count if he confessed to what he and Tony had done.
Not to mention all the people who'd been treating Steve's life like an academic subject when he was still in the ice, and didn't see the need to stop that now that Steve was here, walking around, not really wanting to hear their theories about what Captain America had really been like.
Tony laughed. "Not really," he admitted. "It's fine. It's not the kind of place I go out to dinner with friends. I come to places like this when I want to be seen, or when I'm..." He laughed again, more softly this time. "When I'm trying to impress a date," he admitted.
Steve had left before the interview was over; he was waiting for Tony in the lab when Tony got back to the tower. Tony hadn't seemed surprised to see him there, but when Steve had tried again to both apologize and explain, he'd just said, "It had to end sometime, right, Cap? It's not a problem," and given Steve a smile so bright and sharp that looking at it was almost physically painful.
"I don't, but checking out Clint's arms is all the proof I need. Anyway," he said, "getting back to the subject at hand. If I just thought you were attractive, that would be fine."
On the other hand, Tony was here, and he was tempting, and Steve had decided to give in to temptation.
Of course, Steve had also figured that Tony would be only pretending to enjoy himself at the Pride festival, and clearly, that wasn't the case. He'd seen Tony pretending to enjoy himself before, and this wasn't it.
"We do," Steve agreed, letting the crack about Clint pass unremarked, "but I'm not sure what that has to do with anything."
"No," Tony said quickly. "I'm okay. I promise, I'm fine, and even if I wasn't, this is the way things have to be. We can't risk Ultron ever getting free again. If that means I'm here for the long haul, it's what I have to do."
Steve had rehearsed that phrase until the string of letters flowed naturally. To a man who had grown up in a time when the nicest way he heard people like him described was generally, "like that, you know," it took a little practice, but he did it.
But when he’s paying attention, Tony likes good food, and from the reactions of the other guests, the tarts are very good.
"Why, Steve, I didn't know you knew words like that," Tony said, in the same mock-surprised tone he used when Steve could operate the microwave or knew who Lady Gaga was. (Microwave popcorn was terrible in comparison to the real thing, and Steve had voluntarily listened to exactly one half of a Lady Gaga song before he'd made Sam stop the music, but that wasn't the point. The point was that Steve had been in the twenty-first century for a few years now, and he was aware of his surroundings.)
"Here we go again," he murmured to Tony, before stepping back and turning toward the nearest amateur journalist, a young woman who looked like she might be a college student.
"Aye aye, Captain," Tony said, grinning at him. He moved over to the table, undoing his belt and unfastening his pants.
"It's not," Steve said. "I know there are…" Tony was sure to think his hesitation was from prudishness, and truth be told, he'd given Tony a lot of evidence for that theory tonight. But that wasn't Steve's problem.
A few seconds later, the phone in Steve's pocket chimed with a text alert. Shaking his head, Steve pulled it out to read what Tony had sent him.
He looked vague and distracted, but if Steve had passed him in the hall, he would have chalked it up to exhaustion and overwork. Tony had looked vague and distracted for days now.
The questions weren't too bad. They were almost all about the breakup, and Steve just kept falling back on "It's very painful" and "We just weren't compatible," and refusing to give any specifics.
"That's not true," Tony said quickly. "I have a very low threshold for boredom. I have a much higher tolerance for hearing the sound of my own voice, but I'm reaching the limit of that, too. So maybe you should tell me what you're doing?"
"But maybe we all are," Steve finished. "I can't stand cold water, and to be honest, I'm not a big fan of winter. You--I didn't mean to, but I overheard you and Pepper arguing a few times. You have nightmares, don't you? About the invasion."
days. Both in the amount of work we have to do, and how long they're going to feel, knowing what's waiting for me at the other end."
Sam had explained that he had patched the link between the Avengers' new headquarters and the pocket dimension Tony was trapped in into the intercom system. In other words, talking to Tony from his quarters should be as simple as talking to Hawkeye, whose room was just down the hall.
But he'd have hated it. Lying, hiding, pretending--none of those were Steve's strengths. He could see their necessity, when it was to protect yourself and your loved ones from persecution under an unjust law, but he'd have been miserable.
"No," Tony said quickly. "I'm not expecting any trouble. I mean, there are definitely some terrible people here, but they're mostly politicians." He shook his head. "This is a Tony Stark problem, not an Iron Man problem."
But Steve was standing by the bed, still looking down at him with that same half-smile. Tony would empty his bank accounts if it meant Steve would smile at him like that every day. "I'll be right back," he said.
So yes, Steve liked that answer, and he nodded, smiling gratefully at Tony. "And I agree with that completely," he said.
He knew what the forks were for. Back in the forties, before the USO tour, Captain America had been given thorough etiquette lessons, because important people were going to want to have dinner with him. Knowing what to do with the forks wasn't the point. The forks reminding him of a time when he felt like a trained dog being run through its tricks,
"Don't worry," Tony said from the other end of the table. "I'd been thinking that our eventual break-up should be more dramatic, to give people a good show, but this is fine. As long as we don't bad-mouth one another in public, everyone's going to get bored of the story soon. You went off the grid right after the announcement, which kept people interested, but by the end of the week, the world will have moved on."
"This is great," Tony said, digging in his pocket and dropping some cash into a jar that said it was for donations to a project to provide medication subsidies to people living with HIV. He'd been doing that to any donation jar they passed. Not that he couldn't afford it; Steve just figured Tony wasn't going to donate money that couldn't be used as a tax write-off.
Tony dropped the subject, and Steve didn't bring it up again. They skipped the polar bear, though, in favor of red pandas and sea lions.
Tony looked up, rubbing his eyes and blinking blearily at him. “I’m running my backups, then I’m going to bed. You don’t have to make a fuss over me.”
Tony was safe. Tony was alive. Tony was in relatively good spirits, and sounded happy to have Steve to keep him company. All of these were good things.
Due to the nature of dimensional travel, they'd actually been gone three days here, but three days wasn't too bad. He'd skipped out on his life for three days for worse reasons before.
Steve let Tony change the subject, at least for the time being. It was good that they enjoyed one another's company, after all, and right now was not the time to rock the boat.
She reached out and patted Steve's hand. "I think we were all surprised that you were involved with someone with his reputation to begin with."
The sound of the tray hitting the floor had gotten through to Tony, who looked up, swore loudly, and then snapped, "Stop. Initiate shutdown protocols."
But there'd been such fondness in the way the man had looked at his companion and shrugged slightly, and Steve had felt an echoing fondness for Tony welling up in him. This place helped make Tony who he was, and even though it meant nothing to Steve personally, he loved it, because he loved Tony.
So, double win, and Tony was happy to come with him. There was a series of short speeches; Steve and Tony were the last ones to speak.
Tony could just be fishing, Steve told himself. It was guesswork, to see what Steve might give away in an unguarded moment.
Steve had figured out how to set that one as the wallpaper on his phone. All part of the illusion, he told himself. If he were really dating Tony, he definitely would have done that. He'd also taught himself how to take a screenshot, so that he could show the photographer--who seemed to be a high school girl, from her Instagram account--that he'd liked it. (She'd responded with "asdfljklk;adjfklsd;!!!!!!!" which everyone had assured Steve was a good reaction.)
Ned dangled a set of keys in the air. "We can also make runs to the hardware store, or go for coffee, or whatever you guys need."
"I told you that last night," Steve said, squeezing Tony's knee lightly, "though that's another thing you probably don't remember."
This time, Tony didn’t seem startled by his presence; he murmured, “Steve,” and turned over onto his side, wrapping both arms around Steve’s bicep.
Steve was getting used to it, too. In general, that was fine, but the problem was that Tony kissed him as they were coming out of the hotel--just in case anyone was taking pictures, of course--and Steve was getting used to that, too.
This place must have been in use for decades, since they'd sunk a well into the floor of the cabin. Or maybe that was the source of the running water, and they'd covered it rather than capping it completely in case the pump went out.
And then Steve's arms were wrapped around him again, and Tony could force his breathing to slow. "There was a portal," Steve said. "Just a tiny one, and just for a few seconds. But I could hear Bruce calling us, and I answered him. I think he heard me, but then it closed."
"Of course," Tony mumbled. Then, in a more animated tone, "Come on, don't keep me waiting forever, evil streak or not."
' is a good song." He drew a wavy line down the center of his page, dividing the space into two separate scenes. In one, he continued using the cartoon style he'd adopted for these sketches, drawing himself, on his bed, sketching… himself, he supposed, like the infinite Quakers on the oatmeal box.
"And," Clint said, shaking his head, "you're an idiot." He got to his feet. "And I've got a meeting with Maria Hill in about an hour, so I'd better get going."
They'd been spending a lot of time together. In public, of course; not just scheduled events, but if one of them wanted to go to lunch, the other one usually came along. Steve liked going to small art galleries when he had the time, looking at the works of new artists and buying the ones he especially liked. It was hard to wrap his brain around the idea that he could afford to buy art, just because he wanted it on his wall, but he did enjoy it.
"We're here, Bruce," Steve called. "We're safe for the moment," he added, "but do you think you can bring us home?"
And at first, he thought he was right. It was a Thursday, which was one of the nights the team, or whatever parts of the team were in New York, had dinner together, and Steve got back in time to shower, change, and show up in the kitchen just as the food was arriving.
Somewhere in the back of Tony's mind, there was a tiny corner that was still completely sober, and that corner was horrified to hear the rest of him say, "You should probably put me to bed."
"Good thing, too," Tony said, "because now that you've brought your cock into the conversation, I don't think I want to change the subject any time soon."
That didn't mean anything, though, or at least nothing more than that Steve was his friend, and he'd known that already. It wasn't Steve's fault that Tony wanted more than that.
"So what's the problem? You can't stay focused on punching people twenty-four/seven. Not even you. You're allowed to have something else in your life." Tony's voice softened. "You're allowed to be a person, Steve. To want things other than the Avengers. To care about things other than being Captain America." He sighed. "
"What are you looking for?" Steve sounded infuriatingly calm. If he was about to give Tony a lecture about how they didn't need electricity or central heating or anything but a big stupid stick to protect themselves from things that looked like saber-toothed tigers with horns--
"And I've apologized for that," Steve said. "I didn't intend to do it. Things just... happened. I started talking, and then could hardly believe what I was saying."
"Can you come up with something that simulates the effects of magic?" he asked. "We know there are several villains out there who use, or can use, magic, and I don't think we're sufficiently prepared."
"I was hoping someone had brought them in," he admitted. "I didn't actually believe it, but I hoped." Steve sighed. "Nobody knows where we are."
Tony's expression flickered for a moment, but before Steve could figure out what Tony was thinking, the nonchalant smile was back. "Thanks," he said. "That was thoughtful. Unnecessary, but thoughtful."
"I could tell you what I've been sketching lately," Steve suggested. He opened up his sketchbook--a new one, one that was never going to leave this room, unless--until--Tony came back. Then, it might come with him to Tony's. He'd intentionally left the first page blank, just in case someone idly picked it up. Well, not entirely blank. There was no drawing on it, though, just "personal" written in block letters.
That was such a tissue-thin excuse that Steve knew Tony was trying to keep things civil between them, that what he wanted was to tell Steve to get the hell of his lab.
glass: transparent and likely to shatter, prone to leaving nasty wounds if you prodded at the broken parts. "I won't break." Another lie.
." He shrugged. "I was assuming, since we needed to talk about it, that it was something I ought to apologize for and promise to never repeat."
"Of course not," Tony said, twisting to look at Steve over his shoulder. "I got myself ready. The program's still too rudimentary for anything but the basic act."
"You just what?" Tony said. "Listen, I know I'm out of smashing range, but I'm still not going to referee any arguments between Hulk and Hawkeye. That's your problem now."
"Then I guess you understand after all." Tony slid down from the table. "So if everything's clear--"
But Steve had already criticized Tony for his lack of caution, and besides, he wanted Tony just the way he'd seen him when he walked in.
All right, then, Steve decided. He'd contact the PR team later; he already had an email notification that they wanted to talk to him ASAP. If they complained about how long it took him to get in touch, he'd play the "old guy not really understanding how email works" card. He tried not to use it very often, but right now, he needed time.
Tony Stark was a playboy and a cynic. He shouldn't want to carry reminders with him that at least occasionally, the best man he knew thought Tony was worthy of his attention.
"I had the door locked," Tony said again. "Besides, wouldn't you have done the same thing to any other door, if you thought I was under attack?"
"Wow," Tony said, which wasn't the suavest response, but was definitely heartfelt. "We've been wasting a lot of time."
"The point," Tony said. "Okay, sure. The point is that what got you so pissed off at me that you wouldn't even look at me this afternoon, you blew me off for coffee, and you're acting like you can't wait to get rid of me now--that happened this morning, didn't it?"
But the "I'm okay," in his ear was immensely reassuring, just the same. "Grounded for the rest of the fight, but okay."
Kate rolled her eyes without even looking up from her chocolate cake. "You were like that at dinner with my parents yesterday," she said.
"Stark Industries has a float," Tony said. "There's an LGBTQ employee group. If you'd told me you wanted to ride in the parade, I'd have set it up."
"I'm sorry," he said. "I was coming back here to call you so at least you wouldn't be the last to know."
"You can call me naive if you want," Steve said, "but I'll never understand why you do business with people you dislike so much you're trying to hide from them at a party."
They were going to die here, but if Tony had anything to say about it, it wouldn't be today, and it wouldn't be alone.
Captain America couldn't be impatient for a fight to end because there was someone at home waiting for him. That was the way to find himself making mistakes, and when he made mistakes, people died.
"I think about you," he said, which wasn't a direct answer, but it was still important. "After we talk, usually."
"We really need to work on that," Tony said. "The plans for the beacon are a pain when all we have is audio."
The other man laughs, and Steve realizes that if he’s in biotechnology, like his file said, he probably knows Justin Hammer. Some of Tony’s scorn for Hammer is just ego, but Steve can’t believe anyone could be in the same room as Hammer for more than fifteen minutes and not realize that he’s an obnoxious little weasel. He's probably not just pretending the story's funny to get into Tony's pants.
So Steve had decided that this one thing, at least, was going to be just his. He'd told himself that if there ever came a time when he had someone significant in his life--whether they were a man or a woman--they could decide together how public they wanted their relationship to be.
"The hot water shouldn't run out," Tony said. "I'm going to have to look at the water heater. It's supposed to be an instant heater, but apparently--"
He considered the message for a moment. Steve wanted Tony to know where he was, but he hadn't made a move to contact Tony directly.
He waited to say anything until they were sitting at a table in the corner, Tony with an Americano and Clint with something that had a lot of whipped cream involved, not to mention the glittery purple sprinkles.
He heads in their direction with his refilled tray. As he gets closer, he can make out what Tony’s saying: “It was just so sad, you know? Hammer thought that without my armor, I’d be helpless. Like I need any help to outsmart Justin.”
"I came back ready to have an adult conversation about what happened last night." Steve smiled. "I probably should have known better than to expect that."
"No, I didn't want to go to my cousin's gross gender reveal party," came a second, bored-sounding, voice. "But I'm here anyway."
That did nothing to relieve Steve's confusion, but before he could say anything, Tony was out the door.
"Later is good," he agreed. "You're busy right now." Now he moved his hand away from Tony's cock--not far, just so that he could get Steve's pants open.
The specifics, of course, were "Tony's straight" and "Tony's definitely not in love with me," and revealing either of those would mean admitting that he'd been lying all along.
Tony had made sure that the entire team had the latest StarkPhones, and he'd even had someone come to the tower and show Steve and Thor how to use them. Steve did use his phone--to stay in touch with the team, to look things up when he had a question, that kind of thing.
The guy goes down like a rock, and Steve tries not to look pleased with himself.  He tries even harder not to look pleased when Tony insists, repeatedly, that he and Steve have absolutely nothing to contribute now that they’ve delivered the target.
"Not like that, Captain Literal. I mean, if I were there with you right now, you'd still have to wait."
Not that smiling back at the guy was wrong; even given that Steve and Tony weren't really a couple, he and the man were in the same situation, being shown locations for stories that usually ended with, "You probably had to be there."
Tony looked at Steve. "You told them we were moving in together? You told them where you live? Are you nuts? We'll never get rid of them, they're like roaches."
Not to mention his almost-nightly talks with Steve, which had become an important part of Steve's day.
But finally, Tony got a text letting him know that their car was outside, and with a sigh of relief, he told Steve, "Time to go home."
Steve burst out laughing. "I think I'd check the last one." But it had broken the ice, and he took a deep breath. "So, you know back when we were pretending to date, I really enjoyed it."
Tony's words were muffled; all Steve could make out for sure was "...way...you think," which he was going to assume was part of a compliment, because Tony was licking his palm, a lot slower and more thoroughly than he really needed to.
And then, to Tony's surprise, Steve dragged one of the blankets off the next bunk and draped it over Tony before he left.
"Great," Steve said. He wasn't sure how he was going to approach this, but there was a bright side: he was fairly certain he couldn't make things any more awkward between them.
"And if the secret gets out?" Tony asked. "Outside the tower, I mean. It's bound to happen eventually."
"We should probably head upstairs," he suggested, his mouth still pressed against the hot skin of Tony's neck.
“I know you’re going to bed,” Steve said. “It’s what you do after you go to bed that I’m talking about.” He should have brought it up before now, but every time he'd managed to get Tony alone in the last couple of weeks, something had happened to interrupt them.
drunk. You never knew when Hydra or AIM or the Squadron Supreme were going to come out of the woodwork spoiling for a fight, and while Tony hated to lose a fight for any reason, he would hate it even more if the reason he lost was that he was too drunk to see straight.
"I don't need to take a picture," Steve said. "I'm not going to forget." He wasn't even going to dignify the idea that he might sell Tony's privacy to the press with a reply.
"Checks help," Marian said. "You probably also know the right people for us to talk to if we want to get things done."
The room was still spinning; Tony decided it would be better if he closed his eyes. Even better because Steve was still giving him a look that Tony couldn't decipher.
From the way Tony got quieter and much less melodramatic as the afternoon wore on--at least, unless there was anyone around, when he launched himself into high gear and became almost a caricature of himself--he was pretty sure Tony hated this, too.
He smiled at Tony. "I'm not suggesting we should call Bugle News Network in the morning, but I don't see a reason to keep this secret from our friends."
Maybe there was someone else Tony was interested in, but couldn't say anything because he didn't want to be the man who two-timed Captain America.
"I know. But it's been over a week since we've been out for coffee. They're going to be missing us at the diner."
"I'm not mad at you now," Steve said. "But like I said, I'm in the middle of something, so could you get to the point?"
But "better" would mean they had Tony back. At least they were doing everything they could do to make that happen. There was a Stark Industries scientist, a Dr. Jane Foster, permanently on loan to the Avengers right now, addressing that particular problem.
Okay, it made perfect sense now that Steve would be pissed off at him. Hell, Tony was pissed off at himself.
When Steve had a moment to look down, he saw that Tony was on his feet, still in the battle even if his suit was too damaged for him to fly.
That sounded good to Steve. "JARVIS, start the elevator again." He turned to Tony, grinning. "Now, tell me about these plans."
Steve approaches the men without letting himself look directly at Tony. “Caviar and creme fraiche tartlet?” he offers, pasting a bland smile on his face. He’s a waiter, he reminds himself, he doesn’t care what the guests are doing.
JARVIS hadn't sent up a red alert, so it probably wasn't an intruder, and Tony probably hadn't locked the door last night. Or rather, Steve probably hadn't. Tony rarely did; the only people in the building were the team, after all. He only locked the door when he wanted to be sure of having privacy.
"Absolutely," Bruce said with the kind of confidence that, from Tony, could have meant that he was bullshitting. Bruce wasn't Tony, though, so maybe it was the truth. "We just didn't want to waste energy on a larger portal until we were sure we had you."
"Yeah, about that," Tony said quickly, because if he could just give them a reason to sweep this all under the rug, it would be fine, they could move past it. Steve obviously didn't hate him, or he wouldn't have made breakfast, so whatever appalling thing he'd done that Steve thought they needed to talk about couldn't have been unforgivable.
. Steve had been to space with the Avengers. How was that not a good part of the twenty-first century?
"Of course," Steve said, smiling. "Got to inspect the merchandise." He thought about asking Tony to describe himself, but realized he wouldn't feel comfortable reciprocating yet, so he put that aside for another time.
Steve laughed again. "You actually thought I'd want to keep this a secret?" He paused. "Some of the details, yes. Please let's make sure nobody has any idea about those. But in general?"
annoyed. It was ridiculous, and honestly, he had to wonder what on earth was going on in Tony’s mind, to send him sleepwalking into Steve’s bed, time after time, but it was also too comfortable, too pleasant, for Steve to really mind.
"No," Steve said firmly. "No. I'll always admire and respect Tony. I'll always be proud to call him my teammate and my friend. But any romantic involvement between the two of us is over. Nobody did anything wrong," he reiterated, because the thought that people might think Tony had hurt him was unacceptable.
"Eventually," Tony said. It wasn't like he was going to pine forever. At least, he really hoped not. He doubted it--without any encouragement at all, even just in the form of hope, this was bound to die out sooner or later.
"How very gracious of you." Now there was an edge in Tony's voice that hadn't been there when Steve had been gaping at him in shock.
So Tony only sleepwalked when he desperately needed sleep. Well, if his subconscious had decided for some reason that he needed to be in Steve’s bed for that, Steve wasn’t going to fight it.
And really, Steve realized, Tony would have closed the book if it belonged to anyone but Steve. It was just Steve whose head Tony kept trying to get into; that wasn't really Tony Stark behavior as a rule, unless he had a compelling reason.
He flipped the book open to the first blank page and began to draw. These sketches weren't as carefully planned as the ones he did when he was starting a painting; he was just trying to capture things he'd seen, before he forgot key details. "I was trying to expand your musical horizons."
"Right now? Yeah. Definitely." He put his index finger in his mouth, doing his best to make as much noise as possible, wet slurping sounds that, to Steve's ears at least, definitely sounded obscene.
"Yeah?" The word was rich with amusement, but more than that: interest. "Not seeing how that leads to drawings in a special sketchbook, Cap."
"Fine." Tony sighed. He was right, he knew it. But if Steve wouldn't admit that, it didn't matter. "Then just tell me one thing, and I'll go. What happened last night that you wanted to talk about, before I started apologizing for things that I didn't even remember doing?"
He was fishing again, Steve reminded himself, but he couldn't keep himself from chuckling anyway; it was almost an involuntary response.
"That's me," Tony said, breathing hard but still managing to sound unbelievably smug. "And I really want to see you come, but
"That wasn't my idea." Steve's expression hadn't changed, so Tony closed his eyes again. It helped him feel less dizzy, anyway, even if it didn't help anything else.
He held the sketchbook at arm's length, surveying it critically. He'd found Rhino's look of utter surprise when he rounded a corner and found himself trapped between the two Avengers to be comical, and he'd let that come through in his drawing; the style was more cartoonish than the portraits that had hung on his wall at the tower.
Most people would have been had enough of Tony's constant talking after half an hour, at most, unless they wanted something from him. Steve hadn't seemed to mind, which did absolutely nothing to make Tony less ridiculously enamored of him.
"I'd like that," Steve said. "But we don't have to. I mean, we've made a public appearance as a couple tonight, we don't have to do any more."
And then Steve had taken him to the bedroom, and it had been one of the times when Tony let himself imagine that they might actually be more than that.
"I won't be coming out as gay," Steve corrected him. "I'll be coming out as bisexual, and..." He shrugged. "It's not something I'll need to walk back. I hadn't intended to make a public statement about it, but I won't need to take it back when this is over."
He closed his eyes. Steve was still looking at him, and he wasn't sure he liked it. That was ridiculous. Of course he liked Steve looking at him, who wouldn't want that?
Steve closed his eyes briefly, letting himself imagine Tony with two fingers inside himself, getting himself slick and ready to take that metal cock.
"Sounds plausible," Tony said, "and you're right, the closer to the truth it is, the easier it will be for us to remember the details."
Between that and the darkness, if the door hadn't been open, they might not have found this room for quite a while.
"What the hell did you do that for?" Tony demanded. The paper had bounced off his face and landed in his coffee, and he grabbed a spoon to fish it out. "Are you insane? My God, I'm dating a lunatic. Not that it's the first time."
It wasn't just about what Steve had seen a few minutes ago. That was obviously a large part of it; that was what had put this specific idea into Steve's head.
Steve listened as Tony ran through the same explanation that Sam had given him, but at least they were all certain that they could bring Tony back without bringing Ultron with him.
His bed was big enough for two people, but he thought Tony was going to be confused and embarrassed enough by waking up in Steve’s bed, without adding “waking up next to Steve” into the mix.
But this wasn't a perfect world, as demonstrated by both dinosaurs attacking Long Island and the fact that Steve and Tony were friends and teammates, but nothing else.
Steve's favorite was of Tony, eye-level with one of his helmets, performing finite adjustments. That sketch made it look like Tony was having a heart-to-heart talk with Iron Man; he wondered what Tony would think of it if he showed him.
"Okay," Tony said. "But not right now. We just finished dinner, and since I'm guessing you want to talk about something, not just shoot the breeze for an hour, I'm refusing to do that without pancakes. I'm going to the lab. Come get me when you get back from your run tomorrow."
Steve didn't mind. It was obviously intended to get Steve thinking about all the various other ways Tony could use his tongue, and it was just as obviously working.
"I'll keep that in mind," Tony said, just as Steve realized that not all the civilians had been removed from the area--never underestimate the stubbornness of someone who thought they could get video of actual dinosaurs--and some of them had their phones out.
He was alone in bed, which was probably a good call. He had been drunk enough that the phrase "performance issues" would probably have been relevant.
The fact that telling another lie made him feel even worse about this whole situation didn't matter. How
Besides, Tony still went silent at odd times, or looked out of the window when the were in the car together instead of looking at Steve, and so Steve thought that he was having regrets about ever having agreed to this.
He hadn't even flipped the switch before JARVIS spoke, sounding as apologetic as an artificial intelligence could. "I regret having to disturb you, Captain. There is no danger, but your assistance is required."
"I'm not angry," Steve said. "I'm tired. I had a long night last night, and I got up early. That's all this is, Tony, I swear."
Steve felt his face getting a lot hotter than the sun would account for. Tony was good at this. He hadn't expected that.
Then Steve would turn up at the door of the penthouse, or he'd nudge Tony on their way out of a mission briefing and they'd meet up fifteen minutes later in a supply closet, or, once, he'd come into Tony's workshop. (Tony had been impressed by his own ability to assemble the components of an elbow joint while Steve was attempting to suck his brains out through his cock. And people told him he was bad at staying focused.)
"We'll try to find civilization once the weather improves," Steve said. "Maybe whoever uses this base will come back once the storm's over. There's water and food, and power; we'll be okay until then."
Tony had already pulled out his phone and was starting to make notes. "I can use that to simulate an opponent. If we come up with a more comprehensive list, the training room AI can generate randomized opponents--with different physical attributes and skills, as well as different sets of magical attacks and defenses. JARVIS, we're going to want all the recordings from any confrontations with, let's see. Loki, the Enchantress, Victor von Doom--"
It was just also torture, because this "unrequited love" thing had sucked back when he'd thought it was just one-sided lust, back before he'd realized the depth of his feelings for Steve.
for the tax write-off, but I don't just give the money at random. But I wouldn't have started showing up at this kind of thing, and..." He took a deep breath. "I think I like it. Speaking out somewhere other than Congressional hearings."
God, Tony thought, he must have been the world's biggest jackass last night. Hopefully, one of the others would be able to tell him about it, because it looked like he might owe Steve a more specific apology.
When Steve finally came, shuddering against Tony's body, he kissed Tony again, and Tony clutched Steve to him like if he just held on tightly enough, he could keep Steve with him like this forever.
"When we made our first statements--about being together. When I came out. Why didn't you say anything about yourself?"
Steve broke off a small piece and put it into his mouth, grimacing almost instantly. "It's salted," he said. "And really sour."
Then Steve said, "We should probably talk some more about last night," and Tony forgot all about the way Steve's ears went pink when he was embarrassed.
Natasha was still studying her maps, but Steve wanted to get up and stretch his legs. A walk in the fresh air--as fresh as you got in the middle of a city, anyway--sounded good; a walk
"In spite of my better judgment, I don't. I don't know what I told you last night after we got back, but I do remember telling you at the gala that I was trying to avoid someone I'd fallen in unrequited love with." Tony put his hand over Steve's, enjoying the permission to touch. He'd always taken every opportunity to touch Steve, but never like this.
Steve shrugged. "The only thing that's not true is that Tony and I are a couple." Maybe not exactly the case, but Tony didn't seem to mind that people were going to think he wasn't straight, so Steve wasn't going to worry about that.
"He's good for your ego," Natasha volunteered. "Having a little air let out of it every now and then won't hurt you at all."
Steve frowned a little. "There aren't any villains here, are there? It doesn't seem like the kind of place they'd be invited to, but--"
Steve frowned. “Has he done that since--you know, the last time? Or the last time I know about, anyway?”
"You're going to kill me," Tony said, sounding far too happy for a man who claimed to be close to death. "I mean it. Here lies Tony Stark, he died from an overdose of Captain America's sex noises."
It wouldn't change anything--Steve was still the most annoying person Tony had ever met and they were still barely friends most of the time--but it'd kill some time.
Steve was sorry. Steve felt sorry for him, and as long as Tony managed to not make things weird between them for the next few weeks, things would get back to normal. Or they should, anyway, because it wasn't like he and Steve hadn't gotten past a lot worse than a slight case of unrequited love.
"That's great news," Steve said. "I think he mentioned talking to Reed Richards, too," he added, just because he knew that Tony and the leader of the Fantastic Four had a friendly, or at least friendly-ish, scientific rivalry going on.
Steve closed his eyes, thinking about Tony's hands. He'd always liked them; he had sketchbooks full of proof of that. They were clever and capable and strong, and Steve had absolutely no doubt that they'd feel incredible on his skin. That Tony would know exactly what to do with those fingers once they were inside Steve.
Of course, if Steve hadn't been sitting with him the whole evening, he wouldn't have had to get that drunk.
"You see that well in the dark?" Tony asked skeptically. Now that he was closer, he could see that Steve was right; most of the rear wall wasn't a wall at all, just an opening that led into inky black nothingness.
It was perfect. Exactly the way Tony liked it. It was even brewed using the beans that Tony kept in his own kitchen, because Hulk was not getting his hands on Tony's custom-roasted blend. The coffee in the communal kitchen was good, but it wasn't this kind of good.
People were going to notice that, Steve reminded himself. Even if it was under the table, people would notice, and it would make their act look more believable. Affectionate.
house; Steve had already done some redecorating to make it feel more like a shared place, because Tony didn't want to have to start again just when he'd got the garage exactly the way he liked it), the rest was going to the thrift store--but at that, he stopped and frowned.
"You thought my sheets were probably nicer than yours, which I'm sure is true, because you keep complaining that the tower isn't spartan enough."
"How nice is 'nice'?" Steve asked. "I'm pretty sure our standards are different for that kind of thing."
The endearment came as a surprise to Steve; if he'd thought about what Tony would be like in bed at all--and he had, so many times--he'd always thought Tony would have been… harsher, somehow. Not understanding. Not calling Steve things that brought color to his cheeks and pangs of longing to his chest.
Tony took it, unscrewing the lid and taking a sip. It tasted odd, probably the unfamiliar mineral content, but it was drinkable.
"No. It's good." He'd been surprised about that. The wine he'd drunk during the war had usually been because it was a better option than whatever water supply they'd found, or because one of the Howlies was passing it around and Steve didn't want to be rude. It hadn't been revolting. It just hadn't been like this.
Frowning over his attempt to draw a goatee on the figure in his sketch, Steve didn't say anything, but he did hum a little of "
Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, for Pete's sake." He pulled his hand back and started typing on his phone again.
torturing himself. Tony genuinely enjoyed hanging out with Steve, getting the chance to talk to him as just a couple of guys drinking coffee instead of as Avengers. And when they went out for the coffee, they didn't even get interrupted, at least not by minor things like Hulk being angry about the lack of pizza bagels.
Or maybe he was just tired of pretending. The fun was wearing off for both of them, so it was time to put a stop to it. They could "break up."
"No," Steve said again, because he didn't know what else to say. People who had had telephones, back in the thirties, had tended to only have one--unless, he supposed, they were very rich, but he'd never been in the home of anyone that wealthy--and they put it in a public area, like the living room or the kitchen.
Tony opened the bottle of painkillers and downed two, gulping down the second glass of water. He didn't think he needed the ginger ale, except for more hydration. What he needed was a cup of strong black coffee and maybe--
"Hey, Tony," he went on, "I have some more ideas for new training simulations. Do you have any time to talk about them?"
Tony wasn't silent, exactly; he didn't say anything, but Steve could hear rustling sounds that he assumed were Tony getting his clothing out of the way. "Inspect away," Tony said. "Actually, I like the idea of that. Thinking about you looking at me is kind of a turn-on."
"I think that could possibly be arranged," he said. Tony had put his hand back on the table when he was done with his phone; Steve reached out and put his own hand over it, his thumb rubbing lightly over Tony's skin. "Anything else?"
"So I did," Steve agreed, and was rewarded with a dazzling smile, lacking all the sharp edges from earlier.
Tony had kept the conversation going--about the charity, about various people in attendance, about the work he'd been doing in the lab, about the team training session Steve had scheduled for tomorrow--so that Steve didn't get much of a chance to think about it, either.
Tony went over to sit on the couch, trying to seem nonchalant. "I think we misunderstood one another this morning," he said, before Steve could say anything else.
Truthfully, if someone told Steve that, "You can come back to the lab and help me test out those new earpieces I made for our field communicators," was a lascivious fantasy for Tony, he'd have a hard time coming up with a solid argument against it.
Tony thought about arguing, but that was going to come perilously close to explaining the full situation to Steve, and he didn't want that. "Be there in just a minute," he said, and while Steve went off to see if he could locate some food, Tony finished his drink and ordered another.
"And I thought you were trying not to lie any more than you had to," Steve said. "That you were pretending to be involved with a man as a favor to me, and that was all."
Steve shook his head. "I like this better," he said. "I know neither of us is exactly a college kid, but they asked us, and I think it'd mean more to them than it would to the Stark Industries people." He smiled. "Having you on the float might even make it harder for them to enjoy themselves. You
He set it down on the floor by the bed, and Tony looked down to see three jars of water--one large and two small--and what might have been a sponge.
He thought he liked it, though. It captured a lot of the movement and energy of the fight, cartoonish or not.
"We should probably huddle up to conserve warmth, anyway," Tony said, and led the way into the bedroom like he had absolutely no doubts that Steve would follow instead of changing his mind.
“You didn’t hurt anything,” he said after a moment. “All you do is come in and go to sleep, and by the time I wake up in the morning, you're always gone. You don't even surprise me, at least not after the first time; JARVIS lets me know you're on your way.”
"Just some sketches," Steve said. "That mission I told you about, with Rhino? I wanted to capture the way he looked when he realized who had him cornered. I've been drawing a lot lately, making sketches of the things the team has been doing."
Tony’s doing fine, his hand on his companion’s arm, long fingers stroking the fabric of the man’s sleeve, and Steve has to remind himself that he’s supposed to be serving food, not glaring at one of the guests.
"That's a very healthy attitude," she said. "But tell me, how come we hadn't heard about this before now?"
After all, he was still bisexual, and he still meant everything he'd said. Including every single word he'd said about being in love with Tony, for that matter.
Then again, if Tony were here, this conversation wouldn't be needed at all. If Tony were here, a lot of things would be better.
Steve Rogers was the most infuriating person Tony had ever met, and Tony had loved him--not quite since the day they met, but for nearly that long.
"Well," he said, once he could get his suddenly parched tongue to work, "I guess I could coddle you a bit."
"That's a safe bet," Clint said, "but the thing is, we're all used to you doing obnoxious things by now."
"Not really," Tony said. "Maybe a little, if you're going to tell me you had time to think about it and I'm really not your type. But no. I'm not that kind of a coward."
"So you'll learn," Tony said. "I'm not sure I know how to be serious about anyone. I'll learn. We're both smart guys. We'll figure this out."
As tired as he was, he lay awake for an hour or so, listening to the soft sounds of Tony’s breathing.
"Because," one of the organizers said, "once Captain America and Iron Man take the stage, everyone's going to be all about you guys. I mean, you're great, we need the high-profile support, we're happy you're here, but I have to be realistic."
Steve sometimes found it a little embarrassing how quickly his body reacted to stimuli, ever since Project Rebirth--though at least he had a lot more control over himself than he had in the first few days after the serum--but today, he couldn't be bothered. First of all, this wasn't a few minutes of kissing; this was the culmination of months of being driven slowly out of his mind by Tony.
But there would be this, at least, and it was so much more than the "nothing" Steve had come to expect that being disappointed wasn't even a possibility.
Tony's body language relaxed, suggesting a slight thaw toward Steve. "All right, I can understand that. It's happened to me a time or...twenty, at least." Then he shrugged. "If that's all you wanted to talk to me about, though, I'm going to get down to the lab and get to work."
So Tony opened his eyes again, made himself look directly at Steve as Steve's cock pushed into him. There was a moment when he couldn't stop his eyelids from fluttering closed, as he breathed slowly and shallowly until he adjusted to the feeling of fullness (he was fine, but Steve was
Maybe all that would stop now, if they were so disgusted by the idea that Steve was involved with a man. Maybe they'd find someone else to serve as their poster boy for all the causes that had made Steve angry in the forties. They disgusted him even more now, when people had had so many decades to learn better.
"Okay, then," Tony said. "We'll finish eating. We'll go for a walk afterward and get you a slice or something, enough to hold you over until we're back home. And maybe ice cream," he added. "It'll look good if someone takes a picture of us. The two of us, hand in hand, with ice cream cones? So wholesome it hurts."
(Steve knew he could have JARVIS order him another set of white sheets, or at least a replacement pillowcase, but it wasn't as if the lavender one was unusable. It just looked odd.)
Steve kept stroking Tony through his orgasm, not taking his hand away until Tony shook his head. "Too much," he said, and Steve moved his hand to rest on Tony's hip instead.
Tony risked opening one eye partway to try to see Steve's expression. It was blank. Probably Steve was trying not to accidentally say something bigoted, while simultaneously being shocked and horrified.
Steve shook his head, even though Tony couldn't see him. "I don't need anything," he said. "I just…"
magazine, at least in part so that he could follow what Tony was talking about. Tony had already been in love with Steve before he'd found that out, but that had made him fall even harder.
To distract himself, Steve finished the quick sketch of cartoon-him sitting on his cartoon bed, adding details to his cartoon sketchbook, then turned his attention to the other side of the page.
"Definitely not," Tony assured him. "If you'd been subtler, I would have told myself that you didn't mean anything by it, because people were different back in your day."
"Besides," Tony continued, "this is going to be so much fun. I get to annoy jackasses for a good cause, we can make a spectacle of ourselves, and I get to show up at charity events with Captain America on my arm. I like it when at least half the room is jealous of me."
Steve hadn't actually planned that. He'd thought they'd kiss for a while here in the elevator, but eventually, they'd have JARVIS turn it back on and continue up to Steve's apartment or the penthouse.
Tony's old arc reactor would remain in the pocket dimension Dr. Strange had found, with Ultron trapped inside it.
Steve still didn't say anything. Tony saw his jaw tighten as he very definitely didn't say anything, and he wondered what it was that Steve was trying so hard not to say.
Tony might not have been a cat, but he definitely wanted Steve to pet him. He didn't pull away, because Steve would either feel bad about touching him or ask questions, but he made himself hold still.
"Good to know," Steve echoed, even though he saw Tony's eyes before Tony turned away, and they made him think of ice.
Steve shrugged and hoped he didn’t look as guilty as he felt right now. He should have. Or at least he should have talked to Tony before now.
It wasn't fair. Tony wasn't ashamed or even embarrassed, while Steve's face was hot and his stomach was twisted into knots.
Last night, he'd gone to Steve's apartment. He'd been expecting a no--after all, this wasn't on Steve's terms, and Steve did like things to function according to his terms--but Steve had smiled warmly and offered him a beer. They'd sat in Steve's barely-furnished living room and made conversation while they'd drunk their beers. It had been one of the times when Tony let himself believe that they might actually be friends.
Tony thought about asking him to wait, at least long enough that he could explain how Tony had been an idiot, but then he realized that one, he wasn't going to ask Clint to explain things to him--if it was obvious enough that Clint could figure it out, it was obvious enough that Tony could, too--and two, it wasn't like Clint would, either, at least not without a lot of smugness.
"Have you seen anything we can use to pass the time?" Steve asked. "I know we can't read any books they left, but there might be something like a pack of cards. If we can't adapt them to match a standard deck, we could probably make something up."
Tony and Tricia finished exchanging contact information--Steve knew that Tony had a phone number just for giving out in situations like this, one that JARVIS filtered for him, so at least he didn't have to worry that Tony would acquire a nuisance because he tried to be nice to Steve. And the fact that this was all in support of the act didn't mean that Steve couldn't appreciate it.
"Or maybe I just want you in my bed," Tony said. "I've wanted that for a while, actually. I just--" He shook his head. "I couldn't ever be sure, with you, and I couldn't risk screwing things up. Which you have to admit, we're both good at doing, at least with each other."
"Also," Steve said, "Young love? I'm probably older than your grandparents." Marian looked to be in her late thirties--older than Steve looked right now, but still, probably not born in 1918.
"I'm not saying I approve." And if they'd really been a couple, Steve would have made a point of getting Tony in bed at a decent hour. Though if they'd really been a couple, Steve would have had a fairly strong lure to use. "I'm just saying that arguing with you isn't likely to work."
The flicker of disappointment in Tony's eyes was so quick that Steve couldn't be completely certain that it had really been there.
The remnants of his upbringing, nearly a century ago, wanted to protest that there was something wrong about that, but Steve squashed it. It wasn't wrong. That was something this new century understood better than Steve's time had.
Steve shook his head. "They didn't know. I didn't know I was going to say that, until I did." Tony looked visibly upset; if Steve had known it would bother him that much for Steve to make a statement without talking to him first, Steve would have tried harder to stop himself from blurting out the truth.
"Could you--" Steve paused, trying to think how to word this. "I'm still feeling awkward about this. Can you do the same things you're asking me to do? At least right now."
Tony shrugged. "I'm also not the kind of guy who either proposes marriage or gets proposed to, so I don't have to worry about it."
"I guess I do," he said, "but tell me again about how Widow's stings weren't strong enough to take out Rhino? I need to fix that for her."
Steve cleared his throat a few times, feeling his face get hot. He closed his eyes, telling himself that Tony was here, that they were lying together on Steve's bed in the dark, and that made everything easier. A little easier, anyway.
Today, though, it seemed like the best way to go about it. It would be hard for Steve to avoid him if he didn't know that Tony was looking for him. So he got JARVIS to confirm that Steve was in his quarters, and then went straight there without giving Steve a heads-up first.
No matter what Steve had said a few minutes ago, he'd changed clothes; he was wearing a loose, long-sleeved top that zipped, and a pair of pants in the same material, both in shades of brown, and he'd exchanged his boots for shoes that could also have convincingly been slippers. "I decided to let my uniform dry."
Steve might rip his damaged heart to shreds, but Steve wouldn't hurt him, and Steve didn't even know that Tony had a heart to be broken.
"I mean when. The smartest man I've ever met is working on getting you back here. I have faith in him."
"You'd better not be talking about Sam." Tony didn't give Steve time to answer that. "They're for me, huh? What are you drawing for me?"
Steve's own speech was more of the same, but he let himself inject a more personal note to it: this was something he'd never even imagined as a possibility, when he was young. He'd imagined being able to live openly with a man, not having to fear arrest or ostracization, and even that had seemed like a wild dream. And now, here in the city where he'd been born, it was a reality.
"Lot of people out there who aren't women," Tony said, and the bottom dropped out of Steve's rationalizations.
Tony had been sorting out Steve's plates and silverware--the stuff his mother left him would come with him to Tony's house (
"It turns out that it's possible to have a little too much Tony Stark, at least if he's your only option for conversation,
"Fair," Tony said. "I just didn't know what to expect from you. I mean, first you draw dirty pictures for me, and then you get shy. Don't get me wrong, both of those are just fine with me, but I think I'm getting whiplash."
Steve didn't think Sam would have much trouble with that. Hulk wasn't any happier about abandoning Tony in Strange's pocket dimension than the rest of them were, and Bruce would be a lot more help in solving that problem than Hulk would.
"As long as I can take my time," he said, and if he hadn't been watching, he'd have missed the flash of disappointment.
"Telephones in your bedroom? I guess so." Steve's own phone rarely rang; when it did, it was usually someone from SHIELD, or one of the team. He didn't need to be able to take calls in his room.
"Another canceled speaking engagement?" Natasha asked, looking away from the maps JARVIS was projecting for her for a moment. Steve didn't know anything about them--he'd never even heard of Bagalia, though geography hadn't been his best subject in school--so it was probably a SHIELD mission, not anything for the team.
He wasn’t as tired as Tony. Even Sam, who’d been in the lab with him, wasn’t as tired as Tony, partly because he had the energy of youth on his side, but also because a few times when Steve had poked his head in to see how things were going, he’d found Sam curled up in a corner, catching a nap.
There weren't any alarms going off, or any sounds other than the normal noise of the city outside his windows, so he reached out to turn on the lamp near his bed.
Steve shifted position on the bed, leaning back on the pillows propped against his headboard. He stretched his legs out, wondering if he should get up and undress. He decided against it, for now, but he undid the button of his pants, tugging the zipper down slightly. If he needed to undress further, later, he could.
"'S okay," he mumbled. "We can pretend this didn't happen." This was the best of the plausible scenarios he'd envisioned if Steve found out.
And yes, he and Steve had been yelling at one another, which was probably why neither of them had noticed the ring of unnatural light appearing in the air next to them until it swallowed them up.
Without discussing it, they both seemed to have decided that they were taking a break, at least from their individual projects. Steve had some suggestions for simulations to be programmed into their training room, and he and Tony kicked those ideas around for a while until Tony nodded.
Now Steve didn't look angry. He looked tired, just like he'd said. "All right," he said. "I guess I owe you that much." He got up, crossing the room to join Tony on the couch.
"I'm fine, but thanks," Steve said. "I found the bathroom, too." He waved his hand in the direction of another, narrower, doorway that Tony hadn't noticed earlier.
"I see what you mean," Steve said. "So that explains why you're over here, but there's no reason you should have to sit here alone with nothing to do but drink." He put a hand on Tony's arm. "There's an empty table right there. Come on, let's go and sit down. I'll see if I can snag us some hors d'oeuvres. You need something to soak up the alcohol."
Steve managed a weak smile at the equally weak joke. He picked up his mug again while Tony poured himself a drink.
When he'd found out how things had changed between his time and the twenty-first century, Steve had realized that it would be possible for him to be honest about himself. But he'd also quickly discovered that being Captain America, in the twenty-first century, meant that way too many people thought they had a right to all the details of his personal life.
"So you draw when you talk to me," Tony said, when Steve didn't answer right away. "If you're bored, you know you don't have to--"
"One, the kids' matchmaking worked out pretty well in the end," Steve said. "And two, I'm not matchmaking. I'm just providing opportunities for Thor and Bruce to interact. If they don't hit it off, they don't hit it off."
Steve grinned. "I have a handful of sketchbooks and a shield," he said, "and you can't have the shield."
It was dark purple and speckled with whitish seeds. Not the most appetizing thing Tony had ever seen, but far from the worst. "Pretty straightforward," he suggested. "That might be a safe route to take."
He'd been furious with Tony before, to the point where he'd decided that he didn't want to be part of the same team, but he'd never decided he didn't want Tony in his life.
"Okay," Tony said. "I don't need you to. I'd have preferred a heads-up, but I see why that didn't happen. So what did you want to talk about?"
Steve sat down now, on the other of the couches in the room. Tony didn't know why he'd had the decorators put two couches in this room. It wasn't like Steve was going to be throwing parties in here. It wasn't like Steve was going to be throwing parties, period, but if he did, he could have held them in the lounge. And having two couches made it too easy for Steve to put a lot of space in between them.
And then Steve's mouth quirked up in a smile. "Those beds aren't that big, but they could fit two if they don't mind not having a lot of personal space."
After all, from his perspective, that was exactly how it had happened. The only lie would be that Tony felt the same way.
"Of course not," Tony said. "You don't have the technical skill. Even if you managed to program in the subroutines, it would probably end up humping your leg like a robot Great Dane."
"Ned, are you there too?" Tony called, putting down a newspaper-wrapped plate and going through into the living room.
Well, Tony would be tempted to find a big stupid stick of his own and smack Steve over his big stupid head with it. He wouldn't do it, but he'd be tempted.
"You know," Tony said, "right now would be a good time to go ahead and sound like an idiot, I'd say." He set down his coffee cup, but instead of letting his hand fall back to his side, he left it resting on the table. "So, was there anything you wanted to say to me?"
Steve was tempted, but kept going. The sooner they were in the elevator, the sooner they could be upstairs, where there was privacy. And a bed.
"I know," Steve said, still gently wiping every trace of what they'd done from Tony's body. "I'm doing this because I want to. Let me."
Marian, the emcee, nudged her partner with her elbow. "Ah, young love," she said. "We were like that once, weren't we, Kate?"
The dinner was... well, banquets like this hadn't actually improved since Steve had been paraded around with the USO. It wasn't bad, though, and Tony was doing his best to be charming to the other people at the table: two of the award winners and their plus ones, and the emcee of the event and her partner.
Yeah, they probably were, and Tony revised his plans for dinner downward a little. "For the love of god, no plaid," he said. "But beyond that, I trust you. You won't need a tie, though."
