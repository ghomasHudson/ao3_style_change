Cas [8:37 PM]: Sam did.
Anyway, he’s here now. Scrubbing at the enamel of the bathtub with too much force, trying to get rid of the limescale that has been slowly but surely pissing him off more every week. His heart is still beating a tad too fast, his sight has gotten progressively blurrier the longer he keeps going and he can’t even blink it away because the pressure behind his eyes just continues to build.
"'Course I do." He squints his eyes at Sam, hand pulling the trunk closed already, when he pauses. Should he?
________
“Don’t put the new stuff in the front. By the time we reach the old ones they’ll have gone bad.”
Dean shrugs his shoulders, picks up another fry, and grins. “What can I say, people love me.”
Dean thinks, and feels his heart break all over again.
“A few days ago.”
“Yes.”
His touch to Cas's shoulder is hesitant and barely there but Cas reaches back for him anyway, snuffling drowsily but obviously wide awake, and lets him move in close until their legs finally manage to tangle and all he breathes in is Cas.
“You really should head to bed, Dean.”
Sam [7:36 PM]: Found you more furniture for the apartment. A dresser and a bed.
With a sigh, he throws the comforter set and the sheet into his shopping cart and returns to his more personal shopping trip. Because if he’s already here, he might as well.
“Kind of forgot about the whole thing. I'm sure I can swing something though. Bobby won't mind me coming in late if my work gets done.” With a quirk of his lips he continues, “Being the boss' family sure does have its perks.”
For now, Dean just likes his reply and continues walking.
“A lot actually. Just”-Dean reaches inside his jacket, pulls out the letter-“you should have this first.”
It also means there's a reason to reach out again tomorrow, thanking and talking to each other. It keeps the feeling of not being alone during Christmas alive far longer. Something Dean always appreciates.
Dean [3:47 PM]: Hardy har har.
"You could've had it. You could've-" Dean's voice breaks and the next noise that leaves his throat is too animalistic, reminds him too much of an animal suffering before being put down. And doesn't that sound like an all to fantastic idea? But that's not-
'Being nice' has never been an issue with Professor Milton before and something in Dean's brain finally clicks. “Have you done anything lately? Besides working I mean?”
“We don’t do drunk dialing!” she says.
“You sure you don’t want anything from the diner, kid?”
But his stomach twists and turns with the inherent unfairness of it all.
Dean [2:13 AM]: Charlie. I need your help.
Sam [9:07 PM]: Good to know you’ve got your priorities straight.
Dean [8:05 AM]: Bobby doesn’t appreciate the thought and planning I put into grocery shopping.
“Remember when Sam called and told you Eileen was pregnant?”
He leans in again, drags his hands back up into Cas's hair to tilt his head, deepening the kiss. There's no resistance, just Cas following him. For a second at least before he takes a step back, breaking the kiss and most of their physical contact. He looked disheveled before but now he looks positively wild. Like he's ready to just jump Dean right there in the kitchen. It's written all over his face.
Cas [3:16 AM]: Sorry for falling asleep on you.
Cas [8:55 PM]: Doesn't really work in your favor if you do.
He flops back down, pulling his sheets up over his shoulders, and curls onto his side. Barry the grain pillow stares at him, a pesky little smile stitched onto its face. He groans and squeezes his eyes shut. He’s so fucked.
It startles Dean, makes his gaze snap back from where Billie had just been - isn't anymore because she's dead now, gone and stuck forever in the Empty.
Dean [8:30 PM]: You, too.
Then again if there’s no one here to keep him company but himself, if there’s no one there to make this feel like home but him, then maybe he should try to figure that out. Because in the end, no one else will. And maybe those two shoe boxes and the stack of pictures he left with them are a perfect starting point to figure out what he wants his new home to be like, to feel like. Maybe dealing with the painful parts first will make the rest that much easier.
Charlie [8:01 AM]: I saw your face every waking hour for a while there and I would’ve let you stay even longer.
“I know that.” Cas eyes narrow. If Dean didn’t know better, he’d be worried. But if there’s one thing he knows it’s cars and he knows that Cas knows that. So really, this is just Cas being embarrassed and acting like he isn’t. Which to be fair, Dean gets that. It’s not like he didn’t consider running yesterday. Though he, you know, actually saw Cas and wasn’t just playing chicken with a possibility. That Dean spent the better part of the last three hours torn between wanting to run into him again and not wanting to see him, doesn’t matter.
Later that night, when everybody has left again, Dean lies awake, watching the light of the moon shifting over the far wall of his room. Behind him, he can hear Cas breathing, a steady in and out rhythm that should lull him in. But tonight it’s too close, too strong of a reminder that they are technically breaking rules.
That his mind inadvertently trips down stairs it shouldn't even get close to anymore, is a problem he'll deal with whenever he feels ready. Barry the grain pillow is his only judge anyway.
“Well, maybe I'd still rather hear it from you, though.”
, Dean’s the dumbest person in the whole wide world because it’s so fucking obvious now. All that time spent wallowing in his own misery while Cas the poor bastard couldn’t possibly have any idea of why Dean suddenly did a 180 and fucking left him. And the way he pushed against every ounce of interest Dean still showed him after because he must have been so hurt. And then during the past few days, still showing so much care and compassion for Dean despite all that, even though he couldn’t possibly have deserved it from Cas's point of view. It surely all comes down to how he never was the one who fell out of love.
Dean [9:54 PM]: Why were you in town?
Dean checks his watch, it’s past seven already. He really lost track of time there and god he's not even hungry. He shakes his head and hopes being close to tears didn’t leave too much obvious damage behind. “Lost track of the time, sorry.”
attached because they lived there for over two years and they’ve been sharing their spaces even longer.
And maybe it's because Dean doesn't want to ruin the hopes he has for the short time they have to be together.
“Dean-”
“Just give me a second.” With a sigh, he lifts the phone to his ear again. “You still there?”
Dean [1:15 PM]: Just found another reason to be pissed at him.
Cas says, “Nothing will happen,” and it’s enough to pull Dean back from fidgeting with the keys of the Impala. “The likelihood of dying in a plane crash is minuscule in comparison to dying in a car crash. So maybe I should force you to walk back instead.”
Dean clears his throat. “Why did you never tell me you were this close to finishing?”
Things happen quickly from that point on and between finding his father on the kitchen floor, conscious but barely so, not obviously hurt but wrong — another stroke. It’s another stroke, Dean already knows it without fail and he’s going to throw up — and getting his father to the hospital somehow — it’s a wonder they make it in one piece and he thinks belatedly that maybe he shouldn’t have been driving at all because he’s possibly in the middle of a fucking panic attack. He should have been smarter, should have called 9-1-1 directly and he’s vaguely aware of yelling for somebody’s help, while they stumble into the emergency room. There’s a bustle of activity then, someone taking his father away, somebody asking Dean questions that he answers to his best abilities and then gentle hands coaxing him into sitting in one of the waiting room chairs. A minute later a plastic cup of water gets pressed into his hands and a steady voice tells him that it’s a good thing he brought his father here and that he needs to breathe.
“Fuck you and your stupid rules!” Dean presses in closer, gets right in his father’s face. “You have no right, no fucking right, to talk about him like that. He’s so much better, so much more of a man than you will ever-”
“It’s Charlie’s. She drove us to the wedding.” He keeps his voice as steady as he can but there’s a breathiness to it that’s utterly ridiculous.
And that's all they say for the rest of the night. Just staying on the phone until they fall asleep, listening to each other breathing.
"Ha. Getting sentimental in your old age?"
"Only two more nights after this one left."
He does.
When he steps back into the living room after a quick trip to the bathroom and now dressed in sweatpants and a sweater, Cas is back on the couch, one leg tucked underneath him while the other foot remains planted on the ground. He’s got the remote in his hand and his eyes are fixed on the TV, absorbed by whatever is on and is that-
The light brushing through the curtains catches on the towel. It flickers like a halo around Cas' head. He just looks up at him, eyes big and wide. Expectant. And they've been here before and nothing's changed between them except everything has.
“It’s fine.”
. Charlie’s living room is the safest space they’ve had since their last morning in Boston. “It’s kinda embarrassing.” “I think it’s nice that you’re this comfortable around them.” Cas shrugs his shoulders but there’s still a smile while he draws his fingers along the lines of Dean’s face, starting on the edges and then following his cheekbones inwards. “And I think they appreciate knowing that. Charlie certainly looked very happy about it.”
Dean [5:50 PM]: Doesn’t have to be perfect and I’ll pay for the materials of course.
Absolutely not what he meant to say but apparently he left both his filter and common sense back in the Impala and only took his treacherous heart with him. Well, in for a penny, in for a pound. Though it’s really no fun to watch Cas's face freeze, eyes widening and mouth slightly open, before it turns into a scowl. There’s an almost dangerous glint in his eyes, one that’s clear on how the ice Dean’s walking on already has several cracks.
He realizes with a start that he really hasn’t given a single thought to even the basic concept of getting his things from Boston to Lawrence so far. How is he supposed to do that? Driving back and forth during a single weekend is literally impossible, no matter how much he enjoys driving. So he’ll need to take time off too — he isn’t even going to think about how much it’s going to cost him for gas right now.
. Sam and Eileen would have been in over their heads, having already too much on their plates with college, part-time jobs, and raising Oliver. So Dean being able to take that worry off their hands while also giving them another free option for a babysitter? Ideal and he’ll gladly run himself ragged if it means he’s helping the people he cares about.
I am very pleased to offer you the official position of Dean Winchester's boyfriend. This is a full-time position of at least 40 hours a week - specific workdays and hours may vary over time. Your salary will be paid in conversations, cuddles, kisses, and a regular choice during movie nights.
and stops.
“Nah, I'm good.”
Dean [10:08 PM]: I know how hard you worked for this.
"Fucking years," Dean hisses to himself and only when he's back working, head again under the hood of some car - what was he even supposed to fix here? - and Bobby grumbling about how he liked him better last week when he obviously wasn't in love and such an idiot, does he realize how stupid this is. And the laugh burst out of him.
By the time he feels steady enough to deal with the reality of the situation again — deal with the fact of what he just thought, if only for a second — his phone has notified him of two more calls and a few texts. When he gets it out of his pocket, still sitting on the floor of the bathroom stall, he finds all calls to be from Bobby because of course, he should have been at work by now, probably, he has no sense of time anymore. The texts are from Sam, asking if he got too drunk to remember how to get to work and oh god he has to break the news to Sam.
“Kitchen,” his father grunts and Dean looks at him a second longer, taking note of how one side of his face doesn't quite move when he frowns. It’s better than it was a week ago but it’s still noticeable, still not like it should be. When Dean doesn’t leave, his father looks over at him, asks, “What?”
Dean lowers his eyes, focuses on a dirty spot on the carpet — he really should do a better job at cleaning. His voice feels hollow when he responds with, “Got it. Your house, your rules.”
“I swear you’re being obtuse on purpose.” Charlie’s rolling her eyes again and Jo’s full-on laughing at him. “Think about it. You broke up with him out of nowhere, broke his heart. But when he runs into you again six months later he still talks to you, even flirts. And beyond that, he goes as far as seeking you out because he still wants you in his life apparently despite you being the asshole in his version of the scenario. Then you show up and tell him, hey still in love, and here’s why we broke up. So just for a second think about him getting this info and now having to process that. Because you aren’t the only one who didn’t question why you two broke up, and I don’t know him as well as you do but I do know that Cas will blame himself for this just as much.”
Cas [8:54 PM]: If you honestly want to apologize then don't get mad at me for being busy.
So Dean says, “I promise,” and after a second adds “If I break that, you can have Baby,” just to see Cas laugh wetly and roll his eyes.
But fuck if he cares.
In fact, it kind of told Dean everything he needed to know about how bad he felt for even bringing it up in the first place. Which is stupid.
He’s met with a resounding “Yes!” from Oliver and a calmer “I’d like that,” from Cas.
“Made me sick to realize that I felt relieved at the idea that it’d be over, that maybe I wouldn’t have to worry anymore.” Dean closes his eyes for a second, breathes against the nausea that creeps up at the thought even now. It’s duller than before but it’s still there. “It’s just not fair that he keeps doing this to me. To Sammy, too. We deserve better. But at the same time,” he opens his eyes again, focuses back on Cas, “I still fucking care. Even if I should know better. Even if I thought that.”
But that’s not something he can unpack here. So he says, “I’m sorry,” and leaves the three of them standing there.
“You're good though?”
Not because of the cars Dean has to take care of but because he can't quite focus and it's messing with him and whenever he's left alone with his thoughts for too long, there's suddenly a smile on his face and he just wants to not be here anymore.
Cas [8:34 PM]: Didn't we plan on talking today?
He’s maybe a little embarrassed at how everything in him snaps to attention at the harsh tone of Cas's voice but what the hell. He swallows and then meets Cas's eyes again. “I fucked up, Cas.”
There's another one of those looks from his brother and Dean is so close to just standing up and leaving. He just wanted Sam in on this so that he didn't have to worry and could just keep focusing on Oliver and Eileen and acing college. Nothing in his plans said, be told off by your little brother for doing what you should be doing. Nothing in his plans said, talking about Cas's thoughts on this.
When he checks his phone again later, there's - among others - a like from Cas. And another DM.
No, nothing like it because now, now he's the same in body and feeling if not in mind and the reaction he's getting is not just stimulation but the complete deal, the whole this is new once more thing - not that new and blood flicker through his mind and his teeth catch, drawing a soft groan.
“Tell me?” Dean says and when Cas looks at him, offers a hopefully encouraging smile.
Short and to the point and it makes an unreasonable amount of anger rear its head inside of Dean. He feels oddly reminded of trying to win the fight against Oliver when he was adamant about not wanting to eat anything the color green. There was a reason behind it but it had made sense to no one but the kid. Skipping out on your health check-ups after a stroke that’s not even a year in the past, seems to fall right in line with that. Anybody would question it. But Dean takes it as a personal offense.
“Look, buddy,” he starts after a while because he knows he's been quiet for far too long. “Cas and I, we-”
Cas [10:08 PM]: If you’re fine then you wouldn’t have declined my call.
“A letter I wrote. To you.” Dean shoves his now empty hands into the pockets of his jacket, anything to stop them from shaking. Anything to stop them from reaching for Cas. “I sent it to you in February.”
Because apparently he’s been doing a damn fine job of pretending to be getting over Cas and had in fact done none of the getting over Cas whatsoever. He really should have known.
But he wasn’t even able to do that for him because he wasn’t there.
For a split second Dean considers telling Cas that he wants to marry him while they are standing at the security check, not yet in line but close by because time’s ticking. The idea of giving him that promise along onto the flight, back to Boston, and as company for their empty apartment sounds nice. It would certainly lessen the distance and yet make it even more unbearable.
He wanted them but he didn’t want to see them. Didn’t want to be reminded of all the good memories connected to the things inside. But Cas had taken that decision from him, had stuck them into a bigger box with Dean’s family pictures and cassette tapes, and had given that to Benny with everything else. Dean’s not sure if Cas did it because he thought they were important to him — they are — or if he just wanted to give them away like he’d intended to do before Dean had started his own collection with them out of sight.
"Yes?"
“You got it, kid.”
Still happy.
“Yeah, between job one and two, babysitting and acting like I’m going to yell at you if you leave a plate next to instead of in the sink.”
Dean [2:23 AM]: I don't know. Just. Something's weird.
He's in bed within seven minutes - not that he's keeping track - only the dim light of his phone lighting up the room and Miracle does come to join him within the few more minutes it takes Cas to come back to the phone. She patiently waits for Dean's explicit invitation and then jumps up onto the bed once it's given, curls up directly behind his knees. He scratches her head while he waits, the phone pressed to his ear already.
If there's anyone that has mastered the art of sounding put out but supportive it's Cas and Dean wants to comment on it, wants to pull on this conversation. Make it unravel into the peaceful words from five minutes ago when everything was okay. Not good but okay and that was enough. But he knows that it's gone for the night, that there's no time, so he only says, “I love you.”
They bask in the silence for a moment, only broken by both of them still sniffling from time to time. Really though, two grown-ass men crying during their own love confession, if that isn't a chick-flick-moment if Dean has ever seen one. None of their friends will ever let them live this down when they'll hear it. He really doesn't care. Maybe he shouldn't get ahead of himself though. "Cas?"
The answer or any words for that matter get stuck in Dean’s throat. He wets his lips.
Maybe he can’t say what he wants to but he forces out, “I’m leaving in March.” Because that is his win in all of this. He won’t stay here in this house forever. There’ll be a point when all he does is visit again, always a set point for departure upon arrival. A point where he’ll once again do what he wants whenever he wants and his father won’t be able to stop him.
Sam just rolls his eyes and continues perforating his salad.
Cas rolls his eyes but when he pushes at him again, Dean settles back into the driver seat. He straightens out his jacket, runs a hand over his hair, and puts the key into the ignition. Next to him Cas squirms in the most obvious way and pulls on the leg of his pants. Dean cracks up. “Missed me, huh?”
Cas [5:56 PM]: What if you forget something on the list?
Well seeing him ended there. But thinking about him didn’t. He’d stuck in Dean’s mind all damn day and followed him
Dean remembers Cas looking at him like he was crazy when he had jokingly offered to force-feed him if he couldn’t be bothered to do it himself. He also remembers Cas telling him very quietly, eyes downcast and face withdrawn, how shutting down hunger long enough to forget it had become a necessity for him for a while there but that he only ever really reverted to it for too long anymore when he was stressed. He had iterated that he was fine and that Dean didn’t need to worry.
From that point, they sit in silence and wait.
Cas [6:14 PM]: I see.
Something he really could use a lot more of.
Cas: [10:15 PM]: No.
The notice that Beekeeper Cas (adorned by a flower and a bee because Cas could for the love of God not be talked out of it) has sent him a DM, taunts him and he can see that there's a link in the preview but it takes all the courage he has to open the message and click on it.
It's noon when Dean realizes that it's literally the day before Christmas and he still doesn't have a present for Cas. He drops his head onto the desk, pushes the documents he's sorting through to the side – Tuesday is his office day and he hates it with a passion.
There's some more murmured conversation that Dean can't quite make out and then the front door clicks shut. While he doesn't stop cleaning, he straightens up a little. Anticipation mostly but also just because he feels more alert again, like all the energy that the evening zapped from him, is slowly but surely returning.
“Of course he did.” Dean purses his lips and swallows down the comment about how for once his father is at least drinking with a valid reason. Instead, he bites, “Good thing I know him so well and already bought his shit then.”
Cas [11:18 PM]: I do.
“Well, you'll have to soon.”
"I will."
She grins. “Go get your man.”
“Uncle Dean!”
Dean [9:06 PM]: We also both know that I’m not having any.
“Great.” Dean can’t help but smile. It’s stupid. He really shouldn’t be this happy about something that doesn’t even benefit him in the slightest. Except for where he knows Cas is good and taken care of.
“Uh touchy,” Dean hums, doesn't bother changing the subject though. For once he's in a good mood, Cas deserves to be too. And not just during the call. So sue him for badgering. It’s all he can do right now anyway. If he was with him, he could play other cards but this way there’s not much choice. “Which part is it this time? Your dissertation? Your students? Or did Milton rip you a new one again?”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas says and then he’s there, solid and warm and wrapped around him and Dean digs his fingers into his back, feels the stiff fabric of his dress shirt bunch and scratch underneath his fingertips. He presses his forehead into Cas's neck and shoulder, wishing he could be closer than this, could burrow in his pocket and never leave. Cas in turn holds him, both arms slung over his shoulders, one hand twisted into the hair at the nape of his neck, the other a blazing pressure on his shoulder even through two layers of fabric. His nose nudges against the side of his head and Dean feels small and like a child and it’s been so long since anyone has held him like this, like he’d splinter further if left to himself. But even with the ache in his chest so unbearable, he feels grounded, feels safe right here. And while he cries until he can’t anymore, Cas's hold on him doesn’t waver once. There are no empty platitudes either, no
"You made pie?" It's the most nonsensical thing he could have said because that was already perfectly clear.
Cas [8:23 PM]: Thank you again for fixing my car :)
“I know Boston gave you all those fancy little ideas about what's acceptable and I figured if I’d let you get it out of your system it wouldn’t become an issue in the long run. But it’s time to stop pretending and grow up, Dean.”
The lady at the post office had assured him that sending it over a week beforehand was plenty of time.
But between the hectic bustle of the airport, people rushing back and forth, and speaking into phones, it just feels wrong. Undeserving of what they should have. Not a huge and romantic gesture — that's really not them — but still thought out words, privacy, and certainly not Cas being stuck on a plane by himself afterwards. Though maybe Dean should do it just because Cas is going to step onto a fucking plane in a hot minute.
“No, I got that. I'm just”-Sam skewers some salad with too much vigor-“not quite understanding how you're managing that. Didn't you say you only got those six weeks off of work and that's probably all they'd give you?”
“Oh god no. Please, tell me you burnt that thing?”
He stares at her a moment longer, blinks. He lifts his hands automatically when he opens his mouth but lowers them again when he realizes he's blanking on any of the signs he would need. He feels heat gather in his face. He's not even sure if he bothered learning them, not even when he was still wide-eyed and hopeful and it makes him feel even worse. “Sorry,” he says but Eileen just continues smiling at him while she waits him out.
“I said eat, not drink.” He throws a glare towards Cas and flops down onto the couch.
Cas follows his instructions, takes a great deal of care when steering the Impala into its parking spot — another part that sold Dean on the place — but Dean keeps his eyes fixed on nothing because if he looks at him now for even a second, he’ll break. Do something stupid that he won’t be able to take back — like kissing him. He really doesn’t want to ruin this today of all days.
Notably, the state of the drawing room doesn't seem to match the meticulous, upper-class vibe of the house. To an outsider, it seems like someone’s been camping out in here for several days, though Sam knows Missy's brother only died yesterday morning. There's a box of tissues on the coffee table in front of him, and a wastebasket full of used ones off to the side. A bottle of antacid tablets has tipped over next to the tissues, and the rest of the table is littered with crumpled napkins and two precarious stacks of dirty plates, one in particular that looks like it could topple at any second.
It takes Cas a few minutes to unwrap and eat the three chocolate bars-- well, two and a half, since Sam's been going through one of them-- but once he does, he sits up a little straighter and meets Dean's eyes, then Sam’s.
Dean nods again and bites his lip, keeping his head down.
When Cas opens his eyes, it’s to a whirlwind of movement and music. He’s appeared in a crowded ballroom amidst a masquerade in full swing. All around him are colorful dancers of various sizes and dispositions, clad in gaudy costumes that Cas would guess aren’t from anywhere near the present century. Every one of their outfits is complete with a matching mask, sometimes held up with a handle, sometimes tied with ribbon around the back of their head, but almost all in the likeness of some horned animal. It gives Cas the creeps. He’d think he’d landed in one of Lucifer’s salacious revelries of old, had he not already known whose dream he was in.
She thinks. "Oh… chicken, mostly. I think. A couple of 'em. What I had in the freezer." She's fidgeting impatiently now, and her eyes dart back and forth between Sam and the nearly-bare bird on the table.
Something is amiss; the night creatures are eerily silent, alert. Waiting.
“He may still be alive. I don’t know for certain,” Cas says, and his eyes drop back down to the dead man. Dean inwardly celebrates his win in the staring contest Cas doesn’t even know he was a part of. “I haven’t found him yet. The plea was… very faint, almost inaudible. I may have been the only one close enough to hear it.”
it is he goes back to like this— it doesn't make his heart flutter like it did the first time. It’s a common courtesy, and the Winchesters are nothing if not courteous to their friends, even if they know Cas doesn’t need sleep. The gesture should be somewhat meaningless to an angel.
does that because he doesn't need to eat, and now
Sam doesn't help him. "You… you want to smoke weed with us?"
“Yes.”
Cas wipes his finger on his trenchcoat, leaving a light smear.
"Let me guess, he was going after all the roadrunners in town," Dean scoffs. "So, what are we thinking? Rugaru?"
Sam throws his hands up and thanks whatever deity listening that he already had his badge in one of them before he knocked. He lets it fall open in his palm.
Dean unsticks his throat and tries to assist. "No, like— you know, well done, medium, medium rare—"
Dean holds up one of the prints from the coroner's office, a closeup of Sandy Duvall's displaced hip, mostly clean besides a few clinging scraps of flesh and a set of long grooves gouged deep into the bone. "Bite marks, scratches?" Dean asks, still rifling through the stack and passing photos to Sam.
Resigned, Cas sighs and sits down on the edge of the bed, knowing he’ll just have to come out with it. “I heard your prayer.” Dean frowns, and Cas knows he's trying to reconcile that piece of information with what he remembers. “In your dream. Not a prayer, exactly, it was more like a… call.”
we got a bonus." Sam shoots him a puzzled look and Dean raises his eyebrows in return. "...You know. Cas?"
That same faint TV noise is still coming from behind Dean's door, and Cas stills as he approaches it, listening. There's no other noise. Just the waves of need and worry directed right at Cas, chilling him like a fever.
The waitress, of course, doesn't find anything wrong with that. "And how would you like that cooked?"
Cas seems surprised to find Dean trailing after him when he reaches his car. “Dean, there’s no need to accompany me to my vehicle.”
"Weed," Sam supplements.
"Here, this is-- I really only take one square at a time, but uh--"
Dean glowers at him. "What?"
"Yeah," Sam says offhandedly, still scanning whatever article he's reading. "So, it would make sense if, when they’re exposed to whatever this is, their body adapts to the food they're going to eat— like how vamps grow fangs when they’re turned. But…"
Crickets chirp lowly in the quiet of the night, still holding out their songs for the last dragging days of summer's end. Their calls are lethargic, slowing every day, fewer and fewer as the fall ever steadily approaches with its bitter winds and choking, cold hands. But for now, the late September air looms still and unusually heavy, hanging humid over the forest and pressing over the trees with a thick blanket of anticipation.
"'Course. What kinda animal they going with?"
"He could have made them with no natural predators, and taken the stinger off. Or created more pollen-spreaders," Cas continues thoughtfully.
"Right this way, Agent Feldman. Your partner is already in the morgue."
The gunshot ricochets far too loudly in the enclosed space, and the thing is instantly on its feet, scattering hay in its wake. The cacophony of cracks and pops that follow as it draws itself up to its full height in a series of halting, jerky movements is enough to make Dean’s hair stand on end. He barely gets a glimpse of a long muzzle that has to be a good eight feet up, all odd angles and sharp bloodstained teeth— and then the thing skitters straight up the side of the wall and smashes out the narrow window near the rafters.
The book isn't one Cas thinks many people have read, and it isn't one he wants the Winchesters to catch him reading, necessarily. That's why he keeps it in the kitchen, in a drawer he knows Dean doesn't use.
"If their body is accommodating this change, then why would it still kill them?" Cas wonders, frowning.
Dean shifts and mumbles in his sleep, and Cas is bombarded by another wall of wistfulness, this time accompanied with the barest whisper of frightened words.
They burst from the backdoor in a rush, brandishing their pistols. Nothing comes to meet them, no screeching monster, no teeth. The nightfall is just as quiet as it was when they arrived.
Or, Dean blinks, anyway. Cas doesn’t seem to have it in him. There’s something inscrutable on his face that Dean doesn’t think he wants to examine too closely.
"I…" He gulps, watches the way Dean is watching him, and decides he has the same answer for every option. "Yes." He lets the admission weigh on his tongue like a paste, ambiguous as it is, and waits for the verdict.
vaping. I have a pipe if you want to use that instead." He produces a light blue glass piece from his jacket pocket, setting it beside the vape, and gets to grinding. "I'm going easy on my lungs."
"Just inside here," the receptionist says, and she opens the door. “Agent Gaga?” she announces herself into the white-tiled room before them. Dean peers anxiously over her shoulder, tense, ready to reach behind his suit jacket and grab his pistol if he must.
Cas dimly reflects that he could probably send a little wisp of grace to help transform Dean’s dream into something more soothing, help smooth out the hard lines of his face and transfer him to a tropical beach somewhere with a fruity drink and a pair of sunglasses.
Dean is dreaming about being stuck in a room full of strangers, in an outfit he’d never be caught dead wearing in front of another hunter, desperately wishing for Cas. More specifically, for Cas to sweep him off his feet and play into the scene by giving him a magical, romantic ballroom dance. Like a couple in a movie. Even though Dean’s sworn for years that he doesn’t like men, even though he’s been careful not to give Cas more than a casual pat on the way by, or a hug, if he’s really feeling emotional. Nothing that might be misconstrued.
He takes a breath to say something, but he can’t remember how to speak any earth languages all of the sudden, and he doesn’t think he has the air to, anyway. So he doesn’t.
“Sure did. Had to print
Her eyes are red-rimmed, but the cascade of dark hair that fans around her face half-hides them from the mid-afternoon sun. She’s dressed in a dirty, torn-up pair of overalls, the straps of which are undone and hanging loosely around her waist, and a plaid shirt with the sleeves pushed up to her elbows.
Sam doesn't look up as he carefully sets a couple nugs in the grinder and forces the lid on. "It's a dry herb vape. And
Dream logic.
"Okay," Sam says, but the worry doesn't exactly leave his face.
"Yeah, Cas, yeah." Dean wipes his eyes, trying to remember what they called him for. "We were wondering if, uh-- uh--" the thought of asking Cas for snacks right now sends him into another fit of giggles. Sam reaches over to take the phone.
ordering a
Inexplicably, his tongue darts out to wet his lips, and Cas can’t
Sam puts his hands up in surrender. "Scout's honor."
So, he privately ignores the initial swell of fondness he felt at seeing Cas unexpectedly and trades it for an annoyance that is much safer, much more readily available. His fingers clench with the effort.
He spent most of the day in a slight panic that came and went whenever he was busy enough to actually forget for a hot second that Cas would be here today. And that they'd be seeing each other face to face today for the first time since that phone call and that they would be within touching distance - and that he'd be allowed to touch this time. Technically. A nagging voice at the back of his head keeps reminding him that they won't be alone and that he really doesn't want everybody else to catch on within seconds. That he needs to act normal and keep his shit together.
“Well, finish up here, I’ll make you a list.”
A huge "I miss you"
“Is it life-threatening?”
He’s suddenly fully aware again of where they are — Charlie’s place — how they shouldn’t be alone because there was a party going on a hot minute ago and how he apparently fell asleep in the middle of it. And sure he’s more than tipsy, has drunk more tonight than he has in weeks — possibly months even — and his constant state of exhaustion probably didn’t help either. So being buzzed and comfortable and tucked against Cas's side on the ratty couch in Charlie’s living room, surrounded by friends and so much positive energy just lulled him in far too quickly and everybody apparently just
Dean: [10:21 PM]: And before you ask, it was mutual.
Dean feels his jaw tighten and the words sit on his tongue, trying to fight their way out. ‘
Though he figures he might not have to worry about it much longer.
He wants to marry Cas.
“No, sir,” he grits out between his teeth and leaves for the kitchen. He's met by the heavy smell of whiskey hanging in the air and it settles heavily in his body with each breath. He presses his lips together. There's a broken bottle on the floor, amber liquid covering tiles, and splashed on the wood of the kitchen cabinets. He opens the window before even starting on the clean-up. Seems like his thinly veiled attempt of placing the alcohol deep within the cupboards to discourage his father from reaching for it, backfired spectacularly. But the alternative – properly hiding it or actually throwing it out – would be much worse. Because there's being stupid and then there's denying his father alcohol.
Cas furrows his brows, tilts his head. "Yes? Like I said in the group chat when we discussed who was bringing what."
It’s such a simple answer, yet it’s loaded and there’s so much that hangs in the silence that follows it. Hope mostly, Dean’s heart as well. This has to mean something, right?
Dean squeezes his eyes shut for a second, breathes deep. He's not going to freak out about this again. He loves Cas and Cas loves him. And it's the beginning of February now and the beginning of March is Dean's deadline for staying here. That's what the doctors told him was absolutely justified, that’s what he will tell his father when the letter is sent. Once he’s got an answer at the latest.
Nothing, exactly.
He gives himself a minute to wallow in self-pity, wracking his brain hard to maybe just maybe find something in his head. It just has to be something Cas mentioned at some point that he'd like to do or where he'd want to go. He can magic something out of that information. He always does.
“Promise, Charlie,” he says, voice low and secretive, “Everything’s fine.”
did have a nice ring to it but it’s certainly not all they’d been during the whole process — but in the end, it’s the thought. Just the idea that Cas looked at the finished product of hundreds of hours of his own life and thought that Dean deserved to be part of it even after the way things ended, even if he didn’t love him anymore. It was enough to make Dean a little teary. He was just really fucking proud of Cas and that it came with a bonus of apparently still being in the run for some form of best friend was a lot. In the best way.
“Hospital,” he forces out. “I’m at the hospital.”
"It's okay." He pulls open the door far enough to let Miracle back inside, walks with her into the living room. The Christmas tree in the corner is lighting the room up enough for him to be able to see and he sinks down onto the couch.
“It was ill-timed. I apologize.”
And when Sam comes home a bit later Dean hasn’t moved an inch and he doesn’t care in the slightest.
Cas licks his lips, brows furrowed, and takes it. He opens the envelope with too much care and then he's pulling a single piece of paper out, unfolds it.
“Yet you love me. Now, what does that say about you?” Cas is smirking, looking like the cat that got the cream. God, he's been here for a few hours and he's already driving Dean up the walls.
But it’s so much worse today.
There's an angry huff. Dean’s pretty sure it’s accompanied by an eye-roll. “Stop sending me money. I don’t need it.”
“Please.”
“Night, Cas.”
Yipping from behind the door nearly covers Cas's sharp inhale. "Dean."
“Dude, you’re smiling. At your phone. What the hell is going on?”
“Of course,” Cas says as if he’s simply been asked to set the table and then his hand is covering Dean’s. When Dean turns over his own hand, goes from holding onto Cas to holding his hand, Cas lets him.
Some days he even comes back to the crossword later and has new ideas and options that he missed the first round and manages to fill it in a tad bit more than the day before. Some days he even goes as far as to send texts and wonder at what his friends know and what they don’t and tease them either way. Some days he simply cheats and looks things up just to keep busy for a moment longer.
"Drink. And eat." It's not a request but an order. He presses both into his hands - he should have bought Cas dinner, he should have done so much - and while he drops the shirt on the bed, Cas holds out the bottle back to him. His hands still shake.
Sure there’d probably been changes to the exact wording —
“Three and a half weeks,” Cas repeats back to him.
Dean [10:05 PM]: Damn. Nice job!
He realizes that he’s just staring at Cas, when he raises an eyebrow, clearly waiting for some form of words — a greeting most likely — from him. And sure yeah, Dean can do that.
“And playing on the swings is like flying, right?” Oliver says and then his whole face lights up. “Oh! You should let Uncle Cas push you! He’s really good at it and then you don’t have to feel scared because he knows you don’t like being high up and won’t push you too much!”
He shrugs his shoulders, can’t bring himself to utter the one syllable. “It's not a big deal. I’m used to him losing track of time and neither of us tends to bother with birthday presents anyway.”
"You can have that."
Cas [7:52 PM]: Yes! :D
"I don't want to," Cas grumbles. "That'd mean tomorrow's Monday."
But he doesn’t have to figure it out right now. This is definitely a problem he can poke for a bit before actually touching it. In theory, he can let this rest for as long as he’s willing to pay the rent and won’t need the money elsewhere. For as long as it takes him to get some form of control over his emotions, push down enough of them to be normal about seeing Cas again. But in reality, Cas's patience will run out sooner or later — because even if he’s a stubborn asshole, he has a breaking point — and Dean will be forced to make his move without enough time to prepare.
Cas [10:10 PM]: I guess you’ll have to read it to find out ;)
Dean [7:06 PM]: Learn some self-preservation, man.
Dean goes for a smile that feels forced and too stiff before he makes his final escape to his bedroom. When he slips into his bed, it feels like heaven to his body — the couch really isn’t that comfortable — sheets cool and soft on his skin. But despite the weariness of his body, his mind stays alert, focused solely on the sounds coming from the rest of his apartment. He closes his eyes.
That's all they had said after Dean had started the car. No further words exchanged just futile glances. Dean wants to say something. Wants to ask Cas how he's feeling because it can't be good. He only caught the tail end of the conversation between him and that other angel. But he got the gist - there for Cas, not the baby, but for Cas because of his pain - and if that's not on him, Dean doesn't know what in his life is. His fingers are vibrating with the need to mention it, tapping away on the steering wheel to the sound of silence and breathing, but he can't unglue his lips from each other. The drives not long enough anyway.
Dean [9:25 PM]: It was kinda hilarious.
He grins, waggles his eyebrows and Oliver nods like he's just said the most serious and important thing in the world. And then he frowns, says with all the confidence and self-assuredness only a kid can possess, “But I like Uncle Cas the best.”
while being sad and Dean knows for a fact he himself looks like a mess. His next words come out bitter, “Then what are you saying?”
It seems to do the trick.
Taking Oliver to the playground wasn’t Dean’s smartest idea in the first place if only because it’s really fucking cold. But since they talked there’s been a constant itch under his skin to get Cas out of the house, get him away from his father so that he can shower him with all the love and attention he deserves without having to worry so much. So really, Dean did himself a favor when he asked Sam and Eileen if they’d be okay in handing Oliver over to them for the morning. Or so he thought.
“Then this is it.” Cas sounds apathetic like he was really just waiting for Dean to finally come around to the idea of them no longer being them.
“Look, I-” he starts, breaks off again, takes a deep breath. “I'm doing this because my shit’s still there, not to make you feel guilty or like a charity case.” He waits for Cas to respond but there's nothing on the other end. For a moment he wonders if he just left the phone to itself and maybe he has because if there's one person in the world that would leave a conversation in the middle of it, it'd be Cas. Nevertheless, Dean continues talking. Because talking means distracting his brain from the uneven thrum of his heartbeat and the tears still sitting in his eyes. “And believe me, I know you could somehow manage to pay rent by yourself. I mean, you've done that before, living off rice and broth for weeks because you needed money elsewhere. But look, man, you don't have to, is all I'm saying.”
And right smack dab in the middle, he finds an envelope that is far too familiar, that makes his breath catch and catch and catch while time slows down, stops. Dean's aware of the other envelopes slipping from his fingers but he can't focus on anything but his own handwriting, his own name in the top left corner, and the bright red
“Of course you do.” Dean shoots him a grin and mouths
“He's-” Cas makes a frustrated noise, his voice turning sharp, “That doesn't mean you have to give up your life for him.”
Cas [8:49 PM]: Of course. Get some rest :)
“Were you scared?” Oliver asks and actually holds his hands out to him, wordlessly asking to be moved to Dean’s arms and Dean will absolutely take that offer. The handover is made a little difficult by the fact that Dean’s fingers feel stiff with the cold and Cas doesn’t step away from him again, tucking himself into his side, hand back on Dean’s waist. But they manage and once he’s got Oliver safely propped up on his hip, he leans into Cas and presses a short kiss to his lips. He gets a smile in return.
This time Cas does turn, frowning and head tilting. The tiny bit of confusion doesn't mask his hurt though. Dean bites his tongue to keep himself from apologizing. It would only make things worse right now. He'll make it up when he can. Cas will understand.
“Squeaky ones. Kind of like a bird.”
The job is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s just what pays his bills and what helps keep a roof over their head. It’s what makes him able to not have to think too long about supporting Eileen and Sam if they need it. It’s what gives him autonomy over his own damn life. But it’s really not about any of that because underneath the surface it’s all Cas, Cas, Cas and being unable to return to him, be with him, go back to that normal life with him. If there’s already a crack there, it’ll only get bigger, more painful the longer this goes on and there’s so much more at stake here than just a job. Dean swallows. “I can find something here.”
- his brain yells at him, tries to force him back but instead, he leans in further.
“You pull this shit a second time, you can think again about living here for free.”
company. And maybe Dean should take that time he has as well, figure out what exactly he’ll say tonight and what he should at least try to leave out of any sort of discussion for now. If just to be on the safe side. He doesn't want to fuck this up worse just by trying to fix it.
Dean takes the last sip of his beer, shoots Charlie a grin when she waves at him from the small area that barely deserves the name dance floor. Garth is there, too, having the time of his life. Dean can’t spot Jo right now but he’s got a feeling she’s cashing in at the poker table. And since all the people he’s actively here for are occupied and don’t seem to vie for his attention, he slips his phone from his jeans. He waves the bartender over for a fresh beer, gives him a grateful smile when he delivers quickly.
Dean wakes up covered in sweat, body frozen and mouth open around a wordless noise that stole the air right from his lunges. His heart is hammering in his chest and the moment drags on until he manages to will himself to move, to fight against the darkness by flopping his hand to the nightstand.
Dean [10:21 PM]: We broke up.
“It’s fine. You didn’t do anything wrong.” Cas looks away again, wets his lips. “You’re in an emotionally vulnerable position and I shouldn’t have be-”
Cas [6:02 PM]: Alright.
Dean [9:24 PM]: Aw, come on, Sammy!
Cas's reply is immediate, "It wasn't." Then almost too quiet, "I'd never do that."
Dean [6:31 PM]: Not if I can avoid it.
Cas [9:55 AM]: I'll be awake :)
“And what will you do if I, as you say, don’t care? Hit me?”
The fabric of Cas's trench coat rustles when he indicates and checks the rearview mirror. “You don’t have to worry about it.”
Dean looks back to Sam, shakes his head. “I wasn’t-” He glances at the clock on the wall, takes in the time but can’t register it past the fact that it’s going onto two in the afternoon and that he doesn’t know how long he hid in the bathroom. “I wasn’t here the whole time. Maybe there’s news and they just couldn’t find me.”
Pictures of us for prove of friendship
Dean blinks, stares blankly at the ceiling and despite the fact that he basically just got yelled at, he can't stop the warmth spreading in his body, the smile tugging at his lips. Fuck, he missed his voice. Him as well. He doesn't say any of that though. Because really what good would it do? Instead, he says, “Slow down, buddy. I have no idea what you're talking about.”
Cas [10:09 PM]: Would you like a copy?
On top of that, it’s not like it’ll be forever. Dean’s supposed to be here until the end of November. Long enough so that his father will be far enough into his recovery to hopefully be able to take care of himself again, as well as the usual mundane daily tasks you take for granted until you don’t. There are still some things left to figure out until then — when his father will be okay to drive again, whether or not he can be convinced to let a cleaning service into the house, things like that — but in the end, Dean can go back to Boston, to his own life, his job and regular nights out for pool and poker, back to Cas. Back to two or three visits a year and missing his nephew growing up, missing his oldest friends and the entirety of his ragtag family that came together in the weirdest ways and then just stayed around.
This time he doesn’t knock his glass over but he knows he looks startled by Jo’s sudden appearance — though who knows how long she’s been back in front of him. He wets his dry lips. “Why would I?”
"Right. Of course, you were."
“Then I’d tell you to seek professional help because it’s not healthy to hold a grudge for that long.”
So he tries laughing it off even if it comes out a tad too forceful. He wipes his hand on his jeans. “What about 'don't worry about him, I'm staying' doesn't work for you?”
Charlie [8:10 AM]: We can share.
Dean ducks his head, smiles. “I know, right?”
Somehow this hug feels much more like a hello than their airport greeting had felt. And there's something to be said about keeping things behind locked doors and in the darkness of a childhood room with fumbling memories long past forgotten but Dean just presses his nose harder into the soft fabric of Cas's sweater and the unyielding feeling of his body underneath.
Okay, maybe he should have let Cas know that he’d be still paying his part of the rent. He knows that Cas has hang-ups about accepting help from anybody ever, especially when it involves money. But it just had been instinctive to Dean and it’s not like he’s wrong. His things — clothes he’ll need soon because the weather is getting progressively warmer, but also stuff of sentimental value like his tape and record collection, family pictures — are still in that apartment, strewn across it with only a vague thought of
Cas [3:43 PM]: Can't make it tonight, something came up. I'm sorry :(
If he’s honest, he always comes up empty, when he thinks about a future in Boston for too long. Has for a while now.
“If it does Oliver good, go ahead.” It’s hard not to turn away from her and hide while saying the words. Because even if they have every right, just as Cas would, the thought alone — Cas being part of his family but not part of
“How was the wedding?”
That's three more days, four if Cas only gets to it on Sunday. It sounds reasonable enough to not push for sooner. Dean wants to for the sake of his own mind but he also wants a genuine reaction. He knows he’d give something away if he asked Cas to read it sooner — he could ask him to read it now, listen to his reactions. Except Cas would go into it with expectations and those would probably differ from Dean’s. And he’s certain he wouldn’t be able to sit there and listen quietly for however long it’d take Cas to read it. Probably not that long — Cas reads quickly even with Dean’s messy scrawl — but long enough that he’d be stupid and blurt the question out in the middle.
Charlie [2:17 AM]: Tell me, handmaiden.
So he’ll take Oliver’s anger. He’ll take him keeping to himself, only seeking his attention once to ask for food, and breaking down in tears again when Eileen comes home.
Cas who looks exactly like Dean remembers him and yet much more real.
He blinks, looks up, and realizes that Sam’s not the only one waiting for his attention or looking at him. They’re all watching him. It’s obvious he missed something and he can only stare at them blankly.
Cas [4:51 PM]: Also it doesn’t get bothered by you wriggling around, so you can either go with relaxing or rolling around until you fall asleep.
Cas wets his lips, looks back down. He’s frowning now but there’s still the careful set of his jaw like he’s ready to rip Dean's head off if he so much as thinks the wrong word.
It’s another step towards crossing the line. Because sure there’s been teasing between them the past week but there’s teasing and then there’s being obvious — which to be fair they both crossed that line during their conversation last night, and god how was that only last night? But that was a drunk call. Not them sitting next to each other after a fucking awful day. But it just feels so easy to slip into the old banter and Dean knew, he was one hundred percent aware when he invited Cas to keep him company that he wouldn’t be smart about this, that he’s too exhausted to not do or say something stupid. So he expects Cas to balk, to put more distance between them — Dean’s suddenly very aware of how close they are sitting and how small his couch is — but nothing of the sort comes.
Dean’s aware that by ‘anything’, he really means
"Good night, Dean."
"Jack's favorites?"
“It’s uhm-” he breaks off, has to swallow. The smile he forces onto his face feels off. “It’s a wedding invitation from an old high school friend. Garth. The wedding’s in October.”
"Idjit."
“You should continue driving.”
Dean [1:17 PM]: I'll be at your place in twenty minutes.
Dean holds his breath until his father actually makes a questioning noise, barely audible over the TV, and Cas continues, “It just means a lot to me that you care about Dean. Sometimes I wish my own family had taken me coming out more like you did. I mean, kicking out your child for simply loving someone, that's just cruel, isn't it?”
Except then he scrolls down further and a tweet from Eileen pops up. A picture of Sam and her kissing, Christmas decorations and a stupid self-made advent calendar behind them. It's so domestic it hurts and the caption "There's a surprise hidden here!!!" makes him roll his eyes a little. Because obviously it's her poorly hidden pregnancy belly. And why do they have to be so disgustingly sweet?
Cas [10:16 PM]: No.
Sam left the job to him, left him alone so he could say 'goodbye' to Baby. And why'd he even think this would be a goodbye? Hell he's coming back here to get her the second their faces are theirs and theirs only again.
Dean [9:06 PM]: Memory foam, Sammy!
“I’m making you dinner,” Cas says. “I know it’s still early but you must be hungry.”
The silence hangs heavy between them. Then his father says, “You know, it’s nice seeing you put up a bit more of a fight again.”
Cas [10:08 PM]: You didn’t.
“Pancakes?”
"Dean?"
“No?” She genuinely sounds confused now. Which is fair because she doesn’t know.
In the end, it always comes back to this being his fault.
Dean’s mind is running haywire.
“Not a single bit,” Dean says, turning back to the kid. There’s a tired edge to the way he’s clutching onto him and he’s starting to look ready to stop moving. They might as well start their way back. “Actually the only thing it did was make me hungry.”
He takes another sip of the coffee, swallows heavily around it and she takes his silence as the agreement it is. She starts rearranging the sugar packets in their little basket, putting way too much care into it.
“I guess, yeah.” Their idea doesn't sound like the worst. It's certainly better than texting it which he had considered for a hot minute as well but then burrowed along with the urge to punch something a few days ago. It hadn't just been a bad idea but it had also been a horrible day and yeah no they are right. He wants this to be good. He wants to give Cas something nice and not just all this fighting and anger that isn’t even Cas's fault. He wants Cas to know that he loves him even when he’s being an idiot. Even when they’re both being idiots.
He can’t say it. It feels dumb but just voicing it would make it that much more real. As if sitting on the floor of a hospital bathroom stall, the aftertaste of vomit in his mouth makes it any less real. As if manhandling his father into the car was any less real. As if seeing his too slack face was any less real.
"Oh yeah of course." He laughs and rubs his neck. "Sorry, man. I didn't think-"
And when they get up and make their way back to Charlie’s car — Cas apparently walked here which is just stupid — Cas doesn’t pull away when Dean takes his hand. Instead, he squeezes back, bumps their shoulders together. It’s warm and comfortable.
There's light spilling from the black ooze of the Empty.
"Hurts," Cas grunts, while Dean's hands settle on his face, tilting it back up, forcing Cas backward until he's not hunching over and there's room for his body, for breath and a level voice that's going "That's okay. Can you try and listen to me?" and that's his own and oh.
“Don’t Dean me. You invited him for dinner first.” The judgment in his voice is so loud that Dean’s certain even Oliver upstairs in his room heard it. He’d regret it but he feels a little off-kilter right now. He just really thought he wasn’t broadcasting his own stupidity all over the place. He can judge himself just fine for what he’s doing. He has no interest in listening to others do it for him just yet. He’ll take that after the inevitable heartbreak he’s setting himself up for. “I thought we had a deal.”
And he does.
Before Dean can unpack that or even think of answering, there’s a loud, “Dean Winchester!” being yelled.
Cas [7:08 PM]: There's nothing to learn. I have no reason to protect myself from you.
And all Dean can do is start laughing.
"Yes, that's usually how time works. Technically Monday already is tomorrow. And we both need to work."
“Here.”
His father’s eyes narrow. “Right. Looks like a toy to me.”
Dean [10:30 PM]: Of course.
It sucks but now he’s here and there’s not much he can change. But it’s also really not helping with his nerves. And every moment it takes before he can hear movement from inside, makes them scream at him, how bad of an idea this is and how he shouldn’t rock the boat. How, even with the letter burning a hole into his jacket right next to that stupid chocolate bar Cas bought him yesterday, this will go horribly wrong and Cas won’t believe a single word he has to say.
Five tense seconds tick by. Cas says, “No. Thank you.”
"Son of a bitch," he mumbles. He tries accepting the call with his elbow but gives up after a few hopeless tries, too worried about Cas hanging up to care any longer about keeping his phone clean. So accepting the call leaves a smear of flour, joined by a very visible fingerprint from turning it to speaker. "Cas, hey."
Sam [11:19 PM]: Yeah, I know.
“Break’s over, Winchester.”
And it's between kisses, wandering touches, and hushed sounds in the darkness, that Dean realizes it with all of the clarity that only late-night conversations and fatigue can bring.
Sam [11:12 PM]: So how’s Dean doing?
It's Cas that comes to wake him a little while later, the expression on his face is anything but the fond look he should have in Dean's opinion and followed by none of the kisses there should be either.
Only when he's standing in the arrival hall, eyes wandering, does he shoot off a quick text to his father, casually asking if everything's alright and following it with a simple ‘Oh, by the way, Cas is visiting during the holidays.’
schedule and added at least snacks if not in advance prepared meals to that once they moved into a place together.
Dean blinks up at him, purses his lips. Cas just continues looking at him, still smiling and happy even. Like this is the best way he could’ve imagined the night going, like there’s nowhere he’d rather be than stuck as Dean’s pillow while surrounded by people he still mostly knows through Dean’s words only.
Dean [8:25 AM]: But hey at least I didn’t drunk dial you, right?
Cas [12:39 AM]: Out.
“You're staring at your phone. Again.”
He's not one for talking about his feelings. Hell, he can count the people he has actually talked to - honestly and without being drunk - on both hands. There's Sam, of course, then Charlie during a late night binge-watch session, Bobby on a few rare occasions, his mother and Cas of course. And Miracle. He talks to her a lot. And by a lot, he really means all the damn time. Even about things he never told anybody else and hasn't yet wrapped his head around completely. And hey, he was pretty proud of himself when he managed to admit out loud that he liked Cas. Even if it was just to the audience of Miracle.
“Of course he isn't happy. He loves you and hates dad. In which world would you staying here make him happy?” “Hate’s a strong word,” Dean says but ducks his head to hide the onset of a smile on his face. He adores every single part of Cas but this one might be one he keeps closest to his heart if just because it makes it flutter with something that’s not just worry about possible consequences. “He told me with a straight face that he would not hesitate to punch him if need be. I think that qualifies as hate.” Dean perks up and the smile on his face is now anything but innocent. “Did he now?”
That one hits, smashes right into the small ball of hope in Dean’s chest, and shatters it into pieces. The pain of it comes along with a sudden wetness in his eyes before he even fully comprehends what this means. Not his apartment anymore. Not his home anymore. It's not a surprise and yet it is. He didn't want to go back, not really, but to have even the idea of it, the smallest sliver of hope denied like this hurts. Dean sits up, pulls his legs underneath him, and presses his free hand against his forehead.
“I can't leave Sam to deal with this. If he's stuck with this, if he has to use his free time for this he'll-” He pauses, swallows. “I can't let him bring Oliver around because nothing else works. I don't want Oliver to see what he can do, could do to him, how he is when he's drunk. He shouldn't experience it first hand and Sam shouldn't have to explain why our father hurts people he's supposed to love. He's four. He's just a kid.” A kid. Just like he'd been before he'd just stopped, wasn't allowed to anymore. “Maybe they'd be fine for a while, maybe dad can keep it together. But I know he'll slip up. And I can't risk it, Cas, I can't.”
But then again, the only thing he’s sure of right now, is that he’s still in love with Cas. So maybe Cas knows after all. Maybe the pages they are on aren't that far apart right now. Maybe there's still hope for them left.
Jo drops into the chair next to Charlie. “Who’s saying no to what?”
Cas [11:15 AM]: At least tell him you're losing your job over this. And talk to Sam. John's his father, too.
Dean [8:42 PM]: You’re family to the kid. So stick around if you want.
His father's grunted “You, too,” comes out flat and like he couldn't care less about making conversation.
"How about you go say hello to the others, Jack? I'm sure they are looking forward to seeing you again." Cas sounds strangled and the smile on his face is polite but forced. His cheeks practically as red as the garish Christmas sweater Dean is wearing of his own free will.
Dean [8:39 PM]: Wow. Seems like everybody but me knew you were in town.
Maybe it's because he's been on cloud nine since Christmas because now the thought of marrying Cas is a steady undercurrent in his head and everything reminds him of the possibilities of a future together. Their future together.
With a sigh, he drops his keys onto the rickety side table in the tiny hallway, shrugs his jacket off, and leaves it on top as well. He can practically feel it wobble underneath the added weight and swears to himself that he’ll fix the too-short leg as soon as he can. Maybe after he figures out a way to get the living room window unstuck though. Priorities and all that. He really should make himself a to-do list. And a list of things he could still use. Like a coat rack. Or just some damn hooks on a door. His shoes find their place next to the door where another pair is already standing.
He doesn’t wait for a response, just picks up both his food and water before he leaves the room to find another place to finish his lunch.
"Is it now?" He knows he should feel a little guilty but he finds that he doesn't actually care for waking Cas up. "Tell me, how drunk were you last night?"
“Well, this one isn't yours anymore. So stop.”
Dean hums in agreement, tugs the blanket a little tighter around himself.
Seriously though, what else is he supposed to do, when it’s not even him who keeps reaching out?
. Because Cas knows that both would be lies. Because Cas knows he doesn’t want to hear them, that they’d only hurt more.
Cas goes unnaturally still beneath him.
Dean shrugs his shoulders, tries for nonchalant but knows he fails, “It'll stop him from getting too pissed. He'll want to be the bigger person, even if it's you.”
"I know."
“Why did you do that?”
Cas [11:51 AM]: It’s probably for the best that I don’t remember that.
“You did what?” He can't quite keep the hurt out of his voice. Because he knows Cas has never been very comfortable around his father — honestly the only reason they ever stayed there during holidays was because of expectations and space and money. But him actually staying somewhere else would just be mean. Especially considering how Dean can't come with him and would be left with half the time he could have with Cas otherwise and-
Cas [3:17 AM]: Think I'm getting sick. Or just old.
, already. Like pulling on a favorite shirt he hasn’t worn in a bit, like getting back into Baby after not driving her for a while. He loves the idea even if it won’t change much in the grand scheme of things. And while Cas should hear it, right now isn’t it. The moment feels too off, too desperate.
Twenty minutes later he’s given up and accepted that the bathtub won’t get any cleaner at this point. He finishes what is left to clean in the bathroom and washes out the rags. His hands feel dry from being wet for too long and touching too many cleaners. He’s pretty sure there’s some lotion in his room — probably not what he intended it for back when he bought it but it’ll do the job.
Cas, who knows him. Who told him that he loves how much he cares about his family. So what if he doesn't quite get why Dean's still putting up with his father? He's still supporting him through it. And he knows that Dean misses his brother, his family, and friends all the damn time. He knows that visiting two or three times a year is fine but will never be enough. Hell, he probably already suspects that Dean won't stay in Boston forever, never even planned to. Maybe it's why he's been so quick to fight about the whole thing. Maybe Cas is actually worried about being left behind by him.
But then there are two problems it all starts and ends with.
“I know.” Cas sighs. “You always are.”
Charlie [10:47 AM]: Geez of course you are why would you joke about this.
“Fine! How do you even know he’s in town?”
“I wanted to surprise you.”
Dean [4:40 PM]: Why did I receive a stuffed animal in the mail today?
Charlie’s staring at him now, mouth slightly open. She looks utterly dumbfounded which would be hilarious on any other occasion. Tonight it just makes Dean realize anew how bad he screwed up. It takes her a second to find her words again but when she does speak it’s too loud and a tad hysterical, “Oh my god, why are you here?”
. And that it stretches far beyond a kiss or a touch out in the open for him to see. A wrong word, a look could already be-
Charlie [12:21 PM]: Tell me you didn’t do anything stupid!
Cas [9:02 AM]: Depends.
, sits on Dean’s tongue,
Sam [9:26 PM]: Seriously though, not over my dead body.
Okay, maybe he forgot about it for a few days there with all the walking on eggshells and trying to avoid his father he’s been doing. But it’s caught up to him again and he can feel his stomach fluttering with nerves at the mere thought and he can't think clearly, thoughts always straying back to Cas and what he will say.
is news. Dean stands up straighter, all other thoughts swept aside. “Something’s killing angels? And you thought you should waltz on over here by yourself? Without telling anybody?”
"Come on, Sam, lighten up," Dean says brightly as they pull up outside the restaurant, a brick building with the words
"This is your first time?" Cas asks Dean curiously in the quiet that follows.
emblazoned across its frosted glass pane.
"Good to see you too, Cas," Sam returns warmly. "So, you're on a case, huh?"
The Sheriff nods, takes a steeling breath, and opens the first file. On top of a thin stack of papers rests a photo of a smiling dark haired woman in her mid-thirties, reclining with her arms out on a park bench. Next to hers is a picture of a middle-aged man with graying hair and a set of severe, arched eyebrows, and the final image is of a much younger woman, thin and wiry, caught unawares at what looks to be a 50s diner-style table.
No bones.
"I know," Cas says wearily.
Dean thinks his stomach is about to be gone.
Dean can't keep his eyes off Cas' finger. "Until we know more about these things, you probably shouldn't... stick your hand in the dead guy's mouth." Cas turns his finger to look at it. "Actually, scratch that. You should
"Huh." Dean gets his lighter out."And that actually works?"
Dean makes himself relax and aims for nonchalance, because really, this isn't his business. Or Sam's, for that matter. Cas can do what he wants. "That angel chick?"
With nervous, tapping fingers, Ullman watches them unearth the file’s secrets.
went to see the milf, not you.”
Pale curtains hang around the perimeter, and a large golden clock stands sentinel in one corner. A mirrored wall just beside it curves and distorts the reflection of the room.
“This is nice,” Dean mumbles. Cas smiles. It is nice. His eyes land on the television again.
Cas tilts his head in that familiar way he does, making something warm spread through Dean's chest. He gives up concentrating and sits down on the bed.
turning into this… thing... maybe we can help.”
They park and find Cas inside, already sitting at a booth near a yellowed back wall. Sam sits down on the empty bench, and Dean deliberates for only a half second before scooting in next to him instead of Cas. If the weird energy from the morgue is still between them, well, he can deal with it from across the table instead of right next to the guy. He glances over the menu, spots a classic burger, finds the extra bacon charge, and hands it to Sam in short order.
red."
Humans can't usually do this, he knows, or at least not perfectly like an angel can. Recreating a song from memory takes careful practice and concentration, for them. He thinks maybe they'd be much less noisy if they all had their own personal brain radios to tune into whenever they want. But, then again, he's been wrong before. Maybe they would still play music aloud whenever possible, just because they could. Dean would make a point of it, that’s for sure.
— but then the figure begins to turn in his direction, and Cas’ mouth parts in a small gasp.
Dean takes an impatient breath. "Well, yeah. Dude's probably got a lot of important shit going on right now. Angel shit." He gestures out into the landscape, scowling, and if his tone comes off a little bitter, well, sue him. "Probably a lot more important than going with us on some one-off rugaru case, even if Heaven’s quiet right now. This is nothing! Probably doesn't even register on angel radar."
Sam casts him an expression full of concern. "Sheriff Ullman,” he says softly. “Were you connected with any of the victims?"
And he can sense it again. That same feeling that drew him to Dean’s room in the first place, the same one that led him to seek Dean out in a crowd full of people, the one that Dean radiated in pristine whites and lovely patterns on the ballroom dance floor. It’s permeating the air around him, encompassing him in a heady, insistent request for his presence.
As soon as Dean’s sure the receptionist is out of earshot, he rounds on Cas. “
The crows watch him, silent, now.
Dean can feel himself sinking back into the mattress again as he notices how quiet the night is without their laughter. When did he lay down? "Yup," he says, popping the P. He turns his head to watch the scene unfold.
Dean shrugs again, and Sam takes it at surface level, decides to quit pressing. "Well, if you
“So you’re trying to get leads.” Sam runs a hand over his face. “Cas, this is—”
a gentle familiar comfort, until his over-empathetic brother opened his mouth.
getting high."
It takes him a couple tries to actually get the bowl lit-- he keeps burning his thumb-- but eventually he tastes smoke when he puffs, an even stronger version of the spicy smell of the flower, and he eases off the lighter, inhaling.
, but he puts on his game face. For Sammy.
Cas takes the very last nibble of meat left and sets the bone down, slowly. He wipes his hands on his napkin, which Dean now notices he’s had the decency to fold over his lap. “Someone sent out a distress signal on angel radio not far from here. It may have something to do with this case.”
Cas' eyes are deep like the night sky and framed by crow's feet when he answers, "I love you too, Dean."
He's quiet for a minute, thinking over today's case  while Sam opens his vape and packs another bowl. "Hey." Sam glances up at him. "Do you think vamps smoke weed?"
“Your hair’s wet,” Dean points out.
Sam reaches out to pat him on the back. "You're doing good. Keep it up," he says encouragingly.
Longing.
Could be a coincidence.
Dean lifts his head to fix Cas with a disbelieving look. “It's not that good. You won’t like it.”
"Yeah?" Sam sets Dean's duffel on the dining table a little more gently, shrugging his jacket off. Sam knows exactly what’s being discussed. He won't press that he's right, like his older brother would; he wants to hear Dean say it of his own volition.
has been bypassed for this clipped response. “Happy to see you too, sugar plum. We’re working a case.”
The first picture, an older man’s body sprawled on a hardwood floor with much of his front doused in red, comes with some paper scraps of nearly illegible scrawl clipped to its side— no coroner’s report, though. In fact, it doesn’t look like there are
. Not physically— it’s just, he’s dressed in pure white from head to toe, and he seems to resonate with a surreal softness where the light hits him, slightly blurring his outline. He’s got a suit on, but he’s left the jacket somewhere, electing to roll his sleeves up to his elbows in its absence. His ears glitter uncharacteristically with jewelry that Cas can only just make out from where he’s standing, with several pieces adorning not only the lobe, but the upper cartilage as well. He's not wearing a mask, but something in his hair glimmers, a kind of silver headpiece that wraps elegantly around the back of his skull. His silken waistcoat is finely embroidered with faintly iridescent leaves, and before he turns around fully, Cas catches that it’s been laced like a corset low in the back instead of cinched together in the traditional fashion.
has slid the large rolling door to the side, just enough for a person to fit through. Inside the barn is pitch black.
Dean is in good spirits for the first time since he's come back from demonhood. He drums along on the steering wheel to Blondie as he turns into the parking lot, fully ready to chow down on a burger and beer with two of his favorite people, despite the small drawback that they don't have any idea what they're dealing with. He's not worried about that, though. They always figure it out one way or another, don't they?
At first, he thinks he’s mistaken—
He steps closer, right up into Dean's space, and offers a hand. It's only now that he notices the fine sparkles brushed high on Dean's cheekbones and the dusting of purple shadow across his eyelids. Dean's gaze darts down to where Cas is reaching out, but he doesn't back away.
Curiosity about the source of that prayer-adjacent stream of feelings wins out, though. Cas reasons that if Dean wants his presence in the dream for some reason, well, then maybe he can help.
If anything is amiss with this scene, Missy doesn’t show it. She simply plops onto the couch opposite Sam and slams her plate down next to the others with a clatter. Sam jumps.
Dean exhales. "Chill," he repeats. "Yeah." With another sigh, he hefts himself up, meeting Sam's eyes and jabbing a finger at him. "If this goes south, if I start wigging out... we never talk about this again. Got it?"
“When will she be back?”
"Yeah," he admits truthfully. "Good."
"Come on, the guy gets attacked, goes back home to his sister and plays it cool? Nah." Dean shakes his head. "He didn't know what hit him. Has to be something else."
Dean stares at the ceiling, arms splayed out below the pillows.
Maybe a little worrying.
Dean frowns. He doesn't think so. "Hard to tell."
. Thank you," he mumbles around his full mouth.
"We should have bought snacks," Sam laments.
Dean smirks. "Remember the boarding home I stayed at for like, two months?"
“Oh,” Cas says.
“Oh, so you agree that she’s a milf.”
"I'm gonna call him." Dean puts his pipe down, careful not to spill the bowl, and reaches for his phone. It takes him a long time to discern which name in his contacts belongs to Cas, and he scrolls past it and has to scroll back up twice before he finally hits the call button. Sam reaches over and turns on the speakerphone before Dean can even consider it.
. “On a grill? Perhaps in an oven, if that’s what you have available—”
"Three victims in the last two days. First is 27 year old Sandy Duvall, found dead just outside town after her roommate Shelly said she didn't come home," Sam rattles off in the procedural tone he gets when he's presenting his research. "The second, Jackson Nichols, 52, also didn't come home. He was a groundskeeper at the Elstree House Bed and Breakfast just outside town— body found yesterday in the hedges by hotel staff."
"How's it feel?" he directs at Cas. He's pleased when Cas seems to have the perma-smile too. It’s plastered on his face and not coming off any time soon.
It’s a man in a very bloody gingham shirt, lying on his front in the grass, his head tilted and facing the camera. The flash illuminates his wide, glassy eyes.
"Good," he hears himself say with a manufactured smile. "You know me. Peachy. Why? How do I look?" He says it flirtily, and he knows the reference to their last meeting— when Cas told him he looked terrible— is going to fall flat, and it does. He doesn't know what else to say.
“I don’t believe so,” Ullman says wearily. “Howard was a bit of a shut-in, but the friendly kind. Had a strict routine. Picked up the newspaper, walked to Rosie’s for a donut and coffee, and walked home. Every mornin’ like clockwork. Said it was good for his bones.” He shakes his head. “I seen him around for years now, wavin' good day to everyone he saw. Poor old sap wouldn’ta hurt a fly. N' even if he did, we can't make sense of it. I mean, he didn’t do this. The bites… they're animal.”
"I never seen him like that. Never. He told me to get inside, stay back. And when he fell down on the grass, I couldn't help it, I came runnin' out to him, but…" She lets her arms fall to her lap. "He was already gone."
Silence, as the two imitation FBI agents rifle through papers, trying to find anything else Ullman could have missed. Eventually, Sam raises his head from the first folder.
Missy sees his scrutiny and gives him a quick half smile that doesn't really hide the anxiety behind her eyes.  "I s’pose I must be the same way.” She rights the bottle of antacid tablets. “My stomach’s been actin’ up somethin’ terrible since this mornin'. Won’t quit burnin’.”
"Mm, both." Ullman reaches for the other folder, fiddling with the corner. "Far as we can tell, it's canine, or close to it. Not human, in nature."
"You relax?" Dean says incredulously. "I-I mean, that's—" Frustrated, he runs a hand through his hair and blows out an apologetic breath. “I guess I don't think about what you get up to while we’re asleep. I always assumed you… meditated, or something.”
"Apparently he's not working with Hannah anymore."
Cas sets the grocery bag on the table, squinting at the pair of Winchesters. "You seem to be in an... unusual mood. What's happened?" He pauses. “Have you been cursed?”
Missy, as it turns out, is not only recently divorced. With a quick search on his iPad during the drive over, Sam learns she's also got a reputation for being rough and tumble, a through-and-through country woman who has built her own ranch from the ground up. And she's well-off, with a stately white house and a well-kept barn on an expansive property at the west edge of town that, because of a prenuptial agreement that gave her a significant portion of assets in the event of a divorce, belongs entirely to her.
"Are you okay?” Cas asks, because Dean was just insisting he didn’t want this a few seconds ago.
It hangs in the air this time, thrumming through Cas’ grace instead of dying down, and Dean’s brow furrows into a troubled frown. He doesn’t say
Shortly after they begin to argue about the mode of transmission, the waitress arrives with their dinners, stopping the conversation. She sets identical plates down in front of Sam and Cas, and a tall burger held together by a colorful toothpick in front of Dean, who rubs his hands together.
“You should probably get that,” Cas says reasonably and, if Dean's not imagining things, regretfully. Dean swallows, and Cas watches his throat bob.
The angel watches with fascination as Dean lights up, and Dean tries his best to make it look cool for him, watching the smoke sliding up through the air for a good minute and taking two long hits before hacking up another lung.
Dean instantly feels his cottonmouth go drier. He groans. "Dude, why did you have to say that?"
and catches a glimpse of Dean through a gap, he loses all visual again a short moment later.
Cas frowns. "I'm not sure," he says. "Brute force wouldn't be successful against an angel. It would have to be either an angel blade or some sort of supernatural attack, something these creatures may or may not be capable of. If I could find the body, I'd know for sure."
"Hmm," Dean grunts with finality. He gives his attention back to the road, turning pointedly away from Sam and officially determining this weirdly uncomfortable conversation over.
, per se. He’s been human in this body, though. He fought battles in it. Made a home in it. It’s as much his as it was Jimmy Novak’s, now. Dean’s proud of him.
"No," Dean says immediately.
Missy doesn't make a move to take the picture. "Yeah, that’s Howard. I heard what happened… poor soul.” She dabs at her eye again. “Darrell talked to him a few days ago. Day before he disappeared. We went down to Rosie's to get the kids donuts before they went off to their Nana’s, and Howard was there. They got to talkin’ before Howard went home.”
A sharp
“Darrell O’Hallorann. Found early yesterday morning, much the same way as Mr. Grady.” Ullman’s chair creaks again as he shifts in it. “Haven’t had time for lab results, but we can be sure the blood on him is not his own. His death was witnessed by his sister, Missy.”
Sam lets her lead him out of the drawing room, knowing he shouldn’t leave her alone like this. Once at the front door, he reaches into another pocket in his suit and pulls out the business cards they've had printed for this trip. "Thank you, miss O'Hallorann. If you think of anything else, or if there's anything you need— anything at all— please let me know."
He packs it dutifully with his fingers and hands it back to Dean, then tends to his dry herb vape (which doesn't look as intimidating, but Dean will never admit that). The smell of weed between them is already somewhat overpowering, but fresher than Dean's expecting, almost a little spicy. Dean eyes his pipe dubiously, glancing back and forth as Sam loads the chamber on his vape with the same flower.
Now, with no one around to witness, he unties his shoes and shucks his coat, hanging it gingerly from one of the many hooks on the tiled shower room wall so it won't wrinkle. He loosens his tie and carefully shimmies it over his head— he tries not to undo it so he doesn't have to ask someone how to tie the knot again, or worse, face the mortifying ordeal of having someone do it for him like Dean has had to multiple times. He steps out of his dress pants, folding them into a neat square and setting them on a sink while the water gets warm.
"I think so," Sam agrees, shrugging. "He'd be a really late bloomer for a rugaru. But it's not unheard of."
"Okay. Yeah. I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I’m not— it's not like you’re not— I mean, you're a great guy. Super great," Dean rambles. He's babbling, stumbling over his words. Cas looks up curiously, trying to ascertain the end goal of this. That scared deer look is back on Dean's face again, but at least he's meeting Cas' eyes, not averting his gaze like Cas is a cursed item. By contrast, he seems… Intent. Nervous, even with his eyelids still heavy with sleep. "You're actually like, really awesome, man. Super awesome. It's just, uh… Just that…"
Laughing, Dean sets a hand on Cas' knee, feeling his heart hammer in a weird way that he knows is amplified by the high. "Wow, Cas, you
"Dean, Belleville is only an hour out. If we turn around—"
“Sorry,” Cas apologizes, mind working quickly to get himself out of this as painlessly as possible. “I’ll just be going, then.”
"Hey, Cas?" he says, his voice suddenly much smaller.
"Do you think they're the ones who nabbed one of the god squad?"
Sam sighs, the lecture Dean
"Yes," Cas confirms, voice cracking. He wishes he fled the room when he had the opportunity.
Sam snickers. "I know. Sorry. We can't go now."
The cover features a woman painted in a white dress, standing with her eyes closed on a cliff that overlooks the sea. Wrapping his arms around her is the outline of a translucent man, almost completely see-through, and she's wrapping her arms back around him, too. Behind them are the remains of a crumbling two story cottage, alight with flames.
Regardless, a similar feeling is now permeating the walls of the bunker with a panicked urgency that makes Cas put down his book and stand at once. It's Dean. He grabs his clothes from the counter and dresses himself a little haphazardly, hanging his tie loosely around his neck and matching his shirt buttons incorrectly as he strides out of the kitchen toward Dean's room. If something is wrong, Cas is determined to take care of it.
Dean, who is pretty fucking sure he just dropped Sam off for an interview on the other side of town the last time he checked, raises his eyebrows at the coroner’s kind-faced receptionist. "...My partner?"
Typical family photos are hanging on the walls: Missy and her kids, grinning and gap-toothed next to the horses; someone who Sam recognizes from the case file as Missy's brother, Darrell; the whole family sitting together at a diner with a checkered floor, though one person has been neatly folded out of view. Occasionally, the family is accompanied by someone who's the spitting image of Missy, an older woman with long hair and crow's feet who Sam assumes is Missy’s mother.
Missy thinks hard about it for a little while, and Sam is just about to explain to her
Sam sits up from where he's been slouching against the TV stand. "Yeah, well. Your eyes are
Dean breathes. “Yeah.” He chuckles. “I think.”
Taking in Dean's open, vulnerable expression makes Cas think that nothing about this situation is going to be basic or uncomplicated. But he wants to help. He can calm Dean down, let him get a restful night's sleep, at the very least. And to do that, he'll have to insert himself into the scene.
This isn't exactly how Dean thought this would go, and he holds back, waiting for Sam to explain instead.
“No warning signs with him either? Nothing notable before he went missing?”
Getting the feeling that he’s going to have to take the lead, Cas takes one of Dean's hands and guides it to his shoulder, slides one of his own hands to rest on Dean's waist, feeling the texture of the delicate embroidery stitched into his waistcoat there. Cas' eyes are drawn to the way Dean's throat bobs nervously at the touch. He takes Dean’s other hand in his, raising it up like the other couples in the room, and then he begins to sway.
Sam can't help it. His eyes travel to examine Missy’s fingers, still not quite all the way clean, and the stack of dishes she's about to add to with her most recent meal, and the downed antacid tablets.
"I'm sorry," he says softly. "I saw someone in my life die, too." Missy looks up. "No one should have to go through that."
“I know, I know,” Dean says, sticking his hands in his jacket pockets. “I, uh…”
"I loaded up from a shop when we were in Washington a couple weeks ago. Here, Cas, take these."
"You're a dude," Dean says. "You know I don’t— I’m not—"
In any case, he thinks it's time for a reread.
The waitress writes it down and collects their menus, just a regular day at the job, and Dean thinks he must be having a stroke. First Cas ordering food out with them when he
"Bitch. Have you used a pipe before?"
Cas cuts in and lets them know that he examined Howard and the threadbare remains of the other vics yesterday. What they already know is confirmed again— that, once turned, the monster is mostly after bones, not paying any special attention to the skin and organs that stand in the way of its prize.  In addition, Howard and Darrell died with the same symptoms: their back molars turned ninety degrees, their stomach acid so low in pH that it burned through the lining, and their back teeth caked with bone marrow. Dean tries not to think about Cas sticking his fingers in Howard Grady's mouth, too.
The blinds on the large picture window have been drawn, but Sam can see a crease in one of them, a spot where someone's been periodically peeking out to watch the front drive. Missy has apparently been sitting here with her gun for some time, waiting, perhaps keeping guard for an unexpected visitor.
Sam doesn't.
That earns him a lopsided smile, fond in spite of itself. It fades now that it's Cas' turn to survey Dean, and Dean feels his arms prickle under the observation.
“Dean—”
"Oh. Yeah,” Dean forces out. “I mean, that's cool, that's— No, yeah, cool. So you'd..."
“There could be more,” Sam points out, propping his arms on the roof. “It doesn't sound like it's cropping up randomly. It seems like it's spreading.”
He fires before he has time to think.
Sam deliberates. "...You know, the high schoolers would be loving this right now. Jealous Dean. If they wanted—"
Dean follows her because, well, he can't back out now, can he? He's extra aware of the placement of his gun, wedged snugly between his dress pants and the band of his boxer briefs, just in case he needs it. He hopes he doesn’t— internally, he's half-panicked that if he uses it, it will lead him down a slippery slope he's all too well acquainted with since being bestowed with the Mark. But it’s also a reassurance he’s provided himself with in nearly every public space since he was a teenager, and it grounds him.
In the passenger seat next to him, Sam is not in good spirits. In fact, he looks stressed as hell.
Cas gives an exasperated sigh and commits to threading through the masked guests himself in steady pursuit. He doesn't understand how someone in such a bright, conspicuous outfit can evade his sight so easily, but it's exactly what Dean does— each time Cas hears a plaintive
Cas squeezes his eyes shut. He’s imagined confessing to Dean before, or at least bringing up his feelings in some sort of vague way to gauge what Dean’s reaction might be. He never has because, well, he hasn't had occasion to, and telling Dean might be pointless. Up until now, they were fine, comfortable, even; why change it? But this… this is worst case scenario. Cas can already feel the friendship he's built with Dean starting to crumble around the edges, and he hasn’t even said anything.
Cas doesn’t sleep. His plans for a night alone with his favorite pastimes have been entirely derailed. But the hours after they tuck themselves into bed, curled around Dean’s warm, sleeping body are spent smiling. And Cas thinks that, given the opportunity, he’d trade a cottage by the sea for this moment in a heartbeat.
And they drive in silence, Sam casually putting a hand up to his face to hide his smile.
"And you can come check on them and… visit us more often," he ends in a whisper.
"And for you?" the waitress says. Her eyes flick up when Sam doesn't answer right away.
Slurping.
"Just one last question, Missy, and then I'll get out of your hair." Sam brings out a photo of Howard Grady from his jacket pocket. In this one, Grady's sitting in that 50s style diner with a newspaper and a half-eaten donut, giving a crooked grin to whoever's behind the camera. "Did you or your brother happen to see this man recently?"
Sam shrugs. "Dunno. Could be an hour or two."
, waltzed into my room at two in the goddamn morning, saw me sleeping, and you— what, thought you’d sneak a quick peek?”
"Uh-- no, actually." Sam's eyes light up. "I have edibles. Hold on." He stands up, grabs the keys, and is gone in a flash, though Dean notes with pleasure that his steps seem to be wavering as well.
Ballroom dancing.
"Oh. Um, yeah," Sam agrees noncommittally. "Listen, Dean. I'm worried about Missy."
Frantic, Dean wrenches his body away from Cas, stumbling back into the crowd like he’s been slapped. He quickly regains his balance and staggers off, shoving the masked onlookers out of the way as he goes.
“Where the hell is Cas?”
“I can’t be sure,” Cas says. “I haven’t found him.”
“Alright.” Dean reaches into his back pocket for his wallet and slaps a couple of bills on the table. “No time like the present. Cas, you meet us there,” he directs, knowing Cas will decline a ride. "If she's in trouble, we've wasted enough daylight.”
“Awesome,” Dean says belatedly, watching Cas. There's a lull.
Their boots crunch over shards of glass as they survey the scene. "Jesus," Dean breathes.
Dean deliberates for a moment before he remembers that Sam promised never to talk about this. And besides, this looks a lot more inviting than the pipe, which is still curling little smoke tendrils from its base. "Okay..."
doing here?” Dean huffs, offended that his usual
Sam says, “See you in the morning, Cas,” and Dean says, “’Night, buddy,” and Cas bids them goodnight back, his arms propped idly on the surface of the map table. He listens as they amble off to their respective rooms, groaning about their stiff muscles.
There's no response. Cas turns the knob and eases the door open.
Sam blinks himself back into reality. “Miss O’Hallorann— I don’t mean to bother you. I just want to talk to you about your brother, if that’s alright.”
knob and lets it soothe his prickling skin is something to revere.
Cas takes a breath and tries to think as best as he can while Dean's eyes are locked on him so intently. He can do this. He can figure out how to help without letting Dean know it's real.
“Help yourself,” Ullman grunts. “I have plenty more.” Dean doesn’t doubt that he has a corkboard full of them somewhere, judging by that haggard look.
“Howard Grady. Found in his home three days ago,” Ullman explains. “We still aren’t entirely certain what killed him. Lydia, our coroner... she’s been a little overwhelmed. The blood found on his shirt, under his nails, and in his mouth…” He halts. He frowns. He scratches his head. “That’s been identified as Sandy Duvall’s.”
"Well, you know." Sobering, Dean rolls over and fixes Sam with a hard expression. "I've only done this once. So I don't have a lot to draw from, here."
She wraps her arms around her middle, an unconscious echo of the same motion, and Sam can see it in her eyes while she talks, even as she regards the floor: the man in the bloody gingham shirt, eyes wild and pained, searching for a comfort that isn't there.
And there’s a quiet sound, a wet sound, coming from the other end of the barn.
look at him for an explanation, eyebrows raised, still half-poised to fight.
Cas narrows his eyes. "I indulge in certain human pleasures from time to time, Dean," he says matter-of-factly, and that implication shuts Dean up completely.
Cas' stiff posture visibly relaxes as he regards them, and Dean feels relief swirl inside him like another hit from the pipe.
Cas swallows.
He follows Sam through the next door, which leads to a modern kitchen area with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances. The refrigerator door is ajar, and most notably, a half-mangled raw ham sits next to the sink, a ragged hole eaten straight through the middle of it where the bone would have been.
He should back out
Another
“...To check on me. You—” Dean’s throat seems to stop working momentarily. “Cas. Dreams are kinda private sometimes. You— you
Cas’ expression melts into something warm, his features softening. “Oh,” he says. “Well… Thank you, Dean.”
Dean pauses. “...Would you?" He asks.
, of all things.
Cas drops his gaze to Dean’s pocket, but Dean can’t seem to make his hands work.
"...Okay?" Dean says, because he's not going to argue with it, and he's not about to make a tired "who are you and what have you done with my brother" joke. He points at Cas next. "What about you, you turn into a hungry hungry hippo all the sudden?"
for a
," Sam echoes, and he sounds like he's trying not to be amused at some private joke, suddenly. His features are smooth and unassuming to anyone who hasn't spent every day of the last ten years jam packed into a car or a shitty motel with the guy, but Dean can clearly tell he's fighting a smile.
“Thank you for your help, Sheriff,” he says politely, half standing. “Would you mind if we take these...?”
"No-- well, I smoked once when I was a kid. Wasn't really a fan." He sighs dreamily, letting himself appreciate just how well formed Cas' facial features are. He wants to touch those cheekbones, feel them under his fingertips, but he settles for reaching up and touching his own instead, shivering at the contact.. He drops his hand. "This is a lot better. Trust me." He pats the bed, and Cas gives him a quizzical look before Sam comes back through the door, several chocolate bars in hand.
"I'm sorry about your brother. I know it must have been hard, losing him this way."
"Yeah, I think she could be," Sam says. "Dean, I don't think this is a clear cut case."
"Hold on. Isn't that just the same thing that I'm doing?"
, Dean thinks, remembering when he watched Cas down a line of five shots without blinking an eye at Bobby's.
With the clock long past midnight, he waits for Sam and Dean to say goodnight, as they always do. It's another ingrained habit of theirs that he considers endearing now, if a bit useless. Humans go to bed every night; they know they'll be unconscious for a few hours, they know they'll see each other in the morning. And yet, they still wish each other a good sleep.
The picture of patience, Sam reaches for the pipe, and Dean sets it in his hand reluctantly. "It's okay, just-- here. Like this."
Cas is driving his own vehicle, the old Lincoln Continental that Dean hasn't even thought to consider when he asks if Cas needs a ride, so they decide that Cas will go on ahead and save them a table before they part ways. Dean's a little reluctant to see Cas bouncing off by himself, feeling like the Impala is more empty now than it was when he drove here.
When he comes back to himself, Cas' shoulders are slumped. Dean knows angels don't need sleep, but Cas has bags under his eyes, and he looks… exhausted, downtrodden. Dean can't believe he didn't notice it before.
“Missy reported him leavin' for the store and not comin' back, day before last. He’s been livin’ with her while she goes through her divorce, helpin’ her take care of the kids.” Ullman shakes his head mournfully. “Missy saw him stumblin’ into the front lawn yesterday about seven am, all bloody, tellin’ her to stay back. She said he was holdin’ his stomach, and then he just…” He gestures to the ground. “Keeled over.”
