“Why are you so interested in my grandson? You said you had a colleague . . .”
. No spaces.” Sherlock paused. “Lestrade’s team is going through my old cases – looking at anyone who was just released from prison, that sort of thing. I believe he –”
“And that’s when it gets really interesting,” she said, leaning forward in her chair.
He still hadn’t cried. There had been no time at first. And then Harry had cried enough for both of them
) but he’d politely declined (
us, of course. Me. And well, you. Do you have plans for Christmas?”
“Then we can talk more tomorrow. You need to sleep. You look exhausted.”
“Yes, yes, Mycroft – cautionary tale. I know.” Sherlock stood and Mycroft retreated back to the fireplace.
He closed his eyes and concentrated. March 28, 2010. They’d just finished the case John called The Blind Banker. Something tweaked at his memory . . .
“That’s all good, but it’s not the heroin that’s going to kill me.”
“We can’t.” John brushed his hands down his trousers.
John frowned. “But first shouldn’t you work out
” She was pregnant, almost four months and she looked beautiful, the hard lines around her eyes and mouth had softened, and John had to swallow before he leaned in and kissed her cheek, pulling her into a rough hug. He asked her how Lauren was and she laughed. “Busy. Tired. Happy about the baby. Rubbish timing though. We’ve been trying for ages; I’d pretty much given up hope. Pregnant bride – bit of a cliché, eh?” She realised what she said and her hand flew to her mouth. “Sorry.”
“Where?”
“Mary’s pregnant.” He said it painfully, like the words were shards of glass.
“And . . .”
“I just got here,” John sputtered.
Greg opened the bottom drawer of his desk, pulled out a pack of cigarettes and tossed them to Sherlock. Sherlock took one and threw the pack back on the desk. Greg came around the desk and motioned to the window. They moved to the window and Greg opened it.
. Mary was a very busy woman.
“What’s in the file?” Sherlock finally asked.
“It wasn’t easy, but the budget approval just came through.” He paused and she realized he was waiting for her to thank him.
Sherlock wrapped the scarf around his neck and shrugged into his coat. “Text me the address of David Sutton.”
“Well, I know it’s been a while since we’ve spoken.”
She sighed. “John has been in love with you for a very long time.” Mrs. Hudson stood, moved toward the door and looked back at him. “We’re offering you a chance to make things right. Don’t waste it or I shall be very cross with you indeed.”
The car pulled up in front of her hotel. “Have a pleasant evening, Inspector Bryant.”
I stop the car in the middle of the empty road. “Okay, Einstein. What is a sundog?”
He closed his eyes and there was something in his expression that made her feel like she’d just kicked a puppy. She reached out and rested one hand on his arm. She expected him to pull away, but he didn’t. “I’m sorry . . .”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open and he closed his mouth and tried to push John’s shoulders, but John pressed harder against Sherlock’s chest and forced Sherlock’s mouth open and the familiar taste of tobacco and whisky and coffee cracked all the way down John’s chest. Sherlock moaned against his lips and John felt Sherlock’s hands on his waist and then lower and suddenly there was nothing in his head but this.
So where the hell is she?
“It’s not that simple.”
Sherlock nodded, stood up and walked inside. Kate zipped her jacket and grabbed Sherlock’s scarf, wrapping it around her neck. Sherlock reappeared with a large box and stared at her.
Sherlock sighed and spoke. “Alphabetically or chronologically?”
Sherlock grasped John’s hand tight to his chest. “Whisky, please.”
He arched one eyebrow.
“Trying to. Unsolved I take it?”
“He’s dead,” John says to Greg Lestrade at the Yard later.  His voice, not quite controlled, still sounds surprised. He says it again, more to himself this time, forming the words slowly, changing intonation, like an actor going over his lines. There are new tenses, new definitions to learn.
“Hungry?” John asked.
– I love you and there’s someone who might try to do something . . . I don’t know for sure, but you need to get out of town – I know that sounds dramatic but just do as I say and go to Montreal – just until I get this figured out – visit your mother, go Christmas shopping. I’ll explain everything, I swear. Call me when you get this . . . on this number, not on my cell. Go to Montreal. And then call me. Okay, I’ll try to call you later.
She swept into the room, glanced at John and turned back to Sherlock, who was closing the door.
“No, I still have Sherlock’s phone.” She smiled. “I’m pretty sure your number’s in there.”
Sherlock lay crumpled on his side on the floor outside the door, one side of his face painted the colour of blood. Only it wasn’t paint, was it?
Sherlock looked at him. “It will.” He spoke softly. “Guaranteed.”
Sherlock walked in on Mary threatening to kill Magnussen in his own office – how did she get in? Where was his security team? In every picture and news story she’d found on the internet, there were always at least two large, well-tailored men standing or walking a few steps behind.
Thanks as always to peg22 for the cheerleading and handholding and for everything that matters.
“Really? This is Scotland Yard’s official advice? Don’t piss off our criminals?”
John took a deep breath. Fucking Mycroft was right. Sherlock was right. Kate was even right. He had to stop thinking of Mary as Mary Watson. The woman he loved.
Confused, he took out his wallet and pulled it open. A pitiful amount of cash, his bank card, driver’s license and a bracelet. Identical to the one he’d found in Sherlock’s drawer.
Sherlock scowls when their weekend in Sussex is rained out.
He opened the wardrobe and reached around – it was exactly where it was supposed to be. He pulled it down and sat on the bed, the cigar box on his lap. Inside were two unopened packs of Mayfairs and a lighter. A loaded gun. A small bag of cocaine. His hand hovered over the cocaine for a few seconds, but he settled on the safer choice. He lit the cigarette with shaky hands and took a long drag, letting the smoke fill his lungs.
“More or less. But if you’re insinuating she’s lying, she’s not. She wouldn’t.”
“I’m not sure you should be using up all God’s goodwill asking for train sets. You might need something really important one day.”
“M’okay.”
Only John wasn’t lying. He really hadn’t come here to confront Mary. He just wanted to see her, talk to her, and convince himself that he hadn’t imagined her. He needed to remind himself that whatever else she had turned out to be, she was also Mary – the woman who blushed when he called her beautiful, cried when she watched
“Mycroft, what the hell?” Sherlock held two cups of coffee and a small bag in his hands.
“He cares deeply for you, John.”
In the elevator, John leaned back against the wall. He looked exhausted. “I can’t believe we’re back here. He was finally getting better.”
“Sherlock is my business.”
After thirty minutes, Sherlock turned and held out one arm. “Now, John. All of it.” And with far less bravado, he added, “Please.”
Sherlock climbed into bed and John turned and kissed the palm of Sherlock’s hand. He felt something shift in him, like the calm that comes after a storm. Maybe John was right and the worst was over. But then he felt a twisting in his gut. Maybe the calm was really just the eye of a hurricane.
“You need to tell him, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s hand circled John’s wrist and pulled him back. “Sorry,” he said again.
“Then what use are you?” he shouted. “Find someone who knows what they’re doing, for Christ’s sake. Preferably before John dies.”
“You’re staying?” John asked. “Tonight, I mean?” Sherlock had confessed that this reunion was more furlough than homecoming.
. Asserting his authority. Doesn’t approve of this visit. They shook hands and made (very) small talk about Canada (
“He got released from Pentonville three months ago. Does any of this sound familiar?”
He didn’t finish the letters – he’d never mastered the art of chatter, would have been appalled with himself if he had – but he knew John still saw her on occasion . . . surely two degrees of separation was better than what he had now.
“Barts. He worked at Barts.”
She invited herself to tea a week after he moved in. He picked up curry from the Ajit Palace on the way home and she brought two bottles of a middling Chardonnay. She walked through the sterile rooms, her heels echoing loudly on the bare wood floors, and told him, straight-faced, that it reminded her of a safe house. “This is so unlike you – it’s as if you’re in witness protection. No one would think of looking for you here.”
John stood, walked toward the door and then back toward the kitchen. “You cloned Mary’s phone?”
Sherlock looked up at Greg and then sat heavily in the chair. “How did I not see this?”
The girl was probably not more than sixteen. She looked like a street kid, thin and pale, dressed entirely in army surplus couture. But when she smiled at Kate, she showed off a set of perfectly straight teeth that Kate guessed must have set her parents back a few thousand dollars. The nose piercing – a small diamond stud – looked expensive.
Did he have a name? A wife? A mistress?” Sherlock prompted.
Kate shook her head and sat back down. She’d only known him a few days, but she could distinguish sincerity from all the other bullshit that usually came out of his mouth. She pulled the chair closer to the bed. “I was just going to leave you the file. Didn’t think you’d be well enough by the time I left.”
On the way to the car, Kate asked, “I don’t suppose you know any jewelry stores that are still open? And roses, I definitely need roses.”
“You are an idiot. An idiot who is going to get my brother killed. Again. And you continue to wound him with this nonsense about your poor, misunderstood wife. I won’t stand for it.” Mycroft was breathing hard. “Your wife, John, is right now in Essex eating rosemary potatoes and filet of sole with the man she’s been sleeping with for months. She started seeing him two weeks after Sherlock’s return. Two weeks after she realised it was very unwise to put all her eggs into your very flimsy basket. James Moriarty taught your wife well. She will always have an exit strategy.” Mycroft released John’s collar and he fell back against the seat.
“I am doing the work of the entire Scotland Yard.”
Not that he believed the doctors. Yes, he’d been injected with
“The universe is rarely so lazy.” Mycroft said and sighed.
Sherlock ignores me, pulls his mobile from his pocket and leaves the room. I stand beside the bed, trying to see what is obviously so clear to him.  Something niggles at the base of my brain. This case – it’s all so tidy, the clues helpfully lining up like actors taking a curtain call.
“You hired someone to kill John. And then turned it into a game.”
“Although I’d love to sit here all night and discuss your fucked up relationship with your brother, I have to go.” John tried the door. “Unlock the door.”
“I agree it’s all a cocked up mess. But it’s my mess. Our mess. Me and Sherlock’s. And me and Mary’s – to be honest.”
“Any sign of Kate yet?” John asked. He stood and lifted one of Sherlock’s robes from the hook behind the door.
John’s mobile vibrated in his coat pocket. He retrieved it and swiped the screen.
John refilled his glass and set the bottle on the floor. “To do with a case, he said. Not Mary, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
“Nice outfit, sir,” the driver pronounced solemnly as he held the car door open for John. “I’ll turn up the heat, shall I?”
Banks coughed. “It’s been an hour, sir. I’ve made tea. Peppermint.”
“We all thought, but there’s been a test and well, it turns out she’s mine.”
“A glass of water, I know,” Kate said. She hurried to the kitchen to refill the glass John had just emptied. “He doesn’t sound good. I’m not a doctor, but shouldn’t he be in the –”
Sherlock watched as John seemed to come to some kind of decision and he took Sherlock’s hand and headed toward the door. Their shoulders knocked together as they both tried to reach for their keys and the door flew open. Mrs. Hudson motioned them inside. Sherlock’s chest felt a twinge of hurt as John quickly dropped his hand, kicked off his shoes and headed up the stairs two at a time.
“Sherlock.” He held out one beautifully manicured hand.  “This is . . . unexpected.”
Sherlock looked away and took a long breath. When he spoke, his voice was thick, “I fear that I miscalculated the depth of my –” He turned back to face John and lifted his shoulders in a small shrug. “I missed you.”
John took the tea cups out of Sherlock’s hands and set them on the kitchen counter. He turned back and pointed to Sherlock’s chair. “Sit.”
“What lesson?” I ask.
“So why didn’t God listen? He listened to me. I prayed and prayed for a new train set for my birthday, and I got one, ‘member?”
“The Beatles? Dinosaurs? Help me out . . .”
“Get in. I’m the lucky one who gets to play chauffeur today. Why you can’t take a bloody cab . . . “
I pull away. “Really?”
She nodded and turned away, then stopped and looked back at him, “This is your fault, you know. You made him believe it was all a great game – chasing murderers and solving puzzles – he was besotted with you. Head over bloody heels. Did you even notice?”
“But you just asked me to.”
“If you know why –” Kate said.
“Where to, mate?” the driver asked.
“His name was Moriarty. Do you think –” John said.
“She’s here.”
Sherlock walked over and stood next to John. Took John’s hand in his. John was surprised, but immediately felt better. About everything.
He stared at it a moment, one finger tracing the outline of Mary’s smiling face. Then his face crumpled, his features collapsing in on themselves. “Oh God.”  He leaned forward and buried his face in both hands. “Jesus, Sherlock . . .”
“Course I know where it is. I was just having a bit of fun. You look like you need a laugh.”
He pulls himself slowly out of the car, heads toward his door, then stops and crosses back to the driver’s side. Lets out a long, slow breath. He places both hands on the roof and leans down and into the open window. “I’ll call you in the morning. I promise.”
Greg ran a hand through his hair. None of this made any sense. Tommy Pearce was an ex-soldier with a nasty drug habit and violent temper. Who had cared enough about him to avenge his death? Thank you notes seemed more appropriate.
“Not until we talk.” She wondered if he could smell the whiskey on her breath.
“Yeah, what I said,” Charlotte said. She finished the tea and carried the empty cup to the sink. There was a teenager with good manners buried somewhere under all the eyeliner and tattoos. She leaned against the kitchen table and looked at John. “It got posted a couple hours ago – right after he put out the word.” She lifted her chin towards Sherlock. “He’s clever, Doc. I wouldn’t worry too much. He’ll take care of you. Same as he watches out for us.” She picked her bag up from the floor and slung it over her shoulder. She stood and looked at Sherlock.
“Still hungry.” His voice comes to me through a fog. I open one eye and realize I am staring at his bare knee. Sometime during, he must have slipped out of that blasted silk. I reach up and run a finger along his very quiet cock. He brushes my hand away.
Kate shrugged and Sherlock opened his mouth, but John held up his hand. “Well, we did plan to come to Canada with the news about Sarah. But then we heard from Mary and since she was our best link to Moriarty . . .”
“Finally.” He sat the computer in the chair and moved to the window.
The apartment is tiny and reminds me of the bedsits I lived in during my training at Barts. It’s clean and freshly (if inexpertly) painted. A galley kitchen, the colour of ripe bananas, opens onto a lounge furnished in what are clearly thrift store finds. An old velveteen couch, a faded floral armchair, a battered coffee table. No TV. No laptop. Two baskets filled with travel books. A drooping African violet on the small kitchen table. Heavy blackout drapes at the windows.
Kate gripped the phone too tight and it almost slipped out of her hand. “Pardon?”
Toronto. New city. New job. And in three months, if she survived the wedding, a new wife. Everything she wanted. Sometimes though, it was all a bit . . . much. So she escaped to The Scone Witch to drink tea and eat scones and just breathe.
Act Two was about to begin.
“Please, John – let me explain.”
“Do you need to take something?” she asked.
“What you always do when something’s bothering you. What’s wrong?”  A shite question considering the Mad Max theme park we live in.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “Busy. Don’t care.”
I stare at the picture on the floor.  It’s just like in the movies – those badly plotted, badly acted TV shows where the detective solves the case in the last ten minutes after wandering clueless through the first fifty.  Pictures and letters falling out of books and overheard conversations figure prominently. Mrs. Hudson is keen on them. I keep her company. The only thing missing here is the swell of violin music.
Sherlock turned suddenly, and they were face to face, Sherlock’s arm around John’s back, pulling him closer. John could feel his heartbeat knocking against Sherlock’s chest, Sherlock’s breath on his cheek, his leg snaking between his. Sherlock pulled John’s chin up and he stared at him, his eyebrow raised. John answered the question by kissing him hard on the lips, moving his hand up around Sherlock’s neck, threading his fingers through his hair. He hooked his leg around Sherlock’s hip and pushed against the hardness. Sherlock moaned against his mouth and reached down, hooked a finger under the waistband of John’s pants and pulled. John sucked in a breath as Sherlock’s fingers brushed against his cock.
John had left home more than fifteen years before, a year after his father’s death, so this feeling he had of being abandoned, of being an orphan, surprised and embarrassed him a little. He’d only seen his mother three or four times a year, sometimes a week in the summer or a few days at Christmas if he could get away, her birthday once or twice. She sent gifts and cards and biscuits for holidays. He phoned her Friday evenings when he remembered, sent flowers at Easter, money when he could. But if asked, he couldn’t have said where she did her shopping, or had her hair set, or what colour her new slippers were. Most days he hardly thought about her at all.
“What did the hotel say when you called?” she asked.
Lestrade was leaning against the wall of John’s building when the cab pulled up. John paid the fare and was about to close the door behind him when the driver shouted after him, “Sir, you forgot your cane!”
He lifted the suitcase into the trunk and laid it on top of a child’s bike. He saw her watching – “Flat tire. Keep promising her I'll get it fixed.”
Mycroft lifted a hand and Anthea appeared from the shadows, holding a file. “If you won’t listen to me, perhaps you will believe this.” Mycroft slid the file to John.
John answered, his voice hard and low and full of warning. “You don’t get to talk about my wife.”
“We’ve got a location on Bellamy. Hotel in Battersea.”
“You hungry, Greg?” John asked.
Both John and Kate stood and spoke at the same time.
“Bedroom,” he managed as Sherlock opened his shirt and sucked on his collarbone.
Sherlock reappears in a pair of silk pajamas and a silkier robe. As he rounds my chair on the way to his, he nicks my glass of whiskey and turns, draining the glass in front of me, his head back, throat exposed. I am suddenly hot and close my eyes for a minute. This is going to be a long night. The silk on silk alone would have tipped it off, but the sharing of a drinking glass is near the top of the list of things Sherlock will not do.
“I’m going to gain twenty pounds,” Kate said between bites of Mrs. Hudson’s cranberry scones.
“It’s not giving up. You can’t do anything about Mary. Don’t give her a reason to do something about you.”
He shook his head. “Maybe next time.”
John looked back from the doorway.
“The connection to the play I understand,” he says. “You know my methods, after all, something has surely rubbed off.”
A battered green Ford Fiesta squealed to a stop in front of her. A woman –
“There you go, my dear. We know how you love a good chase.” She hustled back to her flat and closed the door.
, Sherlock, really?” he thought. Apparently out loud.
“Slim pickings, I’m afraid.” He was a terrible liar. “Pick you up downstairs . . . in an hour?”
Greg frowned. “What’s wrong? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
The restaurant was amazing. She had steak and Caesar salad and probably too much Beaujolais. Greg was charming and attentive – he asked about Canada
Kate walked around and stood between them. “Tonight? We need to talk about this tonight?”
, is what I wanted to say, but I knew I couldn’t manage it.
Greg stood and reached back for his coat. “Great. Let’s go.”
“His nibs is awake. I’ll be right back.” He stood quickly and disappeared down the hallway.
“Who will? Her husband?”
It heals his heart and shatters it all over again.
“Where is it?” Sherlock said. “There should be a package.”
“The date.” He looked up at John. “For God’s sake, John, stop hovering over me and sit down.”
John knelt down and leaned over Sherlock. He lifted one of Sherlock’s hands and felt for a pulse. She saw something like a ghost pass over John’s face.
“And now?” Kate always felt like Mrs. Hudson was on the verge of telling her something very important, some little tidbit that would explain it all – especially why Kate was still here, gossiping over tea and cakes like a proper English lady.
“You’re leaving now.”
“Still dying.”
John and Sherlock were almost at the front door when Sherlock stopped. “I am bloody thick.” He pointed at a chair by the front door. “Wait there,” he said and ran back towards the auditorium.
“What’s going on?” Kate stood behind John’s chair. “I was just opening the champagne . . .”
She picked up her purse from the floor. “Any requests?”
Mrs. Hudson shook her head and gathered teacups from the tables. “Less sugar than your American donuts, dear. I used to buy them by the dozen in Florida, lovely and sticky . . . gained a stone once over a long weekend.”
“My turn to offer condolences.” He looked at Sherlock again. “My sister’s reserved a private room at the Savoy for lunch. She’s going to play mater as long as she can. Why don’t you come? Bring Tom of course.”
“He can’t hear you.”
Sherlock had one, but he wouldn’t – couldn’t – ask it so he shook his head and walked away.  At the lift, he leaned against the wall, found his phone and dialed the lab. He could only communicate with Molly by text or phone. Face to face, her sympathy enveloped him like fog and he couldn’t breathe. She picked up on the second ring.
And then Sherlock did something unexpected. He lifted his hand and cupped John’s face. He stroked his thumb along the ridge of John's eyebrow, let his palm glance across his cheek. Sherlock stilled his hand and looked into John's eyes.
“Sherlock.” John’s voice was quiet, unwavering. Concerned.
John nodded and after a quick look back at the empty bed, left the room.
Kate winced at that one. “So who, then?”
Sherlock tensed. “What has my brother done now?”
John’s phone rang while they were eating. He glanced at the number and shut it off. “Sarah,” he said. “I broke it off with her today.”
“I was mistaken about the location of the vaults.”
“Why did Mary’s mother call you?” Sherlock asked.
“Maybe?”
“Tread lightly, brother,” Sherlock warned.
He glanced at his reflection in the mirror. “You’re a bloody old fool.” He padded across the cold floor and slid into bed. This time he fell asleep immediately.
“Small consolation,” I say.  “You take too many chances. You almost . . .”
“She’s our client.”
John frowned. “No. We can’t  . . . we have to . . .”
There was a long silence.
jumper?”
“Jesus. If I tell you, will you shut up?”
John’s eyes widened. “Tommy Pearce? You can’t be serious. If Tommy wanted to settle the score, he’d beat me to a bloody pulp on my way home from the pub. He wouldn’t be sending me nursery rhymes and poison darts. No fucking way.”
Sherlock was half-way out the door when he stopped and turned around. He crossed back to Greg’s desk and pocketed the pack of cigarettes.
Ella stood. “I’m still not sure how I can help you.”
“What are you doing?” John asked.
Mycroft ignored her. “In fact,
Sutton swallowed but didn’t break his stare. “The man responsible for my son’s death. The world is a very small place, indeed.”
“Fancy.” Kate waited as he closed the gate and they walked down the sidewalk. Her apartment was three blocks in the opposite direction, but she didn’t think she should spring Sherlock on Chloe as a surprise – best to give her time to prepare. After Kate’s return from London, Chloe’s favourite response to anything she said about the trip had been, ‘Fuck Sherlock Holmes’”. Yes, the Parliament buildings were a better destination.
Sherlock inched a bit closer to the desk, keeping his eyes on Sutton’s hand holding the gun. “How much?”
Simon looked surprised. “I half-expected you’d still be playing Hercule Poirot at dinner parties.” He turned to John. “It’s amazing the things Sherlock can deduce from the size of the bulge in one’s trousers.”
John lay on his back, trying to ignore the pain in his hand and watched the shadows from the street lights flicker across the ceiling. He thought about what happened tonight, about tomorrow and about Sherlock. He remembered the feel of Sherlock’s warm cock in his hand, the salty taste of his skin on his tongue, the heat of his breath against his face.
“Kate? It’s Greg, Greg Lestrade.”
doing to him?”
He was two beers and twenty pages in when he lost his struggle to stay awake. The papers slid noiselessly to the floor and his head dropped to his chest. When Mrs. Hudson came up to check on him two hours later, she gathered up the papers, tossed the empty take-away container and left him to sleep.
“Mediocrity is its own reward.”
“I’m telling you now.”
John’s phone vibrated and he tugged it awkwardly out of his left pocket with his right hand. He’d been keeping his left hand tucked under his leg. Sherlock raised an eyebrow but said nothing. John slid the phone open, read the text and handed it to Sherlock. “Another one.”
Sherlock squinted in the sun. “Terry Fox.” He looked back at Kate. “I did mention I spent some time in your country.”
She smiled the smile she reserved for elderly ladies and babies. More forced than friendly. “I’ve not been here before. Just arrived in London yesterday.”
She heard a noise in the background and someone speaking.
“You told me that.”
dead, not because he wasn’t smart enough to pull it off, but because John knew, at the core of his being, that Sherlock would never have done this to
Kate sighed with relief. “No worries.”
Kate's back home. Sherlock's not.
There was the smell of bacon. And no Sherlock. And the smell of bacon. Even his pedestrian deduction skills could suss this one out. Was he going to find Sherlock in the kitchen, cooking bacon in a proper skillet, apron wrapped around his naked ass? Did three of his best fantasies just merge?
Everything always came back to John.
John scrubbed a hand across his face. “You’ve been following her for months. Of course you knew.”
After another half hour, she went looking for a nurse. It was like trying to hail a cab in rush hour.
“I am in need of clarification.”
“Maybe. But I daresay it’s accurate.”
Ferndale Road . . . Sherlock remembered this one, a mundane domestic murder made interesting only because the murder weapon was a frozen leg of lamb. Not one to pass up a good roast, the murderer served it to his family the following week for Sunday dinner. When the lab came back with traces of sheep blood at the scene, everyone put it down to lab error. Everyone except Sherlock. He knew Molly didn’t make those kinds of mistakes.
“I’m sorry,” John said, though they both knew it wasn’t his fault. His voice was soft and he sounded sad. He almost always sounded sad now. “Rosie got called to the surgery just as we were leaving. She’ll be back around eight.”
Lies 10, Truth 1.  Not even close, he wants to answer. Instead, he offers a slow half shrug and walks away.
“A lie.”
“Really, Detective?”
He startled Mycroft who had been leaning against the wall, his phone at his ear. “I beg your pardon?”
think too much?”
From Misha and Elena – for the little one.
His cell phone vibrated. He picked it up and turned away.
“You didn’t find me – you found John.”
John took the vacuum, and shook his head. “Is everyone barmy today?”
Sherlock took a drink. “Hardly need to leave the flat for that anymore.” He stared at John over his glass. “Admit it. You came home because you missed me.”
A strange noise escaped him, as if the air had been sucked from his lungs and burst from his throat. His military training, ingrained on a cellular level, kicked in and he was off the bed and across the room before Sherlock had turned from the window. He stood, fists at his side, breathing, willing his brain to confirm the sight before him. He watched Sherlock stub out the cigarette, and take a step forward.
Now they take things slower, not because they have to, but because they can.
Sherlock ignored him and crawled back into the bed. “Oh bugger off.” He felt something poke into the side of his neck. He pulled the newspaper out from under the pillow and was about to toss it in the direction of the tedious ghost named John, when he caught a glimpse of the date.
She dialed. Gave the operator the details. Felt her own heart pounding in her chest. “They said five to ten minutes.”
“Yes, of course.”
She untied the ribbon and opened the file. Sarah smiled up at her.
“You were poisoned, not crippled.”
he said.  And it was, until it all went spectacularly arse over tea kettle. Your arse, Dimitar Ivanov’s tea kettle.
He’d actually looked concerned when she’d abruptly turned to leave, a half-hearted “I’ll call you later” tossed at him as she left him standing by Terry Fox, both in mid-stride. She hoped for a minute he’d follow her – to suck all the horrible emotions out of her with his cold hard logic.
“Sumeet blames me for his father’s unfortunate incarceration.”
No one wanted Bellamy to be the one who poisoned John—if he was, any chance of finding out what John had been injected with likely died with him. A search of the hotel room had turned up nothing useful. No mobile, no laptop, no items helpfully labeled “CLUE.”
“Are you together or not?”
“I’m sure I have no idea.”
By seven, with the building still intact, Sherlock had reason to hope his plan had worked. He wasn’t certain it would be enough, but it was something. He wanted to shift forward in time, just a week or so, so that he could see how it would all turn out.
“We found a scrap of paper in his pocket that had the private number to the switchboard at Vauxhall Cross. And your brother’s name.”
There would be no casket, no ashes. Mycroft had already claimed those.
She’d retrieved her belongings from the hotel and called Greg. Nothing was missing – well, nothing except two pairs of panties. She didn’t want to think about what that meant. Greg had picked her up from the hotel, fed her a decent breakfast, and dropped her and her suitcase at 221B after a dozen sidelong glances and a few hundred words on why staying with Sherlock was a rubbish idea. How it would compromise the objectivity of her investigation . . .
Sherlock crossed his legs. “I have my methods.” He did his best to sound inscrutable.
Greg scrubbed his face. “Well, we need to narrow that down. How about those with connections to Afghanistan?”
There was a silence and she angled herself so that she could just see into the bedroom. John was sitting on the edge of the bed, a glass of water in one hand, a pill bottle in the other. He handed the glass to him and shook two large white pills out of the bottle.
Sherlock stared at the empty coffee cup on Greg’s desk. Greg wished he could figure out a way to coax the sociopath out of the man. It was obvious to him that Sherlock was drowning in emotions – probably unfamiliar and unwanted, but this was John. The tether to the hot air balloon. Greg didn’t want to think what would happen if John . . .
“Yes. Fine. I promise.”
Where else would he go?
Before she undressed to take a shower, she sent an email to her superintendent.
“Maybe your head’s just too big,” John snapped.
Kate heard voices in the stairwell – she stood and rushed out of Mrs. Hudson’s door and down the hallway. She didn’t want John leaving before she could talk to him.
“I’ve been tracking the assassin who tried to kill me. The fact that she is your
“Well, I just wanted to let you know you can stop looking. We’ve found our Anna. Or she found us, I should say.”
John left to fetch the pillow and Sherlock crooked a finger at her. She walked over to the bed and leaned down. He was struggling to keep his eyes open, “The girl who disappeared – what was her name?”
“But, Mum . . .”
The smell of peppermint was doing odd things to John’s stomach, but he forced himself to drink a little.
He would have been right 98 times out of 100, he tells me later.
They all stared at the clock on the mantle.
“I’ll put the kettle on, dear. You go on up.”
So why couldn’t she shake the feeling that she needed to stay a little longer? Sherlock was brilliant, but a complete imbecile when it came to his own relationships. He would analyse and deduce and plan and in the end he’d fuck it all up because he knew nothing about human nature. Sherlock still didn’t understand that all John had ever wanted to hear was “Choose me.” Someone needed to protect him from himself. Preferably someone who wasn’t fucking at least one other person in the room.
“And now, I need to air out his room. John said they’d be home at 3 and it’s already half 2.”
She sat opposite him in John’s chair. She knew he wanted her to go away, but she didn’t have much time before John came back.
“Sit down, John,” Kate said quietly.
She knew how this worked. Never say friend or colleague or girlfriend. You might as well say “I met him this morning.”  Always say family. “His sister.” The nurse looked sceptical. “From Canada,” she added.
“As much as I enjoy you cataloguing my scars, John, I need coffee.” He sat up and scrubbed his face. “Lots of coffee.”
“It’s a good start,” Ella told him. “At least the elephant in the room has a name now.”
She was rewarded with a withering stare.
“Good. Can you get my wallet and phone from the dresser in Sherlock’s room? Grab a blanket from the bed. And a towel from the bathroom.” He bent down in front of Sherlock and took his face between both hands. “I love you. We can fix this.” He leaned forward and kissed him quickly on the forehead.
“I won’t charge extra, I promise.” The barest hint of a smile flashed across her face. “So? Do you?”
Now he was sure she was lying. She’d used that exact same voice last summer to explain how the tooth fairy took away the baby tooth from under his pillow and left him 10p. Three weeks ago he’d found an envelope marked
The door blew shut behind her and when he got up and looked down the hallway, it was empty. He turned on the light in the hall and returned to his bedroom.
He laughed. “I have no idea. You might say I scratch his itch. And some nights, when he’s feeling generous and no new wars have broken out, he scratches mine. Nothing more to it than that.”
She looked at him through narrowed eyes. “So you’re not angry with me? Lauren said I shouldn’t, but someone had to do something . . .”
he was. He closed his eyes again and felt John’s hand on his chest.
“I take it that I am the gas pains in this scenario?”
“She’s a very lucky girl, your Chloe. Tell her I said so.”
And I will teach him the lesson I never had to learn.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow.
“Scissors, “John barked and held out his hand.
She’d texted home that she “got nothing.” Sitting alone in her hotel room later, typing up her notes on the laptop, she realized that wasn’t strictly true. Sherlock’s reaction to hearing the missing girl’s name – Anna Ashcroft – was strange. As if he’d suspected something and her name confirmed it. And why had he sent John out of the room first? And why was it impossible to find a decent pizza in this town? She tossed the take-out menus back in the desk drawer.
“Obviously. Continue.”
John slowly pulled himself into a sitting position. “You can stop calling me sir. This isn’t
“Don’t worry, I’m kidding.”
“Okay.”
He opened the door and Kate stormed in. Anger had turned her fine features to stone. “Which one of you two motherfuckers told Mary about me?”
, eh?” She rolled her eyes. “Yeah, okay.”
“Mm?” John said sleepily. He was more into the post-coital coma than the post-coital chat.
He didn’t expect to be happy. Or content. Or God forbid, fulfilled. He only hoped not to be desperately
Kate followed them down the hallway, ready to help. She stood at the door and watched John ease Sherlock back into bed. Sherlock was quickly losing the battle to keep his eyes open and his words were beginning to slur. “John, another pillow.”
“There is no good answer to that.”
John frowned. “Stop it. Whatever game you’re playing, just stop.”
“Molly, it’s fine. Just tell me.”
“5th Northumberland Fusiliers.”
She stepped around John and into the room. “Yes, yes, John. Whatever your little heart wants to believe.”
He dropped the cigarette into the empty glass on the bedside table and went to find his laptop.
“We were just wondering where you were.” Kate tried to look nonchalant.
We rise early now. He brings me tea and we drink it by the fire. For an hour each morning, before the pain grabs hold, we have our old life back. It's enough to see me through. He understands that now. When we lose this time, this one good hour, which will happen soon, I know, we’ll learn to say good-bye. One heartbeat at a time.
“Don’t I?”
“And because I hurt you . . . again . . . and for the first time in my life I can find no one to blame but myself.”
“Jesus, Sherlock. Work with me here. We don’t have time for your giant ego right now.”  At the mention of time, Sherlock’s eyes went to the clock. Greg watched his silent calculation and he sighed.
He looked confused by her sudden change in direction. “That is the standard treatment for a blood clot, yes.”
Sherlock’s voice was quiet. “I am sorry, John. About the child. I know how much –”
“Really? MI6 and your brother’s name. And not a single working CCTV camera in a five street radius. I figure you’d be halfway to the Yard by now.”
She turned to look at him. She really didn’t know him, but she was going to miss him. Holding a bouquet of roses in her lap had made her sentimental. “Thank you. For all of this.”
John stood and walked toward Sherlock. “It was quiet.” He leaned up and kissed Sherlock lightly on the mouth and then stepped back. “This okay?”
“Only one? I
“I didn’t hear you come in,” he said.
John frowned. “Don’t make jokes. Not about this.” He wasn’t sure he could say any of it again. Wasn’t even quite sure he really believed it yet, but here it was – his almost forgotten happily ever after fantasy.
John’s grin filled Sherlock’s chest for the rest of the day.
She stood on the sidewalk outside the hotel at 9:30 the next morning watching for Greg’s car, computer case in one hand, a Starbucks Venti coffee in the other. She was tired – she’d spent most of the night trying to convince herself that Mary Morstan
The sky is barely pink when they turn back on Baker Street – carrying two takeaway coffees and sticky buns in paper bags.
He took a second to admire the attention to detail this dream had and then thrust the paper towards John. “What’s the date on this paper?”
The phone vibrated again.
Kate rolled her eyes. She was going to die in London. Probably in this flat. Probably on this couch. Just because these two idiots kept confusing actual life threatening situations with the plot of a regency romance novel. She looked up and John had crossed the room and was standing above Sherlock’s chair.
“I’ve got a nephew who emigrated there. Place called Prince George. He’s a teacher – computers, I think, or was it mathematics –”
“Go sit down, John. I’ll get this round.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed. Another kiss, this one laced with desire and apology and forgiveness, all the things they could never say.
“A case?”  He lifted his empty glass and the bartender nodded.
Sherlock’s mouth hovered between a grimace and a smile and John the doctor, knowing full well it was all pheromones and nerve endings and not a well thought out idea at all, dipped down and kissed Sherlock hard on the mouth.
“Let’s begin,” she said. She picked up the pen from the small table beside her and held it over the empty page. “Now, about Sherlock . . .”
Sherlock pulled him toward the bedroom. John felt like he was pulling him toward something they had let get away – something they needed to find again. Like a future.
“I had a lot of time to kill and I fell down the rabbit hole . . .” She hesitated, wondering how to tell him. Finally, she decided to just say it. “I read Mary’s texts. All of them.”
He looked pleased. Like she’d passed some kind of test. “Well done, Inspector Bryant.”
“It must be Mary.” Kate stood and began pacing. “If I were able to prove she had a hand in Peter Goodale’s murder, and she found out . . . we know she doesn’t react well to feeling threatened . . . Sorry, John.”
The second the thought formed in her head, she knew she was right. It made a crazy kind of sense.
He hadn’t had a new suit since . . .
She’d stayed at the hospital most of the night, until the hotel called to tell her that her room had been broken into. That was right before her boss called and reminded her she’d promised – but had failed to deliver – a full progress report. He also reminded her that he expected her and her report in the office on Monday morning – no excuses. It only gave her two days before her flight home on Sunday afternoon.
Ella walked to the door. “Next week, then.”
“Tedious?”
John watched them, smiling. He thanked David and started walking down the aisle, nodding at the few people he knew. He was halfway to the back when he saw him. He was standing in the last row, both hands gripping the chair in front of him, a fragile smile on his face.  After a long stunned moment, John walked over to him. "Why are you here?” he said.
“Completely normal, as far as I can tell.” He smiled when he saw the expression on her face. “That was my reaction too.” He cleared his throat. “They moved him upstairs to ICU. I’ll take you to him. The lift is at the end of the corridor.”
“You could say that.”
“I suppose.” I walk past him. “It’s one way to go.” I know he’ll follow me. I could lead him all the way home with my little comments. I could lead him down a dark alley, press him up against a wall and fuck the arrogant look off his face and he’d still want to know why I am questioning his almighty deduction.
She scrolled through stories that claimed he was a fake, twice as many that claimed he wasn’t. She felt a surge of pity, she knew how much those stories must have irritated Sherlock. How much they must have hurt John.
“Yes.” She knew where this going.
“It was delivered to you. Three days after – ” In his mind, that sentence always ends with “you left me.” Instead, he just sighs and says again, “After.” He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small card. The edges are worn and the top left corner is torn. He hands it shakily to Sherlock. “Here . . .”
You mean like us? Like you and me?”
His father put down his newspaper and lifted him onto his lap. John leaned his head back against the worn flannel of his father’s shirt. “She was very sick. The kind of sick that the doctors don’t know how to fix.”
“Yeah, well, that’s all good but her mother just called me.”
When he finally returned, it was too late. John busted his lip, bloodied his nose, and introduced him to his fiancée. “He’s moved on,” Mycroft had told him. “He’s happy now.” Sherlock spent the next few months finding his place in this new configuration. He started to believe Gidleigh Park had all been a dream.
He scrolled through them until he found the one he was looking for. Sherlock standing alone by the baptismal font, hands in both pockets, dark curls falling over his forehead, looking into the camera, smiling. John had taken it because it was the first time in days that Sherlock had been completely still. He’d been manic for weeks, solving every case that landed at his feet, searching for patterns, convinced Moriarty was still playing him. John knew Sherlock was using again but he knew better than to confront him. He left that to Mycroft.
“Let me look.” John slipped into his trousers and came around the bed. “Don’t touch the stitches.” He reached for Sherlock’s head and Sherlock grabbed his hand.
Love does not make life easier, John learns.
“Maybe one day. Not for a long time, though. I’ve got a lot of chores to do between now and then.” He held out his pipe and John filled it with tobacco. It was a ritual they’d started when John was barely five.  “Any more questions or do I get to smoke this pipe in peace?”
“Sherlock, you stupid, selfish bastard, look what you’ve done to me,” John whispered as he drifted off.
“Unforgivable?”
John didn’t move. He felt paralyzed. The memory of everything that had ever happened in this room had him rooted to the floor. He was uncertain. He was pleased. He was terrified. When he had told Sherlock he’d chosen, he’d been lying. Well, not about his choice, just about this. This retracing of the steps to the place he had been the most happy. He knew there was no coming back from this final step. Not this time. If things went sideways now, he knew he wouldn’t survive. And he wasn’t being drunkenly melodramatic, either.
“How can he
She slipped the phone back into her bag.
Kate stood and brushed crumbs off her shirt. “I’d be offended if I weren’t so full.” She took her dishes to the kitchen. “How does Sherlock stay so thin, I wonder.”
John smiled. “Lonely.”
John pushed away from the table and stood up. “Mary is my wife. My pregnant wife.”
(the Colin Firth version, of course) that she paid for with his credit card.
“I understand the seriousness of this situation. I understand it better than all of you. It’s my life. It’s my problem.”
“Careless,” Sherlock said.
“Yes.” She nodded. “Yes. Fine.”
John kissed him again, softer and slower now, before pulling back and letting his head fall on Sherlock’s chest.
John touched her arm and she stepped back, startled. “I’m sorry.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, just took her arm, led her across the street – against the lights, to a chorus of honks, and onto a small bench next to a tree, a trash can, and a statue of Terry Fox. The Parliament buildings loomed in the near distance and a handful of tourists walked by, snapping pictures and chatting.
Or maybe
He paid the cabbie and told him to wait.
“Yet to be ascertained.”
He knew the answer to this one.
Sherlock nods, unfastens the buttons again, and rolls one of my nipples between two fingers.
Later they showered and went back to bed. John untangled the sheets and tugged them over them, and they fell asleep like that. When Sherlock woke a few hours later, John was looking at him in the dim light, gazing down at him like he was something new, like a gift he never expected.
He looked confused. “Why does everyone keep asking me that? Why would I be? You’re the best thing that ever happened to her.” He hugged her quickly in case she needed proof. “I’m looking forward to tomorrow.”
“Maybe you should start from the beginning,” John said. He sat in his chair opposite Kate and leaned forward and she felt oddly comforted, like she was one of his patients. “Is Chloe your girlfriend?”
Events were falling out of sync.
She sat in the chair by the bed, not wanting to wake him. She was so tired, she’d been up for almost twenty hours now with not much more to eat than cookies and two chocolate bars. If she ever made it back to the hotel, she was going to order the full breakfast from room service, have a shower and sleep for twelve hours.
John nuzzles Sherlock’s earlobe and whispers, "Maybe later tonight, eh?"
“Well, you look like crap,” she said. “Which is officially a grade higher than yesterday's death warmed over, so that’s positive.” The oxygen mask was gone – replaced by a nasal cannula, but the IV and monitors were still in place. “I hear the meds are working.”
“You okay?” John asked.
“Kate? She could be rather useful, I suppose.”
I hear Sherlock pronouncing his findings to Lestrade, and I pick up the book again, wondering how it could ever be considered bedtime reading. All that family angst . . . not to mention that interminable third act. As I put the play back on the nightstand, a small picture falls out of the pages and flutters to the floor.
He read it out loud. “
“No way.”
“Thanks.”
“For god’s sake, John. I’m trying to work.”
The folder contained twenty pictures. All of John. All from a distance, clearly all taken without John’s knowledge. John getting on a bus, John buying take-out, John walking down the street. Each was time-stamped with the date and year and she quickly recognized they had been taken while Sherlock had been what he euphemistically called “away.” The last one was a picture of John and Mary, holding hands, hailing a cab.
John had stumbled behind, always watching, forever waiting.
“I know my brother’s methods. Once he is clear of here, he will attempt to negotiate an exchange with Magnussen, a détente, if you will. He is working under the misguided notion that Mary matters more than –”
“The reservation was made in May, a few weeks before . . .” It was strange how his life was now divided into “before” and “after.” “With everything going on then, why in hell was he making hotel reservations in Dartmoor?” He didn’t add that the reservation was for the Empire Suite- king-size bed, Jacuzzi, minibar.
“Sorry.”
“Dr. Franklin rang while you were asleep. He wanted to know if there was any change. He said he’ll be at Barts when you . . . well, when you decide it’s time . . .”
Sherlock looks at me over the rim of his glass. “Feeling triumphant?”
She felt a surge of pity for Sherlock. “Why are you protecting her? I can’t imagine you’re doing this for John.”
“Sorry.”
“It has everything to do with him. He has a lot to lose if it gets out that the British government is in the habit of hiring assassins.”
He's angry with me. He says I've given up, and I have, but not in the way he means. I've given up pretending that anything else matters but here and now and him.
His mouth curved into a small, tired smile. “That appears to be the consensus.” He closed his eyes and his breathing slowed.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “8.”
“My pleasure.”
“I’ve been in Amsterdam for the last several days. I arrived home less than an hour before you knocked on my door. I’m sure there is CCTV footage somewhere that will confirm my whereabouts. There is so little assurance of privacy nowadays.”
“I read on your blog that you served in Afghanistan,” she said. By then, they were sitting on the couch drinking Mrs. Hudson’s tea from white china cups. The shortbread cookies were good, an Oreo would have been better. But if the only way to get to Sherlock Holmes was through John Watson, she’d play nice. For a while anyway. “My brother served there. Almost seven months. Helicopter pilot.”
“Do what?”
“Sherlock didn’t think so.” John sighed. “For once, I didn’t care. I’m just glad he’s home.”
Charlotte Ivan
Again, big thanks to peg22, master plotter and my favourite valentine. There is not enough chocolate in the world, just saying...
. It was as if she had swallowed every dialect from here to York and this was the result.
“Picked up a few phrases here and there.”
Sherlock wagged his eyebrows at him. “Are you flirting with me, Dr. Watson?”
It was autumn in Sussex and everything had changed.
The house – new to Clara and Harry and old by any other standard – is large and comfortable and lit up like, well, a Christmas tree. Sherlock and John stand in the driveway and stare for a moment.
– stepped out and turned to look at her. She didn’t look pleased.
Mrs. Hudson ignored her, lost in her own thoughts. “It was difficult, the years he was . . . gone. Didn’t think John ever would come out of it. And now he’s . . . life is full of surprises, isn’t it?” She looked up at Kate. “Though I’m sure you’ve heard a bit of that . . . nasty business . . . with Mary . . .”
Sherlock came back a few minutes later and stretched out beside him, his hand closing around John’s.
“Your conclusion was wrong. Admit it. Sloppy detective work, isn’t that what you said to me?”
“Your report resulted in his dishonourable discharge –”
She stared out the window as the cab crept through the traffic and replayed their last conversation before she left.
“Tikka masala and samosas from Taj Mahal. John doesn’t like samosas.”
“Sherlock?”
He snorted. Who was he fooling? Most mornings he barely made it to the toilet in time.
“I see halos everywhere.”
John sighed. “What do you think? Last night was . . .”
from a number she hadn’t seen before and wasn’t on his contacts list.
“Our client’s not Fiona’s sister, is she?” I say when I’m done thinking.
“No we didn’t. I mean . . . we need to . . . I need to think . . .”
John returns from his "talk" with Mycroft. John and Sherlock have a conversation. Kate tries to stay out of the way.
“Go home, Greg.” John says when they reach the car. “I’m fine.” His second lie of the day. The first was agreeing that the sticky buns were a good idea.
Kate chuckled and Sherlock pulled his hand away.
“I have . . . associates.”
It was Greg who broke the silence. “When you are going back to Canada? Chloe must be missing you.”
“Whiskey it is.” Greg set down the two glasses on the table.
He set the violin on the floor and stood in front of John.
Sherlock blows out a long loud breath. “Tedious,” he mutters. His leg twitches and he picks up his mobile and I know he’s about to text me something rude.
“How?”
John returned with a pillow tucked under one arm. “He’s asleep,” she said, trying to hide the disappointment she felt.
I take in a breath and fall back on the bed. He leans down and takes my cock in his mouth, sucking and licking the head, kneading my balls. I arch my hips – I need to get closer, I need him deeper. He sucks harder and my shoulders come off the bed. I can’t think and I can’t move and I know that if we are going to die, this is when it will happen. Neither one of us is paying attention to anything but the breathing and the sensations.
“Ever watch any James Bond movies?” the girl asked.
“Mrs. Hudson?” Even as he said it, he knew it couldn’t be. She’d been gone almost twenty years now. He’d attended her funeral. Wept real tears.
“John?” Sherlock said one night. It was six months after they’d finally admitted to each other what everyone else had known all along. They lay together side by side, shoulders touching, John’s leg snaked around Sherlock’s.
“Anna. Anna Ashcroft.”
“Yeah, fuck your welcome home. Four months, Sherlock! Four months.”
When it was over, Lauren and Harry, blissfully happy, held hands and practically danced down the aisle together hugging and greeting their guests while
“Mycroft will meet us at Baker Street.”
“I’m actually an excellent liar. But I really have no idea why you want to talk to me. Or why we have to have this conversation here. Unless this is a kidnapping. Are you kidnapping me, Mr. Holmes?”
“Did you cancel the reservation?” She said it as if she already knew the answer.
John shook his head. “Bollocks. I’ve got stomach ache and nausea. Low-grade fever. It’s food poisoning.”
John waits until Clara’s gone and they've put the bags down before crowding Sherlock against the wall and kissing him breathless. Sherlock’s hand comes up to draw him closer, and John slips his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth.
“Ha. Though if I – you – solve many more murders as quick as today, I’ll make Superintendent soon enough.” He scratched his head. “How the bloody hell did you know about the neighbour?”
She knew he was only half-listening, he kept glancing down the hallway towards what she assumed was Holmes’ room. She’d watched him pour the tea, and noticed the tan line around his ring finger. Like he’d recently worn a wedding ring long enough to get a tan, but not long enough to leave the characteristic indentation that comes after years of wear.
Banks had made more tea. He carried it to the bedroom on a small tray and made just enough noise to wake John.  In those few short seconds between sleep and wakefulness, John forgot about the poison and reached across the bed for Sherlock.
“I don’t know.”
“What?”
Kate rolled her eyes. “Hey, I have an idea – how about you two go make out some more and I’ll find a real suspect to question.” She paused, deciding how much to say. John walked to the window, turning his back to them. His face was reflected in the dark window and she saw him wipe his eyes with the heel of one hand. “What about Charles Magnussen?” she said. “I imagine he has a very thick file on Mary.”
He heard the water stop and he stood, smoothing out his rumpled suit, the wilting rose tumbling to the floor. He faced the door and waited.
“Does John have any ideas?”
“Right.” She sighed and typed something into the computer. “He’s in 312. Do you mind bringing his belongings down to him?”
Sherlock learned later that these were fairy tales. That nothing was ever that simple. That heroes were neither completely happy, nor entirely good. He learned that the fight was never fair, that the line between good and good enough shifted and blurred as the years went by.
“You’re hungry. I can get takeaway,” Sherlock offered. “Tikka masala, if you like.”
“Or chest.”
“Did John leave her when he found out? Poor John, he finds out his wife is not the good nurse he imagined her to be – and then you get shot. How did he find out, by the way?”
“Nice shower?”
. Jesus, Sherlock.”
“No, I mean what are you doing to me . . . us . . . this? What is this?”
“They fixed Granddad after he had his heart tack.”
“I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
“We’re going to A&E. Now.” He turned to her. “Kate, call 999. Tell them I suspect a PE and possible DVT. It’s 221b Baker Street.” His voice was calm, controlled and she saw the army doctor he used to be. He held the glass of water up to Sherlock’s mouth. “Drink this. It will help.”
Because god forbid Sherlock Holmes gets bored.”
After the blue light fades, I open the drapes and blink against the late afternoon sun. “Theory?” I prompt. There’s always a theory.
John smiled to himself as he pulled on his trousers. The more things changed . . .
“I’ll bring him home,” John had said into the phone. He’d turned to Kate and smiled. “He’s coming home.”
Sherlock hesitated. “Not possible. John and I are working.”
“Go. I’ll be waiting.”
“You’ll do no such thing.” She smiled and clasped her hands to her chest. “You’re never too old to enjoy a little romance.”
“Where to?”
“I sent you the preliminary results.”
It was still raining when the service ended. Everyone huddled by the door, looking at the sky for signs of clearing. John brushed by them, past their murmured condolences and whispered concern, out into the rain. He stood in the churchyard on the drenched grass and lifted his face to the sky.
“I’ll give Magnussen something he wants more.”
. He scrubbed a tired hand across his face. He’d just finished another long shift at the A&E. He needed to go upstairs and shower and change. He’d also promised Mrs. Hudson he’d move some boxes for her.  The same boxes he moved for her every few days. He understood it was her way of checking on him, and he did his best to be patient. He wasn’t the only one missing Sherlock.
John felt his head spin and decided to sit down again. Sherlock knelt in front of him, looking worried.  John felt not at all guilty about worrying him. He laid his head against the back of the chair and sighed. “So there’s got to be a point to all this right? You’re not just torturing me for the fun of it?” He cracked an eye to catch yet one more look between the demon brothers.
“You seem unusually calm, John. This information is . . .”
John turned back to Kate. “Mary issues?”
Sherlock leaned back. “And biscuits, don’t forget the biscuits.”
During Mass, John stood and sat and knelt, one eye on the family gathered in the first four rows and one on Sherlock. He listened as a soloist sang
She laughed. “I like to think you have the accent, not me. It’s Canadian.”
Greg rolled his eyes and pulled away from the curb. Kate stared up at the windows of the flat, hesitant to go in. Greg was right, if she crossed the threshold, she would be forever tossing her hat into the ring. She’d be firmly picking a side. Thankfully, Mrs. Hudson opened the door, took her suitcase and hustled her up the stairs.
“What did Magnussen do to you?”
“You are a terrible liar, Inspector.”
“Go ahead. Ask.”
I can’t tell yet which Sherlock Holmes this is. It’s a fair bet I’ll either be out on the street or arse up over the coffee table in a matter of minutes. I choose caution. It’s cold out.
His self-satisfied smile faltered. “How do you know about Mycroft?”
“Fine. Half an hour.”
online. It’ll be beans and toast for several months, but worth it to see the look on Sherlock’s face.
Thanks again to peg22. For listening, for reading, for filling the empty spaces.
And then the moment was over and Kate stood. Raised her own eyebrow, her hands moving to her hips.
Thanks, as always, to peg22 for handholding, cheerleading and for pushing me in the right direction..
“Sorry, sir.”  He transferred the pile of Sherlock’s dirty clothes from the chair by the dresser to the end of the bed and sat down. He was two sizes too big for the chair and he sat on the edge, looking uncomfortable.
“You can’t possibly promise something like that. You don’t even have a plan yet.”
Charlotte answered first. “It’s a YouTube vid of some little kid. Not saying nothing.”
And eighteen months later he met Mary. She had pursued John with a devotion that both flattered and frightened him. She was funny and smart and sexy. She learned quickly when to hover, when to let him be, and made room in their lives for his grief. She made it easy for him to love the person she was pretending to be.
“What is it?”
“Show me your phone,” he said.
– The streets are empty at this hour. Sherlock’s window is rolled down and the air blowing through the cab is damp and cool, and smells of something I can’t place. I ask him and he says, “It’s the city breathing, John.”
The figure in the door moved slowly into the room and sat down in the armchair opposite the bed. Graham stirred, then settled back to sleep. Sherlock breathed carefully, his heart racing, and lifted his hand slowly towards the lamp.
He carried the glass and the bottle back to his chair and sank into it. Sherlock glanced at the bottle, but said nothing.
Sherlock took two deep breaths and struggled to stay calm. “So tell me. Who was your customer?”
Sherlock watched John pace. “John.” he said quietly, “Sit down. Please.”
“You know I would.” It was one of the first things he made me promise. The first and easiest. “So you’re saying you developed a super power?” I know how ridiculous that sounds.
“John, what does this have to do with Molly? And Vic Bellamy was a dead end.”
“Okay, see you later.” John stood, leaned over and gave Sherlock a quick kiss. He looked at Sherlock and frowned. “What?”
“And . . .”
“You know I think James Moriarty had something to do with the murder I’m investigating?”
“How droll. I hear you’re clearing cases at an alarming rate. Back on the sauce, are we?”
After two more drinks and a promise to call Greg the next week, he walked back to his flat. He poured himself one last whiskey and took it to bed with him. For once, he fell asleep quickly.
He says it’s too late for breakfast when we finally make it back to the kitchen. He’s always looking for excuses not to eat. The doctors say his stomach may never forgive him for getting shot. So I’m creative, sprinkling protein powder in his soup, hiding tofu in the lasagna, mixing wheat germ in the muffins. I suspect he knows, but he doesn’t protest. He plays along and I try not to hover or remind him of the world’s starving children as he pushes his food around his plate like a finicky child.
Sherlock ignored him and continued typing. John folded his hands in his lap. He stared at Sherlock’s head. He looked at the picture above the fireplace. Unfolded his hands. Sighed.
, she texted back. If only it were that simple.
“Bullshit – I knew you’d tell me when you were ready.” She held out her hand for the paper. “Do you want to tell me or are you going to watch me read it?”
John. White hair and beard. Smiling. Healthy. He looked so . . . beautiful. But what was he doing here?
“What the bloody hell does that mean?”
The car smelled like aftershave and coffee and curry. Take-out on the way home last night. Lives alone. New shirt, same tie.
John, struggling to talk, whispered, “It seemed like a good idea at the time,” and his head dropped against Sherlock, unconscious.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “Really? One of my operatives goes missing and it’s not my business?”
“All heroin is basically the same.” He tried to stand again. Sherlock rose and took him by the arm.
John reached up to Sherlock’s trousers, pulling his shirt out, running a hand up his chest. Sherlock took in a breath. John unfastened buttons, unzipped zippers, touching, massaging, watching Sherlock’s face between moves. When John had Sherlock’s nipple in his mouth, and his hand around Sherlock’s cock, Sherlock amended his last thought.
Kate stood and pulled out her cell phone, then put it away. “Can I use your phone?”
Sutton didn’t blink. “Yes. I found out when he was twelve. Ran into his mother at Tesco – I hadn’t seen her since we went our separate ways. Thomas was with her and I knew in an instant. She denied it, of course.  Silly cow.”
When John stood to leave, Ronan dug into his pocket. “I almost forgot.  He said if you came asking, I was to give you this.” He glanced at Sherlock who was standing at the window and lowered his voice. “Not the tall one, he said, just to you.” He held out a crumpled bit of lined paper.
John bit his lip and shut his eyes, thrusted again and his orgasm crashed over him. He was still trembling when Sherlock released his own cock from his trousers and John circled it awkwardly with his right hand, moving frantically until he could feel Sherlock coming. It sent another shudder through his body, like a faint echo.
He reached in the other pocket and fingered the envelope of heroin. John had seen him nick it – if John made it through the next twenty-four hours he would consider giving it back. If not . . . He tapped out another cigarette and searched for a room in his mind palace where none of this ever happened. The cabbie slammed on the brakes and the cigarette flew out of his fingers.
The front seat was littered with empty coffee cups and old papers. Kate had started to collect them when the woman shovelled them all to the floor with one sweep of her hand. “Mind where you step,” she said.
Sherlock’s phone vibrated on the table. He picked it up without looking at the number and walked toward the living room.
There was something going on between John and Sherlock that she couldn’t put her finger on – probably nothing to with Moriarty, but it left her with the unsettled feeling that she was missing something important – like watching a movie filmed through a dirty lens.
John walked to the hotel bar and sat a table in the corner. Sherlock followed him but stopped at the bar to order drinks. He set two glasses on the table and sat opposite him. “Glenlivit. Neat.”
Moriarty to come out and play, admit it.”
Sherlock set his glass down and looked at John. “Yes. I did.”
John smiled wearily. “Not sure that’s true.” John retrieved the teapot from the table and emptied the contents into the sink. “I know better than to ask you if you want tea.”
There are protests, of course. Negotiations follow. He promises to call Greg in the morning, to call him if he needs anything, to call him if he changes his mind. He’ll promise anything to be left alone, to shake off the weight of Greg’s grief. He has no room for anyone’s sadness but his own.  Sherlock’s final act has made him selfish.
Sherlock spent the next twenty minutes tapping his fingers against his thigh and scrolling through his phone.  John recognised that it wasn’t a good sign that Sherlock was willing to spend an hour following up on a lead that Donovan or Anderson could easily have handled by phone.
“Mary didn’t want to see me – she just called to tell me the baby was mine if I wanted her.”
John stared at the file on the table. Another whiskey gave him the courage to open it. Two more to read through it all. Emails and letters and texts. Comments left on obscure websites. Transcripts of phone calls. Starting the day after Sherlock jumped and ending the week before he came back. There was a gap of six weeks halfway through the first year – a month after Gidleigh Park, John calculated. Followed by surveillance reports of a drugs rehab centre outside Ottawa. After that, the correspondence continued as before. The tone changed towards the end – Sherlock seemed angrier, more desperate that it was taking so long. He accused Mycroft of keeping him in the field for reasons that had nothing to do with Moriarty.
Lestrade snorted. “Sherlock, he’s not like most people. He’s a bit of an –” She saw him searching for the word – “arse . . . know-it-all sometimes. Don’t take anything he says personally. Especially now.”
“Hardly,” he said. “We almost never kidnap anyone anymore.” He smoothed an invisible wrinkle in his trousers. “Shall I get to the point?”
John took the phone from Sherlock and read the text. “Yesterday, you were whinging about how bored you were. So bored you were talking about flying to Minsk. What are you playing at?”
She nodded. “Of course. Everyone has . . .”
It was Sherlock who broke the moment. He turned his head away and shoved John hard to the left. John rolled onto his back, panting. Sherlock quickly stood up and walked into the bathroom and shut the door.
“Does it hurt?”
sort of way – an abundance of plaid upholstery and dark wood. He checked in and had to explain to a very bored but polite young man, that no
She waited on the sidewalk for another fifteen minutes, during which she managed to convince herself that she had given the London office the wrong terminal, the wrong time, the wrong day. She was in the middle of sending another text –
“Finally what?”
Sherlock swallowed hard and tried to say something. This could not be a stroke. He could actually smell the tea. Earl Grey.
Sherlock watched in fascination as John turned three shades of red. And then turned to Mrs. Hudson, cheery and vibrant and very much alive.
“And you’re sure it was him?”
Sherlock brushed the hand away. “I am fine. I just need to focus.” He coughed several times, one palm pressed flat against his chest.
“I can’t – I need you awake for a few hours. Nothing stronger than paracetamol.” John picked up the needle and the tape and put them back in the kit.
“Everyone lies.”
Sherlock was impatient, “They are falling precipitously with each minute you keep me from leaving.”
“Her name’s not Charlotte, is it?”
I frown. “But you have her fingerprints – who is she?”
“Yes, of course. Good to know you’re keeping up.” He rubs his hand together, smiling. If he had a moustache, he’d be twirling it. “I expect Lestrade will ring shortly.”
Sherlock reached back with one arm and wrapped a hand around the back of John’s neck. He held him there, his fingers laced tightly in his hair. It was explanation and apology and declaration. All the things John knew Sherlock could never say.
Because they do.
Her head hurt. She stood and stretched, and found some aspirin amid the loose coins at the bottom of her purse. She dry swallowed four pills and pocketed enough change to buy a large coffee at the cafeteria.
Greg rolled his eyes. “Now you’re taking the mick. You cannot know all that.”
“I don’t know.  We haven’t talked to her in a month. She sends us texts, though.”
John picked up the remote control, flicking through the channels. News and game shows and an episode of
The dumplings were sublime, the beer cold. He’d forgotten what young taste buds added to the enjoyment of a meal. That and the way John sucked plum sauce off his pinky finger, the way his eyes sparked as he talked about his time in medical school and the terrible Chinese takeaway near Barts that served ketchup with their dumplings.
The burning sensation crawling up John’s chest had nothing to do with the poison.  He swiped Sherlock’s hand away and shakily stood.
John took a reluctant step, staring at Sherlock’s face. “If this is some kind of experiment . . . I will kill you in your sleep, you know that, right? I was a –”
“I have no idea. But I’m sure it will involve more tea.”
“I bet you’ve got your money’s worth out of that.”
Sherlock didn’t answer.
. . . Mrs. Hudson’s voice breezed across his cheek.
Who talks like that?
“Is it working?”
“What’s John?”
Sherlock slides into his chair, staring at me, holding the glass in his fingers. He leans up and hands it back to me.
“No, it’s you I want to talk to. I tried telling Sherlock and Greg, but . . .”
She took the two pictures from her bag. One of Anna, one of Mary. She’d printed them out that morning at the hotel’s business centre. The quality wasn’t great, but they’d serve her purpose. She handed them to him and waited for his reaction.
Sherlock sighed and folded his hands together in his lap. “John is fine.”
“What the hell are you talking about?”
I pick up the book again and reread the inscription on the inside cover.
They ate side by side on the sofa, plates balanced on their knees, watching The Great British Bake Off. Sherlock found it surprisingly entertaining even if it was clear from the outset who would be the week’s star baker. John chose not to be enlightened. Typical.
“Why didn’t you?”
A few minutes later, Greg set two glasses and two packets of crisps on the table. “Carling okay?”
Greg smiled. “Please, after all we’ve been through?” He squeezed Kate’s shoulder. “How are you doing, Kate?”
John stepped forward and put a hand on his shoulder. “You okay?”
One morning two weeks after Sherlock pulls off his Lazarus act, John takes a cab to Baker Street. He pauses on the landing, trying to decide whether to forget the whole thing. After a moment, he squares his shoulders, takes a breath and knocks.
“Christ,” Sherlock panted, hot and damp, against John’s cheek. “I – God – ”  He rocked his hips forward again and again.  John couldn’t stop looking at the beat of his pulse at the base of his neck and further down, the bruise on his jaw.
Not that we’re keeping score.
He heard the sound of ice clinking and liquid splashing and opened his eyes to Sherlock standing above him holding out a tumbler of amber liquid. “I expect you need this.”
“Isn’t it? John’s blog’s made you out to be a bloody genius.”
John trusted Sherlock.
“I never said I called.”
“Should I call 911?” she asked him.
“Try to sleep.” He offered his body as blanket, and Sherlock wrapped himself in it.
He knew she wasn’t referring to the dirty dishes. “Well, yes. Of course.” He felt like a schoolboy caught cheating. “I’m trying.”
John smiled against his lips. With a mutual sigh, they relaxed against each other. All the ease that was missing from their conversation was here, in the way Sherlock’s thumb stroked John’s knuckles. Their bodies seemed to recognise one another as Sherlock’s tongue explored John’s lower lip, sucking gently as John tipped his head back and moaned. They leaned back until they were lying on the bed facing each other. Sherlock kissed him again, then rolled away and stood up. For a short second, John imagined that Sherlock had changed his mind, lost his nerve. But then he watched as he took off his jacket and hung it over the back of a chair. He slowly began to unbutton his shirt.
