He wasn’t sure how well that was going to go down amongst his family.
Natasha shook her head, closing the distance between them. Her footing was graceful, even in the snow, “He gave me the order after he broke up with you. He called me, told me to watch out for you. Protect you. Then he hung up.”
Tony came was a shudder, come coating both their stomachs where his cock was pressing between them. He groaned around Steve’s fingers, the sound muffled and not nearly as vocal as he’d normally be. Steve guided him through it, rubbing the little bundle of nerves until Tony had managed to wring out every bit of pleasure from his orgasm before he released Steve’s fingers and Steve slowly withdrew his own from Tony’s hole.
Howard sighed, “That’s the deal I’m afraid. I want new designs from you. One every month so I can win the support of the shareholders back and you get your way to bring down Rumlow. You’re losing me money, Tony. You need to replace it somehow.”
“Jesus, Tony.” He found himself saying despite his own warning, biting his lip to stop himself from saying anything else.
Steve spared a glance over his shoulder to Tony, he stood frozen in the doorway and paler than Steve had ever seen him. There were tears in his eyes, Steve met his gaze briefly then Bucky was screaming again, and Steve was back to him.
Tony nodded, “He grew up poor?”
He walked into the interview room, closing the door behind him with his foot. Steve startled at the sound; those blue eyes shocked at seeing Tony rather than another police officer in the room.
“Steve.” Tony got out, panting his name as he thrust his hips against the edge of the desk, “I’m ready.”
Tony threw a hand towards his bedside table, “Top drawer, with the condoms.” He answered with a roll of his hips.
“And my team? How do I know you won’t come after them?”
“So, he’s in the way.”
“Why didn’t you?”
Rumlow nodded, “Maybe. Although I’m eager to see whether you’ll change your mind, or The Captain will come for you first?”
He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t help Rumlow get shit. He could kill him right here in this dirty grey cell.
Tony watched as she spooned some sugar into four of the six mugs with a practised skill, “No?”
“Okay, let’s get you in the shower.” Steve said gently, hoping that by explaining what he was doing Tony didn’t freak out on him.
The silence is deafening, and Steve takes a moment to collect himself, eyes on the shell of a man before him. He stands up to his full height, putting the safety back on the gun in his hands, “I might have let you live if it wasn’t for that last comment,” Steve tells the lifeless body in his garage as he moves to place the gun on the worktop and grab the cleaning supplies from a bucket they kept down there for that very reason, “No one threatens my family.”
“He’s fine. Well, he’s whining a lot but we take that to mean he’s fine.” Sam replied, “Bruce said he’ll make a full recovery.”
“I told you, I’m all in. Whatever it was, it shook you, so I want to know about it.”
There was a part of him that knew it was foolish, that this thing between them wasn’t sustainable in any real sense. Rhodey would have him booked into therapy faster than he could blink, Rhodey was good like that. He always looked out for Tony, even when the mechanic wasn’t great at doing the job himself.
“So, you have a cat now?” The voice had him spinning on his heel to see his best friend standing behind him with an eyebrow raised in Peter’s direction. The cat was cradled to his chest as Peter set about making a bed for him in the office.
“He’s here to see me.” Tony replied quickly, “Personal stuff, kid. Why don’t you and Ned go grab lunch?”
Steve nodded, “Okay, sorry, I don’t mean to upset you.” The words were a whisper from his mouth.
“I’ll go see if Thor is in his room, get this body moved.” She said, placing her sponge back into the bucket, “Bright side? You finally have a reason to call your mechanic.”
Steve shook his head, “Yes, I am. I may not have killed Phillips Tony, but I have killed countless other people. Only last night I cut a man’s hand off then came back inside to dance with you like nothing happened and it didn’t bother me. Not once. I grew into the role of The Captain and I lived up to every violent story there is about me.”
“Yeah,” Steve sighed, eyes drifting away, “It really would.”
Steve couldn’t help the smile that crossed his face when he finally made it home to see Tony in his space. He had headed to the garage as soon as he relieved Bruce of his task and let him get back to a shift at the clinic downtown and now, Steve found himself stopping on the bottom step and just taking in the sight before him.
“I know I said it in the cell but…”
“Shift forward.” Tony told him softly, hands on the edge of Steve’s chair to steady himself. Steve understood where this was going, immediately locking his hands onto Tony’s thighs as he slid down into the seat a bit more, bringing his knees up higher so Tony had a bit more room to manoeuvre himself into a better position.
Tony beamed, “Captain, it would be my pleasure.” He laughed, pulling Steve towards him, “Bedroom eyes?”
Please believe me, Steve wanted to add.
“That was for Bucky.” He spat out bitterly, staggering to his feet and away from the body.
“We never asked for your protection, Steve. You gave us a chance, a family, a home. You picked up the people this world spat back out and you gave us a purpose. A way to make a difference. We all knew what we were signing up for.” She mused, “And we aren’t about to walk away now.”
Steve caught his gaze again, eyes burning, “Schmidt killed him. He slit his throat right there at the docks like butter. I killed Schmidt to even the score. Then when I told the gang what had happened they all looked to me to be the next leader. They started speculating whether I was telling the truth or whether I killed Phillips just to get him out the way.”
“Can you confirm your name is Steve Rogers?” Ross asked, eyes on the papers he’d brought with him.
“Swap with me.” Tony said as he pulled back, “You still have blood in your beard.”
Steve slammed his cock back in again, harder and faster. He turned slightly, moving Tony with him as Steve slipped a leg between his and Tony wrapped one of his around Steve’s calf. The angle let him go deeper and that let him go harder.
“Perfect timing actually,” Tony replied, “Just about done here. What do you think? I experimented with a new metal we have in at the shop to help enforce the dented patch, knocked the bodywork right out again. I had trouble matching the shade, that’s the issue with vintage cars. Always a nightmare to find the right stuff.”
Steve’s gaze was burning though, those eyes searching the depths of Tony’s soul, or at least that’s what it felt like. He wanted to pull the covers over his head and hide. Instead he reached out across the small space between them, fingers brushing against Steve’s bandage, small spots of blood had come through the fabric but nothing alarming and Tony allowed himself a moment of relief that Steve hadn’t been badly injured trying to get him back.
“Does that happen often?” Steve frowned because he definitely didn’t like the idea of Tony in danger. It did something weird to his insides as his stomach churned. He took another sip of whisky to try and wash the feeling away.
“Bucky has known Steve longer than any of us. He always used to say that he felt it was his job to protect Steve. When they were kids, in the army, especially now.” Natasha sighed, “If Steve gets hurts then he thinks it’s on him. He wasn’t quick enough; he should have talked Steve out of it.”
It was the next day when Steve came back from a run to find Natasha and Bucky arguing in the kitchen loudly, almost loud enough the he could hear it from outside, that he knew he couldn’t let this continue anymore.
Tony couldn’t handle this charade anymore, “Cut the shit. Let’s skip over the part where you play the doting father to the bit where you tell me why you’re working for Hydra and about how the fuck you sold your own son over to them for profit.”
Then Tony was moving, he was so fast that Steve could barely blink before Tony was moving in front of him, arm raised as his fingers flexed around the glove.
Tony didn’t answer but he helped Steve take off the jacket and let him lift the shirt of his head, lifting up his arms to help. Steve smiled encouragingly at him, that was good. Tony was consciously present at least. The blood stained his hands and there was a streak of it over his cheek and chin. Steve doubted he fared much better, but it looked wrong on Tony. The mark of blood on his perfect skin.
“Yes from me as well.” Bruce added. Steve saw the flash of a smile he aimed in Tony’s direction.
“You really need this?” Rhodey asked gently, face softening into a look Tony knew as resignation.
“Rhodey… will understand.” Tony sighed, “I hope. He’ll trust me. He’ll know if I’m doing this then there is a good reason. Besides, he hates Ross.”
“Just something I promised I’d do for T’Challa. Don’t worry.”
Howard smiled, “Tony, do you really think you can blackmail me?”
Didn’t he want this?
“I’m getting closer. Steve has been helping me for years, using his leads and contacts to get information. I’ll find him,” Thor said with a venom that Tony had never heard him possess before, “My point is, that darkness Steve and I both share. Steve knows if he fails this family, he’ll end up like me. He’ll be the same kind of monster I am but there won’t be anyone to save him like he saved me. He’ll do anything to stop that from happening.”
Rhodey frowned, “Where are you going?”
He felt a surge of pride rise up in him that only Tony seemed to bring out as Tony wrapped up his statement, “I will be staying on at Stark Industries as R&D support. From Monday I will be stepping down as CEO to focus on my own business, but I hand the reins over to Miss Pepper Potts, who will no doubt serve you all incredibly well in this endeavour. She has my full support and backing, and I hope you show her yours as well.”
Steve leaned forward, throwing Tony off balance enough to have him leaning back and baring his throat to Steve’s attention. His hands were already pushing the tank top up and off Tony’s body because it was just an annoyance at that point. Then Tony’s skin was bare to him again, all that tanned flesh and those dusty nipples begging to be touched.
“I didn’t sign up for this.”
“I’m going whichever way you’re going, soldier.” Tony replied with a smile. It gave way to a frown as he pulled his hand back from its place at Steve’s side. His fingers were slick with blood, “Did you get shot?!”
Tony scoffed, “Please, everyone knows Falcon’s is one of the best in town. Sam knows everyone.”
It appeared Ross was no fool.
“What about the company, the legacy?” Howard asked him, “We’ve secured a new contract. A lot of money coming in, a lot of new tech. This is big for us and I want you to be a part of it.”
“This is a dangerous game, Nick,” Steve warned, letting him know that he knew Fury’s name as well and that was a dangerous thing, “people who know my name don’t tend to live very long.”
Steve shook his head, “That’s not really my style.” He replied, “I am sorry about this though.”
Tony unbuckled the belt holding his trousers in place, releasing his mouth from Steve’s skin so he could work on getting rid of the trousers, his boxers and his shoes. When Tony was done and the clothing was in the growing pile on the floor, he watched as Steve’s cock stood proudly against his stomach, the red patch of skin he’d sucked a bruise into gleaming under the light.
Steve leaned back on the balls of his feet, “I can do this all day, but I would much rather be killing your boss so why don’t you tell me where I can find him?” Steve asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“I love you.” Steve told him, never tired of the joy those words brought him now.
They left him alone in the room after that, Steve watched the seconds tick by on the clock mounted on the wall as he waited for Ross. Another display of power he was making sure Steve understood. He ran the show now, Steve was simply there to watch.
“What about the others? How do we tell them…”
But he always found himself stopping by the bar at least once a week to check in. Sam came to the house frequently to see everyone but Steve preferred to see him like this, in his own environment. Sam was completely at ease here, mixing cocktails and flipping bottles with an easy smile and bartender banter. Just seeing him look lighter made Steve feel lighter.
Tony laughed, closing the door behind him as he kicked off his shoes and worked on undoing the buttons on his shirt, “More like there’s something missing.” He commented as he undressed.
Bucky sighed, “We’re fine.”
He was also quick, “I’m just getting warmed up. So, then there is the ease at which you kill people. We have you on nearly 20 kills alone, that’s without adding the collective kills of everyone in your gang. Damn, they say you even killed Phillips to take over his gang because you knew you could run it better.”
Tony did as he was told, hand moving off Steve’s bicep to his own neglected cock. He whimpered as he took himself in hand, softly stroking the length in his fist. Steve watched over his shoulder in fascination, seeing Tony pleasure himself only made Steve more aroused. God, he was beautiful.
Tony wasn’t sure what was happening, and he was desperately trying to catch up, “So I can go?”
Tony offered Steve his hand and Steve took it gently, savouring the warmth of their fingers together as he got to his feet, “I do love you. I tried not to. I didn’t want to. I know you didn’t do this to hurt me, that you wanted to protect me because that’s what you do. Steve Rogers, you haven’t met a thing you can’t protect by self-sacrifice. But you can’t pull that shit with me again, okay? I want to do this, but I want to be all in. I am all in, your family practically adopted me.”
Steve gasped as Tony mouthed him through the material of his boxers, tongue tracing the line of his cock and making his boxers wetter by the minute. He could feel the coil in his stomach, his hips gave a little thrust as Tony sucked against him and his breath hitched.
“Oh god no, Tony!” Rhodey threw his hands up, “Tell me you’re joking. Tell me you haven’t been fucking The Captain this whole damn time.”
Fury shook his head, “Careful Captain, I believe your Steve Rogers is showing.”
Steve brought his fingers up to his mouth, swirling his tongue over them to make sure they were slick enough for Tony. He didn’t keep lube in his office, and he wasn’t prepared to stop their administrations to hunt some down. As soon as Steve was satisfied, his fingers were back, circling the skin of Tony’s entrance before he pushed one inside.
Steve was more than willing to do just that, having Tony here and in his arms again after everything was enough for him to savour this moment. This chance for them to be together. There was still Rumlow and Ross and Hydra at their backs but right here, in his office with the door closed, there was something else as well. Something chemical and instinctive and addictive and as far as Steve was concerned it was radiating off Tony like the sun.
Natasha’s eyes were on Tony, “It’s the best chance we have.”
“The others are brainstorming; we’ll figure it out.” Tony told him, handing slipping off Steve’s back as he moved round to face him.
Fury nodded, “I’d imagine he’ll make sure your trial is a spectacle as well. He’ll make sure it’s drawn out and televised, everyone in the country will know your name and be out for your head when he’s done.”
Steve smiled then, hands squeezing Tony’s, “Except you.”
“Soon, Nat. Hydra will torture him to get information.” Steve could feel the bile in his throat like a lump of acid.
Tony was writhing, back arching up as Steve’s fist worked his cock and his cock sunk back into his hole. There were so many sensations for Tony that he couldn’t decid which to focus on, moving his body like an instrument to Steve’s administrations.
This was better. This little private moment as they danced in the hallway away from prying eyes. It was more intimate like this, without the world watching. It was just them. Tony hummed softly, the music coming through the corridor to guide them although neither was listening to it as they moved together. It wasn’t really dancing, there was no skill to it. They were simply holding each other and swaying but it was perfect. Steve could feel Tony’s heat, his mood was infectious.
Clint sighed, “I’m telling you, that wasn’t us. Think about it, it’s sloppy, when have we ever carved a mark into a victim? When have we ever killed anyone who wasn’t already a bad guy?” He pressed further, “If your boy was squeaky clean then you know it wasn’t The Avengers.”
“Buck?” Steve asked as he scratched a hand over his beard wearily.
Tony kissed him again, “I know the perfect place. You’re going to love it.”
There was a desk pressed against one side, paperwork stacked up on the right with a bunch of other files. A pen pot that had once been a mug occupied the left, along with a letter opener that stood out gleaming silver against the wood. Other than that the place was bare, not that anything else could fit into it.
Tony was nervous as he approached the interview room with Rhodey leading the way. Steve was only in the next room to him and he couldn’t help but wipe his palms on his jeans as he steeled himself to go in.
Ross nodded, “So, you tell me Hydra’s plan and I give your team immunity? That’s your play?”
Where did Tony Stark even come from?
Tony was as horny as Steve this morning.
“No.”
"I guess not." Tony replied, holding out his gloved hand and trying to shield his eyes from the power of the arc reactor.
Fury was getting impatient, “I agreed to my silence, you don’t need to threat me for dramatic effect.”
That was a thought for later though, right now his mind was on escape.
Steve shook his head, "This isn't a vote."
Steve tried to think about it, a life without his family. A life that wasn’t in Brooklyn.
Steve groaned again, crowding Tony in so his hands were firmly on Tony’s hips. Tony surprised him by spinning in the circle of Steve’s arms until his back was flush against Steve’s chest, Steve’s erection prodding him in the curve of his ass.
Steve did the move again, watching as Tony writhed beneath him like a crescendo in a musical number. He was beautiful and sinful and for now at least, he was all Steve’s. He increased his pace again, moving his head up and down faster then before until he could feel Tony in the back of his throat and smell his sweat. His nose was buried into Tony’s pubic bone on every thrust and Tony was practically vibrating with his arousal.
He was a God in those moments, playing life and death and destruction. The God of Thunder. The last sound someone heard as Thor brought the hammer down on their skulls.
"I'm a mob boss, Buck. I'm the King of Brooklyn. Do you really think they'd give me immunity after all the shit I've done?" Steve sighed, "I have to do this. I have to get him out and if I can save you as well then you best believe that's the play I'm going to make."
Rumlow ran a finger under Tony’s chin, “Maybe tomorrow. I’ll give you until then to change your mind on building the Jericho.”
Tony closed the gap between them, hands coming up to curve along Steve’s neck, “Maybe I can help with that? Get you out of your head?”
It was enough to raise alarm bells because Tony definitely remembered slamming it shut that morning in his haste to leave.
“I know. It should have been anyone else. I should have stopped it before it became anything more. But it wasn’t and I didn’t.” Tony sighed, “And I can’t stand here and apologise because I’m not sorry. He’s not what you think, Rhodey. He’s… I’ve never felt like this about anyone before.”
“I don’t know why, he barely knew us, but we agreed.” Natasha continued, “I got this family. I got this home. Bucky. I’ll never be able to repay him for that but if you make him happy then I’ll do everything I can to make sure he stays that way. He’s been adrift for too long.”
Steve tried to focus on Tony, those warm whiskey brown eyes, “You said you were staying in the car.”
“You’re using me for dramatic effect?” Steve asked lightly.
That caught Bucky’s attention and he uncrossed his arms, “You fell asleep? You stayed at his place? The whole night?”
“I am dying here.” He smiled, squeezing Tony’s shoulder as he stood up, “I can clock out early. Nothing’s happening on this gang case anyway.”
Tony pulled back when air became a requirement and Steve found it easier to breath with Tony’s eyes on him, but there was worry in them. He knew there was something Steve wasn’t saying, something he wasn’t ready to put between them. He didn’t poke at it though Steve knew he would eventually. Right now, Tony seemed to know it wasn’t what he needed.
The snow was falling fast, already collecting on the ground and Steve stopped to scoop some up. He pushed the cold snow into Tony’s burnt palm despite the other man’s slight flinch at that action.
“I don’t know.” Steve sighed, “I didn’t plan on it, Buck. You’re right, sometimes when I’m with him I forget about The Captain. I’m just plain old Steve Rogers except I don’t feel like I’m drowning. Isn’t that why you liked Nat, after Afghanistan she was the only person who made you feel like that.”
Tony blanched, letting his hand fall to his side and then he was moving. Steve was as well, meeting him half way.
“I’ll grant your team immunity once you’ve proven your information to be worth it. In writing because I know how paranoid you mob boss types get.” Ross agreed, “But I want something else as well.”
“Tony…”
“Hey Steve, do me a favour and whenever you’re done with T’Challa’s business, take the night off. You’re working too hard.”
“Detective Ross?” Rhodey pushed the door open and Tony couldn’t look away from the body on the ground with him, “Fuck. Tony.”
Steve’s hands were still gripping onto his thighs, “Are you sure you’re ready for…” He started, not wanting Tony to be uncomfortable for round two.
Steve sighed, “Hydra, it’s Rumlow. He’s in charge.”
Steve was back in his cell after his meeting with Tony and the cop, Rhodes, looked like he wanted to punch him every time Steve caught his eye. He understood perfectly, Tony hadn’t left much to the imagination with that kiss that Rhodes had walked in on.
Fury smiled, “For now. I’m sure I can come up with a few signatures on these for my report. You get immunity. They get immunity. I get Hydra off the streets. Everyone wins. I just need you to do your part and stay out of it.”
Fury nodded, not bothering with the pleasantries, “We’re in deep shit, Cap.”
“If there is, I’ll find it.” Steve replied gently, “I need to focus on Hydra. If I can get Rumlow to slip up, if I can get Ross to focus his energy there first then I’ll have time to come up with something.”
Then his vision went black.
Tony nodded as he felt Steve’s hand wrap around his cock, “Definitely not going to jail.” He muttered, eyes fluttering closed as he threw his head back at Steve’s first stroke of his cock.
“Of all the bars in all the towns.” The voice startled him, glass in hand as a body slipped into the seat next to him.
“But Steve’s okay, right?”
God, he loved this man, “You’re not right for me, either.”
“Bruce cooked French toast.” Bucky stated, moving around the door to reveal a plate in his hands, “Managed to swipe you some before Thor got down.” He placed the plate on the edge of Steve’s desk.
“Relax, no one is kidnapping you.” Steve hurriedly pointed out, “I don’t need missiles or whatever. Not really my speed.”
He hit the call phone, bring the phone to his ear and waited for Tony to answer. His surprised but happy voice came over the phone after two rings and Steve melted into it. He might have stayed up on the phone with Tony talking until the sky outside was starting to lighten and Tony reminded him they had to sleep because he definitely had work to do tomorrow but if he did then Steve decided it was no one else’s business but theirs.
Dark eyes matched the dark hair as they peered at Steve with a scowl, “That song is legendary, cutting it off is a crime.”
“You love it.” Steve replied.
Steve thought for a moment, “I’m not sure. Just drive I guess, see where I ended up.”
She leaned over and placed a hand on his, stopping his cleaning. Steve looked at her smaller, delicate hand on top of his, both pink with blood. They all carried horrors with them, “Is it. This family. That’s what we’re fighting for. Hydra isn’t going to win this one, Steve. We can’t let them.”
Tony’s eyes grew wide, the look in Steve’s face wasn’t good.
Tony was still rocking his hips slightly, riding out the after shocks of his orgasm as Steve slipped his hand out, wiping the mess of lube onto his jeans before moving his hand up to steady Tony’s body.
“Not the first one I’ve committed today, I assure you.” Steve grinned, crossing his arms over his chest to appear more threatening.
He should be getting in the shower and heading to the garage because he had a service coming in at lunchtime and a new part to install on Mr Kingsley’s Jeep and Peter definitely shouldn’t be left on his own for more than a few hours because otherwise he’d OD on subs from the sandwich shop on the corner.
Steve’s lips found his shoulder, the curve where the muscle met the skin of Tony’s neck and he bit down sharply. Tony cried out, hips stuttering as he came. Their hands a tangled mess coated with his cum as the rest of it spilled out onto the desk in front of them.
“They’re the enemy.” Thor finished, swinging the hammer in his hand, “I will leave no stone unturned. For Bucky.”
“Where would you go?” Tony asked, “If you could go anywhere?”
“Steve, please.” Tony pleaded, shoving his ass back against more, “More.”
“Would he help us?” Natasha asked.
The sound of his phone was too loud in the quiet space, a bump back to reality that had Bucky pulling back and squaring his shoulders and Steve digging into the pocket of his jeans for his phone.
Tony took a shuddering breath and Steve could see his shoulders uncoil, “I don’t want you to prove anything to me. I just want us to get through this. Together.”
Bucky was clearly not happy and he’s protectiveness often got masked by anger, so Steve knew he was in for a lecture when he got home. He quickly tapped a reply to Bucky, letting him know he was alive and would be home shortly.
It started to rain them, although neither of them moved, they both stared each other down as splats of rain fell around them, “How do you know I won’t just kill you after our business is done?”
Steve growled, “What did you say?”
He needed to get Tony back and he needed to make Hydra pay for thinking they could take him and it wouldn’t cost them their fucking heads.
Steve sent back his confirmation to wear the tux he had brought last year for a similar one of T’Challa’s events before shoving the invitation in his back pocket and heading out the door.
“Steve asked me too.”
The snow crunched under his feet, wet and slippery as it turned to slosh. He hated winter. Tony shoved his hands in his pockets with a scowl and kept moving, the sooner he was at the garage, the better.
Fury moved out of the way to let them past, “Thank you.” Steve nodded in his direction.
“We don’t have to do this.” Steve told him gently, “You can kick me out.”
Tony felt his gut clench, “Steve agreed to it so he must think it’s going to work.”
He felt the saw drop to the ground with a clang although he couldn’t recall dropping it. His eyes fixed on the body before him, the body he had hacked apart with nothing more than a saw and his own brute strength.
Steve smiled, “Is that right?”
“Sorry, Captain, I have orders not to take no for an answer.” Sitwell stated with a cocky expression and he used the move to jerk a hand towards his hip. Steve knew there was a gun there, his coat sat awkwardly on that side. Sitwell’s mistake was buttoning it up, if he left it loose like Steve’s own leather jacket then the gun on his hip would be practically invisible.
Steve wanted to thank him, he wanted to express how grateful he was to Fury in that moment for believing there was something in him worth saving because Steve wasn’t sure what it was. He didn’t though. The Captain didn’t do that, instead he watched as Fury walked back to his car, tucking his coat tighter around his frame.
“I’ll be in touch when we have the autopsy reports for the victims and we can go from there.” Fury told him.
Steve winced, “Enough.”
Natasha and Bucky were waiting for him across the street in a beat-up old Volvo, not one of Steve’s clearly but it helped them blend in. The atmosphere between them seemed charged, they were sitting there in silence as they waited for Tony and briefly he wondered whether they’d had an argument whilst he was gone.
Steve’s hand instantly went to the dried blood on his neck before he realised what he was doing. Why did he care what this stranger thought?
Steve knew it still had to hurt more than it helped though.
God, he loved him. When had that happened? But that was why he couldn’t let Tony throw away his whole life for someone like Steve. He loved him too much to drag him down into this mess with him and pretend it was love.
“Is that my jacket?” Fury asked with a raised eyebrow. Steve followed his line of vision to the word ‘Fury’ stitched into the right upper breast pocket.
He saw Sam smirk a little out of the corner of his mouth and Tony felt himself ease slightly.
Steve did as instructed, arms coming up around her as he sank into her, "This is going to be the fight of our lives."
Steve pulled him closely, not willing to have any space between them now they were this far in, his tongue invaded Tony’s mouth like a drowning man looking for the last sip of water and feeling Tony all but melt against him was payment enough.
Steve started off slowly, sliding out before pushing back in again, watching Tony writhe underneath him and try to pull him closer.
“Tony…” Steve started.
Clint took a bite of his sandwich, “Why not, your judgement hasn’t let us down yet.”
“That’s just Steve though,” Natasha said wistfully, “In his office upstairs he still has a baseball from a game him and Sam snuck into a week before they shipped out. He took me to a ballet show once for my birthday because he knew I loved it even though he had no idea what was happening, I have the ticket stub on my wall upstairs. Steve keeps his in a box in his desk draw along with Bucky’s army pin and a couple of other bits from the team.”
Steve gave him a watery smile, “What about Rhodey? And Peter? Your garage? Everything you worked to build here.”
He turned around to meet eyes clouded with betrayal and a firm stance. Steve swallowed thickly, words rushing to the surface before dying on his throat.
There were nods around the room, a silent acceptance that what Steve was about to tell them wasn't good. Just like that, those expectant and hopeful faces turned into dread and apprehension. All except Bucky of course, his best friend was looking at him with a fixed gaze and a plea in his eyes for Steve to fix this and get to the punchline of a bad joke already.
Steve sucked hard at Tony’s neck, “I’m serious.”
“Steve?” Bucky’s voice asked through the phone, he was concerned and confused as to why Steve was calling him so soon after their meeting.
Tony couldn’t argue with that and Bucky definitely didn’t want to be having this conversation. He let it drop, focusing on navigating the traffic to get to his father’s empire.
Tony shuddered in his corner, “Steve?”
He went back to kissing Steve’s neck, teeth grazing his earlobe and Steve almost forgot how to speak, debating just throwing Tony down and taking him right there in the kitchen.
“Take a seat.” Eye-Patch stated into the room that left no space for discussion.
Steve was already waiting when Tony arrived, his leather jacket was zipped up to keep out the cold and the waves crashed into the rocks behind it. It might have been beautiful if the weight of what he was about to do didn’t cling heavily in his chest.
“Wait!” Sitwell cried, “I know that whatever his plan is, he’s recruiting for it. He has big things in place. He wants to hit you where you live. He wants to watch the downfall of the King of Brooklyn; he wants to kill everyone in your family while you watch.”
He saw the flicker of a hundred different emotions dance across Tony’s eyes as he finished his work.
Tony didn’t reply, forcing himself to focus on the task ahead as he pulled into the Stark Industries underground garage with an ID code that he hadn’t used since he was seventeen and was surprised still worked. He knew that was going to be the easiest bit about today.
“He’s probably disease ridden.” Tony pointed out with a frown.
A blunt object striking the back of his head hard enough to make his eyes water and his ears ring. He heard a muffled voice behind him, felt a bag being shoved over his head and then he felt his legs give out under him.
Steve watched him go, hating every fibre of his being for lying to Tony. It had to be done if this was going to work though.
His family would be safe and untouchable in the eyes of the law. They’d just need to pick up the pieces of what was left of Hydra. It was perfect. They’d need someone to blame when Steve got sentenced and he knew they’d make sure Hydra was dead and buried in the ground before his trial. His team were efficient like that.
Tony frowned, “The war with Hydra.”
Tony hummed again, “Or something wrong. Seems a little lonely to me.”
“I’m coming with you, Cap.” Sam told him, crossing his arms, “If this is the last thing I can do to help you then I need to do it. Besides, Rumlow isn’t going to come easy.”
He was right.
Steve pushed in slowly, inch by inch as Tony stretched around him until he was buried to the hilt inside him. Steve waited there for a moment, Tony’s eyes were closed again and he was taking Steve just the right way and Steve felt him grip the back of his neck.
“How did they even manage to take him?” Tony asked, everything clicking into place, “He set himself up. For us.”
“You know what I mean.” Bucky replied, “This job, this life. It isn’t for everyone and you’re not like us, Tony. That’s a good thing. But it doesn’t make Steve any safer and I’m the one who has to pick up the pieces when you decide you can’t do this anymore. When being with a mob boss gets too much for you.”
Steve didn’t even blink as he shot him. One bullet lodged into his shoulder and the Hydra man screamed out in pain, cuffs rattling against the metal of the radiator as he tried to move. Steve watched the steady bloom of blood seeping through his clothes.
Steve knew what she was getting at with the subtle push out the door. She wanted him to go and destress, to come back to them with a clear head and a plan they could work with.
“I know you think you can’t have things, that you can’t want things but you’re not just The Captain. I see you, Steve. You didn’t come after me yesterday because it made smart gang sense to get me back, you came after me because you care about me. That’s not a move The Captain would make from what I understand.” Tony replied.
Tony let out a heavy breath, eyes slipping closed at the feeling of Steve’s finger inside of him. Steve pumped it a few more times before adding a second finger. Tony’s cock jerked and he let out a moan that he managed to cut off with a bite of his lip. Steve continued working him open, fingers scissoring in and out of him as he watched the thin sheen of sweat coat Tony’s skin. He was almost glowing, happy and unburdened and Steve’s. Always Steve’s.
“Is that blood?” He asked before he could stop himself, putting the toolbox down and heading over to inspect the car.
“I don’t have a condom, shit.” Steve replied, cursing himself for not thinking of it beforehand.
Steve found Tony immediately, eyes drawn to him over by the drinks table. He’d been cornered by one of the politicians in a designer suit and seemed to be faking his way through a conversation Steve was sure he didn’t want to have. He approached him, set on rescuing his date from being drawn into a political debate when he noticed who Tony was talking to. The hideous fake tan looked worse under the lights and his hands were a shade darker than his face. Justin Hammer. Tony’s voice was dry and bored.
“Our new boss.” Sitwell smirked, “Hydra’s entering a new age and our new leader isn’t scared of you.”
“Tony…”
Steve’s eyes darted around them at the increase of Bucky’s voice, “Not here. Call a family meeting, tonight after Sam gets off work. I need everyone there. Please Buck, I need you to trust me on this.”
His hips stuttered, whole body shaking as his orgasm hit him hard. He was coming as he breathed into Tony’s sweaty skin, filling up the condom with his cum and feeling Tony’s fingers play with his hair.
Steve shook his head, “We don’t have time.” He reminded Tony quickly, slipping a hand into the one not encased in the arc reactor technology and turning on his heel to go back they way he’d come.
“I joined the army to help people and I think I took more lives than I saved.” Steve sighed, “You get an order, you follow it. You don’t always agree with it. I couldn’t live like that so when I got back it was like nothing had changed in Brooklyn. I fought for peace a million miles away, but my own home was suffering. I joined Phillips’ gang because I couldn’t look at those streets and see it anymore. I liked it, being able to make a difference and see those same streets changing. It felt like it mattered. That’s why I took over, because if I didn’t then all that fight and change would have been for nothing.”
Fury frowned but kept up with him, “You got that from some dirt?”
Rumlow frowned, “Palladium?”
Tony looked cold, a red tint to his nose and cheeks as he shoved his hands in his pockets and jogged across the street to meet Steve. His whiskey brown eyes looked worried and it took everything Steve had not to instantly wrap Tony up in his arms. He couldn’t, it’d make this so much harder.
Steve kept pacing, mind turning. How could Hydra know about Tony? Had they been following him? What was the plan now they had him? Steve hadn’t received any demands and he couldn’t help but think Hydra would want to rub this in his face.
Natasha’s smile only grew, “Let’s head back to the house. Everyone is there.”
This kiss was filled with everything to come. A future, a life. It was a promise and a declaration of everything they felt and wanted to express. Steve took his time exploring Tony’s mouth like it was the first time and he felt Tony shuffle closer, right to the edge of the counter. He was trusting Steve’s weight to support him and Steve made sure to grip his legs firmly in his hands as they kissed.
Steve shrugged, meeting his gaze for the first time, “I don’t know. Maybe I hit my head, or the bomb went off. It doesn’t matter. I walked for days until I found people, I was half dead by then. When I made it back stateside everyone thought I was dead, and they gave me a medal for it. For dying, how messed up is that? Presented it to Bucky like it was a trophy.” Steve bit out a stale laugh, “I met Phillips shortly after. I needed cash but I had no identity. I was a dead man and once again I was poor. He gave me a job in his gang. Street level work, collecting payments and issuing threats. That sort of thing. I moved up the ranks pretty quickly, and so The Captain was born.”
Steve frowned, “Well, if that’s all you know I guess I have no more use for you.”
Tony’s hands were already moving, fingers mapping out the planes of Steve’s chest, across the valleys and dips of his body as Tony ducked his head down to nip and lick at Steve’s collarbone.
“Make sure our new friend finds his way out,” Steve asked Natasha as he breezed past her, “And tip him extra.” He was moving again before Natasha could utter a word or even look up from her sandwich. She’d handle it, she always did.
When it was over, wound no longer bleeding but scarred and burnt beyond recognition, Bucky was still ghostly pale and unconscious. Steve was almost thankful he didn’t have to hear his best friend scream again. He stood up gently, making room for Natasha to take his place as Bruce cleaned and dressed the wound.
Yet Tony was still moving closer, lips grazing the underside of Steve’s jaw as he stretched upwards. Steve was reaching for him as well, despite his words, fingers pulling at the shirt Tony had knotted around his waist.
“The turf war, the cops are bringing in a specialised unit to get the gangs out of Brooklyn. I’m at the top of their Christmas list.” Steve replied with a grimace that told Tony he was deadly serious.
“Yeah, we pulled in one of The Captain’s guys but we couldn’t hold him or get anything out of him. Those gangs are going to be the death of this town, everyone is too scared to arrest them so they just get away with everything.” Rhodey took a sip of the coffee, his brow furrowed in annoyance at the situation.
Rumlow hit him again and Steve could feel blood on his face, a trail of liquid trickling out of his nose. He let out a breath, waiting until Rumlow brought his fist up to strike again and then he acted. He had sparred with Thor and Bucky enough to know how to deal with an opponent like Rumlow. He was open just before the hit and Steve used that. He brought his own fist up, punching once at the soft tissue of Rumlow’s armpit and then jabbing him hard in the stomach. The move startled Rumlow and knocked the air from his lungs which was all Steve needed to throw him off balance. He rolled them over, arms on Rumlow’s jacket as he slammed him against the ground.
“Tony,” He breathed, hands moving to Tony’s hips, “We can’t. Not here.”
Tony took a sip of his coffee, bitter and sweet on his tongue. The voices had quietened down from the floor above now and Tony found himself relieved that they were no longer fighting because of him. He caught sight of the design on the mug in his hands and raised his eyebrow. The words ‘The Boss’ were written in all black capital letters across the china.
Bruce nodded, "You think immunity is the only way we stay out of jail."
She gave him a dry smile that didn’t reach her eyes, “Come on, I need to make sure they haven’t killed each other up there.”
“Cum for me, Steve.” Tony crooned, hand back in Steve’s hair as he sucked a bruise over Tony’s pectoral, above his heart, “Let me feel you.”
“Are we alone? Or do you have people waiting for this to turn ugly?” Fury asked, eyes never leaving the sea. His eye-patch was in place, as always, and Steve had always wondered what had happened that made Fury think eye-patches were the way to go.
He moved a hand down to wrap around Tony’s, both encompassing his cock as Steve guided his hand to set the pace. They worked Tony’s cock together, stroking his length at a faster pace than before.
The phone call with Peter was shorter. Mainly because Peter had clearly been asleep when Tony had phoned, and he sounded so tired that Tony felt guilty for even calling him in the first place. He told the boy to take tomorrow off, they had nothing scheduled to do tomorrow anyway and he told him to cook Aunt May a nice meal, that pasta dish Tony had told him to make. Peter promised he would give it a try and bring Tony some leftovers to the shop the following day. Tony knew he had to let him go back to sleep when Peter’s replies got slower and slower. He bid him a goodbye, trying to keep the emotion from his voice and the relief that Peter was perfectly fine from choking him.
He needed to see him, to help him. Tony must be freaking out, he’d be scared. Had Fury left him alone to get Steve, he shouldn’t have left him alone. Tony wasn’t built to kill, not like Steve. Steve had been given a gun and told to go to war. He had trained his body to be comfortable with the act of taking a life. He understood it on its most basic level, kill or be killed. He had adapted to it. Tony hadn’t signed up for that. Tony was good and thoughtful and cared so deeply. This would destroy him.
Tony shook his head, “Don’t fucking touch him.”
There was a pause at the other end, even Tony had stopped walking. Stood next to the car with his hands in his pockets, watching Steve with curious eyes.
Bucky nodded, “Same. We had to kill a few guys trying to get back into the building though, didn’t want you to get overrun.”
Tony’s hand found his, gripping it fiercely as he turned back to look at Steve again, “We’ll do it together, for every little boy who grew up alone and scared and dealing with shit they shouldn’t ever to.”
Steve was closing the gap between them in seconds. It was like he was sinking, drowning. His mouth and nose filling up with water and Tony was the only anchor left. Their mouths met furiously, Steve was taking and demanding, and Tony was giving it all up. Everything he needed was right there, in his hands and he was losing it faster than sand through his fingers.
He shoved at Steve’s chest firmly, breaking their kiss and catching Steve off guard with the move so that he flopped down on the bed behind him, body bouncing against the plush material. Tony stood over him with a wicked grin, he liked this.
T’Challa was mingling but was easy to spot, he always did manage to command the room. He beamed when he saw Steve, his conversation coming to a stop. Steve smiled back, watching the shock of T’Challa’s guests as The Captain stepped into their inner circle.
What was he doing?
Steve kept his pace, hand and hips working in tandem to bring Tony into oblivion. Just a little more, “Come for me, sweetheart.” The name tumbled from his lips before Steve could stop it and Tony was tumbling into his pleasure soon after.
“I’ll wash it.” Steve promised, “Also I left Rhodes in the locker room. He’ll have a headache when he comes around.”
Tony’s body shivered but still he slept on, Steve placed a kiss on his hipbone as he settled himself in the space between Tony’s thighs. He was already hard, the excitement and desire for Tony pooling in his gut the second he crawled onto the bed to join him. Tony was sporting morning wood, his cock half hard and curious to the attention.
Bruce shrugged, “Probably not. But he clearly like you.”
The hands in his hair moved back to his shoulders, Tony slowly moving back and forth to try and gain some friction from the finger Steve was working inside him. The lube made it easier for him to bury the digit into Tony’s hole, moving it in and out for a couple of thrusts to make sure Tony was coated in the lube as well.
So, Hydra was looking into getting a few politicians under their belt. Rumlow was getting busy. He’d need them if he ever hoped to move bombs on the black market, “Rumlow’s upgrading, huh?”
“I’ll start pulling army files although without a face it’s going to be difficult.” Fury replied.
“If you kill me, you’ll still have to deal with Ross.” He warned Steve, “You think he’s just going to let you ride off into the sunset with your family and your boyfriend?”
“Right,” Steve explained, “I managed to work out a deal with Fury in return for my help. To keep you all safe, it’s a sacrifice. We’re all going to have to do things we might not like.”
“A new design every three months.” Tony countered, “I have my own job to do as well.”
Steve shrugged, “No, I wasn’t planning on leaving but things change. Rumlow went after my family.”
Rhodey pulled back gently, bodily forcing Tony into the nearest chair as he crouched down next to him, “You’ve got to clue me in on this one, Tones.”
“Gang members.” Steve corrected.
There was a playful little nip against his throat that Steve shouldn’t have found as hot as he did and then it was like a dam had burst for both of them. The need and desire for each other overwhelming the teasing and slow exploration.
“You staring at it intensely isn’t going to make it catch fire.” Bucky jested from the seat next to him, hands resting on the wheel.
“Wrong again.”
Steve wanted to run, he wanted to open the door and put the broken pieces of his family back together, but he couldn’t. It wasn’t his place.
“Are you crazy?” Bucky asked, “We can’t just storm a police station.”
Tony moaned against his neck, “I can’t…”
“It was the right thing to do for you. I didn’t get a say.”
“Captain?” Clint asked.
In the back of his mind, Tony had to remind himself why he needed to create a weapon. It wasn't for commercial destruction or profit. It was for survival. He needed to get out of there, he needed to make sure Peter and Rhodey were safe from Hydra and he needed to make sure Steve knew who he was dealing with. He could destroy it as soon as he was out and safe, no one but him would see this technology.
Tony watched as Steve finished unwrapping his hand, fingers working to fold the fabric neatly in his lap, “Afghanistan.”
Thor was back up and on the second guy as soon as the hammer was free from the first man’s face and Steve didn’t envy the end, he knew that guy would meet it at Thor’s hand. He’d worked with Thor for three years now, recruited him straight out of a hole in the wall where he was looking for his brother’s killer. Thor had gladly accepted Steve’s offer at a home and a family, the kind with power and the ability to get answers. Thor wanted revenge for Loki and Steve was determined to help him, hoping to bring peace to the haunted man who had become part of his family.
“But look at him!” Peter replied, stroking the cat’s fur as he climbed into the Kid’s lap, “He likes us.”
“Captain.” Fury greeted him, his tone wasn’t harsh or biting like Steve had expected but almost amicable.
“Do you know who I am?” Steve asked instead, watching as the Mechanic grabbed a wrench and went back to work on the bike in front of him.
“Okay, now you have to ask me the same question.” Tony prompted.
Steve shoved him to the ground, there was something satisfying about watching Pierce snivel around in the dirt. He leaned down, pulling the knife out of his shoe, Natasha had made him bring it when he refused to take a gun to T’Challa’s party. He was grateful she had.
“Let me handle it.” Fury insisted, “Your guy got a name?”
“You’re having quite the day.” Steve mused, forcing down the feeling of dread in his gut.
“It’s business.” Howard snapped, “We’re a weapons manufacturer. It goes with the territory. If it makes you feel uncomfortable then come back to the company, we’ll set up some charity events and make some donations. You need to think about the bigger picture, Tony. You can’t survive without money and this is how we make it.”
The blast he had just set off had knocked back five men blocking his path, he always made sure to aim it at their feet rather than directly at them. Broken bones and concussions he could live with but he wasn't sure he wanted murder was on his list of achievements.
It was reckless, asking for a few things that weren’t in his father’s original designs, but Tony knew just from looking at him that Rumlow wasn’t a man of intelligence, he was a man of action. He was a battering ram. Tony could use that to his advantage.
“This that an offer?” Steve teased him.
The television camera spanned over Tony’s appearance to give his statement, looking both impressive and rigid in his pressed three-piece suit as Steve shifted forward in his seat, trying to get closer to the screen as if Tony could see him.
He was so tired he felt it in his bones, having been up early that morning to scout the new meeting spot as a favour for Steve. He’d forgotten to have his morning coffee fix as well so he was running on no caffeine. It was his own fault; he had heard sobs coming from Natasha’s room – which was next to his – and Clint was up like a shot. It was a nightmare that had her calling out in a way she never would have done if she were conscious. Natasha prided herself on her thick skin and Clint knew if it had been anyone else but him that had gone to check on her, she would have been mortified.
He couldn’t stop shaking though and when he opened his mouth, he was almost ashamed to hear the ragged breathes that torn through his throat. Is this what it felt like to survive? To look evil in the eye and call it by its name?
care about you. They just want to keep this family together.”
“Hydra took Tony.” He replied.
“I think I’m addicted to you.” Steve laughed, one hand gently massaging Tony’s thigh.
“That’s stupid,” Steve commented with a scowl, “Why would we advertise who we kill?”
Tony could feel everything rushing up inside him, all the sadness and anger and betrayal like a lump in his throat as he looked at Steve so he did what he always did, he hid it under layers of sarcasm, “Orange really isn’t your colour, you know?” He greeted, taking small tentative steps towards Steve.
He definitely couldn’t tell Rhodey about being hired to fix The Captain’s bike or the impromptu make out session with the King of Brooklyn because he was pretty sure that didn’t count as a smart choice. But that was okay because he’s probably never heard from him again anyway, it was a blip of impulsiveness in a sea of smart decisions. A little blip, Tony was allowed. It’s not like he joined the gang or even fucked a mobster. It was just one little kiss; he wouldn’t even think of it again.
Fury was close enough to smash his foot into the back of Steve’s calf forcing him down whilst he cuffed his hands behind his back, “You’re a goddamn son of a bitch, you know that?” Fury whispered harshly in his ear as he secured the cuffs.
It was already dark by the time Tony made it back to his apartment building, the winter nights pulling in the darkness early and dropping the temperature fast. It had to have been near freezing when Tony parked up and started the ascent to his condo on the top floor. The apartment block was always cold in the stairwell, just bricks and concrete that did nothing to protect from the cold weather, even the metal handrail was frigid against Tony’s palm as he climbed.
Clint let out a chuckle, “You rehearse that?”
“I don’t know who he is.” Tony insisted and it was partly true. Steve had never offered him a last name and a backstory. How much did Tony really know about the man other than he was a mob boss, he had killed people and he was a good fuck?
“What was that?” Tony pressed, coffee all but forgotten on the side as he listened.
Tony shifted as well, shoving a hand under his head as he got settled, eyes locked with Steve’s. They weren’t touching, a small sliver of space kept between them, yet it felt oddly intimate to be like this with Steve. They were both naked and without their metaphorical armour. They’d never done this before. The lazy indulgence in each other, normally they were busy redressing or rushing off somewhere else.
“This is going to hurt.” He warned Bucky, although it was unclear if Bucky was even lucid. Bruce clamped his palm over the wound with a wad of gauze, using his own strength to slow down the blood pooling from the injury. Bucky screamed in agony; eyes suddenly more alert. His other hand reached for Steve, fingers curling into the neck of Steve’s shirt and tugging so hard he almost pulled Steve over.
Steve nodded, “Thanks Sam. One vote for yes. Anyone else.”
Steve smiled, “I’ll buy you a new one.” He promised.
Steve let out a chuckle, “You want to tell me what it is?”
He was out of the car without waiting for the others, the adrenaline and anger coursing through him reminded him of his time in the army. You put one foot after the other and you keeping going. Don’t stop, don’t hesitate otherwise you’re dead. That training had stayed with him and even now Steve felt like a livewire. He was constantly in motion. He could feel Tony’s gaze on him as he got out the car with the others to join him.
“Maybe your style changed.” Rhodes cut in, “The body was found at the docks. Your Captain is known to do frequent business there.”
Together.
Tony wasted no time in doing just that, his rhythm was shaky as he allowed himself a few shallow thrusts into Steve’s mouth, feeling out what worked for him. Steve encouraged him with a squeeze of his ass cheeks, lifting Tony up higher to thrust in further. He could take it and Tony needed the relief.
Steve shook his head gently, “When we get him back.”
“Is this what you want, sweetheart?” Steve asked him roughly, the heel of his hand pressing against his cock.
Tony stepped closer to him, more water running down their bodies and turning the stall floor a dusty pink, “I can’t stop seeing him, lying there…” Tony looked away for a moment to collect himself and Steve gave it to him, “Does it ever stop?”
Steve sighed, “Someone gave them the order to attack us though, and I’d quite like to find out who that is.”
Tony wanted to laugh, “I can’t tell if you’re being serious.”
Bucky cut in, “I saw an opportunity and I took it. We need to find out who’s behind Hydra, we need to get a name.”
They headed out to the car together, Steve saw no signs of Pierce crawling across the car park though. No trails of red to show he was even there. Tony led the way; Steve couldn’t help but watch his every move looking for signs of repulsion or fear. He found none.
Then Tony was moving, slowly and teasingly. He used his knees to move himself up and down on Steve’s lap, allowing Steve to thrust into him shallowly. Their pace was gently, almost sweet, like they had all the time in the world to just feel this.
Steve's smile grew. That mean Tony was still alive. That meant he was close, "Before we get started, does anyone want to leave?"
It was a thing of beauty, the soft blue glow encased in a small metal circle the size of Tony's palm. It almost looked serene and ghostly in its appearance, hiding a powerhouse of energy that could probably fry a man. Or when channelled, blow the lock off a metal door.
“Quiet, remember?” Tony teased, nipping at his jaw as he stroked the length of him from base to tip.
“By pulling a gun on everyone in this city and calling it protection.” Steve accused.
“I thought you were going to fuck me, not cuddle me.” Tony quipped.
“What’s the right question?” Fury asked cautiously, eyes meeting Steve’s for the first time.
The Captain, animalistic and angry and dangerous. This was what he was capable of. Now he knew.
The warm in his palm tingled slightly but Tony ignored it, he braced his feet on the ground and grit his teeth, preparing himself for the force of energy that he knew was coming. With a squeeze of his heavy gloved fingers around the metal, a familiar hum and a beam of pure energy aimed at the metal, Tony watched as the lock practically melted. The metal sparked, smoke filling the room before a disformed beeping echoed in Tony's ears and the door blasted open.
He did it again, moving his fingers out to the tip before thrusting them back in, waiting until they were deep inside Tony to curl them forward again and hit his prostate. Tony’s eyes fluttered close, cock jerking against his stomach and Steve could feel him gripping his shoulders a little tighter.
Steve’s eyes grew wide, “You don’t get scars like that from punches.”
He had to move, Rhodes could wake up or someone else could walk in and Steve couldn’t knock out every cop in the station. He shrugged on Fury’s jacket and slipped the baseball cap low on his head to hide his face. It wasn’t a brilliant disguise, but it would have to do.
“That’s a lot of bombs.”
“People who know my name don’t tend to live very long.” Steve replied, the weight of the threat in the air but Tony seemed to breeze past it.
Steve nodded, “I’ll talk to them tonight. You can come by the house and pick them up tomorrow.”
Steve went back to watching the film, stealing some popcorn from Sam’s bowl and tried not to stare at his phone like a lovesick teenager. He had no idea what was happening with the film, having missed a large chunk of it due to his internal debate but he tried to play catch up and laugh when everyone else did.
Or, at least, that had been the plan once.
Steve nodded, “Okay Tony, let’s go wash this off, yeah?”
Steve laughed, “I think this power is going to your head.”
Tony’s hand sped up a little more, thumb swiping over the tip as he pumped himself. Steve could feel his stomach getting tighter.
He could help Steve and carve out a safe pocket in the streets of Brooklyn for other people.
“Of course, Captain.” Thor replied and he was off as well.
“I have to do this, Tony.” Steve sighed, trying to look away but Tony held him firmly, “I have to get Rumlow off the streets and out of this city. I have to…”
And just like that, they were back to the way they always were. Planning their survival and plotting to make the world a bit safer for their family. Steve needed that. “I’m waiting for T’Challa to get back to me with a list of returning army vets. See if any names pop up, it’s a long shot but it’s a start. I need you and Nat to start following Hydra members. I want to know who they meet, where, why.”
Steve grit his teeth and pushed back, “Go to hell.”
Steve gave him a soft smile, “I have you. I have our family. I surround myself with people I love because that way, if I slip and I fall back into that pattern of letting them win, I have to deal with the fact I failed this family, and I can’t. I can’t fail you.”
The bullet lodged into the guy’s neck, thick blood oozing out of the wound and onto Steve’s skin as he let the body fall to the floor. He kept his eyes on the body, watching the last twitches of life bleed out onto the cold concrete beneath him before he straightened himself out again and drew his eyes back to Thor.
“Are you a love them and leave them type?” Tony asked, “Or can you stay for a bit?”
He breathed out harshly, “Have you called the lawyer?”
Fury nodded, “He needs to shower and change. Third floor, there is a locker room with a shower unit attached. Take the back stairs so no one sees either of you. Rhodey will bring you clothes. I’ll grab some evidence we can put with the body to confirm he’s Hydra.”
But at least he’d be free and alive. He wouldn’t be serving a life sentence in a cell next to Steve’s and driving himself crazy that Loki’s killer was still walking free whilst he was in chains.
Tony bit his tongue, “I’ll stop you.”
Despite the weather, and the obvious turn that meant snow was definitely soon on the way Tony felt pleasantly warm. The encounter with Steve and their new found acceptance at whatever it was between them was still playing over in his mind and Tony still felt the warm of Steve’s shower on his skin. It all honesty, he wasn’t expecting to come away from Steve’s house with a mob boss on speed dial for his every sexual desire, but Tony wasn’t about to complain, especially when that mob boss looked like Steve.
“No, but I intend to find out.” Tony teased, grabbing Steve’s hips before flopping backwards onto his bed.
Tony moaned, grinding his erection against Steve’s palm as his fingers burrowed into the hair at the nape of his neck, “I want you inside me.”
Tony pushed up against him and Steve took that as his sign to move, he started off slowly, shallow thrusts that teased the ebb of his pleasure at a constant level rather than increasing it. It was torture and teasing but it was worth it to hear the hitch in Tony’s breath and the feeling of his walls around him without a barrier.
This one was on Tony and he was determined to survive.
Tony pushed his hands away, “He didn’t touch me.” Tony promised, “I thought he was special, I thought we… I was wrong, the sun came up and reality set in.”
If he got up now, he could be in by lunchtime and then he could just work through till the evening to make up his hours. He had a convertible to look at and an oil change to do for Mr Shaw. Tony nodded, sitting up in bed and tried to ignore the slight burn from last night.
“You think he loves you. He doesn’t. He isn’t capable of love, a monster like that never will be. I’m doing you a favour by showing it to you now.” Ross replied, keeping his voice even despite the waver Tony could see in his eyes.
Steve pushed his lips against Tony’s, pushing his fingers deeper inside him and curling them forward. Tony bucked against him, mouth falling open in a gasp against Steve’s as a bolt of pleasure shot through him.
Of course, Howard was just the tip of the iceberg.
“What does that mean?” Steve hissed out, voice low and harsh.
Steve punched him and Rhodes hit the deck, out cold. Steve sighed, moving him into a more comfortable position against the lockers. Rhodes would have a hell of a headache and a bruise, but he’d be fine, and he wouldn’t be able to sound the alarm as Steve tried to make his escape. Tony would be pissed though.
Tony’s hands gripped at his hips, keeping him against the mattress as he slid his tongue over the head of Steve’s cock before taking him back into his mouth. He repeated the action over and over again, withdrawing and swirling his tongue over the tip of Steve’s cock just the way that drove him mad before sinking back in again until Tony couldn’t take him anymore.
That frown turned into dread curling in his chest when he read the top line. The immunity deals. Fury must have had someone post them through the door yesterday and someone must have picked it up and placed it in Steve’s office for him to sort through with the rest of the mail.
“It was his idea.” Natasha insisted, “We need to go.”
“Steve.” Tony mewled, breathless and wanting.
Tony was showered, dressed, on his second coffee and ready to head to the garage in an hour. His hair was still a mess, but he felt better and was more than ready to put in the hours he needed at work. He grabbed his jacket and keys off the coffee table and headed for the front door. He felt good, like today would be a good day.
“You know, when I became a cop it was because I wanted to help protect this city.” Fury reclined in his chair, “It wasn’t glory or recognition. It was about making a change. Being a cop allowed me to do that. I think that’s why you do what you do. Same reason as me, different methods.”
Steve felt his stomach clench, without Fury’s help his team were in danger of getting arrested for this, “They can’t do that. You’re working leads. You’re still investigating.”
There was a beat. A moment where Tony thought he was going crazy and then a figure walked into view. Black coat, brilliant red hair. Natasha.
Steve refused to let that happen.
The first touch of his prostate had him calling out and bucking off the bed against Steve’s hand in pleasure. Steve watched in awe as Tony’s back bowed and his toes curl and he had to do it again just to watch the way his face changed and his hole gripped Steve’s fingers at the sensation.
“I had to.” Tony uttered, every syllable breaking Steve’s heart.
Tony never wanted the company, Steve knew. He didn’t want Howard’s legacy or money. He was a mechanic and that was what he loved in his heart. Steve had told him to be true to that, following his heart had brought them together after all.
Steve moved his fist quickly, jerking him off with the tight circle of his fingers and a flick of his wrist at the end of each stroke to get him there faster. Tony was babbling, Steve couldn’t make out words but he was shoving his ass firmly into Steve’s groin and gripping the bedsheet so tightly the corner had come away from the mattress.
The beginning of the end.
“You should stop by the house. Bucky will be happy to share a drink and a few memories with you.” Steve replied.
“You had to walk into mine?” Steve finished, turning in his seat to take in those brown eyes that had plagued his mind since their kiss in his garage.
“You’re driving me crazy,” Steve groaned, hands squeezing Tony’s thighs softly.
Once he started talking, Steve couldn't stop. He poured everything he knew into what felt like hours but must have been minutes. He told them about Fury and how he helped him get Hydra for the cop killings. He told them about Rumlow, and Hydra's take over. He told them about how dire the situation was, about how he couldn't see a way out of this one. He told them about Ross and his eventual manhunt. He explained the bargain he struck with Fury; the immunity deals that currently rested in Bruce's hands as he tried to read through them. Steve told them everything and when he was done he didn't really any better.
Nat and Clint were close, Steve had recruited them to his side together. Two punks stealing to get by and making a name for themselves as guns for hire. They seemed to think he was worth the loyalty though because Steve had never had the need to doubt them and knew both would have his back in a fight.
“Then we’ll leave.” Steve promised, “Then I’m done. I’m out.” He vowed, giving Tony that same room in his heart that Tony had given to Steve.
Tony nodded, running a hand over the book in his lap, “Did it?”
He stood back, stumbling with the weapon in his hand as Ross’ body fell to the ground without Tony’s help holding him up. Blood was still pooling out of the wound, so much blood. Too much blood.
“He’ll recover.” Steve bit out, “And I promised him I’d cut off your head to even the score.”
“Don’t do that.” Tony spat, “You don’t give a shit. Tell me why I’m here instead of in cuffs.”
“A job application for what?” Steve frowned, “I’m about to be committed for murder.”
They had kissed at the station but that had been a ploy on Tony’s part to give him the device, he had pushed pass all those feelings of hurt and insecurity to get the job done. Steve would have done the same. But Steve had kissed him back, eager and joyful. Just like he always kissed Tony, with the fine line between sweet and sinful.
“What? Do I have something on my face?” Steve asked with a shy boyish smile.
Steve dug his phone out of his pocket, hitting the call button when he found the number he was looking for. It rang three times before there was an answer.
He hates killing people sometimes, even when they deserve it. It takes him right back to his days in the army when the orders of execution came in and he was meant to simply follow them without question. It was a matter of security. So was this, family security. Steve knew he’d cover the streets of Brooklyn red with blood if that’s what it took to protect his family and stop Hydra.
Loki would call him a fool and arrogant, but Loki wasn’t here and the truth was, Thor liked it. He liked the numbness killing brought him, the chance to let his inner demons drop into the background of his mind and focus on this. The sound of his hammer shattering skull and pounding flesh. The way the blood marked the walls and the floor, and the way bodies fell in lifeless heaps on the ground around him.
"You don't understand what's at stake here. We might not all make it out. Bruce and Sam at least should sign the papers, you’re lower level, no record, they might not even bother reassigning you."
He didn’t need much persuading, kissing Tony soundly as he used his hands to support his weight and started thrusting into the Mechanic to build up a rhythm. Tony was moaning, hips moving to meet Steve’s with rigor as his heels dug harder into Steve’s ass.
“With T’Challa supporting the story…”
Steve kissed his neck, “You’re doing so well, a little faster, sweetheart.”
“The new arm seems to be working for him, lightweight and flexible so he should retain most of the mobility he had before.” Tony said, “But he still isn’t used to wearing it for extended periods of time, he’ll get there. We just need to keep working at it.”
Fury nodded, “And my silence. Frankly, I don’t care who you are or how you faked your death. You aren’t the biggest threat right now, whoever is butchering my cops is and I have a feeling you want to get them just as much as I do.”
Steve followed his lead, eyes scanning the horizon, “Is this going to get ugly?”
Normally it wasn’t this consuming for him. The sex. He enjoyed it, of course, and he always made sure his partner finished but Steve always kept one eye on the nearest exit as a planned escape route and had a mental note of where he left his clothes if he needed to leave in a hurry. He was more than a little confused to find he hadn’t worried about either of those things since Tony had let him inside and even now, all of his attention went to Tony.
“You’re my friend too, Nat.” Steve said, “Just, don’t bottle it up.”
Rhodey smiled, “You’re going soft.”
Steve strode over, arm coming out to rest on Tony’s waist as he pressed in close to him, “Hammer, I see you’ve met my date.”
Rhodey held up his hands, “Okay, slow down. Just tell me what happened.”
“Then I’ll come back for you. After he’s dead, after you’ve watched. I’ll hunt you down and make sure these streets aren’t yours either. Every corner, every day, you’ll wonder if this is the one where I come for you.” Ross pushed further, “No Captain to save you, no Avengers around you.”
Steve smiled wide, “How’s it going to be?”
“Will do,” Nat replied as Steve brushed past her to head to his office for a drink, “What should I do about the mechanic?”
“Tony, I don’t want you to have to see that.” Steve told him softly, eyes looking away for a brief moment in shame.
“You’re right. I need a favour.” Steve replied grimly.
Tony reached out a hand for him, fingers curling around the meat of Steve’s thigh as he let out of groan, “You’re thinking too much.” Tony commented, voice rough from sleep.
Steve was slower than usual, “Tony, what are you doing here? After everything…”
There must have been a dozen or more there. Had Howard fixed the design flaw by himself? Or was he using a different triggering mechanism for the impact. Tony moved round Natasha, walking into the room.
“Don’t.” Steve replied, “Don’t tell me I’m not worried about what’s going to happen. I’ve tried everything I can to get you guys out of this. I’ve made deals with cops, I tried to push Tony away, hell if I could make a deal that Rumlow only came after me then I would do it. For you. For this family. So, don’t you fucking dare tell me I don’t care about what’s happening here.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair, "Immunity is on the table for you. Not for me. I'm the mob boss, I don't get a pardon for my sins."
Whatever slight shift Tony had created; it had caused a landslide within Steve that he was still struggling to understand himself.
Steve placed a kiss on his shoulder blade, nose brushing against Tony’s skin, “You want to feel me pressing against you as I drive into you? You want me to fuck you like this knowing no one else will make you feel this way?”
It was Bruce who replied, “Tony, are you okay with this? You’d be lying to your best friend. You’d be manipulating him into helping free a mobster.”
Steve was walking along the docks at a casual pace, slow and controlled like he had all the time in the world. He had told Rumlow he was on his way to hand himself over, Rumlow had won and was probably already digging Steve’s shallow grave as he walked. Steve would have made him dig it himself but then Rumlow was probably just eager to have it done so he could sit on the throne.
Fury leaned even closer, “I want you to come work with me. You and your family. Look, I’ve been in this job a long time and I know these streets, I know the legal stuff but you, you have the kind of knowledge about operations and mindset that I’ll never have in a million years. I don’t think a unit like this could work without someone like you on board.”
“If this is a booty call, I feel like I should warn you I’m about twenty minutes away from crashing so I’m not sure it’s going to be…” Steve started as Tony pushed his vest over his head and let it fall to the floor.
He was covered in blood and he was still shaking but he looked more focused now, his eyes taking in the room around him. His gaze fell on Steve again and Steve smiled encouragingly, the fingers of his free hand brushing some hair away from Tony’s forehead.
He felt the relief run through Tony’s body at Steve’s acceptance. His word was enough, and Steve wasn’t about to be the one to question him on yet. Tony would tell him when he was ready but right now, he needed Steve’s help.
Suddenly, there was a loud bang from inside. The kind of sound a firework makes when it launches into the air. Steve hadn't heard something on that scale since Afghanistan and he found himself gripping his gun tighter. That feeling of anticipation pooled in his gut, the same feeling he always got before a heavy fight. The adrenaline would kick in next, the second he shot off his first bullet and then it'd be pure instinct.
Typical Howard, ask for an inch and take a mile. Tony’s stomach churned at the idea of sitting around a table with this man, “One night. One course meal. No extras.”
Steve squeezed his hand again, “He hurt you.”
The other man smiled, opening the door wider to let Tony in, “Of course, come on in.”
He thrusted back into him again.
He slammed the door in his father’s face, and he didn’t feel bad about doing it. He could feel the heat rush to his face and the shaking of his hands caused him to drop the keys to the floor. Tony wasn’t seventeen anymore though, he was a survivor. That was why he waited until he heard Howard’s expensive shoes sounding his retreat before Tony allowed himself a moment to crumple, legs giving out under him as his back slid down the door. He refused to cry; he wouldn’t give Howard that power over him. He never had, even when he was beating him.
It was Tony that reached for him, pulling him to his feet and back to his full height and mashed their lips together again.
Steve gave a small laugh, grabbing a sponge from behind him to rinse down Tony’s chest, “Well, you must be the only garage that runs an animal shelter on the side.”
Ross had gotten what he wanted.
“I’m up and I’m busy working on this proposal so if you need something…”
“Jesus.” Tony sipped at his coffee again, “Your cat, your responsibility. You feed him; you keep him away from the cars. Your Aunt is going to kill me.”
“Bedroom?” Steve demanded, hands moving to unbutton Tony’s jeans. He made sure to brush his fingers over Tony’s cock as he did so, drawing another moan from him.
It was a strange thing, to see your downfall in front of you and not be able to stop it. It was like stepping out in front of a car and being paralysed to move even though it was coming closer. That’s how Steve felt. He could see it all, the downfall of The Captain, the trial of Steve Rogers and the prosecution of The Avengers. Was this how his story goes? The boy who had dreamed of being a soldier, the man who had already died once, was this really how he was going to go out? Hydra on one side and Ross on the other whilst he was backed into a corner?
“He had politicians funding it,” Steve paused, unsure whether telling Fury the whole story was wise or whether he’d see it as a desperate attempt for Steve to cling onto his freedom, “And Ross. He’s Hydra. I don’t know how long for, since he came to Brooklyn probably.”
“Stop.” Steve replied, while he had no love for Howard, and he knew Tony probably didn’t either this was still his father and Steve wasn’t about to let Rumlow kill him to make a point.
“It’s a mini arc reactor. Pure energy, I solved the equations when I was 17. It’s an energy source that might be able to run Brooklyn for a year given the right treatment,” Tony replied, “But sure, for now it’s a weapon.”
To Steve’s relief the phone picked up after the third ring, a gruff voice answering, “What do you want?” into the line, surprisingly alert given the hour Steve was calling at.
Tony let him, stepping out of the rest of his clothes and kicking off his shoes. He stood before Steve, naked and shivering and barely himself.
It was a nice dream, a game of pretend he knew they’d never get. This would be the last moment of goodness they had together but at least they were both filling it with lies. That made Steve feel better.
Tony pulled his hand away, barely meeting Steve’s gaze, but he nodded stiffly and headed upstairs. Steve followed him, heart hammering in his chest. He felt sick at the cold difference Tony was showing him and he knew he deserved it.
“Steve, come on, get up.” Tony insisted.
Clint studied the photo again before Fury slapped down another one on top. This one was of the same man, Bennett, but this time it was a wide shot of his body laid out on the pavement. His shirt was torn open from his body to reveal his chest, a mass of red scars cut deep into the skin.
Steve’s eyes flashed to the small smattering of scars across Tony’s left shoulder blade, a series of roundish dots, about five in total that almost looked like freckles. He filed the information away because now definitely wasn’t the time to ask and it wasn’t his business. Everyone had scars after all, Steve himself was covered in them. A jagged edge of a knife wound on his right thigh. A graze of raised skin near his ribs from an old bullet wound. He pushed those thoughts aside, Tony stopping him when he had reached the foot of the bed.
Steve paused, willing his mouth to work around his dry throat at the fear in Bucky’s voice as he said the last sentence, “Buck…”
“Come on, Captain.” He growled, “Fuck me already.”
He knew he wouldn’t be able to get Tony Stark’s face out of his mind as he ripped his heart out and Steve’s only hope was that one day, he’d understand he had ripped out his own right along with it.
“Yeah?” He answered, stepping away from the group as he waited for an response.
Tony shouldn’t be doing this.
“He’ll kill me.”
The gang members took their aim, guns cocked.
“No, never.” Steve replied firmly, “Never, Tony.”
“Call me and find out.” Tony challenged right back.
“Thor grab my medical grab from the kitchen. We need to get this bullet out.” Bruce told him and Thor was off in an instant, “Clint, you’re going to be fine. It’s not deep but I need to take the bullet out, okay?”
Steve sighed, the emotion thick in his voice now, “They’re bringing in a specialised unit, head hunters. This isn’t about cop killings, not really, not anymore. They want to clean house. This guy, Ross, he’s coming for all of us. Avengers and Hydra. It doesn’t matter anymore.”
Steve broke their kiss with a smile. Tony Stark might just be the death of him after all, and what a way to go. His lips travelled down to Tony’s neck; hands secure on Tony’s back to hold him steady as Steve explored the sensitive skin under his jawbone. Tony shuddered in his arms at the feeling of Steve’s beard brushing against his skin, throwing his head back to give Steve better access. Steve welcomed it, trailing his mouth up to Tony’s ear. He flicked his tongue out against it, teeth grazing the lobe until Tony moaned and pressed harder against Steve.
Steve closed his eyes at the pain in Tony’s voice, “Tony, no. It killed me, standing on the dock and saying that to you. Telling you I didn’t want this. It killed me. The way you looked at me, I never want to see you look like that again. Especially not because of me.”
“Morning, Mr Stark.” Peter greeted him with a grin.
Steve stood up straighter, determined to give Tony the same back. He walked further into the room, scanning the faces of his family and drawing strength from them. These people were his safe harbour, everyone in this room meant something to him. He’d kill for them; he’d die for them. Surrounded by them, Steve felt invincible.
None of it would matter all that much when Steve killed him.
“We should get cleaned up,” Steve muttered, fingers tracing the bite marks he left in Tony’s shoulder through his shirt.
“Consider the message received.” The reply came suddenly, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Captain.”
Steve’s eyes drifted out to sea again, “I know who I am, and I know what I’ve become to survive. I live with that; I live with everything I’ve ever done to still be standing in front of you right now. The army, the gang, all of it. I’ll live with it, but they shouldn’t have to.”
Tony seemed pleased enough with that statement to reach up for Steve’s collar, dragging his face down to meet Tony’s in a searing kiss. Steve was already hard, his hands gripping at Tony’s waist as his tongue invaded his mouth. He licked at Tony’s lips, flicking his tongue along the edge of Tony’s own until he heard a moan from the smaller man.
“I’ll just sleep on you.” Tony replied, not bothering to protest as he wiggled back against Steve.
It couldn’t have been more than two minutes later when the door to the small room opened and two cops walked in. Clint smiled; they had been listening. They were clearly high-level cops, in suits instead of uniforms. The first one looked at tired as Clint felt, his grey suit rumpled from what was probably a long day and a coffee cup clutched into his hand like a lifeline, under his arm was a file.
He barely managed a smile in Rhodey’s direction before he was moving past him and pushing open the door. They didn’t have much time and Rhodey would count down those two minutes right outside the door if Tony knew him well enough. He needed to do this. The whole team was depending on him to get this right.
“I don’t even get a last name?”
“Okay, well we know he’s alive. Rumlow would have left his body for you to find if he wasn’t. The real question is how did they know to take him?” Natasha questioned. Her mind always managed to keep up with Steve’s, even on his best day.
“We’re all forgetting one very big variable in this plan.” Bucky cut in, “Steve. If we’re right and he set himself up for the fall, then he isn’t exactly going to be happy we’re busting him out.”
That got Bucky’s attention, “Brock Rumlow? From Delta Force?”
Steve wasted no time in sealing his lips over Tony’s. The kiss was soft and slow and sweet. Steve placed a hand on Tony’s cheek, feeling him lean into his palm. They were going to be okay. Whatever Rumlow and Ross threw at them, they’d fight it together.
He turned around another corner, the shipment yards in view up ahead. Steve slowed his pace again, eyes on the sky. It wasn’t raining yet, he wondered when the next time he saw rain would be?
Fury nodded, “It was smart coming down here. I figured you would.”
Steve sighed, breaking eye contact for a moment, “Well, apparently I wasn’t wrong.”
Natasha looked from Bucky to Tony and back again with a small shrug, “Just be careful.” She said softly although Tony got the impression she aimed the comment more at Bucky than at him.
Steve stood up, holding out a hand for Tony to take, “You should go.”
“No?” Rumlow mused, “How about little Peter? Accidents can happen when you walk home through Brooklyn at night. He’s a smart kid though, It’d be a shame to see his brains coating the pavement.”
“I might be able to design something.” Tony’s voice cut through the hazy of the situation, “I presented at a conference on prosthetics once when I was drunk and only seventeen. I think I can make something sleeker than the run-of-the-mill models.”
Natasha was his family, before he got Steve and the rest of the Avengers, it had always just been him and Tasha. He remembered those days fondly despite the struggle they both had endured before Steve had found them and offered them a home. Natasha was a small strip of a girl at the age of fifteen. Brilliant red hair that grew in matted curls down her back and a smile that invited you in before becoming deadly. They had become instant friends, which was a first for both of them considering how they were raised but they had both been on their own for a while and had both been at a crossroads on where to go next. Clint was a few years older than Tasha, a point she never failed to let him forget, and if he took one look at her bare dirty feet, almost black from the grit of the pavements and decided he was going to give this girl one person at least that she could rely on then Clint figured he couldn’t be held to blame for that. As it turned out, when they had met Steve several years later, they had both gained more than each other to trust and for that alone Clint would always be grateful for the tortured soul that was Steve Rogers.
He could hear T’challa’s smile through the phone, “That’s probably not the best idea. That’s the world we have resigned ourselves to, Steve. You can walk in my world and people call it business but if I walk in yours?”
Steve’s room was nothing like he had expected. All dark wood and dark cream walls. It was homely. It was private. It was peaceful. It was Steve. There were stacks of books against one wall, having overgrown the small bookcase that was there Steve had resorted to stacking them up like a wall next to it. Tony saw plenty of army books there, some history ones and others on strategy. There were books about vintage cars and surprisingly quite a few murder mystery ones mixed in with the nonfiction. Tony smiled at that, the mob boss reading about fictional murders and trying to work out the culprit before it was revealed. It was so Steve, trying to find the clues in the pages and figure it out before the characters did.
Tony smiled then, “Dance with me?” He asked, voice soft and unsure.
Sitwell shrugged, “You’re an army grunt. He’s an army grunt. You just lost your edge, Captain.”
"How did you..." Tony started.
Instead, he was glancing down on his phone every few moments, staring at the screen like a drowning man. He’d taken it out of his pocket before they started the movie, he hated it digging into his side when he sat down and it was in his jeans so he’d placed it on the arm of the couch within reach and now it served a purpose to mock him everything he looked at it.
“Come on, baby.” He crooned, fingers moving back to squeeze Steve’s ass, “Fill me up.”
Rumlow chuckled, “You think you’re here as bait for The Captain?”
Tony rolled his hips at the statement, leaning down to kiss Steve then. It was deep and dirty, Steve’s tongue invading his mouth and thrusting in and out in a way Tony knew he’d do with his dick inside him. He lost himself in the kiss, letting his hips buck against Steve’s as he ground his erection against him wantonly.
Steve frowned, “I can’t take a break right now. Not with Hydra getting stronger by the day.”
Steve knew he would need to look into this one, if someone was trying to pin cop killings on them then he couldn’t just let that go. The cops would be all over this and Steve didn’t need the hassle. It had to be Hydra. No one else in Brooklyn would be bold enough to go after a cop. That brought him back to the new leader and whatever plan he had to destroy the family, “I need you to take a few days. Lay low, don’t come to the house until this blows over. I called a favour from T’challa to get you out so you need to be clean if the cops are still watching you.”
“Once you’re dead I’ll go after them. Take Bucky’s other arm maybe? I’ll use a knife on Natasha, it’s only fair. She’s so fond of them. And Tony, what about Tony?” Rumlow taunted.
“Pick a place, anywhere you want. That’s where we’ll start. Don’t tell me when you’ve decided though. You navigate, I’ll drive. I want to be surprised.”
There was an invisible wall between them. A flood of everything thing left unsaid and that hung unspoken like an open wound between them. There was hurt and anger and confusion but there was something softer underneath as well. Tony swallowed thickly.
“You don’t even like me.” Tony reminded him, taking a left at the junction. Stark Industries loomed in the distance like a beacon for dread, calling Tony home.
Fury frowned, “Even if we could get evidence on Rumlow to make an arrest, Ross wouldn’t spare The Avengers.”
Steve groaned, body straining underneath Tony as he swirled his tongue over it. Steve really seemed to like his tongue. Tony could work with that. His mouth moved over to Steve’s nipple, closing his lips round the bud as he flicked his tongue over it once, twice, a third time. The erection pressing into him was evidence enough that Steve was enjoying this.
Sitwell needed to go for Natasha first because she was fast and her precision to throw a knife was second to none. Thor was a danger up close but Natasha was a danger even in a room full of people with one hand behind her back. Sitwell wouldn’t go for Natasha though because he would underestimate her. Steve had watched so many men make that mistake and realise it was a fatal one.
Tony was all in.
Steve’s hands were on his hips now, a glint to his eye that was nothing short of teasing, “I might be in jail soon.” He sighed.
“I don’t want to use one.” Tony said, thrusting his hips again.
“No? So, voting against Tony being part of this team? That wasn’t you throwing your toys out the pram because god forbid someone actually has the chance to be happy in this family.”
“Can’t a father check in on his son?” Howard asked, his voice void of emotion and Tony wasn’t fooled for a second.
Tony whined, “Yes.”
“We have a full house; anyone could walk in.” Steve tried to remind him as he grew hard, blood pooling south.
Steve released a breath he didn’t know he was holding, “And we’re back to your long day.” He teased with a smile.
“You’re here to arrest me?” Steve asked dangerously, fingers twitching for the gun at his back but he held firm. Nothing in Fury’s body language pointed to aggression or cockiness.
The Captain had work to do.
Steve smiled, “I don’t care about them.”
Tony hummed, “So, you’re here for Steve?”
Tony squared his shoulders, bouncing on the balls of his feet. He had one shot at this and no real plan after he was out. He flexed his hands out, rising up his palm so the arc reactor was pointed at the metal lock, focusing on the complex locking system that kept Tony trapped.
“Did you kill them?”
Everyone was waiting for them when they entered the living room, a sea of faces with mixed emotions. Steve fought the urge to grab Tony’s hand for comfort although he did glance back to the mechanic in a moment of reassurance. It was a silent exchange, offering Tony one final chance to decide he wasn’t ready to sign up for this. For Steve’s life.
Steve’s eyes were on Bucky’s slumped figure, “And by the end of the night he’ll be dead.”
Bucky tried to nod but his head rolled back instead. Clint came running in, handing Bruce the hot poker, glowing an angry orange from the heat. Bucky looked at it with wide eyes. Then he looked back at Steve, “You kill him for this, okay? You cut off his head and let his body rot in the ocean. Promise me, Steve.”
Tony nodded, “He built this family from the ground up, right?”
Tony took a step back, “No way, I can’t.”
“And here Steve told me you were a genius.” Bucky sighed, “You’re kind of dumb for a genius, you know?”
“He’ll make my arrest public.” Steve agreed, “He’ll paint me out to be a monster to the streets of Brooklyn. He’ll be the saviour to my reign of terror.”
“Oh, this plan of yours to sacrifice your own freedom for the rest of us?” Tony sneered, “This plan where you destroyed your own family to save them?”
Tony leaned up on his elbow to loom over Steve, “No, we do this together. Whatever happens.”
“Just you.” She flashed her eyes up to look at him now, “In all those years. Just you. That means something to him. You mean something to him. He doesn’t do this normally; he’s had nights of course but never anything he contemplated enough to make a go of things with.”
Tony cut him off, “You’ve been a complete idiot and the team needs you.”
“When I was a kid. I was always drawing something. I stopped when I went into the army. There wasn’t much down time for stuff like that but when I came back Sam brought me the sketchpad and told me to start again. He thought it might help me find some peace, I think.” Steve replied.
“If you want it to be?” Tony smirked, standing up and moving around his seat to start heading outside.
Steve huffed a laugh, “Long day.”
They worked the room together; Steve charmed his way through the politics talk with a practised ease. He had pretty good knowledge on that front, being both a soldier and a mob boss helped him navigate both sides of the argument and keep him informed of developments that might sway a politician either way. Tony was a natural too, all those years at business functions for Stark industries meant he could charm with the best of them and Steve found himself simply watching Tony work. He’d even managed to get Hill, Steve’s biggest worry of the evening. Tony had her eating out of the palm of his hand and when Steve proposed backing T’Challa it was Tony that managed that last little push to secure her vote. It was exhilarating watching him like this, marvelling at how seamlessly they worked together.
