he wanted to believe it, but no matter what Charlie said about sex, he knew it wasn't that easy. Sexual orientation was a fundamental thing – how could he ask Dean to go against his? Was it even possible? “But, Dean . . . I'm a
What he realised, basically, is that I am still
was the elder by three or four years. “Lemme look. I've seen plenty of broken heads before—I know what to do.”
He had more than an hour of blessed peace in which to stew and worry before he heard the Impala pull into the drive. His stomach went into advanced butterfly mode, but he didn't get up from the sofa, his eyes glued stubbornly to his tablet. He had his back to the front hall; Dean would come into the living room and see the haircut before Castiel could see him. He knew he was being a coward, but he just couldn't bear to look into Dean's eyes at the moment of revelation.
Yet I have a woman's body. I've presented myself as a woman for over forty years. You thought I was a woman when you married me. And now I tell you I'm not the gender I look like, the gender you thought I was, and all you can say is 'okay'?”
Yes. It was going to be hard on everyone, and Castiel felt a small pang of guilt for all the changes and accommodations he was asking of his friends. Who was he to demand all this special attention? But then . . . was this really any different from when Ellen's daughter Jo had asked people to stop calling her “Joanna”? Sure, there were mistakes at first, but everyone tried, and after a surprisingly short time the only person who still called her by her old name was her mother, and then only when she was angry. So pronouns might take a little longer – they'd all adjust.
Dean didn’t know how long he’d been staring at his hands in the water.
Charlie's expression froze, then slowly sobered. “Oh, right. Um, if I'm the first person you've told, then . . . what about Dean?”
Dean nodded emphatically. “Oh yeah. You could
He gasps. He feels as if he has fallen from a great height, as if he has been transported a thousand miles in the space of a single second. Everything rushes around him like a gale, all his memories and knowledge, his past, his present, his future.
Dean huffed out a self-deprecatory snort. “I'm just this guy,” he said.

“So why don't we go shopping for some

Castiel was smiling back.
“So,” he says. “Are we dead?”
“But you know what? It doesn’t matter,” he says, never taking his eyes off Castiel’s face, and Castiel smiles at him, luminous with joy. “’Cause we got what we wanted. What we needed. And
He blinked, then smiled gamely. “No, it's fine, Dean. I—I guess I was just realizing how much work I have ahead of me, unpacking and all.”
There were a lot of boxes, and the space was tight, but they fell quickly into an efficient rhythm. Dean obviously knew what he was doing and seemed to make room for Castiel whenever necessary, flowing back into the empty spaces once Castiel had moved on. Their shoulders brushed once, twice, but otherwise it was like a dance, easy and smooth.

When they went to bed, Castiel wound himself around Dean as he hadn't for . . . months, probably. His disgust with his body had made him shy, made him shrink away from any reminder that he was inherently
Dean’s eyes went almost comically wide. “What?”
Without speaking, they turn and kiss, then they straighten their shoulders and step through.
Castiel looked down. “Uh, well, nothing exciting. Just some clothes. I got some Converse – you know I needed some new sneakers. And a couple hoodies.” He smoothed out the front of his shirt. “And this t-shirt.”
Sam’s fingers were cramping around Dean’s forearms, but he managed a slightly tighter squeeze. A question, a plea. “
He doesn’t think; there is nothing to think about. There is nothing but light and the sound/vibration/music and himself, and he barely registers himself. If he stopped and considered, he might remember his name, his life. Pain, joy, love, hate. But he doesn’t stop, overtaken by the momentum of his body, the ease of movement, the only thing that seems real.
“Then I guess we'll figure it out together, huh?”
Castiel slowly brought his hand away from his head. It felt sticky. Oh, god—he was covered in blood…
“Okay!” Charlie said as she dragged Castiel into a large local department store. “This is the best place to start – they have lots of stuff and it's pretty nice but not too expensive.” She turned and faced Castiel, hands on her hips. “So, the first thing you have to figure out is – what's your look?”
Dean studied the space again. “Yeah, if you want to break a few laws of geometry,” he muttered. “Or physics.”
Dean spread his hands. “I dunno. At first, it was so I wouldn't scare you, you know? When I met you it was – it was just
He felt like the ground had fallen out beneath his feet, but he didn't fall, his stomach light and giddy as he floated mid-air. “But Dean . . . all your exes. All your stories . . .” He blinked back sudden tears – of anger? joy? relief? – and suppressed a hysterical giggle. “Why didn't you
“Please, call me Castiel,” Castiel said, risking a glance at that handsome face. His stomach took another little swoop.
Castiel felt light-headed and a little surreal. “You're not, I don't know, freaked out?”
Dean grimaced sympathetically. “I feel ya, man. I spent most of my childhood hopping from one place to another. Moving sucks.” His face brightened suddenly. “Hey, why don't I hang out with you for a while, maybe help you unpack a little? Then later we could grab some dinner at a place I know down the street—cheap beer, good pizza, darts, pool. You know, get you acquainted with your new neighborhood. Whattaya say, huh?”
Dean breathed in slowly.
He stared down at the wine glass in his hands, inexplicably empty now. He reached towards the open bottle, stopped, drew his hand back. “Dean?”
Castiel halts, and Dean halts with him, almost perfectly in unison. Castiel tilts his head as if listening.

streaming out of
The pale shape in the mirror trembled. Castiel's fists clenched, relaxed. It was not like anything could be done.
He was unspeakably grateful that Dean didn't seem to notice any change in him. Of course, Castiel had always had his “moods,” and Dean was as familiar with them as he was with the inside of Baby's engine, but apparently he wasn't presenting any unusual symptoms, for Dean was the same Dean as always: kind, supportive, goofy, and perfect.
“Oh, yeah, that's a nice one,” Dean chuckled.

. Suddenly everything is rushing and moving, and he feels things, things he had forgotten in this void of light, things that stand in sharp relief against the nothingness, sharp and aching. He takes a deeper breath, something coming unmoored inside him, and he says the words he should have said years and worlds ago.
“Let me know —”
“I know how to lift boxes, Dean,” Castiel said, not quite managing to suppress an eye-roll.
He buried his face in his hands, scrubbed at his day-old beard, his aching eyes. Mom gone (
“Cas…”
Castiel merely nods, and then they are moving together, not in step, but side by side, fingers entwined, eyes forward, chins high. The lurid red gash gapes as they approach, widening and pulsing. A wind blows up from behind them, pushing them on. It whistles past their ears, obscuring, though not completely drowning out, Amara’s slow and final benediction.
An emotion rises, prodding at Dean’s numb heart. He suddenly hates the defeat in Castiel’s voice, hates that there is sadness in his eyes. He reaches out, touches Castiel briefly.
motions with her hands.
It was hard work, though—harder than Castiel had been expecting; for all his smiles and easy banter, Dean was evasive about his own life, deflecting (usually successfully) the conversation back to Castiel when things threatened to get too personal. It was only when Castiel started to ask about the younger brother that Dean dropped his defenses and became voluble, praising and teasing in equal measure, and his obvious love for and pride in Sam just made him
Dean shoved the last of the pizza crust in his mouth and talked around it. “It’s been said.”
Castiel blinked once, slowly. “No,” he said. “No, of course not. Don't be silly. I was just . . . thinking.”

By the time Saturday came around at last, Castiel was a jittery mix of hot and cold; he'd

Tonight? The same tired track that had been on endless replay for the last month and more: the Situation. This bizarre, impossible, cosmically hilarious Situation, a divine joke at Castiel's expense, or perhaps a punishment for the sins of another life – who knew? It made no sense, but there it was: after nearly forty-two years of life on earth, and despite all appearances, biology, and socialization to the contrary,  Castiel had discovered that he was not a woman but a man.
A shadow passed over Dean's face. “Yeah, well, I shoulda' been more careful. You already told me you sometimes kinda, um, lose track of your surroundings. I shoulda' remembered.”
a question. “A woman's hair is her glory,” was quoted at him often enough that it had ceased to have any meaning outside of “no, you can't get a new hairstyle – just get the ends trimmed.” When he went to college he'd rebelled a tiny bit and and got a layered cut that ended at his shoulder-blades, the shortest it had been since he was a toddler. Even when Castiel had gone through his “butch” phases he'd never dared to go too short, and his current bob – hitting just at the nape of his neck – was as short as he'd ever managed to cut it. Until today.
Charlie's expression shifted, became puzzled, soft, and intent. “What were you afraid of, Cas? I mean, I know you don't like crowds and stuff, but I never thought of you as a
Dean grinned wider. “I can do that,” he purred, and pressed Castiel back, deeper into the bedroom, back against the bed, down, down onto the mattress, warm and strong and hard, and it didn’t take very long for Castiel to verify the proof of his hypothesis, though he was happy to collect as many samples as he could.

. Right in a way he was beginning to realize he'd never felt in all his life, at least not since early childhood. Yes, it would be “easier” to go back to being a woman – and it would be nice not to feel as if his body were some kind of grotesque mistake – but part of him insisted that he had, in fact, discovered a truth that there was no turning back from, even if it were possible.

“That's good, at least,” Castiel sighed. The thought of dressing up

to watch Dean be protective and careful of Benny, as if on instinct, while Benny was obviously just as protective of Dean, but from a place of greater self-awareness. More than once Castiel caught Benny watching him talk to Dean as if he was trying to determine Castiel's motives, his eyes narrowed and his expression almost preternaturally uncommunicative.
do?” Dean asked after a moment, sounding a little chastised.
The guilt and anxiety that Charlie's effervescent presence had held at bay rushed through him again like a high-speed train, plowing through his happiness and leaving behind a cold, leaden feeling in his stomach. His shoulders slumped as he stared down at his half-finished lunch. “I haven't told him, Charlie,” he said slowly. “I don't know
Castiel, who had been smiling absently out the window, started, feeling a little twinge of unease in his stomach. “Have I been in a bad mood lately?” he asked, trying to sound merely curious rather than anxious.

Damn. He'd have to talk now. “Uh, in here, Dean,” he called back. He kept his head bent over his sudoku game.
Castiel rocks gently in Dean’s lap, riding up and down in a slow, lazy rhythm, his hands spread across Dean’s shoulder blades like wings. Dean closes his eyes and sings “Hey Jude” into Castiel’s open mouth.

Castiel laughed. “And yet you knew it was a misquote, so who’s the bigger heathen?”

Castiel smiles, that little, private smile he gets sometimes when he thinks he knows something Dean doesn’t. “Of course not. Although I appreciate its role in ‘getting us off our asses,’ this place is terrible beyond words.”
Castiel was kneading Dean's hands, blue eyes fixed on the way his long fingers ran over Dean's palms. “You know, when we were first married, I was so excited – sex was pretty new to me, and it seemed amazing and wonderful that we could use our bodies to make each other feel so good. I loved how you laughed and made jokes and said you loved me and how you just let go of everything when you came, as if nothing existed at that moment but you and me and the ecstasy of our bodies. I loved making you happy that way.”
Castiel sighed, just a little, and leaned into Dean's embrace. “That's me,” he said.

And yes, he’d given up on the whole picking up thing. Dean’s switch from sexy bastard to hovering mama bear had changed their whole dynamic, and Castiel was surprised to find that he was okay with that. He’d looked into the yawning chasm of loneliness, of unpacking his new apartment in solitary silence, and then Dean had swooped in and gotten Castiel’s kitchen in order in just over an hour, then had dragged him down for beer and pizza and darts. He’d regaled Castiel with hilarious stories of his strange and peripatetic childhood and listened as Castiel told stories of his own, Dean just as engrossed whether Castiel was talking about his crazy brothers or describing obscure translations unfolding like puzzle boxes, revealing their secrets little by little. It was nice. It was good.
“I won't,” Castiel whispered, breathless with gratitude. “I can't.”
“You gotta hold on, Dean,” he said. “I know…I know how much it hurts, believe me. How it makes you want to die, but you can’t, man, you can’t.” The stone in his chest lurched heavily. “You’re all I’ve got left, Dean. I know it’s not the same, but I can’t do this without you. You gotta stay with me.”
Dean had laughed, feeling it all the way down in his gut. “Whatever, dude,” he said, grinning over the lip of his beer bottle. He squinted at the sky. “Not sure what a trireme is, but I think I see a Viking ship, maybe?”
Castiel shot him an amused look, complete with eyebrow. “When has either one of us ever been to 'Grandma's house'?”
“It’s mostly books,” Castiel said, trying not to sound defensive, “but the living room was getting crowded.”
Charlie looked up at the ceiling. “I suppose so. Gay men, maybe,” she drawled, obviously teasing. “And Patrick Stewart.”
. “Look at you, mixing your metaphors,” he said dismissively. “And you some big academic type.”

Castiel started his Saturday feeling strange and a little surreal. He'd shot a reassuring text off to Charlie as soon as he'd gotten up (he knew he didn't have the energy to handle her enthusiasm in person just then), but afterwards he felt a bit at loose ends and spent the morning after breakfast wandering the house, not sure of what to do or say, as if coming out to Dean had collapsed his future into that one last act, leaving nothing left. Dean, on the other hand, was his usual ebullient self – maybe even more so than usual. Trying a little too hard, maybe, but that was Dean, and Castiel found he was too wired to resent it. So when Dean started making faces and execrable puns to rouse him out of his funk, Castiel finally laughed and threw his hands in the air, surrendering might-have-beens and

“Hey, no prob,” Dean said as he opened the bottle of ibuprofen and shook out two tablets. “Kinda my fault, anyway, scarin' you like that.” He smiled ruefully. “Seems to be my thing today, sorry.”
Sam heard the water running in the upstairs bath at rather a remove, at first. His head was too stuffed with loss and regret to track everything in real time; he felt as if the world was operating several seconds in the future and he was running to catch up, knowing he never would.

He decided he would tell Dean Saturday evening, after dinner. They had no outside plans, so he thought he'd let Dean make ribs (Dean was, frankly, the better cook) and coleslaw, then they'd settle in front of a Babylon 5 marathon with beer and popcorn. Maybe he'd tell Dean before the marathon, or maybe after the first episode; he wasn't sure yet. But sometime that evening, when Dean was full and happy and there was nothing important to think about. That would be best, Castiel thought. It should be easy. And then, if it went well with Dean, they could both tell Sam, Amelia, Bobby, and Ellen at brunch on Sunday. Or not. It didn't matter. Castiel was going to tell Dean on Saturday, and if the world didn't end, everything else could take care of itself.
“That kissing you would be awesome,” Dean said. He pulled back a bit more, sliding his hands down Castiel’s biceps; he was grinning like a Cheshire cat, the smug bastard.
to smile when he talked to Charlie. “Do you have any plans for Saturday?” he asked, trying to sound casual rather than half out of his mind with nerves.
The mover looked mildly impressed. “Cool,” Dean said. “Like, I dunno, Spanish and French and stuff?”
“Me?” Charlie replied, looking affronted. “
he was at this point, but he did know this: that he wanted to be the one who made Dean grin like a kid with all the Halloween candy, the one who danced in the middle of the living room with a wine glass in his hand, the one who was strong and happy and didn't give a shit what other people thought.
Castiel shook his head. “You're awful.” He ran his hand through his hair. “I think I gravitate towards kind of an understated style. Tidy, you know, but not flashy. But not old or frumpy, either.”
“I’m not sure,” Castiel says slowly. His brow is furrowed. “It might be music, played very slowly. Or it might be speech, also very slow.” His eyes shut, and he is still and silent.
Castiel's brain went blank. He had been expecting – well, dreading, really – any number of responses, but this was

“I will.”
It was a good night. Bobby and Ellen arrived shortly after the group was settled, swelling the party's ranks. Castiel loved his brother- and sister-in-law, as well as the grumpy Bobby and unsinkable Ellen, and it always made his heart warm to see Dean and Sam interact when they were both in good moods. There was excellent food, a lot of laughter, and even some intelligent conversation. Dean didn't drink too much and Castiel did, a little bit, but it didn't matter because he was feeling good. Surrounded by the people he loved, he felt expansive and relaxed, overcoming his usual shyness to partake in all the jokes and witticisms, at ease enough that he didn't even feel embarrassed when Sam and Dean's more esoteric pop-culture references sailed right over his head. He glowed at the look of pleased surprise on Sam's face when he opened the gift bag and took out the complete set of

Unfortunately, thinking about his adopted family caused memories of his blood family to rise up, unbidden and unwanted, demanding comparison. Castiel frowned and tried to shake the thoughts out of his head, but they were old familiar enemies, and he found he was too tired to resist them. Bobby's curmudgeonly soft-heartedness was crushed by Castiel's father's cold, precise authoritarianism, Sam's bright friendliness overshadowed by Lucien's gleeful malice and Michael's harsh disapproval. By the time he'd climbed into bed, Castiel's good mood had slipped, dimming into something sad and wistful.
Dean’s skin is prickling; he feels as though electricity is sluicing over his entire body. “I…I remember now,” he says numbly. “It’s the last thing Amara said to me, before she disappeared with Chuck.”
“Figured what?” Castiel asked breathlessly.
Dean made a small throat-clearing noise, and Castiel blinked. “Oh, these are just my reference books. For work. I'm a translator. I translate texts for people. From other languages. Freelance.” God, now he was babbling.
Castiel had remembered to leave the door not only unlocked, but open, and between the two of them they managed to wrangle the mid-century modern piece through the entryway with only one injury—Castiel’s fingers got scraped trying to get the thing past the jamb—and into the hallway and around the corner to the bedroom.
Dean opens his hands. “Then, what?”
Castiel blotted his nose with a new, unmutilated napkin. “I know, I know,” he groaned. “I've been trying to figure out how to do it. How to approach him, how to lead into it, but I can't decide.”

They fall silent for a while. Everything is the same. The light never wavers. The sound beneath, above, around them throbs and undulates, but never resolves into anything they can pin their thoughts on. There are no things, here—no objects or actions or reason or meaning. The space around them is as undifferentiated as solar plasma, as uncommunicative as the space between stars.

They eventually pause, and Dean sees Castiel’s smile of wonder change to a troubled frown. “But what is that?” His head gestures behind Dean, at the wound in the air.
asleep. He even woke up some mornings with a smile on his face, amazed and grateful at the reprieve.
“Cas?” came a rough, sleepy voice. “Cassie?” Clearer, worried.
They wrestled the dresser back into the hallway, then Castiel squeezed his way around it into the bedroom to find Dean surveying the space as if it had personally insulted his mother and he was contemplating a fit revenge.
hate looking in the mirror? “Let's buy a pair of jeans. You know, for now. Keep my options open.”
Benny sighed. “Oh, don't bother; I got some blue ice in my lunch cooler. 'Bout time for a break anyhow.” Grumbling, he stumped back down the stairs. “Grab my lunch, too, Benny!” Dean called after him. Castiel heard a faint “Yeah, yeah,” then silence.

Castiel sits up as well and points behind Dean and to the left. Dean twists his body to follow the gesture. “It was there,” Castiel says. “But it’s gone now.” His voice is heavy with disappointment.
Dean turns slowly, and there it is, a gash in the air, a dark wound in the bright world, not black but dark, dark red, like venous blood. The lips of the gash are quivering.
Charlie's eyes lit up, and she reached across the table to take Castiel's hands. “Wow! That's awesome, Cas!” she exclaimed. “Congratulations!”
The door was locked, but that barely slowed him down. One kick and the frame splintered, door blowing inward. Sam was dimly aware of a surprised shout from behind him. “Stay back, Jack,” he barked. “I’ll take care of this.”
“Get outta town!” Charlie squealed. “You brave thing, you! Where'd you get it?”
Hair.
Goddammit to hell. How was he going to tell Dean?
Castiel stepped out of the shower and walked to the big mirror in the bedroom, dropping the towel along the way. It had been a long time; Castiel didn't much like looking in the mirror these days, especially not the full-length one. Especially not naked.

“I think Mr. Novak's gone over the list, right?”
Dean stared at him for a moment, then laughed again, a deeper, fuller laugh, and Castiel’s stomach gave up on swooping and decided to drop right down to his knees. “You crack me up, dude,” Dean said, clapping Castiel on the shoulder. He glanced at his watch and sighed. “Oh, well, better move my ass,” he said cheerfully. “I get paid by the job, not the hour.” He winked before turning away, leaving Castiel feeling befuddled and not a little aroused.

“I have noticed a vibration, yes.”

Dean worked his way around the sofa to look at Castiel full on. He tilted his head as if this would give him a better view, then straightened up again, all the while sporting a goofy, affectionate smile. “Yeah, I do. I mean, I was kinda surprised at first, but you know, now that I see it, I think it looks perfect on you. It's really, I dunno,

“Enough. I have an apartment; I eat; I have cable.”
Castiel laughed and sat down. “How are you doing, Charlie?” he said.
“Then there was a flash, and a split second of disorientation, and I was here,” Castiel continues. “I was lost. I think for a long time that I just stood still, my mind a blank. Then I began seeing a shape, in the distance. If I turned to look at it, it disappeared, but it always came back.” He turns his head then, and there is a small smile on his face. “Then I saw you. You were a shape, a shadow, then you were

Dean shuddered in his grip but didn’t try to fight free. “I jus’ wanted t’see the shapes the clouds made,” he said. “Me ’n Cas — there was this one time, see, an’ we — an’ we —” He broke off with a choked sound, and his body began to shake with grief and shock.
Dean let his eyes drift out of focus. The shapes in the ceiling swam in his vision, combining, breaking apart, combining again. Cracks became edges and outlines, the mold softer forms.
“Ooookay,” Charlie said encouragingly, making little
He'd known about transgender people, of course. He didn't know any personally, other than that friend of Charlie's, whom he'd only met once, but he'd always been interested in gender politics and identity, so he was better informed than many Americans on the subject. He just didn't think it had anything so do with him. True, he'd never been stereotypically feminine and went through “butch” phases, as Dean teasingly called them, when he cut his hair shorter and wore androgynous clothing, but it didn't mean anything. And yes, as a child he'd envied the freedom boys had that he didn't, especially in the context of his repressively religious upbringing, but he didn't want to be one. He was fine with being a girl, really. Men were kind of loud and clueless and wouldn't ask for directions, and as a group they'd kind of run the world into the ground (#notallmen notwithstanding). Why the hell would he want to join those ranks?
They fall into each other, and they fall out of time and space, and they fall down to the hard, white ground, breathless and aching and so full of joy that it feels like grief. It feels like the opposite of dying.
Castiel smiled and allowed himself to relax a little. Getting Dean to admit even this much was something of a victory. “I think that's an excellent idea,” he said firmly. He stirred, suddenly inspired, and propped himself up on one elbow to look Dean in the eye. “How about we make that our homework for the week? Look into therapists or support groups or, I don't know, subreddits, even, to help us sort out how we feel about what's happening.” Dean sucked in a breath, and Castiel went on quickly, not giving him time to protest. “Not saying we have to have appointments lined up by Friday or that we have to go stand in front of a group of strangers and talk about our feelings, but just – let's see what's out there, okay? If we need the help, either together or separately.” He bit his lip. “Is that all right?”
Dean feels himself begin to tremble. “Is it, Cas?”
“Spoilsport,” Dean said with an exaggerated pout.
Love and exasperation crashed through him, scouring him clean of fear and leaving him feeling expansive and somehow
haven't told Dean, everything
Castiel found outlet for his nervous energy in quickly shelving the rest of the books. It helped that doing so meant he wasn’t further distracted by Dean’s cupid’s bow lips or his square jaw. “Some, but I actually specialize in archaic languages, such as Latin and Classical Greek.”
more real. Then he'd panic, and all the objections that had tormented him through the week would rear up and start gibbering at him again. He banged and clattered around the house in his nervousness, dropping things and forgetting things and laughing at himself, sometimes just to laugh and sometimes to keep from screaming.
Sam looks at them both and wonders why - of all things, he has to be the one in the middle of all
As the movie played, Cas nestled into Dean, slowly sliding further down in the comfort of his arms, until he lay along the length of the couch with his head in Dean’s lap. An arm was crooked and pillowed under his head, the other rested over Dean’s knee, as if reassuring Cas that Dean wasn’t going anywhere. They reached the scene where Kevin Costner’s character, Frank, runs across the stage to save Whitney Houston’s character, Rachel, from being shot, Cas grabs Dean’s knee in horror and tenses, unable to look away. He sighs in relief when the characters hit the stage in safety. Panic receding, he relaxes his hold and shifts to his back to look up at Dean, tears beginning to well up. Dean doesn’t hesitate to look down at Cas, nodding at him with a thick swallow.
fills his mind. Dean’s eyes darken as his mind continues to fill him with ideas of ripping Cas’ clothes off and just getting downright dirty with him, but Cas brings him back to by kissing him hotly. It ’s then he realises; Cas’ hard on and his own are millimetres apart, and he hesitates. Dean rakes his eyes over Cas and takes in how debauched he now looks, sweat protruding along his hairline and his eyes
“Dean, I’m ready.” Cas tells Dean, not breaking eye contact. Dean swallows hard and nods.
“Dean, is something amusing?” Cas questions, picking up a book and frowning.
? Whoa, wait a second.
“Heyya, Cas” Dean breathes in a moment of reverie caused by his almost nap, and the closeness of the angel who is now lowering himself to the blanket beside Dean.
“Are we boyfriends?” he asks, shifting his neck to get a better view of Dean’s face. Dean thinks for a moment, then his face softens.
Cas gets his answer just a few hours later, when they determine that they are likely dealing with a meadow Nymph. After days of watching Cas get increasingly frustrated with him, Dean is barely able to contain himself as Cas wanders over to get the required books.
Dean bites his lip, sucking in a breath. He never thought that he would ever be good enough for anyone - especially not an angel - yet here he is,
"How are you so calm? You're an adult, human male. I'm well aware that you consider sexual interaction an important component of your relationships." Cas buries his face in his hands, not wanting to see the affirmation of his words on Dean's face.
“Dean, is this - is
Morning dawned on the bunker, the sun having just risen in the sky. Yellows and oranges merge together, creating a beautiful ombré. Dean yawns as he slips on his dead-man robe, before making his way to the kitchen to start the first pot of coffee. Dean turns on the machine and waits. He rubs his eyes, grabs two mugs and places them on the counter. Once the machine is done, Dean pours himself a fresh mug, leaning back on the counter to wait for Cas to stumble his way in.
“I know.” Dean croaks with emotion.
Cas tries to be mad at him, but he just begrudgingly reshelves books trying not to smile. Hearing Dean laugh, makes him happy - and a happy Dean, makes a happy Cas.
“You’re an insufferable assbutt!”
“Shut up, Dean. It wasn’t funny the first time and it isn’t funny now.” Cas laughs, punching Dean on the shoulder.
"Sir, yes sir", Dean quips, kissing Cas gently on the cheek before moving to unlock the trunk. Cas quickly covers the distance to the small chapel and heads inside, closing the door behind him. Dean rests his head on the frame of the car door, letting the cool metal soothe any worries he has about what Cas is doing.
Upon arriving back, he found them in the library together having a domestic dispute about Dean moving the books once again.
It all started after they’d decided to grab food at the diner - a celebratory dinner of some sorts for a job well done. They sat at a corner booth, managing to squeeze all three six foot plus men in, with surprisingly minimal struggle. A waitress approaches to take their order, swaying her hips over flirtatiously. She turns to Cas, focusing on him solely.
“But then you had the balls to call
Pulling Dean closer - now hyper aware of how close they’re standing, he looks to his lips, asking him a silent question. Dean nods back, giving him his answer.
At this, Cas mimes his mouth being zipped to Dean. He fully planned on not telling him at all, because he knew how much Dean would hate that. And besides, he wanted to surprise Dean for once. So he planned to keep it a secret until they get there, if Dean doesn’t weasel the answers out of him that is. It was his chance to do something nice for Dean for a change, and he’ll be damned if he screws it up. Cas gives his thigh a pity tap before walking out the kitchen, Dean following behind him like a lost puppy.
"Cas," Dean soothes "you and me both know that 'relationship' isn't a word I'd really apply to any of my past partners, aside from Lisa. I don't really know what I'm doing here any more than you do."
“You did? So… Where are we going?”
Cas slowly retracts his arms from around Dean;  distancing himself from him, an apology resting on the tip of his tongue. “I’m sorry.” He sniffles, purposely studying the ground.
Dean offers to make Cas a drink, but he politely declines. His expression is caught somewhere between grumpy, and pitiful.
As almost in reflex, Cas gives Dean the middle finger and Sam bursts out laughing - milk shooting out his nose in protest.
Half an hour sees Dean and Cas seated beside each other in the library, Cas half buried in his salted caramel mocha (extra shot of espresso, extra caramel drizzle), while Dean sips his reheated coffee and flips through the car magazine he picked up to justify his trip. Every now and again he glances at Cas, an amused half-smile gracing his lips when he notes how happy the ridiculous drink makes the angel.
Cas has readjusted on Dean’s lap and his hips thrust upwards on instinct, causing them both to moan. It was then as if a switch had been turned on and Cas scrambles to sit beside Dean, giving them some space and starts rambling nervously. Dean can’t help but think how adorable he is.
“Dean? Did I do something wrong?” Cas asks with concern, perching on the edge of the table, furrowing his brows. Dean knew where this conversation was leading, yet he still couldn’t form a sentence.
Dean chuckles lightly, leaning forward to help.
No other words were uttered; Dean and Cas could both read each other like a book. The scene that had just played out on the screen resonated with them because they had been there. Both in the heat of the moment, willing to save one another’s lives in a matter of seconds. They’d both sacrificed themselves for the other, multiple times and knew what such a momentous moment like that meant. Nothing meant more than having one another in their lives, now more than ever because they both knew their love wasn’t brotherly, but eternal.
Sam laughs along with mirth, thinking of how far the angel had come. He pats Cas’ shoulder and bids him goodbye.
“Alright, I guess we’re watching Costner and Whitney angst tonight” Dean sighed, getting up to set up the DVD in the player. The popcorn was already popped, and two beers were gently sweating onto the coasters that Dean insisted on to protect the coffee table he’d set up. As the menu loaded, the two settled down onto the couch together, side by side. Cas, at first, seemed stiff, not really knowing where to put his hands, whether he should lean back, move closer, further away - until Dean lifted an arm, and smiled.
“How did you...?” Cas tilts his head, his expression drawing tighter, perplexed at the perfect guess through an opaque box.
Dean tries, he really does, but he can no longer keep the laughter in. He collapses in half, his entire body shaking as he crows out his delight at the prank finally being realized. He gasps, desperately trying to get air into his lungs between peals of laughter. One hand is waving in the air in front of him, a useless gesture to stop the amusement, considering he’s the one who made himself laugh.
“C’mere, angel” he coaxed “get comfy with me”.
He’s completely bewildered as he whirls around, books in hand. Bewilderment turns to ire, as he catches sight of Dean, one hand clasped over his mouth, one against his stomach, eyes already leaking tears of mirth.
Before Cas’ obscene addiction to being caffeinated, he would spend his nights organizing the library. He became almost obsessive over it, actually. If anyone misplaced a book - even moved it over by a single spot -  Cas would get irritated, and forcefully put it back where it belongs. The three men have been researching a case that’s been dragging them all down, and Dean has decided they need some fun. He moves a book, and adds another - neither of them now where they should be.
Dean lets out a gasp.
"Hey, you okay man?" Dean asks gently.
“Uh oh. Careful there, angel.” Dean jokes leaning back in his chair, cheeky grin set firm on his face.
After two mugs of coffee, a whole box of cocoa crunch devoured and Sam gone - Dean and Cas are the only two left in the kitchen. Cas had tried making toast after his first mug; but got distracted, burnt the toast and set the fire alarm off all in the span of ten minutes. Dean full belly laughed for five minutes, then tossed the charred bread out, before sliding over another well needed mug of bean juice to Cas. With a new plate of toast for Cas, they sit in comfortable silence.
“You know,” Dean starts “there may be something to this whole fancy coffee thing. Maybe I’ll try one next time.” He settles back into his seat, resuming his reading. Cas stares for just a moment longer, before once again smiling into his coffee. He’s already memorized the entire menu, and can’t wait to try it all.
“No, Cas, it’s just you, uh...you got a little something just, just there” Dean gestures vaguely at Cas’ face.
third date material, so Cas had simply rolled his eyes yet again, and climbed into the passenger seat.
“Ouch. You wound me, Cas.” Dean pretends to pout, then scoots forward. “Hey, wait. I can’t talk to you when you’re so far away. Come here.”
Ever since that night, Dean had gotten nowhere. All he got from Cas was “It’s a secret, Dean” and “Why do you hate surprises so much?” It’s fair to say Dean failed. Big time. Cas is refusing to tell him anything, to the point where Dean was now positively whining. He hates how Cas has whittled him down to this but he has to give it to him. He only hopes Cas isn’t berating himself over whatever he has planned for them, he’s a simple guy. Cas could take him to the movies and he’d be happy. In all honesty; as much as Dean complains, he can truthfully say he is looking forward to it.
Because he - he could see a smudge of tan in his peripheral vision, and hope was a raw, starving mouth under his breastbone. If he looked and it - it was
Every angel that Jack chose to create from now on would be designed off the template of Dean Winchester’s love for humanity.

regret meeting
Jack nodded, and touched two fingers to Dean’s forehead.
“Hey, Sammy. Listen to this,” Dean boasts giddily, stopping at the table to rest his foot on the chair.
“God, Cas, I nearly died waiting for you to find those.” Dean manages to get out. “If it had taken much longer, I thought I might have had an internal organ bust from trying not to laugh.”
Dean and Sam both shuffle awkwardly in their seats, not knowing how to react. Sam looks sideways at his brother, rolling his eyes as Dean struggles to speak. Dean brushes off the stares, instead working on quelling the rising bubble of jealousy that’s crept up and is trying to settle inside his stomach. He orders for both Sam and himself, in an attempt to get the uncomfortable interaction over with. He purposely ignores the looks Sam continues sending his way in the wake of the waitress’ departure, desperately needing to figure out why these feelings have sprung up on him so suddenly. Sure, he loves Cas, but where did this sudden, extreme
“The Bodyguard?” Dean asked, eyebrows lifted, incredulous. “You wanna watch a romance, Cas?”
“You’re in love with me?” Cas echoes, blinking back tears. It’s when Dean doesn’t answer straight away - rooted to the spot, that Cas starts to panic. The fear of Dean not meaning those three words, creeps up on him, his breathing erratic.
Dean winks at Cas. “Yeah, but you love me.”
adorable angel, Dean decides to help him out.
“I lost you for a second there, where did you go?” Cas looks at Dean curiously, as if this is a side he’s never seen in the decade or so they’ve known each other.
“Hello Dean” is the reply, warm and steady as the sun rising. He extends his hand to help Dean sit up, before finally settling himself to face Dean. Cas draws his knees up, looping his arms loosely around them. He’s gazing past Dean’s shoulder, but his expression is clear, untroubled.
Cas starts to say something but Dean squeezes Cas’ hip with one hand, and with the other hand, he puts a finger over Cas’ lips and the sentence dies on his tongue. Dean shushes him gently, and rubs a soothing circle on his hip, reassuring him.
” Cas reaches out to thread one of his hands into Dean’s.
“To be honest, not much,” Cas replies, a slight crease between his brows. He looks up at the late afternoon sky, breathing deeply once, before looking back down at Dean. His expression eases. “I wanted to see if I still felt a connection; if there was anything left for me there.”
Sam gapes at Cas, new to seeing this side of him.
Dean’s now wandering the halls with a fresh beer in his hand, wondering where everyone is. He can hear muttering as he comes closer to the library and stops to eavesdrop a little. No harm, no foul, right? He steps closer to the doorway and makes sure he’s hidden from his brother and angel, because he knows one small sound will give him away. The bunker has always been echoey in of itself but the hallways are twice as bad, something about narrow walkways or whatever. Dean had found that out one night, when he sleepily wandered the halls at 1am - where he intended to sneak some snacks back to his room, but on the way there; he ended up tripping on his robe. Dean failed to catch everything - but the wobbling plate of pie he had held. Dean had to cringe, as he watched in horror at not only losing a slice of pie, but watching the plate smash to smithereens and ricocheting along the floor. The sound that rang out all through the bunker could rival that of a pistol, and Dean flinched at the outcome. Fair to say, it woke Sam up and bitch face #33 was plastered all over his face. Dean had to laugh, or he’d cry at the stupidity of it all.
“Get ready, honeybee. We leave in an hour, tops.” Cas informs Dean, then slaps Dean’s butt in a see you later gesture.
Cas runs his thumb over Dean’s lips, entranced with how inviting they look. “Kiss me.” Dean whispers hoarsely. “Please.”
Dean doesn’t want to be that guy, and fuss over an outfit. But he gets one ready and lays it out on his bed. Satisfied with that decision, he downs the rest of his beer and gives himself a well done pat on the shoulder. As he closes the bedroom door behind him, he scoffs at the absurdity of Cas saying
“Thanks, Sam. Maybe I'll get lucky tonight.” He smirks to himself, before letting out a snort.
“No, yes, maybe. Fuck.” Dean finally chokes out, voice filled with emotion.
Cas has forgiven Dean for the book fiasco, and the hunt is  finally finished, the boys are travelling back, in absolute silence with nothing but the low rumblings of the impala reverberating between the tension in the air. The hunt went well - for all intents and purposes; Cas was upset with Dean, because he’d been ignoring him since they ate at the diner. Cas now appears to be sulking in the back seat; he’s been staring out of the window with a forlorn look set on his face since they set off.
“He’ll love it, Cas. He says no chick flick moments, but Dean secretly loves them.” Sam assures Cas, giving him a knowing smile.
, he chastises himself. Making sure he looks like he isn’t having a breakdown over the new realisation, he takes a deep breath before exiting the bathroom.
Dean just laughs. “Forget about it.”
Cas lifts his head, searching Dean for any hint that he's holding something back, but finds him open, affectionate.
“You want me to go out?”
“She called you pudding, man - she would have eaten you alive, by the way.”
The smell of a light caramelized, almost nutty aroma wafts all the way down the hallway and into Cas’ bedroom, waking up the angel almost instantly. He doesn’t always sleep, but when he does Cas wants - no, needs coffee. Standing up, he stretches his muscles and almost wishes he could stretch his wings. Walking into the kitchen, he’s met with the glorious sight of Dean against the counter, bow legs crossed at the feet, smiling widely.
As the tickle war starts to wane, Cas takes the bait and flips them over to pin Dean so fast, his head starts to spin. Nothing but filthy thoughts and
date for Dean, but Dean argued that driving the impala was
Walking over to the massive shelf holding Dean’s still-growing DVD collection, Cas scrutinized each one as if his choice would affect the fate of the world. Finally, he pulled one out, and presented it to Dean.
They both get out, Dean stretching with several satisfying pops of his spine. He looks to Cas for direction, but Cas looks...hesitant.
The room, thick with silence, makes the tension rise. Dean and Cas won’t look at each other; scared to voice the truth, in case of rejection. It’s when Dean decides to bite the bullet, and glances at Cas that his facade crumbles. Cas is crying - he made him cry, he hurt
Dean chuckles lightly, “Whiskey-pecan pie land.”
Dean turns the faucet on, splashing his face with cold water, to calm down.
As Dean stands in front of his door, Cas walks up to him, and smiles at Dean sweetly. He rests a hand on Dean’s right shoulder, and pecks him on the lips.
“Cas, no.” Dean interjects, taken aback. “You have nothing to be sorry about, okay? Hey, hey, look at me,” He pleads, cupping Cas’ face with his hand - forcing him to look into his eyes. “I love you. I- fuck. I really do. Took me a while to figure it out but, shit, Cas, I’m in love with you.”
Dean watches Cas get increasingly more frustrated, until he eventually finds the mis-shelved books, and Dean can no longer keep his laughter in. Dean does his full body laugh, and collapses in half; waving his hand in the air like he can’t take it. Even though, he’s the one who made himself laugh.
to get you some frou frou latte?”
“Over my dead body.” Dean mumbles underneath his breath.
“Would it kill you to just stop messing with my heart Cas, i’m try’na figure my mess out and then
to drive Baby - to the nearest Starbucks,
Cas wipes at his mouth, then up from his lip, between his nostrils, and completely misses entirely. “Did I get it all, Dean?” he asks, crossing his eyes trying to look at his own face.
“Yes.”
“Dean, you don’t understand. I
“Yes, sir.” Dean salutes jokingly.
He says, commanding. “I’ll be right back.” He points his finger directly at Dean as he exits the car.
“I look forward to seeing you naked.” Dean jokes, breaking the serious moment instantly. Cas rolls his eyes, and hits Dean smack bang in the face with a pillow.
They’ve been on the road for about fifteen minutes when Dean finally clues into the fact that they’re in the middle of main street in Lebanon.
honeypie; right in front of my burger - like what the fuck man? I had a total breakdown like…”
“I don’t know. Do you even- you flirted with that waitress back there, and it messed with my head. It’s nothing.”
“Room for one more?” Cas asks, his smile brightening as he takes in Dean’s response to his presence.
They’re sat in the library - Sam is sat reading, Cas is organizing a shelf, and Dean is watching Cas; pretending to read about forest spirits. Every time Cas gets near the section Dean messed with, Dean has to suppress his giggles. Sam, oblivious to it all, continues reading.
Still at the shelf, Cas tries to glare, tries to maintain his indignation, but faced with Dean’s joyous reaction, it’s impossible. When Dean is happy, Cas is happy. Cas shelves the book on Tibetan Yetis correctly, and brings the book on Leimonaiads and the cookbook to the table where he sets the cookbook aside to take into the kitchen on his next trip. He takes his seat next to Dean, who is still chuckling slightly as he runs his hand down his face.
Fast forward back to the car, and Dean still hasn’t said a word. Sam would think he was fine, if it wasn’t for his fists clenched on the steering wheel. He’s well and truly tired of all the bullshit these two keep landing themselves in, all because their communication wires are crossed. Being the constant third wheel, is really pissing Sam off and he ought to lock them in a room if they don’t get their shit together. Having had enough, Sam clears his throat.
“Let me get this straight; you want
The third and last time Sam catches them, he wishes he hadn’t. He had just exited his room and was walking down the hallway to grab some snacks from the kitchen, when a movement at the corner of his eye catches his attention. He knows there’s no way it’s a monster, but this job - this life, has you on the constant edge, so you never know what’s around the corner. With a hand on the demon blade - he refuses to not have on his person; at all times - Sam puts on a brave face and takes a sneak peek, to see none other than Dean and Cas making out on the bed. Thank chuck for small miracles - because Sam was not about to gouge his eyes out - they were fully clothed, but Sam splutters like the moose he is, then fake gags loud enough for them to hear.
“Wanna talk about what you did inside? Dean asks gently, crossing his legs so he can rest his elbows on his knees and lean in closer to Cas.
, they’ve turned so dark with arousal - it makes Dean suck in a breath.
“You are?”
“Funny.” Sam deadpans, continuing to munch on his breakfast.
Looking from Dean, to the coffee pot, and back again. Cas finally answers, low and guttural. “Morning, Dean.” Sam clears his throat. “And you too, Sam.”
“Nymph, Acheloid; Nymph, Alseid; Nymph, Dryad” Cas calls out, as he searches, all the while trying to ignore the increasing noises from Dean. “Nymph, Hamadryad - Yeti, Tibetan? This doesn’t belong here!” He looks back, and sees “A
"Yes," Cas smiles softly "but do you mind if I take a moment in the chapel?"
Dean walks away, his laughter echoing off the walls as it trails behind him. Sam is left convinced Gabriel is behind all of this.
Starbucks.” Cas all but begs. Dean stares at Cas.
“And then you went and called her honey muffin right back, like you wanted to know what time she got off work…”
“I don’t - fuck, I don’t know if you can hear me in there. Maybe you’re asleep, or maybe you just - can’t, in there, but.” Dean’s throat closed up for a long second, before he was able to unstick his voice with a coarse growl. “You
“We beat Chuck, Jack is God now, and he made me an archangel. Pretty sweet feathers, huh?” Yeah, he preened, flaring all his wings out to show them off, but like he was gonna have this kind of equipment and
Dean’s alarm woke him up at the usual time, and he groaned but didn’t bother hitting the snooze before dragging himself up. It wasn’t like he was getting up at six or anything, it was only nine, but lately Dean’s body seemed to be trying to make up for a few decades’ worth of sleep deprivation.
as he sat up on one elbow and eagerly accepted the coffee with a loud slurp. Dean smiled wider, laughed softly, and leaned in to press his lips into that tousled mess of hair.
over the likes of Dean. Cas deserved to be happy because he was loved; loved by someone who could actually say the words without choking.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean murmured.
, rushing in without a handle on all this power wasn’t going to help.
Cas was the brave one again, then, doing the hard work of leaning in the last tiny, infinite space between them and gracelessly, ardently crushing their mouths together. A whimper came out of Dean’s throat that he didn’t even have the heart to deny, not when he was busy slinging his arms around Cas’s ribs and parting his lips to finally learn what his angel tasted like.
