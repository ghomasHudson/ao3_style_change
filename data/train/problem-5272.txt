Tony jogged up the stairs, unwinding his scarf from his neck. The door to the apartment opened as he reached the second floor, and then Steve was there in front of him. Tony wrapped his hand around the back of Steve’s neck, pulling him down for a kiss.
Public speaking had never been his strong point. But maybe it was time to find new things to try, if he was going to be Tony’s boyfriend.
Rhodey gave him a special USB drive, with a programme written onto it that would, Rhodey assured him, get all the information they needed and copy it without leaving a trace.
“Sure. Hey Matt, what happened to your face?” Steve frowned. Tony glanced across the table and sure enough, there was a bruise on Matt’s temple that wasn’t there when he visited them in DC.
They moved in time to the music, oblivious of everyone around them and of Natasha, who smiled to herself as she hit post on the picture she’d just taken. Even though neither Steve nor Tony had approved it first, she had a feeling they wouldn’t mind.
He hung up and felt something settle in him at the idea of taking control. Relying on Tony still nagged at him, but it was less uncomfortable than the idea of being forced out.
They turned towards the court official standing by the entrance to the courtroom. Steve’s gut twisted with nerves. He swallowed.
“I love you,” Tony murmured, kissing Steve’s chin. “So very,“ - a kiss to the corner of his mouth - “very much.” He kissed Steve, licking his way into his mouth until Steve groaned and leaned into him.
“Jesus Christ, Barnes!” Tony exclaimed. “Quit with the sniper act. You’re gonna give me a heart attack one of these days.”
He gaped at Hank, his mouth hanging open, and Hank noticed the way his grip on the pen went impossibly tight. Hank was a surgeon; he was an expert at noticing the little things.
The fight was over, Steve saw when he sat down, but he couldn’t see Tony. Bucky was giving a statement which consisted of
“Yeah, pressure’s way too high,” he confirmed. “I’ll go to the pool place tonight or tomorrow and pick up some new sand.”“And a backwash hose.”
Natasha pulled her phone from her pocket as it vibrated against her hip, rolling her eyes when she saw Sharon’s name onscreen.
But then Hank Pym appeared and it all made sense. Of course, Hope must be meeting her father for breakfast. That made perfect sense.
“That may be,” Edwards repeated. “However, you have to acknowledge what it looks like. What it looks like to the parents of our students. I have had multiple complaints already this morning. Several decided not to send their children to school today. I think we can both agree that anything that impacts on the students’ learning is unacceptable. Which is why the board and I have come to a decision.”
He hurried through setting the flowers in water, then had the quickest shower in history, and redressed in the jeans that made his ass look good, and the shirt Peggy always said brought out his eyes. Steve all but ran out of the apartment, only to return when he realised he’d forgotten his inhaler, then it was back to the subway to meet Tony at Avengers Tower.
Steve and Tony broke apart. Tony giggled into Steve’s shoulder, while Steve ducked his head, biting his lip and blushing adorably. It took great resolve to convince himself to step back from Steve’s arms.
"Thank you," Foggy smiled, sitting back. He took a sip before announcing, “Everything looks in order here. If you two want to sign, I can witness it and then get these filed, and the company will be yours. Mr Stark?” Foggy held out a pen.
He led her to an empty exam room, yanking the curtain across behind her, as though it gave any kind of privacy beyond preventing everyone from staring.
The cat in question was dainty and all black, except for a splodge of white on its nose. It stared at Tony and Steve with disdainful green eyes, before continuing to clean itself, in a clear dismissal.
“So what’s wrong with me? Am I dying?” Bobbi asked with the casual flippancy that Clint remembered from their passive aggressive fights when they were together. Looks like she was still using it to hide when she was afraid.
“I’m her friend,” he continued, pushing his red tinted glasses further up his nose. Bruce noticed the white cane he was carrying for the first time. “And I’m a lawyer. Matt Murdock.”
“I didn’t divorce Steve,” Tony chuckled. “Even I’m not that stupid.” He turned to MJ. “This is Michelle. Her friends call her MJ. She’s the reason why I found you tonight. She’s your kid.”
Tony hung up, twisting his phone in his hands. The time dragged out as he waited for Steve, and the doubt began to creep in. Well,
“Oh man,” Clint sighed. “I’m sorry you got caught up in this shit. I just… I got in my head. I started having nightmares again. About Loki and New York. What could’ve happened if Nat didn’t get me back. What did happen before she got me back. I walk past that Wall of Valour and I see those names. The ones I put up there.”
Their eyes locked. Suddenly Steve understood what it was like for Bucky when Steve was a kid, running headfirst into a fight he couldn’t win and why Bucky always pulled the other kids off of him and took the punch himself. Tony was so vulnerable.
Rhodey had a dry humour that reminded Steve of Tony, and an innocent expression which belied a talent for the dirtiest double entendres Steve had ever heard - and he was friends with Bucky Barnes. Meanwhile, Sharon was quick and intelligent and could deliver the most deadpan humour before using their distraction to unrepentantly steal the last spring roll from right underneath Steve’s nose.
“What do you want?” Steve countered. Tony was great at asking what Steve needed in bed, but not so great at putting himself first. And sometimes Steve just wanted to spoil him.
He grabbed the guard’s outstretched arm with one hand while slapping him across the face with the other. Twisting the guard’s wrist, Steve threw him onto the floor, dropping onto one knee and punching the guard unconscious.
Until strong hands slipped underneath his arms and yanked him upwards, breaking the surface. Tony gasped for air, despite the fact he could breathe easily underwater while in the suit, his fingers scrabbling at Steve’s shoulders.
An urge to turn around, get back in the car and go home came over Tony. In theory, it would be easy. In reality, it would result in thousands of pictures from the paparazzi outside and instant headlines questioning why he chose to leave as soon as he arrived, then Fury would yell at him, which meant Bucky would have to yell at him. And if Bucky yelled at him, then Pepper would yell at him, and Tony was tired of people yelling at him.
But then Tony’s voice floated into his head, asking him to order a pizza. Steve stopped. He could just… ignore Tony’s request and lie to him the next day. Except Tony would know, because apparently he could hear when Steve was hungry.
“Given my… personal history, would it be possible to get someone else on this? I don’t think I can be objective,” he admitted.
“No!” Angie whimpered. Steve nodded his fervent agreement, except it was tea he longed for, because he only drank coffee when he had a hangover.
“It’s not the books,” Matt said. “Is it? The problem’s not the books, the problem is why your mom had to sell them, isn’t it?”
“When we were, I think nine, this boy - different boy - told us boys and girls couldn’t be friends, and Peggy bit him.”
“Wait, what?” Tony’s feet fell off the table with a thump. “You cracked it? You cracked the code’s code’s code’s whatever?”
“Kid, take my advice: don’t join the Army. You have your whole life ahead of you. Don’t be in such a hurry to grow up. Okay, I don’t think your wrist is broken, but I’m gonna sneak you in for an x-ray just to be sure,” Dr. Stark said, getting to his feet. “Hey, listen. I know things are rough right now, but you’re sixteen. You’ve got a lot of life still to live. And as for your boyfriend? Relationships are hard. Believe me. I know. But if you find the right person, it’s all worth it. And you can make it work.”
“I could,” Tony nodded. “But I don’t think that’s the best idea. I think a better idea would be planting a bug. See, if we go in, yeah we get details on everything that’s already happened. And considering how paranoid the Maggia seem to be, there is no guarantee they’re not switching up their bases on a regular basis.”
Steve bristled. He jerked away from Tony’s hand and scowled out at the city below as it grew smaller beneath them. His eyes suddenly prickled with tears, which made no sense at all. Steve fought the urge to growl.
Picking up the aluminium pole, he fought to get the net off, swearing under his breath when it caught the skin of his finger as he pushed down the metal studs to release the head. He ignored the very obvious sound of giggles coming from the pool behind him, focusing on finally pulling the net free and replacing it with the brush head instead.
He turned down the covers while he waited for Steve and took the lube out of the drawer, before toeing off his boots and kicking them into the wardrobe. He was plugging in his phone when the bedroom door opened and Steve returned, a minty-fresh aroma of toothpaste following him.
“Can you take Ellie for a few hours?” Steve asked. “I want to see if I can sleep through the worst of it.”
“Okay, I gotta let you go if we’re going to eat tonight,” Tony announced, patting Steve’s chest. Steve stepped back reluctantly, climbing onto a high stool to watch Tony work.
“That’s bad for you,” Hope said as she joined him outside, staring out at the rain hammering the parking lot. Scott held out his packet of cigarettes to her; Hope glanced at him, then took one, holding it between her teeth as she pulled out her lighter. “Thanks.”
“I have a lunch meeting on Tuesday, so I could meet you at that coffee shop in Brooklyn we went to before, say, three thirty?”
He scrolled through the names, flicking back and forth between the pages. He clicked on a few names although he wasn’t sure what made him pick those ones over the others, but nothing really clicked.
“She’s on the third viewing of the same movie, so I think my sanity’s on its way out,” he replied with a wan smile.
Tony took a shaking breath then, his eyes fixed on Steve’s the entire time, he stepped forward and curled his hand around Steve’s wrist. By now, Steve’s heart was pounding so loudly, he felt sure that Tony must be able to hear it, even without enhanced hearing.
And maybe Steve would be there too. Sitting crushed into the booth at Tony’s side, stealing the last wing from under Bucky’s fingers and grinning unrepentantly; joining Matt in teasing Bucky; complaining with Marci about asshole corporate lawyers, and listening to Foggy complain about the lack of infrastructure in Hell’s Kitchen.
Hammer’s face fell from his usual smarmy smile to a scowl. “So when it’s me, you’re married. But it’s not that when you’re flirting with Stark.”
Foggy read through the papers carefully, then said, "Actually, Mr Rogers, could I take that glass of water after all?"
Steve bit back a smile, reaching behind them to hit play on his laptop, and watching Tony’s reaction as the Disney logo faded to black and the prologue began as the black cauldron melted through the smoke.
Arnie nodded, pressing his trembling lips together, and Steve transferred her carefully into Arnie’s arms.
“No, we wouldn’t,” Daniel agreed, taking a sip of his beer. “Come on, Steve. Tony is a billionaire superhero and you’re…”
Steve opened his mouth to tell him that he ate a banana on Tuesday, then realised that probably wasn’t going to help his case and shut it again, burrowing deeper into his blanket nest. He listened to Rhodey puttering around the apartment over the laugh-track from whatever show it was he was watching, no doubt getting ready to go out and meet his girlfriend.
When they went to LA the month before in search of the Maggia’s lab, they were greeted by the Dreadnoughts: fully articulated humanoid robots, with a veritable arsenal of weapons. They went in expecting an easy mission, and they came home battered and bruised and with nothing. Because while they were fighting the Dreadnoughts, the Maggia was evacuating the facility and wiping everything from their computers, beyond even Tony or Natasha’s ability to bring it back.
Angie stuck out her tongue and Steve chuckled, feeling the knot of anger and hurt in his chest loosen a little.
“Breaking the internet,” Steve confirmed. It would get the message out there quickly but it didn’t involve any of the press, which was always a win in Steve’s book.
“Woah! Sorry, Steve,” Scott apologised. Then he frowned, tilting his head to the side as he spotted Alexander on the floor. “Uhh…”
Rhodey eyed Steve’s nest, his three-day old t-shirt and a half-empty can of Cheese-whiz with judgement clearly written across his face. A voice which sounded suspiciously like Bucky told Steve that he should care, but caring seemed like way too much effort. Effort he just didn’t have the energy for, despite sitting on his ass for the whole weekend.
He stepped out of the front doors into the sunshine, squinting a little as his eyes adjusted and wishing he’d thought to put his sunglasses on again before he left. When his vision cleared, he spotted a familiar figure leaning against a bright red sports car, arms folded and a small smile on his face.
A red cloud appeared in the water, tendrils snaking out across the pool and Steve felt like he was going to throw up. He clutched his phone, the edge of the plastic case digging into his fingers, but he couldn’t think of anything but the refrain of
The team greeted them - Bucky, Matt and Natasha from the kitchen, Bruce and Thor breaking their conversation at the table, and Clint perched on his own chair - warmly. Tony found himself studying Clint carefully. He was the only member of the team who’d declined to go sightseeing with Tony and Steve in DC, choosing instead to skulk away as soon as he’d given evidence.
“Thanks for a great night,” Steve said. “Hey, I finish early on Tuesday and Thursdays. You wanna get coffee one afternoon?”
“Steve? Honey?” Stark held out his hand; Steve’s eyes lingered on it for a long moment, before continuing to dart around the corridor. But then he reached out, putting his hand into Stark’s and clinging on with what looked like a death-grip. “That’s it, I’m here. You’re okay,” Stark assured him. “Can I hug you?”
If Marci was surprised to see Tony the next time they met, she didn’t show it. Steve was definitely crafting those mental adoption papers.
“You should be so lucky,” Steve teased, wrapping his arms tightly around Tony’s neck and leaning their temples together.
Which was… kinda unexpected. Because for the past year, his libido had been a bit of a no show, except for his first month in LA when he threw himself into the club scene trying to forget
Steve picked up his sketchpad again, letting Tony look at what he’d started working on. “It’s a house. A design for a house. One that you could come and go from. And instead of being below floor level, you’d be on the level with… me.”
Maybe it was a sign of his own problems, but Steve turned and glared at him and asked, “And how exactly are you going to do that? You have a tail and you’re stuck in a pool in the Hollywood Hills. You’re not coming after me. You can’t.”
“He’s supposed to be some kind of genius,” Sharon added. “But honestly? He’s just riding on the coattails of everyone here.”
Tony turned to Steve and found him already looking in Tony’s direction. They stared at each other awkwardly, both trying to find the word to turn down the offer without making it clear they were on the verge of having sex.
were writing about him and filling in the gaps where they couldn’t find the information they wanted.
Tony stepped into the apartment, pulling off his coat, before tossing it and his scarf onto one of the bar stools. A small artificial Christmas tree sat in the corner of the room, decorated with a mismatched collection of ornaments and tinsel. Both windows were ringed with fairy lights, twinkling against the grey skies outside. Christmas cards were scattered across every surface. It was cozy and homely and Tony loved it.
“Not really. Some investors are a little, um, wary about the whole superhero thing with Mr Stark. Plus some of them are still struggling to get their heads around the whole making his assistant CEO thing, because apparently we can’t have women running Fortune 500 companies. So this event is supposed to project stability and show how Mr Stark is a team player, so postponing doesn’t exactly… give that impression?”
Steve laughed until his face muscles ached, watching Tony’s mock-rant and listening to JARVIS’ long-suffering replies and wondered why he was so nervous about telling Tony the truth.
Tony’s knees buckled; he held himself up on shaky arms just long enough to pull out before collapsing along Steve’s side. Steve turned to him, smiling before pressing their lips together in a lingering kiss.
Tony clearly didn’t believe him, but he just nodded and reached across the console to squeeze Steve’s hand, letting the journey pass in silence.
Steve sat cross-legged on the couch, his laptop balanced on his knees, surrounded by papers, dirty dishes, and two passed-out friends. Rhodey was star-fished on the other end of the couch, a wad of papers teetering over the edge of the cushions as his grip turned lax in sleep, while Sharon was curled up in the armchair, her arms wrapped around her iPad like a teddy bear. Steve spared them a glance, smiling to himself, before scooping more ice cream from the tub and sticking the spoon in his mouth as he continued scrolling through the files they’d found on the USB drive.
“Yeah, but I didn’t want to,” Steve pointed out, pulling a couple of paper towels from the dispenser. Something that Alexander had never challenged, he realised, compared to others who’d pushed him to go on to be more than ‘just a nurse’. “You never wanted me to be a doctor, did you? Too scared I might be better than you?”
“Okay,” Tony swallowed. “Okay, let’s throw this stuff out and we’ll start over. We’ll get a whole new set-up and you can watch
Steve hummed. Privately he thought the world was better off without Howard Stark, and not just because of the way he’d treated Tony. Steve didn’t think the man who’d built some of the deadliest weapons in America’s history was any great loss.
“Hey!” Clint called, clapping his hands. “Can we get back to the point here? Namely can I keep the dog? Please?”
It was just because Tony was here. Steve saw him every day. It was proximity and nothing else. And maybe, if he said it enough, Steve would start to believe it.
“It’s an excellent painting,” Steve replied diplomatically, hiding the fact he wanted nothing more than to tear it from the wall and destroy it.
Tony shook his head in an attempt to appear unaffected, as though he didn’t have the urge to throw Steve on the bed whenever he brought out the military talk. Steve just grinned like the bastard he was, knowing exactly what he was doing to Tony, before heading to the bathroom
He continued making his way across the common area, aiming for the bar where Bruce was sitting with Pepper and Coulson. Surely he could rely on one of them to tell him the truth. However, he became waylaid when the elevator doors opened and Nick Fury stepped out.
But then his first class was the same. They were full of giggles and kept talking in hushed whispers, no matter how many times Steve tried to divert them back to the task at hand. He knew military history wasn’t the most interesting subject, but they’d all picked the elective and usually they were a good class.
“We’ll call your social worker and get things straightened out,” May continued. “Although considering you’ve been here all night and they haven’t come looking for you, I’m going to have words with them. I mean, honestly, you’re only sixteen. You’re a child. Haven’t they heard of this thing called duty of care?”
,” Steve exclaimed. “Yes. Yes, I love it. I’d love it even if it wasn’t a key, because it’s beautiful. I love it.”
Tony opened his mouth to ask who she meant again, but Bucky slapped his shoulder, drawing attention. Tony frowned.
Clint was frozen in horror. On one hand, he felt like a gauntlet had been thrown down and he never refused a dare, never. But on the other, he didn’t want to be here for this! He saw similar looks of discomfort on Hope, Scott and Sharon’s faces. Hammer, the idiot, looked smug.
He realised again how lucky he was that Tony managed to keep their relationship out of the spotlight for so long, because Steve definitely couldn’t have dealt with this in the early days. He wasn’t sure he could cope with it now, but he managed to grit his teeth and cling on to Tony’s hand to get through.
Yeah. Steve wasn’t an expert at social interaction, and he didn’t know Rhodey that well despite living with him for a year, but he was fairly certain that wasn’t going to go very well.
“Good afternoon, everyone,” a voice boomed and Steve winced. The owner of the voice, a balding man with a greying beard, stood on a podium which elevated him above the crowd.
His tone was the same tone Naomi used not twenty minutes earlier; innocent and finagling, looking for information while trying to pretend otherwise. Steve was tired of that tone. No one ever asked him how he was doing out of concern for his well-being anymore. No one asked him anything anymore, unless they were trying to get information on his relationship or Tony or the Avengers.
“Oh God, yes,” Steve groaned, his head falling back, exposing his neck and the trickle of sweat making its way over his skin. With an extra thrust of his hips, Tony leaned down, sucking on Steve’s neck which meant he felt Steve’s resulting moan, all the way from his lips to his dick. “Tony… Oh god, that’s amazing. Don’t stop.”
“We’re running out of options, Steve. As much as I really want to take him down, I’m limited by the law. Which I really hate sometimes,” she added. “I’ll make an appointment at the family court, but you should really think about the press idea. If we control it, we can use it to our advantage.”
Steve froze, a Red Vine hanging out of the corner of his mouth as he looked up at his roommate guiltily. Rhodey was staring at him, hands on his hips, with his
Finally freeing himself from his jeans, Steve dropped to his knees while Tony tossed his underwear aside and sat on the edge of the bed. Steve ran his hands up Tony’s thighs, kneading his fingers into the muscles and making them both groan.
to make these AMAZING dating profiles and the match screen and I LOVE THEM. Check out Trashie’s art on
Dropping the tattered pieces of the photo onto the table, Steve forced himself to turn away and continue his search for the generator. Getting angry at dead people would do nothing to help Tony now, but finding the generator would.
For a so-called genius, Nefaria wasn’t very smart, Steve decided. For starters, both he and the guard by the door had failed to notice that throughout Nefaria’s monologue, Steve had carefully worked his hands free from the cuffs behind his back.
His phone buzzed again, this time with a photo. Tony clicked on it, blowing it up to fullscreen, and smiled. Steve had his arm stretched above his head, giving a perfect shot of him curled up in the corner of his sofa. Sure enough, he was only wearing a pair of boxer briefs, and held a game controller in his other hand.
“Okay,” Steve replied, “First off: if you’re a narcissist, by very definition you’re self-centred, so.”
“Sorry,” Steve winced, glancing around. He’d wondered when he returned to Josie’s if he’d be banned for starting a fight just a few hours before, but instead Josie beckoned him up to the bar and handed him a drink without a word. When he tried to pay, she waved him off and told him that it was on the house.
His mind was occupied with Tony, alternating between trying to figure out how to get Tony out of here and how to make Tony feel better, so he didn’t realise he wasn’t alone until a voice called out, “You’ve been busy, Mr Rogers.”
He worked Steve open until he had three fingers in him, and Steve’s back was covered in a fine sheen of sweat and he gasped and arched his back every time Tony thrust his fingers into his hole.
He started coughing again and Steve inched forward, his fingers twitching at his side. He was desperate to help, but what could he do? Glancing around the room, he made a decision.
They remained there until the sound of muffled voices and a key in the door announced Angie’s return. Reluctantly, Steve pulled back, falling to the side. His leg remained thrown over Tony’s thighs; Tony caught his ankle, holding it in place and rubbing small circles into Steve’s skin, just above the bone. It had everything to do with wanting to retain contact with Steve, and
Steve grinned, watching Arnie and their pup greet each other. Beside him, Tony was very deliberately not fidgeting and Steve could smell the change in his scent that said he was nervous.
Steve began to thrust in earnest, but he dragged it out, teasing Tony, winding him up then backing off rather than simply chasing his release. Tony let out a whine; Steve muffled it with a kiss, licking his way into Tony’s mouth.
When he opened his eyes again, Stane was gone but the pool water churned violently. Steve scrambled away from the edge, his eyes fixed on the mess of limbs only vaguely visible through the foam and spray.
“So, how do you think I feel?” Steve cried. “How do you think it feels to see you in a fight? You know, I saw that fight in LA, and then in DC. And then they attacked your home, Tony. I saw your suit, or what was left of it. Jesus Christ, do you have any idea how that makes me feel? But you’re yelling at me for taking an asshole down a peg or two?”
“I don’t really know anything about business,” Steve said, “But doesn’t that mean they need him to make… any decisions?”
“Hey, no,” Tony interrupted, kissing the top of his head. “Honey, no. You are not weak. I would never say that,” he promised, cupping Steve’s cheek. “I know… a lot about having a father who… doesn’t act like a father. And you hate him, but you still love him, because he’s your dad, and you think
It wasn’t until he was in the taxi that Tony realised hanging up like that was probably rude, and he spent the entire journey to Brooklyn kicking himself for it. He paid the taxi driver, left the cab, then remembered his key to Steve’s apartment was sitting in the penthouse back in Manhattan. And he couldn’t use the buzzer, not at this time in the morning, not unless he wanted to wake Angie, which Tony was pretty sure was a Very Bad Idea.
A part of him wondered when Tony Stark decided a night in eating pizza was better than a night out partying. Another part of him knew it was after meeting Steve. Since meeting Steve, he didn’t want to go out and meet new people. He just wanted to get to know Steve.
For a second, it didn’t register. Then Steve realised with a start exactly what had just flickered through his mind without him realising. Because it felt so natural, he realised. He loved Tony, and loving Tony felt as natural as breathing.
Steve tapped his finger against his phone, twisting his mouth to the side. Then with a sigh, he began to type.
Tony felt his face split into a grin, powerless to stop in the face of a freshly fucked out and delighted Steve Rogers.
Throughout the day, the evidence seemed to point towards Steve making a quick recovery. Maybe it was just a twenty four hour thing, Tony mused hopefully. Steve managed to eat the rest of the apple over the morning, then a piece of toast, and he even made it through a small portion of oatmeal at dinner.
“I don’t think anybody would expect you to,” Angie shrugged. “For what it’s worth, I think you’re making the right choice.”
Something told Steve to stay silent. He remembered how easily Tony understood the instructions for the pump and filter, but he’d never questioned it outside of his own head.
“Is it possible you became even more beautiful in the last five months?” Tony wondered while Steve reached down, wrapping a hand around his own dick and stroking himself. “You are stunning, so fucking beautiful. Jesus Christ, I am the luckiest bastard in the world.”
Steve pulled back, not completely, just enough to see Tony, and for a second he thought Tony’s eyes flickered towards his lips before dismissing it as wishful thinking.
Steve let himself slide down beneath the covers, putting aside his now-empty mug and calling, “JARVIS, can you get the TV please? Thanks,” he added when the windows dimmed and the TV appeared on the glass.
Tony glanced up from the paperwork he’d agreed to fill out so Hope could leave on her date. His face fell a little when he saw Pierce entering the nurses’ station, although the double take Pierce did at the sight of him was very satisfying.
Steve watched the emotions flit across Tony’s mismatched eyes: uncertainty, hope, fear, longing. Finally, he swam forward and reached out. His palm was warm when it touched Steve’s, gripping his fingers on the edge of too tight as he shook Steve’s hand.
But even then, why bother? Why drag Tony’s name through the mud like that? It wasn’t like he could turn up and
“Because my dad is back in my life,” Steve admitted. “He turns up every so often and demands money. Only this time he wants regular payments. Because he thinks that your money is my money and he’s… an asshole. We’re going to try to get an Order of Protection but it’s his word against mine so Marci’s not hopeful. She wants to leak it to the press, but I don’t know.”
“Don’t diss the gym selfies,” Clint called. “Thanks to them we have more followers than Justin Bieber.”
but I know, I know sometimes you can’t believe that until you start to get better. Sometimes you have to do it for someone else until you can do it for yourself.”
“Then don’t,” Steve shrugged. He sank further into the couch, taking Tony’s hand in his own. “Don’t go. We’ll… go do all the tourist traps. Like the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.”
“No, no. This is good. Better we find these things out now, and not down the line when one of us says
Tony’s eyes flickered from side to side while he considered his answer. They were brown, Steve noted, dark brown with flecks of amber and he itched to draw them.
“For putting those images in my head, I’m not sharing my coffee with you,” Clint sniffed, foregoing the mug and taking the coffee pot with him as they left the break room.
Steve inhaled sharply, glowering furiously at Tony and wishing he had more control so he could hide how close to home his words struck. He felt his lips wobble and clenched his jaw. “You’re such a fucking asshole,” he ground out. “I don’t know why I’m wasting my time with you.”
“Then it’s a good job you did,” Sharon continued, keeping an eye on May Parker. “Because a few hours later, that same Buick crashed into an SUV, seriously injuring the driver and his daughter. She’s in surgery right now. The Buick’s driver was three times over the legal limit. Your actions probably saved both your lives.”
“Kind of a long story,” Tony sighed. “On a mission of mercy or something, I don’t know. Trying to find Nick Fury.”
His mouth went dry. Tony stared at him but every time Steve tried to speak, it felt like his tongue was twisted up in knots.
“Jess was assaulted when she was in the Army. The guy got away with it and she got a discharge. Everyone says this is a result of that.”
“Thanks, Scott,” Steve smiled, patting him on the shoulder. As he returned to the nurses’ station, Steve couldn’t help but wonder what the hell he ever saw in Alexander.
“Yes,” Steve replied warily. He’d seen enough of Peggy’s trials to know that defence lawyers weren’t interested in being the witnesses’ friends, nor did they care who they trampled on to ensure their client was acquitted.
Hanging up, he turned back to Ari, who was still clutching the files and StarkPad in his arms and staring at Tony with wide eyes.
“Yes, honey?” Tony murmured, pulling that sensitive spot between his teeth gently and delighting in the whine it elicited from his husband.
Because he’d finally figured out what it was about the pool that made it so hateful - or perhaps more accurately, one of the things which made it so hateful. There were a lot. Steve had a list. In the pool, Tony was constantly reminded of his place below humans. He was always looked down on, physically and metaphorically, as though he was somehow less worthy than the humans surrounding him. In his mind, Steve could see a house where the floor was level with the bottom of the pool, with rivers snaking between rooms, giving Tony unrestricted access and making him part of everything.
The artist was good, because it was clearly Tony, sitting on Maria’s lap, but he was smiling happily and Steve knew without a doubt that Tony had never been happy when the Starks were alive.
Ellie looked up at him with wide eyes before reaching up and wrapping her hand around his nose and tugging hard.
“Alright boys,” he called. “This has been great fun, but I’m gonna have to split. Sorry to spoil your fun, but, you know how it is. So, weapons systems offline.”
“I didn’t invite him along,” Tony explained. “This was supposed to be a date. But you try getting rid of Captain America when he’s made up his mind to do something.”
Barton sighed. “My battery died. So I stopped, to replace it. And while I was replacing it, he-” he jabbed his finger towards Thor, “-nailed me in the face and knocked me on my ass!”
“Found it,” Steve called as he re-entered the house. Dropping down by the edge of the pool, he pulled his phone out of the pocket of his board shorts and handed it over to Tony. “I thought it looked like it’s all connected up. What do you think?”
“Come here,” Tony murmured, tugging Steve up. Tony crawled up the bed, falling against the headboard, spreading his legs and crossing them at the ankle. Steve climbed into his lap, straddling his thighs before leaning down to kiss him. “Like this?” Tony asked, sliding his hands up Steve’s back.
it is to outsmart you. Because that control panel you see? It’s biometrically coded to me. And if you destroy it? You destroy this whole ship.”
And maybe it was stupid or hopelessly naive, but part of her was glad that Hogan was taking the chance. She hoped it paid off.
“Which means it’s on this boat. Which means we can take them out. And if we take them out, then it’s going to be a lot easier to take down Nefaria and his men, right? Right?”
The two staircases met in a landing which overlooked the ballroom, he discovered. Tony paused for a moment, creating an entrance worthy of Tony Stark even though his heart wasn’t in it, before descending the final steps into the ballroom.
“Don’t forget, Steve. I know a lot of people. Important people. People on boards and committees. The kinds of people who can revoke medical licenses.”
“I should be used to it. I always get sick. Every winter,” he grumbled. “I have a shitty immune system.”
Steve laughed. But his stomach jumped at the idea of marrying Tony, and it wasn’t in the bad way either.
“I promise, Steve,” Tony said instantly. He didn’t even need to think about it. “I promise, I will always do everything I can to come back to you.”
, Steve thought angrily, then felt sick with guilt. What kind of terrible person would wish for someone to starve just because he couldn’t be bothered to get out of bed? Steve’s vision blurred and he buried his face in his pillow until the stupid and pointless tears disappeared.
“Well,” Steve replied, folding his arms on Tony’s chest and resting his chin on them so they were face to face. “Lucky for you, you never have to find out.”
Tony sighed, shaking his head. But at his side, Steve snorted. Tony’s head snapped up; just like that, Steve looked like his normal self again.
It was there when they joked about Steve being able to keep up with Tony’s rambling explanations because, “I’m a genius, you know?”
“Maybe if somebody hadn’t rushed me out of the house I wouldn’t have,” Tony retorted, raising his eyebrows at MJ. Then he softened his expression. “I’m sure she’ll tell you all about it.”
“No!” Tony fisted his hands in his hair. “Why are you being so impossible? I just want you to stay safe!”
Steve grabbed a pillow and buried his face into it as Tony pushed in slowly, muffling his groans. Once he was fully sheathed in Steve’s body, Tony paused, letting his head hang between his shoulders and gasping for breath. It didn’t matter how many times they did this; he would never be used to the heady feeling of making love to his husband. Sparks danced at the base of his spine and it took everything he had not to move before Steve had a chance to adjust.
“Friends,” Thor called, reappearing and vaulting easily over a pile of detritus. “The exits are all blocked.”
“It most certainly is not,” Hank said grimly. Then he frowned and turned to Scott. “Wait. Why do you care?”
“You’ve got me, honey,” Tony promised, his thrusts speeding up, unable to stave off the inevitable any longer. A few more thrusts and Tony came with a choked off cry, aware of the teenager asleep on the other side of the apartment. His blood buzzed in his ears, making everything go pleasantly fuzzy for a few moments.
Tony smiled against his lips, cupping Steve’s neck with both hands and using his thumbs to tilt his chin higher. He felt Steve’s hands grip his hips, coaxing him into straddling Steve’s hips as Steve lay down properly so Tony was looming over him. He knew how much Steve loved this position.
He turned towards the door, exchanging a nod with Ari before they took a door each and threw them open.
Steve tried not to fidget as he waited for Rhodey to get home from work, nerves twisting in his stomach. Looking for a distraction, he pulled out his phone and opened up the tab still sitting on the contact page for Dr. Helen Cho. Every few days, he would open the tab and stare at it for a while before chickening out and closing it again.
“Yeah. She’s called Hannah and she’s your eighteen month old niece,” Tony revealed, breaking into a grin. “Steve. I came all the way to Brooklyn to help you babysit,” he pointed out. “Knowing full well there was no chance of sex with you with three kids in the apartment. No, there’s no one else. Just you.”
He had to find a way to get Tony out of there and fast. This was too close; Steve didn’t think he could live through another close call like that.
Near the end of the row, Tony came to a sudden stop, causing Steve to bump into his back. To Tony’s delight, Steve didn’t pull away, remaining pressed up against his back, their hands caught between them.
Stark threw his weight against the door once, twice, and on his third attempt the lock broke. Stark threw the door open and Steve shot out. His face was red and streaked with tears, and his eyes were like saucers as they shot around the corridor. Stark moved to his side, slow and steady, his hands outstretched.
Evie Rose gave an exaggerated sigh, slumping against Tony’s side, until he had to loop his arm around her shoulders to hold her up, to stop her from knocking him off of his feet. How much did six year olds weigh anyway?
“Come on, come on, Steve. Come on,” he muttered. “Please be alright. Please be alive. Hey J, while we’re waiting, can you throw up all the information available on Dream Master Inc? Thanks bud.”
“Did you forget that I was the only one who knew that Steve and Tony were married?” Bruce pointed out. “Because I know how to use Google.”
“Hi buddy,” Tony choked. He reached out, cupping the back of DUM-E’s arm and resting his face against his claw. DUM-E hummed and whirred in concern, and Tony felt tears slipping down his face involuntarily.
Lying naked, limbs tangled together with hands roaming as they made out, Tony realised that being quiet had it’s advantages. Because yes, their usual teasing was fun and hot and so, so sexy. But there was something intensely intimate about the silence punctuated only by sharp breaths and shuddering sighs when one of them found a particularly sensitive spot.
“Helping Peggy with her Christmas shopping,” Steve explained. He sat down next to Tony, twisting to face him. “For the record, I missed you too.”
“As long as he doesn’t eat any of my Balenciagas and Liho doesn’t object, fine,” Tony replied. He turned to Steve. “You’re not allergic to dogs, right? Gonna put a dampener on you moving in if you are.”
“No,” he replied. “I want to see the verdict, but I don’t want to sit there and see Nefaria smirk at me. Besides, if I’m not there I can believe it’s going well and I don’t have to see anything that might prove otherwise. Do you? Want to watch?”
“If you two are already talking about marriage, maybe you should say something,” Rhodey suggested in all seriousness.
There was a tiny voice in his head which said he should apologise to Tony, but another bigger, louder voice insisted Steve had nothing to apologise for.
Clint shrugged, still not looking at Tony. His concern for Clint returned in full force. There was definitely something going on, of that Tony was certain, but he was equally sure that asking outright was a surefire way to make Clint clam up. Unfortunately, Tony also knew that he wasn’t exactly equipped to deal with emotional problems. He was best with problems that he could hit with a hammer or blast with a repulsor.
Bruce raised his eyebrows. “With all due respect, Mr Borson, which one of us is the medical professional?”
According to his wiki, 616 Tony hates Lord of the Rings and I decided to steal that. And according to his wiki, 616 Steve's favourite movie is You've Got Mail.
“I can walk,” Steve insisted, gritting his teeth to ignore the way his knees stung with every step. “I’m fine.”
He shifted away from Bruce slowly; when he heard the Hulk roar and the SWAT team scrambled to react, Tony slipped between their vehicles, their attention fixed on the big guy rather than the genius, billionaire, philanthropist running in the opposite direction.
“We’re not done,” Joseph snarled, shoving Steve against the wall, trapping his arms and making it effectively impossible to get free.
“It’s terrible, yeah,” Steve agreed. “But people are stronger than they look. They can surprise you.”
He found Clint in the communal kitchen, halfway through building a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
He heard Thor’s raucous laughter coming from the direction of the bar and caught a glimpse of purple by the buffet table which made him groan. Surely Natasha didn’t let Clint wear his purple tuxedo? Tony considered tracking him down, before deciding he didn’t care. Clint wasn’t his problem tonight. They were off-duty Avengers, which meant it wasn’t his job to keep Clint in line. He could enjoy himself.
He tried to power through, focusing his energy on Ellie and her needs instead of the ache that permeated his body, but eventually he admitted defeat and asked JARVIS to ask Tony to come downstairs.
“Excellent,” Tony declared. “Then it is my utmost pleasure to say Mr Rogers, you have three minutes to get out of my building or security will remove you. And considering my security includes a super-soldier and a demigod, I wouldn’t hang around.”
“Logic and extortion. Evie Rose, you are my kind of girl,” Tony chuckled. “More ice cream, coming right up.”
“Hey, that’s not fair,” Steve called. “People were uncomfortable but no one else was going to say anything.”
“My suit’s dead,” he yelled, the voice modulator gone like everything else. “I need you to grab the release. My right knee! Can you get it?”
“And because of him, when I was a boy, we had nothing. You know, they always talk about how Tony Stark made his first circuit board when he was five years old. I was four. But I wasn’t the son of a billionaire, so I went unnoticed. Funny, isn’t it? A genius is only interesting if they’re rich. Or can be exploited.”
They chatted for a few more minutes, before sitting on the roof in New York in January became too much for Tony. When he returned to the apartment, Steve looked up and announced, “I didn’t puke.”
Rhodey studied him. Steve fought the urge to fidget, his skin crawling under Rhodey’s scrutiny, clenching his fists and standing tall.
Castello Malvagio sat perched on the edge of a cliff in the Palisades, the lights glittering in the fading light, and on any other night, Tony probably would’ve thought it looked beautiful. But tonight, three days since his fight with Steve, three days where he’d heard nothing from his boyfriend - or should it be ex-boyfriend? - Tony was far from the right frame of mind to appreciate the beauty of a recreation of an Italian castle in the Palisades. Not when he was making a journey he was supposed to make with Steve.
He fished for the door handle, drawing his eyes away from the books and climbed out of the car, forcing what he hoped was a smile for Tony, before closing the door behind him. He watched Tony drive off, before staring down at the books again.
“Yeah, fake hotel,” Clint joined in. “Somebody built a ballroom and an empty shell and then blew it up with us inside it. You wanna know who’s behind it, I’m going to suggest you look to whoever built this place. Dream-whatever they’re called.”
Steve swallowed - or he tried to, but the lump in his throat made it impossible. He blinked away the tears that blurred his vision and pressed a kiss into Ellie’s hair.
“And these pants, Jesus Christ, are they a size too small or something?” Tony murmured. “They do amazing things for you. And make me want to do very, very bad things to you.”
Bruce bit back the urge to growl, running his hands through his hair even though Betty always used to tell him it made his hair stick up like a bird’s nest. Well. Even more than usual. Snatching up Jessica’s notes, he flicked through them yet again even though he’d already been through them a hundred times.
“Well,” he began. “I think the most important thing is figuring out how many pop quizzes I’m going to give my sophomores next year. And second, I need to finish the test for the first day back to see how many students completed the summer reading.” Steve smiled serenely, taking in the dismayed expressions of his students with no small amount of satisfaction.
“If the government or the military asks, no I did not,” Rhodey replied. “I’d rather not get thrown out of the Air Force.”
“I hope you’re hungry,” Tony continued, resuming stroking Steve’s hair. “Nat and Bruce are whipping up a veritable feast.”
Following Arno’s diagnosis with Tay-Sachs, Howard Stark withdrew from public life, working from the mansion and leaving the everyday running of his company to CFO Obadiah Stane. Arno Stark died in 1992, turning Howard into a recluse, living at home with his younger son, Tony.
But a shadow flickered over Tony’s eyes and instead of the usual barbed comeback or joke about the thinner air affecting Steve’s brains, he just nodded.
“Yes, you did,” Tony agreed. It might’ve been all in his head, but Steve thought Tony almost sounded proud.
“Now, in the meantime,” she continued, “Perhaps you could stop glaring quite so hard. If the wind changes direction you’ll be stuck like that, you know.”
“As I was saying, you’re going to regret this,” Alexander continued, pointing to the steadily forming bruise.
“Bruce Banner,” Steve said again, dropping his empty bowl onto the floor then opening a new tab. He typed the name into Google.
Something clawed at his throat; Tony coughed once, then twice, then a third time until he was wheezing for air. He opened his eyes, but his vision blurred. Squeezing his eyes shut again, he rubbed the corner of his eyes with his thumb and forefinger before opening his eyes again, blinking until his vision cleared and he saw Bucky leaning over him with a worried expression and dust smeared across his face.
Tony put on an extra burst of speed; now that the ship was in sight, he couldn’t wait any longer to get to Steve. His singular focus was getting to the Guiletta, which was arguably the problem. Because if he hadn’t been so focused on the ship and on Steve, Tony might’ve noticed the odd shimmer in the air to his right. He might’ve questioned it and trusted his gut and changed his path.
The next cage held a grey tabby who was rubbing up against the bars, blinking up at Tony with liquid green eyes.
Tony buried his head in his hands and tried in vain to calm his breathing. This was pointless, it wouldn’t work, the walls were closing in and he couldn’t breathe, oh God-
“Back at you,” he replied. “You’re a complete asshole and I am seriously regretting ever trying to help you right now, but you’re pretty cool, Barton. I just have one question I would really like the answer to before I die: how the fuck did you get in my vents?”
Tony watched her walk away, the blonde woman with a clipboard directing her down the stairs on the left. He caught sight of his reflection in a mirror opposite; he looked normal, a little sadder than usual perhaps, but normal. And yet, Tony couldn’t shake the feeling something was missing.
“First of all, you’ve been telling me to stop calling you that for twenty years,” Tony pointed out. “And second of all, I have a fiancé now.”
“You only help the people who agree with you,” Steve pointed out with a humourless smile. “If they’re lucky, the ones who disagree get nothing. And if they’re not lucky, you kill them.”
“Stark Industries is having the Meet the Heroes event today with some potential investors. But we can’t have a Meet the Heroes with no heroes.”
“I’m worried about Barton,” Tony admitted. “It’s been going on for a while now. He doesn’t seem like himself. You know about the dog, right?”
“Oh, I’d say I’m sorry to disappoint you,” Nefaria chuckled, wiping away a tear. “But I’m really not. It’s just so satisfying to see how
Steve frowned. His heart broke a little for Tony, looking so lonely. Yet again, he cursed Howard and Maria Stark for condemning Tony to this existence against his will.
“Yes,” Alexander smirked. “Dr. Danvers and I had a nice long chat about how we both know Tony. You know she worked at Mass General back then?” He chuckled. “That’s fortunate.”
“Then why would you want to stay here when we are outnumbered, outgunned and, if we hang around here for too long, outlived?”
Ellie looked up in surprise but when she spotted Tony, her face broke into a smile that almost broke Steve’s heart with how cute it was.
Judging by the way Tony’s face fell into a scowl, he’d failed. Tony pushed himself out of the water, reaching over and snatching the instructions from Steve’s hands. “Give me that.”
Clint nodded and continued filling in the admission paperwork for Wade Wilson. Sure enough, down the hall he could hear the voice of Dr Justin Hammer of the Urology department, no doubt terrorising any members of staff he found in Steve’s absence.
“Uh, no, I think I have pretty good timing,” Bucky retorted, picking up a half-empty container of Kuay Tiew. “Who knows what I woulda seen if I’d waited ten minutes.”
When he woke, Tony’s head felt fuzzy but at least he didn’t feel like he was about to throw up anymore. He opened his eyes slowly, feeling relief when he saw the sadly all too familiar sight of the Tower’s med bay. There was a hand holding his and when Tony managed to turn his head, he found Steve sitting by the bed, the hand not holding Tony’s scrolling through his phone.
“And since you’ve all decided we’re the parents, I guess that means we don’t have to ask for permission?” Steve grinned.
“And,” Steve continued, finding a second wind. “I was Tony Stark’s boyfriend for almost a year and they didn’t know. We could’ve kept our relationship hidden but why should we? Why should we have to hide? That’s not fair. It’s not right. For God’s sake, they should be embarrassed about being bigoted assholes. That’s wrong. Not this, not us. Loving someone isn’t wrong. And would you quit smiling at me?”
We don’t tell him about this,” she said, waving her finger between the two of them. “Because Clint is incapable of keeping a secret and if my dad finds out about us-”
He got to work, sticking the tube into an incision in the patient’s stomach and attaching it to a bag.
He lined himself up and pushed in slowly, watching enraptured as Tony’s head fell back, exposing his neck, and his chest heaved as he gulped for air. Steve placed soft kisses along his collar bone, pausing to allow Tony the chance to adjust until Tony groaned, “Move.”
“That’s the really good news. This condition is so rare that the university is willing to do the operation for free.”
Bruce studied him carefully. Just as Steve was about to give up and thank him for his time - or offer the blow job - Bruce said, “Okay.”
“Are you sure?” Steve asked, landing neatly on his feet. He grabbed his scrub shirt and pulled it over his head, ruffling his hair and increasing his innocent, boyish look, which was only belied by the mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “Because it’s
“So you would be in favour of going on an actual date? Not that this isn’t great, this is great, I just, I mean-“
“That’s not La Colombe,” he declared, pouring the coffee down the sink. Then he turned and studied Steve for just a second too long, just long enough for the hair on the back of Steve’s neck to stand up. “You’re right. The patients shouldn’t have to pay for your mistakes.”
He waved to Steve before pulling away from the curb, and revved the engine loudly, drawing the attention of anyone who wasn’t already looking at the bright red R8 sitting outside a Brooklyn high school.
“You have no idea.” Stane moved into the crowd and Steve watched it part like the Red Sea, his booming voice calling, “General! Good to see you.”
Five minutes later, he’d found a plastic stool, setting it up in the shower cubicle before helping Steve into the bathroom.
Stark turned and grinned at him. Scott also turned to look at Steve because what was with that tone? And now that he was looking at him, what was with that grin? And was that, were they
Sharon slipped out of the room to give them some privacy. Coming out was hard enough, without a stranger standing in the room. She crossed to the nurses’ station where she could keep an eye on them unobtrusively but there turned out to be no need. Peter hadn’t even stopped talking before May was pulling him into a hug, mindful of his cast, dragging Johnny in too.
“My family is from Sicily,” Nefaria began apropos of nothing. “I have noble blood running through my veins. And yet, my grandparents lost everything when the war ended. Our ancestral home, all the money, the antiquities which we have for centuries - all gone. There was nothing left. Penniless, homeless, my grandparents have to scrape just to feed their children.
“You don’t want to do something that you’ll regret. Something that makes you look foolish. Isn’t that right, Steve?” Alexander smiled.
. I decided I didn’t want that kind of life. So she marched down to the school, and told all my teachers on no uncertain terms were they to keep pushing me into a STEM school. She was this five foot nothing Irish woman you did
The relief in Bobbi’s voice was like a punch in the gut and Clint had to fight the urge to wrap his arms around her and hold her tight, promising everything would be okay. He couldn’t promise that and he couldn’t hold her, not anymore.
What if Steve didn’t want him here? What if this was too much? He was being annoying, no one should wake their boyfriend up at four in the morning. It was rude. This was wrong, he shouldn’t be here. He should just leave now before Steve saw him and told him to leave.
“You know what’s missing,” he muttered to himself and pulled out his phone. He opened the message chain with Steve and typed out
“Maybe,” Tony shrugged. “Or maybe I’m being a self-centred narcissist as usual, and making everything about me when it’s not.”
“Wanted your help with something,” Clint replied, studying the Mark IV in its case on the far side of the workshop.
He should’ve known. He should’ve known it was too much for Steve. Steve was good, just like Pepper. And just like Pepper, he was bound to realise that Tony would not and could not give up Iron Man. He was bound to realise that Tony didn’t want to give up the suit for anything, not even for the people he loved.
“No, science project,” Steve replied. “She’s doing geothermal energy, so I thought the girls might as well come over and give Peg and Dan a break.”
“Porphyria,” Dr. Romanoff explained. “It’s a genetic condition, due to a mutation in the genes which make heme. It’s manageable and we’re going to refer you to a specialist.”
And he did. He would always love both Peggy and Daniel. Over time it had mellowed from the passion he’d once felt into the warmth of friendship, but that didn’t mean it burned any weaker than it once had. It just changed. Because they weren’t meant to be.
“Hey you,” Tony greeted, circling the island and leaning up to press a kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth.
Tony left Steve and Evie Rose at the table, rejoining the queue to buy a new bowl of ice cream. As he handed over the cash to the cashier, the woman behind him asked, “Aren’t you Tony Stark?”
And that’s when it clicked in Steve’s brain what was happening here. This wasn’t just a friendly bitch between co-workers.
“Yes, a new drug trial,” Arnie said, his eyes twinkling with mischief that used to predate them getting into trouble that Bucky would usually had to get them out of. “I was put forward for it before but they ran out of funding so I wasn’t part of it. Then a few weeks ago, not long after you first came to see me, I got a call to say they’d received some more funding and there was a place for me if I wanted it.”
Steve risked a glance at the woman who’d joined them. So this was Pepper Potts: CEO of Stark Industries and Tony’s ex, the one it took him a whole year to get over.
Steve loved halloween. He always had, ever since he and Peggy were kids. They used to make their own halloween parties, just the two of them and Peggy’s brother Michael, making their own costumes and bobbing for apples in Steve’s kitchen until they were soaked and laughing and had a pile of apples with bite marks in the skin. Now, as adults, they’d made it their mission to imbue Peggy’s kids with the same passion for the holiday.
“They think I should tell my husband that I'm flirting with you,” Steve interrupted. “That it’s unfair of me to flirt behind his back.”
Tony hurried towards Bucky, passing MJ off to him as he stepped back so Tony could take his place. Tony crouched down and sure enough, it was Nick Fury was lying on the ground.
“I like flowers,” Steve yelled, and why was he going in this direction? This wasn’t the point. “Sunflowers,” he added.
So he packed up his few measly possessions and Ellie and started working on accepting the fact that he was going to live in Manhattan.
Steve grinned and followed Tony onto the dance floor. When they managed to find a spot on the floor Tony released his hand, slipping his arm around Steve’s waist instead and pulling him in close. Steve grinned, holding onto Tony’s elbow as they began to move in time to the music. Between the dancing and press of bodies around them, it didn’t take long for sweat to begin running down his back, soaking his shirt to his skin. Tony’s hand felt like a brand through the thin fabric.
“Done,” he announced, collapsing onto the floor. The cold leached through his t-shirt, a welcome relief after covering most of the estate in the growing summer heat. His stomach grumbled loudly; Steve sat up with a groan, reaching for his backpack and pulling out the leftover pizza he’d stuffed into a box before leaving that morning.
“Got it,” Maria nodded. She jogged towards the fire crew. “Hey! We’re gonna need you guys to make a mini body board to fit in there. Get me blankets from the ambulance; normal blocks won’t fit so we’re gonna improvise some blocks to steady her head. And someone call the hospital and get Carol Danvers on standby, do you understand people?”
When their eyes met again, Tony saw the same fear and relief in Steve’s eyes as his own. The knowledge of how close they came to losing this, losing each other, was like a sharp pain to the chest which hurt far more than the wound to his arm. His heart pounding, Tony leaned down, capturing Steve’s lips in a bruising kiss, trying to pour everything he didn’t have the words for into it and feeling tears prick the corner of his eyes when Steve responded in kind.
Tony reached out, cupping the back of Steve’s neck and leaning forward to press his lips to his temple. That realisation was something that had haunted his dreams for the past two months.
“Thinking about filing my retirement papers,” he admitted and Steve’s face lit up. “I just… Why wait? We both want this, right?”
“Hannah, don’t you know you’re supposed to invite people in before stealing their phones?” Daniel teased, emerging from the kitchen.
Tony leaned forward, carefully removing the necklace from the box, Ellie’s eyes following the necklace the entire time, before unclipping the clasp and putting the necklace around her neck.
Looking back at Stane, Steve realised Stane was purposely staying far enough away from the edge of the pool that Tony couldn’t reach him. How could he get Stane to move closer to the water? There had to be a way, there
Tony’s eyes followed the movement, sending a prickle of lust down Steve’s spine. It would be so easy, so very easy to lean forward and kiss Tony. He swallowed, picking up his tea and taking a long drink, which turned out to be a very bad idea, because now Tony was staring at his throat, and was it just him, or was it hot in here?
“Yes.” Edwards squirmed uncomfortably in her seat. Silently, she picked up a folded newspaper and handed it to Steve.
She lifted the flashlight, checking both pupils and confirming her suspicion. God, this was too good. Natasha schooled her features, dropping the flashlight back into her pocket.
It had barely started when a knock on the door echoed through the apartment. Tony frowned and glanced at his watch. Night shift had started and everyone he was friends with was working tonight. Except…
Before his thoughts could head down that particularly delightful track, flashing lights caught his eye and he spotted a truck and an ambulance by the side of the road. Tony tapped the brakes, leaning into the curve as he pulled the bike off of the road and skidded to a halt in a burst of dust.
He looked scared, Steve realised. The big, bad… whatever Tony was, he was scared. Of Steve. It wasn’t a good realisation.
They lapsed into silence, grinning stupidly at each other, until Tony shook himself and said, “So coffee.”
They headed across the parking lot to the sidewalk, heading down the block to their favourite diner. As Scott held the door open for Hope and Clint, he heard the roar of an engine. Glancing over his shoulder, he saw a motorcycle with two riders shooting off into the sunrise.
“Steve, we need to get your temperature down,” Tony pointed out, silently begging Steve to agree because he felt like the worst kind of person imaginable pulling the blankets away from him.
“Because we’ve only been together for a month,” Sharon explained and dammit, she could feel tears building. She was only barely pregnant and already she hated the hormones. She could not spend the next eight months crying. It would completely ruin her reputation. “And I’m having a baby. Because I am. Having it. And I can’t ask you to commit to this after a month.”
“Yeah,” he admitted. “But don’t worry, Clint has a plan. And if anyone tries to make you leave before he gets back, just fake being sick and hide in the restroom for a while, okay?”
He pressed his palm against the glass, the cold leaching into his palm, but it was impossible to see anything through the layer of scum.
“Now, the last time I saw them, they were… right… ah, here!” Steve finished, spotting the boxes on the top shelf. “How many do we need?”
Ellie fell asleep in her car seat on the journey out of the city, her tiny snores filling the silence and bringing a smile to Steve’s face.
“He’s a vet and I think he might be homeless,” Tony continued, because if he didn’t he was going to reach down the phone line and throttle Wilson. “Is there anywhere you can think of that he might be?”
He flipped his French toast onto a plate and drizzled syrup over the tower of toast before sitting at the table, and staring out over the city.
“Thirty minutes,” Tony replied, then Steve felt his lips on his cheek then the bed shifted as Tony stood up.
“On disciplinary action, no less,” Hank continued. “Can’t be all that if they sent him home in the middle of a war.”
“You didn’t need to call in sick,” Tony replied awkwardly. “I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself.”
“Thanks, kid,” Steve sighed, wondering if this was the same girl who, not a year ago, spent the entire afternoon bigging him up to Tony.
As soon as the elevator doors opened, the scent of food hit Tony’s nostrils and made his stomach grumble. The chatter of voices bounced off of the wall and Tony tugged Steve out of the elevator and down the hall.
Tony frowned. “I don’t understand. How can it be from then if you only had the idea a few weeks ago?”
“I like her,” Tony told Steve. Zoey sidled up to Steve, offering him her bowl of chips. Steve took a handful and threw her a wink. Zoey bit back a smirk, poking him in the side. Steve poked her back and they started a brief tickle war.
He began to move, Steve following his lead, and looked up into Steve’s blue eyes. In some ways it was exactly like the last time they danced to this song, and yet it was also a world away. Last time, Tony was afraid to hope that Steve still wanted to be him. Now, they were engaged.
Bruce frowned, running his finger over the edge of the page and set his jaw. There had to be something he could do.
He pulled Steve down, pushing his cock further into him, while twisting his hand on Steve’s dick. Steve went rigid in his arms, letting out little whines in Tony’s ear as his dick pulsed between them.
“Come on, asshole,” Bucky declared, none-too-gently hauling Nefaria out of the jet. “I know a lotta people who’re gonna be really interested in talking to you.”
But one remained: the image of pushing a ring onto someone’s finger. Only this time, instead of slim pale fingers with French polish, he pictured Tony’s hands and lost the ability to breathe for a good minute.
“Obviously, it’s not the exact same ones,” Tony was saying. “But they are first editions. Do you like them?”
Crossing to his bed, Steve lay down, enjoying the feeling of Tony’s eyes on him. Only once he fell still did Tony move, covering the distance to the bed in two long strides. Kneeling on the mattress, Tony shuffled forward until he was looming over Steve, and Steve felt a thrill run through him from head to toe, his toes curling in his flip flops as a slow smile spread across his face. He spread his legs, nudging Tony’s thighs with his knees until Tony took the hint and shifted between Steve’s legs.
, that felt good, the way Tony’s hips stuttered against him. Tony let out a low whine in the back of his throat, biting down on Steve’s shoulder.
“I’ve been looking for you,” Hammer continued. “I was wondering if I could buy you breakfast this morning.”
“Jesus Christ, Howard. Haven’t you ever heard of filing?” Steve growled. There were papers everywhere. Some of them were probably important - there were some that looked like bank statements and designs - but Steve ignored them all.
“You’re welcome,” she replied. “And congratulations,” she added, noticing the ring on Pepper’s finger.
“And he knows- knew? About you?” Steve pressed. “I mean, I can see your tail in this picture. So he knew the truth, right?”
“I’ll, uh, I’ll be right back,” Steve said, excusing himself from the table. “Be good, and don’t go anywhere,” he warned Evie Rose.
Today his thumb hesitated over the message box, but then he heard keys in the lock and scrambled to his feet, locking his phone and slipping it into his pocket as he turned to face the door. Rhodey stumbled in, coming to a halt when he saw Steve standing there. Steve gave an awkward little wave, and Rhodey’s eyes narrowed as suspicion coloured his expression.
Banner frowned, looking adorably confused in the way only baby residents could. Clint remembered those days distantly but fondly. “Why is that a problem?” Banner asked.
Steve swallowed. He looked so tense, Tony feared he was going to snap. Reaching out, he ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, drawing Steve’s attention. Steve watched him warily out of the corner of his eye.
“None of them are that crazy,” Tony muttered. He paused. “Although remind me to look up Sunset Bain when we get out of here.”
“On April 13th 2015, hundreds of people gathered at Castello Malvagio in New Jersey, believing that they were attending the opening gala of an exciting new venture unlike anything ever seen before: a casino whose profits would go to charitable causes, helping those who need help most in our society. An honourable endeavour, no doubt.
Tony glared at them, but then Marci fixed him with a warning look, and Tony obediently pulled out his phone and downloaded the Make-a-Match app, grimacing at the cutesy icon of two vaguely androgynous cartoon figures gazed adoringly at each other with a single heart above their heads.
Steve chuckled. He hauled himself to his feet with a groan. “That’s more excitement than I wanted this morning.” He picked up his t-shirt and boots, carrying them outside to let them dry off in the sun. If he was lucky, his boots would be at least partially dry by the time he had to leave.
“My grandparents had first editions of all four books, but my mom had to sell them when I was a kid,” he explained.
His words died on his lips as his eyes fell on the edge of the pool and the… man glaring at him, his teeth bared and a knife in his hand. A knife with Steve’s blood on it. But Steve was too busy staring at the man’s neck. Because there were gills on it.
A good point. Angie worked late on Thursdays, already working on the Christmas show, which translated as battling with the teachers who’d been at the school since Steve and Angie were teenagers in an attempt to convince them to put on a more modern production.
Guilt lingered in his gut, although Steve wasn’t sure what he was supposed to feel guilty about. Poor hygiene, he supposed. Not taking care of himself. Steve scrubbed a hand through his hair, wincing again.
Tony started, then blinked at him, his mouth hanging open. Steve coloured, realising what he’d said, and squeezed his eyes shut, sliding down the sofa.
Tony thought he knew a lot about loyalty to your boss - Pepper was a shining example after all, sticking by him through everything - but Julie Wilson took loyalty to a whole new level. If she knew what was going on, she was telling them nothing. Eventually Bucky had to drag Tony to the other end of the room to get him to cool down as his fear for Steve threatened to overwhelm him.
“Wow, that’s a look,” Daniel said, joining Steve to watch an apple bobbing contest Tony and Zoey were dominating. “You two are getting serious, aren’t you?”
“Alright,” Tony murmured, turning his face back into Bucky’s neck and taking advantage of the fact that Bucky always ran hot.
With that, he fired both palm repulsors in opposite directions before shooting forward into the Dreadnoughts directly in front of him. It was like flicking a switch; the Dreadnoughts launched towards him and Tony found himself being tossed between them, trying to get a shot in wherever he could. But the odds of thirty five against one were… well, they weren’t great. Tony could admit that. He did what he could and kept one eye on the little red dot on the map at the bottom corner of his HUD, sneaking its way towards him.
Sweat dripped down Tony’s forehead as he fucked into Steve with a single-minded focus, setting a relentless pace. Steve’s hands began to slip on his thighs; Tony lifted Steve’s knees over his shoulders, taking his hands and pinning them to the bed, their fingers entwining automatically.
The cafe was a few blocks away from the Tower. Steve had grabbed coffee there a few times on his way back to Brooklyn, even getting breakfast occasionally, and he’d killed time there before meeting Tony on several occasions during the summer by taking advantage of their outdoor seating to sketch the Tower as he drank iced tea. But he knew that despite the proximity, none of the Avengers frequented the cafe, preferring the coffee cart opposite the entrance instead.
But Steve’s face fell, remembering what Arnie told him about the cancer. His mouth twisted and he ducked his head, hoping to hide it from Tony.
“Good, ah!” Steve gasped, as Tony sucked on his neck, pulling his skin between his teeth and worrying it gently, the rasp of his beard drawing goosebumps on Steve’s skin. “Good,” Steve panted. “That’s, that’s good.”
“What’s up, gorgeous?” Tony asked, pulling off his sunglasses and dropping them into his jacket pocket. Ellie reached for his hand and Tony gave it to her instantly. Ellie turned with a determined look on his face and pulled Tony off across the grass. “Apparently we’re going this way,” Tony called over his shoulder. “Okay, beautiful, where are we going?”
A low hum filled Tony’s ears and a blast of air hit them both, then an all too familiar voice called, “Need a ride?”
He moved slowly into the room. If Howard’s grotto in the basement was chaos, this was the opposite. It was almost fanatically neat; with one glance, Steve could tell that there was a place for everything and everything was in its place. He could also tell that this room hadn’t been touched since the Starks left the house on the day of their death.
Tony groaned, flopping onto his back. “You give him an orgasm, and still he’s not happy.” He sighed dramatically. “I am but your humble servant, Steven. I live to serve. I should wear pants if I’m going to cook, right?”
“I don’t know him as well as you do,” Steve admitted, “But he didn’t seem like Clint. He’s not the guy who took you to Chuck-E-Cheese on your birthday.”
Tony and Clint exchanged a look of solidarity then Tony braced himself, refusing to give in just like he’d refused to give in to the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, like he refused to give in to The Mandarin and Killian, like he refused to give in to Nefaria when he had Steve.
“Are you sure?” Tony smirked, tossing an apple in the air and catching it expertly. “It feels like I’m helping.”
Steve froze, before spinning towards the screen. He elbowed his way through the throng until he could see the screen and his heart stopped.
Steve jumped in surprise, which elicited a burst of laughter from Ellie. But Steve was too busy gaping up at Arnie, who smirked at him with a twinkle in his eyes.
Tony slowed the bike as he turned into their street. With a jerk, the bike came to a halt and Steve scrambled off of it, using Tony’s shoulders for leverage. He didn’t want to be on that thing for a second longer than he had to.
Steve laughed into the kiss, his hand stroking Tony’s jaw softly, and Tony wondered if he wasn’t the only one feeling the atmosphere in the room.
“Excuse me, I would very much like to not look demented in my engagement announcement,” Tony retorted.
“It’s not surprising,” Tony shrugged. “It came out in ‘85, but it bombed and nearly bankrupted Disney, so it wasn’t released on VHS until ‘98, and you would’ve been… fifteen and too old for Disney movies.”
“He’s going to be okay,” he told her. “It’s not pneumonia. It’s a severe chest infection but a round of antibiotics should clear it up. He’s on an IV drip for the dehydration and he’s probably going to need to stay the night. But he’s gonna be okay.”
He glanced at the clock occasionally. The red numbers glared angrily, taunting him with every minute that passed. Steve just shifted further under the covers. He knew he should get up and get dressed, get ready to head up to the Stark Mansion as he had every day for the past week, but he just… didn’t. Couldn’t. No, he could; there was nothing stopping him from getting up. He just… didn’t.
“Where are the boxes of gloves?” Scott asked. “Dayshift keeps rearranging everything and I can’t find anything.”
There were times Hank thought he didn’t like Dr. Romanoff either, but then she would do something amazing, like bringing someone back from the brink of death or get the night shift in under budget, and he was forced to reassess. And his conclusion was that she clearly had some form of black magic, and not only because she was actually able to control the rabble which called itself the night shift.
“Got it,” Natasha nodded, helping them guide the gurney into an exam room. “Waiting for patients became too much so you decided to go looking for them?”
Climbing to his feet, he left the pump room and climbed the stairs back to ground level. “It won’t start,” he called across the room.
“He says like I didn’t see him eat a whole bag of Cheetos half an hour ago,” Bucky added. “Hey Stevie.”
“Ha ha, you’re hilarious,” Bucky retorted, poking at his eye and wincing. “Rumlow,” he nodded to one of the agents.
“I thought making Pepper CEO meant I didn’t have to deal with business anymore,” Tony mused. “Guess I was wrong.” He stole one more kiss before straightening up and crossing the room to collect his jacket.
“Alright kids, this has been fun, but I think we’re going to call it a night,” Tony announced. “Barton, you’re on dish duty tonight, aren’t you?”
Tony stepped close, hooking a finger into Steve’s t-shirt and pulling him in for a kiss. Steve’s breath hitched; the kiss was slow and full of heat, a lingering promise for later that left him shivering in the very best way.
“I hear you, big guy,” Tony coughed, taking Bucky’s flesh hand and hauling himself up until he was sitting upright. His head swam, his vision blurring again, before settling down. “What happened?”
It was a relief to know that the Avengers were all onboard with Steve moving in. Not that Tony wanted or needed their permission, but it felt good to have the support of his friends behind him.
“Sorry,” Steve apologised, shifting onto a hand against the mattress instead. Hope and wonder lit up his eyes. Hi beautiful blue eyes. Tony didn't know what it was, but after an orgasm he always felt the urge to wax lyrical about Steve's eyes. “Tony, what are you saying?” Steve asked, pulling him back to the present.
“It’s not your money,” Steve retorted and hung up, feeling a sudden longing for his Nan’s old kitchen phone, which was immensely satisfying to slam down on someone when you hung up. Then he called Marci and invited her over when he knew Tony had a meeting with R&D the following afternoon.
Why had he thought it was a bad idea to include Tony in this? Clearly it was an excellent idea and Steve should’ve involved him sooner.
The wind whipped past his ears and Tony could see the city in the distance as he gunned his motorbike. At least Dr. Romanoff sounded happy about his early return to the States when he called and told her he could start tonight instead of in three weeks when his unit was scheduled to return. Considering the circumstances, she was the only one.
Tony frowned at him, aware that the rest of the table was also watching Steve with various levels of confusion. Even Lucky’d stopped snuffling at the final piece of pizza.
“Thanks buddy. Start It Takes Two Protocol. Then make sure that the jet’s ready for them when they get back to the Tower, yeah? And uh, load it up with both Steve’s location and the AIS for the Guiletta. And tell Barnes he better get my boyfriend back.”
They clutched at each other, paddling to stay afloat, then Tony cupped the back of Steve’s head and kissed him. When the need for air became too much, he broke the embrace, pressing their foreheads together instead.
Tony whined and then he came, spilling over his hand as he gulped for breath. It was so intoxicating, Steve’s breath caught.
Yeah, okay, Natasha was maybe, kind of, a little pissed off by Sharon’s continued refusal to talk about their relationship at work. Or be seen together in public. Or to even acknowledge they had a relationship.
Gary rolled up his sleeve and held out his arm. Clint stepped forward, peering at the outline of a man’s face. Clearly it was supposed to be recognisable, but he had no idea who it was supposed to be.
“I definitely do,” Tony nodded. “But I’d hate you less if you got a round in,” he added, lifting his near-empty glass.
“Except for the fact that I’m fourteen years older than you,” Tony pointed out, patting Steve’s shoulder.
“That’s cool,” Steve murmured, taking a picture of the tiles surrounding the bath, mosaics depicting mermaids perched on rocks as the waves rolled onto the beach. The whole room was painted in blue, with seashells sitting on the window ledge.
“Yeah,” Tony nodded. He stole a carton of Chinese, before throwing himself into the spare seat between Thor and Clint. “You hissed at me like a cat the other day. I thought it was fitting. She’s a rescue cat, she’s chipped, and has all her injections. Oh, and she’s neutered, so we don’t end up with any extra little cats running around the tower. As awesome as that would be. I have a boyfriend who is allergic to cats, so I have to control the fur if I ever want him to spend the night again.”
Steve watched them as he ate; Tony, joining in with the conversation as though he didn’t have Steve’s infant pup on his lap, and Ellie, watching them all with wide eyes as she attempted to shove her whole hand in her mouth.
It wasn’t until after he’d finished eating and picked up the skimmer to remove any new debris blown into the pool that Steve realised that eating and joking with Tony had lifted him out of his funk. Not completely, but he felt better than he did before. Steve paused, glancing curiously over his shoulder at the mer.
Steve ducked his head in embarrassment. When he glanced up, Tony was smiling at him. Steve smiled back.
They dissolved into what felt like natural conversation, flowing easily and interspersed with plenty of teasing, and Steve felt himself relax.
“There’s no maybe about it,” he insisted. “We were dancing. It’s a club. I hadn’t even had a drink at that point.”
“So you two don’t want dinner then?” Peggy called over her shoulder by the stove. “Looks like it’s just us girls then, Angie.”
“It looks like a mild bacterial infection,” Bruce continued. “And considering the state of this water, you got off easily.”
Feeling Tony’s eyes on him, Steve turned. Sure enough, Tony’s mismatched eyes were watching him carefully. Defeat settled in Steve’s bones.
“You are not crazy,” he insisted. “All the symptoms, including the psychosis, are related to your porphyria. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything you’ve been through.”
Maybe this was the right time to tell Steve how he felt? Wrapped up and warm in Steve’s bedroom, where it felt like nothing else existed. It was just the two of them, and Angie would’ve already left for work, which meant they could have loud, celebratory
Sharon nodded, wrapping her arms around her girlfriend - her girlfriend! Natasha was still her girlfriend - and buried her face in Natasha’s neck. “Yeah. That sounds good.”
Tony turned and spotted Clint in the next bed, hooked up to the same type of IV as he was himself and with a swollen black eye.
Tony shook his head, placing a trail of tiny kisses along his jawline, before looking up at Steve with almost revent eyes. “No way, baby. It’s been five months.”
Ellie latched on quickly, instantly settling down as she began to feed, and Steve watched her, feeling so much love that he thought his heart might burst.
The problem was, Steve mused as he waited for Tony to arrive at Nerd Be Cool on Tuesday afternoon, he didn’t know what the problem was himself. It was related to the books, he knew that. He just didn’t know why. Why Tony giving him the books bothered him so much. He couldn’t look at them, could barely stand to have them in his room, which was crazy.
“I don’t have any family. My dad left when I was a kid. He’s no loss. Then my mom...” Steve trailed off. He swallowed. “It’s just me.”
“Yeah. The rest of the team - and Happy - might need lawyers, can you get on that? And I need you to trace Steve’s watch. I need to find him.”
All eyes were on Steve as he walked to the stand. Steve tried not to fidget, but having all the attention on him like that made his skin crawl. It was like walking into school since coming out as Tony’s boyfriend but a hundred times worse because these people wanted to see him fail or fall apart. They didn’t care.
“No?” he said. “Nothing?” He shook his head, grabbing his jacket from the couch. “Alright, whatever. When you decide to tell me what this is really about, Steve, give me a call.”
“I need to be quick, I have another class,” Steve interrupted, keeping his voice low and eyeing the students leaving the room who were making no attempt to hide their curious glances. “I’m basically being fired.”
Dr. Stark laughed. “Oh, it’s not easy. It’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do. You’ll hate it and you’ll wanna quit because it’s so easy to take that hit instead. And even afterwards, some days are still hard. But I’ve been sober for eight years now. And I’m pretty sure you can do it too.” He stood up and shrugged. “Just food for thought.”
But he couldn’t deny that he’d wanted it, which was why it hurt even more when he woke up and discovered that he had a pup but no one to share this with.
“You come out on top in this ranking of Tony’s past relationships,” Angie added, without looking up from her phone.
“Don’t be mean to the man who’s trying to cure you. Okay, you can put your shirt back on. Never I thought I’d be saying that to you,” he added. “I’m gonna get you a scan. I don’t know what it is but I don’t like the look of it.”
Steve stood in the middle of the living area of his new Stark Tower apartment with Ellie against his chest, taking in the space that was big enough to fit the whole apartment he’d grown up in.
And after thirteen years together, Tony knew all of the sensitive spots to touch and kiss to get Steve wound up and gasping.
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Tony declared in mock-offence. “You try to make sure he’s comfortable-” He reached up, biting Steve’s neck then laving the skin with his tongue, “-and he laughs at you.”
“Yes? No?” he murmured, his breath raising goosebumps on Steve’s skin. He’d kissed Steve’s nipple the last time they had sex, but tonight he had plans, but only if Steve was onboard.
It turned out that Tony was amazing at sucking cock, and it wasn’t long before Steve was panting wordlessly, sweat rolling down his forehead, the sensations threatening to overwhelm him. Then Tony’s lubed fingers nudged at his hole, and watching flew out of the window.
The asshole blocked his punch while delivering a swift blow to the diaphragm. Steve gasped as he fell, barely managing to break his fall before his face hit the ground. He saw the asshole’s foot rise and braced himself for the kick, but then the asshole was gone with a high-pitched squeak.
“Huh?” Tony tilted his head in confusion, and that really shouldn’t look as cute as it did, Steve thought.
“Okay. I’ll take a look,” Steve said, climbing to his feet. His scar twinged with the movement; the skin was healing, but it still pulled sometimes when he moved. And the rest of the time it itched constantly. It was driving him mad.
He littered Steve with kisses as he jerked him off, kissing his shoulder, his collarbone, his neck, his eyebrows, even his nose which made Steve chuckle and Tony grin.
There was no Tony perched by the pool when they reached the top of the steps today. Steve took the lead, sliding open the patio door and letting Bruce in.
Sharon noticed May Parker watching Johnny with a small frown. Then she stepped forward, squaring her shoulders, and Sharon saw Johnny visibly steel himself. To his credit, he didn’t shy away, although his jaw looked tense enough to snap.
Steve rolled his eyes but secretly he loved how easily Tony seemed to accept Ellie. Bruce looked a little uneasy, in the way that alphas usually looked uneasy around pups, compounded no doubt by his fear of what the Hulk could do to her.
“Only a small range,” she replied apologetically. “But we can order more, or there is a jeweller we work with who does commissions, depending on your budget.”
Stane’s footsteps echoed heavily in the silence, punctuated only by Steve’s harsh breathing, his boots crunching on the broken tile and grit. Steve raised his head, determined to remain defiant even in defeat.
Steve was warm and comfortable, but someone was shaking his shoulder, dragging him into reluctant consciousness.
He was the first to arrive; not surprising, since Bucky was always running late. In fairness, Bucky did say
Steve nodded, a tiny thrill at the thought of seeing Tony with a child, their child, in his arms one day. “Good to know.”
“Barton took me to Chuck-E-Cheese since it’s my birthday,” Tony explained. “He paid for the Ultimate Party package and everything.”
“Oh, I think it might be. I think having a billionaire in the family could be very beneficial, don’t you?”
“Shortness of breath, possible fever and dehydration,” Tony reported and Bucky relayed the information to the dispatcher. Tapping his hand against Fury’s cheek, Tony murmured, “Come on, Nick. Don’t make me break that little girl’s heart, you bastard.”
“His name is on everything at work,” Rhodey shrugged. “Are you sure Stark isn’t involved? I don’t know, secretly?”
“You’re being weirder than usual,” Steve announced, stepping over Hope’s feet to get to his locker. “But I’m beat, so I don’t give a shit.”
“Fair enough,” Tony laughed. He ran his hand back and forth over Steve’s collarbone as though he was never planning on letting go. Steve was surprisingly okay with that. “I have no idea how we’re going to do this,” Tony admitted.
Steve frowned. Alexander was looking at him curiously, his face far too relaxed for anything good. Suspicion began to prickle along his spine.
Steve raised his phone to his ear and Clint couldn’t look away. It was like a trainwreck waiting to happen.
But when he tried to turn the handle, nothing happened. Steve frowned. He tried it again but the handle didn’t move. He could feel his heart rate picking up, a cold flush washing over him.
Nefaria began to chuckle, building up to a full laugh, but there was little humour in it. In fact, it was the wrong side of disconcerting, and Tony pulled Steve closer just in case.
“I will draw up a contract and get in touch with your father’s lawyers,” Marci said. “And oh my God, I can’t believe who he has as lawyers. It’s going to be so easy to get them to do what we want. I doubt they’ve ever seen the inside of a courtroom. Once I have everything arranged, we can arrange a meeting to get it signed and then you’re free.”
Steve hummed, Reluctantly, he unfolded himself from Tony’s lap, sliding out of the limo and biding Happy a good night. Tony remained pressed to his side as Steve unlocked the building and again when he unlocked the apartment, his hand slipping underneath Steve’s blazer to rub small circles in the skin of his back.
“Erik, her father, he’s on a training exercise,” Charles stammered. “I, I called him but it, uh, it’ll take him a few hours to get back.” He swallowed. “Her mother is deployed.”
Tony padded through the apartment and opened the front door, but instead of the pregnant blonde he expected to see, it was a teenage girl.
“Yeah, she is,” Tony nodded. He pressed his forehead into Steve’s chest and breathed him in. He was so tired. He wanted to sleep.
Tony leaned down slowly. Anticipation curled in Steve’s stomach as he came close, his hand coming up automatically to Tony’s shoulder as warm breath flickered over his lips before Tony kissed him. Steve’s breath caught, letting Tony push him into the mattress, holding him close despite his teasing.
Leaning against the counter, Steve twisted his wedding ring back and forth, using the familiar feel of the gold ring to ground himself. He hated this feeling, like he'd been knocked of balance and left discombobulated, that followed a panic attack. He hated it more than anything in the world.
“Hey, you’re on Make-a-Match, aren’t you?” Angie asked, after she’d knocked back her double espresso in one gulp.
. Jumping to his feet, Steve began to pace back and forth. “You bought me those books,” he repeated.
But today, pressed against Tony’s back - feeling the very real, very solid proof of his husband’s presence beneath his hands as they splayed across Tony’s stomach - as they dodged between the early morning traffic, cutting Steve’s usual commute in half; today, Steve liked the motorbike. Or at the very least, was willing to tolerate it if it meant reducing the time between leaving the ER and getting naked.
Steve fell asleep against his chest, his arms going slack around the same time he started snoring quietly. Tony pressed his cheek to Steve’s hair, holding him close. Eventually Angie unfolded herself from the armchair, stretching her arms above her head and turning off the TV.
“Thanks, but I’m going to have an early night,” Steve replied. “I have to get up early tomorrow morning.”
Steve scooted backward, feeling the covers bunch underneath his back, and Tony crawled onto the bed and straddled his waist.
when his cell phone began to ring, vibrating against the bedside cabinet. Steve reached out blindly and swiped answer without tearing his eyes from Moira’s antics.
“Ah, fuck you. Nat, you and Clint load up those files. I want you working on that code. Anything you need for help, you got it. Let’s go people,” he called, clapping his hands. Turning to Tony, he added, “When we get back, I’m sending all the tech to you.”
“Okay,” Tony whispered, leaning against the curve of Steve’s shoulder and letting it go. “Okay, honey.”
Natasha swallowed painfully around the lump in her throat and ducked into the break room, relieved to find it empty. She pulled out her phone and called Sharon, realising too late that it was after one in the morning and Sharon might be asleep.
Stane gave a final, shark-like smile, then Steve and Sharon turned towards the door and walked away as quickly as they could without raising suspicions. They forewent the elevators in favour of the stairs, Sharon’s heels clacking on the glass steps as they hurried towards the ground floor.
“Clint Barton is one of the best spies in the world,” Coulson said eventually. “Second only to Natasha. If he didn’t want you to know what’s going on in his head, you’d never have a clue. He could be sitting right next to you, smiling and laughing, while slipping something in your food without you realising.”
“Barton, I’ve told you before and I’ve told you again, stop drinking out of the pot. That’s not sanitary, and as a doctor you should know that,” Natasha continued. “Second of all, I need all the paperwork for the drug company study. Hank is trying to fund an extra position for the day shift so he’s breathing down my neck, which means until I get that paperwork, I’m going to be breathing down your necks. And if we don’t get this done in time and day shift doesn’t get that extra position, then you’re going to have Coulson breathing down your neck. And take it from Dr. Barton, you do not want that.”
The doctor raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, because people who have clearly been crying are notorious for living their best lives,” he said dryly.
, I finished my last exam. And I collapsed into bed and slept for eighteen hours. Bear in mind I’m a six hours a night guy tops. Eighteen hours later, I stumble into the kitchen and Rhodey hands me a mug of coffee, and I swear to baby Tesla, it was the greatest cup of coffee I’ve ever tasted.”
“It’s fetus in fetu,” Clint explained. “You were originally a twin, but your twin didn’t develop. But it stayed alive inside your body, in a tumour-like form.”
“Ari,” Tony nodded. “Hey, you’re scarily efficient; any chance you could get rid of the press so Steve and I don’t have to worry about them anymore?”
“No,” Romanoff replied, throwing Steve a wink. “But the little curls of smoke coming out of your ears are.”
Marci rolled her eyes as she sat back down, wrapping herself around Foggy’s arm. “He has a boyfriend. Which we found for him, Foggy-bear.”
“Yeah, well, you wanna help me, have something to eat,” Tony said, picking up his knife to slice off some more salmon strips. “Your stomach grumbling is doing my head in.”
Finally Romanoff raised her head from her paperwork, arching one perfectly plucked eyebrow at him with that damned unreadable expression of hers. “Have you met Dr. Stark?”
She shrugged, pulling a chair over to his desk and dropping down into it before unfolding the wrapper on her microwave burrito.
“Somewhere, there is an asshole with a metal arm laughing about karma right now,” Steve sighed, shaking his head.
Tony nodded, licking his lower lip slowly, and Steve couldn’t help stealing another kiss before turning back towards the VIP area. He felt something tug on the back of his jeans; a glance over his shoulder confirmed that Tony’s fingers were wrapped around his belt loop. Tony smirked at him.
“Don’t let it get around,” Fury warned. “Not even the Secretary of the World Security Council knows that.”
Steve had a love-hate relationship with clubbing. He loved the noise and the press of bodies, being close to people without ever actually needing to talk to them. He loved the thrum of the music, the pounding bass that reverberated through his bones. He loved losing himself in the music, all his cares slipping away under the flashing lights. It was easy to be the confident, charismatic person everyone expected him to be when he went clubbing.
“I mean, there’s the outside, right? We all saw it on the drive up, yeah? And then there’s the entrance and this ballroom and the kitchen, but that’s it.”
to be there with me. Instead, there was no obligation. He was there because he chose to be. Because he chose me.”
“Your job doesn’t define you, Steve. You’re still good with kids, you still want to help. I saw you telling Eli about college programmes earlier, and showing Riri how to work those repulsors. You’re still the same person, Steve, just in a different place.”
He found the First Aid kit in the bathroom cabinet, fishing out the thermometer before returning to the bedroom. Steve was bundled up underneath the covers, shaking and looking thoroughly miserable.
Tony pushed him beneath the overhang. Steve put one hand above his head to stop himself from floating up against the overhang, still clinging on to Tony with the other. Tony’s fingers were digging into his arm, but his head was lifted towards the surface.
“Yeah, well, neither do I,” Bucky retorted. “She can bring it on. I’ve been doing this since before all of you were born.”
Tony released him instantly, climbing to his feet to kick off his own pyjama pants. Gazing down at Steve, spread across the bed, his cock standing proud as he watched Tony through hooked eyes. A spike of lust jolted through him, and his breath caught in his throat.
“No,” Daniel shook his head. “Alright, never have I ever faked being sick to get out of work.” When Steve, Peggy and Tony all took a shot, Daniel released an exaggerated sigh. “I am so disappointed in all of you.”
“We have a problem with you flirting with Stark behind your husband’s back,” he explained. “It’s not fair, Steve. The guy deserves to know.”
“Yeah,” Steve hummed, He put the knife aside, carrying the onion on the chopping board over to him. “Or I could cash in one of my rain checks to celebrate instead?”
Steve considered his options for a moment, before deciding on, “Never have I ever broken up with someone by text.”
Steve would never tire of watching the way Tony’s face changed when he spoke about Jarvis, or about his friends, Rhodey and Bucky especially. It was so different from the face he wore in public or in the media. Softer, and older, which sounded like a bad thing, but it wasn’t.
“He is scarily efficient,” Tony realised as the doors closed behind Ari. “He might even give Pepper a run for her money."
Finally, he made it to the house, letting himself in and pulling off his sunglasses once in the shadows of the house.
While Steve retrieved the kit, Tony finished removing his clothes, and leaned up against the edge of the tub.
“Yeah, well, good luck,” Clint declared, clapping him on the shoulder. “The whole family’s a bunch of hypochondriacs. Her son, Loki, over there made my life a living hell one night because he was sure he had appendicitis. There was just one problem: he had his appendix out when he was five.”
The door swung open and his heart jumped to his throat. Steve dropped the hook but it was just Sharon. Before he could relax, though, he caught sight of her wide eyes.“Stane is back,” she hissed.
Steve fought the instinctive response to turn towards whoever was calling his name. It was made easier by the fact that he wasn’t sure who, exactly, was shouting for him.
Leaning up, Tony kissed the underside of Steve’s chin, before worrying the skin gently with his teeth until a bright red mark stood out against his skin. Steve groaned above him, tipping his head back to give Tony better access.
Once everyone else had piled out, either to go home or to go on clubbing, Steve and Tony were the only ones left.
Shaking his head at his own ridiculousness, Steve crossed the room, leaving footprints in the dusty carpet, and pushed open the door.
“I’m not done with you!” Turning back to Johnny, she added, “How could you be so irresponsible? You put him in danger. That is, that is beyond irresponsible! If you wanna risk your life on that deathtrap, that’s your choice, although God knows what your parents are thinking letting you run around on that thing-”
He ran his hand over Steve’s spine as he bent down to retrieve a pizza box from underneath the sofa, smiling as he reached his waistband.
“I don’t know,” Steve mused, pushing himself up onto one elbow and letting his eyes rake over Tony’s back and, more importantly, his ass. “Looks pretty perfect from where I’m at.”
“Yes, I did,” Angie replied, picking up her bag. “Tony, sit on him. He’s not allowed to leave the apartment. And I’m taking these-” Angie swiped Steve’s bike keys from the hook, “-just in case you were considering making an escape.”
“We settle out of court,” Tony suggested. “We both know we’re losing if we go to court. But he knows that if we do, he gets shown in a bad light. We offer him a one off payment in exchange for no further contact, in person or otherwise. Draw up a contract, make it all legal, so if he breaks the rules and comes back looking for more money we can get the police involved.”
“It would make my fucking day to hear something weird,” Bucky sighed, rubbing circles into Matt’s shoulder.
There was only one thing he hated more, more than macular degeneration and being an administrator and the board of directors all put together, and now that one thing was working in his ER.
A ripple of laughter ran through the crowd and Steve saw Rhodey and Sharon roll their eyes at each other. They weren’t the only ones; he noticed several eye rolls and huffs from various people throughout the crowd. His skin prickled. What was going on?
“Table,” Steve groaned, waving his hand vaguely in the direction of the bedside table, feeling a rush of relief when Tony made a noise of affirmation, shifting in the right direction, before returning to kiss Steve once more.
When he stepped out of the elevator onto the communal floor, Tony heard the sounds of the TV floating out of the media room. Following the strains of
“We spent one night together a year ago,” Steve retorted. “We’re not close. I didn’t even remember him until we were face to face.”
He kissed his way up the inside of Tony’s thigh, nosing at the crease of his hip before kissing the base of his cock.
“Thanks, Steve. I… I needed this,” Tony continued, rocking Ellie slowly. “I am having a really bad day. But she just made everything okay.”
Steve didn’t want a vacation. Which was why he hadn’t taken any vacation days in the past year, because what did he need a vacation for? Sitting around the apartment in his boxers, watching shitty TV shows which couldn’t even hold his interest and eating junk food? Yeah, no thank you. That left too much time, time for thinking and dwelling on things he… really did not want to be dwelling on.
“Yeah. I got kids who are involved with Stark Industries different social projects,” Steve explained. “And we dressed them up in Avengers merch and they spoke to the investors about the projects, and I had Angie there to talk about the benefits of One to One, and I contacted Dr. Helen Cho who’s been working with medical research team - she’s really interested in working more closely with you and Bruce, by the way - and it went really well. Fujikawa is already talking to Pepper about getting an exclusive partnership.”
It took a second for the clerk’s words to sink in for Steve. Then his face split into a grin, turning to kiss Tony breathless.
“I have a girlfriend,” Bruce interrupted. “I actually meant you could call me if you needed to talk about the whole
“No dice,” Steve replied, with one more kiss. “I love halloween But, uh, how about later we try and get me kicked out of heaven, how does that sound?”
Wriggling free, Tony kissed his way down Steve’s chest, pausing to tease a nipple, before finally reaching his waistband. Steve flicked off his flip flops, watching entranced as Tony pulled down his jeans and boxers in one go. Then Tony’s eyes travelled from head to toe, taking in every inch of Steve’s skin, and it was heady and intoxicating, and Steve had to bite his lip to stop himself from moving and breaking the moment.
Steve cocked his head, raising an eyebrow. He glanced around the room until he met Natasha’s eyes; she smiled and rolled her eyes. Steve chuckled.
He slammed the door on that train of thought and walked out of the room as quickly as he could without looking like he was running away. Which he wasn’t. Much.
do this. What other option was there? He couldn’t exactly call in a workman. For a start, he didn’t own the building, and then there was the minor detail of the mer in the pool. “It’s just a case of trial and error,” he added, hoping to bolster Tony’s confidence.
“We’re terrible examples, aren’t we?” Scott frowned. “Well, you’re worse than I am because you’re a doctor. I’m just a lowly nurse.”
“It doesn’t make a difference,” Hank pointed out. “They’re all alike. All certain they know best and that everyone else is insignificant next to their genius.”
He sat up, his fingers dancing down Steve’s chest as he unbuttoned his shirt with speed which left Steve impressed. He would never stop loving Tony’s hands, whether he watched them perform complicated surgery or coax Steve to completion in bed; Tony’s hands were a thing of wonder. Another time, when he wasn’t so desperate to have those fingers inside him, Steve would spend hours exploring them, feeling all the ridges and scars and hardened skin, pressing kisses to every finger to show how much he loved them and the man they were attached to.
Steve landed on the bed, smirking up at Tony as he lay back, his arms akimbo above his head. The image left Tony a little breathless. Resting one knee on the bed, he loomed over Steve, leaning forward to wind their fingers together.
Steve couldn’t help glancing at Nefaria; he looked unconcerned, leaning back in his chair in the dock, a small amused smile playing about his lips. As though he was in the audience at a particularly amusing play, rather than his own trial for kidnapping, terrorism, and attempted murder.
“Nothing,” Steve replied, but his typing faltered. “Tony and I left before anyone could say something they’d regret, Tony moved onto another department and I got a job at another hospital a few months later. That’s it.”
“Yeah, she’s pretty talented like that,” Steve agreed. “First time I saw her, I realised that I might be in the future, but everything was going to be okay. If I had her.”
“Yes, but I spend most of my time in here so you need a desk here too,” Tony nodded. “I work here so this is the place you need to be. Keep the other desk for all the stuff you want to ignore.”
“Mr Stark has requested I take you straight up to the penthouse,” JARVIS explained. “He’s finishing up a project in the lab but assures you he will be right there. Is this acceptable with you?”
“Nobody likes being sick,” Tony replied, taking a towel to Steve’s hair carefully, mindful of Steve’s lightheadedness.
Grabbing his empty mug, he made his way along the corridors, ignoring the stares coming from any stragglers who hadn’t made it downstairs to the cafeteria yet. A place where Steve would not be revisiting for quite some time after he went down for lunch on Monday and a reverent hush fell over the room. It creeped him out enough that for once he didn’t hesitate to go grocery shopping on the way home from work, so he could avoid the cafeteria for the rest of the week.
Drumming his fingers against the body of his guitar, Steve tired out a few different variations for the missing line.
Nefaria chuckled. “You’re cute. I can see why he likes you.” Nefaria ran his fingers down the edge of Steve’s face. Steve tried to jerk away, the cuffs rattling as they bit into his wrists.
When Steve turned towards Tony, he found him trying his best to remain serious but his eyes were full of mirth and his lips kept twitching upwards.
“Hey Laura, I’m Tony,” Stark smiled. “Listen, I know you’re scared and I know it hurts, but I’m gonna get you out of here. I promise. Okay? Don’t worry,” he winked. “I’ve got you. Can you move your fingers for me?” he asked, pressing his fingers to her throat to check for a pulse. “That’s it, that’s great. Good girl. Okay, I’ll be right back.”
Maybe Steve was on his way up here. It was possible, after all, since Steve’s watch gave him full access to the Tower.
“Yeah,” Tony sighed. He put his bowl aside and wrapped his arms around Steve’s shoulders, burying his face in his hair.
“Yes, it was,” Steve said. “I’ve been trying - failing - to deal with some stuff and I took it out on you.”
“I know,” Steve replied. He shifted onto his knees, crawling closer to the edge of the pool. “I know. Tony. I’m going to protect you. I promise. I will do whatever it takes to get you out of here and protect you. Whatever it takes.”
A spike of lust shot down Tony’s spine. He nodded, taking Steve’s hand and leading him back towards the bedroom.
“People from Peggy’s firm, Daniel’s precinct, there’s usually some folks from the DA’s office. And some of the other PTA parents,” Angie replied. “And if I am very, very lucky, one raven haired, badass detective.”
“I will call a team briefing, in an hour,” Tony said. “That gives Bucky time to get back from SHIELD, and you time to shower, and Clint time to remove that fluff from his face.”
“Julie Wilson. Assistant to the CEO,” Natasha announced, tossing Wilson onto the floor and earning herself a dirty look. “Thought you might be interested in having a chat with her.”
It didn’t help that heats were essentially a chance for alphas to prove that they could take care of an omega and be good providers, and everything Tony had done since Steve moved in was prove that he not only could provide for Steve and his pup, but did provide.
“No, I don’t trust him,” Tony agreed. “Do you know how close I was to just going home that day? God, Steve, I still have nightmares about what could’ve happened if I had. How long you could’ve been stuck in there. I… No. I don’t trust him. I will never trust him. Not after he locked you in that closet knowing you were claustrophobic.”
“Peggy. The teacher comes over and she’s furious because it turns out, Peggy rugby tackled this kid to the ground from behind. And when the teacher tries to tell her off, Peggy just turned around and snapped
“Uh, that’ll be my Aunt May,” Peter replied, glancing at Johnny nervously. “Her number’s in my phone.”
“Morning Justin!” Clint grinned, only to be ignored as usual. Hammer refused to speak to him, ever since the time Clint and Scott put shaving foam in his shoe. That was the best April Fools.
,” Steve reminded him. “So helping me is really helping yourself. So by not helping me, you’d only be hurting yourself.”
“That’s dangerous. She’ll be living off of a diet of pizza and adopting random dogs in no time if you let them spend much more time together.”
Tony hung up and put his phone back into his pocket as he hurried to catch up with MJ. He held open the door to the VA for her then they made their way towards the reception desk.
Tony lingered in his thoughts as he drove home, thinking about him and his obvious illness probably more than was safe while driving. Making his way up to the apartment, Steve tried to push him away, but the way Tony’s shoulders shook under the cough kept pushing its way into his mind’s eye. He pulled out his keys, but the apartment door swung open before he could get the key into the slot.
spelled out in colourful wooden letters on the door, but inside the roof was all but gone due to water damage. The floorboards creaked ominously when Steve cautiously put a foot into the room. He quickly withdrew, choosing instead to scan the room from the doorway. The water damage was so extensive there were even plants growing in the moisture-laden floorboards.
“So let me get this straight,” Tony said. “They build a fake hotel, publicise it as though it’s real, invite all of us to the opening and blow it up. Then they take Steve. They had all six - okay, five, the Hulk doesn’t count - Avengers knocked out, and they take my high school teacher boyfriend. Why?”
“No, it’s the same as last time,” Joseph replied, leaning forward and peering at Steve’s phone screen, watching him complete the transfer.
Tony raised his head, and his eyes were shining with tears. “Wish I knew what I’d done to make everyone hate me so much,” he whispered with a humourless smile.
“Anyway,” she continued, “Turns out the driver was off his head. Went on a binge then decided he was going to drive to Houston to see his ex.”
