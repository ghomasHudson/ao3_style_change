“So that is what this is all about,” Dean spat out, realisation dawning on him. “You don’t want a depressed brother bringing you down while you sail into the sunset with your new girlfriend. You’re finally free, except you’re worried that I will still try to drag you down…”
“His physical therapy is going well”, Sam told him after about ten days. “He can walk without crutches, now. Getting stronger every day.”
Dean drove him to the hospital in utter silence, Cas stoically staring ahead. Except from a sigh every now and then from Dean, they remained like that until Dean put Baby in park in the Hospital’s lot.
“No, Dean, I can’t. I’ve seen the way you looked at me the past two months. I never wanted to make you uncomfortable in any way, and uncomfortable is all you’ve been. I’ll
“It just clicked after that. It was so obvious to me, that I couldn’t believe it when I found out you two weren’t actually together.”
And then, just like that, he disappeared. Back to his dust, his particles, his droplets of vapour in the air. Dean didn’t know. He didn’t care.
“That’s us,” he growled, and winced out of pain. The doctor took a look at them, shook his head once and began to explain.
So, he would let the elephant in the room grow a couple more sizes. After all, they had been doing this dance for over a decade.
“Nope!” Dean exclaimed, all false cheer, immediately setting to task. He locked the door behind him. Then he opened his bag and took out a can of spray painter. Whistling like he didn’t have a single care in the world, he began to draw wards all over the walls.
Dean nodded and grunted, but deep down he was harbouring a resentment he didn’t have the words for. Cas was human again. How come every time Cas was human, he was barred from helping? Was this some sort of cosmic fuck off? But Chuck couldn’t hurt them anymore, now, could he? So why was it that life had to constantly kick him in the balls like this?
“Well… it seems to be talking about two people who have hurt each other, unintentionally. They fight and they leave. But, they always come back and make up with each other. They’re a team. It perfectly describes our friendship.”
When it ended, Jack quickly got to his feet, placing the bowl of popcorn on the coffee table before stretching. It looked exaggerated to Castiel.
Sam had double-checked the wards three days ago, so whatever was outside was obviously something they were trying to keep out.
Sam had finished prepping the coffee machine and cleaning up the mess. He was now getting his own breakfast together. Some kind of wheat thing that Dean would never touch with a ten-foot pole.
“Jack,” Sam took over, a bit more gently. “We just need you to tell us the truth. Why are you really here?”
His thoughts returned to earlier, when he was waiting for Sam to come out of the grocery store. He didn’t mean to eavesdrop but his powers gave him very good hearing.
They wasted no time settling into their respective seats and passing the food around. Sam and Eileen had brought a bottle of sparkling cider, which was opened and poured into everyone’s glasses.
“You got this, Jack,” he whispered to himself. “You’re just a regular kid right now. You can do this.”
With that, Castiel wraps his arms around him and Dean closes his eyes and doesn’t hesitate to return the hug. When he feels lips press to the side of his head, soft and affectionate, his heart swells with joy.
Zayn’s eyes widened but he nodded, nonetheless. “Cool. I mean, sorry about your mom. But, welcome. Hope you like it here.”
He pressed on the rewind button and forced his eyes to stay on the screen, trying not to think about every single piece of information he had gotten tonight. There had been so much to take in but he didn’t know what to do with them. But, the conversation was as good as done. He doubted he could bring it up again without Castiel closing off, completely.
The hunter scoffed. “Clearly, it’s still bugging the kid. He’s all sad and insecure and thinks I still hate him… Goddamnit, I never wanted that.”
Jack sent a frustrated-looking Angie an encouraging look before heading down to the seats. Casey was there, going through her phone. She wasn’t part of the play but was bored and didn’t want to go home, yet. So, she was here for moral support… and the free snacks.
“No.” Chuckling, Castiel picked up a napkin and reached over to him. Gently, he began to wipe away the chocolate stain on Dean’s face. “You’re a messy eater.”
The rest of the drive was quiet. They briefly stopped at a motel, just outside of Montana, for the night. The next day, they were off again. And, maybe Dean called Castiel about ten more times, just to check in. Who knew how long this was gonna take? There was nothing wrong with checking in on your friend, your kid, and your dog!
CadenceImperfect, _Chaotic_Kay_, and xim! Thank you so much for taking the time to read my first two chapters and giving me feedback!
It was a fascinating conversation and while Jack had listened eagerly, that familiar desire stirred inside him and he remembered Eliot, Max, and Stacey. He wondered how they were, if Stacy had passed her SATs, and if they went to the same school as those teenagers he was watching. He wondered if it was too late to apologize for his mistakes and be friends again. Ever since he met them, he had begun to want something he knew he couldn’t ask for.
“Yeah, but… every single night? And you don’t just talk about the case. You talk about your day and about Jack and whatever you’re watching on T.V. It’s…”
Castiel nodded. “They offered to resurrect the runaway angels and demons, as well as a few others and convinced the Empty that the move was needed. Chuck left everything broken and in shambles. They needed reinforcements to restore the balance of the universe. And, that way, the Empty can return to its rest. Well, it seemed that the Empty valued its sleep more than revenge because it agreed. And I was one of the angels resurrected. It wasn’t too happy about that.” Castiel chuckled, amused, before his face went serious again. “But… there’s a price.”
At that, Dean quickly sat up, panic clear in his eyes. “You’re coming back, though, right? ‘Cause Cas, buddy… If you don’t come back I… I don’t know if I can…”
With one hand still on Miracle’s fur, Dean lifted the mug to his lips and took a sip, letting out a contented sigh when he tasted the slightly bitter coffee. It warmed him up from his head to the tips of his toes as the caffeine woke his brain up.
His phone ringing interrupted Sam’s train of thoughts. Seeing “Eileen” flash on the screen immediately prompted a smile to appear on his face.
There was a mutual agreement to stay silent for a few seconds to remember all those they lost along the way.
Dean liked cooking. And, don’t tell Sam, but he especially liked cooking for his brother. At the end of the day, Dean was still a big brother who wanted to take care of his baby brother, no matter how old they both were now. (But, even if he had a gun pointed at his head or was back at Hell’s gates, he would never confess to it.)
He repeated his words in signs to her. “He was gone for only two hours. I know Dean isn’t the type to stay for breakfast but even that was too fast for him.”
“Well, Castiel is technically my uncle, too, but I consider him my father. And Dean and Sam are like my uncles.”
“Yes. Jack wanted to do something and since you and Sam were not gonna be home for a while, we thought of spending the day out.”
Dean pursed his lips and nodded before turning to Castiel to see his reaction. The angel was seriously examining Jack in the shirt, calculating eyes seeming to look at every seam and thread.
He was reluctant to leave Dean alone. But, then again, Dean wasn’t alone. Jack was there. And maybe Castiel would be back soon. Right? And it had been a while. And he missed Eileen so much.
A/N: Hello, everyone! I have no excuse for my lateness other than I've just been super busy lately! And I had a lot of writer's block while writing this chapter but now it's here! I hope it's to your liking!
They made it to the town center in one piece. Sam found a parking spot by a meter, not too far from the store. He placed a couple of quarters into the machine while Jack let Miracle out of the car.
Almost at once, he could see the shock and anxiety flash in Dean’s face. The man’s hands tightened around the steering wheel as he cleared his throat.
“I’m sorry,” he managed as he walked closer to his crying son. He pulled the boy into his arms, holding him tightly, cradling him in the way he should have if Jack had been born as a baby. “I’m so sorry. I… I didn’t know.”
“Yes, everything seems to be going smoothly. A few obstacles but nothing you need to worry about, they were all resolved, quickly. Kelly misses Jack but she’s happy to hear that he’s doing well.”
“If we had stayed longer in Sacramento back then, Dean would have probably participated in the regional competition," Sam continued, something like pride in his tone.
He was brought out of his reminiscing and realized that they had reached a door labeled, “OFFICE.” It was flanked by large glass windows, covered with a curtain to conceal the room behind it. Two kids were standing outside: a dark-haired boy wearing what appeared to be a varsity jacket and a blonde girl with pink streaks and a bow pinned to her ponytail. The two students watched them curiously as they entered the office, looking like they wanted to follow.
Swallowing the lump in his throat, Jack nodded and took careful steps towards them. He opened his mouth to explain but found that he couldn’t find the right words. So, instead, he opened his phone’s gallery, tapped on the image he took of Casey’s screen, and handed it over to Sam, who was the closest.
“I was thinking… You know, if Eileen and I get to the point in our life when we get married and have a kid, I might need something to fall back on aside from hunting. It doesn’t exactly have a stable salary.”
“I dropped out of college,” Claire chimed in. “Just wasn’t for me. Went hunting full-time. My sister, Alex, though, had a blast in nursing school. She’s a nurse now. And Patience will probably be in school forever, she loves it too much. She’ll never leave.”
Well, Dean had always liked Castiel’s eyes – or, to be more accurate, Jimmy Novak’s eyes. They were a pretty blue that reminded him of a clear night sky. But, the way they sparkled was different when Jimmy back in control of himself. Not that Jimmy wasn’t a handsome man ‘cause Dean could now admit that he was. But, when it was Castiel, things were different. The eyes held so much more.
Sam carries no weapon, but there’s still the slightest tension to his shoulders when he goes to answer the door. Old habits. He peers through the peephole, bending over to do it, and smiles.
They’re standing in the grassy clearing of a garden. Colors bloom around them, wildflowers bursting from the soil alongside orchids and lilies, vines creeping up trees bearing fruit, and runners race across the ground, sprouting pumpkins. Rows of corn, intertwined with bean and squash, stick up at the edge of the garden. Trees bear ripe peaches and cherries, and apples in green and yellow and a bright, squealing red. Cherry blossom trees pattern the air with swirling petals. Between it all, the air is crisp and cold. The kind of air that’ll shock a passerby into breathing deep and living well.
“Jack,” Naomi ventures. She allows such a motherly softness into her voice that Castiel is almost fooled. “You’re young. And you have so much responsibility on your shoulders. All I’m asking is that you trust my judgment, and all the years I’ve—”
Eileen eats like she hasn’t seen food in a hundred years, so Sam’s the one telling stories in the meantime. The rain warbles loud and soft, changing as the clouds shift overhead. Sam tells Dean about his and Eileen’s wedding, about turning the bunker over to Bobby, about Patience and Alex staying with them for a couple months when Eileen was pregnant and they’d just moved into their new house. Sam talks like every friend, every moment in time, is just around the corner.
“Because it will make you happy,” Castiel said. The fireflies were beginning to come out. They winked in the darkest spots between the trees. “They want you to be happy.”
“If we had more angels,” Naomi urges. “If you could retrieve them from the Empty, like you brought back Castiel—”
The wedding photo is larger than the other ones, and Eileen retrieves a frame for it from the heap. The photo is perfect. They look at each other, surrounded by greenery. Sam in his suit, and Eileen in her long white gown. She’s beautiful. And Sam looks like he knows it.
Above, clouds are rolling in. It’s a cool kind of gray day, and if Dean stops to think he wonders if the wind might be the only thing out here holding him up. He kicks at the gap where the boards of the dock meet unevenly. They’re worn from years of wear and tear, though he knows it’s possible nobody’s ever stood on this dock before him. He found it here this morning, nearly drove right past it. And like everything else here it’s foreign and familiar at the same time. Tailored to something in him that needed to stand over water and breathe in deep.
Sam’s pulled away— Donna’s arrived, pulling the Apocalypse World Bobby and Charlie after her. Charlie’s got her girlfriend by her side, and they greet Claire and Kaia with a familiarity only kindred spirits understand. A few moments later, Garth arrives with Bess and the twins in tow. They smile and wave. They know every face here. Each new person to arrive adds a dish to the ever-growing stack in the kitchen. Sam hands the baby off to Eileen and goes to pull the roast out of the oven. Alex passes out glasses and Jody pops the champagne.
Claire’s picking from the collection when her fingers stop on a particular tape. She pulls it out. It’s Cas’s tape.
“Take care of Jack,” Cas calls to Kelly above the wind. Kelly nods. For a moment, Cas wants to run to Jack instead. But Kelly will take care of him.
When Sam lets Eileen go he jumps into signing— he’s gotten good at it, and his words stumble after his hands. He’s earnest and tender, like he’s falling for her all over again.
Cas’s room has never been a place of particular attachment. He much prefers the kitchen, or the map room, or the library— places where he and Dean and Sam and Jack could sit around a table together. But it was always nice to have someplace he could go to be alone. And everything here is how he left it. The bed is made and never slept in. The desk is cleared away. There are a few books on a shelf, and of course a little radio with a cassette player. Dean had dredged it up from a yard sale someplace, as half a Christmas gift. The other half was the mixtape. Cas looks around. The cassette tape usually sits on the desk. It isn’t there. It isn’t in the cassette tape player, or on the nightstand. It isn’t anywhere in his room.
“Hey, Dean,” Eileen says. She glows like a saint, and the very blades of grass in the front lawn seem to lean in towards her. Her voice warbles, so warm and familiar in its accent that Dean feels guilty for ever being put off by it. She looks the same age she did when Dean last saw her. The lines in the corners of her eyes match Sam’s. She’s smiling to see Dean, but tilts her head a dash when she looks around. Her hands sign along as she asks: “What are you doing in my house?”
“That’s a little harsh,” Charlie says, sliding his mug of coffee at him. It’s gritty instant coffee with some of the powder still floating around and no sugar or cream to soften its wallop. It smells like the bunker, and when Dean sips it it tastes like pouring over volumes of legends and lore in the dead of night; hard times made easier by not having to do it alone. “It’s more like we’ll see each other when we want to, when it’s good for us and will make us happiest.”
In the distance— so far away that Jack and Cas wouldn’t have heard if they weren’t God and an angel, respectively— Kelly curses. A pan bangs against the kitchen floor.
Sam looks offended at that, which makes Dean laugh and Eileen turns her face up for a kiss. The cicadas are quiet, battened down during the storm. Dean collects the dirty plates.
. Cas, standing in front of him with Billie at his back and the world falling apart around them, taking the time to say—
“It’s okay,” Claire says. “I don’t have a cassette player anyway.” She sets it back in its place in the collection. “It’s better that it stays here, anyway. Just in case.”
“Anyone who’s dead and who would make you happy,” Charlie says. She looks around at the house. The afternoon is swaying outside, shaking the trees so the sunlight dances dappled across the kitchen. “Is it just you two in here?”
“Rowena will want something in return,” he says. “And it’s too much of a risk. Even if Rowena can be trusted, the rest of Hell can’t be. No.” He shakes his head. “I want to do this right. No more bargaining.”
“Hell isn’t happy,” Olga reports. They’ve upped their fighting back. Cas wonders what Rowena’s thinking. But though Hell’s pushing back, and the angels have to slow down, they still get all the souls out. So there isn’t much to do except keep going.
Eileen is curled up on the couch, combing through a stack of photographs. She’s surrounded by a mess of mismatched boxes, each bearing photographs, and several haphazard heaps of picture frames. She pulls a couple photographs out of the stack— Sam and Eileen at a bar, Sam kissing Eileen’s grinning cheek, and Eileen teaching Sam to sign ASL. They’re taken by somebody else, and Cas thinks that’s good. Good for them to have other people to take pictures for proof of their love.
“I wouldn’t just let them all in,” Jack says. “And I haven’t decided yet. But they could be judged like everybody else is.”
“It’s all you’ve done your whole life,” Kelly reasons. “But it might be time to let that go.” She takes a deep breath. “Castiel, I owe you more than I can ever repay you.
“I know that,” Jack says. “But killing Chuck wouldn’t help keep anybody safe, or build Paradise. It would just be for revenge. It would be cruel.” He tells Amara like an offering. “This way he’ll never hurt anybody again. If he wants to be, he has a chance to be happy on Earth. And maybe in Paradise, one day.”
Sam and Dean make the rounds. Ellen’s hug is warm, but Jo’s is tighter. The Roadhouse is dark and light, the dimness never fading the life that seems to pulse around them. There’s bullet holes in the walls even in Heaven, but the sight of them is marked with memories of bandaging wounds, the adrenaline of having lived another day and the laughter of it all being over. If Dean ponders it for a little too long, the smell of gunpowder and dried blood starts to remind him of hunts, of holding out a hand for Cas to heal. Ellen and Jo are at the bar, dressed like it’s 2009 forever. They’re smiling in their gruff way, a glass of whiskey in front of each of them. A shotgun on the counter sits within Jo’s reach.
“Well, there are monsters there who are people,” Jack reasons. “And when they die, they don’t get a choice of where they go. They all go to Purgatory.”
“I’m so sorry, Dad,” the kid says. And Dean doesn’t know what he could be apologizing for, but he knows the feeling. Coming face to face with the people you love most in the world, and feeling fear before anything else.
Sam shakes his head. “I guess she wouldn’t make me happy,” he offers. “I mean, I got married. And I’m not exactly the same person I was when we dated.” He thinks about it. “That was, what? Fifty years ago by now? Fifty-five?”
Naomi hesitates. Castiel can see the change as it moves through her— the softness she lets tug at the corners of her mouth, the way she smooths her voice out into a careful murmur.
“Don’t apologize,” Eileen insists, and her own eyes are going red and teary. “It’s okay, I’m here now.”
Dean is dead. And he’ll never have all this. Cas looks at Eileen and Sam, lost in bickering about where to hang a family portrait. Nothing but love in their eyes as they fight. Dean could have found this somewhere. A nice girl and a house. A job, something with his hands that pays the bills and puts food on the table. Kids to come home to.
“Obviously I brought my own,” Charlie says, grinning. She takes a seat at the kitchen table. She breathes in deep. “What’s yours smell like?”
Standing in a new Paradise, Jack looks around like he’s forgotten something. His eyes land on Castiel and he smiles. He raises a hand.
“Dad,” the kid says, looking up at his father. He’s teary-eyed, too, but there’s a smile like a surprise creeping across his face. “I— I had kids. I had two kids, little girls. And I named them after you and Mom.”
He has lived through so much sadness, he thinks faintly as he drifts through the memories of it all. Naomi stands over him, bearer of pain and suppression. What a privilege, he thinks, to have lived through such a life. He looks out at the warehouse, littered with bodies in Dean’s likeness. Their faces bloodied, their eyes burned out and mouths open in pleading. What a privilege for such memories to hurt him so. He wonders if his brothers and sisters, marble statues in a gallery, hurt so much. Probably not, he thinks as darkness blooms where Raphael once stood, where Samandriel and Duma and Rachel once stood. Friends and foe alike swallowed by the Empty. Each of their last moments corrupted by fear and horror and pain.
It was as he saw Cas being wheeled out of the hospital, his back pressed against the Impala, that he made the decision.
Sam found him hours later, sitting in front of Cas’ door, wishing to manifest him via sheer pain and regret.
After Sam deposited Cas back to his room, and promised him to be the one to drive him to physical therapy in the following days, Dean decided it was a good time to finally let himself be consumed by his unhappiness.
“Oh,” he blurted stupidly, immediately down on his knees, hands flying to Cas’ sweatpants. Cas hung his head low, his cheeks flushed, and ignored Dean as he brought his pants and boxers down, to his ankles, moving him around to accommodate the new position every now and then. Dean didn’t let his eyes stray for a single second, fixing them instead on the floor, and then immediately shot back to his feet.
Sam then extended a hand, helping Dean to his feet, and they stood there awkwardly, staring at each other, both having lost the will and energy to fight.
Dean nodded when he had to, and thanked her, and took the papers, and then went downstairs to pay the bill. When he returned, Cas had already been placed back on his chair, and was waiting for him with his eyes downcast. When he saw Dean, he quickly turned away and fell silent as he was wheeled back to the car.
Dean engulfed him in a bear hug, patting his back with a little too much strength – not like he could hurt him, anyway.
“You’ll always be an angel to me. Yup, you’re going to drink it, and you’re going to like it, because, guess what? It’s finally time you and I talked.”
“Dude, we don’t need a nurse,” Dean growled, now beyond a little irritated. “What am I, chopped liver?”
The doctor was now very, very confused, frowning at the word “save”, and glancing between them like this was a ping pong game.
“Nothing, really. We cut off the cast, then usually we let a relative or a friend stay to help the patient clean up, and then we proceed with a physical examination.”
Defeated, and feeling like a million years old, he turned tail and returned to the bunker. The moment he opened the door, Sam greeted him like an overexcited puppy, immediately looking behind him to see if he had company. When he saw that Dean was alone, his shoulders sagged, and stomped away with a tension in his jaw.
The nursery is the most protected room in the house, and it burns in Castiel’s sight. Sigils are carved into the door frame, holding several protective spells in place all around the room. Charms against intruders and threats, and against fire. Sam never gave up on the magic, then, Cas thinks. There’s a flowery wallpaper pasted all around the room, but beneath it Cas can sense every manner of defensive warding possible. There’s a devil’s trap beneath the carpet. Several hex bags are tucked under the crib. A box of salt sits at the ready on the windowsill. And high up on a shelf, out of reach, is a little jar of holy oil. Just in case. Though, noticeably, no warding against angels. Sam has left the door open for Cas.
He means Dean. Around them, the Garden is swirling with movement— the cherry blossom petals are fading as they fall, and tiny buds are sprouting across the tree branches, unfurling into bright green growth. The trees fill out like they’re inhaling, new things thriving.
Jack has moved on to roasting the cacao beans in midair, the beans crisping before their eyes, and then grinding them to a fine powder, like the dust beneath the Impala’s wheels. The smell of bitter chocolate fills the Garden of Plenty. Like a chocolate shop outside Chicago, or a bakery in Phoenix, or a dozen other places across the country. Like the bunker the first time Jack had tried to make chocolate chip cookies. The breeze catches the smell and whirls it around them, and the smell dances with the sight of souls arriving in Paradise. And for all that his back is turned, Cas can recognize a quiet happiness in Jack’s shoulders. The letting go of a tension he’s been holding.
Dean turns and walks through the house and out the back door— away from Sam and Eileen and Dean Junior, away from the house that is all theirs and none his, away even from the Impala in their driveway. He walks and doesn’t stop until he gets to the river. As Dean walks he supposes, absently, that the family business never ended, after all. It seemed to go on just fine without him.
Then they’re running towards each other, Sam and Eileen down the porch steps and the kid across the yard. In the brief second before he throws himself at his father, Dean reflects that the kid smiles just like Sam. Sam catches the kid, wrapping Eileen into a hug like they’re magnets drawn together by forces of nature. Eileen runs her hands through her son’s hair. After only a few moments in the rain, it’s already soaked, but none of them seem to even feel the cold. Dean Junior is only an inch or two shorter than his dad, but his shoulders shake in his father’s arms.
Cas often thinks about Dean’s taste in music, and why he seems to like Led Zeppelin so much. Dean likes loud music that rattles around in the Impala like it’s a pinball machine. Music where the instruments outscream the vocals. Music that at first listen always sounded to Cas like distilled movement and rage.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Dean says. He’s standing on a dock jutting out onto the swollen river. Greenery’s bursting from every inch of the riverbank, and he can see stones in every bright quartz color at the bottom of the water. The current’s rushing so fast that it picks up stones here and there and carries them along like petals on the wind. “I’m glad it’s you,” Dean continues. “You’re gonna do a bang up job. You’ve got a good head on your shoulders. And I know this is what everything was leading up to for you. I just— ”
Cas could show himself, could say a simple word and Dean would turn. Would forget Sam immediately. His mouth might drop. His eyes might widen. Those shining green eyes. Cas could speak to him again. Make a mistake somehow, like he always manages to do, and watch Dean’s mouth twitch at the corner with a little laugh.
For a moment Cas wants to be tempted. The possibility of seeing his old garrison again. Seeing Inias and Hester and again, seeing Anna and even Uriel and the others. For all that had passed between them, they were family once. Of course, that was when they were warriors of Heaven. Perfect marble statues without even the knowledge of how to love each other. All this— this sentiment— is just Cas’s too-human heart acting up.
They stood a ways away from the house, watching people arrive for the housewarming party. Cars lined the driveway and the side of the road on both ways. Already people bustled around inside, and more were traipsing up the steps bearing gifts. For each guest, Dean threw open the door. He puffed his chest out like a proud beaver showing off a fresh-built dam. He welcomed them with hugs and handshakes and ushered them inside.
“They tell me Cas is giving you a hand,” Dean continues. And he wonders what else he should say. He takes a deep breath. “Just tell him for me,” he says. “Tell him—”
are older. They’re worn into the wood, rounded out by years of absent fingertips running over them. Below them are two words freshly scratched in.
Maybe they can feel after all, Castiel thinks as he murders them again and again. The angel blade moves as easily in his death as it did in life.
Cas let him do what he wanted, as limp as a ragdoll, and when he answered, his eyes were far away, his voice betraying a deep, melancholy state of sadness.
“Other people managed to fit themselves into our lives. Bobby, Jody, Charlie, Ellen and Jo, a whole lot of them were… they were like family. We loved them. Grieved for them when they left us.”
He waited to see if he had struck gold. The emotions on Cas’ face were all as clear as day, and while recognising them was easy, interpreting them was another matter entirely.
Dean took a few seconds to remember them all. Some of them were still there. A few others he had, in a slightly different version. And then there were the people he had lost for good.
“I’m going to go catch some sleep,” he told Dean, clearly wary of his reaction, barely suppressing a yawn. “Call me if anything changes?”
“His room is ready, let’s go,” Sam translated. Dean couldn’t stop to hug Eileen, hands full, but made a mental note to do so later. They wheeled and carried Cas all the way, until finally, they were in his room. Next to Dean’s.
“Look at me and Eileen! Look at everything that’s happened. Chuck is gone, Dean, don’t you understand? We’re free.
That stung. Sam said “you”, not “us”. Sam clearly knew that whatever reason Cas had to do this, if was related to Dean.
Dean let out a breath and closed his eyes. He hoisted Cas back in his chair and wheeled him to bed, where the pills were waiting.
He tried, really. But every attempt at conversation immediately fell short as they both understood that certain topics were off-limits. So they talked about Jack, wondering where he was. They talked about Sam and Eileen, both happy for them. They talked about all the other people that had been brought back, in a world that stubbornly and persistently continued to spin around the sun, in blissful ignorance of what had happened, of what they had to bargain to keep them all alive.
“That’s not what I…” Cas had begun to answer, only to promptly shut down again and turning his eyes away. “Nevermind.”
Cas’ eyes cleared up. For a moment, nothing happened, as he looked into the green pools of repression, and denial, and saw them – for the first time since they’d known each other – open, honest. Uncovered.
Dean turned around, startled by the sudden appearance of a voice behind him. His eyes immediately softened. “Hey, kid.”
And so Dean nodded, and pretended like this wasn’t killing him, and before he knew it, it was time to bring Cas home.
They had kept him in there for nine days, in the end. Nine days in which Dean had had to stay at the motel, be a good boy, and make preparations.
“Don’t thank me yet, the process is a bit disgusting,” the doctor chuckled. “After all, you haven’t been able to wash those limbs for two months.”
“I’m not blaming you, Dean,” he reassured him. “I know that… your life has not exactly left you equipped to handle a situation such as this.”
“No, Dean. You know, had it been anyone else, you might have been given a free pass on this one, but not now. Not when… Dean, if you try to convince me, in any way, form or shape, that you don’t love that man to death, I will punch you in the face.”
“Sam and I… for the longest time, I only had him. Sammy. My little brother. My one thing to protect, to cherish…” Dean let his eyes grew distant, thinking back on those days when he believed fate had dealt him the loneliest of hands. “We grew co-dependant. It was unhealthy, I knew it, he knew it, we both knew it, and we both decided to ignore it, because when you only have your brother, you kind of make that one brother your number one priority.”
He didn’t even remember making the decision. One second he heard the noise, and then he was there, privacy be damned, pushing the door open and going to help Cas.
“I’ll restrain him if I have to,” Dean growled, already imagining the scene. Cas was coming home. Period.
For the lack of anything better to do, he ate. He drank. He went to the bathroom, and took a shower. And then he slept, and slept.
“But what you did was more than that. You didn’t just… fit. You re-defined what family meant to me.”
There was no compartmentalising that. The point remained; Dean knew how to lose. But he didn’t know how to stop fighting.
Sam looked on the verge of breaking down himself, but he steeled himself with a deep breath and passed the note over to Dean.
Dean took a deep breath and lowered his eyes. This was the most difficult part. If he could get through to this, with minimal damage, then everything would go well.
“Thank you,” he muttered, lowering Cas down on the pillows and helping him prop his leg up. “It’s… it’s good to have you back, Cas.”
After that, he started to go door to door with a picture of Cas – the one in his phone he took by mistake, and had secretly always cherished.
It was easy to give up all of that. Just the memory of Lisa’s onyx-black eyes was enough to renounce all hopes and dreams of ever having someone to call a hundred percent his own.
There was no corking this. There was no escaping. He could either jump into it, or lose Cas forever.
“I don’t think you can ever even begin to understand what kind of force, what kind of presence could force me away from what I had become. To tear me away from the belief that, other than my brother, I wasn’t made for love. For caring.”
Before he even made the decision consciously, he was out of bed, and striding towards his door, and towards Cas’ door.
Dean sharply turned his head upward. He had expected reassurance, fake promises, optimism, he hadn’t expected… contempt?
Their first night together was awkward, and a blur, and filled with so many embarrassing moments, and instances in which Dean’s mind awoke momentarily and kicked him in the stomach, angrily asking “What the hell do you think you’re doing, Winchester?”
“I feel like at this point it is redundant to say that we need to talk,” Dean continued, locking the door behind him.
Love was radiating off Castiel in waves, hitting him in the gut and making him weak all over. He could feel Cas’ eyes trained on him, he could feel the momentousness of the situation, and, as he took off the last item of clothing, he could feel it changing him.
He brought a few bottles to his room, and, trying not to think about how Cas was only one wall over, he promptly drank himself into a stupor.
He ignored the pretty nurse that came in after him, and listened with only half an ear when she returned and gave him instructions on Cas’ physical therapy, reassuring him about his state of health, and saying that the limbs were now fully functional, if a bit sore and atonic.
Jack left him outside of a run-down motel in Bismarck, North Dakota. A place he had never even considered, given that it was
Cas said nothing, his eyes resolutely fixed on the ground, his cheeks flushed by the exertion, and, probably, embarrassment. Dean was getting really tired of this.
“Nothing?” Dean asked, his voice rough from the alternation between disuse and screaming into his pillow.
“Cas, listen to me.” But what could he say? He knew how to solve this, but he was too much of a fucking coward to take the high road now.
“Oh, yes, it’s the perfect time to put down roots and start saving for a down-payment in a nice neighbourhood, is that what you’re saying?” Dean growled. Sam took a step forward, almost crowding him against the wall, his expression even more menacing.
“Because I haven’t even begun to say my piece. Not by a long shot. And your role, here…” Dean filled out two glasses and pushed one towards Cas, who gingerly took it. “Is just to listen.”
, Dean could hear, even though Cas didn’t explicitly state it. He hated himself for even thinking the L word, but right now there was a knife planted in his chest and he had to get out of there.
He had died multiple times. He had been possessed by Leviathans, by Lucifer. He had been burned, stabbed, beaten, cast away without a second thought.
And it had been relatively easy, all those years, to keep a tight lid on it. Cas had entered into his life as a hurricane, crashing down a wall he didn’t know he had put up and occupying a space inside him he didn’t think could ever be filled.
Dean wanted to growl at Jack, scream, yell “Fix him!” over and over, but as he realised the pain Jack was in, looking at the broken figure of his father, he figured there truly was nothing that could be done. Not right now.
because his last act had been to save you. What the fuck, Cas. How was I supposed to live with that?”
Dean steeled himself, and forced some courage out of his stupid fucking brain, because this moment was either their resolution or their undoing. And he was tired of fighting.
It was with that thought that he walked deep into a forest, reaching a beautiful clearing in the middle of nowhere.
“I ain’t going anywhere, princess. It’s not like a little dirt and a bad smell can chase me away now…”
How could Sam believe that Dean wasn’t capable of returning the feeling when Sam had seen him do exactly that, silently, covertly, not very subtly, for so long?
And whenever he tried to stray from that path, to carve himself a nice slice of normalcy, and happiness, destiny kicked him in the balls so hard that only a fool would ever try that shit again.
The breaking point came on a Thursday. Hah. Cas’ wounds had more or less healed, his surgical wound no more than an angry scar now, his casts almost ready to come off. In the last days, as the day of the appointment at the hospital neared, Cas had managed to grow even more impatient and hostile, always trying to do things on his own, never calling Dean for help, and straight-out refusing his aid when it came to the easiest stuff. Now he could feed himself, get dressed, even go to the toilet, as his strength came back in waves.
Cas nodded, frowning slightly. Dean knew that it must have sounded strange, from his point of view. Cas knew Dean loved his brother, but he had missed those first few years of unhealthy, insane attachment.
It wasn’t the shout that startled him. It was Sam’s frantic expression, as if he wanted to beat Dean, to shake some sense into him.
He had expected a certain awkwardness at having to see Cas naked, putting his hands on him, bathing him, feeding him sometimes, but it had never come. This wasn’t just some random dude who needed nursing, it wasn’t just any ordinary back that needed scrubbing, it wasn’t just any leg that needed scratching, this was Cas. This was…
“Nope, still feels good,” Jack chuckled, returning the embrace. When they separated, Dean strangely felt like a parent sending his kid off to college. Technically, he was an adult and more than capable of fending for himself, but on a more sentimental level, Dean still wanted to fold his laundry and scold him if he didn’t eat his greens.
“You act as if you’re angry at us. At me. For…” Dean cast a wary glance towards the doctor. “For asking Jack to help.”
“Look,” Sam whispered, putting a hand on his shoulder. Dean was beginning to shake. “Let me go see him. I’ll bring news. He’s getting discharged in a few days, anyway. Let’s not… let’s just respect his wishes, ok?”
Dean was more confused than ever. What had Cas taken from his little speech? Did he think this was Dean, letting him down gently?
“I will. You too.” They separated and stared at each other for a moment. Dean was oddly reassured by the fact that, despite the immense amounts of power raging inside him, deep down Jack was still just a sweet kid. It would come in handy with his job, his innocence. “And Dean,” Jack added, his face suddenly serious. “Remember. No one – and I mean no one – deserves this more than you do.”
“They can always repaint!” Dean sing-sang, looking back to throw Cas a playful glance. “I don’t… want… anything… to interrupt us,” he continued, putting up the finishing touches on the anti-Demon seal. “By the way, Jack says hi.”
Dean had put him back in the chair now. So it was the easiest thing in the world to cradle his face in his hands and force him to make eye contact with a gentle touch. Cas’ skin was burning, and it seemed like Dean’s hands on him were physically hurting him, because he shook his head free almost immediately. Dean lowered his hands, feeling so rejected his ears were ringing.
They took a motel room down the street, foolishly, wasting money, since they spent every single second in the waiting room. Only at the end of the second day, when the doctors still didn’t give them any news, did Sam temporarily give up.
When Jack, as the New God, pulled him out of the Empty and into the desperate and waiting arms of Dean Winchester, Castiel was almost beyond recognition.
“I wasn’t. I was just in pain. And waiting for you to get better. I never want to see you like that again, Cas.”
And that was what really worried Dean. The one thing his improvised skills as a nurse couldn’t help.
But this was Sam. How could Sam buy any of that crap when he had been looking at Dean with knowing eyes for twelve years?
“There is nothing you could ever do that would make me feel awkward, Cas,” Dean promised, his voice breaking on his name. He sounded unrecognisable to his own ears. Was this what it was like to finally be one hundred percent, truly, absolutely honest? “There is nothing, and I mean nothing, about you, that could ever disgust me.”
Sam took a deep breath then, as if steeling himself. Dean stopped drinking the juice, suddenly alert.
Sam greeted them with cake, to celebrate the casts being taken off. Dean ate it, and every mouthful felt like eating sand. Cas only pretended to eat, pushing it around in his plate, thinking no one knew what he was doing. Sam threw Dean a worried glance, but Dean shook his head minutely.
And then he was gone, leaving Dean in front of a motel, with a pissed off former angel waiting for him and desperate hope fighting a war against pessimism in his brain.
Sam roused quickly from his nap on the hospital chairs, immediately paling as he did so. Dean spoke, for the first time in three days, and his throat was on fire.
“Isn’t is enough yet, Dean? You’ve seen me with my pants down, as weak as a kitten, dirty, broken, out of my mind with pain medication, and now you want to see this as well? Don’t you have the slightest bit of mercy in you?”
“You fucked up. And I forgave you. Time after time, I forgave you. And when I fucked up, you forgave me. You didn’t just fit into my life, Cas, no.” Dean looked up at him and smiled, his eyes shining. “You brought down the entire thing. And then you rebuilt it. With you at the centre. The centre of each and every one of my thoughts, my priorities… You… You got under my skin, Cas. At some point, you became the reason, not Sam, not saving the world, not anything else. You.”
Cas wasn’t dead, he wasn’t stuck in heaven or in Purgatory, he was – technically – within Dean’s reach, just… unwilling to do so.
. So, Sam knew. Sam knew how Cas died. How that moment of true happiness had finally been at his reach.
“Nothing,” Sam replied. He didn’t sit besides Dean, like he would’ve expected, but stood silently at his side, staring at the door with him.
Dean’s eyes were full of tears, and he was glad they were hugging, so Sam couldn’t see his face. He cowardly hid his face even further in the folds of his brother’s shirt, but couldn’t quite hold back a sniffle.
Cas’ eyes widened, and Dean knew what it meant. This wasn’t a nickname. It was straight-out flirting. At least the comment about his mouth shut him up.
“It’s November,” Sam interrupted his breakdown. “Those credit cards are useless if he doesn’t know how to max them out without having them blocked. He has no powers. He’s still weak from…”
That night, alone in bed, an arm thrown over his eyes and an empty bottle by his side, Dean finally allowed himself to cry.
“I wanted to,” Dean rasped, his eyes clouded. Every word out of Sam’s mouth felt like a punch in the stomach. “I was going to. Then I found him gone.”
And so Dean came home in Cas’ arms. That was how his story ended. Not in tragedy, as he had always suspected, not in pain, not in solitude. It ended as he stopped pretending, and finally allowed himself to have exactly what he wanted to have.
“Thank you, Jack,” Sam whispered, his eyes earnest and full of tears, not quite able yet to look at the mess his friend had been turned into. Not quite able to stomach it.
Ah, fuck. He wished Sam was here. He wished he wasn’t a fuckup who could never discuss feelings properly. He wished his first instinct wasn’t to run away from the bathroom, get in the Impala and drive away. He hated himself for it. He was a poor excuse for a man.
How could Sam understand that Dean had tried, had wanted to talk about it, but he had never believed for a second that Cas could love him like that, and when he confessed, it had already been too late? And then he came home from the hospital, broken in body and mind, and Dean just couldn’t bear to tell him that he loved him, too, but that relationships were out of the question for him?
“Do what you want,” he spat out. “Take my help, don’t take it, fine. Call a nurse. Call a dozen nurses if you want. I’ll still be outside, ready to take your info about physical therapy and drive you back home. And if you still think I’m disgusted by… by you, and nothing can change your mind, fine. I just…”
. And Dean had resigned himself to it over the years, hadn’t he? He had made his peace with it. It was just another item on a long list of things he couldn’t have.
And, leaving his speech unfinished, Dean bolted out of the room before he could do something embarrassing like bursting into tears.
For a second, Dean wondered how Cas could have gotten so far from Lebanon, but then he found the answer sitting in the parking lot.
Every new inch of skin revealed was like a prize, like something in serious need of worshipping, because he could have this now.
“I just can’t believe this is my life now: I’ve been talking more about feelings in the last 24 hours than in my entire life,” Dean scoffed, desperately uneasy about this conversation.
Only a few days, and endless research, endless worrying, and here he was. Sitting on the bed, human, tousled from his shower, holding a glass like he didn’t quite understand what he was supposed to do with it.
When they got to the bunker, surprisingly, Cas let Dean be the one to hoist him up and into the wheelchair, even raising his weak good arm to wrap around his shoulder and stabilise himself. Sam rose his eyebrows, remaining blissfully silent, and as Dean deposited Cas on the wheelchair, he went ahead to make sure that the doors were open and that he was there to help lift the chair every time they encountered stairs. As they locked the main door behind them, Eileen promptly appeared, signing something to Sam.
“You are fooling yourself if you believe that’s still true,” Sam laughed sarcastically. “You are so deep in denial, and repression, that you have to come up with excuses not to allow yourself to be happy, and force your misery on everyone else.”
“You know what? If you expect an apology for that, you can go fuck yourself. Big time. I’m not going to apologise for… asking Jack to help. I’m never going to apologise for that. And if you think I… I hate you, now, then that’s just stupid talk. But I’m done. I’m done trying to help you, to care for you, to…”
“One,” his brother growled, throwing a burger and a gallon of orange juice at him. “You are a moron. Two, you are a drama queen. Only you could be such a dick to make me worry about you as well as having to worry for Cas. Three, I called Eileen. The bunker is ready for us when we get back, she’s preparing a room for Cas. It’s the one next to yours, there are almost no stairs. Four…”
“Hey, Cas,” he greeted him with an easy smile, like this was nothing, like his insides weren’t on fire. He controlled his body forcefully, stopping tears, preventing tremors before they could manifest, he put on a brave face.
“Dean!” Sam physically grabbed him by the shoulders to turn him around. Dean was surprised – by the gesture and by his instinctive reaction: he almost knifed Sam there and then. “What is the plan?”
“It was shitty of me,” he quickly pointed out, not wanting any form of absolution for his behaviour. “It was just a cowardly way out. I asked everything of you, and you said ‘Happy to bleed for the Winchesters’. That’s fucked up, Cas.”
Dean touched his cheekbone and widened his eyes as his fingers came away with blood, staring at his brother as if he were a stranger. Sam was panting heavily.
“Don’t play dumb, Sammy,” Dean shot back. He rose to his knees – which protested with a soundly crack – and stared at his brother dead in the eye. “How many times have we discussed this? We don’t have the kind of lives that allow relationships. How many times have you said exactly that, and how many times have we tried to, anyway?”
“Don’t deny yourself happiness just out of habit, Dean,” Sam whispered, enveloping him in a bear hug. “I know in a moment you’re going to call me a bitch, or a girl, or Samantha, and run away because that’s what you do whenever feelings are involved, but just for this second,” he breathed into Dean’s hair. “Just for this second, believe me. You can be happy. You can have him. And if you don’t go get him, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.”
“We got a motel room nearby,” Sam replied for him. “But when he gets discharged, we live only forty minutes away, so he’ll be able to come for his follow-ups.”
“I had no other choice,” Cas justified himself. “If it’s ever going to come between me or you, I’ll never have a choice. I’ll die a thousand times, happily, if it means you’re safe.”
now. And I can see it in you face, just as I could see it while I was telling you. You’re disgusted.
As Cas got closer, his brother pushing his wheelchair, Dean realised his impulse decision had been a correct one. Cas was looking at him – and God, Jack, he looked so tired, and hurt, and sick, and there were still bruises as far as the eye could see – like he expected Dean to pull a gun on him any second.
“Yeah, well, tough.” Dean opened his bag again, and took out several bags of chips, jerky, and a couple of soda cans. “Here,” he said, tossing a fair portion of it to Cas, who took whatever he could, and let the rest fall on the floor and on the bed.
Dean didn’t hear much after “He’s going to pull through”. It was Sam who took notes – bless his nerdy heart – about multiple fractures, internal bleeding, concussion, blood loss. It was Sam to reassure the doctor about not having to call the police, and Dean missed entirely the half-assed excuse Sam had to invent to justify why their “brother” had been reduced to a carcass. The doctor seemed convinced, however, and Dean was grateful to his actual brother for his inventiveness.
“Yeah, yeah, you want to help. I know. And have you ever stopped to think about what this had been doing to me? Having you see me like this? Powerless, and pathetic, and, and… just the opposite of what I was before I saved you.”
“No, not everything,” he agreed. “But how could I ask any more of you, Cas? How was I supposed to look you in the eyes, after everything you’d gone through for us –
“Yeah, well, put yourself in my shoes for a moment. First, you confess your feelings to the love of your life. Then, you die. Then you come back, but with no powers, and you have to let him help you, let him see you at your absolute worst, wiping you, bathing you…”
After what felt like hours of just kissing, and talking, and laughing, and more kissing, he took of Cas’ clothes perfunctorily, like it was a task as banal as filling the tank, or changing Baby’s oil. He was surprised by his own matter-of-fact attitude about it, because the clothes, he realised, were just objects. Just canvas covering what was always his goal. He removed them as if they were insignificant, because they were.
“You’re my friend,” Dean managed to get out, and then wanted to kick himself in the balls. Seriously?
Every day there was a new challenge. Getting Cas to help Dean bathe him. Protecting his arm and leg with a plastic bag and tape and refusing Cas’ suggestions that they get a nurse – “Really? And how do we explain the wards and the fact that we live in a pre-War bunker?” – that they call Sam or Eileen instead – “Dude, they’re a little busy reconnecting, I think” – or that Dean just leave him to his own devices to manage – “Yeah, dude, not happening”.
“What is it?” he asked, breathless, immediately kneeling down to see him at eye level. Cas looked as if every word out of his mouth was pure torture, but with gritted teeth he spat out:
“I don’t think that’s necessary,” Cas muttered, playing with one of the bags of chips. “I think you’ve pretty much said anything you had to say.”
Dean’s knees weakened at the idea. He was only halfway through physical therapy, according to Sam. He couldn’t possibly be strong enough to sleep rough or walk miles and miles on that leg of his.
As they laughed, and laughed, and stopped laughing only to look at the other and start all over, it was the most natural thing in the world to do to climb up on Cas’ bed and sit by his side, taking his hands in his and sliding into his place in the world. Their eyes danced as they stared at each other, and their first kiss was stupidly off-balanced, hindered by curved lips, by smiles, and it was like kissing Cas’ laughter rather than his lips. It took them a few tries, waiting for their elation to finally die down, to get it well and truly right.
What if he was dead already? In a ditch, without a cell phone – he had left his on his bed, turned off – starving and dying of thirst and pain and…
He only came out of his room to get something to eat and more bourbon, ignoring Sam’s worried looks, Eileen’s disapproval, and avoiding Cas pretty much like the plague.
“I mean, I don’t think that’s wise. I think… you should give him a few more days. And then, I’ll come to you and tell you where to find him. Sounds good?”
Jack inclined his head and frowned, in that way that reminded Dean so much of Cas, and really, how were they not biologically father and son?
Cas couldn’t use crutches, because one of his arms still had his cast, so he still had to let Dean put him on the chair. He did so with pursed lips, and when they entered the orthopaedics department he immediately asked if a nurse could help him.
“I have to go check something out,” Sam announced then, finally allowing himself to kiss his girlfriend. “Are you going to be okay?”
Cas pursed his lips and sat down on the bed. He crossed in arms on his chest and clenched his jaw, finally putting together how Dean could even be there.
Cas’ breath was coming up faster and faster. He stared at Dean, looking for signs of deception, disbelief written all over his face. Scepticism. Suspicion.
“It was easy to push it down,” Dean continued, ignoring the rapid raising and falling of Cas’ chest. And his own. “You have come into our lives so innocent, so naïve, so… untouched. In every sense of the word. And the moment we met, I had to ask everything of you, I’ve had to push you into doing a lot of shit, and you gave, and gave, and gave, until there was almost nothing left. And it was easier, it was easier asking for all those sacrifices, if I… If I pretended that you were just another hunting buddy.”
He grabbed Cas’ good arm, the one that wasn’t in the sling, and his good leg, and hoisted him up, careful not to jostle him too much. He walked to the bathroom, steady, and deposited him on the toilet, mindful of signs of pain.
His main concern was his leg. He couldn’t have walked a long way, not with his muscle tone so compromised, and if he wasn’t in a hotel, a room or a shelter, where the hell could he have gone?
“Beggars can’t be choosers,” he said scathingly one day, as he cleaned Cas’ surgical wounds with alcohol. Cas had protested for at least half an hour about that, insisting he could do it on his own, that Dean didn’t have to see him like that. Dean had obviously ignored him, getting his jumper – an old one of his, blue, and soft, and so warm – over his neck and settling to do his job.
“I love you,” he whispered again, taking his mouth again, his hands coming up to caress the sides of the man he loved. The human – angel – he loved. The angel that had fallen for him.
Cas was going to heal from the wounds inflicted by the Empty, stay human, grow old, and die, and all Dean wanted was the privilege to stay and watch. As the days had stretched, back when he was still in the hospital, he had started to believe that he was going to be denied that privilege. Now, Cas’ little smile had given him a bit of hope.
“I don’t know, really,” Jack replied pensively. “I guess I just… I’ve always felt like Sam was more of an Uncle, really. Not really a dad. I wondered why, and then I realized that it was because… well, in my mind, you and Cas were my fathers.”
