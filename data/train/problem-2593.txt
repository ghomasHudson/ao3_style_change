cas glared up into dean's narrowed eyes and felt himself regaining the rage from the hours before. he brought his hands up and grabbed dean's wrists and ripped them from his clothing. his eyes widened a bit at the swiftness of castiel, but he became even more surprised as cas whipped dean around and slammed him into the car.
"meg, castiel, pay attention please," mr. mars snapped. he went back to his lecture about what castiel could only assume to be something about saudi arabia, the whole chapter has been as much.
dean grunted as he grabbed sam's arm and pulled him to the front door. the slamming from it shook the house and instilled silence between the brothers.
he rolled onto his side and looked at his bedside table, the sight of red numbers shining before him. 4:37, great, just his luck. groaning again, he quickly pulled his pillow over his head and let the coolness of the underside ice his face.
"what the hell are you doing?!" cas whisper-yelled. "it's freezing out here! did you really walk here?"
"wow, thank you for humbling me, i didn't know i was that good," cas teased as he grabbed his jersey and shorts off the floor and putting it in his bag. when he looked back and dean had still not moved, he felt a little bit worried. "you good?"
"mhm, i'm sure you would love to have me in your mouth," cas mumbled, turning toward the stairs. a strong hand wrapped around castiel's bicep and pulled him backward. "hey!"
"you don't know how badly i want to beat you into a pulp," dean hissed through his teeth. "if i could, you would already be out."
"i'm being nice enough to wait, i could fuck you right now," castiel practically hissed, purposefully slamming into dean harder than he had before, earning a rather loud inhale from the other. "so shut the fuck up."
"i can't sleep at home right now. just let me stay here for like an hour, that's it," dean asked, but it seemed more like a demand.
how could cas let this happen again? it was just suppose to be a one time thing. no, it was never suppose to happen at all, but now it has, and more than just once. cas hates dean, it makes no sense that this would even happen a first time, let alone more. it was all so wrong, so so wrong, and it made absolutely no sense, but cas did not have the time to even try to think about it.
dean took a step back but narrowed his eyes on cas. "you're so pretentious," he mumbled simply. "we're leaving, sam."
"are we still hanging out after you have practice tonight? it's my only day off this week," meg interrupted quietly, shaking castiel's shoulder gently.
dean grabbed castiel's arm and threw him away from the lockers into the bench, causing him to trip and fall over top of it and onto the ground.
she rolled her eyes and flicked a couton in castiel's direction, earning a pitiful glare from him. "don't give me that gross pep-talk bullshit, i'm gonna vomit."
castiel did feel slightly bad about going so slowly, as there was a sharp intake of air the whole time, but he assumed it would feel better than doing it all at once.
a few minutes passed of the silence, which was both appreciated and infuriating. dean had moved to tapping a pencil, but cas had completely tuned it out or he would have actually lost his mind. "your jaw is fucked."
the drive back home was much more comfortable and enjoyable than he originally thought it would be. meg certainly improved his mood a lot, which was very lucky. he wasn't sure if he could handle being around meg and being mad.
cas was so close, and the sight almost pushed him over, so he continued to drag his nails down dean's skin as he fucked him through his high. within a few seconds, cas, too, was cumming, slowing his thrusts to a stop. he could hear dean's loud gasps for air as the slapping of skin stopped.
"wanted to try something new," cas lied as he looked up to her. her hair was pulled back in a messy bun and she wore a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. "and why do you look like you forgot to wake up this morning?"
cas started feeling around in his bag for clean clothes but he never took his eyes off the boy. dean lowered himself down and made his way off the bench, almost falling down in the process. "seriously, i didn't actually do anything, did i?"
of course it wasn't a big deal, but it felt like at least something. dean couldn't decide how it affected cas, and it felt like something to him, something that truly pissed him off.
"nice to know how much of an effect my cock had on you," cas smiled smugly, turning around and getting dressed.
there isn't anything wrong with being gay, of course, but it's less of the gay thing and more of just a dean thing. even if he were to like dudes, dean would not be his type at all. he's a sorry excuse for a "bad boy", if you could even call him that. he's a bad boy in the sense that he skips class, breaks the rules, and all the girls are attracted to him, not that castiel understands the hype, but he doesn't fit the stereotype enough to earn such a title. he doesn't actually get with any of the girls who find him attractive, at least, not that anyone knows of, but he doesn't even really have friends. he just hangs out with his little brother most times. him, the team, or his brother's friends. as far as cas was concerned, dean only fit under the category of weird.
a belt clattered onto the carpet, quiet drops of clothing articles, and quiet steps to the bed kicked the silence away. they stood mere feet apart, nakedness shown to one another. dean broke the tension by climbing onto the bed and resting his head on the pillow, back on the mattress.
"shut up with your basketball lingo. i'm starting to regret becoming your friend," she deadpanned. cas crinkled his top lip and furrowed his brows. "kidding, kidding. i still like michael more though."
dean was now on hot pursuit toward cas, and it scared him a bit. he tried taking a step behind him, but his back made contact with the freezing, metal lockers, causing him to suck in air through his teeth as he jumped away.
"cas?" castiel groaned. "we going by nicknames now? didn't know you liked me that much," he chuckled, rolling his eyes.
"get the fuck off of me," cas mumbled, shoving against dean's chest. "i'm not fucking doing this with you." and with that, dean was off, and cas was grabbing his things and leaving the locker room.
the boys were still as they panted, chests rising and falling as they waited for their high to calm down. once sufficiently satisfied, cas slowly pulled out of dean, earning a rather aggressive grunt. castiel just simply rolled his eyes and peeled the condom off himself and tossed it in the bin.
well, now they have much more than just fighting that they need to keep hidden. no one needs to know about what they did the day before, not that it meant anything anyway.
dean's nostrils flared and his eyebrows furrowed as he clenched his fists tightly together. "you don't know when to stop, do you?"
cas started walking to the front doors, finally noticing the pain in his jaw. it stung, and he knew it was going to bruise. he had been punched in the face by dean enough times to know that he has a good swing.
gabe gritted his teeth at cas and threw a piece of paper at him, which floated down rather slowly. "what is your problem, huh? we were busy, castiel! can't you just put your fucking feud aside for a fucking second?" he shouted as he stormed off upstairs, slamming his bedroom door behind him.
castiel snatched up his keys off the counter and left the house to get to his car. the only person he could think to go to, the only person he could stand to see in this moment, was meg. she was most likely fed up with him always having problems with dean since it's been going on for over three years, but she's never said otherwise.
"okay, well, let me know next time, alright? i was worried sick about you. i called you at least twice," she mumbled, walking next to cas as they made their way to the salt, butter, and yeast smelling shop.
"go rinse off, you look disgusting," cas mumbled, pulling out of dean. he slid the condom off and tossed it into the trash next to his bed. "go."
"i'll visit you at work once i'm done with practice. coach is gonna be pissed off with me, and i could definitely go for a pizza pretzel after i get my ass verbally whooped," cas chuckled.
"just giving the princess time to adjust," castiel sarcastically smiled as he started to move at a more normal and consistent pace, though it was nowhere near fast.
"so am i, i missed my lunch." she narrowed her eyes on me before smiling and walking into the kitchen. "better buy me one too!"
"i actually enjoyed you being over there, i didn't have to look at your face that way," cas mocked as he stripped off his shorts and tossed them at dean. "but if you have to see mine."
more slow thrusts were exchanged before dean felt more comfortable, and castiel wasn't a total prick, so he waited to speed up until he was told that he could. he went at a medium pace, the sound of skin slapping and loud grunting filled the room, as well as a stronger stench of sweat. castiel was fairly quiet, but dean had become a mess underneath cas.
the drive to pretzel palace was weird, to say the least. cas just railed a guy and he's just gonna go visit his best friend like nothing even happened? he was sure that she was going to pick up on his different vibes and almost force the information out of him, which couldn't be any worse of a situation. for obvious reasons, of course.
"sulking is going to make you any better," cas rattled off, slipping off his jersey and tossing it into his bag.
dean glared at cas for a moment more before standing up and looking in the direction of the voice. it turned out to be one of the teachers who must have seen them.
rage coursed through cas' veins as he made his way into the mall and to the shop where meg worked. he felt his whole body stinging with warmth, his cheeks especially hot. he knew they were as red as could be, but he was beyond pissed, so he couldn't care less.
"what the fuck is your problem? do i need to call a doctor for you or something?" cas groaned as he watched dean, his body never moving. "your eyes are going to dry out if you don't stop."
slowly, cas pulled his cock from dean, just a few inches, before slowly thrusting back in, earning a pained inhale from the man under him. "would you be more careful?"
"i just didn't want to come," cas replied, trying to get away, but dean pressed his hands either side of cas to hold him in place. "look, i don't give a shit about how coach treats you, okay? doesn't matter to me either way. you're just too much of a pussy to handle it."
dean stood before cas wearing nothing but a pair of boxers, but his confidence was through the roof. he took another step toward cas. a few of the boys poured out of the room, not wanting to stick around for whatever was to come.
"yeah, pick up the slack, novak," dean hissed into cas' ear from behind. "can't win a game with you playing like that."
castiel was slightly stunned, to say the least, as dean never usually physically fights with him with people around. he tried to play it cool by sitting down in the nearest chair and just act like nothing had even happened. cas technically didn't even know what happened, he just knew he didn't want it to anytime soon, or preferably, ever.
"okay, save it, you cunt. i feel like shit today. i'm also pissed because it didn't snow at all, and now i have to do a presentation looking like a depressed 12 year old. she's gonna take off points for sure, that wench." she plopped down behind me and began grabbing books from her bag.
castiel removed his fingers and lathered his cock with the remaining lube before slowly sliding the tip into dean, which caused him to let out a pained moan.
"you don't fucking get it, do you? i don't want to see you any more than i have to. you could have just fucking left, or at least told me you were going to be there! who just shows up unannounced?!" cas shouted, bring his hand up and shooting it at dean's cheek, his palm making contact with the skin and creating a loud slapping sound.
dean started grinding on castiel, throwing his head back with a grin. cas wrapped his arms around dean's body and his hands made contact with his ass, squeezing it harshly.
cas, louder than he meant to, stomped down the stairs to the front door. he swung open the wood, making dean jump backward.
"right there," dean moaned out, taking the sheets into one of his hands and gripping tightly. cas focused his motions in that area, quickening his speed as well, making dean moan out. "fuck."
the hot water was calming, almost needed to calm his nerves, not that he really knew or understood what he was nervous about. bubbles coated his skin and felt soft against him. it made cas smile; the bubbles were pure and simple, everything he wished for. he didn't want to waste more water than he had to, so he rinsed himself off and got dry. walking back into the room, he took one look and sighed. there dean laid, his eyes closed and quiet snores escaping his lips.
cas decided to pick peace, just this once, and continue getting dressed, but as the others on the team kept joking about him, he grew more and more impatient with them.
"you're so small, you really think you can just give me a little push and expect anything from it?" dean laughed.
dean simply chuckled as he gripped the fabric tighter and shoved cas further up against the car. "you're just all talk, you wouldn't hit me if you wanted to."
"sorry, didn't mean to strike a nerve or anything," she chuckled, insincerely as possible. cas simply rolled his eyes and began to focus on the teacher who had just walked in.
castiel just laughed slightly as he continued on with his work. he positioned himself to thrust into dean at a different angle, and by the sharp moan released by him, he knew he found it. he made sure to keep going at the same angle each time, causing any back talking he could have been getting to be stalled, as dean was much more occupied with sloppy moans slipping from his tongue.
everything going on was ridiculous, so fucking stupid. what randomly clicked in dean's stupid fucking brain that decided he wanted cas to fuck him? what even made cas do it? there was no reason he should have done that. no reason at all.
meg chuckled as she leaned back in her chair and just watched cas glaring at the boy he so dearly hated. "don't stare too long, people will think you're in love."
lying was something cas hated to do, especially to meg. she was the only person who he could rarely lie to, so his convincing nature caught even himself off guard. is this really what this whole dean situation is going to come to? lying to his best friend? and not only lying, but being convincing enough that even meg falls for it?
with a loud sigh, dean let go of the boy and walked away, only to bring back a condom and a small packet of lube. "now c'mon then."
cas couldn't think of a single thing that could be said to even begin to cover it, so he left it as if dean hadn't said anything at all. he finished getting dressed, washed his hands, and left in a hurry.
"fuck you," cas laughed, looking down at the table. "you're just saying that because you had a crush on him in third grade."
minutes passed by slower than a turtle in molasses. there was little to nothing to actually do, as he had already finished all his work in his suspension time earlier in the day. dean seemed to be in the same boat, as his stares were completely fixed on castiel like they were glued in place. cas had no trouble meeting his eyes back, just watching any of his slight movements. though it may have been only a few seconds to a minute, he seemed to know all dean's mannerisms like the back of his hand at this point.
he started to put his things down and away where they belonged, his bags in the corner and gym clothes in the laundry, despite not wearing them for most of the week. he pulled a textbook and some paper from his bag and sat at his desk, but was so unable to focus on any work that he sat with his head in his hands mumbling incoherent sounds.
dean's eyes became dark as he scowled and rushed toward cas, grabbing his shoulders and shoving him onto the ground. dean fell onto cas' stomach, straddling him as he punched cas in the jaw.
"i would prefer not to make you a pretzel at all," she chuckled. "but i'll do it because i love you."
the white honda civic jerked to a stop as cas pressed the brakes a little too hard. he sighed as he shifted into park and slowly dropped his head onto the steering wheel. his brain was absolutely swarming with thoughts, but he felt that he couldn't form any of them into even one that made sense.
"you aren't denying it either," cas replied with a half assed laugh as he made his way out of the kitchen and up the stairs into his room. "god, fuck him."
"no, dipass. school might get cancelled," she groaned back to him. a small glob of ranch rested on the side of her mouth, and castiel pointed it out with a chuckle. she simply wiped it off and continued to eat.
"dean fucking showed up at my house, meg. he was just fucking sitting in my kitchen. what kind of psychopath does that?!" cas shouted a little too loudly, as the couple near him gave a dirty look.
cas was furious, but how could he not be? this was so much more than he signed up for. he didn't even technically know what he signed up for when it came to dean and him, but he was sure as hell that it wasn't this.
"no need for excuses," cas mumbled, grabbing hold of dean's hips rather aggressively, his fingers pressing deep into the muscled skin. the skin around the fingers turned a white shade, his fingertips pink.
once fully in, he leaned against dean slightly, curving his hips around his ass and his stomach against his back. cas took hold of dean's upper thighs as he simply laid against him and waited to move. once dean felt like he was in less pain, cas slowly moved in and out, barely pulling his cock from dean's ass.
"my bad for never being fucked before," dean seethed. he held himself up with his hands and knees planted firmly on the metal bench in the middle of the locker room.
the room fell completely silent, but at the same time, it felt like it was buzzing with some of the loudest screaming in the world. cas knew it was obviously just in his head, that it was just from the millions of thoughts racing in his mind, but he was so worried that someone else could still hear it.
"what's up with winchester?" meg asked quietly, her head leaned closely toward castiel's. great, it's noticeable.
dean was now just feet ahead of him and looked like he had no intentions of stopping. his hands, rather aggressively, made contact with castiel's shoulders, shoving him back into the lockers, causing a loud slamming sound that could most likely be heard from outside the room.
"well, sam is cool and he says that him and dean get along great. maybe he just hates you," gabe bantered back, contently closing his eyes as he bit his sandwich.
cas slid his fingers slowly into dean, glancing up at dean every few seconds to see his clenched eyes and furrowed brows. he curved his fingers up slightly and felt the spot that he was looking to find. dean took a sharp inhale and bit his lip.
dean snarled and shoved himself into cas harder. castiel let out a strained breath and squinted his eyes shut.
"he fucking did what?" meg exclaimed, grabbing her starbucks cup and taking a sip of whatever hot pink colored drink was in it. "you're late because he almost fucked you up?"
castiel could feel the warm sensation in his stomach getting stronger. "are you close?" cas groaned.
most of the boys had trickled out of the room slowly, only a couple left, as well as dean and cas. dean was still in his sweaty jersey and shorts, sat on the same bench that he and cas had fucked on this time the day before. of course he was.
dark eyes stared at cas as he walked into the detention room. dean's cheek was still slightly red from castiel slapping him that morning, so cas was sure that his own jaw was going to be badly bruised, it always is. dean has a good hitting arm.
cas groaned, looked over to his door, seeing dean already unbuttoning his pants. not being in the mood to argue he simply replied, "yeah, okay."
dean huffed before swinging his fist toward cas, but was dodged easily. cas followed dean's actions from the day before and shoved him against the lockers next to them. he rolled his eyes and began to walk away, but was grabbed by the shoulders and thrown to the ground.
cas parked his car in the school parking lot and immediately tensed up as he saw dean storming in his direction. he forced himself to rip himself from the seat and make his way outside. he barely closed the door before dean was screaming at him.
"why don't you try taking a dick up the ass and see how it feels?" dean seethed as he swung his head as far to the side as he could, trying to look cas in the eyes.
one of dean's hands stayed tangled in the sheet while the other wrapped around castiel's wrist, pulling it up to his hair before letting go. he knew it had to be related to whatever pain thing dean had. cas tangled his fingers into the short hair before raising his hand up, tugging on the strands.
cas continued to thrust into dean, he was so close. he watched as he started to feel the effects of the overstimulation and he bit his lip as he let cas finish, which he did moments later. dean's cum was covering his lower torso and his entire body was covered in sweat.
"what the hell?" she groaned. "i took my lunch break early to wait for you and walk around only for you to totally blow me off and wait until i had five minutes left? are you fucking kidding?"
silence settled between the two as she started playing some game on her phone. it was normal for them to have quiet moments together, and cas endlessly respected that. she was so easy to be around, and she really was caring, even if she put up a hard front. before she got a job, and even still now, just less often, they would spend afternoons at each other's houses and just act like they were home. sometimes they didn't even stay in the same rooms. it was nice to have someone he was so comfortable around.
castiel was sure that meg was panicked that he wasn't in class. he was being monitored through the whole day, so he didn't dare check his phone, but he didn't want to either. having meg mad at him was just something he didn't want to deal with at the moment. there were far more important things to be worried about.
dean pulled the boy against his chest and covered his mouth with a callused hand. "don't fucking start shit you aren't going to finish." he threw cas off of him, making him trip over his own foot and almost fall to the floor.
cas kept his same pace as he waited for dean to reach his high. dean's hand around his cock sped up to match cas' thrusts, which led, very quickly, to him reaching his peak. he yelled out as his body jerked forward, cumming across the bench under him. cas followed suit and choked out as he came, biting his lip rather harshly. there was no way he was going to be louder than dean, that bottom bitch.
a quiet clink noise came from the other side of the room, forcing cas to leave his comfort and investigate. he turned on his phone flashlight, blinding himself in the process. there didn't seem to be anything there. he must be hearing things, he decided. he rolled back over and closed his eyes.
dean fished out his wallet, dug around in it before he tossed a condom and packet of lube at cas. "you should really invest in that."
another slow thrust into dean caused the older to moan quietly, earning a scoff from the man under him. "don't get too comfortable, sweetheart," dean mocked.
"leave me the hell alone, winchester. you've missed more shots today than i have," i seethed. "but then again, maybe you're just sore."
the rest of practice went just as badly, if not worse, than it had been before. dean and cas, of course, being the seemingly best players on the team, did fairly well, but that couldn't be applied to everyone.
"enjoying yourself?" cas smirked as he thrusted quickly. he squeezed dean's hips tighter momentarily before loosing his grip again.
"where were you yesterday?" dean hissed, his eyes almost dark. "coach threw such a hissy fit and pinned it all on me. i had to run twenty laps because your incompetent ass couldn't make it to practice." cas rolled his eyes and tried to walk around dean since he was stopped in the middle of the doorway. he got just past before getting shoved into the wall next to them. "i'm talking to you, motherfucker."
dean rolled his eyes but got up and went into the bathroom, leaving cas alone once again. he sat and waited for his turn, but his mind was almost completely empty. every thought was something he didn't want to think about, so he blocked everything out until there was nothing.
the only times that they had even done this was in a dirty locker room on the bench where they could be caught at any moment. now that they were in a private setting, they took a little more time with each other, a little more preparation at a slower pace. they were in no need to rush.
"oh, shut the fuck up," dean remarked as he motioned to get off the bench. cas watched as he winced in pain with every motion. "fuck."
"again? so soon?" dean whispered. he rolled his hips into castiel's roughly and held him tighter against his body.
cas pulled out and removed the condom, dropping it in the bin near him. he looked back to see dean had not moved. his head was rested against the metal and his ass was high in the air.
"i don't have mrs. grimm this semester, dingbat," cas insulted as his eyes wandered around the room. "besides, you're gonna do great."
"why do you care?" dean scoffed, finally looking another direction. "wouldn't have to look at you anymore if they did."
"there's suppose to be a big snow storm tonight," meg said as she stabbed her salad. she waved the fork around in the air before placing it in her mouth and adding with her mouth full, "you know what that means?"
dean's eyes went wide before they narrowed directly on castiel's. "you're fucking lucky there's people here, or my fist would be in your brain."
the rest of cas' school day was spent in in-school suspension with dean. the silence and angered stares between them was almost worse than the arguing. to be fair, at least cas wasn't going to be getting any more bruises. having a teacher in the room the whole time had one benefit, cas supposed.
there was no other exchange between them for the remaining hour, despite the teacher never returning. another person had to come in just to dismiss them. dean could not have hurried to leave the room any faster, but cas took some time to compose himself because he remembered that dean was still coming over to drop off sam.
cas pulled into the driveway carefully, as dean's stupid car sat directly in the middle. once the car was parked and turned off, cas sighed as his forehead met the leather steering wheel. his thoughts came at him like a truck on a freeway. his brain almost didn't seem to be working correctly throughout the entire day until this exact moment. dean, of course, was the only thing coming to mind, but at this point, if cas could have a moment without dean in his brain, he was proud of himself.
cas both enjoyed the secretiveness of the area, but he also wished he had someone he could experience it with. of course he could just show someone, but he never felt like it was a special enough occasion. he needed the moment to be perfect if he ever did reveal his safe place.
"you boys can't do things like that! you have detention after school, got it?" the teacher scolded, holding a hand out to cas. "i'm sorry, but you can't be tussling like that." dean said nothing as he walked away, his fists balled up tightly.
"wow, nice to see you again, too, cas," dean sneered sarcastically, but complied to the request. his heavy boots slammed down on the linoleum aggressively, almost ringing in castiel's ears.
castiel took the condom wrapper into his teeth and tore it before sliding it onto his length quickly. he walked over to the man before him as he opened the lube as well and coated a few fingers.
he felt eyes drilling him from the side of his skull, and he didn't have to look to know it was dean, it's always dean.
cas looked up at him and rolled his body so dean would fall off, or at least slip, so he could get away. once castiel was out from under him, he shoved the boy trying to stand up.
"again? they were gone for weeks last time. as much as i hate them, i miss them bothering us. they're soo much funnier than you," meg chuckled, earning a sarcastic grin from cas. "how is chuck just okay with them leaving all the time anyway?"
"were you not listening to us? he pushed me over a bench, and that's just from today! i've told you plenty of the cruel things he's done to me. it's quite obvious that he hates me, but that doesn't mean he's good," cas basically shouted, and quite aggressively at that.
"uhh, snowmen?" cas mumbled as he watched her eating. he had finished many minutes prior and just wanted to go sit somewhere else that wasn't buzzing with gross teenagers, but could you blame him? it could not be louder in the room.
"oh fuck off," cas rolled his eyes, standing up off the floor. he wiped the dust off his ass, but stared into dean's eyes the whole time. "try a little harder next time, yeah?"
castiel just smiled at him. dean grabbed cas' shoulders and shoved him into the locker again, their bodies flush to each other. dean's face was just inches away from cas', his hot breath tickling his nose slightly.
cas continued at a fairly quick pace, one hand on dean's thigh, the other in his hair, pulling it every dean had calmed from the last time. he moaned out at almost every thrust, so cas kept the speed and continued with dean's hair. he tangled his hand tighter and yanked on it harder than he had been, making dean cum upon the instant.
dean smirked as he looked away, but his eyes quickly narrowed back onto cas. he leaned forward, just by his ear, and whispered, "you're so fucked." after that, he simply let the smaller go and walked away to his seat.
cas' thursts were getting quicker by the minute, and he knew that he was getting closer and closer to going over the edge, but he couldn't cum first, most certainly not. how degrading would that be, cumming before the bitch getting bottomed?
cas sighed, pushing himself to stand up and actually look around, but he still saw nothing. his gaze turned to the window in time to catch what seemed to be a rock hitting the glass, making another noise.
cas simply rolled his eyes, turned around, and picked it up. he smirked as he watched dean walking to his own bag, limping slightly. at least he has this to hold over him.
and now this is how dean is going to take a simple "fuck you" anymore? yesterday wasn't suppose to be anything, it meant nothing. why does he need to bring it up?
more silence sat with them, cross-legged on the carpet, talking so much that they couldn't get a word in.
"not my problem," cas replied cockily, his eyes pinned to the tall brunette's. two can play at this game.
"i could shove my dick into you right now and show no mercy, so unless you want me to tear you a new one, shut your fucking mouth, got it?" cas hissed as he inserted another finger.
"don't fucking do that," dean groaned as he pressed his thumbs deeper into castiel's skin. "just do it already."
"did you hear yourself a few minutes ago?" cas rolled his eyes as bottomed out into dean. at this point, dean was biting his lip enough to turn the skin around his teeth white. "i haven't even started yet. i affect you that much?" cas teased, slowly starting to thrust.
truth is, cas definitely didn't want her to do anything to dean. it would take whatever feud they had and just amplify it beyond belief. he was fully capable of handling dean and all the shit he did, he has for the last three years anyway. meg getting involved would get way too messy.
coach was pissed, and dean could not have enjoyed it more. he took every chance he could to take a jab at cas, which was politely, or impolitely, returned. a never-ending cycle of who could come up with a better insult, it seemed. cas claimed the throne, whether he actually believed he deserved it or not.
cas groaned as he stared up at the beige ceiling, his eyes feeling like they were spinning. sleep was the last thing that cas seemed like he could achieve at the moment. sure, it was a friday night, so he didn't have to wake up early or anything, but he preferred to be up early enough to go on a jog to collect his thoughts. a weekly habit, he supposed.
the banter was cut down once they finally began, rather replacing it with the sound of skin colliding and grunts of pleasure. cas wasn't as worried about getting caught, mostly because there wasn't really anyone to catch them besides gabe, but there was still a lingering fear. they shouldn't be doing this, why were they? he still didn't know or understand the situation in the slightest.
it slid in rather easily, and dean didn't seem to be as bothered. he slid it in and out a few times before dean started to get impatient.
cas sat down in a seat a few columns away from dean, but still in the same row. his eyes watched the shorter the entire way to the seat, and the gaze turned to a glare the moment their eyes met. his eyes, despite being feet away, shined as brightly green as ever, almost in a teasing manner, almost showing that he was still a stereotypical attractive guy despite being one of the worst people on earth.
cas realized that it would be the first time he was going to fuck dean and actually getting to see his facial expressions as he did so. he will admit, dean isn't a bad looking guy, but just the fact that it was him was what made seeing him so bad.
"i'm glad. want me to- hold on," dean started before popping out on cas' side of the lockers. "want me to say it to your face? huh?"
he stood, stunned by the words, before shaking his head and making his way over to cas and grabbing his arm and ripping him from the floor. dean shoved castiel into the lockers and held him down by his shoulders, their faces close. he rolled his hips into cas' and leaned into his ear.
and now castiel has detention after school with dean. it wasn't the first time, but dean was ruthless during detention. he can somehow do something as simple as drop a pencil and get cas in trouble, which dean found absolutely hilarious. cas did not. and then after that, dean is coming over again. cas had no idea how to handle it. him being at his house was the reason they were in this mess in the first place.
castiel glared at him and rolled his eyes. "as if you would know. you don't know dean like i do. he is that bad."
"i told you not to fucking do it, you twat. what? do you want me to do it again?" dean grinned angerly.
"wow, it's almost like you did it," cas sarcastically smiled, eyes squinted. "do you want to give it a quick wittle kissy kissy?"
meg's eyebrows raised before one dropped lower and she questioned, "did he have a reason to be there or was he just waiting for you?"
okay, so maybe skipping practice wasn't the best idea after how bad it had been the day before, but cas could not handle going there after the fight in the locker room. they always fought, but it just felt different this time. he already knew dean would be pissed, he always is when cas skips, not that he does it much. he says that coach pays way too much attention to him when cas is gone and expects dean to play as well as an NBA star.
it was a terrible comeback. creative, but awful. he never was great with insults, he was better at just arguing with the blockhead.
"what's your fucking problem?" dean spat, standing up and shoving cas backward into the breakfast bar. "not everything is about you, okay? you think i wanted to come to your house?"
cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath before moving back inside, allowing dean to come in as well. "my room, that's it. don't let gabe see you here."
"i will, i'm sorry i didn't. i don't even know why i didn't." technically true. but cas was going to try his damnedest to find any technicality at this point. "hey, make me a pizza pretzel and then i'll give you a five dollar tip. then we can talk about whatever you want, just to make it up to you," i suggested.
the rocky roof above him was rather short, but tall enough for him to almost stand up under, though it couldn't be more than five feet high. it didn't go very far back either, just a couple feet, but it felt safe, and the view made up for the tightness.
cas sighed and looked at the ground. "coach made me stay late for yesterday, i'm sorry. we can still hang out while you work though."
when he was just a kid, he decided to explore one day and happened to find a cove on the edge of a cliff hidden behind a ton of bushes and trees. it was one of his favorite discoveries, and became the spot he went to whenever he needed to be alone. he never told anyone about it, not even meg, and she knows everything. well, almost everything.
"the less of you in my mouth, the better. including your filthy name." dean's eyes were now focused on his phone once again as cas started walking slightly closer.
"but we aren't done," sam sighed as he looked at gabe. he turned his attention to cas and looked at the floor. "we're coming back tomorrow, okay? we have to finish this. please just get along, or just don't talk."
dean rolled his eyes and leaned back in his chair, head back as far as it would go. cas silently laughed to himself as he went back to the piece of paper that sat on top of the table, not a single thing on it.
castiel removed his fingers, earning a dissatisfied grunt. he rolled the condom on and slathered the rest of the lube on himself before lining up to dean's hole. he pressed the tip in and couldn't help but to let out a sound due to the tightness.
cas began to scan the packed room, just people watching, a hobby he and meg enjoyed. their favorite was clothing shops in the mall. even through the crowd, castiel's eyes locked onto dean's.
there he sat, just the same as before. his feet were propped up on the dining table as he did whatever he was doing on his phone. "get your feet off the table, you fucking rat."
dean let out a single laugh as he rolled his eyes, walking over to the bed. cas met him there and began to undo his belt and unbutton his jeans. "you gonna let me suck you off?"
"what the..." he mumbled, walking over and peering out. dean stood outside, looking at rocks in castiel's driveway, a flashlight in hand. "that little shit."
Faint traces of Petrichor lingered, the familiar scent of her brother, but no other Alpha scent pervaded the house.  She blinked in confusion. Even if Sam Winchester was not in the house, his scent pile should have pervaded the walls and, as Alphakin, she was
Castiel dropped flat and rolled sideways off the sarcophagus, dropping behind it more heavily than he’d intended, courtesy of the bullet that grazed his forehead as he fell.
,” Gan replied dryly.  “So why do you let him do it? ‘Cos I guess you could just fire his ass, right? Replace him with a bigger, badder Alpha?”
“Surely there is a middle ground,” Castiel suggested tentatively. “A way to find safety without caging ourselves away from the world?”
His desire to have a garden far exceeded his knowledge about the subject. Although he’d grown up in a house with a yard worthy of gracing a magazine, his mother had hired a landscaping company to produce and maintain the effect she required. Castiel’s primary childhood memories were of being forbidden to even walk on the grass. After college, finances and convenience had dictated he rented an apartment rather than a house and, despite his moderate publishing success having nicely padded his bank balance, he was still living in that same apartment when Amelia’s eventual ultimatum that he committed to marrying her had led to his current situation.
Still, he shrugged his supposed disappointment off easily enough because he immediately invited Castiel to accompany him to Trianolis so his wounds could be treated. The Mer City was in an Easterly direction anyway, he assured Castiel. “So perhaps I am not going to be lucky myself but, who knows? It might be that your true mate is one of my people. At the least, you should come check out our royalty for yourself. Most of them are a little too interbred if you know what I mean. Not to the point they have two tails or three eyes but, sheesh, they’re dumb. Couple of them are real pretty though. I mean I wouldn’t say ‘no’ to them myself. Just don’t expect any scintillating conversation.”
He probably needed to check all of the pipework in the house, because if one pipe had failed, others would inevitably follow suit, but he couldn’t stay there at all without heat so, for now, he just wanted the water to run out of the heating system so that the pipe would cool enough for him to repair it before the Aga finally burned through its existing fuel and shut itself down completely.
. As the years passed, it became increasingly difficult for Cain to continuously maintain the preservation of Richard’s body during those idle times. Cain could become distracted, just for an hour or two, and when he returned his attention again, Richard’s body would have moved into a state of decomposition. It reached the point that every morning, Cain would need to spend hours repairing the damage caused by his distraction during the night before.
The Deltazoids, for instance, had good reason to pour scorn on the Federal motto of ‘All United For All’.  They, like many dispossessed species, had found little welcome within the Federation once their ability to contribute materially to the Alliance ceased.  Homeless, powerless, without currency or influence, their millennia-long history of supporting the Alliance was soon forgotten and those few tens of thousands who escaped the fatal freeze of their dying sun found no refuge or welcome on worlds that had been, in eons past, considered allies or even friends.
“They call it ‘Black Friday’ for a reason, you know,” Dean continued, totally straight-faced. “That’s why all use of the ‘company that cannot be named’ has been banned in Heron’s Cove. All the resultant blood and body-parts breach a local anti-littering by-law.”
”Exactly,” Dean agreed. “Neither of us are qualified to tell the Wolfkin how they should behave. But we have the right to choose not to be complicit in behavior that we
He took a deep gasping breath, trying to steady himself.  Where the hell was all this resentment coming from? Why was he so angry with
”I was fourteen,” Dean pointed out, irritably, and then Bobby had witnessed his first bitch-fight between the brothers.
Castiel had been waiting ten years for his twenty-first birthday, with an equal amount of dread and anticipation.
They were waiting for him outside, a quiet solemn group.  Sam, at least, appeared to have been healed by Castiel again, as he was standing upright at the angel’s feet. It didn’t look like any of them knew what to say.
For a brief moment she looked pleased with the idea, but then her eyes narrowed and she regarded him with suspicion.  “If it’s so great an idea, why would you want to help me get there? That’s what makes no sense to me. The Reaper told me that I could hitch a ride out of here on one of you, but he never adequately explained
that food is comfort, you know? Makes me feel good. Safe. Happy. Nothing else matters much to me. A bed is a bed, a room is a room, clothes are clothes. As long as something serves its purpose, it’s good enough. It don’t need bells and whistles. But food? That’s kinda different. I guess I need to know it’s just always going to be available. That’s all. I eat because it’s there, but I know it might not always be the case. I don’t so much eat because I’m hungry, but because I’m scared I
“Yup, and that makes no sense to me.  It would have made sense if he had precognition. Or, at least, if
So Katherine Harrison left Westchester in 1672, and was rumored to have died around 1682 somewhere near Wethersfield, although no grave marker exists for her.
“She’s very full-on,” Dean said, “But she’s kinda like the little sister I never wanted but managed to acquire anyway. Irritating as hell sometimes but I’d still punch the lights out of anyone who gives her shit.”
“Eve thought he was an odious man, too,” Amara said, with a shrug, “but you know exactly why I did it. Cain raised a new set of Bearer Instruments in Vincente’s name, just in case Sam Winchester fails to ‘kill’ me. Vince, bless him, handed them to
One day in the future it would be the rotting hull of their ship into which a young merpup might venture in search of ghosts.
“Isn’t that, um, going to feel like a prison? Just sitting there waiting to get summoned in and out of my stock cupboard like a lamp-genie?”
”Well, sure,” Gan agreed easily. “But I was already living as a Creiche when I first had one, and except for stealing the odd bite off Sam’s plate, I had never really eaten meat at all. So, trust me, my first ever hotdog was like manna from heaven. And they were cheap and tasted good, and when we didn’t have
you, and trust me that’s what would happen under the circumstances, all she’ll inherit are your avatar’s original 15 levels. The Boss rankings would die with you. And if she isn’t a ‘boss’, she isn’t a Knight, and if she isn’t a Knight she still can’t initiate the fight with Cain.  So, nope, it can’t be done.”
language for universal communication, and he believed pronounced regional accents were tiresome enough to deal with without the addition of lexicons such as Cajun and Creole.
“She just went poof,” Charlie said. “Awesome. Bet he can take Crowley out with his little finger too. Let’s go gank the Boss guy.”
Frank hadn’t made a mistake per se. Despite stopping in a tourist campsite where holiday makers were liable to take snapshots of everything and anyone, Frank and ‘his’ boys had still somehow totally escaped any permanent record of their presence. Frank had also painstakingly removed himself from all the records of both himself and his vehicle being subject to automatic police investigation when a tiny girl went missing from the camper several lots down from his parking spot. Just as he’d erased all records of the incident itself.
Dean felt an uncomfortable pressure building up behind his eyes. He was damned if he would give in to the tears, even though he couldn’t help being ridiculously touched by the kind, though pointless offer. “I appreciate the sentiment, guys, but you’re both missing the obvious problem.”
The Dobycha sneered at him. “Well since I ain’t gonna give you diddly squat, the outcome’s pretty obvious. I ain’t gonna tell you where them boys are. I don’t know. Haven’t heard from them in a couple of years anyway and wouldn’t tell ya if I had. So get it over with. If you’re gonna kill me, just damned well kill me. Don’t bore me to death first.”
“It’s a new game setting,” Charlie told him hurriedly, deciding it was too late to be coy about it. “It’s not public knowledge yet but, yeah, demons are a 'thing' now.”
“He can’t hear me,” Gabriel scoffed. “Ooh… does he always turn that shade of scarlet when he’s mad or is it allergies?”
, obviously, but he had hoped at least for a mild buzz.  Disappointingly, as a Rank 2 boss, his avatar seemed to shrug off any effects of the alcohol even faster than he could consume it.
If anyone were privy to the childhood memories that lurked within Fergus MacLeod’s head, they might have suspected he was some genuine form of undead being like a vampire or a demon because anyone seeing the dangerous and filthy conditions of the slum he was raised in would surely believe he was born several hundred years earlier.
He regretted mentioning the name as soon as he did so. His aching head was joined instantly by a thrumming pulse throughout his whole body. A demand he should race to Dean’s side and protect, protect, protect. He pushed the feelings down impatiently. Dean was fine. Dean was safe. Castiel knew this urgent, painful call was just his body trying to trick him into charging to Dean’s side.
Castiel sighed, stretched his legs inside his slightly itchy, salt-pitted pants, and made himself as comfortable as he could on the hard, wooden, kitchen chair. He had a feeling this was going to be a very long conversation.
The white wolf released its prize, and leapt for the matriarch, its teeth sinking into her neck and fastening tight. She staggered backwards, the white wolf hanging from her throat, blood pouring down her neck and she danced in place, sweeping her head and neck from side to side, swinging the white wolf wildly, even as the lame Elk staggered to its feet and, back leg dragging, limped painfully in the direction of the fleeing herd.
“Try to keep up,” Castiel said, airily. “While you were busy doing your charm offensive and rounding up the Clans, Bobby and I have organized a two-stage migration. You need to pick 60-odd of the strongest warriors to come with us to get Bouvet ready. It’s a long way from here and we expect it to be pretty inhospitable at the minute. We figure it’ll take a month or two to get it ready for initial occupation, and then some of us will obviously have to come back to escort the others down. So the second migration is scheduled for three months later. We’re expecting the second group will take twice as long traveling, because of the pups and the oldsters. Even so, all the clans will be just about settled in our new home before the storm season hits these waters.”
“What about the hallowed ground idea?” Penelope asked. “That sounds easier than digging a trench anyway.”
He walked up to her and called her name in a brisk shout. She turned around and cocked an eyebrow at him. Dean grabbed her by the shirt collar and smashed her against the wall.
Cas evidently got said memo because he opened his mouth as well and tilted his head to lick in. Cas brought his hands up and cupped Dean's bruised cheeks to deepen the kiss. Dean brought his arms behind Cas’s neck and leaned back on the chair and wall behind him. Cas continued his exploration of every inch of Dean’s mouth he could reach.
Soon they start up with one of their fan favorite songs, which is welcomed with loud applause from the onlookers. Dean once again leans into the mic to begin singing. And he does. But instead of hearing himself projected into the crowd, he hears his keyboardist singing into her mic that was supposed to be for back up singing.
“Why you?” Dean blurts out, “you’re probably the worst person to explain something to anyone!” Castiel just stares at him for a bit.
He kissed the bruises on Dean’s ribs from when he was kicked on the ground. Dean winced.It didn’t hurt that much, but she had a powerful kick and he hurt the most in the area.
“Because you’re hurt,” Cas finishes up on Dean's face and pulls up his shirt to check out the bruises on his torso. “I think you’re all patched up.” Cas claps his hands “Did I miss anything?”
“We had agreed to teach you a lesson,” Castiel said simply “there isnot much else to it.” He continued to stare at Dean who didn’t really know how to respond to that.
“Fuck yes,” Dean leaned his head back as Cas slowly unzipped his jeans. Cas pulled Dean’s pants and underwear down enough to expose Dean’s now fully hard cock.
Cas continued his slow pace for a bit longer before fulfilling Dean’s request. Cas reached around to Dean’s cock and began to pump him in time with his trusts. Dean knotted his fingers into his hair and moaned as softly as he could manage in his situation.
Dean didn’t care much about Cas’s experience, just about kissing him at this point. He was a simple man, a live in the moment kind of guy, the kind of guy who will kiss you and will gladly leave it at that, but would much rather fuck or get fucked by you afterwards.
After a few more drinks on both parts they were both officially drunk. Cas just blinked heavily as Dean rambled on about some strange string of thoughts running through his mind. The bar had become considerably less occupied at this point, and those who were still there were far from sober, Dean and Cas included.
“That doesn’t mean you won’t receive any consequences for it,” the two stared at each other for some time. Dean tsked, he didn’t know what else to say. “Have you learned your lesson?” Castiel tilted his head in the adorable way he does.
Cas gave him some water to rinse out his mouth once he had finished emptying his stomach. He was much less drunk than Dean, but not exactly fully sober either.
Cas looked up at him, concerned. God, that look seemed to care about him so much. “Just hurts a bit more there.” Dean flared his nostrils a bit as he spoke.
Dean stepped onto the stage. He waved out to the vast audience waiting for him as the lights above him gleamed and the crowd cheered out his name. It was always exhilarating to perform at a concert. The way the crowd yelled out his name like he was some kind of god, it was his favorite thing.
Cas has never felt this before. Sure he had masterbated, but being inside Dean felt like heaven. He was so warm around him and he could feel his inside move around him as he gently pushed in.
Dean didn’t really know what to do. He didn’t want Cas to go away, but he didn’t have anything else hurting him at the moment that Cas hadn’t already treated.
He didn’t believe in love at first sight or some bullshit like that, but this was pretty fucking close.
Dean pulled away and began grinding into Cas, who gasped in response. “Cmon Cas…” he murmured in a deeper voice than normal “teach me a fuckin lesson.” He slammed his lips into Cas’s, more forcefully this time. Also this time, Cas kissed back. He wasn’t anywhere near as experienced at kissing as Dean seemed to be, but he tried his best.
Cas grabbed the bottle and took a small sip, looked at the opening, then took a larger gulp. Dean smiled at Cas. He wasn’t sure why, but he felt proud of himself for getting Cas to drink something.
The love of his life was sitting in the front of the class like always. Except someone just couldn’t leave him alone.
He usually loved the attention, but he was feeling off tonight. He told himself it was because of the embarrassment, but that explanation didn’t seem right. He stuck with it for sanity’s sake though.
Her face was fucked up and his hands were bloody. He wasn’t in the best shape either. Far from it really. But just as he swung his fist back someone hiked their arms under his elbows and lifted him up.
“Cause you’re staring at me like-“ Dean couldn’t think of a good work “like- that” he gestures vaguely around the room.
“You’re a nice guy Cas,” Dean slurred and slung his arms over Cas’s shoulders and looked him in the eyes with a pleasant smile.
Cas lifted Dean’s other hand and kissed each knuckle with the same loving tenderness as the first hand. Dean was blushing quite a bit at this point.
Castiel just stares at him again. It’s like his eyes are looking straight into his soul, reading every microsecond of emotion that passes through his brain. They stare at each other for a while, eventually Dean looks away with a slight blush.
Dean nodded vigorously, his eyes wide. “Ok,” Cas mumbled and sucked on his fingers for an improvised lube. He slid 2 digits in and started to finger Dean open. Once he thought Dean was open enough, Cas added a third finger.
“I will,” what a weird response, but it’s not like Dean was complaining. He was getting fucked. By Cas. Fucking Cas. Hell yeah.
Everyone got in their positions for the performance. But Dean stayed at the edge of the stage longer than necessary. Why shouldn’t he? They love him.
Once a concert filled with awkward glances and guitar playing on his part, and abnormal normality on everyone else's part had ended, and they had all walked into the lounge, he confronted them.
His band walked out behind him to lesser cheers, waving awkwardly to the masses. He wasn’t particularly close with any of them. Why would he be? They’re just coworkers. He wasn’t going to believe any of the bullshit other lead singers say. The only reason anyone has a background band is so they can make money. No other reason.
“Yes but...” Dean looked away embarrassed, he was a bit hesitant to admit he was a masochist, “I-it’s fine”
Dean began a glare at him but was interrupted but Castiel speaking up “I can explain,” he glanced around the room “that’s what we agreed on, correct?” The others nodded in affirmation and began to move out of the main room to god knows where.
The bartender didn’t seem to know who he was, or at least they didn’t show they did, which was appreciated.
Cas hiked Dean’s leg and slid his hand under Dean's shirt, running his hand up his chest and now hardening nipples. Dean brought his hands down to undo Cas’s tie and began unbuttoning his dress shirt.
Cas, a bit confused but spirited nonetheless, obliged and started to slide into Dean’s now well stretched hole. Dean should bottom more often. Once Cas was all the way in Dean began to bounce impatiently, to which Cas slowly pulled out.
“I like you ya know,” Dean was going off again “I like you a lot.” He grinned in Cas’s face. Cas just stared at him, he didn’t really know how to respond to that. Dean tilted his head to the side and looked at Cas’s mouth. “Can I kiss you?” He giggled.
Dean to win? Maybe this whole ‘righteous’ thing that Chuck is doing with him is pissing off the management.”
Crowley rolled his eyes. “Damnit. Forgot about my own dampeners.” He waved his hands dramatically, then said. “Try now.”
accident,” Dean allowed.  “I’d just crashed and burned. Of course I took the first opportunity to get the hell outta there and save what was left of my goddamned pride. But none of it was his fault. Hell, I don’t think it’s either of our faults. It’s just a sucky situation without a solution and I refuse to hit my head against a brick wall. Better to just call it quits.”
“You definitely can’t directly summon any other Angels with them,” Gabriel said. “I know that’s a fixed rule because you can only pray to Castiel. The rules had to be written that way, otherwise you’d have had the ability to influence the V.I.s inside the other Knights.”
“Ah, of course,” Sam agreed, hoping his expression was neutral despite his urge to offer Cas a high-five.
“The L’Astrolabe docked in Vantaxian yesterday. Michael Hortlan was waiting for it. One of the crew members identified Dean from a photo, confirmed that he was on board and that he alighted on Tsaluna. Hortlan has sent a formal request to the Tsaluna High Court to acknowledge his claim on your Subplex, and a formal alert to the immigration officials to prevent Dean fleeing before he arrives to collect him. Allowing for a couple of hours of bureaucratic bullshit, by mid-morning tomorrow, every Tsalun City Guard is going to be combing the city for him.
How had Dean forgotten that? How had he let himself get so turned around by his horror of how Omegas were perceived by the Wolfkin that he had begun to see Castiel as nothing more than a predatory, misogynistic Alpha bastard who wanted to ‘own’ him like some trophy wife?
Panicked, he tried to scramble to his feet but his movements were awkward and uncoordinated since his lungs were still struggling to replenish themselves.
Castiel narrowed his eyes at his brother. “Haven’t you just given me a tiresome lecture on how there’s no need to compensate Hunter Mountain for damage they
Dean smirked as he listened to his brother angrily driving the Betas away. He had no idea what was going on. He also had no idea, even, of what was wrong with him. But, as he attached the fluid and allowed the electolyte-rich saline to drip into his veins, he decided that, no matter the ultimate outcome, nothing was going to take away from his delight in witnessing Sam’s wolf snarling and snapping and howling to protect him.
The pretty Deltazoid, Meg, was waiting for him when he arrived at Infernum and he felt momentarily guilty that he hadn’t thought to let her know sooner that Dey’n was safe. Fortunately, she was so relieved to see him that she waved off his apologies as soon as he assured her that Dey’n had survived the experience barely scathed.
He had considered and dismissed the idea of climbing up into the belltower of the plaza.  For one thing, it was a handgun, not a rifle. A shot fired from so high might easily miss the target.  Besides, Crowley needed to actually reveal himself to Cain. He needed Cain to be cocky and confident. To be absolutely certain that Dean was still a Rank 3 when he stepped inside the Central Building to the final confrontation.
In the worst possible scenario, with Gan knowing only oppression and rejection, with Castiel conscious of little more than pain, with imminent death hanging over
But then the ship gave another violent shudder and the floor tilted several degrees, knocking him off his feet and tossing him to the floor in a tangle of flailing limbs.
The Beta narrowed his eyes and frowned at her thoughtfully.  "You're talking about some serious hacking."
“Although that is interesting and probably explains why he is so willing to assist Cain at this juncture given the longevity of their relationship, I fail to understand the significance regarding the numbers.”
‘Minion’ usually meant ‘Bait’ and almost inevitably resulted in whichever player was acting the role getting killed. A normal low level player could afford the odd demise since no death debuffs applied until a character level reached 15. Unlike a normal player, Dean only had 10 lives to lose.
Because they had both been awake (save for some napping in the car) in either human or wolf form for well-over forty-eight hours it was no surprise that they both slept through the night peacefully without either Wolf attempting to disturb their sleep.
look like a lightning bolt on crack. He didn’t say so, though, since Loki was bad enough without any added encouragement.
If they were successful, the flames wouldn’t only risk Dean’s life, they might drive him out of the building to meet Cain in the Plaza instead of inside the controlled environment of the Hall. That would also prevent them from activating the spell to burn the Plaza. Which, in turn, would also remove their ability to deal with the demons trapped between the salt lines.
Maybe it was the location. The soothing sight of the sea. The sometimes absolute quiet of near perfect privacy. The absence of Amelia.
Charlie continued to stare at him uncomprehendingly for a moment before the penny dropped. “You think we’re in danger?”
”That makes a surprising amount of sense,” Gabriel agreed. He looked at the destruction around them and sighed. “At least I can get some Pok back to start clearing all of this mess up.”
birthday that day, he probably had every justification for his bitterly morose attitude.  A less charitable one might equally point out that since it had been over 15 years since Teddy had perished in his mother’s womb a mere month before his due date, and so, whilst any man was entitled to grieve over his lost wife and son, there was something a little too uncomfortably self-indulgent about Pellegrino’s persistent, and frequently aggressive, melancholic wallowing in his grief.
“Where’s the fire?” Dean asked, rolling his eyes sarcastically, as his brother’s face appeared on the laptop screen. He felt it was a bit ironic that he’d emerged from his immersion rig to be greeted by not less than 22 messages demanding he called Sam ‘immediately’. Considering Sam had been ducking and diving his
“Damn,” Charlie cursed. “You mean we’ve been looking for two males instead of a boy and a girl and that’s why we can’t locate them?”
use the tank in the first place. Neither of them is going to say no, are they? It’s in their interest to keep me sweet.”
It made it far easier for him to sweep into the part of the School that provided a subsidized treatment clinic, identify himself and demand assistance for his charge.
“I made a point of stressing to the realtor how excited I was to be buying a property with such a large yard. I even mentioned my intention to encourage a wildflower meadow to encourage bees and butterflies. Maybe she told the neighbor to leave well enough alone.”
But watching Gan drive, enjoying the unusual position of being nothing more than a passive - if slightly stressed - spectator, undisturbed by the constant interruptions of his normal life in which there was a constant input of issues to resolve, disputes to settle and decisions to be made, Castiel had time to think about the
Was that what it was all about, really? The Fourth of July party? Did everyone think Castiel had called the cops out of either spite or sexual frustration because his apparently irresistible neighbor had so far failed to invite Castiel to either his party or his bed?
“And you can shut the fuck up too,” he snapped at Oswald who had returned to the kitchen to warm himself in front of the Aga now that the floor had been mopped dry.
For the first time since the whole Knights of Hell debacle had started, Dean actually enjoyed ‘playing’ the game.  Mounted on Baby and Goldie, the pair of them galloped around the town, whooping and hollering like cowboys as they rounded up the Rabids that Benny flushed out of the outlying houses and drove them into the center of town.
Was it even possible to describe what he had done as ‘dominating’ when his entire performance had been completely orchestrated by his so-called submissive?  There had only been one person in control in that room, and it hadn’t been the one with the inhuman strength and ‘magical smitey superpowers’.
Ironically, considering he had access to every schedule of drugs listed by the FDA, Gabriel’s drug of choice wasn’t even illegal.
a game. To use an analogy, Moondoor is just acting as a chessboard on which a game is being played. You and the other Knights are just some of the game pieces.”
”Honestly? If I was a Wolfkin I would have eaten their hearts. Castiel doesn’t know it, but the Pok they shot, the girl who died, she was my boo.”
visited you in 1994 when he turned eighteen.  There was a two month period - directly before he mated Samuel Campbell’s daughter - when he dropped off the map completely. In that same two month period the ‘Argus Leader’ reported two separate incidents of wolf-sightings in this area. Sightings of a particularly large gray wolf with unusual black mask markings. Which happens to be the same appearance that John Winchester's wolf reputedly had. And, since John was four years old when his sire died, I suspect he already knew who you were and where you lived. Even if he waited until he was fully grown to track you down.”
“You don’t want people to write about us, as they wrote about Castor and Dey’hahn?” Cas queried lightly, tracing a gentle finger against Dean’s silky flesh until he shuddered in response.
“Do you really think I give a fuck about rules?” Cain demanded, laughing with genuine amusement. “Do you honestly believe I spent all those years running RRE without getting someone to write me a loophole? I suggest you tell that piece of amputated angel in your head to move the fuck out, right now because I’m coming in, boy, whether you like it or not and there sure as shit ain’t room for both of us in
You misunderstand. I am referring to the fact that you have not once expressed any anger or dismay over your
