Yama said, “All right, let’s go see Delek. John I think you should get something to eat and go back to your room. He’ll be safe with me.”
These will randomly appear when I get an idea in my head that won't go away.
She turned to Simion who looked like he was about to wet himself. His cock was still exposed but it had serious shrunk.
Jim answered the door to find Sherlock on the stoop looking at the steps and the ground around it.
“Don’t bother to talk,” said John, “We have paralyzed your vocal cords for now. You are here to listen and understand what your life will be now. Sherlock and Jim are your new owners and they will train you to be good doggies for us. After I think you are ready, you will be returned to here and start earning money for us as pets that we will lend out and you have no say in the matter.”
They had seen two other men but only in shadow.
I looked at the face and saw the eyes of my Master staring at me vacantly and I knew no more.
“Do not remove your blindfolds until instructed,” a familiar voice said.
He gently took my hand in his and said, “I lost my temper. I….I didn’t know what to do. Knowing that I almost lost you due to my foolishness and headstrong will. I would have followed you into the abyss if I had found out. I almost did.”
“How so Holmes?” I asked being dubious that this would amount to anything.
John said,” He is indeed. He’s our good boy.”
I stomped my foot as a signal and the monks came in and took me out all the time Holmes pleading with them to leave him alone.
“Holmes?” I asked.
Greg grinned ear to ear and nodded so hard that John was afraid his head was going to fall off.
I nodded looking towards the door. I could see the shadow of feet in front of the door.
Comments are encouragement. Feedback helps me figure out if I am getting the story across or if I missed something.
-_-_-_-_-_-
It was whispered that when they found the Count and his wife that his cock had been cut off and sew onto her and they were found buried in an embrace with his cock up his own ass. There were other stories of what had been done to the servants who were killed and the wounds that were found on the bodies.
We hid in a cave that had a pool of fresh water in it. Pason and Zaram used brush and bushes to hid where we were. There was enough room for the horses who needed to be taken care of. Pason went to take care of the horses while Zaram helped me get Holmes off of Lucy and stretched out on a bedroll covered by the blanket we had wrapped Holmes in.
I stood up to go but saw a look of such sadness on his face like he had lost all hope and joy in his life. Just as quickly his face shifted back to his usual public mask.
Holmes nodded, “I know.”
Ok I have been playing around with this scene for almost a month and decided for the simpler version of it.
John gave him a look that had him squirming in his seat as much as Jim was.
He turned back and found me there pushing him to follow his master into the next life.
Yama nodded, “So Dr. Watson you got us to this point, how should we play this one out?”
I looked at the collar around his neck and saw a brass plate with engraving that read “Property of J. M.”
“Someone else? Holmes it is all you. Fragmented or not each piece is a part of you. Some more scary than others. Some very damaged still. But you have been working with Delek and Yama and they feel that you have turned the corner on all this. You haven’t had an incident in over two weeks.”
I hope this piece works.
Finally he calmed down.
Can't promise a chapter a day but that is my goal.
“I have a son,” he said quietly, “I have a son.”
Mycroft watched as they tilted the table back and placed a cloth over Sherlock’s face. He could see his brother’s breathing pick up as he felt what was happening to him. One masked man picked up a watering can that was next to the table and started pouring the water onto the cloth.
I hope that you will keep reading but I will understand if you have to tap out on this.
He shifted and cleared his throat.
They left taking the urinal with them and the door slammed shut as the lights went off.
“You have the steadier hands of the two of us,” he said.
“It’s nothing,” I said.
Toby seemed startled and discombobulated. He finally focused on Sherlock.
“That bill of sale was for Johan Sigerson not Shirley.” I said.
“If you want to do this properly, you need Mary. This is not a game Holmes. I take my servitude very seriously. I am a slave both body and soul. You are a Master who has to learn to mimic what is ingrained in my whole being. It’s not a sex holiday.”
It was totally by accident that I found buried in the back of a drawer a torn piece of a letter of introduction that had a name on it, Sebastian Moran. This had to be Seb that was at the auction.
He stood up and came over to me. He took my hand and led me to the bench.
I drank from the spring and came back to Sherlock staring daggers at me.
I whined a bit because I was so close too. He commanded me to stand up and then took me to the cold pool and tossed me in cooling my ardor immediately.
Sherlock picked up the hood from on top of the cage where Seb had left it.
I pulled on my clothing and scratched at my beard.
The longer we went, the more docile he seemed to become but I didn’t trust him an inch.
Delek stood up with Yama’s help. They bowed to us and started to leave.
I tried to answer but could only carefully nod. My head felt like it might break if I moved it too quickly.
I put his sales collar on with his number in the auction and whispered in his ear, “Come back to me.”
“No, he is my responsibility,” came the reply. I leaned into my Master’s chest listening to the rumble of his voice.
He helped John out of the tub and dried him off. John again found his hands slapped if he tried to help.
John searched his mind. He remembered something about this but it was the rebuttal paper.
I watched until I knew that Sherlock was asleep. I dozed most of the night but never really went to sleep.
Every night we would let him up and walk around. Then we would spike and lock him securely and take turns keeping an eye on him.
“Strong will,” he replied.
He lay down on the table and I proceeded to massage his long frame paying special attention to various knots and muscle groups that seemed tight. It also gave me a good long look at the damage that had been inflicted on him and it was not pretty. Many of the wounds and bruises were mostly healed but I could see scars where the corset had dug into his body and other scars some of which I knew what instrument had been used to inflict them and some I had no idea.
What really happened between Holmes and Moriarty and the subsequent consequences will probably never see the light of day. It almost cost one man his mind and another his life but I feel I must chronicle what happened for my own peace of mind or I might go mad myself. Or maybe I already have gone considering the loss and heartache that this part of our history together.
They stopped for a moment to refill the watering can and give Sherlock a moment to breath like he gave Jim a moment to breath and panic about the next move.
I hope that this satisfies and entices.
Moran grinned an evil grin and opened his trousers pulling out his rather massive cock. You have heard the phrase hung like a horse? Well that phrase was made for him. I had never seen such length and girth outside of animals in the zoo.
Enjoy.
The sounds coming from his mouth were sinful and wanton.
He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and got into bed with me. There were some adjustments and then we settled into each other’s arms.
John yelped at the pain radiating from his hand through his arm. He decided to play it up and squeezed a few tears from his eyes, “Please don’t hurt me! I don’t know anything!”
Sherlock handed John’s phone to Wiggins after unlocking it. Wiggins handed it to another young lad who plugged it into the audio-visual system for the room.
He rolled up his sleeve showing his bare arm and the scarring from needles. The scars were both old and new.
“Strip,” came the order and I did as I was bade to do. The clothing went into a cloth bag.
Yama stepped back so he could see me.
So they are reunited. I got them this far but we have quite a journey to go.
I heard a sound from behind me. Moriarty had worked herself to a sitting position and had almost gotten one hand free. I took more rope and ensured that she was secure. Moran was coming to.
“I order you to help me up,” I said in a very controlled voice.
Everyone at the room looked at me. The two on the couch with shock. Mycroft with distaste. Sherlock with disappointment.
She shook her head. He slapped her with a ringing slap that echoed through the hall.
“But not by much. The question is who’s side are these people on? The law or our captors.”
“Yes, I think I might today John. Thank you,” came that voice rumbling in his ear. “And might I say, you smell delicious.”
I had no idea what he was talking about but it did not leave me with a good feeling.
“Upon his death Mycroft which, according to you, hasn’t happened yet.”
We were in France finishing up a case for the government when we got a telegram from Mycroft that we had to return to England immediately.
I found myself being gently held.
These are very mature stories. There will be sex and there will be slick. I will update tags as I see fit.
Mary got up and poured me a measure of scotch. She knelt next to me smoothly and offered me the glass.
“This is from two subordinates that have really screwed up. Interpol apparently intercepted a shipment that included a courier packet with the names of the family currently living in London. The packet has to be extracted before it is found,” said Sherlock handing the papers to Seb.
“It’s not that….” He trailed off and squirmed against his bonds.
Alexia waited his turn and then took her ass hard. They all pulled out leaving her dripping with cum out of all her orifices and gasping for breath.
“In a monastery in the mountains of Tibet Mr. Holmes,” said Yama as he ended the room “How you got here is Dr. Watson’s place to tell you. You have a loyal servant in that one.”
“So we were out for more than a day,” I said, “which means that they dosed us more than once.”
I threw the cup against the fireplace and it exploded into a million shards.
I hugged Mary and said, “I can’t believe it!”
“Now time is of the essence,” hissed Zaram, “The next patrol will probably be making the rounds soon.”
Thanks for sticking with this story and I hope I continue to entertain.
Moran came into my vision and said, “I have been informed it is time for your private tutoring. You are privileged indeed to have been picked for this highest of honors.”
“Do you know why I bought you?”
I put the items back in front of him and put the blindfold back on him.
“Not enough time. Now you are going to place your menu over the envelope and my associate is going to bring you bread.”
“That’s my good Pet.”
There was a rapid discussion between the people in the room.
Until October, this is going to be erratic at best and I ask your patience.
Seb found himself dropping to his knees as well.
“I’m not gay,” he muttered.
They took another hypodermic and inserted it in my vein. I could feel the pain leaving my body and a feeling of euphoria. I smiled and thank them for their kindness.
“Not yet,” he said.
This went on for a number of hours. Each time I passed out, I was revived and the demonstration was started again.
“Johan, did you do anything to entice this man?”
I went to bed and heard Holmes stir and mumble, “Watson, what would I do without you?”
“Open your eyes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How shall we go rescue our boys?”
“James is what to you? What was our agreement? What does it say in your contract? What have you sworn and forsworn to do? Where does your allegiance ally?” Mycroft walked towards me and I could see his hand swing back. I braced myself for the strike that I knew would be coming.
‘Amateurs’ thought Holmes, “You might get me the object I am seeking” he said smoothly while signaling Sharky that this was one of the men.
Zaram apparently heard the noise too because he popped his head and said, “We need to get a move on.”
“Good old Watson, all down to business. I suggest we come up with a reason for the two of us to vacate London for a while and go to the continent so we can begin.”
John’s face came back into focus, “You know what is next don’t you?”
I saw that he had prepared himself and there was the glass plug keeping him open for me.
“I am sure you will do what you need to do but Sherlock he’s not that wrong. It was in very bad taste,” started Mycroft before Sherlock cut him off.
I placed a hand on his bare shoulder, “Let’s try it again.”
“Eat?” asked Sherlock, “Oh no sir. I am not allowed to eat. I am too fat.”
This time when the door opened a new face came through it.
He poured a cup of water from a pitcher on the table next to him. He helped me sit up a bit before putting the cup to my lips. I was shaking from the effort of just sitting up. I tried to drink but only managed really to wet my lips.
Sherlock carefully helped John to the floor and bunched John’s jumper under his head. He wrapped his arms and legs around John and sniffed at John’s neck.
I abased myself on the floor in front of him and said, “I shall do as you ordered.”
Mary continued to work for her Mistress. There was a lot of work to be done as the house was being packed away or sent to India ahead of them. She had been put in charge of getting the children ready for such a big change in their lives.
“I had Wilson sedate you and we kept someone with you at all times to keep you from doing something foolish.”
“He is ready,” I argued, “He has been himself for a while now. The nightmares are few and far between. He has even gone back to being my master.”
I put the gag back in Sherlock’s mouth. That didn’t stop the noises coming from his throat.
“What is the treatment? You keep going on about it but I haven’t a clue what you are talking about.”
“Come on in Sherl and let’s see if we can start to figure this out.”
Lestrade made sure the cameras were off and went to delete the video each had shot of the two men.
We were hauled off to jail again with much ceremony and rotten produce tossed at us. We shouted our innocence and that we were being unjustly punished. That Moran was the criminal not us! That just goaded the crowd to throw harder and shout back to us all kinds of slurs and insults.
She let go of my head and walked over to where Winston was kneeling, “You do really want to take his punishment don’t you? Why? Did he suck you off?”
“Sir?”
“Bend over and place your hands on the wall,” she said.
‘Right bloody now,’ he thought but turned to focus on the people his master told him to look at.
It was with a heavy heart on both our parts that it was decided that I would return to England and Holmes would follow me after he had finished his course of healing.
I hope to have the next chapter up soon.
John threw his mind back. It was the murder of a series of Alphas by a gang of Betas but made to look like it was done by Omegas.
I watched Holmes think about what I had said and I saw the realization come across his face. I gave a small sigh of relief as I could see that he finally “got it”. He might actually be able to pull this off.
“But only certain forms of it. I don’t enjoy jamming my finger or a paper-cut. But a well placed beating is heaven to me.”
Yama helped him to remove them without disturbing my poor body too much. There was a very angry stab wound on my chest around the area of the heart. I could smell the end of the infection as Delek cleaned each carefully.
He went back to the bedroom and curled up on the other side of John pulling both men into his embrace.
“Ah, you do remember what happened.”
I nodded grateful for an order.
“Sherlock!?!?!” I exclaimed before I knew I had.
“All your property for her,” I said pointing at Shirley.
Toby looked up at Sherlock not understanding what he was saying.
I told him about what happened to Mary and our sons. I felt tears coming to my eyes and he held me gently. After I had finished telling him I could feel he was shaking.
He jumped a bit as he felt something touch the crook of his arm.
It was then that we realized that we had walked into his trap.
He stood in front of the frame I had been strapped to and watched my face as I was whipped and manhandled. Apparently there was something in my face that he liked.
With that Sherlock’s world seemed to open up. He could do this with Master’s help.
The rest of the sentence went unsaid.
I gave him a slight bow and took my tray to the kitchen. I placed the used items where I had been instructed and went for another tray of drinks to pass out to the guests.
Sherlock had Sebastian drop him off down by the docks and told him to wait for his return. Jim wanted to follow but was stopped short by the choke collar that Seb had put around his neck.
Zaram and Pason agreed to come with me so we could deliver the drugs to Moriarty along with Moran.
William had us ford a stream to confuse the animals searching for us.
“Sherlock, you know better.” came the command.
Sherlock said in a strangled voice, “No!”
A hand went to Jim’s crotch and started teasing him with light touches.
Sherlock took off the t-shirt and track pants he had on, of course with no underwear, and joined John in nudity.
“Let’s see if we can up the tension.” He heard his Master walk across the room and then the sound of a handle to a crank split the air with the clunk of the gear falling in place. His arms were raised a little further and it became harder to breath as his torso stretched to its limit.
‘Oh shit,’ I heard in German, ‘This one pissed himself. I’m not cleaning that up.’
Never said they were dead only shot. Hope you are enjoying this rollercoaster ride.
“Here’s the new one that she picked up at the auction. Put him to work.”
“Now I suggest the Watsons retire for the evening. I have things I need to discuss with ‘Johan’.”
“Note the bruising from the cross blows. This, normally, should be avoided but when your boy can’t remember his manners, it is a good way to remind them of who is in control. I was thinking of using a wooden spoon but I think my boy has learned his lesson.”
Delek said, “Yes, now I think we can help him find himself. This makes some of the things he has said as various parts of himself make much more sense.”
I laughed, “Oh I am very satisfied indeed.”
“He is coming to the camp tonight to bring the payment and collect the goods. We agreed that he can bring four men with him but I expect treachery on his part. I will put our men around the camp to protect us but I think this may be your only chance. I leave the planning to you and know my sword is yours to command.”
“Sherlock, all you have to do is ask for my help and it is given. I am not throwing you in the deep end of the pool and telling you to sink or swim. I think you can win this.”
I kissed her hand, “You have nothing to be sorry about.”
I rabbited to toward the woods only to be grabbed by several of the townsfolk who took me back where my brother was being held. They bound our wrists behind our backs and tossed us into a dog cart which carried us off towards the manor house and back into the hands of our captors.
He dropped to his knees and panted awaiting further orders.
We traveled through back streets and avenues of London until we reached a door that lead into a row house. He picked the lock and we entered the house, which was in serious disrepair.
“You might…” I found myself squeaking rather than talking so I took a breath and tried to calm down “You might,” I finally said more in my register,” take a look to see if anything else might need attending to in that area.”
I unbuttoned my trousers and watched as he licked his lips in anticipation.
We rode and camped outside Kabul waiting for the Tiger to join us for the transaction.
Mycroft turned around and really looked at the man who had met him at the door and took his coat and had just served him his meal. As the realization set in of who he was looking at, his expression changed and he looked poleaxed.
“Does this help?” I asked.
The first strike went across my right pectoral with the second matching on my left. Moran was very skilled with the whip making patterns on my body with a flick of his wrist.
He took John cup and put both in the sink.
I took strange comfort in those orders. I also noted that Mycroft’s handwriting looked a lot like Sherlock’s”
Sherlock grinned and said with great glee, “It worked. I knew it would work.”
The sad thing is that I had to say good-bye yesterday to an old friend who passed today due to cancer and I think I wrote a lot of my anger out in this chapter.
“It’s not that. I just…I…”
“Well played Dr. Watson,” he said, “Not many can do what you just did. Now what do you want for him and my drugs?”
Holmes said to the driver, “No, tell my brother it will not do. I must go to Baker Street now and do not have any time for side trips. His sons’ lives are in danger and he knows this all too well.”
Sherlock nodded and he watched John go into the kitchen and prepare tea for them. He would glance over at Toby who seemed to be asleep but Sherlock could tell he was faking. He decided to give the illusion that he was not watching Toby while cataloguing his new pet in his mind-palace.
“Oh Will, you can’t get another lung infection. Remember what our Doctor said before we left for Eton.”
“Inspector Lestrade, I am glad to find you here but shouldn’t you be dealing with the body across the street. It is apparent to anyone that has eyes that he was responsible for the attack on Sherlock Holmes this evening and there was a fight that lead to his demise. No honor among assassins apparently.” He flit his hand dismissively.
He could feel the warm burning in his abdomen and he knew what was about to come.
Sherlock tossed the used linens in the hamper and took a long piss.
(See the end of the chapter for
How long? His sense of time was shattered.
He motioned to me to examine chests with him.
“Here’s your task my Tiger, don’t come and don’t drop your arms. If you drop your arms, you have to pay the forfeit. Feel free to scream as much as you want.”
“I have been a fool. I understand why you want to stay and why I must leave.”
“And I you John. We do still have about six to seven months before this is happens so let’s make the best and part as friends.”
The monk proceeded to tend his back while another monk came in and bowed to the men in the room. He had a bowl of coals and he put it down on the table next to the cot. He carefully turned Sherlock’s head towards the bowl and placed some powered in the brazier. He fanned to the smoke towards Sherlock who seem to relax and fall asleep.
John dropped to his knees and started licking the head. Sherlock pulled him up by the hair and said “Now or I swear…”
“Is anyone else missing?”
“Strip and leave through the door with the circle on it. Then kneel and present, I will be with you shortly.”
I could feel him adjust behind me while he looked for the proof I had offered.
Sherlock knew that was the only comfort he was going to get.
“Oh Watson, how I have missed this,” he said.
The young man went through the doors into the kitchen with the menu. The waiter was nowhere to be seen. Sherlock signaled and the two thugs just walked into the kitchen. Sherlock jumped up and went out the front looking up and down the street.
“Watson, you have made your feeling clear about how you feel about what I am about to do. Even after expressing your recalcitrance about this whole affair, you did what was asked of you and worked to prepare me for what I must do next. And for that I do thank you. I know you. I know your mind. I want you to remember what happens next as my promise that you will serve me until our dying days. Always. Now I want you to stand up and grab the footboard. Ass out and ready.”
That no one came out of the villa the next couple of days was not unusual. It wasn’t until a week passed that the smell alerted people that something was wrong.
Mycroft seemed to deflate and started sobbing. Sherlock took him in his arms and let him weep and cry his fears and anguish.
“Sherlock is there something you forgot about today?” he asked the man lounging in the chair in front of his desk.
John Watson was not what I expected in my life.
“They thought that they did but no one can put a name to him. A number of them think they had seen him before but they don’t know where,” said the Head Master.
“Yes, you did. You are a good lad indeed,” I said entirely too cheerfully.
“William!” I said more forcefully as I crossed to where I had left my brother.
“Seven,” said Seb, “John wanted Jim to deal with that little Russian rabble that has been trying to be subtle about moving into our territory.”
Seb nodded.
“It will be hard to sit for the next couple of days. I hope that will re-enforce the lesson.”
“Then we will just have to escape right?”
I pulled my member free of my trousers and undergarments where it had been strangling.
Watson smiled and crawled over to me placing his head against my knee, “Were you surprised?”
I could not think. My brain was on fire as I watched my Master subjugate himself.
I could feel the dread build in the pit of my stomach. On some level I did remember but I dare not think about it.
We carefully walked away from where we had been held captive until we found a road.
He shrugged and settled back into Sherlock to sleep.
Sherlock was beyond caring. It hurt and that pain just added to the waves of pain coursing through his body.
I thought back to the last time I saw James which had been about four months previous due to the cases that Sherlock had taken. We had been very busy and traveling a lot. Now the hug that he gave me made more sense than it did at the time.
‘Funny how?’
‘Well Dr Watson, what did you have in mind?’ Sherlock smirked.
When John came back with two cups of tea Sherlock still stood there.
‘I know you would’
Mrs. Hudson and Rosie left and John looked at Sherlock “We are?”
‘Well you are, now go to sleep and we’ll be back tomorrow morning’
Sherlock looked at John and nodded in agreement ‘And they say I’m the guy with no feelings’ he smirked.
‘Greg, can I ask you something?’ John asked when he knew Sherlock was out of hearing range.
‘Are you nauseous?’
‘Did you mean what you said John?’
‘So?’ John whispered ‘than I just have to love you more and make your dark mood bright again’
Sherlock walked over to his couch like a drunk and fell on it, face down.
‘You really love him’ Mary said looking at John watching Sherlock.
Sherlock and John went upstairs. The guestroom was across Sherlock’s bedroom ‘So if you need anything, I’m across your room and I am a very light sleeper, just call me’
‘Outside talking to the doctor’
I handed him the scarf that he left behind which he wrapped around.
A hand slapped my rump hard making the marks from my previous beating reignite the flames of pain.
“Yes.” I replied.
I was sitting in my chair reading through a medical journal when I felt my shoes being removed. At the first touch I startled but didn’t kick. I quickly looked up to see Holmes kneeling in front of me.
“No,” said Delek, “He only thought he knew. Now he has been a slave and, in some ways, much more a slave that you have ever been. His slavery was not by choice or conscious decision as is your servitude but inflicted and enforced on him by methods that are too evil to mention. They broke his spirit, his mind along with his body. Can you say the same of your service to him?”
“NO!”
He looked at me and shrugged. I helped him off of Lucy and then tied his cuffs together so he could not run off.
“Alright we are just going to have to work on this,” I said as I untied Holmes but left the blindfold on, “I want you to position yourself on the bed with your arms above your head and your legs spread.”
I had him on the brink but he pulled me off by my collar.
I sat down on the footstool and watched him as I recovered.
“You haven’t opened it?” I asked.
We walked into a large ball room lit by torches and the fireplaces that were going great gusto to give the entire room an eerie glow. There were areas of cushions with short tables with various items on them. The servants were naked except their masks and their bodies painted vivid colors except the breasts and private areas which shown out in their starkness. There was no hair in the nether regions giving a more youthful look the servants than they were. We were offered drink and food which we partook in. At various places in the room I saw people tied in all kinds of positions but in each the sex was exposed for all to see.
“I am truly sorry Master,” he managed to say right before he went to sleep.
Ok I am putting this and the other piece that is not complete in my NaNoWriMo word count just to see if I can write 1500 words a day. This along with a couple of other projects.
“Ah Watson, you are a treasure indeed. How could I even think of letting such a perfect man out of my sight? Come, let us retire for the evening. I believe both of us have thought on these matters too much.”
Sherlock nodded as much as the hand in his hair would allow.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yama came into the room and I saw great concern on his face.
Holmes and I went through the door to find Graves waiting for us to escort us to Mycroft.
“You learn something new every day,” I said, “If I didn’t already own her, I would give her a raise.”
I sighed a heavy sigh.
I came in to find Mrs. Hudson waiting for me. She took my coat and hat and said, “Supper will be a bit late. But I believe you have some things to attend to before it.”
“What did you say?”
Mary and I got up and bowed to Mycroft. Mary took my hand and led me out of the house to the cottage. She sat me down in one of the overstuffed wing backed chairs and put a lap rug over my legs. She knelt down in front of me and took my hand in hers. She looked up into my face for a bit, let my hand go, patted my knee and got up.
“And what do you do Mr. Holmes?”
I heard the door close.
“Don’t even try any of your tricks,” He growled, “Were you taking a piss? You know the rules and that stunt is going to cost you dearly.”
I smiled and cuddled in to Sherlock knowing that this might be the last time we would be able to be together like this. I didn’t know how wrong and right I would be.
Mycroft read it over his brother’s shoulder, “Tackart? Really?”
“I don’t think I will be telling this one,” I said, “Or rather it will never see print.”
“At this point I knew you were in much danger as Moran blamed us for his Masters demise. Delek and Yama felt that I had recovered for the most part and they had taught me techniques to help me if I have another incident. They sent me on my way with their blessings.”
“Drink up,” John said as casually as possible while he looked around the pub. He notices various patrons sniffing the air and licking their lips. Soft snuffles and growls start to fill the air.
We got fresh horses and continued on the trail of the wagon that had absconded with our boys.
I could hear the screams still ringing off the walls but I could also hear dogs and men coming up the path.
I went into his arms and lay there until I knew he was deeply asleep. I then slipped out and went into the night to the rock garden and sat and thought over all that had happened that day.
“I need to get our food. I promise that I will just get the tray that is outside of the door.”
John’s cell phone vibrated as a text appeared.
He could almost hear a chuckle through the noise in his ears.
Holmes stopped for a moment in his narrative. He looked distressed.
“Come!” I shouted and he complied with a hoarse shout. I found my chest and face covered in his issue.
The longer I spanked him, the harder he became to the point of leaking on the floor.
“Sherlock may seem soft hearted because he has given you choices and something to lay on. Know he is anything but. If he gets bored with you then you become my property and you do not want that on any day. So keep him from getting bored and you will do better.”
He watched as Sherlock jumped up and ran to the kitchen only to return with what John wanted.
Sherlock took the envelope from his brother and started examining it very carefully.
The spanking stopped but tears and the words pouring out of Sherlock’s mouth didn’t.
They took our shoes and socks leaving us barefoot on a very cold floor.
“The treatment,” he said.
Hope you like it. I think it explains Watson's motivation a bit and why he does what he does.
Mary was still up when I got home. She was having a late snack in our drawing room.
“He knew it before,” I said defiantly.
“Do I have to lock you to the bed or will you behave?” I asked in my commanding tone of voice.
“Well fuck,” he thought.
As I got to know Moriarty, I thought I understood them. But every time I thought I had things sorted out, they would do something that would have me work through my data again.
He handed me a knife and said, “I hope you get the answers you are looking for.”
“I know how to do this Sherlock,” said John and Sherlock let him go in peace. John felt a lot better after having a good piss and evacuating his bowels. The entire time he tried to work it out in his head how he might get out of this situation. Heck he would even be happy to see Mycroft at this point.
“No.”
I went home to find Mary drinking her tea. The maid brought me mine and I sat down across from Mary.
“Yes Watson?” he replied.
After about a month, the Baron added new duties which included being his teaching tool for his boys. There were days that I did not want to go on after being used and abused to such an extent. But the thought of getting back to you Watson kept me going on. The Baron always made sure it didn’t go too far where I would be useless the next day but he did stretch the line.
Holmes looked as if he saw a ghost, “Watson?”
She said, “I don't trust her Johan. Please be very careful. That woman has a lot of anger toward men and I am afraid she is going to take it out on you.”
I heard Lady Forrester scream in agony at the sight of her love dead.
“You can be so wanton,” he said with a chuckle as he lined up his cock and breached me.
“Stay there my pet,” said John, “Things are going to be a bit different for the next couple of weeks since you now have a pet of your own. Now I suggest that after you finish your tea, you take your doggie outside so he can relieve himself before we cage him for the night.”
He heard a whining from a corner of the room and turned his head to the noise.
I took Sherlock back to our room and got him ready for bed. I went to my bed only to be summoned to my Master’s bed.
“It’s not that bad Mycroft. You have needs and I can have those needs met,” said John.
When he handed the container back to John their hands touched ever so slightly. It was like an electric pulse went through their hands, it even sent of a tiny spark.
“Glad to see you awake, Mr Holmes” she smiled “How are you feeling? Can you talk? Breathe slowly, you’re alright”
Sherlock just looked at him without saying a word.
‘We had better take you out of these clothes, Dr Watson’ Sherlock said ‘before you catch a cold’
He turned around and John was gone. He walked back to where he had left John standing.
‘But it’s his birthday Mycroft. Don’t tell me you never did this when you were kids?’
‘I see you’re feeling better’ Mycroft said glad he saw some sparkle back in Sherlock’s eyes.
John got up from his chair and walked over to Sherlock. He stood behind him and started slowly to unbutton his shirt.
Sherlock stood up. He couldn’t concentrate on his paper anymore. Twelve years ago this very week he thought. Rosie had her birthday just a few weeks ago. Every year around this time she started this Q&A with him again. She did at a young age with John but he didn’t want to talk about it with his daughter. He thought she was too young to understand it all. Sherlock didn’t agree Rosie was a very smart girl, sometimes even too smart for her own good. Sherlock stood in front of the window and didn’t hear John come back.
‘John’ Sherlock’s deep dark voice came softly ‘I’ll be perfectly alright; go’
‘Is everything alright John?’ Sherlock asked.
They both started giggling which lasted till they were back home in the cottage.
‘We should head back to the cottage before we are missed’ he said softly and started walking back.
‘I’ll put the kettle on’
He took Sherlock’s hand and the walked to the bathroom. Sherlock slipped into the bath, the cool water was refreshing on a hot, smothering day like this. Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed. John always knew what he needed.
‘Yes, I do, but you made me a cake’
‘If I sleep here from now on, do you think you won’t have any nightmares again?’
‘I’m afraid so’ Mycroft finally said ‘This is how it always starts’
‘Nothing, I just… I don’t know really’, Sherlock fell silent.
“Oh are we in a mood?”
‘I think you should ask your dad about that’ he said in a calm voice.
Weeks later Sherlock was still in hospital but his injuries were healing as well as could be expected. He had given his statement a few days later than John’s to Greg and now the doctor was in his room to tell him he could go home.
‘Control freak much?’ John mumbled.
John rubbed his eyes ‘Oh yes I remember’
“Oh Sherlock…” Mrs. Hudson put her hand on Sherlock’s arm “you’re such a romantic, I always knew it” she sighed.
‘Of course I’m sure’
As soon as Sherlock heard John’s footsteps on the stairs and the front door closing he jumped up and rubbed his shoulder. He opened the bedroom door quietly to see if they’d gone. He walked to the window and saw John put Rosie in a cab, strapping her in, and climb in next to her. The cab drove off.
‘We all need a little conformation that we are needed and loved once in a while Sherlock, even you’ Mycroft said with a smile.
‘That’s too embarrassing’ Sherlock smirked.
John stared at the oblong package then back to Sherlock again “You remembered” he said quietly.
“Does this bring you back to reality?”
He looked at me in shock; ‘Mrs Hudson died? When? Why don’t I know that?’
Sherlock nodded, holding John tighter.
‘Oh for god’s sake, John, you know how I hate surprises’
Sherlock got up from his chair; ‘Tomorrow the papers will be filled with your pictures. I wish you a safe flight back to the United States, clearly you do not fit well into the UK’ He turned to John; ‘John, I am in need of a holiday I think’
‘Mary always knew everything’ John smiled through his tears.
‘You scared us. If we hadn’t found you in time we might have lost you’
‘Surprise!’
‘Don’t remind me’, Sherlock shook his head. ‘Christmas breakfast was very enlightening’
John took a step forward and looked at the ragged bunch lying in the corner. ‘Sherlock Holmes!’ he said with a loud voice ‘You get up this instant!’
“Mycroft”, Sherlock simply said.
‘Not all family’, Mycroft said still smiling.
‘You know how my little brother loves Americanisms don’t you?’
‘Ah, Sherlock, morning, slept well? Tea anyone?’, and without waiting for an answer he poured the tea from the teapot into the cups.
‘I’m sorry’ Sherlock said putting his hand for a single moment on John’s arm.
Even though Sherlock was awake now John still held him. Sherlock didn’t mind but still it felt kind of awkward as if there was something still standing between them.
‘Hmm?’ John replied.
John smiled at Sherlock ‘Thank you Sherlock, I’m glad I can stay here, and we have more time to take long walks together’
‘Yeah, the other night while I was having a beer with my assistant her purse was stolen, her phone was in there as well which is the whole point’
Never wake me again. I’m not so sure I will make it or if I will be alright again or if I ever was.
Sherlock looked shocked at John, he couldn’t have noticed that he really liked John, could he? John smiled at him; ‘Well, let’s go’ and walked on.
‘John, is that you?’ he called out.
‘You’ he said to John ‘have left me for a woman who tried to kill me and left me to live in the flat all by myself. You promised to be my friend, to be there and you left me! And you’ he said turning to Mycroft ‘you can only spare me a moment of your precious time once a month to check up on me to see if I’m not an embarrassment for you and your precious government! You only want to know if I behave myself. Well I’ve had enough, enough I say’ Sherlock swung back and forth on his feet and collapsed on the floor.
‘Oh for god sake’ John lowered his paper ‘stop the dramatics and just tell me’
‘How did mum die?’
‘Fine, I won’t then’, Sherlock started to walk away.
‘Well that man was… ‘
‘For not feeling’ Sherlock’s voice came from the couch.
‘I’m sure you have’ Mycroft interrupted him ‘the reason I call you is that I had my monthly appointment today with him and he hasn’t shown himself’
And when they kissed it was as if everything fell into place. As if there has never been anything but their love for each other, if there had only been and only would forever be; John and Sherlock.
‘I’m sorry Sherlock; I know you don’t like them, parties I mean’
‘Don’t make me puke before I had eggnog’, Sherlock said while he turned back to watch the snow getting thicker.
‘So, they don’t know you are planning to go to London then?’ John stood up and walked to the kitchen to put his cup in the sink.
“I thought you said you were the smart one?” Lestrade said to Mycroft.
‘You’re all wet now’, the man said ‘Do you live around here? You’ll catch a cold if you don’t put warm clothes on’
Sherlock interpreted John’s silence for a negative reaction to his letter and started to withdraw to his room; ‘I am sorry’ he said before he started walking away.
Sherlock looked up, tears filled his eyes; ‘I am not good at this, John’
‘I always need you’ John smiled leaning over for a kiss ‘but I understand; I’ll watch this one alone, I don’t mind’
‘What is the matter, Sherlock?’ Mycroft softly asked.
‘I am not sure what you mean’ Sherlock said.
‘I have a meeting soon with someone about a flat, mother’
“She…” Rosie said.
“Sure she says your name, but not dada” John went into the kitchen to make some tea and breakfast.
John looked at Sherlock’s hand and smiled wearily ‘Oh, that’s okay, thanks. I’ll be done with all that soon anyway’
‘Redbeard’ Mycroft repeated.
‘Mum, I’m just going out for a little walk before dark, alright? I’ll be back soon’
‘I know John is organizing a surprise party’
John started to open the bag and an old video tape came out. John stared at it and then looked at Sherlock ‘You don’t think…’ he started.
‘Can I ask you a very personal question?’ John hesitantly asked.
When John was finished reading his letter he fell silent. The only sound in the room was Mrs Hudson softly sniffling.
‘Yes mother’, Sherlock sighed.
‘Dizzy?’
He opened his eyes and found himself in John’s arms much to his surprise. John was caressing his curls, whispering softly that it would be all fine.
“What for, did you beat him up? No you did not so don’t be silly”
‘Fall in love with me John, fall in love with me’ Sherlock breathed.
‘Well…’
‘Sherlock, no when does he get romantic letters?’ she giggled at the idea of it ‘it must be for you, go on John open it. There’s no name on it, so it must be for you. All Sherlock’s mail has his name on it, go on’ she pushed him.
‘Like someone poked into my head’
‘I will see you tomorrow then, Dr Watson’
John smiled; “I know, I love you too” he leaned over for another kiss while Rosie giggled.
‘John, John!’ he cried out ‘where are you?’
‘Sherlock I’m walking with you okay, I really need to talk to you about that man they brought into the morgue today’
Sherlock looked up to see Mycroft and Greg following him.
“You’re drunk” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand.
“It is” John caressed Sherlock’s back all the way to his bare bum. He saw goose bumps appear. “Like some morning sex?” he giggled.
‘Right, good night’
‘Here is to new beginnings, to a new flat and to having someone to come back to’ John said holding up his glass.
‘I thought as much’ Mycroft said ‘I have a case he might be interested in’
‘They won’t, they never have, so they won’t’ Sherlock brushed it aside.
‘Sherlock, bloody hell’ John bent over and went through Sherlock’s pockets.
Sherlock stood up and put on his robe. ‘Do you want some tea?’
‘What?’
‘I’ve never realised that you miss her too’ he said in a soft voice.
“Better not think about it for a while, it will come to you when you least aspect it” John took a sip of his beer. “I’m glad we’re out too, we should do this more often”
Mycroft did me the kindness of sharing anything that he received about Sherlock’s whereabouts. We knew we were practically the only people we could talk to about this subject and out of that and our love of Sherlock came a friendship I never expected.
“And you as well,” he replied with a ghost of a smile on his face. I could see that both were memorizing the other.
The male dressed James stood up and said,” Moran, you have your orders. Make sure our…property is instructed correctly for their new duties.”
Greg bounced to John’s head took it in his hands guiding John’s lips onto his cock.
I remembered the case that I had picked up. I went to my saddlebag and found the vials and the needle. There were instructions in the lid as to the dosage and timing of the shots and the order of them. I still had no idea what was in the vials but I could see that Holmes was suffering badly and out in the middle of nowhere was not the place to start his withdrawal. I pulled the dose into the needle and injected Holmes carefully hoping that this wasn’t a trick and I didn’t just kill him.
Our father made sure that we had all that we could want but instilled in us a sense of responsibility and appreciation for what we had.

“John, are you still there?”
I could really use some feedback on this because I am floundering a bit.
“You, strip,” she said, “Then stand in the middle of the room hands behind your head and keep them there.”
“You would let me beat you, wouldn’t you?”
I undid his arms and legs but left the rope harness on.
He went for his Pet next. Leaving the blindfold on, he removed the headphones and the gag from his mouth. He grabbed the lead and tugged gently. His Pet dropped to all fours and followed him around to the other side of the cross. A light tug on the lead and his Pet knelt up and put his hands behind his back.
“Yes!” said Sherlock, “The boys have been held in an area with lots of coal dust. And not just any coal, that color gives me an even smaller area where they are.”
He looked at me, “You are joking.”
Laurence handed Sherlock the phone that buzzed when it touched his hand. He looked at the text and nodded.
“Am I that horrid?” asked Mary who was lying naked on the large bed with her hands bound above her head.
Hope you like this next part. I am planning to have the next chapter up before Halloween.
Basil came over and sniffed Toby then growled shaking his head.
“You are awake my friend. We were a bit worried about you.”
“No, I want to hear you. Just know that the window is open,” He said as he stroked me through my undergarments.
“Why would you think that?” I asked.
“Aww I think you scared him. Don’t worry Dr. Watson. I am sure that your master will do as we ask and you’ll be sucking his cock back at Baker Street in no time,” said the video maker
“And you?” Holmes asked turning to the man who had dropped to his knees at we entered.
He opened an eye to see Sherlock looking at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yama nodded as he unstrapped Holmes and examined the bruises that were forming where the straps were. He shook his head, “This is not good.”
Sherlock said, “It was all John and Mary’s doing. I just did as instructed.”
“Give him here,” said a voice. It was Delek’s I think but I was not sure.
“You have done nothing wrong,” I said, “You are not going to be punished.”
“What was that about?” I asked.
Winston was not among our number.
Lestrade palmed his now straining cock. He wanted to leave but….Fuck it. He locked the door to the observation room and stripped. His cock was jutting proudly from his body but it was nothing compared to the monster attached to Sherlock’s body.
The man-dog quickly sat up at attention.
“Lay down.”
I took the flared base of the plug and working in out and then thrust it back in hard.
About the time that he was about to get wrapped up in his brain again, he felt a gentle stroke on his inner left thigh. He sighed and pushed his left leg towards the feeling. That got him a quick smack. He relaxed back and the touch continued gentle strokes first on his left then his right. He tried to not move so that this lovely feeling would continue. The strokes became harder. He sorted out that there were leather gloves on the hands that were touching him.
“So you decided to declare both your children?” I asked as a servant handed me a scotch neat and I sat in the chair that Mycroft indicated I should sit in.
“The message?” asked Holmes holding his hand out. Yama gave him the envelope which he opened and read.
“Settle,” I said and he sat back on his haunches. I could almost see the frustration radiating from his body.
The blood covered the marble floor making it quite slippery.
“Yes Sir,” said Moran.
Mycroft dropped the phone and put his head in his hands. He was so screwed. He trashed the computer and the drive. He then called his assistant to gather the information that John wanted and cleared his calendar as instructed.
And we kept that promise to each other to this day.
“Back to bed with you.”
They retired to the couch Greg on one side and Sherlock on the other. John put on the telly. He snuggled into his two Alphas. He could swear he heard them purring in their chests.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft started. Sherlock raised a shaking hand and stopped him.
I felt his cock twitch against my leg.
“Is she your slave?” he asked looking at Sherlock who had gone to sleep or pretended to have done so.
Seb handed the computer over to Sherlock, “Put the wifi onto MorMor2 so we can follow the signal to the phone.”
Sherlock walked into the building and worked his way to the one door that was not broken off its hinges. He tapped it carefully six times and looked at the hidden camera pointed at the door.
“Capital idea!”
He grinned and held up his wrists.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please tell Mr. Holmes that we would love to hear him play again when he is ready. Now finish your drink and go back to your Master.”
He was stood up and guided to where the pommel horse was stationed.
He lets the audience see his hard cock now free from restraint bouncing proudly. He sees a number men lick their lips and even more adjust themselves.
“I release you,” he said louder.
He found himself in the middle between Greg and Sherlock as hands explored each other.
Message: Instructions shall follow shortly. Time is not John Watson’s friend Mr. Holmes.
“Well?” I asked.
“An eye for an eye Mycroft,” said John as he pulled Jim into his lap and started to kiss each injury. Jim moaned upon each touch of John’s lips. Mycroft watched as Jim’s lovely slightly curved cock filled out to its full length. John took him in hand and carefully brought him almost to climax but then backed off.
“Um John?” said Lestrade, “I don’t think it is a good idea for you to be here now.” His stomach was still trying to come up his throat but he could swear his cock never felt this hard. The smell was taking over everything. He looked behind John to see just about everyone in the room gathered at his door just watching the scene in front of him.
My curiosity was piqued. I took the steps two at a time but paused when I got to the door and composed myself before opening it.
I glared at Holmes, “You really do not understand why I am angry do you?”
“Sherlock!”
I tried to sit up but the room was spinning so I lay back down, “A bit dizzy.”
“John, sleep with me. I do better when you are with me.”
“Constabulary?”
“Who tied you up?” I asked.
Sherlock drank his tea and watched Toby pretend to not be listening.
It was only when a small woman accompanied by a large man who had obviously been in the military came in that I saw any reaction from Holmes and the only reason I saw that was because I knew him so well. They worked their way around the room looking at each slave until they came to us.
Yama sat next to me, “You haven’t lost him John. His mind may be fractured but it is not gone. He is alive and where there is life…”
“Note the color change when the flesh is struck.”
“You have no idea what this man is capable of,” replied my Master, “He is a treasure. A tasty treasure.”
I checked Holmes over. He did not seem any worse for wear. I gave him some water to drink.
We took to the road and worked our way to a rather large village. We observed the citizens for a while figuring out who was who.
Holmes stopped talking and shuttered.
Wilson took the other babe and I could see myself in that face. He even had a thick head of my hair.
He looked into my eyes and said, “What are you not telling me.”
I am working on a Sherlock POV that takes place during this if anyone is interested.
“Kensal Green!” came one voice, “I’ll bet my life that is Kensal Green.”
Seb put his hands behind his back and took his Master’s cock in his mouth allowing him to take his price.
I shrugged, “British food doesn’t really agree with me these days.”
The next week was all about recovery. I worked very hard to get myself back to something close to normal.
“HEY!”
I pass out the beverages while in the presences of Mycroft’s man who was watching me closely. I tapped out what had happened on my tray in Morse code along with Mycroft’s own spin on it which made it look like I had a nervous tick rather than that I was passing on information. I handed him the last glass on my tray and noted that he tapped out acknowledged so I knew that my message has been delivered.
I felt a needle being pushed into the vein of my arm and as I was falling into the dark abyss I saw a woman in a green ball gown being pulled into the room by the leash on her collar. The leash was handed to Moriarty who pulled the poor girl to her knees.
He looked up, saw me, and said, “Oh thank G-d John.”
I looked at him carefully and said, “What do you want Mycroft? You don’t own me. My contract is with Sherlock. Mary’s contract is with Lady Forrester alone.”
He whispered, “I know it is you. I know that you are not a hallucination or not real. No matter what they try to do to me, I can hang onto you.”
“Yeah,” said Seb.
“Now the paddle can be many shapes and sizes. I have chosen a leather covered one for this demo.”
“Up,” said Delek and Sherlock went up on his knees.
He pointed to the floor in front of him and I dropped to my knees where he pointed.
“Where?”
Delek sat there as Holmes slept in his lap.
He opened his arms and said, “Attend me.”
For around his cock was an ugly metal cage that had been welded shut the same way the cuffs and collar on his wrist, ankles and neck were. I could see that there was damage to his organ from being confined for G-d knows how long.
“Winner gets?”
I could feel the hard member under his robes. I worked my hand through them to where I could touch skin. I fondled his balls and felt his cock come to full attention.
I didn’t have too long to wait. I let him take in the position he was in.
“NO!” came the command.
“I want to hear you say it,” he purred.
The bag came off of his head and he found himself blinking as the light shining in his face threw everything else into shadow.
Greg growled from the bed and tried to pull himself free.
Mycroft looked startled for just a moment.
“No Sir, I don’t think that there is anything in what has been published to give even a hint of the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.”
“I found you outside in the snow in great pain. You apparently had wandered out of the house after consuming some port that had been tampered with. The Tzesarevich’s valet recognized the symptoms of the poison. It was lucky that you did so. The lower temperature kept the poison from killing you outright. Apparently this was an attempt on the Tzesarevich’s life that you were accidently caught up in since his love of fine port is well know.”
John thought about it and Sherlock had been rather touchy. John had put it down to Alpha possessiveness but now it made more sense.
Seb could feel the annoyance radiating through the phone, “Never mind.”
I didn’t have much to go on except that I had seen the people who bought Sherlock with my own eyes, a name that was said ‘Seb’ and the initials J. M. that were on the collar that was put around Sherlock’s neck before he left.
“You but not you,” I replied.
Sherlock said, “John has been kidnapped by some lower mafia scum due to their screw up. Now I have what they want. But what we want is their ass. I need to find John and these photos are the only clues I have. You will fan out over London and find this grave. Does anyone recognize anything here?”
Sherlock snapped his fingers and Greg extracted himself from under John. Sherlock pointed to John’s head and then to Greg’s cock.
I slept without dreaming.
Sherlock draped himself over the horse and was quickly cuffed and attached to the horse with a leather strap fastened across the horse and his kidneys leaving him next to no wiggle room. That it was carefully placed over the kidneys concerned him more.
John looked down at Sherlock and a fond smile crossed his lips. He did care for his pet. More than he ever thought he would.
Will stepped over to me and waited for the door to open. Once it was, he stepped back and let me perform. I moaned and groaned and waved a hand in the direction of the door.
My brother, who has always been a bit of an exhibitionist (‘am not’ was scribbling in the margin), stripped quickly and tossed his clothes over for inspection.
As the boys drew their first breaths, I felt Mary breath her last.
“Not that way,” I said sitting on the edge of the bed, “across my lap.”
Before I could get my thoughts in order I heard “Present” and my body obey as I had been trained to do. My hands went behind my head and I stood at attention.
The next day I strapped the knife to my leg beneath my clothing. I got Lucy ready to ride and followed Janan one of the chief’s sons and his right hand man in the drug trade.
He looked at me and seemed to be weighing what he was going to say next in response but he smiled instead.
“Unless you need to use the chamber pot, I want you to stay right here,” he said in a very authoritative voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
I was carried by Holmes and placed on the warm stone table. I heard the voices whispering in my ears words of comfort. I could feel Delek’s hands hovering just over my body.
‘Mycroft gave you access to the tools that you need but you gained their loyalty and trust. You know the way.’
The hands left his body. He found himself thrusting towards the touch before he could stop himself.
I started to get up to kneel but was stopped by a warm hand gently on my shoulder. I started because I hadn’t figured he has moved that close to me.
The camera went back to the glass showing him his brother being shocked over and over. Mycroft started to cry as he listened to his brother’s voice breaking over and over.
There were two guards on the door which we made short work of.
“Moriarty is getting ready to leave. Apparently he is going to go find out what happened to Moran who is a week over due for return. Apparently the men he sent to get him information didn’t return either.”
I was taken out of my trunk or rather drug out of it since my legs and arms had become very cramped from my confinement. I was unshackled and the hood and ear plugs were removed but the gag and blindfold remained.
“However I know that you enjoy this so I am going to take it out on Shirley here and you are going to watch.”
“No that seems to be a new one. It does fill in a piece of what we have sorted out about his captivity. I wonder what triggered it now?”
He scrambled off my lap and placed his hands on the bed with his ass out ready for my hand.
He hit me again and grabbed me by the collar. He positioned me with my hands on a rock and my ass out and proceeded to hit, slap and punch me all the while berating me for what I had done.
“Not cricket Holmes,” I said.
I have written the history of Sherlock Holmes and James Moriarty and it has been published in the Strand Magazine. I wrote about their meeting and subsequent confrontation at the Reichenbach Falls and Holmes’ return three years later.
I followed him through the maze of the temple and found myself in a small garden. Holmes was lying on a long stone plinth that had ornate hooks on each corner. His hands and feet had been tied to each of the hooks. He had a blindfold on. The injuries that had inflicted upon him seemed be almost glowing. They had shaved his head and all his body hair. I saw new evidence of trauma there. It seems to be several vicious looking burns on his skull. Delek was whispering to Holmes as he placed his hands on various places of Holmes’ body.
“My word, you have done a fine job indeed,” he laughed, “I did not recognize you at all!”
William looked at our ‘host’ very suspiciously and said, “All our clothes?”
The Tiger put down a bench in front of him and sat down.
“It was decided that they would gain early admittance. They had out stripped their tutors and were deemed to be mature enough attend.”
“Now that we have an understanding,” said John, “I need you to do something for me. I need some files on where the troops are deployed in Afghanistan. I will send you instructions on how to get them to me. Also clear your calendar on Saturday, you are busy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I shivered but did not know why.
Mrs. Hudson gathered up his soiled clothing and the basin with the fouled towels and bloody water and heading down the backstairs. The maid let Lestrade in with two other officers behind him.
“His son,” I said, “I remember that name from a case that Uncle John told me that he and Uncle Sherlock had helped the police with.”
“You took the boys to Eton did you not?” asked Sherlock turning back to the sofa where Mycroft’s slaves sat.
He got out of the pool, yawned a large yawn, and said, “Attend me.”
He saw what was happening and took the butt of his gun bringing it down on the leather clad head with a resounding thump. Sherlock slumped and was still.
I could see he was trying so hard to figure out what I was going to do next and anticipate my needs.
I blinked ‘no’ several time before I could get him to stop.
“There has been previous damage. It might not be…”
Hope you enjoy.
I don’t remember Yama bringing me back to my room.
We sat in silence for a while. He unwound himself and put his feet on the floor spread apart then undid his trousers and pulled out his cock. He grabbed my hair and pulled me over to in between his legs. He didn’t have to give the command. I proceeded to take his member in my mouth and suckle on it as it stiffened to fill the space there. I proceeded to suck and lick until he came in my mouth. He yanked me off. I proceeded to put him back together and move back to my cushion.
John patted the cushion on Sherlock’s chair and Sherlock sat down looking at John expectantly.
He grabbed my collar and pulled me up to standing to my tip-toes and kissed me rather ferociously. I returned his kiss with the same passion. I could feel my member pulsing between my legs with much interest.
“This is your pee break. I assume you need to go considering the amount of time it has been since you last went.”
I was about to protest when Delek entered and Yama caught him up on all that had happened.
All three men collapsed into a pile covered in sweat, slick and cum.
He growled and pushed me away from the door.
And Lestrade’s door slammed open with a very much in heat and very irritated John Watson storming in.
Our knees hit the hard wood floor before we knew what we were doing.
I closed my mouth and proceeded to disrobe as ordered.
We finished our food in silence.
“I’m sorry?” he said in total puzzlement.
Sherlock pulled John up to sitting and removed the shirt and undershirt.
“I want you to place your hands on the bench with your ass out,” he said with a growl.
‘That is very generous of her’
John looked at Sherlock as if he’d guessed his thoughts and smiled; ‘Happy now Sherlock?’
‘I honestly don’t know what you want me to say’ Sherlock said.
‘You are in the guestroom, John remember? You fell in a frozen ditch yesterday and were so cold that it was best to stay here’
John nodded, and they walked on next to each other.
‘I have no idea what you are talking about Dr Watson, expect us tomorrow’ John could hear Mycroft laughing when he hang up the phone.
“Nothing”, Sherlock shrugged “Can we please go now, I’m freezing!”
‘Where is Mycroft?’
‘No’ Sherlock simply said.
He walked in the house and greeted his father ‘Sherlock! How happy this makes me to see you home for Christmas!’ his father smiled, shaking his hand. ‘Your room is just the way you left it, you can put your suitcase there’
‘I wouldn’t think twice if I were you. You can’t find a more loyal boyfriend than Sherlock Holmes. He would do anything for you, John. He has gone to hell and back again for you’ Greg patted John on the back before walking off to Sherlock who was waving at Greg to come over.
‘You both smell like sweet vanilla perfume which isn’t a men sent but it is hers’ pointing at a girl who just walked by leaving a whiff of vanilla behind.
‘Good’ John smiled and started kissing Sherlock again.
‘You didn’t know before, besides I loved Mary too and she knew’
‘Thank you’ Mycroft softly said and put his hand on John’s arm. ‘Of course I am too, we’ll keep in contact’
‘Well, I was in a queue to pay my groceries’ John started but Mycroft didn’t hear him.
He looked at me again and said softly; ‘You came back?’
‘Did I awake Rosie?’ Sherlock felt ashamed now. He knew he couldn’t help what he was dreaming about but this was getting out of hand.
‘John, is there something I can do, clearly you don’t have any help from ‘him’ over there’
Sherlock started to unbutton John’s shirt while kissing him. John’s hands were in Sherlock’s curls, grabbing them, pulling him closer. Sherlock’s hands were all over John’s chest. John pushed Sherlock toward the bed, grabbing his shirt to unbutton it. Sherlock kicked off his shoes, unzipped his pants and still kept on kissing John. When his pants were off he unzipped John’s pants and they both threw themselves onto the bed, heavily breathing, kissing, touching.
‘I think that will help tremendously yes’
‘Are you out of your mind?’
Before we left Mycroft kissed his brother’s curls carefully not to wake him ‘Sweet dreams little brother’ he whispered.
“Oh yes, we are going to have a girl’s night” Mrs. Hudson smiled to Rosie as she took her over from Sherlock.
‘Thank you Mrs Hudson’ he said to Mrs Hudson who had come up with him to give him the letter. He took the letter from her and looked at it.
“Mycroft, thank god you’re here”
“Of course I am, come on, what are you waiting for?” Sherlock already had his Belstaff on and was busy with his scarf.
Sherlock moaned some more when he looked at the time; ‘Mother, it is Christmas day!’
‘Yeah, that woman, what’s her name, Irene Adler, but I don’t really know if that was something to be honest, I mean romantically. I think he was intrigued. Yeah that’s the right word for it’ Greg nodded.
Sherlock just stared at John’s hand for a bit and rubbed his thumb over John’s.
“Oh for god sake, don’t let her in the bedroom John, hurry get something on”
‘Come here John, it’s the thought that counts’
When they were having their dinner Mary started to talk first; ‘You know we have to talk right? That is why we went out to dinner in the first place’
When they were home Sherlock put the fire on while John put the groceries away.
This time John went all out, and grabbed Sherlock’s curls, he put his tongue in Sherlock’s mouth and tasted him. The kiss was eager and promising more and full of hunger.
After he felt that Sherlock had calmed down somewhat, he took Sherlock’s head in his hands and kissed him gently on his luscious lips.
‘Thank you so much’ Mrs Watson whispered ‘I think that is best, for him as well. I will take his things over tomorrow if that’s alright?’
“Right, on our way out we must tell Mrs Hudson we’re off”
“Perhaps we should go” Sherlock said a few minutes later “You and me against the rest of the world”
‘But you hate parties’
‘Mother don’t worry so much, I’m sure Sherlock has thought of everything, besides, I live in London, so I will keep an eye on him, as always’, Mycroft said, rather smug.
‘No’, John said ‘not too fast, we have all the time in the world’
Mrs H walked in with tea ‘The bedroom is over there’ she pointed with her head because her hands were full. She put down the tray on the small table next to the chairs. ‘There is another bedroom upstairs if you’ll be needing another bedroom’
“As I’m told you were pinned down and hit and kicked yourself right?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth and opened it again; ‘I don’t do Christmas’.
‘Parents can be so embarrassing’ John said joining Sherlock.
“Hmm, I guess I am”
Suddenly there was a shout into his room which made him startle and he turned around from his packing.
‘Not sure yet, father’
“What John?”
‘You hate family’, Sherlock said still sulking.
A few hours later, after they had said goodbye to Sherlock’s parents “Don’t be late in college, Sherlock, leave this place as we left it and John it was nice to have you” Sherlock looked at the car as it drove off and sighed ‘Well John, what shall we do without parents to keep us in check?’ he smirked ‘we have two hours until we have to leave to catch the train, what shall we do with all that extra time?’ he rolled his eyes at John who started to giggle.
‘What happened John, I can’t remember, all I know it was rather disturbing’
They sat down at the kitchen table when the food was delivered and quietly ate their dinner.
‘I do Mr Holmes, but why may I ask?’
‘But with Rosie’ John hesitated ‘Wouldn’t you be too much disturbed by Rosie?’
“I’m glad you talked me in to going out John” Sherlock said “you’re right of course, I’m cooped up inside too much but that last case keeps clinging onto my mind”
‘Yes I suppose’
“It will be alright John” Mycroft said.
He nodded, stood up and followed me to the kitchen sink where I cleaned his cut and put a band aid on his finger.
‘Like going to live in a flat in London without even knowing what you will do with your life you mean?’ John blurted out.
“Sherlock!” John almost shouted.
‘I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that’
John put the letter on the kitchen table and started to clear the groceries.
“Cock” John tried to be helpful.
“John, don’t feel guilty” Sherlock whispered squeezing John’s hand. “Please, I saw how… they held the knife at your throat. They…” Sherlock coughed “said to me they would kill you” A tear rolled over Sherlock’s cheek “I have never been so afraid in my life. I don’t want anything to happen to you”
John dove into those deep blue/greenish eyes like oceans, like the Universe and said; ‘I am very sure’
‘That is what I’m afraid of’ Sherlock mumbled under his breath.
“Jeez Sherlock like it, I love it, but it’s just too much!”
They arrived at the pub and ordered two beers.
“You do now” SH
‘Yours is dreading you’re coming home I bet’, Sherlock replied ‘with all the ‘friends’ you are bringing home with you’.
‘Well’ John started ‘I know something we could do’
Sherlock heard the bang of the front door closing and Rosie babbling followed by John’s steps on the stairs. He sat in his chair pretending to read the paper when they came in.
‘Oh god…’ John whispered.
‘I don’t mind’ Sherlock agreed
“No not really”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but said nothing.
‘Mr and Mrs Holmes, glad you could make it’
Sherlock explained that he told his parents about living in London and that he got the impression that they were relieved that he didn’t have the intention to come back home. ‘They were looking at each other and I could see the relief’, Sherlock shrugged.
He looked up, for a moment he didn’t seem to recognise me but then he smiled; ‘John’ he said.
A few minutes later John returned with Rosie in her pyjama holding her elephant. As soon as she saw Sherlock she grinned and stretched out her arms.
‘Hello mother’, Sherlock said brushing his coat before entering the house.
‘Sherlock, Sherlock wake up, you’re having that nightmare again’
‘Redbeard’ Mycroft nodded ‘because that is the only one that will get him back to his feelings again and reminds him of caring and in some way also of the ones he loves and why he wants to stay alive even though he has drugs in his system’
‘What I mean is’ John whispered into Sherlock’s ear, touching the curls with his mouth ‘that we can make love everywhere in the house without having to think about waking up Rosie and since I know you are having trouble with this hot weather, you won’t mind if I undress you’
‘I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean by ‘the look’. Be more specific please Rosie and eat your breakfast please. You’re late enough as it is’
Sherlock rolled his eyes annoyingly; ‘It is not a guessing game, I am deducing.’
‘Leave me alone’
Sherlock turned around. “Thank you John, you have such a way with words. I’m sorry for being that. I know you wanted me to be more, to be better, more romantic perhaps. I cannot help not being the person I am not. I was too busy still with tonight’s case, with the damned cold, with… I don’t know with what but I just wasn’t there for you and I’m sorry”
‘Nope’ Sherlock answered ‘there’s no need for them to know either’
‘Sherlock’
‘John Watson, I’m going to get your six months old daughter so keep those thoughts hidden’ Sherlock said with a smirk, he walked back to John and gave him a long kiss ‘at least until later’
‘I don’t know, I just have a very bad feeling and I whenever I do; Sherlock is using again’
“I will let you know immediately” Mycroft nodded.
Sherlock swallowed hard; ‘It’s nothing John, it’s silly of me, just let it go’
‘Aren’t you going to open the letter?’ Mrs Hudson asked ‘aren’t you curious?’
“No you cannot. You know what you can do? Find those losers, those homophobia queer bashers and lock them up because if I ever see those blokes again, I will fight back! You know what he just told me? He didn’t fight back to save me! Because some punk told him they would kill me if he would! You have my statement, his will be the same don’t you think? Let him rest now and go find those …” John grinded his teeth.
Mrs Hudson got up ‘I’m going now, John, don’t mind Rosie. I’ll take care of her tonight’ she said and to Sherlock ‘that was so wonderful dear’
“I said ‘we’ not me alone”
It still was a chilly December morning and Sherlock put his coat collar up.
When they were eating, even Sherlock was eating this time, John looked up at Sherlock.
“Nothing is ever too much for my favourite blogger” Sherlock softly said.
'Dr Watson’ although Mycroft sounded controlled there was a hint of concern in his voice.
‘Son, you’re pushing it. I thought you were just any regular detective but you’re just a douche’
‘What are your plans, Sherlock, after college?’
John opened the door and walked to the kitchen to put down the groceries.
John came running up behind him ‘Sherlock, wait up. I didn’t mean, I was, I mean I wanted to…’ suddenly Sherlock heard a thud and a muffled scream.
Violin music started filling the room.
“Is it morning already?” Sherlock moaned.
“I seem to recall that you got something last night as well” Sherlock looked at John with a smirk.
‘Let it go, Sherlock, don’t think so much’ John whispered.
‘He thinks that using drugs will help him better to think or to get into his Mind Palace as he calls it. But sometimes he also uses as an escape’
“Point taken” John grinned.
‘No we haven’t had any case since… since he’s back’
‘I do not see why it is any of your business but yes I am’, Sherlock answered.
Sherlock still had trouble talking but instead he put his hand on John’s and looked at him.
Sherlock wouldn’t even remember that today was their anniversary. The day they’d met all those years ago when Mike Stamford had introduced them. As John took a quick shower he thought back about that day. About how he met Mike in the park and Sherlock in St. Bart’s where he amazed him from the beginning with his deduction skills. About their first case together and how he would have never thought how his life would have turn out this way. He quickly turned the shower off when he heard Rosie through the baby monitor and rushed to dry off and put his clothes on. He went to her room (his old room) where he picked her up from her crib.
‘I’m back, Sherlock!’ he called out.
“How is my little brother doing? I mean I am on my way up there right now but, well you know, he’s been not himself of late”
‘Where is your assistant now?’
‘You don’t want your wife to know’
Sherlock looked up from his paper before putting it down ‘Of course John’
Sherlock and John lifted their suitcases and walked up the stairs. On top of the stairs they stood still in front of a door which was closed. Sherlock looked at John ‘Ready?’ he asked. John nodded.
‘Well, let’s go to the station, shall we?’
“I won with 6-2”
When they returned to Baker Street and John had put Rosie to bed he sat on his own bed thinking about what Greg had said. He couldn’t believe how stupid he was. Mary knew, in her message she said it; Go to hell Sherlock, go to hell and save John Watson. He did go to hell and he did save him. Mary knew there was no other way. Mary knew Sherlock would do anything for him. He could be so stupid!
‘He has gotten worse Dr Watson’ Mycroft said shaking his head ‘I would never have thought that such a brilliant mind as that of my brother would go to waste on such a horrible disease’
