what people, especially men, think when they look at his mouth and he’s never had any reservations to play into the cocksucker lips stereotype to ensure his sexual gratification and his partner’s. And it’s not that Dean doesn’t want to keep hearing all the delicious noises Novak is making. He
While he’s waiting for breakfast to be served, Dean chooses a small square table for two that allows him a perfect view of the kitchen, where Castiel is clearly bantering with the cook, and of the backyard garden. Once again, the reviews were spot on. A well-kept patio leads to a garden with trimmed grass where different tables, chairs, armchairs and sofas are scattered around the place – their style completely different from the furniture in the breakfast room and clearly meant for the outdoors. Approximately half of them – those made out of wood rather than metal – are placed under big waterproof umbrellas that also protect from the sun. This way, people can choose if they want to enjoy the sun if the day is sunny, but they can also stay in the garden if it’s raining. The system allows for the garden to be used and appreciated all year round. There’s literally nothing that hasn’t been meticulously planned in this place.
Cas’s pleased smile is the sweetest, cutest, most rewarding and most beautiful thing Dean’s ever seen.
Castiel can relate. He, too, is getting desperate to be inside of his beautiful boy. His fingers leave the heat of Dean’s hole so his hand can lube his throbbing erection up. He makes certain to be as quick as possible – even though his hand on his rock hard cock makes him shiver and pause momentarily – because he knows Dean hates feeling empty after he’s been prepped.
“She was in trouble, Dean. It was late, and dark. I have seen what happens to people out there when they are in trouble and alone.”
. He doesn’t have much time left before Dean will be home from work, and it would suck spectacularly if his boyfriend were to find him like this.
work hard to earn my forgiveness for rejecting me like he did yesterday and for assuming that I was so shitty to come here and flaunt my new girlfriend in front of him like that.”
So does Castiel. That’s what’s happening here, isn’t it? He’s having fun. So much so it’s been more than one hour and he hasn’t even realized it.
Dean relaxes even more under Castiel’s ministrations, having clearly understood that this is all foreplay, but that Castiel doesn’t mean to take him from behind. Not this time at least.
As soon as his back connected with Dean’s chest, Cas put his right hand on Dean’s thigh and buried his left one in Dean’s hair, letting his head loll back a little, and putting his right ear just at the right angle for Dean to dirty whisper to him as he started fucking him slow and deep.
The following morning Dean was in a pretty bad mood, and it wasn’t difficult to identify its source. He literally marched into The Heavenly Coffee with a slightly confused Charlie by his side, determined to corner Cas and force him to spit out what his fucking problem was.
Admittedly, he might have gone a bit too far – flirting a bit with one or two of Cas’s coworkers, using a hint of what he knew Cas
When they adopted the twins almost two years ago now, that was one of his worst fears. Not only were they becoming parents of two newborn babies, but one of them had special needs too. How would they be able to balance it all?
Jimmy doesn’t seem 100% convinced, but he doesn’t seem ready to pounce either, so Dean concludes honesty
“Thank goodness they threw my wallet away once they emptied it, so I still have my ID and social security card, at least. And they only beat me until I gave up my stuff, but didn’t have more fun with me after that.”
But that’s the whole point, isn’t it? Dean has to do all the work. If he really wants to meet Castiel again, he will find a way to get there in time.
about himself, seeing as he's already opened up with Cas more than he's ever done with anyone outside his family and his inner circle of friends. He wants to know everything Cas wants to tell Dean about himself. He wants to go to Cas at the end of a working day. He wants them to fall asleep together and wake up together. He wants to be the lucky person who'll make Cas the two cups of coffee that turn the ogre into a sparkling, generous soul in the morning, Dean thinks as a smile tugs at his lips. Dean wants Cas to be the person he’s been feeling was missing from his life lately. He just doesn’t know if Cas feels the same.
Logically, Dean knows they should slow down and talk. He still has no idea what this is for Cas. But he doesn’t want to. He
“No. Now is a good time, let’s go.” Cas abandons his glass on one of the tables on his way out and walks away without turning to make sure he’s been followed. That’s one man who
They absolutely needed to talk. Point was, it was impossible for Dean to catch Cas alone for even a second while at the coffee shop, so when it was time for him to go to class he texted him asking what time they could meet later.
When the time to leave the office finally comes, he practically sprints out of there, sending Cas a text to tell him he’s on his way.
“Very well. Welcome to Singer’s body shop. I’ll let my son show you the ropes. Holler if you need anything.”
midnight blue underwear? Cas clearly wanted Dean to lose his mind, but joke’s on him because Dean’s in his personal heaven.
“Yes, yes, please, Cas, I-,” Dean’s ready to keep going, to say despicable things to get Cas inside of him again, but he doesn’t have to.
That’s why he’s shocked when he feels the cold of a lubed-up toy instead of the warmth of his Dom’s cock breach his hole, and he can’t help crying out when a low vibration starts and stimulates his prostate deliciously. He’s even more shocked to be flipped over so he’s on his back on the bed. He has just a few seconds to wonder what his mate has in store for him when the most beautiful omega in the world straddles his hips and starts slowly, sensually sinking down on Dean’s cock until it is surrounded by the most incredible heat.
mouth, all his possessive instincts kicking into gear at the idea that Cas loves swallowing his come and his come alone.
Finally forcing himself to get up to start his day allows for even more items to be added to his pros list.
Once he’s done eating, Castiel goes to retrieve the cough medicine from his bag and replies to Dean’s questioning look with “I’m taking the last dose of the cough medicine you gave me. I read the instructions and they say to keep taking it even if the cough gets better, as it did in my case.”
Giving Jimmy instructions and going back to the potatoes give Dean a chance to get lost in his head for a few more minutes. Which he desperately needs, after the epiphany that he has the hots for the man currently setting the table for their dinner together.
Silence is the only reply Dean gets. No self-punishment then. Jimmy didn’t choose this. Dean’s even more intent on helping him now.
Cas's faces transforms right away. From frowny and worried to delighted and pleased. "That's great, Dean. Bathroom's that way. We can watch a film or something once you're done or," he hesitates, "we could go straight to bed?"
“Anyway, after those first few months, I reverted to my usual self. Strictly monogamous, and not inclined to sleeping around too much either.”
“Just,” Dean forces himself to say, licking his lips, “give me a minute. I’ve been thinking about this for so long, just let me enjoy the view.”
Cas isn’t tense, he’s not stealing glances over his shoulder, not breathing heavily. He seems almost serene, like there is no other place he’d rather be.
So Dean’s future, which is now his present, is anything but lacking. On the contrary, it’s plentiful, rich, and bright.
A green light. ‘If you wanna tell me, I wanna know. If not, it’s OK, go ahead, I trust you’. Cas truly was perfect.
He lets both his hands travel downward on Dean’s back until they reach the thong and his fingers can grip its hem and start sliding it down. Castiel needs to actively prevent himself from being too eager and check if Dean’s indeed wearing a plug right away. He can’t be the Dom who edged his boy for almost two hours once to teach him patience, reducing his then fiancé to a whimpering mess by the end of it, but then act like an impatient schoolboy himself.
“I‘m so relieved you like burgers too,” Dean says while he’s still chewing his bite. The box for “good table manners” would certainly
Only his strict upbringing and his consequent ability to keep a lid on his emotions at all times allowed him to remember they were
God. Dean couldn’t even begin to imagine living like that. How strong is this man, and everyone else who find themselves  in a similar condition and yet keep going?
He was totally unprepared for it too, the first time Castiel came face to face with him. He thought Dean was a jackass harassing poor Jack and had barreled into the breakfast room ready to toss the man out on his ass, when Dean had turned around and made Castiel’s systems shut down one by one. Those green eyes, those heart shaped, plush lips, and those freckles. Castiel stopped being able to think for a few seconds and even forgot he was supposed to be furious with him.
Obviously Cas knows that Dean is OK with both the place and time, Dean has literally suggested both, after all. But shouldn’t Cas have... asked? What if Dean needed a few pointers on how to get there? He just got to one of the biggest cities in the world for the first time in his life not even four hours ago, for fuck’s sake!
The stall they’re in is one of those separated by an actual wall and with a door that gets all the way to the floor. Thank goodness for historical buildings designed by architectures obsessed with Roman style and that appreciate not hearing other people’s noises while they take care of their physiological needs. Dean’s always loved the old and majestic courthouse and he counts himself blessed that
When the door to the bunker came into view, Castiel’s heart started beating faster. His human reactions had definitely increased in intensity and number. He killed the engine, and took a deep breath, eyes fixed on the bunker door. He grabbed his phone, turned off the music and pocketed it. He exited the car, retrieved his bag from the back seat, and locked it. He started walking towards the door, taking measured steps, trying to bring the beating of his heart back under control. He raised his hand to knock but found that he couldn’t do it. He didn’t want to do it. He refused to knock on the door of what used to be his house. Not his home. His house. Dean was his home. Always had been.
Cas was wary but quick to obey. This wasn’t what he expected and it was clearly throwing him off balance. Just like Dean wanted.
is worse than being called 'Sir' by 20 somethings. That‘s started to happen more and more frequently and Dean feels like an ancient Egyptian relic every time. Especially as, while Dean is still in that limbo between baby face and grown up, his gorgeous boyfriend has officially joined the salt and pepper club, and him becoming a total Daddy was apparently included in the membership. He's exactly the kind of mature and still totally in shape man Dean himself would have drooled over when he was barely legal.
The nights Cas spends at Dean’s become the highlight of Dean’s week. Cas insists on helping as much as he can to “earn my keep, Dean”. He starts by having Dean teach him how to use the washing machine and the dryer, so he can take care of his own laundry. Then he suggests he could also help in the kitchen, which is how they end up cooking their dinners together and even start trying out new recipes. Dinner time is usually spent talking about anything and nothing in particular, but it’s always a chance to learn even more about Cas. Like his love for literature and the fact that, now that he’s fairly presentable for at least a couple of days after spending the night at Dean’s, he’s taken to spend those days in the public library, which is both warm and full of novels. Even though that’s still not ideal, Dean can’t help but feel happy about it. Whenever he has any proof that the help he’s giving Cas has an effect not only on the nights he spends at his place, but on the rest of his days too, he feels marginally better at the idea of Cas still being homeless. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t hate with a passion whenever Cas talks about
Not when the commitment is the smoldering hot, toiletries recycling, benefactor of kids in need, deliciously teasing, lavender enthusiast, adorably dorky, bee saving, most amazing hotel owner and boyfriend in the world.
“Then take off your clothes and lie face down on the bed,” Dean says, no longer screaming, but with a coldness in his voice that’s usually not there.
to help. I’d let you live here while you get back on your feet if you accepted that. I already suggested it, remember? I heard what you said, and I respect that. But I’d hoped that my offer made it clear enough that my door is
“I had to find a way to avoid doing or saying anything that could even remotely suggest sleeping with me was the price to pay to be here. I couldn’t have lived with myself if I did.”
Dean starts fucking his fiancé like he means business, because he does, pouring all the many emotions he’s going through now and has been going through over the last two weeks in the motion of his hips, so he can fuck and fuck and
All bets are off. There’s no chance Castiel could ever deny Dean now. Dean really had feelings for him in high school. And the way Castiel had all but cut ties with him after the locker room had hurt Dean as much as Castiel, although for different reasons. Castiel had been crashed by doubt, disappointment and disillusionment. Dean by guilt and self hatred. A self hatred he probably couldn’t even understand fully back then. Because it stemmed from his lack of courage to come out when he still didn’t understand that was even the reason, as he only acknowledged his bisexuality years later.
told something to his best friend when someone else knew. Charlie was as endearing as she was dangerous, after all. He did, however, told everyone to back off until he and Cas would decide whether their relationship was “let me introduce you to my folks” material.
Blinding jealousy surges through Dean, he clenches his jaw and his fists, and when Cas breaks eye contact and leans back against Benny’s front, tilting his head up and offering even more room for the guy to banquet on his flesh, he feels the spell between them breaking like a punch to his guts.
“No, Dean, please, let me finish. Part of me wants to jump at the offer, so bad. But, I don’t want to take advantage. I can keep sleeping in the street when it’s not too cold or it isn’t raining, or go to the shelter four blocks from my spot when it is. I-, I haven’t gone there too often so far to leave space for older homeless people who can’t face even the kind of cold I’ve dealt with until now, since it’s one of the few shelters in the city where you don’t get charged for a bed, but now that’s getting colder I’m gonna have to.”
Castiel hums. Dean knows what he’s thinking. That he’s trying to manipulate him. Dean would think the same, if he were Castiel. Dean holds his breath and prays to every deity out there that not telling Castiel sooner about him moving to New York won’t cost him his chance.
So the idea is for them to play with each other’s soft kinks while also playing with their own. While the role-play they’re enacting is very much a kink of Castiel’s, heels, lingerie and make-up are Dean’s. He’s the one who likes to doll up like that on occasion, because it makes him feel pretty, sexy and confident. Castiel is not surprised, then, that Dean would choose make-up as his surprise contribution to the scene. He can’t deny he isn’t happy about it. Yes, he’d never been much into his subs wearing make-up or sexy shoes or lingerie, and that’s why he had put down those as kinks he was only mildly interested in when he and Dean signed their contract. But, ever since he’s started scening with Dean, his appreciation for them has definitely increased. Dean is, in a word, beautiful. Objectively, undeniably beautiful, by any standard. His face is impeccable. And so is his body. Tall, strong but still lean, as he’s not filled up completely yet, with toned shoulders, pecs and abs, but no hard or sharp lines, a waist that narrows down impossibly and gives way to a pair of adorable bow legs and a small, perky ass. A face like his cannot but be complemented incredibly well by light make-up, and a body like that becomes even sexier when perched on a pair of stiletto heels and cocooned inside sexy lingerie.
With a clear plan in mind, he started ticking items off his to-do list until he found himself behind the wheel of his rental car. How was Dean going to tease him for it. Castiel found himself smiling at the thought. He so hoped Dean would tease him for the pretty awful, but totally affordable, car he had rented to go back to him. He’d have to be happy to see him to do that, right?
His mind goes back to the reviews then, many of which point out precisely that. That Hotel Eden is a hotel like few others, where hospitality isn’t a job but a mission, and the more Dean stays here, the more he understands why all those reviews are so stellar. Dean hopes he’ll get to meet the owner with the weird name, as almost every review sings his praise as the most welcoming person on the planet.
“He’s busy with a Skype call right now. But he wants you to know that if you call again at 3.30 pm sharp, he’ll probably be free.”
When Dean enters the building, a woman is waiting for him in the lobby and approaches him as soon as he walks through the door. She introduces herself as Hannah, Cas’s PA. Hannah tells Dean that Cas has instructed her to show Dean the way to his office. Given that she was immediately able to recognize him, Cas must have showed her a picture of him. Dean has texted Cas many pictures of himself. Cas must have kept them. Dean has to fight with himself to be able to hold a polite, mature conversation with Hannah, when all he wants to do is giggle like an idiot and smile all proud and pleased because
It worked like a charm. Cas unclenched his fists that were resting on the counter and took a deep breath, spreading his hands on the surface and relaxing his shoulders a bit, looking at Dean like a lifeline.
That’s how Hotel Eden was born: a beautiful, quiet place, good enough for both peace and sin, just like its biblical namesake. Castiel was interested in creating a welcoming and peaceful environment, but he wasn’t so naive that he didn’t know what happened behind the closed doors of a hotel room more often than not. And considering how religious his family were, himself and his siblings having been named after angels and the whole ‘you are disowned because homosexuality is a capital sin’ bullshit, he saw this name choice as a golden opportunity to say a not so subtle ‘fuck you’ to his parents and their religious fervor.
Cas doesn’t reply, just stares at Dean for a few seconds, until his face softens a bit. Dean supposes honesty is hard to hide.
“Dean!” as his arms gave out and his whole upper body fell on the bed, while his delectable ass remained up in the air for Dean to do with as he pleased. Dean almost expected Cas to come then, but he didn’t, he just kept up his delirious singing and rocking back motion while his hands were working to find purchase on the sheets and his head didn’t seem to be able to stay still.
A bit more than two years later, three months ago now, they got married. Once again, Dean had taken matters into his own hands and proposed, shocking Castiel into silence. “Are you sure, Dean?” He’d replied, not unlike he had done when Dean asked him out the first time, shocking the younger boy just as much. “Of course I’m fucking sure, Cas, I’m proposing! What kind of question is that?” Dean had answered, his eyes hardened, his body closed off and distant all of a sudden, his whole being bracing for rejection. “It’s a question I need to ask. Because there is nothing more that I want,” Castiel had started to word vomit in spite of himself. “I
to marry you, and be yours forever, but Dean, I’m the only man you’ve ever been with. And you’re only 21. So I need to ask, are you sure? 100% sure you want this? Because I cannot have you like that and lose you, my precious boy, it’d kill me.”
Dean takes a look around. At the mess of boxes populating what is supposed to be the living room of his sparsely furnished new apartment. In New York City. Where Dean has just moved. After saying goodbye to his family and friends and colleagues in Kansas City. Because working his ass off has paid off and he was offered a promotion, which he promptly accepted even though it required him to move to the East coast. In fact, it would probably be more honest to say that he had accepted it
“I love you too, Dean. So much. This isn’t just sex for me either. You aren’t just a beautiful body and a stunning face. You’re the man of my dreams, Dean.”
“He is, but we thought it would be more entertaining for the kids and also more useful for their cognitive development if we also have the books, so Sam can read them aloud while we video call and we can look at the pictures while he reads. We also thought we adults could read different parts, voicing the different characters”
Dean’s determined to help change that any way he can. Starting with showing Cas that he doesn’t have to solve every problem alone. That Dean’s more than happy and ready to help. And it’s not like Dean is gonna force Cas into accepting his plan either. He’s just gonna give him the option, and let Cas decide. He really hopes he’ll say yes though.
"I always like to know what I'm getting myself into," Castiel said and wow if that voice didn't make a shiver run through Dean. He'd known from the club that it was a smooth, dark voice with a very sexy quality, perfect to boss people around. But hearing it without all the music and general loud mess of the club in the background was a totally different experience, and he was pretty sure that if he could have had sex with a voice, this would be it. He could still have sex with the sexy owner of the sexy voice though. Next best thing.
Except, it totally could. Dean was no other than the proud owner and driver of “Baby”, the sexy, black muscle car that might have starred in one or two of the sexual fantasies Castiel indulges in before bed when he feels like getting himself off. He might have dreamed to ride the driver of the car in its backseat a few times.
a guilty verdict. For the kid, sure. For justice, sure. But for himself too. For Novak. For anyone in their community who needs to know that there are people fighting for their rights.
“So that’s why you decided to open a hotel? I mean, being able to speak foreign languages must come in handy here, right?”
Still smiling, he tells his boyfriend “Why don’t you sit now, you deserve to relax a bit” before stealing a quick peck. For reassurance. And for the sake of it. Because he can, and because Dean’s lips are the softest, and he wants to kiss them always. Always.
After closing the bathroom door, Dean takes a moment to lean against it, head tilting toward the ceiling and a stupid grin on his face. He's staying the night, because Cas asked him to. Because they had sex – clothed, non-penetrative, more suited for high schoolers than grown ass men sex, but still
Dean doesn’t give a fuck, he realizes. That wouldn’t make this moment any less perfect. Many things haven’t gone according to his careful planning so far, but he doesn’t feel like anything was ruined. No. Everything just was as
“I know we should’ve had dinner and pie first and then I should have done this, but I’m so nervous I
That statement is not accompanied by an underling tone of worry, like Castiel has heard in the past when the men who’ve bottomed for him realized his dick was about to be pushed into their asses. No, Dean’s tone is eager and pleased. Dean can’t wait to be speared on Castiel’s cock.
That’s a deep voice if Dean’s ever heard one. But the man has been coughing up a storm for the last couple of minutes, so that has probably something to do with it.
Cas had been hurt by his words and had debated telling Dean the whole truth, but ended up doing it because he couldn’t expect Dean to always be truthful with him if he was the first one to be dishonest with his boyfriend. Dean had been
Cas replied with “OK”, without showing any sign of emotion and without so much as looking at him, focused as he was on counting the change to give him. Admittedly, it was not like it was set in stone they had to meet every day and it was not like Dean was half hoping to see Cas pout a little and have him demand something special in retribution for their lost time together, but still.
He’s pulled out of his musings when a pornographic sound – there’s no other way to describe it – leaves Jimmy’s mouth.
As he’s going back home, the bright mood starts giving way to anxiety. Dean knows the news he’s bringing is
So it’s not difficult to see how the same applies to Cas. “If I was a better person,” Cas had said the previous night. Never knowing acceptance in your life, especially when you’re a kid, cannot but convince you, in the long run, that you’re a shitty person, and are wired wrong.
Dean blinks a couple of times against the morning light, which is... brighter than usual. Right, he didn’t set his alarm because he doesn’t have to work this morning so he can-.
“Look at you, your shoulders and arms are so strong, your back so big, these hips are delicious and this ass, God, this ass. The universe really did get close to perfection when you were made.”
When he gets to the restaurant and sees Dean already waiting for him by the entrance, his face lighting up the moment his eyes land on him, Castiel feels that he would say “Yes”, if he had to make that decision at this very moment. Yes, there would definitely be other chances. Dean is so fucking beautiful, and his glee is making Castiel feel like a king.
Even without him saying a word or lifting his gaze, Dean’s body gives his reaction away. He’s deduced what’s in store for him and
Closing his eyes shut tight is Dean’s instinctive response. Cas sure knows how to bring Dean to his knees – figuratively and, often, literally – with just one word.
“And, you know, they’re right,” he adds with what he hopes it’s a reassuring smile that will keep at bay any worry Castiel might have that he’s a total creep.
As usual, I hope you enjoy this and hope you and your loved ones are keeping safe, wherever you are.
Dean knows he is, of course he knows, and lifts Cas’s head with a finger under his chin until their eyes lock. “I love you, Cas. I love you so much.”
Castiel is paying more attention now, studying him with intent for the first time. Dean can see a small glimpse of the attention that those eyes used to always reserve for him when he was a kid. Castiel hums noncommittally though and asks “So, what is it that you do anyway?”
The first thing Dean does is changing his plans. The shower can wait. He’s gonna eat his breakfast first. Even before he opens the bag, he know what he’s going to find: black coffee and a lemon and ricotta pancake. The same order he placed when they went to Sarabeth’s together. Apparently, Dean is not the only sap between them. This is gonna be
Dean’s relieved smile spreads on his face like the sun rising. He’s so beautiful. How did Castiel get so lucky?
When he asks Dean to roll over, a little crease appears between his brows and a flash of disappointment appears in his eyes, but he smooths both away quickly. Not quickly enough that Castiel doesn’t see. “Trust me, Dean, I’ve got you.” Castiel hopes his smile and his eyes are able to convey his sincerity. He
The most perfect man Castiel has ever met in his life. The kind of perfect one doesn’t think can ever be real.
His eyes never leaving Dean’s, Cas started swaying on the spot, taking Dean along for the ride. Cas had been right, they really didn’t need dancing classes for this. They were barely moving.
In the end, it was Dean’s need to help Jimmy that won out and, having noticed the man had a sturdy water-proof jacket with a hood, but no sleeping bag, just a cardboard and his blanket, Dean went back the following day after work. Besides bringing him a dinner of vitamin water, a Caesar salad and a bar of chocolate, Dean insisted until Jimmy accepted a sleeping bag he had been gifted years before and never used because going camping just wasn’t his thing. Having gone through the gag gifts he had got in the last few years too, he also decided to give Jimmy a Little Mermaid-themed hoodie, absolutely hideous but very warm, that his colleagues had given him for his birthday last year, and some of the awful socks Sammy seemed to think it was a
Dean might lie. But that would bring him nowhere. If Castiel gives him a second chance, and that is a monumental if, the truth would come out sooner or later, and ruin everything. Dean knows that when you get a second chance after hurting someone, you spend
That shocks Dean enough that he stares at Castiel wide-eyed for a few seconds, opening and closing his mouth a couple of times. “Abused at home? Man, my family couldn’t be more loving and supportive if they tried. I came out to them on the first day of spring break in my third year of college. Next thing I know, my mom is signing up both my parents for the next meeting of PFLAG and my baby brother is commenting that “I am so greedy I couldn’t even leave one gender to those poor bastards who don’t look like me”.” Dean’s smile and handshake are far less sad now. That’s actually one of the memories he’s more fond of. One that has helped him get himself out of a funk more times than he can count.
He had done everything in his power to convince his senior colleagues to let him go, set as they were to take the opportunity to leave work behind for a few days – as if attending the conference wasn’t about work too. He had to promise to bring them coffee every morning for a month and even take up some of their most time-consuming and frankly boring as fuck assignments before they relented. Honestly, Dean had got away with it way more easily than he had thought he would. He was prepared to wash their cars for a couple of weeks. He suspects his colleagues realized it was something he really wanted and that they let him off the hook relatively easy because they kinda liked him. See, young Dean? That’s what you get for treating people with respect. They don’t make you wash their cars.
I'll confess that I'm waaaay sadder than I thought I'd be to see these two go. I'm happy that I know they'll be happy, they sure deserve that, but I grew attached to them and their story more than I thought I would at the beginning (when I still thought this'd be a quick one-shot until my Muse went "AH! Hold my beer" on me), so I really wanna thank everyone who's read along and shared their thoughts with me in whatever form... reading, commenting, leaving kudos, subscribing, bookmarking, putting tags or comments in their bookmarks, or just simply checking this out. I've come to love this fic so much that I can't but be absolutely delighted when I know any of you loves these two sweet souls too. And I hope you know how big the smile each of you has put on my face with your feedback has been: you've all been so sweet and kind to me, I'm beyond grateful.
All of this clearly required further investigation, and an independent opinion from an external source.
Castiel isn’t worried about having sexual fantasies about Dean, nor about them being increasingly more urgent in both frequency and content. His physical attraction to Dean has never been in question. It isn’t even the crux of the matter. The real issue is whether Castiel’s heart and mind are falling for Dean again, and, if so, whether it is now safe for them to do so or not.
Dean knows because he checked how long would it take Cas to go from his office to their meeting point with public transportation – which is a guess because Cas might as well have his own car or get a taxi, but if Cas is anything like Dean, he would go for the most eco-friendly, or less eco-monstrous, solution, which is public transport. That’s what everyone should do, really, but especially someone working in their field. Dean is actually curious about this particular aspect. As much as he dreams of being with Cas, he also knows that 15 years is a long time and people change a lot in that long. Dean himself is proof of that. And if his bigger fear is that Cas won’t like him, his second biggest fear is that
“An absolute shame. We can’t spoil any single detail of the amazing evening my boyfriend has planned for us.”
“I know,” Dean replies with a big smile, leaning down to kiss Cas again. Why had they stopped kissing anyway? Oh well, it’s not important. They can just go back to doing it and never stop.
“Why do you wanna help me, Dean? You don’t even know me. For all you know, I might be a monster, I might deserve this.”
“Oh, I am. They do say revenge is better served cold. I believe fifteen years is enough time for it to be just the right degree of cold, wouldn’t you agree?”
On the other hand, did Castiel want Dean to finally confess his feelings out of regret, when he was emotionally shaken, rather than as a consciously made decision to start a relationship with him no matter what? No, he wanted the hunter to give himself to Castiel freely, and wholeheartedly.
. He can’t take his eyes off of Dean’s cock, which is now fully hard, and red, and leaking, and perfect.

Everything looks fresh and is very well presented and lifting his gaze from the table allows Dean to see a big square in the wall thanks to which everyone can look into the kitchen, where Dean can see a cook and another man he assumes is a waiter dealing with warm dishes. So this is not a place where warm dishes are prepared beforehand and left in those metallic containers to keep warm. They are made
Castiel goes to bed excited and worried in equal measure, but his last thought is something along the lines of maybe tomorrow being the day when he’ll finally get to taste Dean’s lips. That kiss is long overdue. Fifteen years overdue.
I also wish to thank everyone who's been in touch in whatever form about the first chapter: the love and support really help *so much* when posting a WIP and I'm so thankful for each and every comment, kudo, subscription or bookmark.
get down to some funny business together. Which is just as ridiculous. As if. Dean wouldn’t slum like that even if he
Love was joined by regret when he sang that “Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole, You're so much braver than I gave you credit for” and that “You are the bearer of unconditional things, You held your breath and the door for me, Thanks for your patience”. And when Cas dropped his gaze for the first time and his voice wavered when he whispered more than he sang “You're the best listener that I've ever met, You're my best friend, Best friend with benefits, What took me so long?”, and then raised those forget-me-not blues to plead forgivenees, Dean couldn’t help but cut his husband off with a searing kiss, which prompted the people in attendance to clap and whistle, oblivious as they were of the emotional turmoil the two of them were going through.
from Monday to Friday, and of-fucking-course had been scheduled late in the evenings. That meant that Dean spent a good part of what was ‘The take it easy week’ at the café working harder than ever, and that he never finished in time to go see Cas before the coffee shop closed.
“I know what I said. But we don’t have to do anything if you’re not ready yet. I never want you to feel pressured, Cas. I just wanna feel close to you. We don’t have to go all the way for that.”
“Yes, Dean, you have. Which is why I need to do this this way. Because if I stayed, the doubt I only befriended you because of the stability you could offer me would always be there. But that’s-,” he understands Dean’s need to sigh and think like never before. How to phrase it?
Castiel was expecting that. It was kind of implicit, really, so he doesn’t understand why Dean seems to be nervous again.
to do with how Dean’s lived their sex life recently though. The jumbled mess in his head these past weeks ended up taking away Dean’s confidence in bed. Just like with everything else, he started second guessing himself, wondering whether he was still enough for Cas, especially considering the premium quality twink competition. That meant that more often than not he wasn’t really focused on enjoying himself as much as on being as slutty and enticing as possible.
But why didn’t those reasons seem to matter now, not as much as going back and finding a healthy way to fix his relationship with the hunter? Maybe the distance had helped? Time healed all things, the saying went. Could it be that? Was that why Dean had been able to offer such an honest, heartfelt and heartwarming apology? He’d had enough time to think? Possibly talk to somebody?
Before Castiel has a chance to even open his mouth to reply, Jack supplies “Mister N lets us stay here for a few nights from time to time, when the shelter is at top capacity. And if he needs help he also lets us work, and he
tired of lying and tell himself it wasn’t so. As for learning to fly high… Well, as Dean would say, ‘been there, done that.’ Castiel had flown as high as he possibly could. Even far higher than his station, when he foolishly believed he could be the new God this planet needed. A job he had absolutely sucked at, by the way. Being able to fly hadn’t helped him keep his home and his family. Maybe, it was no coincidence that he was now going back precisely when he was still unable to fly.
Castiel had also seen Dean fending off the advances of a number of delegates, men and women alike, who seemed to be attracted to him like moths to a flame. That, too, was in stark contrast with the image Castiel had of Dean, someone who would sleep around with just anyone. An image which, according to what Dean had just told him, had never overlapped with reality anyway. Dean’s behavior at the conference seemed to confirm it, even though that, too, could be chalked up to Dean being smarter than mixing work and casual sex. It was undeniable, however, that Dean had been generally polite, but firm, in turning each and every one of them down. His tense shoulders and the practiced ease with which he would let them down, however, had made Castiel suspect that that was a far more frequent occurrence than it was probably acceptable in a working environment. Having a face like Dean’s could be both a blessing and curse, Castiel mused.
He isn’t a saint – it’s not like he doesn’t get anything in return. Quite the opposite, in fact, since he makes a lot of money out of it. He can’t deny that, nor is he ashamed of it. Partly because he invests a huge part of his own money in green start-ups he considers promising, to maximize the chances someone will come up with helpful solutions. And partly because he has always firmly believed that honest work deserves to be rewarded.
looking forward to, tomorrow’s Castiel will be pretty sated and proud, after all. Especially when he’ll see the disappointment on people’s faces when they realize Dean is officially taken.
overboard. He’s bringing the man a burger and fries, hot tea he got from a 24/7 open diner he found along the way and a bottle of water, in addition to some over the counter cough medicine and Kleenex tissues he stopped to buy at the convenience store next to the burger joint. He’s no doctor, but that was a pretty bad cough and this stuff can only do the man good.
Once he gets there though, it becomes super clear that Cas has no intention of letting anyone assume anything. He intends to let them
At the same time, the other two secondary genders are also screwed over. Alphas and betas are raised to always act in relation to this notion. Since omegas are bitches, alphas need to be strong tops, so they can provide for their mates’ needs properly, especially when in heat. It stands to reason, then, that showing weakness, physical or mental, is out of question. No weak alpha would ever be good enough, not even for the least desirable of omegas. Hence, alpha boys and girls aren’t allowed, not even as kids, to cry or complain. “Stop whining, that’s something reserved for omegas,” “Good alphas don’t cry,” “Stop behaving like an omega and alpha up.” These are just a few of the most recurring ‘words of wisdom’ young alphas are raised with. The number of alphas who live their lives feeling inadequate is pretty high as a result. Unless they are not only by nurture, but also by nature, sexist assholes who truly believe being born with a knot automatically makes them top dogs, that is.
Castiel supposes there is no way to convey ‘please don’t disappear on me even though I lied to you’ that doesn’t make you sound lame and desperate, is there?
“OK, I’ll come get you at the end of my shift and you can shower at my place. I’ll probably be later than usual though, as I’ll have to make up for showing up late this morning.”
desired. He’s a man, and Dean has always preferred men to women, but, again, never dared to admit to it aloud because his father would always talk about it as a necessary chore: “Male omegas have needs too, Dean, and alpha women are far less common than us, so it is our duty to help when need be, even if we’d rather not.” Little did his father know that a male omega had
But Castiel can’t, in all honesty, say that he doesn’t like what they are doing now even more. This slow, exploratory dance of their mouths and hands. This light brushing of lips and fingers. It’s unhurried. The consequence of them having time. Having time to do what they want, and only what they want. There’s no pressure, no expectations, none of them will be gone tomorrow if they don’t get to the finish line tonight. Only now is Castiel realizing that really was the source of his fear earlier. Bless Dean for catching up on it and removing it with just a few words. This man is truly unbelievable. Castiel has made peace with the fact that the evidence of that will simply keep piling up.
. He wants to see whether Novak will give him what he’s asking, even though it’s a difficult thing to ask of him right now. So when he does, when this big, strong, capable, smart, smoking hot man obeys Dean’s silent request even when his brain is soaking in an ocean of endorphins and he can barely think, Dean’s own pleasure spikes and his mind shoots a quick succession of incrementally filthy images showing just how creatively they could exploit Novak’s obedience. Dean’ll make sure to turn at least a good half of those images into reality soon.
in his boyfriend’s eyes and then his face is smashed against the pillow, he’s on his front on the mattress and Cas is on top of him, thrusting hard and fast and
When he opens his eyes, the ceiling is the first thing he sees, and the sound of his breathing as his lungs are working to regulate it the first thing he hears. His hands are still on Cas’s shoulders, and Cas’s hand is still circling his cock. The smell of sex and leather has intensified.
“OK, so, like I said I haven’t done this in a while. But you’ll tell me if you’re uncomfortable, yes?”
wait. He moves faster and more eagerly than before at first, only to catch and force himself to slow down after a few moments, so he can play the part of someone who’s only doing their job, rather than hoping to get rammed within an inch of their life after having been bent over a table.
A handful of seconds later, Dean hears the front door click shut. The silence in Dean’s apartment – and in his life – has never been so deafening.
Dean was man enough to admit that maybe, possibly, at least in part, he had started to develop feelings for Cas. A little. Not much. Just, you know, a tiny bit. Nothing to worry about, of course. But signs kept piling up, and could no longer be ignored.
On the day of their anniversary, Gabe invents a number of “absolutely necessary errands that need to be completed by the end of today, bro, they just can’t be put off any longer,” that are certain to keep Cas busy and out of their apartment for the whole day, while Meg helps Dean to get everything he needs in time and organize the place to his liking.
Dean couldn’t have told how much time they spent like that, a by now usual occurrence when he was with Cas, when he had an idea.
He was still very much a soldier back then, so he had thought of himself and his need to repent before thinking about Dean, about how that would have affected him. Even though Dean had, somehow, been able to rationalize Castiel’s staying away while in Purgatory to protect him – although Dean could have left but he hadn’t until he found Castiel, and even went as far as telling him he
of all people, can prove to him that people can be trusted, that will only help Castiel with the rest of humankind, right? Or not. Maybe Castiel is just humoring himself and his need to rationalize and overthink everything and to feel in control, when the truth is, quite simply, that he’s falling again for this man and cannot fathom the idea of breaking things off without knowing where this may lead.
“Don’t you think it was all my fault? If I had paid more attention at work, or if I was a better person that can form actual, meaningful relationships with friends and family-“
– out from the slit of his boxers and swallowing him whole. Cas is already hard. His cock is red, hot, dribbling precome, and Dean moans as his boyfriend’s flavor explodes on his taste buds while that damn smell of leather envelopes him. Castiel groaned when Dean first took him in his mouth and is now panting while his hands can’t stop caressing Dean’s hair and face.
Dean spent almost two hours at the coffee shop trying to keep a restless Charlie calm and buy himself enough time to increase the chances Cas would
They’ve talked about their favorite films, books and foods. They discussed how much Dean dislikes flying and people who wear sunglasses indoors (“You know who does that? Crazy people, and douchebags!”) and how uncomfortable Castiel is with anyone who’s too fervent from a religious point of view. Any of these topics have inevitably led the two of them to share bits and pieces of their past and share little anecdotes about their families and friends too.
“There you go, Dean,” Castiel announces his return with a tray filled to the brim of steaming, heavenly smelling goodness. In no time, a cup of black coffee and a plate with golden, fluffy pancakes and crispy bacon is placed in front of his very happy nose and eyes.
how much he dislikes certain people or behaviors is to put up a stoic mask and keep a blank expression. No reaction is better than disgust, he believes. That doesn’t exactly make him win brownie points as the most charming, amicable or hilarious of them all, Castiel knows that. He figures he’d be out of a job pretty quickly if he truly said what’s on his mind though, so he’ll take his reputation as a snotty know-it-all who looks down on people any day. That reputation prevents certain kinds of people from approaching him after all, so he can’t exactly say he’s oh so sorry about it. And those he does business with regularly know who he truly is and can’t be bothered to lend an ear to what the chatty Cathys who have taken up permanent residence in the grapevine have to say about him.
, hasn’t even realized what’s happening, too busy kissing and nuzzling Cas’s neck and pushing what Dean is sure is an impressive bulge against Cas’s ass.
Dean’s clearly shocked by his answer. Probably because most men would have played it cool. But Castiel has realized a lot of time ago that he’s not like most people, and that trying to be someone he’s not can only make him miserable, while at the same time still not being enough to make others happy. Add to this that Castiel has sworn to never again lie to this amazing man, who loves him and who he loves. Seeing the hurt look on his face when he confessed the lie about his name was enough for Castiel to decide, there and then, that he wouldn’t ever lie to Dean again. And he didn’t even love him back then, as incredibly fond of him as he already was, in spite of the still lingering fear that Dean might hurt him.
They had been together for three months at that point, but it was clear to the both of them that theirs wasn’t just a fling. They both wanted it to be it, and were conscious that getting along with your partner’s family was a big part of successful long-term relationships – unless your partner was the first not to want anything to do with their folks, which wasn’t the case for the two them.
It was during that week that Carl started visiting the diner, always during Maggie’s shift. He was good-looking, cocky, and with a give-‘em-hell attitude. He reminded Castiel of a younger Dean Winchester who still had a good day every once in a while. Which was how Castiel knew that Maggie didn’t stand a chance. Just like he himself never did.
Dean’s forced to start getting up earlier than usual. Not only because they both need to use the shower, but because his showers are getting longer and longer. He’s falling harder and harder for Cas, but he doesn’t dare make a move because he doesn’t want Cas to feel obliged to reciprocate. So jerking off in the shower to thoughts of all the things he wishes they could do together it is. As guilty as it makes him feel to come by his hand every morning while thinking of Cas pushing him against the tile wall from behind and whispering what a tight ass he has and how much he enjoys fucking it, Dean tells himself that letting off some steam is still better than making an unwanted and unsolicited move on Cas because he’s sexually frustrated.
Three days after that conversation, he was on his way to his new town. How different had it been to get to a new place knowing that there was a job, and people, waiting for him. His new boss had even helped him find his tiny, but nice and clean, apartment, and he even got a small discount on the rent for that, because his landlord and his boss were childhood friends. Not such a difficult concept to grasp in a town of a few hundred people. And he certainly couldn’t say that he was regretting his choice now, knowing it would take him far less to get to Lebanon from here than it would have taken him from Alaska or some other place equally distant.
“Yeah. I took my time in the shower,” Cas couldn’t stop he roll of his hips for all the money in the world, he needs to feel the burn blending with the pleasure caused by the warmth and thickness of Dean’s cock inside of himself, needs to feel it rub against his prostate and set his whole body alight, “I went slow, and
Two evenings ago, Castiel was looking for a book he was certain he’d stored in one of the bookcases in the breakfast room when he noticed Dean was lounging on one of the couches in the garden, seemingly lost in thought while watching the darkening sky. Book forgotten – Castiel still, two days later, doesn’t remember what book it was, so it probably wasn’t important anyway – he made his way outside before he even had time to ponder the decision.
His first bite sends Dean straight to heaven and he’s pretty vocal in his appreciation. He didn’t even do that on purpose, but he still has a pretty nice view of Castiel’s back muscles tensing and his head lifting up slightly from where it was bent on the table he was resetting when he heard Dean’s moan. Being vocal is a good way to rile Castiel up. Dean files the information away for later.
His thoughts stray from time to time to the organization of his day. He had meant to unpack before heading to work, but he’s obviously taking more time than he thought he would with breakfast, and has no intention of cutting it short. Who knows if the owner of the place supervising breakfast is a regular occurrence or not. Dean needs to make the most of this chance. But he has a recording session at the studio he cannot be late for, so unpacking his bags will have to wait until later when he gets back from work.
Jack’s voice interrupts Dean’s daydream and makes him realize he was still staring at the place Castiel had vacated when he left for the kitchen. Way to be subtle, Winchester.
‘Yes, you will,’ Dean thinks, getting off on the desperation in the man’s voice more than he probably should.
I couldn’t stomach anything and you’d notice, of course you would, and maybe get worried that I-, and that’s not how I wanted this to go, so-“
And he was... with someone. An alpha, Dean’s nose ascertained even busy as it was trying to inhale as much of the omega’s heavenly scent as possible. A short alpha, with longish hair, a prominent chin and a too long nose. Surely, this otherworldly omega wouldn’t settle for such an alpha, would he? He was not only shorter than Dean, he was shorter than the omega himself! Dean barely suppressed a growl at the thought of the omega,
Castiel’s plan seems to be derailing spectacularly though. He suspects that he’s not the one playing the game, but the one who’s been played.
“Best friend”, “brother”. Those words meant so much to Dean. Sam, his biological brother, had always been the most important person in Dean’s life, the one constant he could never do without, the person he had protected as fiercely as a God, standing up to Hell and Heaven alike, making reckless, questionable deals and decisions. How different was the notion of ‘brother’ Dean and Castiel had, at first. Castiel had thousands of brothers. Perfect, obedient, winged and grace-powered soldiers like him. But, as much as some of them were dear to him, like Balthazar, he didn’t love any of them even remotely as much as Dean and Sam loved each other. Or as Castiel had come to love the Winchester brothers in the years he’d spent with them on Earth. During that conversation, the two of them alone in Baby, Castiel already loved Sam like a brother, like Dean loved Sam. And he loved Dean. Not like a brother, not like Sam loved him.
Castiel decides there and then that’s he’s just gonna file away the sexual frustration he’s about to feel so he can retrieve it when he’ll finally get to fuck that ass, so he can be certain he’ll fuck it as long and as deep as it’s begging to be fucked right now.
Dean feels more than sees Novak gesturing at something on his left. Dean wouldn’t know for sure. His face and tongue are still buried in Novak’s ass and he’s happy to keep his eyes where they are. Thoroughly enjoying the view of the perfect hole in front of him fluttering around nothing and begging to be spread and owned.
"Yes," he says to Dean's chest, and Dean barely suppresses a groan when he realizes Novak's voice got even deeper with how many times the head of Dean's cock has kissed his throat. "I want to try that with you," he adds, raising his gaze and looking at Dean through his lashes.
“See that heart there? Just clicked on it and you’ll save the song as a favorite one”, Maggie had taught him the day before he left when he had shown up with his brand new phone.
the reason why Castiel decided to open the hotel, no. It was his endless love of humanity and his natural predisposition to give. In a word, that’s what Castiel is: a giver. He likes helping others, making them happy, making them feel accepted and welcome, just for who they are. It doesn’t take a shrink to see he has developed that attitude as a coping mechanism. He never felt welcome and accepted just for who he was growing up, so he made sure there would be somewhere in the world where that would always happen, where everyone would be welcome and accepted, no questions asked, no bargaining of any kind. No ‘if you this we’ll give you this’ – his parents favorite educative strategy. Just ‘I’ll give you this because you need it’ or ‘I’ll give you this because I know it will make you happy’.
Castiel would never forget the anguish and hopelessness he felt when he had to watch Dean lose control and shout “Every time! Every time we get close, it always falls apart! Every freaking time!” in front of him and Sam, before pushing everything off the table in anger, when he found out that Gabriel was gone, and the archangel grace with him. Just like the night at the hospital after Dean had been attacked by Alastair – when he said that the angels should have left him in Hell when they found out he had kick-started the apocalypse when he had used that razor the first time – he then added that, if the door to the apocalypse world couldn’t be open so they could go help Mary and Jack, there had been no point in him coming back at all. That had clearly been the straw that had broken the camel’s back. Dean was already under so much pressure that night. He had fought so hard to save apocalypse world Charlie. Because, Castiel knew, she was one of the people Dean still blamed himself for, just like he blamed himself for Kevin. In Dean’s eyes, Charlie had been another of those who paid with their life the affection and closeness they showed Dean. Even though it had been Charlie, an adult, smart woman, the one who had decided to become a hunter, even knowing how risky the job was.
“Your bl-? This is one of the blankets they handed out at the shelter, they said they had been donated... You, uhm, want it back?”
does. Those little high-pitched whimpers, those half-suppressed groans, those deep moans straight from the back of his throat. But it’s better if they don’t attract attention, and Dean’s not sure he’ll be able to behave himself if he also has those sounds to listen to, in addition to that perfect dick to jack off and those soft lips to kiss. He’s also the kind of man who loves to be in control of his partner’s pleasure. He wants to silence Novak just because he
He starts pulling out, which causes his boy to start whimpering “No, no, no, please, Sir” immediately, which only solidifies Castiel’s impression that Dean needs to be brought back to the present. “Shhh, darling boy, it’s alright, Sir is here,” he tries and calm him, as he helps his boy to stand up after he’s pulled out completely so he can turn Dean around.
Castiel sips his drink, rolls the liquid around in his mouth before swallowing it down, and palms his cock, all the while keeping his eyes on his perfectly still sub. He’s in need of some relief, that’s true, but he mostly does it to test Dean’s submission. Dean’s a whore for Castiel’s cock, and Castiel knows Dean hates it when he can’t watch or touch when Castiel plays with himself. It must be killing him to keep his position right now, but Castiel is delighted to see how obedient and submissive his darling boy is being. He definitely deserves a reward, and Castiel revels in the knowledge that Dean will appreciate it all the more for having worked for it.
That was enough to remind Castiel that the correct and respectful thing to do is learning about Dean at Dean’s pace, thanks to anything the other man decides he’s ready to share with Castiel during their conversations. Castiel simply cannot take advantage of being the person who’s putting a roof above Dean’s head right now.
, he still bought her a white gold bracelet with a charm representing two little figures, a boy and a girl, holding hands for her birthday. She cried when he explained they weren’t meant to represent her and Sammy, but her and Dean. “I mean, a brother and a sister can hold hands, right?”
,” and stilling his hips so that his whole length is buried inside of Dean’s ass to the hilt and his hands are gripping his sides so tight that Dean hopes they’ll leave behind bruises in the shape of fingerprints that Dean can have tattooed.
“That’s fair,” Dean acknowledges while looking Castiel right in the eye. He’s owing what he’s done, not running away from it. Castiel appreciates a man who takes responsibility for his actions.
“Now, I want you to be a very good boy and let me hear you without holding back. I want to hear every single noise you make. I wanna hear every noise
“No, I mean, you don’t have to eat or drink anything, of course. I just though, you know, some calories and something warm could help?”
Dean starts moving in the day after Cas asked him, having given Marv his one month notice and needing to vacate the place by the deadline – the smarmy guy
when I’m done, so maybe you’ll give me a break and let me have some peace of mind before you need to come back for more”, Cas says, as his fingers slip out of Dean’s hole and the blunt head of his cock presses against his entrance.
Castiel cups the side of his face with the hand which is not holding his glass, almost empty by now. “Look at me, beautiful boy.”
Once Cas has fastened the bracelet around it almost reverently, Dean is surprised to feel how grounded the leather against his skin makes him feel. Dean is loving being engaged
Until he remembers a beautifully vivid image of Dean’s back arching to allow Castiel’s cock to sheath itself as deep as humanly possible.
Ever since he lost his wings, Castiel had often regretted being unable to fly. He missed the ability to just go somewhere in a matter of seconds without having to be anchored to the ground.
He’s trying to appear more confident than he feels while also trying to fight his burgeoning panic and dismissing the alluring possibility of just getting the hell out of dodge before making a complete fool of himself when he spots Cas approaching.
He starts leaning forward and Dean gets the hint and lies back, opening his legs right away so Cas can slot in between them. They keep kissing, but Dean’s hating the feeling of Cas’s pants and buckle against his naked skin, Cas should be naked like Dean, so he sneaks his hands in between them and tries to open them.
He suspected having Dean all trussed up like that would be good. Not even in his wildest, most daring fantasies he’d imagined it would be
Sammy seems to disagree with that though. He’s clearly noticed that Castiel’s joined the club, and he even told Dean as much, the accusatory edge pretty clear in his voice, just like it was clear he was taking the piling signs of Cas’s presence in Dean’s apartment as ultimate evidence that he
He also puts a finger under his chin to tilt his head up a bit and kisses his pouty lips one more time, for good measure.
. Cas is a good man, who’s never known unconditional acceptance. And has developed the certainty that no one will ever truly want him for who he is and he needs to do everything on his own, because no one will ever be there to help, as a consequence.
tired of suppressing his feelings for this wonderful man, but he does something he always tries not to do. He lowers his gaze to Cas’s lips.
. He hadn’t heard any prayer with that much clarity in so long. In all fairness, he didn’t think anybody had prayed to him in all that time. He had asked Dean not to do that. He still talked to Sam regularly, even though he always made sure to go out of town to do that, in case Sam had ended up telling his brother about Castiel’s new number and Dean was tempted to track him down again. And he had told Sam to warn Jody, Donna and every other hunter they regularly worked with to let Sam know in case they needed Castiel, and the younger Winchester would pass the message along.
“Like I said, admirable,” Castiel repeats, with a tone meant to make Dean realize he won’t let him wave off his good heart and generosity a second time.
as tight-knitted as ever, and keeping the blanket wouldn’t make it any tighter, just like donating it wouldn’t make it any less tight. So, either he started using the blanket around the house, which he had no intention of doing because it truly was a thing of nightmares – Dean, being a mechanic, was generally good with his hands, but, alas, a fine knitter he was not – or he gave it away in the hope that it would keep warm someone who might need it.
But that was not something his past self was ready to admit, so what left his mouth was “You should stop checking me out like you
“Ok, but I need you to at least promise me something, Castiel. Promise you’ll come here on the nights when it’s really cold or it’s raining and you don’t find a bed at the shelter.”
It’s too late to go back now. Castiel likes Dean. Likes this version of Dean. He’s smart and funny and nerdy and good and he’s beautiful and sexy. And he’s Castiel’s, if Castiel wants him. And Castiel
“Dean, no-“ is the last thing Dean hears before he stands up and starts walking in the direction of the diner.
“I’m staying for two weeks,” Dean replies before taking a final sip of his coffee, hungry eyes fixed on Cas above the edge of his cup. “I’d love to discuss music with you, Cas.”
“I want you to take me out now, baby boy. You can kiss and lick my cock, but you cannot suck. Use your tongue and these precious lips of yours,” Castiel says while hooking his thumb on Dean’s lower lip, pushing it down a bit, “not your throat. I wanna see this pretty cherry lipstick you wore for me all smeared.” When he sees Dean leaning forward without unclasping his hands – because he’s
Cas looks at him with a fond smile. “Hello Dean. Just give him a moment to save this file and I’ll be right with you.”
“I don’t know how to be q-queer,” Dean says in response, his gaze dropping in shame, because Dean clearly doesn’t want to be happy and rather than throwing himself at the man of his dream after he’s told him he still wants him, Dean still chooses to point out the biggest fucking problem between them.
He resolved not to use his phone during that week and switched it off entirely. He only dared to go back to the motel two days after Dean’s visit, when he thought the chances of him still being there were next to none. Since he wasn’t leaving in a hurry after all, he wanted to retrieve his belongings. His bag with his old clothes, the novels he had bought, and his new clothes. For obvious reasons, he had never been one for earthly possessions, but he found that the idea of departing from those objects was unsettling. He figured it was because they weren’t so much objects as they were symbols. Symbols of the strength he had found to move on, even when his heart was shattered into a billion pieces. And reminders that, like he had done it once, he could do it again.
so he doesn’t end up doing something that might have Cas running for the hills not even 12 hours after officially moving in.
‘Don’t think about Cas dismantling you, Dean, don’t go there,’ his brain advises when it’s already too late.
The phone call Castiel had just had was evidence enough. Castiel hated being right sometimes. Not that he was right all the time. But he hated to be right in situations like this.
And that’s not even the problem. Castiel is smart enough to know that he wouldn’t need to worry if this was only about Dean’s pretty – nay stunning – face. If that was all there was, this wouldn’t be dangerous at all. Castiel is too smart and too proud to fall for a beautiful bad boy. If beauty is all the boy has to offer, that’s not even remotely enough for a man like Castiel Novak. As much as it hurt back in high school, the moment Dean exited that locker room was the moment Castiel swore he wouldn’t waste one more minute pining after him. When he had started falling for Dean he knew the chances he would turn out to be a moron were pretty high, but Dean hadn’t given any indication, until the locker room day, that he could be such an awful person. He was definitely a jock, and clearly enjoyed being worshipped like royalty among peasants, but he was never openly cruel or mean with anyone, never bullied anyone, and had never even treated the girls that threw themselves at him with disregard. At least not until he started making out with any cheerleader that was within kissing distance whenever Castiel was around. God, but Castiel
Castiel moves his hands to the table and puts his body weight on his arms, not at all certain his knees won’t give out on him, while he too starts taking deep breaths to calm his heart a little. He hasn’t pulled out yet. He loves being inside of his boy’s heat like this. When the edge has been taken off and he can just feel his love’s warmth around himself. From the corner of his eyes he sees the plug, which has moved slightly to the left from where he’d put it earlier, probably because of how much they’ve made the table shake. He has half a mind to grab it and plug his boy back up, and make sure that his come stays right where he’s put it. The possessive side of him is roaring that yes, he most definitely should do that. Castiel soothes that side reminding it that that’s not what tonight is about, that their scene’s already been intense enough and that his boy needs to be taken care of now, but that doesn’t mean Castiel won’t do it in the future. In fact, he’s just realized that plugging Dean’s ass for his next scene with Benny
Hope you guys enjoyed the update! I'm aiming to post Ch. 3 on Friday next week, and we'll see then how their little chat goes 😘
He could only sigh at the thought. That was what Castiel really wanted, wasn’t it? He wasn’t going back to Lebanon to go back to the bunker, or hunting. He wasn’t coming back because he needed a place to stay, or he missed Sam. He honestly didn’t miss hunting. And even though the idea of seeing Sam again was making him happier and happier by the minute, he had always been in touch with the younger Winchester, and could have arranged to meet him any time. And he didn’t need a place to stay. He had a place to stay, one that he even liked. No, he was going back for his hunter. He was going back for his love.
‘Oh yeah?’, Dean’s voice says in his head, piqued all of a sudden. ‘You did say you wanted to be sore over dinner.’
,” he replies, sounding desperate to his own ears and not caring one bit, as long as he gets to have Cas inside him again.
When he enters the bathroom he stops short at seeing his reflection in the mirror. He’s marked. There are bruises on his neck and shoulder. Where Cas sucked on his skin and bit him when he came last night.
“God, I wish you could see what I see. How incredible it is to see my cock disappear inside of you. Your little hole opening up and taking it all, like it was made for it. And it was, wasn’t it, beautiful? You were made to take me. You take me so well.”
He also noticed Cas’s expression – surprised first and confused later – when he spotted Dean, but he chalked it up to him being unused to seeing Dean with other people. He figured that, as soon as he’d realize how close Dean and Charlie were, he’d be as welcoming as ever.
A lesser man would feel smug about it. Dean just shrugs and replies “Told ya,” kissing Novak’s eye roll away before adding, “And there’s
Cas was so focused on whatever he was looking at on the counter that he didn’t even lift his head to check the door. It seemed like he hadn’t heard the door bell at all.
Dean’s every sense is stimulated beyond belief. The smell of come and leather mix in the air and go straight to Dean’s brain, Cas’s breath makes chills erupt on Dean’s neck where Cas’s tongue is lapping at the mark his teeth left behind trying to soothe it, Cas’s come is seeping through the fabric of his panties and making them even more wet than his own precome had already done.
Dean decided to add those damn ears just to irk Charlie, as payback for emotionally blackmailing him into attending those classes. He makes a mental note to buy Charlie a beer, possibly a fruit basket too, soon.
of Dean’s skin on display now – including his perfect cock, which, albeit still covered, is starting to fill out a bit and strain against the confinement of the panties. Dean
She smiles seductively and turns around to sashay toward a table at the back. When Castiel turns to look at Dean, expecting his eyes to be trained on what even Castiel can objectively admit is a pretty fine ass, he finds him still looking around and taking in every detail. Castiel is frankly starting to feel tired to be constantly surprised by this man.
“If you-,” Dean lifted his brow again. “Uhm, yes,” amended Cas before clearing his throat. “Yes, I do.”
rendition of his mother’s glare. Dean almost expected Balthazar to turn into a 6 foot tall stalagmite.
At least, Dean’s not gonna be worried about Cas’s wellbeing while he’s busy making his case with his dad. He’s obtained the promise that Cas won’t leave the house today and will stay tonight too. At first Cas was super resistant, saying he couldn’t possibly stay there while Dean wasn’t at home, that it was inappropriate and shit. Dean had to remind him that he’d been there a few times already, and that if he’d wanted to rob Dean he could have done it more than once by now. The image of Cas, safe and warm, wearing his usual pajamas after his morning shower and lying on the couch with a novel in one hand, a mug of hot tea in the other, a blanket over his lap and a relaxed expression on his face accompanies Dean to work and makes him smile.
Upping his game a bit and making it crystal clear just how close they were might help too, so Dean threw his arm around Charlie’s shoulders as he said “Heya Cas, I’ll have the usual and a soy latte for my favorite redhead here, plus a slice of apple pie to share.”
Dean swore, slipping and falling into the snow when he tried to turn to catch up. The rooster glared triumphantly from his new perch, looking like a tiny, feathery gargoyle.
He set Baby in park and got out (no chickens, thank goodness. Imagine if he knocked on Cas’s door with an angry rooster under one arm), while failing to stuff the Bad Thoughts into the
when he got to the Impala. Castiel returned the farewell by waving Petunia’s paw. Dean grinned, one hand on the egg carton as he reversed out of the gravel driveway.
He found himself mistaken, however, when two strong arms wrapped around his waist and a sleepy body curled against his back.
“I….” Dean gazed at Castiel, half-convinced this was a dream, that he’d wake up under his own covers and grasping at what could be.
Dean took a shaky breath, a million things running through his head. Castiel’s warm hands on his own, the unfamiliar sensation snake scales under his palms moving slowly over his fingers,
still misjudge rising or baking times. Sometimes the yeast doesn’t bloom and the loaf falls flat.” He tipped over the bowl, forming it into a circle like Dean did. “Or the kneading is too much or too little, or the humidity inside is too low or high. It takes plenty of time and practice, and while I have come far in my skills, they do not shield me from error.”
“It’s nice to get along with your coworkers,” Jess continued when they attempted to catch up with Cas and Sam. “One time, I was assigned to do rounds with this one nurse—
He slid into Baby’s leather interior, breathing in the familiar smell and letting out a deep, slow breath.
Dean swallowed. “I’m gonna go queue up another movie,” he said, trying not to let his eyes flick down to Castiel’s lips. He took a step towards the living room. “Any recommendations?
“Absolutely,” Dean answered, handing his empty mug over. Castiel took it, standing and stretching before shuffling towards the kitchen.
locked before heading down the hallways and stairwells, out the big double doors and to the parking lot.
Dean stuffed his keys into his pocket and knocked twice, softly, on the new guy’s door before stepping inside.
(It wasn’t a whole lot: she couldn’t hold alcohol all too well. Dean liked to tease her constantly about it. He generally went home with a sore shoulder and a bruise afterwards.)
He texted Cas when he got home safe, receiving a kissy face emoji and a picture of Petunia, looking miffed at Dean’s absence.
They maneuvered their way to the sidewalk, weaving between stalls and tents and people going in every direction.
The rest of the morning blew by; Dean heard Cas arrive just at ten, a chorus of “Mr. Novak!” heard across the hall.
Castiel lived on the more rural side of town, a longer—though admittedly more scenic—drive away from Lebanon’s town center than where Dean lived. His place was more of a cottage than a house: it was one floor (although it had an unfinished basement Dean never wanted to go into again; one time was enough), had been built during the 1920’s, and looked like it’d sprung straight from a storybook.The backyard backed up to a small forest, most of the space taken up by a large chicken coop with hens clucking around inside (or, if you were one such chicken named Albert, impersonating Houdini and zooming around the yard).
It felt strange, sitting here, warming his hands around a hot mug of cocoa, shoulder to shoulder with Cas and a cat on his lap. For the first time in a long time, Dean felt….complete. Even without Castiel as his the way he desperately wanted, he wasn’t blindly reaching for something he was missing anymore. He knew what he had, and what he wanted, and he was… okay.
“Generally, yes,” Castiel answered, looking fondly at the thing in his arms. “Nobody else will, so why shouldn’t I?”
He drifted to sleep that night with the cat by his side, warm and comfortable under the sheets and yet cold and yearning for another person’s—Cas’s—warmth to envelop him.
Dean huffed a laugh. “You get used to it.” He pulled Castiel’s cards towards him and stuffed them into the deck.
Deep-cleaning a high school History classroom at ten a.m. on a Monday was not Dean’s ideal way to spend his mornings—mainly because it included fishing dead cricket spiders out of windowsills and clearing cobwebs from dark, spooky corners he
Charlie nodded, chewing. “Yup. I think he’ll stop by today, but he just moved here and you’ll be working together.” She tried to give him a stern look, but it was offset by her cheeks being stuffed like a chipmunk’s. “Be nice.”
over and over again; this could be a start to something, this was a perfect opportunity set in the palm of his hand by the universe itself.
“Well,” Dean said, propping himself into a better position. “I was thinking maybe you’d wanna hang out? Order pizza, drink, watch thrillers? I still can’t believe you haven’t seen
Whenever it rains, he stands outside to watch. He listens to the rolls and rumbles of thunder, letting them wash over him. He loves the steady thrum of it; how the rhythmic sound pulls him under like ocean waves, melting everything else away.
Castiel fell asleep rather easily that night, absolutely drained from the evening. The last thought that drifted across his mind, though, was how nice Dean’s smile was.
Castiel had built the coop from three old rabbit hutches and a bunch of chicken wire, constructing it all into a Franken-coop with ample enough room for the six birds to easily run around.
Castiel’s expression of shock broke into one of amusement and he started laughing. “Sorry,” he said, still smiling, “but that’s rather ridiculous.”
Castiel seized Dean’s face in his hands and kissed him, and Dean melted into it, laughing. Cas’s arms wrapped around his shoulders and Dean pulled Cas in by his hips,kissing him deep.
“You ain’t wrong about that,” Dean sighed, drizzling dish soap in the hot water. “Star coulda been pretty cool.”
he wondered how, in all the universes to exist, he managed to land in this one, with Cas. The light from the television illuminated his profile, the rest in shadow cast by the dimmed living room lights.
Stretched out on the sofa, warmed by the crackling fireplace and the whiskey in his hand, Dean tried to ignore the incompleteness whacking a dent in his chest, because he knew
Dean snorted as they reached the bottom of the stairwell. “Are you still coming to the bar later?” he asked, pushing the door open and letting Cas exit first.
By “slammed with grading,” Dean meant one of the other Earth Science teachers needed someone to finish grading the rest of her students’ papers, courtesy of a family emergency up in Vermont. Cas, being Cas, had immediately offered to finish grading twenty-five extra papers, on top of the ones from
Dean woke to cold, pale sunlight shining through the curtains beside his bed, slanting through the gaps into the room. It took him a second to remember where he was: enveloped in warmth, snuggled under unfamiliar blankets and with strange sun rays on his face. Then he remembered—he was at Castiel’s, because his house’s power had gone
He waited, leg bouncing impatiently, for a few seconds before turning his phone off and rubbing his temples. “It’s fine, he’s fine,” he mumbled, glaring at the five unread parent emails.
“The sequel is incredible, too,” Sam continued, oblivious to Dean’s inattentiveness. “The second book—man, it fucked me up.”
Atta boy,” Dean said, leaning down to grab his neglected lunch. “I’ll pick you up at twelve this Saturday. Be ready or I swear, Cas, I will drag your pretty ass out half-dressed.”
Fortunately, before the tense, awkward silence turned uncomfortable, Cleo decided to knock a pile of dirty measuring cups off the counter with a loud clatter.
Castiel hung his head and closed his eyes, slumping forwards. Tonight was definitely more nerve-racking than usual; being the “new teacher” and all. Mildred was well-known as a good teacher, and Castiel had to step up to the stand she’d set.
“Uh—yes, she’ll be fine. I got all the shed off,” Castiel answered, straightening up in his chair and clearing his throat.
It was relentlessly pouring with no sign of ceasing, so Castiel had retreated to the safety of Arthur Conan Doyle and a mug of tea.
Two hours and three heavy metal albums later, Dean was still scraping squashed fly—or cockroach, or stink bug, who knew—off the wall.
Jo also brought a second bottle of champagne. “You never know when you’re gonna need it,” she said innocently, shoving both in the ice-filled cooler to chill.
Castiel, as it turned out, had more than a few animal companions—two cats, six chickens, and, apparently, a seven-foot snake named
“That play—called the fork—” he waggled his utensil at the TV, a bit of sausage just hanging onto the end, “—can be played by any chess piece, not just the knights. Although knights do the most damage.”
What if he had? What if he’d pressed his lips to Castiel’s, just as he’d dreamed about? Would Castiel jerk back in shock or lean into it, sighing in pleasure, wrapping a warm hand around the back of Dean’s neck and brushing his fingers through—
“What if he does?” Sam looked imploringly across the counter, shaking parmesan on his own plate of pasta.
“I’m good, Cas, I’m just tired,” Dean said, giving him a sleepy, grateful smile. He slung an arm around Cas’s shoulders and pulled him into a loose embrace, hooking his chin over Castiel’s shoulder and feeling him relax into his arms. Dean tilted his head just slightly into Cas’s neck, breathing in the faint smell of woodsmoke on his clothes.
“The pie recipe. Would you rather do the filling or the pastry? And what type—” He looked up and halted in the middle of his sentence.
Castiel smiled at that. “I know the feeling,” he said, closing his notebook and rolling away to stuff it in his bag. “When I taught junior high we’d get celebratory drinks after each grading period.” He straightened up, zipping his bag. “All we have to do is talk to parents and students, right?”
Cas smiled softly. “Claire said she and Kaia were going skiing with Alex and Patience.” His eyes looked a little sad—wistful, maybe—when he said it, slowly swirling his mug and watching the last of the whipped cream melt. “I hope she and Kaia finally realize their feelings aren’t unrequited.”
“Imperators, however,” Castiel continued, “have a lighter tail, make better companions, and have a rather large variation in genetic patterns and colorings.”
“You’ll need my number for that, first,” Castiel said, standing and pulling his bag over his shoulder.
“Just a little,” Castiel answered, standing straight and starting to gather the leftover syllabi scattered across the desks. “Constant human interaction drains me.”
when the ceramic hit the metal sink, and moments later, he felt Castiel’s hand on his shoulder again.
It should not be possible for a grown man to look so lovable. If he could physically melt from loving another person so much, Dean would be a puddle on the floor.
Castiel seemed like he was doing fine, especially for someone jumping into high school classes right after teaching junior high. Dean brought his lunch over to eat with him on the first Monday back (he arrived to lunch ten minutes late, mind you, since he spent the first third of his lunch time explaining
However, Dean’s little nugget of triumph was very quickly squashed when the first thing he saw in Castiel’s deep freezer was Marcy’s supper.
Dean cracked a grin, fiddling with the jacket zipper. “Been doing a little research over the holidays.”
Cas was currently squinting at his computer, completely ignoring the open thermos of steaming soup in front of him. “Do you have Kevin Tran in your US History class?” he asked, reading something on the screen.
“Mff!” Dean repeated more enthusiastically, trying the rice and curry and doing his best to not spill any on the couch.
Dean let out a sigh of relief, glancing down the hallway to see Ellen walking towards him. She waved, and Dean mouthed a relieved
Castiel, unfortunately, was still standing at the bottom of the stairs. Dean saw his eyes go wide and his mouth open before Dean’s body, arms pinwheeling in the air, flattened him into the snow with a heavy
Dean immediately missed the warmth, feeling his body sway slightly into the now-empty space. The feeling in his abdomen guttered out as quickly as it’d come. He blinked a few times, giving his head a little shake and finished washing the mug.
Castiel grins. Sam had gone up to the roof to check on them, and when seeing his brother and best friend rather heavily embraced in one another, had fallen backwards down the stairs. He wasn't hurt by any means, but Dean had nearly broken a rib from laughing so hard.
Luckily, the essays were at most three pages long and shared the same prompt, so Dean knew what to look and grade for. The evening dragged on into mind-numbing repetitiveness, reading and marking and setting assignments aside for the next one. Read, mark, switch. Read, mark, maybe add a note or two, switch. Move one of the cats from the coffee table. Read, mark, switch. Refill water glass. Ten minute break. Stop the other cat from knocking over stack of paper.
Dean roped him into explaining his favorite (and generally inappropriate) historical phenomena and domino effects, leading to a prolonged (and tipsy) debate as to whether donkeys
Dean went over what he wanted to say before letting it out. “You gotta take a step back, man. She ain’t just
Castiel blinked, looking a little astounded, but pleased. “Yes,” he said, hands slowing as he unzipped his coat. “How did you know that?”
first) they’d each drifted to their usual work areas: Cas sprawled on the floor and Dean on the sofa.
The weekend before school went back into session, Dean roped Sam into helping him organize his school stuff. Usually he’d be at Cas’s, but he and Cas hadn’t really been... talking as often. And Castiel was spending time with Claire today, too, so it wasn’t like he’d be free anyways.
Alex just shrugged, hiding a smile and situating her legs under herself a bit better. “That means I get champagne, right?” she asked innocently.
The end of October blew in with blustering winds and an uptick in work, meaning Dean and Castiel were spending close to every weekend together, hunched over papers or melting their eyeballs staring at PowerPoints. But hey, Dean wasn’t complaining. After Autumn Fest, most of their grading sessions were less “strictly business” and more something Dean looked forward to on Sundays.
Castiel slowed a little, just until Dean reached his side. He shrugged. “Not much, really. BCCs—boa constrictor constrictor—have a fully red tail, grow larger, and aren’t as common.”
There's a change in POV in this chapter: we see things from Dean's viewpoint this time, including his memories of what he did in high school.
It had been years since Purgatory though. They had gone through so much. Castiel wouldn’t have made that mistake again now.
The problem is, Dean is not in Samandriel's shoes. Dean is in Dean's shoes. The shoes of a 30 year old man who's recently started to feel not so young anymore, and to second guess his hotness level as a result, who has to sit and watch the admittedly good looking twink waiter of the cafè Cas insists on having breakfast or afternoon tea at
“That’s-, um, good to know,” it’s the only reply Dean is able to verbalize, while his cheeks are basically catching fire and his hands can’t stop fidgeting. He’s also squirming in his seat. He must be at least semi hard. Castiel can understand his predicament all too well.
“I do, love. I very much do.” Still, he pulls them down until Dean’s ass is bare, while his cock is still mostly clothed.
That’s where a substantial part of his trust fund went: buying the building, restoring it, converting it into a receptive structure and having it up and running within a year.
It was his art teacher that helped him leave that dangerous path, without even knowing how deep into youth crime Dean was by then. She just noticed how angry Dean always was, constantly ready to pick a fight or take part in someone else’s fight, as long as he got to throw some punches. How constantly tired and in a bad mood he was, how spectacularly he was failing his classes all of a sudden. Using one of Dean’s disrespectful reactions during one of her classes as an excuse, she forced him to join the music club she supervised in the afternoon for five weeks, rather than giving him detention. Dean had no choice but to agree, because that would let him get home earlier than regular detention would, and he needed to take care of Sammy, cook dinner and make sure he did his homework before bed – even though Sammy was such a nerd that his homework was basically the one thing in their life Dean really didn’t need to worry about. The other positive side, Dean figured, was that not making a fuss and just accepting the punishment would prevent the school from calling his father. That, Dean knew, had to be avoided at all costs. Dean wasn’t sure John would show up sober and if his teachers realized how off the rail his father really was, they’d have no choice but to call CPS and they’d take Sammy away.
They sat down and started chatting over their coffees. When Cas finally got close enough to their table, Dean thought he’d finally have a chance to properly introduce Cas and Charlie. That was also when Charlie reminded him that they had promised Gad and Garth they’d go to their party that night.
There it is. Novak’s bashful smile and dropping gaze after Dean’s smiled and winked at him. Dean would be telling a big, fat lie if he said that kind of attitude on Novak’s part doesn’t make him fantasize about the man looking at Dean like that when Dean’s about to fuck him so hard he won’t be able to sit straight at work the following day.
‘Everything’s quite alright, Dean. I was even more tired than I thought I was and slept until lunchtime. I’ve just finished with showering after eating something. So, how did you like Saint Catherine’s Park?’
So Dean can only pray that Cas was never really into that type of man, or is into a very different type of man now. It would be the joke of the century if the man Dean’s been dreaming of for
Once he’s satisfied with his job, he goes for the oil again, to pour more on his hands before starting on the other foot. He just glances at the glass very quickly and sees there’s still some wine in it. “Finish your wine, love. It’d be a shame if it went to waste.”
"Don't move, I'll be back in a minute," Cas says, with a shy smile beautifully in contrast with what they've just done, only to leave a lingering kiss on Dean's lips and then get up from the sofa.
because Cas is touching him, and he’s called him “baby” and Dean needs to come so bad he’s aching for it and oh god yes, Cas’s lips are touching his again, his tongue is thrusting inside Dean’s mouth again, one of his arms is tightening around his waist, while his other hand is cradling Dean’s head to make sure it doesn’t bang against the arm of the couch where Cas is laying Dean flat on his back, while he stays on top, his mouth never leaving Dean in the process. ‘I was right, the couch will do just fine,’ Dean finds himself thinking, having no pretense this is just foreplay and they will move things to the bedroom. There’s no time for that, worked up as they are. Not with Cas heavy and perfect atop Dean. Not when he gently slides the hand that was supporting his head through Dean’s side, softly touching his shoulder, chest, hipbone, backside, until it stops and grabs ahold of his thigh to make sure it tightens around Cas’s waist and stays there, while Cas’s hips start moving. Oh God, the friction is-
“Alright,” Dean said, scooping liberal amounts of sugar onto his oatmeal.  “What d’you want me to do?”
Castiel glared at him. “Dean, I have so much to do this weekend. I have the coop to clean, Marcy’s vet appointment, homework to grade—”
Castiel frowned at the papers in front of him. “These are the backup lessons for January, just in case we don’t get through everything by winter break. Although last night I was wondering what might happen if we don’t get through everything
The air was heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and cocoa and though it was sweet and somnolent, Dean could feel the weighted, unsaid things dangling between them. They were a constant undercurrent of tension, pulling the strings between them taut, waiting for the snap.
Jo was stuffing her face with pancakes next to Jess, looking about as hung over as Dean felt, a large mug of straight black coffee set in front of her. She grunted a hello when Dean stumbled into the kitchen, barely sparing him a glance.
“Cas, man, what the hell happened?” he asked, sitting down in the chair opposite the desk. “All three alarms break? One-night stand run into overtime?”
The room was pretty much the definition of “organized mess.” There were sorted piles of books, craft supplies, and papers on both the floor and tables (Mildred disliked desks), open file cabinets and drawers, and in the midst of it all like an octopus in a garden (heh, Beatles reference) was the new science teacher, frowning at a binder in his lap.
“Yeah, no kidding,” Dean huffed a laugh, resuming his attention to Petunia’s fluffy ears. “Cold showers in winter ain’t the most comfortable thing in the world.”
Twenty minutes later, Dean stood in the hot spray of Castiel’s shower, defrosting his limbs for the second time in three days. After unceremoniously shoving the rooster back in the coop, they’d stumbled back to the house grumpy, out of breath, and soaked. Not in the fun way, either. Castiel insisted Dean take the first shower, already holding a hand out for his outer layers. Dean would have argued, but the raised-eyebrow look Castiel was giving him nearly made his knees give out right then and there.
Dean scowled at the doorway, absent-mindedly rubbing the scorch marks burned into the surface of his desk.
came back to haunt him again, nudging at his brain and stoking that smoldering bonfire in his heart.
“I most definitely didn’t,” Castiel said, pulling the file cabinet towards him and sliding the folders in.
“Hmm,” Charlie mused, oblivious to the drip of gyro juice sliding down her arm. “She might be working this weekend. I know she’s a yoga instructor at the place in town, maybe—”
Castiel looked up from his desk. He looked only slightly disheveled; his hair was a bit more bed-head and the top button of his shirt was undone, but other than that he looked normal.
“Yes, please, that would be wonderful,” Castiel said, handing Dean a roll of tape and a massive poster of the periodic table.
With the low-lit haziness of the Roadhouse, along with the friendly warmth from his fellow coworkers and the alcohol settling in his system, Castiel felt the last of his nerves dissipating, replaced by a content, welcome sense in his abdomen.
classes. Dean had nearly inhaled his coffee up his nose when Castiel described the amount of work he had to get done on Halloween night, since his weekend was taken up by prior commitments. He’d waved aside Cas’s apology for ruining their pre-work-emergency Halloween plans and the explanation of “Our classes were doing the same project, Dean, it would make sense for me to lend a hand.”
Most of Dean’s friends were similar to him: rough-housey, tough love, compliment-you-in-an-insulting-manner. And he loved them, he really, really did.
Dean glanced out to make sure she was out of earshot before looking at Castiel again. “What on Earth?”
He was skimming over something about picture day when he heard the faint sounds of footsteps and moving boxes from across the hall.
He switched the laundry load around five, finished the last of the review guide questions half an hour later, and started dinner around six.
Dean felt his cheeks pink more than they already were. “I—shit, maybe I did,” he groaned, letting his head fall on Castiel’s shoulder. His shirt was soft under Dean’s cheek, and Dean felt the vibrations of his laugh melt into his body. “Sorry.”
Dean chuckled, feeling the nervous edge he’d gotten slowly ebb away. They lapsed into silence again, watching Michael’s unfortunate initiation.
“If it’s my niece’s, the answer is most likely a ‘sometimes,’” Castiel said, walking back from his kitchen to rejoin Dean on the couch. He was looking over some of Dean’s new PowerPoints and worksheets for the next Civics unit, most of which had been written up at two in the morning and needed heavy revision. Usually, he’d reuse the ones from previous years, but the curriculum had added a new part to the unit. It was an excellent addition to the curriculum, but it also meant Dean had to rearrange some of the planning in order to incorporate the new stuff.
Jokes, riddles, weird facts and the like had already become something of a staple between the two of them within the few days they’d known each other. Dean had asked what the small box of notecards on Castiel’s desk was, and thus started the tradition.
“You are incorrigible, Dean Winchester,” Castiel stated firmly, but his eyes were alight with laughter.
Castiel sat up a bit straighter, as he always did when he was about to explain some weird factoid. “Mirrors used to be made with silver backs, but producers switched to aluminum in the late 1850s. According to most sources, silver burns vampires—or at least weakens them.” He paused to take a sip of his beer, twirling the bottle in his fingers. “According to Bram Stoker’s
“Nope.” Dean flipped the cover and squinted at the Sharpie numeral in the corner. “If Jones don’t fuck with them, I don’t fuck with ‘em.”
Was it because of Dean? Had his drunken New Year’s texts wedged even more of a wall between them that he’d originally thought?
“Yeah—uh—yeah, that makes sense,” Dean said, nodding, still standing by the door. Even with all the times he’d been to Castiel’s house, he’d never been too far in the snake room, much less physically near Marcy. Dean had never asked and Castiel had never offered, happy to explain the little things about boa constrictor husbandry from the living room. The temperature and humidity regulators were on the wall by the light switch, so when he’d played pet-sitter for Cas over winter break, all Dean had to do was poke his head around the door to read the numbers.
He couldn’t blame her, especially when Cas rose up onto his knees to get the stuff in the back of the tank.
Dean entered the last grade, yawning and snapping his laptop shut. It was snowing again—not heavy like the past days, just small, white flecks like fluffy, fallen stars swirling and twirling past the windows, bright against the darkening sky.
Most people looked more peaceful in their sleep, and Cas was one of those people. He was uptight during workdays, tensed up like a rabbit on alert. Now, though, the frown lines between his eyebrows smoothed to soft skin, his back and shoulders relaxed to soft, sloping curves instead of the sharpness he carried at school. His cheek squished into the pillow, lips parted with gentle exhales, locks of unruly hair curling across his forehead.
“Most likely,” Castiel said, joining Dean in the kitchen. “Older movies weren’t very good at creating well-rounded female characters. Women were generally reduced to one-dimensional love interests.”

Dean pressed a kiss between Cas’s pecs. “Well yeah, a little,” he mumbled. “I like bein’ around you.”
textbooks from the media center to Dean’s classroom and methodically rearranging them on the bookshelf when the topic of pets had come up.
Deep cleaning the entire room (a definitive need: the amount of deceased insects stuck in the windowsill was always
They sat there together, slowly sipping at their drinks and savoring their shared comfort. Small bits of conversation floated between them, easy and soft as they’d ever been. The fire crackled and popped, occasionally spooking one of the cats.
“No—no. Do not start that date bullshit again.” Dean pointed his fork at his brother. “It’s not a date. Besides, I don’t like him that way.”
“Charlie,” Dean interrupted glumly, flopping back on the couch cushions with the pie dish and waiting for his friend to figure it out.
Dean thought, internally sighing while sprinting after Albert, currently zooming around the lawn like a tiny, feathered balloon that had been filled with air and accidentally let loose.
Dean swallowed a bite of eggs, the familiar bubble of apprehension rising in his chest again. “Uh, no, why?”
streaming through his head, he’d have run off the road. His hands defrosted slowly at the wheel when the heat finally kicked into gear, soaking through his gloves and into his bones.
Dean’s eyes matched the rain-drenched leaves; vibrant and green. Rainwater dripped from his brow into his lashes, his hair tangled from running his fingers through it.
They spent the rest of the day lounging on the couch, finishing up the last of that week’s online work or feasting on leftovers and hot cider and pie, Dean with his head in Cas’s lap and Cas running his fingers through Dean’s hair. Albert was much more subdued that morning when they made the trip to the coop, completely avoiding Dean and glaring at him from afar.
Dean saw at work. Dean’s ribcage hurt from laughing, his work all but forgotten on his lap as he watched Castiel chuckling on the floor.
“My uncle,” Dean answered, grabbing his phone from the desk and slipping it into his pocket. “Well—good family friend, anyways. There anything else you need before I head out?”
Castiel smiled, keyboard clacking away. He was wearing reading glasses, the lenses fogging up from thin poofs of steam curling from the bowl in his lap. He frowned in concentration, the creases in his brow outlined in the laptop’s blue light.
the power was supposed to be back the next day; he wasn’t asking out of curiosity. His words sounded strained, forced, like he dreaded the answer.
Dean sent Jo a not-very-nice emoji in response to her victory before swiping over to Charlie’s text.
If you think you wanna hang around, I've got some stuff in the works, including a Human Cas in the Bunker fic that I'm excited to finally buckle down on!
He set his bag down beside his desk and fired up his computer—no missed emails about faculty meetings—and set to putting today’s warm-up on the board.
Dean sat up fully and scooched forwards, leaning towards him. “I think it’s pretty cool, Cas,” he said earnestly. “What else did Bram Stoker fuck up?”
A shadow rippled across the glass a moment before Cas opened the door. And the moment Dean saw him every muscle in his body tensed and relaxed at the same time.
When he and Dean moved out of the Bunker, one of Castiel’s only requests was a porch.  Dean built him a porch swing and three cushioned chairs facing the woods surrounding their backyard. It’s beautiful and domestic and nothing like Dean ever imagined.
“Charlie,” Dean began, exasperated, “School starts next Monday. I’d love to get hammered with you on whatever Medieval tavern shit they’re serving, but—”
“Come on, I know you want to go to the next one!” Charlie wheedled, drizzling more tzatziki over her gyro. “That bartender was cute and
quite an important bit, though, but if you'd like to skim it, I'll leave a summary in the End notes!
Dean stared at him for a moment, flabbergasted, before the metaphor clicked. He burst into laughter.  “Oh you
This chapter features another lovely artwork by jununy! this also happens to be one of my favorite chapters, too, by the way!
He completely forgot they had been chasing a rogue rooster, that his fingers were numb and his jeans were getting soaked through with melting snow.
Castiel’s senses nearly went into overdrive when he stepped through the door, blinking to adjust his eyes to the low light and sudden rush of sound. Closing the door—the creak lost to the swell of sound within—Castiel stayed by the wall, aiming for a window and scanning the heads rather desperately for a familiar face.
Mary shrugged. “Maybe. Still tastes damn good, though. Oh, you might want to check your phone, too,” she added casually. “A certain someone’s been texting you a good few times.”
“My brother and his family live here,” Castiel replied. “Their daughter—my niece, Claire—is a senior this year. It was another benefit of the job offer, as well.”
Dean was coughing, wiping his face after choking on his drink. “Yeah,” he gasped. Charlie, grinning, tossed a napkin at him, and Jo thumped him heavily between the shoulder blades. “I’m—ow, Jo—good. Peachy.” He wheezed, dabbing at the spilled beer on his shirt. “They
). The desks needed to be separated and organized from their wobbly stacking against the back wall; there were posters to be taped onto the walls and computers to be set up….
Dean scooched forward to where he could kiss Cas more easily. “Uh-huh,” he mumbled into the kiss, cupping Cas’s cheek in one hand and grinning happily. “Together. Fuckin’ finally.”
Cas POV Summary: He and Dean leave Back To School night and meet the rest of the faculty at the Roadhouse, and everyone has a lovely time! When they leave, Dean asks Cas to text him when he's home, and when Castiel finally is, they strike up a text convo about the cats (named Petunia and Cleocatra.)
gonna ask if you’d want to go to Charlie’s annual Halloween party with me, but her girlfriend’s parents are in town, so it got cancelled. It woulda been a blast; someone always gets their ass kicked at Mario Kart, Jo brings
He plugged the laptop into the ancient monitor, holding his breath and sending up a silent prayer until the old screen hummed to life. He leaned back in his chair and logged into his school email, and immediately regretted it as the numbers in the Inbox started zooming upwards.
He closed the Gmail browser just as the clock ticked past two p.m., letting out a long sigh of relief and slumping down in his chair. Emails were
Welp, that's it, everyone! I hope you enjoyed this short story--I had a lotta fun writing it. If you wanna, drop a kudos or a comment and I'll send the bestest of vibes your way.
Castiel smiled softly. “You slept quite heavily. I’m surprised, actually—Cleo is incredibly demanding when she wants breakfast.” He scratched the cat behind her ears, giving her a stern look. “I thought she would have awoken you.”
Dean snorted. “How about you come to FallFest this weekend. With me. And Sam and Jess, obviously,” he added hurriedly.
Dean thought for some stupid reason, the picture of Castiel with a towel wrapped around his hips flashing across his mind. He cleared his throat and shoveled more bacon into his mouth. “How’d you sleep?” he mumbled.
He woke slowly and drowsily, sunlight drifting through the window despite a faint chill in the air. Cas’s chest pressed against his back, his bare skin soft and sleep-warm. Dean traced a vein on the back of one of Cas’s hands, snuggling back farther into Castiel’s embrace.
anything was different, until Jo cornered him as he was leaving and stated, “So you finally got your New Year’s kiss, huh?”
He swallowed, lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper. “Completely fuckin’ gone. Can you believe that?” He huffed a laugh, feeling the anchor-like weight in his stomach sinking lower and lower, dragging his heart down with it.
Castiel ducked his head to hide his smile. Dean was laughing beside him, face still red from moments earlier, one arm slung around the back of Castiel’s booth seat. Benny and Garth were both chuckling, Donna attempting to convince Jody and Jo that seventh graders really
There was an outraged screech from Albert as Castiel snatched him off Dean’s back with both hands, holding him overhead like a prize trophy.
Castiel’s lips were warm and soft and slightly chapped. His hair was soft at the nape of his neck where Dean threaded his fingers through it, the scrape of stubble scratching against his chin. He tasted like chocolate and cinnamon, sweet and comforting and a tiny bit spicy.
Castiel rolled his eyes, but the corners of his mouth were twitching upwards. “I enjoy baking. And I wanted to bake with you,” he said softly, ducking his head and stabbing off a forkful of pie.
Dean shrugged, pushing sauce around his plate. “S’not like he sent back a whole-ass love confession or somethin’.” He looked up, frowning at Sam. “Wait, why do you sound so damn sure he’s into me?”
He put as much effort into his teaching as he did with the environment he taught in: As someone who’d never gotten a solid, steady schooling, he did his best to form the curriculum and such to be as flexible and workable to everyone, trying to cater to most, if not all, of his student’s needs. He’d get funny stickers (the students actually did better on assessments when they got funny stickers) to stick on the corners of written assignments. He uploaded photos of the textbook onto the class page just in case one of his students needed a digital copy of them. He kept blankets folded neatly in baskets by the bean bags in the corner of the room (not the spider one, the other back corner!). His assignments were given on Monday and due Sunday night (but not considered
Dean glanced  at the clock, slightly surprised to see the hands pointing past twelve-thirty. He turned back to Charlie, eyebrows raised. “Do you?”
Castiel hesitated. “I’m just sorting files right now. You’re more than welcome to help, if you’d like, but please don’t feel obligated to.”
Second and third period seemed to go by even slower; Dean’s leg wouldn’t stop jiggling beneath his desk and he kept glancing at the clock every five minutes, like it’d make time move faster.
He pulled into the short gravel driveway of Cas’s cottage at twelve o’clock on Saturday, watching carefully for any stray chickens on the front lawn and ignoring the increasing thrum of nerves in his chest.
His entire body was tensed, immediately freezing at the weight of the snake on his thighs. Castiel pulled the rest of Marcy’s body—including her head, which was roughly the size of Dean’s
“This one,” Castiel said a little breathlessly when he made it back to Dean, gently cradling the pumpkin to his chest with both arms. “I’m getting this one.”
Castiel might’ve flushed, but his face was already tomato-red. He wiped his eyes, still clearing his throat now and again. “You’re an asshole, Dean Winchester.”
Dean refrained from fist-pumping the air, reducing it to a tiny, gleeful grin. “Deal. You want any help with dinner?”
The last of the PowerPoints didn’t take as long as he’d expected, so around four o’clock Dean tackled his inbox. Unsurprisingly, it was cluttered with emails. Staff meeting notices and winter sports reminders, Donna’s weekly lunch options for next Wednesday, and parents asking why their student didn’t have a perfect grade (every time Dean got one of
Charlie stared at him, confused, for a few seconds. Then Dean saw her eyes go wide and she gasped. “Oh my—Dean, you caught
“Told you,” Dean said, twirling more noodles. “He’s overworking himself. I honestly don’t think he even
Castiel swallowed and nodded. Some of the snow caught in his hair fell onto his forehead. Dean automatically brushed it aside without a second thought, and the stutter in Castiel’s breathing vibrated through the thick layers between them.
Dean Novak-Winchester leaned against his desk, surveying his classroom, smiling to himself and rubbing the metal band around his ring finger.
“If you’re wondering why I never asked to talk about it the next morning,” Castiel said from beside him, words muffled by the sound of Dean’s heartbeat in his ears. “It’s because I didn’t know how to ask whether it was real or not. I didn’t want to let myself down if it wasn’t.”
