When John exits his room Sherlock is still in the clothes he wore to sleep, yet there is a plate of warm  toast next to John’s travel mug that is full when he checks it. He doesn’t bother to ask how the other man knows how he takes his tea and toast.  Sherlock is laying on the couch with his hands clasped under his chin, like the last time he found Sherlock on his couch.
“Well right I did. Mom and Dad took us to see children’s movies and we watched them on television like normal children.”
“Let’s go.” Sherlock growls, slapping down money and grabbing John’s arm and pulling him towards the exit.
“You’re fake sleeping I can tell Sherlock. That’s not very nice.” John scolds standing inches from his head.
Radio silence would have to be the plan. Phone off, computer abandoned, novels would be good. And that is how he spent his time for the next four days, reading novels, eating bad food, leaving the bedsit only when desperate for fresh air. The bleak quiet soothed him, he slept a lot, watched a lot of bad daytime television and absolutely did not think about Sherlock Holmes.
“He’s obviously having some degree of disorientation and memory loss. What he says can only be taken as gibberish” John mutters noting the incident in the chart, “can you explain what led up to this?”
His sexual crisis was interrupted by a firm knock on the door.  Jumping up with annoyance knowing who was at the door.
The two men walk shoulder to shoulder with John looking at Sherlock like he has hung the stars, and the other looking at John like he was the sun.
Mary who was kind, safe, joking, and subtly convinced him to forgive Sherlock. Getting kidnapped and shoved into a Fawkes bonfire and being rescued by the unrequited love of your life does a lot in the way of forgiveness.
“So did you bring many women here do you think? or men? which is fine by the way.” John awkwardly asks instead. He knows that this isn’t a date, but it is close to one as John could hope for.
“I have all the indicators, the manipulation to get my way, drug use, relationship issues. I’ve done my research.” Sherlock grumbles.
Mycroft gave one last disparaging look to Dr. John Watson. He knew that the doctor was a good man, who sacrificed his body and safety in Afghanistan, who had an excellent service record, and was a well liked physician. His concerns regarding his brother were based in the events that Sherlock had erased those nineteen years ago. John’s kindness and connection to his brother would only hurt his brother in the long run, when Sherlock remembered who he truly was and how the drug use had started.  Mycroft wouldn’t really end the poor man’s career, he knew his threat would be enough.  His brother would be angry with his interference, but Sherlock would just have to endure disappointment.  Taking a deep breath Mycroft entered his brother’s room.
“He’s the best in his field Sherlock! Yeah I got your note, it would be completely inappropriate on so many levels if I were to give you my number. I can’t  treat you Sherlock, I have other patients and you have been reassigned and should be released in what a day or so? I have to get back to patients that actually need me!” John says brusquely gathering his tablet and paper work and turning away from his former patient.
“No, I’ll probably confess my undying affection for the man and decide we’ll name our first son Gregory. SO NOPE” I he huffs raising his head briefly for his annoyed tirade.
I calmly fold my paper and put it down. I stare at him annoyed that he would of course bring up this discussion when I am hungover.
“We decided we wanted to try this on our own. Something feels wrong about the British Government helping to secure us a child. A bit underhanded, illegal, and the words ‘child trafficking’ come to mind” I say.
“If it gets me home and into my own bed, yes. I am absolutely exhausted and just done with this day.  Sherlock the number of times I’ve had to drag my sister home to mine and have her sick with alcohol on my couch, you will be a thousand times more welcome. Just check if you have anything to bring to sleep in and lets get out of here. I have extra toothbrushes.” John blurts exasperatedly. Sherlock spins into his room and comes out with a pile of clothes.
“First of all, it’s Liz. Second of all, it was their decision to enter my home. Just make sure to listen to my advice, okay?” She smiled. Lestrade got up and nodded.
“I was down here a few minutes ago and you didn’t object, so I don’t see the problem.” Elizabeth shouted back at her and popped her head round the door of Lestrade’s office. “Are you coming or do I have to find my own way there?” She asked. Anderson’s mouth drops open.
She thought, showing her own ID and going over to where Elizabeth and a few other officers were standing.
“I’m sorry what?” Keira asked, still confused over the fact she now had a flat mate. The woman rolled her eyes.
“I knew he was lying. I had hacked into his growing network long before then and I knew he didn’t hire any snipers, couldn’t afford to, so I told him he was lying and I wasn’t going anywhere.” She moved her and smiled sadly at the ceiling. “So he shot me off the building.” There was an awkward silence for a few moments before Elizabeth chuckled. “I fell through the roof of an old warehouse which probably saved me from dying but I was bleeding out in the middle of an abandoned warehouse, thinking no one was around, I thought I was dead.” She glanced over at John. “But luck, in a way, was with me. A couple of Irish mobsters came into the building, carrying a body. They saw me and walked over. They recognised me, by this point I believe the whole of New York knew who I was, and decided to take me back to their base, to the doctor who happened to be a disgraced surgeon. They carried me to their truck and then left the body they carried there but before we left they burnt the building.” Elizabeth frowned. “That’s all I can remember from there, next thing I know I’m in one of the guest rooms at the Irish mafia’s home base.” Elizabeth looked at John and chuckled lightly at his expression.
“Look I don’t care, I’m here for work not to talk to you. So piss off and let me do my work.” She then grabbed the coolers and put them into the back of the police car and went to go sit next to them when Mycroft spoke up again.
“You’re welcome.” Is all she says before giving the computer 100% of her attention. She and John sit there in silence before John sighs.
Elizabeth was in a relatively good mood as she strode out of the University building, cooler boxes in hand. Lestrade and John trailed after her slowly. They made it to Lestrade’s police car when they saw a black car parked behind it. Elizabeth frowned.
“Well first of all, I have some people I want you to finally meet.” Elizabeth said, bounding up the steps of the other plane.
“Seriously, are we going now, in 2 days, a week? I’m being nice here.” She said. Lestrade cleared his throat and nodded. Just as he was getting up to follow Elizabeth, the commissioner of Scotland Yard stood in the doorway.
“Damn it!” Elizabeth muttered to herself and continued to type even quicker. Eventually the sounds and flashes stopped and Elizabeth was reading screens of code. A smile began to grow on her face as she read through it all. “Oh… oh yes… Thank you Sebastian… You just screwed up big time didn’t you…” She continued to mutter and type on her keyboard.
“Yes she is related to Sherlock, but considering her position and the fact the Chief seems to trust her, we have no other choice. The amount of pressure we are getting from these murders from the public is getting bigger and bigger so any break we can get, we are going to take it.” Donovan sighed but nodded her head. With that the three of them walked out of the Yard and met Elizabeth standing by one of the police cars, smirking at her phone. “Dr Holmes.” Lestrade called out to her. She looked up and put her phone in her pocket.
“Children and families are cute Sherlock. Sorry to be so pedestrian about that” I say with a scowl. I tried avoiding his gaze to hide my embarrassment.
“Oh well nausea can last almost the whole pregnancy.  I have just got to remember to snack constantly.” Charlotte absently rubbing her stomach.
“You would have reached the same conclusion with a bit more time, I am sure.” John says grabbing gathering the remnants of his meal in a pile for disposal.
“I chose you.  If you were a woman I’d still chose you and that great brain of yours and the crazy life we have together. Sure it would be easier if one of us could have children but you know we’ll get through this” I say kissing him on the top of his head.
“So, I can’t tolerate being at Mycroft’s anymore. He won’t let me experiment like I want to and if I walk in on him and Gregory
“Answer me! Why am I not going home to my own home!” Sherlock shouts. Mycroft Holmes takes that moment to enter the room.
I watch Sherlock jump up and begins banging around the kitchen grabbing eggs and bread and vegetables. The man barely eats, much less cooks anything so this is a definitely a special occasion.
“John, it’s not the first time she’s had to scrub mysterious substances out of the carpet.  I’ll find some rooms for us. Eat John.” Sherlock commands.
“They take it one day at a time. They worry, they breathe, and they hope” I laugh and he finally lets go and laughs with me. I watch him re read the card and gulp air like a fish.
“Hello?” Sherlock says stopping what he was doing and looking curiously at Lestrade. He sees that he’s trying to stop smoking, that he doesn’t sleep well, that eats way too many donuts for his own good, and that he is kind and trustworthy.
“That is helpful to know. Any allergies or underlying conditions I need to know about him? Your brother most likely has a hematoma and any medication will cause complications.”
“You warned and warned me not to get attached, that she had every right to change her mind,  but I did.  Look at what it made me do” he says throwing the thin box at my chest and stomping out of the room and out the door before I could stop him.
“And only a fool argues with his doctor. Goodnight, I will be in early tomorrow.” Sherlock turns abruptly and flings the orange blanket in Gregory’s general direction.
They finish their meal in a comfortable silence and John puts together few boxes. Sherlock begins with the overflowing book shelves and begins a pile of the books and papers to pack. The two work for several hours until John groans and checks the time. He looks at Sherlock  as he is plucking items off the wall and putting them in a large envelope.
“That, that’s a real human skull” John stutters walking up and lifting the skull delicately. He notes there are no markings of being an artifact or a specimen. John shuddered at where it might have come from.
Another drink will do...I grab the bottle and pour some more.  Then I hear it..a key in the door..familiar footfalls on the stairs...John… it was late...1 am…
“I came to see you about my brother.” Mycroft says entering the office and settling himself in the chair across from John.
Sherlock’s visit had shaken him to the core. Sherlock Holmes was having issues that he didn’t want to share with his therapist or doctor.  Sherlock was depressed and lonely and John only pushed him away. John hated himself and Mycroft Holmes even more. John didn’t want to hurt Sherlock anymore. John found himself at his favorite pub tucked into a corner. He wanted to forget his feelings for Sherlock, distance himself after the breakdown today at the hospital. He tried to forget the softness of Sherlock’s growing in hair at the back of his neck, or how thin he still was, forget the all encompassing feeling of regret he felt after Sherlock said he would never forget him.  He’d have to try and disappear, find a new place to live, a new job, anything because trying to keep himself away from Sherlock or trying to stop thinking about him was not working out at all. He would definitely have to break it off with Sarah at the very least, as soon as he was significantly under the influence. She was noticing the distance and she deserved better than what John was giving to her.  He tried to distract himself with some match on the television when a familiar face caught his eye.
“Goodnight Sherock. Thank you,” he paused and blinked backs the tears that suddenly formed in his eyes, the stress had become too much for him,  “for everything.”
“John between the work and your office hours we can more than afford the mortgage payments” Sherlock sighs.
“John. I think it is time you return to the woman that you love. If we continue this conversation you will only be upset and storm off anyway. It would be better for you and I if you left now and forget last night” I mumble with a sip of tea.
“Come here, “ I command pulling him back down against me, “you make me happy. You can be a colossal ass but I wouldn’t have you any other way. If it is only just the two of us for the rest of time, I would be happy cause we’d be together. This won’t make or break us Sherlock. It’s just bonus material yeah?”
“Oh that. There isn’t anything in the chart indicating why, it look like it was decided sometime yesterday afternoon. After your EEG was removed.”  Gloria mumbles thumbing through the computer.
John waited for Sherlock to continue,  reaching for a tissue from the box on the end table. He hands it towards Sherlock carefully. Sherlock doesn’t take it and violently wipes at his face.
“Well, you do surprise me on occasion,” Sherlock smirks and pulls out a key and opens the door quietly, “shall we?”
Sherlock is silent for the moment, his jaw clenches and his brow is furrowed. Mycroft watched as a familiar processing look crossed over Sherlock’s face.  Mycroft was completely torn between wanting his brother to remember who he was and not wanting him to remember the incident that had restructured his younger sibling completely.
Over several days Sherlock recovers. He sleeps a lot he freaks out every time someone brings a new piece of technology into the room.  When his brother visits he always has to be given something to sleep later.
“John the kettle is ready” Sherlock rumbles from my side. I shake my head and look at the pink cheeked man before me. He’s biting his lip and shifting from side to side in an effort to control the chaos that I know is swirling in his head because it is swirling in mine. I reach for the back of his neck and pull him down for a kiss, a grounding one, one that I know will settle us both for the moment.
“What is this?” I laugh fishing the item that Sherlock had hidden in the seat cushion and find it to be a parenting magazine.
“You know who I’m talking about….Lestrade…..are we interviewing a suspect?” I ask completely at a loss as to why we were here. It was so different filled with medical students and their large bags and animated conversations. Sherlock had been absent minded the whole morning and was rarely this unclear about what we were doing with the day and I was reaching my end.
“I’m not I’m really not am I John? I have all this information in my head, yet I have no real idea of who I am. I don’t know what half of this equipment does in here, and most of those books were published in the last 5 years, John I don’t know who I am anymore and I just. Why can’t I remember who I am?” Sherlock says raising his head to look at John.
“Please John if you say I look cuddly in this I will go back and change. I’m trying really hard here and you teasing me about it isn’t helping. I want her to like me.” Sherlock shakes his head and puts up his hands up barring me from getting any closer.
“John Watson has proven himself to be someone that I approve that you associate with. He would make a fine roommate, definitely doesn’t share your, clutter.” Mycroft says taking another sweep around John’s spotless kitchen.
As you can see it is a lot of out of character John & Sherlock and a lot of just dialog. Again..I'm all a bit meh and very insecure about this fic. I do so much better with short angsty drabbles but parentlock just burrowed into my brain.
“You need a better lock considering you have an illegal firearm in your night stand.” Sherlock smiles at him.
“I need a phone, and at very least my own clothes, a room that locks, and maybe a room for experiments” Sherlock concedes folding his arms stubbornly.
“Sherlock, please wait. How are you feeling right now?” John says holding a palm up to protest Sherlock’s leaving.
“Chinese? it is open til 2, probably won’t be getting back inside til tomorrow.” Sherl cas as he and John make their way down the street.
“Gregory. John and Sherlock are getting a dog. Prepare yourself for an additional member of your force.” Mycroft grins over the shouting response.
“Well since we don’t know if he belongs to someone we still have to send him. If noone claims him in a couple of weeks there will be home visits, paperwork and stuff. I can tell them you are interested, put you first in line?”
“Exactly what the hell did you think you were doing?!” John shouts taking his coat off and putting it around a shivering Sherlock.  He frantically starts unbuttoning Sherlock’s dripping shirt and grumbling.
I can’t stifle the giggle that escapes my mouth at the obvious distaste Sherlock finds in the traditions of marriage. The hurt though I see in his eyes stops me immediately. I join him on the floor and cup his face
“But..but..the down payment...we have very little saved...and we need the money for the adoption … Sherlock this won’t work!” I flail looking around at the fabulous place we were standing in. It was light and airy and had a basement for Sherlock’s experiments. It was perfect and I could see us running around after children in the garden and up and down the stairs.
“So you have a boyfriend. How did you find the time?  The last I remember you were off to rule England.” Sherlock huffs changing the subject.
“I don’t know who you are or why you are bringing me tea.” Sherlock says warily. John snorts in amusement.
“They’ll know, they’ll know” I pull Sherlock off the concrete and hug him close. The man is still shaking a bit, “Do you want anything, water, tea, coffee?”
“Yes because we weren’t on a date.” John says exasperated. With a pause that could have enclosed an entire conversation if it was judge by the shift in Sherlock’s shoulders.
So I've made the decision to create and continue this work as a series.  John and Sherlock confessing their feelings and ending on an intimate note feels like a good place for a break.
“You know it annoys me when you call Mycroft or try to be clever.” Sherlock’s voice is hard edged as he stares down at his hands.
“Uh well. That is to say, this was so much easier a year ago when we did it together” Greg says rubbing his eyes.
“Are you here to threaten me again? Cause frankly, it isn’t going to work.” John declares not missing the small flinch on Mycroft’s face.
“Gregory..your home is quite nice” Sherlock exhales rushing forward into the sitting room. I see two young ladies sitting there. One has the distinct set of her jaw and eyes of her father, the other pale and auburn haired.
“I think not, I’ll bring one up.” She says shakily. John looks at the frozen forms of Gregory and Mycroft and is only mildly soften by Mycroft’s watery eyes.
“No, no, it is very good. You did say you heard me, I just didn’t think you’d remember what I said” I say pulling him close.
I stumble into the bathroom for some paracetamol and basic hygiene and then out to the sitting room for tea. Oh..John...what? Oh god. The memory of last night came slamming back to me. I freeze in the kitchen hand on the kettle and watch him asleep on the sofa. He stayed, the night, on Valentine’s Day. Something was epically wrong, something I couldn’t deduce. I turn on the tap to fill the kettle. I tried to reconcile how to handle this morning. I stared at the blue light, wishing I wasn’t so weak, wasn’t so drunk, should have gone on the case.
“There is an event that happened on the night Sherlock recalls as his last memory. Something that I could not prevent and it changed my brother’s whole outlook on trust and people. If you want to know more you should read this file and save yourself the trouble of getting involved with my brother.” Mycroft juts his chin and scowls at the smug doctor.
“Morning sickness? You’re still only about 14 weeks along correct. Shouldn’t you be feeling better?” Sherlock blurts
“Apparently I cleared it just a bit.  He was accused of murder when he was actually robbing a house across town. He’s been helpful filling in some gaps, in cases I had solved before and other social aspects of my life.” Sherlock says waving him away. John again can only marvel at what Sherlock had accomplished.  So much the brain could not remember, so many things Sherlock had done.
The two men eat ravenously in a contented silence. Sly glances and smiles of contentment shared.  As their plates began to clear, the waitress drops off a small plate of fortune cookies and the bill.
The rest of the evening passes with a parade of nurses checking vitals, and Sherlock’s mental state. Sherlock is annoyed by it, almost driving one of them to tears. He was only stopped by Gloria pulling the other nurse out of the room. Sherlock dares to google himself and finds his website. Sherlock is mildy disgusted by his writing about 243 types of tobacco ash, he had becomes so absolutely boring. He attempted for hours to determine the password to the blog but to no avail, falling asleep hands up on the keyboard.  He misses the nurse closing the laptop, pulling up the blanket, and wiping off the whiteboard in his room detailing his caretakers. Watson is replaced with Evans in her inelegant script.
This outburst has made me nervous about what it might provoke out of Sherlock. He doesn’t always take well to confrontations.
“It is down to a dull ache, and itchy stitches.  So, please tell me how I know you. I’ve managed to delete almost everything over the last 19 years and since you are my first visitor other than my brother since I’ve been admitted, I’m going to guess that you are a friend. Please, I beg of you, tell me about my life.”
“Sherlock, it’s so good to see you, how are you feeling?” a mousy haired tiny thing of a woman in a labcoat shuffles in, “This is for you!”
“Right. So I think I’ve done it. All ready for our arrival” I exclaim removing Sherlock’s hands from my middle and tapping the rail of the crib.
“Very agreeable Sherlock. Big decision,  children, you sure?” I ask still wobbly in voice as I rub my knuckles on Sherlock’s cheek.
“John I love you very much. I hope you know that because...I don’t always tell you that...you’ll remind me to tell them right?” he asks looking up under his wild curls.
“Promise you won’t cast me aside the moment you begin remembering your life.” John pleads with his eyes closed. He is aware how needy he sounds, but after holding back for so long he can’t help but feel vulnerable.
Sherlock sits up straight on the bed and interrupts with, “Your  job is all that is keeping you happy and”
“And we will not until I feel it is appropriate to do so, not in the middle of the street Sherlock!” I shout in frustration.
John checks on him periodically to see how he is doing and always stays for brief conversations that cover advances in the medical field, any interesting patients, and the general day to day workings of a hospital doctor. John always looks forward to checking up on Sherlock Holmes, the man is smart, funny, and just his male type:  tall, dark haired, and with light eyes. He may be dating Sarah at the moment but she is keeping him at an arms length as far as the physical part of their relationship goes and they weren’t anything serious.
He thought about what his life at Baker Street would be like. He’d never be bored, he’d be able to save money on transportation since his leg didn’t appear to be bothering him as much anymore, he could walk to work if motivated.
John flings his stethoscope over his neck and charges towards the er as his new patient is wheeled in. He’s deathly pale in his dark coat and suit. He doesn’t look like a drug user, but his thin frame and dark circles under his eyes tell otherwise.
“Get him up on the bed properly, restrain his arms.” John swiftly takes vitals and check’s Sherlock’s head. He doesn’t appear to have re injured himself, he restarts the IV.
I quietly work and manage to get the crib into some semblance of a bed shape when the lullaby is about to begin.
“You don’t have to say it back. Of course, I know that you love me, you show me when you bring me my perfectly made tea without me asking, when you remind me to go to my therapy sessions, when you save the raspberry filled cookies because you know that they’re my favorite.
So I've made the decision to create and continue this work as a series.  John and Sherlock confessing their feelings and ending on an intimate note feels like a good place for a break.
“I’m tired of you telling me to stay away from him.  I’ll find a new job or reenlist if you feel the need to end my employment here.  Your brother, the most brilliant man I’ve ever known, he needs me and maybe I need him.” John says giving his homicidal smile. He scowled at Mycroft, waiting for the dismissal.
“John I may be dealing with loss of memory but I do have to ignore some things in order to function.  Since the first day that we met I’ve had to ignore my intense desire of you. I’ve had to ignore the way that you look at me.  I’ve had to ignore your unnecessary sense of chivalry manifested in you inaction of your desire to have me romantically.  It is tiresome and tedious and this game with the fortune cookies as a clumsy attempt at seduction is exhausting.  You are not taking advantage of me.  Don’t you think we’ve been polite enough?” Sherlock rests his hand on John’s wrist squeezing it lightly.
“Is that how we are talking to our patients these days Doctor Watson?” Doctor Evans asks appearing at the door silently.
“Oh wow you look…” I say forgetting the paper I was thumbing through as I waited for Sherlock to change. I had dressed as normal and waited nervously for Sherlock as he banged around the bedroom.
John looks at Sherlock’s brother, his smug expression, his aura of control and dominance that he has found irritating. He decides that he has more than enough from Mycroft Holmes.
“I knew it was a mistake allowing you even breathe the same air as Sherlock. Doctor I trusted you to keep him safe and you allowed him to go to the one place I don’t want him to be.” Mycroft bellows his cheeks flushed in red. This sends Mrs. Hudson running towards the couch.
I poured my drink and stomped back to the couch with the bottle in hand. This would do. Tomorrow would be kinder, less oppressive, less...damn...it all…
John rests a hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck, the other against his sternum to ground him into the present. The room is filled with the sound of Sherlock’s breathing.  John takes his pulse again and it is slower and decides to speak.
“Well with patients who are admitted with a severe head injuries as well as seizure activity it comes with a possibility of memory loss. Your brother believes that it is 1995.  He…” John stops and stares at the hand that is up in his face again.
“I still have it. I don’t know if I’ll ever need to read it. I know the person I’m dealing with. Sherlock is the person he is, I can’t base what I know of him on who he was.”
“But, he...I want to keep my job but your brother wants to remember, terribly. Why don’t you want..”
“Don’t you think I know that?! What the hell do you expect me to do? You’re boyfriend wants me fired if I even sneeze in Sherlock’s general direction. I can’t do this, I need to investigate reenlisting.” John sighs wearily.
“Mycroft is here? God save us all, I feel like i’ve been hit by a large vehicle, did I have a seizure, might explain my memory loss” Sherlock closes his eyes.
“I was watching the eeg at the station and noticed that he was showing signs of waking. I made it to the doorway just as his eyes flew open. He yanked out the IV and shouted Mycroft. Threw the kidney tray and that’s when you walked in.”
“Mycroft! What the hell?!” John sputters putting down the sandwich he was trying to eat during his very short break.
“I’m just terribly busy Sherlock, it’s winter and there are a lot of accidents and deadly cases of influenza, I’ve rarely got a minute to myself.” John states rapidly signing a form handed to him.
“Come now John you must improve your observational skills if you are going to pass them on to our children.” he says with a shake of his head.
Mycroft’s exit is met with icy silence.  Sherlock goes back to his previous pose and begins to think of ways to convince one John Watson into sharing an apartment with him.
“Not now Mrs. Hudson, my brother and I are leaving.” Mycroft declares breathing heavily.  Gregory has a hand tucked into the crook of his elbow holding him back.
“Don’t be sorry. We’re hurting, we’ll hurt more if we sit on this floor any longer though. Come on, to bed with us. We’ll talk as much as you want under the covers ok? I’m exhausted” he commands tugging me up.
He orders an electroencephalogram to see if Sherlock has had any more episodes since admission, and decides to find the brother.
“Sort of. One of them was about a baby elephant who has huge ears and could fly. His mother is taken away from him and it’s quite cute. I liked it a lot as a kid, nearly broke my leg trying to fly like Dumbo. It’s cute, perfect for a baby’s room.”
“Whyyy nottt. I’m an adult...and single...on Valenttine’ssss Day” I say with a wave of my hand. Why was he here, it was all too confusing.
After Sherlock’s long and overy extensive explanation of about how the bottom of third of the door handle indicated the food was excellent at the particular restaurant at the end of the street they tucked themselves into a table in a darkened corner.
“I should mention that the Irish mafia owe me from stopping the head going to jail for something they never did, so I believe that’s why they saved me. Paying back the favour.” Elizabeth sighed again. Then John spoke up.
“Moriarty isn’t dead, that is definite, had Dr Hooper do the blood tests while face-timing me so I could watch from the extraction of the sample to running the results. Definitely not dead. The man who shot himself on the roof was Richard Brook, Jim’s doppelganger, had a history of physiological issues. With that and the fact Jim is a very good manipulator he was convinced to pose as him and shoot himself. Anyhow, Jim is in hiding and as such he is not at the for-front of his network. Sebastian is controlling it and I have to certain people to stop it. Fortunately for me, I’ve known Moriarty for years, decades even, and so whatever he or his network do, I know about it.” She continued to scour through lines of code. “Honestly the amount of shit I’ve seen being sent through his emails, oh boy.” Elizabeth shivered in disgust. “He was sending emails about wanting to sleep with me, then sleep with Will, then sleep with the both of us. But you have to keep in mind that Moriarty shot me off an abandoned building 15 years ago and thinks I’m dead so that just makes those emails even worse.” Elizabeth pulls a face.
He thought. He then shook his head of those thoughts and takes the chair over next to Elizabeth. She glanced at him and smirked before focusing her eyes back on the screens. “How’s the leg?” She asked as John put the chair down. John froze and looked down at his leg, then remembered he left his cane back at the University.
Erm, so it's been a while and I've planned and written a lot for this story. Now I just need to remember to update it :)
“What the fuck?!” She said, not too loudly as to draw attention from the neighbours. She made her way over to the second arm chair and sat down glaring at Elizabeth. “Look, I feel as though I should care about how you knew that but in all honesty I don’t give a damn. All you need to know is that you have to swear on your life never to tell anyone and that subject does not leave this flat. Understood?” Keira narrowed her eyes. Elizabeth glanced up and chuckled before her attention was back on her phone.
“Absolutely amazing.” She stuck out her hand for the woman to shake. “Keira Scordato, you are?” The woman smirked and shook Keira’s hand.
“DI Lestrade? There is someone here to see you… Name? One second.” The woman looked back up at Elizabeth. “What was your name?” She asked politely. Elizabeth pulled out her FBI ID and showed it to the woman.
“Well I wouldn’t say obsession, but it’s an interesting case to learn about.” She said walking backwards towards the chair that held her bag. Elizabeth noticed this but kept walking forwards, keeping the same distance between her and the suspect.
“I’m sorry but who did you say you were?” John finally spoke up. Elizabeth sighed and closed her eyes, turning to face John. When she opened her eyes to see who spoke, her eyes widened.
“Yes, well-” Suddenly Elizabeth’s computer started blaring noises and flashing. She ran over to her computer and slid into her chair, finger running over her keyboard at a superfast speed. Lestrade and John looked at each other and went over to her computer.
“I know.” Elizabeth said. “Unlike you, I keep in contact with Will.” Mycroft’s eye widened at her use of present tense but quickly puts on his blank facial expression and nodded at her.
“No, NO! Get the hell off me! I did nothing! You freak! Who the hell do you think you are?!” She is dragged out the room by Donavon and Anderson, who meet the rest of the team outside. Elizabeth sighs and tosses the gun from hand to hand slowly.
she thought as she finally got her door open. She put the box down next to one of the arm chairs and looked around. The flat was cosy but it would work for what she needed it for.  Just then she heard a knock on the open door. Keira turned to see her landlord standing there with a small smile on his face.
“My apologies dear sister, but-” Elizabeth sighed and held up a hand to Mycroft’s face, stopping his talking.
“This used to be a shoddy basement, so when I heard Mrs Hudson owned the building, I asked if I could renovate it into an apartment for myself and my partner for when we visited the UK.” Elizabeth shrugged. “She said I could. She provided the apartment and I then contracted people to do the place up.” She pointed over to the stair case going down. “There was a sub-basement, so I had our bedroom built down there along with my lab.” John raised an eyebrow.
“Lestrade, I will tell you this only once,” She looked directly into his eyes. “I hate to repeat myself.” She then smirked. “But fortunately I am in a good mood, so…” She showed him her ID. “My name is Dr Elizabeth Holmes, I’m the director of the FBI and an assistant director of Interpol. I happen to also enjoy helping police officers that are at their wit’s end to solve murder cases such as the one on your desk. As such I am offering my services voluntarily as a…” Elizabeth pursed her lips and smirked. “Consulting detective to give it a name, not only to get this case solved and avoid any other murders but to keep me from being bored out of my god damn mind while I wait for information for the case I am actually here for.” Elizabeth stood in front of Lestrade’s desk, head cocked to the side, smiling sweetly. Lestrade just blinked at her.
“Well I’m glad you both seem to be getting on well. If you need me, I’ll be in my flat on the ground floor.” And with that he left. Keira turned from looking towards the door to one of the arm chairs, which Elizabeth seemed to have claimed as her own. She was messaging someone on her phone so Keira just sighed and went over to close the door. As soon as it was closed, Elizabeth spoke up again.
“There’s been an interesting murder, I was checking through the police news on my phone earlier and I’ve been bugging Lestrade about it for the past few minutes. He’s finally agreed for me to go down there and basically show him how ridiculously idiotic his team of officers and forensic workers are.” She stood up and put her hand out for John to shake. “Before I go, Doctor Elizabeth Rosalie Masen Holmes, but you can just call me Liz. Good afternoon.” She grinned and quickly exited the plane before yelling “Come along Keira! The game is on once again.” Keira just grinned and shook her head.
She thought. “Watson? Captain Watson?” She asked. The current occupants of the plane turned and looked over at the new entrants. The shorter man’s eyes lit up in recognition when he saw Keira.
“Yes well, I wanted to tell you that I found someone to take the other room. I take it you were told that you would be sharing the flat? But no need to worry, they are also a student at New York university. She is studying something to do with Biology or something along those lines…”
“Well, first off, just call me Keira. Neither of us are in the army anymore so let’s use first names like normal friends do. Second, I’ve known Liz for near enough 20 years; you pick up on how to ‘deduce’ things.” Keira made quotation marks when she said ‘deduce’. “I know that umbrella guy is Liz’s older brother, she’s complained enough about him and how ‘his diets never work, I have no idea why he keeps going on them’ so that’s kind of obvious. The one sitting down looking like he needs some sleep is her twin William or Sherlock as he is normally known as, again she talks about him a lot plus I met the guy about 3 years ago, long story. You I know personally and from the wedding invitation I got earlier this year, which I apologise for not being able to attend but I had to go back to Afghanistan for a while, another long story, the female sitting next to you is your wife Mary.” Keira sat back in her chair, smiling smugly while the others in the cabin, bar Elizabeth and Sherlock, stared at her wide eyed.
“John?” He asked. John looks up at Lestrade in surprise. Before he can say anything, Elizabeth spoke up again.
“Hold up, hold up. What do you mean your line of work? Who do you work for?” Keira asked as she stood up herself.
“No need Mrs Hudson, I know it’s about time that you had your herbal soother. After I put these hands away, John and Graham are having tea downstairs in my apartment.” She then carried the coolers outside and down the stairs to her front door. Mrs Hudson sighed.
“Interesting…” Elizabeth muttered to herself as the plane finally landed and parked up on the runway. As soon as it stopped, Elizabeth jumped up and grabbed her Belstaff before heading towards the door. Keira sighed and slowly followed her partner.
“I thought, seeing as I don’t have much else to do at present, I would give a helping hand in these Ripper serial killings that are occurring.” Pankhurst nodded.
“It’s a long story and it’s just Dr Watson now, got invalid out of the army about 4 years ago now. Although, we are not in a formal situation, so you can just call me John.” John smiled. “Who’s that with you?” He asked looking behind Keira at Elizabeth, who was currently looking at her phone. Keira opened her mouth to reply, when a voice from behind John spoke up.
“Yeah, well Keira did not appreciate the body parts or experiments in the kitchen so when I told her about this apartment she said to get a lab built.” Elizabeth shrugged. “As I thought about it, it seemed like a brilliant idea and I wondered why I never thought of it before.” John nodded and he and Lestrade sat down at the table. Elizabeth served out the tea and some biscuits then sat down herself. Lestrade then asked something that has been on his mind.
“Italy or Malta?” She repeated, frowning. Keira opened her mouth to answer, but no words came out. The woman raised an eyebrow. “Well?” Keira shook her head and answered.
When I was writing this, I couldn't think of how to go about the case so it's really basic and not the best, sorry bout that >.
“That’s what Will told me. Anyway, why do you have a horrible taste in men? I mean you’re dating Mycroft for crying out loud.” She gave him an amused look. Lestrade choked a little on his tea and John looked over at him.
“Damn it. Mycroft, what the hell are you doing here?” Elizabeth put the boxes down and crossed her arms scowling at the car. Just then the car door opened and out stepped Mycroft Holmes. He walked over to stand in front of his sister, umbrella in hand with his assistant standing behind him, Blackberry in hand.
“Well that just makes our job much easier Will. So thanks for that.” She looked up at the man holding an umbrella and gave him a fake smile. “And fancy seeing you here Richard, I take it the diet isn’t working?” The man Elizabeth referred to as “Will” snorted and started chuckling. Elizabeth just sat there grinning widely while “Richard” glared at her.
“Why the hell did we come all this way if Magnussen is already dead?” Keira raised her eyebrow. Elizabeth smirked as she saw their audience look at them strangely. John then spoke up.
“Mmmm, well if that so, I’m sure you’ve heard about the recent murders reflecting those of Jack’s.” Cordell’s eyes widen slightly. Suddenly she grabs a gun from her bag and aims it at Elizabeth. The whole room freezes and Elizabeth just looks at the woman and sighs before rolling her eyes. “A gun? Why do people always think a gun will save them from getting arrested?” She asks, walking towards Cordell, eyes now focused on hers. “All it does is cause a scene, such as this. Puts others at risk, there is no need for it.” Elizabeth gently puts her hand on top of the gun and slowly takes it from the woman, who is frozen. “See? That wasn’t so bad?” Elizabeth then glances over at Donavon, who shakes herself from her position and walks over to handcuff the woman. While reading her rights, the woman unfreezes and starts to struggle.
“Your agitation indicates that you want to talk about it but are afraid of what the discussion might reveal” he says with a tilt of his head that is appears uncertain.
When Sherlock revealed himself John slammed his fist, gripped his friend’s throat, head butted his friend’s face, bloodied his nose. He thought that he was done with him.
“Oh it takes all sorts. Sherlock has always been a bit isolated so it is nice to see him have a friend,  you know Mrs. Turner has married ones next door.” she says situating herself on the couch.
“All back to rights. Sadly you lost a nice microscope and some electronic probes were damaged by the chemicals.” John says taking out the soup and sandwiches and finding plates and the kettle.
“Greg is fine. These are my co workers. Philip Anderson and Sally Donovan, I’m avoiding home and celebrating wrapping up a case.” Greg says swinging John into the direction of the two people that had tormented Sherlock today.
“Why do I even have two chairs?” Sherlock asks eyes still closed, “this one is awfully comfortable.”
“Ah Mr. Holmes? Your brother is awake now” John says confidently as he can in the face of the imposing figure sitting upright in the intentionally uncomfortable chairs.
“Quite. You flirt with her outrageously to get your way into her lab, and she’s desperately infatuated with you.” Greg says with a sigh and eyes that don’t meet the man in the bed. He raises his eyes for a moment to observe Sherlock. Sherlock looks adrift, his eyes are down turned in sadness and embarrassment.
“John. I know i’ve been less than forthcoming about a lot of things. I know you want to be responsible and pay your share,  but I’ve done nothing to earn the money my parents have left me. I don’t use it ever. But this, our home, where we will raise our child or children. This is worth taking that money and putting it to good use. We can and will use the money we work for the everyday expenses and mortgage. The trust will be saved for the children, they may want big weddings or want to study abroad. Please don’t be angry I can’t bear it today” Sherlock sighs.
I shake the hand of the pale girl before me. Sherlock does as well, his hand lingers longer than necessary and  I laugh awkwardly. Both Sherlock and Charlotte look at me like I’ve lost my mind.
“Yes, ah well,  his vitals are stable. The pressure in his brain will alleviated with a crainiotomy. The tests we are currently running will give us more information about the extent of the possible damage to his brain. When and if he regains consciousness, we will know more. I’m sorry, that is all we know right now.” John says shuffling closer to seemingly kinder of the two men.
The ceremony was quick and simple in front of Lestrade and Mycroft. Typical vows and paperwork but the hidden sentiments in our simple dark rings revealed again that the consulting detective did have hidden depths of feelings.
“God yes.” John says pausing for his gun in the desk drawer, then grabbing his coat and trailing after Sherlock. He didn’t think twice about grabbing it after having to patch Sherlock up several times after cases.
“I meant it,” John stands and extends a hand to Sherlock, “why don’t you either sit or lie down, I’ll clean this up a bit and we’ll see where the day takes us, hm?”
“I’m finding that eating during cases tends to distract me and slows me down.” Sherlock mutters with a dismissive wave of a chopstick.
“For fucks sake, Sherlock Charlotte is a young girl who is pregnant for the first time. She has everything in front of her. A million things could happen in the next two months. She could get back together with the father, her parents can forgive her and let her back home, or Sherlock, look at me.” I watch him raise his head and thud it against the wall biting his lip, “She can simply change her mind and we are left without a child. Please, don’t make me hang my heart on a daughter that I might never have, not again”
Sherlock became happier with the near constant work.  When he was at a loss John would find him either curled up on the couch with his back to the room, or gruesome case files set before him.  John helped as best he could without being there. He yearned when cases presented themselves and he was left alone.  He stopped dating all together. Only made worse when Sherlock begin a worrisome habit of disregarding John’s personal space, and the bloody winking.
“What more trouble could I possibly get into? I’m either at the morgue or my therapist, or at one of my doctors. Other than that I either with you or Mycroft. For God’s sake, the worst thing that could happen is that I die in an unknown freak accident, and that is just a chance I will take to get on with the rest of my life.” Sherlock exclaims in a hand waving stream.
“Ahh Mrs. Hudson, yes got everything cleaned up.  I hate to bother you but, uhm, I wanted to get some things for packing and what not. I don’t want Sherlock to wake up and find himself alone. Could you go up for a bit? Shouldn’t be more than thirty minutes.” John says giving his best smile.
“Angelo. This is Dr. John Watson. The man who treated me after my injury. John I found this address in some of my things.  Apparently I helped Angelo here with a murder charge.”
“Sherlock? You’re cooking...an omelette?” I stare as he cracks eggs with a flourish into a bowl and then begins to dice onions.
“Of course not, snuck out, wanted to relearn the streets of London on my own. I believe I have all of,” he pauses to check his watch, “thirty minutes before Gregory or my brother’s minions realize I am not where I am supposed to be.” Sherlock chuckles.
“Anything else Mycroft?” John says restraining himself from punching the man in his face. Mycroft stiffens and stands to leave. At the door he turns back to John.
“Don’t you dare...dare….make this my fault. This isn’t...my…fault” I grab the errant beaker that hand found it’s way upstairs for some reason and pitch it against the wall behind Sherlock. I immediately regret it as he flinches and backs away.
“Sherlock we got married had dinner and now we are home. You didn’t have to make a speech, you merely had to be pleasant for all of three hours” I can’t help but smile at him in amusement. I unknot my own tie and toss it down with the cards we’d have to go through tomorrow.
“Tired, defeated, lonely,  I hate that I have noone to talk to but you. Molly is grating on my nerves with all of her ‘don’t you remembers’ ” Sherlock glares at John with the last word. John decides that he should no longer be afraid of Mycroft.
“Oh god I thought I was the weepy one?” I chuckle wiping the tear away a kissing him lightly on the lips.
“I don’t know Greg, I was his doctor. I’m nothing but a doctor who treated him with kindness and respect. Something apparently that no one appears to think he deserves.” helpless John takes a swig of the liquid.
“Sherlock. I see you’ve been having plenty of visitors.” Mycroft says batting against Molly’s balloon with a sneer.
Sherlock is exhausted from dealing with his new doctor and trying to retrieve the barest scraps of his memories. He manages to keep the frustrated tears at bay until the room is empty again. He wanted to see John, talk to the kind doctor who chatted needlessly about spy novels and hospital politics. He drifted into an anxious and exhausted sleep.
John does that and realizes the ‘Sherlock Holmes problem’ was worse now that they each others’ numbers.  He thought about making an appointment with his therapist, but he knew that it would be a fruitless endeavor talking to her about his former patient since she would inevitably turn the conversation towards his nightmares, his PTSD and he would be passive aggressive and leave feeling worse.
“John, that is the third time you’ve been staring at a child today.” Sherlock murmurs squeezing my elbow.
“Morning Sherlock, could you flick the kettle on? Need anything? Bathroom’s all yours.” John murmurs eyeing the thin glimpse of pale skin above Sherlock’s lounge pants.
“Sherlock” I yell from the living room my hands shaking grasping the card from Lestrade in my hand so hard it is starting to crumple.
“For someone who doesn’t bother, Sherlock appears very attached to me for some reason, 44 texts in a four day period. Seeking me out.” John states sitting back in his chair, revelling in his small triumph.
“Sherlock you still do not realize how much worse the world has become since you last remembered. Please, trust me for once to know what is best for you. Sherlock, I do care what happens to you” Mycroft sighs.  Sherlock settles back against the bed in a with a pout.
“Oh um. Nevermind that. Here we are. Sherlock, please listen to me.” Greg states as the car reaches the Holmes house.  Sherlock gets out of the car leaving Gregory to return to work.
“I see. Gentlemen I think my brother has had enough visitors for one day, Doctor Watson a word?” Mycroft says and points his umbrella out into the hallway.
“Because you said you didn’t love me.” John interrupts. I freeze mid sip of my now cold tea, knowing this was a moment that would end our friendship, that would end the Sherlock Holmes & John Watson partnership, it would end it all. “Sherlock?” John says closing in on me and poking me in the chest.
My phone jolts me awake and I lazily reach for it.  The two of us are tangled in each other as usual. His curls in my face, his long legs thrown over mine, burning hot as always.
“Thank you for your apology Mycroft. But don’t you see? He is completely distraught that he can’t remember his life! He wants to know what his life has become, even if it was terrible.  Why would you deny something that is so inherently necessary to ones being, to know who they are?  Did you see your brother yesterday?  He wants to be back in his own home. We’ve boxed things up that he found unnecessary. He’s doing well with the work he does with Gregory, which I am sure he has shared with you. If he remembers his life, I think he would be happier and better at everything.” John emphatically states, returning Mycroft’s glare.
It was now a month and a half since he had said goodbye to Sherlock Holmes. John’s routine was back to normal. He avoided neuro as much as he could, deferring to other doctors when head injuries came in to the trauma unit.  The pain in John’s leg returned to the ever present shooting pain from calf to his mid back. The pain was more vicious than ever.
Two chapters this week because 6 was really short and I wanted to get this chapter out cause I killed myself with the cute. (apologies to Disney)
John listens as the kind veterinarian explains that the mystery dog was resting, It wasn’t microchipped and they hadn’t any record of missing Irish Setters recently. It was a bit malnourished, a bit elderly, but would be fine with some rest and care. It would be sent to the local humane society as soon as they felt that it was ready.
“Who cares John. We’re about to be fathers. Get dressed!” he shouts pulling on a dress shirt and attacking the buttons.
“NOW!? Christ get up why are you sitting there?!” he shouts flinging out of bed and pulling on my pajama bottoms.  I stifle the panicked giggle in my throat and gesture at his bare calves.
John knew Sherlock was trying to get behind John’s last text the night before. So John answered truthfully as he could.
“John it is physically impossible for elephants to fly and you’re leaving something out, I can tell.”
“ouch fuck” John mumbles to himself and squints at the light streaming in through the small window in his room.  He blearily fumbles for his phone and swears again at the text exchange between he and Sherlock. His last words being
“No, no. I have to take that to the vet?” John mutters pointing as one of the medics has kneeled next to the dog and has it wrapped in an orange blanket. John rubs his face and then searches on his phone where the nearest veterinary office. He picks up the shivering dog with “You better survive this.”
“Allowed? He was fine. It is as if you think of him as a child, that you don’t even want him to remember anything. This is good place for him!” John shouts back at Mycroft. Greg holds up a hand to keep John from getting at Mycroft.
“I know John...you would have waited til death for me but you couldn’t do it alone...you needed someone even if it wasn’t what you really wanted.”
“They aren’t all idiots. Doctor Watson is a fascinating person and an excellent doctor” Sherlock states avoiding his brother’s pointed gaze.
“You, you deserve many things for helping this great man. This man. He cleared my name.” Angelo says giving John a meaningful look.
“Sherlock! I was hoping it was you and not just your brother. How are you feeling dear with the whole amnesia business?” she asks.
“Fine great..come on in!!” he bellows. I side eye Sherlock and notice my husband is biting his lip and clasping his hands.
“I would believe that if It wasn’t loaded and near your bed. It is worrisome to me. Perhaps you should be taking medication as well. Please tell me the truth John, you’re a terrible liar.”
“You must have it memorized. Sing it for me, I’d like to hear what you’ll be singing to our child as they try to fall asleep in your arms” he states matter of factly.
“Doctor Watson you will find at the end of your shift that a new doctor has been placed in charge of my brother’s care. Despite your assurances it appears that you and my brother have formed some sort of connection.  I do not like it at all. Your concern over where my brother goes after he leaves this hospital is none of you business. Now, if you can’t keep yourself away from my brother, I will go further and see you removed from this hospital, do I make myself clear?” Mycroft growls pulling down his waistcoat, umbrella hooked over his arm.
Sherlock takes in John’s bitten lip and raised eyebrows and sighs.  “I think I’ll just stick to tracking your movements and showing up unexpectedly/”
“This is now a good time as ever John since you are beginning to act like you will snatch the next infant you see off of the street” Sherlock has the nerve to say with a smile.
“Ah, well, um I met you five years ago. At that time you were still taking heroin and cocaine on a regular basis. uhhmm you showed up a crime scene high yet solved it within fifteen minutes. A year ago you entered a rehabilitation program which was semi successful, you finally stopped using completely six months ago. You’ve solved a lot of cases for Scotland Yard, for which I am grateful. And, I would also call you my friend” Lestrade relates in one long stream. He looks embarrassed.
“I’m sorry I keep forgetting how fragile and fleeting all of this is. I’ve hurt you I’m sorry. It will be ok” Sherlock pulls me into his arms, a hand on my head like holding a child. I press a kiss to his neck and whisper, “Thank you.”
Before John can answer with any sort of speculation a loud “Yoo, hoo.” comes up the stairwell and the open door. Soon an elderly woman in a purple dress comes in with a tray of tea and biscuits.
“Greg I know Sherlock hasn’t eaten all day, I think after the trauma of today he deserves a good meal and rest. As a doctor I insist.”  John commands with a slight smile playing at his mouth.
“Yes of course” I sputter and take one of Sherlock’s hands in mine and he grips it on a bone crushing hold.
A few ragged breaths occur before Sherlock replies, “Lestrade thought it would be a good idea to…” Sherlock rolls his neck shrugging off John’s hand, “to bring me to Scotland Yard. He’s been giving me my previously solved case files to see if my conclusions would be the same, of course they were.”
When they were dismissed so suddenly by the weasily Irishman John could barely stand, Sherlock helped him up, held him close as they made their way to the road and a cab and finally 221b Baker Street.  They sat in silence sharing strong liquor extricated from a hidden nook. As they finished John stood and patted Sherlock on the arm.
“Doctor Watson, I would tread carefully around my brother. As I recall my nineteen year-old brother was quite the flirtatious manipulator. I would think that your career wouldn’t take kindly to a citation of improper conduct” Mycroft sneers.
“John I’m...I… I’m not a nice person. I’ve hurt people I…” Sherlock mumbles.  John takes in his former patient with concern. He recognizes the signs of a panic attack and immediately switches into doctor mode.
Sherlock shoots John a look in consideration, “John, you’re looking quite bored as of late, you’ve seen plenty of dead bodies? Care to see another?”
“Sherlock? Hello, I’m DI Gregory Lestrade, we work together” Greg says slinking into the room. He places a collection of cleverly displayed test tubes that held different candies.  Sherlock is propped up in bed, one hand on a laptop, the other furiously writing in a notebook.
“As I told Doctor Watson, I was on the way to a chemistry exam. I think, I think I might have been with someone. MY GOD THIS IS INTOLERABLE!” Sherlock shouts pulling at what is left of his dark curls.
“Mrs. Hudson, I’m merely reacquainting myself to part of my life. Dr. Watson is my friend who offered to help me. We are not romantically involved. Thank you for the tea, if you would please let us continue with what we were doing.” Sherlock says.
“Yes, Will’s my brother, but what he does and what I do are completely separate.” She smiled a small smile. “I’m not in the position I am in for no reason.” Lestrade nodded slowly. Suddenly Elizabeth jumped up from her chair and put her hands together. “Right, now that’s out the way with, let’s go find your killer.” She strode out of Lestrade’s office while he sat back down in his chair. Anderson then knocks on his door.
“Biological and Forensic Science Mr Wilson.” Said a female voice from behind him. Keira looked up to see a rather tall female with long black hair, blueish eyes and incredibly sharp cheek bones. She gave Keira a small smile before looking her up and down. “Italy or Malta?” She asked. Keira just blinked.
“OF course, I have no desire to speak about family issues, mine or yours.” Elizabeth then froze once more before looking up at Keira once again. Keira rose an eyebrow.
“Don’t worry, we can get to know each other later. You still live in 221B don’t you?” Elizabeth glanced over John and before he could reply Elizabeth was speaking again. “Of course you do, Mrs Hudson keeps saying I should go up to say hello and have tea but I’m quite busy you see, I’m not in the UK for no reason, I’m working on a case about illegal organ harvesting, very interesting actually, it’s working on an international scale and I’ve spent the last couple of months working on it and I’m about 10% away from solving it. I mean Interpol have had this case for years and have gotten know where so that’s why I stepped in. Good thing too actually, they were a little bit concerned when I offered because of what went down over here but once I showed them that it was a bunch of bullshit they were more than happy to hand the case over. The problem is Keira is back in Afghanistan at the moment which is obviously concerning but I need to work and keep my mind occupied so if that means I have to take a case in which I have to travel overseas, so be it. Honestly I would have rather taken a cruise ship over here but they were insistent that I fly even though I am not a big fan of very long flights, 2-5 hours I can handle but any more than that, I get a bit restless but what are you going to do?” Elizabeth went on and on and by the time she had finished her small rant, everyone apart from Lestrade, John, and herself had left the room. Elizabeth looked around. “Also I do tend to go on a bit.” She smiled innocently. There was a long silence then John started chuckling.
“Hold on one moment. Who the hell are you and what gives you the right to waltz into my office and tell me how to do my job?!” He shouted. Elizabeth sighed and put her finger and thumb up to the bridge of her nose before replying.
“Elizabeth Holmes.” Elizabeth quickly dropped her hand and stepped into the flat, looking around. Mr Wilson, cleared his throat and the two women turned to look at him, evidently they had both forgotten he was still there.
“Oh, hello there, welcome to Scotland Yard, is there any way I can assist you?” The woman at the reception desk asked. Elizabeth smiled at the woman.
John just stares at Sherlock. He knows it will be good for him to be around his things but having to lie to do so and bring on the wrath of his brother was very concerning.  John honestly wasn’t afraid of Mycroft Holmes anymore, he was more worried that the older man would isolate Sherlock further than he already was, and John knew that would only make Sherlock’s depression and issues dealing with his memory loss worse.
I start the kettle and lean against the counter. I realize this is the last time our home will be quiet and clean. It will be the last time that I will be able to make tea without worrying if the baby is asleep, or that Sherlock has changed her.  This was it, the day our lives would never be the same ever again. We would be responsible for molding another human being from scratch, to teach her how the world worked and how much we loved her.  My hands began to shake and I clenched them to stop them. It wasn’t a time for fear, but one for joy. Sherlock and I were going to be parents to a little girl. A little girl who would call me papa and Sherlock dad, a little girl I would dress in pinks and purples with ribbons in her hair, and who Sherlock would bring to the morgue for her first autopsy.
“It looks like I...had some issues...intravenous drug use. That’s a bit troubling.” Sherlock says running a finger along the well healed track marks.
“Sherlock I am merely here because I want to tell you that I regret my actions of yesterday.” Mycroft says as he takes the opposite chair.
“I’m sorry Gavin. I will try to rectify that, also Ms. Hooper would appear to be a potentially useful and kind friend, which I appear to be lacking at the moment.” Sherlock apologizes.
“Go grab your laptop. I’m sure it’s streaming somewhere.” I shrug at him and turn to find the instructions for the crib.
Why wouldn’t John have told him he wasn’t going to be his doctor anymore. Was he getting worse? Was there some underlying condition he was not aware of? He began trying to figure out his password again to no satisfying end. It was probably something sentimental event or person that he was no longer in contact with.  Hours later when John usually would stop by to talk and bring Sherlock a cup of caffeine free tea, with apologies about how they had to watch his blood pressure, there was no John, and still no new doctor.   Panic began to course through his body and he couldn’t control his heart rate.  John Watson was the only thing that was making his condition and his stay in this hospital remotely tolerable. His blood pressure began to rise and he tried deep breaths, but soon the monitors began to alarm and a red faced, overweight, elderly man in lab coat steps into the room.
“Sherlock. Charlotte is having our baby.” I huff. This gets a reaction out of my husband, the sleepy housecat.
With shaking hands I open the box and part the tissue. Nestled inside was a small pink camouflage onesie with “Future Army Doctor” embroidered on the front. My anger began is slow ebb away from the surface and I buried my face in the onesie.  My mind races to figure all the places that Sherlock could run off to.
Those three words were all it took to know that this man would be the beginning or the end of him. One he would gladly accept.
“I was being nice, she’s smart and attractive and she’s obviously attracted to me by the way she keeps looking at my lips and chest. I didn’t do romantic relationships with either gender cause I found them unnecessary and messy, yet a lot has changed in 19 years so the possibility of me picking up a girlfriend is not out the realm of possibility” Sherlock states with a wave of his hand between himself and Molly.
“Right. Always full of surprises” I say settling down at the table. My mind drifts to him cooking for a little one in pig tails and the momentary fear of the unknown drifts away.
“Despite what the good Doctor Watson believes, Sherlock as you know from the obvious scars you have a history of intravenous drug use that you are clean of for only six months. Despite the fact that I have had your flat checked I worry about a relapse.  Gregory and I are all you have as far as a support system at this juncture. I do not trust anyone that I would hire to look after you, and my partner and I will not submit to life in that hovel you call a flat. Until I feel you are well enough to not harm yourself, I will not consider letting you live on your own” Mycroft scowls at his brother.
“I won’t forget you John Watson. You are only person who has never asked me to remember something, pressured me to get better, told me who I should be, or dismissed what I want. I won’t forget you. Have a good evening, Doctor.” Sherlock turns out of the room and John completely forgets about having to escort him out. He drops to the bed with raging pain in his leg.
Fast forward sixteen years and he was a limping former army doctor in need of a flatmate. When he ran into Mike in the park he was at once elated and regretful at once. He wanted someone who knew him before to be his friend, but the fact he was in need of a roommate at his age and limping, he could barely make it through the coffee without wanting to flee to the dark cave of his bedsit. He felt better moving around instead of sitting and when Mike had brought him into the innocuous lab and he took in the form of Sherlock Holmes he was rendered breathless. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t dropped his phone as he handed it over. John had cringed at the thought that he could have at least shaved more closely that morning.
“Right, thank you Gloria. Try to be respectful of the patients if you can. Even if they aren’t of you” John says spinning on his heel and heading toward Sherlock’s room.
Sherlock Holmes was slurry drunk. He had never seen him like this, ever. He realizes with horror that he must have received the card. So drunk he had said that he didn’t love him. The slurring words, the cruel jests. It hurt so much more than John could possibly predict.
Sherlock continues to shake and tears continue drip off his chin. He is silent and John considers calling the psych department for a consult since the man is is so frantically undone.  Sherlock suddenly lifts his head and says, “Another person, Philip, joined in and said ‘you’re faking the memory loss aren’t you. For some sort of experiment’ now tell me, why would he say that if I wasn’t completely abnormal.”
“Well, Indian is the only food that you have ever stolen from me since we met . I’m glad you are getting better. I’ve missed your presence in the lab it is a bit dull with only the dead around” Molly smiles at him.
“John you do recall I use your computer quite often. You played this song almost once day when I was gone. It means something to you...and now to me. The first dance with my husband” Sherlock smirks, “I didn’t get to dance at your first wedding. I love to dance”
. We’d intervene and distract him and he would be ok, he wouldn’t use.  So today I texted Mycroft when Sherlock stormed away from the building without a fucking word.
“Good, sense of humor still there. I’m Doctor John Watson, I’ve restrained you because you got a bit violent there the last time..  I’ll undo them if you promise to keep the furniture where it belongs” John smiles as he watches for a response.
I shuffle quietly back towards the room, Eloise thumping her bottle against my shoulder, finding Sherlock rocking Alexander and finishing the lullaby.
“Well gentlemen, why don’t we sit and get to know each other ” Charlotte says eyeing us both. Sherlock drops her hand and reaches for me and catches my wrist in a vice-like grip. I wince and pry his fingers away and take his hand in mine.
“I love you, you ridiculous bastard.” John says tugging off the towel and pulling Sherlock close into a kiss.
“Sherlock? Hey...can you open your eyes?!” John gasps adjusting the IV to push more fluid. He takes the man’s blood pressure. A groan emits from the man before him and John sighs. There is some response from the patient, perhaps this wouldn’t end as terribly as he expected. Sherlock’s blood pressure is low but heart rate is consistent, he checks his eyes. Pinpoint pupils, damn….. He gets the man’s blood pressure stabilized, he’s breathing on his own, and he is still responding to pain stimuli.
Lestrade laughs uncomfortably. He doesn’t know where to start, the Sherlock lying on the bed with his head half shaved, eyes innocently looking up at him wasn’t the Sherlock that he knew four days ago.
Lestrade walks out of the room to an annoyed Sherlock. Sherlock returns to his computer keeping an eye on his brother as he and Doctor Watson go out into the hallway.
“Of course. So are you, now tell me it will all be ok and I tell you the elephant story and we’ll switch jobs” I say tampering down my emotional state,  walking towards him extending a hand to help him up.
“Sherlock I’m serious when I said I don’t think I can do this again. Losing two of them in two years, I can’t do this. If you leave I’ll understand, I put us through this. I did this to us.” I sniffle against him.
“Leaving, finding Doctor Watson, wouldn’t want you get in trouble if I take a fall. Head injury, memory loss, I’m dangerous to myself” Sherlock tosses over his shoulder as he takes several steps towards the bank of elevators.
“Jesus that’s...God I’d better get out of here before you figure out the color of my pants” John says turning to leave.
“I left my fiance alone, in bed, naked, on Valentine’s Day so see if you were ok, if you were high, or hurt, or dead. What can you deduce about that Sherlock Holmes” John growls, his hands clenched, his jaw set.
“America is very nice this time of year. Plenty of sunshine and unwanted healthy babies” Sherlock nuzzles my neck.
“I felt it better that they didn’t. Over the years we’ve found them insufferable and overbearing at best. Sherlock how are you feeling?” Mycroft asks suddenly with genuine concern, as if remembering why he was actually there.
“I told him we were doing this adoption thing ourselves. He worries the stress will be too much and because he cares about you Sherlock.  But very much like you, he doesn’t always listen”  I say moving the papers off the empty end of the couch and taking his feet in my hands.
“There. I feel much better. John...tell me it will be ok again.” Sherlock says clutching at my elbows his head bowed onto my shoulder. I am having my own panic rising take a breath for the man before me and say as confidently as possible,
“In a way yes, but he was not a psychopath then, well at least I didn’t notice, so either his tenancies weren’t as prominent then, or I was being and idiot.” Liz frowned for a moment before shaking her head and continuing. “It was only after we stopped dating did it get weird. I got body parts sent to me in the mail, then the ‘suicides’ started.” Elizabeth glanced over at John. “Basically, all you went through with Moriarty, Keira and I went through it first.” John’s eyes widened and Elizabeth looked back to her monitors. “The suicides, the hostages, Keira got put into a bomb vest…” Elizabeth swallowed. “He broke into the White House and sat in the president’s chair to prove a point to me. It all ended on the roof of an abandoned building in the outskirts of New York. He told me to jump otherwise he would tell the snipers he had hired to shoot Mr Wilson, our landlord, Lieutenant Jackson, an officer I worked with regularly at NYPD and Keira…” Elizabeth relaxed back in her chair and put a hand over her eyes before sighing.
“Excuse me, but did I say you could come in?” She asked the 2 officers. They froze and looked at each other before looking back at Elizabeth. “Well? Do you normally walk into civilian’s apartment like you own the place? Oh wait is it because this is where my brother lives? The fact you would just conduct random drugs bust when you felt like it and enter a civilian’s home without a proper warrant? I will let it go this time but next time you wish to visit my residence, you will knock and wait until I give you permission to enter my home, understand?” By the end of her rant, Elizabeth was glaring at the officers with dark narrowed eyes. Donavon gulped and she and Anderson nodded. Elizabeth’s expression lightened up and she nodded. “Good, now I ask that you both leave and I will most likely see you tomorrow when I come to write up a statement.” Elizabeth then waved them off. The two officers looked over at Lestrade who just glanced at Elizabeth before looking back at them. After a couple of moments Donovan and Anderson left the flat.
“She’s my wife.” Elizabeth then frowned and looked across the room. John turned to see what she was looking at and saw a photo of Elizabeth, Sherlock and a red haired woman smiling in front of the statue of liberty. “She was sent back to Afghanistan about 3 months ago, CIA business and seeing as she is the director of the CIA, it made sense for her to go.” Elizabeth had a blank look on her face for a moment before she sighed and looked down at her cup. “Don’t know when she’s coming back though…” There was a long silence before John spoke.
“Well, I’m now the head of the CIA and we have business over here so yeah. How about you? Going on vacation or something?” She glanced around the plane. Watson chuckled.
“Okay, why are we at a University? Is she a Uni student?” Elizabeth shook her head and replied while typing on her phone.
“Liz, slow down for a second will you?!” Keira shouted at her partner, who did not stop running until she got outside. Elizabeth put and arm out. Not seconds later a taxi drove straight up and she got in, leaving the door open for Keira. “Bloody cab magic works here as well I see.” Keira muttered as she got in the cab and closed the door.
x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x
in 2 weeks at they are their wits end.” Elizabeth’s phone then went off and she looked at it before bounding towards the door and flinging it open and heading out, leaving Keira open mouthed, standing in the middle of piles of boxes.
Lestrade was sat in his office, staring at his door in confused shock. Sally had called him from reception saying that someone wanted to see him but as soon as she went to ask the person’s name, she’d gone completely silent. Then he spoke down the phone at her, another woman picked up the phone and said she would be going along to his office shortly.
“It is to do with the recent serial killings based around Jack the Ripper.” Elizabeth gave the woman a smirk. There was a moment of silence before the receptionist blinked and swallowed and picked up the phone.
“Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, my name is Dr Elizabeth Holmes, I’m the director of the FBI and an assistant director at Interpol.” She twirled round slowly, showing her ID. “Before you ask, yes I am related to Will- I mean Sherlock, and if anyone says anything about me being a fraud…” Elizabeth gave them a semi-dark look. “I can tell you now that neither my brother nor I are frauds and that is fact. Without, I believe that crime rates in both America and here in London would be extraordinarily high so all I can say is do your research before you start spouting out ignorant comments.” She then turned to the woman in the centre of the room.
Elizabeth opened her eyes and stared up at the ceiling of her apartment. It had been 2 weeks since she had arrived in London and 12 months after her brother had ‘died’. She sighed and shook her head of those thoughts.
“I see you are as good as my sister says then Major Scordato.” Sherlock spoke up, with a slightly rasping voice. Keira rolled her eyes.
“Wha- Hey Liz! What are you doing?!” Keira chased up after her and found herself standing next to Elizabeth in the doorway of the plane. Inside the main part of the plane were 4 other people, 3 men and a woman that Keira vaguely recognised. She looked at the shortest of the 3 men.
“Alright then, Lestrade, make sure your team is ready and take Dr Holmes with you. I trust her judgement and I hope you do as well. We can discuss what I wished to talk about when you get back.” He smiled and nodded to Lestrade and then to Elizabeth before departing. Elizabeth just smirks and looks over at Lestrade with a raised eyebrow and a knowing look.
“Yeah, we were buddies.” He said turning back to the table and taking a sip of his tea. Lestrade then spoke again.
“There you go dears, now go and keep Elizabeth from getting too lonely. Keira isn’t here so she’s been all by herself since she got here. I’ve been trying to get her to come up and meet you John but she kept saying she had things to do. John gave her a small smile.
Keira shook herself out of her reverie as she felt the cab stop and Elizabeth bound out of the cab, leaving her to pay the fare. Keira rolled her eyes before paying and ran after Elizabeth who ducked under the tape showing the officer her ID and down to the dead body that was lying on the stage.
“I need to find something to do…” She muttered to herself. She got up from her sofa and wondered over to her massive computer set up. She started browsing the news websites for anything that may have happened recently in London. She came across a series of murders that were occurring throughout London. Elizabeth scanned through the articles and scoffed.
“Shall we put surveillance on Dr Holmes?” She asked as Mycroft continued to follow the car with his eyes, until it turned out of sight.
“Hi, I was wondering if I could speak to a Detective Inspector Lestrade if possible.” The woman blinked in surprise.
“How? Well by looking at your skin tone, facial features, hair, clothing, the way you hold yourself and the few items you have unpacked, I was able to deduce that you are from Europe, southern Europe to be precise, in particular Italy or Malta, hence me asking you which country.” Keira just stared at the women, mouth open wide for a few moments before snapping it shut.
“Dr Elizabeth Holmes, Director of the FBI and an assistant director of Interpol.” The woman froze and Elizabeth could here the DI over the phone.
“Well then, before I go can I ask about the ring on your finger?” Elizabeth sighed and looked over at Mycroft with a bored expression on her face.
x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x
“Did she just say something about hands…?” She asked. The men nodded their head. “Right, definitely related to Sherlock.” She muttered as she got out the car. The other 2 followed and walked into the building. They saw Elizabeth animatedly talking to a young man.
“Yeah, they are alright for transportation, you just need to sign them out and they are all yours.” Elizabeth walked over to the young man and took the papers. She quickly read through them and signed them off. Michael took the papers and nodded at Elizabeth and took his leave. Elizabeth then picked up the coolers and turned to the two men.
“Come on, you two are with me. I’ll let the other know where they need to go when we get there.” Donovan looked at her boss.
“Lestrade, I suggest you get back to your office, I’ll explain as much as I can tomorrow John grab a chair and sit down next to me.” With that Elizabeth looked back at her computer screens. Lestrade and John looked at each other worriedly. After a few minutes Lestrade sighs and just nods at John before leaving the apartment without another word. John grabs a chair from the dining table and picks it up to take it into the front room. He glances over at the photo of Elizabeth, Keira and Sherlock and sighs.
“Ah good day to you Lestrade, could you direct me to where your office is or come to the reception area to talk with me please?” The phone was silent for a while before a reply was given.
