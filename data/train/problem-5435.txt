What frustrated him the most was he had no solid idea what he needed to prepare for. There were too many variables. Too many possibilities, and if he missed just one…
Steve looked over his shoulder with a hard gaze and mouthed, “Stop it,” to Bucky. Jeez. It had been a few glances; there was no reason to cross-examine the guy. Steve was more than capable of handling himself by now.
“I don’t understand,” she began slowly, tone quiet. “I thought you’d stopped that. After you came back to me, after the Accords. You promised me you’d stop. Iron Man’s not needed anymore. What, with the Avengers gone and new countermeasures intact. He isn’t a part of the picture.
When Tony popped his head into the living room, he had to admit that he’d been half hoping to find it empty. He immediately felt guilty for the thought, giving it a vehement push out of his mind. Nope, he didn’t hope that at all. He didn’t hope that because that would mean Pepper was off running his company instead of being here with him. And he wanted,
, he’ll find nothing underneath. Find it to be a trick of the light. Because what else could it be if not a trick of the fucking light?
The man blinked, eyes going rounder a minute fraction, and there was a sudden upturn to his mouth that seemed bemused somehow. Steve felt his knees go weak.
Sitting back, he slumped against the floor and wiped his face with the front of his shirt. For a while, he let himself float. His head felt like it was cloudy and stuffed with cotton. Like, a lot of cotton. The feeling was eerily similar to overdosing on drugs.
He forced himself to take a few steadying breaths, reminding himself that he didn’t have the arc reactor anymore. His heart worked just fine without it. Tony didn’t need it anymore.
It was eerie to him the way Heimdall stared unblinkingly as he approached. There wasn’t so much as a word spoken to him as he approached, and the god only moved to step aside when Tony got within a one-foot range. In a quick, steady motion, Heimdall’s arm swept out to point in the direction of the gate. If the actual god wasn’t a sight to see, then the portal truly was.
Getting onto his hands and knees, Tony searched beneath their bed, palming at the scratchy carpet in search of the briefcase he always kept there. The one Pepper didn’t know about. The armor in the case wasn’t as fleshed out with finesse and a mountain of much needed upgrades like the suit in his workshop was, but it would do for what he hoped Thor had in mind. Really, he was only there for the research and science portion of this little pet project. Tony doubted Thor would let him anywhere close to the bad guy after their little conversation, but he might need to poke around. People in politics always had a tendency to hide things right beneath the noses of their subordinates.
A tenseness he never let go of these days began to ascend his spine, making its way to his shoulders, and he shot a furtive glance to his right.
The front of the man’s shirt was a neat tuck into a tight pair of black skinny jeans that left very little to Steve’ imagination, hugging the luscious curves of his hips and cheeks that looked like they’d been chiseled by Alexandros of Antioch’s very own hand. His thighs and calves were all sharpened curves of lean muscle, and the man’s pants were folded up at his ankles. The end of his fibula and tibia were a sharp, defining jut beneath tanned, olive skin before they disappeared into bright, white Oxfords.
On those days, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d ever really had Pepper. Ever really had a shot at the whole happy life, nuclear family deal. His life was becoming eerily similar to
Tony raises his hands to rub at his eyes in hopes of bringing more awareness to himself as the last remnants of sleep seep from his pores. When his hand meets his face, though, Tony pauses, brow furrowing at the cool sliminess being wiped from his palm.
“I went to a private school out of state,” the man said, looking back to Bucky. “I doubt you’ve heard of it.” A thrill shot through Steve’s spine when he saw the man’s lean fingers twist into a cross behind his back, painted black fingernails gleaming in the fluorescent lighting shining against the titanium walls. One of the most real smiles he’d felt since coming back to the States threatened to overcome Steve’s lips. It was like he was in on a private joke with this complete stranger, and he was aware, in a sudden instant, that this man had no problem playing the game Bucky had set up for them.
“It’s Bruce now, huh?” he asked, trying to keep his voice from rasping. “Well, not so sorry to say you’re a little late,” Tony commented, waving his hand in a noncommittal gesture, eyes sliding to the suit for an unbidden second.
Steve had laughed off the idea, and tried not to be offended. He could get his own dates, if he wanted.  Except he was Captain America, and suddenly everyone he talked to had their own agenda, their own needs. Outside of Tony and the rest of the team, he’s not sure anyone saw him as just Steve Rogers. He’d tried to displace that energy, throw himself into his work, but he wasn’t a monk. Or, at any rate, he wasn’t interested in turning into one, involuntarily.
About a dozen different emotions fly across Peter’s face, but he clamps his mouth shut tight, just clutches the strap of his backpack a little bit tighter.
“Oh.” Tony didn’t even know Steve still kept up with his lease there. There was a lot, it turned out, that he hadn’t paid attention to.
“It makes me feel better,” Peter says. “Maybe if you have bad dreams, Mr. Stark will let you sleep next to him too.”
“This is gonna feel good, Rogers,” he said before swallowing him down.  Steve had snapped his hips in surprise, fingers immediately winding through Tony’s hair.  Tony sucked him off quickly, pumping his hand along the base of Steve’s dick while the head hit the back of his throat. Steve came with a series of choked groans, his come flooding Tony’s mouth.  Tony swallowed what he could, let the rest drip obscenely out of his mouth. After, he crawled up Steve’s chest and kissed him again, making it wet and messy, so there was no mistaking what they’d just done.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered again. Steve’s eyes softened just enough and Tony leaned in and kissed him, this time in apology. His mouth was soft and pliant, and he opened easily as Tony’s tongue pushed between his lips, licking at the inside of his mouth. He moaned again, a sound Tony knew he’d never get tired of hearing.
“I know that’s the trade off here, with what we do. But watching you both—” He has to stop and clear the emotion from his throat. “Watching you both struggle to breathe was not an experience I care to relieve ever again.”
“It won’t help if you harass him,” Steve says, tugging on one of his older uniforms. He straps on his cowl and Tony notices white medical tape still wrapped around his knuckles. “Give him some space.”
Tony doesn’t sleep that night. He lies in bed, running over the calculations again and again until finally, sometime around 4am, his eyes just finally shut. It’s Peter playing quietly with his bear that wakes him a few hours later.
“Oh god, Pete, I’m so sorry,” Tony says, daring to take a few steps closer. “I never wanted you to see any of that.”
Steve grunts an acknowledgement, and checks his pulse the old fashioned way, fingers pressed to his neck. The sonic boom had fried his entire suit, cutting off access to FRIDAY.
“That was wonderful, kid. Exactly like we drew up,” Tony says. His eyes are bright and Peter’s smile grows impossibly wider.  As they leave, Tony slings an arm around Peter’s shoulder and catches Steve’s eye. The corner of his mouth turns up a fraction and he gives Steve a barely perceptible wink.
“Fine,” Steve says, still focused on the bed. He’s shaking out the pillow cases, as if the compound doesn’t have a cleaning service.
There are plenty of cheers and a few tears as they all rush into the hanger. He’s able to grab Peter for a few seconds before he gets pulled away by everyone else. Nat, Bruce, Steve, Sam can’t help but pinch his cheeks again.
A drawn out, “Steve, fuck,” is all Tony manages before the first spurt of come hits Steve’s face, dripping along his cheeks and jawline. Still fisting himself rapidly, head thrown back and eyes closed, Tony spills all over Steve, marking his face and chest. Rendered speechless for once, Tony twitches weakly as Steve takes a few experimental tastes of his spent cock.
His anxiety spurs him to work quicker and harder than before. He has no idea how much time’s gone by, minutes or hours or days, until Steve comes looking for him, Peter tucked against his side.
After the meeting, Tony stops him in the hallway with a light touch on his wrist. “This is a glorified security escort, Cap,” Tony tells him. “Let Rhody hang back with Carol and the kids.”
“Not for me, actually,” Tony said, sipping his drink.  “It’s for the good of the team. And for the good of you. You gotta loosen up Rogers. Enjoy this life at least somewhat.”
They kissed again, slowly, as Steve came down. With his messy hand, Tony undid his own pants and pushed his aching erection along the flat of Steve’s stomach. Steve moaned at the touch and moved to take Tony in his hand, but Tony gently pushed his hand away. “Not yet,” he said.  He fisted himself slowly as Steve watched, the head of his cock leaving little clear streaks across Steve’s belly.  “All week,” he said, “I wanted to mark you. Make sure everyone knew you were mine.”
Tony watched as they two traded increasingly sloppy kisses, not as confused as he should have been about Steve’s request for him to stay. This was weird, uncharted territory, the evening moving in a direction he hadn’t consciously anticipated, but might have unconscioulsy wanted.
Peter shrugs but smiles when Tony promises him an extra glass of juice with his breakfast. It’s hardly a routine, but just like the day before, Tony throws on a sweatshirt, pours some cereal and cracks two eggs into a pan. They’re halfway through eating when the door chimes.
Tony sighs and twines their fingers together, careful not to squeeze Steve’s bandaged hand too tightly.
Hope shakes her head. “That’s not likely. The worst case scenario is that his cells start to age too rapidly, or that his physiological response isn’t in line with his mental response.”
For a second, Tony can see them both, four-year-old Peter hiding inside Peter’s lopsided smile, in the way his left ear still sticks out slightly. “Hey, kid.”
Sure, he’s a little out of practice, but casual fucking is like riding a bike as far as Tony’s concerned. Once you get good at it, it never really leaves you.
“It goes like this,” Peter says and from then on it’s easier to follow his four-year-old logic. They’ve built almost half the ship when Steve stands over the play area.
Peter just giggles, blowing bubbles in his juice. He swings his legs off the island, hitting the cabinets with a light thud, looking up at Tony with big, trusting eyes. It’s the same look, Tony realizes with a pang, that 17-year-old Peter gives him all the time. Peter hasn’t cried, or asked for his parents or even asked for May. That last bit, Tony realizes, is something he can’t put off any longer. He pulls out his phone and makes the call.
“You’re going to be fine, Tony,” Steve said, squeezing his hand. “Bruce says the cure is worse than the disease.” It had been a lie, but he let it go, considering the tube down his throat didn’t allow him to talk.
“I know.” He looked down blankly at the efficient plate of crudiete Natasha had managed to assemble within minutes and felt a rush of fondness for her.  The best friends, of course, were the ones that called you on your shit but fed you while doing it.  He was the one who had run away from Steve and his regret was starting to catch up to him. He gave Natasha a quick squeeze and kissed the top of her head with affection. Then, he walked to his room, changed out of his suit and asked FRIDAY to pull one of the faster cars out of the garage. It was time to go to D.C.
, if not for a cease fire between two warring nations going spectacularly wrong. A tense standoff had ended in the worst possible way, with a radioactive bomb headed towards a city of two million. Iron Man had been called in and the bomb disposed of, but not before Tony exposed himself for far too long to the plutonium core.
“I’m not mad that you got hurt,” he says, voice shaking. “I’m mad you didn’t follow orders. You don’t care if you get hurt.”
“God, you’re so fucking tight,” Tony says and snaps his hips into Steve with force that makes his cock jump. “Like that, baby?”
“You seemed OK enough,” Peter says, his eyes still grazing the floor. “Plus, there were a lot of people around.”
“Yeah, we should,” Steve says. Even from across the table he can see the color rise in Steve’s face. “I mean, if you wanted.”
Tony swallows past the lump in his throat. “It’s not really a choice, is it?” Tony says. “It’s not about what you want or what I want. It’s about what Peter would want. We can’t steal his entire life from him. Not when there’s a chance to get it back.”
Bleary eyed, he stumbled to the door. Steve waited in the hallway, looking as wrecked and tired as Tony felt. Tony held out his hand and led Steve inside, instructing FRIDAY to turn on the do not disturb function.
Secretary Ross’ voice catches him by surprise.  Far too well trained to flinch, Steve simply turns his head.
Steve took it, stood and removed the rest of his clothing. He shrugged off his shirt, stepped out of his pants, fully naked before them for the first time. Until now, all his sexual encounters, all three of them, had been quick, furtive attempts under bed sheets and the cover of darkness. Now, he stood up straight, unable to hide, and tried not to blush as Tony gazed up at him, trailing his fingers along the backs of his thigh, placing a kiss in the hollow of his knee.
“I do enjoy it,” Steve mumbled under his breath. It’s just that his enjoyment was more along the lines of an early morning run and listening to jazz records while he made a sensible and nutritious dinner.
He looks at Peter, bent over the desk Steve put together, concentrating on a drawing of some kind, his brow furrowed in a distinctly Peter-like expression.
“Can we have pizza for dinner?” Peter asks. “Maybe one kind that’s just cheese and one with pepperoni?”
“So, you guys haven’t slept together yet?” He turned around at the sound of Natasha’s voice behind him. There was break between speeches, and she’d found him hiding in an empty conference room.
Steve can only nod, his breath coming out in harsh, staccato gasps, his hair plastered with sweat.  Tony grabs him by the hips and does it again, and again, until Steve wraps his own hand around his dick, stroking furiously.
Except it wasn’t home, not really. Their room had started to feel more and more comfortable but Tony was keenly aware of the clock winding down on this little bit of indulgence.  It was for the best, he tried to convince himself, that he only had two nights left to chatter at Steve while they brushed their teeth at adjoining sinks. And only two nights left of watching Steve putter around the room in pajamas, checking the locks and poking at the fire. Neither of them was built for domesticity, but they had settled into a comfortable routine in just a couple of days, and Tony felt a sharp pang of grief at the thought of giving it up.
“Here,” Steve rummages for something inside a paper sack. He pulls out a tattered teddy bear, one that looks awfully familiar, and hands it to Tony.
“That’s it,” Tony says, kissing down his body, rubbing his own erection against Steve’s busy knuckles. “You’re doing so good Steve,” he whispers as Steve’s begins to jerk himself harder and faster, the head of his dick hitting Tony’s stomach with a perfect little sting.
“Do you think it will help him right now? You want me to shove that report in his face? So he can see what was done to him?”
The truth was that all Tony knew about Steve’s past had come from museum exhibits and his father’s papers, an oversight that he was deeply ashamed about now.  He put a hand on Steve’s knee and squeezed it in apology. He left it there until it was time to dress for dinner.
“Pete, we gotta let the adults do some work. Wanna come with me?” Steve holds out his hand, which Peter reluctantly takes.
“Ok,” Tony says, soothing. “Ok.” He tugs at Steve’s leg, till he’s up on one knee and slides his hand between Steve’s body and the bed. He doesn’t wait to be told what to do, or ask. He just cups Steve over his briefs, which are soaked in precome.
“I’m fine,” Steve said with a curt nod. “You were right, it was a bad idea. You can go back to New York with a clear conscience. We’re fine.”
They split down the hall and Tony was left with the sinking realization that he and Steve would be sharing tight quarters for the next few days. His stomach flopped a little at the thought of lying next to him in bed. It was uneasiness, he told himself, not excitement, that made his pulse race a little.
“Medically induced coma, from what Bruce tells me. That’s different. It’s just so my body could heal faster.”
“See you love birds in morning.” Sam let out a little wolf whistle before he disappeared down the hall.
“You scared the shit out of him, Tony,” Steve says, his voice as soft as if he were reading a bedtime story. “You went into defib on the plane. We got you back quickly, but...Peter shouldn’t have to see that.”
“That I have to babysit you here? Yeah it is.  Come on Rogers, off with the jacket.” He let Tony remove his coat.  Unlike Tony, who’d come dressed in one of his expensive suits, Steve had worn dark slacks and a gray button down, the nicest shirt he had in his closet.
“Still, my track record for the past two weeks hasn’t been great, has it? I wasn’t there today and I wasn’t there in Manila.”
Peter cries louder—sharp, hysterical sobs piercing the air—as Tony reaches the bed. He throws his arms around Tony’s neck, clutching him tightly.
“Frankly, I hope he doesn’t remember anything about it,” Tony says now, turning back to Bruce. “Nothing good can come from it.”
“I don’t want to do it.” Tony answers honestly, surprised by the waver in his own voice. “But I don’t think there’s a choice. In the end though, if you say no, we don’t do it.”
“We had to burn them,” he says. “My suit and Steve’s. There was just too much blood. They weren’t going to get clean.”
“Ummmmm yeah,” he says, dive bombing an action figure into the suds and splashing water all over the floor. Some of it gets on Tony’s t-shirt, in his hair, on his face.
Tony scratches a hand across his beard, takes a deep breath. “Is it a uh, stimulation problem? There are videos on the internet that might help.”
It takes another three days before Peter’s back in the compound again. Three days of Tony’s calls going to voice mail and FRIDAY reminding him it’s illegal to stalk a minor. It would make him angry, if it wasn’t breaking his heart.
He doesn’t ask if it feels good yet, knows Steve’s body is sending him so many mixed up signals he’s not sure what he’s feeling. It’s a good sign though, that he relaxes deeper into the mattress, legs falling open slightly.
He’s tempted to lie there, but there are too many intrusive thoughts for him to rest. He untangles himself from Peter’s grip, and sneaks out of the room. He gets FRIDAY to set the Baby Monitor protocol and heads for the lab. There’s not much they can do with the tunnel, but they can give Peter a suit, like Scott’s, so at least he has a fighting chance.
“Hey, I don’t snore.” Tony didn’t even have to feign indignation. Pepper had never once complained about him snoring.
“You gotta stop messing with him, Tony. I don’t know exactly what happened last night, but he was pretty messed up this morning. If you keep pushing, you’re gonna hurt him, and hurt him bad.”
Steve hovers in the doorway as Tony puts Peter down, making sure to tuck the bear securely under his arm.
“That’s not....you don’t have to.” Even in the dim bathroom light, Tony can see the flush spread across his chest.
Tony nods, wondering if picking up Peter’s call a few days ago might have changed any of this. “Anything else I need to know?”
“You’re taking Rhody.” Steve snaps. He keeps his voice clipped and squares his jaw. “That’s an order.”
Tony takes a deep breath and lingers at the door to the gym, clutching a thick accordion file folder. Inside, Steve stands at the far end, the rhythmic
Through some creative skulking, he managed to avoid not just Steve but Sam and Natasha for most of the morning. His luck didn’t last past lunch though, when Sam cornered him in an alcove off the main room.
“Is this your first time here?” she asked. Steve nodded as Tony resumed the slow sweep of his thumb across the back of Steve’s neck.  It was a small touch, but enough to keep Steve grounded.
“Will it bother you if I turn on the TV?” Tony asked instead, his hand already reaching for the remote.
“We’re gonna try again. There are three different frequencies we can use,” Bruce’s voice comes over the intercom but he sounds tense.
“How was it?” he asks, even though he kept tabs on Tony’s mission updates. Tony sits on the edge of couch, his hip brushing Steve’s stomach.
“Looking good, kid” Tony says and Peter beams. As they walk off the floor, Tony falls into step beside Steve, waiting till Peter is out of earshot. “You’re good with him too, you know,” he says.  Steve stares at the floor and tries to forget he owes Tony an apology.
“I don’t want you out there all alone,” Steve says, his voice low and strained, chest still heaving. “I’m worried about you.”
Like a creeper, he stations himself outside the locker room door. Peter practically slams into him as he exits.
“Steve, I’m going to be air support along with about 8 fighter jets,” Tony protests. “I can handle it.”
“You won’t.” Steve moaned a little again as Tony pushed a thigh between them, gave Steve something to rub against. “I know what I’m getting into, Tony.”
He twines his fingers through Steve’s damp hair, pulling him into kiss as Steve moans again and again into Tony’s mouth, his hips snapping erratically as he comes hard inside her. Crying out, he mashes his mouth to Tony’s, eyes squeezed shut tight as if can’t bear to see what’s happened to him. His orgasm spills out of him in long jagged waves, tearing him apart from the inside. It’s never been like this and he wants to rail at Tony for doing this to him, for breaking him so totally apart he’s not sure there’s a way to put everything back together.
“Sometimes you act like you’re the only one with feelings,” she chided him quietly, her initial burst of anger spent. “I don’t know what happened with you two, but you just,” she paused for a second and threw up her hands. “You made him sad. He doesn’t open up to anyone like he does to you. You have to fix this, Tony.  You have to at least talk to him.”
“Tony, I know what’s going on inside that head of yours. Don’t make what happened today about Manila because —”
“Fuck,” Tony hissed. His hands went around Steve’s hips and he rocked against him, nuzzling into the curve of Steve’s neck.  Steve curled their fingers together and let out a soft little moan that made his dick jump.  In his sleepy haze, Tony lingered in the heat between them, physical sensation overwhelming any kind of reason.  He pushed his erection against the soft curve of Steve’s ass, and bit down on his neck, making Steve arch against him. With a curse, Steve took their clasped hands and shoved them down his pants, wrapping them around his own dick.
“It didn’t spark anything for me,” Steve says, looking distraught. He stands across the threshold, t-shirt matted to his skin with old sweat, little bits of boxing tape still on his fingers. “I didn’t look at those pictures and suddenly have it all come flooding back to me.”
“See, that’s not so bad is it?” As her robe parted a little bit more, Steve noticed she was wearing black lace panties, the sight causing his pants to tighten. She placed small kisses along his jaw, behind his ear and Steve caught the light scent of her sandalwood perfume. The smell relaxed him even more and he let his eyes slip shut again.
“You want to sit next to the French attorney general all night? Be my guest.” It was a petty move, changing the place cards around, as if that even had any real meaning. These types of dinners were for mingling and shaking even more hands, but the thought of Steve across the room and away from him all evening agitated him. He was being irrationally possessive, but Tony found he didn’t much care.
Trembling with pleasure, Steve let everything inside him unfurl slowly, relishing the light touch of Tony’s fingertips along his cock as he came down. Kara moved up to kiss him, pushing the taste of his own come into his mouth. It was the dirtiest thing Steve had ever done and he almost cried, not out of shame, but because it felt so good.
“Bruce?” Tony calls, walking through the large steel doors. On the surface, everything looks normal. No smoke billowing out of broken windows, no visible structural damage.
“Don’t worry about me,” Steve says, brushing at her cheek. She laughs it off, but keeps an arm tucked around his waist.
They made quick work of their clothes, discarding jackets and shirts and shoes in a rush till they were moving against each other fully naked for the first time. They had full privacy now, there was no danger of anyone walking in on them, but they still didn’t take their time, accustomed to the rapid pace of their usual liaisons. Steve had him laid out on the bed, head bobbing between his legs when Tony tugged at his hair, a warning to pull off.
“Look, I know I’m just a kid, but it was really hard having a crush on MJ and not saying anything about it to her, you know, because I just ended up acting totally crazy and she was like,
“Can we talk about this later?” Tony says, pouring more juice. “Maybe when we don’t suddenly have a four-year-old juice junkie deal with?
“I’m not telling half the world what happened out there before Steve has a chance to process it himself,” Tony says and Natasha squeezes his hand. “Good,” she says, walking away just as Steve takes his usual seat next to him.
They linger through dinner, though it’s obvious fatigue has sent in for everyone. Steve’s shoulders slump a little too much, and he shifts uncomfortably in his seat again and again. When Tony accidentally catches his eye, Steve turns away quickly, flexing his jaw like he’s swallowing a grimace of pain. No one protests when Steve excuses himself after the last plate has been cleared.
The Tunnel fires up, the noise almost deafening and before he can think anything else, a brief white hot flash of light blinds them all.
“Mmmhmm.” Peter nodded his head, like he understood everything. “But, I mean, it’s really because you like him a lot. It’s cute.”
It fades though when Steve walks in, dressed in crisp gray slacks and one of the soft blue sweaters he always seems to favor. Instead of avoiding Tony out of embarrassment, he scans the room, looking for him. They catch eyes and exchange a quick nod, and Tony’s about to go to him, tell him to take a few more days off, but Ross gets to him first.
“God, you feel so god,” Tony whispers into his ear. “You’re being so good for me, Steve. So very very good.”
There’s no discussion about who will go first, and Tony follows Bruce through the sliding glass doors. The lights in the room have been dimmed considerably and to Tony’s relief, Steve looks a sight better than he expected, with a minimal amount of wires and tubes coming out of him. The right side of his face is still a mess of bruises but cleared of blood and dirt. His mouth quirks up as Tony stands at the foot of his bed.
But that’s not them, that’s never been them, and conversely, Tony would argue, it’s probably the reason they still fight so much. Steve doesn’t say anything, so Tony doesn’t say anything, though he can fee the words, stupid, emotional words, fighting to crawl their way out of his throat.
“I acted like a dick. I know that,” he said. Steve didn’t correct him, just shook his head. “I’m sorry I ran, ok? I just…” he trailed off, unsure of what he’d even come here to say.  He had driven four hours and each second had been filled with the need to ease some of the pain he’d caused. Now that he was here, words were in short supply.  “I don’t want to hurt you,” he said.
“The cleaning staff can do all that,” he says but Steve just shrugs, unable to stand even a little disorder. “He’s fine. Went out like a light.”
“I’m fine, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, like he knows what Tony’s thinking.  “We’re gonna get you out of here.”
Peter shakes his head, tears spilling out of his eyes. He doesn’t resist when Tony hugs him, pulling him in close.
“Want some coffee?” Steve hands him a warm cup, and Tony doesn’t miss the way their fingers overlap for just a little too long.
His underwear is pulled down just enough so that Steve’s erection juts painfully forward. Tony winces at site of his dick, an angry shade of red that looks like it’s been rubbed raw. He has no idea how long Steve tried to force it, attacked the problem like he would anything else, with a determination that’s almost counter productive.
He takes Peter to his room, and settles him into the far end of the bed. “You gotta pee or anything? I don’t want any accidents in my bed.” Tony tucks the blanket up around shoulders. Peter blinks sleepily as Tony pushes back his hair. “You good, kid?”
He put the remote down with an annoyed huff but it was mostly for show. There was no privacy in a bed this small. Even though they both stuck close to their sides, he could already feel the heat of Steve’s body drifting across the bed, the smell of his soap and toothpaste in the air.
He and Steve had arrived at the official UN kick-off breakfast together, only to be pulled apart by diplomats in nicely press suits the minute they’d walked through the door. He’s been standing around talking shop and promising favors for 30 minutes before finding a way to excuse himself.
They’re halfway through the dishes when the door chimes. It’s Bruce and Hope. One look at their faces tell him it isn’t good news. Bruce has always had a shit poker face but it’s the way he pauses in the doorway that Tony realizes he needs to take a seat to hear this.
“How many people have you gone out with since you and Pepper broke up?”  Sam held Tony’s gaze, daring him to look away.
“Fuck, you look so hot Rogers. You should see yourself,” Tony mumbled softly in his ear, kissing down his neck, making him even crazier. “You’re fucking unreal you know that, it’s a shame you keep all this wrapped up so tight.”
Tony scoffs, is about to tell Ross to go fuck himself, when he sees the look on Natasha’s face. It’s clear she’s already conveyed the message.
After all, Tony already knows more than he wants too. What they found in the farmhouse was grotesque and stomach churning. He had expected some kind of Hydra base, perhaps a military installation like they kind they’d seen in Siberia. Instead what they found was an old, abandoned barn, unremarkable from the outside, but outfitted with enough medical grade equipment to function like a lab. In the far corner, there were three long, steel tables outfitted with sturdy, metal restraints and encased in barbed wire.
“Tony,” Steve drew out his name, groaning, not caring anymore what he looked like. It was already too much. Testing his boundaries, Tony reached out a hand across the flat of Steve’s abdomen towards his groin, his fingers brushing pubic hair. He touched the base of Steve’s cock as Kara’s mouth continued to work. Gripping him firmly, Tony stroked him once, twice, three times until Steve cried out, come splashing in Kara’s mouth before she pulled off and let Tony stroke him through the rest of his orgasm, wave after wave of pleasure rolling through him.
This is what Pepper had tried to get him to understand and he had failed her over and over again. He squeezes the back of Peter’s neck, makes himself promise that he won’t make that same mistake again.  “OK,” he says again and squeezes Peter, quick and firm, before releasing him.
He had orgasams before, with women and by himself, but nothing like what was building in the base of his gut.  He made small thrusts into her mouth, felt the tip of his cock hit the back of her throat. Tony stroked his face, tugged lightly at his hair, urging him on.
They don’t officially fuck until later, after a Stark Industries gala that Steve gets dragged to by Pepper. “He’s a big draw and we could use the good will,” she says, flashing her brilliant smile for the cameras.  “Plus, it means less glad-handing for you. It’s win win.” True to her word, Pepper keeps Steve busy all evening, guiding him from group to group so that Tony hardly sees him. Every now and then he catches a pair of broad shoulders wearing a grim expression out of the corner of his eye.  He takes some comfort in how miserable Steve looks, delights a little more when he catches him stifling a yawn.
Tony couches down, takes Peter by the shoulders and smooths back his hair. “You don’t have to worry. Nothing bad is going to happen to you, Peter. If you get lost I’ll come find you.”
Too soon, Steve had pulled away, untangling himself from Tony’s arms. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and wrapped a sheet around his midsection, as if modesty was suddenly an issue.
He doles out instructions, treating this like any other mission, while Tony grips the edge of his chair till his knuckles turn white. The thought of sending even a grown Peter into the tunnel would make his stomach churn. He’s not doing it to a kid whose cheeks are still all baby fat.
Tony takes his free hand, and wraps it around Steve’s. It’s been almost two weeks and the knuckles of both his hands are still red and split.
It would have been easier if Steve objected to Tony covering him like a blanket, but he had merely propped himself up on his elbows and seemed in no hurry to leave the bed.  “It’s nice,” he said almost shyly. “I don’t mind it, Tony.”
“It was cold,” Steve says, his voice low. “And I was,” he frowns, searching his memory. “In the dark maybe? Underground? But it was loud, there were a lot of machines.”
That’s how Steve finds them, resting on the couch as the sun hovers on the horizon, bathing the room in a warm, yellow glow. This is usually Tony’s least favorite time of day, the few moments when day turns into evening always filling him with a deep, unsettling sadness. Tonight though, the golden light drifting through the room catches against the wide array of blond and brown in Steve’s hair, makes his blue eyes a a deep, dark pool.
“I think he tried to tell me,” Tony says finally, picking up their conversation from earlier. He gets up, begins to pace, reliving the moment in his head. “‘
“Steve, with what they put you through. You were held for such a long time. There’s a chance of sexual...”
“You hungry, kiddo?” Tony asks. Peter nods against his chest. He could have the kitchen send something up, but he rips open of a box of macaroni and cheese instead.
Resigned to his fate, Tony flopped down on the bed still in his coat as Steve moved around the room, unpacking. He hung up his suits, and Tony’s too, before kicking lightly at Tony’s legs with his foot.  It had been a long flight on the heels of an even longer day, and despite his reluctance over the sleeping arrangements, he was glad to be stationary for a bit. The fire had warmed the room nicely, and the soft yellow lights made everything feel cozy.  He stared at Steve standing above him, before holding out a hand to be helped up.
Sexual preferences are a unique thing and while Tony has no idea what Steve likes or how he likes it, he’s worked his own dick enough times to know the basic rhythm to these things, that starting slow is better than starting fast, that even a little slickness goes a long way.
Then everything slammed back together, and Tony was gagging for the second time that day. He did his best to get a heave of air into his lungs as his abdomen contracted and convulsed. His vision came back, tears clogging his eyes and distorting the reflective, gold image of the floor beneath him. Tony’s arms shook with a mixture of weakness and chill as the cold surface seeped into his skin.
he would finally be called back into action, finally find Bruce, finally get to see Asgard, and it would be like this. After he’d fucked everything up.
As his breathing slowed and his gag reflex relaxed, Tony glared over his shoulder at the god. Or, he did his best to, anyway. He got the distinct impression that he didn’t succeed, though, as tears, drool, and other liquids dripped from his eyes, nose, and the corners of his mouth.
There was an odd wariness that surrounded the air Doctor Banner breathed, and Steve could never figure out why.
When they stepped off, Bucky looked back towards the man with a raised brow. Steve twitched at the sound of the noise coming to a bar. Everyone’s heads raised and pointed towards them.
Some days, everything seemed alright. Like maybe, just maybe, he could hold on to this and not let it slip away. Other days, most days, he admitted, it felt like grasping at smoke. How did the song go? He couldn’t recall. Tony only remembered enough to know you couldn’t solve a problem like Maria and a bunch of useless euphemism to prove just that point.
But Steve got it, and the man did look familiar now that he thought about it. He could see the headlines flash before his eyes that described the deaths of Howard Stark and his wife, and the picture of a young boy trying to grieve his parents in peace taunting across every news station. Could hear the other soldiers’ outrage in their rantings when they were told that the now young man had put a stop to his father’s company’s weapons manufacturing after being presumed dead for three months. Could feel the pride and admiration for that decision when a Stark bomb came barreling right towards the Howling Commandos.
The realization brought a brief pause and a shutter to wrack his body. Was there anyone on Earth who truly knew him or was everyone susceptible to the charade he’d so firmly practiced and perfected?
And then there was that swelling in Steve’s chest, warm and dizzying and constricting his every breath. Mr. Stark turned to him, and Steve saw a minuscule, barely-there shift in the man’s eyes as he looked at Steve. Blink and you’d miss it.
When the days came where painful, prodding fingers and chilled instruments left hollows in his skin, Steve became a little less interested in a schoolboy’s fantasy. The nights he could hear his mother’s soft crying from the kitchen as death sentence after death sentence built up on the doctors’ lips had knocked a few more of those pegs off that playground block until they dwindled like dying embers.
At the time, there hadn’t been much Steve could gather about the prosthetic on his own, though the second he set it in front of Doctor Banner for an analysis, the man’s eyes lit up. He didn’t hold back in his admiration and astonishment as he and Steve gushed over Mr. Stark’s newest design.
The man shifted from foot to foot, arm crossing in front of him in a V as he stared up at Steve with wide eyes, one hand clasping the wrist of the other. He moved to mimic Steve’s posture, one hand reaching up to rest on the back of his neck. Steve wondered if he’d realized he’d done that, but a moment later, he seemed to, pulling his hand away and letting it land on his thigh with a gentle smack.
In a manner of seconds, in flashes where Steve could taste the heat-slicked kisses, feel smoothened, soft skin beneath his searching hands, hear the vicious laughter, see the beginnings of crow’s feet… smell the cherries. Like a light, guiding him home, Steve was incapable of not following – he doubted there was much of a choice – because he hadn’t been home. Not in years. Not since his mom died.
A wavering thought about needing to pack dawdled in the back of his mind. Tony glanced at the suit again, then tore his eyes away. No, the one under his and Pepper’s bed, the one tucked away safely in a suitcase, that’s the one he’d use. It was archaic. Very old in comparison to the last suit, but it was untouched. Not broken or cracked or so far caved in it cracked his sternum and some of his ribs. So it was perfect.
Letting out a breath, Tony shakes his head and closes his eyes. He takes a few deep swallows of what he hopes is breathable air to regulate his heartbeat and keep him from hyperventilating.
There were a lot of people who associated explosions with the ending of life. Trust him, he used to be one of them. When that bomb landed next to him, the bright, sharp white letters of STARK spelled over its dark surface, he saw the boom and his death before anything could actually happen outside of the slow haze his mind had filtered into. Even after it didn’t kill him, it sure as hell felt like it did.
It was just… it was easier, he admitted. When it came to these things, it was much simpler to call and – if the odds were in his favor – leave a voicemail. That way they could skip the arguing part that, on some – most – days, dominated their relationship.
Jarvis led an entranced Tony through the displays explaining each memento to the best of his memory. Eyes as wide as an owl, mouth slacked in awe, Tony had fired off question after question to Jarvis. Was that really Captain America’s motorcycle? Did these trinkets belong to the actual Commandos?
“If we cannot get the Avengers,” Thor continued, and Tony blinked at them, keeping his face impassive, “then I would be overjoyed to have the venerable Man of Iron by my side once again.” Thor gave Tony a small smile that Tony couldn’t find it in himself to return. Times for smiling were rare these days. Precious. They weren’t something to be given out casually. Not for something like this. “I believe your skills are what will truly tip the scales in our favor. Heimdall can open the portal for you within the hour.”
He and machines had never gotten along so well. His mom always used to joke that he could break anything running on electricity with a single, dour look. It was frustrating, the way these things never seemed to be able to work right, but every time he tried to make them work at all, bend their will to his own, they snapped. Or he may have snapped them. Rubbing circles into his temple with his fingers, Steve sighed. He couldn’t tell anymore.
Iron Man simply wasn’t needed anymore. Just as she said. There was no more hero-ing to be done, no more mysteries to be solved. That was all buried beneath that thick pile of dust collecting on the edges of the case down in his workshop. On the smooth, curved surface of the shield sitting in a compound he should have closed down and sold off years ago.
In the darkened recesses of his brain where someone has oh so inconveniently switched off the lights, Tony musters enough clarity to connect this feeling to the ones usually following exhaustion induced black-outs caused by five-day lab bingers – his longest being eight days. A feat never reached again after those Ritalin, Adderall, and caffeine induced years of college study at MIT. These black-outs (unfortunately, if you ask him) always tended to last for about fourteen hours in spite of the six-hour average a normal adult gets in the United States.
“Steve,” he said, and he hoped his voice didn’t come out as breathless as it sounded to his own ears. “Steve Rogers.” As he said his name, Steve saw the reel begin. What could be an entire lifetime flashed before his eyes. He wanted to laugh; ever the hopeful romantic, his mom and Bucky had always said, but there was a realness to this strong pull tugging him towards the man a few meager feet in front of him. Could see the flashes of a life he didn’t have but longed for more than anything.
Steve felt his gaze like a physical branding, leaving his skin hot and twitchy; it was like the caress of a breathy touch from calloused fingertips, and Steve had the wild thought of asking the man if he played violin or guitar. He could see the way the skin around his boney fingertips was raised and hardened at the ends, and Steve wondered what caused those callouses. The question seemed important for no other reason than he was desperate to know.
Bruce Banner was a quiet man, and their first few interactions left Steve with the impression of a hard-pressed man who wasn’t in the habit of making co-workers into friends. He’d been reserved, and the people he worked with were adamant in painting him in a no-nonsense light when Steve had first asked about him. None of the other S.I. scientists seemed to have any desire to be in the same lab as the man, much less give him the benefit of conversation.
In this lighting, she was beautiful. Pepper was always beautiful, but right here? Right now? She was especially so, so Tony let his eyes roam over her, tracing her outline, memorizing her features like a yellow 42 pencil scrit-scratching on the surface of a piece of paper, yellowed with age. Fitting in one image right next to another and then another to save as much paper as humanly possible.
The two looked at each other, and something nasty curled deep in Tony’s gut. It really had been a long time since he’d seen them. Any of them.
Clearing his throat, he looked up at the man despite the half a foot Steve had on him. “Sorry,” he murmured, voice quiet in the cool air around them.
Letting out a breath, Tony opened his mouth, raising his shoulders in another shrug, but this one was half-hearted at best. He had no idea how to tell her he wasn’t sure there was a difference between the two anymore. Maybe there never had been.
Thor looked at Tony, and Tony could see the bone-weariness that had settled itself into the once jovial features. Thor looked grim. He hated how much he could relate.
“And what’s your name, soldier?” he asked, voice going soft, quieting like it was only the two of them in the room.
It seems the universe plucked Eden’s Apple and handed it to him because he’s officially in hell. The one and only Capsicle, this century’s Benedict Arnold, breathes a steady rise and fall a few feet from Tony’s shoes. Shallow, but steady.
His eyes wandered over to the Iron Man suit, and Tony wished he could say he hesitated even the slightest before clicking the green “Accept” button.
Around him, Steve heard the whirring of the elevator come to a stall. It slowed and came to a stop. The light above the doors blinked once, twice above the red numbers of twenty-three. The doors opened, and both Bucky and the man looked towards them. Choruses of amused chatter reached Steve’s ears, and Bucky began to step out. Steve followed, glancing at the man while he passed. Those impossibly large eyes beamed up at him. Steve felt like he had to be beaming back like an absolute loon.
Lifting his head, unsure of what he plans to do yet – rolling over to sleep some more sounds just about as good as getting up to make the trek for the tap water from the bathroom sink and swallowing an aspirin (or five) to beat the throbbing starting at his temples – it finally clicks, like the right gear latching into place at last, that something is well and truly off.
“Am I dreaming?” Tony asked, aware that that possibility was more than a little plausible. He raised his hands to rub at his eyes.
Taking a gasping, shuddering breath, Tony yanks himself as far from those thoughts as he can. Before the dust coats everything and rattling is replaced by yelling in a language he can’t understand and he’s taken over by a spelunkers’ darkness before the burning, bright heat of dunes and sand.
“It wasn’t a humanitarian mission, Steve, she wanted you to back up their military so she could depose the country’s president,” Tony grumbled.
“Nothing you need to worry about,” Peter says, still not meeting his eyes. “I had it handled. I’m fine, aren’t I?”
Rain had been a scarce novelty in the backlogs of the Afghani desert, and it had been one of those things Steve had missed most about home. But the calming static kept being punctured by random bursts of sharp noise that translated into something all-too familiar and recent in his memories. Each piercing screech resonated through his ear canals, setting Steve more and more on edge as it began to fill his head with a frayed and worn fuzz that numbed everything in its war path.
Sighing, Tony slumped back against the wall of the elevator. He let his chin hit his chest, shivering at the chill of metal seeped into his back. Pepper was right, of course. She always was. He really had thought that that battle had been his last; Tony didn’t think he’d put the suit on again besides a quick joy-ride that didn’t bring as much joy as it once had and maybe one or two quick getaways from things like galas and board meetings.
By the time he was done, Tony stood next to their bed staring across the large expanse of room. He had no reason to make a mess of it, especially knowing how much Pepper worked – or hired people to work – to keep it so organized. So tidy.
“Barnes,” Mr. Stark purred, turning to face the room. “Mr. Barnes here is going to be our newest errand boy!” He clapped his hands like an excited child, and there was a hum of amused chuckles around the room. Steve thought he saw a fist pump in the air from a man sitting in the back of the room. Worry filled him as Steve thought of Bucky’s arm, but before he could do anything, Mr. Stark said, “Sorry, Gerry. You’re gonna have to stay on the team and help with the heavy lifting. Most of it, actually; don’t think I’ve forgotten what you said to me on your first day because that’s never going to happen. Ever. Mr. Barnes!” he snapped. “I know you could bench press our wonderful Gerry, but I need you to make him do most of the work, capisce? So, even though it’s your first day, I’m promoting you to Senior Errand Boy. Congratulations! But, you are still an errand boy, Columbia.”
Bucky shifted again, and Steve shot him a reproachful look. A warning he knew Bucky wouldn’t listen to. But, well, insanity and all that. A bored Bucky had never been good, and the returning mischievous smirk he got back was evidence enough that Steve should start worrying right about now.
“Listen, Fury 2.0, the Avengers? They’re no more. Not a thing. Got it?” he snapped. “So that’ll be a big, fat no-can-do from mere Earthlings the likes of us.”
Alive. There’s someone else here, and they’re alive. He lets out a breath and feels a sag in his limbs.
His mind flashed back to the crouched posture and inability to walk after Bucky had first spoken to Natasha. Now the two were inseparable – Bucky was even starting to look at rings. But Bucky had this way about him, and part of Steve thought it a sparse unfair. Bucky could make friends with anyone at any time. He was the life of the party; an expert on playing his cards to the exact point that would keep them out of just enough trouble.
Falling to his forearms, biceps trembling with his gasps, Tony gulps air into his lungs, wide eyes wildly darting left and right over the ground. What
Reaching back behind him, he held onto the bar with both hands and thought his grip might be tight enough to mold his very handprint into the hollowed-out metal. His ma would’ve rolled her eyes at that, and Steve felt the familiar tick of a bittersweet smile at the corners of his mouth. She’d been right; you wore an expression for a long enough time, and it had a tendency to get stuck there.
“But you’re needed here, too, Tony,” she said, a frown staining her features. “I can’t be the only one working to clean up your messes. Do you know the mess you dumped on me since you broke apart your team in front of God and everyone? And you haven’t helped me with it. Not once. All you do is hide away in your lab.”
Like a magnet being drawn north, though, Tony’s eyes found the back of her head. For a moment, he let himself admire the fiery red wisps of hair shimmering in the lowlight of what was once the Avengers’ common room.
Tony’s limbs are frustratingly difficult to control despite the creeping encompassment of consciousness as he steadily begins taking more shallow breaths, his heart rate increasing in its staccato rhythm. If Tony’s honest with himself, all he really wants to do right now – despite the heaviness he knows is pressing underneath his eyes, reminding him that over-sleeping will only serve to give him yet another migraine and increase his fatigue (and therefore his already constant irritability) for the day – is let the allure of sleep pull him back beneath crashing waves and onto the lofty sand-beds of unconsciousness. Sleeping may be a useless waste of time, but it’s an indulgence he rarely gets to enjoy.
He tensed as his gaze travelled downward, catching on what looked like a sword that was the same height as him poking through what must have been the portal. Tony narrowed his eyes, gripping the briefcase even tighter. Couldn’t back out now, that much he knew. When it came down to it, god vs. mortal, not even he was deluded enough to think he could win despite what Pepper, the press, and certain former teammates would say.
His vision finds its way back to the… thing in his chest, and Tony takes the unconstrained seizing of his muscles as a personal offense. Taking a jagged breath, heaving it past the blockage in his throat, he firmly reaches his other hand towards his chest. His fingers dig in, clawing at the suit frantically. Tony watches the plunge of his nails as they desperately dig into the fabric to get the clothes off.
Dark clouds crowded the New York skyline, bouncing and fumbling around one another worse than the throngs of people on the brimming sidewalks. There was inevitability in the air, and sure enough, the slow pattering of water droplets on the umbrella above Steve proved the weatherman on ABC 7 right. A terse battle waged between the rain marking its steady march towards a full-blown storm and the echoing sounds of loud-mouthed New Yorkers with their background symphony of blaring horns.
When Tony looked back, the gatekeeper was staring at him in a way that gave him the sense that this man knew exactly what he was thinking. Exactly what he was feeling. Tony had never felt more exposed, more transparent in his life. So he forced his thoughts away, tucking his unsavory emotions in that box where he kept all of them these days in lieu of a gratifying apathy and took a firm step forward.
Lord knew Steve didn’t have the guts to do that himself. There were thirty-eight missed calls contained in a little red bubble on his phone from a litany of doctors, pharmacists, and therapists reminding him to make appointments and pick up medications he couldn’t afford and that Bucky knew nothing about.
the doctor’s popping on their latex gloves, the scalpels and lancets and drill bits and all the other surgical tools rattling in that metallic tray. He can feel the sharp noises bounce around his skull like a pinball. There’s still the taste of the Propofol exuding from its home of a triangular mask lingering in a thick layer over his tongue. And he knows,
He watched with dubious scrutiny as Thor nodded, bobbing up and down worse than a bobblehead on a dashboard. “Aye. There have been odd happenings within the castle grounds. We have recently discovered that an ancient being seems to have taken to haunting us. At the moment, we are unsure of their species, whom they are, or why they are here, but this being is becoming increasingly dangerous. I worry it will go beyond castle walls and endanger the rest of my people. After careful thought and consideration, Bruce and I decided it best if this being be met with the full force of the Avengers so we can rid it from my homeland.”
He went to the appointments, and the clockwork began. They’d ask what’s wrong, and he’d give them the abridged version. Then came more questions and the poking of wounds as if talking, prodding, investigating the dark places in his soul were a viable option for his healing. They’d make suggestions on how to cope with things they knew nothing about – at least from firsthand experience – like take a walk in the park at least once a day. Tony snorted. As if not staring at the birds and bees for long enough was the cause of all his ailments. Sometimes, when they really had no idea what to do with him, they’d suggest drugs.
As dying moments went, quickly losing oxygen out beyond the reaches of the human race where people surmounted to theories of a God and His afterlife, Tony doubted any would be more derogating.
Shame lingered on the tip of his tongue, and he found he had forgotten the man’s name again after their brief Facebook rendezvous. What was worse was knowing that his flailing desperation had been so etched into every crevice of his life that a man he no longer spoke to had seen him struggling a mile away. But as much as Steve hated taking handouts, the man hadn’t been wrong.
Before his mind could sanction anything off, Pepper was looking up, eyes catching his in the dim lighting, and she smiled. Tony almost changed his mind then and there because it was a smile that was so content and open and not one that he got to see a whole lot of anymore. Like some game of “Where’s Waldo?”, Tony always felt like he was working, searching, for that smile. And here it was, being given so freely, and he couldn’t help the swell of something warm expanding in his chest.
He moved farther onto the roof, looking at the way the moonlit clouds reflected so brightly on the ground. Glancing back at the rusted door, Tony took a deep breath. It felt almost momentous to go through with this plan. There was an anticipation in the air, and for what, he didn’t know.
Sometimes, he could still smell the fine dirt coating the insides of his nostrils and the outside of his skin. So thick, they were like a clay casing, trapping his body in a mold of what it once was. Or maybe it had been an extra layer of armor. A useless armor against the gut-wrenching scent of burning skin and the sight of charred flesh on men who were still alive, not yet close enough to the verge of death to make Steve believe God had the capability of having a single merciful thought. Not anymore.
Steve’s hands began to drift a gentle current away from guns and grenades and medical bills and insurmountable debt, and toward pencils, paints, and pastels. His fingers started to itch, again, in an incurable way.
The question was a pompous and rude one that would have set Steve on edge any other time, but the way the man said it, like he was genuinely curious, made Steve dart another intrigued look toward him.
The corners of Mr. Stark’s eyes crinkled a fraction more, and Steve realized he’d been staring. Opening his mouth to say something, he muted himself in an instant as Mr. Stark ducked beneath the umbrella and came around the table to sit. He shrugged off his oversized coat, settling it on the back of the black rattan chair across from Steve. Pulling it out, he took a seat, his coat trailing behind him as he scooted closer until their knees were brushing together.
Out of everything in his life, Tony had never thought it would be his lab that would become the thing that became practically unfamiliar.
Rancid bile rises in his throat again, and Tony knows he’s going to puke. Coughing, his stomach convulses, squeezing his esophagus, lurching and abetting in the rise of stomach acid. A small dribble escapes his mouth, and Tony lets out a high pitched keen as his stomach continues to cramp up. Nothing else comes up; he can’t remember the last time he’s eaten.
It was Thor who broke his stupor first, making Tony swivel his head towards the god. “If we cannot get the Avengers,” Thor trailed off with a tone of remorse, not quite reaching Tony’s eyes as if he knew Tony blamed him and agreed with this assessment. Tony pursed his lips, a guilt so familiar but one he knew he goddamn didn’t deserve, not this time, curling in his stomach. But it wasn’t as if he really blamed Thor. He knew whose fault all this was as much as he liked to rattle off names and point fingers.
Steve’s eyes began to roam over the man, curiosity spiking in his gut even though it still hadn’t quite caught up to them yet. His nose was a mere inch away from making direct contact with the screen, and a rectangular, white reflection shone in the curve of his large, rounded glasses. Brown eyes shimmered like citrines, wild and excited beneath the frames lining them. There was a wildness in the twists of the man’s dark hair that Steve would’ve thought black had the lights not tinged the ends an earthen brown.
pushing your limits. You have approximately thirty second to wow me or I hang up and block you for the rest of eternity.” Another look. Tony raised his brows. “Clock’s ‘a tickin’, boys.”
“Thank you,” Thor said, his voice sounding solemn in Tony’s ringing ears. “Heimdall will open the gate in an hour’s time on the roof of Avenger’s tower.”
Survivor, he thought. Like he had been voted off the island by his teammates and was now going back to face them as a part of the jury. Except by some twisted turn of events, they were the jury and he was the one being judged.
The shining metal begins to dim, and Tony pulls himself from his stupor. Black streaks trail after his fingers as they loop the arc reactor. When Tony pulls his hand away, he watches the black stretch like gum between his fingers and the reactor.
He barely noticed a change in the ambiance behind him and sighed, walking away. It seemed like everything these days was wrong and useless. His very own safe haven, the thing that used to be so bright and full of optimism and creativity, was now a shadow of what it used to be. Besides Peter’s new suit, there was nothing in that lab worth anything.
Jerking back, the last gear locks into place. Tony clamps a hand around the protruding cylinder, an ever-widening gaze staring at the arc reactor. His fingers convulse for a moment, clenching and unclenching around the material as he stares. Thoughts held down moments ago swirl in his brain like a binary star system, moving too fast to get one in a steady grip until
Shifting his hands behind him and letting them take the brunt of his weight, Tony tilts his head to the sky. As expected, the slight change in angle warms his face in a pleasant way.
“So,” Bucky spoke up as he leaned around Steve’s own bulk to look at the man. “Who are you?” There was an odd undercurrent to his words that came about when Bucky sensed Steve liked the fella he was talking to. It was a nightmare he kept looking back on to see where he’d made the wrong turn that made him so transparent to Bucky’s eyes.
the hinting at red and white stripes on the person’s partially hidden abdomen, and his eyes continue to trail upward until they come to an abrupt halt beneath a broad set of muscular shoulders expanding and contracting beneath solid, navy blue fabric.
The waitress came back over, giving Mr. Stark a bright smile. Turning from Steve, he took his hand away and leaned back. He grinned up at her. “Duo Caffe Ristretto,” he said with a perfect accent, lifting two fingers off the tabletop where the hand at his mouth had spread itself out. “Grazie.” Steve watched, entranced. His fingertips were stained an inky black that Ombréd as they dripped toward his palms instead of the clean nails painted with neat, deliberate strokes Steve remembered from months ago. If he looked close enough, he could make out the scraped off remnants that, to him, were akin to an archeologist's artifact.
He thought he could make out the soft and smooth sound of a voice that made him think of melting marshmallows and oozing caramels and sitting close to the crackling of a burning fire. It made him think of happiness in a distant longing sort of way, and Tony couldn’t think of why.
He glanced back to his right. Bucky had made some comment under his breath a moment ago about the man’s choice of attire; he’d added on some tacky line about “kids these days,” and “getting old and going downhill.” Steve smiled and rolled his eyes. The man couldn’t be younger than twenty, and he and Bucky were twenty-five.
He realized, of course, that there was a certain difficulty in getting help from someone who could never truly understand what it was like to fly a bomb into outer space and slowly drift out of existence. Or witness the future deaths of everyone he’d come to know. Or be betrayed by the one person he thought maybe he could finally trust with who Tony Stark really was. Warts and God fucking all. So he’d instantly waved the idea off with a chuckle and a quirk of his lips.
Shined amber, a smear in the fog of his mind, flashed behind Steve’s eyes. Like a balm, instantaneous and cool against seething burns, his muscles sank back into gravity. The traffic faded towards that melodic hum he’d known long before the sounds of gunshots and explosions conquered his every memory, the chirp of passersby on every upward note, and it all began to dim behind a curtain of rain.
He watched as she took a step forward. “I wouldn’t know,” she told him, and this time it was her tone that sounded pleading. “I wouldn’t know because you won’t come out of your lab, you won’t talk to me, you won’t talk to
He couldn’t remember any of them. The dreams. What Tony did know, however, was that they left him raw and sick when he managed to shake himself awake. Left him with a single face always floating in his retina like a burning afterimage in an old television.
Bruce pushed forward closer to the screen, and Tony barely held back an eyeroll at the matching, gawking expression. “What do you mean?”
He watched the scenes in his head the way a kid would a stick figure flipbook, and he wondered how he could make it a reality. Each scene, each drawing, singular and captivating, combining to create this entire story of Them. Of what could be.
Frantically, Tony works his way to his feet. He growls as his arms shake when they take his weight, and he tries to lock them into submission as he shoves himself up. A wooziness overcomes him as he makes it upright and straightens out. And then he’s pitching forward and falling back to the ground. He tries again. Tony’s not sure how long this heat will last, but it’s probably the only thing keeping the tar melted enough for him to move. He has no desire to become La Brea’s next exhibit.
