“You disapprove?” Hammer asked with a scandalized air from his seat at the table, looking up from his bite of cheese.
Bucky sighed, listening to Steve move about in the washroom. No doubt scrubbing away all evidence of his slip the night before.
Possibly it made him an asshole but Bucky was privately very pleased that nature wasn’t going to let Stefen burry all his sins. Not forever.
“Because I might have taken a twenty year vacation to the land of dull and fasting, but I was building boats when I was Sara’s age. It’s in the blood. But I suppose you think I have to prove myself?”
Bucky glanced around at the others and waved them over as well. When they’d all gathered around him he gestured for them to sit.
“Awe that’s really not fair though is it darling?” Bucky pouted, a familiar gleam of mischief in his eye. Steve should know, he’d watched him use it on women enough. Virginia had long ago proven to be one of the rare immune but that just seemed to encourage him. “There you stand looking gorgeous and so very not a grandmother, and here I’ve come back for you. Whose gonna soothe my broken heart?”
“They arrested him in Munich.” Stefen answered, voice pitched equally low. “By the time we heard they’d already transferred him to Dachau. I’ve asked after him but I have to be discreet. There hasn’t been a Deurr scheduled for execution.”
At night with the sounds of the city at his back he would go over the letters, imagining Stark and the children as he’d described them, and for the first time in years he wished he’d had a sketch book.That night like many others he fell asleep to the sound of Stark’s voice in his head, describing his attempt to teach Sara her letters and declaring the child stubborn in the way of all Rogers.
On the bed Péter released the breath he’d been holding in a whoosh and sagged. Tony turned toward the crates and told the others it was safe to come out. He had barely managed to get the words out before the tops of crates were flying open and Ian, Sara and James popped out like springed toys.
Stefen for his part let the admiral’s gaze search him, meeting his stare with an even one of his own. A change had come over the captain from the moment they had stepped off The Warbird and onto the airstrip on the Mainland. He was all soldier now, and the aura of command he exuded kept Tony on edge. He and Pike were virtually creating electricity between them and Tony kept having to fight back the urge to straighten his spine and check to see if his hair was still in place.
It was bad. Very bad, and Péter didn't want to listen when Bucky told him and Natacha to go to bed, but then Natacha told him they would if Bucky agreed to as well, and she begged Péter silently with her eyes to agree. Péter could see how exhausted his uncle was, and he knew Bucky wasn't going to get any rest unless he was forced into it.
Well, Tony wasn't about to sit on his ass now and let Stefen hang himself around his morals. The Captain wasn’t going to sink with Austria, god damn it, and they were all going to get the hell out of here
Why on earth should he be so miffed at such a simple request? She wondered, feeling a bit peevish herself. She understood that Stark was not a servant, and not a nanny either, but frankly she did not know how the captain expected anyone to understand just what Stark’s role in his household was supposed to be.
They’d loaded the car as quickly as possible and Harold had rushed them back to the villa, where Tony and Péter set up shop in his workshop. Pepper met them in the hall and Tony sent her off to begin heating water after inquiring after the captain’s health. He was still breathing. But Tony could tell by the look in the woman’s eyes she didn’t hold out hope that it would be for much longer.
“I don’t feel like discussing this again. You know why I have to fight and you know as well as I that the children need you.” Stefen groused, prowling back and forth like an animal in a cage. Stefen had closed off, Tony could see it in every line of his posture and hear it in his tone. The captain was in no mood to hear any more and so he wouldn’t no matter how much breath Tony wasted.
Chest clenching Tony leaned over to cup Stefen’s cheek in order to keep his mouth where he wanted it, whispering, “Thank god for that.”
"Tony is it true?" Maria asked eagerly almost as soon as he walked through the door. "Natacha says there are children downstairs! Are they really professional singers?"
Tony drew up short. There was something about the calm way that Niklas was looking at him, about the sadness clinging to him that he could not seem to bury. It made something heavy sink to the bottom of Tony’s stomach.
“I need to go into town tomorrow and pick up some items. Fabric and such. If Harold and I can get the car run-” but Hammer didn’t let him finish.
"But you’ll stay here of course.” Pepper declared, approaching both boys to wrap them in a protective embrace. There was a fierceness in her eyes as she spoke, her gaze locked not on the boys themselves but Stefen, daring him to challenge her. “You can work for the captain. Or if you prefer, you can find jobs elsewhere. Both of you are strong boys, and there will be many jobs to fill. I’m sure it’s what your parents would want. Isn’t that right Captain?”
"Yeah, I guess so," Dad said with a heavy sigh. "I've made sure the range on the drones down there is long enough to target the competition site, so… we'll just have to make sure that there's enough security inside the building."
"Goddamnit, baby, just open me up already!" Tony begged. He was gripping the sheets so tightly with his clenched hands that pain shot through his knuckles. "Please, Steve, I need you inside me!"
“So then, what.  We’re just gonna leave him there?” Peter cut in.  “Dad, you know Steve didn't mean to flip out like he did, it was an accident!  He didn't mean it!”
"We're hoping there'll be enough information here that we'll be able to finally take down HYDRA completely," Papa said. "And once that's done, then hopefully things will turn around for us."
"It will then have the look and feel of a Captain America suit," finished JARVIS. "Very clever, sir."
"I'm pretty sure I don't want to know," Pepper said with wide eyes. "I'll just be waiting for your call."
"Barton?" Tony said as Clint's face appeared on his monitor, looking as grumpy as ever. "Tell me you've got good news?"
At the moment Peter couldn't tell what was worse: the fact that his entire family was out there being forced to fight against a bunch of Chitauri-enhanced suits, or the fact that he was essentially stuck inside an impenetrable box, unable to help them.
"Steve." Steve jumped as someone called out his name from somewhere, possibly from behind him, though he couldn't be sure. He couldn't be sure about anything anymore. Not after the stunning defeat they had just suffered.
"Try and sleep now, little guy, okay?" said Papa as he tucked Peter's blankets over his shoulder and kissed his head. "We can talk more about what you'll need for the dance tomorrow."
, but Tony caught his underlying intent anyway. "I have some very fond memories of that place, sweetheart, and I was just thinking—"
"Peter's fine, sweetheart," Steve assured him. "He's just… sleeping, like he was when we got here. Dr Cho checked him out a few minutes ago, and she said his lungs are clear and his ribs are healing just like she expected them to."
But he also knew that he couldn't allow Tony to blame himself for something so completely out of his control, no matter how badly he wanted to.
“Ahh…” Tony trails off, mumbling under his breath again.  “Yeah.  Um… if my theory is correct, I’m thinking that when we stepped through that window, we might’ve entered another dimension.”
Spooning in another mouthful of pudding, Peter briefly closed his eyes. Dad's phone call that morning had rattled him a lot more than he'd wanted to let on, and he knew he wouldn't be able to really relax again until he and Steve showed up later that evening. He just had to make sure that they were gonna be okay.
"Well, nothing like reliving your own past while trying to inspire your future, yeah?" Tony said, tilting his head. "But—"
"That's because Uncle Bucky volunteered for it, Pete," Tony cut in. "There's no way I'd force it on him, you know that. And he can still change his mind if he wants to, but for right now he's volunteered. And he's an adult, so he's allowed to do that."
"That's affirmative," said Bucky, interspersed with rounds from his custom-made machine gun. "And Сэм said he'd treat."
"We're gonna be taking a break for a while once we get back. About six weeks, like we did last summer," he said instead. "So if you guys want to make some plans, then now would be the time."
"I knew I was here, now," Steve said. "I knew I was married to Tony, and that we were part of the Avengers. But then it was Peggy on the radio, just like she was in 1944, but somehow she knew about Tony and Peter too. She kept telling me that it would be okay, that they would understand what I was about to do, and I just—" He broke off, tapping the table with his palm. "None of it made any sense!"
A short pause followed, one in which Tony could just imagine the worry wrinkle forming between Steve's eyebrows.
Something about the tone of Peter's voice caused Tony's blood to run cold, and he gulped, brushing Peter's matted curls off his forehead.
“Pete…” Tony said, rolling his shoulders, which were rock-hard with tension.  It was on the tip of his tongue to tell Peter no, that he was too young to get involved with all of the horribleness that was HYDRA.
And also one of the most rewarding.  It had been so long that Tony had pitched anything to anyone outside of the military that he’d almost forgotten how much of a rush it was to actually see the skepticism seeping from the eyes of his audience, watch as their faces transformed from their “you're outta your fucking mind” expressions to the more work-withable “hmm, that actually sounds kinda interesting.”
"Yeah. I'm on the A-shift, which briefs at 0600 every morning," Steve said. "B-shift starts at 1200, the C-shift at 1800, and then the D-shift at 2400. We're up there flying patrols around the clock."
“So, Peter, I have something very important that I need to ask you,” Steve said once they had all received their dessert orders.  He swallowed hard, trying to get his thudding heart under control as Peter looked up at him with his huge, innocent eyes that were so much like his father’s, waiting patiently.
He had even sucked it up and asked Bucky for some advice a few days ago. Thankfully, Bucky had picked up on Steve's nervousness and kept his needling to a minimum, answering Steve's questions with a mostly-straight face and even offering to pick him up some necessary supplies. Steve had thanked him but declined the offer, because really, if he wasn't ready to buy lube and condoms by himself then he probably wasn't ready to have sex. But then, just the previous morning he'd returned from his run to find a small paper sack sitting on the floor outside the door to his room. Apparently Bucky was getting just as impatient for Steve to finally have sex as Steve was.
Pocketing his phone, Peter zipped up his jacket and headed down the hallway, remembering to grab his sunglasses from his backpack just before he reached the doors.  It was bright outside, the first sunny day Manhattan had seen in what seemed like forever, and even though spring was still a few weeks away, at least with the sunshine it wasn’t quite as dreary.
"Why's it always gotta be him?" Tony lamented as Steve removed the comm piece from his ear. "It's almost like he does it on purpose!"
"Who're you?" Peter shrieked as he took one step back and nearly tripped over a gravestone, almost crumbled into ruin. His heart leapt into his throat as he read the name etched into the stone, the grave so overrun with weeds and tall grasses that he felt like they were suffocating him.
"Captain. You guys made pretty good time getting here," Hill said. Her eyebrows knitted together as she noticed Thor standing next to Bucky. "I don't remember you being on the guest list."
"Yeah, hon, I can give it a try," Tony said softly. "But it's anyone's guess if he'll actually give me an answer. He seems to enjoy the whole 'all-knowing' part of his job a bit too much, if you know what I mean."
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered, his own eyes so filled with tears he could barely see. He carefully cupped Steve's cheek, his heart giving a painful lurch when Steve leaned his head against it. "It's okay, I can make you a new one, yeah? I'll make you a thousand new rings if it means that you'll be back home with me. With
The flight time finished and double-checked, Peter climbed down to the very edge of the rock line and got to work on the repulsors, securing them to his feet and left hand and making one final check of his flight program before stashing his phone into his belt and attaching the fourth repulsor to his right hand. Then he looked out across the fog-drenched water, sucking in a deep, shaky breath.
"Good day, Captain Rogers," said Chief Stacy, offering Steve his hand as he glanced over at Bucky, who gave him a brief but polite nod. "And… Uncle James, I believe?"
"Well," she said quietly. "Unfortunately, names are something we inherit rather than create on our own, right?"
"Whoops," Tony said as he came to a halt in midair, followed by the crash of the final target as it smashed to the ground, taken out by Sam. "Sorry 'bout that, Nat."
"At minimum," answered Bruce. "And that'll just be to stabilise it enough so we don't lose anything in the transfer. The data itself will still be encrypted. This is some pretty high-tech stuff here, and I'm assuming we want as much as we can get our hands on."
And besides all that, he couldn't even tell Ned how he'd managed to catch Gwen's computer before it hit the floor, because no one except their Avengers family, Dr Cho, and Director Fury knew the truth about Peter's enhancements.
"My dad has a few friends at the Bureau," Gwen said, her face falling a second later. "And also because there's circumstantial evidence that the Spider-Man had contact with Toomes shortly before he was arrested, so… as soon as my dad heard about that he pounced on it."
"He's been asleep for awhile now, so I'm sure he'll be starving soon enough," said Tony. "As soon as Bruce gives us the okay we'll get him out, yeah?"
"Oh, sure," said Steve. "And that's why you're always running on fumes when you turn in your aircraft, right? 'Cause you're just having so much fun up there, behavin'?"
As he steps underneath the grand entrance gates and begins the walk across the quad towards the Athletics building, Steve can’t help but feel a sharp pang of nostalgia.  The four years he spent at Camp LeHigh University were by far the happiest time of his life, and to contrast how on top of the world he was then, when he was the shining star on a top-ranked swim team and an all-around BMOC to how he is now, an injured, washed-up has-been who can barely pay his bills is almost as painful as the ongoing throb in his shoulder.
"Yeah, you do seem like you're okay," Tony said as he tilted his head, pressing a slow kiss to Steve's neck. "I think this trip's been pretty good for you."
And now that he had, he’d found that he often couldn't get enough.  He and Tony had spent hours making out before they ever had sex, and even now, spending most of his nights with Tony in his bed, Steve found that he still loved the sweet intimacy of kissing his beloved.
Coulson paused, and Steve got the sense that this time he really was a little taken aback. Many people made the mistake of thinking that he and Bucky were just two dull witted soldiers, only good for shooting their way through things. When would these people get it through their heads that it took brains to lead men through a war zone and get them home?
“Come again?” Tony asked, affronted, and Bucky laughed and laughed. Steve wanted to dunk his head underwater and take a deep breath.
He was filling out some in the chest too.  Though Tony’s mathematical eye summarized he would likely always be longer and leaner than Stefen, Péter was growing into quite a handsome young man.
“Did they really arrest the Klein’s?” Natacha asked, sounding subdued and on the couch beside her, Frau Hogan paused her sewing, eyes falling sympathetically on Cameron’s back before she answered.
Tony and Péter went to find Harold so that he could drive them into the city. They found Pepper first, and whom they were both surprised to learn had planned an excursion of her own to the kindlmarts for the afternoon.
“I don’t think there are words enough to describe you Tony.” he answered, voice cracking with emotion. “You’re a good man, and I want your help. I
“Cap?” Stark was watching him, that eyebrow of his arched in question. He had quite an expressive face, their monk.
“Shut up!” Tony hissed, clenching his teeth and thankfully the voices went still. He didn’t have time for this. He wasn’t about to lose either Ian or James. Not to illness, not to his own stupidity, not to the damn Reich, not to anything!
The meeting was clearly over as Herr Hoch wilted and Admiral Erhard stood with a resigned grimace. He thanked Tony for making the trip out (as if he’d had a choice in the matter) and Tony assured him that he’d keep them and their efforts in his prayers.
. This was not the first riot Tony had lived through. This wasn’t like him. He hadn’t reacted when Steve picked up Sara. Just Maria.
Father still didn’t move, his gaze shifting form something black and fathomless to smooth and expressionless, every inch the captain, soldier, every inch unrecognizable. He tilted his head, as if the baroness had asked for the weather. He opened his mouth to reply when they were interrupted by a frightened wail.
," he relented, smoothing Artur’s uncombed bangs with a tender hand. "But be sure. We won't be able to come back later."
“Bah, well truthfully I’m too old for adventure stories but the artwork is so lovely I find I can hardly resist them. And everyone wants to be an adventurer in their heart of hearts I think.” She shrugged bashfully with a little smile and Tony smiled back.
“They’re fine Sir… but supper will be late now. Ginny will be miffed about that.” Harold shook his head jovially and Steve was distracted from the man’s troubling hesitance by the prospect of facing his housekeeper’s wrath. Virginia could be very diligent about keeping the houses schedule.
Franz paled at the prospect of torture but the man’s grey eyes were still steely with determination as he nodded.
“Certainly not, you men can save all that business for some other time.” She said airily, her cheeks flushed, betraying her eagerness to stir the conversation away from Stefen and she turned to the tall fair-haired woman next to her.
They missed him, in that chronic way that children with absent fathers tended to. It was an ailment Tony had never figured out how to cure.
"Charlotte, understand this.” She stilled, responding to the gravity in his tone and Steve leaned forward. “I'll give you everything at my disposal, but you share it with Tony. Tony goes with you to Geneva and will maintain his position with a set salary until either Sara is grown or he decides he no longer wishes to be employed. On this I won't compromise."
He really was no good at spy work he thought irritable, and not very good at tutoring either it seemed.
“Penny for your thoughts?” Charlotte murmured from the passenger’s seat as Steve drove the family back to the inn that was hosting them. The innkeepers had given them all four of the available rooms, proud and happy to boast that Major Rogers and his family were staying with them. The army had ordered it of course, but Steve had insisted on paying them anyway for their trouble.
“Yes, well Vonkov decided the best way to teach me a lesson was to force soap down my throat and then to beat me bloody. Surprisingly my parents agreed with the family butler that he’d gone too far in his discipline.”
Ian jumped, startled by the question asked loudly in his ear by one of the girl's in the group he and Natacha had been swallowed up in after dinner. Like most of the girls she'd traded in her Young Maiden's uniform for a party dress. Her blond hair was plaited in a crown around her head, but wisps of it were catching the bright lights in the hall and turning them gold.
She hurried back to slip her hand in his and he started, blinking down at her in surprise but he followed her without protest. When her hand was back in his, Artur tugged them both along to catch up with the others, casting only one nervous look toward the bar where Lt. Stevens was wrapped up in conversation with the baroness.
Bucky hummed thoughtfully and then replied, to the raucous approval of the others, “I imagine it’s got a lot do with the way I handle my weapon.”
Stefen had left the house in full uniform, but now he was hatless, hair filthy with soot and curling around his temples sticky with dried sweat. His jacket was torn in several places and his skin was littered with small cuts and bruises.
“What young man wants to spend his days cooped up indoors with old women, Stefen? This happened exactly because he is sixteen, not in spite of it.” Tony insisted with a hint of urgency in his gaze despite the droll tone. “And if you and I are going to be otherwise occupied during the day, all cutting their feathers is going to achieve is their resentment. Not necessarily their safety.”
People who didn’t know any better always said he was the spitting image of Hughard, but some folks back home (the ones in the know) said he resembled his mother's kin. As a young man he’d kept his hair long enough to take on her curls and sported the styles popular among other young Italians, doing his level best to make that true. It was a war of resemblance he'd been playing with himself since he was old enough to have an opinion about the hand genetics had dealt him.
“Who do you think taught me that move?” he asked, offering Bucky a hand to help pull him to his feet.
“All I’m saying is he was watching your door like a hawk and – come on you can push harder than that.”
Miraculously, two men in the truck following them toppled off the back like sacks of flour and lay in the dirt unmoving. Unfortunately, their comrades didn't stop to check whether they still lived or not.
“You’re stealing from us.” Natacha accused, flicking off her light and plunging them into the dark once more, leaving only the light from the moon filtering in from the window. Cameron must have recognized her voice because he sighed audibly in relief.
For most the great hubbub of Christmas was a thrill to be looked forward to; but Charlotte had always found the deluge of parties and gatherings that inevitably filled her social calendar each year exhausting. When she was a girl, it had been tradition for the family to spend the remainder of the winter at her grandparent's estate in Switzerland. Charlotte had traveled and seen a great many places since then, but there was nothing like waking up in the little turret room at the chatue de nauge with its tiny windows looking out over the hills and down into the valley below.
As soon as the brass saw the potential for pictures of proud Hitler Youth posing with Major Rogers flooding the local papers they’d been all for letting the family return home for the week that Péter was home for break. Even here the family had to play their role.
Stefen had been different since his return and as much as Tony tried to tell himself the failed coup and the onset of war was solely to blame for it, he couldn’t help the voice inside that warned him it also had something to do with Charlotte’s presence there.
Stefen’s jaw locked and he took an angry step forward and Tony tensed, muscles locking into place, bracing instinctively for a blow that didn’t come and Stefen jerked like he’d been struck instead and came to a sudden halt.
“Yes, we had better.” Stefen’s tone was bland enough as he answered, but he was finally looking directly at Tony now, and there was no missing the subtle glint of familiar challenge in his eye or the way he worked his jaw. Tony had irritated him, and the knowledge that he could still get under the man’s skin was enough to bring a smile back to his face.
“We do.” Pepper hurried to answer when Bucky opened his mouth with a darkening glower. “We’ve sent the rest of the staff home. The doctor said he is contagious.”
The children’s birthdays were generally lumped close together. Tony was good enough at maths to pick up the distinct patterns to their births. He’d make a solid bet with anyone, that their conceptions had corelated quite faithfully with their father’s leave rotation; but he kept his speculations on Stefen and Margrit Rogers enthusiastic reunions to himself, doubting very much that their children would find it as amusing as he did.
In the driver's seat Bucky unclutched his hands for what must have been the hundredth time. His tight grip on the steering wheel probably wasn’t very comfortable.
"You can shoot with your left hand." Tony pointed out, daring the other man to deny it. "I've seen you."
“That you will Major.” Striker agreed with a cold smile. “I myself was nearly wasted tending to children. But we do what we must, don’t we.”
In the bed the captain stilled, his head bent between his arms as he held himself up on his stomach, his arms as rigid as poles, the muscles cording.
“Life as a civilian has made you soft. You used to not care where your food came from,” Steve commented softly, watching Bucky’s face fondly as it twisted in a show of affront.
Tony clenched his teeth. He knew how those damn laws worked better than anyone. And the axe always fell based on how useful you were or weren’t to the Reich. Didn’t it? What use was a poor immigrant from Poland?
“What’s that, Tony?” the boy asked in a curious tone, pulling out the chair for Tony to sit, sure now that he had gotten his way.
He was right, as soon as James and Artur heard the news of another boy and girl in residence they rushed to clean up the broken wash stand and change into their dinner attire. Tony went to go check on Maria and Sara, the remaining two in his group of expert brick layers, and was gratified to see that they'd managed to get themselves scrubbed fresh and that Natacha was helping dry and brush their hair.
"Yeah, he's the best," said Tony. "He always said that trying to keep me in line during our time at university was one of the hardest things he's ever done."
just picturing the look of resigned horror on Papa's face was enough to turn Peter's stomach, not to mention how freaked out Dad was going to be.
The kind that he'd experienced in the throes of his highest childhood fevers, and when he had been pulled into the ice.
"Hey, little guy," Steve said, his heart skittering as he carefully patted Peter on the shoulder. Steve hadn't seen Sharon at the nurses' station and so wasn't able to ask her how Peter was doing, and while Steve was certainly no medical expert it sure seemed to him that Peter's condition was still deteriorating despite being in the hospital. His normally pale skin was even paler than usual, and he seemed to be wasting away, his shoulders and arms nothing but skin and bones.
Scrubbing a palm down his face, Tony heaved a sigh as he closed out the hologram. "Go ahead and start the render on these, J, I wanna be able to get 'em installed ASAP."
"Babe, you do realise that this is exactly what they want, right?" he said gently. "HYDRA? Wasn't the whole point of Project Insight to control people through fear?"
Whoever it was that had kept HYDRA's records at that Mongolian base had apparently written down freaking everything
"Peter!" Gwen exclaimed as soon as her face appeared on the screen. "Oh my God, are you okay? My dad saw what happened on the news and at first we didn't want to believe it, but—"
"I could ask you the same thing," Tony said, his expression scarily neutral. "I heard there was a bit of trouble during your patrol?"
"And especially since they seem to be the product of that HYDRA scientist we still haven't identified," agreed Steve. He tipped his head forward, pressing his lips against Tony's forehead as his right arm wound around Tony's waist, drawing him flush against him. "At least now we know, sweetheart."
Tony huffed. "That's 'cause your suit learns and adapts from your thoughts, Pete! It's nanotechnology! Listening to thought commands is one of its perks!"
"You saved us," he choked out, unable to catch the thought before it escaped from his mind. "You saved Pete, and you saved me, and—"
"Flare at your eleven, Rogers!" shouted Major Lorne. "It's another huge one and it's coming right at you!"
“And I’m pretty sure it’s not as gutsy as being forced to confront the man who should’ve loved you like a father,” Steve said firmly.  “So how ‘bout we just acknowledge that we’re both gonna feel a lot better once this is all over, and leave it at that.”
"Well, I can't say that I usually spend a lot of time talking about when I was a baby," Peter said, clearing his throat. "And I really don't get why everyone else sees the need to talk about it either."
Gwen whipped around in her seat, glaring at Flash around Peter. "You know, I would've thought you getting dressed down by an actual god might've taught you to keep your mouth shut, Flash," she retorted. "But I guess not even that's enough to get through your thick skull."
Tony popped a corn chip into his mouth. "Yep," he said, smiling so deviously that Steve couldn't help but smile back. Tony Stark's smile was quite possibly the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen in his life, and right then and there he decided that he would gladly do whatever it took to keep him smiling as much as possible.
"Aahh, did you guys just hear that?" Tomis said, his jaw hanging open so wide it looked unhinged. "'Cause with all the missiles we were firing earlier I'm thinking that my ears must've got messed up, so—"
Natasha grinned. "Thanks, I think the twins are going to love it. I know it's only high school, but this is a pretty big deal for them."
Which, Steve realised as he took off, was likely the very reason why Peter had never been granted such a chance.
He really should've known better. His heart was so weak now that even the simple act of walking to his bathroom was enough to cause it to flip out, beating so fast and so inefficiently that he could barely stay upright against the dizziness. The doctors had increased the dose of the medicines that pulled fluid from his lungs just a few days ago, but that was only yet another stopgap. Yet another temporary fix to the inevitable problem that was going to end up terminating his life.
After making sure that Tony finished his food before he escaped into his lab, Steve kissed him goodbye and headed down to the lobby, where he found Sam talking with the owner of the newsstand.
said Tony's answering shrug. All of Peter's heart and lung scans had come back completely normal, and both Sarah and Sharon had checked his vital signs numerous times since the procedure and pronounced him perfectly fine, but both Tony and Steve could tell that something was still a bit… off.
"I'll take care of him," Steve gasped as he cradled Peter close, brushing the soaked hair from his eyes and kissing his forehead. Peter's skin was littered with scrapes and bruises and as cold as a metal flagpole, and his lips were an absolutely horrible shade of bluish-purple, sending a violent shiver through Steve as he draped him over his arm and clapped his palm between the boy's shoulder blades. Peter jerked three times before coughing up what seemed like more water than his lungs should be able to hold, gagging and sputtering before going completely limp again.
"Um… well… let me see," Tony said, his breath hitching on every word. "I think I remember you mentioning something about using your tongue the next time that we did this."
"Well, then I guess that rules me out," Sam said. "Since I'm just one of your normal, everyday humans."
Thanks to homework, helping with dinner, and then helping Dad in the lab, the rest of the evening flew by fast, and after talking with Gwen and telling her that his dads had agreed to let him go on their date, he flopped into bed exhausted, but happier than he'd been in a long, long time.
"Yeah," Steve whispered into Tony's hair. He squeezed his eyes closed, holding his husband as tightly as he dared. "I love you so much, sweetheart."
Peter gulped, trying to soothe the stupid throat tickle that just wouldn't leave him alone. "Something happened with Papa's reentry, right?" he asked. "That's why he's not home yet?"
"Daddy?" Peter suddenly croaked through his mask, his huge brown eyes glassy with pain. "I don't—I don't feel so good. My chest, it hurts, and—"
HYDRA decided to unleash a bunch of their semi-enhanced zombies on him, nearly killing him three separate times before they switched their attention to Papa and arrested him, torturing him for an entire month before Peter was able to track down where they'd taken him.
it, especially when Morita told me he wasn't really given a choice on whether to hire him, said it was due to some state-mandated program giving jobs to disabled vets or something. But it's already been taken care of. I personally contacted Morita about it and Maria Hill has already informed the FBI, so Smythe isn't gonna be an issue any longer."
"M'Baku seems like a pretty stand-up guy," added James. "I'm sure he and the General will be able to get the country back into some semblance of order."
, 'cause once Pete gets all of his strength back, I swear that boy will be able to out-eat even you. I've never been able to figure out where he puts it all."
"Mmm. Well, let's hope that it sticks," grumbled Howard. The blackout was already severely limiting his patience, leaving him unable to continue his research into a new power source that could potentially replace the destroyed power plant, and the last thing he needed at the moment was for Tony to wake up crying because he was scared. The boy was six already, it was far past the time for him to be bursting into tears every time something didn't go his way.
"Yes..." Tony swallowed slowly as he fought to drag his brain out of the mud (he was a monk after all not a saint). "Yes, with a bit of coco and rum. Willamina is a treasure."
Rogers cleared his throat again and shook his head and Tony could only stare at him in bewilderment.
His evenings were spent with his family, and occasionally Charlotte whom Steve was relieved to see unaffected by the children’s addition to their limited time together. A gracious and practical woman to a fault, Steve had to agree with Bucky that she’d likely make a fine mother.
He almost missed Natacha’s low murmur. But when he snapped his head back around to demand to know if she’d said what he’d thought he’d heard her say, she was already moving past him and toward the gate.
As one of the senior foreman's out of the Munich work camp, he had access to equipment and vehicles, as well as the ability to falsify documents. The National Labor Service had grown flush now that the Reich was conscripting women as well as men to work cheaply wherever the work was needed. Healthy young men were being funneled into the army, and young women were beginning to take their places in the factory and aquaculture jobs.
“ – they’ve been wanted for weeks! The Captain has sworn us to secrecy of course, because it’s all a fine mess, but mark my words when they’re found it’ll be the end of Stark. Can you imagine the nerve of him, bringing that sort under the Captain’s roof?”  Hammer was crowing, and for a moment Tony was too caught up in the nature of what he was saying to realize that he and the children were in the open and it would be very bad if Julia were to glance over Hammer’s shoulder. That dirty snake! That traitorous dirty snake!
Steve lay there at night, letting his mind drift in and out, alternating between waves of fear and blank thoughts.
"And yet they claim to be so fond of each other." Tony mumbled, shaking his head slightly at the both of them. Bucky's grin slipped into a confused scowl and Steve turned his face into his armpit to hide his laughter.
For a long moment the captain said nothing before he turned back to meet Tony's gaze with a startling level of frankness.
"My God." Steve gaped, and not because a London broadcast which was outlawed, but because it was pouring into his ears, clear as a bell. Tony's mouth split into a wide grin of triumph and Steve just stared at him in dumb shock.
The second day went much like the first, and the children were just as adored by the new crowd as they had been by the one before it. That night much like the first, the family did not leave the fairgrounds until late in the evening long after Tony's stamina had begun to lag. The smell of cooked sausages and beer had begun to irritate his senses and he wished he could trade places with Artur who, upon being led to the table a few paces off from where his father was surrounded by admirers, had promptly dozed off with his head propped upon one arm.
“A sick woman attended a lecture I gave once with her father. In my arrogance I claimed that every disease was curable, simply a puzzle waiting for the right man to come along and solve it. She approached me after. She and her father begged me to use her as a test subject, to find a cure for the incurable.” Bruce recounted, and Tony sat still, not quiet believing that after all these years Bruce had chosen now to open up.
Except for yesterday, a little voice niggled at the back of her mind and she furrowed her brow in thought. He’d been happy yesterday with them in the mountains. Happier than she’d seen him in forever.
Was he a Stark man or wasn't he? He wouldn't run with his tail between his legs from Baroness Schrader. If it was to be a battle, then he'd come out the winner.
She snapped her mouth closed, biting back the threat of tears because he sounded ashamed (of her?) and sad, and tortured, and he wasn’t supposed to be any of those things! She was supposed to help him and make him happy, but she’d failed.
Tony severely doubted that, unless somebody had dropped the poor child on his head as an infant, which he wasn’t about to rule out.
"Not so very old Herr Stark. I think you’re quite distinguished." Natacha replied coyly, placing her hand gently in his. There was a very real smile in her eyes, which twinkled grateful and fond at him in the lanternlight as Emil stepped aside and Tony drew her into the crush of dancers.
"Tell me the truth..." Tony's voice sounded a bit rough, even to his own ears but he pushed on with a heavy breath. He would have the truth now. Stefen would give him that.
"I'll make sure the children understand not to go spreading tales about them. I presume you and Bakhuizen will be working on a way to get them to safety?" Tony asked, smirking at Stefen's hesitant pause before rolling his eyes once more and saying with a low chuckle, "That was the easy part Stefen. He's better at hiding his thoughts than you but it matters little, when I can't imagine a world where he wouldn't jaunt into the mouth of hell after you, the fool."
A cheer rose up as the bell dinged loudly and a smattering of applause broke out among the bystanders who had paused to watch when he struck it once more for good measure.
“A question I have often asked myself. Once I thought it was because he gave me a home. I see those brows working Grig, and at the risk of sounding ungrateful Cousin, this is not home.” Grig’s mouth closed, and whatever he had thought to reply went unsaid as he sat back and listened.
"Yes, when is Péter coming home?!" Artur demanded, lip jutting out in a teary eyed pout and Tony held his breath.
"Looks like we have to hoof it." he told Péter as he rejoined him in the dining room and Péter nodded, brow puckering with unease. He thought it strange too. The walk from the village to the villa wasn't that long - some of the staff made the trek every day - but the temperature had dropped drastically with the setting of the sun, and neither of them were as wrapped up as they could have been. Péter didn't complain, but Tony could hear his teeth chattering. He shared the last of the schnapps, the brothers had given him and watched somewhat amused as Péter eagerly tipped the flask to his lips and gulped the liquor down, only for his face to twist up in a gruesome expression as he immediately coughed and sputtered.
"No!" Péter immediately denied, shaking his head adamantly. "No, we got carried away is all. I'm sure you don't go around kissing other men."
“Sorry.” She’d said, her face twisted up in disgust as she’d shoveled the fertilizer over his legs and torso and given him a sack to cover his head with. But there was nothing to be sorry about. The road outside the station would surely be monitored and it was their best hope that no one would want to look too closely into the stinking crates.
His lips curved in amusement Steve crossed the room once both boys were settled and sat on the end of the bed, aware of their eyes on him. At least they did not look fearful.  Steve counted that as a small favor. He’d not done much to deserve their trust but he was trying to rectify that.
“I kissed you first. You acted as if nothing happened. The day I confronted you about it, you and Bucky were going over a map in your office. As I recall, I would have asked more questions about what you were up to, but I confess that your lips and generally infuriating nature are effectively distracting.” Tony reminisced, and Steve just stared at him for a moment, astonished to learn that despite his best efforts Tony had seen what he wasn’t supposed to see.
"Tony! Did you hear? We're going to the festival with Vati and we're going to sing!” the little boy exclaimed in excitement, hopping up from the floor to run to his side.
Truthfully, Steve was afraid to admit where he thought Tony belonged. Truthfully, Stefen could have married Charlotte and sent his family to safety ages ago. But selfishly, he’d balked at the thought of marrying a woman he didn’t love when there was already someone else consuming his thoughts.
But now, he'd changed. Now he said things just as dangerous as Herr Stark did and it didn't make any sense!
“You’re back! I didn’t know you were coming back today! How come you didn’t –” Admittedly he was babbling and Tony was thankful when Stefen cut him off by stepping up close, placing a firm hand on the back of his sweaty neck and hauling him into a kiss. Tony instantly got on board with it, heart pounding happily in his chest as he returned the kiss, hands flying to grasp Stefen’s face and deepen it. He was unable to keep the smile off his mouth or stop the desperate way his fingers grasped Stefen’s cheeks, even if he was leaving dirty streaks there.
They’d had to grow up, because everybody did. He was a man now and Natacha a young woman. But sitting with her, hearing her laugh, Péter could not help but think that maybe Herr Stark had been right. There were enough terrible things in the world. Why must they forget how to laugh? Natacha should dance again. Maybe they all should.
When Steve turned back to Noah the man’s smile had grown wider, but he lowered his voice when he whispered next, “You know that flower edelweiss is really a weed? We tried to stamp it out but it’s a hardy little thing. Refused to do as it was told and die. Now it is Austria’s emblem. Hell of a thing, this little flower.”
Fraulein Werner would believe her. She liked Natacha. She liked that Natacha was her mother’s daughter (the way she thought Mother should have been, and not the way she’d actually been). If Natacha told her she’d discovered the truth about Tony and that her father thought she was being silly (imagine a monk actually being a Jew) Fraulein Werner would believe her, and even if she didn’t she’d jump at the chance to pretend to. She’d want to show Father the power she had, and how his daughter had become what he hated.
Artur will be quite disappointed we’ll have to postpone our field lesson to see your highly praised hives. We are going to make our own protective clothing. Any tips you can provide on the latter is appreciated.
People would talk. There were a number of sins that could be hidden on darkened streets, when celebration was in the air and attentions diverted. Two men, walking together in the dark, brushing shoulders, even linking arms at times to whisper, was nothing. Cheering even, to witness such brotherly intimacy in a grim time when the world’s worries laid so heavily upon everyone’s shoulders. But once they were back in the house, amongst his family and their guests, it would not be wise to keep leaning so close, or touching so often.
“Still.” Tony said after a long moment of indecision. Did he show his hand (tell this man he was harboring more than one Jew)? Would it do any good?
They dragged him over to the small pen and tied him by the cuff around his wrists, low so the blood wouldn't drain from his appendages while he was unconscious. When they’d finished Magda stepped back and took him in, breathing heavily. When she’d caught her breath back, she knelt down and brushed some of the dirt away from his pale face. She tried hard to be gentle, but even with such a light touch she could feel the swelling and contusions under his skin. He was certainly a poor sight, all bloodied and blue.
“Thank you Sara, I needed one of those.” He quipped dryly but Bucky wasn’t fooled. A fellow would have to be made of stone to resist Sara.
But what caught Tony’s attention was the small stack of books and magazines closest to the edge, near the door. Standing up on a stack of aged looking tombs was one with a dark blue cover engraved in bold script.
Beutlin?” Tony demanded, shocked by the very notion. Stefen and Bucky shared a worried look and Bucky grunted in response, “Yes. You know him?”
He wondered if it was the same for Bucky. Did he feel it too or was he just putting up with their strange new addition for Steve's sake?
"I plan on moving the children there. Their grandparents have retired there, and their mother still has a portion of her inheritance there in an account with Lombard Odier in Geneva. It has 50,000 Reich Marks, I want to move the bulk of it from the German bank over as well, so that there will be enough to live on until Sara is finished with school if you are conservative… but the Reich may not allow it.”
She moved so slowly he didn’t realize she’d extending a hand toward him until her fingers uncurled, revealing a small brown bottle cradled in one palm.
There was something about the way the captain moved, and the ashen look upon the boy’s face that held the silence as the two entered – Stefen supporting the young man with a grip on his arm and a hand on his back. Cameron’s legs were wobbling as if he were drunk, but there was a hollow and glazed look in his eyes that said that was not the case. Tony’s heart sank within his chest as he took in the boy’s tear stained cheeks and the swelling bruise just below his right eye.
They’d done a few trials on rats, Tony remembered, but Bruce ultimately deemed it risky theory work. The sort Tony now understood he’d dabbled with intimately in the past.
“My only wish is to continue the command I've been appointed. My battalion needs me. I won’t leave an entire battalion on Major Dvořák’s shoulder.
“Surely it’s safe enough if we keep an eye on them?” Tony protested. “They seemed rather excited about the idea of ice skating.”
Steve caught her wrist without thinking and she jerked, her whole body tensing. It wasn't so much a flinch as it was caution, but cation for what? She tensed as if she expected...reprimand? Aggression? Violence?
Tony gripped the phone tightly, staving off the swell of emotion burning in his chest, trying to lodge itself in his throat.
Sam had meant as a soldier. Of course. What else could he have meant? Nobody knew about the other thing.
“Follow the curriculum I gave you and you shall have no problems. Do not, and I shall inform the captain. Is that understood?”
Tony jolted at the sound of a soft feminine voice in his ear. He’d been standing there staring after the Captain like some besotted idiot, and the whole world had just disappeared.
“What sorta job?” the boy asked. His heavy French accent made his German sound thick and clumsy. It made Stefen think wistfully of an old friend, someone he hadn’t seen since the war. And given the state of things, Steve privately thought with a pang that he was not likely to ever see Dernier again.
"Oh goodness no. That's so like James isn't it? Not to give warning that we were coming." Jann said in a fluttery way, releasing her hair from the scarf she wore and shaking out the black tresses before turning to help the children with their knapsacks.
In the audience, Natacha watched every graceful step, every leap, every motion, with an enraptured gaze, the smallest of smiles hiding in the corners of her mouth. Beside her Tony watched, but it was not this dance or these dancers that occupied his thoughts. His mind kept going back to that night in December. When Stefen had danced with him the music had been all wrong for a waltz. Tony hadn’t cared, but that was the joy of one’s best memories. The mind was always finding ways to apply golden hue. In his mind, he could change the music as often as he liked.
Bucky smiled at the thought. He and his little shadow were alike that way. Bucky’s mother had always warned there was power in names. First time he’d held the little brat, Bucky had determined that James Rogers was going to get a better hand out of life than he himself had been dealt.
“You lost your mind or somethin?” Clint questioned, pale brows arched dubiously. “What was that gibberish?”
It was a surprisingly short moment before he heard the soft scratching of the latch lifting and the shutters creaked open above his head. Péter stuck his head out, furtive as a bird peeping out of its nest. A look of relief washing over his pale face when he spotted Tony clinging to the side of the cabin. He mouthed for Tony to hang on and disappeared back inside, only to reappear a moment later with a length of knotted rope.
She’d even given him one that was entirely in English. Though he still couldn't read it well yet, he got a delightful thrill thumbing through the pages and guessing at the pictures.
Tony caught his eye from across the table and shifted them poignantly to Steve's empty plate, waiting to be filled. The thought of food, good as it smelled, held no more appeal than it usually did but Steve doubted he could pretend not to understand his silent commands much longer without Tony coming around the table to hand feed him.
"You’re going to let those wolves-" Tony cut himself off, eyes flickering to the cracked door. Even though they were conversing in another language the idea of being overheard weighed heavy on both their minds. He cleared his throat and looked back up at Steve before he continued again, lower, "Stefen. You have to send him.”
An excited burst of chatter had erupted from the others and Tony had caught Pepper’s eye searchingly, relieved when she gave a barely perceptible nod. She smiled at him and the children seemed to take this as confirmation because the noise level escalated as if someone had declared that summer was going to last six months longer this year.
“I’ve been assigned a new flock.” The man named Nik answered, and Péter thought there was a slight hint of regret under the somberness in the way he said it. Tony laughed, a short sharp bark of a sound, his teeth flashing.
Their newest breeding ram, Jasper, was nudging the prone figure of a man lying crumpled on the ground. Trig, another of their rams, hopped over the body and tutted unhappily. Their feed tin had been knocked over and the rest of their companions were feasting away at the spilled contents. They mostly ignored the body stepping over it.
“Good, we need you at your best.” Khalmmer replied, smiling again. One of the real ones. He sat down in on the sofa and cradled his own drink. Watching Steve with a curious expression.
Hasenkamp dabbed his sweaty brow with a crumpled handkerchief he pulled from his pocket and took a shaky breath. “Let me be frank with you, Major, Assistant Chief. The news has just broken that Vom Roth succumbed to his injuries. People are incensed. Rightfully so, but fights have broken out –”
For a long moment Tony didn’t answer, just staring deeply into his eyes and breathing, making Steve feel as if he were standing naked before God waiting for eternal judgment. And then Tony’s nimble fingers found their way to the lapels of his jacket, pulling them apart and slowly sliding the garment off his shoulders.
“I prefer whatever stops people from getting hurt the fastest.” He snapped. “Forgive me for not feeling all that confident that putting a rifle into the hands of Stefen’s eight-year-old son would achieve that outcome.”
“That’s an exercise in futility if I’ve ever seen one.” Tony remarked to Sara who trotted along beside him swinging their joined hands.
It was dark and Tony's hands were red from the soap when he finally sat back on his heels and looked over the fruits of their labors with satisfaction.  Natacha, her fingers red and raw from scrubbing, went over and lit the lamp. She looked over at Tony expectantly and reminded, "We'll miss the evening broadcast."
Steve couldn't keep slipping like this, and it seemed to be happening more and more often. What the hell had he been thinking? But of course he hadn't been. Bucky could just get under his skin sometimes, he'd strangle the bastard if he could imagine life without him. Snickering at him Bucky punched his shoulder, playfully this time, and slung his arm around Steve.
"Yeah, babe," Tony said, clearing his throat. "Pete, he came in earlier while I was working on the MAUDE glasses interface to tell me that dinner was ready. I let him take a look at it, and he tinkered with the design a bit like he often does, and then he asked me if once I got it figured out, if he could do the experiment along with Bucky. He told me that he felt like a ticking time bomb with those words just floating around down there in his subconscious, and—" Tony paused, looking into the concerned eyes of his husband, those striking blue eyes with just a hint of Irish green. "I know we've already told him that he's too young to make those kind of decisions, especially since we don't know if this will actually work or not, but Steve… do we really have the right to tell him that he can't try, just because we're scared of what might happen? Isn't that just really goddamn selfish of us?"
They had definitely not been celibate since that night that Steve faceplanted in their Tower bedroom, but at Steve's request they had limited themselves to blowjobs and handjobs—and a lot of kissing, always a lot of kissing—since he didn't feel comfortable with anything more while they were still recovering.
“Uh huh!  I’ll be right there!” Peter called back, grimacing as his stomach growled.  He patted the top of the book set as he headed into his bathroom to wash his hands, his mind drifting back to Steve.
"It's looking great, Control," replied Steve. "I'm gonna be pretty anxious to get back up here. Approaching go/no-go in five… four… three… two… one… mark."
"Of course he will be. But first we need to let him heal." Natasha gave Steve's shoulder a gentle shake. "C'mon, Steve. This'll only take a few minutes."
"Maria, go to him!" Howard ordered, pursing his lips as he regarded Pym. "And you! You know damn well that I had absolutely nothing to do with the power plant bombing! We have an alibi! Maria and I were at the hospital with Tony when it happened!"
"Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm fine," Peter said, almost grimacing at how much he sounded like his father. "Just… my dad's been under a lot of stress lately, and I'm a bit worried about him. His heart's not exactly normal, so—"
Which, based on their exceptional grades in school and their performances during the training sessions, they were well on their way to doing just that.
"Rhodey!" Tony shouted as he dove towards the ground. From what he had already seen of the Hammer suits in action he could tell that they couldn't bank worth a damn, just like the Chitauri equipment on which they were based.
"Yeah, he really is." Steve paused, wondering if he should even bother to ask. "Um, do you know if his father's been able to come in and see him at all?"
"It's okay, Scott, I don't need you to tell me an exact time," Steve assured him. "Do you like peanut butter?"
Landing in Wakanda, in the middle of a battle that he had technically already fought, had been one of the most disconcerting experiences of Steve's life, second only to when he awoke from the ice. The urge to rush right over to Bucky and Sam and embrace them had been nearly insurmountable, an urge he had seen mirrored in Clint and Natasha's faces when they first laid eyes on Wanda. Both Sam and Bucky had wondered aloud where Tony had suddenly come from, especially since they had been well aware of how worried Steve had been about him the last time, and Steve had also noticed Wanda doing a double-take at Natasha's hair, which was now much longer than it had been a year ago.
"I need to burn you into my memory, sweetheart," Steve said as he moved down the bed to Tony's feet, curling his fingers around his ankles and slowly gliding them up his legs as his lips followed in their path. "Need to remember every single dip and curve of your beautiful body, every single place that I've felt and touched and kissed. It's so cold out there in space,
the monster thought-screamed as it advanced another couple of steps, so close that Peter could feel its heat hitting him in waves, clouding his vision and searing his lungs as he gasped for breath.
Steve's mind reminded him, causing him to scowl. It was something that he frequently said to both Peter and Tony, whenever the situation granted it. But he often had difficulty believing it himself.
"All right, here we are," Dad said as he pulled into the driveway at what JARVIS had indicated was Liz's address. He frowned as he scanned the large, sprawling house with floor-to-ceiling windows across nearly the entire front, through which Peter could see the brightly flashing lights from the DJ station. Peter had always guessed that Liz's family was on the wealthier side based on her clothes and the car her mom drove, but he hadn't thought that she was quite this wealthy.
"Does stuff like that happen a lot at Stark Industries?" he asked. "Pepper seemed pretty concerned."
"Steve, I'm counting seven hostiles out in the open here," Sam said from somewhere above him, his dual guns blazing as yet another grenade exploded about twenty metres to Steve's right. A second later Bucky emerged from the trailer and dropped to the ground, aiming his rifle at a two story building across the street.
The heat from the exploding ship was so searingly strong that for a moment, Tony was actually scared that his suit might lose its cohesion. But once the fireball had dissipated and he was able to peel open his eyes again, he found that not only had they destroyed the ship, they had also taken out at least three universes worth of the Chitauri warriors.
"Got it," replied Fury. "Coordinate with Hill once you're on the ground, she'll put you in touch with Prince T'Challa."
He was Captain America, for goodness sake, but even aside from that, fathers were supposed to be able to protect their families. It just wasn't fair that Steve's immense love for his husband and son still wasn't enough to keep their demons at bay.
"Oh," she said, rubbing her eyes. "I was—I was kinda hoping he'd—that he'd wake up while I was sleeping."
Tony dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. Leave it to Steve to continue on the mission as if nothing were wrong. If Tony hadn't been so goddamn worried and scared, he would've been almost amused.
me, I only thought that you did.  And that's gonna be something I’ll have to live with for the rest of my life.”  He stepped forward, eyeing Obie up and down.  “But at least the rest of my life will no longer include you.”
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered as he draped his glorious body over Steve's, pressing him down into the mattress as his lips trailed across Steve's pecs, pausing to flick his tongue across both his nipples as his hand slid down his sternum and abs to pop the button on Steve's shorts and lower the zipper.
"Tony," Steve said gently as he reached for his hand. "Sweetheart, I think I might have a good idea. Let's just listen for a bit, okay?"
Was he ever going to be rid of HYDRA? Or was he destined to be chased by them forever, like the sun by the moon.
“Except you didn't this time,” Obie continued.  “And now we’ve got an entire assembly line that’s reconfigured, and—”
Steve thinks as the water finally clears from his ears.  The roars of the crowd are nearly deafening as he removes his outer cap and goggles, placing them on the deck under the starting block before gliding across his lane over to Schmidt.
“No promises,” Dad said with a wink.  Then he sat down on a small chair next to Papa and took his hand.  “JARVIS?  We good to go?”
Tony paused to allow his words to sink in, his heart fluttering at the awe breaking out across the faces of each of the pilots. Peter had told him there'd be no way that any pilot worth his uniform would be able to resist the possibility of being the first Langaran to fly into space, and as usual, he had been absolutely right.
All the air whooshed from Peter's lungs in one fell swoop, and he had to physically stop himself from gasping out loud. Of
"Yeah, babe," Tony murmured, earning another comforting squeeze to his sore left trapezius muscle. If anyone could understand having to potentially sacrifice a few people for the sake of billions, it was Steve. He had been forced to make many such decisions during the war. Decisions that still haunted him, kept him up at night.
There was a pause, one where Peter could picture Dad's half-amused frown almost as clearly as if he were standing next to him.
But hurt seemed like the absolute last thing on Peter’s mind as the doors to the school suddenly burst open and a pack of boisterous kids came rushing out, all whooping and hollering for the start of summer.  Tony’s heart leapt as Peter came racing towards them, jumping into Steve’s arms and burying his face into his chest as Tony wrapped his arms around them both.
“Yes,” Steve answered.  “It’s—I—”  He broke off as he felt Tony’s fingertips glide down his back and slip between his ass cheeks, teasing the sensitive skin there.  “Oohh…”
"Are you sure?" Steve murmured against Tony's thigh, his eyes twinkling as he tapped Tony's prostate again. "I could just keep doing this, seems like you're enjoying it just fine."
he thought, because thinking was a tiny bit less painful than speaking, at least for the moment. His head was pounding, and all four of his limbs felt like they had been filled with wet sand, heavy and useless.
"This is gonna work, sweetheart," Steve murmured into Tony's ear. "It's gonna work because we're in it together, and as long as we're together, no one can stop us."
"That's plenty of time for a decent nap, Steve," said Sam. He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "You might wanna steer clear of Thor, though. I've never heard anyone snore so loud in my life. I had to stick my earplugs in to drown him out!"
"I know he loves it," Tony said after a short pause, his fingers curling around his left forearm again. "And since there's no way in hell that I'm about to let him go back to galavanting around Queens rescuing cats out of trees and stopping bike thieves, it's all he's gonna get."
But Steve knows it’s only a matter of time before somebody does.  And when that happens, and his name is no longer mentioned even in passing… then he supposes he’ll just fade into obscurity, like so many other washed-up Olympic athletes.
Steve's jaw was twitching like mad as he glanced down at Tony, his lips pursing at Tony's affirmative nod.
As long as he could believe that Tony and Peter were okay, Steve knew he could handle anything that HYDRA wanted to throw at him.
“Yeah, that’s the one,” said Tony.  “Listen, I know this might sound a bit weird, but I’m calling because—”
“Mmm, well… maybe just not in front of me, okay?” asked Peter.  “For a change?”  It’s not that he didn't like how much his dads loved each other, he just didn't need the accompanying mental visuals brought on by the constant innuendos that Dad couldn't seem to keep from dropping.
There was a short pause, followed by some shuffling noises interspersed with muffled grunts of pain before Papa spoke again, clear and true even as he sounded like his heart was breaking.
Okay, maybe ‘convinced’ wasn’t exactly the right word to describe the all-out tantrum that Peter had thrown, but whatever.  It had at least served its purpose of getting Dad to lie down for a while.
"Pete? You be careful!" Tony yelped as Peter launched a web towards one of the flying chariot things, yanking him clean off his back only a few seconds after the two armies, who had been rumbling towards each other like some kind of medieval video game, finally crashed together.
And now Steve knew that with his soon-to-be husband and son by his side, they could face whatever challenges life and work decided to throw at them.
"Hmph," Tony said, sniffing. He looked up at Steve, his brown eyes glassy. "It was the least I could do for the boy who saved my life."
As the ship touched down not too far from the Compound's training dome, Nebula appeared behind Tony's chair, reaching for him before he could utter a word of protest. He wanted to ask if Gamora had made it, but then decided against it. He could vaguely remember Nebula mentioning something about Gamora being enhanced, as an explanation as to why she didn't require as much food as Tony. Thanos had enhanced her, just like he had pulled Nebula apart and then put her back together, piece by piece.
"It went fine," Steve answered, proceeding to fold an entire piece of bacon into his mouth. "Just did a couple extra laps is all."
"Okay, so… hold on a second here," Tony said, holding up his hands. "You're telling me that Thanos… beat up
"Ah huh," Tony said. "And so… after Hank Pym put out the word that he was looking for someone to break into his own house, you jumped at the chance?"
Tony had been prepared to risk everything for Steve.  His company, his livelihood, and Peter’s inheritance.  And then…
And why did hospitals always have to have so much white everywhere anyway? As an artist, Steve had always found the lack of colour disturbing, and not at all conducive to a person's recovery.
"'Kay," whispered Tony. The corners of his mouth drew into the slightest of smiles, one that Steve couldn't help but mirror.
"All right, hon," he said softly, again stamping down the panic threatening to break free. "But I wanna meet your ma first, okay?"
"I've got Петр here with me, Тони," Bucky said over the comm, nearly causing Tony to melt with relief. "We're in the very centre of the Asgardian army with Ванда and Пьетро, and the wizard dudes are giving us cover."
Steve tucked his pencil down inside the wires of his sketchbook and tipped his head back against the lounge chair, allowing the last remnants of the setting sun to wash over him, filling him with the warmth that he craved with every fibre of his being. The sketchbook resting on his lap was filled with drawings that he'd sketched over the course of the last few days, of his family enjoying themselves. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt relaxed enough to draw like that, just for fun, like he always used to before—
Peter shifted slightly in his chair, causing Gwen's fingers to tighten and send another bolt of warmth up his arm. They were watching Rogue One, a movie Peter had already seen twice before, and it was almost time for the big climactic battle scene to begin.
Chaos erupted on the bus, with all of the students scrambling from their seats to crowd in the back, clamoring to get a better look at the spaceship. Peter quickly seized the opportunity, launching a web at the emergency exit window across the aisle. With a final glance back at Gwen, he slipped out to cling to the side of the bus as he dug around behind his neck for his mask, pulling it up and over his head.
"Let me stop you right there," Peter interrupted. "I know what you're gonna say, and you don't have to, okay? I've heard it my whole life."
"Mmm," grumbled Tony as he stifled another yawn. "Well, as long as you didn't fight the war while I was out, I s'pose it's okay."
"Shit, this is one for the ages, Stevie!" shouted Captain Barnes as his third engine ignited. "Oh man, this is so awesome!"
Peter's already pale cheeks paled even more as he fiddled with his polar bear's ear, his lower lip trembling.
Thor's face turned grim, his hand gripping his axe handle with white knuckles. "Thanos killed my brother," he said through clenched teeth. "So I am uncertain if Stark and Starkson will be formidable enough to prevent Thanos from obtaining the Time Stone."
Arriving back in the kitchen, Steve was pleased to find that not only had Peter started heating up the chicken broth, he had also begun prepping the chicken. Steve had explained to him once they started grocery shopping together that he and his ma had always used chicken thighs for their soups and stews since they were both less expensive than chicken breasts and had more nutrients.
Or at least, that was Uncle Sam's theory about it. Peter had yet to tell his dads that he was starting to remember more of what had happened down in Miami, and Uncle Sam had promised to keep it a secret unless he decided that it was doing Peter harm to do so. Dad and Papa didn't need anymore reasons to worry about him, they already had enough of their own.
As Tony and Steve had realised, when they discovered that Arnim Zola, the man behind the Project Insight algorithm, had been yet another of Howard's questionable SHIELD colleagues, recruited into the organisation by Howard himself.
"He's gone!" Tony cried, the anguish he had been carrying ever since Peter had faded to dust finally bubbling over. All of his blood turned to ice, the world spinning all around him as he felt Steve shudder, his arms gripping him like a vice.
“I do understand that, Master Peter.  However, I must inform you that your case still remains circumstantial at best,” JARVIS said sadly.  “Unless there is something specific that ties Mr Stane to the sale of these bullets, or something that indicates that the Special Forces team was deliberately targeted, I am afraid there is not enough information for an arrest.”
"Okay, we're starting to get a bit off track here," Steve cut in. "Regardless of the laws of physics, obviously Mr Pym was able to create these particles way back in the eighties, right?"
When I made JARVIS I made sure that no one would be able to mess with him except me, my dad, or my grandpa, so how—?" He broke off as the tears spilled over, rolling down his cheeks. "Oh gods, Uncle Bucky, this is all my fault! I'm the one who wrote JARVIS's program, so if there was a problem with him, then—then—!"
Once again, Tony was struck speechless, wishing for the umpteenth time that Steve was there with them. A quick glance over at his son confirmed that he was thinking the exact same thing, which, while not helpful in the slightest, at least made Tony feel just a tiny bit better.
They were quiet for several heartbeats, until Steve spoke up again. "That's how it was for me after the battle, mo grá," he whispered. "And it still hasn't stopped."
"I have already informed Dr Cho that Master Peter has awoken, Captain," said JARVIS. "She will be arriving momentarily."
"Wait a second," Peter said. "JARVIS, does Dad still have that old lab next to the CEO office downstairs?"
"They'll understand!" Peter said, ducking as the monster swung again, grunting and coughing as a wall of pure heat smacked him across the face. "They'll probably show up in a few minutes anyway, so I'll make them understand. Just… please make sure that Gwen's okay!"
"No!" he said, the word tearing through his throat like the jagged edge of a saw. He covered Peter's hand with his own, gasping when his fingers went right through. "No, Pete, you can't—you just gotta hold on, buddy, okay? You just gotta stay with me! Just stay with me!"
"Tony," he said on a gasp as he took the hint and tugged off his shirt, tossing it behind him and kicking off his shoes as Tony pulled off his own shirt. "Sweetheart, I—"
"If I have to," Steve murmured, moaning when Tony dug the pads of his fingers into his scalp. His eyes fluttered closed as he relaxed against Tony, trying to focus only on the feel of his husband's fingertips instead of the pulsating pain in his foot and side.
"We're in the endgame now," said Dr Strange. "And if I tell you what happens, it won't happen." Then he let out a heavy sigh, reassuming his
"Yeah, I'm okay," Tony answered. "The ground forces have O'Brien's headquarters surrounded and are bringing him and his goons out now, and Phillips has us barricaded in here pretty good, so you don't need to worry about me. You just do what you're up there to do and get back home."
"I'll admit, it is pretty cool to be able to get the facts from people who actually lived through them instead of a book," Peter said as he pulled out his algebra textbook, balancing it on the pile in his arms. "But seriously dude, you gotta quit talking so loud about Uncle Bucky, okay? With all the new scrutiny the Avengers are under, we gotta be extra careful until we can get all his stuff sorted out."
The main problem would be getting his hands on the rest of the materials that he needed. Materials that the government leaders were guarding so closely and so possessively that only a handful of people even knew of their existence.
"So, Peter," Mrs Stacy said once everyone had started eating. "Have you always lived in that huge Tower?"
"Good," Steve said softly as he pressed Tony's palm to his cheek. "But we're not going anywhere until you're completely better, okay? Shuri said it shouldn't be much longer."
"Well, I know I don't know him very well, or even at all," said Steve. "But even the fact that he tried to coerce Scott Lang into trying to steal from us doesn't sit well with me. From what you've told me, Pym's pretty wealthy, so why couldn't he have done for Scott what you did for him?"
The pause that followed seemed to stretch on interminably, each passing second punctuated by a thud of Joseph's heart against his ribcage.
Steve and Tony both looked at each other with wide eyes, and the sense of dread that Steve had been trying to stamp down all morning welled back up, sitting like a lead ball in the pit of his stomach.
A smile stretched across Peter's lips as he thought about how much happier and more relaxed Dad had been lately. He had even stopped most of his grumbling about Grandpa, something that would've never been possible before Steve came along.
, but Sam had warned Steve prior to his discharge that the reporters were all very eager to hear statements from Steve and Tony as well.
"It wouldn't be the first time the government misplaced something important. They lost you for over sixty years, didn't they?"
"Get these jeans off. And the rest of your clothes too, while you're at it," Tony ordered as Steve tore away from his mouth to suck another mark into his neck. "A body this exquisite should never be covered. In fact, I might even make it a new house rule. No more clothes for you."
"And I…" Tony forced out, his cheeks growing more and more grey with every beat of Steve's heart. His beautiful long fingers splayed apart, preparing to snap.
Tony's shoulders dropped, glancing furtively at Bucky's simulator. "Well… that's kind of a long story, hon, so…"
It was working. All he had to do now was rid the rest of JARVIS's coding of any mentions of Ultron, and Papa would be good to go.
“Yeah.  Um… I need you to disconnect the alarm for Steve’s store for me,” Tony said, scratching at the back of his neck.  “He’s got an ADT basic setup with auto locks, according to the panel that I’ve seen on the inside, so it shouldn't be too hard for you to override.”
Tony said on a groan as he curled his fingers around his cock, stroking himself in time with Steve's thrusts. "I can't—Steve, I'm gonna—
"D-daddy!" stammered Peter as he scrambled to his hands and knees, crawling back towards the rapidly disappearing hole and pounding on the ice with his fists. "P-papa's s-stuck, we g-gotta g-get him out!"
“And with that, he hits the nail right on the head, ladies and gentlemen,” Tony said.  “And it’s not just the two of us.  I have a feeling there’s gonna be a lot of people who’re gonna be breathing a bit easier after today.”
Steve gave a somber nod. Even a week would be better than the ordeal he and Tony had endured after the battle down in Miami, where Obadiah Stane and Aldrich Killian had tried their hardest to convert Peter into another Winter Soldier. Peter had been comatose for months following the battle against Killian's Aminacin-enhanced army, necessitating everything from a feeding tube to daily physical therapy to keep his muscles from completely wasting away.
But of course he did.  ‘Cause Obie was Obie, which meant he knew no shame when it came to getting Tony to do what he wanted.
"Well, for right now we're just gonna sit here until Bruce needs me to take over," Tony said quietly. "And then once we're able to leave here we're gonna go home, give Pete a few of those bear hugs that he loves so much, and then we're gonna get started on the next part of your plan to eliminate HYDRA. And then maybe once that's done, we can both breathe a little easier. Okay?"
Three of the longest seconds that Tony had ever experienced in his life passed before he heard Steve's reply.
Flash gave a shrug as he bit into a slice of pizza. "Yeah, well, he kinda had an unfair advantage, I think. I'm sure if I got frozen for over sixty years that I'd still look the same too."
"There's no one else here, Peter," an unfamiliar voice said, causing Peter to whip around. "It's just you."
All of which meant that Steve had better find the bunker he’d been sent to find soon, before it got dark.  From what he could tell he was still about fifty kilometres away, and while he hoped he’d be able to make it there before dark, judging by the low position of the sun he would definitely be cutting it close.  For a moment he wondered why the plane had chosen to drop him so far away from the structure, but quickly squashed it.  He was already down, so that didn't really matter anymore, and based on the briefing materials he had been given on the flight, the entire wooded area that surrounded the bunker was rigged with landmines and other various traps that were left over from a failed coup—or was it annexation?—attempt about five years ago.  Steve’s task was to navigate a path through the maze so that the STRIKE team could then move in and secure the bunker, gaining access to all of the supposedly classified materials hidden inside it.
"Yeah, yeah, okay," Dad cut in. He sat down next to Peter, blotting his forehead with the towel still hanging around his neck. "How much of it did you eat, bud?"
Tony clung tightly to Steve's hand as they headed across the vast yard of the Compound to the main SHIELD building, where Scott Lang was being held in the sub-basement brig. Fury had offered to have Maria Hill conduct Lang's questioning, but Tony had adamantly declined. He wanted to hear directly from the horse's mouth exactly why in the
He was carrying the tesseract. If its container was breached… there'd be no way any of them would survive a direct hit—
"So…" Tony said as he carefully cupped Steve's right cheek—the less beat-up side—as he regarded the overgrown whiskers covering the lower half of his husband's face. Steve had always hated having any facial hair; he'd always said that it made him itch something fierce.
And, according to all the history books, that handful who had experienced it did so under the near-constant threat of war.
"No matter what happens, I want you to know that I will always love you. You and Peter have brought me so much joy in these last few months, joy that I never thought I was even remotely capable of feeling. You were the two pieces of my life that I never even knew I was missing, and for that I want to thank you."
"Copy that." Steve then stepped closer to Natasha, staring at the monitor in front of her. "Nat, you said my name is on that list, correct?"
Gasping and choking, Peter could only watch as the monster stepped forward and planted his massive foot directly on top of his chest, leaning down with such an evil look in his eyes that Peter's heart skittered.
Shooting another guard away as he approaches the perimeter of the building, Steve runs around to where Tony is hovering near a large window, his ears picking up some kind of low-pitched humming noise.
Steve frowned slightly as he ran through the calculations Tony had taught them for predicting the go/no-go point. "But the power source wouldn't really matter while we're in orbit anyway, isn't that right, Mr Stark?" he said. "Since the orbits are being maintained by the planet's gravity and not the aircraft's power source, then—"
"Yes," answered Scott, pointing directly at Natasha. "And when she disappeared, I got stuck inside there."
"Mmm. Then you damn well better take some notes, yeah, buddy?" Tony muttered from the table, his eyes still closed. "Or better yet, just ask if you can record the whole thing."
to be it!" Peter whispered, burying his face into his polar bear. It couldn't have been just a coincidence that someone—or something—had activated a defence drone up at the Compound, which just so happened to be the place where the sceptre was being stored.
"Oh? And what gives you that idea?" he asked as he picked up a pencil, twirling it between his fingers.
Not that Peter could blame him, of course, but it still made him sad. Of all the things that could’ve happened to Papa, being frozen in ice again was probably one of the worst.
Tony shook his head, squeezing his eyes closed as he hugged Peter even tighter. "Oh hell, buddy, you already do more than enough," he said. "And you're just a kid, you shouldn't have to be concerned about all this damn adult stuff."
"But he's not missing!" Gwen cried. "Or at least, he doesn't think he's missing." She glanced up at her father, who gave her an encouraging nod. "You see, I found him… right before he got away, and—and I told him that I knew who he was and what he was trying to do, and—"
“One: you bring Brother Banner with you when you leave and see that he makes it safely to Engelzell Abbey with the other brothers.”
He mentally chided. He refused to let himself dwell on the prospect of the train arriving without Bucky and the children. It was a notion he couldn't even entertain while maintaining his sanity.
Bucky lowered his head to the table to drown out Tony's rapid babble, but mostly so he didn't have to look at the stupidly fond expression on Stefen’s face as he watched the other man. Never mind that it was unnatural, there wasn't any future for them besides heartbreak. Bucky still wasn't eager to see Stefen suffer that, but fuck with everything else coming their way it felt like a moot point. Broken hearts and broken bones were coming in spades. He might as well let Stevie have the delight that he seemed to get (in spades) from Starks company while he could. For Christ sake everyone but the Führer himself would be in the ballroom tonight looking for that damned book. By tomorrow they could all be in front of a firing squad.
Bucky pushed away from the door and wordlessly stepped into Tony’s space, handing over his pistol even as he used his bulkier frame to edge Tony away from the steering wheel.
Tony took a breath. Preparing for more lies, no doubt. Steve waited, his entire body coiled, primed for a fight that was sure to happen.
But it left the question of why, and yesterday Tony might even have dared to say it was to keep them out of the Reich’s hands but today… well he’d invited them to tea, so what the hell did Tony know.
He fired into the oncoming vehicle, smiling as the glass in the windshield splintered and then cracked. The vehicle swerving violently and crashing into a tree as the drivers face exploded in a shower of red.
Tony felt the familiar pang of old grief and shoved it too away. He wondered vaguely if Mrs. Rogers had had Italian in her blood and almost as soon as the thought came he dismissed it. Mrs. Rogers was a pure Austrian beauty, decidedly not Italian and certainly not a Jew, nothing like his mother. Salzburg’s national treasure would have had to have a proper Austrian on his arm.
"Well not if we all freeze to death." Stefen grumbled, rubbing Sara's back with one broad palm. "Cameron’s usually here by now.  Though why Hammer hasn't -"
“I might surprise you.” He answered as nonchalantly as he could manage through the tightness in his throat.
It wouldn’t come to that, he thought with panic, trying to collect his thoughts. Alright so Steve had made his bride a bridal necklace. He’d done crazier shit. This was a good sign. A strange one, but from a good place, Bucky decided.
The bald statement hit her like a slap and for a moment she couldn’t form a single thought, but then…
Huh? Péter stared after the man as he disappeared into the shadows around the church building in confusion. He heard Tony call the man a bastard under his breath, but then whatever spell had held him before broke and he turned to the door with the keys in his hand and urged Péter to hurry.
It took a quick casing of the house to realize that Tony must have retreated to his own room, the locked door a giveaway despite his refusal to answer any of Steve’s knocks.
Professor Sieger’s eyes narrowed and he fixed Tony with a disgusted look that only halfway masked the fear in his gaze.
“Franz won’t know the code.” Steve turned back to the thin man sat across from him and shook his head when it looked as if Franz might protest. “That way if you are questioned you’ll have nothing to betray.”
but it is. You’re questioning me right now. The Führer called for complete education reform and he was once a student of many fine teachers, some he liked, some he clearly did not. Now everything has changed to reflect what he likes.”
He held it, inspecting it carefully on all sides, before gently placing the rim against his lips and breathing in deep. Though he could not draw the taste or the smell of him in as he wished, Bucky was sure that Stefen had been there. His Stevie had held this cup and drank from it. Stupid fool. He’d stayed here, bedded down with the damn goat, staking his life on the kindness of strangers when anyone else would have done what they had to in order to guarantee survival. Bucky would have.
Across the table Tony lifted himself up to reach for the bowl of sliced apples and the soft sound of clinking drifted once more to Bucky’s ears.
Kneeling down to his eye level Tony gently reminded Artur that Péter was away at school, but Artur wasn’t about to let the matter drop so easily.
As Kurt approached their table Bucky cheered loudly in German and clapped Steve on the shoulder, turning toward Kurt he boomed, “We're celebrating, Dobas! Bring out the orange cream and liquor.”
As Hammer continued to argue with the two women Tony kept his expression bland but tuned their voices out, neither needing nor desiring to hear more.
Péter could not describe what it was he felt in that moment. Apprehension, because no matter what his father seemed to think he was not a child and he understood more about war than the captain probably wanted him to. How could he not with such a committed soldier for a father? His father did not like Hitler or the Nazis and he had trouble hiding that fact, though he never deigned to share his reasoning with his children. Stefen Rogers rarely deigned to share a meal with them let alone his politics.
The car jolted suddenly and tilted to the right. Harrison had finally managed to take out the tires. The sudden motion took Stark by surprise and his opponent took advantage of his momentary lapse to deliver him a hard blow to the face. He wrestled the pistol free of Stark’s slackened grip and straightened up.
“Ah, Hammer, who delivered the telegram?” Péter asked, more words than Steve had heard him say since diner had started.
In the movie they used Leopoldskron Palace (pictured below) for the backdrop of the Von Trapp house and we've kept a similar aesthetic to the Rogers family home. We've isolated them a bit more, because Steve likes his peace and privacy lol. Past the city proper, over the hills, and tucked between the feet of the mountains there is a shining lake and a handsome little estate he likes to call home.
Tony had looked to the soldier marching alongside their crawling car and asked, and the man had replied that they were rescues, shipped in fresh from the Sudetenland. They were there to give their thanks for being returned to the empire and be welcomed back into Germany by all those gathered there that day.
So that was it. Guilt and fear seemed to be hanging over the man. Guilt for not acting quickly enough and letting the window of opportunity close, and fear of the very real hardship of sending one’s children away from one’s self with no guarantees of when they would be reunited. No way to stop something horrible from befalling them when they were out of your sight.
“We’re the same you see, because I need to save my people. The Jews.”  Stefen dropped the hand reaching for Tony, the blood drained from his face but Tony took another step backward. He’d hid the secret for so long that he found it laughably easy to keep going once the words had left his tongue. They were a shuddering breath crisp in his lungs after being held under water. Dizzying.
“No, no he was a... there were-" Steve stammered, unsure how to phrase what he was trying to say. "Péter there will always be terrible ideas backed by crowds of people, and they won't always call themselves Nazis."
He tried to catch his breath, sluggishly rubbing sweat out of his eyes. As the room began to come back into focus around him his heart began to pick up pace again but this time it was accompanied with the sour tendrils of fear.
“Where are they?” he snapped in question, quickly rising from his chair and scurrying inside, Pepper following at his heels.
The unconventional attitude she’d embraced as a single woman of wealth had once made her a power in Vienna and the darling of the Austrian Women’s Society, but now it made her a potential threat to a new leadership who had shown a startling propensity for simply disappearing political opponents.
“It’s our literature this week!” Maria confirmed with an eager smile. “Tony says, after we finish we can start Les Misérables.” There was a wistful gleam in her eye and Stefen smiled, though there was something shadowed that passed over his expression when he looked at Tony.
Steve felt a small bit of relief at that. There was time still to prepare, to speak with Natacha before she was thrown to the wolves… though any relief that Steve felt was quickly swallowed by guilt because he did not know what he would say to his daughter to explain what he needed from her. Too much information would put her in danger, but his silence left her to draw her own conclusions. How confused she must be.
Péter deserved everything that life could offer him, everything Steve had never had. He deserved to be able to do as he pleased without looking over his shoulder for the next knock in the face for doing so.
They undressed each other with purpose despite the shaking of hands and fumbling of fingers that suddenly seemed unprepared for the task set before them. Both of them needed the contact of skin, the hunger for it pushing them forward. Each touch was like taking a breath, somehow making it easier to take the next until they were finally bare.
"From what I know about what they're doing at Dachau, it's a bigger risk to leave Leshnerr and Richter in the hands of the Nazis." Tony returned. His gaze sharpened on Nik when the abbot showed no surprise a or curiosity about his remark. He didn't so much as try to pull information out of Tony, and with Farkas that meant either he was playing some game to get Tony to volunteer it, or he already knew. Tony hedged his bets on the latter.
Normally the women are buried with them see, but my baka cut hers off, so that her daughter might find acceptance with another family of rom... so that she and the child she carried wouldn’t be condemned forever to wander in exile.”
There were a fair number of prisoners among them, Tony noted, their pinstriped uniforms easily spotted against the snow. But there were others as well: Men rounded up from the ghettos, and free Germans whose wives had no doubt helped them wrap their hands for warmth and stuck hot stones in their pockets before they set out in the morning.
“Did you need straightening?” Stefen asked, something sympathetic in his eyes, and Tony couldn’t help but laugh, because Stefen’s sympathies were all misplaced.
"Yes, we've kept a very close record of all that you say Herr Hammer. You say that Major Rogers speaks out against his superiors and allows his children's teacher, a man you believe he is having an unnatural affair with, to go against the state curriculum. You say that he has offered refuge to undesirables and that a monk – of all things – is building weapons and selling them to rebels right under our noses. You’ve even gone so far as to suggest that in a fit of temper, Major Rogers desecrated the flag in broad daylight, surrounded by witnesses." Lt. Stevens recounted succinctly.
Prince Loki was neither swayed no impressed by his brothers show of temper, keeping still and aloof. A sharp contrast to Thor’s impatient prowl across the room.
"I'm fine. Someone needs to check the bunks. Phillips -" Steve slurred quietly into Bucky's neck and Bucky gritted his teeth in a scowl. Steve's skin was hot pressed against his, almost hotter than the harsh breath he kept panting into Bucky's neck. He'd babbled nonsense from the moment Bucky had met Harold in the hall where he'd been struggling to drag Steve to his bed. Bucky had immediately pitched in to help but best friend or no, Steve was a heavy bastard and it didn't help that he was clearly delirious with fever and trying his best to avoid being put to bed.
“The question,” Bucky grappled tiredly for the cup he’d been drinking from before he’d fallen asleep, nearly knocking it over in the processes. “The question is what the hell are we going to do when we’ve got the bastard surrounded. I don’t know about you, but I don’t care what the Commander has agreed to. Nobody’s gonna be there but us. If we say the Führer went down in some friendly fire, then that’s what happened.”
It was easier for him to get his papers stamped to be out late by volunteering for more patrols and other activities within his program. His sudden burst of nationalist fervor was viewed positively by his superiors as a wise attempt to make up for his physical deficiencies. Hammer had even pulled him aside at breakfast the other day and commended him for his change in attitude.
"It would be a good idea for them to wash up and change out of their travel clothes. When they've had a moment with the captain will you see that they get settled? Mathilde can show you to the room you all will sleep in." She said, gesturing toward her lady’s maid. Mathilde had generously agreed to come along with Charlotte for the duration of her journey as well as to play house keeper. She didn’t know what she would have done without the woman.
Steve sighed and let his body settle back into the mattress. Bucky always bundled himself up before sleep. He was too used to freezing at night not to, but his body ran hot and he always lost the sheets by the end of the night.
When the key was finished he waited for the children to go to their afternoon programs with the HJ and arranged for the laundry maids Vreni and Sacha to give the youngest girls a lesson in laundering, which he assured them was a skill that every sensible woman no matter what her class should know.
To Artur, Tony knew, it had to seem like the truth. First his mother, now Sam, and his father left them over and over again (for a week with no end).
“There now miss, it’s alright.” He crooned in a soothing fashion before murmuring to Tony. “I’ll carry her. I don’t mind.”
"And you know how to handle a weapon.” Bucky returned, eyes narrowing pointedly at Tony as he leaned his weight back against the doorframe. “That day we went shooting. Why’d you pretend you didn’t like guns?”
“Why didn’t you request more codeine?” She tutted, her hand ghosting over the hidden bruise on the side of his face.
“Because, believe it or not, this is dangerous work to be undertaking in a schoolroom, and something about his son tinkering around with radioactive materials might make your father nervous. You could grow eight limbs if we weren’t careful.”
. Was it the loss of a warm fire and the comfort of Tony’s presence while they ordered their thoughts into something less like a storm; or the loss of any chance of having Tony in his bed that night, and having no thoughts at all but for how to make a night go on forever?
"It’s not worth it." Tony repeated, each word intoned with finality and Steve let out the breath he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding in a slow shudder. Cautiously he took another step toward Tony, recalculating everything that they’d said to one another and this time noticing how the things unsaid seemed to shout.
"But we've got the papers. You've taken our money. Let us leave!" One man near the front of the line protested, jaw set in the kind of defiance born of true desperation, and Tony winced as the whistle blew again and the officer began urging the crowd to move by swatting at anyone with a yellow star on their jacket with his baton, all the while shouting, "Move! Germans only. Move!"
And so it seemed that despite everything, the vaunted Captain Rogers invited the Hitler Youth into his home, as eager to indoctrinate his children into the German war machine as any other loyal fascist.  It made Tony sick to think about, which even he could admit was ironic given his first impressions of the children when he’d met them. They’d marched like mini gestapo he recalled again with a wince, but that had been uncharitable. They were only children: bright ones at that, with good hearts despite growing up in a world that was telling them that cruelty was their right.
Buried in the heap of sad memories that constituted Tony’s boyhood there were happier memories of his mother. Her whispered stories and endless lists of songs and proverbs, honeyed apples to welcome in a new year ahead of the flock (a new year all their own), matzo cooked by loving hands and shared like a secret within his mother’s garden, putting him to bed with the story of Ruth because
Stefen swallowed, her words sinking in. She wasn’t saying anything he didn’t already know. The Reich expected good German’s to multiply as quickly as possible. Reluctance on his part could bring censure. Greater scrutiny.
“A weeks grounding, with no desert.” Tony’s face lit up with a smile that reached right into his eyes and Steve’s chest warmed with satisfaction. “But from now on they’re to report their plans for the day, and it’ll be worse if this sort of thing happens again. I mean it Tony.”
Perhaps it was because he had yet to ask her for a dance (at any function) and yet, not long ago he had asked Janneke Van Dyne.
“Stevie.” Bucky called, leaning into the door frame for support. Stefen looked up at him and Bucky noted that he’d been right, despite his relaxed posture Stefen was wide awake and alert.
Tony kept a watchful eye on them while the captain and Bakhuizen went to gather more wood to get them through the night. By some miracle clothes were folded and set aside for morning, teeth were cleaned, and seven bodies secured under sleeping rolls by the time that Stefen and Bakhuizen returned to feed the fire.
**Please see the changes in the tags. We've added a warning for PTSD and its symptoms because for some reason it had not occurred to us that this might be triggering.
The stiffness in Ian’s shoulders eased a little as he craned his neck to see his father.  He pushed back into Stefen's bulk, settling into the enclosure of his arms and nodded, his lips pressing into a determined line.
Ah, so that was it, Tony realized with bitter dread. Floating weapons. Didn’t it always come back to that?
“Thank you, Tacha.” Tony kissed her hand once more before letting it go, and her familiar mask of unreadability slid back into place. But there was a glint of understanding in her eyes as she nodded in reply.”
“We’re here! Péter was dead wrong. Father did send for us, just like he promised, and the trip took ages! The girls kept having to go to the bathroom even though Tony told them to go before we left and Tony says I have to share a bed with Ian but I don’t want to. Tell him I don’t have to! Ian takes all the covers and he smells bad – ”
Their stupid cake couldn’t compare to the cakes they used to eat at home, and it was silly to pretend as if it did. That’s all Tony wanted them to do, was pretend like they didn’t know things were bad and father was never coming back. And his brothers and sisters all fell for it, spending the evening playing silly games of hide and seek, singing stupid songs, and dancing like they didn’t have a care in the world.
“Has he really gone to teach somewhere else?” James asked suddenly, the beginnings of a distressed whine in his voice that given his infamously prickly attitude on the train, too Charlotte somewhat aback as he wailed, “I don’t want him to!”
He jumped when Rogers thumped a stack of carbon paper onto his desk and glared at the disruption. The last time they had served together Rogers had made a point of writing personal letters as little as possible, though now he seemed to write a letter a day as evidence by the load he was shoving under his arm.

“No, I’m sorry we’ve been so tiresome,” Ian apologized with a near squirm of embarrassment. “I wouldn’t want to be around us either. Especially James.”
Stefen the giant hypocrite kept urging Tony not to buy anything too lavish and risk spoiling the children, but Tony mostly ignored him. The man enjoyed taking care of people and he equally enjoyed spoiling his children, albeit through Tony if he had to. And it wasn’t as if Tony hadn’t noticed how long they’d lingered at the bookshop. Tony wet in thinking that Stefen would be itching to go before Tony could get even half his fill of science and medical journals, but Tony had even managed to wander into the herbology section and Stefen was still poring over the titles on naval battles and pestering the shopkeeper with questions about whether he thought the thick tombs contained content appropriate for a child.
Because something was coming. He could feel it, the same way his grand da, Ian, used to be able to feel a storm approaching.
Captain Rogers’ service in the “Howling Commandos” is one of the most well-known stories in the world. It was there, in the inter-allied commando unit, that he famously earned the moniker “Captain America”. It wasn’t until recently, thanks to declassified documents, that it became publicly known he was active in the war effort much earlier than that.
"I'm—I'm really sorry to bother you, Captain," Gwen said softly as she stepped inside. She paused as she glanced down at Tony, her already pale, drawn face going even paler. "I just—I just—"
"That's a good theory honey, but I don't see how it would be possible," said Tony. "This thing seems pretty attached to the water."
Crossing his arms into what Peter always called his Papa pose, Steve shifted on his feet, trying to force himself to think rationally, and then almost laughing at the absurdity of it. Rationality didn't really exist anymore. Not at the moment, at least. Half the world had just been snapped away by a giant purple being wearing a fancy bejewelled glove.
Peter could tell that Dad was just as rattled by all of this as Papa, but was trying very hard to not give into it, as he'd been doing pretty much ever since the attack at the lake up at the Compound. Papa had been struggling so hard for so long, and while he had been getting a bit better lately, mostly due to Uncle Sam's help, it seemed to be at a snail's pace, and Peter knew that Dad was trying everything humanly possible to avoid adding to Papa's stress.
A situation he was not going to just sit by and allow to happen just because his dads still thought he was only a kid.
"Tony, they'll be fish in a barrel inside that building," Sam said. "We've gotta try and keep the suits out in the open or else we'll have to call a Code Green, and I really don't want to have to do that."
But Steve had barely rounded the corner when the tank he was aiming for suddenly aimed its turret and fired directly at him, sending him careening into the side of the building. Steve grunted in pain as he landed smack on his face on a second-floor concrete fire escape, watching helplessly as his shield bounced over the side and dropped to the ground.
"I don't really want to leave you alone," Gwen said quietly. "When are your dads supposed to get here?"
"Ahh, you got Rhodey's new suit done yet?" Tony had already upgraded his own armour since Steve's arrest, as well as the rest of the team's equipment and increased the number of the Iron Legion suits from twelve to twenty. He wanted to make sure that the team was as well-equipped as possible when it came time to storm Steve's prison.
"Yeah, well, you look like hell too, only I wasn't gonna say anything," Tony snapped, regretting his harsh words almost instantly when Steve's shoulders sagged. "No, honey, I didn't—I didn't mean it like that."
Another slow song began once the first one was over, and Peter breathed a slight sigh of relief, tucking Gwen as close as he could without being creepy, not wanting the warmth to end.
"Oh, I'm so sorry," Peter whispered. "I can't imagine how hard that must've been for you." Then he gasped, a thought suddenly dawning on him that made all the blood in his body run cold.
"Yes, apparently I am quite popular with the children here on Midgard," said Thor through another mouthful of taco. "Something about studying Norse mythology during their schooling?"
“Yeah, gotcha.”  Tony tilted his head, pondering.  The last thing he felt like doing was dealing with the Board of Directors, who no doubt would spend the entire scheduled time whining about something or other, but since he’d already pushed off the meeting at least three times he was certain that Pepper would have his head if he attempted to do so again.  May as well get it over with while he was already grumpy.
“Well, it sure wasn’t mine,” Natasha says.  She tosses Steve a wink before taking a sip of her tea.  “So… did you see that the Economics Department hired a new assistant professor?  His bio says he only dates men, and I’d say he’s pretty cute, in a kind of nerdy, econ sort of way.  So… maybe—?”
"Okay, please let this work!" Peter muttered as he silently counted the seconds in his head, ducking his head and rolling just in time to avoid crashing into the sand covering the shore of the island. He rolled to a stop, quickly shaking the repulsors from his limbs before they could burn through his suit.
"I sure do, little guy," answered Steve. "And he says he's feeling a bit better too, thanks to all of your help."
And even then, even if they did manage to get through the rather thin atmosphere, what next? The Q-ship Tony and Peter had arrived in was as state-of-the-art as Tony had ever imagined a spaceship could be, and even it had taken several hours to get to Titan from Earth. Which meant that unless Quill's ship had a warp drive, or whatever happened to pass for one where he came from, the journey could very well take weeks to complete.
"Uh huh, Papa, I got it," Peter answered, grateful when his voice didn't wobble. The last thing his dads needed was to be worrying about him. "You don't need to worry about me."
"It's okay, honey, it's probably just a routine something-or-other to check on the status of the Damage Control stuff," Tony said, not too convincingly when Steve's frown grew even deeper.
"Well, not sure if I can help too much with that one," Steve said with a grin. He took the glasses from Tony's hand, placing them gently on the coffee table before offering Tony his arm. "Shall we?"
"We're gonna get him back, Pete, I promise," Dad had said. "You just gotta hang in there for us, okay?"
"JARVIS—!" Tony gasped, intending to summon his armour just as Bucky came through the door. He hurried behind Peter and wrapped his arms around him, pinning his arms to his sides and whispering something that Tony couldn't quite catch into his ear. Peter screamed again, struggling for a few more seconds before finally going limp in Bucky's arms. Bucky hesitated for a moment, then gave Tony a nod as he carefully cradled Peter's bloody arm.
Settling in on his side, Tony moved his hand to cup Peter's cheek, his thumb brushing along his cheekbone as he kissed his forehead. He and Steve had washed Peter's hair earlier that day, and the smell of his shampoo had permeated into the bedding, making the entire bed smell like green apples. Closing his eyes, Tony breathed in, allowing the comforting scent to wash over him like a soft breeze.
"Now, see?" Tony murmured once they were back in bed, curled up together with Steve's head tucked against Tony's chest. "That didn't end up being too horrible, did it?"
Peter turned away before he could say anything else, too afraid that Gwen would guess what he was planning to do. Dad and Papa had always told him that he was a terrible liar, which he supposed was a good thing. But it wasn't going to help him tonight.
"Yeah, I'm fine," Peter said, ducking as Uncle Bucky aimed at another suit at least twenty metres away, landing a perfect shot between the thing's neck and shoulder. "Where's Papa, did you guys find him yet?"
With a heavy sigh, Tony loosened the tie from around his neck and unbuttoned the top button of his shirt, lolling his head in the direction of the decanter of whisky tucked over in the corner, the amber liquid a dark shadow against the lower third of the fancy container. It was on nights like these when his cravings were the worst, when his fingers practically itched to hold the glass and he could almost taste the whisky on his tongue, burning its way down his throat and sending warmth blooming across his chest. But Tony hadn't had a single hard drink since Peter's emergency trip to the hospital back when he was three years old, and he wasn't about to now, no matter how badly he wanted it. If this cockamamie plan of his was going to have any possible chance of success then he couldn't afford to slip up.
"There may be no dreams in the nothing, Птер, but that doesn't mean they won't be waiting for you when you come back," said Bucky. "And you need to want those dreams gone! You need to chase them away so they never come back! Before I did this, my dreams were the worst that I've ever had. Images of what I was all folding in on each other. Every single person I killed flashing across my eyes like a moving picture. I see everything that I tried so hard to forget. Torture. Slaughter. And training others to do the same. So much blood, so much horror that I would wake up vomiting, but it never helped. None of it helped until I was free! And I want you to be free!"
“Which is exactly how Dr Erskine would've wanted it,” Steve rasped.  His discussions with the slight, kindly German-American doctor may have been few due to his gruesome murder by HYDRA, but Steve had still been able to glean enough information in those discussions to know that Dr Erskine would have never wanted his serum formula to fall into anyone’s hands who he deemed less than trustworthy.
He would have to find something else.  Some other method of release so he didn't end up being consumed from the inside out.
And since he’s barely keeping up with the bills as it is, he just can’t afford to waste money like that.  Every extra penny Steve has goes towards paying down Ma’s lingering debt, which means he’ll wait until he can get to CVS later to avoid paying the extra three or so dollars for his bottle of OTC pain medication because that’s three more dollars that he can put towards the debts.
"Oh my God," Steve choked out as one of the soldiers stepped back, revealing his beloved boy. The image Peter's back was arched up off the table, his arms and legs straining against the restraints and his sweet face screwed into an expression of almost unimaginable pain. Next to Steve, Peter gave a soft cry at the sight, instinctively shrinking back and squeezing Tony's hand so hard that he yelped in pain.
"That's an affirmative!" Joseph called as he banked slightly to his left, attempting to achieve a missile lock. His thumb was trembling as it hovered over the trigger, his jaw clenched so tightly that his teeth were rattling as his display switched from red to green and the lock tone echoed throughout the canopy.
But he couldn't. Like it or not, Project Phoenix had now become like the proverbial snowball rolling down the hill, growing and gaining speed as it went.
Arriving back at the palace, around which stood several groups of women and children all chanting and sobbing, Steve stepped onto the parked Quinjet to find Clint sitting on one of the back bench seats, holding a crying Pietro in his arms. As soon as he noticed Steve, Clint tapped Pietro's shoulder and straightened his back, likely intending to prep the jet for takeoff, when Steve stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
Bucky's blue eyes gleamed mischievously. "Aw, now c'mon honey, you always say that your money is our money and my money is our money, so—"
And once we do, we're gonna kick HYDRA's ass so hard that they'll regret ever trying to hook their claws into any of us. All right?"
"I'm not gonna be scared," Peter said, rather petulantly. "I'm not scared of bullies, Dad. Not even HYDRA ones."
"Steve… baby, please move," Tony whimpered, rolling his hips up and causing Steve to gasp. He bent his head to gently kiss him and then propped himself up on his elbows, not breaking their eye contact as he started to move. His heart skittered at the sight of Tony beneath him, so incredibly beautiful with his glistening face twisted in ecstasy and his lower lip caught between his teeth, that Steve almost wished he could pause for a moment and sketch a picture, or even just snap a quick photograph so he could forever capture this image of his gorgeous husband. He had an entire sketchbook that he kept hidden away in his sock drawer that was filled with various drawings of Tony. Working in his lab, lounging on their bed, and many of the two of them just as they were now, naked, their bodies joined together. But he had yet to capture to his satisfaction the exact moment when Tony broke apart, the exact moment when he completely surrendered himself to Steve.
"Oh!" Steve murmured as he watched his little boy self and his beloved ma walk into the five and dime about two blocks from their home, the memories hitting him like a blast to the chest. The month was June, and Steve had just completed the first grade with straight A's on his report card and a commendation from his teacher on Steve's polite demeanour and attention during class. To celebrate, and at the suggestion of the teacher, Ma had offered to take him to the store for some new art supplies, as his hand-me-downs from Bucky's ma were starting to run low.
“So you just felt like barging in here because you had something on your mind?” Bakhuizen barked and feeling the man’s dark glower Tony turned toward him and met him with a frank stare.
To his surprise Natacha shrugged her shoulders, something graceful about the motion but as unaffected as her tone as she replied, "He is only a year or two older than father, and father was not much older than I am when he met my mother."
He shifted his stiff arms a bit and ran a hand across the wood frame of his cot. Sometimes it helped, tapping out a tune he knew by heart. It took him somewhere else when the prisoners where allowed nothing but the oppressive silence that hung over them every waking moment.
"You made yourself quite clear." Stefen replied after a long beat, and the roughness in his voice sent a shiver up Tony's spine. Right then. So much for laying low and self preserving.
“Yes." she continued gently." After your father and I have married we’ll all be leaving for Switzerland. It will be an adventure.”
Well most times. Sometimes he didn’t, like when Tony had told him not to leave. He couldn’t listen then because he was a soldier and that’s just what they did. It was wrong of him, but Ian still wished he could trade. He wouldn’t mind if Da was in a bad mood or was quick to snap at them all if it meant he could be there.
“I’m not my best when I drink. And here I had all these grand plans to show you the art of lovemaking.”
Shame flushed through him. What would father think, Ian not wanting to comfort his crying baby sister?
“Knock it off Johann. You’re being an ass” he heard himself say before he’d even decided and Johann had fallen silent, more out of surprise than rebuke. Harry had laughed out loud and clapped him on the back.
But Coulson just sat there, holding the thing, daring them to believe it with his silence and Tony shivered, a feeling of dread prickling over his skin.
"Christ Mary and Joseph," he cursed, pulling his mouth away. His eyes welled up with tears, mouth screaming from the heat. Bucky gagged into his arm with a grimace. God damn it. What did she do, he wondered, empty a whole bottle of pepper in the thing?
The food helped to energize Tony at first but about an hour or so later the cold had seeped into his bones again, bringing with it a heavy exhaustion that begged for sleep. He found himself nodding once, then twice, jerking back to alertness at the sound of feet scuffing in the doorframe of the cockpit as Bucky ducked inside.
Steve narrowed his eyes, his fingers digging into Tony’s hip-bones as his grip tightened, and Tony had one moment to think
!” he beamed at them. The sweetness of their voices raised in song was almost as pleasing as the pride brimming in their eyes at his praise as they finally achieved perfect harmony.
“I’m sure, Dr. Erskine will be along...” He stopped, too winded to continue, but attempting to look as if speaking had not done just that. “I’m sure he’ll be here any...”
When Tony walked up, tired wrinkled and wet it was to catch the hems of Natacha and Maria’s nightgowns slipping through the boy’s bedroom door. Curios, Tony approached as quietly as he could to peek through the door they’d left slightly ajar.
“I didn’t even stop. They were everywhere she said,” voice trembling near the end. “The gestapo were stopping every passerby, checking every passenger. There’s no way.”
“Let me.” Bakhuizen reaching for the plate and Tony frowned at him. To his relief the captain moved the plate away, shaking his head with the hint of a grin as his friend scowled at him.
Any other monk might have died of shock, hearing an Abbot use such language but Fil didn’t so much as bat an eyelash, except for the tiny upward twitch of the corner of one lip.
Four went down in quick succession. The fifth shot Dvorak twice, but not before one side of Schmidt’s face lit up like a red firecracker and the general crumpled to the ground. Bucky could see that he was still moving, even though one side of his skull was a red fleshy mangled mess. Dying and no longer a threat, so Bucky forgot him and shot the last remaining soldier before he could finish turning in his direction.
“Oh Captain, my Captain.” He departed with a cheeky wink and a smart salute, gratified at the annoyed huff of breath he heard Stefen release as he shut the door behind him.
“It’s been almost three years.” Péter shrugged, though there was nothing convincingly careless in the gesture. The boy was stiff and he seemed no longer able to look at him, his hand unconsciously gripping the comforter and twisting. “Artur barely remembers her... Maria and Sara will never really know her. James remembers more but I think that just makes him mad. He was younger than Maria when she got sick. He used to go in her room all the time even though Father told us not to bother her.”
Steve had barely spoken to anyone in days. First there had been the expulsion of the Polish Jews, then Péter’s disappearance, and now the country was in an uproar once again, since a Jewish teenager had shot a German diplomat over in Paris. Those with enough charity whispered rumors that it was because his parents had been among the Jews ejected from the country, now suffering in the border camps. Most echoed the sentiments shared in the broadcasts over civilian radio and in the papers, that the shooting had been an organized attack by an international Jewish threat.
The girl’s fall seemed to have shaken something loose in James. Rather than take heed to their warnings to slow down he used the rest of the time to cycle in loops around them like a mad thing, weaving in and out of their line like a drunk and challenging Péter and Ian at every turn now that they refused to race. Tony could see Péter losing patience very quickly and he wasn’t the only one. Tony was more than a little grateful when the edges of town came into sight.
Could he sleep in a bed with Captain Rogers even with a small child between them and not give away the fact that where Stefen was concerned he was entirely compromised?
“This is amazing Tony.” Péter breathed out in awe. “Do you really think something like this could ever be real?”
"No one to make sure they were eating, no way to bathe, no one to give a damn what was happening to them." The monk continued to berate in a scathing tone. "Surely if there is a god in heaven he would beg us to show them more kindness? If he won't then I will. Stefen, if not for their sake then for the sake of your own children, I implore you to do better."
"How many extra robes will you need?" Farkas asked, frowning slightly when Tony held up three fingers. "There are only two brothers Rossi is expecting to collect. We claim that it was three, that is one thing. Five is a risk."
“Ah hell,” Second Lieutenant Frank Becker cursed inwardly. They were four miles into their hike and the good Major had sped up the pace. Again. At this rate they were making double time look like a leisurely stroll.
He and Bucky shared a look, thinking the same thing. It had surprised them both, how quickly British parliament had rallied to lend aid to the refugees and get people on the ground in Poland. Almost unheard of. Monty and Hill did everything they could to work with the intelligence Steve and his team provided for them, but bureaucracy often tied their hands. It was frustrating when everything in Steve’s body screamed that they should be doing more to help.
Tony sighed, turning the page of his book even though he barely recalled what he’d read. It was just a damn shame, that Stefen had never experienced the full flush that the twenties had offered. Back when the music and culture that Tony had discovered in the red-light districts as a young man had burst into the public eye in full color. The strange and the unusual holding their heads up proudly and strutting across the world stage in defIance while the world looked on in awe.
He should have left. Too late now. He was always too late. He should have tried harder. He should have seen… he should have… he slumped, his thoughts blurring together.
“I know you don’t want me to know but I do. The wolves are real but there is no huntsman coming to cut us out of the belly of the beast. I know life isn’t a fairytale, but I thought if I had a choice, I’d rather be the man with the axe than the girl in the red hood.” She finished with conviction, her eyes narrowed on him with defiance, daring him to challenge her justifications.
Four. Five. Six. Steve's chest sagged toward the floor as he struggled to catch his breath. His chest burned, but his arms weren't shaking yet and that was an improvement over the last few days.
