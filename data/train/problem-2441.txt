Sabine snorted, baring her teeth for a moment at the childish nickname before looking back at Teal. “Did you mess up our door?”
Mira swallowed hard, like she was keeping back a noise. And she was shaking again, enough that she had to brace herself to keep herself upright. Dean could feel himself spiraling down that way, although Mick had helped with that. Now it was back to a simmer instead of boiling over. But he could feel the next one, right at the back of his teeth waiting for the next slip, and then he’d explode.
Castiel found himself flaring his wings in response, unsure if they were attempting to match, but it was wonderous. The Righteous Man was so bright, glowing even after forty years in hell.
He shook his head, taking a hurried step away from Castiel. They needed Lucifer to beat the Darkness, but he didn’t want to be shoved into that space again.
There was a flutter of wings, Dean and Mira jumping back as Miracle appeared between Dean and Teal in the shape of a starling. The daemon darted over to Teal, knocking up against him. “Teal! They’re back!”
He slumped back in the seat, choosing to look over at where Mira was curled up instead of the meadow. It had seemed like the better idea, a safer one.
Mira was croaking out a desperate “Don’t do this” filled with his rage and fear. And Dean was following her, pulled along by her hurt. “Not to us.”
“Not completely.” His gaze drifted over to where Dean was sitting, catching the scowl on his face as he tried to figure out what the two of them were talking about. “Not all of him.”
“That’s the important parts.” Teal lifted his shoulders and opened his wings in a shrug. “Unless Sam or Kelly left something out.”
Dean made an uncertain noise, leaning back against the railing as he stared at the door. “What do you think, Mira?”
Dean curled his fingers into Mira’s fur one last time before stepping up to the van. He gave the raven a long look, finding himself looking for some sign of pain. He knew how to read Sabine and Gisila. Knowing what mood Adina had been in meant that he would be able to read his father’s mood faster.
He pressed his fingers more tightly against the angel tablet, feeling Teal mimic the motion, his claws digging into him. And there it was again, the longing. Which made it all the more important that the two of them take care of the angel tablet while they could. It would be one less thing for the Winchesters to worry about, and it would be harder to catch an angel.
Dean didn’t get or hear the warning because Mira heard him practically whine out Cas’ name before he came, Mira’s leg twitching hard with the sensation.
Castiel blinked, turning the words over in his head and the tone of voice before things slipped back into place. That wasn’t something that was in his head alone, it was spoken.
Mira gave the carpet a glare before rubbing her face against it again. Softer would be better, covers would be better. Feathers would be the best.
They snatched them back, tucking the limbs between their rings and out of danger, but their eyes did not wander. They were fixed on the Righteous Man and the wolf.
Castiel gave Dean and Mira one last look, trying not to stare too much at the absentminded stroke of Dean’s hand over her head and onto her neck before spreading his wings and taking flight.
Cas didn’t seem to notice, he was back to glaring at the book. “I don’t…Aside from the choice to name their daughter’s daemon for a woman tortured because she didn’t want to have sex and is often depicted with her breasts on a plate, I don’t see the connection.”
The Mark pulsed on his arm, reminding him of easier ways. He could simply kill them all, or allow himself to slip back to being a demon when all of that didn’t matter. Besides, Mira would have been able to haul them down to Hell with impunity. Crowley might have been annoyed, but there was very little he wouldn’t allow Dean to do.
Teal clacked his beak at her, Rowena making a motion that would have been a finger stroking down his beak in a reprimand if they had touched. “None of your sass. The angel has enough of it for the two of you.”
He grimaced, curling his fingers into it. What he wanted to do was snarl at the feeling, but he squashed the urge. He wasn’t a demon anymore, he was human.
Castiel glanced back at where Mira was strolling over, the corner of his mouth quirking up. “Well that makes two of us.”
Teal walked along the front of the van, not seemed to care about the hood that was above him or the engine block on the other side. He settled himself just above one of the headlights, head titled to the side. “Yes, inside. Is that a problem?”
There was no accusation, but Mira still felt the bite of one. They were happy like this, happy with them. And then they were happy at Gas N’ Sip with their human life. It wouldn’t be fair to bounce them back and forth.
Dean took a deep breath, the words catching in his throat. He wanted to say that she was wrong, because it had felt worse than all of the torture that Alistair had used on them when he had taken Mira. It had been horrible like an electric shock when it had happened with monsters. But not like this, not something gaping and open that wouldn’t close no matter how much alcohol he drank or punches he threw. This was drowning.
She dropped her head to rest on her paws, struggling to keep her focus on the conversation instead of what she desperately wanted to do. “It’s fine. Dean won’t hurt him.”
Teal banked around him, backwinging to clear the bees before landing on his shoulder. Castiel didn’t watch the raven, but he did watch Dean and Mira tracking him. Mira’s tail drooped as soon as Teal settled, the wolf huffing as she leapt up into the front seat and sat down.
. That was enough to get her moving, Mira almost tempted to lean down to give him a shove of his own, just to see if he would hold his ground or allow her that. But Dean’s hand was an open invitation, and she needed grounding.
Then Cas was letting the keys roll into his palm, nodding slowly. “Yes, this leads to the lockup with Heaven’s most powerful weapons.”
“Yes.” Teal nodded, although it seemed to be more to convince himself than them. “We have been able to be on separate continents at the same time.”
He clenched his hand on Mira, realizing that he had taken far too long to react. Dean forced himself to chuckle, aware that it sounded off at wrong. “Cas, you don’t get to choose.”
Teal hopped off of his shoulder to circle the box, bobbing slightly as he looked at the swirling carvings that had been done on the edges. They were Celtic looking, their intricate knotwork running along the side. Castiel took a step closer, freezing when he saw what was on the top.
Dean stared at him, trying to wrap his head around the concept. He didn’t know how normal humans and daemons worked, not in depth. From everything that he had heard, it was still something that was being discussed and tested. It was the kind of thing that Sam was interested in. Dean didn’t need anything more than Mira at his side, solid and there.
He smoothed a hand down her back, hiding the shake in it in her fur. “Probably a fish considering how many of the damn things he had in his trailer.” He rocked back slightly, looking at Cas out of the corner of his eye. “Did I ever tell you they gave Sam the fluffiest damn cat in the history of cats as a daemon?”
Cas gave him a long look before dropping his head. Dean thought he saw a hint of a wry smile, but he was distracted by the way that Teal was inching closer.
Dean slumped forward, bracing his arms against the steering wheel. It felt like Mira was sprawled on his chest. It was struggling to rise and fall, to drag air in. It felt like he was drowning, and the world smelled of smoke again.
“Look, things don’t go that well for us. And I’d like to be sure you’re not dead so we can track down the spawn of Satan.”
Dean grinned and dropped down to sit on the roof of the bunker. The concrete was warm underneath him, which was probably why Mira looked like she was trying to burrow into it herself. He really should have brought up a blanket so she didn’t scrape one side free of fur. He reached over to grab onto one of her paws, shaking it until she was playfully nipping towards his fingers.
He didn’t expect Rowena to reach out at pat his arm companionably. “I know. Why do you think I never went back to see Fergus for centuries? Everyone runs from hurt.”
Dean dropped his gaze to the ashes, his breath catching in his throat as he looked down at them. Cas and Teal deserved better than being kept in a mason jar for the rest of all time.
She lifted her head to watch it, waiting until Dean had it tucked securely against him to stand up. She stepped out of the car, coming to stand by his side. Mira bumped against him once before putting the distance between the two of them.
That got some of her hackles to settle. She was swinging her tail by the time that Teal looked back over at her. She yawned, which seemed to be laying it on a little thick. Dean raised an eyebrow, not that Mira seemed to care. She just ducked her head and stretched her forelegs out. “You know, for beings of light and wrath, I expected it to be warm. Michael was freezing cold.” Mira stretched out a paw. “Teal’s warm.”
His attention snapped back when Dean went to shake him. Castiel allowed one shake before going to resist, earning something like a growl from Dean. “You were dying. You gave the big damn speech and everything.”
“Cas…” Dean was still working out if he was going to give a warning or flirt, even if he didn’t feel
Sam and Sabine were wading their way in with Bobby and his lioness daemon close behind. Dean had never caught her name, he’d just been thinking about her as Gisila, but larger. Looking at her now Dean could still feel the frisson of unease, something that was bound to get Mira’s hackles up. That and the fact that part of their numbers had just doubled.
Slowly, as if it took all of the energy he had left, Dean let go of his coat, but he didn’t take a step back. “Cas, you hardly let me out of your sight after you got us back from that Magisterium facility.”
Mira froze, Dean watching out of her corner of his eye as her hackles rose. He scooted back from the edge, getting himself a little bit out of the line of sight. But the roof didn’t leave them very much cover.
Dean slowly dropped his hand, Teal following it down. He was distantly aware of clinging to Mira, not that the wolf complained. A touch to Mira was expected, common now because he was often perching on her shoulders until he needed to take flight. It was special because she trusted him on her back where his beak and claws could do damage and where he could easily reach from her neck. She trusted him to cling even though he could decide to fly and take her away from Dean. He could do thousands of things to her, he had done them. And he was allowed on her back.
He reached up to run the back of his hand along Teal’s wing as he turned back to Dean. “What about Sam and Mary?”
Teal stared at Mira before shaking his head. “Not those times no. But when we said yes, it did.” He flexed his claws deeper into her fur. “I didn’t belong there anymore.”
They bunched together before a shape slid out of them, forming out of smoke and sparks of baleful red light. It resolved into the shape of a cat, the specific markings for the animal taking longer to return, but the cat was already in motion by then.
There shouldn’t have brought such a big rush of pleasure from Teal, Castiel watching as his daemon fluffed up his feathers further. He sighed, glaring at Dean. “You’re not helping.”
“Cas.” He looked up, aware that it had happened again from the frustrated look on Dean’s face. He had drifted between his regrets and the bees. At least it hadn’t led to him falling back into Sam’s memories of Hell.
Dean huffed and rolled his eyes, but Cas had a point. There hadn’t been a daemon in the house, nor any signs of one in the pictures or in any of the things that Cain had around. Even before the bunker he’d had an old quilt that he’d found at a Goodwill that he and Mira had ended up sharing. In his duffle there was a brush, a set of nail clippers and a toothbrush for her. Dean was sure that anyone could look at the bunker and see signs that at least one daemon lived there. There had only been Cain in the farmhouse, and Dean had enough experience to guess where his daemon had gone.
He curled his fingers into a fist, carefully pulling his hand back. What he should say, what he meant to say, and what he wanted to say tangled around his tongue and into the back of his throat. Worse still was the flash of disappointment that he felt from Mira. She let go of his shirt, padding around to the other side of him so she could sprawl within reach of Teal, but the raven didn’t take her up on the offer. He just kept staring at Dean, his expression mostly a dare. Dean didn’t dare look up at Cas, just in case the expression matched because he didn’t trust himself not to react if it was there.
And then he was falling, spiraling into nightmares of the cage. The chill of it all, the way it seemed to extend forever and still enclose him to the point where he couldn’t fly away. Worse of all was the screaming.
Teal wasn’t bound to Cas the same way she was bound to Dean. They were more like Sam and Sabine, able to separate from each other without pain.
Tired was there all the time, it had been there for a while. Disappointment, guilt, regret. All par for the course, nothing new in anything.
He shuffled a little bit away from where Castiel was groaning and started to get up, stretching his wings. Castiel might be able to fill him in on the rest while things were still fuzzy. Teal frowned, lifting his wings up as high as they would go.
Dean grabbed at Mira’s fur, only distantly registering that it was in the awkward space between her neck and chest. He didn’t need to ask why, because being a demon was freeing, it was having nothing to tie you down. A daemon did, it was restrictive, it was who you had been before. But he had called Mira back twice all the same.
Castiel glanced over at where Teal was perched on Mira’s leg, his eyes and the edges of his feathers glowing blue-white with grace. Teal swayed close, dangerously close to touching Dean where Mira was sprawled across him, but then he and Mira were falling to the ground, Teal still clinging to her foreleg. Mira was quick to curl around him, making sure that he wouldn’t go tumbling away before looking at him. “Teal, Cas, you with us?”
Cas paused in his reading, making a frustrated sound. That was enough to send Teal skittering over to peer at the book, the raven quick to echo the noise.
Sabine backed away, falling into step with her as the two of them went back into the bunker. Dean followed them, Teal twisting around to look at him and then at the raven sized dent in the door. “I’ll fix it, later.”
Mira flattened her ears, shooting him a panicked look that Dean didn’t know how to smooth over. Animals didn’t talk, that was a given in both worlds. Mira had been keeping quiet as a precaution, but they had blown that because they had thought this was Cas. They had thought that they were safe. Dean glanced over at Sam, what little remaining thought he had flickering out to nothing when he felt the bird resettle itself so its claws were digging into his arms.
Teal might have said more, but Dean lost it in the last whoosh of his breath, in the bond between him and his daemon pulled to the point of pain and the raven that was looking at him for answers that he didn’t have.
He rocked back slightly, startling when Cas rested a hand on his shoulder. Dean turned to see Cas crouched by his side, gently pushing the hand Dean had there aside. He peered at the shoulder, reaching down to grab a hold of Dean’s arm to manipulate it slightly.
She stepped away from the bed, padding across the carpet to the far side of the room. She followed the wall up to the corner before turning around and stalking back. Her gaze flicked over to the door, locked, salted and warded, and then back to Cas. Asleep, breathing.
Teal had grabbed a hold of Mira’s scruff, easily pulling the wolf over and down to the ground where she was lying in a twitching daze. Teal was perched on top of her, a tuft of fur and scruff still held in one foot while he rubbed his face against Mira’s neck.
Castiel was tempted to pull on their connection, to see if Teal was daemon enough that he was restricted to the impossibility of feelings only, and not sensation. It should have been shared once, but now he wasn’t sure. Even more pressing, Cas wasn’t sure that if it would count as breaking the taboo.
The last was to the daemons, although Castiel wasn’t sure which one. He watched to see who would react, but Mira didn’t look like she was in any frame of mind to answer. Teal had slid from on top of her to tucked underneath her chin and held in place with one leg. Teal looked a bit smug, although the raven did duck his head. Castiel doubted that it was with guilt, or in any acknowledgement of what Dean had said.
Dean licked his lips, casting his gaze to the ceiling. Thankfully, Mira answered for him. “Agathe is a girl, like Claire.”
Mira peeled her lips back in a silent snarl, one of the ones that would have had John and Adina eyeing her, but not bring Adina over to remind her of her manners. That wasn’t enough to calm what was digging at her. This was something that needed to be fought or fucked out, but neither was an option. Motion was what was left.
“Neither will Cas.” Teal jerked at that, twisting to look back at where Cas was sleeping. Mira inched closer to him, knocking her paw against his foot. "Teal, you’ve gotta be careful with him now. He’s human.”
He looked up as the snarling stopped, watching as Mira took a step away from where the Empty was flowing across the floor towards her. She raised one paw, and then she was running the two strides to Cas and jumping.
There was a pause, long enough for Teal to start filling in a series of logical and illogical things that could have gotten in the bunker. Teal didn’t spiral long before he heard Mira shouting back into the bunker.
“Just, back.” She shuffled sideways a few steps, glancing around before tensing and bracing herself. Dean didn’t have the time to ask what she was doing before she shaking hard.
Teal shook himself, crouching on the hood of the Impala. His feathers had settled, but there was still something there, a thread of feeling. The fact that it was there at all was surprising, because it wasn’t supposed to be there. Angels didn’t have feelings. Grace shaped into the form of a raven didn’t have feelings. And yet there was something there, and it was leaking down a connection that should not be there.
He realized that he had been reaching up, his hand hovering close to Dean’s wrist. He had wanted to close his hand around there, to feel skin and the leap of Dean’s pulse. Instead, he reached up to tug his tie loose, pulling it just enough that it slithered out from under his collar and to the ground.
Teal leaned forward to the point where he was nearly tumbling onto the bed, and wouldn’t that be interesting. Mira wagged her tail, ignoring the glance that Teal shot her way. “Something is wrong with Mira.”
Dean fought against the urge to check the Mark under his hand. He was aware that the urge to kill was coming more often, but he hadn’t been keeping track of the time between them. Then again, he shouldn’t have been surprised that Cas had. He could probably tell the time in milliseconds from one breaking point to the next.
Mira dropped low, slinking past the foot of the bed and over towards the kitchenette and table. She flicked an ear over toward the sound of Dean’s chair creaking as he shifted.
Dean dragged his hand down his face, sighing almost explosively. “Still not on firing on all cylinders.”
“Yeah…” Mira tore her gaze away, watching as Dean rolled so he was facing away from her. He settled, but nothing else did, rushing back and forth along their bond until she was dizzy with it. She knew what this meant, they had done this hundreds of time, but only a few people had come with this longing. It made her want to shake again, just until the almost buzzing was gone from her skin. “Cas-”
Mira grunted, Dean glancing over to see her with her forelegs on the table, staring at a book. Teal had shifted from her shoulders to perch on her head. His position had him sliding forward, forcing one eye closed. She would have snapped at Sabine for that, but she allowed it from Teal. It brought back the tingle in the tips of his fingers and the memory of Teal from ages ago when he was still more like an angel’s daemon than he was now and the open offer to touch because it wouldn’t break the taboo. That was familiar hunger, but at least it was his own.
It wasn’t a question, but there was the expectation that Dean would treat it like one. And he should, because it was important if it was coming up in dealing with the Mark, but he had turned to stare at Mira and she had done the same. They had reached the same conclusion before, but it had been easy enough to ignore because the obvious explanation because it was the answer for everything in their lives.
He tapped his knuckles against the side of the car, weighing up his chances to just get away with it, to do something that wasn’t about trying to hold the world together when there was a flap of wings.
Castiel tore his gaze away as Dean grabbed him by the shoulder and hauled him close. “So, all of that and you’re just going to fly off?”
“Hey Teal,” Dean stepped back in, treated to a slight tip of the raven’s head but Teal didn’t bother to break his stare with Mira. “Where’s Cas?”
Teal’s gaze slid over to her, but he didn’t say anything, which made her bristle more. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. It was supposed to be them, Cas and Teal like it always was. Of course they might be angry, but there had been time, and they had to know that Sammy and Beanie came first. They always had, they always would.
It should have been clear then that Naomi was not preparing him well, because she didn’t know them. She didn’t know that Mira hadn’t let the first hellhound reach Dean when his deal had come due. The second had barely made it, and only because it had savaged her half to death first. Broken taboo or not, she would have stood in front of Dean and stopped him.
Dean watched as Mira dropped her head back, his daemon meeting his gaze one last time before she twisted. Mira arched awkwardly in Cas’ hold, pressing her paws into his stomach to be able to haul herself up to his shoulder so she could bite down.
Teal seemed to be contemplating the same thing, eyeing the distance before he settled again. This time it was more like a daemon, a fluttering of wings and fluffing up of feathers.
She scrambled fruitlessly for a moment more before she seemed to remember how her legs worked. Then she was pulling herself out of the ground with almost painful effort.
His daemon cut a swath through the grass, Dean following her path exactly. He supposed it was the only other trail that was made other than where the deer would wander through. It felt wrong doing much beyond that. It was bad enough that they were doing this, messing this place up for Cas.
He snapped out of his thoughts, staring back at Teal as the raven perched on the van. He was nearly angel-still, like the other daemons of the vessels. But Dean could see moments when that broke, a twitch of a wing or tail, the way that he shifted on the van.
Her nails clicked softly over the linoleum, Mira watching the bulge move, the light from the parking lot throwing Teal into shadow behind the curtain. That wasn’t quite right though, he might be black but Mira was more used to seeing the wash of colors over his feathers as he turned.
“We don’t see through each other’s eyes. Not anymore.” Teal glanced away, focusing instead on a stray bit of fur that Mira hadn’t shed away. He swayed forward, tempted to pluck it away, but that was just a distraction. “But yes, the last time we were here, we were Lucifer’s vessel.”
The wolf took a gasping breath, freeing her legs with uncoordinated jerks to claw at the grass. It was not what they expected, and they drifted in a close circle around the clearing, their eyes turning inward to watch the wolf.
There had been an agreement. Lucifer offered his help to destroy the Darkness, but he needed a vessel. They couldn’t let Sam go through it again, and Dean couldn’t. It had made sense.
The peaceful moment only lasted for a moment longer, the Righteous Man levering himself up from the ground. His daemon followed him, shaking herself off. She pressed against his leg, the Righteous Man dropping his hand down to rest on her again. The strange urge returned, Castiel ignoring it in favor of drifting along after the two of them.
Cas came over to the side of the table, picking up one of the books to stare at the spine. It obviously wasn’t what he was looking for because he sighed and set it back down. “Find anything?”
There was a scratch of claws on the ground, the pattern not Mira’s. Dean was proven right when he heard the annoyed clack of Teal’s beak. “Then why are you up here?”
Castiel turned, pausing at the sense of longing. He was used to the flavor of Dean and Mira’s longing, but this was new. He tipped his head, eying Teal before sighing, shouldering that too as he followed the bees.
The raven didn’t move from Cas’ shoulder, suddenly going back to the way that he had been initially, motionless. He tipped his head, the iridescence in his feathers rippling gently through green and gold. Those were Mira’s colors,
And then his hand slid into her mouth, and he saw the flash of determination in her eyes a moment before she bit down. Hard.
He swallowed the sensation back down, although Mira still bristled slightly with it. She braced herself better on the table, staring to lean towards Cas before she corrected herself.
“Disappointment isn’t a lack of care.” Cas threw an arm over his face. “I don’t know what it is. It’s too late for this.”
She flattened her ears back, just stopping herself from growling. She didn’t want Dean’s attention for this, because it was easily solved. Besides, Dean had ganked the bitch, so that problem was solved. April had no place here, it was just them.
Dean glanced over at Mira, watching as she slid back down to the floor, withdrawing from the conversation. He dropped his hand, but he didn’t expect her to come back over. He could feel her shutting down, bracing for what would follow like she had since she had settled as a wolf. They’d been called to the principal’s office in every new school or had people call Lisa to make sure that the man with the wolf daemon really was allowed to pick up Ben.
Dean was the first to move, Castiel was sure of that, but he knew that he was barely behind him. The only thing that slowed him was Dean cupping his cheek with the hand not on his arm. Castiel didn’t know the point of that, although he was not about to demand that Dean move it away. He would probably fight if Dean did.
“No.” Cas frowned slightly, pushing a bit harder before taking his hand away. He squinted at Dean’s shoulder like it had personally offended him. “At the moment of rebuilding you and Mira were perfect. A second later this joint decided to rebel. I shouldn’t have been surprised.”
He took gasping breaths until the feeling had eased, but it wasn’t gone. It would never be gone. But at least he could lift his head.
Behind them, Cas choked on something that sounded like a scream. Mira felt the edge of pain-pleasure from Dean, lifting her head from Teal to shoot them an amused glance, her tongue lolling.
He was momentarily distracted by the sun off of the raven’s feathers. Ravens in nature had iridescence as a consequence of the makeup of their feathers, platelets within the barbs interacting with the air in the feather. The ones he had seen were in purples and blue, but Teal broke into a rainbow of color, unbound by the platelets and air in his feathers, changing with position and location, and range in the spectrum. Castiel was sure that some of the colors on his tail feathers at the moment could only be seen by shrimp. But he wasn’t really a raven, he wasn’t really a daemon. He was much more like Cas, something that could have been an angel, but wasn’t.
Dean looked down, easily picking out Gabriel by Rowena’s bright hair in close proximity. The group he’d had with him was already scattering, a few kids running for their parents with clumsy daemons fluttering or running in a myriad of shapes as they changed constantly. The adults were slower, their daemons occasionally coming to a hard stop when they reached too far ahead, like they had been told a limit and were watching it carefully.
Castiel stared at them, concerned by how they had moved without their permission. It could be the exhaustion from Hell or from the rebuilding. He had singes to his grace that he hadn’t healed completely to save his efforts for the more important mission, but that wouldn’t explain their eagerness.
“I wasn’t. I was here.” Teal took a deep breath, letting it out in a sigh. “Lucifer doesn’t like daemons, he considers them inferior. His temporary vessel-”
Dean sucked in a deep breath, darting a glance over at Mira. His daemon had gone still. Her tail rose stiffly, clearly unsure about the offer. Because that was what it was. It was an offer, it was permission, and Dean didn’t know what to think about it.
Cool looking feathers or not, weird angel thing or not, Teal still looked like a daemon, was created in the place of a daemon. His permission was well and good, but there was Cas to consider.
Then again, he and Castiel never wanted to be that far from them either. And yet, they had never managed it.
And Castiel was still smiling, and Teal was still black, green, and gold. It made Dean want to shake them, to do something to stop this. But the knocking was continuing, the door shaking now as the sigil started to fade.
Ninety pounds of wolf hit Cas in the chest, the angel swaying a bit in surprise at the weight, but he didn’t waver from where he stood. Dean sucked in a breath as Cas automatically wrapped his arms around Mira, holding her to keep her from falling. But it didn’t feel like Alistair or Ishim or the monsters that had ever gotten a hold of her. It didn’t feel like a violation, it felt so right that it punched the breath out of Dean. His hands tightened on Teal, feeling the raven go still with a soft sound of disbelief.
It was tempting to go over to him and lean against the Impala. Or maybe lean into Dean and coax him into another kiss. Maybe press him back into the Impala.
“Not forever. Susan is probably running to get him. More importantly, how did the dog…” He cut himself off as Sam reached over and took the key from the hand that he was waving, missing the way that Mira growled a bit at the insinuation. Fake Cas gestured with his empty hand for a moment before pointing at Mira. “Did she just talk?”
Mira took a few steps forward, shaking once again before giving him a miserable look. “I don’t think it’s all off.”
Dean picked his way around Baby, opening the passenger door. Mira didn’t look up to acknowledge him until he picked up the mason jar.
Rowena raised an eyebrow. “Don’t thank me. It’s a rare bit of sentiment, from one ally to another. Ruairí is my peace offering to keep angry Winchesters off of my back.”
Castiel hadn’t been posted to Earth for millennia, at least not permanently. There had been times their flight had descended for individual missions. In those times, humans and their daemons had not been their main focus.
Castiel stroked a hand along the top of the box, looking up when he heard Rowena laugh. He met her gaze for a moment, seeing a flicker of understanding before she went back to baiting Dean, which he was grateful for. If he had to face Dean’s scorn or indifference while holding Jack’s remains he didn’t think he could remain detached. He might just give into the urge to break Dean’s jaw for once instead of allowing the annoyance to mellow.
Boudica went still, her head moving as she took in Dean and Mira before looking at Castiel. Her ears flattened for a moment as Boudica bared her teeth at him and Teal before she was all graciousness again. “Perfectly. We’ll start immediately.”
The door swung open, Teal looking up as Dean stepped out with his gun already drawn. He clearly anticipated something to be there and ready to be shot, but the fact that there was nothing seemed to throw him. He froze where he was, looking around even as Mira slipped between his legs to step out.
Instead, he reached down to curl his fingers around Dean’s wrist. He didn’t intend to stop him, but Dean went still. “It was a condition of the runes. Once they are broken, what they did disappears.”
Dean tensed under his hand, Castiel pausing too. When Dean didn’t relax, Castiel dropped his hand away. That seemed to be what Dean had been waiting for because he stepped away.
Dean stared, sure that is mouth was just hanging open because it didn’t make sense. Everything about Cain, all of the lore, the man himself didn’t say herbivore. It was carnivore, nature red in tooth and fang, like him and Mira. He snapped his mouth shut and shook his head. “No, dude, you didn’t meet the guy.”
Teal stared down at her, doing his distant angelic thing. The only thing missing was the flare of grace in his eyes and along the edges of his feathers.
He tensed his jaw, trying to steady himself so he wasn’t ricocheting off of the old longing and the Mark whispering to reach out, to touch Teal, to
Dean blinked, surprised at how much of a struggle it was to string words together. He finally managed a laugh. “You saying I’m not a perfect creation?”
Mira fell into step practically on top of him, already moving warily. “The sooner we’re gone the better.”
He didn’t wait for Mira to respond, practically lifting her off the ground to turn them and send them back to where they had last seen Sam.
Mira didn’t have the same restraint. Her snarl had him tensing up, part out of habit because she only made that sound when there was a threat, and partially out of the expectation of pain. That sound, that deep, that wolflike had always come with Adina’s teeth around her neck until Mira was on the ground and remembering her manners.
Dean fumbled for Mira, pulling her back even as she skittered away. “We need to get away. Now. Right now.”
Dean stared back at him and let Cas do it, vaguely feeling where things pulled. He heard the scrape of nails as Mira mimicked the motion. Cas looked between the two of them before sighing and dropping Dean’s arm into his lap, pressing the palm of one hand to his shoulder and putting a small amount of pressure. It wasn’t a reset, but there was a trickle of grace with it, enough to make the area feel warm.
It was not what they wanted to do, what they wanted to do was keep watch. Outside was better than not at watch at all. They could catch a nap on the road back to the bunker.
There had been a time that he thought Chronos had meant the Leviathans when he had talked about the world ending in black ooze. But he had been wrong.
The anger wanted to hold on, it felt good and right. It meant that he didn’t feel like he was about to crawl out of his skin. And Cas could take it, Cas was an angel and Teal was a feathered ball of grace. The two of them had been able to hold him and Mira down before, they could do it again.
Before it wouldn’t have been anything, nothing more than like when Dean would touch Castiel. Teal was sure that it would be more now. The question was, would it feel horrible or, perhaps worse, would it feel good? There were thousands of stories about how touching another person’s daemon was like when there was permission, when it was wanted. How much of that was human imagining and how much of that was human experience?
He looked up at her, keeping his voice as even as he could. “There’s no point. Since Mary, I’m dead to him.”
Teal looked sleek with his black feathers, although there was a bit of shine of color to them, especially along the wings. As Teal had them tucked in now, he could see a range of purple and blue if the light hit them in the right way. And maybe there was green on the edge of the wing joint, but that was gone when Dean shifted. He didn’t know enough about ravens to know if that was natural to them or if it was just a weird angel thing. He hadn’t known anyone with a raven daemon before.
The banishment was a shock, specifically because it came out of nowhere. One minute he and Castiel had been in the kitchen, watching a show and the next he was out in the middle of a field somewhere feeling stiff, sore and cramped, like he had been stored away.
His perch put Teal on eye level with Dean, Castiel watching the feathers on the back of Teal’s neck ruffle up, green and blue shooting through them in the low light. Dean noticed, Castiel was sure about that. He stared at Teal for a moment before nodding at the raven. “You’ll keep him on the straight and narrow.”
Dean glanced over at Mira, his daemon sighing as she flopped onto the creeper board. A kick had her sliding under the van, Mira bracing herself against the wheel.
Dean reached over, taking care to lean around where Teal was standing so very close to him, to pat at her paw. “The spear.”
“You would know.” Dean gave her another shove, Mira backing off with a huff. Her tail was held high, wagging gently, which was good. It was better than before.
Dean expected a minimal reaction. Sam looking up he expected. What was not expected was for Cas to look down at Mira in complete shock.
“Dunno.” Dean reached down to strike a finger down the bridge of her nose. “Could explain a few things.”
Dean’s hands tightened, Castiel glancing between him and his daemon to figure out why. But she was radiating anger as she stood up to brace herself on the hood of the car. Mira was tense, but wasn’t growling. Teal was staring right back at her, not seeming to care that she was leaning close to him.
The moment he and Teal had broken into the room with the Silver Guillotine, with the hum of the anbaric just underneath Dean and Mira’s shouting. The awful realization of what they were about to do the them, and the holy, righteous anger that had burned through him and Teal.
him, she was hidden. Of course, it would have been even more effective if he had been able to carve them into Mira’s bones, but he hadn’t had Teal then, so he wouldn’t have been able to do it.
Castiel saw the exact moment that Mira recognized him, the wolf bounding ahead a few strides before jumping up in the air to snap at Teal’s wing as he banked low. There was no chance of her catching him, they both made sure of that. It was just a greeting, like the ones that she would give Sabine where the two of them would lean into one another to see who would topple first. It was nice, to be welcomed like that, and better still that she was still doing it. It wasn’t forgiveness, it couldn’t be with all that they had done, but it was something.
Witches, true witches, the ones that they avoided, had something else. It was wrapped in ritual and tradition, and that was about as far as he had heard Sam get before he had tuned out. In his defense, Dr. Sexy had been on and the finale was more important than what Sam had been going on about. He had paid attention again just in time for the fact that they
“Yes. It feels warm.” Teal clacked his beak, Mira feeling him shift on her forelegs. “Cas feels warm.”
A sharp sweep of pleasure rolled down her spine in time to Dean’s low, muffled groan. Mira echoed it was a whine, rolling over to her other side to paw at the bedside table. “Come on…”
They were swarming, and he had agreed to wait with their queen while the workers had gone out to find a new hive. They had been taken their time about it, so much so that Castiel had his own suspicions about a revolution in the hive.
Castiel glanced over at Teal, nodding when the raven looked over at the tablet. His claws flexed again, but loosened, an agreement even if a reluctant one. Still, Teal could be sent to check in, if only for their piece of mind, if things didn’t get too dangerous.
“Mm, not feelin’ it.” Dean chuckled, his gaze shifting over to where Teal was trailing after her. “Didn’t expect him to have any juice. I thought all of you were grounded.”
Unfortunately, Sam was right. He had none. As much as Castiel wanted to listen to Dean, he was fading fast and would be unconscious soon, regardless of whether he allowed it.
Dean sighed and closed his eyes against the unpleasant slideshow of events that had occurred in his dream. His
In response to that revelation, Castiel’s mouth opened and closed several times before he finally spoke again, shock and confusion evident in his voice.
Sam was huddled in front of Dean, whose wilted form was sagging against one of the barn’s rickety support beams. Dean's skin was pallid, and his lips looked to be blue. His eyes were closed. He looked seconds away from death.
Now, Castiel was sitting in the bed, alone with his thoughts, as he waited for Dean to come back with a glass of water.
“Because Dean— I love Sam, too. But the way that I love Sam is entirely different from the way that I love you. I understand that your love for me is familial. Brotherly,” he choked out the word, barely masking his disgust. “I’m happy with that. Grateful for it, even.” He took a few more steps, approaching Dean for the words that mattered most. “But if you think that’s the same as what I feel for you, you are grossly mistaken.”
“I love you,” Dean said against his lips, once more for good measure. Castiel felt the words reverberating throughout him with force, radiating warmth in his bones and filling him with bubbly, incandescent happiness. Dean took a step back. “But if you ever try to pull something like that again, I’ll kick your feathery ass.”
“Well, for starters,” Dean said, his head tilting. “I say we find ourselves a new place to live. A place that, at minimum, is above ground and has an actual roof, like, with shingles. You know, white picket fence, nosy neighbors, the whole shebang.”
the good news is that most of the next chapter is already written, so the final chapter (and maybe an epilogue??) should be up in a couple days.
Castiel swallowed thickly and doubled down. He put forth all of his power, concentrated everything he had on Dean. On this one, beautiful man. This one beautiful,
He wasn’t sure what to say. There was too much, too many things that he needed to tell him. He settled for his go-to phrase.
Dean didn’t let that deter him. He began to frantically survey Castiel’s body for injury, searching beneath his trench coat and on every square inch of his person for blood.
you said. I’m angry that you said it and then had the nerve to immediately get yourself killed.” Castiel’s eyes flitted to the ground, saddened by the memory. “I don’t understand— I just... why would you do that, man? Why make that deal?”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Dean muttered, rolling his eyes in mock annoyance, but when he glanced back at Castiel, he had an infectious smile on his face.
A moment later, Dean pressed three chaste kisses in quick succession against Castiel’s stunned lips. The light, innocent nature of the action in contrast to the heaviness of what they had just done made Castiel giggle abruptly, and Dean felt his heart contract in his chest with the sound.
“You promise you’re never gonna throw yourself headfirst into the Empty seconds after confessing your undying love for me again?”
Out of the void, a sudden breeze grazed his face like a whisper of wind, taking him away from his musing. He sat up, confused. The sensation felt strange against his skin, not having felt anything since he landed here.
“I know.” Sam stood up and grabbed his book from where it had fallen earlier. “But you’d rather see Dean,” he said, unfazed. “It’s alright, Cas. I understand.
I didn't reread this chapter or edit it much, so sorry for any typos or errors! one more chapter to go!!!!
anyways, the first half of this chapter is an important Cas and Jack convo, and the second half is an important, therapeutic Cas and Dean convo :)
Castiel sighed. “I didn’t think it was possible,” he replied honestly, and then promptly changed the subject, “Is Jack still here?”
Dean laughed at Castiel’s obvious confusion. He leaned forward and pressed a helpless kiss to Castiel’s cheek.
“And he’s… alive?” he asked, a bit incredulous that Jack hadn’t been forced to pay the ultimate price to save the universe, as that seemed to be a pattern that ran in the family.
Castiel huffed out a little, breathless laugh at that. Then, he looked down to rediscover that he was, in fact, in Dean’s bed. Which meant—
“I know, Cas.” His tone was sincere. “You’re important to me, too. But I also know that you want to see him.”
Castiel felt pride bloom in his chest. He always knew that Jack could do it. He only wished he could have been by his side when he finally did.
. I mean, honestly, you’ve always had me, Cas. I’m sorry for not telling you that sooner.” He shook his head, annoyed with himself for all of the chances he had missed. “Just— just don’t leave again. Okay? No more sacrifices. No more goodbyes. We’ve had to say goodbye too many times already. I ain’t doing it again.” Castiel blinked and tears rolled down his cheeks, shining in the dimly lit room. Dean swiftly wiped them away, his thumbs gently sweeping underneath his eyes as he continued. “Stay here. Stay with me.”
Dean felt his eyes spring open. Finally, finally, something had broken through to him. Rescued him from his misery.
After a moment, he heard Sam shouting for him from inside the barn. He made a beeline for the heavy door and opened it, quickly entering the building.
“Cas, please. Look at me— you can have this.” He gestured between them once again. “Please, get it through your fucking head before I lose my mind.”
“Hey.” Dean used a thumb to smooth out the lines in Castiel’s forehead that had crinkled there as a result of his disgruntlement.  “What’s wrong?”
Castiel had been away from Earth for a while. Because time seemed to move differently in Heaven, he wasn’t precisely sure how long he’d been gone, but he knew it was far longer than he preferred. Longer than he’d preferred to be away from Dean.
His eyes wandered to the bedside table. There was another framed picture there, but this one, he didn't recognize. He was pretty sure that it was a new addition to Dean's decor. He looked more closely, only to realize that it was a picture of
Dean released the breath he’d been holding and felt himself smile in relief. “Good. That’s— that’s good.”
Castiel blinked groggily, slowly returning to consciousness. His surroundings came into focus gradually. Dean’s arm still snugly wrapped around him. Their legs tangled together beneath the blankets. Dean’s soft snores puffing out against the nape of his neck.
He put the pen and the clipboard down on the table beside the bed and brushed his hands together, as if ridding himself of the task.
Castiel could feel his heart beating wildly in his chest. Sharing a bed… that was more new territory for them. He found himself growing nervous at the prospect. He shifted toward the nightstand, as close to the edge of the bed as possible.
, Cas,” he said fervently, and the angel could feel his heart skip a beat. Those words never failed to have an impact on him. “And, just to be clear, I would do anything for you. I would give up anything for you.
was not the response he was looking for either. Dean’s fists clenched at his sides and his brows furrowed angrily.
He replaced Sam in front of Dean, and thought those words over. He didn’t know if he had the power to save him, but he knew that he’d die trying. He slowly lifted his hands up to cradle Dean’s face. Dean leaned into the touch, his face somehow shifting into a happy expression despite the circumstances, as though he had subconsciously registered Castiel’s presence.
Castiel made it to the location to which he had been summoned in record speed. He could feel his heart hammering inside his chest as he took in the barn and its surroundings. His eyes scanned the premises, anxiously searching.
Having secured the permission he had been seeking, Castiel surrendered to his exhaustion and let himself fade into sleep. The last thing he remembered seeing was the worry behind the green eyes staring down at him.
As soon as Sam had exited the room, Castiel found himself wringing his hands, inexplicably nervous about seeing Dean.
But, thanks to modern medicine, a blood transfusion, an IV line, and some dubious green hospital Jell-O later, Dean was right as rain. His color had come back, and he appeared to have made a complete recovery, which was a miracle, to say the least, considering he was as good as dead mere hours ago.
They both knew that the answer was a cop-out, but it also worked. For now, at least. They were cautiously optimistic that, with the universe under Jack’s control, they could finally move on and enjoy life without the burden of being one of the select few responsible for keeping humanity alive.
Of course, he had hoped that maybe, just maybe, amidst the confusion and shock, Dean might take some of his words to heart. That he might realize he’s not the monster he sees in the mirror. That he might feel just an ounce of the love that Castiel harbored for him and might let himself bask in it. That he might, for one moment, feel something for himself other than self-loathing and hatred.
In just three words, the angel managed to quell all the fears that had threatened to consume him. Castiel had always had a way of doing that. Dean smiled.
Castiel stared at him incredulously. The idea of living with Dean in a house of their own, it was something he didn’t dare to even dream about.
Unceremoniously, he got up and offered a hand to Castiel. The angel, still confused as ever, accepted it happily and followed Dean out of the room, content to go anywhere so long as they were together.
Sam brought his hand up to his chin, scrubbing over his stubble in an apparent attempt to gather himself.
“Stop apologizing for saving my life,” Dean murmured. “Just— never do something like that again. We’re a team. We make decisions together from now on.”
“Jack. He— well, he became God. I mean, it’s kind of a long story, obviously, but that’s the Sparknotes version.”
“It’s not like dying was my first choice,” he responded flatly. “I decided to invoke the deal when it became clear that there was no other way to protect you.”
Detecting a serious note to Dean’s tone, Castiel sat farther back and placed a little distance between them, awaiting his next words.
“Everything happened the same, up until Jack became God. In the dream, we— we never got you out of the Empty. It was just Sam and me, acting like things were normal. Even though we knew you were suffering in there? It looked like we were at peace, but how could we have been? Without you? Without Jack? It didn’t make sense. And then— and then I died? In a barn. From being impaled by a rusty piece of rebar during some random hunt. And so... so then Sam had to live out the rest of his days completely alone.”
, Cas?” His voice was low and strained. “You’re fine with just leaving them to pick up the pieces knowing they’ll never see you again? Knowing they’ll mourn you for the rest of their lives?”
The light grew brighter, and Castiel could finally make out the shape of it. It was a glowing schism against the blackness of the space. An indistinct fissure, growing larger every second, like fabric splitting open as a seam rips apart.
“I don’t want you to apologize for making the deal to save me. That’s not the point. I just want you to understand that you’re not expendable to me. You never have been.” He tightened his arms around him to drive that point home. “I’m not okay with you making decisions under the assumption that I wouldn’t care if something happened to you. I’ve never been okay with it.”
. At times, it seemed that he was all-knowing. Stronger and more powerful than anyone Dean has ever known on such a profound level. But then, in polar opposition, his otherworldly nature betrayed him all too often. It constantly exposed his social ineptness and his childlike wonder. He vacillated between unmatched sagacity and complete naivety without notice. He was a study in contrasts. A perfect dichotomy. And Dean loved him all the more for it.
to! In fact, I think the only reason why I haven’t already stopped is because I’m so used to it that I don't know
“Yes,” Castiel looked up, then nodded as though he was finally beginning to make sense of Dean’s word vomit. “You’re saying you care about me in a...
“I would be lying if I said that I enjoy you risking your life on a daily basis. I don’t. But I also don’t want you to give up hunting forever on my account," he stated, slightly anxious that Dean thought he would ever expect such a thing from him. "And besides, once we finish up in Heaven, I could go with you. Like before. I'd feel better if we went together." Dean smiled warmly at that. "But Dean, I would never ask you to give up something that you love for my comfort.”
“Cas, for the love of God, would you please listen to me? I’m not feeling pressured into saying anything. It’s the truth.”
His strenuous efforts were halted by a hand gripped tightly to his leg. He looked up to find Dean’s brows furrowed, puzzled.
“Jesus, kid,” Dean groaned, then put his gun back in its rightful place, rubbing his eyes in an attempt to wake up. “We’ve talked about this. Knocking before entering. You scared the hell out of me.”
here it is!!! the last real chapter! only an epilogue to go. I can't believe this story is coming to an end :( it started as a literal 4k baby fix-it and somehow transformed into this monster!!! I had one thing left to fix in this chapter: the infamous nail (or rebar, if we're being technical), because you KNOW I couldn't just let that excruciatingly bad fever dream of a scene remain unedited in my brain for a second longer. please enjoy!!!! and thank you thank you thank you for reading :)
Sam looked reluctant to drop it, but ultimately, he did. “No, but he said he’ll be back as soon as possible.”
But within seconds, their maneuvering seemed to shift into autopilot, and their lips moved against each other with easy, almost practiced, motion. It was as if they had done this a million times before, like their bodies knew exactly what to do, without thought or uncertainty. There was unfathomable familiarity in each movement and in every shift.
Dean closed his eyes and paused for a moment, overcome with exhaustion over what has essentially become a twelve-year long miscommunication.
“Delivery!” Dean said cheerfully, appearing in the doorway and interrupting Castiel’s inner monologue. He was holding the glass of water aloft, presenting it like a trophy.
. My life was chosen for me from the moment my mom died. My dad chose the hunting path for me, and I walked it. And maybe, now that we know what we know, with Chuck and the whole,” he gesticulated lazily, “lack-of-free-will thing… maybe the first half of my life was always going to be hunting. Maybe I never had a say.”
Dean sighed, exhausted, and then took one of Castiel’s hands in an attempt to get his message across.
“Sam, it’s okay.” Castiel interrupted, “I never expected—” He backtracked, closing his eyes against painful memories of the Empty.
“I— I was moving to the spare room. So you could have your bed back. It’s late, you probably want to sleep... And I’ve taken your bed for four days,” he explained, his sentences stilted and voice timid.
dumb.” His words were laced with both empathy and affection. “I’m sorry that you had to go through that alone.”
He let Castiel invade all of his senses, completely intoxicating him in a way that wholly eclipsed all memories of his nightmare.
A world of animation and vibrancy swirled in front of him like swatches of color blending together on a palette. It was a beautiful contrast to the nihility he was used to, but it was also a complete inundation of all the sensations he had been deprived of for so long. He felt dizzied with it.
Dean groaned in frustration, and Castiel’s brows furrowed once again. Dean wished, not for the first time, that he shared Sam’s talent for expressing his feelings.
. An Angel of the Lord falling for Dean Winchester. It sounded impossible, and yet there Castiel stood, his heart on his sleeve.
He thought over his options and decided that he had nothing to lose by trying. Even if there was only a minute chance that this was real, seeing his family again was worth the shot.
“Hey.” Dean carefully wiped underneath the angel’s eyes, ridding him of the tears that had evidently gathered there without his notice. “It’s alright, Cas.”
His heart beat happily between them as Castiel twisted his fingers into Dean’s shirt, tilting his head to allow him a better angle. Without breaking the kiss, he moved to sit atop Dean’s lap, his arms draping over Dean’s shoulders as he let him in, tongue slipping past his lips.
“Always,” he said, his emotion coloring the single word with complete sincerity. “I’ll always want you. You won’t ever be getting rid of me, not if I can help it. Wild horses and all that.”
Castiel took his hand and pressed one, searing kiss to Dean’s palm. Dean felt his skin ignite there with a pleasant burn.
“I know, Dean.” His voice wavered a bit, emotion threatening to consume him. “I love you, too. I love you more than anything in the universe. I do.” His thumb sweeped lightly over Dean’s cheek, where tears had started to gather. “But you’re not dying.”
Castiel levelled him an unimpressed look. “There’s always been so much more to you than hunting, Dean.”
Dean had settled in, the mattress dipping beneath his weight as he adjusted the blanket on top of him. He was on his back, his arms crossed behind his head with a pillow propping him up slightly. Once he was comfortable, he exhaled in satisfaction.
Castiel was, patently, not alright. In fact, he was currently struggling to rid his mind of the gut-wrenching image of Dean bleeding out and seconds away from death with a piece of rusty rebar spearing through his torso. He felt sick.
His eyes shut tightly as he exerted more power into healing him than he thought possible. A labored groan escaped him, the effort overwhelming his body. The light emanating from his hands grew to be blinding, filling the entire barn with intense whiteness.
He squeezed his thigh, and Castiel thought he could feel a current travel through him in response like a live wire.
“Cas.” Castiel’s face glistened with tear tracks. “Thank you. For trying to protect me. But I’ll never be happy if you’re not in my life. And I’ll definitely never be happy if I know that you’re rotting away in some hell dimension. I need you to know that.”
The light had become overwhelming, radiating intense whiteness into the Empty. It felt fundamentally wrong, invasive in this space that wasn’t designed to bear anything apart from nothingness. Castiel closed his eyes against the brightness.
“Dean, just breathe. You’re alright.” His free hand circled over Dean’s lower back comfortingly. “You were having a nightmare.”
“I’m talking about me!” Dean burst, unable to withstand this unique form of torture any longer. “What about
Castiel felt his eyes grow heavy with the strenuous effort to stay awake, his consciousness ebbing away by the second.
Castiel happily complied. He fell into him, gripping fistfuls of Dean’s flannel in a tight embrace. Dean wrapped his arms around him and held him as closely as possible, basking in the feeling of having his angel back where he belonged.
“It’s alright.” Dean dragged one of Castiel’s hands to his chest, pressing his palm against the fabric of his shirt. Castiel could feel his heart beating there, strong and true, valiantly rebelling against the trauma it had faced only minutes ago. “
“Dean, I... I’m so sorry.” Castiel frowned. “I didn’t— never in a million years did I think you’d reciprocate. I didn’t mean to hurt you, and I didn’t expect you to try to bring me back. I’m sorry.”
“Cas, listen to me,” the voice said, and Castiel closed his eyes against the familiarity and comfort it brought him. “This is real. We’re getting you out of there. You need to come to me.”
. But hunting? I don’t love hunting.” He sighed, closing his eyes for a moment. “I never wanted this.
Instead, he faintly heard a “Woah, woah, woah,” and felt hands gripped around his waist, catching him without a second to spare before his inevitable demise.
The angel stood motionless, eyes wide. He was still missing the picture, apparently. Dean tried to hold back his exasperation.
“Not as my brother,” Dean confirmed. Then his face screwed up in disgust. “Jesus, can we drop that? Forever?”
It felt too good to be true, like this might just be another cruel mind game the Shadow was playing on him.
They traded looks of relief, but also confusion, unable to understand why Castiel was in such poor shape.
. He wasn't sure when it was taken, or who took it, but it was definitely him. In the photo, he stood in the library of the bunker, smiling at something out of the camera's range.
“Cut the crap,” he said with a pained chuckle, his voice breathy. “I’m like ninety-nine percent sure I’m as good as dead.”
He turned to his right and found Sam sitting in an armchair that had been pulled to his bedside. A book sat in his lap, loosely held, like his arms had gone lax as soon as he had seen Castiel’s eyes open. His face was full of hope, but also fear, like he couldn’t quite believe that the angel was truly awake.
And so he did. He kept his eyes shut tightly, the intensity of the light too much to handle, and let the voice guide him closer to its source. It called out his name, over and over, until finally— finally, Castiel had reached it.
Right now, he was focused on him like a prayer. He used his image and his voice to distract himself from the misery and emptiness inherent to this place. To distract himself from the knowledge that he would be spending the rest of his existence here.
The two walked out of the hospital hand in hand, and as the doors slid to a close behind them, Castiel got the sense that they were leaving behind not just the blood and the bandages, but also the endless war and violence that had needlessly plagued their past. He got the sense that they were stepping into a new life entirely. And while, normally, the thought of such change and unpredictability might frighten him, Castiel felt perfectly at ease with the knowledge that whatever their future looked like, it would be just that.
Dean smiled at his earnest expression and took his face into both hands. He leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead before leaning his own against it.
It was just an average, run-of-the-mill, everyday goodbye. No different than any of the countless other goodbyes the two had shared.
“Yeah, well, you never expressed it to me before letting the Empty swallow you whole either, Cas, but you still got to say it.”
After what felt like hours, time started moving again. Dean stood up fully and stared hesitantly into Castiel’s eyes.
“Good morning, Dean,” he replied, beaming. “I’m happy to be back.” His eyes moved to Castiel. “Hello, Castiel.”
“Cas?” Dean frantically searched his face, checking for signs that he was really there. “Cas... I—” he gasped in a few breaths, unable to speak.
Castiel exhaled slowly, internally debating what to tell him. Dean had apparently excluded Castiel’s confession from the narrative when he told Sam what had happened in the dungeon.
“You love me.” And this time it came out as a statement, tentative and new, but lacking the doubt that had clearly filled his head moments before.
He immediately felt dizzy, his vision darkening in his periphery. Apparently, he hadn’t fully recovered from his escape.
“Cas.” Castiel’s eyes flitted back up to Sam at the hesitance in his voice. “Dean— he was pretty torn up when the Empty took you. I don’t know how you two left things, but he was a mess. I mean, you were dead, so obviously none of us were doing well, but he was a
Despite his lack of vision or hearing, he still had his mind. He still had the ability to imagine. To imagine himself elsewhere, surrounded by the people that he longed to be with. His thoughts were the one thing the Empty couldn’t take away from him. He would retain that one small weapon, that one small comfort, for the eternity he was destined to spend here.
“Dean, we don’t have to talk about that conversation,” Castiel interrupted. He stood up again, this time slowly so as to prevent himself from fainting. Dean watched him warily the entire time, as if he were mentally preparing to catch him again. “You can pretend it never happened and move on. I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable.”
He had watched, endeared, as Dean dutifully tucked the blanket around his legs, taking care to ensure that no air could sneak in and sap any warmth away from him.
Dean appeared confused, his mouth opened as if to say something, but closed just as quickly. He shook his head and eliminated the final space that had separated them. They were now standing face to face, only a few feet apart.
Castiel ran to them, inspecting the gruesome scene before him. He felt his eyes widen when he found the source of the bleeding. Dean had been impaled. And from the looks of it, his vital organs hadn’t been spared in the process.
He forced himself to shed his anxieties. He turned over, fitting his back to Dean’s chest, so that the two were effectively spooning. He pulled his arm around him and held it against his sternum after pressing a small kiss to the back of his hand. Dean pulled him in closer, releasing a soft noise of approval.
Castiel thought that question over. Honestly, he wasn’t quite sure why anxiety was rolling over him in waves. He thought the newness of the situation was to blame for his nerves, and that was probably somewhat true. But, more predominantly, he was nervous because he couldn’t quite believe this was actually happening. His earlier thoughts of the Shadow plagued his mind and threatened to overtake him.
He tried, unsuccessfully, to shake the dark thoughts that were currently cycling through his brain. Thoughts about what would have transpired had he not showed up in time.
He tried his best to stand up, unsteady with the sensory overload he was currently experiencing. He watched in disbelief as a hand shot out of the rift.
Their heavenly construction project was arduous, a herculean task, really, but they had come a long way already. And, after enlisting some other angels for help, things had really started to move along. Castiel estimated that, in human time, they had only a few months left of work to go before they could officially wrap things up here.
“I’m right here.” Apparently, the voice could sense his presence, despite its inability to see into the Empty. The barrier between nothing and everything had blurred with the opening of the portal. “Take my hand, Cas.”
He squinted his eyes at that thought, realizing he had no idea what time it was. There were no windows or clocks in the bedroom to indicate whether it was morning or night.
, only to finally meet his match at the hands of a wall decoration. But that conversation could wait until he was safe, sound, and healthy, and without a gigantic, gaping wound in his back. That conversation could wait until he was healed.
He was teetering impossibly close to the precipice of death, and Castiel was beginning to fear that he may not be able to pull him back.
“Dean…” Castiel whispered, pained at the memory of Dean’s limp form sagging against the support beam, blood rapidly draining from his body.
“Leave me alone,” he cried, his own voice sounding foreign after some time of nonuse. “I know this isn’t real.”
“I’m not trying to t—” He stopped himself and shook his head, as though realizing too that this conversation was getting nowhere. “I just don’t understand. You’ve never expressed that to me before.”
“Fuck,” Dean exhaled in relief. He stood a bit, only to pull Castiel into an embrace. The hold was a little awkward, with the angel seated and Dean hunched over. Somehow, it didn’t matter. He felt like he was being magically put back together every second that Dean held him.
“Cas,” Dean leveled him with a helpless look. “If you seriously think I can just up and forget that ‘conversation’— if it can even be called that— you’re out of your damn mind.”
“Thanks, you old sap.” He kissed him chastely to soften his words. “I appreciate it, but that wasn’t my point. My point was that I have a say now.”
He exhaled roughly, then used all of his might to pull Dean toward him, off of the rebar that had impaled him. Dean released a low, blood-curdling scream of pain as the metal cruelly made its exit without regard to the intricate inner workings of the body it had imposed upon. The sound flooded Castiel’s veins with cold terror and anguish.
“Dean,” he exhaled slowly, trying to keep his composure. He needed to say it once more before he let himself rest. “I love you.”
Dean’s face had shifted from pained to peaceful, like Castiel’s words had provided him some kind of absolution.
Dean nodded, then kissed Castiel again. This one lingered a bit longer than the last, Dean shifting his head to change the angle more than once.
“I love you,” Dean said again, but this time without the anger. His words were palpably intense and honest. He was determined to get through to him.
His words had a chaotic, desperate edge to them, as though the thought of Castiel not knowing how much he cared about him could somehow inflict physical pain.
Dean was kneeling in front of him, his hand on Castiel’s thigh. His skin burned underneath the point of contact.
Dean couldn’t really argue with that logic, but still— the thought of losing him again was enough to defy rationality. He just needed a different strategy.
“I need to tell him that if he’s planning on living to an old age, he’s gonna need to get a haircut at some point. It looked like he was wearing a damn dollar store wig in my dream.”
you. I needed to tell you… and you were just. Gone. And it felt different this time. Like you weren't coming back.”
At the moment, he was restructuring some new areas of the realm, helping Jack with the terrain on some particularly tricky regions. He had figured that the more work he finished before going back to Earth, the less he would have to spend on the next trip. If he could get a substantial amount of work done in one fell swoop, he could abbreviate his next stay in Heaven.
“We’re not,” Dean cut him off, unamused. “Anyways, to me, everything about you is angelic.” He waggled his eyebrows.
After he had sufficiently collected himself, Dean brought a hand up to cup Castiel’s cheek, the stubble he found there prickling under his palm.
dying, so—” He swallowed, and then his hands moved from Dean’s face to his shoulders. He gripped them tightly. “This is going to hurt, but it will all be over soon,” he said with a grimace, like the words themselves could further injure Dean. “I promise.”
. Images of him dying in that stupid barn. Of Sam mourning him. Of a heaven without Castiel waiting for his arrival. They flashed through his mind viciously.
Not that he minded helping Jack with his big renovation project. He loved it. He loved feeling useful, and he loved being able to spend time with him here. But, he missed Dean. He pretty much missed Dean from the moment they parted, every single time they parted. By the end of his stays, he was always bone-tired, riddled with exhaustion, and more than ready to go home to him.
And there, miraculously, his angel sat. He could feel tears beginning to form in sheer relief and elation at the mere sight of him.
He exhaled shakily. Even though the nightmare was ridiculous, it still felt a little too real to laugh about.
Castiel laughed, happy tears threatening to spill over at any moment. He couldn't have possibly felt better.
“You know,” he began, unconvinced, “when I ask you that question, I’m not asking because I want you to lie to me or make me feel better. I’m asking because I care about you, Dean.”
As Dean peeled back the blanket, Castiel noticed that he had changed his clothes at some point. He was now wearing a heathered blue Henley shirt and soft pants.
“He’s alive, Cas.” Sam smiled as Castiel released a breath of relief. “He’s the one that figured out how to get you out of the Empty. It took him a little longer than anyone wanted it to… he sort of had to learn how to open portals between dimensions while simultaneously restoring order on Earth. Apparently, even when you’re God, things take time.” Sam laughed a bit to himself at the ridiculousness of his life, but his expression soon became apologetic. “But we got to you as soon as we could, Cas—”
“Cas…” He shook his head minutely. Then, suddenly, he locked his gaze on the angel. His eyes shined like this was the last time he’d see him. He was struggling to keep them open. “Cas, I love you. So much. You know that right? You gotta know,” he said, desperation permeating his words. “And I’m— I’m so sorry for not telling you sooner.
“Cas, I don’t look at you like you’re my brother.” He paused again, thinking that over. “Maybe— maybe I used to, in the beginning. I don’t know... It’s— it’s all such a mess.” He shook his head as though he could physically sort out his thoughts. “But I sure as hell don’t look at you like a brother now. I mean, you’re just as important to me as him, which is why I compared you two, but don’t get it twisted— the feelings I have for you are not the same as the feelings I have for my brother. That would be...
At first, he thought it was just his imagination, a desperate attempt to make something out of nothing, but then— he
Castiel tried not to reflexively flinch at that statement. With those words, he felt a sinking sense of dread flow through him. He began to think that his confession might not have landed as he had intended it to. He began to think that maybe Dean had thought that Castiel meant he loved him like a brother. And now that he thought of it, this was the only logical explanation behind Dean’s current behavior, which was in no way different from his behavior during any of their other reunions. In fact, his behavior was oddly normal, considering this was their only reunion to follow Castiel professing that he was in love with him.
Dean nodded, released a breath, then turned back to Castiel. His face appeared out of focus in front of him.
For some time, they just stayed there, unmoving. It was like someone had paused them in this moment. Dean stared at Castiel’s shoulder, where his hand was gripped viselike to Dean’s.
At the emotional turmoil evident in his features, Castiel frowned and removed Dean’s hand from his face to hold it in his lap instead.
He inhaled in a panic, as though he hadn’t had a breath of fresh air in decades. He looked at Castiel with a wild expression, eyes wide and mouth open, panting.
The thought was short-lived. Only seconds later, Sam looked back to the angel with a radiant smile on his face, then bent down to pull him into another warm embrace.
Castiel’s eyes scanned Dean’s face, checking for any sign of deceit or wavering. Dean stood still, ensuring that he would find none.
“Sure, two months is better than forever, but still— Cas, you knew that we’d try to get you out, right?”
Dean finished up his scribbling and finalized the form with a ridiculously oversized and loopy signature of
He shot up, a cold sweat settling over his skin in an uncomfortable sheen. He was sitting in his bed at the bunker, the sheets falling to his lap and pooling there. His breathing was erratic, still lost in whatever hell he had just experienced.
It was a selfish choice, really. Saying those words was not mutually beneficial, and Castiel knew that. He knew he would get peace out of his confession, while Dean would get nothing but inner turmoil and endless questions. Questions that would go forever unanswered, or so Castiel had thought. He did it to save Dean, yes, but there was also selfishness in that respect— he didn’t want to live without Dean, so instead, he had forced Dean to live without him.
It was an order. He had said it without once taking his eyes off Dean. Sam wasted no time backing away and following it, allowing Castiel some space.
“Oh.” He shot up, uncovering himself and moving to swivel his legs over the side of the mattress. “I’ll— umm...” He struggled, his limbs having gotten trapped by the blanket, which only sent him into a further panic.
He took a deep breath. This was it. This was his chance to set the record straight once and for all, and he was royally screwing it up.
“Well... I’m hoping that we won’t find ourselves in situations that require sacrifices in the future.”
Finally, he turned to Castiel with a smile, presumably to ask if he was ready to go, only to pause when he discovered that the angel had been staring, emotionless, at where their hands were joined together on the bed. Then, he seemed to make the realization that Castiel had been doing the exact same thing for the past fifteen minutes while Dean had worked on the form.
Dean hummed happily. “I love you too,” He ran his hand up and down Castiel’s back idly. “What do you say we get out of here? I’m starting to smell like hospital.”
Dean pulled back, keeping his hand on Castiel’s shoulder. The pressure there felt like a tether, anchoring him securely to the ground.
Sam scoffed. “I should be the one asking you that, Cas. You just survived a two-month stay with a cosmic entity. How are
Then— “Oh, gee,” he scoffed. “Thanks for that, Cas. I guess I’ll just develop a sudden case of voluntary amnesia and somehow forget one of the worst things to ever happen to me.”
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted. He reached across his chest to place his hand atop Dean’s. Electricity sparked where their skin met. He took in a trembling breath. “That won't be necessary. I’m fine.”
His voice exposed his uncertainty. He still couldn’t believe this was real— that Castiel could actually want
. He knew exactly why he was feeling anxious, and it had everything to do with what he had told him when they last parted.
Castiel could not believe what he was hearing. He hadn’t expected to hear those words from Dean in a million years. His heart was beating wildly inside his chest at the idea of Dean closing the door on his life of hunting and keeping himself decidedly out of harm’s way. Keeping himself
The feeling of Castiel’s warm breath and soft moans against him was the heaven Dean had always imagined for himself. Much better than his dream, in which the angel was notably absent.
Castiel smiled, big and genuine and happy, as though the truth behind Dean’s words was finally starting to sink in.
And that wasn’t the worst of it. In the center of his torso, a large red stain of blood had bloomed. It stood out in shocking contrast to the light fabric of his shirt.
At the conclusion of their emotionally-charged conversation, Dean had ushered Castiel back to the bed, grumbling something along the lines of “I can’t believe you thought it was a good idea to stand up again literally five minutes after you fainted and almost cracked your skull open.”
Somehow, Castiel knew exactly what he was asking for. He physically ached at the thought that Dean hadn’t heard the words nearly as much as he had deserved to.
“No, Sam," Dean snapped. "It’s not up for debate. What if he doesn’t wake up? We’re not—” He turned back to Castiel, and his eyes softened. He carefully brushed back some of the angel’s hair, which had become plastered to his forehead in an unruly mess during the escape. The soothing motion only brought Castiel closer to sleep, and he leaned into Dean’s hand. “I’m not risking it.”
At that, Castiel felt off-kilter, like maybe Sam didn’t approve of his confession. Maybe he didn’t approve of the feelings he had for Dean.
