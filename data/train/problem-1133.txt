John backs away, his gun gripped uselessly in his hand, and is shocked to find a deadly calmness he hadn’t felt since running headfirst into a firing line.
Sherlock stares after him - he can’t bring himself to move, blink or breath and the only reassurance he’s still alive is the heart thundering in his chest. John walks back towards him with his drink.
"Go on. Tell me what happened." Greg uttered, already preparing himself for the worst. Whenever he was too drunk to recall what he had done the night before, he knew it was something indecent. Last time this had happened, Anderson had informed him that he had received some very... suggestive... voicemails intended for Mycroft. Greg was "too ill" to show his face for at least another week after that.
"Sorry to move you, Sherlock, but I can't breath." John struggled out, hand patting Sherlock's back. Sherlock groaned as he rolled off of him, crushing several of John's ribs as he went. Stifling his grunt of pain, he looked over at Sherlock, who was currently trying to curl himself into a ball. Based on his inebriated state last night, the conclusion was a simple one: he had a serious hangover.
John’s just now caught up with what’s transpiring, and he hates how ready he is to do anything for Sherlock; he feels like a puppy jumping excitedly around the man’s ankles.
"Most likely." Sherlock replied, slightly distracted by Rosie's frown as she still couldn't quite seem to reach his hair. He took pity on her and tilted his head towards one of her hands. He didn't mind: she was always gentle. "Anyway, I can prove that he manipulated me."
“Hello, sweetheart.” John murmurs, picking her up. He lets his hand float through her curls and for the first time, doesn’t grieve for Mary whilst doing so. He hugs her close for a few moments, only loosening his hold when she begins to kick him.
"Gregory. I... apologize for what I said." He began, using all self-control within him to keep eye contact with Greg. "To help you cope with the stress of work, I have instructed my men to drive you to and fro whenever you need in order to decrease time during a case. I have also decided to be absent from work on Fridays, giving you a day to uncoil with me instead of.... on your own." He said with his head held high, although the guilt was aching in his chest. "In addition, I bo-" but Mycroft was cut off by Greg's strong arms around his neck, hugging him as Mycroft stood stiffly.
He puts his phone back into his pocket, and frowns with his jaw clenched. He can put two and two together: Mary dies and Sherlock and John’s relationship goes downhill. Before her death, they could talk without words – something so intense that it made Greg slightly uncomfortable at times – and know what the other needs by glance. As Sherlock looks up at him from his seat against a brick wall, he gives in. Just like he always has for all these years.
Sherlock's eyes flicked up to the ceiling as if the answer was written there, his face grimaced as if the light was blinding. "Abdomen." He replied, overly-confident in his answer. John's face grew dark and a split second after Sherlock had spoken, John muttered the word "Bed." through gritted teeth. He grabbed Sherlock's hand and began pulling him upstairs, burning with anger. "But thisss your room, sweetheart." Sherlock giggled. Sweetheart. That was new.
This little negotiation between them, food for information on the case, was working well. That was until John ran out of information and so Sherlock saw no reason to eat. Time for a different approach.
John spent a little more time at the library but Sherlock didn't show up again. After a while, he returmed to the Hufflepuff common room, where he bumped into Diggory. "Cedric!" "John" "I heard you entered, is that true?" "Yes, I'm going to try it. And get Hufflepuff some more recognition!" "Way to go man, I'm sure you'll do great. I believe in you!" They smiled at each other. "Thanks buddy... I uh, I was actually just leaving so..." Cedric waved him goodbye. John smiled in return. He flopped down on an armchair next to Molly. "Where have you been all day?" "Oh i was showing around a Beauxbatons student." "So you're trying to top Three-House Watson then and youre trying to get a French girl?", assumed Mike, just having entered from the dormitories. John went red at an instant. "No, I... It's not even a girl and im not trying to get him! I'm not gay!" Molly and Mike decided to not dive into it any further and just leave it be. Johns sister Harry was a lesbian and their parents weren't supportive of it. The subject was a bit intense for John.
After their glorious dinner and a Doctor Who rewatch, John tended to Harry's nose again. He did so first thing when entering the flat, his quick hands creating a makeshift bandage for her nose. Now he was checking again. He would heal it with magic but it was sadly illegal for him to do outside of school. And Harry hated hospitals.
Helen sat down at dinner with her stepfather. They mostly ate in silence. Every now and then he would remark upon the taste of the good and she'd agree. Then, she excused herself. "I'll be off now. I plan to read." He dismissed her. Helen then spent about an hour sitting on her bed until her stepfather checked in with her. "I'll go to my room now as well. Good night." He closed the door. It was dark outside. Helen opened the window. John and Sherlock promptly got onto the broom at the signal and flew into her room. They landed without a sound. Then Helen took hold of the broom, mouthed a "Good Luck", and flew into the night.
With the exams coming up, they often met with the study group. John found himself talking to Cho more, who was just as confused as he was when her girlfriend and Sherlock switched to French from time to time. Sherlock was completely fluent in both but Irene snuggled with translating some of the specific subjects they'd rehearsed in French to another language just like that. Molly, Mike and Greg were also there, so the five of them often got to talking about different things than the two exchange students. Before this year, they'd barely known Cho. She was part of their larger friendgroup but they hadn't actually formed a close bond with the Ravenclaw, being in different houses. So while Sherlock explained "le transfiguration de la forrure de castor au moucharder" to Irene (John only understood transfiguration), John was chatting with Irene's girlfriend.
They attacked and defended pretty evenly until Jim started blowing things up again. Cedric tried to help as best as he could, having given up on finding the rat and Harry... Harry screamed in pain, on the other side of the graveyard as Pettigrew cut open his arm. Cedric turned around in devastation but was nearly hit by a curse so he had to continue fighting the two Durmstrang students. That was, until all of them turned towards the loud splash in the cauldron. Jim and Sebastian stared in awe, strengthened their Protegos and neared it, which gaveCedric a chance to flee and find Harry. John and Sherlock now cursed Pettigrew, still unarmed. Once the animagus was lying on the ground, something rose out of the cauldron. Jim and Sebastian grabbed into their marked arms and Sherlock, John, Cedric and Harry stared in shock as Lord Voldemort arose once more. Sherlock froze but John pulled him by the hand. Up and back towards Harry and Cedric. "ACCIO PORTKEY!", he yelled. The portkey flew towards them, but so did the snake-like figure. Harry screamed in pain and held his scar as he came closer. The portkey was grabbed onto and for a split second John thought Voldemort had made it, but only the four boys arrived back at Hogwarts.
Mike now spoke up. "Oh hello, I'm Mike. Who are you?" He held out his hand over the table. Sherlock ogled it. Mike retracted. "Not a handshaker?" "No. Sherlock Holmes." Molly now looked over and her eyes nearly fell out of her head. She and Mike had been in deep conversation and only noticed John and Sherlock now. "M-Molly". A blush spread over her cheeks. Sherlock practically scanned them. "You're the guy Stella won't shut up about.", he then established. "Awh, that's sweet of her!", Mike remarked. Sherlock nodded, not seeming to care too much about that. "And you both dislike Quidditch I suppose? But have an affinity for healing? Interesting paste by the way, can I borrow some for an experiment?" Molly couldn't seem to get a word out. Mike eyed her with suspicion while agreeing to Sherlocks proposal. "Excellent" Sherlock then continued to nibble at his piece of Victoria sponge that John had loaded onto his plate no questions asked after he had found out about Sherlocks eating habits.
So much new information. The stories their clothes and movement told Sherlock. Irene, who was sitting next to him, kept constant eye contact with an asian girl a few metres down the table. "Sherlock, 2 am sharp, what can you tell me about her?", she asked at some point during the feast. "Other than that the girl has captured your attention?" She furrowed a brow. Sherlock sighed:"Fine. 5th year. Girl next go her is her best friend. Upset, possibly because of the mail this morning, which contents revealed something she did not like, also likely it had something to do with her older brother. Tense relationship. She does sports.  Quidditch. From her build and movement I am assuming seeker. Currently not in a relationship as far as I can tell. That's enough to be going on with her, don't you think? Go ahead. Make your move." Irene flashed her pearly white teeth in a shark-like, sarcastic smile. She got up from her seat and walked over to where the girl was sitting, blaming the food over there as the reason for her visit. She quickly fell into conversation with the girl. Sherlock was almost smirking.
As John reentered the Great Hall alongside a few of his fellow Hufflepuffs, like 4th year Hannah Abbot, 5th year Molly Hooper, 6th year Cedric Diggory and his friendgroup, the Beauxbatons students were standing right in the middle of the room, unsure where to sit. John smiled friendly and in an attempt to wave that was forgotten soon after, raised his hand rather awkwardly. Some of the French boys and girls looked his way, a few smiling. Others smirking. Others expressionless. A curly haired boy with a pale skintone and remarkable cheekbones frowned. John shook his head at his own weird and embarrassing hand gesture and quickly got over to his table.
"No physical fight aside from the headwounds." "They didn't expect it?", John asked. "No, I think they did." John frowned. "Look, there's a picnic mat. They sat gathered around it. But one side's open. There was a fourth. That person killed the other three." "Maybe the killer just moved the three." "No, that would've left trails." John nodded. "So someone they knew", he stated. Sherlock agreed. "Lestrade, check their identities and ask friends and family members." "On it!", he said and phoned the police station to do just that. Now Victor joined them, having pried Sally and her flirting away. John was examining the bodies. "Only recently deceased. Maybe ten hours." "It's like 10 in the morning, who would go for a picnic at midnight?", Victor asked. "Someone interested in astonomy", John answered. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Last night was some can't-miss starshower. I read about it in the papers." "So three stargazers die watching the nightsky?", Victor asked. "They were four. The fourth was the murderer." Lestrade came back and announced that the friends and family of the victims were being brought in for questioning. So Sherlock, John and Victor took a cab to the police station to do the questioning. "Ah, I've forgotten how much fun this was!", Victor laughed, nudging Sherlock and John in the side. Sherlock smiled at him and then looked at John. John could've sworn he'd seen his pupils dilating but when Sherlock looked away, he convinced himself it had just been a trick of the light.
They collapsed onto the ground and the crowd went wild. Confused applauding ensued and everyone started cheering. John was the first to get up, nerves still buzzing from all the adrenaline. "You!", he snarled at Moody, who was approaching. Johns wand pressed into the fake aurors chest after he disarmed him. Moody gaped in shock but John was disarmed as well, by none other than Albus Dumbledore. Sherlock got up as well, leaving only Harry and Cedric on the ground, clutching to each other. "You have to arrest him." Dumbledore stared at them in disbelief. " He isn't Alastor Moody, he's an imposter." The crowd got quieter. "He helped in the resurrection of Voldemort!", Harry let out. Everyone turned towards him "What did you say?", Dumbledore asked calmly. "He's back", Cedric confirmed. Now not a sound was to be heard. "You know this how?" "We saw him", Harry said. "And so did we", John agreed. Sherlock nodded and turned back to where Moody stood. Except that he wasn't there anymore. "Moody!" Sherlock ran after him. John joined in. "Petrificus Totalus!" So that was taken care of.
John arrived at the train station and was picked up by his mother. She immediately hugged him. "John. I can't believe you're home, I've missed you!" She pressed kisses to his cheeks. John smiled at her. Her eyes had dark circles under them and her eyes were tired. "I've missed you too, Ma"
John was on the lookout. He was usually psyched about dangerous missions, but he wasn't having any of this Stealing-from-Snape business. Once Sherlock had filled his pockets with occamy eggshell, squill bulb and thyme tincture, the two swiftly fled the dungeons. On their way up they heard a creaking sound. Sherlock instinctively pulled John closer to him, looking for a hiding place. But John knew the castle a little better and pulled his friend behind a tapestry. "Moody", Sherlock whispered and cast a confundus in the general direction of the noise. It seemed to work, as Moody didn't make any witty comments as he usually would, always seeing through everything. "What's he doing down here?", John asked once Moody had decended all the stairs. Sherlock peeked out of the tight space "I believe we've found our potions thief. As Moody limped back up the stairs, John saw Sherlock inhale. "Definitely boomslang skin. He's the thief Snape was going on about", Sherlock whispered once Moody was further away. "Why would he need polyjuice potion?", Sherlock said aloud. "He's all about vigilance, maybe it's self-preservation." "Yes, maybe", Sherlock answered, not convinced. John quietly coughed, drawing attention to their position. Their bodies were pressed against the wall and each other, nudged into the small space behind the tapestry. Sherlock nodded awkwardly and stepped out, John following him.
While descending the stairs, John remarked: "The Potions Master is Professor Snape. His presence is a bit unpleasant at times." "Oh. Well my presence is unpleasant at all times, so I'm sure we'll get along splendidly." John gulped. He tried to suppress a grin but it didn't really work. "Your facial expression suggests physical pain, please tell me I'm wrong." They've reached the dungepns by now. "Oh, not at all, I'm-" the door opened and Professor Snape almost ran into them. "Watson. What are you doing here?" "Sir, I'm just showing him around." "Sherlock Holmes." Their stares met. It was a battle of the giants. "You should not be here unsupervised." Snape motioned for them to go and they slowly left the dungeons.
Every Hogwarts student watched with eager when the other schools were supposed to arrive. "It's a bird!" "No you buffoon, it's a flying house". They were both wrong. A gigantic carriage, led by abnormally large pegasi landed. Out of it came the pastel-blue clothed girls and boys of Beauxbatons.
Sherlock looked devastated. "What? I did not predict that!" John was stumped. Harry stood up, looking pale as ever, and slowly walked up the Great Hall like it was his own funeral march. Not even Dumbledore smiled. After Harry they soon entered the chamber too, sending the other students away. Most of them stood up and left, John amd Sherlock being some of the last one to get up. "John, this may sound crazy but..." John stared at him sideways. "I dont think Harry put his name in." "Sherlock, what makes you say that? Harry's name got spit out of the goblet. Surely he must have found a way to cheat. Anything else doesnt make sense." "No, that's the conclusion most would draw. The other possibility, seemingly unlikely but much more probable than the 'obvious' ", he highlighted that word by mimicking apostrophes with his fingers, "conclusion, is that someone older put his name in without Harry's knowledge or consent. Did you not see Harry's face, posture or surprise? Someone is forcing him to do something he doesn't want to do." "Are you sure? What if he acted?" Sherlock gave him a 'Really?' look. "He has no motive. And that wasn't acting. I mean do you actually think that someone who has been in no less than four life threatening situations, quidditch non-included, would willingly enter a tournament in which people have died before? And its not because he seeks fame, because he doesn't. Have you seen him? He's famous by birth but his upbringing taught him to not be affected by that. He doesn't want the fame and he doesn't want to die.", Sherlock tattered down, now breathless. John considered that. "I know it's your emotional impulse, Cedric is your friend and not the attention he deserves is shifted towards a boy already dripping of said attention. But please remain logical so we can get to the why." John breathed in and out deeply. "Youre right, you're absolutely right!", he admitted. "that was amazing", he then muttered. And is Sherlock, before continuing to talk again, straightened up the tiniest bit and smiled a little, neither of them would mention it. "So why..." "Well why? Does someone want Harry to die? Or to get the money? Or the attention?", John asked Sherlock. Sherlock, having his hands folded unter his chin, then said "Haven't the faintest. Tomorrow." John nodded and they parted ways.
The whole next week John felt like something was up with Sherlock. But John knew that Sherlock didn't like talking about his (supposedly non-existent) emotions, so he didn't press it. They continued to spend their time together and joke and exchange notes in class and brew potions and... 'Wow we are spending an awful lot of time together, aren't we?', John asked himself. When John saw Sherlock and Irene come into the Great Hall one morning, in deep conversation, he was glad that somebody was able to reach through to Sherlock and talk about whatever's been troubling him. After the couple parted ways, Sherlock looked much happier and more hopeful. He even smiled at John slightly when he sat down. "So the Yule Ball is this weekend", was the first thing talked about in the morning. Mike wriggled his eyebrows. "Johnnyboy, have you got anyone?" Sherlock now looked much more interested in the conversation now. John shook his head.  Sherlock opened his mouth but closed it again when John gave him a questioning look. "I dont even want to go, if I'm honest. But it's mandatory, so I'll go alone. And no, I haven't got a date, because I don't want one." John now looked into the general direction of Cedric and Joana, so he didn't notice Sherlock slightly gulping. But when he did look at Sherlock again the joy and hope had left his eyes.
In the Great Hall with the weather-accurate sky, Irene dashed towards him and flung her arms around Sherlock. "Can you refrain from using me as your 'heat-pillow' everywhere at any given moment?", Sherlock grunted. "Ooh, like you're above the need for body heat, I'm cold as ice and so are you, you drama queen." He sighed. Irene was completely aware of his shivering. But she did let go of him once the Hogwarts and Durmstrang students entered.
When the feast was over and the dancing time finally arrived, John spotted Sherlock on the dancefloor. He apparently didn't have a date, but everyone kept switching it up anyways so it was not like anyone noticed, or cared for that matter. He thought Sherlock tried to approach him when they both went in the same direction, but he just asked Mike's girlfriend, Stella, for a dance, since Mike was dancing with Molly at the moment. Mike! He needed to ask Mike whether he knew about Sherlocks not-relationship with Irene. "Excuse me", he mumbled and tapped on Mikes shoulder. "Care for a dance?" Mike laughed. "Sure, whatever." They turned to Molly who nodded them off as one of the Durmstramg boys stepped closer, asking for her hand. "Did you know that Sherlock and Irene aren't dating?", he half-whispered. "Umm yeah", Mike responded, now looking at a point behind John's shoulder. John turned them around and saw Irene and Cho dancing closely. "That doesn't mean anything..." "But this does", Mike said in that same 'John-are-you-being-serious-right-now' voice. John looked again and they were now snogging. "Yeah, got it", he let out, a bit ashamed. He let go of Mike and turned around, walking off to sit at a table and question his life decisions. "You'd never believe what a brilliant dancer Jim is!", Molly squealed behind him.
John settles down behind his desk, swallows, and takes a deep breath. Two years, eleven months, and fifteen days of silence. His eyes trace the shape of his office, lingering over the handwritten sheets of music lovingly framed, before looking across the desk into the wrong pair of eyes. He lets his hard expression ask the question; this once, good news or bad, Mycroft
Sherlock stretches one hand toward him, holding a tight rectangle of paper between two fingers, and the tremor is showing again, helping the ragged page uncurl from its folds.
He sat up, and his eyes, silver in the late afternoon sunlight, searched my face, ignoring his mug. I was reminded of the inn, of his cut crystal tumbler flashing in the firelight. A different kind of fear, this, but related, somehow, to those long moments of doubt out on the moor.

For one taut moment, Sherlock stared at her while John decided what to do with the phone; call 999 or…? Keep their police friends and the interfering brother

"To test your pressure points." The picture on the left: Mary leaning too close to the bonfire for her own safety, wide eyes showing her terror.
"You. Thought you could track down three — no, you thought you could tear down his entire web in a few
, whatever shape that took. The things Sherlock wasn't about to admit he wanted, either, with or without the brink he'd teetered on, there at the kitchen door.
"I am Mary Morstan." Sherlock's lip twitched upward angrily, hand tensing on the gun, and she lifted her hands higher, truly beginning to fear his fraying control. "But that isn't my given name. Mary Morstan was born four years ago. And she died at birth almost forty years before that."
But Sherlock examines John's face with shadowed eyes, before he looks away again, toward the window. John wonders if he's showing too much of what he feels, or if Sherlock is at a loss to understand what he sees. Wonders how much the past three years have changed
look at me." John stood in front of Sherlock's chair; close enough he and Mary could join hands while Mary kept hold of Sherlock's. Almost close enough to take Sherlock's free hand.
I reached out to trace one fingertip across a cheekbone. Of course it was a risk, one I was asking us both to take. I caught his free hand, rubbed a quiet thumb over skin and muscle, the webless space between his fingers, the tendons spreading like violin strings toward the bridge of his knuckles.
Calling out, John clears the last of the stairs and yes, it's Mycroft sitting across from Sherlock, right hand relaxed on his umbrella despite the subtle tension in his shoulders. Sherlock plucks a dissonance from his violin and lies to his brother; John exhales hard in relief but can't shake the feeling he'd abandoned his post when he stormed off last night after Sherlock's peevish spate of insults. Reassured his flatmate is uninjured, John occupies himself checking the damage to the windows while Sherlock and Mycroft shift from national security to picking apart John's lack of love life.
emerge from the despairing wreckage of her new self, of her marriage…Sherlock had a gun and she didn't. Even if she could manage every element perfectly, and disarm Sherlock without hurting him — John would have heard the shot and already be on his way up, would find her standing over Sherlock, would hear everything he had seen and deduced about her. And she didn't want to hurt
John doesn't quite roll his eyes, pointedly indicates the lamp without ever looking at it. "Awake does not necessarily mean ready to discuss."
She watched John scrubbing at his face in dark silhouette, and she wondered, not for the first time, what the telegrams and speech would have been like if weird, wonderful Sherlock, and not dutiful Sholto, had stood as John's best man.
exceptional, though Sherlock hasn't explained what it is about the bottom third of the door handle that distinguishes a good place from a mediocre one; for John, it's enough that the food was hot and the service low-key, the staff staying out of their way and letting them chatter and laugh in the empty restaurant unless signalled for more tea, or another visit from the steam cart.
." Sherlock's voice is muted, otherworldly, but his eyes are clear and cognizant, acknowledging the word and the concept and the implied promises — every intoxicating layer of his attention still pinned on John's next action.
John stepped closer to hear Sherlock's fragile voice, watched his face with frightened, breath-held intensity.
Sherlock had not had an answer about the bonfire that sixth of November; instead, she'd seen the first reluctant thawing of John's anger, as he got drawn into the beginnings of the Underground terrorist case that had been too important to walk away from, that had started off so promisingly with photos of Sherlock's "rats" on the walls, and a video of a train, and excitement in John's voice as clues, questions, and deductions bounced between them to click into place. She'd curled into the red brocade armchair, hugged a pillow to herself, and curbed her own enthusiasm and contributions — some insights might have told Sherlock too much about her, but more than anything, she wanted John to re-connect with Sherlock, remember the adrenaline-tinged teamwork he had missed. Even if he would never admit how much.
My lips tightened. An explanation, in our personal shorthand at least, the green and granite of the Grimpen churchyard — but hardly an excuse. I wasn't exactly flush with friends myself, could count maybe two or three all told, and no other could provide a match for the flame-like flutter I got each time I came home to Baker Street, or left it to investigate the world with him.
He stroked a finger along the top of the glass case with his mounted pipistrelle bat. "We have an excellent partnership, and I know from experience that your qualities are difficult to find at all, much less combined in one person. If we were to let temptation draw us into quagmires that might pull us apart—"
What mattered now was opening up the future — they had all tried to bury their painful pasts, alone, and walk away to something that seemed cleaner, but John was right.
Logically, though, the reason for their missing links ought to be something he and Sherlock have in common and, well, John's fairly certain
criminal masterminds. He'd never meant to hide from either of the Holmeses, nor been fool enough to think he could.
, he has no choice. He braces against the rhythm, regular, predictable, and it does no good. The pain always shocks.
Sherlock takes another drink of water, tongue chasing a stray drop across his lower lip. "The pagers the hostages were given. No leads there."
Sherlock lifts slow hands to the knot at his waist, unties the gown, and drops it off his bare shoulders. He's wearing only thin pyjama trousers underneath, hanging loosely around his hips.
...Magnussen. Everywhere, from every angle, Charles Augustus Magnussen, in the present, in the past. Her past.
," John made the tiniest gesture toward the table by the chair, confusing Mary until she saw the syringe half-hidden under the takeaway bag, "you are the best and the wisest man I have ever known. You saved my life… multiple times, probably in more ways than I know. You, I can forgive now."
So many things he'd done to me, from the very first night when he'd used my phone to text a serial killer, to dosing me with an unknown chemical before setting me up for new nightmares about big dogs and blinding lights because Afghanistan and the bloody pool weren't enough.
John stood still, but his eyes flicked back and forth between the two of them. Sherlock's head came up the rest of the way, slow as a moonrise, til he was gazing at John's face. She finally saw Sherlock illuminated — that elevated state John had struggled to describe a dozen times while they were courting: the jittering eyes that gave only the barest hint of the whirring hard drive behind, ten thousand facts dancing in his mind's eye, connecting in patterns that only he could see.
"Why did you marry me?" John's shoulders were hunched, his gaze on the floor, but his voice still had an army snap to it.
John's heart stutters. He reaches out, wraps his fingers gently around Sherlock's wrist. Has to thrust away the memory of hunting for his pulse on the rainy pavement outside Barts.
John shakes his head, steps back from the doorway — foresight regarding Sherlock's actions if he doesn't, combined with consideration for those who are slumbering (Lestrade sleeping it off in room four, the fisherman's mother in three). John paces back to the window, left index finger jittering over the ashen mark on his thumb, and Sherlock's eyes narrow. The duvet and John's pyjamas (the laurel-green flannel ones, sublimely soft to the fingertips) are rumpled, but he shows no sign that he's slept, nor that he can be coaxed back into the bed, platonically or otherwise.
She blinked. Saw the misery in the droop in Sherlock's shoulders, the tight-folded corners of his lips. Misery, because he had made the same choice, in the name of
). All the reasons for sidestepping the pitfalls of language are still sound. But Sherlock must amend his oversight.
, setting a cable of steel in place of John's spine, a burning pit in the place of his heart. No guarantees, he reminds himself. Never assume.
John nods, once, and doesn't take his eyes off Mycroft until the closing door cuts off his view. With the click of the latch, he sags back into the chair, closing his eyes and bringing his hands up to cover his face.
Sherlock glances back at him, then finishes his slow, savoring bite, prepared this time for the taste of home. He lifts an eyebrow.
Shock jars loose a knot that rises just to the base of John's jaw. This is not — he doesn't — this is —
John leans forward, holding the eye contact. Feels how vitally important it is to pour the sincerity of his own voice into Sherlock's head, to do the only thing he can at the moment to begin countering three solitary years of Moriarty's poison and Sherlock's own doubt.
John finishes off the glass of water and heads back downstairs. The landing door into the kitchen is closed and, when he enters the sitting room, he sees that the sliding doors with their coloured panels have been pulled shut too.
She took him in just as quickly. John was off-balance without Sherlock; had Sherlock passed the tipping point without John? Even in the curtain-dimmed light he looked
Obviously lost in his memories of the Carl Powers case, gripping the pink phone and the trainers in their evidence bag, Sherlock hurries lightly up the stairs without looking back. John, relieved to be out of his line-of-sight for just a moment, to not have to worry about Sherlock's relentless awareness, grips the stair railing hard to steady his pounding head.
Sherlock is silent behind him, neither speaking nor moving for a moment, and John grips the underside of the counter's edge with cutting pressure on his thumbs.
Sherlock's hands are clamped together, white-knuckled, on the table. "I anticipated his endgame, had Molly help me prepare an escape. But I failed to anticipate that I would have to maintain the charade for more than a day or two."
Sherlock crosses to the bedside cupboard, gently pours a cup of water from a pitcher damp with tepid condensation, cold about four hours ago. He extends it in John's direction (smooth gesture, no sharp moves to key him up further).
Or, more to the point, Sherlock seems just as inclined to pick a fight with John while someone else is being
John Watson realizes, when he glances up to her face, that Sergeant Donovan thought he was looking at her knees, too. Really, though, he'd glanced at her left pinkie, the one that bears the Entanglement that ties every soul to its mate, found or unfound, no matter how far away they might be.
He feels himself frown, alarmed by Sherlock's pained expression; Sherlock gropes for his napkin, struggling to swallow the bite in his mouth.
Sherlock slides onto the sheets, pushes the crumpled duvet away with his feet, and  tucks his arms down along his sides; turns his head to look at John, settles into an apprehensive stillness. John watches his eyes until he sees a flicker of acquiescence, and brings the crop down across his back, the tip just crossing the acromion near the point of his shoulder.
Sherlock's own worry and frustration sputter beneath the surface; he hates it when John withdraws like this, withholds himself. He did it when he first agreed to the flatshare, wary of Sherlock's incessant perception, and then he didn't, and now he's doing it again.
to life. I don't know who you were before we met, but you can't fake what you did for me. And I do want to spend the rest of my life with you; we have words to speak still but as long as you stick around to speak them, I can forgive you.
She made herself straighten up, looked at them. At the way John's eyes tracked from her to the photo to Sherlock and back. The way John leaned in, slightly, toward Sherlock, while still looking at her.
"Right. Well. Sleep's done in for the night anyway," John said, shifting to swing his legs over the edge of the bed. She also started to sit up, turning to her side of the bed to keep him from seeing her relief or the nerves prickling at the back of her neck. "The chef at dim sum on Baker Street still owes him. We can get him a takeaway there."
— wrapped, knotted, smooth, frayed, torn, broken, but always incandescent red. So what had he seen, in the lab? The brilliance of that flash, the gilded edges —
John has been surprised more than once since they first met by Sherlock's strength and stamina; he should have known that there was more substance beneath the clothes than his carefully-crafted silhouette suggests. An unexpected flutter of fascination hinders his breathing; Sherlock's frame is starkly beautiful, if underfed at the moment, the muscle lean and defined against his lanky bones.
Sherlock chooses to accept it as a command, exhales in relief. John pulls back, fingers sparking over the oblique marks like a stick rattling along the electric fence; tensions release, words retreat. John adjusts position and stance, and the crop comes down on the welts crosswise, striking again and again until Sherlock is safe once more.
doesn't care how Sherlock knows. He stops in the kitchen long enough to pour himself a glass of water, then heads upstairs. Removes the pill bottle from his sock drawer and stares at the label — seeing only flashbacks of inexplicable red. John has been so sure, since the evening with the dim sum, that Sherlock is like him, isn't bound to anybody; he's been selfishly reassured every time he watches that bare left hand pointing at evidence, gesticulating in explanation...
"Whatever he said about grooming you, remember the object of his game this time was messing with your head. All our heads, but yours in particular. He cut you off from your friends so you'd only have
"Just a few minutes," John insists, crumbling the tentative connections. Sherlock's lip jerks into a snarl, but the doctor's eyes are calm, stern, matter-of-fact; he pulls the chair a few inches farther from the bed. Watches and waits.
For a split second, something painful tries to twist free of the flat, hard line of Sherlock's mouth, before he lashes it down again.
), and she cautiously eased out around the doorframe, watching Sherlock: flushed with adrenaline, eyes fixed on her over the barrel of the gun, his free hand stretched toward the other doorway, holding John just out of her line-of-sight.
, she meant; to her, even without tone of voice, the text read almost like a plea. Though she could be seeing what she wanted to see. "He didn't sign it, either."
Committed, John sways closer to Sherlock, body taking the initiative while his recalcitrant mind remains one step behind, still struggling to maintain a poise that no longer matters.
— crosses Sherlock's face, setting off a tic in his cheek, a crack in the marble façade. The calculation slips from eyes no longer hyper-focused on the consuming problem of finding Moriarty's next move, and all at once John glimpses the frantic exhaustion of a prey animal on his last legs, unable to escape or to rest; a creature on the verge of bursting his own heart, or veering away from safety into some despairing sacrifice to lead the predator away from his nest.
"And you didn't believe it either." Sherlock's shoulders are rolled in toward his chest; running his fingers into his hairline has left his ginger crop even more unruly.
John's lips twist, the double-entendre as unwelcome as it was inadvertent. He finishes the water and comes closer to set the cup down, a faint hint of the forgotten limp hitching his stride. Sherlock frowns again, searching the telltale tilt of pelvis and shoulders for other signs of resurrected pain.
With someone else, he'd provide verbal reassurance or praise, after, but the disturbing memory of how badly shaken Sherlock had been when he'd asked John not to speak lingers. With Sherlock, he worries about drawing him up too soon.
have," he snarls, more harshly than he intends, and opens his eyes again, pivoting to face Sherlock. "I survived Afghanistan. I would have survived your war, and not by being abandoned on the sidelines. I would have
. But offering me the coffee —" He cuts himself off, throws his hands in the air. "You were being you."
Mycroft draws a brief breath, more words on his tongue, but John can see the alternate paths of the conversation playing out in his blink, getting him nowhere; he presses his lips together and stands stiffly. There's no more information to be had, then; Sherlock's work is done and he's on his way home.
Mary opened her mouth, then closed it again; spread her free hand, asking for peace or a moment to think, to respond, to come up with anything but white noise.
John has to close his eyes again, briefly, force himself to take a deep breath in and out before he can reach across the gap between them to take the offering.
He sighs harshly, settling into a low slump in his chair, rubbing fingers across his forehead. At least the room is mercifully dim; the curtains have been pulled closed over the chipboard in the blown-out windows.
Just the one strike, just for this moment because John doesn't trust himself to apply more until he's seen the welt rise, assessed Sherlock's sensitivity — and he can pretend he's being terribly rational but his hand tightens on the grip as he watches the white skin change colours, watches untouchable Sherlock quiver.
me." A deep ragged breath, and John's despair finally slips free of his compulsive stoicism. "It can be very lonely, being your lover."
But it was my curious hands that slid beneath the fabric of his jacket, rested a moment on skin-warmed linen before tugging his shirttail loose to explore the smooth expanse of his lower back.
"Sherlock..." I started, following him — always following, always a step or two behind — and I dropped my kit by the door; vibrating with the low amber thrum in my blood. Stripped my jacket off and hung it on the hook behind the door, cursing myself for an idiot. Should have known better than to touch, to try and tilt the fragile balance between us.
And she wanted to watch them work together, so different from she and John at the clinic. So bright, Sherlock's light and John's focusing lens.
Sherlock looked down at his hand on the arm of the chair, at the spoon in his fingers. Mary looked into John's face again, met his gaze somberly. His jaw tightened.
John know about his new flatmate? Tall. Arrogant and beautiful as the devil himself. Brilliant and obtuse at the same time.
She had no idea how to help heal the rift between John and his former friend and flatmate, much as she wanted to. Like their nighttime dreams, Sherlock was an unspokenly forbidden topic in their home. John had struggled to talk about him before, when they'd both thought him dead; John's repressed fury in reaction to Sherlock's shocking return and underlying betrayals ran so deep it terrified her. Too much emotion for her loving man to cope with, she thought. Sometimes he could be so awfully bloody English.
Though Sherlock hasn't found Moriarty yet, it obviously isn't for lack of massive, concentrated effort. John licks his lower lip, realising the things in this room are only the core of Sherlock's investigation; no telling how much farther he's cast his nets, given the incomprehensibles spread through the rest of their living space.
He apologises; she pats his arm and tells him it's all right. He remembers her father is also a veteran and knows what she's probably thinking. She starts stepping more heavily on the carpet or shutting the doors with perhaps a bit more force than necessary, making sure he knows where she is. And he doesn't mention out loud how grateful he is for it.
The soft noises of the lunch crowd downstairs at Speedy's carry up to John; feels like it's been an age since he came back from his run rather than a few hours. He returns to the chair, picks up
"John…" Sherlock said, with a growing waver in his voice. "I know that I am not what I was. But you asked me not to be dead, and I moved hell and earth to make that possible — because… because… I thought you needed me."
searches his face, rolling the crop, breath catching in the back of his throat for more questions...
Between the row the night before, and the one shaping up to start, John's not quite sure he'll be welcome, but Sherlock, apparently, would be
"You're ruthless, Sherlock. You always have been. Ruthless and driven. Put those two together and you just come out looking a heartless bastard. But — "
He doesn't resist the urge to trace a finger down the mark, to feel the heat of the blood beneath the skin. Satisfaction — calm, rational satisfaction, that he judged the force correctly, he lies to himself — flows warm and sleek through his muscles. John strikes again, and again; energised, he envisions a narrow slanted lattice down Sherlock's back from shoulder to just above his hip, and wills it into reality stroke by stroke by stroke.
Small, quiet words, falling into Sherlock's deep reservoir of cause-and-effect, setting off echoes of inadequacy and self-reproach, ripples of slowing time and heightened awareness: within every crinkled line narrowing John's eyes, every twitch of panic and dismay he can no longer quite contain on hearing his bête noire spoken aloud, Sherlock sees accreted traces of misery, yearning, previously mal-interpreted disaffections.
John's eyes followed the line of the pointing gun, raked her up and down (searching for blood, for injury, for weapons, for reasons), then snapped back to Sherlock. Mary gripped the edge of the kitchen door, preparing to rise.
I took to my feet, telling him so with my steady gaze. Glanced at my kit and out the door before looking back at him. Reminding him I hadn't been forced to follow him across that threshold; if I'd intended to leave, nothing would have stopped me going upstairs to pack.
. An unwelcome touch or a demand that he eat right this minute will put him back on the defensive. Far better to Keep Calm and Carry On.
, nearly a year ago — Moriarty's explosive threat had brought into stark relief how much they depended on each other; how confused and inadequate everyone else was in understanding their unconventional needs and desires, the unique ways they relate to their dangerous world and to each other.
He's going back for a second mouthful when he's startled into glancing up by the quiet clink of Sherlock's fork against the table.
"Sherlock," he finally says, some indecipherable melange of emotions flattening his voice so he barely recognises it.
His hand dipped into his pocket and his knuckles shifted in a familiar pattern, fingers closing around the grip of a firearm.
He straightens, looks at the tidy stack of folders on his desk, and pushes to his feet. He won't collapse and he won't go to London. What he
"Different brands, but boxes of each vanished from the same PageOne delivery truck in Chatham on fifteenth February. The driver was investigated but didn't steal anything, nor did he recall anything of value to me in tracking who did. I'm certain Moriarty has destroyed the other stolen pagers, or hoarded them out of sight, but I've set what little I can in place to detect them if they should be put into use. The nobodies who connected the pagers to the different networks, sans legitimate customer accounts, were hired pseudonymously on a work board for freelance programmers. Various frequency bands, network transmitters, emails, IPs and proxies were involved, but suffice to say none of it has led anywhere useful."
That faint, battered fluttering about John's chest again, but even as it rises he knows his answer cannot change.
to be happy. I made you get soup this morning because you love Sherlock and you miss him, and I wanted you two to heal whatever rift has taken hold between you."
Still, the firmest order in the world can't stop Sherlock thinking, and tending body and mind at the same time hasn't proven impossible so long as John's on his game. He nods sharply, shifts his feet enough to let Sherlock know he's moving, reaches out to wrap Sherlock's hand around the water bottle.
." There was a flicker in his eyes, anger and hurt from then and now, and Mary could hear the accusation: You'd have seen through her earlier, if you'd
Sherlock doesn't fool himself that he's banished John's trust issues or frustration just by surprising him — but by changing the landscape so drastically, he's at least brought John back to his most stunning strength: the blank page, the willingness to cooperate without yet understanding, the flexibility to wait and see where Sherlock will take him now they've veered off the beaten (broken) path.
"Sherlock. Look up." She wasn't asking; she hoped he could give John one more burst of energy, one more moment of that intense
He paused. Closed his eyes. Took a deep breath of his own. Mary realized she was gripping Sherlock's hand a little too hard.
He turns, looking down at John, chest to chest at close quarters. Back military-rigid. Hair rumpled, lightly laced with sweat. Eyes a harried hazel mess of John-love, yes, but also John-anger and John-forbearance and John-exasperation. Lines in his face hardened, deepened; weariness that would be too easy to interpret as purely stressful, physical, but some things in the Book of John Sherlock has learned to read too well — he's weary
The track marks are neat and discreet; Sherlock isn't a street junkie, hurrying to shoot up in some dark corner before he can be discovered, and he is undoubtedly deft enough to avoid the through-and-through punctures and venous bruising that leave the ugliest traces. But he hasn't bothered to hide the evidence altogether. The only bit of reassurance is the rate of healing John sees on the older marks; the injections aren't too frequent, Sherlock hasn't — yet — been coasting from high to high, unable to function without.
Perhaps the crisp bit of self-damnation Sherlock had snapped at Anderson has something more to do with it — John won't yet hazard a guess at where that "diagnosis" had come from, but the man is definitely...unique.
), but his throat clenches all the same at the angry hurt in John's eyes. John straightens up with a grimace, pulling hard on the reins of his self-control. Brings his hand to his face and pinches at his temples with forefinger and thumb, dragging a hard breath in through his nose. Continues, voice more measured but body language still shouting.
He stands slowly, this strange ginger scarecrow of Sherlock, staring at John as if afraid to blink, before taking slow, deliberate steps forward.
A printed page, ripped from a book; folded and refolded, much-crumpled and stained, very soft under John's fingers. Beneath the pagehead that reads
"Sherlock," John repeats, trying to steady him on his feet, and before he can begin to interpret the chaos he sees in grey eyes, he's pulled tight against the slippery nylon jacket: Sherlock's forearms pinned across his back and neck, Sherlock's face pressed down into his hair.
"No," he said, the word so strangled and horrible she almost didn't recognize his voice in it, forcing her to look up again. "No, Sherlock. She can't — she isn't?"
than surprise — he'd felt looking back at Sherlock's impish smile, when an amused Angelo had delivered the cane to their doorstep.
Sherlock's field of mastery has always been words, logic; not just linear thought but brilliant leaps between invisible systems of causality, A to B to Q to Z'. Sometimes I thought we got on so well because I didn't
He closes his eyes, trying to remember, to guess whether the darkness around Jim or that strange golden-red flare could have had anything to do with the blurring and splitting he'd seen. Such a contrast to Jim's bright Entanglement, piercing right through Molly's chest like a spear...Not bound to her. Clearly bound to someone.
John swallows, feels his lips tighten and honestly doesn't know if the closed-off feeling in his throat is trapped tears or laughter. The throb of his pulse is fading from the spot where Sherlock gripped him, and he already wants to call that all-too-real touch back.
And subtler things, beyond the usual ways his obsessions drive him to extremes: little markers of post-traumatic stress John doubts Sherlock would recognise as such in himself, let alone acknowledge to anyone else.
Sherlock's eyes close, and his mind tumbles weightlessly, exiled from a body reduced to raw response. Packs of words —
"You do? She — she loves you. I believe that. But she's… a tool, a sharp tool, the kind you don't leave lying around, that doesn't get placed in — in a
Far too slowly, he turned back to face her, pale eyes asking her to ignore the wayward tear that had spilled down one unshaven cheek. His eyes flickered, but he couldn't seem to look at John.
John tries to help him focus again, but feels less useful than the skull when Sherlock ignores him, quarreling with Lestrade until the soft chirp of Sherlock's phone pulls him off into some absent reverie, barely answering John's questions.
"Why'd you lie?" he asks, when the last trace of Mycroft's Entanglement vanishes and the slam of the car door outside confirms they're definitely alone. "You've got nothing on, not a single case."
I watched him walk restlessly around the perimeter of the room, in and out of the fading light: circling our work desk, touching my phone, straightening the handwritten composition next to his computer. I held my tongue — no sense contradicting him when I wasn't the one he was arguing with. He considered it a survival trait, keeping the palace of his thoughts clean and pristine, without the colourful mess the rest of us managed with more or less grace. But whether he liked it or not, the brilliant mind was only a part of him. The moment on the landing had loosed some buried desire from his titanium willpower, and he'd pinned me against the door where I couldn't slip away from him—
John shakes his head over the state of the bathroom, lifts a cereal bag half-full of foul granola out of the sink so he can wash his hands, and is on the verge of shouting some complaint out through the kitchen — until he swipes the cereal box up from the floor and hears a familiar hard plastic rattle. The words die in his mouth, and he stares blindly at the ugly graphics on the front of a box that has lurked untouched in the back of a cupboard since the day he moved in. Looks inside, and carefully shakes the sharps' box concealed in the bottom half. He estimates the number of used syringes within.
"Everywhere. Norway. Russia. Tibet. Uzbekistan. I was in Khartoum a few days ago. Montpellier this morning. I tracked them all down." Sherlock speaks to the table in distant tones, far-too-familiar shadows in his dark voice. "None of you are in danger anymore."
"She is not who you think. She — she..." Sherlock's voice faltered, his eyes flicking ever so briefly back and forth; he did not let his focus stray or his aim waver, but Mary could see he wanted to look around at his web of connections, his chaotic tangle, find the simplest answer to convince John Sherlock wasn't off his nut, hallucinating, or wrapped in the paranoia of drugs and not deductions.
John's fist had tightened around his forgotten phone until it bit into his hand, until he slid phone into pocket. With clenched teeth, he pivoted, ever so slightly, to face her. To place his shoulder, ever so subtly, closer to Sherlock's.
"For all the reasons I said yes to that first date, and all the reasons I moved in with you. Because you're clever, and funny, and you don't give a lot of yourself, your real self, not your doctorly self, to strangers but when you do you're just...amazing. And also because you're a stubborn bastard who would debate with the statue of Lord Nelson if you took a mind to and you'd probably at least argue him to a draw." She felt hot tears spill over her lashes and onto her cheeks. "Because I feel alive when I'm with you, even when you tell me I can't do something and I have to contradict you. Because I've never felt anything like this and don't imagine I ever will again. Because I want
John tilts his head, assessing Sherlock in the same quiet, challenging way he'd assessed Mycroft, one day a lifetime ago.
She heard the revolver's double-action trigger advancing the cylinder for another shot, and she covered her head with her hands as though they might protect her from bullets or consequences. She knew how to listen over the thunder in her ears for John sprinting up the stairs, but didn't know what to do with the cascade of fear washing through her mind: all the terrible things that might happen next.
Despite the hot tightness in my throat I let him go; I gave him space, shifted back and picked up my mug. Took a sip, swallowing back ambered hazel and a thousand stinging shards of glass. Offered Sherlock the second cup.
When he finishes the second set of lashes, completing the pattern of diamonds across Sherlock's back, John is approaching a sort of calm centeredness — more crucially, however, Sherlock's eyes are glazed over and he's the most relaxed John has ever seen him. Anyone else's breathing might be ragged with pain or arousal or some combination of the two; Sherlock's is level and even. John's fingers flex around the handle of the riding crop and he reins in the desire to see how much further he can go.
Sherlock stood taller, shoulders dropping a fraction, and his eyes shifted, gathering information, the dark under narrowed lids giving way to silver-blue. "Who is Mary Morstan?"
"An experiment?" Dangerous for him to agree, given the argument that had lasted the whole trip back from Devon, but a plausible lie nonetheless. Providing him an out, if he wanted to take it.
The largest problem is: John isn't about to leave him alone, and he knows all too well when Sherlock is in this mode he can only push so far before Sherlock lashes back — and he knows exactly where John is most vulnerable. John doesn't intend to lose his temper enough to stalk away this time, but Sherlock can still make it damned uncomfortable for him to stay.
, he keeps thinking, listening distantly to the phone ringing in his ear and the police arguing in the kitchen —
"All right," John says, voice thick; he brushes the back of his hand over Sherlock's cheek. "No more thinking."
John starts to ask how, decides not only does he not care but he's much more interested in the show in front of him.
Sherlock let the spoon slide out of his other hand; his eyes were downcast, lined with pain. Mary could see how John's anger tore at him. "You don't want answers about any of it. I don't know what you do want. But I can stop her leaving you."
"Everyone you care about," John finishes into the vibrating silence left behind. "Anyone who might care for you."
"How can you possibly make such a promise?" He came around the back of his chair and I stepped to meet him, face to face in front of the mirror over the fireplace. I set a hand on the mantel, next to the skull that had previously been his only friend.
Sherlock's eyes were closed again; I ignored the implicit 'do not disturb', reached out to take one slender wrist,  and watched his eyes open in consternation. Settled my fingers on the ulnar artery, appreciated the accelerating throb transmitted from Sherlock's heart, lifted his hand.
When Sherlock whips out of the chair to snap at Mrs Hudson, still caught up in his own personal whirlwind, John sits down heavily at the desk. Nominally, he's watching for the website to finish locating the dead woman's phone, but really he needs to turn his back on the sitting room and kitchen, too many people, too many red strands stretching across each other in a chaotic tangle. Lestrade pulls back as well, and for a brief moment John's world goes back to an approximation of normal — his leg even aches a little, after their lunatic chase through the streets of London.
He can't help a faint smile at the bittersweet irony of having to explain a situation for Sherlock — that and the rightness of his friend's disdainful sniff and familiar
. Except he hadn't, precisely, not until Mycroft had shown up. "Well. I guessed, anyway. I hoped. Tea?"
Eight days after Mycroft's visit, John is still tense but less jumpy. With no patients and Karen gone home, he almost enjoys the solitude for the last hour of the workday, finishing the remainder of his paperwork. Finally he collects his jacket and locks up the office. After a quick scan of his surroundings, he heads up the road toward his house through a cool spring evening with few clouds to block the last of the day's sun.
The detective's eyes are fixed on him, probably reading every nuance of John's expression, weighing the weary tilt of his head, analyzing the angles at which his stubble is growing in at the end of this long, very long day... but John's fairly certain deciphering the reasons for
John pales, lips tightening — fleeting fear, or regret, or anger — impossible to say, he's too quick to sweep the evidence away with several rapid blinks.
He'd followed Mike into the laboratory at Barts and been greeted out of the blue with "Afghanistan or Iraq?" and by the time the bizarre conversation had ended, and Sherlock Holmes finally introduced himself, John knew that this was a man who was going to have an impact on the world, one who wouldn't wait for "nothing" to happen to him.
, at what we already had together, and his lips were soft and luscious against mine. We fit together like twinned rare-earth magnets brought close enough at last, drawn together with a force that shook us both.
Mary gave John a dismayed look and carefully came out into the sitting room just far enough to pick up the soup. Her face, her chest, both felt numb. She leaned one hand on the door to the landing, and held the bag out at her arm's length; a peace offering, an apology. A goodbye, if it came to that. This was a life it would devastate her to lose, not one from which she could just cut her losses, cut and run. But she dreaded she would be asked — or told — to leave.
To John's surprise, after watching Sherlock avoid food all evening long, he eats heartily now that the battle is done — to the point of stealing one of John's shrimp dumplings with his chopsticks.
, this strange connection that had grown quietly between them — from the first cab ride when John told Sherlock he was amazing, to the breath-stealing punch-in-the-gut moment when death strolled away from them alongside a midnight swimming pool. Proof that the leaps they'd taken some time afterwards, vaulting from kisses to caresses to coitus to collar, were not some post-traumatic fling.
John comes to life all at once, thrashing out of a chlorine-tinged dream into calm air and sunshine.
Not that he needs their help to know that things are almost over between he and Sarah. Her tightening Entanglement shows her soulmate is getting closer, and though her kindness and humour have eased his loneliness, he's not about to stand in their way.
A bit public, compared to the uncountable marks hidden in undergarments; a bit odd, compared to circles of blush-pink on the ring finger, or chaste sapphire lacing the palms and fingers of clasped hands, or a cerise lip-print on the cheek or neck or earlobe. Telling enough to earn them a few curious or knowing or disgusted looks, when Sherlock doesn't bother to shroud his imprint under a high collar or his scarf.
Feeling useless is its own sort of hell, one John knows he's ill-equipped to fight. Sherlock's focus has been so intense he's practically been reduced to monosyllables around the flat, and there doesn't seem to be any way for John to assist. He's watched — will continue to watch — Sherlock's back. With his hidden, forbidden gun, John will follow him in his seemingly random quests around London, listen to incomprehensible conversations with unlikely people, and try to keep scanning for any bystander who might not be so innocent. But he's given up trying to
"You're abnormally attracted...to dangerous situations and people, John, so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you've fallen in love with conforms to that pattern?"
Under the table, the cat hisses. Sherlock sits very still, absorbing John's anger into his skin like rain on chalk, looking down at something he holds between his two fists, pressed together on the table.
"We're done here," John says; voice taut with the same force stilling his hands. He doesn't want to be looking at the man in front of him, wants the sudden, feral surge of adrenaline-spiked anger back in its box.
"What he does best." John casts a generous spoonful of salt into the water in the big pot. "I didn't share your 'note' with him, but I assume he knew all along."
Sherlock doesn't answer, just pulls himself up straight in the chair as John carries the plates to the table. He offers a pale smile in thanks, accepts a fork, and leans in with some eagerness.
She knew immediately, with the eyes of a nurse and those of her darker days, what she would see if she were to push up that sleeve.
She looked back at John. They all needed help they hadn't asked for. And if they were going to get through this at all intact, they had to help each other.
Sherlock stands abruptly, the armchair barks against the floor, and he strides through the dark to the door between their rooms.
"Try to remember there's a woman here who might die," he says; Sherlock finally looks away from the data in front of him and directly at John, frost-coloured eyes edged with hard antagonism.
It's harder to read Sherlock's face in profile, but his eyes search restlessly across some inner landscape, his throat and jaw twitching. And yet he manages to restrain himself to his promised simplicity: "I'm sorry."
"Solving crimes, saving lives, bringing justice to bear on murderers — that can be a rush. Even when it's grim. But now you know what I know: killing is filthy miserable work, and it doesn't feel like a game. For you, for me — at the end of it all, after the adrenaline come-down, all we really want to do is go home, if we have a home to go to, and if not, find a nice quiet hole and sleep for about a week. Forget, if we can. Numb the knowledge away if we can't; go out, get drunk, get a shag, get stoned. Even when we know we might have to do it all again tomorrow."
A piece of paper falling to the floor. It's always some small, stupid noise that wakes him, Sherlock thinks sullenly, and once he's awake there's no going back. Especially now.
All-but-perfect clarity, the night John had tenderly taken him apart: Sherlock had offered John everything, heart and body, mind and sanity, soul if there was such a thing, and John had accepted, wrapping everything they were together within a strap of leather — and they'd both started at the flare of
Mycroft's sigh is an eloquent study in irritation and disbelief. Clearly, John has gone off-script, derailed Mycroft's plans for the conversation, and he has a fierce, bitter joy at having done so.
starting to drain away, leaving Sherlock slumped over the back of the chair, spine and shoulders curved beneath streaks of reddened skin; the pose defuses John's frustration, leaving behind a complicated urge to slide hands up Sherlock's biceps, curl reassuring arms around him, coax him to eat something but —
"Sherlock Holmes — you took that cabbie's dare and risked your life to feel alive, and you won't take mine to keep it interesting?" His eyes widened at my words, his nostrils flaring. "I challenge you to a relationship."
"He hangs about when he wants and fucks off when he doesn't." John takes another forkful of his own dinner. "I don't even know if he's a decent mouser so, yeah. Not my cat."
"I know, John." He hears Sherlock settling heavily onto one of his kitchen chairs. "You can't imagine how often I wished that I could have brought you with me."
He feels warm hands on his shoulders, the brush of a thumb at his nape (like the remembered touch across his shoulder blade, across the damaged skin on his inner elbow) but it's gone again before he can react. (To nothing, to nothingness.) Then fingers apply a daub of cream at the intersection between two welts; a faint hesitation but otherwise impersonal, clinical.
"You drink that. I'm going to get some boxes and things to help us organise all this." Sherlock lifts his head and blinks at him; the slow rise and fall of his lids at odds with the swift scan covering John top to toe and back again. His shoulders slump a bit, though John isn't certain whether he should read it as relief or weariness. Or a winning — or losing — move in the battle against the merciless cravings for intravenous cocaine, for that matter.
Sherlock holds John's head, lifts his other forefinger to touch the centre of John's lip. Wills him, with gesture and gaze, to leave words and argument in abeyance for now.
Sherlock's lips tightened, and she could see that whatever reserves had lifted him from begging for soup to firing a gun were almost gone — but the crisis wasn't over yet, and she needed to push them through to the end of this. Mary moved past John to stand next to Sherlock's chair, where John could see them both, and reached down to take his spoonless, and apparently nerveless, hand. She twined their fingers together, so their palms were pressed together.
. Sherlock shakes his head, eyes fixed on a point beyond John's right sleeve (Fusiliers sweatshirt, a form of armour; frayed at the neck). Rewind, retreat.
Mary watched the muscle in John's jaw working, forcibly sealing off that untapped well of fury again under the needs of the moment. He looked between them again, fist clenched until it twitched in a little 'go ahead' gesture she wasn't sure he was aware he made.
Both hands in bronze-fine hair, Sherlock holds John's gaze, shifts their weight until their feet step in tandem toward the bed until calf touches bedframe and John's ready (situational awareness, lower centre of gravity) to be eased down onto the sheets.
"Wanting..." he said, shaking his head as I pivoted to face him. "We shouldn't change. The things we want aren't always the the things we need. We can't let the desires of the moment distract us from everything that works..."
something — a flare of gold-tinged red near Sherlock's hand, brighter, clearer than Molly's, cleaner than Jim's — realises he's drawn two steps closer to Sherlock and folded his hands behind his own back. Protective. On alert.
Elongated seconds stretching around him, John waiting with red-edged eyes and familiar patience for the whirlwind of thoughts behind Sherlock's flickering gaze to settle.
His lustrous eyes were locked on John's, scanning deeply but not so hard to read after all: searching, hoping, fearing.
John rises slowly (trainers off, knees creaking) and sets the book down. Sherlock tries to rein in his ragged breathing. He's strung tight as a piano wire anticipating the fall of the hammer, eyes darting around a room gone foreign: his carefully constructed mess disrupted, disordered, shaken to bits. The fiery pain across his back and arse attaches itself to John, bits of the day (cocaine, confrontation, command) falling into place in his memory but leading up to a black abyss.
"Tea, then." I walked to the kitchen, made a conscious effort not to clatter the kettle against the tap. Knew Sherlock couldn't help cataloging and identifying every frustrated rustle I made: leaning against the counter, adjusting my flies. A fleeting memory of The Woman —
"Not on call," John objected, muttering against her chest. Mary shifted, reaching over him to flip the phone's screen toward her, and paused.
Two more blinks, and his head settled slowly against the back of the chair, soup forgotten on the side table.
"Oh, Sherlock," she said through a sob. John had mentioned his carelessness with firearms but she'd thought he was exaggerating. "Don't do that."
It's only when he walks past yet another ringing phone, eyes on the road for a taxi, that it occurs to him he saw no glare of red near Sherlock's hands. A moment of dull curiosity — but he pushes it aside in the face of knowing the Entanglement was probably there, just faint, and he hadn't seen it because he
"I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start. The game's afoot: follow your spirit, and upon this charge, cry — "
"You're not news anymore; I suspect, much as this will dent your ego, you're largely forgotten except by those you helped. And every one of
She swallowed, tightly, and spread her hands like a captive in a film. Looking up at Sherlock, letting her unspoken plea show in her eyes, trying to let him see he didn't need to unmask her to have John back in his life.
The night before the first exam, Sherlock came to John's common room, where they revised everything needed for the test. Because there were other Hufflepuffs, they only occupied one couch. Sherlock had not slept the night before and John had gotten up very early that day so it was no surprise to anyone that the two fell asleep right then and there. Sherlock was functioning as a pillow for John, who was snoring lightly. The other Hufflepuffs were used to having Sherlock around by now and didn't mind seeing them nap together.
this is the last chapter. ive finished this fic. might go around tweaking the previous chapters a little because let's be honest I'm not that good at writing hahah
The days went by and Christmas was fast approaching. They didn't talk about the Yule Ball. John never mentioned it and Sherlock didn't bring it up either. John didn't even remark on the other boy's dancing skills when they found a distraught-looking Molly on the school grounds, hopelessly trying to practice dancing and in dire need of a partner so of course Sherlock swooped in and saved her day by explaining the steps to her again and waltzing across the snow with her. This ignorance held up. And so, John prepared for the Yule Ball alone, not having heard a word from Sherlock all day. He figured Sherlock would probably be spending time with his girlfriend before the big ball and tried not to think of it anymore.
The Christmas Dinner was fine too. Sherlock was used to eating now. John's influence really changed him. So Sherlock actually finished a plate full of food. His mother was surprised but wisely decided not to comment. His father entertained him with some musings on the botanic experiment in Sherlocks room, he had watched over it for a bit as it was highly dangerous and possibly lethal. Sherlock was glad to hear about the experiments changes in detail and his father was happy to talk about plants as he was a hobby gardener.
They entered a gay bar, probably one Victor and Sherlock used to go to (the thought of which made John bite his tongue) and sat down at the bar. Victor ordered himself a drink and John followed his example. Sherlock didn't, turning his attention towards the dancefloor instead. John took a sip from his drink when a new song began. And in what seemed like the blink of an eye, Sherlock next to him was gone. John wondered if his drink was that strong but Victor nudged him and pointed towards the dancefloor.
The meeting at 4 turned out to be a dance lesson. Professor Sprout informed them all about the Yule Ball. Then she picked a partner to demonstrate a few moves with and soon enough the entire room was filled with people looking for a partner. Sherlock naturally turned to him but John, trying not to panic, simply turned to Molly on his other side. So Sherlock shrugged and turned to his other side, which was Cedric Diggory.
"You never told me you liked dancing", John stated. "It never came up." "I suppose you're right. But you really seem to like it." "Yeah, I do." Sherlock's tone was unreadable. "Just a bit surprised, that's all." "I must keep you on your toes in some ways. To keep things exciting", Sherlock told John, smiling at him. The streetlights were flickering in his eyes. And the crinkles around his mouth made John all fuzzy inside. After John almost let out a wistful sigh, he turned his attention back towards the street and they walked in comfortable silence. While crossing a road, Sherlock bumped into John sideways, the backs of their hands swiftly connecting. Sherlock wasn't wearing his gloves. The touch of his skin seemed to stay on John's hand, like a phantom touch.
Sherlock Holmes was shivering. Irene was huddled right beside him in an effort to share body heat as Sherlock was not allowed to light a fire in a flying vehicle with mostly wood as the material. Irene was cursing the situation out, it was 'cold as balls', according to her. Sherlock himself did not really swear at all but could agree with his cousin's statement. But thankfully, they were apparently approaching Hogwarts, since the teeth clappering of their classmates lessened and the joyous "Nous arrivons, finalement!" increased.
The Beauxbatons boy was impressed by the library, calling it "gigantic" and "wonderful". While they wandered around, Sherlock found a book on untreatable poisons and John found out that Mary Morstan, his ex-girlfriend and fairly good friend, was now apparently dating somebody, as Madam Pince shooed her and someone else out of the library, exclaiming: "No kissing in the library! If you dont want to study or read, you can leave!"
the next chapter will include their first case (asip ofc) and perhaps the tournaments first task. we'll see. oh and please don't be too mad at me for the whole irene/sherlock misunderstanding. I just thought it would be wayy to funny. oh and I will include more Irene/Cho, especially flirting-wise
