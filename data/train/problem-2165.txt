He didn’t get to reach it, for the fell to the ground. He looked down and saw blood dripping from his chest. He had been shot.
Which was confirmed by the sleepiness he felt on the cab. He leaned his head against the window and tried best as he could not to close his eyes. Then he realized that John hadn’t said a word since they had gotten in.
He found the first match almost immediately. Daniel Howard, stabbed forcefully three months before Sherlock’s return. He’d been found at his working place, a mental hospital. Case unsolved. Suspected that he’d been killed by one of his patients but it could never be proved.
He didn't move from where he was, involved in his thoughts. He didn't know for how long he stood there, but it must have been a long time, because finally the greaser lifted his head and looked at John and John missed him so badly. "Do you need anything, Watson?"
"John!" She said and he stopped halfway through the door and turned to look at her. "I'm sorry about all of this."
So he decided to give John space, and wait until John felt ready to talk to him. He didn't pressure him, no phone calls, no messages, nothing but a promise sealed by a nod and a smile of relief.
John shook his head and looked down, trying to swallow the knot on his throat, because this was too much. "Nothing. I'm fine."
"Because...it fits you!" Greg said smiling compliantly and Sherlock thought about how stupid that nickname must have sounded, and he smiled weakly, but it was a real smile, of all his...friends, Greg was the only one Sherlock felt slightly comfortable with, so he moved towards the table and sat right next to Greg. "Where have you been, greaser boy?"
“Well, last thing I knew you were head over heels with Irene huh?”Greg said playfully, not removing that annoying smirk of his face and Sherlock thought if he kept talking he might actually punch him.
He couldn't reply. John was shifting from one feet to the other, uncomfortably. "Take a seat." Sherlock said trying to sound as cold as John. Two people could play the game.
Sherlock couldn't articulate a word, he was... Confused? He wasn't even sure if he was confused. He was... Distracted. Definitely distracted.
She went upstairs and opened the door of John's bedroom, the bed was made, the bedroom already tidy and clean. "Great sweetheart, now finish getting ready and go to the dining room, I just baked you some pie, I'll call Harriet!"
Sherlock wrapped his hand over his cock and stroked, and he felt a wave of sensations falling over him.
“Yes, drugs. The only reason why you could possibly have one pupil seven times bigger than the other.”
"Oh come on! It'll be fun!" Greg replied excitedly. "I don't get why you're so grumpy about it, John's going."
John kept his hands too far away, avoiding touch. Probably for the better, since they were full of the tomatoes he'd been squeezing.
He heard a voice behind him, it was Hikes, Hikes was right there behind him, Hikes was asking him something, he knew he had to run away, but his feet didn't move, he knew he had to turn to face the man and reply, but his body couldn't stop shivering enough for him to do so.
"Smoking is forbidden within this area. Absolutely forbidden. Do that again and you will be punished. Understood?"
Sherlock hmed. “Yes, I knew that much”, he said, sounding slightly exasperated and John loved that Sherlock wouldn’t sugarcoat him, wouldn’t treat him any differently, wouldn’t change his whole demeanor after seeing John at his most vulnerable.
it wasn't going to happen again, and Sherlock had Irene (though John suspected he didn't love her) and they just... It couldn't happen ever.
John smiled. He couldn't deny he felt a bit disappointed. He missed those times in which his help was required by Scotland Yard, not only he felt useful once again but he found that kind of adrenaline he had only been able to find on the war field in Afghanistan.
"There are a lot of things I don't tell you, for example, your diet is not working, and neither exercising, you have to cut it with the cakes".
Lestrade's mouth opened in surprise. Suddenly it all made sense. "And-", he didn't want to ask, but he had to, "and John-"
John frowned, looking confused, but said nothing about it whatsoever. He stood up and grimaced a bit, bringing his hand to his right leg, before stumbling and falling on the couch again.
There was a heavy silence hanging around them, crushing them down, building blocks and walls of unspoken things between them.
John smiled. "Good. Yeah. Lots of work at the hospital, but in general it was a good week." John said, avoiding the night he got so drunk he couldn't even remember it and the crazy encounter he had earlier.
the time, and he hated that. He hated not being able to take him out of his brain, and at the same time he didn't
Sherlock scoffed. "Don't be idiot Watson, if it's not loud, it's not worth it." He said turning the volume up and John felt uncomfortable, since he couldn't be so focused when the music was so loud, and
He looked over the books and smiled, passing one of them to his friend, standing in front of him. "Mike! Hello! How were your vacations?"
John looked down and smiled a bit. "I couldn't find my socks, so I went into one of the nurse's rooms", he looked up to Sherlock, and his eyes gleamed while he tried to stifle a laugh. "And there was a couple of nurses going at it, so I slipped into the room and took them and they didn't even notice."
He didn’t know, but it was true. Somehow the anguish from the painting didn’t only mean one thing, but it represented a thousand different things for Sherlock, it represented the pressing need to reach perfection, the pain of never being able to do it, the reminder that perfection was not possible to achieve, and somewhere, in a small, dark place of his mind, it represented whatever John Watson meant.
John's body was trembling, their kisses were more and more erratic, both of them were so near to the edge.
“You see, it is. I need to be certain that you’re back on track once again, and that you won’t relapse. I need to be certain that I won’t have to find you lying unconscious on the carpet once again, Sherlock.”
Sherlock needed John close. Now more than ever. It wasn’t just a simple caprice (well, it partly was, because he very much enjoyed John’s company), it was a matter of life or death.
John’s body was pressed against his. John gasped into their touch. He caressed the back of Sherlock’s neck. So softly, so thoroughly, as if they had all the time in the world.
"I know what happened yesterday!" He said in a louder tone than he intended to. "I just... Look, I want to be a doctor, Sherlock. I want to do this, and I know it's not going to be easy, but I want to try, because I'm going to see bodies for the rest of my life."
them. Do it carefully. Look at the shape. Eyes have different shapes, some are rounded, some look like almonds, others are in diagonal, angled towards the nose. Look at your own shape.”
Of course John's father wouldn't like Sherlock, but Sherlock wasn't looking for approval anyway. He seriously didn't care. The problem was John did and throughout the whole dinner he kept smiling shyly at the greaser, like asking him
"You tell me what happened last night that had you so excited that you greeted me with a hug and decided to take a trip with me! That's not usual from you, John."
John took a deep breath, knowing he was walking on thin ice. He didn't want to go through all of that, not again. His anger came back and he just replied coldly: "Why don't you ask Victor and leave me in peace?"
“He said he’d already told the gallery’s curator about my work, and that he wanted to see it, as if I had something to show him”, he laughed a humorless laugh, “as if I had a single shit to show him, he knows I haven’t painted anything in ages!”
“Well, it didn’t work for me, I’m a neoclassicist, John, I love reproducing cities like Athens, not cities like London.”
The other Greasers looked at John surprised, then they laughed a bit, and Sherlock looked at him puzzled. "I hear you."
Sherlock fell on his bed, feeling completely exhausted, bombarded by memories and constant questions about the nature of their relationship back then. He shut his eyes closed, wanting to make his brain go still.
And it seemed pointless and stupid and he knew it wouldn’t work, but he would give it a try once again.
John looked at the greaser surprised but he was right, they had to find her, something wasn't right, he felt bile rising up his throat, suddenly he was terrified, what if something happened to Harry?
." Jim's face was serious, skeptical and analytical, as if he felt something didn't quite fit, as if he knew something the others didn't. He didn't say another word. He just stood and finished his cigarette. They all stood in silence, sucking up.
Sherlock turned his phone off. Last thing he needed right now was to hear from his brother. He felt too exhausted to keep up with him. He couldn't help but feel that somehow Mycroft was
John opened his eyes immediately, surprised. "No. No, I have to go home." He said shaking his head and half-slept.
"Yeah, I don't know where they got that from. You know how those papers work, they take whatever story which creates sensation and print it without confirmation. I'm quite used to that."
He pulled himself together, ran a hand through his hair and fixed his glasses, which had moved from their usual place with John's burst of anger. "Now, I have to go. I have Chemistry Club. See you on Monday, right?"
participated. He didn't look up from his notebook, he barely took notes...his mind was definitely somewhere else.
before he reacted and returned the kiss with the same earnest, wrapping his arms around John’s waist. They kissed for a while until Sherlock broke apart and looked at John’s dark eyes.
He stood there, right behind him, biting his tongue to stop himself from doing any harsh comments -but he certainly was thinking them- until John finished and turned to look at him with a smile. “Tada!”, he said as soon as the drawing? -If he called it that- was finished.
John stared at Sherlock as if he had never seen his face before, like he had done at the coffee place almost three months ago, now with his jaw clenched and his breathing ragged. "Who. Are. You?", he repeated slowly.
Hikes called and shit, John got up angrily to receive it because he didn’t want to hear his freaking name right next to Sherlock’s anymore. He took the paper from Hikes, looked at the grade and felt a sudden relief, they did make a good pair when it came to this work. He let his eyes wander around Sherlock, just for a moment.
Sherlock took the 4H pencil from John’s hands, their fingers brushing slightly. John’s skin tingled.
Sherlock placed one of his warm hands in John's face, and John leaned in it. "It's your life, John. They can't just tell you what to do with it. It's
Sherlock felt a kind of levity he could only associate with the feeling of having actually died. He wondered for a second if that was possible, and of course it was, but perhaps not in this situation. If it was true, then it would be gruesome that his last word would have been a broken and helpless ‘yes?’. Then he realized that he hadn’t. It was the kind of levity that came when something that he had carried over his shoulders for ages, weighing him down, debilitating him and torturing him was taken off him. He had been released.
John looked up at Sherlock and they just stared at each other without saying another word. Sherlock wondered what John saw when he looked at him. Did he look just like anybody else? Did a tiny part of John's brain remember? Did John see all the things he wanted to say but he kept to himself? He shook the thought away, most probable option was that John saw nothing but a pathetic excuse of detective standing in front of him. That was the reason why he was looking at him questioningly. But he'd never found out, and he absolutely hated that.
He looked at Mike, with a serious expression in his face. "I have to do my final project with that Holmes boy!"
Someone cleared his throat behind him. Sherlock turned immediately, hoping sincerely John would be the one behind him and hating himself for it.
But he had never prepared himself to see John Watson again, standing right next to him. John Watson, with his ugly sweaters and his charming smiles, with his psychosomatic limp and the tremor in his hand. He never pictured him because he thought it would never happen again.
Sherlock blinked. He stood silent for a moment before replying, “but I understood it when I saw it, John. This painting says enough”.
John's mom turned to look at Sherlock and examined him up and down, up and down, then frowned. "How can I trust someone who sent my boy to detention?"
Sherlock sighed and shook his head. "No. He's tired and he needs to rest. I'll stay in the waiting room."
"Don't try to get clever with me, Sherlock, you know I have a lot of power. Now, I shall repeat the question just once more, and I demand your answer. Where is she?"
Sherlock looked at him, “bags under your eyes, so you haven’t slept properly. Your suit has seen better times, so you haven’t bought clothes in a long time, you returned three months ago, yet you haven’t even bothered to buy them. You care about your appearance yet you can’t bring yourself to bother about getting a new haircut. Does a haircut remind you of your military times? You seem to be struggling with trauma, then. Is that the reason why you haven’t painted?”
On Wednesday they were at John's house, Sherlock sitting on the bed, looking at John and John in his desk doing the biology paperwork. Sherlock laid on the bed with a sigh and said grumpily: "oh my god I'm bored!"
"I. Don't. Know. I. Didn't. Sleep. With. Him!!!" -the last word came as a shout and Harry's expression changed completely from utter joy to a sudden sadness mixed with anger, yes, she was definitely angry.
"Watson!" He heard a shout as the teacher entered to the classroom and closed the door. Then he looked around, everybody was sitting and he was the only one standing and he was facing Holmes, still feeling his face red with anger. He turned to look at the old man. "Take your seat now!" The teacher shouted seriously.
“Why are you looking at that old thing?”, John said, pointing at the painting and being unable to hide his disgust.
John was reminded that he actually had done it a lot of times. "Oh well, yes... But, you know, they weren't mean!"
Sherlock offered Irene to sit in the chair in front of his bed. He sat down across from her. "So, what did you need to talk about?"
“John?”, he asked, tentatively. John was staring at him with that terrifying smile he could pull out so well. Sherlock swallowed.
John kept the eye contact but didn't reply, he was too busy telling himself not to look at Sherlock's lips, but it was
Sherlock felt a second of fear and uncertainty invading him but it was all fine, he told himself, Mycroft was keeping an eye on him, John was unaware of all of this and he remembered the small, silly smile on his face that morning, "he's fine. Yes. He's good. Listen, Melissa, I'm actually here on a legitimate inquiry. This is Detective Inspector Lestrade and we need to have a word with you."
Their mouths opened. John placed a hand on the back of his neck, the other tangling in his curls and pulling slightly. And Sherlock
Sherlock felt John's lips against him. Relentless bruising healing repairing damaging. Sherlock gasped against them and kissed him with just the same earnest, with the same need.
"Oh, your eyes tell me otherwise." Sherlock whispered, still looking at him, still incredibly close. "You just don't
Yes, that silly quote that he would only attribute to romantics such as Van Gogh or John, and which sounded terribly stupid and out-of-character coming from him, actually applied perfectly to the situation.
And oh god, he would give everything to be allowed into the deepest corners of John's body and mind for the rest of his life.
Sherlock turned to look at him, unable to clear his face from pulling itself in a weird expression that denoted surprise, a pleasant, unexpected surprise. John looked at him with the same kind of wonder, none of them knowing exactly why the other was looking at them that way.
John tried to focus not on Sherlock's eyes nor voice but on the floor, so he decided to look down. "Hm. I just wanted to remind you that today we are meeting at lunch in order to plan the final project. We need to get the paper ready for next Monday so..."
There were crescendos and adagios and opus drawing themselves along Sherlock’s body, forming a symphony.
John rolled his eyes, “you can tell me everything that’s in your mind, you know? It’s physically exhausting watching you contain yourself.”
John looked pained for a moment, but then the smile was back on place. "I know, I know. That was exactly what I had planned. And I plan on keeping it, as a wink to the past, but also as a promise to the present."
“They never forced me to confess. Never made me say anything, probably didn’t even know who I was. They just did it because it was fun. It was their hobby. Waking me up with a bucket of ice cold water and hitting me repeatedly over the day without a chance to get food. My favorite moment of the day was late at night, because then I got to drink a glass of water.”
Sherlock didn't say anything, he just took his coat and his (new) scarf, which John recognized immediately. "Take me to the body". He went out the flat. "John, are you coming?"
It took him far much longer to find the ‘b’, but he managed to do so. After rummaging through files over and over he found Beth Hudson, stabbed forcefully on her working place, a bank, ten months before Sherlock’s return. Suspected motive was robbery, but the security footage had been strangely deleted. Case unsolved and archived. No evidence.
Oh okay, Tom was sitting with a girl, a girl who received him with a smile on her face when he saw him. "John!" Molly said excitedly. "Hadn't seen you in a while. Why haven't you gone to chemistry club?"
John looked away and rubbed the back of his neck, “ehm, well, this has been- wonderful, really, but it’s getting late and I’ve got to go”, he said, feeling incredibly awkward.
John finally looked down and cleared his throat. “Um- and have you painted anything interesting lately?”
As he tried to fall asleep, he realized this was probably the most incredible thing he had ever done in his life. Who would have thought he would end up escaping from his house at 2 a.m., take a greaser, a
He sighed and looked at the red carpet in the middle of the living room, remembering what had happened minutes? hours? ages? ago (times was always relative with John Watson) and felt the heat spreading all through his body. It had been painful and filled with rage and with sadness, but it had been John Watson, kissing him, crying with him, letting him into his world.
As soon as the guitar solo was finished, Sherlock leaned closer to John and whispered into his ear."Look at that!
"Look, just leave me in peace once and for all. That's all I need, to be as far away from you as possible!"
They smiled at her as she winked an eye to them. She really was a beautiful girl, wearing red lipstick, her hair curly and long, and in black from the shirt to her heels. She stopped just as she passed by them, turned back and walked towards the car.
John caressed the outskirts of the scar, touching incredibly softly, like only a skilled and careful doctor would do. The skin around was sensitive but it didn't hurt, for John knew how to apply the perfect amount of pressure. Sherlock closed his eyes and John stared fixedly at the wound.
And Sherlock certainly couldn't resist that, so he tried to be as polite and as charming as he could, but he hated it.
The man lifted his hand as if telling John to shut up. "I don't care. Go down, that woman is yelling at us." He said with a voice half- amused, half-annoyed.
He remembered the cab standing in the street across them, he remembered how he killed the driver to solve the case, well, it hadn't been to solve the case, it was because Sherlock was in danger, he killed him
Sherlock thought in his words for a moment. "Oh, that, yeah, well... I..., I was angry John, I didn't mean it, I'm... Sorry. Please, forgive me, I know it was something stupid to say."
Sherlock sat up in a rush. Everything was turning. His breathing was ragged. John was holding his arm.
"You were so intoxicated, so drunk, do you seriously not remember, how can you not remember, how can you not remember him? Doesn't it hurt you? Don't you feel guilty? Why do I seem to feel more guilt than you? I wasn't the one who did it! It was all your fault! You are a specialist in coming and ruining everything Harry! And very good job you did back then, you nearly killed him!" John nearly yelled moving his hands in the air. He didn't want to be so harsh on his sister, but he couldn't help it.
"We need her. Any suspicions she might have, any threats she might have received because of having been a client in here. I think she asked for our assistance because the name sounds oddly familiar", Lestrade said, interrupting her.
. Pathetic. But he was. Through his mind passed all the crimes he worked on with the police and he felt a pinch of nostalgia. He needed this again. He needed a case like the good old days.
“I met with Mike”, John said lowly as they laid in the couch. Sherlock’s head was on top of John’s, and somehow not having to look at his eyes made it all much easier.
John dragged a deep breath and turned his back to him once again, “take a seat, breakfast is almost ready”.
Sherlock sighed, but complied. The wound was covered, but John could tell it was starting to heal, for the skin around it was less red and swollen, and it didn't feel hard to the touch. Sherlock hissed however, as soon as John put his fingertips. John withdrew the hand immediately. "Morphine not strong enough?", he asked worryingly.
Unfortunately, Mycroft knew how to handle Sherlock in these situations. They had been in the same position many times before, and he didn't even flinch, no matter how much Sherlock begged.
John had barely gotten any sleep at all during the weekend. He tried to occupy his mind with anything that could come up, but nothing seemed to calm the pain which was growing from inside his body.
Sherlock finally reacted, he opened his eyes widely and looked at her in disbelief. "Wh...what... What are you doing here?"
John just looked at him as he kept thinking. After a moment of awkward silence, John held some disappointment in his eyes. "Text her back, you don't want her to think you're not overwhelmingly excited that she's back".
Charcoal and white canvas. And he was slowly going back to the stagnation he had suddenly recovered from.
Now, as his lips joined John's, Sherlock felt as if the could trace the shape of his lips, as if he could absorb the color and even mingle with every single cell of John's, as if he'd met John for a thousand small eternities.
He had a thousand ideas in his mind, flowing through his brain, flooding his mind palace. He discarded them all. They were a bit not good in different levels of variation. Somehow, Sherlock realized, no matter what he'd say or do, it could
, Sherlock secretly thought. Still, it didn't make the whole experience more bearable, nor it made Mycroft less annoying.
Sherlock smiled. It felt good. He knew he should have told John something, but right now he didn't care because there was a weird feeling spreading over his stomach that hideously felt a lot like 'butterflies' at the thought of having someone waiting for him at home. No, delete that, having
Sherlock closed his eyes. The sensations were invading him, numbing him, absorbing him. It was impossible to resist.
John looked down. “It means nothing to me, not anymore. I look at it and I see nothing, and I painted it. Now I look at it and I feel like it doesn’t deserve to be here, right next to all these wonderful paintings.”
It was a slow recovery and Sherlock would get frustrated and desperate. He'd be livid and short-tempered, and John put up with him every single time. Sherlock silently wondered when John would finally snap and leave, but he never did.
He exploded. "Stop drinking! Just stop it! Stop it now! I'm tired of this! You coming and getting me intro trouble and ruining everything! I've just had you in here for 24 hours and look at all the mess you've made! I knew this was a bad idea! I bloody knew it! I regret the moment I invited you in here for Christmas thinking you would change. I was so wrong. You never change. You will always be an alcoholic, a lonely person, a lousy sister!." -He stopped when he realized of all the horrible things he just said to her. Her eyes were filled with tears, and she was fighting to hold them and not start crying. She couldn't.
no, Mrs. Hudson wasn't behind that) and after a couple of minutes of silence, he placed the plate in front of John. John looked at it and his features softened for a second. "I thought you had
John leaned in and kissed him again. Sherlock closed his eyes as he allowed himself to give in to the overwhelming sensation that was spreading through his body.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “It’s just exhaustion. I haven’t had a proper night of sleep in four days and haven’t eaten since Friday.”
"Sh-boom!" Greg yelled while Sherlock entered to the cafeteria only holding his book and trying to hide the little smile growing in his face. The greaser stopped immediately and turned to look at Greg confused.
He parked the car, he didn't turn on the radio on the whole ride back home. He got out and his mom received him on the door, arms crossed, she was holding a piece of paper in his hand, and she had tears on her face. John feared the worse. "Hi, mom." He approached her looking worried, "Are you okay?"
He laid out all the images related to the case once again. He was certain he must have missed something at some point. It was difficult, when John was related to it in any kind there was no way his feelings wouldn’t get in the way and end up blinding his rational side.
Anyway, if Sherlock didn’t want him in his life then that was fine by him, he wouldn’t go and beg, he wouldn’t bounce around him like a puppy, he was John Watson, he had a goddamned picture on the Tate Modern, and if no one wanted to teach him how to paint a body then he’d teach himself.
Sherlock stared at him. What was he doing here? They hadn’t seen each other since the night he left, he hadn’t come to the classes, hadn’t attempted any form of contact with him, hadn’t shown any interest whatsoever, so why coming to Baker Street at that time? He was surprised, but mostly worried, what if-
John looked at it for a moment, hesitantly. He took it and grabbed it forcefully, in order to stand up. Once he was up, his hand unclasped from Sherlock's grip and he moved, limping a bit towards the door.
Sherlock looked down. Of course Greg knew, and he didn't have a problem with that, as long as he didn't open his mouth, but he trusted Greg enough. He probably wouldn't. He sighed. "He's not in the picture anymore."
Sherlock turned and took a frankly outstanding amount of magazines out of his bag, putting them on John's desk.
The takeaway arrived some minutes later and Sherlock used the time while John went to receive it to hide the folder and Isabella’s too, better not let John know anything about it. He would tell him later, he knew he had to, he had promised himself not to keep John in the dark anymore and he was going to do it, but he couldn’t do it now.
“I- I’m sorry Mr. Holmes, I was convinced it would be him! I told you so! The way Alice talked about him, he didn’t seem like a nice person-”
John looked unconvinced. He clearly hadn’t considered it, but it sounded somehow unlikely. “What do you mean?”
John snorted. "So your friends don't see you, right?" He smiled sarcastically. "You don't change, do you?"
But this resembled nothing to the actual feeling of their hands joined together, touching softly, feeling incredibly natural with one another, as if they were meant to
Sherlock moaned something, perhaps John's name. It was all he could say. It was the only word that said it all.
One day he realized he had no clue what to make a painting of, there was not a single idea in his mind, the colors had lost their vibrancy and the existence felt somehow heavier, as some kind of burden.
John drank the tea as if it had been the first cuppa he’d ever had in his life. He focused his full attention on it, on the taste and the steam and the smell and the color,
"Don't lie to me, Sherlock. Molly said she had heard you speak those letters. What do they mean? Who told you that? Are you trying to help a killer? Damn it Sherlock! Tell me!"
John finally opened his eyes properly and looked at Harry, now looking surprisingly awake, with a smile drawing in his face. "No Harry, I know exactly where I'm going." He stood up. Fell on the chair. Then stood up again.
Sherlock felt the soft touch of John’s lips against his neck as he muttered the words. It was enough to wake him up, to order his arms to actually
John blinked, not expecting that from his sister. "It's fine. I mean, I'm just... I'm worried about you Harry."
John simply nodded. Sherlock dragged his hand down, until it slowly fell over John’s cock. John closed his eyes as Sherlock’s fist closed over him, feeling overcome by the whole situation.
John didn't hear another word. He kissed Sherlock desperately, it was raw and messy and god it was perfect and brilliant and fantastic and Sherlock felt like he was about to collapse, but John's lips were there, holding him and tearing him and pulling him together and it was perfect.
He stared at her. He still couldn't deduce a single thing from her. Why? He didn't have the slightest idea. He could see nothing.
The doctor cheered up a bit. "Yes, it was the one of the...the British ambassador. His children had gone missing. You found them and asked me to check on them and the levels of mercury they had ingested."
"Sherlock, it's two in the morning! We're not staying here in front of your house!" John protested but Sherlock just turned the volume of the music up.
Sherlock kept palming him, marvelling at the idea of what was happening between them. Then he tucked his hand into John's pants and John couldn't help but moan.
“See what?”, Sherlock said with a shrug. “I saw it all, all the…houses and the mountains…impressive”, he said sarcastically.
He sighed as he took out his biology book. Not even his favorite class made him feel any different, any better, and he was sad, no, not really sad. He was angry, no, not really angry. He couldn't figure out what it really was, until he realized: he was just disappointed. And no, not at Sherlock. At him. For allowing Sherlock, the bloody idiot, to enter to his life, to change him, to make him happier. No, not happy. Different. Irreparably different.
Melissa is approximately five feet away from John. The gun she’s using- a mental picture of a lot of guns appeared in his mind palace- seemed to be a Special .38. Quite a popular model for self-defense. Also used by killers who had decided to act on the spur of the moment.
He looked around desperately. It was an abandoned place. There was blue everywhere, a distant memory triggering his headache but he ignored it. There was sweat falling off his forehead but he didn't care. He passed a hand through it and
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the simplicity of the whole case and sighed. Scotland Yard had really gotten sloppier. It seemed impossible but, well, it was true.
no matter what, that he'd never do any of that again, that he would be sorry for the rest of his life but will never regret what happened between them.
Harry stood up and walked directly towards her. "I don't think we've met, Harry Watson". She shook her hand. John got up immediately and walked to Harry to cut her off. "Harry don't you even dare! She is dangerous."
when John finally allowed himself to express his rage, his sorrow and his pain, and to let Sherlock be a part of it. It had been terribly painful, holding him as he felt John’s tears on his shirt, and he wondered how it was possible that such an incredible man could carry so much sadness within him, and it hurt knowing that he’d never be able to heal him and to help him and to love him properly, because he’d always end up hurting him. Still, that moment healed them both. In many ways. Not completely, not totally, but it was a start.
I will be perfectly honest with you: from now on, it's all up to BBC Sherlock. I don't know if I'll be able to keep writing between episodes because I don't know in which state those episodes will leave me, so it all depends on the show: it might totally inspire every single neuron in my brain or it might leave me heartbroken and hopeless. The point I'm trying to make is: I might take a little break from updates while Sherlock airs, or I might not, but worry not, this little one will continue updating in 2017. <3
He brought his hands to his ears, wishing to block the sound away. This was too painful, this was even more painful than what he felt like before taking the pills. An irrational fear took hold of him. He realized he wasn't shivering because he was cold, he wasn't that cold anymore, he was
That night, as soon as they finished eating, John put the plate away, leaned against the couch and started talking. "The first place I was sent to was Kabul", he started.
Sherlock looked up to find a tall, skinny, girl, with her green eyes fixed on him. "Obviously." He said expressionless.
It was- it was- it was surprisingly good. John looked at Sherlock with a frown, waiting for a response because he felt like they had been an improvement but he couldn’t be sure until Sherlock told him so, and so he looked at Sherlock fixedly, as the artist stared and stared and stared at the drawing.
"Oh Sherlock, don't look at it like that. Think of it as a new chance of starting over, of leaving all those problems behind and getting new friends!"
John smiled. "Come on", he said as he broke them apart. Sherlock sighed as John did so, but took the opportunity to study John's face, which was tinted with an adorable blush of pink.
"I've got to go, Mike." John said standing up and putting his tray aside. He had eaten his lunch incredibly fast, and he was full, but he didn't like being late, even though he didn't even know where he was meeting Sherlock.
John rubbed his leg but nodded. "Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, it's just... My bloody leg." He said a bit angrily.
Sherlock looked at John and tilted his head to the side. "Please, John. I only have good grades in history and it's because I'm pairing with you. I dislike studying, I hate receiving orders and I hate the fact those idiots believe themselves superiors just because they're older and they think they can just come and impose things on us. I don't work that way and you know it. "
"John..." Sherlock said looking at him seriously. Then he reached his finger to John's face and cleaned a tear that was still shining down his cheek. John retreated, knowing this was dangerous.
Sherlock smiled. He wasn't looking at John anymore, but at the typewriter. "She doesn't believe you, and to be completely honest with you-" he turned to face John "I don't either."
He looked at Billy the skull and leaned towards it. "Hello, old friend." He passed his finger over Billy's scalp and saw his finger had traced a line over it. Mrs Hudson hadn't cleaned since he was gone, then. Dust was eloquent indeed, he thought feeling in awe at Mrs H.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something and then closed it. Then opened it again and looked down. "I'm sorry."
"I sincerely hope..." Mr Hikes cut him off completely. "...you don't feel the need of doing it this afternoon, in detention."
What if they were Melissa’s version of Moriarty’s bombings? What if all of this had been designed to attract him, to drive him -them- into her trap.
Sherlock moved his hand and rested it on John's cheek and he felt the warmth and comfort of the greaser and all he could do was close his eyes. "John, you are much more interesting than you give yourself credit for. Believe me, to me everything is dull, boring and predictable, but you,
"He was taking some air, downstairs. Outside of the hospital", Sherlock replied tilting his chin up and trying to look secure and convincing.
She leaned closer to him and whispered in his ear. "I'll just give you some privacy, talk to him!" He looked at her confused, she gave her a wink. Of course she wasn't going to sleep, she was leaving them alone. She was the best sister in the world.
"Wow. I didn't think Sherlock was the kind of person who... You know... Dates people. Sorry. Hey! But cheer up! It's about to get exciting."
Greg cleared his throat and hesitated for a moment before replying. "Baker Street. 221B Baker Street."
"As I was saying, I considered the idea that- if you would call that an idea, it's more like an addition, you know, like complementing the idea per se and-"
John's mother turned to look at him and frowned, looking confused. John nodded. "Believe it or not, it's true."
But there was the other side. The one which replied not to do it, the one who brought the image of Victor's longing stare, the bag of pills, the accident, his sister... And John realized he couldn't just forgive him.
"She is the only one who stands me." Sherlock said simply, as if that sentence didn't say a lot about him.
He entered the classroom with a sigh. He felt exhausted, every inch of his body claiming for sleep, for relief. He fixed his eyes on his notebook, avoiding everyone and everything, not wanting to face a particular someone…
"But, teacher! Holmes is..." He turned again to look at his desk, but Sherlock's feet were no longer there, so there was nothing to be said. The greaser smiled at John's reaction.
There isn't a single day in my life when I don't regret doing what I did. Sherlock's blamed himself over and over for it, but in the end it was my choice, and I know I didn't know, I know I should have known that he was alive, and I suppose I lost the hope I had placed in him and in the end, even I failed him.
He opened his eyes an exhaled a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He focused on Sherlock’s smile once more. He felt a deep pain growing and getting heavier, and heavier. He stood expressionless and turned to look at Hawthorne seriously. “I’m ready.”
"From her! I know she was here Sherlock. You should have been more careful, you know I find out about everything. What was she doing here?"
John heard the steps as Sherlock came closer to him, but he didn't turn, he didn't react, he felt secure standing right next to the window. "Don't call me Holmes. You know I'm Sherlock for you. And please, let me explain."
"You still have the limp", Sherlock replied and as soon as he said it, he regretted it. John's face transformed into a snarl.
Sherlock grabbed him by the arm and John stopped, turning to look at him, their eyes met. Sherlock swallowed, all his thoughts suddenly vanished at the sight of John taking care of him in Baker Street. He cleared his throat. “John, thank you.”
"I'm sorry", John said looking around to see where he had hurt Sherlock, and he caught sight of him moving his arm rapidly to hide it from John's view. John, however caught his arm before Sherlock managed to hide it and frowned. "Hey", he said softly, "what happened?"
It was never about Irene. Sherlock couldn’t understand how people could ever assume that. It was about
He started roaming desperately through the living room, the library, feeling his patience wearing thin and his own anxiety and nervousness kicking in. He gave a helpless yell and threw one of the books to the other side of the room.
"No, I'll tell him!" Tom said, sitting up straight. "So... Sarah is throwing a party and she wants us there."
The detention passed by. Irene and Sherlock talked eventually while they shook the erasers (and ruined their outfits too), when Mr Hikes came by. "You can go now, but you are warned. Both of you! Next time I catch you transgressing the rules of the school, you will certainly have worse consequences. Clear?"
Sherlock flushed, which was a first. And John chuckled. "Stop flirting with me! We're in a crime scene!" He said turning his back to John and walking towards the stairs.
Perhaps John hadn't gotten to see him. Perhaps he had been too busy attending other patients, other people who
"But it's obvious! What the hell John, seriously? I told you to stay away from that boy as much as possible!"
John breathed loudly. Sherlock couldn't tell if it was relief or disappointment. "I did everything. All you need to do is pass it to the typewriter..."
Sherlock felt something akin to that. There was an emptiness to it, for all the memories scattered, flying around, turned into ashes, remembered only by those who read the blog, but not remembered by the man who wrote them all, and in that there was a sense of nostalgia, a deep feeling settling in his stomach, a painful reminder that expectations never matched reality.
Slowly, he took Sherlock’s hand and dragged it towards his trousers. Sherlock licked his lips eagerly.
"Oh..." John's mom said as soon as she heard the name and turned to look at John, who threw her a shy smile. "My son has told me a lot about you." She said trying (unsuccessfully) to hide her displeasure.
Sherlock was beautiful, with the sun highlighting his hair and the reflection of his dark blue dressing gown imprinted in the window. He recorded that image in his mind and promised himself to reproduce it in a canvas, for this was the complete opposite of
Of course. What else could he expect? John tried, he really tried not to sound as sad as his voice ended up sounding. He sighed. "...no. I haven't."
The thought came straight to his mind, he was going to sleep with Sherlock, in the same room, the same place together. He needn't anything else, he was happy just by staying at the same place as Sherlock, watching him fall asleep, yes, that was all he wanted. For now.
One more chapter and an epilogue to go. Thank you so, so much for reading, I hope you enjoy these final chapters! <3
"After a surgery, it's common the anaesthetics generate lacunas of memories. It happens quite often, it's called dissociative amnesia, and it might start by erasing irrelevant memories or people you have met before..."
"Going to therapy?" Sherlock looked at him, his green eyes fixed on his friend's. He looked surprised, he knew his fake death had obviously affected John, but he had no idea he had came back to therapy, he knew he used to take it before meeting him, but he never thought he would return, and less because of him. Sherlock felt so much guilt, he finally understood everything his friend went through during that time, and it was painful.
John served the breakfast as Sherlock sat and started talking about a new case, it was surprising how he was avoiding Moriarty's message. He didn't want to think about it, though he couldn't help but think about it all the time. This was the only moment since the day before that Sherlock had found some peace, it was nice talking to John again, they both looked so happy, they were the best of friends, as if nothing happened.
"So..." Sherlock asked, placing both hands below his chin, his face falling apart. He didn't feel capable of finishing that sentence.
Suddenly Irene chuckled lowly, but loud enough for anybody who was close to them to hear, and Sherlock saw John's back, as he passed them by and continued walking down the hall. He saw the tension drawing in John's shoulders.
what John had said was, but he cleared his throat and forced himself to carry on. “How very sentimental of you”, he said with a sigh and John laughed, “now materialize it. It is of no help to have an idea if it is situated on cloud nine. Put it to the ground, adorn it, pour water on it, read bedtime stories to it and wait to see it grow.”
Sherlock scoffed. "Of course not! I'll take you to your room and make sure you're comfortable and asleep."
John sighed, "I take back what I said about Elvis." He said, not daring to make eye contact with the greaser. He chose instead to look at his chest, at the white t-shirt under the leather jacket, at the collar bones and... "Is that a scar?" He said touching the mark which was barely perceivable, right next to his collar bones.
John’s smile widened. “Plus, I’ve got to go to my flat and change clothes or people will start talking.”
As soon as Mycroft entered to his office he called his assistant Anthea, he was starting to get worried, very very worried about Sherlock getting those messages, he remembered what she had done last time, almost leaving a hole in the wealth of England. Her comeback could only mean trouble for him and his job.
Sherlock turned towards his house, leaving behind a confused Mrs. Hudson, and stumbled in his bed wondering if John was still at the school, and if he really was okay. Or not. Maybe the crime scene couldn't wait after all.
When John replied, he was slightly out of breath, “I’ve seen them, what now?”, he didn’t pull away, Sherlock’s lips still on his earlobe.
"...Because yesterday, at the record store, you passed from being the wonderful smart, incredible boy I know to be the biggest douchebag greaser in the world!"
Sherlock sighed. Of course Mycroft wouldn't tell him, of course he wouldn't. He stood up, grabbed the paper and left without saying 'thank you' or 'goodbye'. He needed to get to that place as soon as possible.
himself not to rush to open the door, but by the time the bell rang again, he was already climbing down the stairs and hating himself for being so stupidly filled with hope.
But if there was something he'd learnt while he studied chemistry is that simple compounds can tear the world apart, or stitch it together.
Sherlock scoffed. “There’s no such things as coincidences. The universe is rarely so lazy. Melissa, please, I thought you were smarter than that”.
No matter how much he tried, John couldn’t manage to reproduce his own drawing of Sherlock’s hands. It just wasn’t the same anymore. It wasn’t the same when there weren’t
He went downstairs and as Mrs Hudson was listening to the radio in the kitchen, he opened the door and left. Apparently she didn't notice.
And he was convinced of it until he saw Sherlock that morning. The greaser was with his usual jacket and his white t-shirt, rubbing his hands and tapping his feet to the floor as he laid on Greg's car. John recognized that was exactly what Sherlock did when he was dying for a cigarette. He smiled as he realized how much he already knew about Sherlock, and how many things he had yet to discover.
He placed another kiss on Sherlock's mouth, this one not so filled with desperation nor need, this one was tender, slow, exploring.
“Hello, John. Do come in”, Sherlock said, opening the door wider. As soon as he did, John noticed that Sherlock looked different from their previous meetings. He used to wear his impeccable suit that somehow never ended up stained in charcoal or anything. He was always wearing his posh jacket with posh shirts underneath, but now he had taken his jacket off and had only the shirt with his sleeves rolled up. He looked different, younger somehow, more at ease.
And John thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen and grinned widely. Sherlock was about to reply when Mr Hikes entered to the classroom, looking defiantly at the greaser, who was standing in front of John's seat. He rolled his eyes and sighed, walking towards his seat.
Sherlock was about to get out of the dining room when Mycroft cleared his throat. He stopped and turned back rolling his eyes. "Thanks for dinner, Mrs Hudson." He said with a small smile. Then he turned to look at Mycroft. "Happy?"
The next time John opened his eyes it was to the sound of the cuppa being placed in the table in front of him. He stared at the steam coming out of it, looking at the shapes that formed and blended with the air.
"I...well...why are you helping me?" Sherlock said, not being able to find other words to formulate the question.
John felt a sudden fear reaching all over his body. He stood straight and cleared his throat. "What... What do you mean?"
"Shut up! Shut up and stay shut up! Because whatever he is, whoever he is, it can't be worse than you!"
"No, nothing to apologize. It's true. All of it. You will always be the greaser and I am just... John."
John had to admit the idea didn't sound that exciting without Sherlock, he wanted to go with him, even if that included trying to ignore his sister's jokes implying his love for the detective. He wanted to go with him. But his sister wanted to go, so he was going with her. He wanted to thank her for everything, whatever it was she had done to help him. "Fine, fine, get ready to go! We'll be leaving in an hour."
Sherlock felt overwhelmed by that. Which was a really stupid reaction, because John honestly didn’t say anything. “So are you”, he replied.
"Why did he hit you?" Sherlock said, changing the topic and turning so he could see John's face properly, who still didn't dare to look at him.
"Sure." Sherlock said and actually left with them and John was trying to process his thoughts, his pain (both physically and emotionally) and his anger, because right now, it was the strongest feeling. Not towards Jim, not towards Sebastian, not even towards Sherlock but towards him, for being so incredibly stupid.
He opened his eyes and saw the detective staring at him, still a little confused. He looked at him, he didn't dare to say anything. It was pointless, he was going to have dinner with Irene. Ugh, that woman. She had ruined so many things. Finally, after staring at each other in what John felt was an eternity, Sherlock stood up, put a hand in John's hair while he stood in shock, feeling the warmth of Sherlock's hand, he could stay like this forever. Then, he turned off the light, went to his room and closed the door.
Sarah nodded and he put his coat on, clenching the fist of his left hand. "I'll see you tomorrow." He said flatly.
Mycroft looked tired and worn out. Still, it wasn't enough to cut off the ice in his voice as he replied: "perhaps you should stop doing things that will end up with you in hospital, brother dear."
Next time he opened his eyes, he felt surprisingly comfortable. His breathing wasn't that irregular (perhaps due to the fact he had an oxygen mask on), and he wasn't moving anymore. He felt more relaxed. Better, alive.
He didn’t go back to Sherlock’s flat that night. He didn’t want to seem eager and there was always a moment at the start of relationships, or…whatever this was, when John felt terrified that using love too much at first would prove disastrous to the future, and god, he didn’t want to ruin this, whatever this was.
John kissed him eagerly and pressed his hips to Sherlock's thigh, Sherlock felt eager to return the favour. He roamed down and took hold of John's cock. John moaned into the kiss and shivered at the contact. He started stroking and striking and stroking, marvelling at the sensation of John's skin under his fingertips. John kept kissing him, as if he was physically unable to leave Sherlock's lips. Sherlock felt John's growing orgasm and led him to it, and John was coming, coming and kissing him and kissing him and kissing him.
"Well, Dr. Watson..." Hawthorne said walking in. "We'll do a little map of your brain, we'll tape your statement and tonight we'll go to your apartment and erase Sherlock Holmes from your mind while you sleep. What do you think?"
to understand but I can never tell. I'm always wrong when it comes to you, but I'll take anything, Sherlock,
"...I used to deduce people and my mother didn't like that so she took me to a therapist. Psychiatrist, is the right term."
And that was because he didn't want to believe it was true, because it was both fascinating and terrifying, seductive and impossible. It couldn't be. Sherlock couldn't be in love with him. He couldn't be in love with Sherlock, it was not the way it was supposed to be. The greaser held his hand over John's cheek for a moment, then he let go and looked at him seriously. "You can't possibly believe that, John."
When they arrived to the car, Sherlock threw another glance at John, standing, about to open the door, but not quite. "Are you sure?"
Sherlock remembered that day John walked him through the Tate Modern and had taken him to that Van Gogh painting. As Sherlock stared at the paint-coated spirals, he had mixed feelings: on one hand, he wanted to feel aversion to such a low form of expression, on the other he was absolutely marveled by the texture the spirals exuded. Even though there was a very thick layer of glass between him and the painting, his fingers had the sensation that they were tracing the contour of those spirals, could absorb the color and could even bring him back to that single second in which Van Gogh had traced them with a brush.
Sherlock looked at him with soft eyes before taking the shirt and using it to cover John’s shoulders once again.
John smiled, because he knew this was the moment when the greaser spent time by himself and read books he liked and seemed genuinely happy. He never looked happy when with Jim and Sebastian and Greg. Not like that. Not like he looked when he was alone, not like he looked when he was with John.
John wished he could look like that, so relaxed, but instead he shook his head. "You really should stop listening to those silly love songs."
Sherlock threw Sebastian a killing look which seemed to have a huge impact on the boy, who immediately said "Sorry".
It always went downhill from there. This time they were running. Running and running and running. John could almost feel the thrill of the chase pumping through his veins, could almost hear Sherlock's voice encouraging him
John was making breakfast and Sherlock was reading the newspaper when Harry went downstairs, in her pjs and looking still a little sleepy. "Good morning Sherlock, good morning baby brother!"
"Yes I am. And I'm here to ask you what you know about the doctor John H. Watson!" He asked impatiently.
She smiled. "I know, people can be so intolerant, but don't worry, I don't mind..." She winked at them.
"Watson, I have to review an approximate of 90 essays, counting the six courses in which I give class. Letting you work by yourself means that I now have to review 91. It's more work for you and for me. The answer is a no. Absolutely not."
He opened his eyes. He was breathing fast. For a second he wondered if Sherlock had just jumped off a rooftop when he looked down at his hand and saw its desperate attempt to block the blood flow.
John straightened his back and brought his hand to his head, grimacing with pain. Sherlock leaned closer instinctively. "Are you okay?", he asked worriedly.
“Yes. He was quite an extraordinary person. Dr. Watson lived amazed with him. You can tell by his posts.”
Mycroft looked at him incredulously, which forced John to keep the eye contact. "Really, I just saw him very very drunk and brought him home. That's all."
There is an element of eternity into taking that step as well. And Sherlock felt ready, more than ready, to be honest. He had imagined this exact moment over and over in his head, pondering all the variables and the possibilities. And he thought that was all he would ever get, and then he came back. And John was slowly coming back to him. Perhaps not in the way he'd always wanted, but John was there nonetheless.
He closed his eyes fiercely. He felt his headache intensify, and his hand starting to tremble even more violently. John blamed it on the memory of the war. It had been a long time since he had thought about it, and there were so many scars unhealed that he avoided touching, avoided even approaching to, because John knew there would be sequels.
John nodded. He still felt somehow exposed and stripped down but he was amazed by Sherlock’s brilliance and madness and by the easiness in which he expressed it all without caring about following social standards and patterns. He just said what he thought and that was it. Perhaps people should be more like him.
I'M SO SORRY FOR TAKING SO LONG TO UPDATE!!!! I hope you enjoy this chapter, I promise you (I SWEAR) next chapter will be up soon. Thank you so much for following this story, your comments and kudos make me incredibly happy. <3
John woke up to find his nose buried in Sherlock's neck. He felt the skin that was so close to him and breathed in. He felt the greaser's arms tightening around him, somehow they had shifted in their sleep and now they were face to face. Well, face to neck because John couldn't reach Sherlock's head.
Sherlock smiled for a moment, as the memories passed by. He didn't clarify Irene that they had never actually had a
And it would be fine. Because for one moment, just for one moment, Sherlock had believed it. Sherlock had felt it. Sherlock had seen the light rushing through him, scintillating and sparkling and lighting.  All of that- What was that smell?
Perhaps John had changed his mind. Of course he would. Perhaps John realized of who Sherlock really was and decided that it wouldn’t be a great idea to learn from him. Perhaps John only saw all of this as a joke. Perhaps perhaps perhaps. Sherlock looked down at his clock impatiently. John had said he’d be there at 7, it was 7:02 already and John wasn’t coming. John was definitely not coming.
Suddenly surprised by John's determination, Sherlock nodded, without being aware of what he was nodding for, he wasn't really paying attention to what John was saying.
John was still talking with the professor, trying to convince him to change his mind, when Sherlock passed by John, ignoring him as he went to talk to the teacher. "Mr Hikes, I don't have a couple and I was wondering if I could do the work by myself."
"Nothing. Absolutely nothing." John said, half to Sherlock, half to himself, because that was all there was left.
John sat next to him. The sirens chimed louder and louder. One of his hands stayed pressed on the wound, the other reached desperately for Sherlock's hand.
"Oh yes! Blimey that was a weird sound, can't say I was a little turned on by that. It sounded... Good."
"Look, I'm sorry, but I did it for your own sake, Sherlock. I meant what I said, you need to focus on defeating Moriarty, and she was distracting you." Sherlock didn't say anything. He just frowned and went to his room, shutting the door closed noisily.
John sat next to him as Sherlock went back to his chair. His face now was a bit more serious, and he started typing, trying to hide the awkwardness he was feeling. John shoved him on the shoulder. "Don't be silly, Sherlock. You can be as weird as you want with me." He said with a smile.
Lestrade crossed his arms and leaned back in the chair in the most police-like position he could find. Melissa felt uncomfortable immediately, Sherlock could tell by her face. "No. It isn't. Look Mrs-"
Sherlock put Harry inside the backseat with some difficulty, John turned to look at her, worried. "WHAT HAPPENED?", he yelled.
Sherlock got defensive. "What's that supposed to mean? She is my girlfriend!" The words felt weird coming from Sherlock's mouth.
"Shhhhh! If my parents wake up they would probably kill you! They'll think you're a serial killer or something like that." "How cool would that be?" Sherlock said smiling.
Sherlock did all he could to disguise the disgust which drew on his face. "And why isn't he here?" Which was, of course, a relief.
"Don't give him false illusions. Don't play with him. Don't break his heart." She said talking as fast as she could.
“I’m coming!” John said rushing towards the door. The doorbell had been ringing for five minutes. He hadn’t heard it sound, he was too busy telling himself this was the right decision to make, and he knew it, but it was so hard. Every time he thought about the fact he was going to erase Sherlock Holmes off his memory forever he shuddered, and he just tossed the thought away.
Sherlock's posture went rigid. John couldn't tell which face the greaser was making, but this was surely making him uncomfortable. "I haven't done anything."
“You’d be too if you read the blog! I actually wrote Mr. Holmes once, by the time Mitchie got lost, remember? I claimed him if he could help me find my cat. He never replied though, I guess it makes sense, he had murders to take care of, but I had to give it a try, didn’t I?”
He knew Holmes was taking him to a hidden place where he would beat him. Sherlock walked a few steps ahead of him, in a fast pace without looking back. They arrived to a small corner in the back of the building and John was waiting for the punch, and as they stopped he closed his eyes. And waited. Nothing came.
“I dreamt of Afghanistan”, John said quietly, “I was used to them, but hadn’t had them in a long while and thought I was over them. I wasn’t prepared for seeing all of that again. I mean, I always saw it, but when it haunts me in my dreams, it gets dangerous, because there’s nowhere to run, nowhere to go to, the bullet burying itself in my shoulder time and time again, and I couldn’t stop it. When I woke up today”, he turned to look at his left hand, “it was trembling again, harder than ever.”
"Oh no no no! You're staying! Sherlock I need to solve this and you're just going to walk away and don't come back and I won't let that happen!"
His gaze turned towards the little table right next to John's bed and he slowly walked towards it, he opened the first drawer and found John's phone.
They went downstairs, Sherlock leading and John behind him, when Sherlock stopped immediately and John crashed with him. "Hey!" He said, fixing his glasses, but Sherlock wasn't answering. John couldn't see what was stopping him, the greaser blocked his view.
Sherlock stood up and looked at him. "Promise me you won't tell anyone." John nodded. Sherlock doubted for a second and started pacing down the living room. "Two years ago, Moriarty came in here and we had a talk. He said he wanted to solve our problem. Our final problem. He said that he owed me a fall. Finally, well, he managed to solve the problem, apparently, though it costed his life. Before the fall I used to find the 'I O U' message everywhere, John, everywhere, and it was driving me crazy. I don't know what kind of sick trick this is, but Moriarty can't be alive, he simply can't. He died. I saw him kill himself. It's just not possible."
“I’m not an idiot, Sherlock, contrary to what you believe. I knew you’d come back here on your own. I won’t allow it.”
Sherlock looked at him with a ‘what you just said is probably the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard’ face but John didn’t even realize he was making that face, for he was far too absorbed in his palette.
“That’s because I don’t settle for painting reality. But you do. That’s why you asked me to teach you, didn’t you?”
They leant closer and their noses touched, caressing one another before Sherlock pulled in and made their lips meet again.
John entered into Sherlock's room. He was so uncomfortable. This was weird. He didn't know what to say.
"Your elevated pulse seems to disagree with you." Sherlock said, still looking at the book. John looked down and realized Sherlock hadn't loosened the hold of his grip.
Sherlock remained speechless. Breathless. Air was so overrated. The world was turning, turning too hard, too fast, and John wanted him.
Sherlock flinched, looking around. “I don’t see any wonderful paintings in here”, he said with all honesty.
John swallowed. “Were- um. You and I. Erm. Were we- were we together before you-”, his face looked contorted with pain and it seemed as if he was doing his utmost to keep himself still and calm.
Sebastian was looking at him, ignoring the blood running from his nose and instead decided to shake him excitedly. "Fuck Jim, stand up!"
Right now he couldn't wish for anything else, he needed to block the pain. He needed to stop this stupid self-blaming. He had to block away all the ghosts of his past before he ended up even more screwed.
It all happened too fast: Irene opened the door with a bang, the rest of the group stared at her and the other greasers who were invading the house. They stood up, speechless and surprised. Irene looked to the other end of the living room, right next to the backyard, and so did Sherlock who had entered behind her. Sarah was smiling at John and touching his arm while he told a silly story that had happened to him when he was eight, and when John looked up, Sherlock,
He wondered for how long he'd been unconscious. It seemed like the wound was already starting to recover slowly, so he calculated about two days.
And all of the sudden the feelings came back rushing to him. He had numbed them momentarily, far too busy with trying to have everything perfect for his visit, he had managed to distract himself, but now, standing in front of John, of a John that he had hurt so many times and in so many ways, of a John that exhibited every single psychological scar on his face, and that showed nothing but the deep, searing hurt that Sherlock had caused him, he felt he would collapse, right then, right in front of John.
John dragged a deep breath. He could feel his hand trembling. “What's it about?”, he asked, his voice shaky.
After the fall, there were some expressions he never got to put a name to, those he also categorised, stored them carefully in his mind palace.
John sighed, that was not at all what he had meant to say. Not at all. “That’s not- that’s not what I mean”, he said softly.
Just as he was parking the car and turning it off, he heard a voice behind him. "Well, well, well, look who got home from school."
Melissa frowned too but opened her mouth to speak. “I know this will seem odd, but can I come with you?”, she said, turning to look at Lestrade. “I’d just like to help you with the records. Please?”
She leaned closer and whispered into his ear. "You are in charge of making him forget about his dinner with the crazy lady. Don't let him."
"It isn't fair. Any of this. You. Everything you've gone through. Us. It isn't fair", he said as his tone betrayed the rage he was feeling.
"John why did you do that? You could get in trouble! This is dangerous!" She said, turning to look at Sherlock and frowning, the greaser looked at her and threw her one of his bests fake smile.
"Well, that's a shame Watson, you should have thought about it before. I hope you reflect it while you do your punishment." John nodded.
John looked up and that horrible expression that Sherlock hated to see drew itself on his face. Sherlock hated it because he couldn't put a name on it. It looked like pain, but it also looked like resentment, and it was tinged with a shade of regret. He noticed from the corner of his eye that John's hand had clenched and unclenched. He ignored it. They stared at each other in silence for a long while, just like the old, brighter times.
And so he spent all of his days practicing, or writing, or reading, or visiting museums, things that reminded him of what life used to be before the heat and the death came to crowd him over. It was difficult, though. That was why he needed to get better and do it soon, he needed his tremor to disappear forever and he needed his inspiration to come back to him, otherwise he’d end up doing another stupid, impulsive, perhaps deadly thing.
“I am. And I agree”, John said, feigning a confidence he wasn’t quite feeling at the moment. He considered Sherlock’s eyes for a little while, and turned away. Sherlock slowly dragged his hand away.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter (it was about time, wasn't it?). See you around for the final chapter. Lots of love to you all :3
John nodded as Greg left. He cleared his throat. Sherlock couldn't help but keep his eyes fixed on him, standing there, in the flat. It all seemed too surreal.
And what the hell was John Watson doing in Baker Street after he had made it definitely, completely, 100% clear that he wanted nothing to do with Sherlock nor with anything related to him? He suddenly decided to appear to save him from overdosing? Just like that?
As he was approaching his house, John saw Harry walking by the street. As soon as his sister saw the car, she ran hurriedly towards it, forcing John to push the brakes as fast as possible.
Somewhere in the back of his mind he wondered since when he had started paying attention to the details of the human body.
"Here. Double shift.", Mycroft replied, looking disappointed at his little brother, perhaps for asking such questions after waking up from God knows how many hours/days of unconsciousness.
“Ella thought keeping a blog would help but it hasn't because nothing ever happens to me. But today, something did. Something happened.”
John stopped abruptly, trying to wrap his mind around the voice he had just heard. He turned to look at Sherlock, who was still not looking up! “Excuse me?”John said, somehow wishing Sherlock would lift his face from the notebook.
John's father shook it and studied Sherlock up and down. "Are you here because of Harriet?" He said coldly.
Sherlock shook his head too, and his breathing came fast and irregular. His heart was still beating faster, his hands were shaking uncontrollably. He felt dizzy, so so dizzy. An old rock n' roll song playing in the distance.
Sherlock’s mind raced. A thousand thoughts appeared there. Were they really not? Sherlock had just had the thought that him and John had never been just friends, and Sherlock left John and John went to get him erased from his mind, and there was no other way Sherlock could define the pain in his chest while John made that little speech in front of his grave rather than ‘the pain of loss’, a kind of pain that would accompany him, haunt him for the next eighteen months before coming back, seeing John again and finding out he had erased him from his mind, only to feel that pain of loss once again. A pain of loss he still felt.
As soon as the teacher passed to the next desk, John turned to look at Sherlock, who took the magazines out of the bag again and continued reading one of them. "Sherlock!"
"Does it have to do with John?", Lestrade asked, and Sherlock asked himself if that was obvious as well.
in your brain, whether an idea, an image or a concept, something is pushing you to do it, otherwise you’d feel no desire to paint at all. So tell me, what’s in your mind?”
“That’s Afghanistan”, John replied. “That’s what we turned it into. With every step we took, with every bullet we shot, we progressively took the color out of it, we killed its vibrancy, we left it colorless. We killed it.”
I'm sorry for the angst, I truly am. I don't enjoy it, I don't even know why I do it, I just sort of do. Plus, I watched the special so I'm definitely angstier than ever. If you want to understand better this crazy idea that popped into my head for the final problem, just read the notes at the end of the chapter! x
Hawthorne stood silent for a moment, then he replied seriously: "It's very rare, but there are some cases in which the patients experience other effects, such as insomnia and intense headache, but it almost never happens. Don't worry, lacunar amnesia is a very moderate form of amnesia and it won't cause much brain damage. Tomorrow you might awake with some headache, that's normal, although you won't remember why, but just take a pain killer and you'll be fine. Although you probably won't remember that."
John threw his head back and groaned. "Why do I have to go back to that hideous place? It's too boring!"
John sat straight on the chair, he thought for a second before replying, "what do you want us to be?"
“The hands are incredibly delicate, but so perfectly placed that they represent the movement, as if she was caressing the ermine. The articulations are perfectly drawn, and the shadows, John, the shadows”, he said moving his hands in the air. “-They are outstanding. I started drawing hands after I saw hers.”
She handed him the piece of paper. It was the first notes report of the year. He had gotten a D in Physics.
“Don’t fall asleep!”, John said after a while, grabbing Sherlock by the chin and turning his face towards him.
"It means... I don't count." -Harry answered, winking at Sherlock, who looked at her without understanding a thing.
Somehow throughout the night they had shifted and now Sherlock was the one holding John, his hand over John's stomach, John's hand covering his, as he breathed slowly, deeply asleep. They were in a position that could only be described as
"Don't say that, don't give up when you haven't even begun to fight. I need you to be okay, Sherlock, I wouldn't deal losing you again, and I won't let that happen, but I need you to fight, I need you to find him, and I need you to defeat him and I'm saying it because I believe it. I believe you will, and I definitely believe in you. So don't give up, don't stop. Not ever, not for him, not for nobody."
Sherlock's eyes widened, suddenly needing the stimulation a case would bring to his brain. He considered it for a moment, but he shook his head slightly, letting Greg know he wasn't joining him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and removed the oxygen mask off himself. "What are you doing here, Mycroft?"
Lestrade stood up and put on his scarf and his coat. Autumn was giving way to Winter faster than they expected to. "Come on."
Sherlock didn't want to look down and didn't want to look at John so he opted to look at the sky, at an unusually cloudless sky, with stars. The longer he looked at it, the more stars appeared. He remained silent and while he looked at the sky, his trembling faded.
"I didn't even know you knew my first name, so if you want to call me John, it's fine. It's all fine."
"Take this one". Sherlock told John, handling a doctor robe, which wasn't his and was also too big for him, but John obeyed and put it on. He felt a pinch of excitement and smiled widely. Sherlock looked at him up and down. "It certainly fits you, Doctor."
“Woah”, John said, as he stopped walking. Sherlock stopped a few steps ahead and turned to look at John with a confused expression, John was staring at the canal and smiling. “Can you imagine him there, being a genius and changing the world without the world even knowing?”, he asked quietly as Sherlock made his way towards him.
"Yes..." John said standing up and trying to push away the invading thought of Sherlock's eyes in his head. "...we should."
it had to be a mistake. "We have work to do. We better get on to it." He said as he moved to take the two erasers laying on the floor.
"Hey, don't say that John!" Mike said cheerfully, his tone trying to make John feel better but it wasn't working. "You still have plenty of time to figure everything out, you love medicine, you could be a doctor."
John blinked and turned to look at him as he mentally tried to save the image in his brain, with as many details as possible. “You were wondering what we were now.”
He felt Sherlock's hand on his cheek, a light touch, but enough to rise the temperature in the car. Then the greaser leaned in and gave John a quick kiss on the cheek. Then he murmured into his ear. "I
Sherlock took some napkins and bent to help John dry himself. "Let me help." He said as he crouched, cleaning John's leg.
Sherlock laid down once again, but started roaming for John's shirt buttons, and slowly started taking off one after the other after the other. "Sherlock", John said, out of breath, into his lips.
"Of course he was! He didn't take his eyes off you, thinking which boy or girl will you shag today! Oh, I don't know Sherlock enough, but it was so obvious!"
John's frown deepened. "Yeah, well. I have to go." He grabbed his cup with his left hand and almost immediately the tremor started and the cup shook so violently the coffee spilled everywhere, including John's body, burning him a bit. "Shit!" He murmured, looking down and placing the cup back on the counter, the woman had gotten lost inside the kitchen.
Once and for all. Stop creating illusions. For both you and me. I will never fulfill them and neither will you. See?" He smiled bitterly. "I made the choice for you. And it was the best choice." He turned again, "now, if you excuse me, I'm busy. More important things to talk about. Later, Watson."
I just wanted to give you all a HUGE Thank You for all your support on the fic! I appreciate all your wonderful comments and kudos and it means a lot to me. I hope you keep enjoying the story :D
She smiled and leaned a bit closer to take a look at the room, but Sherlock blocked the view. "Oh!" She whispered. "Is John in here?"
"Oh you do, you absolutely do. Wow, I never thought you would fall for a greaser, look at that, in love with a bad boy..." She said mockingly.
This was grim and boring and dull and he was getting tired of it and he didn’t know how to make it better, how to make it brighter, how to make it more colorful.
"Oh yes." Sherlock said placing a soft kiss into John's mouth. John cupped Sherlock's face with his hands and opened his mouth and the kiss turned definitely hotter. John reached for Sherlock's hair and ran his hands over it, while the greaser placed a hand on the boy's nape.
Because he knew what Lacuna was and he knew who Melissa was, even though they were supposed to be erased from his mind.
"So you're alive..." Lestrade said, looking down and shaking his head in disbelief. "...I- I'm glad you're back. Things haven't been the same around."
John kissed his forehead and stood there for longer than necessary, his lips silently stating everything he had no chance to say at the moment. Sherlock wished he could grab him and embrace him and never let him go, but moving his arms seemed like too much of an effort, and everything hurt too much to do it. John broke apart just a couple of inches, but close enough so his breath tingled Sherlock's skin when he whispered, "I'll be right back".
John cleared his throat and looked around, the smile vanishing from his face. “Yeah that’s- that’s good. Lead the way.”
He tried his best not to stand up and run towards the chair which somehow became their place of reunion, because he missed Sherlock so badly. He was clenching his fists when turned his face, and saw Mike looking at him worriedly. "Mate, are you alright?"
I just think the chapter title fits so perfectly into the chapter! You can look for the lyrics if you're curious  ;)
"Well, I met him this morning, and the man is an idiot! I think he finally found a place where he belongs! With that gang of brainless people!"
Finally, when they were halfway through their meal, Sherlock turned to look at him. “What? What is it?”, he asked.
"I am...accompanying your son. He wanted to take a look at the crime scene and a...friend of mine is an inspector so he let us in" Sherlock said in an incredibly polite way, at which John frowned and turned to look at him in disbelief. Was he trying to get his mother to like him? No, of course he wasn't.
phase, that as soon as she had Clara she would change completely, but look at her... and my parents don't seem to care at all and I..."
"I'm not a child Mycroft! I don't need protection! And less from someone like you! I can make choices by myself! I'm the smart one."
Sherlock didn’t text, and John shouldn’t feel anxious about it at all, but he did. And he didn’t text Sherlock back either.
"Hey! It's two in the morning, I'm still half-sleep, I escaped from my house and I'm driving a car that's not mine taking a drunk greaser to his house where his brother is probably freaking out! Do you think driving fast is my priority?"
Victor shrugged. “Then what do you want me for? Hurry up! It’s Saturday and it’s going to be a busy afternoon!”He said a bit grumpily, knowing Sherlock wasn’t going to give him anything he wanted.
The first time Sherlock saw a painting he was 4 years old. The National Gallery of British Art was too big and he felt too small, lost amidst the labyrinth of passages, portraits and landscapes. He remembered it clearly, the steady presence of his mother by his side, holding his hand and smiling tightly. She loved this, he could tell.
"I'll go with you", John said, aiming to sit up, but Sherlock softly pushed him back down by the shoulder.
He looked around, not a single sign of Sherlock there. He looked beneath the sheets. He was still dressed, so nothing happened. Still, he was there. Sherlock was incredibly mad at him, so how did he convince him? Did he kiss him? Did he give himself away? Did he tell him that he was desperately and hopelessly in love with him and that the simple thought of seeing him with Irene made his stomach twist even harder? He was terrified.
"...No." John said shaking away the idea from his head. "No, Sherlock, you are drunk and your brother must be upset and I'm doing what it's right and I'm leaving you here."
Sherlock froze right in place. So Mycroft did know what was wrong. "Tell me what happened to him." He asked seriously.
The day John listened to his tape and found out about the truth, he had sent messages to Sherlock in which he found the connection to Lacuna suspicious and he talked about Lacuna as if it was something he was aware of, even though Sherlock had been extremely careful not to mention anything related to it to John, especially when it was related to the case.
"She didn't hurt you?", he asked, remembering what she had done to John. He felt anger rushing all over his body.
“A clinic? Is he healthy?” God, if something happened to John Watson, his brother would just lose it. Mycroft would never hear the end of it.
“What?”, John said, surprised. How much time had passed? He knew it had been long, for he was taking his time with this drawing, he wanted it to be perfect.
John kept kissing Sherlock's skin until he stopped over his pants. Sherlock could feel John's breathing there and felt like he was collapsing. He needed it. "John-", he murmured.
Now Sherlock and John were alone in the room. The weird silence stretched. John looked down at his hands and started clenching and unclenching the fist of his left hand.
Sherlock sighed, closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He was breathing hard, exhausted for all the things he had already done so far this day. When he finally caught his breath he replied. "What did you do to John Watson?"
John understood what she meant with every statement. "Jesus, Harry, no. No, it's just-" he swallowed.
Finally, John conceded with a sigh and extended his own arm. He placed his left hand over Sherlock’s palm, feeling the warmth irradiating from the artist’s hand.
They stared at each other for what Sherlock thought was a long time, when Irene's phone sounded. She looked immediately at the phone lying on the table and ran to grab it. "Sorry, have to answer. I'll be right back."
Sherlock stood still, not moving from the door. He cleared his throat. “It’s still a work in progress”, he said hesitantly and he sounded nervous? Anxious? Scared? Something in between?
...Suddenly, his phone made that sound, John frowned but kept his eyes fixed on some other place, Sherlock went to the kitchen for the phone. John was brought back to reality.
Sherlock stood up and grabbed his coat and put on his scarf. He remembered he had to buy John a Christmas present.
He was dying to know who had entered to his room that Friday evening, three days ago, and what that person had taken. It couldn't have been John, he was with him at Scotland Yard. It couldn't have been Mrs. Hudson, she was on a trip with his new partner. Who had entered to his room? What did that person want? He knew someone had been there just by glancing at his room, something wasn't right, someone took something but he couldn't figure out what if was.
John and Sherlock stood silent as John colored the iris, he continued with the pupil, using a 4B pencil. It gave the perfect contrast between the light/dark blue of his eyes and the deep black of the pupil.
They called a cab and left by the back door of the hotel to avoid the paparazzies. Sherlock could walk but leaning on John, and the problem wasn’t just that he was feeling weak but that his back was killing him. And so was his head. He probably had had a concussion.
A look of guilt and pity flashed through John's face before he schooled his expression. Sherlock smiled at him, trying to calm him. "I need my doctor too, back in 221B."
John didn't feel offended, he actually found it slightly funny. A small smile drew on his face but he shook it away. "Fine, fine, we'll do it about the history of chemistry, what do you say? It's not that long, and it's a topic we like..."
Shit. The history project. How was John supposed to ignore Sherlock when they had to do a work together? "Yes."
John nodded, unable to think of a word to say. He closed his eyes for a second, telling himself it wasn’t the moment to be turned on by Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock nodded. He remembered bits of the panic attack, but after having entered to the crime scene he remembered nothing.
John was staring at him as if he was some kind of mystery, something he couldn't understand or figure out completely.
"If I knew-" He waved his hand in the air "-this would have been my life without him, I just I would have died off that rooftop too." He shook his head. "I'm sorry. I can't keep doing this." He took another deep breath, closing his eyes. "I just... he was a good man." He seemed to gain some strength again. “He… he was important for me. Is. Always will. I really- I really cared about him. He was the best that could have ever happened to me. And I never told him any of it…”
Few minutes before they arrived back home, Harry blinked and started looking at her surroundings before yelling "THE FUCK?"
It was lunchtime and John was still angry and not knowing what he was angry about made him even angrier. Mike was sitting next to him and looked at him a little worried. "Alas John, are you alright? You haven't even touched your food." He said pointing to John's untouched lunch with his fork.
John stared at Sherlock for a long moment, taking him in. His shirt was unbuttoned but not off him, but aside from that, he was naked, exposed, all for John. After a while, John sighed and threw Sherlock another one of his smiles. "Jesus. You're perfect, Sherlock."
"That's your choice, Mr. Holmes. If I were you, instead of trying to erase someone's memories, I'd hold onto them like treasures. You should know, isn't the mind the most precious thing we've got? Then why harming it? Why forcing it to forget something it doesn't want to forget?"
. He didn't look at him, he didn't have his feet on his chair and, during the rest of the class, he didn't disturb him at all, which was the most surprising bit.
But then John realized he was being an absolute idiot for believing in Sherlock Holmes, for thinking it was possible something could happen between them, for trusting him and he was angry again. He took Sherlock's hand away from his face and looked at him seriously. "Just go back to your friends and leave me alone."
He stood silent, asking himself why the hell did everybody seemed to think this was all his freaking fault? He remembered John's words and realized it was accurate: he was okay until he met Sherlock. Of course. Of course it was all his fault, and John was right. It couldn't be, whatever it was, and they had to stay as apart from each other as possible. It was the best thing to do, the only thing to do.
Sherlock looked down at their hands, he slowly brushed his thumb against John’s knuckles, feeling John’s familiar skin on his fingertips.
were the perfect words to say goodbye, but then, when nothing happened, he realized he had just felt the absorbing, substantial, overwhelming pain of loss. Pain of regret. Pain of forgetting. Pain of remembrance. Pain of being forgotten. Pain of guilt.
"Oh, John! Is so great to see you again!" Mrs Hudson greeted him effusively as soon as she opened the door. She hugged him tightly and it should have been awkward but it really didn't feel weird at all.
He got up and went into his room, when he remembered that Irene had sent him another message back at St. Bart's. He took his phone and unlocked it immediately, with curiosity.
John's mom loved Sherlock. Well of course she had no idea what was really happening between the two of them but his son finally had a friend and that was good enough. She welcomed Sherlock almost every day and she gave them ice cream and coffee and tea. John realized Sherlock didn't eat much, he already knew that, but he thought it was because of school or something, he just said eating slowed him down.
John grimaced at the mention of Ella’s name and since then he had shut his eyes closed, clearly in pain.
He reached towards the clinic, trying to stop pulling faces every time he felt his headache getting deeper. Sarah greeted him with an apologetical smile. "Listen, about the article..." She started.
In a moment in which she seemed a bit distracted by a message on her phone, John looked over to her desk and realized the newspaper had a picture of him with... someone.
"Well, I thought so too, but Sherlock started receiving those messages again two days ago, and he looks very affected by them, I don't know, I have a feeling this won't end well."
Sherlock sat in front of him. He wasn’t looking at him, he simply stared at the tea. He didn’t ask any questions, he didn’t pry for any kind of information. It was as if he knew exactly how to deal with those situations, as if he’d lived them himself. John wanted to ask him, but he knew it wasn’t the place nor the moment.
John came back early the next day, he was feeling better, still hurt, but far more relaxed, at least he could face him now. He entered the apartment and caught Sherlock sitting in the living room, touching his violin without playing it. He didn't look up. John took a deep breath.
"Oh, I wouldn't say that." She said standing up, and then she fell, and then Sherlock had to help her to stand up properly. She nodded with a smile and waved goodbye, yelling "CLARAAAA!"
History was his first class and that didn't help because he really didn't want to see Sherlock's face and now they had to work together and he was an idiot and John didn't know what to do anymore. Before entering to the classroom, he took a deep breath and prepared himself to face the boy. Yet, to his surprise, the Greaser ignored him completely,
He stopped abruptly at St. Bart's. He looked at the hospital as if he had never seen it before. He didn't know why he stopped there, he had forgotten why he was running in the first place. He felt his shoe getting wet. He looked down and realized he had been running with his bare feet. He looked down and realized he was stepping on something, but it was dark, so he couldn't quite see what it was.
I observed. It still pains you and it’s reflected on the trembling of your hand. You subconsciously fix your t-shirt constantly to make sure it’s covered even though it’s not necessary because it wouldn’t be visible. You just need the reassurance that it will remain hidden. You wouldn’t do it if there wasn’t
"Thank you. I think I might. Goodbye, Irene". She left. John looked at Sherlock. Still expressionless. Quiet. He wondered how was his pulse. He was dying to know. Probably elevated. God, he hated Irene. He hated her.
It took them around two hours to search the whole flat and Sherlock was furious. He had been so certain that this case was solved, that Hawthorne was the one behind the murders, but nothing.
Sherlock couldn't resist. He moved over and laid on the couch, next to John, placing his arm over John's waist. John giggled into the pillow. "Thank you." John said placing his hand over Sherlock's.
He couldn't explain why John blinked, squishing his eyes shut and grimacing, as if he was in a terrible pain.
Sherlock remained silent. In any other situation, he would have made some kind of remark. Not now, not when John was opening up to him.
John stood up, almost kicking the chair down as soon as he did so. He raised a hand, as if distancing himself from Sherlock and warning him to not come any closer. Sherlock stopped in his tracks, mentally kicking himself for having done
friends, because at least in his case, Sherlock passed from being nothing to being everything, just like that. "Sure."
John hated watching the news, so he tried to avoid them at all costs, he didn't read the newspapers, didn't watch the 8 o' clock news and certainly didn't read any news online. He didn't find them useful, if something too important would happen, he would find out anyway somehow.
Sherlock approached him, looking worried. "Are you okay?" He said, bending down, looking at John's eyes.
As soon as they stepped into 221B, Sherlock turned to look at John and fixed his eyes on his left hand. John felt slightly awkward but showed it to him. Sherlock side-smiled at him, “good”, he said, answering an unspoken question.
He blocked his ears from any sound. He didn’t want to hear John’s voice. He wanted John to leave as soon as possible, He wanted to be alone. He wanted to cry and scream and just let it all go, but without John there. Why was he still there?
Sherlock thought, because he recognized the symptoms. This man thought he'd never be discovered, he thought he would get away with it. And even after being caught, he thought he would still be free, after killing Alice. Absurd.
John laughed and nodded. Sherlock opened his eyes and stared at John. They simply looked at each other silently, none of them even daring to move.
The nurse stood there, looking confused and taken aback for a moment, before sighing and saying "yes, sir", as he opened the door and left.
“I love you”, Sherlock whispered. And he meant it. With his heart, with his soul, with his everything, he meant it.
He took out his books. One of history, which was his first class of the day, the other one from biology, which was his favorite subject, and the other one was of chemistry, he was thinking of joining the club this year.
"Fucking hell!" John cursed, shaking his head, and hating himself a bit for it, he aimed for the front door, following the greaser.
“You won’t”, John said decidedly. But he stood still for a moment, looking away from Sherlock, thinking, the smile fading from his face. He wasn’t really certain if he would ever paint again. The idea was there, the need was there, the paints were there, but his hand betrayed him, over and over.
"I don't know John, I simply don't, I don't want them to start looking for his body or interrogating me, I don't know absolutely anything. But I can't deny that I'm worried, John. I am really worried."
“You were wondering. So was I. But when I looked at you, playing the violin and looking like a painting by Vermeer, I realized that- I want this. I want us. I mean if you’re willing, if you’re willing to want me back.”
He smiled slightly and turned to look at Sherlock, who was taking his gloves off and smiled back at him. "Look who didn't go to school." John teased.
he thought. "And I thought I would start this year and everything would be clear, bright, defined. But now it just seems lost, abstract and shapeless. That's what future looks like for me."
Sherlock frowned, "what is exciting about me being forced into a new school, getting good grades and having to behave?"
John woke up next morning, he didn't remember at which time he had fallen asleep. He remembered he was crying, he remembered he had gotten into a fight with his father and called him a compulsive cheater and a shit father and then...he had a bruise on his shoulder. It hurt. John had had enough, he was tired of being the perfect boy, of working incredibly hard to fill their expectations, and knowing he never would. Everything was upside down now.
It didn’t make sense, John was supposed to be angry with him, John was supposed to not want to do anything with Sherlock anymore, it was the only logical response to all the things that had happened between them but John was talking to him. He. Was. Willingly. Talking. To. Him.
A little increase of the dosage would do. He was a chemist, he knew how to handle these things. It was easier to find the vein, and then he simply allowed himself to feel the liquid merging with his blood.
He felt completely focused, absorbed into what he was painting, as if he was pouring not only his talent, but his mind, his creativity and his soul into drawing Sherlock’s hands.
They stood silent, John kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s works in progress. He had two more paintings than two days ago, he had been inspired, and kept working hard on being better and better. He was a perfectionist, in every sense of the word.
It was hateful, horrible. The worst thing he had ever done and he couldn't believe he was the author of such a terrible drawing. A hasty drawing from a six-year-old would be a Vermeer compared to this drawing.
Sherlock nodded. John smiled and leaned closer to him. He stood mere inches away from Sherlock’s face and for a flitting moment he thought John might kiss him, but he simply placed a kiss on his eyebrow. Just when he was about to pull away, he sighed and wrapped Sherlock into a crushing hug.
The greaser's face suddenly turned serious and he looked down, closing his eyes and taking deep breaths. John leaned down a bit so he could take a better look at Sherlock.
They broke the eye contact and John cleared his throat and turned to look at Irene, frowning. It brought him back to reality. His smile vanished.
Sherlock nodded slowly. It sounded stupid, actually, but Sherlock longed to grasp onto the past, because it now was his task to never let it go, because there were so many stories to tell John, and he needed to make sure there was something keeping him tied to what John had let go.
As soon as the door was closed Sherlock approached him and he was near, so incredibly near, and John couldn't avoid the eye contact, his green/blue/grey eyes fixed on him. He tried his best not to react. "I need to talk to you."
There had been a span of four months between one and the other, what had motivated the killer to act with such urgency lately? Surely there must had been some motivation behind those actions. Was it fear at the possibility of getting caught, now that Sherlock was back in London and Scotland Yard would stop classifying every single murder under the sun as ‘unsolved’? Probably.
"Why did you bring me here? out of all the places you could have taken me to, why here?", he sounded defeated, disappointed. He couldn't help it.
No ‘I see you later’, no ‘I’ll text you’, no ‘let me know if there are new cases’. And Sherlock didn’t know what to make out of that single word.
Sherlock considered his options, and he hated facing those fuckers people called his friends, yet he needed a cigarette
“I”, his voice failed him. “I” , he tried once again, “I was hit repeatedly, whipped, kicked on my stomach, b- burned constantly with the butts of the cigarettes. Over and over. It never stopped. They didn’t stop. They enjoyed it.”
He cleared his throat and frowned, not sure yet if he wanted to say this or not. "We're not a couple. I told her that."
John smiled and answered with another whisper. "God, let me focus on the road or I'll drive slower! I'm warning you!"
John and Harry were on their way to Brighton, and since they had taken the train, he hadn't stopped insisting on it. He hadn't shut, and she realized that it probably wasn't a good idea telling him how she opened up to Sherlock about him, because he would probably freak out and push her out of the train.
Greg greeted them without smiling, he looked worried, something was wrong. He looked at the detective very seriously. "Sherlock, we have another one."
And somehow that gave John enough courage. Sherlock was staring at him expectantly, and John found it he simply couldn’t not do it, he trusted Sherlock with his everything, Sherlock had cured him, had saved him from his stagnation, had brought the colors back.
Sherlock was slowly losing his temper because he knew Mycroft knew. He had to know what was wrong because he was sure there was something his brother was hiding to him. He sighed and looked down. Once he spoke, he felt helpless, and he hated sounding like that to his brother. "Mycroft. Just please, tell me what's wrong."
Sherlock stood silent for a moment and, without looking up, his eyes fixed on that book again, he said in a very very low voice which came almost like a whisper: "...What about chemistry?"
"I won't give them to you, Sherlock! Cool it and start cleaning and we will leave as soon as possible!" Greg said, entering back to the house.
Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He had missed his city badly. Now he was finally coming back to London, It seemed like ages ago.
written on it and recognized the writing: Sherlock. His heart started beating fast and he felt a little nervous. His hands were sweating and he thought about how absurd it was to feel so anxious about something as stupid as a note, but it wasn't just a note, it was a note from Sherlock. He unfolded it and saw the message:
? John would never believe that, ever. "I-", he closed his eyes and prepared himself for an explanation he was supposed to have given three months ago. "I faked it. I needed you to be there. I needed you to
“I told you not to draw hands yet, only if you were feeling bold”, Sherlock said, his eyes still fixed on the paper.
"Then what are you?" John said turning to look at Sherlock. "What do you and I know you are to me, according to you?"
John barely opened his eyes. He mumbled something that Harry didn't understand and closed them again. "JOHN! FOR GOD'S SAKE WAKE UP!"
Sherlock shook his head, “look at what using charcoal did to your face”, he said, pointing towards the pad.
There's nothing wrong! I just want to smoke a fucking cigarette without the company of three idiots who do nothing but pick on the weak ones because it makes them feel strong. How pathetic." Whoops. His anger was bigger than his will.
. It hasn't stopped sounding. It's annoying." Answered John, he glanced at Sherlock, who was still standing in the door. Suddenly, he opened it wider and left.
“Alright”, Sherlock said, slowly walking away without taking his eyes off John’s, looking at each other through the mirror.
"Oh please, your eyes tell me everything I need to know about you, John." Sherlock said, leaning forward so their faces were almost touching and they looked at each other into their eyes. "...and if you can't accept me as I am,
John’s eyes drew themselves closed almost without intending to. As soon as he did, his brain started drawing pictures on his own, and he saw
Of course he’d imagined certain scenarios in which the possibility loomed between them: a soft brush of the hands and a smile would lead somewhere else, but he never imagined it would be actually
When he realized he was being followed he frowned and turned to look at her. "Oh for God's sake what do you want?"
“I would love it if you came back later”, Sherlock said, deducing what John hadn’t had enough courage to say.
John nodded with a smile. “You know what fascinates me the most? That in between the merge of one color and the other there’s a small ray of light creeping through. There’s not only an infinite amount of tones within it, but an infinite amount of light. Beautiful, isn’t it?”, he carried on painting, but Sherlock didn’t focus his attention on it, because he knew he’d be distracted by John’s technique and wouldn’t be able to carry on with his story. He didn’t even know why he was telling the story in the first place, he just felt like doing it.
Sherlock shook his head. He was tired, he wanted to sleep. Lestrade was right. He didn't want Lestrade to be right.
The case was actually…a disappointment. A locked room mystery in which a private archive in a manor, which held original -and very, very classified- files from the Cold War had been broken in and some of the papers had been stolen. The family hadn’t been there and apparently, no one had gotten in during the hour in which it had happened and although the archive room didn’t have security cameras the rest of the manor didn’t register any movement nor unusual activity. It was a matter of the utmost importance because the security of England’s relationship with the U.S. and Russia might be compromised had been those papers revealed. Seemed promising.
Sherlock looked at John, expressionless, he took his phone, looked at the message and locked it again, without saying a word. John was staring at him. "Happy?"
Sherlock looked down, he then turned to look at John, his nostrils getting bigger and bigger. "What the fuck did I tell you? I TOLD YOU TO FUCKING STAY IN THE CAR!"
Melissa’s smile widened. “I was bored. Needed some entertainment. John Watson proved to be quite the entertainment, don’t you think?”
"Of course you don't have to, but I mean, if you want, you're welcome to join. We gather today and every Monday afternoon."
Sherlock leaned closer (even closer) and looked at John straight into his eyes. John couldn't blink. He couldn't think. Not when Sherlock was this close and when his grey/blue/green eyes were so fixed on him. "You are lying and you know it. Because it's everything you want, isn't it?" Sherlock whispered.
If Sherlock held any hope by now, it vanished completely when he heard John's words. That was something John Watson would probably tell him if he was absolutely angry at him, the thing was, the old John wouldn't say it with such coldness, avoiding his gaze. He bit his lip and looked down.
And a beating heart in between, keeping them in the present, reminding them of where they were, and of the unbearable yet absolutely necessary thought that they were
What? Sherlock asked himself. Because hell, that was wrong. How could John not be living there anymore? That was their home. 221B was everything. He stared at Mycroft silently. Then swallowed, turned towards the other end of the room and replied a simple, small “Oh.”
Harry leaned closer to him and told him in a murmur: "Seize this chance. Don't blow it, idiot. I need to know all the details tomorrow."
John shook his head almost violently. “No. I’m not backing down. I just, I wanted to make sure he’ll be gone for real.”
"Jim didn't hurt you?" Sherlock's eyes examined every inch of John's body, and he felt so exposed, so vulnerable, so small.
So no, Sherlock had no friends, and he knew that even if he attempted to have one it would never work, caring for someone made one very sloppy and a lovesick and a fool. And he didn’t want that.
Mycroft stood still for a moment, surprised by his brother's sudden show of emotions. He dragged a deep breath and pressed one of the buttons of the telephone. "Bring me John Watson's file."
He should have called Lestrade. He really should have. But he didn’t because that was just who he was. He had thought he’d be able to handle it by himself, and there he was, lying on the floor and desperately trying to save the man he loved.
Harry looked at John suspiciously, but smiled, as if she was able to read what was going through his mind: Sherlock. "Sure, right, of course you are, you are definitely not undressing Sherlock in your mind". She winked at him and he rolled his eyes.
After a day which seemed to be eternal, John drove back home. He hated to admit it but he missed Sherlock, he felt he needed someone to talk about and that only the greaser would understand him. He hated feeling his absence.
"Shut up, of course I remember, it's just that, should I feel something different? Is there any reason at all?"
He stood silent for a while, until Irene chuckled. "I'm just kidding with you, Sherlock! See you tomorrow, my dear!" She winked at him and left.
"I will. I just... I need to think." As Sherlock was about to open the door to leave, his phone sounded. It was the woman. He stopped for a moment.
Okay Sherlock needed to something about it now. He turned and felt a sudden rage and disgust with himself and had no one else to pour it into so he just looked at Mrs Hudson and yelled. "STOP TALKING NOW! JUST SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!"
"Sherlock." John said trying to sound more calmed, his voice tone was now lower and he was close to Sherlock, but he didn't feel like he was close, it was cold. "...just think for a second about what you're doing, what we're doing, this just can't be it. Not like this. I refuse to let you go." He said shaking his head.
That was a really stupid thing to say of something that was not alive. Perhaps the romanticism was catching up to him and that
John went to the living room where Sherlock was sitting, drinking a cup of tea. He was silent, thinking, he was trying to solve a mystery, he had been like this for the last three days, and he couldn't find a solution yet. It was driving him crazy, it must had been a very elaborated plan if it was taking him so long to solve it.
"I'm starting to believe you seriously have a problem, Watson." Sherlock said at last, sucking on his cigarette, taking a deep, long suck.
John took it and Sherlock helped him up. His legs were strong enough to hold his weight, but his mind wasn’t strong enough to avoid the limping and so he found himself with a limp worse than just after he’d been discharged.
"He... he moved out of Baker Street, I've been told, although I still don't see why. You and him used to talk sometimes, maybe you had some idea where he could have moved to or something..."
Sherlock shrugged. "Maybe it was another one of my lies. How did you call them? Right. Another one of my
Sherlock threw him a killing gaze before taking a deep breath and following John. Mycroft kept his small smile and followed his little brother.
And a history of emotions and a history of self-discovery and a history of finding value in life and in art again.
He might as well say the truth once and for all. He didn't want his last conversation with John Watson to be full of lies. They'd had enough of that already.
It was so different from their other kisses, so completely different that John felt as if it was their first kiss ever, and it was
A voice invaded his mind, blocking John's fading figure. A seductive voice, a voice he had eventually come to hate, but that had meant so much once.
When Sherlock was seven years old, he saw a rainbow in the sky. He looked at the colors that mixed each other and yet distinguished one another and merged themselves with the soft blue of the sky. He attempted to reproduce it over and over again, and never managed to. No matter how much he tried, the colors never reached that simple yet complex mix of that rainbow. He grew tired of colors eventually, for they would never be quite as real as reality itself, as nature itself.
The greaser leaned closer, dangerously closer, John thought, and looked straight into his eyes, not taking the gaze away from him.
"Stop implying...whatever it is you're implying." Sherlock said trying to keep his pride but then he realized it came out more like a beg.
Sherlock couldn't help but sob this time. The tears felt as if they were burning. He remembered that part of the tape completely, and to think about the pain he had put John into, to think he had almost pushed him towards the very limit...he couldn't, he simply couldn't. "No. I wouldn't have allowed you to. I had to protect you, John, please."
Sherlock was reluctant to let go, but he knew that he had to, at some point. He moved his forehead slightly and John understood immediately, for he loosened his hold. Sherlock looked up and John smiled softly at him, placing one of his hands on his cheek.
So chapter 2 is here! Thanks to everyone who have been reading it and have left kudos! It means a lot :)
He went to his bathroom to take a shower. He took out a knitted sweater and grabbed his warmest pants. Winter was hitting hard on London this year. Although that wasn't really unusual.
Sherlock dragged a deep breath and prayed all gods that what he was about to say would make a bit of coherence at least for John. "I-" He cleared his throat. "I checked into the clinic on January 29th of 2010 and you were the doctor on shift. I- I had overdosed and you had to stabilize me."
"John", Sherlock said and he sounded almost choked, because John was aware, because John was here, John recognised him.
"Oh no, no, no don't come with these stories! You slept last night with Sherlock! You wouldn't have been so happy if you would had slept in the couch!"
He finally stood in front of the blue room. That same room. He was standing in the exact place he had been at while listening to their conversation.
“You- you have the technique, and the body you were painting in Mike’s photograph was fantastic, and I was wondering if you could teach me, just a little, how to be a better painter.”
John smiled. Sherlock smiled back and bit his lip. God, what was wrong with him? Why was he acting like an ordinary fifteen-year-old boy?
As soon as they broke the kiss, John stared at him and seemed to realise that Sherlock was all dressed-up. He frowned. "Where are you going?"
"It's just... I'm not like that." Sherlock cleared his throat. "Well, at least not in front of people. But with you... It feels...
John came back. He had not left. A rush of relief sped through his whole body. He listened to the ruffle of skin against ground, when had John ended up barefoot? He felt as John wiped him, the softest of touches, and he was speechless at the deep and intense feeling of John’s care.
Sherlock’s eyes roamed down John and stopped as they fixed on his left hand. “I do. I’m certain of it. Absolutely, completely certain”, he said softly.
"When you faked you death, let me tell you, it was hard. Harder than any of us expected. He was so affected by it, that beautiful and full of life smile had erased again, and there was nothing but pain. John said he was fine, but I know him better. He was lying. He was suffering, he had seen everything he had fall right in front of his eyes. He tried not complaining, not saying a word. But I knew better, when John is quiet, things aren't okay. But he had his own way of dealing with grief. It was like a flashback, seeing John in that state, wearing the same face he had wore the day he arrived to England from the war. He was lost."
Sherlock. Oil paints are immortal. Whereas acrylics fade and aquarelles vanish, oil paints remain in time, they’re a fixed point. Their color remains. Perhaps time will change it just a little, but it will preserve the texture, the complexity and the beauty of their colors. You’re wasting them by using just a palette of browns and pinks, Sherlock, they’re giving you a universe of options and yet you choose to settle with one of the thousands of millions of stars.”
Lestrade had given him this case a couple of days after he’d arrived, to give him something to occupy himself with. He’d given an ordinary case that had ended up hitting extraordinarily close to home. But there might have been others before. Others that went unconnected, unsolved, that were discarded, thrown away and…
Sherlock stood still, thoughtful. He remained looking down and in the meanwhile the DI couldn't help but wonder what was the reason behind John's unawareness.
"So?" Sherlock said, walking out of the room next door. He was now full-on detective mode, with his suit on and clean shaven. Mycroft turned to look at him, eyebrows rising. "Where's John Watson?"
John leaned heavily against the pillow and snuggled. "No, I'm not going anywhere." He barely muttered.
John turned, looking at Sherlock, frowning in confusion. He leaned closer to Sherlock and stared at the stranger, whose eyes seemed fixed permanently on the greaser, checking him up and down, up and down, fiercely.
As soon as he finished talking, John felt something had kicked his seat. Not a difficult deduction, he turned to look at Sherlock who was staring at him with a smile in his face. "Pair up with me,  Johnny boy?"
This chapter is a bit complex and tricky. I hope I made everything clear, yet if you have any questions, just hit me up in the comments!
“Did you take in the shape, the color? Since you’re so fond of colors”, Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes.
Greg seemed to realize of the panic crossing by Sherlock's eyes and took a step forward, waving his hand. "John. Hello. How are you feeling?"
"Well, since you think Elvis is black... And Mozart is better, I decided I had to share my extensive knowledge on the topic with you. It's the best I can do to help you get out of the ignorance you're stuck in."
"That there is no room for friendship, there's no room for anything, actually, between the two of us. And it's okay, it's the way things have to be."
Sherlock was scared. But now was not a time to let fear overcome him. Now was the time to use John as a motivator to solve the case, to use him as a conductor of light.
"Well...goodbye." Sherlock said opening the door. Mrs Hudson came out and gave him a huge hug. Sherlock felt a bit embarrased while Irene just laughed.
He deepened their kiss, as if they had the need to share their breath, as if they had a desperate desire for each other, which they did. Right now Sherlock could feel it. He could feel it all over him, but better than that, he could almost feel John's desire, he knew it was just as genuine as his. The idea made him lose his breath. Even more.
Sherlock sighed and turned to look at the window, pulling the glass completely down, and the wind was high but it was warm and it was comfortable.
Greg turned to look at Sherlock. "By the way Holmes, where have you been all these past days during lunch? Man, we always save you a spot and you never arrive!"
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but he came up with nothing for a while. John’s eyes roamed down for just a couple of seconds, just a couple of small and far too short seconds, and stopped in front of Sherlock’s gaping mouth. For a moment, a fleeting moment, John wondered what it’d be like to kiss those lips. Dry yet soft, pliant and demanding, those lips would be like everything else that was a part of Sherlock: absorbing.
Sherlock didn't answer. He stared at her without even blinking. He looked so confused. "Mr. Holmes?" -Nothing. "MR. HOLMES!"
Without taking his eyes off Sherlock's, he slowly took the IV off. Sherlock couldn't help but grimace a bit, otherwise he remained silent.
“He was the one who chose to check into Lacuna. Honestly I didn’t expect him to do so, he just gave me the perfect chance. How could I possibly let him go?”
Sherlock walked towards his desk and grabbed two charcoals, he handed one to John and took the other. “Come here”, he said, as he took a big piece of paper over the table.
He cleared his throat and blinked. John remained completely focused on the drawing -Sherlock wouldn’t criticize it yet, not yet, but he could already tell it was wrong- and his tongue was still touching the corner of his lips.
decision!" Hawthorne said pointing at Sherlock, who hadn't reacted at all yet. "But I must ask you, Mr Holmes, are you sure of what you are requesting? This process is irreversible."
John broke their kiss and stared at Sherlock. His cheeks were flushed and his hair was tousled and the image was so perfect and so sexy that Sherlock's cock responded immediately.
He sighed as he entered the school and walked towards the lockers. He looked all over the place to see if Sebastian or Jim were near, because he certainly couldn't stand being pushed against the lockers again, not today. They didn't seem to be around. He opened the locker and a note fell right into his feet. He opened it, saw the
John turned to look at Sherlock for a moment, his eyes widening, while Sherlock decidedly did not stare at him because his body would betray him and he'd show how terrified and how weak he felt in that moment. Then John turned back to stare into the horizon.
Sherlock stopped and stared at John's chest, marvelled by having the chance of looking at him like that. He had been allowed to touch John's shoulder scar, but he had never been able to see it. He felt as if John was opening the last of the barriers who protected him, letting him in. He touched John's skin, softly, exploring his chest with the pads of his fingers.
“Except for when he drew them in charcoal. When he studied hands he did them perfectly, accurately, respecting the human form. Well, as perfect as hands could be during the Renaissance.”
He was holding his phone when it rang again: it was definitely her, without a single doubt. He unlocked it immediately, he was so curious, what could she possibly want right now? "
John didn't have a good feeling about where this conversation was heading, so he decided to shake his head instead. "We're not discussing this again, because you know you're just saying a huge amount of bullshit just to make yourself look good".
He heard a small gasp through the phone. Then she whispered into the phone. "Holmes! Where is John? Damn it it's 11:00 p.m! Mom is so worried! But she didn't have your phone number! She even asked me to go to your house! If something happened to my little brother I swear I'm going to kick your ass!"
"My house." Sherlock answered without hesitation, because he was dying to be in his house alone listening to Buddy Holly or Chuck Berry until things were better which seemed to be never because he was just messing up and messing up. The crime scene could wait for today.
They finished their cuppas in silence, and as soon as Greg took the last sip, he stood up. "Well, John, it was great seeing you again. I just wanted to see how you were."
She shook her head. "No, you're right. You're right." First time they talked again since he called her an alcoholic.
“Well, I’m glad you finally worked things out.”Greg said, leaning on one of the lockers. John had just passed by and thrown a shy smile at Sherlock, which he replied quickly, trying to avoid noticing by anybody else.
Sherlock scoffed. As if Mycroft had it in himself to be able to worry about someone. He stared at his phone. No new phone calls. No new texts. Nothing.
"No. You need to rest and take care of your leg", Sherlock said and for a second was thankful of John's injury, it was a great excuse to use, a way to tell himself that he wasn't lying to John nor hiding things from him, not directly.
“Ah. Yes, quite commonly. Sometimes the image just appears in my head and I have to take the brush and express everything that’s in my brain immediately, lest I forget it.”
For the rest of the night, John kept looking at Sherlock, who was checking his phone every five minutes. Finally, he got up feeling upset and yelled at the detective. "Bloody hell Sherlock! What is the goddamned problem? Why are you looking at your phone every second? Who are you so desperate to talk to?" -of course John knew, but he wanted to hear it from Sherlock.
Sherlock opened his mouth but couldn’t say a thing. He hated when his brain short circuited like that, and he was unable to produce a sound. John was staring at him anxiously. “Sherlock?”, he said again, his nerves flattening a little.
He followed him out of the door but John was nowhere to be seen anymore. For how long had Sherlock stood in the middle of the room, lost in thought?
Sherlock smiled widely and sighed in relief. Yes. John wanted to come, John was actually excited of going with him? It seemed absolutely impossible, but it seemed to be true.
As soon as they arrived to John's room, Sherlock moved towards the bed and arranged it a little. "Okay, get yourself under the covers, you must be freezing."
"You're kidding right? Are you crazy? I'm not leaving my girlfriend unconscious on the floor! Plus my parents can't see her! They know nothing!" She started pacing across the bathroom, touching her head desperately. "Shit. They know nothing. Shit they're coming. I need to do something NOW!"
“This painting is unfinished because he killed himself. Don’t you see it?”, he said, turning to look at Sherlock, waving his hands in the air.
John felt a pinch of anger in his head, he was turning red, he breathed and told himself again to be patient. "I'm not here to talk about me, okay? So I would appreciate if you saved your insults for later."
“I might have forgotten to mention”, Melissa said as Sherlock turned his gaze to John, “anything that might trigger John’s memory will cause him pain”.
It was one of his particularities, as if he didn't have enough of those. John never looked angry. When John was angry, he smiled.
Anthea looked down and Mycroft knew. Shit.  “He was checked in today. I don’t think there’s anything left to do. The process is very fast and very effective. It’s permanent.”
Actually, upon closer inspection on John Watson's face, Sherlock saw a chiaroscuro in its own. He saw the conflicting emotions coming to life, a kind of relief, a kind of deep feeling drawn in his expression,
Surprisingly enough, Sherlock looked up and his eyes gleamed with something that John could quite tell. His expression was open and he looked so
She widened her eyes and stared at her brother, looking surprised. "What? The greaser brought me here?"
He barely had time to nod when she was already walking out the door, and just as mysteriously as she arrived, she left.
He sighed and stood still for a moment, simply staring at the black stain the charcoal was leaving in his fingers. He liked the feeling of it. He liked the idea of it, he liked that with simply the touch of his fingers he could fade out the trace he’d made, yet the shadow of the trace would remain there, permanently.
"Good morning baby brother! Oh! A cup of tea! Trying to recover from last night's action?" She was having a huge smile on her face, he didn't even look up, he kept reading the newspaper and drinking his tea trying to hide his disappointment. "Come on,
“Yes. About violence in art. How could he ask me that? How could he?”, John said, feeling his anger rising.
Sherlock widened his eyes and stared at him, then he took off the mask for a moment. "I thought Dr. Watson was the one in charge", he said, trying not to sound hurt.
Although Greg was right. That was not his choice to make. It was their choice to make. The two of them would figure it out along the way. He stayed true to his word, he would do anything John would ask of him, anything.
Sherlock retreated immediately and stared at him wide-eyed. "You're bleeding." He said and ran towards the bath, he came back with a wet flannel with which he cleaned John's lip.
There was a lot of pressure applied on to the ring, a fast, sharp noise, which could only mean there was a client in desperate need for help. He jumped with excitement. It was a shame Mrs Hudson wasn't home to answer it, but he reached down the stairs happily. He needed a case, otherwise his brain was going to explode and it would give to another part of his body he didn't want to pay attention to right now, or never.
And he had no idea of what was that feeling he got in his stomach every time the thought of Sherlock came to his mind, and what was all of this? What had changed so much? What was so interesting about him? Could it really be true? Sherlock felt something,
for telling our father, for forcing me to go to rehab and for taking the only good thing I had left out of my life."
John didn't smile either, but he tried to be friendly, he always tried to be friendly with him, because otherwise it would probably end up in a fight. "I just wanted to confirm to know if I have to wait for you and your precious club." He said contemptuously.
And then, without saying another word, Sherlock turned, looked at his friends and said with a smile: "Let's go. I would kill for a cigarette. I don't care if I get expelled." They laughed and left along with him.
He came back to his flat and closed the door behind him, leaning against it and closing his eyes. He couldn’t lose John, not after all the things they’d shared already, he couldn’t let him go.
Sherlock's expression turned more serious and threatening as he spoke. "It's Holmes for you, Watson. I've never called you John."
He sighed and rubbed his eyes. He hadn't slept at all last night, he stood there, looking at the ceiling, then at the windows, then at the clock. He was exhausted and he didn't want to do anything, lest of it all facing Mycroft. He grabbed a pillow nearby and tossed it towards the door.
John felt tempted to go back to his house and ignore Sherlock completely, but he couldn't resist. "Damn it!" He said stepping into the crime scene.
"Technology we've never seen before, attached to the people's necks, leaving marks people don't know they have, and don't remember ever acquiring-"
Sherlock’s palm under John’s hand moved up slowly, so their touch was firmer. John’s hand had stopped trembling completely.
John tried his best to ignore him but he just couldn't. There was something in Sherlock's face, in the way he grimaced when he saw him walking in, in he way he started tapping his feet on the ground and looked down. The greaser felt exposed. John could tell from just looking at his face.
Sherlock sighed. “Yes. I liked rainbows. I always have. There’s something unusual about the colors in it, isn’t there? Each one of them is perfectly distinguishable, and yet they merge with one another. There’s a small space between one line and the other where they’re a completely different color. You’d said before that a color is not just a color, and in a rainbow there aren’t just seven colors, there are thousands of them, coming together and blending each other harmonically. It’s fascinating.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, then closed it again. He didn't know what to say. He still didn't believe it was because of him, it couldn't be him. They looked at each other in silence, in a very weird silence.
Fuck, fuck this. Fuck Sherlock. Fuck Irene. Suddenly, he hated Harry for this brilliant idea, he hated himself for playing along with it, for picturing things that weren't there, that weren't real. But most of all, he was feeling nothing but anger towards the detective.
The dinner looked delicious, Sherlock had to admit. As soon as he walked towards the table his stomach started making sounds, reminding him of the fact he hadn't eaten anything since the day before. He ate all of it, it tasted delicious.
"That's what you think. I shall go, I have no time to lose. I'll find her, Sherlock. I can assure you that."
He sat pushing John's desk. John felt a lot of anger towards this guy, it had been an accident, he didn't mean to crash with him, anyway it had been his fault too because he wasn't looking his path! Then why was he the only one who apologized? God, he really didn't like this new greaser.
He placed it on the tip of his tongue. He felt good all of the sudden, just because he was tasting it.
"Cut with exactly the same knife, a very thin, very precise cut throughout the abdomen, a knock with a blunt object to bring her unconscious. 5 stabs to give her hardly any time to survive. She died in three minutes. Yes, is from the same person."
"They are idiots! What if he's losing his vital signs? What if there's something wrong in his head? What if he passes out again? I need to see him!" He said, unable to hide his despair.
Mycroft joined his fingertips and placed them just below his chin, apparently this was a gesture common in all the Holmes. He stood there thinking, his brother was next door excited like a kid in Disney World, counting the hours to find a man who wouldn’t recognize him anymore.
"Hello?" He heard through the phone. A woman's voice. Harry. Damn it. He was hoping his mom would pick up.
Instead, Sherlock just shrugged. "At least you called me Sherlock, Johnny boy. So we're getting somewhere." He said winking at him and John just couldn't be mad at him. It was impossible.
John softly caressed Sherlock's forearms and the warmth seeping through those perfect hands was enough to calm him down completely.
"There's nothing we can do, John. We can't solve 25 questions in ten seconds. So I recommend you relax and act normal when he comes."
"Yet you were really drunk and you nearly died. You know, Sherlock, it's such a shame that someone as smart as you doesn't know how to use his intelligence correctly."
Oh no. He’d said it aloud again. He really had to stop those stupid impulses of saying whatever he thought.
Then an awkward silence fell. Sherlock was looking at John, without taking his eyes from him. They didn't talk for a long while, and Harry finally decided to break the uncomfortable moment. "Well, our cab is waiting, so we'll better be off. Goodbye, Sherlock! Don't murder anyone while we're out!"
"Four of your clients have died!", Sherlock replied, rising his voice tone and startling her, "I think their security is more important than their privacy!"
John rang the bell of 221B exactly at 7 p.m. on that Thursday night. It took Sherlock less than three seconds to open it. He had been waiting for him. Good. They could keep doing this for a long time. It felt good. It was nice finding someone that shared the same passion but focusing it on a different angle, it was nice having someone to talk to, someone to laugh with, to learn from, to-
He walked towards Sherlock, his eyes fixed on him, and he took the palette from his hands. “Well, Sherlock Holmes, prepared to be marveled. Not everyone has the pleasure of witnessing John Watson at work.”
Oh God. Sherlock felt John’s pain as if it was his own. He felt that thought as if it was crushing his heart, tearing him apart. He felt he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think. He felt the strength leaving his body by putting himself in John’s place before he decided to get his mind erased, he could feel the desperation in John’s voice when he listened to the tape, but he never really understood the weight of it all.
Sherlock took a deep breath and closed his eyes as soon as he exited the classroom. He leaned his forehead against the lockers and stood there for a while. He didn't feel strong enough to do anything. He hated himself for feeling so weak, for allowing so much space of his brain to be taken by John Watson.
"My father allowed me to come back in here while they traveled, with the condition I'd be monitored constantly by the police so I wasn't getting drugged and causing trouble. There I realized that they were a bunch of idiots and they weren't doing their job so I did it for them", he said lightly.
“Yeah and you failed. Seriously Sherlock? Over three months to solve a case of serial murders? Getting slow aren’t we? Definitely slower than John’s blog claims you to be.”
"Hello, sir." John said sighing as soon as he saw Hikes sitting in the desk, checking the papers they had delivered during the class. The project.
John had made one big mistake. A huge one. He knew they were meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays (good) but he had never asked Sherlock when the classes would start and so he was standing in front of 221B Baker Street, oscillating, hesitating, not knowing what to do.
"Oh, I'm used to that. We had a fight, as usual, I told him to fuck off and leave you  alone and he said I was the biggest disappointment in the family."
"Good, good!" She said nodding up and down, up and down, up and down and smiling. "I'm good too. Have you seen Clara? I lost her... I think I saw her like an hour ago. Oh! That song!" She said yelling. "I LOVE that song!"
"What?!", Jim snapped, throwing his head back on the couch. He opened one of his eyes for a moment and fixed his gaze on Sebastian. "Did little Seb get into a fight?"
"...It's been an exhausting day and I think the anger helped it. So I'd better be off." John said, looking at Sherlock in the eyes. They stared at each other for a moment, silently. Sherlock taking in every little detail about John and keeping it in the depths of his mind as a treasure, John wondering how the hell was it possible he had forgotten the fact he had met that particular man.
Sherlock felt as if he had been punched. Suddenly, the pain, the endless, indescribable pain was back with a deep intensity. "Thank you", he whispered, "for everything. For nothing. Just, thank you."
Mycroft felt nervous, it was a weird feeling coming from him. "She... She is not... dead, and she is... back, apparently"
"Oh no, go ahead. I want to have it." Sherlock said, coming closer to Mycroft. John looked at them, not knowing what to do.
It was pointless and he would get nowhere with those classes, but at least he’d get to see Sherlock Holmes in action.
Sherlock shook his head as he felt his senses slowly coming back to him. His breathing was returning to normal. “No, no, it’s okay.”
“War and violence”, Mike replied. “If I’m not mistaken, the title is: expressing the inexpressible: war and violence in the eyes of art.”
By the time John reached the cafeteria, they were almost out of lunch, which was cool, because he really didn't feel like eating right now. His whole body was filled with something he could only express as a feeling of anger boiling and desperate to get out. He dragged a deep breath, closed his eyes for a moment and went to sit right next to Mike.
Trembling had stopped altogether by Thursday. After the Tuesday class John slept placidly and when he woke up the next morning he was feeling decidedly better. More confident in what he drew at least.
"Stop it! Stop it right now! Stop saying all of that!" John said a bit desperately, wanting to hear more but not sure of how he would react to it.
"Yes. It was a surgery on my bloody shoulder. I broke it after I fell on the street. I crashed with a cyclist and... I don't know why I'm telling you that, what does it have to do with this?"
John pointed at Sherlock's nose. "They are destroying your nostrils. And clearly they are causing you hallucinations."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and let out a sigh. "Look, I'm sorry I called you an ankle-biter and I'm sorry I was so mean to you."
John kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock and then turned to look at Mrs Hudson "No, no. We're not a couple."
Sherlock dragged a breath so deep that Lestrade could perfectly hear it through the phone. When his voice came back he sounded defeated, lost. "It's the- the clinic to erase the mind."
Sherlock woke up to feel warmth next to his body. He was confused, for a second he didn't know where he was or what he was doing there, all he knew was that he was certainly not in Baker Street, and that it was morning.
How could he even put it into words? How could he express how much he admired John Watson and how much he hated the fact that he admired John Watson, because he had proven him
It was early in the morning when John woke up. Sherlock was still sleeping, his back turned at him again. He stood up from the bed to go to the bathroom, and he definitely wanted to go back to it. He did. He was going to wait until Sherlock woke up, just to see him, to watch him opening his eyes by his side. That was all he needed.
John laughed, leaning his head against the wall and closing his eyes. Sherlock stared at him in wonder, and smiled even wider at the sight.
"You- um- You'll be discharged today. Your brother's downstairs, signing the papers", he said, unable to meet Sherlock's eyes.
John's mother opened the door just a bit so she could see who was there, as soon as she saw her soon she said: "John!", she opened the door wider and looked at Sherlock, then looked down as fast as she could.
He could also blame it on John’s painting. But no matter what, he couldn’t help relating the sudden change in his life to that broken, bruised artist who without even trying had managed to completely turn it around.
And John had shown his interest on him ever since he came back. At first, Sherlock had been unable to draw to conclusions but the truth was there, and looking back at it, it looked pretty obvious now. Had John felt something for Sherlock before? It seemed impossible but-
He walked through the door, out of the building and into the cold afternoon. He started walking without knowing where he was going. He used to do that sometimes, a long time before. Before Afghanistan.
“Because I don’t want it to be part of me, I- wait a second”, John’s brain finally pulled the strings together, “I never told you about my scar. How did you know?”
