“Don’t even get me started.” Dean muffles a yawn behind his coffee cup before taking a hard swig of it. He shuffles inside and hands over an origami Pikachu and the DVD, because it’s Saturday and he isn’t about to break tradition. “You know that technician I mentioned last night?”
“Cas!” Dean’s smile is almost too bright to look at directly. “What a nice surprise to see you on Valentine’s Day.”

Castiel is still thinking it over when Charlie comes back downstairs to get her supper. She takes her time with adding more cheese and bacon to the bowl and loading up a small plate with vegetables. He watches her for a distraction. Really, he probably shouldn’t say anything more, but why not? If he can tell Dean this little bit of information about him, then maybe one day he can work up to telling him what he is. If Castiel tells him that, then they could go out and he would have to carry around the stupid little ache in his chest whenever he looks at Dean. He’s become far too painfully aware of it since he realized his feelings and it’s grown very annoying.
This is literally all their fault. He wouldn’t

Cas clears his throat and taps at the stack of games piled on the table. “Are you okay to play any of these or would you prefer that we just get right to watching the movie? I don’t want to keep you here any longer than you want to be.”
It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what Cas was going to say. In the year that they’ve known each other, Dean has gotten pretty good at reading between the lines with him. While his presence might calm Cas’s mind, the spell has ramped up now that he’s identified a partner he approves of. The spikes of the spell are shorter in length, but they’re more frequent now – and it’ll probably be like that right up until it works itself out of his system.
The next thing that catches Dean’s eye, besides the complete lack of people anywhere, is the shelf behind the counter with a crystal ball nestled in between stacks of mugs and baggies of what have got to be coffee beans. Now the question is, does the crystal ball serve a purpose or is it just some decoration? He’s tempted to ask, but it’s kinda rude to ask the workers if they’ve got anything to do with witchcraft. Dean’s not nothing against Witches, but he’s got an insatiable curiosity when it comes to having Creatures around.

Dean laughs and lifts his head to kiss his cheek. “Well, I’m up now. Do you want me to run downstairs and gets us both a coffee?”

that John gave him when he turned sixteen. Sam is forever bitter than Dean has one and he doesn’t. It’s basically just a felt Santa with a zippered pouch for a belly. That little guy is a tradition passed down from Winchester to Winchester, starting with Dean’s Great-Grandpa, who gave it to his Grandpa, to his Dad, and then to him. Every Christmas, the owner of the bag writes the year on a dollar bill, rolls it up, and adds it to the bunch in the pouch.
He’s got a point, but that doesn’t lift the guilt squeezing Dean’s chest like a vise. There must have been something he could have done? Some way he could have stopped it all from happening. Just because he can’t think of it right now doesn’t mean a damn thing.

He didn’t really intend to say that, but it makes Dean blush. Castiel smiles at it and holds up an empty cup. “Who else is working tonight? I’ll make their favourites, also for free.”
Realization spreads across his face and he shakes his head. “Never mind. Just go to bed, Cassie.”

“Why?” Cas tilts his head and glances between the dragons and Dean.
Neither Charlie nor Jo are home again, so Dean doesn’t have anyone to confirm that he looks good. Usually they’re his home-based wingmen for him. He’ll be winging it tonight without his wingmen, amusingly enough. There’s no one home to tell him not to get a re-useable shopping bag and fill it with a boxed pizza from the freezer and a couple bags of chips. If he’s going to be the asshole who gets his friends to help him wrap his Christmas gifts, then he’s going to bring a ton of food to pay Cas for it. Well, that and Cas

The lights have been dimmed, the curtains drawn, and the couch fluffed up to optimal comfort. Dean even has the DVD set up in the player; ready and waiting for him to turn it on. He sits in his usual corner of the couch, more from habit than anything else. The last time Cas was here, he sat at the opposite end of the couch. This time, however, he sits right next to him so their elbows are bumping. Dean flashes a grin at him and throws an arm across the back of the couch, though it’s mostly on Cas’s shoulders if he’s going to be honest.
Dean rolls his eyes and grabs the thong, chucking it right into the drawer it came. “Now you’re not only being annoying, you’re also being

Dean won’t deny that he’s a grumpy bitch when he’s woken before his alarm. It’s been one of his biggest pet peeves his whole life and he hates it; even when it’s just by a few minutes. Because the fact of the matter is, no matter when he’s woken up, he just can’t get back to sleep. Like right now he takes a good ten minutes to try and get back to sleep before he just flat gives up. It’s not going to happen and now he’s going to be in a bad mood until something comes along that perks things up for him.
It takes a few minutes before Cas takes a deep breath. “What if I’m bad at it?” He lifts his head, but he doesn’t meet Dean’s eyes. “I’m worried I’m going to be so terrible at it that you’ll –”
“You knew we would.”

As per the usual, Dean did fucking nothing. Just like he didn’t do anything to stop the Witches from taking Cas in the first place. Or just like how he hasn’t done anything to find him. All Dean does is talk a big game and make the motions –

“Well, yeah.” Dean chews on his bottom lip when glancing up at him. “You want me to list the reasons or something?” He could, but he’d probably die if he had to.
Dean hums as he continues his dedicated exploration of Castiel’s wings. “Doesn’t Gabriel touch them?”
The snow is falling rather heavily for a Montpelier February evening. It’s fluffy, thick, and exactly the kind of snow that Castiel loves walking in. Unfortunately, Gabriel had other ideas. He was very insistent that Castiel not walk in it, purely for the reason that he
Good thing he didn’t list any booze because Dean would probably cave all over that. “Would it be too cliché to want the tub of ice cream from the freezer?” A pint of Rocky Road sounds fucking amazing right now and he’s suddenly got a hell of a craving.
of what kind of designs you want to do?”
Oh, he should maybe not think about that. It’s counterproductive to what he’s going to try to do. Though he should definitely keep thinking about Dean in the shower. That will help matters immensely. He’ll just think about Dean wet, soapy, and naked. He’ll rub one out and hopefully his body won’t decide to sucker-punch him by getting aroused later on when he’s sharing a bed with Dean. And that brings up something else he hadn’t thought about.
With movies in mind, Dean reorganizes his DVD collection while he waits for the technician. There isn’t too much to do there, but a few have been placed in the boxes out of order and he fixes them. The DVD for

prefer taking the gifts route. That’s just too many unknown people for him to want to deal with all at once. He wouldn’t have the safety of the counter between him and them like he did at the Halloween party and that just doesn’t sit right with him. Besides, gifts would probably be cheaper for them than paying for dinner for everyone.
Castiel nods and gestures over his shoulder at Gabriel. “I’ll make sure that he has a pie ready for you.”
There might be a small problem with starting to read a new book in the late evening. The problem lies mostly with Dean and his inability to put down something good once he’s started it. And
“Just – um – just consider it thanks for the awesome coffee you give me, like, every other night, okay?” He shrugs and his smile is a little shaking. “Nothing weird about it.”
“Don’t be. That bit was entirely for her.” Cas shrugs and sits back so he can watch her smack the bow underneath the table.
There’s no room for argument in Cas’s tone, not that Dean would want to. “Lead the way.”
“In time.”

Any conversation they might have been having comes to a complete stop the moment Dean steps out of the bedroom. Two sets of surprised eyes turn on him and all he can do is manage a sheepish smile while trying to fix his sleep-rumbled clothes. “I – uh – I think I fell asleep.”

Once unwrapped, he discovers that the present is a battery operated toy that spins a stick in random circles at different speeds. At the end of the stick is a string that has both a ball and feather attached to it. Since it’s in a box, Nike shows no interest in it. Her eyes, however, are focused on the crinkled wrapping paper next to him. Castiel crumples it into a ball and tosses it across the floor. She’s off his lap and batting at it in an instant.
While he’s looking, his migration eventually leads him towards the station group where they’re just hanging out towards one corner by the counter and windows. All the tables that usually fill the floor are pushed up against the wall and out of the way. It opens up the whole café and even though it’s not

awake. There’s not a trace of sleepiness in his system and it’s been that way since he rolled out of bed half an hour ago. Hell, there’s even a goddamn bounce in his step as he heads over to the counter.
“Yeah, if I figured it out then they probably already have too.” His grin gets even stupider. “First it was Harrison Ford and now it’s my boss, huh?”
“Colour me impressed, Cas.” He looks at him and just
His hands come up to hold Castiel’s face between his palms. “What do you need, Cas?”
There’s a few beats of silence before Cas quietly asks another question. “Is everything alright?” There’s actual concern in his voice and it sends a weird little shiver down Dean’s spine.
With a muffled burp and a satisfied hum, Dean rocks back in his chair just enough to tilt it back onto two legs. He rubs his belly with both hands and turns a lopsided grin to the head of the table. “Thanks for lunch, Dad. That was delicious.”

On the plus side, at least Uriel doesn’t seem to give a shit about the lecture Bobby’s going to lay on him any moment now. He’s too busy with getting the binders down from the shelf above the desk because even good food and coffee isn’t enough to distract him from the fact that there’s paperwork to be done. Between everyone in this room, Uriel is the most professional and probably the best firefighter the station has. He can be overbearing and maybe a little too stoic for his own good, but he’s a good guy. Nick seems to think he’s fucking hilarious, but Dean hasn’t seen that side of him yet.
It takes a few minutes, but Castiel eventually breaks. He sighs loudly and rubs his mitten-covered hands over his face. “I don’t want Dean to have a crush on me.”
Castiel doesn’t wait for an answer. He’s already upstairs by the time Balthazar likely registers what he’s said. By that point, Castiel’s focus is already on the muffled meowing he can hear from the other side of his bedroom door. She seems just as happy to see him as he is to see her. When he opens his bedroom door, she comes bounding out to greet him. Immediately, the cat starts curling around his feet, mewling and purring loudly at him.

Cas’s eyebrows knit together in confusion, but he doesn’t question him. He steps into Dean’s arms again and gets his hands under his ass. One squeeze precedes him being lifted again, only this time it’s entirely off his feet. It puts Dean’s heart in his throat and a shiver in his bones. He pushes down on Cas’s shoulders to lift himself up just high enough that he can wrap legs around his waist. Cas adjusts to the new position easy as pie and it’s mind-boggling.
Balthazar opens his mouth and Dean knows the look in his eyes. He cuts him off with a shake of his head. “I don’t have any other information than that. I don’t even have an exact time for
They share one more kiss before Castiel turns to leave. Dean pats him on the behind and gives him a cheeky grin when he glares over his shoulder at him. He leans against the door frame, blows another kiss, and waves. “Love ya, babe! See you in the morning!”

and like hell if Dean is going to pass on an attempt to roll around in bed with Cas while they’re both dressed down to their underpants. Which is literally what happens the moment he throws Cas off of him.
“Sam Winchester?” This is very confusing and not at all what Dean expected to walk in on today. Should he be calling the cops on a stalker or something?
As soon as Cas is close enough, Dean reaches out to slide his fingers through his feathers. This is a relaxing thing for him and immediately Cas sags in his direction. He breathes a little sigh and his eyes flutter closed. Dean scoots closer, all but actually climbing into his lap, so he can get his hands to where they need to go. He sinks them into the downy feathers at the base of Cas’s wings and digs his fingers into the joints; rubbing and massaging as best as he can. This is the most sensitive parts of Cas’s wings and it always makes him shiver when they’re touched.
Again, Gabriel hums. This time more to himself than in amusement. He takes a step forward and snaps his fingers right in front of Dean’s face to get his attention. Dean blinks and tears his eyes from Castiel’s wings to look at him properly. “What?”
Castiel knows that he can’t keep this up forever. He can try, but eventually his body is going to give out. The Coven will realize that this is killing him and that even the reset of the stone sleep isn’t going to be able to save him. They won’t risk losing him, so what will they do? Will they ensure that he has nowhere to hide, or will they stop this farce entirely? Will they try and wait him out? Or should Castiel just try to end it all himself?
Castiel’s wings spread in surprise before drooping. “Why did you have to do that?” He sighs and looks down at Nike. “If she gets confetti in her poop, I’m going to put it in

She snorts and puts a few cloth bags on the couch behind his head. “I’m going to have to pass this time, sweetie. I’m just dropping this stuff off. It was on sale and I might have ‘accidentally’ bought too much.”

Oh, how interesting! Castiel leans forward slightly, excitement starting to stir in his chest. “Are you a writer?” Maybe he’s read some of his writing. If he has one of his books, what are the chances that he could get it signed?

up here. I think she’s going to be leaving soon.”
Castiel starts replaying the messages and closes his eyes to focus on Dean’s voice over the bubble of doubts threatening to burst in the back of his mind. He doesn’t want to think about how the FBI might end up selling off the café for them in a matter of weeks. He doesn’t want to think about how he might have to pick a new name soon, and that he might have to start witness protection all over again. While they did it before for ten years, Castiel is

“Dude, stop it.” Sam slaps his hand away but ducks his head all modestly. He loves the attention, even if his teenage sensibilities are demanding that he pretends like he doesn’t. “I’m eighteen now, Dean. You don’t need to do this for me.”
“Have a good weekend, Dean.” Cas dips his head in goodbye and turns away. “I’ll see you next time.”

His reward is a bitch-face on par with the Sam’s. Dean ignores it with a smile and slides the box down to her. The box for the tree is about as tall as Jo is, and it’s definitely bigger than Charlie. It’s shorter than him, but the tree itself is definitely taller than Dean is. There are two pieces inside the box and the tree is pretty much as high as their ceiling. When Dean Winchester does a Christmas tree, he goes
Dean’s jaw drops at the same time that his hand does, clearly surprised. He stares at Castiel, and then their hands, and back up at him again. “This – this is – What is

it this morning. He had Cas’s hands in his and held eye contact with him while the sun peeked over the horizon.
Sure enough, all he gets is a grin and the next present handed to him. The cat-papered present is from Nike, as he guessed. Unsurprisingly, it’s also a bag of coffee, though it’s a lighter roast than the one that Gabriel got. He puts that aside and, with his heart in his throat, turns to the big box waiting for him. Castiel tucks a leg underneath him and reaches for the card taped to the top of the box. The writing on the envelope isn’t familiar to him.
“I thought sucking was the point?” Castiel bites his bottom lip as he quirks an eyebrow.
“Your fangirls would

their victims if they need to. As far as Dean knows, he’s never actually used it. Benny’s a gentleman like that.
“Of course.” There isn’t much about that night that Castiel doesn’t remember. Rarely has anyone left such a memorable first impression as he did.
“Oh, yes!” She lights up and takes off towards the living room. “See ya later, guys!”
That slipped his mind too. Castiel waves his hand to dismiss it. “Stay with your family, Sam. I’ll arrange to have it covered.” Gabriel will happily cover it after knowing the situation.
Cas is probably in the back or in the bathroom or something, and Dean is more than happy to wait for him at the counter. What he finds there is almost enough to make him forget about Cas entirely because holy

He puts the driver’s license in the drawer and moves over to get a mug and pour some coffee. The last thing he expects is for Chuck to start laughing.

He scrubs both hands over his face before running them through his hair. Eventually he settles on squinting a Dean, though it’s really his memories that he’s scrutinizing. “We had sex?”
Mom grabs him for a quick kiss goodbye on the cheek before he gets too far. Dad settles for a wave and the pair head off down the parking lot towards his truck. Sam hangs back a bit and waits for them to get the engine going. He steps in to give Dean a quick hug, which is a little weird because he could have done that with their parents right there. But then Sam whispers in his ear and Dean immediately understands – and appreciates – why he hung back;
to fall asleep in the comfort of his own home and with his best friend next to him. He’s so zoned out, teetering on the edge of actually falling asleep, that he doesn’t even register that Dean has asked a question.

enjoying cleaning up after partially flooding their bathroom that time. It was a nightmare made entirely because he hadn’t put the curtain back into place when he stepped into the tub.
God, but he hopes that’s not true. That would mean that Cas is in danger and it’s making Dean dizzy just thinking about it. He can hardly even keep his voice steady when he speaks. “I’ll try and get a hold of Cas. If I learn anything, I’ll let you know.”
“Nope.” Dean shakes his head and leans away so he can mime zipping his lips. “Mum’s the word on

Some of Dean’s neighbours down the street are shoveling too and he gives them a wave before turning to gesture at the driveway. “How about you start on one end, I’ll start on the other, and we’ll meet in the middle?”

When the FBI did their investigation back then, all the crystals were accounted for. The Coven must have come back later to take it, sending in someone who hadn’t made the deal with the Demon – meaning they wouldn’t have set off the system. Then it was just a matter of time before the Coven got through the spells and gave themselves a little doggy door that could let them through the perimeter so they could conduct some investigations of their own. That’s probably when they eventually discovered Cas.
Castiel shoves the cart forward to hit him in the backside again, timing it just as he bends over to get a bag of rice. They share matching dirty looks, but Gabriel is the first to look away. He pulls the cart out of Castiel’s hands and drags it after him. Good. His hands need to be free for what he’s about to do next. Though he’s sorely tempted to cast a quick little spell that will knock a bag or two of Uncle Ben’s Rice-a-roni onto Gabriel’s head, Castiel instead pulls his phone out to send a quick text message to Dean.

“It’s after midnight.” Castiel smiles and deletes the message he had been typing. “Technically speaking, it’s boxing day now.”
“Good.” Gabriel perks up more with a smile. “Now put on some music. I’m going to get the rest of the stuff for the tree.”
. He definitely grabs a few pictures of that
“Don’t think I don’t know that you just put that in a slow cooker this morning.” Mom’s tone turns a little harder and Dean immediately knows he’s lost the battle. “That hardly counts as helping. I need your big muscles to mash potatoes, and the yams, and I need you to make sure the pie is up to your standards.”
Cas’s smile grows and he shakes his head. “Ah, you have a brother complex too, I see.”

him. Dean checks his watch because his weather app said the sunset was going to be at something like twenty after eight or something and it’s just a few minutes shy of that now.
Cas closes his laptop and a small smile spreads across his face. “Welcome back, Dean.” Oh God, he even remembered his name. “What can I get for you today? I’m afraid I haven’t memorized your order yet, but I’m sure I will if you keep coming back.”
It’s a little jarring to see one of those boxes here. Castiel hasn’t looked at any of that stuff since the FBI delivered it to them. He lowers himself to sit next to it and watches as Gabriel lifts the flaps out of the way. His feathers fan and puff at the contents. Of course he expected Christmas decorations, but what Castiel wasn’t prepared for is the wave of nostalgia at the sight of them. His chest is suddenly four sizes too small for his lungs and he can practically

The only thing that brings them to a hard stop is when they nearly roll right off the edge of the bed. By then, Dean is sweating and he can’t stop grinning. It’s been a long time since he’s gotten to wrestle with anyone, and this was pretty fun.
Castiel ignores him and turns away, scanning the room for the owner of the voice he’d heard – can still hear. He closes his eyes and focuses on Dean’s voice again. Yes, he’s definitely here, but not in this room because no one is talking in here. So, where is he? Why is his voice quieter out in this room than it was back in his cell?
Speaking of his Dad, he and Bobby walk past their booth right about then. Dad stops and knocks on the end of their table, looking pointedly at Dean. “You coming?”
angry. Though he can’t see it himself, this tensing and blur manifests externally in other ways – something that Gabriel must see now, as he takes a quick step back.
Dean sits between Sam and the cooler and reaches over to give Bones a good scratch behind the ear. “He knows he’s gotta get a head start or he’s not going to get anything because the sasquatch will inhale his food as soon as he gets it in his hands.”
gotta keep up the veggie intake to stay healthy.”
“No. This is your punishment for making me come along when I didn’t have to.” He already texted the picture to Gabriel, thus making it absolutely pointless for him to be here.
Out of curiosity and a little bit of suspicion, Castiel turns around. There are a few empty bottles of beer and one solitary glass of ice on the counter where he Dean had been sitting. Ash was obviously serving him and the waitresses while Castiel was busy talking. But how much did he drink? Was that glass for water or for some other alcoholic beverage? Has Ash cleared any away? Oh dear God, how much has Dean had to drink? Castiel quickly tries to mentally calculate how much Dean might have had to drink and can only come to the conclusion that he might very well be drunk. He’s never seen Dean like this before. Tipsy, but never

This year, Mom’s gonna get a bunch of R2D2 items. He’s her favourite little robot from the Star War franchise, so he might as well get her everything he can find with that rolling trash can on it - said with all the love in the world, of course. In this case, Mom is getting a measuring spoon set, a kitchen timer, an apron, and he adds the droid salt and pepper shakers for the hell of it. There’s just
Cas rolls his eyes in response, but the annoyed edge to it is cancelled out by a wince. His grip tightens on Dean’s hip. “Don’t – don’t do that again. Not yet.”
He takes a bite as Gabriel launches into a new line of questioning focused on asking how the café is doing. Castiel listens with half an ear, slowly but surely finishing off his plate while he thinks about all that he’s learned in the last few minutes. There are still more questions he wants to ask, but he has to get his thoughts in order first. He is not usually an impulsive person. He has a lot to consider before he can pose the next question he has.
“I – Yeah?” Dean nods as colour starts to creep up his neck. He does, however, manage to actually glance at Castiel even if only for a moment. “I mean – well – I, uh, I don’t work on Saturday.”
me? Is that really the best threat you can do, Cassie?”
to stop kissing him.
It’s a very tempting offer, but Castiel is almost certain that he won’t be able to accept. He opens his mouth to decline, but Charlie continues talking. “I think you’d be pretty good at it and you’d look great in some proper arm. Don’t you think, Dean? He had a very Aragorn-esque thing going on back there.”
early before their shift. The only time Dean can ever recall them actually meeting was the Halloween party, and that was forever ago.
“Come with me.” Dean grabs his hand and starts leading him around the side of the building.
“Well, now we know what you’re going to be doing all night.” He pats him on the shoulder and leans down until they’re eye to eye. “You’re going to have to figure out if you’re into Dean or not.” When Castiel shakes his head, mostly to keep from having to meet his stare, Gabriel yanks the toque off his head; jarring the glasses right off his nose. “Like it or not, Cassie, but this is something you’re not going to be able to run from. You’re going to have to talk to Dean about what happened eventually. It’s that or you’re both going to end up avoiding each other for the rest of your lives and you’re going to lose your third best friend.”

“Hey now.” Charlie drops onto the couch next to him and takes the paper pack back. “Don’t get your panties in a twist.”
Dean snores softly into his pillow and Castiel can’t help but smile. He crosses the room on silent feet to put Nike’s food down on her plastic feeding mat. She jumps out of her box and goes face first into the bowls, already noisily digging into her food. Her tail twitches back and forth excitedly and she starts purring as Castiel gives her a few scratches before standing up again. He leaves his duffle bag next to her for the time being.
Mom groans and pulls open the pantry. “I wish he would have told me! Now what in the world are we going to have tonight?”
A taxi is already waiting for them at the gate and they pile in as soon as they get there. Dean gives the driver an address to a shop in Canton, read from his phone. There’s a number saved next to the address and he presses dial while he and Cas buckle in.
Mom pipes up from the living room. “What about that new card game you bought, Sammy?”
There’s the soft sound of Cas taking a deep breath, and then Dean realizes that he basically dug himself a grave with that particular question. The next few minutes are filled with Cas naming every kind of tea that is considered to be

Well, he might as well get up and investigate that. Nike happily takes over the abandoned pillows as he swings his legs over the edge of the bed and stands up. Just in case she might be mad at him for not staying for some cuddles, Dean gives Nike a few pats on the head and a good scratch behind the ears. If it weren’t for his allergies, maybe he would actually consider getting a pet cat. Only as long as they’re as awesome a cat as Nike is.

The compliment earns him a bright smile and a flutter of her wings. She even has a bounce in her step as they head to the front together again.

While the signs should have been changed when the sun went down, he still always checks to make sure that

He doesn’t want to take baby steps, but he will. Because he has to.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m coming.” Dean takes the time to move the garbage and broom off into a corner before joining him. He slips under Castiel’s right wing and sits with his back against the head of the bed.
“Here!” Charlie slides two purple looking shots down in front of both of them. “Try one.”
him into it.
As Gabriel heads into the kitchen, Nike takes his place and starts butting her head against the top of Castiel’s while he does his push ups. She gets under his face when he pushes up and rubs her back against his nose, purring loudly as she attempts to smother him with her bulk of fur. This level of affection means that she’s about ready for bed. By the clock alone, Castiel knows he has a good half an hour or so before the sun, so he wants to finish with his workout and take a shower before then. No cat and no brother will be able to distract him from that.
“Oh my
Maybe it’s his imagination, maybe it’s the beer, but Dean is almost positive that Cas leans into side. “That is an acceptable alternative. Thank you.”

get used to it if they make this a regular thing. It’s different, but not difficult. And it’s really neat to see how the muscles in Cas’s stomach flex, or how his mouth falls open when he gasps. Dean has to lean out of the kisses just to watch him for the too short period before Cas is shuddering and coming too. The grip he has on Dean’s arms is hard enough to bruise – and it does, as they later discover.

So now, not only would the Fae not do anything to help Cas, they’re also playing games with him? Nope. No sirree. Dean isn’t going to let this fucker have fun with him like that. Dean shakes his head and turns to hand the drinks off to Sam. No sooner has he done so does Balthazar take them back and hand them over again.
Any need to think further on the matter becomes a moot point when they reach the clearing with the tower. Dean loves the old tower. It’s made of rocks from stone walls and cement, and it took fifteen years to be built. In fact, he’s pretty sure it’s been a hundred years since construction on it was started. And the best thing is, it’s still a functioning observatory. The clearing here isn’t

than okay with that!” Dean holds up both hands in innocence. “I mean, I know that we’re not actually dating and I don’t expect anything of this, but if you want to call it a date, then I’m okay with that too.”
The only safety measure Dean has to keep that from happening is that he’s actually not supposed to drink too much tonight anyways. He’ll be going into the party with a full stomach and he’ll space each beer with a glass of water and a snack. By this point, he’s a veteran at staving off the drunk. It’s been a long damn time since he’s had an actual hangover, and that’s all because he learned the ways and he knows his limits. The only thing he’ll really let himself have tonight is the equivalent of a light buzz.

They saw each other earlier in the night when Dean came in for his late night coffee run. Castiel rolls his eyes and huffs a quiet laugh under his breath. It’s this adorably playful side to Dean that caught his eye in the first place, and he hopes that he never loses it. He takes a sip of his tea and smiles as Dean drops into the seat next to him; immediately reaching over to scratch Nike behind the ears.

adorable for him. Oh, that’s a first. When was the last time Castiel ever thought that someone was adorable? If Dean continues to be so flustered and awkward around him, he might very well become Castiel’s favourite customer. He was very friendly last time and that’s just the kind of customer that Castiel enjoys serving.

With a squeak of surprise, he goes to his hands and knees in the snow. “Aw, c’mon, Cas!”
“Oh!” Cas finally looks like he understands, and that light of understanding falls right into a pout of disappointment. “We don’t have one of those. Not even for the one that we put together upstairs.”
That’s why he made sure his soldiers had their best equipment and double the number of fighters that should be in the caravan. Chris, the Solarite King, might have also equipped his well, but he knows he was only supposed to send a handful of soldiers to escort his court noble. Dean has no idea who Chris will have chosen as the noble, but they’re supposed to be carrying information about the whereabouts of the good Queen of Moondoor.
The only thing keeping him from readily accepting the bottom position is just how hot under the collar he gets when he thinks about topping Dean. Whether he imagines it as fast, slow, gentle, or hard, all he knows is that he
Honestly, Dean doesn’t even know how they managed to pass the inspections. Unless they don’t own the building. If they’re just renting, then the landlords could have just slipped up on that. Either way, it makes him wonder what else might have been looked over in the original inspections. He’s going to have to talk to Cas about that too and get the low down on everything.
After a moment of silence, Dean’s fingers are in his feathers again. They search out the gland on their own and he touches it gently, sizing it out by touch. “And you preen all by yourself now?”
Good point. Dean should know better than that. They literally went over that the night they celebrated his birthday. “Will you tell me what it is if the wish comes true?”

, Cas!” Dean kisses him soundly several times before he pulls back with a laugh.
A soft sigh cuts Dean’s thoughts off. “No, it’s just us. We have no other relatives. And I’m not sure about the menu. I’ll need to ask Gabriel about it. I’ll let you know if we’re doing anything special.”
A thoughtful look passes over Gabriel’s face and he pulls a pad of paper out from under the counter. “That probably means fundraisers and the like, huh? Gotta get them a roof over their heads, clothes, and food while their insurance companies quibble over the final details.” He starts jotting down some notes in a messy chicken scratch that Dean can’t read upside down. “We’ll offer to cater the fundraisers and I’ll check our budget to see if we can’t find a little something to donate too.”
. Half of him wishes he’d taken a kiss, because that’s probably the only time Cas ever would have kissed him, but even just

“That was my plan, yeah. It’s why I needed the coffee. Otherwise I’d be face down on your floor righ– Whoa!” Dean gets cut off by his shirt being quickly and unceremoniously pulled over his head.

’ before turning his attention back to Ellen.
Dean laughs and holds out the beer. “You’re right on the money, Cas. How come you’re on foot?”
Balthazar pouts, but does as he’s told. The kick is probably the only thing keeping his mouth shut. As soon as he’s gone, Dean’s heart decides to start beating properly again.
“Well, you’ve never really fought with me like this before.” Dad scrubs a hand through his hair and fixes Dean with a wry quirk of his eyebrow. “I thought you’d be crawling back all apologetic in a day or two. When you didn’t, Mary really beat it into my head that you’re more important than –” He stops only to make a vague gestures that Dean assumes is supposed to mean

With a sigh, he picks up a slice of toast to nibble on. At the very least it might help to settle his stomach. Even the bacon isn’t very appetizing to him right now. A soft paw on his arm reminds him that there is someone else in the room who would happily eat it for him. Nike has taken up residence on the chair next to him, her blue eyes wide and bright as she watches each pathetic bite that he brings to his lips. She opens her mouth in a silent plea and of course he can’t resist her when she looks so sweet. When he gives her some of the bacon, Nike rewards him with a delighted chirrup.
Dean puts the laptop aside and slides down the bed to stretch out. He pushes the blankets aside in the process and Nike gives a soft

Just shut up and let me say this one thing before I leave because you’re starting to irritate me with all this.” Castiel lifts his head with a glare, but it gets shrugged off. “I’m going to say one thing and one thing only. If Dean flirted with you any harder, then
Why wasn’t he anxious about this when he was fingering Dean? Was he just that focused on watching what he was doing? Maybe he was too focused to worry about any of the ickier aspects of anal sex. But that does beg the question; did Dean have these same worries? It’s possible that he didn’t. He did say that he was used to teasing himself down there, after all.
“O-oh.” His cheeks go pink and Cas drops the crane on the bookcase. Almost right away he picks it up again to put it back in place. “So you – you really
The guy steps away from the tree and walks over to them with a slight limp. He seems to be in his late fifties, maybe even early sixties, with dark skin, white hair, and a salt-and-pepper beard. His face is the kind of old man face that makes you wanna trust him right from the get go. Dean is still on edge though and he always will be with strangers around Cas.
A meow from by his feet comes as a perfect distraction. Dean looks down to find Cas’s found cat rubbing sniffing at his shoe. “Hey, fluffy.” He crouches to give her a few good scratches behind the ear now that he doesn’t get the sniffles here. “Looks like no one’s come by for you yet, huh?”
“Since when?” Castiel hands the salad bowl across the table. “An extra serving of greens isn’t going to make up for that candy you ate earlier.”
The pair are already seated at the dining table in the midst of a card game. Charlie flashes him a bright smile. “Hiya, Cas.” Her smile turns devious when she looks back to Jo. “Go Fish, bitch.”
This is actually the first time Dean has ever seen him look so serious. He’s got the charming smile and wicked wit that keeps the customers happy, but he’s not goofing off and that’s actually surprising. Dean steps into place behind the two people already waiting in line at the counter. Three of the tables in the place already have a handful of people sitting at them and Dean checks them out to see if he knows anyone, just because he can. A couple faces are familiar, but he can’t put names to them.
Though his heart is racing, Castiel forces himself to speak. “Do you remember what happened when we left the Roadhouse?”
“It felt good without it.” Dean laughs and presses a kiss to his chest. “And I wasn’t really capable of telling you anything in the middle of it, y’know? We’ll definitely try it with me next time, though.”
Those too-blue eyes stay fixed on his; still wide and captivating. Cas opens his mouth and closes it a few times before he settles on just nodding. He blinks a few times and each one leaves his eyes a little more closed until they stay closed completely. Cas leans into Dean a little more, stepping in and forcing them to readjust how they’re standing. It’s his own self-control that keeps his hands on Cas’s hips, but the hands are his shoulders are gone. They’ve been replaced by Cas’s arms and they rest heavily on them, his fingers now trailing between Dean’s shoulder blades.

“Back already?” Tessa actually looks surprised when he walks in again. “Did you forget something?”

that they should be worried about.
to be happy that Cas is okay and that he’s alive out there with Gabriel and Nike, getting the help he needs while he’s recovering from all the bullshit he was put through. It’s just hard when he wants to be there for him.
As soon as they have a clear view of the Fae in question, Dean points her out and Charlie’s jaw drops. That’s as good an answer as any and he tries hard not to laugh about it – particularly because that’s the same expression he had when they picked Cas up.
“If you say so.” There’s a little smile on Cas’s lips that looks like it’s permanently engraved there, but he still shakes his head. “Now, I believe you were going to show me how to carve these?”
Crap. Now that he
at it. But Dean has no practice in this either. Does that mean that he has the same apprehensions? If he does, he’s certainly not showing it. Dean seems incredibly calm as he starts undoing the belt he’d put on Castiel only a few minutes ago.
He knows they moved to get Cas away from such strong sun, but would they have really moved if Gabe had some kind of deep relationship with anyone down there? Maybe, maybe not. “Either way, you’re both big boys now, aren’t you? Gabe doesn’t have to watch after you anymore. There’s nothing stopping him from going out to get some booty if he wants it.”
The third sense is smell. Castiel takes note of laundry detergent from the freshly washed sheets under him. There’s also a hint of coconut and vanilla on damp air, probably a body wash or shampoo from someone taking a recent shower. Under it all, there’s another scent that he recognizes and Castiel takes another deep breath, focusing on it.
“We have the whole damn day and if you don’t want me to land on your head when I fall,
With a sigh, Dean melts into him. He takes a deep breath and hums against the side of Castiel’s neck. “Is everything okay now?”
raunchy with both his parents playing too.
Of course Dad doesn’t look even the slightest bit convinced. He shakes his head and shrugs. “Well, whatever. I still think you’re out of your fucking mind to date a Creature. I had hoped that you would’ve learned better after all I’ve taught you about Creatures.”
James wracks his brain to try and figure out what could have been the problem. It takes him a few moments before it occurs to him. There were no lights on in the house. Mother would have turned on at least one light on her way to get him. Was the power out? It must have been. He’s fairly certain that the nightlight in the hallway was also off. The garage door has a back up battery, so it wouldn’t have been  affected by something like a blackout.

He barrels straight into the mess of bodies blocking the door from him, shoving and throwing them aside as needed. At least one falls out the doorway in the process, and Castiel doesn’t care. He has to get outside. He
It might be his imagination, but he’s pretty sure a little bit of colour fills Cas’s cheeks. He takes the butterfly gently and cradles it in his hands; the softest smile slipping across his lips. “It’s lovely, Dean. Thank you.”

That’s a very good point. “Are you advocating that she
Being Human would mean that he wouldn’t have to worry about the Witches hunting and killing him for the ingredients they could get from his body. If he were Human right now, Castiel could already be dating Dean. Instead of leaving with a wave, Dean could have kissed him goodbye. Or, instead of going home after his shift in the morning, he could have just come here so they could snuggle together until they fell asleep. They could leave the window open and Castiel could actually enjoy the heat of the sun while they slept.
Castiel holds up a hand and Dean’s jaw snaps shut. “I suppose I did gloss over all of that earlier.” He fixes him with a sheepish smile. “But I can and
Aw, that’s sweet. Cas is such a good guy and Dean hums happily. “I’d never f’get hanging with you, Cas.”
“Yes, I’m back.”
“They have a

He nods with a smile. “Thanks to Gabriel. He saw how depressed I was and convinced our handler to have them shared with me.”
To his great surprise, the fields surrounding the tower are actually
“Probably.” Dean rubs a hand over his face again and sits up. “But I don’t touch their shit. We have cupboards marked for each of us. We’re not allowed to take food or anything from the cupboards that don’t belong to us. If it’s in the pantry, then it would be okay.”
Castiel swallows back the urge to groan. “I was thinking of the

in the morning. It’s the same café, same coffee, but different names.”
By some miracle of God, by the time six o’clock rolls around, he hasn’t heard a peep from the kitchen. It’s merely a promise from something worse to come, but there’s nothing Castiel can do about it. He might be teased or pranked or any number of things. It’s not like Gabriel has retaliated yet for the bucket of water Castiel had left for him last week. That’s still hanging above his head like the guillotine blade waiting to drop. In this case, it’ll likely explode into confetti after nearly giving Castiel a heart attack. That seems to be Gabriel’s modus operandi and it doesn’t help that Balthazar apparently shares the same preferences as him.
“I never went to high school.” Castiel was home schooled since he was thirteen years old. Since he had nothing better to do, he actually ‘
That seems to cool Nick off pretty quick. He goes a little red in the face and slinks off to sit on the couch. Meg pats him on the shoulder, but she’s grinning like an idiot. It doesn’t matter who’s getting in trouble, she’s going to enjoy it just as long as it isn’t her. She gets up to join Dean at the table and takes one of the macarons while she gets started on her own paperwork. Uriel is already silently starting on his after making the logical decision to stay the hell out of everything.
He’s practically at Dean’s driveway when he notices that the homeowner himself is sitting on the porch. Dean is kicked back in one of the chairs with his feet up on the railing while playing a handheld game, by the sound of it. He looks up as Castiel starts up the driveway and stands up with a smile. It makes his heart skip a beat and the best he can do is lift his hand in a small wave. Dean meets him at the door to let him in.
in a hospital room – not that he had much doubts about that. He is surprised, however, to find that it’s a private room. The bed faces a single door in a wall of windows. The blinds are down but not closed and he can see two suited figures on the other side of the glass, one standing on either side of the closed door. There are a handful of chairs in the room, two of which are in use by the bed and a few more against the same wall as the door.
“Thanks.” He nods and starts snacking. “Make sure you take your stuff.”
that’s Cas sitting over on that bench.”
Charlie and Gilda brush past, neither one really noticing who they’re walking by, as they make their way towards the stairs. Dean watches after them until they’re out of sight. He’s can’t help grinning at how
Slowly, he closes the door and stares at it for a moment. Castiel's head won't stop spinning and he turns to lean against the door. There's two and a half weeks between now and New Years. That's two and a half weeks for him to get up the courage to decide on an answer. His first and immediate response is
Now it’s time to take his mind off that and Castiel starts with another question that has been bothering him.

here, Cassie.” Desperation is starting to creep into Gabriel’s voice. He wants to win this argument so badly, but it’s not going to happen. Nothing is going to be able to change Castiel’s mind on this.
Dean’s eyes grow wide and he’s on his knees in an instant, sending Nike skittering away. “You serious? You really wanna join in?”
Gabriel comes over to sit next to Castiel as he picks up the bag, making sure that his towel covers everything it’s supposed to. “What is it?”
Just as he starts his stretching, Gabriel clears his throat loudly. “So, what’s this about leaving me alone on Valentine’s Day?”
Yeah, there’s a little twinge of disappointment buried deep in Dean’s chest, but he ignores it in favour of laughing. “A few drinks might help ease your nerves, but you don’t

Some of the Casters gather in a group and in a quick moment have the whole area lit up as if it were a bright sunny day. Glowing orbs of light float above everyone’s head and Dean squints at them. Would they be able to replicate sunlight enough that they could force Cas into his stone sleep early? At least then he wouldn’t have to suffer until sunrise.
“Actually, Sammy started a new job yesterday. It’s killing me that I haven’t had the chance to go in and check on him to see how he’s doing with his first job.” Dean sighs and stuffs his hands in his pockets. He just has to tough it out until Saturday. That’s when he’ll be able to see him at work.
“Gotta agree with you there.” Jess slides him a medium coffee before tending to the dwindling supply of croissants. “He’s pretty punctual. Especially on the weekends.”
Castiel rolls his eyes and brushes past him, making sure to cuff him with a wing on his way past. “I know. I’m the worst.” He stops at his bedroom door and turns back to a pout, ignoring it. “The weather report said it’s supposed to rain this afternoon. Can you bring Harold down from the garden upstairs before then? Give him what sun there is in the morning, but don’t let him drown in the rain.”

How can he answer him when he can barely breathe? Castiel’s whole body trembles with every breath and all he can do is shake his head slowly. Eventually, Gabriel is the one who has to guide his head up until he can see his face. He even pulls Castiel’s glasses off and sets them aside. With gentle hands, Gabriel pets his hair and makes soft hushing noises until a calm finally starts to set in. Of course, Castiel doesn’t miss how he pauses to grip the crystal he wears too.

Sam rolls his eyes and turns to face the girl. “Tessa, is there anything else I should do before I go?”
After a moment, Cas sighs and steps out of the hug. His nose crinkles and he points towards the bathroom. “You stink.”
irks something deep in Castiel’s gut and he’s not entirely sure why. He disregards it after reading Gabriel’s next message.
easy for him to use their handler’s e-mail account to send Dean a quick update, he knows that it would never reach him. Everything that gets sent from this laptop is first reviewed by the tech division. They would never allow any correspondence to anyone back home to get through. Despite that, the urge to contact him is
Truth be told, Dean is pretty done with his things too. If he wants, he can always come out and fix them up later today or on Sunday before Cas comes over. It’s possible that Cas might want to fix it up himself. This has all been built to Winchester standard, and the Novak clan might have a methods of their own.
He runs his hands up and down Cas’s back, pressing his fingers in along his spine and taking the time to massage gently at the base of his wings. Dean keeps it up until the body above him relaxes; until it stops trembling and the harsh gasps for air even out. It’s the only thing he
He shrugs and starts patting at pockets to find his wallet. “Nah, I still crave the caffeine boost. Just give me something like a mocha frappuccino or whatever bullshit froo-froo thing is sweet. Surprise me.”
“If you insist.” Honestly, Castiel would have liked to continue with this so-called small talk. There’s something about talking with Dean that feels more natural than when he talks with his employees. It’s nice, but Castiel also understands that Dean is technically on break and he shouldn’t be away from the fire hall for too long.
Except – Maybe this isn’t as bad as he thought it would be? Maybe Dean going to the roof today is a blessing in disguise? If Dean knew that he was a Gargoyle – If he figured it out on his own – then all Castiel would have to do is explain the situation. He could tell him about all the risks about being involved with him and, once he knows
With a sigh, Dean puts the glasses down and flops back on the bed. It’s pretty damn comfortable and he hums to himself as he wiggles back to get his feet off the ground. He stares at the ceiling, watching the little rectangle of sun being reflected to the ceiling by something in the room. He washes it shimmer for a few minutes, wondering if Cas has ever seen something like this.

Every time Castiel has come over, one of the first things Dean offers is something to drink or eat. He’s such a gracious host. “Not right now, thank you.”
It’s ass o’clock in the morning and Dean unfortunately doesn’t get to go home to sleep. He ducks out and locks the door behind him. Now he gets to head home and help Charlie load up the last of their stuff into the truck. They filled the Impala with as much as Dean was comfortable putting in it. Once that’s all done, they’re grabbing coffee at the café and heading off to the park for the long, fun filled week ahead. Even though he won’t be seeing a lot of Cas during it, Dean can’t
less than Castiel did him. He wiggles his hips and frowns at the feeling. When is it supposed to start feeling good? This might be an inappropriate time to think it, but it really just feels like he kind of has to go to the bathroom – but not really.
She puts the tray and clothes on the table and starts to tidy up. He watches her clean, rather than get any closer by going to the table. If Renee notices, she doesn’t show it. First she shakes out the blanket and pillow, then uses the broom to sweep any of the dust and shards of stone off the rest of the bed. The stone is useless to them once he’s woken up, but at least they insist on keeping his space clean. He should be thankful, but he still hates them. So really, he

Cas folds forward to kiss him, sighing against his lips and sinking his fingers into his hair. With some effort, Dean makes him sit back again. “You have to listen to me right now.” He waits until Cas nods to show that he’s actually paying attention. “Okay. If you don’t like it, or if it doesn’t feel good, I
“See you later, Cas.” He shoves his hands in his pockets again and heads downstairs before anything else will distract him.
. He doesn’t really get how that’s possible, given that he is refusing to let himself shop in the first place. Even then, Castiel hasn’t really ever been romantically or sexually attracted to anyone. That’s likely because he hasn’t let himself get close enough to anyone to be able to feel that for them. In Miami, he was home schooled to minimize how many people he would meet with. It’s only in the last three years that he’s really been out and about with actual
A blush fills Sam’s face and he ducks his head, looking far too please with himself. His crush on Jess is cute and Castiel hopes that things go well for the both of them. He’s fairly certain that Jess returns his feelings somewhat. At least she has never said anything to come off as sounding like she didn’t like Sam.
“It’s okay.” The voice is muffled through the suit, but still foreign to him. They approach with their hands up. “You’re going to be okay, Castiel. We’re going to get you out of here.”

Cas doesn’t even hesitate to nod. “That would be because I run a business.” He taps the display case again. “And I do enjoy peddling my brother’s baking. It’s quite good, if I do say so myself.”
This time around, Keith isn’t staying with them. There are a number of other agents living in this building, but they didn’t deem it quite necessary to have one staying in the same apartment. That said, Keith still drops by at least once a week, usually the day following when Castiel’s therapist comes over to have their hour long
start feeling good. This is definitely different than fingering, and Dean is still torn on which he likes best, but he’s quickly starting to warm up to this.
“Since, uh, forever. I guess.” He shrugs and takes one of the medals off its stand. “I started in middle school and did it all through high school too. The only reason I stopped was because I started the program to be a firefighter.”
Dean in whatever way he can have him. Picturing it again causes his flagging erection to give an interested twitch. Maybe he

A high-pitched whine against his shoulder brings Dean back to the task at hand, quite literally. Cas’s hips are rolling again and his wings are slowly twitching back up. “Feels good, Cas?” He hums and spreads his fingers slightly, testing if he’s ready.
without a care in the world. It definitely helps that he did pretty much all his weekend chores yesterday while waiting for the technician.
Castiel fidgets for a few moments, deliberating if he should or shouldn’t show him. But this whole conversation is about telling the truth. He doesn’t want to hide anything from Dean anymore. Not even this. With that in mind, Castiel folds an arm up behind his back until he can feel the downy feathers near the base of his wings.

not feeling it right now. Though that could be because he’s only got a couple hours of sleep under his belt. It would be better if he could manage to go back to sleep, But that feels more than a little bit impossible at the moment and he groans, dropping his head into his hands.

“You had better!” Her tone perks up noticeably. “Dinner is at six thirty and your dad is already starting to get
With some effort, Castiel forces himself to focus on nothing more than his wish to live peacefully here in Montpelier with Gabriel. He doesn’t want to have to worry about another Witch messing up his life every again. That’s his wish and he keeps that in the forefront of his mind while he refolds the crane until it’s perfect. It’s hard, but he does his best not to think about the firefighters again while he finishes the last of the cranes and carefully strings them up for hanging.
it and he loves his family. They’re more than enough for him. He doesn’t even feel very bad about being separated from society like they are. If it’s so great, then why does he need to hide what he is? As far as he’s concerned, he doesn’t need anything other than their little family. Nothing could be greater than them and he doesn’t see how anything else could make him happier.
Gabriel raises an eyebrow, but otherwise he has no other response. He does, however, glance at Keith to see
Castiel opens his eyes and a familiar face swims into view. His next breath catches in his throat, but – No, that can’t be Gabriel. He would never leave the house with his hair in such a mess. And he has way too much facial hair – the bags under his eyes too heavy. Gabriel can’t be
“No, Gabriel. I want answers.”
Thank you, Mom, for asking the one question that Dean has been pointedly ignoring. It’s been sitting on the edge of his mind, but he didn’t want to think about it.
“Mom, Dad, this is Jess. She works at the café with me.” Sam basically elbows Dean out of the way to make room for the two of them. “Jess, this is my Mom; Mary, and my dad; John.”
Dean doesn’t even bother looking down at them while he picks the lightest of the bins to start with and slides it off one of its supporting beams.  He takes a moment to pop the top on it and check inside to make sure that it’s exactly what he wants. Of course it is, because everything has his nice chalk labels on it, but he’s delighted by what he finds. Right there on the top is his favourite Santa hat and Dean pulls it out to put on. The springy red top wobbles and feels a little weird at first, but he likes it.
“Of course, baby.” She stands up and leans over to kiss his forehead. Despite her words, she still lingers at the door a moment longer than necessary before stepping out into the hall.
To their surprise, the Impala is actually parked in front of the café when they get there. Dean pats it on the trunk and sighs. “I guess we took longer to walk than I thought we would.”
There’s more emotion in Dean’s voice than Castiel has ever heard from him and it makes his heart lurch sharply in his chest. He doesn’t even have words for how badly he missed him, or count how many times he thought about him. Castiel twists his fingers in Dean’s shirt and draws him back into the kiss, hating that his body is betraying him and getting hard at these gentle touches. His mind is starting to glaze over again and he

Kudos to Cas for actually noticing. They haven’t known each other that long, but even Dean can tell that he’s not always quick on the uptake when it comes to noticing shit about other people. It’s even enough to make Dean crack a bit of a smile while he types out his answer.
While Cas roots through the fridge, Dean ducks past Gabriel with a muttered command to
kind of attention. The less Dean looks at him with an eye of attraction, the better.
Dean leans his head back against the door and rubs Cas’s back with his free hand. He holds the other out and away from the both of them. If he’s lucky, he might be able to make it through this hug without spilling it. This is the only thing that’s going to keep him awake for the next hour, so he’d better keep it safe while he can.
“Gosh you’re cute when you’re grouchy.” Dean laughs and sits up. He swings his legs off the bed and stretches his arms above his head. “I guess you shouldn’t have stayed up so late reading, huh?”
He can’t help staring as Cas fumbles with rolling a condom on. This is more daunting than he thought it would be now that he’s literally minutes, possibly
“So, Sammy, what are your plans for University?” That’s a sure fire way to take the wind out of his sails.
Even talking with his friends is just to bide his time. Cas is busy with a whole bunch of customers and Dean doesn’t want to just walk over and start talking to him. It looks like he might not even get the chance to have a proper conversation with Cas tonight, if only because of all the customers. That’s kinda shitty, but Dean should have expected it. Didn’t Cas say that he was going to stick behind the counter all night? He’s not one for big parties like this.
if it’s still snowing like this.”
Dean glances around the café to see how business is going. He can’t remember ever being in at this time of night, but business seems to be good. Tessa is moving around the café to wipe down the counter and tables while some people pack up to leave. Half the tables have people sitting at them, either to read on their own or in groups of two or three and playing some board games.
win.”
After a few moments, Cas breathes out a long, slow sigh and puts the crane down in line with the others. “There we go.”
“Depends on how hot it is in your bedroom.” Dean hums and drums his fingers on his shoulders. “I’m fine with pajamas if it’s cool in there. If it’s warm, then I’ll downgrade to a t-shirt and my underpants. And if it’s too damn hot, then I’ll be going to underwear only.”

, though only slightly, while he sews the cranes together. His face feels far hotter than necessary and there’s a lump risen in his throat that he’s certain is his heart’s new home. The damn thing has gone and relocated without his permission and it’s only a matter of time before he dies because of it. When Gabriel finds his body in the morning, he had better have Castiel’s cause of death listed as
A blush burns in his cheeks, but this time it’s more happiness than it is embarrassment. Dean ducks his head and turns to unlock the door. “Love you too, Mom.” He ducks out before things start to get really sappy. He knows his Mom and it’s definitely possible. She knows it too, which is why her laughter follows him out.
Cas hums and sits back down on his stool, dragging over a new origami sheet. “How about I average for half past six? I’ll make sure to have a light breakfast when I wake up with the sunset. Likely around four o’clock, or so.”
The only way that Castiel
Castiel swivels from side to side on his stool, watching as Gabriel rolls out the dough that will become the crust of the pie. He does it with such ease that Castiel is almost jealous of it. If he had any interest in trying his hand at baking, he might be. Luckily, while Gabriel’s strength is with his baking, Castiel’s is with the more savoury aspect of cooking. He’s got several recipes filed away that taste exceptionally good. Sadly, the only ones who have ever tasted his cooking are in the room right now.
Castiel nods and takes a deep breath. “And if we’re going to be –” He gestures between the two of them. “Well, I want to be
Dean squints at him with all manner of suspicion, but does as he’s told. The moment the ball hits the ground, there’s a poof of smoke and a bang like a firecracker that has them both jumping in surprise. They take a step back together, their eyes on what is now nothing more than a pile of coloured ash on the floor. Dean sucks in a sharp gasp and grabs Castiel’s arm with both hands as multiple tendrils made up of thousands of twinkling lights start to weave up and out of the ash.
of what might have happened to him. It’s really the worst way to spend his time, and Cas wouldn’t want him to be like this all the time. He’d want Dean to miss him a bit, but he’d probably want him to move on. He’d want him to keep living his life as if Cas was never here in the first place. That’s what Dean wants to do, eventually, but he’s not capable of that – at least not right now.
Castiel slams the freezer door, finally finished with the cleaning. “
Cas goes still the moment Dean clamps a hand down on his wrist. He looks up and his forehead crinkles in concern. “Does it hurt?”
“I look forward to it.” Cas lifts a hand in a wave before he starts trying to thread the needle.

of experience with silence. His safety – and Gabriel’s – is too important for him to just go about spewing information everywhere.
Sometimes, when his strength wanes and his mind wanders into fantasy, Castiel finds himself imagining what it would be like to have a breakfast ready for Dean whenever he finishes working at the station. He could just come over when his shift is done and they could eat together before going to bed. They could cuddle and spoon and talk softly with each other until they fall asleep. This fantasy world of his is just so very nice and sometimes Castiel gets a little too lost in it for his own good.
He shuts that thought down immediately.
’. “Do you have a preference?”
Cas sends an emoji rolling it’s eyes and Dean knows he’s probably doing that on the other end of this conversation.

that Cas did, but this time it’s followed up with laughter.
but he – he hadn’t. Castiel chickened out. Because – and this feels so
Dean nods again and flashing a smile at him. “Since you don’t have any pie, that’s going to have to do.”
“Bugs, Cassie.” Gabriel reaches over to shove at his shoulder.
Sam is waiting for him by the exit from arrivals. He looks like an excited puppy; bouncing on his heels and standing on his tiptoes to try and see over the crowd – as if he can’t already do that since he’s a thousand feet tall. A bright smile lights up his face when he sees Dean, but he waits where he is so he doesn’t get in the way of everyone else coming through the exit. Dean trudges over to him and slumps into a hug, only slightly happy to finally be home.
She turns to him with a sly smile and a wink. “Perhaps.” She shrugs and falls into a defensive stance to try and block Richard from getting to the hoop with the ball he caught. “It depends how long his business took. You know he was only in town to drop off and pick up all his stuff with Mr. Montagne.”
sound good, Dean has something else in mind. “Try again.”
. It’s start to get to the point where Charlie has been dropping hints about some of Gilda’s non-Fae friends that he might like. She’s been casually mentioning it in every other conversation and Dean has pointedly
That’s not the answer Dean was expecting. And he also doesn’t like the way that Cas’s shoulders tense up a little more. These are apparently a line of questions that he doesn’t like too much. Alright then, time to change the subject. But it shouldn’t be too far off from what they’re talking about, otherwise it’s going to be obvious that he’s trying to change the subject and that isn’t going to help anything.
“That we know of? Four. One of them being Castiel’s dad.” Keith’s mouth draws into a grim line. “An average sized adult Gargoyle would be enough powder to last just the two of them for a hundred years,
Shit. Dean hums and taps the base of his empty bottle on the table. A Fae would be a hard mark for Charlie. But from what he can see, this Fae is totally her type. Well, it can’t hurt to at least
“They
you’ve opened the present.”
This has to be too good to be true. Did he really just ensure both Gabriel and Dean’s safety? Yes, he’s going to be walking towards certain death, but at least they’ll be safe. It’s something. It’s a start. Maybe he can try and make a break for it at some point while they’re on route to wherever they’re planning on taking him? If he can make a break for it, or cause a scene, someone might see it and report it to the proper authorities. The FBI could track him then –
And there’s her answer, as it’s been since the very first day they joined the local LARP group. Ah, nostalgia. Their friendship is fucking fantastic and he wouldn’t change a thing about it.
say anything!” He throws another suspicious look over his shoulder. “Have you told Gilda? You better not have!”
upset by the game. Maybe Cas is more worried about doing a good job with his first time topping. God knows that Dean had those very same worries the first time he had sex. Depending on the position, being top can be a lot of work, and Dean is so not sure that he’s going to be able to ride dick for his first time. Once he’s used to taking a cock up his ass,

"I'm surprised you even have any with the amount of sugar that you eat." Castiel throws him a smug grin the next time he sits ups and touches his elbows to his knees.
“Sorry, Jo.”
Nike is already making herself comfortable at the foot of the bed. Castiel, on the other hand, shifts on his feet while he stands opposite of Dean. “I’ve never done this before.”
The shadow of his conscious is almost a physical weight on his shoulders now. All he wanted to be was friends with Dean. He didn’t plan for things to develop like this. He didn’t

Nobody, not even his own dad, is allowed to insult Dean’s mom in his own home. He’s across the dining room and in his dad’s face in an instant. “Don’t you
When the pair get close enough, Castiel can see that the iris of the man’s eyes are red. The woman’s no longer glow purple and he briefly wonders if that only happens when they’re using magic. But then what magic is the man using right now? Unless – is he somehow blocking the crystals? Or is that weird bubble that was hiding them before still in effect somehow? He wants to ask, but he can’t. His mouth won’t work and the only sound he seems capable of making is a pitched rumble deep in his throat.
The pout returns, but Dean ignores it in favour of wiggling down the couch to line them up a little better. He lifts his head to kiss Cas softly; sucking lightly at his bottom lip until that pout fades away. Cas’s eyes flutter shut and his hands curls into fists against where they’re resting against his chest. There’s a low rumble of a noise in his throat and Dean is almost positive that it’s either a purr or a growl. Whatever it is, he likes it and he wants to get Cas to make more of those sounds.
. There Cas is. The image is grainy and not perfect, but Dean would recognize him even if he was nothing more than a pixelated blob.

Damn. “You think I’m trying to hit on him using your baking skills.” There’s no question in there. It’s a fact that Castiel was trying so very hard to avoid entirely.
Hopefully the movie will put his mind at ease. It feels like someone took a pencil and scribbled a mess in the back of his mind. All his feelings and thoughts on what happened tonight have jumbled together; tripping over one another in their attempt to be what he focuses on first. If Castiel is lucky, this Friday night will be a quiet one and he’ll be able to spend his shift thinking things over. There’s one thing that he wants to think over with more detail and he puts that aside for now so he can enjoy the movie.

The lights aren’t exactly
Has he ever seen Cas smile this much? It feels like this is some kind of blue moon event thing and it’s making him feel
Duly noted. Castiel hums and watches as Dean heads to the door. He peeks out into the hallway to listen before actually leaving. The shower isn’t running at the moment, so Gabriel must be done and getting dressed by now. Their timing couldn’t have been better, then. Nike had spent the night with Gabriel since she doesn’t like sharing Castiel’s bed too much when Dean is here too. Now that the door is open, she makes her appearance and jumps up onto the bed. She beelines for Castiel’s chest and he stops her with a gentle hand, petting her until she rolls over where she stands.
See? Cas was making

“It’s just as tidy as I expected it to be.” Cas looks around as he shrugs out of his coat and drapes it over Dean’s bed. “If there weren’t so any people downstairs, I’m sure that it would be just as clean.”

family first.” A muscle in his jaw ticks and he and briefly glances at Dean. “He’s been out cold with spell casters and doctors hovering over him for more than
Of course Gabriel has an answer for that too. “Big whoop. You’re good with beer so have a couple yourself. If you get drunk and don’t want to finish your shift when you get back, then close the café. You’re the boss and no one is going to care.”
Within moments, Dean answers with another smiley face.
Oh, right. Gabriel has to get up to work at five o’clock in the morning. Of course that means he’s going to be going to bed earlier tonight than he did yesterday. Castiel shakes his head and lifts the book up in front of his face. “I’ll be fine, thank you. I might go for a walk later tonight.” Most likely when the cat – when Nike – will go down for a nap. She’ll miss him less if she’s sleeping.
. One of his favourite things, before this whole nightmare that has been the last six weeks, was when Cas would hold him down and frot against him like they were having sex. As long as he doesn’t skip the prep and takes this position to the next step, then Dean is
, Dean.”
With a sigh, Dean exchanges the book for his phone and rolls onto his back again. There aren’t any missed messages from the day, but he scrolls through messages from the past few days. Yesterday Jo texted him asking if they had any peanuts. Her reasons are still unknown, but Dean let her take the ones from his private cupboard in the kitchen. There weren’t that many left in the bag anyways, so it’s not a big deal to let her have the rest.

game, Dean! You can’t just abandon me like this.”
“How many do you have now?” Wasn’t he folding something like a thousand of them? It’s been a while since Dean paid attention to how many there were hanging from the ceiling.
Does that mean Dean will be staying? But for how long? Castiel lifts his head just enough to be able to peek up at him. “When are you going home?”
Once they added fingering to their sexual repertoire, Dean discovered a lot of things about himself. Among those things was that he
That doesn’t seem to appease Balthazar much. He rolls his eyes and flips over the next time card in the stack that he’s entering right now. Jess flashes Dean a grin and a shrug as she gets back to finishing up her prep for tomorrow. They’ve both been working their asses off for this place and Dean agrees, they both definitely deserve a vacation after this.

no.” Dean puts his hands over his, but makes no motion to try and move closer again. He sits back on Castiel’s knees. “I’m not going anywhere when you’re hurting like this.”
Cas choose then to get out of the car, and he clears his throat as he does so. “I hate to interrupt, but according to Dean;
It takes a little while, but eventually Dean does sit up and gets his knees under him. “That. Was.

“I hope you like wasabi mayonnaise.” Mom grins and gives everyone their sandwich. “And if you don’t, then you better suck it up and eat it anyways.”
A snort of laughter cuts him off. Castiel lifts his head just enough to shoot Gabriel a dark glare. “I danced
The kitchen island is decked out with all manner of fixings that they can add to it; enough to put Subway to shame. It’s basically most of the contents of Dean’s fridge and it’s making Castiel’s mouth water just to look at it all while he prepares their side salad. For some reason Dean also has a bowl of chips on the counter and Castiel doesn’t fully understand it’s purpose until they’re making their sandwiches and Dean not only puts a few on his plate next to his salad, but he also places them in his sandwich right next to the jalapenos, tomatoes, peppers, and everything else he added.
Oh, that’s a good marketing idea! Instead of answering Balthazar, Castiel makes stops putting away the coffee mugs long enough to scribble himself a note to look into selling travel mugs with the logo for both
Everyone seems to murmur amongst themselves, but there’s no definitive answer from anyone. Dean rolls his eyes and pats Charlie on the shoulder. “I got this.” He raises his sword and everyone falls silent again. “Everyone who wants another round come stand behind us, otherwise stay where you are if you want to go home.” In a crowd, it’s usually the best way to determine who wants to do what.
She shakes her head with a smile. “Or, y’know,
“But it’s still
It feels like it takes forever before the little packet is finally ripped open. Cas’s breathing has gotten rougher the longer it took and he shakes his head, squinting like he can’t focus as he reaches down to roll it on over Dean’s erection. He hasn’t been touched in a while and
Castiel throws his hands up in the air in defeat as the door actually closes on him. He stalks down the short hallway to the living room and all but throws himself down on the couch. The credits of the movie are still paused and Castiel turns off both the DVD player and the TV. There’s a book on the end table that he left there earlier when he was reading before Dean came over. He picks that up and flips through it to the last page he was on.
Castiel doesn’t look back and he squeezes the crystal a little harder, it’s edges digging into his palm. “Remind me again how long it was before you made friends with Balthazar?” He was Gabriel’s first friend after they moved here in the fall of last year, and Balthazar didn’t join their team until the spring of this year. “It’s just taking me a little longer to adjust, okay?”
Oh that hits Dean right in the heart and he doesn’t even know the guy. If Cas didn’t pull his phone out right then, Dean absolutely would have mentioned something about exchanging numbers. Cas taps about on the screen a bit, unlocking it and opening up the address book before he holds it out to Mr. Montagne. “Please give me your phone number. It wasn’t really possible for us to do it before, but I think it’s time that we pick up contact again.”
Crashing back into the world of consciousness is never a fun thing. It’s worse when there’s a cold sweat soaking your skin and you’re already out of breath. Dean sits up with a gasp, eyes wild in the dark. He flails out to turn on the light, but misses enough times that he almost knocks over his empty glass. After a few more attempts, he finally manages to get it. By then he realizes that he’s most definitely awake now and whatever nightmare that scared the shit out of him is over now.
He’s halfway through the quiz when a loud siren-like alarm goes off. It nearly gives him a heart attack, which isn’t helped as Dean practically throws him from the bed as he gets up. By the time Castiel is on his feet, Dean is already gone; the door wide open. He exits out into the main common area just in time to see Benny disappear down a pole into the garage below with Dean right after him. Castiel runs to the pole and drops to his knees. He looks through to find all four of them pulling on their gear.
It’s a lot harder to find things to do with Jo than it is Charlie. With Charlie, well, Dean already knows everything there is to know about her. They’ve been best friends since they were little and they share a ton of hobbies together. If it’s not their love of movies, shows, and games, then it’s LARPing or clubbing together. Jo isn’t old enough to do that yet. She has another year to go before she can legally drink – which doesn’t stop her from stealing Dean’s beers out of the fridge.
First and foremost, Dean shows Cas the garage. He’s never been formally introduced to the Impala before, so that’s really the best place to start. They shut the garage door from the button inside and Dean takes a few minutes to explain what the shit in the garage is for. He doesn’t
Cas looks up at him again, eyebrow raised. “Will you be getting coffee then?”
“Most of them.” Dean turns away to grab his beer, suddenly really needing to quench his thirst. “Those are usually the vaguest things you can put in. Basically you put whatever you want in it. Nice stuff, mean stuff, vague stuff. Whatever.
“Oh, that sounds nice!” Gabriel sits up straighter, a smile starting to spread. “You’ll have fun with –”
Whatever. Let them come. Castiel will take what little peace he can get right now. He’ll use the time to center himself, seal away the pain, and strengthen his resolve. Even if he doesn’t want to, he

Then and only then does he allow himself to start whistling. Hell, if he wasn’t on stairs right now then he’d jump and click his heels together. When was the last time he was
felt good, huh?”
Dawn is breaking on the other side of the curtains, and Castiel pays it no mind as he shuffles out of the bedroom with a yawn. As much as he hates leaving Dean’s side, he is much in need of a bathroom break. Strangely enough, his limbs still feel like they’re made of jelly even though it’s been
sound like he was hinting that Dean should leave now. That’s not entirely the case, but now there’s a heavy weight settling in his chest. What if he loses Dean as a customer? That would be terrible. Not only would he lose a customer, but he’d lose one of his

bag considering that he only has a change of clothes in it. They both tend to just sleep in their underwear now. It lessens the amount of laundry they have to do if things take a turn for the sexy at some point during the night, or morning. Cas lays his clothes out over the back of the desk chair while Dean hangs his on the back of his closet door.
“It’s okay, Jimbo. There’s no sun in here.” Richard pulls the tarp away, revealing a weak smile and two police officers standing behind him. “It’s safe.”

“Oh, no, no,
“Mhmm.” Cas looks down at his lap again. “I’ve never told anyone the whole story of what happened. But I – I’d like to tell you, if I may?”
She sighs and pats his hand before stepping back towards the kitchen door. “Well, here’s hoping he kicks you to the curb. I win if he does!”
He grumbles under his breath but continues the work without further complaint. James does his best not to gloat as he finishes the last question of the quiz. When he’s finished, he reviews all the questions in case he made any mistakes. Once satisfied, he adds his name and the date to the top of the sheet before he slides it across the table. Richard makes an unhappy noise and scrambles to do the same. Mother places them in her binder when she has both and closes it. She’ll mark them during tomorrow’s class while they do whatever work sheets she has for them.
“Whoa, whoa.” Gabriel holds his hands up in defence. “I’m not saying that you have to go ask him out. I’m just saying that you should go and at least make a damn
he wanted him to keep talking before. “Sorry – not really – but remind me, does me talking keep you in your head?”
At this point, Dean is starting to contemplate cancelling the party altogether. “I don’t wanna.”
Good point. “Yeah, I guess we can go in.” It’s not like his pit is going to need to be
“You can’t fault me being worried.” Castiel hisses and starts trying to herd Gabriel towards back into the kitchen. “If I recall correctly,

burning in his chest. He is more than ready to blame
good stuff, but he’d at least like to get to the part where Cas puts one of his legs over his shoulder to spread him. Then he’d take those fingers – the ones Dean can’t stop staring at when he’s typing in an order on the register or when he’s folding origami – would slick up and push in.
This part is always rather uncomfortable. Castiel has never liked the feeling of having blood painted between his shoulder blades, right between the tattooed bases of his wings. He’s been on the receiving end of this so many times that he can even mentally draw a picture of the focusing circle while Gabriel moves his thumb over his skin. The hair on the back of his neck stands as Gabriel starts mumbling a spell. Power starts gathering in the room and even the cat can sense it. She jumps up and starts pacing, meowing loudly.
. Cas doesn’t complain when Dean moves his hand out of the way so he can take over.
Castiel rests his cheek on one fists and snaps a carrot stick between his teeth. “Well, we’ve been living alone together for over ten years now. We long since figured out our roles when it comes to cleaning.” He pops the second half of the carrot stick into his mouth and shrugs. “Gabriel and I both like to have a tidy shared space, and I’m sure you noticed that we don’t own very many things in the first place.”
Dean rolls his eyes with a laugh and tromps down to where the sidewalk should be. It’s a bit hard to see where it is because of the snow. They start shoveling mostly at the same time, scraping the shovel from one side to the other before tossing the accumulated snow onto the lawn. This is very different from cleaning the sidewalk in front of the café and tidying up the back parking lot after the big tractors have come through. Last winter was the first time Castiel had shoveled snow in over ten years. He’s been doing it a few times this winter too and he’s honestly not sure whether he likes it anymore.

that’s a good brownie. Sadly, it’s not enough to distract from the glare he can feel like a drill to the side of his head. He did wrong and he knows he did wrong, but dear God he’s going to act play the fool and look as innocent as fucking possible.
His heart trips over itself in his chest at the realization. It’s very possible that Dean will already figure out the risks himself. Castiel has seen the articles and information on the internet about his species. If Dean does the right search, he’ll find out all about the dark magic covens that hunt Gargoyles for their stone. It’s possible that he’ll pair that knowledge with what he knows about Castiel’s parents, and maybe he’ll realize what dangers come with being in a relationship with a Gargoyle.
“Fine, fine.” He knows when he’s been beaten. Dean raises his hands in defeat and drops back on the couch. “One more episode, then. If we’ve got the time after shoveling, we could maybe watch another episode or two?”
“Aw, c’mon!” Gabriel whines and drops his arms, his whole frame going droopy. “Don’t be like that!”
Cas is face down next to him, his cheek squished into the pillow. His hair is off in every direction and one arm is hanging off the edge of the bed. It’s fucking adorable and Dean props himself up on his elbow just to look at him for a little bit. No one else really gets to see Cas like this and Dean can’t help feeling lucky as hell to be the one who gets to see it.
Maybe it’s because he’s spent the last thirteen years of his life thinking about how no one is ever going to be safe with him. Or maybe it’s because he’s actually quite the pessimist. Or maybe it’s just any of the hundred or so reasons that present themselves about why anyone knowing what he is would be a bad thing. Either way, he still needs to calm down and get himself into a headspace where he can bring himself to go back down and face the remaining several hours of his actual work shift.

satisfying make out session when he woke up and before Castiel went to sleep. Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to anything and he’s starting to get increasingly disappointed with that.
That’s all well and good, but Castiel is starting to feel just a little trapped by Dean’s hand. He’s still holding it and it’s making him feel too hot throughout his whole body. He squirms slightly, trying to get comfortable when his whole body is starting to feel itchy. “I would like to go watch him.”
Dean’s pulse ratchets up a few notches more and his mouth suddenly goes dry. “Y-yeah?” Oh sweet Jesus this is it. This is

go to Dean’ house. Not yet, at least. There’s a little voice whispering paranoid propaganda in the back of his mind, telling him that someone in that home would be out to get him. It would likely be one of the roommates. Castiel trusts that Dean wouldn’t do anything to hurt him – more or less, and Sam was thoroughly vetted by Gabriel before he was hired. That leaves the two roommates; Charlie and Jo. Neither of which Castiel really knows. Just because they’re firefighters doesn’t mean that he can
With a sigh, Dean flops back on the bed and tries to make himself comfortable. The phone is still in his hands, though he hasn’t really opened the screen yet. There’s still a slight shake in his limbs and he tries his best to will it away – until he realizes that the little light on his phone is flashing. That means he’s got a missed message, and when the hell did that come in? Probably while he was sleeping, and he just didn’t see the notification when he checked the time. He would have noticed if it had dingled while he’s been awake.
“Sure do!” He looks up from the card machine. “Why?”
we clean up, huh?”
Despite that, Cas doesn’t actually pop his third beer until after they’ve been downstairs to meet Jo. It’s a quick meeting there, considering she’s right in the middle of a doubles beer pong game so someone else does the drinking for her while she just throws the ball. She’s on call too and it’s good that she’s not getting drunk. One or two drinks would be okay, but beer pong could kick her ass if she let it. He’s seen her play it before and she’s pretty good, more or less.
Castiel doesn’t look up, but he does nod. He signs off on his journal before standing up. With careful hands, he folds the blanket and places it at the head of his bed. He runs his fingers over it and a real smile tugs up at the corners of his mouth. How did he get so lucky to have met Dean? It’s gotten to the point where he can’t really imagine not having him in his life any more.
Castiel shares a look with Gabriel. “Nothing that I know of. I suppose we’ll do gifts when I wake up Friday evening? Otherwise Gabriel is already on shift when I finish work in the morning.”

The cat doesn’t like it too much when he moves her from his chest, and she follows after him with an annoyed meow. She purrs and curls around his ankles while he finds a Tupperware container in the kitchen and fills it with a few scoops of dry food. He uses a label to put the expiry date on it, and he makes a mental note of the date on the couple of cans of wet food that he takes too. Castiel finds room for it in his emergency bag, wedging everything in among the clothes. Now, if he has to run, the cat will have some food when he takes her with him.
