Finally the whimpers subside enough for Tony to place Peter on the center of the crib. He fetched soft flannel cloth with lukewarm water and for five hours he stood vigilant near his son, his son! and later when he found out that he was close to losing Peter to pneumonia something just changed in Tony.
Recovery is hard but they get better. Those memories might still be fresh but they don’t control his family and for that Peter is grateful.
“I have seen the Stark industries lab and its main genius,” Peter smiled as he stood from this workbench and hip checked Tony.
“Do you have a family Stark?” Yinsen asked and Tony’s mind took him to his seven year old son. Tony was so grateful that no one did not know about Peter.
“Hello Your highness,” Peter greets the king and then turns to Steve, saying in frankly scary manner,
Later when Tony made the new Arc Reactor core and beat Justin Hammer’s sorry ass, he was glad that he kept Peter with him. May had seen how Peter reacted being away from Tony and she conceded only asking Peter to visit her frequently.
So Tony takes the full precaution including the Vibranium Spider suit. Anyone try to harm his son, they’d be killed before they could scratch Peter
When the door closed with an automated click, Tony fell to his knees and wept. He wept for his friend, he wept for his death and he wept for the loss of his son.
“I mean, he is pretty damn cute, but the way you two act together is just perfect,” Bucky responded.
He was sitting between Clint and Sam, watching a movie. Well, more like Bucky was being smothered by Clint and Sam had an arm around his shoulders, petting Clint’s hair.
Instead of sitting down, Tony padded over and pressed himself against Steve’s back. Steve paused for a moment before going back to flipping pancakes.
Tony followed behind all the way to the common area where Clint was sitting on one of the couches, watching Chiepaer fuss over Gaigheiss. Bucky came up to the back of the couch and hopped over to sit next to Clint.
“Yes. She couldn’t sleep last night because it shook her up so much. Her husband died in a car crash and every time she drifted off to sleep, she had nightmares.” Sarah looked up at her son as she paid for the sandwich. “The nurses didn’t check to see if there was any family in the waiting room, so the poor boy had to sit out there worrying all night. I’m really glad that she has someone to stay with her now, and he seems like a very caring young man.”
They had both draped their wings over his shaking form and wrapped their arms around him, since he seemed to calm down a bit when they did.
People were always surprised when they saw the undersides of his wings. They didn’t expect such a powerful man to have such a feminine color.
Tony stared at him in shock. Never in a million years had he ever imagined that his baby could be hurt by that fact that he hadn’t settled down. “What can I do?” he asked. “There’s got to be something.”
“No. No. Nope. No way. Why is this one even in here?” Tony threw file after file over his shoulder. He dropped his head down on the table. “Why do I have to do this?”
Tony nodded and slid down onto the floor in front of the couch. Pepper grabbed some blankets and Rhodey followed him. The three laid down and entangled their limbs with each other. Tony immediately felt more at ease now that his two favorite people were cuddled up under the blankets with him.
He whistled and held up his arm. Redwing sped down and landed lightly. Sam grinned and said, “Good girl.” He gave her a piece of meat before hooking the jess that hung around Redwing’s ankle to his gauntlet.
Rhodey reached over to steal some popcorn from Tony’s bowl, nearly falling out of his chair onto Pepper, who was lounging on the floor with Bruce. “Watch it, Colonel Clumsy,” Tony said, holding the bowl above his head. “You’ll spill my popcorn.”
“We actually have to go, too,” Sam said, pushing Bucky off the couch before standing up as well. “This one volunteered to help me over at the Dynamic Services office,” he continued, gesturing to Bucky, who was laying on the ground and glaring up at him.
After Tony explained what he had done, she was quiet for a bit before saying, “That was stupid, even for you, and you better show them to me when they’re fully healed.” With that said, she turned around and left, but not without leaving a stack of paperwork behind.
“Okay,” Steve said quietly. He pulled the blankets up and wrapped a wing around Tony to keep him warm.
Clint could tell when Steve found what he wanted him to see. “Clint?” Steve said, voice breaking and fingers rubbing over the small scar.
Tony grinned. “But Pep, you could use a kick to the face to bring your otherworldly beauty down to a normal human level.” Pepper shook her head fondly, turning back to the movie.
Zeugmagueen brought to my attention that the reasoning behind Tony needing an Alpha around wasn't explained really well, so here's a chapter to explain it better!
“Can I see them?” Bucky asked timidly after everyone else had already retreated to Tony’s guest rooms to sleep.
“Hello, Mrs. Stark,” Sarah said as she walked into Maria’s room. “You’ll never guess who I found out in the waiting room.”
A few minutes later Clint came back into the room, Thor behind him. Clint must have already explained the situation, because Thor didn’t say anything as he came over and pulled Steve to his feet.
Tony had always known that he would find at least one of his soulmates. He just hadn’t expected to find one this soon.
Sam was lounging on a bench in Central Park, resting before continuing his morning run. A man with sandy blonde hair sat down next to him.
Tony went through sixteen personal assistants in the span of two and a half months before he found the perfect one.
Yinsen’s wings were already gone by the time Tony was brought to the cave. All he had left were ragged stumps that were extremely tender. The men that were tasked with guarding the prisoners thought it was funny to slap Yinsen on the back just to see his pain-filled expression.
Tony immediately went over and suited up again. As he went by, he gave a small device to Steve. “Here, you’ll be able to see what I see.” Steve nodded and Tony opened the door and walked into the darkened room. He closed the door behind him, then turned to the hulking shape in front of him.
“That’s my son,” Sarah said, chuckling. “And he was in the military, so he always looks like that when he’s not paying attention.”
“Nope. I refuse.” Tony grabbed his real arm and dragged him out of the apartment. “No family of mine is going to get shitty tech.”
he thought. He moved a bit closer to the door, not even noticing when Chiepaer jumped off his shoulder, silver scales shining.
“That’s great sweetheart!” She said. “Let me see- oh, honey.” She looked up at her son’s excited face sadly. Her husband looked over her shoulder, eyes bright, before his face fell.
“Either way, we need to get going.” Sam hauled Bucky up and herded him toward the door. Rhodey followed them out, a grin on his face.
Howard Stark had died a year ago in a car crash on his way to the airport. Maria was supposed to go with him on his trip, but had decided to stay behind to take care of the house. She was devastated when she heard the news of Howard’s death. Tony, on the other hand, was relieved.
Bucky’s eyes lit up and a wide grin split his face as he lunged forward and scooped Tony up into a bear hug. After a long moment, he released Tony to bring Steve in for a hug instead.
“Yep,” Tony confirmed. “I want to know who’s involved, where the shipments are going, and how I can stop it.”
The officer sighed and pulled his cuffs out. “Public Indecency. Please turn around and put your hands behind your back.”
Becca was the only one that knew, because he couldn’t read the words that had appeared behind his left ear on his sixteenth birthday.
“I’d fight for you anytime, sweetheart,” Bucky said, strolling up to them with his best smile on his face.
the man asked, peering at him from over his purple tinted sunglasses. “I was watching you when you were out in that field.”
“Not much,” Steve replied with a yawn. “Just couldn’t sleep. I was surprised you were up here instead of in the workshop.”
“Normally I’d advise you to tell him, but I don’t know if he’s ready for that yet,” Bruce said, leaning his head on Tony’s and rubbing his arm. “But I do think you should talk to him.”
“Iron Man, can you locate where they’re keeping the dragons?” Steve called out over the comms. Pyziedot flew over, dropping a HYDRA agent in front of him.
“Maria Stark. The woman I was telling you about yesterday,” Sarah said, walking over to grab a sandwich from the rack.
“So I started researching after Bruce told me about this program, because he only said that it was necessary for the development of the baby.”
“Oh, the lady who got into a car accident?” Steve asked, remembering the case his mother had mentioned in passing.
When Thor finally put him down, Tony stumbled backward, aiming to land on the couch, but ended up in Steve’s lap instead. He felt his face immediately heat up, and when he looked back, Steve was bright red. Tony moved to get up, but Steve just snaked one arm around his waist to keep him in place.
Sam was about to roll his sleeves up when a police officer jogged up to them and said, “You’re going to have to come with me, sir.”
Sam came up behind them and clapped a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Hey, it’s good to see you again, man,” he said. He turned to Bucky and smiled, holding a hand out.
Tony held his arm out to Maria, who slid off her chair and knelt down in front of him, smiling brightly. Maria gently grasped his arm to see the words that had scrawled themselves on his inner elbow, her husband coming around the table to see as well.
“The last time?” Tony repeated eagerly. He had always wanted a big pack, and he wanted his soulmates’ soulmates to be part of it.
Steve and Bucky followed him and watched as he flopped into Rhodey’s lap. Bucky nudged Steve. “Who’s that guy?” he asked suspiciously.
Tony shrugged. “Maybe I didn’t want you to know?” he replied distractedly, arms deep in a box of scraps.
Smiling, Steve showed him the inside hem of his shirt. What looked like a tiny piece of metal was stitched in. “No one is as smothering as Tony can be,” he said.
Steve just stared down at his wings vacantly and replied, “I’m fine, JARVIS. You don’t need to worry about me.”
Being deaf didn’t really affect Tony’s life all that much. He was already miles ahead of kids his age academically, and people weren’t really his thing, so he was pretty much okay. Plus, learning sign language with Jarvis was fun. It was like a secret language that only they knew.
As Sarah was reaching up to grab a blanket from up high on a shelf in the storage closet, two arms wrapped around her from behind. She jumped and spun around. Once she saw who it was, she gave him her most motherly scowl.
His hand was on its way to his right wing when Tony peeked in the door. “Oh, Capsicle, you’re awake!” he said with a smile. He came into the room, carrying a tray of food. “I made you breakfast. And by ‘made’ I mean I got JARVIS to order take out.”
Every morning Steve woke up early and went for a run. When he got back, he took a shower and made himself breakfast.
“Because I’m only here to verify that Steve makes it to the omega’s place of residence and that neither of them are in danger,” Sam replied with a smirk. “Steve also likes me better.”
“So,” Sam said, leaning back in his chair, brown and gray wings twitching. “What brought you to Central Park at the ass crack of dawn?”
Steve’s words changed the day of his twentieth birthday.  He was overseas, just back from a rescue mission when it happened.
“I’m glad,” Steve said, a bit confused. If his mother liked this guy, then he must be a good man, although Steve couldn’t figure out why Sarah was telling him all of this.
Soft feathers brushed against his own, smoothing the ruffled patches on his wings. Tony was a welcome weight on his chest, pressing him slightly into the bed.
Yzzial had been observing Steve for the last few days, trying to determine what his human saw in him.
“Because Pepper is only one person. One absolutely wonderful person, but still only one,” Rhodey said, shuffling through his own stack.
“You don’t have to come in,” Tony told him as they stood outside an old-fashioned diner. “They’ll understand.”
“He was in Central Park, but now he’s in a little cafe,” Tony replied, glancing at the holographic map that was floating by the wall.
“Dottie,” Steve replied. Gaigheiss toppled off Clint’s shoulder and onto the bed. He rolled into Steve’s lap and nudged his hand. “Hey, bud, you feeling better?” Steve asked the purple dragon, gently scratching behind the ridge of scales on his head.
He remembers when Pepper first brought the one year old into his office. Mary, Peter’s mother had died a few days ago and   the child had no one else in the world except for Tony.
“And they don’t deserve the tower you gave to them freely!” Peter shouted and then stomped into his room, slamming the door shut.
“The young master is currently in your bedroom, but I do not think he is very keen on seeing you,” The AI said. Tony moved towards the master bedroom.
“There’s also new news on Stark. He has son,” Natasha said softly “Stark’s been raising him since he was a baby.”
Peter sat up, eyes red rimmed and face pale. Tony carefully pulled him into a hug, humming some nameless tune under his breath. “You okay Buddy?”
Tony knew the confrontation between the split Avengers was inevitable. So he scraped together his half of the Avengers and went to face Steve.
He built his Peter the world’s best suit; based on Tony’s knowledge on Spiderman , he upgraded the suit until he was sure Peter would be safe.
Peter presses down on his palm and clogs the mouth of the blaster with webbing causing the girl to yelp.
Before he was to leave and go after Steve and Barnes, Tony stopped and had words with Peter in the hotel suit he was staying in.
After half an hour when he saw a mush covered Rhodes and Peter no one could blame Tony for taking a picture.
May had searched far and wide and this search had led here to Peter Parker Stark. “You are willing to give me custody?” she had asked dubiously and Tony had said “I have my reason.”
“Peter you know that you are the most important thing in my life. Even if it’s the end of the world I want you to know that I will always have time for you and don’t forget it.”
Tony realized something that day, he doesn’t know what he realized so he took on Peter’s responsibility because this boy would be the joy in his life.
Tony made a sly face and said “How is Liz?” which made him promptly fall into a fit of laughter at the way Peter’s face turned pink.
T’Challa’s invitation to spend some time in Wakanda was hard to refuse. It was more difficult to convince Peter to stay back at NewYork once he found out, and when Shuri found out that Tony was coming she made sure that Peter and Ned came as well. She made SURE.
“I missed you too Tones,” Rhodey said an sat down on a stool. He was wearing civilian clothes so he must have come from his mother’s house, Tony deduced.
Peter smiled and reached for a hug, nose rubbing against Tony’s suit jacket, “I know dad but sometimes I wanna help you too.”
He did remember that it was thanksgiving and Laura Barton, bless her heart, had invited them for dinner. Clint’s wife had taken a shining to Tony, he highly suspected that she saw him as one of her unruly children. For most of the part Tony would love to go to the Barton’s home but this time he couldn’t.
After his visit to the Avengers Peter and his father have a fall out again but luckily May straightens their act and Peter and Tony settle down.
“Tony, he has plans for thanks giving,” Natasha stated and then as an afterthought added “Is it because Wanda will be there?”
The media had Known that a Stark heir existed, they had multiple pictures of Tony Stark with a child at various ages; but they never figured out his identity, Tony made sure of that. When Peter was very young Pepper had told him of making Peter a public knowledge, not so much as the paparazzi would hound the kid but more in the terms of making the people slightly aware of Peter.
Peter was eager to be an Avenger (Tony heard every single one of his voicemails). He had a fight with Peter over the Spider-man suit. Tony went suit shopping with Peter and laughed his butt off at May’s failed attempt to teach his awkward son how to dance; Spider powers or not Peter was still lanky and clumsy.
King T’Challa’s sister had removed the coding from Bucky’s memory, so America had pardoned him as well, Steve felt utter joy in finally taking Bucky back home as a free man, but at the back of his mind Steve still ached for Tony.
Things got a little messy after thanksgiving, like Tony’s lecture that led to him realizing some terrible truths. His attempts to tame the Avengers which led to Steve leaving in a huff and Zemo getting into Barnes’ coding and releasing the Winter Soldier.
When Tony went to drop Peter at May’s he sent Happy out to fetch Peter’s bags. Peter asked him when the next mission was and got this as a reply,
“Parker is my Maternal name,” Peter said with a smile, this was the first genuine question he heard after the press conference, Ned was still mad about not telling him the truth.
“You can’t do this, it’s insane!” 9 year old Peter said as he stared in horror as his father took a sip at the milkshake that DUM-E just handed to Tony.
“Your son looks just like you Stark,” she says. Her eyes are shining as she looks at Peter. “You have raised him well.” She continues and leads him towards the throne room.
“Barton’s going home, so is Lang,” Natasha said as she came and stood beside him. They were at the tower for a week now and since everything has cooled down it was no surprise that they were going.
“This is Colonel Rhodes, and nope, he isn’t available for a certain Tomy Stracks” Rhodey’s voice flooded through his helmet, automatically making him smile.
” Tony said, landing in the suit’s platform, seeing Steve’s silhouette through the windows. “Might do that right this moment. I’ll call you later, baby bear.”
, this will wear off in a few minutes," Thor hugged Steve, who hugged him back like a big bear. "It is time to meet with the rulers of this magnificent planet. You shall follow us to the big blue castle."
Tony released a breath he didn't know he was holding and immediately looked at his right, where Steve was looking at him with a fond smile on his face. Tony blushed and rapidly looked at the front again, making eye contact with the purple-eyed Vanir, who smirked.
"Plus," Tony stuck his tongue at Clint, “I’m very comfortable carrying it. The thing’s like a feather.”
By the time they arrived at the castle and climbed all forty seven steps, Bruce was on the verge of hulking out and Clint ran out of jokes to tell (thank God).
Bruce smiled tightly, brushing one of his curls away from his face. “It’s alright, Captain Rogers. Nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.”
"Don't get me wrong. You are creating so much right know — this tower, your armor, the Maria Foundation, the Clean Energy Project — but, also, you are being better
meet you," Barton looked at Fury again, not giving Steve a chance to say hello, "I would've loved to that
Steve looked at him through his blond eyelashes, radiating disbelief and fondness. He blinked twice. “We both are,” Tony raised his eyebrows at him. “OK, maybe
, never expecting a reward, never asking for something in return. You are lovely. And I love you. I love you when you haven't showered in days because you are tinkering. I love you when you walk red carpets like you own the place – and, fuck, probably you do. I love your sleepy smile in the mornings and I love the way your hair goes all curly when you're fresh out of the shower. I love the way you speak, I love your passion about science, technology and your search for a better world. I love you. Every single hour, every single day. I love you because you gave me a home when no one else bothered to look past a legend that didn't even belong to me in the 21st century. I just love you. I swear to God, Tony, I do. You just– you make me so happy, like never before."
Before making a fool of himself, Tony had smiled, offering his hand and trying not to say a joke about being trapped in the ice for seventy years.
The Vanir advanced more, surrounding them. Steve and Thor sprinted towards Clint and Nat, blocking the lady's way to them.
His brain was still trying to process the whole trip and the fact that he was on another planet. It was beautiful, though, with weird-looking plants of colors he hasn't seen before, tall trees with only a few green leaves and a lot of blue and red mushrooms laying around, which moved up and down, expelling air. He wondered if his suit made some kind of camouflage with them.
"Spying isn't my thing either," Tony responded before making the silence awkward. "We the pros need no hiding," he joked.
The knight didn't bother to look at him. "Ah, indeed. The blonde ones. They are already conversing with my comrades."
"Yes, Tony. We are a team and a team functions because each member is responsible for his actions. We're not going to be behind you all the time, checking if you're paying attention or not. That's your decision," Steve said with finality.
, don’t worry,” he separated a few centimetres from Steve, so fucking close to his face, “you just need to tell me you’re proud of me and I’m all yours.”
By the time they fully entered the room, Tony immediately saw Steve, tall and confident, chatting with one of the meanies they knew from the accidental fight. Steve's red and blue suit, and his shield, made him stand out from the other warriors and their gold walls.
. It had been weird, especially for Steve, adapting to new people, technology and a life of superheroes. They were doing fine, though – leaving aside Clint’s habit of abandoning his underwear in the living room and Thor’s rumbling voice singing some weird Asgardian songs at five in the morning.
“You don’t even get paid, Mr. I Do This for the People,” Tony retorted, his voice muffled by Steve’s big arm. “How come you always ruin precious moments?” he reproached, making Steve laugh – Tony could
Steve only gave him a look, the one that said: 'I'm the leader of the team and I need you to take things seriously and cooperate with me or
Situation which, of course, was handled by him and Rhodey. (He doesn't even want to get started with Rhodey. Brave, good,
"You helped me come to terms with Peggy's death, attending the funeral with me, giving me your shoulder to cry on and keeping yourself awake three nights straight to hear me babble about my past. You just give, and give, and
Tony, gaping, grabbed Steve's arms and pulled him upwards. Steve let him – if he hadn't, Tony wouldn't have been capable of pulling him up. "Are you crazy?! We don't fight mother nature!" Tony shrieked.
"Just– stay here." Bruce said, "We don't know if he touched or smelled a poisonous plant. We need Thor," he explained, turning around and beginning to walk very fast towards the others.
“The Bifrost?” Bruce’s eyes gleamed. “That’s a dream come true!” And he began to shake Tony up, “Tony, Tony! Wake up!”
Still, the guy was absolutely insane; Tony would’ve never invaded someone’s planet just because Howard was a dick.
"Lucky midgardians," the purple-eyed woman said, grinning with emotion, "I didn't know you had soulmates."
"But I hurt him," Steve interrupted, his blue eyes shining. "That's what I do when I hurt you. I apologise."
“Ngh,” Tony grumbled, blinking a couple of times before fully opening his eyes. His hair was a mess. “Wasup?”
Those were the kind of moments a normal kid wouldn't remember about his dad, but Tony was a genius, even being a tiny seven-year-old kid, he always paid attention to everything – it wasn't a surprise he'd remembered.
Tony was fucking embarrassed. His heartbeat was going crazy and seeing Steve's face and ears red didn't help to calm him down.
"Although the Captain had already told me about your sorrowful intentions," she said, "and about your
They instantly clicked. All it took was a conversation about gamma radiation and Tony immediately fell in love. Not in a romantic way, but in a soulmates-for-knowledge way. Tony liked talking about scientific stuff, Bruce too. He was also very patient, laughing at Tony's antics and backing him up when needed.
"Please understand," Steve said this time, putting the shield at his back and raising his hands at the level of his shoulders. "He didn't know. We have no intention of destroying your ecosystem. It's actually my fault," Steve confessed, "I– I smelled some of them on my way here and they caused a reaction on my– uhm, on my body. He was trying to see if it wasn't poisonous."
, Tony could hear Pepper's words in his mind – but he didn't want to disappoint them. Also, Tasha would kick his ass if she knew, and she would, she always did).
Steve was making some pancakes with eggs and bacon for everyone, though he always made the bacon a little too raw, no one complained. The rest of them were seated on the kitchen’s island, Bruce and Nat greeted Thor too while Clint just grumbled, his eyes focused on his phone. He was probably playing Candy Crush.
"I was receiving them," Thor's booming voice startled Tony. "Giving my regards in the name of Midgard and Asgard. They’re very sophisticated and dangerous creatures. The Vanir demand respect and honor and we were giving them that," Thor sighed, "until one of them initiated a friendly battle with Steven."
Tony remembered those days very clearly: Dad on the couch with a bottle of wine – sometimes with a pipe too –, his glassy eyes with a gaze that seemed so far away, talking and babbling and slurring about Steve Rogers, his dear friend,
"We used to do that too," Steve said after a beat, "— the spying — back in the war. I wasn't very good at it. They'd always make fun of me," he laughed with melancholy.
“Hey, dummy, it seems your dad finally brought us dinner,” Steve cheered and DUM-E made those chirping sounds, indicating that it was happy.
"Thor told us, though," Bruce stated nervously, removing a strand of hair from his face. "In the quinjet, before we arrived. He said they’d probably try to battle for tradition but that it wouldn't be serious."
“I’ve been working on a new outfit for you,” he said, looking away from Steve in an attempt to get him to relax. “I need you to come down so I can get the right measurements.”
“He’s over there,” Clint said, nodding at Tony. The guy looked over and opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, Clint held up his hand. “I just wanted to say that-”
He jumped when a hand landed on his shoulder. “You need to sleep,” Pepper signed when he jerked around to look at her.
“Steve. Shut up,” Bucky said when Steve told him that one day. “They are amazing.” Bucky turned around and looked at Steve. “Now get over here and let me clean those wings of yours. They’ve got dirt in them.”
Steve’s eyes widened and Bucky’s jaw dropped open. It couldn’t be possible. He couldn’t have met both his soulmates in one day.
The alpha shook his head. “I am not a sourpuss. Stop introducing me like that,” he told Tony in amusement. He held out a hand to Steve. “James Rhodes.”
Steve eyed him suspiciously, but let Clint do what he wanted. He eventually relaxed as Clint began preening his wings and stretched them out so Clint could reach the undersides.
Tony smiled and ran his finger across the black writing on the inside of his elbow. He didn’t realize that he would come to publicly hate those words, only to cry over them in privacy.
The next time Tony woke up, he felt like he was overheating. He turned his head and the reason made itself very apparent very quickly. Clint was wrapped around him like a second skin, completely passed out.
Tony gave her a thumbs up before turning his attention back to the board member that was speaking, pushing his specialized glasses up his nose. He kept tapping his pen to annoy them, but he appreciated that Pepper had told him.
Though all was well in Avengers Tower, a very different scene was playing out in a secret underground base.
Tony grinned proudly. “I made them. They’re my babies.” He ran a hand down his stomach. “Well, my first babies.”
“Yeah, I heard you it’s just… I didn’t think that someone ever would.” He sat down heavily on one of the stools by the island.
“Hmm.” Tony looked him up and down. “Not really my type, but I would be lying if I said I wasn’t curious.”
Tony scowled at her, but did as she said. He flopped onto his bed and, against his will, fell asleep almost immediately.
Maria looked up from her book just as Tony entered the room. “Hey, Mom,” he said, smiling softly, his eyes warm. He had always had a soft spot for his mother.
“Hey, Steve, it’s okay,” a voice said, gently pulling his hand away. Red and gold wings wrapped around him, metal tips cool against his skin.
Steve shook his head, scooting a bit closer to the armrest. The man sat and held his hand out. “Sam Wilson,” he introduced.
Bucky shook his head. “No, you just told me that sometimes pregnant Omegas need someone around. You didn’t go into specifics.”
Steve knocked on Bucky’s door, Tony by his side. “You sure you want me here?” Tony asked, swinging their joined hands between them. “I mean, will he even like me?”
Steve was in no shape to walk, so Thor carried him into Steve’s bedroom and laid him on the bed. He didn’t bother to dislodge Steve’s grip on his arm, laying down beside him instead.
Both parents were slightly shocked, because Tony was only six years old, and, normally, the words appeared around your tenth birthday.
Tony drew up the specs for Clint’s new hearing aids, then began to work. The work was extremely delicate and he soon became so absorbed in it that he didn’t notice the inside of his right wrist burning.
Steve sat up, slightly disappointed. He had been hoping that Yzzial would stay. He moved to get up, but stopped when the door opened.
She smiled kindly at him, then seemed to notice the bags under his eyes. “Have you been sleeping alright, dear?” she asked, walking over to him. She placed a hand on his forehead to check his temperature.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Tony grumbled. Steve raised an eyebrow. “Don’t you do that. Don’t make that face.” Steve just stared at him. “Arg, fine!”
It’s not uncommon for a person’s words to change. After all, things happen to people that can’t always be explained. For example, one lady’s words changed when her soulmate was attacked and his vocal cords were damaged.
Steve didn’t really know how he knew his soulmate was a man. Maybe it was the way the handwriting looked. It had a distinct male vibe to it.
“Hey, what’s wrong, sweetheart?” Steve asked worriedly, sinking down to his knees and placing his hand on Tony’s cheek.
He had expected Bucky to be angry that his best friend had pretty much admitted to liking men, but Bucky had just pulled him in for a hug and said, “Thanks for telling me.”
Bucky snorted. “What could be worse than knowing you’re going to have to choose between two people you’re destined to be with?”
“No, not really. You know, since my mom’s in here,” Tony said, gesturing to the hospital they were currently in.
Steve, of course, had been excited when Bucky had shown him. (It had also sent him into an asthma attack.) He was happy that he would get to meet Bucky’s soulmate before Bucky did.
Tony got out of that cave with his life and wings intact. The plans for Yinsen’s wings were safely tucked in his shirt, right next to the arc reactor. He made himself a vow that he wouldn’t sell any more weapons, and he would protect the people who couldn’t protect themselves.
Rhodey’s phone went off and he pulled it out. “Shoot, I have to go,” he said. He stood up and gave Tony a hug and a peck on the cheek. “Be nice to Steve now, alright.”
“That’s me, but you can just call me Tony,” he replied and shook the doctor’s hand. “It’s nice to meet you, Doctor Banner.”
A brief look of recognition crossed Sam’s face before he turned to look back out at the park. Steve stared at him for a moment before looking back down at his sketchbook. It looked as if he wouldn’t be able to finish his drawing of the tree across the path with the increase of foot traffic as it got to be lunch time.
Although Becca tried to get him to change his mind, Bucky knew he had to hide the second mark. This led to the decision to grow out his hair.
Steve came through the door and took in the bags under the other man’s big brown eyes and how he was curled up in the corner of the couch, munching on his sandwich.
Tony laughed. “I’ve only known him for a few week, but I can already tell that he gets into some shit. He layed a guy out flat the day I met him.”
He might have panicked a little before realising that it was only Tony. They might have gotten off on the wrong foot, but Steve would trust Tony with his life.
Steve rolled his eyes. “That’s James Rhodes, Tony’s best friend.” He glanced over Bucky’s shoulder. “Incoming.”
Tony hadn’t always been deaf. When he was younger, he was fully hearing, but explosions aren’t very good for your eardrums.
“I can do that,” Steve said, relaxing slightly when he saw Tony turn away from him. He hadn’t really spent any time with Tony since the Chitauri invasion, so maybe this was his chance. “When do you want me to come down?”
“I’m always nice,” Tony replied. Rhodey raised an eyebrow at him. “Okay, I’m nice most of the time.”
“Is that a tracker?” Sam asked, leaning forward for a closer look. He had to get into Steve’s personal space to see the tiny blinking light on it.
“Gaigheiss? I think he is,” Tony replied. “We can go check on him if you want.” Yzzial nodded vigorously and bounded off after the trio.
Jarvis had been the one to find him curled up in the corner, blood dripping from between the fingers clutching at his ears. He was the one who had cleaned Tony up and taken him to the doctor. Tony’s parents didn’t even know an accident had occurred until later in the day when Howard had gone into his lab.
Steve pulled up the edge of his shirt, revealing, instead of bare skin like usual, black marks on his ribs. He kept pulling until his shirt was completely off, not caring that his team was standing right there.
Also, if someone wanted to date a dragon’s human, they needed to ask the dragon’s permission first. If the dragon said no, then that was it. No means no.
“It is,” Steve said firmly, squeezing one of Tony’s hands. And it was. Steve had never heard of anyone being able to create an AI, let alone thinking of it as a child.
The three were sitting in silence, waiting for Pepper to absorb all the new information, when Clint’s phone beeped.
Chiepaer had a history of snapping at anyone who came within two feet of Gaigheiss when the other dragon was hurt. It had started when the two had met and Chiepaer hadn’t even let Clint or Bucky come close. It wasn’t hard to see that the two were meant to be together. The fact that it had brought Bucky and Clint together was just an added bonus.
Steve focused on the steady beat of the other man’s heart and felt his panic begin to abate. His head dropped onto the other man’s shoulder and he leaned his weight on Tony, completely and utterly exhausted. Tony’s hand came up to cup the back of his head and his other arm wrapped around Steve’s back.
A thoughtful look had crossed Steve’s face. “How long did you walk around with that gum in your hair? Two, three weeks?”
Clint slid in on Steve’s other side and, for lack of more space, Tony sprawled on top of Steve. Thor covered them all in his great wings, and Steve slowly stopped shivering.
There were many misconceptions about king dragons, one of them being that they were the strong, bold leaders of a family group. They are protectors, yes, but they are so much more than that.
Steve slid the pancakes onto a plate and turned around. He wrapped an arm around Tony and led him over to the island. Tony sat down, tangling a hand in Steve’s shirt and didn’t let him go until he finished eating.
Tony and Clint looked at each other. “You might want to sit down,” Clint said. “This might take a while.”
Clint shook his head and scowled. “I was stupid. I should have seen what was coming from a mile away, but I didn’t. I got permanent hearing loss for my trouble, and lost the only family I had. They weren’t a good family, but they were something.”
Pepper found him sitting on the couch in his workshop, gently cleaning his wings while the bots scrubbed the floor to get rid of the blood before it started to stain. She, understandably, freaked out a little.
He liked Yzzial. He really did. He made Tony happy, which made Steve happy, which made his human happy.
Steve turned and dashed over to the dragons and knelt in front of them, bowing his head. “Yzzial, please forgive me for not introducing myself sooner. I am Steven Grant Rogers, a Captain in the United States Military and field commander of the Avengers. I ask you for permission to court your human, Anthony Edward Stark.”
It started as an itch, but grew into a fiery pain that had him almost falling over. Bucky caught his arm and sat him on the ground. Their team crowded around, blocking their Captain from the view of curious bystanders.
Bruce was less sensitive than people gave him credit for, and often told everyone the truth, even if it wasn’t something they wanted to hear. Also, even though he said he didn’t have the temperament to be a therapist, he knew a whole lot about different mental illnesses. Steve was scared that he would think of him as more of a patient than as a friend.
The problem was that he would have to leave the tower to get away from them, and he was terrified of going outside.
“Steven Grant Rogers, do not sneak up on me like that!” she exclaimed, putting her hands on her hips and glaring up at him.
Tony picked up his head and looked around. Clint and Rhodey were curled around him on either side, Pepper had crawled in behind Rhodey, and Phil was sitting up against the headboard by Clint.
The suit of armor might have saved his life, but the set of wings he designed for Yinsen would have been his greatest achievement. Yinsen never got his second set of wings.
“I would show you mine, but that would include taking my shirt off, and I don’t want to be arrested for public indecency again,” Clint said.
“I don’t think you know how happy I am to not be the only couple in the group anymore,” Clint said as he leaned farther into Sam.
“I’m not worried about him hurting me. I’m worried about me getting hurt and Yzzial thinking he’s to blame. That would crush him more than anything.”
“Like this,” Tony said, opening up the suit and stepping out, completely ignoring the others’ warnings to be careful.
Clint turned around so he could throw his legs over Sam’s lap and rest his head on Bucky’s shoulder. “They are,” he agreed.
Pyziedot told him as she curled up on the couch in Tony’s workshop. The two humans were looking at something on a screen across the room, leaving the dragons to their own devices.
The guy blushed and looked around before walking up to Clint. “What can I do for you?” Clint asked, leaning over the counter toward him and smiling flirtatiously.
Bucky leaned back in his chair and smiled warmly at his best friend. “I never thought I’d ever see you acting so lovesick, but here you are, cuddled up to a gorgeous man and you have the biggest smile on your face I’ve ever seen.”
The only thing worse than plucking was complete wing removal. Unfortunately, it wasn’t illegal because sometimes, doctors just can’t save someone’s wing.
Between missions for SHIELD and history lessons on the helicarrier, he didn’t have much time to himself. He sometimes wished that he could just skip the lessons, but he didn’t have anyone else to help explain this time period to him, so what choice did he have?
Bucky tackled Steve to the ground, and the two grappled with each other, Sam laughing in the background.
“Pep, calm down,” Tony said a bit too loudly, hugging her from behind. “We’ll figure it out.” He rested his chin on her shoulder. “Rhodey’s on his way, and Clint’s calling a friend.”
“I don’t mind you not telling me,” Steve said, pressing a kiss to the back of Tony’s neck. “I knew you were brilliant already. This just reinforces it.”
Steve shook his head, then realised Sam couldn’t see him and said, “No, I’m okay. Can you send me the information?”
“Thanks, Tony,” Pepper said as she pushed Rhodey’s leg away. “Worry about your food instead of my face.”
Bruce just smiled and sat down next to Tony. “Are you okay?” Tony asked his friend, taking in how ragged he looked.
“What’s his rank?” Tony asked curiously, picking up the sandwich and starting to unwrap it. He always asked since Rhodey liked meeting new people. And it was easier to look them up that way.
Still not meeting Tony’s eyes, Clint signed, “There are some irregularities in the shipments of weapons overseas. Some of them have been marked as lost and others are mislabeled.”
“Hey there, little guy,” Tony murmured. “We’re going to get you all out of here, okay?” The dragon nuzzled his thumb, then disappeared into his sleeve.
Steve’s hand slid from Tony’s cheek to the back of his neck as Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder. A wave of warmth and comfort washed over them both and they sank into each other, Steve pulling Tony closer, and Tony burying his face in Steve’s neck.
“It’s still nice,” Steve replied as Tony gave Bucky a hug. Bucky tensed up for a second and threw a surprised glance at Steve. Steve just smiled at him and said, “Just accept it, Buck. He won’t let you go until you do.”
Zietu seemed to notice his mood and fluttered over from where she had been wound around Natasha’s neck. She settled on top of his head and nestled into his hair.
“Hi,” Sarah replied as Tony sat up, rubbing his eyes. She sat the blanket and sandwich next to him on the couch.
Clint came up behind him and hooked his chin over his shoulder just as Tony secured the outer casing. Tony spun around in his chair and reached up to place them in Clint’s ears.
“The feeling,” Charles said. “The last time it wasn’t just in here.” He pressed a hand to his chest.
Thor wasn’t from this planet, so he probably wouldn’t understand the ramifications of what Steve was doing and most likely wouldn’t judge him. That isn’t to say that he wouldn’t find Steve strange. After all, Asgardians still had wings, and Thor kept his in amazing shape.
Tony slowly moved closer and said, “Hi, big guy. I’m just going to get you out of these okay?” The dragon grunted but didn’t protest when Tony began snapping chains and straps. Finally, Tony pulled off the hood. The dragon sighed in relief, then turned to look at Tony.
Tony spun around in his chair, swiping away a glowing map of New York. There was a blinking dot over the cafe Steve had been in just half an hour ago. “Hey, Steve,” Tony said nervously, leaning against his desk faux casually. “I wasn’t expecting to see you.”
“I’m not telling you anything,” Steve said firmly. His words lost their authority when he started braiding Bucky’s hair. He had done this many times before, but this time, his eyes caught on a black mark behind Bucky’s ear.
JARVIS must have also said it out loud, because when Tony looked up, Rhodey looked alarmed. They both got up and peeked out the door of the room.
Queen dragons tend to be the ones that give the orders while the kings make sure everyone is healthy and safe. They’re also the warmest dragons because they like to curl up around the eggs and hatchlings. They are gentle creatures most of the time, and very affectionate as well.
“You three look comfy,” Tony teased, coming into the room with a bowl of popcorn. He sat down in Steve’s lap and offered him some popcorn.
The roof had always been Steve’s favorite place to go when he wanted to think. He would lay on his back and stare up at the sky, trying to get his thoughts in order.
“Oh, c’mon, Stevie,” Bucky whined, draping himself over Steve’s lap. “I wanna know about your new beau.” He paused for a moment. “Hey, that rhymed.”
Everyone looked at the door, where the voice was coming from. It was one of the meanies. She didn't have horns, just braided hair and purple eyes.
! You should learn!" Steve was commonly known for his composure, a virtue he seemed to lose whenever something was about Tony. "But no, here we are," he sighed. "And the worst is you always pass the buck to others, Tony,
Steve took a deep breath, capturing the sweet smell of rainy days, and felt his shoulders relax, his heartbeat slowing down, too. Then, he opened his eyes, not sure when he closed them, just to see Tony looking curiously at his face.
Thor looked at him. He seemed tired of Tony's antics which was weird because Thor was always the first one to follow his lead whenever he did some crazy change of plans.
Bruce breathed in and out twice, and then again, imitating Tasha, who usually helped him with new breathing exercises every time she could. A warrior that was near gave them strange looks, but he didn't ask anything when they entered the castle, who had the double of warriors, once again their armors shining and overshadowing them.
"Hey, you two! Don't get too far!" Steve shouted at Tony and Bruce, who were lurking around and capturing some weird flowers in the camera they took all the way from Earth just for it to malfunction on their very-fast trip in the Bifrost.
His heart ached – Tony knew he would feel better seeing Steve. Having Cap by his side always made everything more bearable.
The first time Steve Rogers met Colonel James Rhodes, he was in Tony’s workshop, chatting peacefully with DUM-E – because
"It's in the past now," Tony lied without a doubt. "I grew up, saw how silly it was to hold a grudge against a dead man," he blurted.
Steve, still smiling, nodded and relaxed visibly. Tony knew what was coming; after all, this was part of their daily exercises to raise morality between the team – to improve their communication
The lady laughed. "Soulmates!" She began to revolve around them, the smile never fading from her face, until she was close enough to Tony.
“We say nonsense when we’re mad,” Rhodey reassured. “You both need to apologise and talk like grown adults for once or so help me God.”
“It's going to be great,” she'd assured months ago, right after knowing about his meeting with Fury and Natasha.
"Boys," Natasha came out of nowhere, like always, covered in dirt and trying not to show that her right leg was injured. "Fury wants us at the Triskelion,
"Y'know what?" Steve said abruptly, "I didn't touch anything. I was just… taking in the environment? And those mushrooms were
Rogers looked at him – all confidence, patience, and straight shoulders, like he was giving Tony a chance to redeem himself and confess.
"As for your situation, Agent Barton," Fury continued, "we thought it was best to keep this quiet. The fewer the better."
Steve, unlike Bruce, was frozen in his place (hah!), Natasha too. They were too zen for shit like this. Too trained, too perfect. Being in a team with those two put your virtues in perspective.
Steve rolled his eyes. "That's not what I said!" He turned to look at the others, "I'll go with them while Clint recovers."
” he quipped. “Nat’s pretty scary at first... or maybe it’s just me. I'm a mess with dames," he shamefully admitted.
"When I was a kid he always showed me your movies, comics, or even some old newspaper with an article about you," he said while scrolling through SHIELD’s data, giving JARVIS the order to hack all confidential records. "Now and then he'd tell me war stories – what it was like to see you fight, to see you become what you are now, to be your friend – the usual bragging."
"Nah," Tony half raised his hand and then dropped it. "I solved it. I'm a genius, y’know," he gave Steve his best paparazzi grin.
"It was one time, Fury, one time!" Clint looked indignant. "What about Coulson, though? He knew?!" Fury didn't answer. "God, he
It doesn't mean it didn't hurt, even when Tony knew Pepper was too much for him. She was the epitome of perfection and the first line of help of Tony – with Rhodey constantly working and Happy busy trying to physically secure him.
"I don't get it," Tony broke the ice, walking around and pretending to admire the art on the walls – pretending that he didn't feel like his reactor was malfunctioning. "That's not how the future works, you know? It could happen anything, at any time – fuck, we could
Tony didn’t need to say anything. He simply took another tiny step, letting Steve embrace him, like a cocoon.
Tony, always being a man of science, convinced Bruce to rip the punched mushroom off the land to study it back on Earth or to, at least, have JARVIS scan it for a few minutes.
his teammate! While being diplomatic! He has to ask Thor what 'diplomatic' meant in Meanie 1's world.
understanding, according to the psychologist that Pepper employed. They only needed to use sentences starting with ‘I’ instead of ‘You', looking to forgive, not to blame.
Rhodes crossed his arms over his chest. “Call me Rhodey,” he requested, “at least Rhodes. Jim’s fine too.”
Tony had gone upstairs to get them some pizza slices before Bruce and Thor ate them all, leaving Steve alone for nearly ten minutes.
"You don't," purple eyes said. "Please, Avengers, make yourselves at home – with the condition of not taking our mushrooms ever again," she smiled deadly, and Tony thought she'd have a very nice friendship with Nat, who was already looking at her with a smirk and bright eyes.
“When you knew someone like Howard,” Steve hesitated for a moment, “— someone with so many ideas he could actually make true —, it was… incredible,” he murmured, melancholic, looking at Tony’s armor for a brief moment. Steve sighed. “He was always the killer diller, y’know, like in the World Exposition of Tomorrow, I was there, went with Bucky and some dames,” Tony arched his eyebrows playfully at him, making Steve huff. “Nothing serious, but yeah, he was pretty swell — flamboyant, rich, eloquent… the total opposite of myself. At the time I never imagined I’d be one of his closest friends, not even crossed my mind.”
Eyeing her warily, Steve said, “I don’t believe you, but I don’t think you’ll give me a straight answer, so I’ll accept it.”
Steve wasn’t proud of it. He was just so stressed that he didn’t realize he was doing it until it was too late.
“When you were younger, I used to think you would never get color on your undersides. After that, I thought that they would just be that white forever. Then your speckles started to show up, and everyone admired them.”
He tried to climb onto the couch with Pyziedot, but didn’t fit, so he pushed her off. She glared at him and jumped on his back in retaliation. The two scuffled for a few seconds before settling down in a tangle of limbs.
On days when Steve’s lungs weren’t acting up, Bucky would lay on top of him, his wings wrapping around them both, and it was the most wonderful feeling to Steve. Those were some of the few times he was warm all the way through.
Becca handed him the piece of paper she had painstakingly copied it onto, replicating the handwriting as best she could.
Sam’s soulmate did, still absolutely confused. The officer cuffed him and started to lead him away, but stopped when another officer came running up to him.
Once they realised what had happened, the team turned their backs to him, silently keeping watch and steering away those who got too close.
One of Tony’s hands found its way onto his stomach. “I don’t want to do that. No matter how… unexpected this was, I want to keep it.”
“Who’s Mr. Hottie out there?” Tony asked, nodding to the window that Steve was standing by. He was standing with perfect posture, eyes straight ahead. “And why does he look like a drill sergeant is about to yell at him?”
“That’s about it,” Clint replied. He was lounging back on Tony’s couch, but his shoulders belied his tension.
He didn’t cry when he got the call that his mother had been in a car accident. (Not until he hung up at least.)
“I can’t make any promises,” Steve chuckled. He felt a bit guilty for making him worry, but he was over the moon that Yzzial wanted to be near him. “I won’t be able to stand by if anyone on the team is about to get hurt. Especially not you or Tony.”
“What’s wrong?” Clint asked, grabbing his wrist and turning it over. He froze when he spotted it. “Well that’s new,” he muttered.
Tony sniffed and looked up at them. “Thanks,” he whispered. He curled up even tighter and buried his head in Rhodey’s shoulder. Pepper pressed close to his back, still running her fingers through his hair.
Tony grinned at him from where he sat on the bed. “Come on in. I have enough room,” he said, patting the blankets next to him.
There was a small pause in which the two got comfortable. Once they were settled, Yzzial quietly asked,
Sarah tapped her temple and smiled mysteriously. “Mother’s intuition.” She took the blanket out of Steve’s arms and disappeared into the room.
“Tony,” Rhodey said exasperatedly. “You can’t just decide you want this guy to be your new PA. You don’t even know who he is.”
Rhodey was visiting, and they were teaching Pepper sign language. Halfway through, she had taken off her jacket and kicked off her heels, saying, “I might as well get comfortable,” and put her feet in Tony’s lap, focusing completely on Rhodey.
Tony usually came out of his room about an hour after Steve finished. He would still be wrapped up in a blanket, bare toes sticking out at the bottom. His hair would be sticking up at all angles, and Steve always felt an urge to run his fingers through it.
“So you’re the one that has to deal with him for the next few months,” Rhodes said. “I apologize in advance. Good luck with him.”
“Yeah. I’m just tired.” Bruce leaned his head against Tony’s shoulder, closing his eyes. Pumarryn curled up in his lap, tucking his tail under his nose. They both quickly fell asleep, and Tony turned his attention to Yzzial.
Just so you know, most of the dragons are about the size of a cat. Pumarryn, Pyziedot, and Yzzial are the exceptions. Pumarryn is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, Pyziedot is the size of a large dog, and Yzzial is about the size of Toothless in How To Train Your Dragon.
Just as Steve began to get twitchy, Sam said, “Want to go somewhere there’s less people? They’re making me edgy.”
Steve felt a smile creep over his face. “Oh, I don’t know. I think Tony’s pretty cute on his own. I don’t have anything to do with it.”
“Sir, I would suggest you pay closer attention. Mr. George appears to be lying about how much his idea would cost,” JARVIS said. Well, actually, he sent the equivalent of a text message to Tony’s glasses.
“Usually, you mean,” Steve replied, eyeing Yzzial warily. Yzzial glanced at him from his perch on the couch in the living room with a toothy smirk. “Did you see that?”
At Tony’s raised eyebrow, Phil quietly said, “I came to give you a few more files, but you were all asleep.”
Bucky’s wings resembled those of a black and white warbler. His wingbacks were black with white stripes and the undersides were a soft gray with white highlights. They were the softest things Steve had ever felt, but they were sturdy, and allowed Bucky to execute some of the toughest aerial maneuvers.
Being able to fly with the suit was all well and good, but it would never feel as good as flying without the help of the stabilizers. Tony knew his flight feathers would never grow back, not with all the damage done to them. Then he got an idea.
Honor and bravery were other important traits to dragons. Once upon a time, dragons only bonded with the strongest warriors and they still took a liking to strong people.
“There is, actually,” Bruce said, pulling a flier out. “There is a program that matches pregnant omegas with a partner to live the duration of their pregnancy with.” He handed the flier to Tony before continuing. “Everyone who signs up is screened thoroughly before they can be matched with an omega. If you apply, you’ll be given scent samples of people in the area to choose from.”
“You’re only a few weeks along, so terminating the pregnancy is still an option,” Bruce said gently.
One of the braver nurses spoke up. “She was pretty rattled. We didn’t think she was up for visitors.”
The first time Tony had met Thor, he was both surprised and relieved that the god didn’t have a dragon. Then he learned that Thor’s dragon was still in Asgard because it was made entirely of lightning. “Do not worry, Metal Man!” Thor had told him. “You will find your companion. You are not defective!”
Tony was a bit thrown. Pepper was usually the one hounding him with papers. He stared at Charles for a few moments before that familiar warm feeling took over his chest, but this time, it had a bit more of a kick to it.
He just hadn’t predicted that Sarah Rogers would bake him a cake in the colors of the bisexual flag.
“Hey, Stevie,” Bucky said, smiling at his friend. “On time as usual.” His gaze fell on Tony. “And who is this?” he asked, grinning slyly.
Steve never knew what Natasha was thinking. She had shown them all her softer side in the time they had been a team, but she still kept her distance from them most of the time. Telling her could have a hundred different results, and not many of them were great.
After doing his business, he returned to find that Clint had rolled over and taken up nearly the entire bed. Tony shook his head and went closer, spying something sitting on the nightstand. He picked them up to examine them, then looked down at Clint, brow furrowed.
Sam nodded and held up his left arm, which had been around Clint’s shoulders, revealing the words on his forearm.
“Sorry, Ma,” Steve said, smiling broadly. “Need some help there?” he asked, gesturing to the blanket she was trying to reach.
He had been more upset that his newest project had been blown to bits than at the fact that his son now had total hearing loss in both ears.
The two sat like that for a few minutes before a voice said, “I hope I’m not interrupting anything, but can you please explain what is going on?”
Chiepaer eyed him before turning his head away. Yzzial took that as an invitation and laid down next to them, his tail wrapping around the other two dragons.
“Hello,” Tony’s new roommate said. At least, that’s what Tony thought he said. He wasn’t all that good at lip reading. “It looks like you’re my soulmate,” he continued with a smile.
“And I already told you why he’s needed here,” Sam added, lifting Bucky’s feet so he could sit down.
There were things about Howard that only Tony knew, but he didn’t dare tell his mother while his father was still alive. He wasn’t going to now, either. He knew his mother would be crushed if she ever found out.
Charles smiled at his enthusiasm. “Really.” He unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt to show the light blue spiral nestled in the hollow of his throat. “This one,” he said, tapping it.
Steve looked up from where he was hiding behind his sketchpad. He had chosen this bench because it was secluded. It was just a happy coincidence that the back of it was against the wall of a gardener’s building.
Rhodey moved to separate them, but before he could, the omega grabbed the alpha’s arm and executed a move that ended with the alpha on the ground with the omega’s foot on his throat.
“You can stay here as long as you want,” Tony said with a yawn. He shifted so that he was laying down and laid his head on Steve’s chest. “Just wake me up before you go.”
“At least let me get you some blankets,” Sarah said, brow furrowing. “It gets pretty cold in here at night.”
Steve padded over and snuggled in close. Ever since their small talk, Steve had started initiating contact more and more. He had been a bit worried at first that Tony would think Steve was being too clingy, but Tony would always just smile and wrap a wing around him.
Steve didn’t mind. Bucky had a tendency to do the same thing when they lived together, so Steve had gotten used to being used as a human teddy bear.
For a second he thought that he was back in his old apartment that he shared with Bucky, but then he remembered that he could never go back there again. The compulsion to pluck his feathers came back, and he had his fingers buried in his wings before he could stop himself.
Sarah started to walk toward the cafeteria, her son trailing behind her, carrying the blanket. “Where are we going?” he asked.
Just as everyone got settled, Thor came charging in. “Metal Man! You found your dragon!” He picked Tony up and gave him a giant hug.
He snuggled into the warm arms wrapped around him, fully prepared to go back to sleep, when a thought occurred to him.
Tony blasted through the door at the bottom of the stairs and scanned the room. “I’ve got heat signatures on twenty-seven dragons down here. I’ll probably need some help to get them all out.”
Completely mortified, the first officer unlocked the handcuffs and stepped away. “I am so sorry,” he said. “I just saw you without a shirt, and I thought-”
When Bucky had told him that people usually ended up with a soulmate of the gender they prefer, Steve had told him straight out that he didn’t care whether his was male or female.
Steve’s eyes widened, and his hand pressed up against his side. He walked closer to Tony, stopping right in front of him.
“I wanted to talk to you,” Tony replied, stepping into the room. He noticed that Steve was carefully keeping his front to Tony.
“Hey, look at me,” Tony said sternly. Yzzial lifted his head but refused to meet his eyes. “Do you know what Steve is going to say when he wakes up?” Yzzial shook his head. “He’s going to apologise to you for not getting there quick enough to stop that.” Tony pointed to the thick bandage wrapped around Yzzial’s tail.
After a few long minutes, the glow faded, leaving Steve laying on the ground, utterly spent. Bucky helped him sit up while the team watched worriedly.
Rhodey shrugged. “You never know,” he said. He slung an arm around Tony’s shoulders and pulled him closer. “You could have asked me to do this Alpha thing.”
Steve stared at him for a second before picking up the fork. He ate quietly, letting Tony fill the silence with chatter about the new projects he was working on. Their wings brushed occasionally, and for the first time since he was unfrozen, Steve felt content.
“We have time,” Tony signed, snuggling back down under the covers. He reached out and grabbed Phil’s hand, rubbing the scent gland on his wrist and planting the hand in his head.
“I don’t understand it fully myself,” Steve admitted, stepping aside so Tony could sit in the armchair beside the couch.
“As a fetus is growing, hormones from both the mother, or father, in your case, and from their mate help speed up it’s development. If there aren’t two sets of hormones, the fetus may not develop fully.”
Tony turned to the rest of the people at the table. “Oh, alright, you big baby. This is Steve, everyone. Steve, the baby is Sam Wilson, the one in the corner is Bruce Banner, the gorgeous lady is Pepper Potts, and the platypus is James Rhodes.”
“Is this seriously all you’re bringing?” Bucky asked, nodding to the boxes he and Steve were carrying. “And why does he not have to carry anything?”
They locked eyes over Steve’s head and Clint nodded before extracting himself and leaving. Steve whimpered at the loss of contact. Tony shushed him and pulled him closer.
“I have a couple of friends that I would like Tony to meet,” Steve replied thoughtfully. “But probably the most important would be my best friend.” Steve thought about it for a second before saying, “He’s more like my brother, actually.”
Sam glanced at them quickly, already knowing what they said, but his eyes were drawn to the words on his collarbone. “You have two sets, too?” he asked.
Steve rolled his eyes as he pulled his shirt off all the way. Tony’s eyes fell on the words that swirled up Steve’s side.
Steve stopped in front of the couch, took Tony by the shoulders, and spun him around to face Bucky. With a mischievous smile, he said, “Buck, this is Tony, my soulmate.”
Rhodey’s eyes widened. He looked down at the marks. His own mark rested over his heart, a perfect diamond in dark blue. Tony’s mark, a small red circle overlapping a larger circle, took over his other pec. On his ribs there layed two marks, a small, pale orange sunrise and a darker orange heart.
“Captain Rogers?” JARVIS said once after a particularly bad day. “I know it isn’t my business, but I think you should tell someone what is going on. Your stress levels are much too high even for a superhuman like you.”
The other man laughed and pulled him into a hug. “I didn’t think so either, but I managed to shift around some lessons.” Steve could just make out the edge of the man’s words peeking out from underneath the neckline of his shirt.
“Mama, Mama! Look!” A young Tony Stark ran into the kitchen, where his parents were sitting at the table, Howard reading the news and Maria enjoying her coffee. “I got my words!”
“Is that what that feeling was?” Tony asked out loud. The other boy winced at his volume. “Sorry,” Tony said, trying to be quieter. “Being deaf kind of ruins your sense of how loud you are.”
“Here you go,” Clint said, sitting a cup on the table. “I read that coffee was bad for babies, so I brought you hot chocolate instead.”
“Why don’t we get you to bed? You could probably use a nap,” Tony murmured. He pulled Steve up and led him back to his bedroom. Steve curled up on the bed when they got there and fell straight to sleep.
Sam grinned and pulled his right arm out from under the table, turning his wrist so Steve could see the words.
“We’re going to go get some food for a patient’s son. He was stuck out in the waiting room for over 24 hours, and I don’t think he ate anything that whole time.”
Tony had to physically pull Yzzial away from where he had Steve pinned to the floor. Once he did, Pyziedot stalked over and cuffed the bigger dragon over the head.
Tony’s hand came up to cover the one on his cheek as he said, “I had almost given up on finding you.” He sniffled. “A lot of people call me ‘Mr. Stark,’ you know.”
“Steve has always beaten himself up if anyone gets hurt even a little bit when he was close enough to protect them,” Tony said, tracing a scale on Yzzial’s snout. “And he’s definitely not going to be happy that you’re laying on the floor in front of his hospital room door instead of panicking on that couch over there with me.”
Steve and Bucky came up behind them just as Natasha unlocked the last cage. Pyziedot ambled over and wound around Tony’s legs as Chiepaer landed on his shoulder. Dragons had always seemed to like Tony, especially those that were bonded to his friends.
“Ryn, please get off the poor dragon,” Bruce said quietly. Pumarryn jumped off Yzzial and shot toward his human. Bruce caught him with one hand and stroked his back with the other. “Sorry about that,” Bruce said to Yzzial. “He’s a bit excitable.”
The first thing Tony learned (after he got over the shock of having a freaking KING DRAGON claim him as his own) was that Yzzial was very, very, very protective.
Bucky leaned into Sam’s side, watching Tony and Rhodey bicker good-naturedly. “These are good people,” he said quietly.
Steve went over to the door and put a hand on Pyziedot’s head.  He reached for the door knob, but before he could reach it, a deep voice growled,
Tony tapped the side of his glasses in acknowledgement, and started to actually read the words that showed up in his glasses as Mr. George was talking.
Pepper, Rhodey, and Phil seemed to have disappeared, but Tony wasn’t worried. They were all busy people and they probably had better things to do than lay in bed all day. Tony nuzzled the top of Clint’s head and began to extricate himself, finally heeding his screaming bladder even though he wanted to stay where he was.
Steve jolted, head snapping up from where it had been bent over his sketchpad. “What the hell are you doing?” he asked incredulously.
Tony leaned back against him briefly and said, “You charmer.” He turned around and looped his arms around Steve’s neck. “Come here.”
“I’ll tell you inside,” Steve said, brushing past him and dragging a reluctant Tony into the apartment.
“Okay, now that that’s done,” Bucky said, flopping onto the couch dramatically, “someone explain to me why it’s necessary for Steve to live here for the next few months.”
His fingers hit a small rough spot under one of the feathers. He moved the feather aside and saw a tiny scar.
But, every time someone said those stupid words to him as a greeting, he had to excuse himself so he could quietly cry in the bathroom and curse the universe for giving him such generic words.
Thor took no notice of what was going on behind him as he found a place on the floor to watch the dragons from. There was a childlike glee on his face that could warm even the coldest heart.
The first time he refused to build the Jericho missile, they kindly treated him to a dunk headfirst into a bucket of water.
“You have that one too!” Tony signed excitedly before pulling his t-shirt up to reveal the same design on his ribs.
The only problem was that, lately, Tony had been acting like something was bothering him. He was twitchy and had been getting progressively grumpier as the days went on.
“Well, I bet she’s just fine. How long have you been here?” asked Sarah, removing her hand from his head.
Sometimes the innate knowledge that someone was your soulmate took a while to kick in. Tony hadn’t really had that problem until he met Charles.
Every time he refused after that, they plucked out a few of his flight feathers. Soon, he didn’t have any left, and everyone knew that the next time he refused, he would lose a wing.
This thing between him and Steve was new, and they hadn’t talked about it yet, so Tony didn’t really know what to call it. Whatever it was, Tony liked it. He felt safe around Steve, and even more so when they were cuddled up like this.
“Whoa, there, big guy,” Tony said, taken aback. “I know I’m wickedly handsome, but aren’t you moving a bit fast?”
“I did.” Steve walked over and hugged Tony, wings wrapping around him. “I appreciate you looking out for me, but this was a bit much.”
“Tony? What’s wrong?” Rhodey asked as he was changing his shirt. He waved a hand in front of Tony’s face.
Pepper touched the back of his neck and slid a piece of paper in front of him. In her looping handwriting, it said, “Your pen tapping is getting louder by the second.”
Steve nodded, slightly surprised, but followed Sam when he got up and began making his way down the path.
Pepper leveled him with a look. “Sleep. Now.” She grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the workshop. They went up the stairs, past Clint, who was passed out on the couch. Pepper dragged him toward the bedroom. “Go.”
“You’re not forgiven, because there’s nothing to be sorry for.” Steve smiled up at him. “I chose to save you. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“Steve, this is Tony. Tony, this is Steve,” Sarah said, then stepped out of the way, a knowing smile on her face.
“They’re just a baby,” Tony whispered, gently stroking the silver spiderweb that had just appeared. Tears started to fill his eyes as he cradled his wrist to his chest.
“You didn’t even do anything,” Steve said, swatting the back of his head. “I’m the one that put everything away.”
“Really? Good for you!” Bucky was genuinely happy for his friend. He himself had gotten his words the year before. They ran up his side in a single line.
Clint pushed himself up onto his knees and wrapped his arms around Steve’s middle. “It’s alright, man. Just let it out.”
“Geez, warn a guy, would you” Bucky said before reaching out to touch the words on Clint’s collarbone. “
Steve rolled his eyes at them and exited the elevator when the doors opened. Knocking on the only door in the hall, Steve called over his shoulder, “Would you two stop fighting and get over here?”
Tony waved his hand nonchalantly. “Don’t worry about it. Think of it as me repaying you for keeping Yzzial occupied last night. He tends to fall asleep on top of me, and he’s way too big for that to be comfortable. Dottie is much more polite.”
Steve’s wings were way too big for him when he was younger. He would always trip over them or knock into things, he wasn’t strong enough to fly with them, and holding them close to his body made his shoulders ache.
At the beginning, there had been a lot of teasing from Clint and Bucky, but things had settled down now. No one seemed to mind their new relationship, and Tony was glad. He didn’t even know how he felt about it yet, so other people judging them was not something he wanted to deal with.
Studies showed that the primary causes of wing plucking was stress or loneliness, and God knows Steve has both in spades.
“See for yourself,” Steve replied. He pulled up his shirt slightly, and neatly emblazoned on his hip bone was one word:
Tony’s finger shook as he pointed to the marks on Rhodey’s chest and ribs. “I have all of those,” he signed.
One of the worst punishments a person could be subjected to was a wing plucking. It was illegal in almost every country due to the emotional trauma and lasting health problems associated with it.
– had tried to kill Steve. Obviously Tony shot. It wasn't even the most lethal repulsor charge; he hadn't wanted to kill her, Tony just wanted to stop her.
Tony faded out her voice. He felt the others slowly leaving them behind – even saw Bruce looking his way twice, before closing the big, golden door.
Being in a superhero-band-that-saves-the-world thingy wasn't in Tony's bucket list. Honestly, it was Pepper's fault.
Before doing something ridiculous (like getting down on his knees to give Steve his thanks for being so nice), Tony fished for conversation.
“’Kay, ‘kay,” Clint gave up, leaving his phone aside, “just let me finish this disgustingly-raw beacon and I’m on it.”
"I have already done that, sir," JARVIS informed. "It appears that Captain Rogers is in no danger. His pituitary gland is sending off more hormones than the average. He is also reacting to a high level of dopamine and other substances operated by the limbic system."
“I already spoke with the Director,” Thor answered in a mouthful. “We can use the Bifrost this very afternoon to get things done.”
An alien invasion? In plain May? Shit. SHIELD didn't pay him that much. (In fact, he isn't getting paid.)
Thor was instantly at Tony's side, scratching his hair like he always did when he knew he fucked up.
Steve looked at him like he had no clue what he was talking about. Maybe he didn't. Did he even understand new slang? Going by his outfit, Tony wasn't so sure. But, God, he was
After that (and one Star Wars' joke – yeah, Tony did that one), Fury knew about the hacking and everything was fucking mess. Steve and Tony had an epic fight with Thor, they captured Loki and zombie-Maria-Hill infiltrated,
Tony saw Clint still whining about not meeting Captain America – Fury's face blank – and decided that he wanted to go and see what the fuck was a cosmic cube and why SHIELD was experimenting on it.
"But," Steve continued, "realizing he gave up years of his life for me… I— I don't even know how to feel," he muttered. "I know it isn't my place — to tell you anything — and I know we're not that close, not yet, anyway, so I can't ask you details, plus, the little I know was because a third person told me," Steve smiled deprecatingly. "I understand how it feels, though, believing —
“Oh buzz of Rhodes.” Rhodey gave a hearty chuckle and pressed a kiss on top of Peter’s head. As Peter’s godfather, Rhodey made sure to visit when he was off duty and this meant spoiling the boy rotten with gifts.   Peter adored Rhodey.
“You need to build relations in the team and what better way than to share sharing living space, besides I wanna see what school is like,” Peter explained “Real school dad, not homeschooling… don’t give me that face." Tony pouted, he has no idea where the years have gone, it seemed like it was just yesterday he had a wriggling baby in his arms.
T’Challa had put his trust in Tony, the king had asked Tony to be one of the leading player in introducing Wakanda’s vast technology to the world and that meant that Tony had approval to learn everything tech in the kingdom, which was awesome, but on the Downside Tony knew he would have to face Steve sooner rather than never.
Tony was going to a meeting with Ross when he came face to face with America’s National icon. He didn’t know how to react.
“Don’t you dare do that dad,” Peter said as he snatched his math’s book from Tony’s hand. They were in the lab, Tony was tinkering while Peter was doing homework and talking about his day.
Now, he was in this supermassive building of this super-secret organization (of super boring agents) waiting for the scolding of the year. They were seated in the meeting room waiting for Fury. Beside Steve was a very angry looking Maria Hill, who, surprisingly, had civvies instead of her Catwoman suit.
"I didn't know," Tony talked, feeling his heart rate speeding up. "I'm sorry. I will leave it right here–"
"Don't worry, Shellhead," Steve said, grabbing one of Tony's hands and looking at him like he was the most precious person on earth. "If this has happened to you, I would've protected you. Like I always do, sweetheart."
Tony laughed drily. "Amazing. But I think we can't stay much longer," he faked a sad face, "we have… duties to make, to-do lists,
Tony just raised his left thumb up, "We fine!" and continued to look curiously at the plants, hurrying Bruce to give him
sound and Tony entered, one plate with four pizzas on each hand and a very happy Thor behind his toes carrying two of those disgusting sugar drinks.
"No, it's OK," Steve reassured, smiling tightly, "you're right. It wasn't fair. You— you didn't deserve to live up to some stranger. I understand how it feels, though — thinking nothing is enough."
Tony let his hands fall from his chest – he was carrying the mushroom like a baby, out of sight, not with the intention of hiding it but trying to not let it fall.
“We can leave at three o’clock,” he said, “Clint, can you call Fury and Maria to let them know? We need support if things go south.”
And no, Tony wasn’t blushed, it was just the sun entering through the big windows, reflecting on his skin.
“Can we do a livestream while we travel through it?” Tony asked abruptly, earning a look of curiosity from Thor and Bruce.
"You should be the Avengers warriors," one of the Vanir approached, his voice raspy and his eyes clouded with distrust. "Please, follow me."
"How dare you!" she shrieked, making every single warrior stand in a pose of combat, drawing out their swords.
“Ain’t nobody asking you to do that,” Rhodey muttered. “Just… Try to understand him. Remember he’s being on edge since–”
"I'm sorry too. I shouldn't– I shouldn't have lost my patience like that," Steve said earnestly. "I also want to apologise for the things I said. I was… I was mad. Don't know how many times I've said this, but I admire you, Tony, and I know you do take accountability for everything, even for things that don’t correspond to you.”
"See? That's why I hated you when I was a child," Tony huffed instead, looking at the table, and then at Steve, angry, not hurt.
"Breath, Brucie," Tony made circles in Bruce's back. "We're just going to apologise, and that's it, we're gone."
"I wanted to apologise for the fight," Tony blurted, earning the attention of everyone in the room. He gave them his paparazzi smile. "I honestly don't have the medal for Best Teammate Ever. When Thor let us know about your traditions, I wasn't paying attention," the Vanir raised their brows. "
Rhodey’s laughter filtered through, then a sigh. “And I expected more maturity from a genius, but we can’t always have what we want, right?”
