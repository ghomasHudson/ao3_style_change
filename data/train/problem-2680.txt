Startled but trying not to show it, Dean paused in his perusal of the menu (and in trying to think back to his one month of French like two years ago… he vaguely remembered something about
Grumbling, Castiel pushed himself up to sit at the side of the bed and leaned over to hide his face in his hands. “Why couldn’t I have been an only child?”
Rolling his eyes, Benny stood up off his stool and stretched. “Brother, tha’s what gets you in trouble: dat ass.”
A large graying Kodiak bear stood at the edge, its eyes white with age, shook its head at them, and then he lumbered back into the forest.
Like the twins, Castiel was dreading Michael’s return home although it was for different reasons. The twins hated how uppity Michael got. Castiel disliked how competitive he got.
In his third form, Gabriel was relatively short, with his nearly white-blonde hair brushing his ears, and he looked human with his well-worn jeans and bright yellow ‘eat this’ t-shirt with an arrow pointing at his groin. Well, until you looked into the glowing golden eyes and the fox-like features, and then there was definitely a feeling of unease.
He detached his lips only to find Cas had covered them with his wings, and he gently tugged one down to eye his brother.
Not surprising, the tiny tenement room is filthy, with newspapers used to make bedding and clothing stuffing. They're both surprised the whole place hasn't gone up in flames when it's evident the tenants had been using candles to heat tinned food and keep warm. The nasty, cheap kind of candles too, the sort that stink of petroleum and stain everything black.
He's finally released a week later, into Sam and Bobby’s custody. He's walking, but it hurts and he doesn't have a lot of endurance.
Dean could tell that Cas could no longer take it when he pulled Dean up and kissed him hard, the word “Mine” resounding through the bond. Cas rolled Dean on top of the table, changing their positions, and flaring his wings over them again. “Cas,” Dean gasped, as slick fingers probed his hole, and Dean knew that Cas had coated them with wing oil in order to cover him with as much of his scent as possible. His feathers were dripping in it and sweeping over Dean’s body like tiny paint brushes.
Dean disregarded them and, his hands clenching and unclenching, he uttered, “Cas is gone.” The incredulous look on Bobby’s face and the worried look on Sam’s did nothing to ease his distress.
She pointed at the map and the spot Bobby had pointed out. The areas where there had been yōkai attacks had been clearly marked in red, with hauntings and other phenomena (like betobetosan attacks, which were just annoying) were marked in blue. She pulled out a black marker and started to draw on the map revealing the pentacle, and then several smaller markings outside the pentacle, marking it with sigils.
The next three hours passed with a moderate amount of harassment. His ass was groped a couple of times, his crotch grabbed once. He was forced to sit in Michael’s lap once, tugged down by his belt, and just… fondled all over.
Dean scoffed. “I might not be the brightest bulb on the tree, Cas, but I sure ain’t the dimmest. Something hit me and if it wasn’t you, what was it?”
He had to knock on the door a few times before a tired looking Joshua finally opened it, releasing a puff of warm air that felt good on Sam’s cold face.
There was a low rush of air and a brief bit of smoke that caused Dean to cough hard. “What the shit?”
“This is a purity cup,” Cas said from Dean’s shoulder. “Robert Singer concocted it for me before he left.”
Dean swiped his face with a damp hand, relishing the slight cooling effect, and blew out another irritated sigh. He knew from Sam’s sniff tests that his scent had improved a lot, whether it was from the Thrall working or from hanging out with Michael. He had no idea, though, how much longer he could put up with Michael’s possessive grabbiness. He had allowed the Alpha to kiss him a couple of times, but mostly goodbye after a fun evening. Although it was evident Michael wanted to push for more, Dean was not a typical omega. Michael had earned a black eye the one time he had tried to insist.
And Dina did. Her hair was smoothed over her head and swirled into an elaborate updo, her makeup emphasized her smoky quartz eyes and full lips that most of her children had inherited, the elegant lines of her red dress fit her impeccably, with simple diamond drops at her throat and ears, and her wedding band as her only jewelry.
The club stopped as the red guy (in a damned Red Wings hockey jersey) tried to bring it down, and Akira’s strained, “NOW, DEAN!” made it obvious this was his chance.
As they walked to the church a few minutes later, Sam kept looking over at Dean with concerned hazel eyes, sipping on the hot chocolate Dean had bought them from a nearby café.
Sighing, he cleaned his plates and made sure there was enough in case Dean got up hungry, brushing his teeth well, and crawling into bed to think some more.
Sam started and checked the time on his phone. “Oh, shit. Yeah. Let me go get them in a bit. I just want to finish this talk with Castiel here…”
He stabbed a finger at Castiel, who had settled on a low branch and gave every indication that he was squinting at him. “You will grant me some respect for knowing about things you don’t know, and I’ll fucking respect you for knowing shit I don’t know.”
Akira pointed to the spot between Cas and Gabe, while his moose of a brother was helping hold up the whiteboard so everyone could see it. She made some noise to get everyone’s attention.
Joshua was sure to keep Castiel under constant surveillance with Sam, adding Kevin as a buffer and watchman. They were both eager young men, with Kevin contemplating the priesthood for himself. He was only thirteen himself, so Castiel didn’t push the issue or discourage it. If he received The Call, he would know.
The week of the Christmas party, while cleaning up dinner, Dean ‘fessed up to Sam. “I’m thinking that you’ve guessed by now that I’m
Gabriel crunched his candy and eyed his brother who had his plotting face on. “So, what’s the plan?”
He had a few customers, but his scent was apparently off and they quickly fled. When Crowley showed up and took a sniff, he wasn’t happy. “Jesus fucking Christ, Squirrel! What the hell happened to you? You stink like rusting tin and burnt sheets!”
(鬼 "demon/ghost/ogre/troll"): The kanji for oni can mean a lot of things, so it gets translated into several things. In this story, they're ogres.
All that did was make the frothing-wall-o-alpha curl into himself, gagging, and trying to breathe, as Dean had hit him neatly in the solar plexus like John had taught him.
“It’s fine. She reminds me of someone who is just the same.” Dean chuckled. He took a sip of the tea and it was hot, black, and had a somewhat smoky flavor. Although he wasn’t a big fan of tea, it was hot, and he was, at his core, still freezing his gnads off. Cas’s hand stopped him from taking another sip, as Abram was regarding him with a bemused expression  that sort of looked like, “American weirdo,” and said,
But, just as Dean started to stand, ready to go find Bobby and find out what the hell was going on, the bird flew at him like a Hitchcock nightmare, pecking and scratching at his head. He slapped and started to howl at it, when the living room light snapped on and Bobby stood in the doorway.
himself out of bed because he was afraid of his own body, afraid of how much his Omega screamed and yowled for its Alpha. It scratched and bit at his psyche, making Dean miserable physically, mentally, and emotionally. It split his head with a hideous migraine and made him vomit out bile and foam into his trash can. He suffered from a horrible fever that froze him to the bone then felt like he was being napalmed from the inside out. It was worse than any heat he had ever endured, but there was no sexual desire, just pain and disorientation.
“Fine, but I’m coming with you,” he said, looking to the guy for confirmation. His suspicions were roused by the tense expression on the guy’s face, but then Sam, the evil little shit, turned those sad puppy eyes on the guy and Dean tried not to grin as he watched the fellow give in, deflating like a balloon on a hot day.
Dean shuddered again with the cold and ran his hands over his arms. Michael’s frown intensified and he pulled off his coat and offered it to Dean. Dean eyed it. Michael was still wearing a corded dark gray sweater that looked very warm, so Dean took the coat and slipped it on, relieved by the still-trapped warmth.
Obviously carefully choosing his words, Dean replied, “I work maintenance at the trailer park and I work at a bar at night. Our Dad sends us money when he can.”
The reply startled Dean and he huffed out a softer, “I’m sorry, man. Just nerves, y’know? Thanks for helping me out.”
“Seeking out the dead and creeping into houses?” The brothers exchanged looks. Benny leaned forward and said, “That does not sound like much of a life.”
Dean snorted as he stepped more fully into the room. “I don’t know what you mean. I’m a joy to be around.”
But the best thing about his place is that the building is owned by his Uncle Bobby, so he gets first pick of which digs he wants to live in. He’d probably get a discount if he would just bow to Bobby’s desire to have in him the Organized Crimes Department with him.
Dean blinked hard at the bird, his own head tilted slightly, as he wasn’t quite sure what he was hearing. The raven cawed harder, making it sound a bit like a cough, and firmly said, “Please open the window. I have need to get out.”
The moment their mouths had touched, Dean had moaned in surrender and pushed back against him. Castiel started as Dean kissed him back, the warm lick of Dean’s tongue against Castiel’s lips maddening. He groaned as he allowed Dean in, and his warm tongue invaded Castiel’s mouth eagerly.
Now, there was a reason why Colonel Robert Singer had not been promoted in the main office, despite his longevity and efficiency. The reason he was given his own small command in a different building, on the other side of Downtown: he failed to play the sycophant game.
Not that the troll was able to say much, as the swarm descended on him with malicious glee, punctuated with shill laughter and tiny sounds of bows being drawn and arrows shot. “Fuck me!” The troll grunted heavily and raised its arm to protect its eyes from fairy darts. “Ya wee bastards! Jus let me find me pest spray!”
With morale already low with the first group of missing people, and the group’s collective failure was crippling. It was an unforeseen blow to an already traumatic battle. They tried to rally, but it was difficult.
Gabriel narrowed his gaze at Dean, who was trying hard to look as inoffensive as possible, and backed himself to the altar to snag the tray of Inarizushi. Dean hadn’t known what those were, and had been surprised that sushi could also be fried tofu pockets around a ball of sweet sushi rice. Castiel and Bobby had had to let him stuff his face until he was satisfied, he liked them so much.
While he was standing there, stunned by the sudden change in the man, Sam stepped between them, throwing his arms out, spread eagle, like his skinny thirteen-year-old body was going to stop a pureblood Alpha from holding Dean down and knotting him right there on the lawn. At this point, Dean couldn’t even run, knowing full well it would trigger the Alpha and just Make Things Worse.
He followed his nose out, wondering what smelled that delicious, to find two young men fighting on the church lawn. The younger one was lanky and obviously still growing into his own. His jeans were faded, worn, and a bit too short on him, the softness of baby fat was still evident around his face. Long, brown hair swayed as he yelled at the other, pointing fixedly at the church. The other young man had much shorter, blonder hair. He was taller, and his frustration was evident as he gripped his head and let out what Castiel suspected were a stream of swear words. He even recognized some of them.
It was a reprieve from God that his father was out of the country for some stuffy clan-Alpha meeting, while his mother had taken the week to go to Sweden and enjoy the saunas with five of her best Beta buddies. Gabriel actually had a commission due. He had made his name as an artist, and he was often called upon to design sets and paint gorgeously realistic backdrops for plays.
Today, Dean had peeled off to work on the car the moment they showed up, leaving Sam to barge into the rectory, excited to start practice. Sam was making his big debut Sunday and he didn’t want to make a mistake.
“Does that mean I can’t take naps?” Dean looked horrified, sitting up on the couch, his shoulders tense.
to stay on the premises, help clean the building, help out with the advertising, and essentially work for their upkeep (they didn’t all have to prostitute themselves). For their own safety, Crowley allowed them out to the movies and such only when accompanied by two or more trusted alphas, like Benny, from his personal security force.
He smiled softly at the frown on Michael’s face and stood up. “Oh and if you don’t mind, could you order me whatever’s the closest to pie? I think it’s that tarte thing…” He winked and swanned off to the toilet, leaving Michael frowning at the menu.
Sighing, he walked the small path and tried to keep himself from showing he was nervous. These not-dates were getting more and more serious. He really didn’t want to indulge Michael more than he had.
“What the actual fuck?!?” He sputtered, squinting at the fucker who had essentially sucker punched him. It was the bitch from the football stadium. Rubbing his cheek, he grumbled, “Oh it’s you again. What the hell, lady?”
“Uh, we can’t. We, uh… got money from the school to study.” Dean remembered this was a thing from movies, and he hoped he was pulling it off. “Look, we can’t just beat it yet. Besides, it sounds like you folks could use some help.”
Besides, after the alpha attack, he was wary of letting his kid brother wander around. Some alphas didn’t give a shit if a hole was unpresented; they just wanted to fuck something.
Humans, after all, had finite luck that kept them alive every single day and that they didn’t think about. The tiny bits of luck that they didn’t choke on a large bite of food, or that got them to work without incident. The luck that guided them down streets without falling headlong into traffic or cracking their heads on rocks that killed them. The luck that let them breathe without incident every single night of their lives, when death hovered most closely, waiting for that clot to strike them dead, or the heart to lose its spark. Finite amounts of luck that was doled out until they died, that either helped them avoid falling drunk into a river or that suddenly sputtered out and let them sink into that cold, wet death like a dream.
Dean whined faintly, somewhat distressed in his nudity, and tried to move his aching body towards Cas, hoping he wasn't about to be rejected again.
Shesh shrugged and took another sip. “It’s the name of the bear mascot at the Russian Olympics,” he said slowly.
“Assbutt?!” Dean grins and avoids snickering just because his side doesn’t appreciate it, stabbing him with lightning bolts of pain.
There were four alphas lounging on the couches, a bevy of omegas swarming over them, giving them massages, complimenting their looks. One of the alphas was dark haired and lean looking, his eyes a nice blue hazel, who was speaking to an older, balding alpha who was not aging well, the bags under his eyes and the weaselly expression on his face genuinely unappealing. There was an alpha with chestnut blonde hair and cold eyes, her nails perfectly manicured, looking out of place in her very expensive-looking business suit, and she was watching the pole dancers like she wanted to skin them. To her side was handsome blond alpha in a V-neck shirt, dark jeans, and snake-skin boots who leered at the dancers, while keeping one of the young male omegas in his lap, his hand roaming over the young man’s waist and legs. Dean was pretty sure the omega’s name was Kenny. Maybe… Lenny?
He looked down at the two men, discussing the texts on the desk that he had eyed before flying to a safe distance. He could vaguely feel the faint discomfort that Dean felt at his distance, and the 'oh well, he’s a bird, what do you do' feeling that stopped Dean from thinking on it too deeply.
Michael made demanding motions with one hand, while using the other to take a sip of his coffee, and Castiel stifled a sigh and handed over his book. He wasn't disappointed by Michael's condescending response.
Sam turned bright red, his entire face crimson, and although Bobby was a man of the world, that was something he had never wanted to hear from his foster son.
Gabe yawned and scratched his belly, saying through the mouthful of M&Ms he had been chewing on, “I think Akira’s got a plan. The woman’s a firecracker, that’s for sure.”
: This was something asked by my betas. As in all things, there are two minds about this. In more modern times, it seems as if Buddhism is thought of as not recognizing “sins.” But this is not true of all Buddhist sects, and, in fact, if this were true, there’d be no tengu, according to the lore. According to yokai.com: …[in] Buddhist lore, tengu are born when a person dies who is not wicked enough to go to Hell, but is too angry, vain, proud, or heretical to go to Heaven. The tengu is a personification of those excessive vices, magnified and empowered in a new, demonic form.
The brothers looked at each other again, and Dean suddenly missed his little brother, as they smiled at each other and then smiled at him. “Our youngest brother had to leave the village.”
Unable to help himself, Dean bared his neck and Cas mouthed over it, nipping hard enough to bruise, one of his hands pinning Dean’s wrists over his head, while his other hand pulled Dean’s naked hips to his. The feel of Cas’s cock against his own was mesmerizing, smooth and hard, and just for him. Cas had never been with anyone. He was his alone.
“It may go against the grain” Akira had said, her caramel colored eyes intent, her polish-free fingernail poking Dean in the chest for emphasis, “But you
Dean blew out a frustrated sigh, rubbed his gloved hand over his cold nose and lips, and muttered, “I have no idea what that even means…”
“I believe we can leave this like so,” Cas said with pleasure in his tone. He seemed to smile, something not readily evident from his beaked face, and Dean realized that, somehow, in the past 48 hours, he was learning to read the bird very well. It was weird.
“I mean my literal ass,” Gabe chuckled with a wink. “Here, for the slow ones in class… let me show you!”
The walk to the church was pleasant, seeing as the autumn weather was cool but not cold. A slight breeze ruffled their clothes and hair, and they enjoyed themselves, Dean making crude jokes about sex and Sam crying out in disgust and smacking him.
More slowly, Sam said, “I, uh, I want to stop by that Catholic church.” His hands twisted in his lap. “You know… the one by the park?”
Dean was well aware that Samuel Winchester was an enchanting young man. He could tell that Cas enjoyed speaking to him. After all, he was bright and inquisitive, asked interesting questions and wrote down things he thought were important. Sam also liked to read history books and old literature, and he and Cas ended up talking for a few hours before Dean couldn’t stand the low-stirring jealousy in his guts.
Then that traitor Sammy fell into a food coma on Missouri’s comfortable couch, and it was game and match.
Bobby replied, “The legend is that the baku is a creature made of odds and ends left over from when the gods finished making all the other animals.”
“Well,” he said more loudly, “I’ll keep looking things up. I mean, you said Feathers thought it was rabies?”
He was frankly beautiful, almost haloed in the refracted light of the room’s tiny chandelier, but all Castiel could think was
“Dean, you can’t just give up like that! Just because there’s no one in the rectory, that doesn’t mean there’s no one in the building.”
popped out on its own power, flaring out its canopy as it came at him, a huge eye twinkling with mischief and a long red tongue wiggling from one of the panels.
Abram, who had moved back with his buddies to drink and talk while they ate, again sat near them, this time Benny coming with him. Benny, it turned out, was shorter and stockier than his brother, having a large paunch that he occasionally rubbed affectionately, as if it were his buddy. His own unruly head of brown hair was like a bird’s nest along with his giant beard, making him look remarkably like a much shorter Hagrid. Nika, Lev, and Klim stayed at their table, nursing their beers and discussing taking a sauna at Klim’s house later, since it was his turn.
He cautiously walked up to the backdoor, which was hanging a tad open. He stepped in and heard a low chanting in a rasping voice that made shivers go up his spine. As he approached what he thought was the living room, the voice stopped, but he could see a vague shadow of a tall winged man up against the opposite wall. He again cursed his lack of weapons, and realized he had been trusting bird brain to protect him somehow. He had never done
Sam had had a rough two weeks. In the two weeks since his brother had called him, he had had to rush all his projects; get special permission to leave because of a 'family emergency'; and run into a ton of Shintoists, Buddhists, and even a Yin-yang master. But the weirdest thing, he thought, was his brother and the tengu.
Dean leaned forward a bit to watch the man’s reaction, and, sure enough, he woged in agitation, black fur sprouting all over his face, neck, and arms. The woge revealed his badger-like features, the short, flat nose and a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth. His ear elongated and sharpened at the tip, and his lightly fisted hands grew large claws.
“Hey, Garth,” he greeted as he headed up the sweeping stairway to the second floor. The brothel area was a split-level to keep things under control. The first level was administration and where most of the omegas Crowley kept were housed, with one door in and out. The upper level was for the Omegas who could handle themselves. They essentially rented their own room, the payment coming from their wages. Crowley controlled everything else, making it the safest place in the building for omegas: no weapons allowed on premises and only designated people behind Garth’s window, where the omega dorm’s doorway was hidden.
Seimei, the Japanese version of Merlin, showing up. That was like aiming for a sugar cookie and ending up with wedding cake. “They like you,” she had said, shrugging.
shut up,” Castiel grumbled into his palms. “I’m having a crisis and you two yammering on is driving me mad.”
Dean snapped to it. “OH, you mean the salvage yard!” He scowled at the thought of all those cars coming back to life with tongues and eyeballs. It was creepy and he shuddered. “Yeah, glad we missed out on that.”
Dean turned to look at his little brother for a second, as he pulled a plate out from the cupboard. “Pfft… C’mon, Sammy! I can get up for this.” He set the plate with the egg and two bacon strips on the table and nudged Sam knowingly. “Besides, I don’t want the trailer to burn down. That’s important.”
He shrugged. “That is a Ninlchik word for ‘den’ that they took on. When we Russians came in the 17th Century, we took too much game, we made them leave this lands, something that Jägerbar hate to do because of their ancestor worship.”
“I ask assistance for our relative, our ancestor’s kin, Akio, also known as Gabriel, who has made a contract with Dean Winchester to save this world from doom. I ask this in Abe no Seimei’s name, and pray that Seiryu on the East, Byakko of the West, Suzaku to the South, and Genbu on the North guard and reinforce the barriers built to hold in the damages that will be done today, in the name of humanity.”
Dean grinned up at him and changed his movements from pure panic to just smoothing over Cas’s warm skin.
“Seems like we have some of those missing people here.” He scowled at the heap, and, eyeballing a male corpse that was relatively fresh, stared at the stump where its head used to be. “Cas, I’m thinking it had to be Wesen to do this.”
Bobby pinched the bridge of his nose and huffed, “I might be able to get this to the lads, but that don’t mean they’ll listen to me. They run in some pretty deep pockets nowadays.”
,” murmured the blonde guy. He flicked his ice blue eyes over Dean’s body, leering as he eyed over the black leather pants. He unceremoniously pushed the purring omega off his lap, who landed with a grunt and swung angry eyes at Dean. Like it was
Shifting slightly from side to side, Cas said in a tight voice, “Even in that form, I could not hit you on the back.”
The blond dude peered out the window, squinting at the tinted glass. He scuttled across the limo, and muttered as he pulled up Dean’s hood, “That’s $4000 of fur. Don’t mess it up.”
And, after the bear-skin had been prepared, the shaman and his friends quietly went to the man's hut and placed the skin under the man's pillow. They hid themselves to see what would happen when the man went to bed. They watched the magic work upon the man, and did nothing, content with their deed. It was as such that, upon waking, the man found that he had become a huge bear with a white face and white feet."
Bobby sat back and reported his findings, which included a college kid who would never drink again, a bruised up woman who swore an Asian woman saved her, and a grossed out medical examiner, who said in twenty years of working for the SFPD she had never seen three people in three different spots turned into gobbets of flesh and clean bone. Bobby added, “I saw the bodies and they were picked clean, just white bone was left, and the rest of them was tucked into large ziplocks looking like so much stew meat.”
It was literally one examination room and an area in the back for autopsies if needed. At least the doctor had a proper refrigeration unit set up, just in case.
“He… he expressed a desire to nap. When he is tired, he likes to drink coffee,” he mumbled. He took the tin between his wing-hands, trying to hide it, and shuffled sideways, away from Gabriel. “I… I just thought to be useful.”
Castiel just turned back to the bead and they had a conversation in low voices, where in the middle of which they both turned and eyed Dean for a moment, and the bead was saying things that sounded seriously unflattering from the tone. Cas puffed up for a moment and said, “Enough. He is my partner for this venture. He must adapt.”
Dean pulled out a huge package of ground beef, but since it was something for all the people coming in, Cas advised him to go veggie. And, although he wrinkled his nose in disgust, Dean started to make vegetarian spaghetti for twenty people, muttering that he was glad he had prepared for this by going to Costco and buying in bulk. There was a companionable silence between them while Dean chopped garlic and green peppers, and he finally broke the silence by asking, “Cas, are you okay?”
He decided to skip classes, because he just didn’t understand what was going on and this seemed important somehow. Dean didn’t act like that ever, and if Sam needed to lie to Dean to help him, then so be it. Even if that meant sneaking into Dean’s room at 7am and turning off his phone because the school was going to call him about Sam being absent. He’d try and delete the voicemail later, if he could figure out the phone lock, but Sam was betting on it being [IMPALA].

Benny was starting to look agitated. “And then Katia died, and the attacks stopped for a bit, so we wondered if it had been her, which is blasphemous! She was a pious woman and a good wife! She died in her bed, just like Daniil, rigid and damp.”
Still, those third-level house omegas were lucky. Crowley often adopted male omegas right off the street because they were the least wanted designation.
She licked the blood off her claws and smiled at him triumphantly, eyes gleaming with madness. “I guess I’m not the only one to lose something precious.”
Dean shrugged it off and tried not to roll his eyes. “Yes, sir. As I said before, Rocky.” He used the moment to pull his hand out of the Alpha’s grip and pointed at the gold badge on his vest that said in square letters “ROCKY.”
Pureblood Omegas are strong-willed as hell. They have the physical strength to take on 2nd and 3rd level alphas, so they do whatever they want. They are not easily claimed (or sold off), so alphas need to win them or be their true mate. That is a one-in-a-million shot, though, so the few pureblood Omegas in the world run their own businesses and compete with the big boys. They give no shits about societal norms for the most part, but tend to be treated like society's darling. They are able to produce pureblood and second-level off-spring, possibly as many as six to a pregnancy, although they typically have triplets. IF you can mate them.
All of you who encouraged me, THANK YOU SO MUCH! I means a lot to me. It really does. I had a shitty month, what with... things... happening. And me being in the middle of some... uncomfortable things in the fandom. So... again, thank you.
“It doesn’t matter. The situation is grave enough that we need him (Dean) to help us. If what he (Dean) says is true and the virus is killing not only Wesen, but those same Wesen are killing Kehrseite in their madness… Benny, we are treading a thin line here. The Grimm may have to kill some Drang-Zorn to save the village. We don’t even know if Nikolai has informed the Wesen Council about the illness, and he will have to once it’s known Kehrseite have died.”
Any other questions, go ahead and ask! Or if there's something in the world building you're curious about, feel free to ask!
“You can’t hide here forever, you know?” Michael finished off his coffee, and Jo reappeared to refresh both their cups.
So today, Castiel was reading a theology book in the breakfast nook, just off of the small hothouse his father had had installed last year. This particular hothouse was used almost exclusively for exotic flowers and rare plants, whereas the large greenhouse was used for winter gardening and keeping down the House’s produce costs.
“Obviously,” Cas deadpanned. He slowly turned and eyed the forest, the sound of running water nearby and the crunch of leaves under their feet. “Looks like we found all the people Louhi and Ajatar took…”
He was surprised at how easily both boys responded, especially Dean since he really seemed not to care one whit about being an altar boy.
He disappeared and Castiel coughed. “Um, he’s spent a LOT of time with humans. He loves this millennium.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t count me out just yet. And I have help.” Akira grinned making a hand motion and keeping Eve’s attention on her. Behind him, Dean heard Sam chanting something, and he tried not to act
He winked and waited on the patio for them to come out, both boys looking amused, even as Abram shut the door behind them.
: Capitalized Alpha/Beta/Omega is second-level or higher. Lower case alpha/beta/omega is third-level or in general.
. Following that was the aching hollow that ballooned up and out from his core, the usual heat stored there simmering lowly as if conserving itself.
Cas jumped onto his shoulder, and Dean yawned as he marched them downstairs. He saw Bobby was at the kitchen table, drinking a mug of coffee. After he let Cas out, he wandered over to the kitchen and found himself a mug and a hot cup of mud that Bobby passed for coffee. It was delicious.
The rooftop, now that Dean had time to look at it, was mostly flat with the air-conditioning units to one side. It seemed the owner had wanted to make sure there was a helicopter pad, which left most of the rooftop bare. On the western side, a completely naked Eve had set up the altar with a circle and glowing, white sigils painted into the black roof. On the altar was a dead woman, her body spread open like a dissected frog pinned to a board, with what looked like her heart, liver, and a bowl of blood offered up.
Sam huffed out more laughter but then added, “Seriously, though, Bobby… don’t tease them. It took weeks of Cas not just
Dean stood up, stretching. “Yeah, that’s a good idea. I’m tired. Let’s get him home, and then I can read these notes later.”
Tonight’s prey had been reported by the Chinese while they were out looking for the new kijo. They had been hot on its trail and had had no time to deal with the annoyance of a brand-spanking new yōkai. They had spotted the yōkai when one of them had been chasing any stupid joggers that thought their health was more important than their lives.
Sniffling hard, Dean swiped at his malfunctioning nose and forced himself to concentrate on getting home.
He had a definite destiny, he knew. He had been given a vessel made by earth from The Garden, and it was given life by His Father’s will. “Take care of this vessel,” Joshua had told him, patting his shoulder gently. “It will serve you well, and I suspect you will use it better than most.”
Her face paled with every word and she glared at him with every bit of force in her now-glowing omega-gold eyes. “You’ll regret this. If you do not walk out of this restaurant and walk away from him, I’ll make you pay in ways that you can’t imagine.”
So if HELL, was for the commoners, and Purgatory, as the brothel, was made for executives, then the slickery/entertainment palace was named HEAVEN, and was actually even higher class and only for the highest rollers.
“Um, well, Gabe,” he started. (Castiel panicked. GABE? Did he just call him GABE??) “I broke the Yumekui thing, and Cas and that Baku chick popped out, and Cas said he’s not powerful enough to stop her alone and we have no holy weapons, but Cas here said that you were a mensch and you’d give us a hand.”
She smoothly moved closer, her hair swaying, her white face narrow with her black hair framing it, such a contrast to those plump, red lips, slanted obsidian eyes, and cute short nose. He stood up, the alcohol making his movements jerky, and awkwardly adjusted his clothes. “Hey,” he said softly. “'re ya doin' a photo...photoshoot or som'thin' nearby? Tha' ou'fit is aw'some!”
Cas started hard, breaking his stare at Dean, and, with his beak clicking shut, he emitted an aura of extreme embarrassment. He shuffled back so he could see both hunters, and he muttered, “Uh, no. I’m fine, thank you.”
They both staggered to their feet just as a similar-looking man to the red bastard walked up, this time with light blue skin, blue hair and ice blue eyes. They were both easily eight-feet tall, and just built like brick shithouses. Dean saw the guy’s foot pull back and braced himself for the kick by curling into a ball.
A shower later — where the hot water suddenly ran out in the middle of his ablutions — a disgruntled Dean wandered downstairs. He glared at the raven sitting in the middle of the table, eyes closed, feathers ruffled.
When Dean was fourteen, he couldn’t stand Sam’s crying into his pillow with hunger anymore. He couldn’t. John had gone off to find a man guilty of murder and hadn’t returned in a couple of days. They had no money; what they had had gone to the motel room costs, paid in full until the end of the week.
Dean huffed and licked his lips nervously, not missing the way Cas’s eyes followed his tongue as it swathed across, his hips grinding up even as Dean bore down. “This. Give me this heat. This rut.”
“Ah.” Dean eyed the guy. The shorter stature, the slim build, the gold eyes… Dean would bet he was an omega. “Is your brother also an omega?”
: Betas don’t have strong scents themselves. They do have one, if you’re a pureblood and able to sniff them out, but they mostly do not.
She stretched her neck out, closing her eyes, and ignoring Bobby’s sharp inhalation and low-level cussing, while Sam was confused.
Sam was talking fast, ridiculously fast, as they walked to the church in the November weather. “Can I try on the alb? To get used to it? Can I?”
“Cas,” Dean whimpered, as Cas sucked on his bottom lip, running his thumb over their heads in a rough circle, holding them up as their cocks rubbed together. He moaned as Cas nipped at his jaw, gasping as he sucked hard behind his ear.
The drive over to Purgatory was not very far, but for some reason it had Dean thinking about Father Castiel. The first time they had met, he had been shocked/terrified by the presence of a pureblood. It was like accidentally walking into a yeti on the street, in his opinion. No one let a pureblood just... wander around and become a
Dean popped another one, shaking slightly as a rush of pre-heat flooded his system and made him want to strip back down to absolutely nothing. He was going to burn again. He was only on the cusp of heat and it felt ready to burn him deeply, possibly completely. He saw Cas gaze at him a moment, red still threaded through blue, and the scent of rut delicately drifting to his nose, delicious and everything he wanted in one sniff.
He pondered for a moment whether or not he should reach out to his brother. After all, they had not parted on friendly terms—not by any stretch—and Michael was likely to still be extremely angry over Dean’s abandoning him. Not like “True Mates” wasn’t a good extenuating reason, but still..?
“When she turned evil, she began to eat the good dreams of humans, as well as their hopes, wishes, and fantasies. Humans are meant to dream, and they will suffer from the lack of dreams and go mad.”
“Ha ha, very fucking funny, guys,” Dean groused. He shook his head at Cas surprised expression. “I’ll explain it later.”
Dean chuckled against Cas’s diaphragm, leaving small bite mark against the smooth pale skin, and nuzzling his way down.
The riverbank was narrow and covered in rounded gray pebbles. It stank of mold and old mushrooms, with the stones touching the water slick with black slime that neither of them wanted to touch.
. For weeks now, Michael had been plying him with gifts and demanding his time. If the Alpha hadn’t been located in St. Louis, Dean’s life would have been unimaginably awful, and the sheer fact the Alpha
They talked for a while more about requirements, and Castiel set up a time to practice with the boys.
“Anna, Greg, Feliks, and Ed have all been found dead, either bitten to death or just bit of their clothes and large puddles of blood being left behind.”
Because he was close to his heat, he knew he was probably attracting them. The smell was undoubtedly clinging to him a bit, and he was just wearing a t-shirt and a Henley in the quickly cooling weather.
He threw himself backwards against the couch and slapped his hands over his face, grunting out his frustration, and rubbing his eyes. He then pulled them down to cover his mouth, rubbing his mouth with the palm of his hand.
Dean moved to the carrots, onions, and fresh basil, his cutting hand fast. He continued. “Gabe said I should ask Gen — uh... the dream dude — but I wanted to talk to you first.”
The feedback of Cas’s pleasure seeped into him even more; it curled around his prostrate now and tickled him there, much like he was sure Cas felt how hot and just
Cas reached over and took his hand, slotting their fingers together. Dean squeezed it in understanding.
“I swear to GOD, Cas, I might not be able to get one in on Gabe, but I will smack you into Chinese New Year!”
Gabriel grinned unpleasantly, although he eventually caught the guarded expression on Dean’s face, and pointed at the table. “He made you a sandwich and some coffee.” He turned the digit on Dean. “
Unable to take it, Dean suddenly pushed Cas back onto the wide, pine coffee table and watched his wings flutter to try and keep his balance. He looked down at his angel for a moment, spread over the light wood, the firelight flickering over his taut flesh, and throwing shadows onto it. He grinned wolfishly at the site of his angel displayed in front of him. Cas was beautiful, his eyes dark and trusting, his wing tips curled towards Dean.
He unlocked the Impala, tossed his bag onto the bench, and slid into the driver’s seat, knocking his head wearily against the steering wheel. “Fuck…” he whispered, tears welling up. Frustration surged through him and he slammed his fist against the steering wheel a couple of times, snarling, “Fuck,
Most people would have put that down to being beaned in the head with a baseball, but this late in the game — what with the tripping, the nearly drowning, salt getting mistaken for sugar, his burgers always being overcooked, the consistent lack of hot water or, more so of late, too much hot water — he was used to the constant tolls on his body.
“God, smells so good,” Michael mumbled against Dean’s neck, nosing at his jaw, his body heavy on Dean.
Bobby grumbled under his breath, knowing there was no helping it, and there was no way he was paying all that damn money for 200 channels of nothing he didn’t have time to watch anyway.
After Castiel had told the twins about Dean, Lucifer had hummed and seemed to sink into thought, but Gabriel had immediately started grinning slyly and nudging him knowingly.
Dean tried to scramble in the direction of the sword, but she stepped between them and roared her conquest, leaping towards him with intentions of shredding him to bits. Dean closed his eyes and cringed back as he was about to get a face full of claws.
“Because the hunters who had chased down her family in China had followed her to Japan.” Cas settled in the middle of the table, feet tucked under him. “She was part of the original candle of baku.”
One of them, Castiel figured, had to be an alpha to lift Dean like that, though. No one built small and slim could have lifted the
Guilt flickered over Jo’s face and she shook her head. “You’re too much, Castiel. I don’t know how you’re even related to this family.”
Cas pulls him in gently by his overcoat with his free hand and gives him a chaste kiss on the lips that still manages to get Dean’s sex drive going from Neutral to Third Gear in nearly no time at all.
But, seriously, Cas had chosen a place with a lot of Wesen without consulting Dean. Suspiciously, Dean asked, “Do you know what
Akira slammed her small hands down on the desk, ignoring the piles of books and maps that was taking up space on it. “But the lore says that’s dangerous. The tail on its own is capable of doing monstrous things!”
priests. They are barely men and should be prosecuted by man’s law.” He rubbed his nose and sighed heavily. “The fact is, Sam, if
Regardless, the rectory had also become his beacon of hope because Joshua had unveiled the Studebaker.
Dean gives him a grim smile and they head back to report in, leaving them to clean the mess and wait for the coroner. Meanwhile, they get to go back to the station and file the paperwork.
He saw Cas approach and smiled, intercepting his direct route to the coffee maker. “Nuh uh,” he said, grinning at the dark look Cas leveled at him from under black lashes. “I said I have a
“I don’t work upstairs,” Dean replied. He pointed at his clothing, which, at best, could be called casual wear. “I don’t have the clothes for it.”
He didn’t relax when he recognized Castiel, and, in fact, seemed to become even more wary, snapping close the hood of the car as he swallowed hard and stared.
Cas sighed heavily, shutting his eyes and relaxing his chin onto his chest. He looked a bit pale under the white light, the shadows from his lashes making them appear longer against his cheeks. There were bags under his eyes as well, Dean noted, and he wondered if Cas had stayed awake to protect them… or from guilt? He hoped it wasn’t guilt; the thought made him anxious.
She unintentionally sucked in a breath at that and looked horrified at the news. Her eyes grew wide and, if possible, she paled more. She turned to the children and told them something that made them look at Dean and Cas with wide frightened eyes and run away towards the trees like a monster was behind them.
Instead, Castiel grit his teeth and forced a smile. “Oh, yes. Dean and I know each other quite well. His brother is an altar boy at St. Thomas.” He forced himself to turn towards Lucifer, who actually cringed at whatever was burning in Castiel’s eyes. “His brother is a good kid. I believe he wants to be a lawyer like you, Lucifer. Perhaps you can chat with him sometime?”
The ship’s captain, an old guy named Bogdan (Like seriously, what was up with these names?) watched Cas with a sort of bewildered fascination, obviously never having seen someone not nearly catch their death of cold while hurtling over the ocean at thirty-odd knots. The wind was with them, at least. In contrast, Dean was hiding in the wheelhouse so he could keep an eye on Cas but not have that same wind slice him like a country ham.
Although the humans might have missed the tiny smile Castiel was wearing, Gabriel could see it. “Either way, it’s what I want, Gabriel. I won’t regret it.”
“S-should we go in?” Sam asked after his turn at the telescope. He was looking vaguely uncomfortable as Gabe had decided to sit
While he's riding his desk, Crowley gets knocked off by some mysterious highbinder, most likely for the Chinese hit. Either way, it's one less worry for Dean.
?” He pushed himself forward, to put one foot in front of the other, and grumbled, “Stupid fucking bird! I told him to not do that! Why doesn’t he ever listen to me?!”
The fact the dark-haired and blue-eyed man had that base-note rotting-meat Alpha-pong was enough to make Bobby want to poke him with his cane.
, Castiel had been taken aback. Even more so, the sound had curled around his heart and taken root there, a small feeble desire to hear more growing within.
He had focused on that happy face and had calmed his nerves in the shower, scrubbing away at his skin until he had been nearly rubbed raw from the rough washcloth.
He heard Bobby sigh and retake his seat, the sound of his slurping making Dean reopen his eyes and look over. Bobby slowly said, “A baku is technically from China, but from what I understand from my research, they were hunted nearly to extinction because having a baku pelt was good luck and kept away bad dreams.”
Staring back at her, Dean took an impolitely big gulp of orange juice and even let some dribble out the corner of his mouth to be hateful.
Smothering his desire to growl at the man (and maybe break his nose), Dean grimaced at being trapped between the guy’s arms as Michael shifted and moved into his personal space, bracketing him. It forced Dean to lean back against the bar to keep his space and made the smooth wood of the bar dig into his back as Michael leaned in close, stinking of arousal.
“Dean, your luck is going to get progressively worse,” Cas said mildly, looking down at Dean from between his knees, the sense the bird was grinning pervasive. “I would keep the hysterics to a minimum.”
The bird squawked, and Dean could hear it hopping heavily on the desk. “That’s exactly what I am! As expected of an esteemed hunter like Robert Singer!”
Dean pried open the refrigerator and found there were still eight eggs left and enough bacon for breakfast and maybe BLTs for lunch. He asked Sam if that were cool, and, although he was something of a health freak, Sam really couldn’t say no to a BLT.
Cas looked over at him with sympathy and suggested they visit a store to purchase him a heavier coat. Dean had rarely heard such a good idea in his young life.
Both Bobby and Dean blinked, having missed the fact that the bird was speaking English. Well, that was all Dean ever heard, so it didn’t surprise him, but Bobby looked impressed.
Gray-blue eyes watched the bird hop up and down, until, finally, Bobby bowed and said something in a language Dean didn’t understand. “Bobby?”
Indeed, the cloud of armed and armored pixies was buzzing around the gnome-baby, poking it with their spears and making it shriek and squeal. A larger pixie, the size of a Barbie doll, ululating a battle cry before setting off a set of arrows that struck the black thing in its red eyes.
Sure enough, the pixies wrapped the gnome up and, between three of them, easily hefted it up and flew away in formation.
The troll ran away with most of the pixies pursuing him, their wild laughter only slightly dimmed by a new roar from the dragonet. The last few pixies ignored the roar, eyed the dead gnome baby, and seemed to have a conversation before one pulled out some fine thread.
The bartender for the private bar was a slim, tall beta he knew as Jake, who was assigned the room because he looked pretty harmless, but he was actually as strong as most alphas. He helped keep the room in order. He was also a nice guy.
“Well, the swearing part is spot on,” Dean snarked, and received dark look in return. Dean shrugged and pointed at Gabriel.
Dean internally groaned. “’re you fakkin’ kiddin’ me??” He grunted as his lungs took another hit of the vicious odor, shook his head vehemently and took a step away, even extending his other hand out, as if to guard against the putrid concoction. “’at s’it fakkin’ reeks! NO WAY.”
That was usually the optimal question. Until Dean had started working in Purgatory, they hadn’t had much money. Some days, it had been just slightly stale bread from the discount bread store. Other days, it was eggs and bacon, or even pancakes.
Dean just blinked owlishly through it, and, at the end, “So if I run out of luck, I die? Like stupid die? Like some sort of video game, falling-off-the-edge-because-you-can’t-tell-and-splattering-on-the-cobblestones die?”
but Sam pulled the puppy-dog eyes on him, and he started to feel his resolve failing. He spluttered for a moment, but then opened his mouth again to shoot down the idea and Sam upped the ante: the trembling bottom lip.
The fox bowed exaggeratedly and said, “Bobby Singer, renowned hunter of the supernatural. Word is you did a couple of years at a small shrine in Nara.”
While they spoke, Dean searched for Daniil’s chart, not finding it in the drawer. He started looking around the doctor’s desk. “And then who died?”
Sam fidgeted a bit, averting his gaze, and then, looking at his lap where his hands were knitted together, he mumbled something Dean didn’t catch.
“Until something better appears, I guess.” His eyes flick to Dean's mouth. “But there are very few things that could
Turning his head so he could roll his eyes, Dean coughed uncomfortably and said, “I wasn’t told, and I’m not exactly dressed to go anywhere fancier than a bar or maybe a diner.”
Crouching, he eyes the first body, a young woman, maybe in her mid-twenties. She had probably been pretty while she had been alive. Unfortunately, the weather’s just warm enough to promote decay and bugs, and her brown eyes peer sightless back at him from red, swollen flesh. The awkward angles of her joints could be from rigor mortis, but if she hasn’t been moved, it’s more likely caused by whatever killed her.
Pastor Jim was an old friend of John’s, back from his Marine days. He had come back from ‘Nam full of repentance and became a man of the cloth to make up for his days of death and destruction. He had PTSD and a quiet drinking problem. He ran a small soup kitchen and donated time to veterans at retirement homes. He was a good man.
While Sam looked completely confused and Dean swore at Gabriel and Ichiren-Bozu, Castiel was plotting their deaths. Painful deaths. Humiliatingly painful deaths. Possibly to do with zombies.
Joshua sat back in his seat, expression hooded as he observed the two. Castiel, who was generally considered unflappable, even robotic by a few detractors, was bright red and flustered, denying any intentions. Castiel, who was known to wade in first and without an issue into a sea of omegas in heat that would have driven other alphas mad, was acting volatile, and—even to Joshua’s inadequate Beta nose—the faint scent of distress, arousal, and nervousness was wafting off of him. The Omega smelled angry and on edge, but there was the faintest curl of arousal there too. If they weren’t fighting, Joshua wondered what they
, Dean thought, which was as coherent as he could get as Cas pushed down and gyrated, causing himself to shudder and clench around Dean. Cas was hot inside, grace tingling around his cock like the faintest of electrical charge. It made him want to push up harder. But Cas hadn't prepped himself and Dean groaned at how tight Cas felt. He gripped Cas’s hips with frantic fingers, desperate for
“Ha ha ha! Ah, you’re such a child, Cassie. Fine, I’ll go watch over your lover boy. And stop getting all embarrassed and red. You weren’t all embarrassed and red when you were licking his tonsils under the cherry tree.”
“Bitch,” Dean said, sticking out his tongue and took Cas into the kitchen. He set the very-ruffled Cas down on the chair and started to make dinner. In his giagantor-bird form, his facial expression was easier to read, and right now it was confused annoyance. Dean just grinned at him, winking as he pulled out pots and pans to prepare the meal.
He petted the raven on the head, and stood up to stretch, ignoring the small shocked pool of embarrassment that was Cas.
He quickly dialed on the elderly black office phone and settled himself better into the desk chair, drumming his free fingers on the wooden desk nervously as the phone rang.
“Dean,” Cas said slowly, as if speaking to a particularly slow child, “That is not a pig. That is a tapir.”
When his half-hearted shoves finally moved the fur blanket off of him, he was suddenly sure he had heard a huff from it.
Instead, he frowned and reluctantly nodded, curiosity beating irritation, since those green eyes sparkled at him with amusement. Dean smiled fondly and pulled Cas in tighter, using his small height advantage to bend Cas over his arm and kiss him deeply. Cas grabbed the back of Dean’s neck in panicked response, but it was soon soothed by the feel of those soft pink lips on his and Dean’s very talented tongue.
The omega must have seen the red bleeding into his eyes, because he growled back, baring his teeth and not backing down. But, like a fog, the scent of arousal had curled into the scent of anger and rebellion, like hot chocolate with a hint of cinnamon. The omega’s hands were clenched at his sides, shaking, as if he were forcing himself to stand his ground.
Castiel turned to face Dean with a very serious expression and bowed slightly. “I apologize for my underling’s behavior. He is a very good servant of Buddha, but I fear I allowed him to watch a bit too much human television.”
Itchy-wren leaped off his palm and webbing spat out from one of his holes, covering the umbrella like a net. The bead made a sound like it was sucking up noodles, and the webbing suddenly got tight around the umbrella, and it began to wiggle like a captured weasel inside the web.
Getting into the penthouse was the first legitimate hurdle, of course. So, when asked point blank, Gabe finally admitted that he
Before he headed back to Sioux Falls, Bobby had called Sam too, and told him to find some Shintoists from some of the California shrines because it was getting down to the wire. He also contacted the two master Onmyōji he knew — one in San Francisco and one in New York — because all the other “Yin-yang masters” were just Feng Shui charlatans who would just get eaten in their hemp hipster clothes. When they needed to know where to stick a mirror to fend off bad luck, they’d find one of the asses. The one in San Fran, however, refused to come. Thankfully, the one in New York needed only a few days to get things prepared.
had the biological right to take everything away from Michael, and he knew it. Even with The Call burning in Castiel’s veins, there was also the fire of a pureblood Alpha lingering there, waiting to take over. Waiting to
I was given. Not a general need for a cleansing wand on a regular day. Might be in the trunk I had the tsunesō in…” He paused in the doorway to watch Dean, and wasn’t surprised when Dean immediately jumped on Castiel.
Benny snorted with derision, “They worship false gods and practice heathen religion. We cannot tolerate them.”
(鵺 "White's thrush/Chimera"): [CREATURE] The nue has the face of a monkey, the legs of a tiger, the body of a Japanese Raccoon Dog, and the front half of a snake for a tail. In some stories, it is the harbinger of misfortune and illness.
He also realized there were some giggles and stares, and that he hadn’t noticed that, when he stretched, his t-shirt had risen, revealing his abs and hipbones. He blushed, but managed to smirk and a wink at them, internally groaning at the bright burst of feminine giggles it got him.
Castiel whirled and found Father Joshua standing in the kitchen’s back entrance that led to the garden, with an oversized squash and an amused expression. Although Father Joshua was a bishop, he eschewed wearing the titles and the airs.
She puffed out suddenly, her hair fanning like an opened umbrella, but Dean didn’t let that stop him as he twirled and swung the sickle at her, feeling the solid hit through the chain. She yowled and grasped her side where the blade was carving into her, a viscous black goo seeping out. Her form flickered for a moment as she staggered, trying to grasp the weapon, but flinching at how it burned her hands. She yowled and backed away as she tried to pull herself together, long nails scraping and burning at the holy wood of the sickle’s handle.
He walked out of the church and back towards the rectory, and, as he reached the door, the smell of horny and angry alphas struck his nose. It worried him because it was wafting from where the garage was, and Dean was alone.
The guy chuckled at Dean’s expression, and said, “Sorry, man! I’m in a rush. Mother will have my head on a pike if I’m late. Lucifer Novak. I believe you’ve met my twin, Gabe?” He held out a hand for Dean to shake.
If possible, it made things worse, and only Lucifer’s firm grip on Castiel’s bicep kept him from just attacking Michael right there.
“Alright, well, let’s do this. You two bring him here, but don’t tell him exactly what we think is going on. We’ll all talk when he gets here. Okay?”
Gabriel teased finger wiggles over Castiel’s ribs, causing Castiel’s breath to hitch. “C’mon, Cassy. We can
Bells jingle to announce their entrance and Cas looks enthralled already. The diner is all red and white colors with shiny chrome accents, doubling as a soda shop after three, when the kids get out of class. They slide into a booth and continue chatting about things. Cas likes reading and music. He's been reading some fancy foreign authors and John Steinbeck. Dean admits to checking out some guy named Mickey Spillane because his little brother thought he might like it. Mostly, he reads Asimov and Jules Verne, although recently his partner had given him a book of short stories by a guy named Ray Bradbury that seemed interesting. He doesn't admit to his Astounding Science Fiction magazine addiction because he's not a dope.
“Probably not the best idea, is what I said.” Castiel scratched at his beak with a black claw. “You have less luck than life force. That might kill you faster.”
This is a thank you to all those people who asked for another chapter! Please keep commenting; it encourages me to keep going in my times of darkness (AKA: Grad school).
Mark drunkenly smiled back at her, liking how her dark eyes gleamed like obsidian orbs his momma wore like pearls to church in the low light of the park lamps.
When they got home, Dean shook his head like a dog, trying to clear the muffled feeling, as he made dinner for the night. The stir fry was okay, considering he couldn’t smell it, but Sam seemed happy with it, so he deemed it a success.
Abram nodded and Benny grinned at Dean, all teeth and beard. “We have a lot of time before the sun sets. But the air will get colder the longer we wait.”
Sam snorted. “Dean wouldn’t let you. He was serious about the True Mates thing. He just got more and more temperamental the longer he fought it.” Sam stuck his hands out defensively. “I was not getting between them. Cas is trained in Savate and used to work for the Russian Police.”
He hung up, leaving Castiel scowling at the dial tone and his uselessness in waiting for his big brother to save him.
“She could have warned a guy,” he muttered as he turned around and waltzed back to his room, bitching under his breath the whole time about women not warning a guy about an audience, and how was he supposed to know that there were a bazillion people downstairs.
“Oh, you might be right! You can just barely smell them!” More sniffing and another bout of (uncomfortable for Castiel) silence, before there was a sharp, painful poke to his side that Castiel did slap at, and then a hard shove as Lucifer roll him over and Gabriel leaped on his waist, the two ganging up on him to pin him down.
Dean slowly lowered his third flute of champagne from his mouth and held back the huge resigned sigh he wanted to release.
“Well,” Cas muttered, “With both our weights, the duffle bag, the fact we aren’t going to be able to build any height for my wings, and that we’re going to be chased by gods know how many homicidal pixies who are made for speed… yes. I think. I think we can make it on a long glide.” He licked his lips nervously. “
Her slate gray eyes raked over the man, and it was almost like hearing nails on a chalkboard, it was so visceral. Without a single trace of emotion, she said, “Balthazar, you’re getting in the way of my getting my drink. Keep it up, and I’ll fuck you in the corner like the little bitch you are.”
They all looked to each other and nodded, and Dean climbed up the ladder to the rooftop first. He pushed the heavy metal panel up and cautiously looked out. The chanting was hella loud, now, and there was a definite buzzing like a million helium balloons had been charged with a million amps of static electricity.
Bobby sighed heavily and slapped a hand to his forehead, dragging it down to his mouth and scratching absently at his beard. “You broke the Yumekui,” Bobby said slowly.
The young woman hesitated and then woged back to her human face. Her lips were pressed into a tense line, but she nodded and said, “You can come with me. We will see who we will see.”
Grunting, Bobby agreed, then pulled the small fabric bag with the blonde hair in it out of his pocket and dropped it on the table. “And this is..?”
The brothers grinned at him knowingly and slapped him simultaneously on the back. “Da, the clinic. Let’s go!”
There was a snort somewhere to their collective left and a tiny fox was sitting on the desk, its tail briskly wagging back and forth.
At least that comfort had be there until—at age fourteen, with a howl and the sound of every bone in Castiel’s body snapping into new positions like crushing rice crispies under hand—his baby brother had gained the genetic privilege to deny Michael everything he had ever thought he had deserved.
“I don’t know why I wanted a PhD,” she groused. “I’m constantly stressed, my diet is coffee and bad snacks, my skin looks like I’m in my 40s, and I haven’t gotten laid in more months than I care to admit.”
He smiled, thinking about his possessive angel, and yawned widely, trying out a stretch. Sure enough, there was just enough room for his head and maybe half an arm stretch.
He heard Dean swallow nervously and was glad they managed to locate his duffle bag after some shifting of leaves. He looked more at ease with his machete in hand. “So, what? These are his kids out to find a snack?”
Dean shrugged. There had been a brief discussion in the car about whether or not they needed to involve John, but Sam, like Bobby, was worried about John’s ‘kill first, ask later’ policy regarding the supernatural, and he had ended on, “I also don’t think he’d be too happy about you swapping spit with, y’know,
pleasant way. He nipped Dean’s inner thighs, making him squeak (in a manly way), and leaving a trail of bites from his knee to his hip before swallowing him down again.
Benny nodded. “Karp and Lilya are both in bed. They are sweating, and refusing water and food. They had those seizures, but they are fine now.”
Reminder: Capitalized Alpha/Beta/Omega is second-level or higher. Lower case alpha/beta/omega is third-level or in general.
He pushed back sweaty hair off his forehead, thinking randomly he needed a haircut, and focused again on not collapsing to his knees. Last time he had done that, Gabriel had attacked him from behind and left a nice set of claw marks that had sent him reeling into the dirt in pain.
Of course, his mother was standing in the hall entrance, staring at them. Castiel shrugged as Jo stood at attention, and said, “Jo and I are as close as Hael and I.”
Because of that, when he had arrived in the very early hours of the morning, Castiel had skirted the main entranceway and the huge hall by sneaking in through the servants’ entrance, which led through the kitchen, and had practically tiptoed his way to his room, praying his mother (if home) was asleep somewhere and wouldn’t sense him.
Sam threw a bitchface at him and he backed off, “Okay, alright! Yeah, I can’t, Sam. As much as I’d rather stay home to hold you down and rid you of that Guinea pig you got growing out of your skull, I gotta get the hours, just in case something happens.”
“Maybe, but you’ve been doing this shit for over twenty years, and it never occurred to you that you needed to clear it out now and again?”
He shook his head and tried to clear the pheromones, just as there was a resounding slap that made him look up, startled.
Akio v. Gabriel: To clarify, Akio is Gabriel's Japanese name, which means he can be summoned by it. He doesn't like that.
Gabe sat in his tiny fox form and watched the tengu hiss his way through some of the wounds. He shook his head. “This is ridiculous. I might not have the bond you have, but I am bonded to the guy. I can do it, just for tonight.”
It was unfortunate that the Winchester townhouse was so close, seeing as he hadn’t enough time to brush off his annoyance. He was giving off the stench of anger, if the way the crowds avoided him seemed to indicate anything.
The bird flapped its wings a touch, looking pissed. It hopped up and down, and hissed, “Impudent human! Can you not comprehend the magnitude of yo —”
The best part about unsolved tragedy was that people loved to talk about it. He opened his mouth to ask another question, when a bowl of steaming soup was put down in front of him with a resolute snap. He looked up at Liza (?) and she said with a grim smile, “Sir, your food will get cold if you wait too long. Shchi waits for no one.”
“WOULD YOU PLEASE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ELSEWHERE?” Frustrated, Castiel reached up and snagged his pillow, slamming it over his head and hoping he would suffocate than deal with the twins a moment longer.
Dean reached the edge of the water just as Cas flapped open his wings to gain some altitude. The air was so very heavy on his wings, and he fought to stay aloft, even as the pixie swarm began their assault on him. He felt the prick of elf-shot as he continued to dash forward, swooping down just enough to grab Dean by the underarms and yank him viciously across the water.
him with their eyes, but they couldn’t smell him at all. Most of the time, even with scent blockers, some scent filtered through. But Dean had started spritzing himself down with scent neutralizers because he didn’t think he could stand another day of people gagging and kids staring at him like he was Quasimodo. That’s what happened when he forgot to take an early dose of scent blockers.
second-level Alpha, his body slowly changing back, as a few people cried at how frightened they were, while a few whispered about how glorious a
When he woke up the next morning, he found he had received a phone call from Michael, which he ignored, and that he had slept another 12 hours. He crawled out of bed and, finding Sam sleepily eating cereal at the table, he asked, “Do I still stink?”
The duvet smelled like dust and he coughed into it, deciding not to move when he heard the door swing open and a smooth, warm voice murmur, “Well, well, well. Look at what the cat dragged in.”
“The best thing, really, would be for you to just get your mate to accept you,” Balthazar sighed as he furiously scribbled onto the clipboard. “But I suppose it’s not an option.”
The doctor’s clinic was a small square building among so many cottages. Many of the houses were rustic, but the clinic, which would have faded into the façade of so many other towns and cities, stuck out like a sore thumb in the rustic neighborhood.
The cabin was quiet except for their hot desperate pants, the sound of colliding flesh, and the thumps as Cas’s hand struck the ceiling on the offbeat to push down.
He wasn’t prepared for the sorrow that fluttered over Cas’s face. The depth of regret in his cerulean eyes burned him, hurt him in ways he didn’t know was possible. He released a shuddering breath, and pulled Cas closer to him, relishing the scent of cherry blossoms, leather, and sandalwood. In his ear, the warm, rumbling voice whispered, “I am prohibited from falling in love, and I have broken my vows for you. I will be punished.”
He took a long sip of his coffee before adding, “Apparently, the magic users — you might hear them called onmiyōji or as Castiel called them, ‘yin-yang masters’ — found very little was as effective as powdered baku liver to get you dreamwalking.”
“It’s too coincidental not to be the same one.” Lucifer frowned. “They both talk about the Omega’s scent being sweet like caramel
reasons to keep Cas to himself. He found ways to sit and laugh with the tengu and, occasionally, they could even be found sitting by the river not talking at all. For Dean, that was damn odd: he’d never been the contemplative type. Because of this, Sam was endlessly curious, since he wasn’t sure how they had interacted when, apparently, Cas had legitimately looked like a glowing-eyed raven. The only thing that was certain was whatever relationship they had hobbled together in that time before he arrived was something solid now, unbreakable.
And it was something Dean would actually like fixed. He really couldn’t apply for jobs if he stank to high heaven, and using suppressants and scent blockers like he’s
Gripping his blue Bic pen like a lifeline, he jumped in. “Dean Winchester,” he scribbled and then ticked off, “Sex: male. Designation: Omega-2.” Huffing a sigh, he muttered to himself, “Just one billion more questions to go…”
Yana bounced up, her eyes obviously on Dean. “Mother, Kenny and Marina want to know if we have any Baba Romovaya cakes left from yesterday.”
He looked around Bobby’s attic, overstuffed with all sorts of supernatural paraphernalia, and sighed, wiping at his brow and leaving a streak of dust across it. There were mounted creature heads confiscated from hunters, locked magical boxes filled with various cursed goods, and enough antique weaponry to arm a battalion.

Amulets were passed out and a few more blessings given, especially to Dean and Sam, who were spearheading the attack on the office building. Half of the group, coordinated by Bobby, were going to maintain the barriers at the edges of the city, just in case Dean and Sam failed and the nue did show up. They needed to keep it in the city by any means possible and Bobby had spent several days doing research on the side with Akira, Sam, and Cas to figure out how to kill it.
Sighing, he walked in and eyed the interior. Fancy. Very fancy. It looked more like the lounge to Purgatory than a doctor's waiting room. Deep rich maroon couches decorated the waiting area around what looked like a fancy rug. The walls were wallpapered in ivory with a slightly darker shade striping it in 3D. There was an old painting of mostly
Sam tilted his head, like he did when he heard something he didn’t know. Dean actually thought it was adorable, and wanted to ruffle his hair, but then Mr. Blue Eyes smiled gently and laid his other hand over Sam’s in what looked like an overly friendly way.
Again, the aura of embarrassment seemed to just swirl like a heated vortex around the bird. “Something of that nature,” he said, that shifty look again coming into play as his wings hunched up a tad.
Castiel nodded. “Of course, Ichiren-Bozu. My apologies. Dean is not at all knowledgeable of our ways.”
Dean threw his hands up in surrender while Cas just looked confused. Benny pointed again at Dean, and they all ignored the knowing grin on Abram’s face as he walked out the door.
One moment he was upright and the next he was waking up half-sprawled across his bed, his legs awkwardly hanging off the edge and a pool of drool wetting the sheets.
It was nearly twenty minutes later that he heard loud, Russian arguing outside the house. He had picked up a fishing magazine that the guys had lying about, and reading about fishing in the Anchor River. He had never tried fly fishing, and he was curious about it.
“He’s gonna be here later today. He’ll probably want to have a long parley with Cas and Gabe, seeing as they’re traditionally not all that friendly, what with onmyōji trapping them and/or killing yōkai.”
Dean glared at the woman, who glared back, and pointedly motioned at his trapped hands. She snarled a tad, but released him. He took the balm with a scowl. The yellow tube said strawberry-flavored lip balm. It had a
“That’s the best you’ve got, Winchester?” She responded wryly, as she turned on her heel and walked out, the rest of her retort echoing down the hall, “I’m a New Yorker first, American second, and Japanese third. I will bitch you out, shoot you in the ass, and then thank you for the privilege. Now get out here!”
Dean scoffed at that. “In the line of fire? I’m the damn target. All these people getting popped because I was a clumsy asshole ain’t cool, so… It’s fine, Bobby. Let me go get Cas and we’ll head out in a bit.”
So when a hand grasped his shoulder and yanked to pull him away, Castiel whirled, clawed hands extended.
Castiel chuckled at their antics and he said, “Sam, you have my sympathies. I, too, am a younger brother. They never stop, even when they’re shorter than you.”
When Dean had fallen asleep wrapped in his wings, Castiel had felt himself lulled into a sense of contentment he had not felt since he was a fledgling. Dean’s deep breaths tickled over his feathers, and he occasionally nosed at them, all while making contented noises. He smelled like sunshine, leather, gun oil, and dust, and something potently just Dean that made Castiel sigh with happiness. Unable to control himself, he pulled Dean a bit closer, nuzzling at his hair and neck, his wings curling in to protect his precious cargo. As he rolled a bit closer, Dean’s sleepy hands reached out and grasped at Castiel, a small frown on Dean’s face as he missed his target. Castiel wanted to chuckle at the adorable glow of happiness that replaced the frown as he found Castiel’s chest and burrowed closer, his head tucked between Castiel’s neck and chin.
He turned to look and the big blue guy came running towards Dean, his arms flailing. He stopped just short of engaging Dean when Sam threw the pronged thing that Bobby had given him through the blue oni’s back, and it slid through its chest like the monster was made of wet tissue paper.
Cas straightened up as much as he could, still straddling Dean and nearly bumping his head on the ceiling, and smiled down at Dean.
The trio extended their greetings, and there was a crack like a gunshot as the edge of the antique side table gave up under Castiel’s grip. Someone tugged on his arm, and he turned, determined to keep himself in check, positive his Alpha was swirling too closely to the surface for it to be safe.
Akira woke him up the next morning by violently pushing him out of bed. Dean landed on his chest with a hard thump. When he reared up from his nose being smashed against the wood floor, he knocked his head into the knobby bit of the desk chair that stuck out, and ended up curled in a piteous ball, swearing a blue-streak that may or may not have frightened all the birds out of the tree outside.
Dean looked at the still swaying bangs and said, “Man, I’m telling you—give me five minutes with some clippers…”
Sure, the silk body powder had felt nice (crushed silk cocoons felt nicer than it sounded) and the pearl face cream had made his face feel smooth, but Dean Winchester was
, that sweet clean scent of his Alpha with the overtone of vanilla and something rich like molasses just pouring over Dean, and his Omega recognized it with glee.
Gabriel’s chewing had slowed down. He set down the empty tray and grabbed some Skittles, chewing thoughtfully. Dean still had that imploring expression, and, really, Castiel hoped he never had that directed at him, because he was mostly sure he’d melt like a bit of chocolate in the sun.
Dean pushed himself off the floor and tried not to knock any of the precariously piled boxes out of place. Seriously, things were packed to the goddamn ceiling, some things just shoved into the corners or whatever cubby hole in the mess it would fit into. It was a nightmare.
She stabbed Balthazar in the naked ass with her nails, causing him to howl and slide out of his chosen omega, even as the kid scrambled out of the way of the now-snarling alpha and the cold woman staring at them. But it didn’t come to down to a fight. She pointed at the sleeping Alpha being carried out, and the guy swore, nodded, and got dressed in a hurry. He scuttled after her as the sound of her stilettos clicked down the hall, and as he slipped through the door, he winked and waved at the stunned brown-haired omega he had just been fucking.
Crowley noticeably grinned under the handkerchief, pushing him towards what used to be his room. “Don’t worry about it, champ! The money that came in from your excursions with Novak covered that. He was going to buy you out anyway!” He backed up a few steps and grumbled, “Honestly, I really just need you off the premises. I’m going to have to get this place de-scented and scrubbed down.”
Dean heard low sobbing, and was surprised that it was coming from him. It was as if everything was so far away.
Gabe just smiled at him, popping a new lollipop into existence and tugging off the wrapper with two practiced fingers. “Perhaps. Or perhaps we should talk about your nocturnal emissions problem?”
He tried to ignore the panic in his voice, that the hand that was gripping Cas’s shoulder to help him stand was tightening just that little bit more. That’s when he felt Cas’s hand move to his lower back and rub circles into it, trying to soothe him.
“Dean Winchester! You tame that right now! I’m too old to have your libido stinking up the room!” He gagged. “Get your horny bottom out of here this instant! Take that disreputable Alpha with you!”
Dean licked at the seam of Cas’s mouth and, desperately, they came together again. Cas tasted like cherries and tears, and Dean tried to burn the taste into his memory.
The following week was more of the same: random giant bouquets that must have cost a fortune and that Dean wanted no part of. Purgatory was starting to smell like a hothouse, smothered in the scent of flowers because the house omegas had collected the bouquets and put them in different areas for decoration.
Dinner conversation, already somewhat strained, ground to a halt as Dean viciously attacked his noodles with his fork.
(土蜘蛛 "dirt/earth spider"):  [CREATURE] These are giant tarantula-like demons. They supposedly have oni faces, a tiger's body, and the arms and legs of a spider. They live in the mountains, where they catch travelers with their webs and ate them.
Sam covered his aching nose with a hand and threw Dean another angry look. He then turned back to Castiel, hand still over his nose, and said, “Sorry, Father.”
Cas stepped closer to the nearest tree with a low-hanging fruit, eyeing them. “I…don’t think so, Dean.”
Even now, as she stood on the balcony (they called it), listening to the rushing waters of the multiple tributaries, she could smell blood in the air as her creatures curled into the crevices left by faithless humans. Their God didn’t protect them; they didn’t really believe.
To make things worse, there were a lot of things in the large penthouse. It was minimalist in furniture and in the open design, what with uncomfortable looking couches with short backs and a room floored with what Gabe called tatami mats. In locked glass cases, old Japanese swords, paintings, kimono, and just general cultural plunder were on display throughout the penthouse. A large, heavily embroidered red kimono took up most of one wall, the design looking like a bunch of flying storks and fluffy white clouds with gold linings.
“What are you doing here?” Dean hissed, stepping out onto the deck and closing the door firmly behind him. There were few things as surreal as standing in his Batman pajama bottoms, gray Led Zeppelin t-shirt, and slippers on the trailer’s tiny porch in late November. A small breeze curled around them, and Dean shivered violently, annoyed that he had been forced from the two-layers of blankets he and Sam had pulled around themselves to watch cozy and warm inside.
Dean regarded the bird with distaste, and asked, “Is the thing that fell on my head why you’re following me?”
Dean huffed and pushed away from his overbearing boss, straightening his faux tie with one hand and picking up his drink tray with the other. “You have like twenty omegas out there, and you’re going to make
“The good Doctor Lilov and the rest were laid in their graves as soon as possible.” Liza pulled up a chair and sat down. “Greg, Anna, Ed, and Feliks were buried as soon as we could. But I believe pictures were taken of the bodies before that.”
“What in the Sam Hill is going on in here?” Bobby was in a ratty, light-blue robe, his pajama bottoms faded to an indistinguishable gray and his hole-filled slippers revealing a bare toe. He was wearing his baseball cap, which seemed odd at whatever hour of the night it was, but Bobby was a man of action. He probably was going to die in that baseball cap.
Dean shivered and rubbed his hand where Michael had been sniffing, annoyance and a tinge of fear coloring the movement. He was used to handsy alphas downstairs, but he could fight if he needed to in Purgatory. In HEAVEN, he wasn’t allowed to fight. The customers were too well off; the money just too good.

. Although he was the instrument of the guy’s doom, Dean still cringed as the fellow slid down the car trunk, leaving a bloody trail on the white paint, only to land with a pained grunt on the ground.
Bobby stood and walked over to him, taking the offending elbow in his hand and inspecting it closely. “Yeah, looks like it’s all healed up.” Narrowed blue-gray eyes glared at Dean. “Did you cut a deal with the bird, or something?”
. He swung the sword as he stood up behind the guy, and it bit into his meats right above his waistline. The guy howled, obviously not expecting it to hurt, which made sense as the shotgun blast had done nothing but ruin his “Dallas Cowboys” jersey that said, “Aoi” on the back. Dean heard him roar again as Sam poked him from the opposite side.
It felt like the giant rosette on his ass was marking his hole like a bullseye: insert raging Alpha-cock right here!
Ellen pinned her with a hard stare that had both of the younger adults blanching and shifting away from her. “Joanna Beth, if you don’t think I know what you did to that poor goat, you have another thing coming. If Castiel hadn’t offered to pay for the damage, we might have been thrown out of here!”
“Thanks, Cassy,” she whispered, dropping a kiss on his cheek and then smiling as she wiped off her lipstick imprint. “I’m so happy to see you.”
Sam snuffles, leans back, and says, “You lost a lot of blood. They didn't think you were gonna make it.”
When they first met, the Cajun twang of his accent had amused Dean to no end, and it was by hanging out between clients or, very rarely, afterwards with a bottle of brew that they grew to be friends. Dean wasn’t legal, but who’s going to deny a second-level Alpha? But he liked Benny because he never judged him. He knew Dean was doing what he had to to survive.
“I don’t know what to do, brother,” Castiel whispered hoarsely, trying to hold back his despair. “I don’t know if I can do this.”
"My Alpha wants you more than food, than drink, more than anything I have ever thought to desire, including my pledge to the Church."
“You talk pretty tough for a little bitch,” Buzz-cut snapped, pupils fully blown, froth accumulating at the corners of his mouth.
Mrs. Green was a little crazy and talked to her French Bulldog a bit too much for Dean’s comfort. She also called him Alex and dozed off in the middle of things, just like someone flipped a switch and knocked her out. She was an old alpha, in her late 80s, and Dean had no idea what she was doing in her pink mobile home with just two (evil) cats and a dog.
where Castiel was and what he was up to. And even if the obsession had somewhat settled when Castiel had moved to St. Thomas, the jealousy at Michael’s core never had.
“Uh, yeah… I’m here to see…” He shifted his hand into his pocket, keeping his distance, and pulled out a note. “Doctor Hickey?”
It was the first time the Omega wasn’t wearing a guarded look and legitimately looked like his seventeen years. His eyes sparkled joyously at teasing his little brother, and Castiel felt something warm and…
Cas was curled into the royal blue duvet like a burrito, not even caring that he was hogging all of the covers. It was typical of any winter day in their house.
A/N 3: The hotel is completely fake as I didn’t stay long enough in St. Louis to check out downtown. I did, however, have a ghost experience at the motel I stayed at, so that was nice. Not.
The feeling doubled as Cas followed soon after, his orgasm ripping through Dean as the bond transmitted it him to enjoy second-hand. Cas cried out, “Dean!” while the grace curled around them and caused their skin to glow for a moment.
person did not look like they had just stepped out of the woods after killing prey and rending it into so much meat. The entire look was somehow more barbaric by the white collar speckled by his own blood, desecrated by his own desires.
What he was going to think about was how to convince the Cete leader. He wished he could have called Bobby for advice, because this was above his pay grade. He looked over at Cas, who looked comfortable just believing in him, and he tried not to groan at the look of pure trust.
“What, he’s not charmed by the Michael persona?” Castiel blinked as he realized he’d said that out loud
She stood up when she saw them approach, dusting off the knees of her jeans, her feet in well-worn uggs, while the children behind her suddenly crowded behind her like a pile of frightened pups. They all stared at Dean and Cas’s approach, although both he and Cas had their hands out in a non-threatening manner.
Thanks to a quick text from Bobby about a probable location, and a visit to Liza, who fed them and got them a boat ride out, they were finally back on track.
At the same time, Bobby said, “Japanese. The Yumekui is from Japan. Was given to me by some old hunter who had bought it at an old black market auction a few years back. Said it had been confiscated with the Japanese internment in the forties and needed to be protected.”
“You’d know,” Dean snapped back, and, maliciously, flicked his goo-covered arm at Gabriel, striping him from head to hip with the clear liquid. Gabe looked appropriately horrified for once.
Dean muttered something under his breath, and then lightly sneezed as one of the feathers tickled his nose.
The growl in his chest escaped, warning the pest to go away. Beneath him, Dean whined softly, his body yielding to Castiel, and Castiel nuzzled him comfortingly, a low grumble tumbling from his mouth.
Cas’s wings flared up in a display of his iridescent blue-black coverts, his primaries trembling to show how much he wanted Dean. He wrapped his fist around their dicks, pumping them in unison. Dean moaned into his mouth, and Cas took that breath into himself, as if it were life itself.
He walked over to them, noting everyone was just ignoring the bead watching anime off Hulu on the small laptop, and asked, “So what’s the plan?”
Bobby glowered. “It’s damning material, but those are some wealthy toffs who have lived off defrauding their constituents. I can’t say they’ll be reeled in, especially with the DA on their side.”
wrong — there was an indication of possible apocalypse. A star that hasn’t been seen in a millennium.” She caught the gazes of the two men and said firmly, “The harbinger of fate and doom, the nue, is going to be born if we don’t stop the Baku soon.”
Jake pocketed his own fat tip, moving to the side as the omegas on cleaning duty worked around him. Exhausted, everyone dragged themselves downstairs and home, unaware of the night’s consequences.
Tired of mulling over his thoughts, he thankfully pulled into the employee parking lot, locked up, and trailed his hand across Baby’s trunk lovingly as he walked towards the side of the building. He looked over towards the front doors and, sure enough, for a Thursday, the line to get into HELL was still around the corner. Dean had no idea how Crowley pulled them in, but they were like koi competing for food at a pond.
He swung the sickle over his head again, and flung it straight at hers, and she easily ducked to the side, laughing at his aim. He smirked widely and threw the other at her, and she ducked to the other side, not realizing the trap until it was too late: there was a sickle behind her on each side, and Dean was still holding the fragile-looking chain with that grin.
“What…?” Castiel spoke ten languages fluently and that was what fell from his mouth. On the other hand, it was probably fortunate that was the only thing: his mouth was starting to water. He could have bathed the boy in it, it was getting so severe.
In the kitchen, he slipped past the lines of waiters who were prepping hors d’oeuvres and flutes of champagne for the general party guests, and careened past a familiar voice yelling, “What the hell is going on?!” before bursting out into the frigid air of Illinois.
Both he and the guy stared as the young woman kept just off the main road and smiled, beckoning him with a perfectly manicured hand. The redhead blinked and, unthinkingly, walked in closer. She moved deeper into the mouth of the alleyway and leaned over provocatively, letting the gaping neckline of her uniform reveal a cute, lacy white bra that even Dean could see from his position ten feet away, and the redhead seemed to lose all capacity for rational thought.
“Will you come to my family’s New Year’s Eve party with me? Because I’d love for you to meet them and I think you’d enjoy how festive the whole of the Novak pack lands gets. Everyone celebrates.”
After long discussions with others on the topic, I found out that people mostly thought alpha-scents were comforting to omegas. It made them feel safe. So, IF!! I were to introduce the omega-version of medical-use Slick, it would be something that's generally used for anxiety. The addiction is more like opium, numbing. Probably. So these drugs may not show up, but they exists in my brain.
The fact that Dean shoved away from Michael’s chest and gagged was lost as an unholy growl vibrated through the room, possibly even the house. The sound of snapping twigs and mushy things being squished together was nothing compared to the reek of outrage and pure fury. Screams erupted as people caught the smell and sight of what caused the cracking of the long wooden table, and then people panicked and ran as a howl rent the air and seized all the air in the room in its pure wrath.
Dean and his partner, Benny Lafitte, get lucky and one of the pigeons he keeps on payroll gives him the dirt on a guy named Tom bragging about killing some broad over on 3rd.
Restraining his urge to punch the man and run, Dean looked over at Laura, who nodded and winked at him.
The blond stopped dead, halfway to the examination table and gagged, yelping, “Dear Jesus, what is that stench?!”
He padded over to the couches, and, yep, there they were. He slid them on, feeling the heat from leaving them in front of the fire so long, and padded into the kitchen.
It felt like at least 75F wherever he was. Without the stench of wet dog in his face, the fragrances of rich fertile earth, clean water, and growing things assaulted his nose.
He ignored that niggling voice in his head and told them how Cas was fading because of the transfer, and how they were going to have to chase down the Baku because there was
When Dean finally raised his head a bit, Cas saw his eyes were dark with lust and those lips were red and slick with spit. He brushed a thumb over them, and he murmured, “I appreciate the treat, but if you keep this up, I’m
He could actually feel Sam’s pout through the door, but counted on his respect for his elders to leave it be.
Here, in this new time, the air was rife with their poisonous stench, loud with their tame metal beasts that even flew over her head.
Cas smiled and leaned up to kiss him. “Let’s get you fed,” he muttered, slipping away from Dean to get the pies.
Cas’s beady blue eyes gave him a “are you fucking serious” look and Bobby sighed and pulled up a picture on his phone.
Michael finished up his speech having grasped a flute of champagne from one of the attending elves, and toasted the assembly (one arm around Dean) with a hearty, “Happy Holidays, everyone! May your days be bright!”
Sam thought about it a moment, about living twice the amount of time he’d actually even been on this planet just wondering what might have been, and shuddered. He realized the catch and exclaimed, “But what if he chooses the Church? Dean will be unhappy.”
Michael had smiled, and then said, "Don't step on that fish, little brother. Big plans for that fish."
“I’m sure it doesn’t help most of the Winchester luck is just bad,” Bobby added, sucking on his teeth.
Dean opened his mouth to say something, when a soft, husky voice said, “It’s… his contract. With Gabriel. A promise til Dean’s death or the Baku’s dealt with.”
Dean chuckled and asked, “How’s he doing, Bobby? Is he behaving? I’m surprised dad just let him stay there…”
For another, she was a young woman in her mid-twenties, who was purely gorgeous and an interesting mix of Japanese and American cultures. She had the brash American personality; she laughed loudly and with her head thrown back, and she swore with the best of them. She had shoulder-length hair that glowed like polished onyx, and her eyes were a rich caramel that were nearly as mischievous as Gabe’s amber-hued ones. She was short at five-foot-five, and made of all angles and tight New York City energy that she could settle in a breath, surprising everyone.
It was as he made that realization that there came a low-rumbling roar that he recognized to his cells and loathed with all his being.
Joshua eyed Castiel for a moment, and shook his head as he shucked off his wellies, “Perhaps I should pass on lunch…”
Cas was struggling with the pans. There were, it seemed, two pans: a very heavy looking cast iron pan that he was waving around like it was Teflon light, and a cheap, severely scratched up Teflon pan that looked like it was going to give its next users cancer.
Her chin stubbornly lifted again, and she said something to the children behind her. Two boys nodded and ran off, Dean figured it was to tell others that they were here.
Dean was surprised to see the man even moving, since Slick smoked in a hookah made alphas sleepy and relaxed, like after a good fuck. The alcohol should have made the drowsiness worse, but no, apparently not Michael. Here he was, back to harass Dean.
Joshua noted that, even if he was being verbally defensive, a blush had colored his cheeks, while a faintly confused scowl curled his brow. His body was stiff, angry, and his scent was muddled, like he wasn’t sure how to react and he didn’t like it.
(食人鬼 "human-eating ghosts"): [CREATURE/SPIRIT] "...the spirits of greedy, selfish or impious individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat human corpses." [
Slapping him on the shoulder, Gabe jumped off the bed and said, “Glad to pop your cherry! Now, you look exhausted and, seriously, you’re going to need all your strength to put up with the entire fam.”
Nervously, Dean sat completely up, cross-legged and comfortable with the white-blanket/tarp thing around his shoulders. Near him was a small red-clay tray, like was used for holding a potted plant, with a few small carrots with long leafy tops, a miniature apple, and what looked like cherry tomatoes.
“His wife tried to stop him, but he bit her to get away and ran in front of a car.” Abram paled a bit, and swallowed hard. “The road had been slick with rain and poor Iggy wasn’t able to stop in time. The doctor was dead, his neck snapped.”
“Compared to downstairs where you just look like a proper rent-boy?” Crowley snidely remarked, eyeing Dean carefully. “Nice. Very nice,” he said, walking around Dean slowly. “Ass hugging. Perfect.
Castiel hadn’t missed the disapproval that flashed across Missouri’s face before she controlled herself and tugged a reluctant Sam into her arms.
know for certain that Dean has gotten under Castiel’s skin. That man…” He paused and shook his head. “He has to figure it out for himself, Sam. I can’t be involved because he’ll yield to what he thinks
The humidity of the greenhouse dewed their skin and Cas licked away the tiny puddles that appeared in the hollows of his collarbone, the dips in his flesh. Everything smelled like
The boy with the floppy hair squinted at him with obviously unpresented gray-green eyes and asked, “Yeah, I want to know how to become an altar boy?”
Michael tilted his head and squinted at him faintly, and Dean blinked because it was a familiar motion that he couldn’t quite place. “I see. Have you seen a doctor? I could take you to see my internist. He’s a good fellow…”
It was just as well, when from the two minuscule doors of the shrine, a tiny white fox the size of a teacup poodle leaped through and, standing on its two hind legs, front paws sliding into a presenting pose, he howled gleefully, “Heeeeeeereeeee’s Johnny!”
She knelt before the smaller table, where she had her paper works and ink, and, cupping her hands into the first mudra, she started to chant under her breath in Japanese. “With reverence and awe, I humbly request the assistance of my ancestors, as we guard this city from ruin and pray release the spirit of the Baku, Eve, from her pain.”
Missouri gave him an unimpressed look. “It wasn’t the best choice, no, but you’ve thought about things now, away from Dean’s pheromones, right?”
The buzz-cut blond in the gray hoodie was obviously their leader, as he held back the frothing big guy in a pro-football jersey over a long-sleeved shirt. Mr. Acne was actually acting fairly chill of the three, mostly just mouth breathing heavily, shifting on his feet, and clenching his hands repeatedly, so maybe he had taken a lower dose?
They had ducked behind the store and got to business, the guy pulling out his dick and Dean kneeling to do his “job.” For Dean, it hadn’t been entirely unpleasant until the guy suddenly came on his face in great volume and force. The alpha had held him there and smeared the cum all over Dean’s face, using his thumb to rub it in between his lips.
To make matters worse, every day Gabriel counted on Castiel’s ability to heal Dean in order to push him to the edge, and then they would set off hunting at night.
